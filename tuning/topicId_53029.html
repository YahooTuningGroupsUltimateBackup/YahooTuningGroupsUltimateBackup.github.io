The first octave is now being built, before<br/>building all 5 physical octaves.  There will be virtual octaves above and below<br/>those 5 octaves.  This keyboard will work with SCALA, designed by Manuel op de<br/>Coul.  Once the prototype has been turned over to Joel Mandelbaum, another 20<br/>will be built for sale at a reasonable cost.  When those are sold, we will<br/>build another 20.</p><p>The physical details in the modeling of the keyboard are beyond my complete<br/>purview, involving toolings, materials, dimensions.  Once there is an okay on<br/>the single octave by the New York group, the full prototype will be built in<br/>Toronto by Dylan Horvath.  There is a team of people making this keyboard<br/>happen.</p><p>The design by Sieman Terpstra based on some Bosanquet pioneering makes it a<br/>more natural feel for tunings, thus escaping the entrapment of the conventional<br/>12-tone Halberstadt keyboard.  The Terpstra keyboard will make it quite<br/>natural to explore different tunings.  I expect the ability to macro quick changes<br/>between tunings.  Manuel has seen the key arrangement and has agreed to make<br/>his free Internet tuning software available for the Terpstra keyboard.</p><p>We all await progress on this front at its soonest.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM, Director</p></div><h3>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;Alexmoog@otenet.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2004 1:25:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This instrument is great , but I am a little worried about the 4ms latency that it has.<br/>I wish I could try it but I don&apos;t think anybody use it in Greece...</p><p>On Apr 3, 2004, at 10:30 PM, Kurt Bigler wrote:</p><p>&gt; on 4/3/04 5:48 AM, Alexandros Papadopoulos &lt;<a href="mailto:Alexmoog@otenet.gr">Alexmoog@otenet.gr</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hello<br/>&gt;&gt; I think some people from the list are very interested about this<br/>&gt;&gt; generalized keyboard<br/>&gt;&gt; that was mentioned a while ago.<br/>&gt;&gt; I personally can&apos;t stand it anymore not being able to play other<br/>&gt;&gt; tunings besides what my piano offers , and I cannot find<br/>&gt;&gt; any other serious solutions.<br/>&gt;&gt; I could have bought the Starrlabs microzone  but I don&apos;t know exactly<br/>&gt;&gt; what  will the new keyboard offer , and<br/>&gt;&gt; how will be different from the microzone.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I know that some people here are involved in this project , so please &gt;&gt; ,<br/>&gt;&gt; can we have some information , news , updates on the<br/>&gt;&gt; progress of the keyboard making?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I am sorry if I am asking too much , but this is torturing me.<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks for your time<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t forget this keyboard which was discussed some in early march:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; on 3/4/04 3:22 PM, gooseplex &lt;<a href="mailto:cfaah@eiu.edu">cfaah@eiu.edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.HakenAudio.com/Continuum/">http://www.HakenAudio.com/Continuum/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing that I don&apos;t know whether people realize about this keyboard &gt; is<br/>&gt; that with suitable software filtering it could be mapped to have any &gt; desired<br/>&gt; &quot;key&quot; configuration you like.

Of<br/>course you are piling keyboard latency on top of midi latency, audio<br/>latency, and in a softsynth situation processor scheduling latency,<br/>midi/audio buffering latency, etc. but it is usually possible to get all<br/>those additional factors down to almost 1ms (IIRC) if your computer is<br/>powerful enough.</p><p>At the other extreme, organists are acustomed to be sitting 5 to 10 meters<br/>(15 to 30 ms) or even quite a bit more from the pipes they are playing.<br/>When I first had the 10-meter or so experience, my reaction was &quot;how can<br/>anyone play this?&quot; but I made the adjustment easy enough.

When that fails, it weakens the music.</p><p>I understand that this is certainly dependent on a lot of things.  But I<br/>want to give feedback about this &quot;absolute accuracy&quot;.  Why?  Well there is<br/>really no use in my saying any of this unless it makes you think of<br/>something you hadn&apos;t thought of before, and perhaps results in your giving<br/>an even better explanation or argument on this topic.  So bear with me and<br/>apologies to everyone if this misses.</p><p>0.0 ms latency will not cut it technically.  0 ms perhaps.  0.0 ms by<br/>technical convention implies an accuracy to the tenth of a ms.  A tenth of a<br/>ms corresponds to about 1.3 inches of distance travelled by sound.  If the<br/>distance of your ear from the drum varies by 1.3 inches, you have altered<br/>the latency in your own relationship between your action and what you hear<br/>by a tenth of a ms.  So my point is again that everything is relative.</p><p>At first look what really should matter most is the latency that the<br/>audience experiences.  If you are playing in an orchestra, and you get into<br/>being absolutely accurate, or even accurate to the nearest tenth of a<br/>millisecond, then things could get really silly.  If you had only one person<br/>in the audience, and you placed all the musicians at equal distance (to the<br/>nearest 1.3 inches) from the audience person, then you could achieve this<br/>kind of accuracy if all the musicians were basing their timing on visual<br/>cues (e.g. a conductor) that they all saw.  WIth more than one person in the<br/>audience, you begin to get into problems achieving consistent latencies from<br/>the audience&apos;s perspective.  With a large orchestra and a large audience,<br/>the problems are maximized.</p><p>So since technically accurate latencies for the audience are out of the<br/>question, then that idea has to be thrown out.  Maybe what really matters is<br/>something else.</p><p>Another place to start is to honor a less technical (but no less essential)<br/>aspect of this, which might have some relation to what you mean by &quot;absolute<br/>accuracy&quot;, which has to do the the whole web of relationships between<br/>everything involved in a musical performance.  The whole scenario, with all<br/>its imperfections and inconsistencies in latency is being dynamically<br/>integrated by performers that are in potentially dynamic relationship with<br/>the audience.  The synergy of such a situation can be &quot;right&quot; in ways that<br/>neither measurement nor science can account for, if for no other reasons<br/>then just because it is complex beyond any possibility of analysis.  This is<br/>the magic of the moment.  This can be talked about in terms like &quot;mutual<br/>entrainment&quot;, and this can help to understand some aspects of what goes on,<br/>but all understanding can pale in comparison to the richness of actual<br/>experience.  But this is not about any kind of technical accuracy.  It is<br/>full of a bunch of people integrating all kinds of latencies that simply<br/>occur naturally in the air and in the nervous system.  If you are<br/>experienced in a particular context and something is altered, it may throw<br/>you.  So introducing &quot;artificial&quot; latencies that are unfamiliar can make a<br/>mess of an individual musician&apos;s integrated experience.  However this does<br/>not mean that a new integration can not be achieved, with &quot;new latencies&quot;,<br/>but just that experiential adjustments are needed when things change.<br/>However, an experienced musician who has perfected his/her art may well not<br/>appreciate having an additional term thrown into the equation.</p><p>Now having said all that, if you were to alter a well-tuned performance<br/>situation by inserting an artificial latency of 1ms into it somewhere, I can<br/>well believe it might have an effect on the music and even on the musician&apos;s<br/>ability to perform.  A tenth of a ms?  Harder to believe.  Or rather the<br/>effect that a fraction of a ms latency might have would probably disappear<br/>into the kinds of things that will be different in every room, and every<br/>time the same instruments are set up in the same room.  Ok, I admit it,<br/>every difference *is* a difference.  Which ones matter?  Which ones are just<br/>part of the quality of the moment, whether &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;?  I can&apos;t<br/>really claim to know.  I&apos;ve given it the above kind of thought, but then my<br/>inner scientist bows to the truth of the musical moment.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Kurt</p><p>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2004 12:20:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kurt,</p><p>Interesting thoughts, and I can clarify a couple of concepts as well.

In fact, during my visit, Lippold<br/>wrote some code in Kyma which mapped a 19 tone grid to the<br/>surface.</p><p>You are correct in saying that software of this kind could be<br/>written in MAX to achieve discrete step microtunings through<br/>MIDI or digital audio. I suggested that a cross-platform software<br/>package should come with the instrument to allow the user this<br/>kind of control. Since I have experience with programming for my<br/>own microtonal instruments, I offered to develop this software for<br/>the Continuum. So, at least the idea has a possibility of being<br/>fully developed.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind if you decide to write your own<br/>software is that the keyboard does not handle &apos;unisons&apos;, or<br/>front-to-back vertically aligned pressure points. Also, according<br/>to the inventor, the response of the front-to-back sensing is such<br/>that tuning grids will be limited to three rows of virtual keys.</p><p>The surface does not lend itself to overlays, although we<br/>discussed possibly swapping out the playing surface.

In fact, during my visit, Lippold<br/>&gt; wrote some code in Kyma which mapped a 19 tone grid to the<br/>&gt; surface.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are correct in saying that software of this kind could be<br/>&gt; written in MAX to achieve discrete step microtunings through<br/>&gt; MIDI or digital audio. I suggested that a cross-platform software<br/>&gt; package should come with the instrument to allow the user this<br/>&gt; kind of control. Since I have experience with programming for my<br/>&gt; own microtonal instruments, I offered to develop this software for<br/>&gt; the Continuum. So, at least the idea has a possibility of being<br/>&gt; fully developed.</p><p>Hah!  I just suggested the same thing to them in my last message, though as<br/>a third-party development.</p><p>&gt; One thing to keep in mind if you decide to write your own<br/>&gt; software is that the keyboard does not handle &apos;unisons&apos;, or<br/>&gt; front-to-back vertically aligned pressure points. Also, according<br/>&gt; to the inventor, the response of the front-to-back sensing is such<br/>&gt; that tuning grids will be limited to three rows of virtual keys.</p><p>Oh, well that kind of shoots it a bit in the foot.  Though there are still<br/>possibilities, it seems like there are a growing number of points against<br/>it, including the overlay problem...</p><p>&gt; The surface does not lend itself to overlays, although we<br/>&gt; discussed possibly swapping out the playing surface. The<br/>&gt; problem there is that swapping the surface requires<br/>&gt; manufacturer service; it is not a recommended user-servicable<br/>&gt; operation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the issue of latency, having played the instrument myself I<br/>&gt; can say it is _not a problem in the least.

Your claim to 0 ms accuracy<br/>&gt; is unreal.</p><p>I may have phrased that poorly, but what I was getting at is very simple: when the head of my malled touches the bar of the marimba, the sound is made. There is *no* latency there. And I was relating this to the frustration of my first efforts, going back a couple of years, to finding tools for recording/electronic music that _approached_ that level of latency.</p><p>When I first tried using softsynths/samplers, the delay between when a key was pressed and when the sound was played was, to put it mildly, unacceptable. It is only now possible for me, with improvements in both software engineering and better (and faster) hardware that it is coming to be workable. I am sure that the latency on some of the first work I was trying to do was in the 30ms range, and it was impossible to record one track and play in sync with it.</p><p>Part of this might also be a fluxuation, where polyphony would induce further latency issues. All I can say is that from a lifetime (at least since I was *very* young) of having a sound come When I Want It, any delays, to the degree that is delayed, is not something I relish.</p><p>And I certainly acknowledge that there is some point between 0 and x ms that is a cutoff point, whereby any smaller delay wouldn&apos;t affect either performing or listening, and certainly not every note I&apos;ve ever played is accurate to a 1 ms grid.

That is very clear.<br/>My main experience with this probably involved a distance of about 15 feet<br/>from the pipes, IIRC, which would translate to about 15 ms.  This situation<br/>involves no &quot;quantization&quot; of latency, just latency itself.  Many organists<br/>are able to play with a much larger distance involved.  This is particularly<br/>true when there is an antiphonal (if I have the term right) division located<br/>at the opposite end of the building but playable from the same console,<br/>which is *not* generally located in the middle.  (Indeed the antiphonal<br/>should not be played simultaneously with the main organ or major latency<br/>problems occur for the listeners.)  Cathedrals can be pretty big, and her we<br/>are talking about latencies of 100 ms or more being quite ordinary.</p><p>Years ago, I had a software situation in which key events were acted on only<br/>20 times per second (thus 50 ms passes between the times when key events are<br/>sampled).  This is not just a matter of latency, but quantization of<br/>latency.  With such a system, if you happen to play one note a nanosecond<br/>after the system happens to check for key events the latency in this case is<br/>50 ms more than when you happen to hit a key a nanosecond before the system<br/>checks for key events.  I am calling this a &quot;latency quantization&quot; of 50 ms.<br/>Believe me this was intolerable--it was very hard to play at all, and I had<br/>*plenty* of opportunity to learn to adjust to this and I simply could not.</p><p>When the technology got better I was able to sample key events 43 times per<br/>second, creating a latency quantization of about 23 ms.  Although this was<br/>better, with fast pieces I had exactly the same problem I had with the 50 ms<br/>quantization:  It became *extremely* confusing to play because the latency<br/>varied from one note to the next.  The issue here is not latency but<br/>inconsistent latency caused by key presses being sampled too infrequently.</p><p>So I&apos;m pretty sure that even if 30 ms latency might be ok in some<br/>situations, that does not say anything at all to the question of whether 30<br/>ms worth of inconsistency in latency is ok.  Two different questions.</p><p>When we are talking about the Continuum fingerboard and the 4 ms &quot;scan<br/>interval&quot; we are not talking about a 4 ms latency.  We are talking about a<br/>quantization of latency which can result in latencies on subsequent notes<br/>being inconsistent by as much as 4ms.  A 4ms scan interval will result in an<br/>average scanning latency of 2ms but the latency will vary from 0ms to 4ms,<br/>and as far as the musician is concerned, it probably appear to vary<br/>&quot;randomly&quot;.  The question of whether 4ms of latency is ok is a completely<br/>different question to whether a 4ms scan interval is ok.  Note that if the<br/>pressure sensitivity of the Continuum is used directly to create the attack<br/>of the note, the attack thus being very slow as a result, in that case a 4ms<br/>scan interval will be no issue at all, I&apos;d certainly believe.  But if the<br/>same device is used to create a percussive attack that is another thing<br/>entirely.</p><p>I hope that clarifying the distinction between simple latency and<br/>inconsistency of latency might help avoid some confusion.

I think &quot;quantization<br/>resolution&quot; confuses me by introducing some slight conceptual redundancy.<br/>It sure would be nice to have simple words for all this but that is probably<br/>a luxury for something which only a small population is talking about.<br/>Language is clumsy on the frontier, you might say, and we can refine it to<br/>the degree that it becomes important to do so.  So we&apos;ll see.</p><p>By the way if we continue on latency, let&apos;s start a new thread.  I&apos;d like to<br/>take the thread with this title back to the issue of the Continuum.  At some<br/>point I will probably have the chance to try one of these devices and I want<br/>to be prepared to do sensible things with any alternate mappings.  The<br/>limitation of the device which I might call the front-to-back-monophonic<br/>limitation which you described and which Lippold Haken also told me about is<br/>something I&apos;d like to understand well enough to understand the conclusions<br/>you drew.</p><p>Given that limitation, I came up with another mapping idea.  It is a little<br/>disappointing perhaps compared to a nice hexagonal layout, but here it is.<br/>Divide the Continuum left-to-right into discrete semitones (corresponding to<br/>the visual cues that already exist), with no left-to-right pitch variability<br/>within the semitone.

I am the guy that did a lot of the audio demos on the<br/>Continuum web site and helped demonstrate it at the NAMM show, so<br/>take my opinion with that in mind. But FWIW, I will say that I&apos;m no<br/>salesman and I try to be objective about these things. I would make a<br/>lousy salesman because I would tell people everything that&apos;s wrong<br/>with the gear I was trying to sell them.</p><p>The respose time on the Continuum feels instantaneous to me; very<br/>very fast. I tend to be pretty picky about these things, especially<br/>when it comes to guitar synths (I am mainly a guitarist). The delay<br/>on most guitar synths drives me totally nuts. That&apos;s why I am so<br/>fascinated by the old Roland GR-300 and have spent a lot of time<br/>studying it...it has no percepitble delay on the high strings. To me<br/>the Continuum feels like this when I am playing a hardware MIDI synth<br/>and not a software synth on my slow old computer.</p><p>The Continuum&apos;s biggest weakness is that it is not nearly as accurate<br/>in the Y direction (front-back) as it is in the X (left-right)<br/>direction. Lippold is still working on this, but it&apos;s a very<br/>difficult problem due to the mechanics involved.</p><p>I was hoping I could divide the Y direction into six zones, and have<br/>the synth change pitch by a 4th every time you switched into a new<br/>zone. This would make it like playing single note lines on the melody<br/>half of the Chapman Stick. The Y measurement is not accurate enough<br/>on the Continuum to do this.</p><p>Fortunately, if you are not trying to do zone mapping for pitch, the<br/>Y direction is the one that is the least important in terms of<br/>expressiveness. Lippold likes to compare it to bowing on a violin. If<br/>you bow at the bridge, it sounds very different than when you bow<br/>near the fingerboard, but if you move the bow only 2mm, you will not<br/>hear a difference.</p><p>Response speed on it is simply not a problem for me, even when<br/>playing highly rhythmic music like the funky demos I did. And the<br/>dynamic response in the Z direction (up/down--how hard you are<br/>pushing) is excellent as well, especially since he started using a<br/>thicker sheet of neoprene (wetsuit material) for the playing surface.<br/>Check out my &quot;Summertime&quot; mp3 on the Haken Audio site to hear what<br/>can be done with the dynamics.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>Mark Smart<br/><a href="http://www.marksmart.net">www.marksmart.net</a></p></div><h3>gooseplex &#x3C;cfaah@eiu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2004 7:47:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Or perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt; confining the language to &apos;quantization resolution&apos; would<br/>reduce<br/>&gt; &gt; confusion? The latter seems more direct to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes well we are all informed by what has come before and<br/>when it comes down<br/>&gt; to it we just have to pick the words that seem best!  I think<br/>&quot;quantization<br/>&gt; resolution&quot; confuses me by introducing some slight<br/>conceptual redundancy.</p><p>Quantization is the process of assigning a discrete value, and<br/>resolution refers to the number of bits used in the value, so it<br/>isn&apos;t redundant to talk about quantization resolution, although I<br/>see why conceptually it may seem so, and maybe it&apos;s not an<br/>appropriate term for what you are talking about.</p><p>&gt; By the way if we continue on latency, let&apos;s start a new thread.</p><p>You might try discussing this issue on the makemicromusic list,<br/>since it&apos;s not really a tuning issue</p><p> I&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; take the thread with this title back to the issue of the<br/>Continuum.

Actually there are two separate issues<br/>here:</p><p>1. You can&apos;t play two different notes with the same X value, i.e. no<br/>unisons. This is a result of the fact that there are rods running<br/>from front to back, and the computer has no way to tell the<br/>difference between a rod with one finger on it and a rod with two<br/>fingers on it.</p><p>2. The accuracy and repeatability of the Y measurement of a single<br/>note being played on a rod is limited. This is because of the factors<br/>you mentioned above. There is the problem of the rods binding on the<br/>springs and posts, and other problems related to the fact that the<br/>fields of the magnets on the ends of the rods interact somewhat; the<br/>bar ends repel each other. Also, each magnet&apos;s field has a slight<br/>effect on its neighbor&apos;s Hall Effect sensor. Lippold has done very<br/>well working around these things, but they are big problems which are<br/>not likey to go away. The result is that you get some variation in Y<br/>value even when you hit the exact same spot repeatedly with your<br/>finger. This is still not very noticeable unless you are controlling<br/>some very sensitive parameter like pitch with the Y value.</p><p>&gt; Sounds interesting, as long as the front-to-back is 2 or 3 zones<br/>&gt; only. Left-to-right discrimination is also limited at the halfstep<br/>&gt; distance marked on the surface.</p><p>No, this is totally untrue. The X-direction measurement is EXTREMELY<br/>accurate. Lippold says it&apos;s accurate to 0.1mm and I believe him. Left-<br/>to-right is so good that you will never get any unexpected results or<br/>hear discrete steps when you slide notes. What&apos;s amazing is that this<br/>remains true even if you set it up for a MIDI Pitch Bend range of 96<br/>half steps. Lippold uses all 14-bits of the Pitch Bend message in the<br/>MIDI spec and sends the data at a very high rate, so that you NEVER<br/>EVER hear discrete steps, even when the pitch bend range stretches<br/>across the whole full-size Continuum. You can hit a note at the very<br/>bottom of the keyboard and slide it very quickly all the way to the<br/>top. The Continuum won&apos;t send a new Note On value and will do all the<br/>pitch adjustment with Pitch Bend Messages, and you absolutely cannot<br/>hear the steps, no matter how fast you slide. It&apos;s totally amazing;<br/>I&apos;ve never seen such accurate use of MIDI Pitch Bend before.</p><p>If you have a synth that won&apos;t do a 96-half-step pitch bend range,<br/>then you set up the Continuum for whatever bend range you have, and<br/>the notes will stick at one pitch when you reach the end of the pitch<br/>bend range while sliding. When I was demoing with the Sound Canvas,<br/>its maximum pitch bend range is 24 half steps, so the notes stick at<br/>one pitch when you slide more than two octaves without re-attacking.</p><p>The reason you hear steps on the pitch bend wheels of so many synths<br/>is that they do not fully implement what the MIDI spec allows. They<br/>either don&apos;t send the data fast enough, or they don&apos;t use a fine<br/>enough A/D converter to read the wheel, or both. The Pitch Bend spec<br/>is very good when implemented the way Lippold did it.</p><p>The reason that the Round Initial Pitches mode is provided is that it<br/>makes it easier to play. When you are not Rounding, it&apos;s very<br/>difficult to play chords in tune. This isn&apos;t a technical probem with<br/>the device at all, it&apos;s just the nature of the instrument. Lippold<br/>likes to call it a &quot;fretless piano&quot;. Without rounding, it is as hard<br/>to play in tune as a violin, i.e. very hard. But if you want a<br/>continuous playing surface, you have to deal with how hard it is to<br/>play. When playing the thing, you are not going to be saying &quot;This<br/>thing won&apos;t track my blazingly fast technique.&quot; You instead will be<br/>saying &quot;How many years am I going to have to practice before I can<br/>hit a chord in tune at a fast tempo without rounding??&quot;</p><p>Notice that on the &quot;Drone and Solo&quot; mp3 I am playing very slowly so I<br/>can slide the notes in tune.</p><p>Round Initial Pitches is cool because it rounds the notes to the<br/>nearest half step only on the attack, then references all subsequent<br/>bending and sliding from the spot where your finger first went down.<br/>This makes it possible to hit chords in tune quickly (like on my<br/>ContinuFunk and Sound Canvas Rhodes mp3s), but you can still do<br/>slides and vibrato. This is a really great thing.</p><p>Playing justly intonated triads is easier in this mode, too, because<br/>you can hit a chord, then bend the third down slightly to the just<br/>third. The root and fifth get rounded to their equally tempered<br/>values, which are so close to the just values that I can&apos;t hear it at<br/>all. This is much easier than trying to hit all three notes in tune<br/>with no rounding.</p><p>The lines on the playing surface do not indicate the limits of the X<br/>measurement; they are there to help the player hit the notes in tune,<br/>like the lines on the fingerboards of some fretless electric basses.<br/>The X measurement it at least 100 times as fine as the lines.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Mark Smart</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2004 5:23:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 4/7/04 11:09 AM, Mark Smart &lt;<a href="mailto:marksmartus@yahoo.com">marksmartus@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Given the Continuum&apos;s lack of accuracy and repeatability in the Y<br/>&gt; direction, I don&apos;t think this would work very well.

It would be possible to spend your whole life<br/>working on the technique. It&apos;s a totally new instrument; having<br/>regular keyboard skills doesn&apos;t help much. A lot of keyboardists at<br/>the NAMM show complained to us because they couldn&apos;t just sit down and<br/>start playing it. Some told us it should have bumps on it where piano<br/>keys would be so they could feel for the keys without looking the way<br/>they do on a regular keyboard. All we could say was, &quot;This is a new<br/>thing, it&apos;s not a piano!&quot;</p><p>I just wanted to say one more thing, which is that the Continuum is<br/>still very expressive even if you are not using the &quot;Y&quot; information at<br/>all.

This makes it like a wind<br/>controller, which only has two parameters, but is very expressive.<br/>Continuum with no Y is like a polyphonic wind controller.</p><p>This seems like a great group.

Some interesting comments in that<br/>&gt; regard lately.  Chopping the thing up into hex tiles or disabling<br/>&gt; the continuum misses the point.</p><p>I&apos;m not quite sure of what you intended in saying &quot;misses the point&quot;, but<br/>the following responses came up for me:</p><p>Part of the point of the Continnum is that you can do whatever you want with<br/>it.  All the X,Y,Z coordinate information is contantly being sent, even if<br/>you do nothing with it.  But it is there for those who want to do something<br/>with it, which includes the possibility that the generated pitch information<br/>can be ignored and other mappings substituted.</p><p>It turns out that there are some problems with the Y direction that dashed<br/>my hopes a bit.  However, the Continnum is here now, and costs considerably<br/>less than the Starr Labs keyboard (which I&apos;m not putting down, mind you), so<br/>finding out all the details of what the Continnum might and might not do in<br/>a discrete pitch mode is for me an important topic to pursue.  But also when<br/>I think of discrete pitch mappings with the continuum, I realize it can have<br/>discrete pitches &quot;with a little bending&quot; around each note available,<br/>something that no discrete-key board can do except by using the Z direction<br/>for pitch, which has its limitations.  I have heard that some keyboards have<br/>tried to use X-direction wiggle for modulation purposes, but I don&apos;t think<br/>it was a success.</p><p>So I don&apos;t think I&apos;m missing the point when thinking of the things that<br/>basically nothing *besides* the Continuum could do.  Even with discrete<br/>pitches and no other interesting modulation or polyphonic aftertouch going<br/>on, the Continuum is the only surface that within its limitations lets you<br/>map it however you want to map it, and remap it at a whim (with appropriate<br/>software support, of course).</p><p>The flexibility of how the Continnum can be used is part of its potential<br/>value for me.  If I did not also want a continuous pitch mode then perhaps<br/>my money would not be well-spent.  On the other hand, David Wessel (CNMAT)<br/>for example has used the Continnum X dimension very successfully for things<br/>totally unrelated to pitch, from what I have heard.</p><p>In short, its got a lot of things going for it besides continuous pitch that<br/>nothing else out there can touch.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>gooseplex &#x3C;cfaah@eiu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2004 2:30:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The point of the Continuum is it&apos;s implementation of the pitch<br/>&gt; continuum, so you can hit any pitch.<br/>....<br/>Chopping the thing up into hex tiles or disabling<br/>&gt; the continuum misses the point.</p><p>Perhaps it does not coincide with the aims of the inventor, but I<br/>don&apos;t think the idea of mapping a tuning &quot;misses the point&quot;...</p><p>On the contrary, mapping an unconventional fixed tuning of your<br/>choice to the flat playing surface in a _pattern of your choice with<br/>any interval spans you want per whatever distance, etc. is<br/>something worth exploring!</p><p>No amount of practice will result in being able to nail all the<br/>pitches of a specific tuning like 22ET on the Continuum as if you<br/>are playing a keyboard with one-to-one correspondences.

At one extreme, each pitch is steady<br/>for each &quot;key&quot; then abruptly changes - the discrete keyboard.<br/>At the other extreme it is completely continous as it is now,<br/>and in between you have &quot;key&quot;s that are fairly uniform<br/>in pitch. changing continuously, but very gradually, then in the<br/>cracks between the &quot;keys&quot; the pitch varies much more rapidly.</p><p>So, e.g. if your current tuning has a 7/6 in it, then a region around<br/>the 7/6 &quot;key&quot;, will play a 7/6 to within a few cents.</p><p>Then the pitch changes rapidly until you get to the next key,<br/>maybe tuned to a 6/5. Then there&apos;s another broad patch around the 6/5 where<br/>relatively large movements of the finger cause small pitch<br/>adjustments above or below a pure 6/5 and so on.</p><p>Then the user can easily hit the exact pitches, and<br/>can also explore subtle nuances of the pitches.</p><p>I can add this as a feature to FTS if any FTS user<br/>has the keyboard and wants to use it in this way<br/>with FTS. FTS could look at the pitch received from<br/>the keyboard just before the note gets played and<br/>move it closer to the nearest note in the currently<br/>selected tuning.</p><p>Indeed, come to think of it, maybe I&apos;ll add that<br/>in anyway - make it so that you can have a non linear<br/>pitch bend adjustment with the pitch bend wheel<br/>as a way to help deal with the low resolution<br/>of some pitch bend wheels by allowing more<br/>shades of pitch in the immediate vicinity of<br/>every note in the tuning.</p><p>N.B. if you use it in its current form,<br/>with the round off mode switched on,<br/>and retuning to another tuuning in FTS, it<br/>will work jsut like the ET tuning except that<br/>the initial finger position gets rounded off<br/>to a pitch in the currently selected tuning<br/>in FTS rather than 12-et. So, you could<br/>make it round off to WIII, quarter comma meantone,<br/>or whatever you want. This won&apos;t need any re-programming<br/>- FTS already does it.</p><p>Another thought, if you have two or more fingers on the<br/>same part of the keyboard, but not exactly in line, then<br/>there will be some overlap, but they won&apos;t both touch exactly the<br/>same rods. Maybe there is one rod that is only touched<br/>by one of them to one side, another only touched by<br/>another to the other side. So, perhaps you get a kind<br/>of skewed &quot;footprint&quot; which maybe software could learn to recognise<br/>and use to work out what the separate finger positions<br/>were and how many fingers were pressed, don&apos;t<br/>know if it would work, just suggesting it as an idea.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a></p></div><h3>Jeff Olliff &#x3C;jolliff@dslnorthwest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2004 6:00:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kurt and Aaron (and with thanks to Mark for contributing so much<br/>hands-on experience),</p><p>My apologies for the remark about missing the point.  Your rebuttals<br/>are well taken.  I was in too big a hurry.</p><p>I&apos;m very happy to see this discussion happening.  I hadn&apos;t<br/>considered the problem of the granularity of half steps, although it<br/>should have been obvious from the implementation.  My very old<br/>fashioned mean tone orientation uses diatonic half steps, wider than<br/>12tet, but not the narrower chromatic ones.  Maybe the diatonic<br/>variety would work on the continuum, for the most part, but I&apos;d have<br/>to try it to find out.  I&apos;m shooting for the same flexibility the<br/>17th century Italians were, a practical distinction between sharps<br/>and flats, basically because temperament is bad for polyphony.</p><p>I also hadn&apos;t realized the limitation of resolution on the y axis,<br/>front to back.  Using the z axis (key depth) for fine tuning is<br/>analogous to the clavichord&apos;s subtle and hazardous intonational<br/>control, and is a very interesting idea.  I jumped to the conclusion<br/>we had to move tuning to the x axis, a momentary mental straight<br/>jacket.</p><p>Another quick thought: a run stepping through chromatic half steps<br/>(F-F#, etc) would require a slightly detached technique, just as on<br/>a fretted clavichord where those notes share a string choir, and<br/>very unmusical ciphers occur trying to play them together.</p><p>Jeff O</p></div><h3>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;Alexmoog@otenet.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2004 12:35:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello<br/>I am Alexandros Papadopoulos from Greece , we have talked about this keyboard some time before.<br/>You then told me that  20 keyboards will be build , and when these are sold, more will come.<br/>Is there a list of people waiting for these?<br/>If yes , can I be on the waiting list ?
