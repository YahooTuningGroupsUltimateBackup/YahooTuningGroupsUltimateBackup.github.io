Here the fifth is set to be<br/>exactly 356525/512, or 696 173/512, cents. This is between the fifths<br/>for 31 and 50, near that of 81. The feature of this fifth is that it<br/>is flat from 700 cents by 1875/512 cents, which multiplied by<br/>8192/1200 results in 25. Hence the fifth is 700 cents, pitch bended<br/>down by 25, and any of the pitches in this system will have pitch<br/>bends of 8192 plus or minus 25n, for integers n. Hence if a midi file<br/>in this tuning is converted to a text file or examined in a midi<br/>editor, it is easier to tell what we are looking at, which can be<br/>useful if you are doing retuning.</p></div>
