But I have yet to hear a convincing<br/>struck-string timbre from a synthesizer.  Then there is the resonance<br/>between strings.  Generalmusic tried to model this on the Pro2, but failed.<br/> Then there is control.  A properly-regulated piano gives unmatched control<br/>over volume and *attack characteristics*.  Most of this stuff should be<br/>possible on a synth, but it just hasn&apos;t been done.</p><p>&gt;While I am also extremely doubtful that carbon fibre or fibreglass is ever<br/>&gt;going to be the basis of a good soundboard</p><p>The lighter and more rigid, the better.  The more resistant to humidity<br/>changes, the better.  Even alluminum makes a fantastic soundboard, if<br/>you&apos;ve ever heard a Challis instrument.</p><p>&gt;I have yet to encounter a set of plastic keys which are satisfactory in<br/>&gt;texture or weight when compared to the San Franciso-built Broadwood<br/>upright &gt;with which I grew up.</p><p>Plastic keys?  I know of no piano ever produced with plastic keys.  The<br/>boys at DS Keyboards experimented, but found wood to be the best material.<br/>If you mean key tops, i.e. plastic v. ivory, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s really a<br/>significant difference.</p><p>&gt;Not to mention that the development costs for a carbon fibre soundboard<br/>&gt;would be astronomical.</p><p>How do you figure?  Carbon fiber is inexpensive, and soundboard design is<br/>trivial.</p><p>&gt;Has anyone made a serious effort to market an improved piano? And if not,<br/>&gt;why not? It might even be possible to make some money selling them.</p><p>Pianos don&apos;t make very much money, even when you mass produce them.  But<br/>I&apos;m sure one could do alright.  Marketing would have to be tactful.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
