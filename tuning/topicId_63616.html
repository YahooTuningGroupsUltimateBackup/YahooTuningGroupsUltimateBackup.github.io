The real issue for me, is, what sort of music would I want to play on it? I&apos;ve been told that Eduardo Sabat&apos;s sons have a site where they are playing jazz standards in 53, but I&apos;ve not heard it yet. At this point, jazz in 19 eq is super hip for me, cause it twists it just enough to make it intriguing, and the frets are far enough apart to facilitate complex chords, walking basslines, and the general sound of standard jazz (of course, I also like non standard jazz). If I had more $$$, I&apos;d have a lot more guitars, so if money becomes available I&apos;d have to be real picky about which tuning system I want to get into next. 53 has not interested me to this point, but who knows.<br/>  On the subject of the 22 srutis, I am reading a book that Haresh sent me, and according to this author the srutis are arrived at by mixing cycles of 5ths and 4ths...then they tweak a couple of notes by a couple of cents to make them 5 limit. And, this ties in with what Yahya just said; when does such activity become just an intellectual exercise in tuning theory, and when is it meaningful to real playing? I mean, I just mentioned that myself,   that an interval of 2 cents, in the real world on acoustic instruments, is meaningless. So, if the spiral of 5ths maj 3rd is 384 cents, with a high ratio, and the 5/4 is only 2 cents sharper, who cares? On paper maybe it means something, but 2 cents is 2/100&apos;s of a fret, pretty teensy indeed for actual music.<br/>  And, you know, we all chat a lot about ancient theories from India and Arabia and elsewhere, but lately, more than ever, I&apos;ve been wondering if, in fact, all sorts of tunings were tried out over the centuries in these, and other, countries, by curious and brilliant folks who wanted to see what was possible. Why not? In fact, although the 7 limit doesn&apos;t seem to be a part of Indian music, somewhere a while back I seem to recall someone saying that Erv Wilson had visited with an Indian musician who had, indeed, used 7 limit in his music...was that you, Kraig? If not, is this a real incident? Danielou said in his &quot;Music and the Power of Sound&quot; that Indian musicians avoided the 7th harmonic for spiritual reasons, but I&apos;d be surprised if it hasn&apos;t been used at some time or another.<br/>  Which brings me to another question that just occurred to me recently...in Barbour&apos;s Tuning and Temperament, there are a number of Greek scales with the dreaded 7 limit; so, why did the 3 limit, so called Pythagorean tuning, become so popular, when all these other rather interesting scales were around as well? And, why, indeed, IS the 7th harmonic often absent from the storied scales of India, Arabia, and Europe? It sure sems to add a lot of depth to music, period, so was Danielou&apos;s hypothesis correct? Were folks a bit scared of the 7th harmonic? I realize there may not be any one ansewr to these sorts of questions, but would like to see what folks here think about this...best...HHH</p></div><h3><a id=63617 href="#63617">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2006 6:51:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If I had more $$$, I&apos;d have a lot more guitars, so if money becomes<br/>&gt; available I&apos;d have to be real picky about which tuning system I want<br/>to get<br/>&gt; into next. 53 has not interested me to this point, but who knows.</p><p>53 is good for the schismatic/garibaldi tuning system we were talking<br/>about, but it does other things.

In fact, although the 7 limit<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t seem to be a part<br/>&gt; of Indian music, somewhere a while back I seem to<br/>&gt; recall someone saying that<br/>&gt; Erv Wilson had visited with an Indian musician who<br/>&gt; had, indeed, used 7 limit<br/>&gt; in his music...was that you, Kraig? If not, is this<br/>&gt; a real incident?<br/>&gt; Danielou said in his &quot;Music and the Power of Sound&quot;<br/>&gt; that Indian musicians<br/>&gt; avoided the 7th harmonic for spiritual reasons, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be surprised if it<br/>&gt; hasn&apos;t been used at some time or another.<br/>&gt;    Which brings me to another question that just<br/>&gt; occurred to me<br/>&gt; recently...in Barbour&apos;s Tuning and Temperament,<br/>&gt; there are a number of Greek<br/>&gt; scales with the dreaded 7 limit; so, why did the 3<br/>&gt; limit, so called<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning, become so popular, when all<br/>&gt; these other rather<br/>&gt; interesting scales were around as well? And, why,<br/>&gt; indeed, IS the 7th<br/>&gt; harmonic often absent from the storied scales of<br/>&gt; India, Arabia, and Europe?<br/>&gt; It sure sems to add a lot of depth to music, period,<br/>&gt; so was Danielou&apos;s<br/>&gt; hypothesis correct? Were folks a bit scared of the<br/>&gt; 7th harmonic? I realize<br/>&gt; there may not be any one ansewr to these sorts of<br/>&gt; questions, but would like<br/>&gt; to see what folks here think about this...best...HHH<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

Quite possibly the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;original 22 were close to equal spacing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why would you think so?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bharata defined intervals being consonant or dissonant according to the<br/>&gt; number of srutis that made them up. ...</p><p>That doesn&apos;t make the srutis equal.</p><p>For example, n steps of m cents may be not quite<br/>enough to fill some desired consonant interval<br/>of p cents, whereas another step of m cents may<br/>overshoot that interval:<br/> n*m &lt; p &lt; (n+1)*m</p><p>So in this example there may be n srutis of one<br/>size and 1 sruti of another required to fill the<br/>given consonant interval - in exactly the same<br/>way as it takes two meantone wholetones and<br/>one meantone semitone to make a meantone<br/>fourth.</p><p>Besides, didn&apos;t Bharata recognise as consonant<br/>only those intervals the West calls perfect - the<br/>fourth, fifth and octave?</p><p>Further, saying, for example, that the fourth is<br/>that interval which comprises 9 srutis, is after<br/>the fact, exactly as we might say that the fourth<br/>is that interval which comprises 5 semitones.  We<br/>might come to that conclusion after tuning a<br/>keyboard in 12-EDO, or equally, after tuning the<br/>same keyboard in some well-temperament,<br/>meantone or 5-limit JI.  In the first case, the 5<br/>semitones that comprise the fourth are equal by<br/>definition; but that is not the case for 5-limit JI.<br/>So the fact, that we can characterise an interval<br/>by the count of tuning steps included in it, is no<br/>guarantee that those steps are equal.  If it were,<br/>then all meantone and well-temperaments would<br/>necessarily be equal ... !  To conclude that the<br/>22 srutis were equal because Bharata counted<br/>them is a bizarre leap of logic.</p><p>But I do hope there is a stronger case than that,<br/>perhaps involving &quot;facts not in evidence&quot;.</p><p>&gt; ...

Theatre?</p><p>Bharata wrote an extensive account of a particular kind of devotional theatre.  As music was an intrinsic part of it, a lot of his account is about music.  But it doesn&apos;t claim to speak about Indian music in general.  There&apos;s another account from around the same time that mentions srutis, and is purely about devotional music.  So the nearest modern equivalent could well be Vedic chant rather than classical music -- but it&apos;s such a long time ago that the lines of influence are hopelessly tangled.</p><p>Many Indian writers talk about Bharata as if he were describing classical music similar to their own time.  You have to be careful about this.</p><p>&gt; To &quot;be mentioned&quot; may still not be &quot;many words&quot;.</p><p>There&apos;s no evidence for drones in Indian music before the 15th Century.   The instruments that could have supported them were being introduced around the 12th Century, and the classical music was generally going through changes at this time that would have made drones more appropriate.  There are suggestions that flutes might have been used as a drone, but I have no idea how plausible.  The earliest sources for srutis (which quote earlier texts) are probably Fourth Century.</p><p>&gt; That doesn&apos;t make the srutis equal.<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, n steps of m cents may be not quite<br/>&gt; enough to fill some desired consonant interval<br/>&gt; of p cents, whereas another step of m cents may<br/>&gt; overshoot that interval:<br/>&gt;  n*m &lt; p &lt; (n+1)*m<br/>&gt; &gt; So in this example there may be n srutis of one<br/>&gt; size and 1 sruti of another required to fill the<br/>&gt; given consonant interval - in exactly the same<br/>&gt; way as it takes two meantone wholetones and<br/>&gt; one meantone semitone to make a meantone<br/>&gt; fourth.</p><p>You&apos;re assuming that the srutis were supposed to exactly give the actual intervals, which I don&apos;t think Bharata said.  Of course, without a complete translation I have no idea what he didn&apos;t say.  He certainly didn&apos;t have a concept of cents.  No Indian sources from this time mention a relationship between string-length ratios and consonances which makes it much harder to do the calculations.  Neither do we know that Bharata was a mathematician.</p><p>But no, we don&apos;t know the srutis weren&apos;t equal.  We don&apos;t know very much at all.  But the simplest explanation is that they were supposed to be equal.  Widdess says &quot;nominally equal&quot; -- presumable that they were treated equal, even if they couldn&apos;t have been tuned equally.</p><p>&gt; Besides, didn&apos;t Bharata recognise as consonant<br/>&gt; only those intervals the West calls perfect - the<br/>&gt; fourth, fifth and octave?</p><p>Yes, but only certain tunings of the fourth and fifth, which we recognise as being the 3-limit ratios.  That&apos;s probably what the srutis were brought in to explain.  Why the 7-note diatonics, which they knew contained three different step sizes, had fourths and fifths that didn&apos;t sound good in harmony.</p><p>&gt; Further, saying, for example, that the fourth is<br/>&gt; that interval which comprises 9 srutis, is after<br/>&gt; the fact, exactly as we might say that the fourth<br/>&gt; is that interval which comprises 5 semitones.  We<br/>&gt; might come to that conclusion after tuning a<br/>&gt; keyboard in 12-EDO, or equally, after tuning the<br/>&gt; same keyboard in some well-temperament,<br/>&gt; meantone or 5-limit JI.  In the first case, the 5<br/>&gt; semitones that comprise the fourth are equal by<br/>&gt; definition; but that is not the case for 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt; So the fact, that we can characterise an interval<br/>&gt; by the count of tuning steps included in it, is no<br/>&gt; guarantee that those steps are equal.  If it were,<br/>&gt; then all meantone and well-temperaments would<br/>&gt; necessarily be equal ... !  To conclude that the<br/>&gt; 22 srutis were equal because Bharata counted<br/>&gt; them is a bizarre leap of logic.</p><p>If you say that any interval of 5 semitones is a consonance you&apos;ll be bitten by a meantone wolf -- if you tune up all 12 notes.  If you&apos;re only tuning up pentatonics then, yes, the semitones are pretty much equal.  You aren&apos;t likely to guess their inequality by ear.  We -- or, at least, I -- don&apos;t even know that Bharata (or anybody at that time) did tune up all 22 srutis.</p><p>Also, when you say &quot;meantone and well-temperaments would necessarily be equal&quot; that misses the point.  Bharata wasn&apos;t talking about these fine-tuning distinctions.  He only needed his diatonic scales to contain two different sizes of whole tone.  He probably didn&apos;t know himself what the exact ratios of interval size should be.  He also specified that certain notes should be played with vibrato on the flute -- so he specifically wasn&apos;t talking about precise tuning.</p><p>&gt; But I do hope there is a stronger case than that,<br/>&gt; perhaps involving &quot;facts not in evidence&quot;.</p><p>No, there&apos;s no strong case for any specific interpretation of Bharata&apos;s srutis but many people searching for one.  If there are early sources describing tuning 22 srutis by fifths, or showing that the cycle of fifths closes at 53 notes, that would imply Pythagorean tuning.  But I haven&apos;t seen any such facts in published sources.  You can chase it down if you want.  It&apos;s a lot of trouble and ultimately pointless.  We don&apos;t need vague 4th Century texts to tell us about 22-equal, or schismatic temperament, or 5-limit diatonics.  It&apos;s much easier to consider them on their own merits with the much superior musical and mathematical tools we now have available.</p><p>&gt;&gt;... That&apos;s an elaborate structure if he<br/>&gt;&gt;was only talking about notes against a drone. ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;only&quot;???</p><p>One of the interpretations is that when he said &quot;9 and 13 srutis are consonances&quot; he meant the notes 9 and 13 srutis from the tonic, not all notes of 9 and 13 srutis.</p><p>&gt;&gt;...

During the same time zither-like instruments had replaced harp-like instruments and so musicians weren&apos;t constrained by a fixed tuning.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=63740 href="#63740">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2006 10:19:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But no, we don&apos;t know the srutis weren&apos;t equal.
