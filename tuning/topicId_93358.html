Working from a regular mapping standpoint there are ways to define a keyboard mapping so that it has the same fingering in every single tuning of a given temperament (like meantone/syntonic, magic, hanson/kleismic). These layouts with &quot;tuning invariance&quot; can be described and compared mathematically. Take a look at this paper, which delves pretty deeply into the mathematics:<br/><a href="http://www.thummer.com/ThumTone/Tuning_Invariant_Layouts_Last_Draft.pdf">http://www.thummer.com/ThumTone/Tuning_Invariant_Layouts_Last_Draft.pdf</a></p><p>It is the opinion of the authors of that paper (and myself) that the optimal layout for playing microtonal music is the Wicki/Hayden layout. It retains the most consistent &quot;swath thickness&quot; across generator sizes while still having a reasonable harmonic and melodic gamut necessary to play important MOS scales.</p><p>You can see the wicki-hayden layout used to play alternative tunings in these two videos:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd4h8vmEsQM</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--pLdh1m8E8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--pLdh1m8E8</a></p><p>John</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2010 1:35:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m getting one of these next week:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=prod_axis-49">http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=prod_axis-49</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 98 keys for &lt; $500.
