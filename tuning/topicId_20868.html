Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2001 1:36:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;Anyway, my decatonic system has a form of transposability, only slightly<br/>&gt;more complex than &quot;transpoability&quot; as you&apos;ve defined it.</p><p>Let me explain about decatonic transposability.</p><p>There are two forms of the decatonic scale:</p><p>Symmetrical decatonic:  L s s s s L s s s s<br/>Pentachordal  &quot;  &quot;   :  L s s s L s s s s s</p><p>Note that all rotations are considered equally interesting/valid here.</p><p>First, first note that the symmetrical decatonic is a &quot;mode of limited<br/>transposition&quot; -- which means you can transpose it a half-octave with _no_<br/>changes in the pitch set.</p><p>Second, note that the pentachordal decatonic, though not an MOS, still has a<br/>&quot;characterstic interval&quot;: s s s s s (or L s s s L) -- which only occurs in<br/>one out of ten positions in the scale. Now, as you&apos;ve pointed out, in the<br/>MOS case altering the characteristic interval (by moving either endpoint) so<br/>that it becomes the &quot;perfect&quot; interval (namely the generator of the MOS)<br/>results in a rotation of the scale. In this case, however, doing the<br/>alteration (so that it becomes the much more common &quot;perfect decsixth&quot;)<br/>results in a symmetrical decatonic scale! So rather than rotating, you&apos;ve<br/>&quot;jumped&quot; from one scale to the other.</p><p>Third, you can &quot;jump back&quot;. In the symmetrical decatonic scale, the closest<br/>thing to a &quot;characteristic interval&quot; is s s s s (or L s s s s L), which only<br/>occurs in two out of ten positions in the scale. Altering one endpoint of<br/>one occurence of this, so that you get the much more common interval<br/>(&quot;perfect decfifth&quot; or &quot;perfect decseventh&quot;), results in a pentachordal<br/>decatonic scale!</p><p>Fourth, Dan Stearns has stated that he views the symmetrical decatonic as an<br/>MOS, with generator L+3*s or s, and with periodicity at the half-octave<br/>instead of the octave. On this view the scale is simply</p><p>L s s s s,</p><p>the characteristic interval is s s s s, and the MOS rule applies -- the<br/>scale just rotates when you alter the characteristic interval. In terms of<br/>the usual octave periodicity, though, this means that _two_, rather than<br/>one, pitches have changed as a result of this rotation.</p><p>Fifth, either of the decatonic scales can be considered to be two<br/>intertwined pentatonic scales, both of the form</p><p>L+s s+s L+s s+s s+s.</p><p>In the pentachordal decatonic scale, the two pentatonics are an s apart from<br/>one another, while in the symmetrical decatonic scale, they are a<br/>half-octave (L+4*s) apart. Either way, each pentatonic scale is an MOS with<br/>generator (L+s)+(s+s) or (L+s)+2*(s+s), and if you apply &quot;transposability&quot;<br/>to both pentatonics simultaneously, you&apos;re applying it to the full decatonic<br/>-- you&apos;ll be rotating it, and _two_ pitches will change. (In the symmetrical<br/>decatonic case, this fifth view results in the same transpositions as the<br/>fourth view.)</p><p>Thus we see that there are a plethora of simple &quot;modulation&quot; operations<br/>within the decatonic framework.</p><p>The first leaves a sym. dec. scale with all pitches unchanged.</p><p>The second changes a pent. dec. scale to one of two possible rotations of<br/>the sym. dec. scale; one pitch changes.</p><p>The third changes a sym. dec. scale to one of _four_ possible rotations of<br/>the sym. dec. scale; one pitch changes.</p><p>The fourth changes a sym. dec. scale to one of two possible rotations of<br/>itself; two pitches changes.</p><p>The fifth changes either kind of decatonic scale to one of two possible<br/>rotations of itself; two pitches change.</p><p>Hope this was enjoyable to you and that you will include these scales in<br/>what you&apos;re working on.</p><p>P.S. Stephen Soderberg may note that I did not make use of any ratios or<br/>overtones in the above -- it was purely &quot;set theory&quot; (right?) But, I note<br/>that these properties are merely the _result_ of analyzing the decatonic<br/>scales after they have been constructed -- none of these properties were<br/>criteria used to derive the scales in the first place.</p><p>You&apos;d find a similar pattern of transpositions among, for example, the class<br/>of eight-tone scales in 18-tone equal temperament that can be constructed<br/>from steps of 3/18 oct. and 2/18 oct. . . .however you won&apos;t find me<br/>claiming that these scales contain any semblance of &quot;consonant harmony&quot; or<br/>&quot;tonality&quot;.</p><p>On the other hand, the class of twelve-tone scales in 26-tone equal<br/>temperament follows a similar pattern too, and _does_ have many of the<br/>properties I consider necessary for modal and perhaps even tonal harmony.</p></div><h3><a id=21007 href="#21007">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/12/2001 8:56:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul H.

Imagine analyzing, for example, Berg&apos;s Violin Concerto<br/>as simply a series of sets (well, in that case, entire tone rows) with<br/>no reference whatever to the overtone series or a harmonic basis...</p><p>_______ _____ _ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
