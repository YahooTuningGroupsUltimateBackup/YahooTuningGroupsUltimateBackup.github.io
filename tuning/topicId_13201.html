The<br/>neurosis usually terminates in complete atrophication of the desire<br/>to create music, and the only know cure being a doctor prescribed<br/>therapeutic regiment of musical practice, sometimes lasting many<br/>years, but often results in no improvement in the patients thus<br/>studied. Sufferers of the disorder &quot;Harmonia Atrophia&quot;, can be a<br/>sorry lot, as they are prone to endless and consensusless argument<br/>and disagreement, resulting in getting no music written. The ancient<br/>Greek theorist Petrifyticus (6th cen.bce.), was stricken with the<br/>disease, and had to practice the Aulos for 30 years to recover from<br/>the malady. He is mostly remembered for his famous axiom &quot;If you<br/>don&apos;t use it - you lose it&quot;.</p><p>}: )</p></div><h3>Paul H.

And I am certain that you meant it in a very light-hearted way, which I appreciated and think I understood correctly. And I wasn&apos;t getting mad.</p><p>However, things are starting to get a little crazy, very unintentionally I would say, so let me mention the following:</p><p>First, Dante posted:</p><p>&gt; &gt; People are so unconscious in their projections...  all I can make<br/>&gt;of these recent (and recurring) attacks on the &quot;theorists&quot; is that<br/>&gt;they are made by those who wish they could understand what was going<br/>&gt;on theoretically, but cannot.</p><p>Dante, I am sorry, but you appear to be just as &quot;unconscious in your projections&quot; as you accuse others (I imagine that I&apos;m a prime provocateur). What theory I am interested in, I understand quite well; any theories that I &quot;wish&quot; to understand, I follow up on and learn. Thanks for both assuming and presuming about that which you don&apos;t know for sure.</p><p>{Joe}<br/>&gt;YES.  Just because people are trying to find an &quot;ultimate background&quot;<br/>&gt;to music doesn&apos;t mean they should be villified.  I maintain it&apos;s done<br/>&gt;by the &quot;middlebrows&quot;... just like middlebrows ALWAYS villify anything<br/>&gt;they don&apos;t understand.  That&apos;s why intellectuals in this country are<br/>&gt;so despised....  I hate to see this attitude even permeating this<br/>&gt;list.</p><p>Hey, Joe, all I was doing, in my original post, was to wonder aloud whether all the massive number-crunching being done around here lately would lead to any musical epiphanies. I also wondered aloud as to whether there was an upswing in substantial gains to the world of music in the last x number of years by virtue of all this. And at wondering aloud, I&apos;ve found out a good number of things to investigate, after sorting through the attitudes.</p><p>I speak for myself: I went out of my way (as I always try to do) to *not* slam those who are &apos;hot on the trail&apos;. If anything, I appreciate academia and scholasticism when it is taken to the nth degree, all the t&apos;s dotted and the eyes crossed (hmmm, Neil is probably hating me now &lt;g&gt;). But Joe, I didn&apos;t vilify your pursuit, and I don&apos;t despise the effort, and it isn&apos;t particularly fun to be considered &quot;middlebrow&quot; -- I always shave between my eyes.</p><p>{Joe}<br/>&gt;but the general attack on the mind around here is intolerable.</p><p>If I ever thought that were happening, I&apos;d be complaining too.</p><p>{Joe}<br/>&gt;I also can&apos;t understand a LOT of this stuff, but at least I RESPECT it... &gt;unlike the cretins.</p><p>Uncalled for, don&apos;t you think?</p><p>{Joe}<br/>&gt;What Paul has been doing is extremely important... it&apos;s a method for<br/>&gt;determining in a scientific way a groundwork for concordance.  There<br/>&gt;can be NOTHING more important!</p><p>Well, Joe, the second statement could certainly be different for lots of people, it&apos;s just that there is apparently nothing more important to *you*.</p><p>But I want to say something here as well: it has taken time, and it has been only through a lot of give and take, but I for one have become very impressed by Paul in his dogged pursuit of some of these subjects. If at times we (the list) have had problems, it has almost always been a misunderstanding in tone. I remember very well a point when, after lots of posts, lots of confusion, and lots of bickering, Paul posted a three-part series that helped a great number of people on the subject, in a manner that was patient and time-consuming. If he didn&apos;t care, he wouldn&apos;t have done it; in spite of the fact that most of this kind of work is something I won&apos;t be partaking of, I can, and do, appreciate his enthusiasm, focus, and desire to share.</p><p>From all I can tell, it (Paul&apos;s work, and others) *does* look to be the bedrock of a better understanding of a number of key concepts. I only hope that Paul can take a little time away from the work-in-progress and post most of this on one, dedicated website, so that we could point interested parties in that direction, instead of a paper here, a .jpg there, etc. It seems too important to be scattered about.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how I could make the preceding statement of support more clear than this.</p><p>{Dante}<br/>&gt;Or in this case, theres nothing that makes someone with a slow brain feel &gt;worse about themselves than seeing someone with a fast brain doing their thing.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>{Joe}<br/>&gt;but to deprecate talented others... reprehensible!</p><p>I concur. Now everyone be sure they live by the rules they espouse, OK?</p><p>{Dante}<br/>&gt; &gt; Those who complain here would have us believe that they are concerned &gt; about the theorist&apos;s souls, that they are not getting enough nourishment &gt; on their diet of dry numbers. How compassionate of them to be so &gt; concerned about their fellow humans!</p><p>I&apos;m slow, I&apos;ll admit, but that&apos;s sarcasm, right? No, that was not my concern, because a lot of these cases, especially those involving outright (and utterly misplaced) hostility makes me actually not give a flying fuck. I&apos;ll save my compassion for people that are actually in dire straits, not intelligent folk who can very well fend for themselves.</p><p>{Joe}<br/>&gt;You&apos;re over at Juilliard, right?? It&apos;s nice to see that there are a<br/>&gt;few good musicians with BRAINS in the world!</p><p>So, at the end of this bit: Joe, I suppose if this kind of stuff *were* to make me mad, a statement like that would. I am surprised at these words from you, and hope that it was a heat-of-the-moment reply. In any case, if you consider me or some of the others posting along these lines to be nothing more than Neanderthals, there really isn&apos;t anything I can do about it.

Noone is brought to this list at<br/>gunpoint, you have to go out of your way to subscribe. Whats more, there is<br/>no limit to the number of posts each day, so noone is excluded from posting<br/>whatever they want in the way of discussion. So why, if a number of members<br/>are interested in exploring the mathematical dimensions of<br/>psycho/physio/acoustic tuning theory, are there always others who feel<br/>compelled to criticise this? Not criticise particular findings of this<br/>investigation, but rather criticise the activity itself, as if there was<br/>something wrong with it?</p><p>I don&apos;t recall any tuning theorists saying that writing and playing music<br/>was a waste of time, so why do those less inclined to theory feel the need<br/>to say that tuning theory is a waste of time? Isn&apos;t there enough room in the<br/>world, and time in the day, for both?</p><p>In light of this, all I can come up with is that some must feel intimidated<br/>by the discussions. Perhaps understandable, given the level of rigor that is<br/>being attempted. Apparently, some who are so intimidated feel the need to<br/>lash out at that which they either do not understand, or do not &quot;approve&quot;<br/>of, for some reason. There can be do denying that, on more than one<br/>occasion, various members have aired their grievances in such a way that<br/>seems completely inappropriate considering what it is that they are lashing<br/>out against.

I also wondered aloud<br/>as to whether there was an  upswing in substantial gains to the world<br/>of music in the last x number of years by virtue of all this. And at<br/>wondering aloud, I&apos;ve found out a good  number of things to<br/>investigate, after sorting through the attitudes.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah, but go back to your post, and you will find that it was quite<br/>deprecatory and sinister... even implying poor compositional skills<br/>by members of this list.  It was the *ATTITUDE* that got people<br/>going, not your questioning....

I go for &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; myself...</p><p>I remember very well a point when, after<br/>lots of posts, lots of confusion, and lots of bickering, Paul posted<br/>a three-part series that helped a great number of people on the<br/>subject, in a manner that was patient and time-consuming.

How compassionate of<br/>them to be so concerned about their fellow humans!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m slow, I&apos;ll admit, but that&apos;s sarcasm, right?</p><p>It&apos;s was clever and pretty well-written, and had me writhing on the<br/>floor with devil-convulsions.</p><p>No, that was not my concern, because a lot of these cases, especially<br/>those involving outright (and utterly misplaced) hostility makes me<br/>actually not give a flying fuck.</p><p>Actually, that&apos;s now a word, according to the New Yorker...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll save my compassion for people that are actually in dire<br/>straits, not intelligent folk who can very well fend for themselves.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Makes sense</p><p>&gt; {Joe}<br/>&gt; &gt;You&apos;re over at Juilliard, right?? It&apos;s nice to see that there are a<br/>&gt; &gt;few good musicians with BRAINS in the world!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, at the end of this bit: Joe, I suppose if this kind of stuff<br/>*were* to make me mad, a statement like that would. I am surprised at<br/>these words from you, and hope that it was a heat-of-the-moment reply.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry... my underwear was showing.

Many<br/>people here have helped develop my ideas immensely, and I value all<br/>the criticism my<br/>ideas get (though I wish more people criticized them, or at least<br/>prodded me to put the<br/>ideas in a form they can understand, when they don&apos;t understand them).</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2000 10:45:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; People are so unconscious in their projections...<br/>&gt; all I can make of these<br/>&gt; recent (and recurring) attacks on the &quot;theorists&quot;<br/>&gt; is that they are made by<br/>&gt; those who wish they could understand what was going on<br/>&gt; theoretically, but cannot.</p><p>I understand what harmonic entropy is (a way of calculating<br/>consonance and dissonance), I just don&apos;t have any use for it<br/>and...I would rather be making music.</p><p>David Beardsley</p><p>I hope this message goes through, my email<br/>has been down since last night and this egroups<br/>way of posting a message is a bit clumsy.
