However, that piece was<br/>&gt; fortunately near the beginning; tuning later suffered.</p><p>Your comment raises the point that listeners may hear the major 2nd in<br/>this kind of quintal/quartal sonority either as a &quot;clash&quot; or as what<br/>I&apos;d describe as an &quot;energetic blend or fusion.&quot;</p><p>From one 20th-century point of view, sonorities of this kind<br/>are described as &quot;fourth chords&quot; (e.g. G3-C4-F4) or &quot;fifth chords&quot;<br/>(e.g. G3-D4-A4), and often considered relatively concordant or even<br/>potentially stable. Likewise the combination of a fifth and fourth<br/>above the lowest tone (e.g. G3-C4-D4) is used as an independent<br/>concord by various 20th-century composers.</p><p>A striking example occurs at the opening of Debussy&apos;s _Et la lune<br/>descend sur le temple qui fut_, which begins with a series of parallel<br/>chords having the fifth and fourth above the bass. Here I would<br/>describe the effect as a spacious and opulent concord.</p><p>However, these sonorities have a rather restricted role in tertian<br/>styles of the Renaissance-Romantic eras, serving mainly as suspensions<br/>or the like.</p><p>It might be interesting to see how different people on this Tuning<br/>List, coming from various stylistic and intonational perspectives,<br/>perceive these sonorities.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=3547 href="#3547">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/1999 12:40:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;It might be interesting to see how different people on this Tuning<br/>&gt;List, coming from various stylistic and intonational perspectives,<br/>&gt;perceive these sonorities.</p><p>As I already mentioned, the principle by which these chain-of-fifths chords<br/>are formed in 3-limit music is the same as that by which major and minor<br/>seventh and ninth chords (also minor elevenths and major ninth sharp<br/>elevenths) are formed in 5-limit music -- notice how the latter are<br/>considered consonant in jazz harmony (partly because they contain no<br/>tritones) which can be considered the dissonant &quot;endgame&quot; of 5-limit music,<br/>much as medieval music using the analogous 3-limit constructs was reaching<br/>an endgame by embracing more and more dissonance in the late 14th and early<br/>15th century.</p><p>The triads by fourths or fifths are comparable to major and minor triads in<br/>dissonance (especially when voiced without close-position major seconds);<br/>the former have two 3-limit intervals and one 9-limit interval while the<br/>latter have one 3-limit interval and two 5-limit intervals. But once the<br/>5-limit was entrenched, superimposed fifth/fourth chords occured only as<br/>suspensions. The 5-limit being the standard of consonance meant that without<br/>5-limit intervals, a chord would sound incomplete, but with 9-limit<br/>intervals, a chord would sound dissonant. So in common-practice harmony,<br/>triads of the type Margo describes have to resolve to triads (or to seventh<br/>chords that then resolve to triads).</p><p>There is an interesting parallel between the Pythagorean thirds, with their<br/>out-of-tune 5-limit implications (I&apos;ll call them quasi-5-limit), becoming<br/>more and more accepted in the late medieval period, and the preponderance of<br/>tritones in jazz, whose 7-limit implications are unavoidable. What (if any)<br/>style will take the 7-limit as the tuning norm and rejects the over-extended<br/>5-limit and quasi-7-limit chords of the jazz style, the way Renaissance<br/>music took 5-limit as the tuning norm and rejected the over-extended 3-limit<br/>and quasi-5-limit chords of the late medieval style? That remains to be<br/>seen, but a possible mechanism for doing so is described by my paper<br/>(<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>). Meanwhile, some jazz<br/>musicians such as McCoy Tyner have often abandoned the 5-limit and<br/>concentrated a good deal on extended 3-limit chords (the ones Margo was<br/>taking about, often with five or six different notes) probably because<br/>12-tET has such good fifths!</p></div>
