Using 1950 as a rough dividing line, I think much of<br/>the music of Charlie Parker, Monk, Duke, Mingus, Gershwin, Miles,<br/>Hendrix, Coltrane, Muddy, Wolf, Albert/BB King, Sabicas, Merle Travis,<br/>Haggard, Willie Nelson, Chuck Berry, Willie Dixon, Paco de Lucia,<br/>McLaughlin, and on and on, is certainly &quot;equal&quot; to the aforementioned<br/>&quot;clasical&quot; artists (although I don&apos;t put the other two B&apos;s in the same<br/>class as Bach, because I don&apos;t put any other western musicians into the<br/>same class as him...but, that&apos;s just an opinion, which there is no way<br/>to defend, nor would I try to). Not to mention the zillions of great<br/>Turkish, Indian, African, South American, and who knows from where else,<br/>musicians that we will never hear of...I still get physical chills from<br/>&quot;Back Door Man,&quot; 31 years after I first heard it...to me, that makes it<br/>great, timeless, and equal to any symphonic work or string quartet ever<br/>written...yucko to such bozos, and I am appalled that those sorts of<br/>folks have been quite prevalent in teaching music to many aspiring<br/>musicians over the years...Hstick</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2000 5:34:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The question was...</p><p>&gt; Yikes...so is there any music after 1950 that compares to the 3 B&apos;s?</p><p>Certainly there are great pieces being written all the time; fifty years isn&apos;t really enough time to have much perspective on what is &quot;lasting&quot; or &quot;great&quot; in any grand sense...</p><p>Anyway, I think probably that any &quot;snoot&quot; who would ask such a question is also implying something about the size of single works... I.e., implying that there are not any great, big, huge sweeping works of lasting importance and gravity and awe-inspiring subtlety within the Western Symphonic tradition being written after 1950...

Sprague &#x3C;jsprague@dhcr.state.ny.us&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2000 1:36:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Of the three great twentieth century &quot;B&apos;s&quot;, Bartok, Busoni and Bliss, only the latter lived into the second half.  However, another &quot;B&quot; wrote a piece that everyone I&apos;ve talked to about it thinks of as a favorite.  Although some academicians might object to it as program music, the soundtrack for the TV series, &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; by Richard Russell Bennett otherwise would seem to fit the bill.  And I don&apos;t mean to simply that popularity implies greatness.  It went to three LP albums, from mono to stereo, to premium quality LP reissue, and that&apos;s just in the original.  A number of other excerpt compilations have been done by different groups, including one I have on an eight-track cartridge along with Robert Maxwell&apos;s &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; played by Frank Chacksfield&apos;s group.  I suspect that a lot of people (not including myself) have bought the entire series on video just to have every last measure of the music.  That&apos;s twenty-six episodes, or thirteen hours (less beginning and ending repeats and commercial breaks).  There is also a film condensation.</p></div><h3>jan gyn &#x3C;jgyn@muse.sfusd.k12.ca.us&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2000 1:34:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>After 1950?
