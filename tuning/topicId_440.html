Any time we have a scale, where notes are mathematically<br/>altered from their real place in the harmonic series or the spiral of<br/>5ths, to fit in the compass of an octave, this is NOT the true sound of<br/>said notes...no, they are REALLY up there somewhere, beyond the range of<br/>our hearing...thus, these scales are not real, they are mathematical<br/>alterations of reality...perhaps we could say that we are sort of<br/>&quot;tempering&quot; the harmonic series/spiral of 5ths. I find it fascinating<br/>that this is the accepted way of doing things...actually, we have no<br/>choice if we want any sort of scalar language at all. I also find it<br/>fascinating that we were given these tools of music (harmonic series,<br/>etc) but actually cannot hear very much of it at all...it&apos;s all based on<br/>theories. If we really heard the pitches where they existed, music would<br/>be a much different phenomenon..perhaps there are beings who can hear<br/>way up in the series. Thus, it seems to me that a so called &quot;just<br/>intonated&quot; scale is no more &quot;real,&quot; in a fundamental sense, than an<br/>&quot;equal tempered&quot; scale...both are only approximations of<br/>reality...neither one is the &quot;true&quot; sound of the actual pitch.<br/>    I have also been messing around with my fretless guitar, and have<br/>come up with a neat tuning of the 6 strings (from the bottom up):<br/>1/1,5/4,3/2,7/4,35/32,.21/16. I have written a piece which involves<br/>using the harmonics of the strings as melodic units...it will be on a<br/>forthcoming CD. Of course, when I say 35/32, it is NOT the actual pitch<br/>of the note...it is an approximation, and as such, it bugs me to call it<br/>what it is not...I don&apos;t know what the answer is.<br/>    Another related point...just how high up have theorists gone with<br/>the harmonic series? The 1000&apos;s...the 1,000,000&apos;s?  I imagine the<br/>interval between the 1,000,000th and the 1,000,001 harmonic is pretty<br/>teensy...could we &quot;bring it down&quot; mathematically and use it in a scale?<br/>It obviously is a real interval, if a bit teensy. What would music be<br/>like if we had access to these sorts of intervallic units? Maybe we just<br/>need more ear hairs...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=444 href="#444">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/1999 2:58:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 01/24/1999 2:29:29 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:stick@uswest.net">stick@uswest.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;  From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:stick@uswest.net">stick@uswest.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also find it<br/>&gt;  fascinating that we were given these tools of music (harmonic series,</p><p>&gt;  etc) but actually cannot hear very much of it at all...it&apos;s all based<br/>on<br/>&gt;  theories.</p><p>Except that harmonics on a string are very real.

From a strictly melodic perspective, there&apos;s a<br/>definite appeal to having all step sizes tempered to be the same.  There is<br/>appeal in them not being equal too, granted, but one might argue that that<br/>calls attention to the intervals themselves, and can distract attention<br/>from the musical statement of the melody itself.</p></div><h3><a id=480 href="#480">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/1999 3:41:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Any time we have a scale, where notes are mathematically<br/>&gt; altered from their real place in the harmonic series or the spiral of<br/>&gt; 5ths, to fit in the compass of an octave, this is NOT the true sound of<br/>&gt; said notes...</p><p>With due respect to Ivor Darreg and Gary Morrison, I think that Mr.<br/>Haverstick is having a bit of reverie about the problem of distinguishing<br/>between the real and what may be called the &apos;really real&apos;, the world of<br/>platonic ideals.</p><p>While my own orientation is more constructivist, a Platonic orientation<br/>towards musical intervals is attractive for many reasons. This view would<br/>hold that our own world of musical intervals is but a reflection of a world<br/>of ideal intervals. The ear and the cognitive apparatus are then<br/>intermediate to these two worlds and our tolerance for approximations, i.e.<br/>temperaments, is a central, not a peripheral, cognitive function.</p><p>But I think that Haverstick is missing the point of the Platonic<br/>orientation, which is not to discount the sensual, physical world for its<br/>approximateness, or &apos;alteration&apos;, but rather to enhance our understanding<br/>of this. An ascending c to d with the frequency ratio of 9:8, for example,<br/>does indeed relate to two steps up a chain of fifths with octave reduction<br/>or to the interval between the 8th and 9th partials in a harmonic series as<br/>well as to an infinite number of alternative descriptions, but these<br/>&apos;truths&apos; are entirely compatible with one another and by no means detract<br/>from the &apos;true sound of said&apos; physical notes.</p></div>
