That&apos;s been my point, and Monzo&apos;s all along...<br/>&gt;  So there should be no reason to have two different notations for the<br/>&gt;  SAME pitch... two notations should only &quot;prescribe&quot; two DIFFERENT<br/>&gt;  pitches...</p><p>I disagree with you most confidently.  It must be the tonality in my<br/>microtonality.</p><p>&gt;  But, more easily than the 72-tET school??  Have you TRIED 72-tET with<br/>&gt;  your players?  I would hesitate to think that they would be teaching<br/>&gt;  this system at the New England Conservatory if it were entirely<br/>&gt;  without merit.</p><p>1200 is more accurate than 72.

My feeling is that perhaps you just need to have a<br/>different notational system for your music than I do for mine.  That<br/>is no problem.  It is fortunate we are still in an &quot;exploratory&quot;stage<br/>for this kind of stuff and are not &quot;locked&quot; into a system of notation<br/>as it has been for probably 100 years with 12-tET!</p><p>Best</p><p>_________ _____ __ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
