Hoene<br/>Wronski, physicist, chemist, musicologist, and philosopher of the<br/>first part of the 19th century, defined music as &quot;the corporealization<br/>of the intelligence that is in sounds.&quot; Looking back, it seems to me<br/>that it was this definition which started me thinking of music as<br/>organized sound instead of sanctified and regimented notes. I began to<br/>resent the arbitrary limitations of the tempered system, especially<br/>after reading at about the same time, Helmholtz&apos;s description of his<br/>experiments with sirens in his Physiology of Sound. Wanting to<br/>experiment myself, I went to the Marche aux Puces, where for next to<br/>nothing you could find just about anything, and picked up two small<br/>ones [Ed: sirens]. With these I made my first experiments in what<br/>later I called spatial music. The beautiful parabolas and hyperbolas<br/>of sound the sirens gave me and the haunting quality of the tones made<br/>me aware for the first time of the wealth of music outside the narrow<br/>limits imposed by keyboard instruments.&quot;</p><p>- Edgard Varese (from p. 42 of &quot;Varese: A looking-glass diary&quot; by<br/>Louise Varese)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=63951 href="#63951">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2006 10:16:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [quote from Edgard Varese:]<br/>&gt; &quot;...
