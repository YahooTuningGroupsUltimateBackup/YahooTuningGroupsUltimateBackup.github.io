Anyway the point of this post was to follow up on an<br/>earlier thread relating CS scales to periodicity blocks. I claimed that all<br/>reasonable periodicity blocks are CS; it may also be that all CS scales of<br/>the type Wilson was interested in are periodicity blocks. In other words,<br/>the two concepts may prove equivalent; though certain properties have so far<br/>appeared more obvious in the context of one derivation or the other,<br/>uncovering an equivalence would be a sort of &quot;unificiation&quot; and hence a<br/>great boon for understanding and creating many such scales.</p></div>
