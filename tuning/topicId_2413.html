I independently came to the same<br/>approach in my paper (<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>, pp.<br/>29-31), where I show a tetrahedral lattice as it would appear if rotated 1<br/>degree from the plane of projection (mentioned on p. 21), resulting in<br/>slightly distorted angles and clearer 3-d visualization. Giving the<br/>different vectors radically different lengths was the topic of recent<br/>discussions here between Paul H., Carl, and me. The reason Graham, Dave,<br/>Carl, Paul H. and I don&apos;t do these things when we draw lattices here is<br/>simple: ASCII. As for melodic information, Canright&apos;s approach can work with<br/>either of our methods to show interval sizes.</p><p>&gt; Who knows? - maybe those unusual lattices<br/>&gt;John Chalmers made recently fit together like Mandelbrot<br/>&gt;pieces. Maybe Mandelbrot shapes are the ones that<br/>&gt;ultimately graph music the best.</p><p>What are Mandelbrot pieces and Mandelbrot shapes? Mandelbrot is the fractal<br/>guy -- maybe youre thinking of Penrose? In that case, Chalmers&apos; lattices are<br/>not going to do it, but Erv Wilson has already created pitch systems based<br/>on Penrose tilings in his approach.</p></div>
