As a kid, I always read Bloomfield&apos;s<br/>writings with great interest...he was extremely articulate, and was<br/>conversant with a wide range of musical subjects, including<br/>microtonality...in fact, I think he was the first rock/pop musician I<br/>ever saw mention microtones. He also played quite microtonally in his<br/>solo in the tune &quot;East-West,&quot; on the Butterfield album of the same name.<br/>He hung out with a lot of colorful characters, and his recollections<br/>here of a 4th of July weekend in East St. Louis with Big Joe Williams<br/>(who wrote &quot;Baby Please Don&apos;t Go&quot;) are worth a few yuks, I think...here<br/>goes...</p><p>    &quot;I woke up on a bed the next morning to find Joe standing over me.<br/>He had stayed up all night drinking and he was more than drunk...he was<br/>on a bender. His nostrils were flared and his eyes were red and runny. A<br/>barbeque fork was in his hand and on it was a pig nose, and hot grease<br/>from the nose was dripping on my chest. He opened his mouth and his<br/>schnapps breath hit me in a wave. &quot;Snoots, snoots,&quot; he shouted, &quot;I<br/>promised you fine barbeque and snoots is what we got!&quot; My head was<br/>throbbing and my stomach still queasy, and when I looked up and saw this<br/>horribly fat and greasy pig nose an inch from my face, I lurched out of<br/>bed and threw up again. Joe began to curse me; &quot;Man, you done puked all<br/>the damn night and into the mornin&apos;, and now you pukin up again! Can&apos;t<br/>you hold that stomach down?!&quot; And I slunk out the house with George, who<br/>wasn&apos;t on top of the world himself, to try to find something to settle<br/>my stomach. Joe stood roaring at us as we left. &quot;Where do you think you<br/>is, you think you home in Chicago now? You ain&apos;t home in Chicago now,<br/>and those niggers out there&apos;ll kill ya!&quot;  But my head and stomach were<br/>already killing me, so I took my chances on the street. And it was the<br/>funkiest street I&apos;d ever seen. I thought I&apos;d seen funk when I&apos;d gone out<br/>to Jazz Gillum&apos;s in Chicago, with the sealed house and blazing<br/>fire...bit this section of St. Louis we were in made Gillum&apos;s shanty<br/>look like a penthouse apartment on Lakeshore Drive...&quot;</p><p>    I got to jam in East St. Louis once... it was/is, indeed, a very<br/>funky place. Happy 4th...Hstick</p></div>
