Maybe such a conference might<br/>also entice some of the tuning crowd to see what&apos;s happening in Australia.<br/>I think you could also count on local support from such different people as<br/>Warren Burt and Stuart Favilla (composer instrument-builders), Judy Bailey<br/>(jazz pianist and composer) and Larry Sitsky (one of our senior composers,<br/>and also performer-musicologist who is extremely knowledgeable on Busoni<br/>and Wyschnegradsky) as well as a dozen or so students at the Con who have<br/>found their way into JI. The Sydney Conservatorium could be cajoled into<br/>hosting something like this as it would provide a great opportunity to show<br/>off the Con&apos;s microzone keyboard when it arrives later this year.</p><p>Greg S</p></div>
