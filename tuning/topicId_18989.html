Actually, the &quot;same city&quot; aspect is<br/>probably not such an issue, although it *is* nice when you visit...</p><p>With e-mail and the Web, it&apos;s the same thing anyway, of course.  In<br/>fact, sometimes it&apos;s BETTER, since one can better compose thoughts in<br/>a written format. It&apos;s incredible how much I have learned in this<br/>last<br/>year!</p><p>I wonder how many people around here really appreciate the service<br/>you have been doing....?</p><p>________ ______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
