So except for the unison/octave, every interval-class<br/>(number of scale-steps) comes in two sizes of interval (frequency ratio).<br/>This colour scheme is the simplest one that ensures that the two sizes in<br/>any given interval class are always coloured differently. Of course the<br/>specific colours don&apos;t particularly matter.</p><p>On a generalised (or Blackjack-specific) keyboard each colour would occupy<br/>a different overlapping row, which would slope gently downwards to the right.</p><p>This is not a replacement for Paul&apos;s chord lists, it&apos;s a complement to<br/>them. Whenever the same keyboard pattern gives the _same_ chord, you will<br/>find it has the _same_ colouring (within a shift along the rainbow).<br/>Whenever the same keyboard pattern gives a _different_ chord, you will find<br/>it has _different_ colouring (not counting shifts along the rainbow).</p><p>Except for one little problem. I (and the above diagrams) don&apos;t agree with<br/>your choice of a C keyboard mapping, which is what Paul&apos;s chord list was<br/>made for. I strongly believe that it will be easier in general, for folks<br/>to find their way around Blackjack, if the central note of a chain is<br/>aligned with the D above middle-C on the keyboard. I don&apos;t know exactly how<br/>you do that with your setup, but it sounds like you might just need to<br/>choose a &quot;map D linear&quot;  or something. Anyway, it should be easy.</p><p>I know this will render a little of what you&apos;ve already learnt obsolete,<br/>but think of the thousands (?) who will come after you, or who might be<br/>performing your Blackjack works on a keyboard. It also relates to<br/>compatibility with a Blackjack guitar (both Graham&apos;s and mine will center<br/>on a D). It&apos;s a fundamental symmetry thing between MIRACLE and meantone.</p><p>If you send me a copy of Paul&apos;s chord list, I&apos;ll redo it for a D mapping.<br/>I&apos;ll also relabel his lattice.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/12/2001 6:46:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24926">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24926</a></p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s an update that should make the reason for the colouring<br/>crystal<br/>&gt; clear.

It only makes sense to ask about the starting point<br/>of a scale that forms a melodic gestalt. There are many of these in<br/>Blackjack, all with different starting points.</p><p>The alignment of a point of symmetry with a point of symmetry is the<br/>only thing available to us that has any musical logic that I can see.</p><p>So no, I don&apos;t agree that all Blackjack-Halberstadt mappings are<br/>created equal. This is not a mathematical argument, but one that<br/>considers the cognitive processes (even unconscious ones) of composers<br/>and performers.</p><p>If there is any advantage to be had from a D-centred mapping, we owe<br/>it to the future to do it now, despite some possible short term<br/>discomfort for those few (2?) who have started using C-centred (or<br/>else it will never happen).</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
