Erlich&quot; &lt;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx<br/>Subject: Re: Query</p><p>&gt;Hello to all,<br/>&gt;I am new to your list and need your assistance.  I am setting up a graduate<br/>&gt;level course for myself, and one of my areas of study will be harmonics and<br/>&gt;alternate tunings.  Can anyone suggest text(s) knowing that I am at the<br/>&gt;beginning?   Thank you very much.</p><p>&gt;Most Sincerely,<br/>&gt;Azrael</p><p>My top recommendation is Helmholtz&apos; _On the Sensations of Tone_, with notes<br/>from the translator, Ellis. If you&apos;re at the graduate level this shouldn&apos;t<br/>be too difficult for you. Just keep in mind when you read it that it&apos;s a<br/>little out of date.</p><p>Partch&apos;s _Genesis of a Music_ is full of alternate tunings, including his<br/>own. Just keep in mind that Partch is not trying to offer a balanced view of<br/>the subject.</p><p>The rest of these overlap very little but taken together give a very wide<br/>view of the subject:</p><p>&quot;Pitch, consonance, and harmony&quot; by Terhardt in _Journal of the Acoustical<br/>Society of America_ Vol. 55 (1974). p. 1061 will give you a more<br/>late-20th-century viewpoint on psychacoustics; if you made it through<br/>Helmholtz and Partch then the ramifications of this should be clear.<br/>For historical tunings, check out Barbour&apos;s _Tuning and Temperament_ or<br/>Jorgenson&apos;s huge tome, _Tuning_;<br/>for diatonic tunings, with both feet planted in history, Blackwood&apos;s<br/>_Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_;<br/>for an extension of historically-based considerations to some new<br/>possibilities, Fokker&apos;s _New Music with 31 Notes_;<br/>for experimental scales, the articles &quot;Harmony and New Scales&quot; by Mathews,<br/>Pierce, and Roberts and &quot;General Properties of Musical Pitch Systems&quot; by<br/>Krumhansl (both in _Harmony and Tonality_ edited by Sundberg), all issues of<br/>_Xenharmonikon_, &quot;Modes and Chord Progressions in Equal Tunings&quot; by<br/>Blackwood in _Perspectives of New Music_ Vol. 29 (1991) No.2 pp. 166-200,<br/>&quot;Six American Composers On Nonstandard Tunings&quot; in _Perspectives of New<br/>Music_ Vol. 29 (1991) No.1, &quot;Tuning: At the Crossroads&quot; by Wendy Carlos in<br/>_Computer Music Journal_<br/>for an experimental idea that strains credibility but is fantastically<br/>presented, Yasser&apos;s _Theory of Evolving Tonality_;<br/>a similar take but in just intonation is &quot;On The Development of Musical<br/>Systems&quot; by Kraehenbuehl and Schmidt in _Journal of Music Theory_ Vol. 6<br/>(1962) no. 1<br/>for relationships between timbre (especially inharmonic timbres) and tuning,<br/>Sethares&apos; _Timbre, Tuning, Spectrum, Scale_;<br/>one engineer&apos;s idiosyncratic take on the same theme: &quot;An Electronically<br/>Generated Complex Microtonal System of Horizontal and Vertical Harmony&quot; by<br/>Goldsmith in _Journal of the Audio Engineering Society_ Vol. 19 (1971) no.<br/>10 pp. 851-858</p><p>for the complete citations see the vast bibliography at<br/>ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/papers/bib.html. Many of us have web pages<br/>with information that goes beyond the above; for example (and with stuff for<br/>beginners), Graham Breed&apos;s page,<br/><a href="http://www.compulink.co.uk/~gbreed/tuning.htm">http://www.compulink.co.uk/~gbreed/tuning.htm</a>.</p></div>
