We have decided to celebrate this event with a series of concerts in the San Francisco Bay Area between mid-April and mid-June of 2005. The proposed performance series (we don&apos;t have a clever name for it yet-your suggestions are welcome) has several goals:</p><p>*&#x9;to present good music in Just Intonation for its own sake<br/>*&#x9;to get recognition for the network in conjunction with its twentieth anniversary<br/>*&#x9;to increase public awareness of Just Intonation<br/>*&#x9;to start building a pool of performers and ensembles that we can call on for future events<br/>*&#x9;to begin an on-going (maybe biannual?) series</p><p>No events have been scheduled as yet, but among the composers and performers who have expressed an interest in participating are Alexis Alrich, David Canright, Ellen Fullman, Kraig Grady, Janis Mattox and Loren Rush (the Good Sound Foundation), Other Music (thirty-year reunion), John Schneider/Just Strings, Robert Rich, Terry Riley, Erling Wold, and your editor. Other network members who are interested in performing in the series are encouraged to submit proposals, with the following caveats: 1. We are working with a limited budget, so we will not be able to pay for your transportation from outside Northern California or your housing while you are here (though local network members may be willing to host some visiting artists). 2. We do not expect to have a house ensemble for this event (though this is a resource that we hope to develop in the future), so submission of scores will not be useful-you must be able to perform your work or make your own arrangements for its performance. Note also that this series is exclusively for music in Just Intonation, rather than for microtonality/alternate tunings in general. However, if you are already in Northern California, expect to be here in April, May, or June of 2005, or are willing to come here at your own expense, and you have justly tuned music to be performed, we would be interested in receiving your proposal. And, of course, we encourage all network members, wherever you may be, to come and attend one or more of the performances.</p><p>Please send your proposals before August 31, 2004 (sooner is better), to the Just Intonation Network, attention: Carola Anderson, 535 Stevenson Street, San Francisco CA 94103. Please include the following information: name, address, phone number, and email address; a brief biography; a description of the piece(s) you would perform, including length, instrumentation, number of performers and any other details you consider relevant; preferred performance dates, technical requirements (e.g., any special equipment required, any special features needed in the performance venue, etc.), and financial requirements. Please include a CD or tape of the piece in question, or, if that is not possible, of a similar recent work in Just Intonation.</p><p>Check the jin website (<a href="http://www.justintonation.net">www.justintonation.net</a>) and subsequent issues of 1/1 for more information about the series as it develops. We look forward to seeing many of you next spring.</p><p>--<br/>==========================================================================</p><p>David B.

We have lost diversity on this list, and<br/>&gt; I think that diminishes the claims of Great Progress.</p><p>Changes of diversity do happen.  Sometimes perhaps for not good reasons.  I<br/>am perhaps so neutral on all of this that I see no problem at all most of<br/>the time.  And in fact I think people should go where they are happy, and do<br/>what they are inspired to do.  My take is that the change that has happenned<br/>here is not because people are bad, but because of how the people here are<br/>currently inspired.</p><p>So if the mix is wrong for some people, they have the choice of not hanging<br/>around, or of offering something else into the mix, to shift the balance.<br/>This is what I think should be done.  If something is offered, and they are<br/>told to stop talking about that, and it is within the charter of the list,<br/>then that is something like oppression.  I really haven&apos;t seen much<br/>oppression here, almost none, in the vast majority of messages.  A barrage<br/>of other topics coming up is a symptom of the shape of inspiration, not a<br/>symptom of oppression.</p><p>I think you see it differently, and I think you have felt criticised, but if<br/>that comes down to particular interpersonal dynamics that is a different<br/>thing from a loss of topical diversity, something much more particular.  I&apos;d<br/>have to look back really carefully over a lot of messages to understand this<br/>better, and I don&apos;t have the time to do that, although it would probably be<br/>interesting to see where things really went awry.  Lacking that<br/>investigation my overriding bias confirmed by pretty much *every* experience<br/>of conflict I haver ever been personally involved in, is that no single<br/>&quot;side&quot; is every the sold cause, and I would think you are in error to leave<br/>thinking that there is a fault that lies primarily outside of yourself.  I<br/>know you acknowledge that you have weaknesses yet I don&apos;t think you realize<br/>what you may do to help (as part of a team, so to speak) to create the<br/>appearances out there that end up becoming objects of your criticism.</p><p>I think there is no intention to subvert diversity here, I see absolutely no<br/>sign of it, but there are as usual patterns operating, and most of those<br/>patterns don&apos;t get recognized, and meanwhile everyone is more interested in<br/>their inspirations, and so perhaps some mistakes happen that are later<br/>causes for regret.</p><p>For myself I want to hear about it all, I only understand a fraction of it<br/>but I get glimmers of inspiration from a larger fraction that I don&apos;t yet<br/>understand.  I want to learn more.  I think the math is an important part of<br/>the offering.  I think experiential and intuitive ways of integrating the<br/>abilities to deal with alternate tunings into the musical culture are<br/>missing.  I want to deal with what is missing by offering what I have to<br/>offer, at my own pace as it comes to me to do that.</p><p>If the truth be told I feel gifted in a lot of ways that I don&apos;t see other<br/>people gifted, yet fortunately it doesn&apos;t bother me much that other people&apos;s<br/>gifts are different.  If it did it would drive me absolutely nuts.  I *am*<br/>inspired therefore to want to offer things, and the pace of that is terribly<br/>slow.  What makes it work is the conscious engagement, the way understanding<br/>deepens within me evern when the time to express has not yet come.<br/>Meanwhile the aspects of relationship with others that *are* more active at<br/>any given time are what make the whole thing clearly worthwhile.</p><p>Advice:  You need to have plenty of active relationship with people who are<br/>*not* quite of like mind with you so that you can see process happening and<br/>can experience the rewards of it.  If you do not have this you will be happy<br/>with some people and unhappy with others, and you will divide the world in<br/>two.  Yet we all have our limits.  I am not so inspired that I hang around<br/>with political assasins, for example, in order to deepen my understanding of<br/>the potential for communication to change the world.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A fairly novel and exciting type of<br/>&gt;&gt; music theory has seen its genesis on this list and if<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;JI vs. ET&quot; bothers you, you have failed to understand it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have not only not failed to understand it, my most recent tuning is<br/>&gt; a combination of JI-derived intervals mixed with other intervals. Not<br/>&gt; *the* middle path, but another path (please, _no_ big claim here, just<br/>&gt; an alternate hiking trail). I do pay attention, and I grab a few<br/>&gt; scattered pages out of the maelstrom. It isn&apos;t what gives me a stiffy,<br/>&gt; however.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize that my voice in this is pretty futile, and I might as well<br/>&gt; shut up and go away also. As long as you guys think everything is just<br/>&gt; fine, it will be.</p><p>I think you could be clearer than you have about what you would like to see<br/>*added* here.  You want something opened up.  You want to be free of<br/>something you feel as a restriction.  I assert that you are not restricted,<br/>that I see no sign you have been restricted here.  That someone else on this<br/>list responds a certain way to you does not restrict you.
