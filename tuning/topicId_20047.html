I do want to say a word or two about<br/>composition, as I&apos;ve really been heading into new territory the last few<br/>months (on fretless and 31 eq), and creating some quite new (for me)<br/>music. First, the fretless piece...I tuned the guitar to various<br/>harmonics, so the usual, guitaristic patterns that I usually deal with,<br/>were not there anymore...in fact, intellectually, it took me a while to<br/>even understand the tuning...I just liked the SOUND of it (now I KNOW<br/>what it is). But, at first, I was going entirely by ear...which I have<br/>done most of my life.<br/>    Then, a small pattern, made of 3 harmonics, somehow appeared as I<br/>was putzing around, then a little 2 note shape, but that was about it<br/>for almost a year. Then, in the fall of 2000, all of a sudden one day,<br/>as I sat down to putz some more, a virtual flood of ideas, melodies, and<br/>patterns showed up, one after the other, for several days in a row...I<br/>mean, riff after riff, variation after variation...I was able to get a<br/>10 minute piece together for Microstock 6, and the ideas were still<br/>pouring out...I had to edit them down to get the piece together. In<br/>fact, to this day, everytime I work on this piece, ideas are STILL<br/>flooding through this body.<br/>    The point, for me, is this...&quot;I&quot; did not &quot;think&quot; of 99% of these<br/>melodies/riffs; I found my hands literally playing them, somehow, while<br/>&quot;I&quot; watched...THEN, later, I would go back and intellectually figure out<br/>the names of the notes, etc...in fact, I still do not know the scales I<br/>am playing in this piece...and, I really don&apos;t care. But, it is<br/>cohesive, has a good shape, and I consider it one of my better<br/>compositions. (Oh yeah, it also evokes really deep/profound feelings and<br/>images for me as well...that&apos;s how I ultimately judge my work...).<br/>    As far as I am concerned, I did not write this piece...somehow,<br/>ideas came to me from somewhere, and my hands &quot;did&quot; it...so, where was<br/>I, where is this place, and what does it have to do with<br/>theory/intellect? After 35 years of playing, I&apos;m not exactly sure, nor<br/>do I really care...al I know is, creativity, for me, seems to reside<br/>somewhere in the Universe, and once I &quot;get&quot; to that place, I&apos;ve hit the<br/>big number, and &quot;I&quot;, as a composer, can create a new piece.<br/>    Same thing happened last week with 31...I was sitting, putzing<br/>around, when my hands started playing a riff...I said, &quot;that&apos;s it!,&quot; and<br/>THEN stopped to count out the rhythms, and &quot;learn&quot; what I was already<br/>doing. Again, I did not think of this riff beforehand...somehow, it<br/>appeared while I was playing. Now, I CAN use my intellectually learned<br/>concepts of variation, etc., to expand on it...but, the initial idea had<br/>nothing to do with that part of me which I think of as my intellect.<br/>And, knowing me, I won&apos;t be using the intellectual side much to expand<br/>on it, either.<br/>    In fact, when I look back at all of the tunes I&apos;ve written (which is<br/>a lot), I cannot remember EVER using the  intellectual part of myself to<br/>compose them...it seems like all of a sudden, there&apos;s a piece, and I<br/>cannot remember how it got there. Yet, I&apos;ve studied and practiced a lot<br/>over the years, so I know that process certainly aids in the final<br/>result. Yet, I don&apos;t seem to use it in the actual process of composing;<br/>at least, not consciously.<br/>   And, this is not a new story, for sure...many artists have remarked<br/>that, at their best, the music seems to be coming through them, from<br/>somewhere else, and that &quot;thinking&quot; stops it. Joe Pass often talked<br/>about that, as well as many others, and I agree, for my part.<br/>    Composition is a rather mystical event, for me, and I am certainly<br/>curious as to how others compose, as well. Many people have remarked how<br/>all ideas already exist, and we, as artists, just go get them, somehow,<br/>from somewhere. Maybe so...these things are not only hard to prove,<br/>they&apos;re impossible to prove...and, that&apos;s why I like being an artist so<br/>much. I enjoy the realms of the unknowable, and feel most comfortable<br/>there...Hstick</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/10/2001 9:45:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20047">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20047</a></p><p>Thank you, Neil Haverstick, for your interesting composition post.  I<br/>*love* composition posts, that is, unless the &quot;exchangers&quot; get so<br/>personally tied up in things that they refuse to post anymore! :)</p><p>There is an interesting painting from the 7th Century AD which shows<br/>St. Gregory (of Gregorian Chant fame!) taking down his chants from a<br/>little white bird that is perched on his shoulder.  (Fortunately, the<br/>bird was &quot;minding its manners&quot; so to speak)</p><p>This little bird, a not too subtle reference to the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; did<br/>all the composing for St. Gregory.  These chants were quickly<br/>dictated, then, to Gregory&apos;s &quot;scribe.&quot;</p><p>Are you sure this is not what&apos;s happening to you??  :)</p><p>Seriously, though, I would say that you probably do LOTS more<br/>&quot;pre-compositional&quot; work than you think.  There is all the extensive<br/>&quot;improvising&quot; that you do... there is all the thinking about tunings<br/>and the &quot;putzing&quot; (from the Yiddish) that goes on.</p><p>Although I have no background in psychology, I would venture that,<br/>possibly, you do most of your composing in your SLEEP.</p><p>I&apos;m serious.  There is a lot of &quot;pre-compositional&quot; stuff going on in<br/>your subconscious that combines with all your earlier experiences and<br/>then SUDDENLY (to YOU, maybe, but not to your subconscious) appears.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to get too O.T., but, thinking about things<br/>&quot;scientifically&quot; in a Dave Keenan way, it really is AMAZING how much<br/>we &quot;know&quot; that we DON&apos;T &quot;know.&quot;</p><p>In other words, your body knows how to do much.  It&apos;s moving atoms<br/>around, fighting disease, etc., etc.</p><p>We *DO* this, we *KNOW* this... but just not consciously...</p><p>Therefore, is the &quot;conscious&quot; mind basically just a little mirage, a<br/>tiny, partial reflection of the &quot;real&quot; reality??....  It&apos;s all we<br/>really &quot;need&quot; to know in order to function... but the TRUE person,<br/>and the TRUE universe is ENTIRELY beyond our grasp.</p><p>We don&apos;t NEED to know it consciously for our survival and, thereby,<br/>don&apos;t even have the TOOLS to know it...</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m beginning to believe.

I&apos;ve done this with a 22 tet guitar, then I<br/>record long structured inprovisations to DAT and score them out, composing as I go. What comes out<br/>sounds totally fresh, at least to my ears. The hard bit is the &apos;fixing&apos; of the finished article.<br/>The improvisations are so enjoyable. But when you&apos;ve emptied yourself of all the desires to sound<br/>like somebody else, you really can find your own voice, and that really is the best offering you<br/>can make.</p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2001 3:46:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally think composers should try to learn to PLAY as many<br/>&gt; instruments as possible, and get them right in their HANDS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Now more than ever, music should be written directly on the<br/>&gt;&gt; instruments that will play them.</p><p>&gt;  From: &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:STICK@USWEST.NET">STICK@USWEST.NET</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I find this process fascinating..I do, indeed, feel, at times, like<br/>&gt; someone on the other side of this life, is showing me ideas/concepts,<br/>&gt; and guiding me do do the things I do.</p><p>I have to agree with Joseph, Kraig and Neil. While I am quite glad that I<br/>studied enough theory and ear training so as to be able to compose with<br/>nothing but paper and pencil (and especially an eraser), and have used this<br/>method where it seemed the right way to compose particular pieces of music,<br/>for the most part I prefer the hands on an instrument approach to music<br/>composition. I think the guitar lends itself particularily well to this<br/>method. The best compositions for guitar do tend to be written by players,<br/>or by composers working very closely with a players&apos; input.</p><p>Years ago, I found that my best compositional ideas happened by trying to<br/>play on instruments that I didn&apos;t know how to play. So I&apos;d buy old funky<br/>instruments and improvise on them to come up with new ideas that I&apos;d bring<br/>back to my primary instrument which was, at that time, the acoustic steel<br/>string guitar. The end result some 25 years later is that I can play a<br/>number of other instruments well, and am constantly learning to play others.<br/>To this day, I gain great insight into pieces I&apos;m working on a given<br/>instrument by playing them on other instruments.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p><p>&quot;Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it&apos;s time to pause<br/>and reflect.&quot;<br/>-Mark Twain</p></div><h3>Steven Kallstrom &#x3C;skallstr@sun.iwu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2001 11:36:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey,</p><p>&#x9;As a composition student, who must finish many works, and assignments... I<br/>feel that much of my inspiration comes from working with raw material, pitch<br/>sets, scales, tone-rows, interval cycles, or patterns.  I have a book of<br/>randomly generated tone rows that I improvise on and &apos;dig into&apos; to get<br/>musical ideas.  I have generated some of my best works through these<br/>means...  I am usually working on three or more works at a time that are<br/>vastly different in technique and style.  I am very into &apos;algorithmic<br/>compositions&apos; and cannons, pieces in which the whole music is designed or<br/>engineered, and the resulting work is just a working out of a process.  This<br/>stems from my love for Ligeti, and Xenakis, and my fondness for<br/>&apos;hyper-strict structures&apos;.  I am at the same time usually writing a piece of<br/>serial music, where I use loose serial rules, and free atonality at the same<br/>time.  My other style is usually more naturally born from inspiration or<br/>improvisation...  and these usually consist of writing a few melodies,<br/>motivic ideas, and generating harmonies, but never is the whole piece born<br/>in an instance, and I will always impose my theoretical know-how&apos;s to the<br/>&apos;naturally&apos; developed material.  My compositions that I hate the most though<br/>are the works that I applied little theoretical know-how to, and just wrote<br/>what my &apos;ear told me to&apos;.  So, either this means that I have a bad ear, or<br/>am a bad composer.  I think that all great composers truly combine elements<br/>of theory and intuition in their works...  many composers though have theory<br/>embedded in their intuition, or have a unique theory of their own.  For me,<br/>composition that simply writes what the ear states, is simply written<br/>improvisation...  I believe that most composer are intuitive, but use theory<br/>own theoretical conceptions to mold their materials into a structured<br/>composition.</p><p>&#x9;Here&apos;s a little side track.  This is why I like set-theory, it is the only<br/>universal theoretical language.  The application of set-theory to the study<br/>of Schoenberg and his disciple&apos;s atonal music is known... but set-theory can<br/>reveal all relationships between all pitches in any temperament.  Set-theory<br/>to me is not a mathematical machine, but a very powerful tool that examines<br/>a composer&apos;s material and what can be done with it.  Set-theory is almost<br/>like a programming language for music theory and analysis, it is so<br/>fundamental and the rules are so general that they can be applied to all<br/>music tonal, atonal, modal regardless of atonality.  I use set-theory in all<br/>of my compositions, but I doubt that any theorist could ever find out how,<br/>especially in my impressionistic and tonal works.</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div>
