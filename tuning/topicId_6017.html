For illustrative purposes, I&apos;ll use a small prime limit JI, starting<br/>&gt;&gt;in C.  If I play a C major chord, the E is played about 14 cents lower than<br/>&gt;&gt;12TET.  If I move to a E major (using non-diatonic note for the 3rd (I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;know if non-diatonic is the right word in this case)), holding the E, does<br/>&gt;&gt;one usually (i) keep the E at that position and adjust each of the other<br/>&gt;&gt;notes accordingly so their intervals are identical to the original C major<br/>&gt;&gt;chord, or (ii) shift the E down slightly and keep the intervals the same so<br/>&gt;&gt;that there is less &quot;drift&quot; over time, or (iii) use the intervals for the E<br/>&gt;&gt;major that are implied by the original.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am unclear as to what exactly these alternatives mean. Can you please<br/>&gt;give some ratios, etc. to clarify?</p><p>Sorry, I could have explained this more clearly.  Since I&apos;m using borrowed<br/>chords I want a 12 tone scale built by some combination of JI major and<br/>minor scales.  The only notes relevant in the above example are:</p><p>C       E       G       Ab      B            with intervals from C of<br/>1       5/4     3/2     8/5     15/8</p><p>Case:<br/>(i) play E major so it has 1 5/4 3/2 ratios, then Ab is played as 25/16 =<br/>1.56 of C instead of the &quot;original&quot; ratio of 8/5 = 1.6 of C</p><p>(ii) play E major with 1 5/4 3/2 ratios, but shift E down slightly so that<br/>none of E Ab or B are played as 5/4, 8/5 and 15/8 of C respectively, but a<br/>centered shift is done (like John A. deLaubenfels example in following<br/>replies to my question - that&apos;s how I know what it&apos;s called :)).</p><p>(iii)  Play E major using the 5/4, 8/5 and 15/8 of C (the original pitches),<br/>so the major third is no longer 5/4 but is 32/25 = 1.28</p><p><a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;And what if two notes are held from a previous chord.  If they form a<br/>&gt;&gt;different interval in the two chords, which is almost always the case, one<br/>&gt;&gt;or both have to shift.  Any recommendations?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Again, please give some specific examples.</p><p>Continue the progression given above (Cmaj - Emaj) to Abmin, so Ab and B are<br/>held.  If Abmin is to have ratios of 1 6/5 3/2, one has to play B at 48/25<br/>=1.92 of C instead of the original 15/8, or shift both Ab and B (maybe using<br/>again John&apos;s centered shift).</p><p><a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;My prejudice:  for maximum harmony, I was intending on playing each new<br/>&gt;&gt;chord as if the root of that chord is the 1 of the JI scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That doesn&apos;t work so well for certain chords. For example, a C6/9 chord<br/>&gt;(C E G A D) would have the fifth between A and D as 40:27 if you tuned it<br/>&gt;according to &quot;the JI major scale&quot; on C</p><p>Do you mean the 4th of 27/20 = 1.35 between A and D?    For 9, 11, 13<br/>chords, etc., does the dominant harmonies come from the upper note<br/>intervals, or from the correspondence with the root harmonics?</p><p>One can take this further and ask about playing one unrelated chord over<br/>another, as seems to be commonly done in 12Tet nowadays in some genres.  At<br/>some point JI becomes irrelevant as the chord &quot;non-harmonicity&quot; (there&apos;s got<br/>to be a better word, but I&apos;m meaning in the sense the chord is written so I<br/>don&apos;t want to use dissonance, which seems to me specific to when it&apos;s played<br/>in a given tuning).  At least this seems to be my interpretation of Arthur<br/>Benade&apos;s sentiment.</p><p>There&apos;s a continuom from the simple triad to a Cmaj13 over a Abm7add11 where<br/>the reasons for, and therefore the tuning used, change IMHO.  I don&apos;t know<br/>much about this area - I tend to go for the simple harmonies.</p><p><a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;approximation of a small prime limit JI subset of a large note scale (like<br/>&gt;&gt;53 circle of primes or something).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Circle of primes? You mean circle of fifths?</p><p>oops, yes.  I need a brain change.  :)</p><p><a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps such melodic intervals are the appropriate interval to be used for<br/>&gt;&gt;chord changes and modulation if the root or 1 position is not held from a<br/>&gt;&gt;previous chord?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The only melodic intervals that really have any &quot;pull&quot; as to tuning are<br/>&gt;the octave, fourth, and fifth, as well as whetever intervals are familiar<br/>due to<br/>&gt;context and/or culture. Depending on the particular example of what you are<br/>&gt;describing (care to provide an example?), melodic considerations may or may not<br/>&gt;be able to determine the &quot;correct&quot; interval for such changes.</p><p>I find that Ab F C Eb  (descend from Ab, rise to Eb) depends quite a bit on<br/>the minor third intervals.  Played high on the keyboard, it sounds awful to<br/>me in 12Tet, and takes on a different feel depending on the minor third<br/>intervals played.</p><p>Thanks to you, John deLaubenfels and all that have or will provide me with<br/>more info.  It is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Jim Savage</p></div>
