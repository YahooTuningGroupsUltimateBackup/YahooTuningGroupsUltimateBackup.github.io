At the beginning of the 21st century, that is the indispensible mission of art.&quot; I really believe that art can be a great healing force in the world, and at the deepest level, I, as a musician, hope to be a small part of that healing. And, one of the reasons I enjoy the study of tunings so much is to look for ways to make better and more profound music.<br/>   So, I want to say to the folks on this list, the very best in 2007 and beyond. I am very grateful for everyone here, no matter our disagreements...I feel that, at least, we&apos;re all trying to move the beautiful art of music into new places, and that means a lot to me. So whether you&apos;re a math guy/girl, theorist, practicing musician, or some combination thereof, you are much appreciated...hoping we have many more years of learning, squabbling, humor, and insights into what makes music tick...best from Denver...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div><h3>Can Akkoc &#x3C;can193849@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2006 1:46:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>  I could&apos;nt agree more with the phrase **. . . a dialogue between souls.** in your quote.
