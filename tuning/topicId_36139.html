I&apos;m sure the offer will still<br/>stand in a year or whenever, if we *have* to get out of Yahoo.</p><p>HOWEVER, that&apos;s just re: the e-mail list.</p><p>The permanent MP3 repository idea I had WILL go forward, I don&apos;t think<br/>anyone&apos;s going to complain about that.  There will be an HTML page from<br/>which MP3&apos;s (or MIDIs, or JPGs, or whatever) can be downloaded.  You will<br/>have to e-mail files to me to put up (we can&apos;t do an anonymous ftp or<br/>anything spiffy like that, sadly, according to the sysadmin.)  Once<br/>they&apos;re up, they won&apos;t have to come down, ever (unless some wierd<br/>University thang happens. . . )  And we&apos;ve got (more or less) unlimited<br/>space!!</p><p>(I do have limited time, however, so I&apos;m going to ask folks to limit<br/>submissions to new pieces, that aren&apos;t up elsewhere; and that they have<br/>some relevance to tuning . . . .)</p><p>If anyone would like to make some boilerplate HTML code for that page, and<br/>send it to me, that would be cool.  Otherwise I&apos;ll just set up something<br/>suitably wimpy.</p><p>I was thinking of organizing the page, rather than alphabetically by<br/>composer or some such, instead, categorized by tuning type.  This would<br/>help make the page a nice pedagogical info-source, i.e., ya wanna hear<br/>something in BlackJack, well, go to the BlackJack section.</p><p>let me know your thoughts. . . I&apos;ll set stuff up over the weekend, I hope.</p><p>cb</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2002 1:36:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Folks,<br/>&gt; &#x9;Looks to me like, since<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1)&#x9;not everyone wants to move,<br/>&gt; 2)&#x9;It&apos;s not TOTALLY urgent,<br/>&gt; 3)&#x9;I have other things to do in my life,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;We&apos;ll wait on getting off of Yahoo.
