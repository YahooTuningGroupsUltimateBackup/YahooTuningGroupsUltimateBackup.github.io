However , it is still based on a<br/>12 note octave so it unable to create a 19 note or 31 note octave. It also has<br/>facility to create and store as many other tunings as you desire.</p><p>Anyway , I would like your learned opinions on the pre-programmed tunings<br/>as whether they are accurate. I think some of the 18 tunings are speculations<br/>with no great musical application , but some entitled  JUST , and 1/4 COMMA,<br/>and WERKMEISTER might be accurate  and I would like to know if these tunings are actually<br/>true to their names.</p><p>If you think that adjustments are needed please let me know.</p><p>So here they are.

I hear a lot of talk about how a new scale<br/>&gt;is superior to 12et and reduces pain across the board or makes a great<br/>&gt;picture but in reality you&apos;re just wasting time.  The truth of the matter<br/>is<br/>&gt;if you&apos;re going to limit yourself to a fixed tuning in the age of  the<br/>&gt;integrated circuit then your&apos;e going to be way behind in your tonal<br/>&gt;vocabulary when that age gives way to processors that blow the IC away.<br/>When<br/>&gt;the new age dawns it will strip old rules from their foundations and music<br/>&gt;will have to be explored from the ground up on a composer by composer<br/>basis.<br/>&gt;The only &quot;rule&quot; that will apply will be the one that started it all --  If<br/>it<br/>&gt;sounds good, It is good.<br/>&gt;    As for all of you who bag &quot;computer music&quot; your complaints are valid at<br/>&gt;this point in time, but what are you going to be saying in 10 years?<br/>You&apos;re<br/>&gt;going to be kicking yourself for not learning everything you could have<br/>about<br/>&gt;it.  The computer is the most powerful tool on the planet.  When recording<br/>&gt;was invented composers were given a &quot;canvas&quot; to work with a kind of stone<br/>to<br/>&gt;be carved.  The computer will let us do that with ease.<br/>&gt;    And for those of you who prefer live performance over &quot;dead&quot; - you<br/>should<br/>&gt;wake up, too.  If you&apos;re going to achieve higher art, you&apos;re going to have<br/>to<br/>&gt;sculpt it just like you heard it.

Especially for the Scarlatti, where you<br/>&gt;&gt;essentially got meantone, all the melodic whole tones would be about<br/>&gt;&gt;equal -- thus a high degree of melodic smoothness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How big is your wallet, Paul?  ;-&gt;  Actually, at the moment, I&apos;m trying<br/>&gt;to recall which piece seemed to whap me in the face with this.  I&apos;ll get<br/>&gt;back to you when possible; you can keep the contents of your wallet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;So, for example, a 7-limit otonal tuning file would start by<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;specifying that C is unchanged from 12-tET, E is about -14 cents from<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;12-tET, G is about +2 cents from 12-tET, and Bb is about -31 cents<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;from 12-tET (the program will separately &quot;center&quot; the deviations given<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;it).  In order to capture minor chords, the file tunes A at about -16<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;cents from 12-tET.  I think I also tune Eb at +16, allowing a good<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;C,Eb,G as well as A,C,E; they will give the same tuning results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The program understands that each tuning file can be applied in 12<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;uhh . . . right . . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What&apos;s with the &quot;uhh&quot;?  This seems so intuitive to me; how am I failing<br/>&gt;to convey the idea(s) here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;To steer a given set of notes into a particular tuning vs. another,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the tuning file rates each of the 66 intervals it forms; thus the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;above file would rate the 386 cent interval from C to E as very<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;desirable, etc.  The backside major third, from E to G#, is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;approximately 428 cents and is given very low desirability.  The 7:9<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;third from Bb to D, approx 435 cents, is given fairly high<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;desirability so that a dom 7 will align to it, but not so high that a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;bare major third sticks to it instead of to 5:4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(I meant dom 9, not dom 7)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The numbers I use for interval desirability are completely seat of the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;pants; when the program makes a bad choice, often the problem can be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;fixed by changing interval desirability in one or more tuning files to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;steer the tuning some other way than it was going.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not sure you explained what interval desirability does. Does the<br/>&gt;&gt;program determine which tuning file maximizes the desirability at each<br/>&gt;&gt;moment of the piece, and use that tuning file?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes.  By summing the weighted &quot;goodness&quot; of all the dyadic intervals,<br/>&gt;much as your dyadic harmonic entropy calculations do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;And what about your recent development to allow the intervallic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;springs to compete with one another in the case of a stack-of-fifths<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;chord, etc.? Does that do away with tuning files?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Partially; it jumps in ONLY when the previous logic has specified<br/>&gt;12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The process starts by assigning a best tuning to each small period of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;time with a consistent set of notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;That sounds like a yes to my question above. But what exactly is a<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;small period of time&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A period when there are no notes on or notes off.  However, in what I<br/>&gt;consider to be a very important refinement possible only with &quot;leisure&quot;<br/>&gt;retuning, I do create &quot;pseudo-simultaneous events&quot; (PSE&apos;s) which for<br/>&gt;the purposes of modelling compress small transition times together,<br/>&gt;times when typically some notes end and others begin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Now in the tuning file you mention above, I can&apos;t see why you would<br/>&gt;&gt;want to have Eb at +16. The tuning file will evidently be applied only<br/>&gt;&gt;in dominant situations, using 4:5:6:7 for a C dominant seventh chord;<br/>&gt;&gt;so shouldn&apos;t the Eb be a 7/3 or -33?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Perhaps it should.  I haven&apos;t thought about that permutation.  It&apos;s true<br/>&gt;that redundancy in the provision for minor chords is not necessary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Maybe if we think through this we can figure out a way to eliminate<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning files altogether.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, we might!  And, as I&apos;ve said before, the continuous function<br/>&gt;represented by your harmonic entropy graphs is appealing to me as a<br/>&gt;tool to move toward that goal.   The problem is the &quot;traps&quot;: the<br/>&gt;question of how to get past local minima that hide better minima nearby.<br/>&gt;My current methods, messy though they are, have a rough-and-ready<br/>&gt;approach for dealing with this challenge, and it may take a fair number<br/>&gt;of new techniques to navigate a consistently better path.  Better<br/>&gt;solutions will undoubtedly come in time.

The barlines have NOTHING to<br/>&gt;do with the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I guess the point was to keep the meter simple... the music was SO<br/>&gt;new at that time that a constantly changing time sig. would &quot;freak<br/>&gt;out&quot; anybody trying to do the works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;However, I think you are right... Webern is after something here that<br/>&gt;is NOT congruent with his bar lines... and your version seems to well<br/>&gt;take this into account!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Oh.  By the way... I can&apos;t see your music pages in Netscape.

When<br/>&gt;&gt; the new age dawns it will strip old rules from their foundations<br/>&gt;&gt; and music<br/>&gt;&gt; will have to be explored from the ground up on a composer by<br/>&gt;&gt; composer basis.<br/>&gt;&gt; The only &quot;rule&quot; that will apply will be the one that started it<br/>&gt;&gt; all --  If it<br/>&gt;&gt; sounds good, It is good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Composers are still writing tonal 12-TET music for conventional<br/>instruments.<br/>&gt;I listen to their music, I don&apos;t think it will ever die -- I certainly hope<br/>&gt;it doesn&apos;t! I don&apos;t happen to write that kind of music because I have<br/>&gt;neither the skill set nor the patience to do so. But I am not willing to<br/>&gt;discard the efforts, talents, and creations of those who do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     As for all of you who bag &quot;computer music&quot; your complaints<br/>&gt;&gt; are valid at<br/>&gt;&gt; this point in time, but what are you going to be saying in 10<br/>&gt;&gt; years?  You&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; going to be kicking yourself for not learning everything you<br/>&gt;&gt; could have about<br/>&gt;&gt; it.  The computer is the most powerful tool on the planet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I first got interested in computer music in the 1960s when I was an<br/>&gt;undergraduate at the University of Illinois. Both Lejaren Hiller, the first<br/>&gt;person I know of to compose music by an algorithm, and Harry Partch, whose<br/>&gt;memory is revered here, were on the faculty. The first program I ever wrote<br/>&gt;and the first program I got paid to write were written for the same ILLIAC<br/>I<br/>&gt;where Hiller&apos;s &quot;ILLIAC Suite&quot; was composed. I still have the programmer&apos;s<br/>&gt;manual for ILLIAC I. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That was almost 40 years ago, and &quot;the most powerful tool on the planet&quot;<br/>has<br/>&gt;replaced neither the composer nor the conventional musical instrument in<br/>all<br/>&gt;that time. In that time I have &quot;learned everything I could have about it&quot;<br/>&gt;and make my living in computer science and applied mathematics to this day.<br/>&gt;I am currently getting back into computer music after a long (18 year)<br/>&gt;absence from it. In short, I have no complaints about today&apos;s tools;<br/>&gt;computer-synthesized music is my chosen form and I welcome as much help as<br/>&gt;can be obtained from algorithmic composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And for those of you who prefer live performance over &quot;dead&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; - you should<br/>&gt;&gt; wake up, too.  If you&apos;re going to achieve higher art, you&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; going to have to<br/>&gt;&gt; sculpt it just like you heard it.  People are going to want to hear it<br/>&gt;&gt; exactly like you did in your head.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here I have to disagree. Music is a social phenomenon; not all music is<br/>&gt;written by a solitary composer in a room with pen and music paper. A fairly<br/>&gt;large effort by some major talents, for example, Barry Vercoe, is being<br/>&gt;invested in real-time computer music and making the computer an instrument<br/>&gt;that can participate in live performances played by a performer just like a<br/>&gt;clarinet, piano or violin. Will there ever be a &quot;concerto for computer and<br/>&gt;orchestra?&quot; Will there ever be scholarships to prestigious conservatories<br/>&gt;for young computer virtuosi? Maybe ... certainly if a piece of music comes<br/>&gt;along that is *recognized* as good that happens to be for computer and<br/>&gt;orchestra, it could happen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think there is the widespread discrimination against computer music<br/>&gt;there was in, say, Hiller&apos;s day. The simple fact is that, while a quite a<br/>&gt;number of halfway decent computer-only pieces do exist, and some pieces for<br/>&gt;conventional instruments accompanied by computers also exist, *nothing* has<br/>&gt;been written for computer and orchestra that has caught the fancy of a<br/>major<br/>&gt;musical institution, and I&apos;m not holding my breath waiting for a composer<br/>to<br/>&gt;write such a piece. Nor am I attempting to create one myself. It&apos;s just too<br/>&gt;big a job for an amateur like me.<br/>&gt;--<br/>&gt;M.

From here we<br/>&gt;can determine the rest of the tuning, with a fifth of ~704.136 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does this look at all familiar? Curiously, Keenan Pepper&apos;s &quot;Noble<br/>&gt;Fifth&quot; tuning based on the Phi-based mediant between 4/7-octave and<br/>&gt;3/5-octave (weighted toward the latter) yields a fifth of ~704.096<br/>&gt;cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In discussing the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; temperament, devised as Keenan Pepper<br/>&gt;has emphasized from the viewpoint of a theoretical &quot;noble generator&quot;<br/>&gt;rather than specifically as a neo-Gothic temperament, I noted the very<br/>&gt;close approximation of Phi for the augmented fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thus these two tunings, derived from Phi in radically different ways,<br/>&gt;curiously are almost identical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Again, I&apos;d like to emphasize that these distinct methods of using Phi<br/>&gt;should _not_ be confused or equated; here, for whatever reason, they<br/>&gt;happen to produce these similar results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Most respectfully,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Margo Schulter<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 15<br/>&gt;   Date: Wed, 18 Oct 2000 19:26:42 -0700<br/>&gt;   From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Re: the sound of a distant acoustic horn...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;AMiltonF!<br/>&gt;    One of the problems of doing music on a computer is that one will not<br/>develop skills like<br/>&gt;one does on an instrument unless  you see typing 80 words a minute a<br/>technique.

I have to disagree with you about<br/>&gt;&quot;the old ways&quot;. Just intonation, for example, is one of those &quot;old ways&quot;<br/>&gt;that&apos;s been around in some form or another since ancient Greece! The<br/>&gt;notation system is nothing more than a communication tool ... without<br/>&gt;agreed-upon tools you don&apos;t have &quot;co-mmunication&quot;, just &quot;munication&quot;. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve seen some pretty impressive music tools in the past few months that<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve been getting back into computer music. One that stands out in my<br/>&gt;estimation is Michael Gogin&apos;s &quot;Silence&quot;, a Java wrapper around CSound that<br/>&gt;is designed for algorithmic composition. &quot;Silence&quot; features an<br/>&gt;11-dimensional musical space. Another is Phil Burk&apos;s &quot;JSyn&quot;, also written<br/>in<br/>&gt;Java, which is descended from something called HMSL (Hierarchical Music<br/>&gt;Specification Language), another algorithmic composition tool. For<br/>composers<br/>&gt;with a &quot;musique concrete&quot; bent, there is the &quot;Composer&apos;s Desktop Project&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I prefer building my own tools, and both &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;JSyn&quot; require the<br/>&gt;Java 2 Release 1.3 System Development Kit, which unfortunately occupies far<br/>&gt;more disk space than I am willing to give up for the pretty GUIs and the<br/>&gt;pseudo-portability that the current bloated Java offers. I mostly use the<br/>&gt;emerging MPEG-4 Structured Audio standard for synthesis, and for<br/>algorithmic<br/>&gt;work I use either the Derive math package, the Perl scripting language or<br/>&gt;the SwiftForth Windows development environment, depending on the nature of<br/>&gt;the task that needs to be done. The only tools I use that actually cost<br/>real<br/>&gt;money are Derive, SwiftForth and CoolEdit; everything else is freeware<br/>&gt;downloaded from the web.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And what kind of music do I write with these tools? Well ... the past few<br/>&gt;weeks I have mostly been experimenting with John deLaubenfels&apos; retuned MIDI<br/>&gt;files, getting them to play with a piano emulation &quot;instrument&quot; from the<br/>&gt;MPEG-4 Structured Audio examples. My next project is something I call the<br/>&gt;&quot;Setharophone&quot; ... a computer sound generator that uses additive synthesis<br/>&gt;and can actually compute the Sethares dissonance score as it plays. Once I<br/>&gt;get that built, I&apos;ll be posting some sounds on my web site.<br/>&gt;--<br/>&gt;M.

I knew there was something I liked about you besides your<br/>&gt;music. :-) Seriously, though, I am totally incompetent as a performer on<br/>&gt;conventional instruments. Even when I was younger and practiced an hour or<br/>&gt;so a day, I was never competitive as a flute player, although I enjoyed<br/>&gt;playing in the band and playing jazz. It&apos;s been over ten years since I even<br/>&gt;tried to play the thing; about the only performing I do these days is<br/>&gt;karaoke, at least until the smoke in the karaoke bar gets to me and I have<br/>&gt;to leave. If I am to make music at all, I need a computer. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And you&apos;re right about most computer music not sounding appreciably better<br/>&gt;than the old Moogs. I can tell you why that is. The paradigm used in<br/>&gt;computer music programs is a lot like the paradigm of the Moog --<br/>&gt;oscillators, filters, noise generators, buses, reverb units and so on. To<br/>&gt;some extent, that is a necessary simplification to make computer music<br/>&gt;accessible at all to musicians ... the underlying mathematics of<br/>&gt;sampled-data systems and the mechanics of generating the sound samples are<br/>&gt;decidedly non-trivial and something like a &quot;patch panel&quot; is required to<br/>&gt;facilitate understanding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As I said earlier, I have been studying computer music for nearly 40 years,<br/>&gt;and I prefer to build my own tools. And I think a &quot;music theory&quot; for<br/>&gt;computer music *will* emerge; I&apos;ve seen hints of it in Michael Gogins&apos;<br/>&gt;&quot;Silence&quot;, in the work on algorithmic composition since &quot;ILLIAC Suite&quot; and<br/>&gt;in the Audio Groups work at MIT that led to the MPEG-4 Structured Audio<br/>&gt;standard. But that&apos;s just me; I won&apos;t expect you to make computer music and<br/>&gt;hope that no one will expect me to learn to play the Diamond Marimba :-).<br/>&gt;--<br/>&gt;M.

My only beef is with the necessary honesty of<br/>&gt;presenting<br/>&gt;&gt; composer&apos;s as ideally as possible.  The concept of &quot;beauty&quot; is only<br/>&gt;relative,<br/>&gt;&gt; while cultural context is integral to any music, way beyond tuning<br/>&gt;itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Johnny, I do wish you would listen to John&apos;s examples. I personally<br/>&gt;worked pretty hard to<br/>&gt;get John to listen to and accomodate my views about what is and is<br/>&gt;not appropriate for<br/>&gt;various composers. Although we have just begun along this path, I<br/>&gt;truly believe that<br/>&gt;many of the examples John has produced are both faithful to the<br/>&gt;composer&apos;s intentions,<br/>&gt;and ideal in terms of the tradeoff of harmonic and melodic<br/>&gt;considerations. Think of it as<br/>&gt;the way a wind, brass, or string ensemble would perform the piece if<br/>&gt;they had<br/>&gt;superhuman pitch control and sensitivity to prior and future events<br/>&gt;in the score.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The idea of adaptive tuning goes back to Vicentino in 1555, who<br/>&gt;proposed the two chains<br/>&gt;of 1/4-comma meantone tuning a pure fifth (or equivalently, a pure<br/>&gt;minor third, or 1/4<br/>&gt;comma) apart. This proposal would never compromise the melodic<br/>&gt;integrity of the chain<br/>&gt;of identical (in this case, meantone) fifths by more than a<br/>&gt;melodically inaudible interval,<br/>&gt;1/4-comma, while attaining perfect vertical JI in all triads. To me,<br/>&gt;this amounts to audibly<br/>&gt;&quot;perfect&quot; tuning within the Renaissance theoretical ideal (as<br/>&gt;expressed by, say, Zarlino),<br/>&gt;and much of the subsequent repertoire well into the 18th century --<br/>&gt;until enharmonic<br/>&gt;equivalents began to be used. Though Vicentino&apos;s two-keyboard<br/>&gt;implementation was not<br/>&gt;practical at the time, with computers (or, perhaps, AFMM performers),<br/>&gt;we can acheive<br/>&gt;his goals, and even surpass him in cases where his proposal runs into<br/>&gt;difficulties.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would add a belated comment to John deLaubenfels -- in cases where<br/>&gt;a late 15th<br/>&gt;through early 18th century piece has more than 12 notated pitches,<br/>&gt;his program still<br/>&gt;leaves something to be desired relative to Vicentino&apos;s method -- as,<br/>&gt;if I recall correctly,<br/>&gt;he touched upon when considering 13-pitch schemes (John, what exactly<br/>&gt;did you look at<br/>&gt;as regards 13 notated pitches -- is it obsolete now)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 19<br/>&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Oct 2000 04:06:02 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: the sound of a ?distant? horn...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, AMiltonF@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;  Assuming that all significant music is going to be computer<br/>&gt;music -- and I<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;  think we&apos;re very far from that time.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why do you think it&apos;s so far off?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Because there&apos;s still a lot of instrumental performance that&apos;s worth<br/>&gt;doing, and I can&apos;t<br/>&gt;imagine that changing before dramatic changes in our civilization<br/>&gt;take place.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt;As for all of you who bag &quot;computer music&quot; your complaints are<br/>&gt;valid at<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt;this point in time, but what are you going to be saying in 10<br/>&gt;years?<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;  I might be making a lot of computer music, but I still might<br/>&gt;believe in the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;  magic of live performance.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There is only one original &quot;Starry Night&quot; as Van Gogh saw it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I see live improv groups (such as the Fringe here in Cambridge, MA)<br/>&gt;regularly create new<br/>&gt;Van Goghs every time they play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 20<br/>&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Oct 2000 04:08:17 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: the sound of a ?distant? horn...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt;<br/>&gt;wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, AMiltonF@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14620">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14620</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, I&apos;m not particularly interested in adding to the &quot;flames&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; here... but I do have one comment.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Within the last year I have TOTALLY stopped writing music at the<br/>&gt;&gt; piano and am only working at a MIDI keyboard with the computer in<br/>&gt;&gt; front of me... so I guess I&apos;m getting affected by this process to<br/>&gt;&gt; some<br/>&gt;&gt; degree as well...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But working at a MIDI keyboard the way you do, you&apos;re still<br/>&gt;restricted to 12 pitches out of<br/>&gt;the infinity at a time, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 21<br/>&gt;   Date: Thu, 19 Oct 2000 04:15:00 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: just right ? or just not quite<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Buddhi Wilcox&quot; &lt;buddhi@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; As it turns out , it has 18 pre - programmed tunings , which are<br/>&gt;fully editable<br/>&gt;&gt; (each note is editable up to +/- 9999 cents ! ) .

What an awesome thing. Major<br/>&gt;kudos to Erv Wilson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have to say that neither Monz&apos;s dictionary entries nor Kraig&apos;s web pages<br/>&gt;did it for me, although they helped. It was Paul Erlich&apos;s simple<br/>&gt;explanation that made it click. My how easily something so simple in<br/>&gt;concept (but not in conception) can be obscured.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The hard part for me was that I was looking for how one generates _ratios_<br/>&gt;for the pitches. But in fact one doesn&apos;t. One simply generates _integers_.<br/>&gt;And (in general) no note corresponds to 1. Of course these integers can<br/>&gt;become ratios by scaling them all by the same amount or by scaling them to<br/>&gt;the same octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I couldn&apos;t help thinking, hey this eikosany thing is at least 4<br/>&gt;dimensional, assuming products of 3 at a time from {1,3,5,7,9,11}) so it<br/>&gt;sure suffers when mapped to 2 dimensions, whether in Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt;10-star-inside-a-10-gon diagram or his bosanquet-style keyboard mapping.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I want it mapped to the surface of a donut. One just large enough to get my<br/>&gt;fingers inside, with 20 buttons distributed over the surface. To see how to<br/>&gt;map it, just take the standard 10-star-inside-a-10-gon diagram and raise<br/>&gt;every second note of the star above the page while lowering the others. the<br/>&gt;outer decagon can get a bit zig-zaggy too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You can build this approximately in zometool but it&apos;s too big (with 10 long<br/>&gt;reds in the middle, 10 medium yellows around the outside and 10 short reds<br/>&gt;joining them).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would limit it to 20 notes, but not to one octave (about 2.5 octaves) as<br/>&gt;follows. Simply take products of 3 at a time from {4,5,6,7,9,11} and don&apos;t<br/>&gt;reduce them to the same octave. The &quot;scale&quot; would have no octave but it<br/>&gt;would be a brilliant toy to let people hear the maximum number of different<br/>&gt;types of 11-limit consonance with the fewest notes (?), even if it was just<br/>&gt;some cheesy battery operated thing that only did sawtooth waves with no<br/>&gt;dynamics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve also looked at microtempering it (distributing the 224:225 and<br/>&gt;384:385).

One step to the right<br/>in the lattice will mean go up a perfect fifth (multiply by 3/2), one step<br/>diagonally up and to the right will mean you go up a major third (multiply<br/>by 5/4), and one step up and to the left will mean you go up a minor third<br/>(multiply by 6/5 -- since it&apos;s the same as going up a perfect fifth and down<br/>a major third, or multiplying by 3/2 and dividing by 5/4 -- get it?):</p><p>                        C#<br/>                       / \<br/>                      /   \<br/>                     A-----E-----B-----F#<br/>                    / \   / \   / \   /<br/>                   /   \ /   \ /   \ /<br/>                  F-----C-----G-----D<br/>                   \   / \   / \   /<br/>                    \ /   \ /   \ /<br/>                     Ab----Eb----Bb</p><p>Or in ratios:</p><p>                      25/24<br/>                       / \<br/>                      /   \<br/>                    5/3---5/4--15/8--45/32<br/>                    / \   / \   / \   /<br/>                   /   \ /   \ /   \ /<br/>                 4/3---1/1---3/2---9/8<br/>                   \   / \   / \   /<br/>                    \ /   \ /   \ /<br/>                    8/5---6/5---9/5</p><p>Now to convert ratios to cents, use the formula<br/>cents=log(ratio)/log(2)*1200.</p><p>The Pythagorean tuning is:</p><p>Ab----Eb----Bb----F-----C-----G-----D-----A-----E-----B-----F#----C#</p><p>See if you can work out the ratios yourself.</p><p>The harmonic scale is just notes from the fourth octave of the harmonic<br/>series:</p><p>16/16 17/16 18/16 19/16 20/16 21/16 22/16 24/16 26/16 27/16 28/16 30/16</p><p>or in lowest terms</p><p>1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 21/16 11/16 3/2 13/16 27/16 7/4 15/8</p><p>See if you can work out the ratios yourself.</p><p>I&apos;ll get back to you on the non-ratio tunings once you&apos;re solid on the<br/>above.
