I realize,<br/>though, that part of this is, of course, my OWN biased viewpoint --<br/>but, of course, everybody has one (!)</p><p>This little article is intended for the New Music Connoisseur<br/>magazine so it is, essentially, copyrighted by ME until they publish<br/>it, so please don&apos;t distribute it -- not that anyone might want to.</p><p>I hope it wasn&apos;t too critical of Warren Burt... he&apos;s quite a nice<br/>guy...</p><p>WARREN BURT -- Antipodean Collection:  A Laptop Symphony (2000).<br/>Engine 27, 173 Franklin Street, (Tribeca), NYC. Saturday November 4,<br/>2000, 8PM</p><p>If you haven&apos;t already heard (literally), there is a new performance<br/>space in town, Engine 27, located in Tribeca on Franklin Street.<br/>This new space, open just since September 2000, is mighty slick.<br/>Thereis considerable financing behind this place which looks like a<br/>long, rectangular loft, and is actually a reconverted old firehouse<br/>thathad been in disuse since the early 20th century, when fire<br/>engines could no longer squeeze through the door designed for<br/>horse-drawn vehicles. It has had a thorough &quot;makeover.&quot; Carefully<br/>placed and attractive protruding acoustical panels in square blue<br/>shapes hang on the walls, there is plenty of computer-controlled<br/>klieg lighting, and four large hanging speakers lend &quot;surround sound&quot;<br/>on all sides.  In addition, there is powerful computer equipment<br/>controlling EVERYTHING, sound and lighting.  The space also owns a<br/>significant amount of equipment not currently on display.  Seating is<br/>arranged with folding chairs, soany seating configuration is<br/>possible. Engine 27 is, basically, the concept of Jack Weisberg, who<br/>arranged private financing, but the composer Joel Chadabe, known for<br/>his electronic music expertise, and Bernadette Speach, a composer<br/>with exceptional organizational and promotional skills, are also<br/>closely involved. The focus of the space is specific:<br/>electro-acoustic music. It will be something to watch, or rather to<br/>LISTEN to!</p><p>Saturday night&apos;s program featured Warren Burt, a computer composer<br/>born and educated here in the U.S., but who has been spending most of<br/>his adult life in Australia, successfully landing composing grants.<br/>And it is true, Burt really does use his laptop to create most of his<br/>pieces.  He has many different computer programs running on this<br/>laptop, a Pentium II, and he creates a wide variety of compositional<br/>&quot;scenarios&quot; with it.  Personally, I find this conceptual variety the<br/>highpoint of Burt&apos;s presentation.  He sets up unusual &quot;backgrounds&quot;<br/>for compositions, each quite different.  Unfortunately, he has a<br/>tendency to let the computer do much of the active composing within<br/>each scenario.  Frankly, computers aren&apos;t really great composers<br/>without significant human intervention.  They don&apos;t seem to know how<br/>to stop repeating themselves, and can&apos;t distinguish a great musical<br/>moment from a mediocre one.  For this reason, in my own esthetic<br/>anyway, strictly computer-composed music ends up sounding a bit<br/>static. (&quot;Bit,&quot; get it?)</p><p>The Antipodean Collection consists of nine different recent works,<br/>essentially unrelated, but put together in one big piece because Burt<br/>wants them that way.  He sees it as a &quot;symphony&quot; with nine different<br/>movements. They seem to work as a set since together they&apos;re long<br/>enough for a concert program, and they are varied -- pieces with<br/>sampled &quot;words&quot; alternating with pure &quot;instrumentals.&quot;  In fact, the<br/>variation of approach and explanation BETWEEN pieces seemed even more<br/>interesting than the pieces themselves.  Burt has an engaging<br/>personality, and explains the different approaches with relish.  He<br/>is the master of the computer SETUP, creating interesting<br/>POTENTIALITIES for pieces with his hardware and software. After that,<br/>the computeris often left to its &quot;own devices&quot; with varying results.</p><p>The first &quot;movement,&quot; of this &quot;symphony&quot; was &quot;1. Milk Bottle&quot;<br/>dedicated to Annea Lockwood, who was in the audience.  Ms. Lockwood<br/>has a work, which I have not heard, that uses milk bottles as a<br/>generating source.  I found Burt&apos;s computer manipulation of the milk<br/>bottle sound fascinating.  He also did a lot in &quot;real time,&quot;<br/>sensitively mixing the channels together  just like performing a<br/>&quot;real&quot; musical instrument in public. Unfortunately, the sound of<br/>these milk bottles seems somewhat grating -- a little like a<br/>fingernail against a blackboard.  (I think I might prefer cardboard<br/>containers the next time.)</p><p>Movement two, &quot;2. Some Physical Virtual Sensuality&quot; had Burt moving<br/>his finger on the laptop trackpad to accompanying electronically<br/>sampled vowels and consonants.  Not too much more to say about this<br/>one.</p><p>&quot;3. Brisbane Nocturne&quot; had perhaps the most developed and interesting<br/>sounds of the lot.  It sounded a little like Charles Wuorinen&apos;s<br/>electronic music on Prozac.  Oh, I suppose there wasn&apos;t quite as much<br/>development since, again, the computer itself did most of the work.<br/>It was announced that this piece was in 13 equally tempered tones per<br/>octave.   For all you microtonal fans out there, please note that<br/>13-tET is one of the LEAST consonant scales as far as low-integer<br/>ratio sonorities (just intonation) are concerned.  This added a bit<br/>to the &quot;fabricated&quot; or &quot;unnatural&quot; effect of the piece, but made me<br/>wonder a little bit about Engine 27&apos;s  advance publicity of a &quot;just<br/>intonation drone...&quot;  (A very &quot;au courant&quot; idea, but I didn&apos;t hear<br/>any such piece.)</p><p>Several additional movements followed including &quot;4. VoiceChords II&quot;<br/>with improvisational jazz chords responding in turn to each press of<br/>a keyboard button, &quot;5. Debussy Cloud&quot; where a short phrase from a<br/>Debussy prelude in sampled piano sound was computer-manipulated, &quot;6.<br/>Looking Towards Antarctica,&quot; a &quot;noise passacaglia&quot; (need I say<br/>more?), &quot;7.Fractal Follies&quot; where computer generated fractals play<br/>games with one another, &quot;8. Five Tango Permutations&quot; where the<br/>pitched voices of poets reading their own works loop together and,<br/>finally, (whew!) &quot;9. Ten Windy Oscillators&quot; a big noisy culmination,<br/>created from pitched filtering of actual storm sounds.  (I thought<br/>those storm windows might come in handy...)</p><p>In short, Warren Burt&apos;s &quot;set ups&quot; -- his knowledge of computer<br/>possibilities and the variety of sounds and approaches that can be<br/>realized  using computers, samplers and MIDI sounds, is captivating.<br/>He has MANY creative ideas.  However, the computer is not really<br/>always such a good &quot;composing partner&quot; for him.  He lets it do the<br/>composing in most cases and, you know what?  It frequently makes some<br/>pretty dumb choices!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=15265 href="#15265">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2000 3:07:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I hope it wasn&apos;t too critical of Warren Burt... he&apos;s quite a nice<br/>&gt; guy...</p><p>then:</p><p>&gt; He lets it do the<br/>&gt; composing in most cases and, you know what?
