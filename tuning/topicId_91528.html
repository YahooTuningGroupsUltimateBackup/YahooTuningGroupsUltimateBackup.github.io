Firstly each one requires to be validated, if precise<br/>enough, or not ; secondly, the polynomial proposition gives good<br/>indications of how easy series can be developped from them, which is<br/>one of the interesting applications.<br/>Precision here varies a lot and I also suspect that some temperaments<br/>might need more precision than others, so it is an affair of<br/>evaluation by temperaments specialists now.<br/>I often gave several solutions, either for the ratio or its octave<br/>complement, whenever some simpler polynomials would occur in the<br/>neighborhood, in order to propose eventually various types of sequences.<br/>Note that the exponents of the polynomials, for ex. &quot;x3&quot;, has to be<br/>read &quot;x^3&quot;, and sorry for the silly french keyboard comma point...<br/>Just to give a rough idea of the matching precision, 0.001 (= one<br/>thousandth) is equivalent to  1,7 cent for the smaller ratios and<br/>decreases to 0,9 cent for ratios approaching 2/1.<br/>A few fractals (Miracle, Meantone, Vincentino, Dicot, Magic,<br/>Wuerschmidt, Schism) match exactly the values of the ratios given by<br/>Graham. Worse approximations generally do not exceed 1 cent.<br/>But precision required for very small generators could also be more<br/>critical than for others.</p><p>...Your feedback is welcome !</p><p>LINEAR TEMPERAMENTS GENERATORS VERSUS FRACTAL RATIOS -

That is not surprising :  a temperament is made to<br/>offer the best possible harmonic solutions, while a fractal sequence<br/>usually avoids harmonic attractors. If a recurrent sequence resolved<br/>all first primes like all these temperaments do, we would know it<br/>already.<br/>Also simplest forms of polynomials are just not present here : most<br/>of those fractals belong to relatively complex categories. Only a few<br/>of those fractals have been resolved in geometric form, who become<br/>more precious now because their specific timbres can be used for the<br/>corresponding temperaments, and this gives us good motivations for<br/>trying more.</p><p>2) However each time I&apos;ve been working on fractals based on a<br/>temperament&apos;s specific properties (what I did only for a few here), I<br/>found dozens and dozens (if not hundreds) of very close solutions,<br/>that would satisfy any need of precise generators for those<br/>temperaments.</p><p>3) There are methods to find pertinent sequences for any given<br/>temperament (that were applied with same success by Gene, according<br/>to the few perfect examples he gave - some of which I added here).</p><p>4) My collection shows holes in the very-near harmonic ratios<br/>(visible around 8/7 and 4/3), simply because I never looked at recurrences sequences in such places (which would result in very high<br/>numbers series and no special waveform) ; some temperaments on the<br/>contrary make use of quasi-harmonic intervals.</p><p>5) The list shows some specific musical zones I have been working on<br/>in musical projects, that in direct or octave-complement form seem to<br/>coincide with precise zones of linear temperaments :<br/>Gontrand &gt; Valentine<br/>Salmad &gt; Nautilus<br/>Octacot &gt; Limma<br/>Totem &gt; Hemikleismic/Hystrix<br/>Dlotkotier &gt; Porcupine<br/>Olzal &gt; Tetracot<br/>Sabra &gt; Orwell<br/>Keemun &gt; Lagune<br/>Sceptre &gt; Squares<br/>Poussah &gt; Clyde<br/>TierXring &gt; Sensipent<br/>Decime &gt; Vulture<br/>Helmut &gt; Pontiac/Helmholtz<br/>Salamandre &gt; Triton, etc.<br/>The case of Orwell/Orson versus Sabra is interesting, as different<br/>fractals correspond with a fair precision to the octave complements<br/>of each version of the temperament.</p><p>6) More surprising, I found some holes in the linear temperament<br/>list, at places where musical systems, even used in traditional music, have galaxies of fractal solutions : the &quot;Buzurg&quot; zone is one<br/>of these, that would generate very musical scales : at least Margo<br/>Schulter will not contradict me on that point (Margo, I have not read<br/>your last article on Buzurg yet : will see if we find some<br/>concordances on the subject !). The only reason I see for that<br/>omission in the temperament list is that the Buzurg generator before<br/>anything else conciliates 7 and 13, and will not come to harmonics 3,<br/>5 and 11 before longer cycles, therefore it is not on a list that<br/>privilegiates temperaments with full 3, 5, 7 solutions and after.<br/>Here is a 23-limit mapping, showing main MOS at 10, 43 , 53, that<br/>would be resolved by a &quot;Buzurg&quot; neutral third of 16 unequal steps of<br/>53 steps in one octave (around 362 cents) :<br/>&lt;0, -8, 11, 6, 28, -1, -3, 24, 15]<br/>(note that the 23rd harmonic, one of the best centered, would be reached precisely by 15 generators, suggesting a useful and efficient<br/>target generator with 1.2324856 or 361.884956 c.)<br/>note also that a pure harmonic 3 will be attained with a generator of<br/>362.255625 c.<br/>Many practical fractals would qualify as Buzurgs, such as :</p><p>7x^2 = 7x + 2&#x9;&gt; 1,23192505471&#x9;&gt; 361,09738964 c.<br/>4x^7 = 16 + x&#x9;&gt; 1,2320003029&#x9;&gt; 361,2031329 c.<br/>4x^2 = 11 - 4x&#x9;&gt; 1,2320508076 &#x9;&gt; 361,2741 c.<br/>x^8 = x^7 + 1&#x9;&gt; 1,2320546314&#x9;&gt; 361,2794748 c.<br/>x^2 = 20 - 15x&#x9;&gt; 1,2321245983 &#x9;&gt; 361,37778668556 c.<br/>3x^2 = 11x - 9 &#x9;&gt; 1,2324081208&#x9;&gt; 361,77611271646 c.<br/>4x^4 = 8 + x &#x9;&gt; 1.23258192464&#x9;&gt; 362,020247741 c.<br/>2x^5 = 8 - x^4&#x9;&gt; 1,2326439928&#x9;&gt; 362,107458 c.<br/>8x^5 = 24 - x &#x9;&gt; 1,2326632514&#x9;&gt; 362,1344722332 c.<br/>2x^8 = 15 - x^7&#x9;&gt; 1,2328237225&#x9;&gt; 362,359833742 c.<br/>x^2 = 28x - 33 &#x9;&gt; 1,2328546652&#x9;&gt; 362,403288 c.</p><p>The simplest series are generated by x^8 = x^7 + 1, such as :<br/>17 21 26 32 39 48 59 73 90 111 137 169 208 256 315 388 478...<br/>(differentials 4 5 6 7 9 11 14 17 21 26 32 39 48 59 73 90...)<br/>4x^4 = 8 + x  converges to a generator by coincidence also<br/>approximated by the main MOS ratio : 53/43...<br/>One last thought : 43 + 53 = 96 steps/octave, a division I know to be<br/>dear to Shaahin Mohajeri, features of course also a very good Buzurg<br/>third of 13 + 16 = 29 steps.</p><p>7) Another empty zone, even if in a smaller region of the list is<br/>lower meantones, around 7-edo such as Thai scales, for the same<br/>reasons I suppose, because the generators provide only complex 3, 5<br/>and 7 solutions.</p><p>8) Another fractal I consider as specially harmonic and musical,<br/>Zinith,  2x2 - 2x = 1, of solution (sqrt3+1)/2 = 1.366025404 or<br/>539.9811764 c. is not sollicited either, I think not only because<br/>Zinith approximates 7, 11, 13, 15 and with less success 3 or 5, but<br/>perhaps also because it quasi-ends in a 20-edo cicrcle, and perfect<br/>h. 3 and 5 would only come after a reiteration of the generator<br/>several hundred times. Should it be seen only as a non-3 &amp; 5 tuning<br/>then, or could it be possible to lower 719,8494 c. to a more<br/>acceptable fifth ? (and eventually making the 512/x^20 comma more<br/>useful ?)  Then another linear temperament could be proposed as well :<br/>&lt;0, 8, -6, 4, 1, 6, -2, 5]<br/>... a challenge that would have the advantage to be able to use the<br/>colorful timbres of the Zira&apos;at and Zinith waveforms, some of the<br/>most emblematic fractal sounds I heard.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2010 11:58:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 4 August 2010 19:10, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1) There is generally no adequation between<br/>&gt; temperaments and fractals, and&nbsp;even rather a<br/>&gt; more general &quot;phase&nbsp;opposition&quot; between the<br/>&gt; two worlds.

Also generally, the lower the coefficient of the highest<br/>&gt; power, the better.<br/>&gt; But I like 12x^2  = 5x + 10, for other reasons.</p><p>Ah, I see you answer some of this. Leading term should be small, and the number of terms is best if 3, or at least not higher than 4. But what about degree, and the roots?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2010 11:42:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subgroups exist in such profusion that Graham&apos;s answer machine<br/>&gt; &gt; is the thing to use; no one is likely to produce a survey list<br/>&gt; &gt; or to discuss many of these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This strikes me as a lame argument.

Other positive roots below the generator are not a problem, and negative roots of higher absolute value certainly have an influence, that I have to investigate more. But divergent series are not a problem, they just have to be examined in their opposite direction.<br/>There are more criterias, but these are the simplest.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2010 2:55:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 7 August 2010 17:32, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/uv.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/uv.html</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; and put your commas in. &nbsp;(Please don&apos;t put Gene&apos;s in because they&apos;ll<br/>&gt;&gt; hang the script.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why does it do that?
