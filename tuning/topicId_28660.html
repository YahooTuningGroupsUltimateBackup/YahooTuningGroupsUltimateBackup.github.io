If you look under the hood using<br/>Scala, you find two adjacent scale degrees which to within a few<br/>cents allow a 1-5/4-4/3-3/2-5/3-15/8 scale, with neither the major<br/>nor the minor tone available. However, we do have an excellent<br/>supermajor tone, or 8/7, and an excellent subminor tone close to<br/>12/11, so you get two adjacent, semi-diatonic scales within Blackjack.</p></div><h3><a id=28683 href="#28683">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2001 12:19:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you look under the hood using<br/>&gt; Scala, you find two adjacent scale degrees which to within a few<br/>&gt; cents allow a 1-5/4-4/3-3/2-5/3-15/8 scale, with neither the major<br/>&gt; nor the minor tone available.</p><p>I was previously aware of this for two reasons: 1. it&apos;s immediately<br/>evident from the lattice; 2.
