For single<br/>intervals, I&apos;m not sure how beat rates will help you with this:</p><p>&gt;I feel that the<br/>&gt;tolerance for mistuning is greatest for intervals with a*b complexity<br/>&gt;of about 30 to 35 and less for both simpler and more complex ratios.</p><p>though I thought we had once discussed using a minimum of two functions for<br/>the tolerance (to get it to behave this way), one being based on beat rate<br/>and another on . . . ?</p></div>
