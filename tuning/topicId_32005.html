I seriously doubt that any subjective agreement is even possible in the subjectives spheres of the perceptions of our (individual) &quot;aural minds&quot;. So, I (in a form similar, but not in the same manner as you) endeavor to characterize these numerical relationships in ways which (rather than representing a dynamic spectral time-varying forest which clearly overwhelms the eye) bring to light topological structures which may lend insight into why (my) &quot;aural mind&quot; has found this or that preferable in my playing of music. Whether such systems can successfully *predict* my (or anyone else&apos;s) reaction to movements and choices *dictated* by such atomistic and theoretical endeavors remains a far more open question.</p><p>I (like you) would love to &quot;sum it all up&quot; with elegant and beautiful mathematical constructs which somehow manage to avoid the very complicated spectral results which clearly accompany the reduction to practice of such implementations of given scales on given instruments.</p><p>But I would be fooling myself to think that Nature has kindly hidden away some &quot;golden fleece&quot; just for us, if we only *think* hard enough. A lot of the process of understanding such complicated, interwoven systems and phenomena rests upon endeavoring to *look* at the situation from many different viewpoints (as you point out below).</p><p>Whether any of us will, by pure gumption, &quot;unify&quot; all these many and varied things under some &quot;umbrella&quot; conceptualizations, is doubtful.</p><p>And, there is always the old &quot;NIH&quot; (not-invented-here) syndrome, which tends to cause us to gravitate to a global-viewpoint seen &quot;in and through&quot; our favorite personal metaphors for the &quot;side of the elephant&quot; which we have happened, in our personal thoughts, to spent a lot of time looking through... Much like the effect of listening to a tape of oneself &quot;improvising&quot; in a particular performance numerous times, until one finds (upon attempting to &quot;improvise&quot; again over the same musical piece) that one has become accustomed to the &quot;sound of their own voice&quot; (so to speak, or one might say, so to *play*), and finds it *harder* to *continue* to &quot;improvise&quot; [which seems to require that (I as a) *player*, as well as the &quot;audience&quot;, not &quot;impose&quot; a predictable pattern, or outcome upon one&apos;s *future* choices of timing, tone, and interaction with the other &quot;voices&quot;.</p><p>Sometimes it seems &quot;hack musicians&quot; (like me) aspire to be mathematicians, or &quot;hack mathematicians&quot; (like me) aspire to be musicians. Being a bit of both (and utilizing *entirely different* &quot;areas&quot; of my &quot;mind&quot; in order to approach these<br/>highly different &quot;areas&quot;), I am skeptical that I could (even if I really, really wanted to) ever meaningfully equate the two areas. In the very least, the *same* person has to execute the &quot;doing&quot;, as well as the &quot;thinking&quot;, about such ethereal relationships in order to (even) adequately develop a (private) &quot;in-dwelling&quot; within the &quot;theory as reduced to practice&quot;.</p><p>I spent about 5 years designing and developing a professional audio signal processor (developed around guitar, but more generally targeted) with the goal of improving the &quot;sustain/distortion&quot; ratio, and all without degrading the dynamics of the amplitude envelope of the musical signal to be processed. In the non-linear world of electronic signal processing (true for any device which alters the signal path gain or frequency response in time), the electronic designer in me spent *years* endlessly tweaking a large number of complicated and interacting &quot;input variables&quot; (such as transfer functions and frequency responses) in a &quot;perspiration-dominated&quot; process of theorizing, modifying, then actually *using* my creation in the process of ... *pleasing (my own) ear*.</p><p>The idea was to, in addition, try to &quot;draw a line&quot; representing a &quot;best fit&quot; through the (inherently subjective) &quot;datapoints&quot; and &quot;preferences&quot; on a &quot;global basis&quot; (the likes/dislikes of others, as well as myself). The goal was a simple, &quot;one-knob&quot;, extremely easy to use device which would spectrally enhance the musicians sound, yet not suddenly sound like distorted crap, and would not output peak levels which would cause (the unkown and uncontrollable) overloading of subsequent equipment in a signal path. Not a small order, indeed!</p><p>After about 5 years of humbling my &quot;left-lobe&quot; to the poetic demands of my &quot;right-lobe&quot;, and attempting to average over a wide range of musical contexts, all the while obsessing over every *detail* of the quality and duration of the *tone* (where *every* detail matters!!!), found that some world-class musicians (in using my processor in live performances) not only *said* (to me and others) that they really liked how they sounded &quot;through it&quot;, but they (also) wanted to use it again, regularly (a profound and humbling joy for me).</p><p>Lest your visions of &quot;mosh-pits&quot; beneath bare-chested, long-haired swinging metal-heads making peoples ears&apos; bleed through excessively overdriven Marshall Amp&apos;s, where the PA doubles as a &quot;fuzz-tone&quot; too... overtake you at this point, I will say these were not people unaquainted with melody and tonality (jazz greats Herb Ellis, Larry Coryell, Howard Roberts; blues greats Buddy Guy, Elvin Bishop, and John Cipollina). What a thrill it was to (like a luthier of sorts) enable them to find the sweet, resonant string vibrations deeper within their instruments, to see such greats find such a useful tool with which to enhance their subtle low-level nuances, while then launching into rapid arpeggiated chords without the penalties to be paid in the area of the creation of (undesired) distortion products.</p><p>I would have *never* have even pleased myself, much less please these others, had I not been in a continual &quot;feedback-loop&quot; between the(focal, technical, calculating) portion of &quot;mind&quot; endlessly adapting to the &quot;mental rubber&quot; meeting the &quot;sonic road&quot; of *listening*. I still cannot *really* define the *reasons* why *others* may have found a friend of ringing strings in my silicon hardware, I still only have [1] My &quot;aural minds&quot; view; [2] The smiles on their face, and the beautiful sounds *they* created; and [3] last and, as well, least, my minds view of the systemic topology and parameters.</p><p>It could not have evolved without [3], but [2] in conjunction with [1] still makes the entire experience something much sweeter and real (from the context of music *followed* by thought, and not the other way around).</p><p>&gt; &gt; There may be more than on<br/>&gt; &gt; way to &quot;skin the cat&quot; (but we may never know)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PE:Indeed there are . . . Between Tanaka, Wurschmidt, Wilson, etc., &gt;we<br/>&gt; have tons of differently formulated theories, all of which turn out<br/>&gt; to reveal different faces of the periodicity block theory.

Where are we with<br/>that?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; After about 5 years of humbling my &quot;left-lobe&quot; to the poetic<br/>&gt;demands of my &quot;right-lobe&quot;, and attempting to average over a wide<br/>&gt;range of musical contexts, all the while obsessing over every<br/>&gt;*detail* of the quality and duration of the *tone* (where *every*<br/>&gt;detail matters!!!), found that some world-class musicians (in using<br/>&gt;my processor in live performances) not only *said* (to me and<br/>&gt;others) that they really liked how they sounded &quot;through it&quot;, but<br/>&gt;they (also) wanted to use it again, regularly (a profound and<br/>&gt;humbling joy for me).</p><p>This sounds like something I&apos;d be interested in! Send me info.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would have *never* have even pleased myself, much less please<br/>&gt;these others, had I not been in a continual &quot;feedback-loop&quot; between<br/>&gt;the(focal, technical, calculating) portion of &quot;mind&quot; endlessly<br/>&gt;adapting to the &quot;mental rubber&quot; meeting the &quot;sonic road&quot; of<br/>&gt;*listening*.</p><p>I&apos;m exactly the same way when it comes to music theory.</p><p>&gt; JG: I cannot help but listen the &quot;hardest&quot; to those who have made<br/>&gt;such sounds, with various timbres, and actuality explored and<br/>&gt;developed systems of tonal choice.</p><p>Well, here we are!</p><p>&gt; Clearly, we may (doubly) lose reference by &quot;thinking&quot; (conceptually)<br/>&gt;about *other* players (post-performance-perceptions). Only those who<br/>&gt;master both the analytical as well presentational aspects of music<br/>&gt;can hope to, having narrowed it down to half as many uncertainties<br/>&gt;by actually being the one who *does* it, as well as (then)<br/>&gt;pondering...</p><p>AGREED 100%!!!</p></div>
