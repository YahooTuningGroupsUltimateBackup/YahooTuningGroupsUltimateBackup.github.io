When I search for this same<br/>&gt;&gt;effect on my M-1, I find nothing but frustration. My conclusion is that the<br/>&gt;&gt;human ear can hear a &quot;lock&quot; that is &quot;in the cracks&quot; between cents, and this<br/>&gt;&gt;perception is not available when tuning is limited to cents.</p><p>Paul Erlich commented:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is very mysterious-sounding. Putting aside the validity of your<br/>&gt; conclusion, can you at least find the tuning on the M-1 that is within one<br/>&gt; cent of what you vocally sing as the high third over a root and fifth, and<br/>&gt; tell us what that tuning is?</p><p>It would seem that I should be able to select a &quot;best of&quot; from the M-1 in<br/>regard to matching the &quot;high third.&quot; One of the problems is that I can&apos;t<br/>seem to set a &quot;locked&quot; perfect fifth in the vicinity of 702 cents (the<br/>location suggested by the Harvard Dictionary) to which a well tuned &quot;high<br/>third&quot; might be sung, much less be located by diddling with the synth knobs<br/>and sliders.</p><p>BTW, I conducted the &quot;floating third&quot; experiment with my new singers on<br/>Monday and it still appears to hold up. I&apos;ll bring my tape recorder tomorrow<br/>and record it. Hopefully, I&apos;ll be able to post the sounds before the<br/>weekend.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
