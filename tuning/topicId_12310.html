If you burden your performers<br/>down with such &quot;Specialization&quot; the other suffers. I think he was interested in another type<br/>of virtuoso, those developed by such theatre directors as Grotowski, Barba and in your own<br/>city Richard Schechner. If his work was so lacking in &quot;virtioso-ness&quot; why it is the<br/>performances of his works seem to fall short of the original Gate 5 versions as unhappy as he<br/>was with these.<br/>(I am not referring to your versions)<br/>    Remember all that complex music of multiple subdivisions where all the player can do is<br/>count? The music per se falls apart out of the lack of neglect of the &quot;other parameters&quot;</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Partch&apos;s &quot;Revelation in the Courthouse Park&quot; in non-virtuosic.

I believe this was<br/>the premiere of the work. I don&apos;t remember all that much about it, although<br/>I do remember the unusual instruments and the fact that I enjoyed it. It<br/>was, as I recall, a work created with the limitations of college student<br/>performers in mind, which I find rather attractive in a work that uses<br/>non-standard instruments and scales. I suspect &quot;Revelation&quot; has been<br/>performed more often than other works of equal novelty. Is it as great a<br/>piece as, say, Stravinsky&apos;s &quot;A Soldier&apos;s Tale&quot;? I suspect not. But, as I<br/>noted earlier, I think composers need to put more effort into performability<br/>when dealing with unusual timbres, tunings, temperaments, scales and such,<br/>unless they are writing only for themselves and a computer.<br/>--<br/>M.

Is it as great a piece as, say,<br/>&gt; Stravinsky&apos;s &quot;A Soldier&apos;s Tale&quot;? I suspect not.</p><p>Just a quick comment on this...</p><p>I was fortunate to be able to see the &apos;official&apos; (i.e.,<br/>&apos;professional&apos;) world premiere of _Revelation_ in Philadelphia<br/>in 1987, conducted by Danlee Mitchell.  (It was later released<br/>on CD on the Tomato label, and the Lincoln Center library<br/>in New York has a video of it that can be viewed in-house.)</p><p>The work has been touted by various reviewers as Partch&apos;s<br/>&apos;magnum opus&apos;, but I don&apos;t think I can agree with that.<br/>The *conception* is admittedly broad in scope, but IMO its<br/>realization is not as effective as some other Partch pieces.</p><p>The other Partch piece that&apos;s often called his &apos;magnum opus&apos;<br/>is _Oedipus_.  I&apos;d be more inclined to agree about this one,<br/>but I&apos;ve never seen it live, and so will withhold further comment.</p><p>That said, I *have* seen a number of Partch pieces live, chiefly<br/>at Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM concerts and by Newband.  The two<br/>performances that really blew me away were John Schneider&apos;s solo<br/>rendition of the original version of _Barstow_, and Newband doing<br/>_U.S. Highball_.</p><p>These are the first two pieces Partch gathered together under<br/>the collective title _The Wayward_.  The other two, _San<br/>Francisco_ and _The Letter_, I&apos;m only familiar with from Partch&apos;s<br/>own recordings.</p><p>But I think this is one of those instances where a composer<br/>reached a &apos;twin peak&apos; of inspiration *and* successful realization<br/>early on in his career, without ever quite attaining it again<br/>later.</p><p>So I suppose that my nomination for the &apos;Partch masterpiece&apos;<br/>would be _The Wayward_.</p><p>Of course, the ensemble here is much smaller than that for either<br/>_Revelation_ or _Oedipus_, which probably has some bearing on<br/>the &apos;magnum opus&apos; business.  In fact, my favorite Partch pieces<br/>of all are the earliest and smallest-ensemble, _17 Lyrics by<br/>Li-Po_.</p><p>That&apos;s just my 2^(2/1200).</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
