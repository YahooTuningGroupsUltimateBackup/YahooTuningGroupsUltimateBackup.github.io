Thanks for all that data.  We do have<br/>&gt; some different sources.</p><p>I have plenty of archiv material plus loads of books (lots<br/>facsimiles and fotos of prints) in my working room. Then of course<br/>what modern researchers published. Amongst others this material<br/>includes published archival material, especially valuable a wealth<br/>of examination reports, and other archival material about the<br/>actual status of an organ, right after the organ builder was there<br/>- etc.  i&apos;m busy with putting all this together, so that you might<br/>find my big book on available on our website some time late summer<br/>next year.</p><p>What is your material?</p><p>&gt;  As you said, you don&apos;t need to bring Werckmeister into your<br/>&gt; dissertation.<br/>&gt; I would hate to upset your track to graduation. ;)</p><p>Thanks for the concern - just wonder why I should not know, what<br/>belongs to my diss. topic or not.<br/>Why not Werckmeister or other temperament proposers, whose ideas<br/>were discussed or published in the region (Northern Germany, takig<br/>also related areas) and the time (17th, 18th centuy) which I&apos;m<br/>doing my research in.<br/>And the claimed connections between Schnitger, Buxtehude,<br/>Werckmeister are reason enough. Anyone in the field would blame me<br/>rightly for failing to discuss it (and I would blame myself, too)</p><p>&gt; However, there are other sources.  Have you checked<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s own report of 1705 about the Groningen<br/>&gt; temperament change?

Mainz 1932.</p><p>Werckmeister does not specify any precise temperament to which<br/>that organ had been retuned.

This  event -<br/>prbably the largest organist convention before the 20th century,<br/>happened thus 109 years before W. published his book at the<br/>occasion of the rebuilt of thet organ etc., during which it got a<br/>new temperament. The retuning in Gr&ouml;ningen which Werckmeister<br/>vaguely describes was a single case, not representative at all for<br/>the temperament practice. Not  even in W.&apos;s region - as several<br/>known examples up to the late 1730s show.</p><p>In Walther&apos;s region (Weimar/Thuringia - different traditions<br/>everywhere, not to be mixed up)  there are reports of some<br/>different temperament approaches in practice - here and there.<br/>Even if this is contrary to the North Contrary, it must be seen<br/>still as a marginal development, as nothing points to to a sort of<br/>a big rush, that every town church soon would have one of the<br/>&quot;new&quot; temperaments.<br/>For a long time during the 18th century examination reports of<br/>organs just (actually) retuned  point to the &quot;new&quot; temperament. If<br/>it is somewhat specified, then much more often Neidhardt than<br/>Werckmeister. But if there are specification of the &quot;new&quot;<br/>temperaments in the reports, then it is most often &quot;Equal<br/>temperament&quot;, or  &quot;the new equal temperament&quot; etc.</p><p>In the North the same development starts and can be seen between<br/>ca. 1760-1830 (+- 20 years) - since it came so late in the North,<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s ideas came often &quot;too late&quot; for retuning the still<br/>meantone organ - most often we can find indications of retunings<br/>from meantone directly into ET (with all the organ building<br/>problems I sketched above)</p><p>&gt;  The organ builder Wender of Muhlhausen preferred to use<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Nothing proves that - It is an assumtion on shiny chronological<br/>and geographical coincidences, somewhat similar to the arguments<br/>which put Werckmeister and Buxtehude together to argue for that<br/>Buxtehude adopted Werckmeisters&apos;s temperament ideas.<br/>If so then Buxtehude must have felt unhappy for 26 years<br/>1681-1707, because the records don&apos;t allow to conclude anything<br/>like any retuning. Even worse nothing else points to that the most<br/>important North German musician of his time  managed to secretly<br/>have retuned his two organs (one of them belonging to the largest<br/>organs existing) in one of the proudest North European cathedrals,<br/>so that it escaped everyone&apos;s attention, not at least the<br/>temperament &quot;nuts&quot; of the early 18th century, who even visited L&uuml;beck.</p><p>&gt; Ahle, Bach&apos;s predecessor in Muhlhausen, was indeed freinds<br/>&gt; with W. (including things about W. in his prose and<br/>&gt; voluminous writings).  It would appear</p><p>It would, yes, and might appear so to some.<br/>But the historical documents available until now on Wender do not<br/>back up the assumtions enough, to conclude which exact temperament<br/>he might have used.</p><p>&gt; that Bach walked into an already tuned Werckmeister</p><p>Nothing is known, which sufficiently would confirm this or support it.<br/>Do you know what the examination reports from these organ specify<br/>about the temperament?</p><p>&gt; organ in both Arnstadt and Muhlhausen.  No less<br/>&gt; than Kuhnau spoke of Wender&apos;s insistence on Werckmeister<br/>&gt; tuning.</p><p>Please provide a reference for this: when did Kuhnau state this,<br/>and which exactly of Werckmeister&apos;s several temperaments does he<br/>refer to?</p><p>Kuhnau worked in Leipzig, - around 1700 this was scarcely related<br/>to the - quite different - organ building practice of Northern<br/>Germany which I&apos;m researching.</p><p>If you can show th evidence for your statement by any reference,<br/>then it would point to a signficant change in Kuhnau&apos;s position<br/>towards temperament:   in 1717 he complains to Mattheson in a<br/>letter about the organ builder&apos;s Wender&apos;s and Silbermann&apos;s<br/>temperament practice, that they do not use the &quot;exact temperament&quot;<br/>of Neidhart (i. e.  ET, as Neidhart specified it, from his other<br/>suggestions). According to Norrback&apos;s research &quot;it is not clear [from the sources] what [temperament] they [these organ builders]<br/>used instead.&quot;</p><p>And the Silbermann researcher Frank Harald Gress pointed to<br/>Silbermann&apos;s usual application of some form of meantone<br/>temperament (probably 1/4-comma-meantone, or very close) in<br/>Silbermann&apos;s earlier decades (the later statement from Sorge about<br/>a 1/6-komma-temperament, must be seen in the biased light of the<br/>&quot;Temperaturen-Streit&quot; of the later 18th century! Sorge&apos;s<br/>description can&apos;t simply be taken literally for Silbermann&apos;s<br/>practice, as confirmed by other documents).</p><p>Whatever temperament Wender actually might have applied, is not<br/>known or documented to my knowlegde. The recent Bach-Jahrbuch<br/>article by Marcus Rathey unfortunately creates the impression from<br/>mere chronological and geographical coincidences and reasoning,<br/>without any proof and double checks from the organ&apos;s history.<br/>And once same old soup again here, too:  How much does an assumed<br/>friendship between Ahle and Werckmeister tell about Wender&apos;s (not<br/>documented) actual organ temperament in M&uuml;hlhausen?  Nothing, of<br/>course - it is an interpretation by connecting<br/>non-temperament-related items. May be - may be not.</p><p>&gt; About winds and strings, we have just completed performances<br/>&gt; of Bach&apos;s Brandenburg Concerto #2</p><p>(s. Peter Schleuning&apos;s brilliant recent study:<br/><a href="http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/tomita/bachbib/review/bb-review_SchleuningBra.html">http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/tomita/bachbib/review/bb-review_SchleuningBra.html</a><br/>)</p><p>&gt; in Werckmeister III in a beautiful intonation.</p><p>This is certainly a great and today unusual achievement (only a<br/>few, and not always the best known ensembles, perform in an as<br/>much as possible &apos;impeccable&apos; intonation).</p><p>But - yours and your ensemble&apos;s skills and musicianship aside - I<br/>don&apos;t see what does it tell about temperament practice back in ca.<br/>1710-20 in keyboard instruments (as opposed to free intonationg<br/>instruments)?<br/>For an free intonating instrument it is no advantage from another<br/>circulating temperament, since they only have to play pure above<br/>the lowest - as pure as possible: in  practice that means, +-3 to<br/>5 cents around the pure (!) interval above the lowest note, which<br/>makes for that purpose  all well-temperaments marginal in difference!</p><p>And what at all has it to do with church organs, which were not<br/>the continuo instrument for any of Bach&apos;s &quot;Brandenburg&quot; concerti,<br/>I don&apos;t grasp.</p><p>&gt; There is no difficulty retuning -- at least to us moderns.</p><p>Sure, of course a harpsichord is easily retuned - as the old<br/>sources mention, frequently. And they make frequently differences<br/>what a diferent temperaments is used to. There are differences for<br/>stringed keyboard instruments as opposed to the organ. The<br/>discussion of temperaments concerning the tuning of the ensemble<br/>accompanying instruments difers, too and splits up again in<br/>looking differently at organs (for accompaniment) or stringed<br/>keyboard instrumenst (for accompaniment) - not to take fretted<br/>instruments, for which Et or close-to-ET is reported way earlier.</p><p>But an organ, was of course difficult to retune. Only to convince<br/>the church Elders to pay the money, could be the first part of the<br/>work, with which a project might have failed.  As I said before:<br/>large, public payed organs, serving a function in a &quot;conservative&quot;<br/>society and liturgy were no lab for unprecedented temperament<br/>experiments, to change a ca.  250 years tradition</p><p>Not only do I have plenty of descriptions and contemporary remarks<br/>on the extreme difficulties in tuning organs back then, but also<br/>the time, as represented in payments to bellows treader by working<br/>days, specifying btw often that they pumped for tuning this-long<br/>and for voicing that-long (so this can be discerned in some very<br/>important examples).</p><p>Technically the problems could be<br/>- more unstable wind supply or at least flexible w.s.<br/>- over months of tuning the temperature in the (unheated)<br/>  church would raise or fall considerably, leading to large<br/>  differences of pitch - not to talk about the problems<br/>  of a  (in January I visited a large unheated Hanseatic<br/>  church in Germany - it was ca. 4&deg; C)<br/>- the long exhausting process of taking out a pipe, treating it<br/>  by cutting, putting it back, waiting some minutes until it is<br/>  cooled down, trying, and if it was not fine then start again<br/>- trial and error<br/>- change of scaling through cutting pipes (which might lead<br/>  to higher cut ups, from which a wind pressure raising might<br/>  be regarded necessary, that again can lead to a revoicing<br/>  ... (the chain of domino bricks starts ...)<br/>- unprofessional unstable tuning by pressing pipes together<br/>  or widening the pipe ends with the fingers<br/>etc.</p><p>&gt;  The string merely follow the harpsichord.  The winds today<br/>&gt; use scotch tape to alter the  positioning of the keys and<br/>&gt; the shape of the tone holes.</p><p>Today, tape is may be a solution - But, contradicting is, that I<br/>have not seen any good baroque oboe player doing something like<br/>that to his instrument. And what kind of tape would you suggest<br/>for the practice back then? I thought it is an invention of the<br/>20th century?</p><p>I certainly can imagine that you were part of a great performance<br/>of concerted ensemble music, which you mention. But again, how<br/>exactly could an argumentbe drawn from your recent performance for<br/>the historical knowledge or narrowing in to the temperament<br/>practice (not theories, which were published, without that we know that they were practised) in North German church organs from the<br/>documented evidence, as reported for example in examination and<br/>other status reports etc.</p><p>&gt; You work in abstract confirms the use of quarter-comma meantone in<br/>&gt; Holland.<br/>&gt; But it  does not mitigate against the influence Werckmeister had</p><p>As I previously stated, my abstract of F.v.Wijk&apos;s and mine<br/>25-page-article on the Alkmaar-temperament history  ad the article<br/> itself,  does not refer to Werckmeister, as he was not relevant<br/>for that specific topic.</p><p>&gt; on other creative types in an earlier generation.  Take<br/>&gt; a close look at Walther&apos;s Lexicon</p><p>1732<br/>it is everyday on my table ...</p><p>&gt; for all the usage of Werckmeister.</p><p>of which Walther doesn&apos;t write even a tiny bit!</p><p>&gt; He&apos;s all over the place.</p><p>Werckmeister&apos;s name in Walther&apos;s Lexicon? Yes<br/>- but not one hint on any Werckmeister-temperament, no example of<br/>any organ thus tuned is listed by Walther. So Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>frequent name being dropped by Walther doesn&apos;t mean anything,<br/>concerning the organ tempering practice.</p><p>&gt;  And take a listen to Armin Shoof&apos;s</p><p>Schoof, the organist of the Jakobi church L&uuml;beck<br/>- he is a friend of mine, and we are here happy in GOArt to bea<br/>able to cooperating with himn and his parisch St. Jakobi, in an<br/>EU-project from our institution to try to save the fabulous small organ (1467/1637) in L&uuml;beck, St. Jakobi, from lead corrosion which<br/>started to destroy the oldest layer of the pipework (1467)</p><p>&gt; performances of Buxtehude on Lubeck&apos;s St. Jacobi Kirche.</p><p>What is your opinion:<br/>How does a (Schoof&apos;s) performance *today* tell us anything about<br/>the actual temperaments to be found in (North German) organs in<br/>Buxtehude&apos;s and Werckmeister&apos;s time?<br/>And even if the Werckmeister temperament would unexpectedly have<br/>been heard from the organ in St. Jakobi in around 1700 in the<br/>organ(s) in St. Jakobi,  it would not mean, that the organ(s) in<br/>the neighbouring church St. Marien, where Buxtehude worked, must<br/>have had a well-temperament. Since, however, nothing points to a<br/>Werckmeister temperament in L&uuml;beck-Jakobi in Buxtehude&apos;s time,<br/>this example goes to the big bulk of unlikelinesses.</p><p>&gt; I will look into the St. Jacobi/Hamburg  info again...</p><p>The Reinitzer-book published at Hamburg: Christians, 1995<br/>contains some interesting info on the temperament discussion there<br/>in 1992-1993, and J&uuml;rgen Ahrend&apos;s comments on the findings in the<br/>pipework which was pure meantone. He has confirmend this to me in<br/>several conversations, already during the time, when he restored<br/>the instrument (which got then a modified 1/5 p.comma meantone<br/>temperament for some reasons - but that&apos;s a long story).</p><p>&gt; it was something in Walther, but I don&apos;t remember where.</p><p>Yes, thanks - would be nice if we could see evidence from Walther,<br/>which would be really something new!</p><p>Walther&apos;s Lexicon-entry on Schnitger for example is very short and<br/>fails therefore to mention any specific organ of Schnitger, not to<br/>speak of temperament, at all (in connection to Schnitger).<br/>Also Walther&apos;s entry on temperament is a short remark about<br/>terminolgy, pointing to handful of literature, among them<br/>Werckmeister, but also Printz, who was a true proponent of<br/>menatone temperament in organs. But I can&apos;t find any place in<br/>Walther&apos;s lexicon, where he explicitly describes any temperament,<br/>neither theretical, nor that it is to be found here or there.</p><p>Did I overlook something? - Of course this could happen.<br/>I would therefore appreciate if you could bring to the light where<br/>exactly (&quot;entry&quot;, page nrs.  in the facsimile) Walther mentions<br/>- Hamburg St. Jakobi<br/>- Werckmeister&apos;s temperament (and which of those)<br/>And Walther&apos;s quite long entry on Werckmeister doesn&apos;t state<br/>anything of what we have discussed here, either (except of a list<br/>of Werckmeister&apos;s publications).<br/>Ah, and he has an entry about Neidhart, too - but nothing on N.&apos;s<br/>temperaments. Neither anything concrete in any of the entries of<br/>other temperament-authors.</p><p>So I&apos;m really interested to know, where you found the specific<br/>info in Walther!</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Btw, watch out:  the authors in the regions concerned, from<br/>&gt; Werckmeister onwards (may be before already?) do not mix up<br/>&gt; well-temperaments and ET! The are clear and well aware about this<br/>&gt; point!</p><p>&gt; I do agree with this.
