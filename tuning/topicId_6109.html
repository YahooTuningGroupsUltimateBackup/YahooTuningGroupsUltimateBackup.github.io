I think the<br/>example of early European music is relevant because it shows that<br/>pythagorean intervals are sometimes preferred over 5-limit thirds and<br/>sixths, even in non-harmonized music.</p><p>Johnny: The Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq are plausibly descended from<br/>the Sumerians, at least in part. Cavalli-Sforza wants to do a genetic<br/>survey on them and other vanishing populations before it&apos;s too late.</p><p>As for the Turks, they may be descended in part from the Hurrians, but<br/>their language is Altaic and comes from Central Asia. It has no genetic<br/>relation to Sumerian; even the most extreme lumpers such as<br/>Shevoroshkin, Greenberg, and Ruhlen place Altaic in the same phylum as<br/>Indo-European and South Caucasian (Kartvelian). Sumerian appears to have<br/>no extant relatives, but some linguists think it might be related to<br/>Sino-Tibetan and North Causcasian (to which Hurrian might be distantly<br/>related). However, such remote relationships are not accepted by the<br/>majority of historical linguists.</p><p>Hungarians also claim that their language is related to Sumerian.<br/>Nonsense, it&apos;s related to Finnish, Estonian, Lappish, and a number of<br/>languages in Russian (Vogul, Zyrian, Cheremis?, etc.). These form the<br/>Uralic groups and they may be related to Indo-European in the Nostratic<br/>phylum along with Dravidian, Altaic, Kartvelian, Inuit,and some<br/>languages of Siberia. Or perhaps not.</p><p>One reason Turks, Hungarians, etc, claim relationship with Sumerian is<br/>that all these languages are agglutinative, as opposed to inflected like<br/>Latin, Hebrew, etc. or isolating like Chinese, English, Farsi, Otomi,<br/>etc. . Unfortunately, structural typology tells one nothing about<br/>genetic relationships. Swahili and Quechua are also agglutinating;<br/>Finnish and Estonian once were and are now fusional (aka inflecting),<br/>English and Chinese were once inflecting and are now isolating.</p><p>Sumerian may have been tonal; none of the Uralic or Altaic languages are<br/>to my knowledge or have been.</p><p>BTW, there is a recent claim that speakers of tonal languages have<br/>absolute pitch. I&apos;m dubious as tonal languages vary a lot as to how the<br/>tones are used. Some use tonal contour rather than tone height. In some<br/>languages, tone is grammatical, in others lexical.</p><p>As for the aulos, Greek sources say its intonation is notoriously<br/>unstable, a trait confirmed by discussions with Jim French and Lou<br/>Harrison. I don&apos;t doubt that one can play a 6/5 on a given aulos, but on<br/>another day, with another mouthpiece, by another performer,etc., the<br/>interval might be narrower or wider. I just don&apos;t believe Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger&apos;s claim that the aulos is a reliable pitch and scale<br/>standard (however interesting her system of harmoniai may be).</p><p>--John</p></div>
