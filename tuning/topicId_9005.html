On March 1, 1999, I posted my first message to<br/>the list, describing adaptive tuning work on a NeXT computer, real-time<br/>only.  Since then, I&apos;ve put the NeXT into a box and have worked on a PC,<br/>mainly doing &quot;leisure&quot; retuning - software that looks at a whole MIDI<br/>sequence to decide how to tune.</p><p>The tuning list has been informative, exasperating, funny, confusing,<br/>frustrating, dull (when topics are outside my areas of interest) and<br/>exciting, all in turn and all at once.</p><p>I know for certain that, without the feedback, good and bad, that I&apos;ve<br/>received during this year, I wouldn&apos;t be nearly as far along today, nor<br/>would have as clear an idea of where I still want to go.</p><p>To everyone who loves music as I do (and I take it for granted that this<br/>means everyone on the list), I say this: no matter how large or small<br/>your formal qualifications, go for your dream!!  If others are greater<br/>&quot;experts&quot; (self-appointed or by virtue of a wall full of diplomas), that<br/>means NOTHING compared to love and dedication.  Luckily, there are<br/>gratifyingly few list members who &quot;put on airs&quot;; most all of us offer<br/>our opinions labeled as such, and understand that tastes vary.</p><p>Alas, for the next few months I&apos;ll probably be terribly busy on other<br/>projects outside of my first love, music.  But I&apos;ll at least lurk, and<br/>occasionally throw in a comment or two.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
