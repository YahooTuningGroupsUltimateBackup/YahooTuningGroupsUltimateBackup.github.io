What a great CD!</p><p>Several of the pieces I had heard on the Tuning Punks, but there were<br/>several I had not heard.</p><p>This must have taken place about a year before I joined the Tuning<br/>List in 1999, maybe actually 2 years before since it took time to put<br/>it together.  Neil Haverstick really did a tremendous job and was<br/>obviously a great proponent of the lists back then.</p><p>This CD rather belies the sometime criticism that no &quot;real&quot; music<br/>comes out of this microtonal community...</p><p>I was wondering, though, about some of the people on the CD and<br/>whether they had actually taken part on Tuning List discussions back<br/>in the &quot;olden days...&quot;</p><p>How about Stephen James Taylor?</p><p>Warren Burt?  I know him, but was he really on the Tuning List??</p><p>Richard Sanford??</p><p>Denny Genovese (are you sure he isn&apos;t &quot;Microtonal Mafia...?&quot;) Was he<br/>actually a Tuning List participant?  (Brilliant piece, by the way...)</p><p>Carter Schloz?  I&apos;ve actually heard of him in the &quot;big composer<br/>world&quot; I believe.  Great piece.  Was he actually a list participant??</p><p>The others I know.</p><p>I guess I want to know if these people were &quot;offshoots&quot; of the<br/>community, or if they actually took part in discussions.  I guess it<br/>really doesn&apos;t matter, but I&apos;m rather curious if that was part of the<br/>criterion for inclusion by Haverstick on the CD.</p><p>Well, certainly Haverstick knows how to make something out of thin<br/>air!</p><p>J.
