I am under no illusion that I am going to<br/>get beatless consonance. I usually can&apos;t even get a single beatless<br/>tone. I&apos;ve written just-intonation pieces on an Akai sampler with only<br/>a 6-cent resolution and been happy as a clam. I think the only composer<br/>who is really looking for perfectly beatless consonances is La Monte<br/>Young, and he has an extreme synthesizer, extreme ears, and extreme<br/>patience. I don&apos;t. Since I appear to be taken as one of the main<br/>proponents of just intonation around here (and am complimented to be<br/>considered as such), I thought for the record I&apos;d list a few of the<br/>many reasons I work in just intonation.</p><p>1. I have never succeeded in finishing a piece with more than 31<br/>pitches in it. I don&apos;t see how Partch kept 43 pitches in his head. To<br/>get the accuracy I need for 7th and 11th harmonics, I need to be able<br/>to have pitches as close as 15 cents apart. To use an equal-tempered<br/>scale that would give me pitches that close would require more than 60<br/>pitches per octave, and I only have 128 pitches in my MIDI controls and<br/>61 keys on my keyboard. Just intonation gives me criteria for choosing<br/>only the pitches I need and leaving out all the rest.</p><p>2. I like the harmonic implications of fractions and ratios. I like<br/>knowing, when I use a 21/16 interval, that the upper pitch is an<br/>implied seventh harmonic of the dominant of the lower pitch. I like the<br/>way a 7/6 minor third not only has a different flavor than a 6/5, but<br/>also a different implied set of related pitches, so that it suggests<br/>ways to harmonize it. I like the way the numbers keep every pitch<br/>related to every other one in the system via a series of implied,<br/>interconnected harmonic series&apos;. The higher the numbers, the more<br/>exotic the pitch seems. That&apos;s an interesting thing to work with<br/>compositionally. No matter how dissonant and atonal you get, the<br/>gravitational pull of 1/1 keeps you oriented toward a fixed point in<br/>the universe.</p><p>3. I have never liked the concept of transposability. I don&apos;t like the<br/>way (and noticed this even as a child), in some of Mozart&apos;s piano<br/>sonatas, the theme sounds so perfectly placed as to register in the<br/>exposition, and then when it&apos;s transposed a fifth in the recap, it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound as good. I&apos;ve always instinctively agreed with Dane<br/>Rudhyar that to transpose a sonority is to diminish its absolute value<br/>as a sonic phenomenon and reduce it to a set of relationships. Even<br/>within the classical tradition, I tend to prefer composers who do not<br/>transpose material (Satie) to those who transpose all over the place<br/>(Schoenberg). I like the way Beethoven carefully limits his<br/>transposition levels in the Hammerklavier Sonata. Therefore, the<br/>universal transposability of sonorities in an equal-tempered scale<br/>holds no charms for me. It is actually a deficit.</p><p>4. Relatedly, I like having different-sized intervals available on<br/>different scale steps. It makes the scale have a &quot;natural&quot; feel to me,<br/>like I&apos;m carving a gnarly piece of wood instead of in smooth, mass-<br/>produced plastic. The material gives me feedback: I run up against<br/>things I can&apos;t do, keys I can&apos;t modulate to, and composing becomes a<br/>dialogue between me and the scale. I enjoy that. Perhaps I would also<br/>enjoy a nonequal, non-just-intonation scale, but I wouldn&apos;t know how to<br/>start making one. And why would I try?</p><p>5. I do like the sound of my music better when I can minimize beats,<br/>instead of having certain intervals (like thirds on the piano) pop out<br/>randomly with buzzing overtones. I frequently use intervals like 40/27<br/>to get beats, but I&apos;d prefer the beats be deliberate. Nevertheless, the<br/>fact that even my simple consonances are not exactly perfect has never<br/>once bothered me. I live in the real world, where nothing is perfect.</p><p>6. I have a tremendous natural talent for fractions and logarithms. It<br/>would be a shame to let it go to waste. I tell my students that if they<br/>don&apos;t have a good head for fractions and logarithms they should leave<br/>just intonation alone. It&apos;s not for everyone.</p><p>7. Not least, I am building on the work of four composers whose music I<br/>deeply love, Harry Partch, Ben Johnston, Terry Riley, and La Monte<br/>Young. I don&apos;t know of any other microtonalists working in any other<br/>kinds of scales whose music I love nearly so much. I wouldn&apos;t start<br/>working in 72tet or any other -tet unless I first heard some music in<br/>that scale that blew me away, on an emotional as well as technical<br/>level.</p><p>All these are not really separate reasons, but multiply interconnected.<br/>Just intonation, for me, represents the ability to use every note with<br/>an intense awareness of its harmonic interconnectedness with every<br/>other note. The theoretical harmonic purity of numerical relationships<br/>is the basis of that interconnectedness, but the ultimate sonic<br/>manifestation does not have to be pure for the composing process to<br/>have the intensity I love about it. As Ben always says, &quot;Better to have<br/>a perfect model and get an imperfect realization of it, than to have an<br/>imperfect model to begin with.&quot; Or as Charles Ives asked, &quot;What has<br/>sound got to do with music?&quot;</p><p>I have nothing against equal temperaments 19 and over, but I do<br/>consider them inefficient for my purposes. I love the sound of<br/>meantone, but it does pretty much limit you to triads. I prefer that<br/>classical repertoire be played in well temperament. Anything but 12tet.<br/>May a hundred thousand scales flourish.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2002 11:39:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;orangedoor190&quot; &lt;orangedoor190@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1.

You&apos;re right, I&apos;ve heard some really interesting<br/>non-equal scales in Arabic and Asian musics. I&apos;m a little theoretically<br/>inclined, so I can&apos;t quite imagine working with a tuning whose<br/>underlying principle I didn&apos;t develop myself to express some idea that<br/>intrigued me. But I get more intuitive as I get older, so maybe someday<br/>I&apos;ll pick up one of those scales and figure out how to compose with it.<br/>They sound great.

I often use this either to<br/>seek out the size of a ratio in cents, or the ratio(s) which a given<br/>tempered interval might most closely approximate -- or just to admire<br/>the continuum.</p><p>A curious dilemma I&apos;ve discussed in some recent posts is whether to<br/>call my approach to rational tunings JI and/or RI. Maybe I should<br/>explain a bit of my philosophy and typical neo-medieval style.</p><p>To me, a &quot;just&quot; tuning is one where the fifths and fourths, or at<br/>least most of them, have pure ratios of 4:3 and 3:2. This means that<br/>the complete usual stable concord of 2:3:4 is pure, and also such<br/>relative concords as 6:8:9 or 4:6:9.</p><p>In contrast, one of the charms of RI is that imperfect concords such<br/>as thirds and sixths may have a plethora of finely shaded ratios. For<br/>regular thirds, in addition to the traditional 81:64 and 32:27, there<br/>are also modern favorites such as 14:11 and 33:28, or 13:11 and 33:26.</p><p>In both RI and &quot;gently tempered&quot; systems, a &quot;just&quot; or &quot;near-just&quot;<br/>sound often implies some pure or near-pure ratios of 7 for imperfect<br/>concords: 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24.</p><p>These modern sounds illustrate a point made by David Doty: it&apos;s<br/>possible for a sonority to be quite &quot;concordant&quot; or blending in<br/>itself, and yet to resolve very effectively to a simpler concord such<br/>as the complete 2:3:4 or a fifth.</p><p>Most typically, both my RI and gently tempered systems involve two<br/>12-note chains of fifths placed at some convenient distance to<br/>generate a variety of melodic steps and intervals. The regularity of<br/>each chain makes it easy to find fifths and fourths, the primary<br/>stable concords, while combining notes from the two chains increases<br/>the variety of the system, both vertical and melodic.</p><p>Another engaging RI approach is to tune a kind of 17-note<br/>&quot;quasi-circle&quot; or &quot;orbit&quot; with most fifths pure, a few impure by a tad<br/>less than 5 cents, and a few more dramatically impure by up to a full<br/>64:63. Given the beauty and utility of a sonority such as Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s 16:21:24:28, the 64:63 in such a scheme becomes not merely an<br/>&quot;inevitable flaw&quot; but a valued adornment.</p><p>My purpose in writing this is to suggest how approaches to JI or RI<br/>can vary, and also that, at least to me, RI systems and gentle<br/>temperaments have many similar qualities, including both the regular<br/>chains or pure or slightly wide fifths, and the diversity of<br/>intervals.</p><p>Now for your reasons, some of which for me can apply to both types of<br/>systems:</p><p>   &gt; 1. I have never succeeded in finishing a piece with more than 31<br/>   &gt; pitches in it....</p><p>For me, 24 is a convenient number, and easy to map to two conventional<br/>&quot;regularized&quot; keyboards, each having the same arrangement of steps and<br/>intervals. In an RI scheme, each keyboard is in a standard Pythagorean<br/>tuning (Eb-G#), while in a gentle temperament the fifths are typically<br/>about 2 cents wide.</p><p>For me with 24 notes, as for you with up to 31, it&apos;s nice to be able<br/>to choose pitches so as to make fine distinctions: for example steps<br/>of 11:12:13:14, or nuances of color like 14:11 and 23:18, or 17:14 and<br/>11:9.</p><p>Here maybe I&apos;m experiencing a bit of a &quot;12th-century Renaissance&quot; a la<br/>Gothic Europe with the influence of ancient Greek and medieval Near<br/>Eastern systems favoring lots of different superparticular steps.</p><p>Either an RI system or a &quot;near-superparticular&quot; type of gentle<br/>temperament can realize or approximate this ideal, and I find the fine<br/>distinctions very engaging.</p><p>&gt;   2. I like the harmonic implications of fractions and ratios. I<br/>&gt;   like knowing, when I use a 21/16 interval, that the upper pitch is<br/>&gt;   an implied seventh harmonic of the dominant of the lower pitch....</p><p>At first blush, my reaction was, &quot;Isn&apos;t this more a reflection of<br/>Kyle&apos;s chosen tonal style than of JI or RI generally?&quot;</p><p>However, as someone oriented to modal or focal harmony (the latter<br/>based on the tendency of the major third to expand to a fifth and the<br/>major sixth to an octave, for example), I can come up with my own<br/>examples.</p><p>For example, how about the implications of an 81/56 above a given<br/>vertical center or &quot;local 1/1,&quot; the 7-based tritone which forms a 9:7<br/>with the 9/8 inviting very efficient expansion to a stable fifth.  For<br/>example, in reference to F as &quot;local 1/1,&quot; and using four-voice<br/>harmony in the modern fashion (14:18:21:24 to 2:3:4):</p><p>      E5 27/14   F5 2/1<br/>      D5 27/16   D5 3/2<br/>      B4 81/56   C5 3/2<br/>      G4  9/8    F3 1/1</p><p>There&apos;s also the beauty of those 28/27 semitones, and the 9/8<br/>whole-tone steps -- sometimes it&apos;s nice to be superparticular.</p><p>Also, this is more or less what is approximated in gentle temperaments<br/>in cadences involving &quot;near-7&quot; sonorities.</p><p>For me, RI leaves open the musical question of &quot;What&apos;s the center&quot; or<br/>the &quot;local 1/1,&quot; as I might call it, at a given moment -- sometimes an<br/>artfully ambiguous question in Machaut also, as Sarah Fuller has<br/>eloquently shown. However, either in a basic Pythagorean intonation or<br/>a 7-based version, for example, following the dance of ratios can add<br/>a measure of enjoyment to improvising, listening, and composing.</p><p>&gt;  3. I have never liked the concept of transposability. I don&apos;t like<br/>&gt;  the way (and noticed this even as a child), in some of Mozart&apos;s<br/>&gt;  piano sonatas, the theme sounds so perfectly placed as to register<br/>&gt;  in the exposition, and then when it&apos;s transposed a fifth in the<br/>&gt;  recap, it doesn&apos;t sound as good. I&apos;ve always instinctively agreed<br/>&gt;  with Dane Rudhyar that to transpose a sonority is to diminish its<br/>&gt;  absolute value as a sonic phenomenon and reduce it to a set of<br/>&gt;  relationships.</p><p>Here I might say that for me, _some_ transposibility can be quite<br/>desirable, but typically a basic 12-note gamut of Eb-G# (a typical<br/>14th-century European keyboard tuning) provides enough to get the<br/>regular cadences on the usual steps. Two such 12-note chains combine<br/>to provide intervallic variety, and often many of the benefits of<br/>transposibility such as a great range of available cadences.</p><p>For example, with two Eb-G# chains, I might not have a regular Db<br/>available for a cadence like Db4-F4-Bb4 to C4-G4-C5 with descending<br/>semitones, but often something like C*4-F4-Bb4 to C4-G4-C5 is very<br/>nice equivalent with 7-based or near-7-based ratios in a system with<br/>chains something like a 28:27 apart.</p><p>Having the tuning system call specifically for 7-based cadences at<br/>these locations is a touch of &quot;modal color&quot; that I like.</p><p>&gt;  4. Relatedly, I like having different-sized intervals available on<br/>&gt;  different scale steps. It makes the scale have a &quot;natural&quot; feel to<br/>&gt;  me, like I&apos;m carving a gnarly piece of wood instead of in smooth,<br/>&gt;  mass- produced plastic. The material gives me feedback: I run up<br/>&gt;  against things I can&apos;t do, keys I can&apos;t modulate to, and composing<br/>&gt;  becomes a dialogue between me and the scale. I enjoy that. Perhaps<br/>&gt;  I would also enjoy a nonequal, non-just-intonation scale, but I<br/>&gt;  wouldn&apos;t know how to start making one. And why would I try?</p><p>This is something my last example also touches upon, and which your<br/>present point suggested to me: the role of creative asymmetry in RI<br/>systems especially, and also to a degree in &quot;near-superparticular&quot;<br/>temperaments and the like.</p><p>To take a stronger example: I have a 12-note RI tuning where F-B are<br/>usual Pythagorean, and C# and G# are a bit different but musically<br/>equivalent -- but there&apos;s no F#. This means that one can&apos;t make a<br/>conventional cadence on G like A4-C#5-F#5 to G4-D5-G5 -- opening for<br/>me a beautiful alternative. I could use F4-G#5-C4 to G4-D5, with the<br/>middle voice descending (G#-G) by a pure 14:13 or &quot;2/3-tone&quot; of about<br/>128.30 cents. Here F4-G#4-C5 has thirds of 63:52 and 26:21, about<br/>332.21 cents and 369.75 cents (values courtesy of your octave.txt).</p><p>Here necessity was the mother of invention, and as a result I found<br/>myself looking for this kind of progression in other tuning systems<br/>where a usual cadence on G was also available. Of course, given my<br/>taste for &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; or &quot;semi-neutral&quot; thirds, I might have<br/>come up with this progression anyway -- and in fact I had used it now<br/>and then before. However, I usually had preferred a version with<br/>ascending 2/3-tones.</p><p>That special 12-note tuning had put the form with descending 14:13<br/>steps &quot;on the map,&quot; now a landmark I looked for (sometimes with a<br/>range of semi-neutral or neutral steps) in other systems also.</p><p>For me, the special charms of RI and near-superparticular systems<br/>don&apos;t exclude the beauties of a system like 29-tET, or the 12-note and<br/>24-note subsets I tune.</p><p>Using different kinds of intonational systems can be a refreshing<br/>change of pace -- not that I would want to imply than an exquisite<br/>tuning like 29-tET needs justification as merely a &quot;change of pace.&quot;<br/>The &quot;Pythagorean-like but just a bit different&quot; appeal, the delights<br/>of the regular and supraminor/submajor thirds, and those striking<br/>intervals in a 24-note tuning near 15:13, 13:10, and 26:15, etc., are<br/>something that gives this world of 29-equal its own integrity and<br/>special place.</p><p>At the same time, I&apos;d like to say also that the element of creative<br/>asymmetry comes to the fore in unequal well-temperaments also, for<br/>example George Secor&apos;s superb 17-note well-temperament. While 17-equal<br/>is a fine tuning in itself, look what variety George has achieved by<br/>some very artfully unequal temperament.</p><p>Here I&apos;ve replied to only some of your points, but hope that the<br/>sharing of perspectives that you&apos;ve invited will enrich this list, as<br/>your most eloquent post has already done.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2002 6:17:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

For<br/>&gt; regular thirds, in addition to the traditional 81:64 and 32:27, there<br/>&gt; are also modern favorites such as 14:11 and 33:28, or 13:11 and 33:26.</p><p>This is exactly what several of my pieces use JI for.

For<br/>&gt; example, in reference to F as &quot;local 1/1,&quot; and using four-voice<br/>&gt; harmony in the modern fashion (14:18:21:24 to 2:3:4):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       E5 27/14   F5 2/1<br/>&gt;       D5 27/16   D5 3/2<br/>&gt;       B4 81/56   C5 3/2<br/>&gt;       G4  9/8    F3 1/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s also the beauty of those 28/27 semitones, and the 9/8<br/>&gt; whole-tone steps -- sometimes it&apos;s nice to be superparticular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To take a stronger example: I have a 12-note RI tuning where F-B are<br/>&gt; usual Pythagorean, and C# and G# are a bit different but musically<br/>&gt; equivalent -- but there&apos;s no F#. This means that one can&apos;t make a<br/>&gt; conventional cadence on G like A4-C#5-F#5 to G4-D5-G5 -- opening for<br/>&gt; me a beautiful alternative. I could use F4-G#5-C4 to G4-D5, with the<br/>&gt; middle voice descending (G#-G) by a pure 14:13 or &quot;2/3-tone&quot; of about<br/>&gt; 128.30 cents. Here F4-G#4-C5 has thirds of 63:52 and 26:21, about<br/>&gt; 332.21 cents and 369.75 cents (values courtesy of your octave.txt).</p><p>Nice progression, the first one.

This article, hopefully, may make both the<br/>definition and the implicit stylistic setting and assumptions more<br/>clear.</p><p>Here I would like especially to thank Gene for a most helpful query<br/>suggesting that a bit of cultural and stylistic context could indeed<br/>make &quot;gentle temperaments&quot; more understandable; and also Jon for some<br/>general encouragement also playing a catalytic role in the writing of<br/>this article.</p><p>First of all, I would like to emphasize the point that &quot;terms of art&quot;<br/>such as &quot;gentle temperaments&quot; are descriptions in relation to specific<br/>styles. What sounds &quot;gentle&quot; in one cultural or stylistic setting<br/>could sound quite otherwise in a different style where different<br/>expectations apply.</p><p>For me, the term &quot;gentle temperaments&quot; refers specifically to the<br/>world of what I call &quot;common music&quot; (or _musica communis_), a kind of<br/>offshoot of the 13th-14th century styles of Gothic Europe influenced<br/>also by medieval Near Eastern musics and tuning systems.</p><p>In a different setting, for example a European Renaissance one calling<br/>for meantone as a norm, these same temperaments would likely seem<br/>anything but &quot;gentle&quot; -- they would represent, at least in many usual<br/>harmonic timbres, the right tuning system in the wrong place.</p><p>The main characteristics of &quot;gentle temperaments,&quot; with fifths<br/>tempered in the wide direction by about 1.49-2.65 cents, are about as<br/>follows:</p><p>        (1) Regular major and minor thirds are at or in the general<br/>            vicinity of 14:11 (~417.51 cents) and 13:11 (~289.21<br/>            cents).</p><p>        (2) Augmanted seconds and diminished fourths have sizes not<br/>            too far from 17:14 (~336.13 cents) and 21:17 (~365.83<br/>            cents).</p><p>        (3) Additionally, 24-note systems based on two 12-note chains<br/>            of fifths or (at the upper end of the range) a single<br/>            24-note chain often feature &quot;7-based&quot; intervals at or near<br/>            such ratios as 7:6 (~266.87 cents), 9:7 (~435.08 cents),<br/>            and 7:4 (~968.83 cents).</p><p>The favored ratios of 14:11, 13:11, 17:14, and 21:17 -- poetically<br/>known as the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; -- define the general region of<br/>gentle temperaments.</p><p>Here it is interesting that while the term &quot;gentle temperaments&quot;<br/>refers to the relatively mild compromising of fifths and fourths, it<br/>also implies a _minimum_ amount of tempering so as reasonably to<br/>approximate the Four Convivial Ratios -- about as in 29-EDO, with<br/>fifths around 703.45 cents (~1.49 cents wide).</p><p>The upper end of the region at around 704.61 cents (~2.65 cents wide)<br/>represents a point at which a single 24-note chain of fifths can<br/>provide a reasonably accurate approximation of 7-based ratios. The<br/>near-7:4 is virtually pure, while the near-7:6 is about 2.37 cents<br/>narrow, and the near-9:7 more imprecisely about 5.03 cents wide.</p><p>Another term for the region of gentle temperaments is the &quot;704-cent<br/>neighborhood,&quot; since this fifth size marks about the middle of the<br/>region, although the low end is actually slightly closer to 703 cents,<br/>and the high end to 705 cents.</p><p>In the lower and middle portions of the region, 7-based intervals are<br/>typically achieved by a 24-note system featuring two 12-note chains<br/>placed at a distance equal to the difference between a regular major<br/>second and a pure 7:6 minor third. This arrangement produces pure<br/>ratios of 7:6 and 12:7, with 9:7 and 7:4 (and likewise 14:9 and 8:7)<br/>impure by the same amount as the fifth.</p><p>A basic stylistic assumption of these gentle temperaments is that<br/>thirds and sixths are active intervals often resolving to stable<br/>sonorities involving primary stable concords such as fifths and<br/>fourths. Progressions featuring resolutions such as minor third to<br/>unison, major third to fifth, and major sixth to octave often define<br/>an efficiently directed verticality, as in the style of 14th-century<br/>Europe.</p><p>Also, timbres are chosen so as generally to fit a musical role for<br/>thirds and sixths as _relatively_ concordant and at the same time<br/>active and unstable. This aspect of &quot;gentleness&quot; can call for a bit of<br/>discretion.</p><p>What I would like to commnicate is that the world of _musica communis_<br/>has its own expectations and patterns, and that what is &quot;gentle&quot;<br/>within this world could be quite otherwise in another musical setting<br/>such as that of 16th-century or 18th-century European counterpoint,<br/>where fifths are customarily tempered in the _narrow_ direction. In<br/>each case, intonational form follows, or at least accords with,<br/>musical function.</p><p>A more technical discussion might approach gentle temperaments in<br/>terms of certain characteristic &quot;unison vectors&quot; such as 896:891,<br/>352:351, 364:363, and 10648:10647.</p><p>In more nontechnical terms, we might say that in these temperaments<br/>regular thirds represent ratios of 14:11 and 33:28 (~284.45 cents),<br/>and likewise 13:11 and 33:26 (~412.75 cents). Further, the same<br/>regular major third represents both 14:11 and 33:26, while the regular<br/>minor third represents both 13:11 and 33:28 -- ratios distinguished in<br/>just or rational systems.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, these equivalences distinguish a gentle<br/>temperament of _musica communis_ from a system such as 72-EDO, where<br/>there are comparably accurate representations of 3:2 and 14:11, for<br/>example, but where a regular major third at 400 cents is _not_<br/>identical to the best approximation of 14:11 at 416-2/3 cents.</p><p>Also, gentle temperaments contrast with just or rational systems in<br/>_musica communis_ providing ratios of 14:11, 33:28, 13:11, and 33:26,<br/>where some fifths are pure, but others impure by 352:351 (~4.93 cents)<br/>or 364:363 (~4.76 cents). The following diatonic scale illustrates<br/>such a system:</p><p>---------------- Scala file begins on next line of text --------------</p><p>! msdiat7.scl<br/>!<br/>Diatonic scale, symmetrical tetrachords based on 14:11 and 13:11 thirds<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 44/39<br/> 14/11<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 22/13<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>----------------- Scala file ended on blank line after &quot;2/1&quot; ---------</p><p>This scale, by the way, includes some intervals differing by the small<br/>superparticular ratio of 10648:10647, e.g. 13:11 (~289.210 cents) and<br/>968:819 (~289.372 cents), or about 0.163 cents. This ratio is equal to<br/>the difference between 352:351 and 364:363.</p><p>In such a rational system, some fifths are pure, while others are<br/>impure by almost 5 cents; in a gentle temperament, all regular fifths<br/>are equally and mildly impure by about 1.49-2.65 cents.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
