It&apos;s used for a wide range of maqamat, including all the<br/>common ones -- you&apos;ll see this happening if you look at any band that<br/>plays middle-eastern music and has a synth player. By &quot;17-tone<br/>scales&quot; you could be referring to either (a) the medieval Arabic<br/>tunings, which have nothing to do with modern Arabic music, or (b)<br/>some theorists&apos; description of Arabic music as using 17-tone equal<br/>temperament, which happens to be quite close to 24-tone equal<br/>temperament for the common maqamat.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=29893 href="#29893">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawier@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2001 12:09:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Paul, the tuning assignments were slight for most notes but close to<br/>quarter-tone for the neutral thirds.
