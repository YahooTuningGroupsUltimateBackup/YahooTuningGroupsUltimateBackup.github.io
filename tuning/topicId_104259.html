The temperament that works for me is to use as a generator 9/7 tempered downward by 1/3 of the unidecimal comma, period is 2. MOS&apos;s are at 8, 11 and 14 IIRC (I&apos;m currently using 14). It works out very near to closing at 14-edo, but the difference to my ears is significant because 3 sounds like heavy meantone and not like a dog fifth as it does in 14, and the 7:9:11 chords sound better to me than in 14. Similar sound to orwell.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t able to find this temperament in the Xenwiki so if anyone knows offhand what it is, lemmee know.

If you look at two 9/7s and an 11/9 in mothwellsmic, you can also call it a 9/7, a 14/11 and an 11/9, making it a tempered JI chord which you can call otonal or utonal, your choice. It&apos;s all the same, of course.

I don&apos;t know if this kind of chord deserves a tuning-list name. I mean, what harm did it ever do anyone? :-) Seriously though, maybe there should be a name for sonorities that split up 2 into three Just (or nearly Just) intervals to make an ambiguous sonority, if there isn&apos;t one already. This particular one conceals a leap of a (tempered) fourth if you move from voicing SLL to LLS, something I like.</p></div><h3><a id=104269 href="#104269">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2012 2:59:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The generator of hedgehog is too high, and squares is too low, but I&apos;m pretty sure it would qualify as some kind of 11-limit variation of squares.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is the undecimal comma 99/98?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might find squares or skwares interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mar 30, 2012, at 1:29 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been working on an atmospheric thing for an art video, and the central<br/>&gt; sonority is 2 divvied up into a pair of 9/7&apos;s and an 11/9 (tempered).
