In other words:  /6:/7:/9.</p><p>9:7, to me at least, has a kinda freaky sound, but I like it.  Or let me<br/>rephrase that:  I should say that I like it BECAUSE of its kinda freaky<br/>sound.  It doesn&apos;t strike me as discordant, but I have been able to use<br/>it as reasonably effective a dissonance, such as resolving outward to<br/>fourths.</p><p>One that I&apos;d like to experiment with is a JI version of what Ivor Darreg<br/>found so interesting in 17TET:  Resolving 9:7, which is could be thought<br/>of as an unsettled version of a major third, outward to 7:5, which is a<br/>very consonant tritone.  That would then be more or less the reverse of<br/>the traditional tritone resolution.  One could then resolve that outward<br/>to 5:3.</p><p>Clearly playing those pitches alone isn&apos;t all that difficult;  the<br/>interesting part is finding musically meaningful harmonic and contrapuntal<br/>frameworks to realize it within.</p></div>
