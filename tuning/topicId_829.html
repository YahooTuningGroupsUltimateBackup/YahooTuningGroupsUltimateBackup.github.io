My friend has a disc with Shosti&apos;s kid playing a few of the<br/>preludes and fugues, as well as the first piano concerto.  He played the<br/>latter so well I wasn&apos;t in any shape to judge the former.</p><p>&gt;I have hung an account of my current experiments in refretting a guitar:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/justguitar1.html">http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/justguitar1.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would be most greatful for any feedback from the esteemed company here.</p><p>Looks real good!
