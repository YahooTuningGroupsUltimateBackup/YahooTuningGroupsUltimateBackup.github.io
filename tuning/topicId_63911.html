I notice I&apos;d made two posts that seemed to agree with &gt; what Neil had said while I was offline.  I count that as a good sign :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt; What I seem to have is an unusual desire &gt;&gt;&gt; to persist with unfamiliar music until is stops sounding like a racket. &gt;&gt;&gt;  Maybe that&apos;s something we share, and have to expect from our<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt; listeners.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The music you make has to please and communicate with you first,<br/>&gt;&gt; before anyone else. All you can expect from listeners is a listen, and<br/>&gt;&gt; if the music you make is honest, you will find the right people who<br/>&gt;&gt; will like it. As to something we share, it certainly is a very small<br/>&gt;&gt; niche in the larger experience, and it probably isn&apos;t fruitful to<br/>&gt;&gt; expect masses of people liking the particular music that you (or I)<br/>&gt;&gt; happen to like. When I compose, I usually can&apos;t imagine others liking<br/>&gt;&gt; it (at least in the way that I do), and when positively received it is<br/>&gt;&gt; an awfully nice surprise.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree with your first point.  Solitary music making&apos;s an &gt; unusual, and maybe perverted activity.  Music&apos;s a part of a wide range &gt; of communal activities.  You can easily look at it as a tool for &gt; bringing people together.  If microtonality acts as a barrier between me &gt; and other people I know with an interest in music then it&apos;s a problem. &gt; It&apos;s a problem that goes to the heart of what music making should be about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OTOH, as I&apos;ve changed jobs and homes so much in the past few years, the &gt; largely online microtonal community is the most enduring one in my life &gt; beyond my family.  So that&apos;s worth thinking about as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt; How should we manipulate the context?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt; Well, I don&apos;t look at it that way, nor do I view my writing as<br/>&gt;&gt; composing in some way to justify the use of microtones. I use them<br/>&gt;&gt; when they seem like the only way to express what I want to express.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; I got interested in microtonality because I thought I could use it to &gt; make better music.  Because music&apos;s a subjective thing that means other &gt; people have to agree.  If microtonality&apos;s something that means people &gt; like my music less (i.e. it&apos;s worse in their subjectivity) then it&apos;s a &gt; waste of time.  If I thought I could make better music in 12-equal then &gt; I&apos;d do that.  It&apos;d be a lot less trouble.  Leave microtonlity as &gt; theory-only.  Or maybe produce microtonal music for my own pleasure and &gt; round everything off to 12 notes before I make it public.  I&apos;d much &gt; rather keep working on good microtonal music, so that it sounds better &gt; than anything I could have done otherwise.  That means I have to think &gt; about how people are actually going to hear it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt; It&apos;d be super if I could learn from the experience of my betters but I &gt;&gt;&gt; really don&apos;t know how other people have approached this problem.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt; I&apos;d say one would want to view music creation on a larger scale, and<br/>&gt;&gt; not simply &quot;how does everyone else make music out of microtones&quot;. If<br/>&gt;&gt; that is the only tack you take, it is probably going to sound just<br/>&gt;&gt; like the description, instead of an inevitable result of a creative act.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not interested in how people do it, but how they&apos;ve been successful &gt; in doing it.  How do you make explicitly microtonal music that a naive &gt; (but open minded) listener can understand on a first hearing?  Or, &gt; alternatively, how do you make microtonal music that sounds good?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are standard techniques in all the enduring classical traditions I &gt; know of that help listeners to understand the tonal structure of the &gt; music they&apos;re listening to.  And this usually assumes those listeners &gt; will be familiar with the particular style.  How much more important to &gt; make listeners understand an unfamiliar harmonic style!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt;&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt;&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; Yahoo!

Solitary music making&apos;s an &gt;&gt; unusual, and maybe perverted activity.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I don&apos;t know that&apos;s really the case, and I&apos;m speaking of just one<br/>&gt; activity: composing. There have been an awful lot of composers over<br/>&gt; the millenia, and rarely were they doing group efforts. I acknowledge,<br/>&gt; and take part in, a lot of other music activities, including<br/>&gt; improvisatory music that *does* occur with others. But to write music,<br/>&gt; in the quietude of one&apos;s environment, to be shared later, doesn&apos;t seem<br/>&gt; that perverted to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Music&apos;s a part of a wide range of communal activities.  &gt;&gt; You can easily look at it as a tool for &gt;&gt; bringing people together.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; If microtonality acts as a barrier between me &gt;&gt; and other people I know with an interest in music then it&apos;s a problem. &gt;&gt; It&apos;s a problem that goes to the heart of what music making should be<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you don&apos;t know for sure that it is the microtonality that is<br/>&gt; putting them off, do you? If the people you are concerned with<br/>&gt; reaching have 12tet as a lingua franca, the only way you are going to<br/>&gt; be allowed to fret (no pun intended) over your success is if you also<br/>&gt; managed to alienate (or bore) them with some 12tet music. Have you<br/>&gt; played them anything you wrote that *wasn&apos;t* microtonal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; OTOH, as I&apos;ve changed jobs and homes so much in the past few years, the &gt;&gt; largely online microtonal community is the most enduring one in my life &gt;&gt; beyond my family.  So that&apos;s worth thinking about as well.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; As you choose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; I got interested in microtonality because I thought I could use it to &gt;&gt; make better music.  Because music&apos;s a subjective thing that means other &gt;&gt; people have to agree.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Are *you* happy with the music you&apos;ve made?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; I&apos;d much &gt;&gt; rather keep working on good microtonal music, so that it sounds better &gt;&gt; than anything I could have done otherwise.  That means I have to think &gt;&gt; about how people are actually going to hear it.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Well, Graham, I guess we have to depart a bit: I honestly think you<br/>&gt; are selling short your own experience. It almost sounds like it is<br/>&gt; inconsequential as to whether you yourself enjoy the music, so long as<br/>&gt; it pleases others. That sounds like a recipe for profound regret, or<br/>&gt; at the very least a diminution of your talents into a common<br/>&gt; denominator market.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; How do you make explicitly microtonal music that a naive &gt;&gt; (but open minded) listener can understand on a first hearing?  Or, &gt;&gt; alternatively, how do you make microtonal music that sounds good?<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t have an answer. I have to say that, if your most<br/>&gt; enduring community has been this list (and derivatives), you may have<br/>&gt; been tainted by some of the thinking. I don&apos;t say that in a<br/>&gt; mean-spirited way, but if the entire or main focus of creating a piece<br/>&gt; is to explicitly thrust the microtonal nature of the fabric to the<br/>&gt; forefront, without considering the many other aspects of a<br/>&gt; communicative music, you are looking at a very small chance of<br/>&gt; pleasing people. &quot;These are microtones, eat them, they&apos;re good for you!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; How much more important to &gt;&gt; make listeners understand an unfamiliar harmonic style!<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; That makes a good question: just how much more *important*? Frankly, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t listen to music just for some harmonic content - that harmonic<br/>&gt; content is a servant in a bigger task.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might (I said _might_, I&apos;m not sure) find interest in reading the<br/>&gt; musings of people who are active in composition on a daily or regular<br/>&gt; basis, and just stand back and see how they approach some of your<br/>&gt; situations.

During improvisation, note<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; patterns are woven around these two notes. Vaadi and Samvaadi do not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily bear a fourth or fifth relationship with the fundamental.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; But they do bear such relationship between themselves. Let me give an<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; example:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Take a raga, say, Yaman. Sa Re Ga Ma# Pa Dha Ni. Here Ga is the Sonant<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and Ni is the Consonant. Neither has the fourth or fifth relationship<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; with Sa; but they have the fifth relationship between themselves.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; For a modulation to take place, Ga or Ni should be treated as the new<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental (Sa). But this never happens. If this were to happen, the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; intervallic relationship among the various notes would be changed, and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the raga would no more sound the same.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Haresh.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 12        &gt;    Date: Wed, 01 Feb 2006 13:16:45 -0500<br/>&gt;    From: David Beardsley &lt;<a href="mailto:db@biink.com">db@biink.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Composing the tiny notes (was Re: How do microtonal people hear?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Graham,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t agree with your first point.

I honestly have not investment with History being one way or the other. I am much more interested in the truth I do hope that such historical artifacts still persist and do believe that musical proof is proof that is valid. Maybe the influence is just Chinese then as normally assumed. But why would Hindus opt for Chinese tuning practices. Maybe it comes from Africa which has many of the same type of tunings.

It brings to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind things like the various well-temperament scales.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Inasmuch as a large amount of real repertoirs can be played<br/>&gt; &gt;adequately/sufficiently/recognizeably in a huge number of meantone,<br/>&gt; &gt;well- and equal tunings, yes.  But such scales -- designed as they are<br/>&gt; &gt;for polyphonic music, with voice-leading, and reiteration of a single<br/>&gt; &gt;modal type (major) -- would seem to exist under a larger number of<br/>&gt; &gt;constraints than a tuning system designed for a primarily monophonic<br/>&gt; &gt;context.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would srutis be &quot;ordered but not quantified&quot; if it were always true<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that 13 srutis gave something which serves as a fifth?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It depends upon the meaning of the word &quot;gave&quot; here.  If gave=sum up<br/>&gt; &gt;to, then I disagree, as we&apos;ve agreed that there is no single &quot;size&quot; of<br/>&gt; &gt;a shruti. But if, instead, it means simply that there are 12 pitches<br/>&gt; &gt;between Sa and Pa, then, yes. In other words, we&apos;re moving away from<br/>&gt; &gt;the sruti=interval idea (I assume that we already agree that there is<br/>&gt; &gt;no single size) and towards the shruti=pitch idea.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I think that the Carnatic 72-melakarta system might be relevant here.<br/>&gt; &gt; Although usually presented as a mapping onto 12 tones, it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;strike me as necessary to make such a mapping, and is probably<br/>&gt; &gt;misleading. The melakarta system describes 72 ragas, divided into two<br/>&gt; &gt;groups, the first with a standard Ma (fourth degree, F), the other<br/>&gt; &gt;with raised Ma (F#), otherwise the two groups are identical. The 36<br/>&gt; &gt;scales within a group given all six of the possible tetrachordal<br/>&gt; &gt;possibilities where Re (D) can be lowered, natural, raised or twice<br/>&gt; &gt;raised and Ga (E) can be twice lowered, lowered, or natural, but Re<br/>&gt; &gt;cannnot be higher than or equal to Ga multiplied  by the six<br/>&gt; &gt;possibilities for the upper tetrachord (Pa Dha, Ni Sa&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(i.e. all of the combinations of each of these:<br/>&gt; &gt;C Db Ebb F<br/>&gt; &gt;C Db Eb F<br/>&gt; &gt;C Db E F<br/>&gt; &gt;C D Eb F<br/>&gt; &gt;C D E F<br/>&gt; &gt;C D# E F<br/>&gt; &gt;with each of these:<br/>&gt; &gt;G Ab Bbb C<br/>&gt; &gt;G Ab Bb C<br/>&gt; &gt;G Ab B C<br/>&gt; &gt;G A Bb C<br/>&gt; &gt;G A B C<br/>&gt; &gt;G A# B C)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;One traditional presentation of the melacartas lines up the scales so<br/>&gt; &gt;that all the &quot;enharmonic equivalences&quot; (d=ebb, d#=eb etc.) are the<br/>&gt; &gt;same. Instead of accepting these are intonationally the same, perhaps<br/>&gt; &gt;it would be useful to note that no such equivalences are allowed in a<br/>&gt; &gt;tetrachord (e.g. no C D# Eb F) and this is due to use of a &quot;rule&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;disallowing microtonal melodic intervals in the scale (if the<br/>&gt; &gt;intonation was identical, then this would be a rule against<br/>&gt; &gt;redundancy, also interesting but not where I&apos;m going). We can then<br/>&gt; &gt;define a pitch in terms of order with some interesting precision: the<br/>&gt; &gt; lowered ga, eb, for example, is then a pitch higher than Db or D or<br/>&gt; &gt;Ebb, higher or lower than D#, and lower than E and F.  I&apos;m not certain<br/>&gt; &gt;how to sum up these ranges, but having said this, it strikes me that<br/>&gt; &gt;Gene&apos;s analogy is more right than I thought, in that, common practice<br/>&gt; &gt;repertoire is strict about scale order but does have a tolerance at<br/>&gt; &gt;the point of the enharmonic equivalences such that D# can sometimes be<br/>&gt; &gt;higher than Eb and vice versa, without affecting recognition.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But maybe this is all trivial...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Best,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;DJW</p></div><h3>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2006 6:42:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Also, I happen to have read reports about an ancient bone flute<br/>&gt; segment, estimated at about 43,ooo up to 82,ooo years old, at a<br/>&gt; Neanderthal campsite.</p><p>is that:<br/><a href="http://www.greenwych.ca/fl-compl.htm">http://www.greenwych.ca/fl-compl.htm</a><br/>with discussion:<br/><a href="http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/FluteDebate.html">http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/FluteDebate.html</a><br/>?</p><p>A.S.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2006 4:31:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Some mathematical features emerge without them.
