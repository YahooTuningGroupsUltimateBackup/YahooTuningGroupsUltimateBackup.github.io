I believe it shows one mans<br/>heartfelt frustrations with &quot;mother nature&quot; as a limiting, &quot;easiest to<br/>acquire&quot; notion, one that is often and easily flung round the<br/>imaginations neck - &quot;opus contra naturam&quot;:</p><p>&quot;Any art or habit of life, if it is limited chronically to a few<br/>processes that are the easiest to acquire (and for that reason are<br/>said to be some natural laws), must at some time, quite probably,<br/>become so weakened that it is neither a part of art nor a part of<br/>life. Nature has bigger things than even-vibration-ratios for man to<br/>learn how to use. Consonance is a relative thing (just a nice name for<br/>a nice habit). It is a natural enough part of music, but not the<br/>whole, or the only one. The simplest ratios, often called perfect<br/>consonances, have been used for so long and so constantly that not<br/>only music, but also musicians and audiences, have become more or less<br/>soft... If they hear anything but do-me-soh or a near cousin, they<br/>have to be carried out on a stretcher.&quot;</p><p>The wrap-up of his odd (eccentric even by Ivesian standards!) postlude<br/>to _114 SONGS_ culminates in a similar call to occasionally pass the<br/>door of physiology, &quot;to walk in a cave, on all fours,&quot; to &quot;try to<br/>scale mountains that are not.&quot;:</p><p>&quot;Some of the songs in this book, particularly among the latter ones,<br/>cannot be sung,--and if they could perhaps might prefer, if they had a<br/>say, to remain as they are,--that is, &quot;in the leaf,&quot;--and that they<br/>will remain in this peaceful state is more than presumable. An excuse<br/>(if none of the above are good enough) for their existence, which<br/>suggests itself at this point, is that a song has a *few* rights the<br/>same as other ordinary citizens. If it feels like walking along the<br/>left hand side of the street--passing the door of physiology or<br/>sitting on the curb, why not let it? If it feels like kicking over an<br/>ash can, a poet&apos;s castle, or the prosodic law, will you stop it? Must<br/>it always be a polite triad, a &quot;breve gaudium,&quot; a yellow ribbon to<br/>match the voice? Should it not be free at times from the dominion of<br/>the thorax, the diaphragm, the ear and other points of interest? If it<br/>wants to beat around in the valley, to throw stones up the pyramids,<br/>or to sleep in the park, should it not have some immunity from a<br/>Nemesis, a Rameses, or a policeman? Should it not have a chance to<br/>sing to itself, if it can sing?--to enjoy itself, without making a<br/>bow, if it can&apos;t make a bow?--to swim around in any ocean, if it can<br/>swim, without having to swallow &quot;hook and bait&quot; or being sunk by an<br/>operatic greyhound? If it happens to feel like flying where humans can<br/>not fly,--to sing what cannot be sung--to walk in a cave, on all<br/>fours,--or to tighten up its girth in blind hope and faith, and try to<br/>scale mountains that are not--Who shall stop it!</p><p>                 --In short, must a song<br/>                   always be a song!&quot;</p><p>My own personal feeling about this is that one of the great<br/>liberation&apos;s of an expanded intonational palette is having so many<br/>multiple interpretations of something as well-thumbed as say the major<br/>triad... to my ways of working and thinking, this was exactly why I<br/>was initially so fired up about the possibilities of &quot;microtonality&quot; -<br/>it seemed to really bode well for the possibilities of music...</p><p>I really don&apos;t see any reason why a strict fidelity to &quot;aural<br/>instincts&quot; would yield the same tuning results in one *musical<br/>paradigm* (composer, style, instrument types and combinations, etc.,<br/>etc.) as they would in another.

However, I would think that the point at which &quot;training<br/>ears&quot; and art diverge (I&apos;m hedging at using the word &quot;music&quot; here just<br/>because I think it&apos;s possible that it&apos;s literal meaning may not have a<br/>lot to do with &quot;art,&quot; and I&apos;m trying to draw a distinction right<br/>there) is a matter of some speculation... and just perhaps, given a<br/>particular situation, that training ears to listen to mother nature<br/>(and all the &apos;ideology&apos; that would be apt to go along with that<br/>process of learning) might not be the best solution when one is<br/>tackling another paradigm - say the tempering that is brought about by<br/>meantone (this would be an example that is also within the bounds of<br/>this thread, as I remember you questioning whether meantone wasn&apos;t<br/>just &quot;an inadequate &quot;stopgap&quot; temperament&quot;)... I guess this is sort of<br/>like an analogy of the early inventors who are trying to emulate<br/>nature in an attempt to master flight (where emulating nature -- i.e.,<br/>birds -- just wasn&apos;t the best model/mindset for the particular job at<br/>hand).</p><p>&gt;For about fifteen years, I hosted a weekly &quot;workshop&quot; in which<br/>excellent singers listened carefully for optimum tuning.</p><p>That sounds like great fun, and boy, I can think of some examples that<br/>I&apos;d just love to see what happens to with this approach...
