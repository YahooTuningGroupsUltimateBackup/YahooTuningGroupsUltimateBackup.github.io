I don&apos;t believe that<br/>at all.  Although there is an ad banner at the very top, there are no<br/>ads within the messages and, in fact, the interface is quite clean,<br/>not busy at all.</p><p>I&apos;m calling the list &quot;tuning&quot; rather than &quot;alternate&quot; tuning.  For<br/>*me* 12-equal is just as &quot;alternate&quot; as anything else, and I think<br/>tuning of *all* kinds should be discussed.  Of course, a theoretical<br/>discussion of the composition of music in 12-equal rather than the<br/>*tuning*, specifically would be OT.</p><p>So, anyway, here is the basic information, in case anybody is<br/>interested:</p><p>To send a message: <a href="mailto:tuning@topica.com">tuning@topica.com</a><br/>To subscribe: <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@topica.com">tuning-subscribe@topica.com</a><br/>To unsubscribe: See the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any<br/>message.</p><p>For more information about this list, visit:<br/><a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/tuning">http://www.topica.com/lists/tuning</a></p><p>The only thing I was disappointed in was a &quot;lattice&quot; test.  Yes,<br/>it &quot;scrunched&quot; them up like Yahoo does, so maybe links to Chris<br/>Bailey&apos;s Columbia list would be better for that.</p><p>But as far as Web posting is concerned, I believe *Topica* is *far*<br/>superior to Chris&apos; list, and would be far easier to use.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Well, if no one is interested it will just sit there, as so many<br/>lists do.  If anybody is interested, they will use it, and that&apos;s the<br/>way it *should* be!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
