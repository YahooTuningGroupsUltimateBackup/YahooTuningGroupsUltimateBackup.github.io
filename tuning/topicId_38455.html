Surely you would have an<br/>informative input. If you ever felt inclined to share your views with me, either in<br/>this public forum or in private, I&apos;d be very interested. If you prefer not to, then I&apos;ll<br/>respect that, too. (Though in that case I am curious about what sorts of things you<br/>are telling *other* people, such as my friends Mat and Christine. Something about<br/>me not accepting other approaches to microtonality, or not accepting ethnic<br/>music? Hmm...)</p><p>-Julia</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Yep, it sure is hot.  Woke up with a headache at 7 AM took 3 aspirin and<br/>&gt; surfaced again at noon.  Whew.
