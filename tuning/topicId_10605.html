I&apos;m under the impression you have not.<br/>I suppose I should flesh out this part of the webpage a bit<br/>to give a clearer explanation.  I&apos;ll make a first attempt at<br/>it here.  But be warned that the last time I looked at Lentz&apos;s<br/>book was last year - I&apos;m recalling it here to the best of my<br/>ability, but there&apos;s certainly a chance that it&apos;s a bit inaccurate.<br/>Anyone who has a copy handy is invited to comment further on what<br/>I say here; by all means, please correct any errors.</p><p>Lentz explains that the tuning would have been physically<br/>arrived at by 2 series of &apos;4ths&apos; and &apos;5ths&apos; above the reference<br/>pitch: one series being 3^(1...11) and the other being 3^(-1...-10),<br/>and (usually) alternating &apos;4ths&apos; and &apos;5ths&apos; to keep all tones<br/>within one &apos;8ve&apos;. This gives a system of 22 tones, with a 3/2<br/>between the reference pitch and its &apos;5th&apos;, and a Pythagorean<br/>comma between the other 10 pairs of chromatic notes.</p><p>*Then*, after explaining this, he blithely states (in different<br/>language than that which I use here) that his table of the<br/>resulting ratios has been simplified by changing the larger-exponent<br/>Pythagorean ratios into their comma-equivalent 5-limit JI cousins.</p><p>IIRC, The actual tuning doesn&apos;t really penetrate much further into<br/>Lentz&apos;s discussion of Indian music after that; he points out<br/>the difference sizes of &apos;semitones&apos;, but doesn&apos;t give any<br/>kind of specific accounting of their uses in any specific<br/>scales or modes.</p><p>Therefore, it&apos;s not clear to me whether he really means to<br/>describe the Pythagorean system resulting from the prescribed<br/>tuning method or the 5-limit system given in his table.  He<br/>generally speaks of the ratios in terms of the latter, but a<br/>feeling keeps gnawing away at me that his real focus should have<br/>been the Pythagorean system he originally described.  That&apos;s why<br/>I say that the real difference between the paired srutis is the<br/>Pythagorean (and not the syntonic) comma.</p><p>As I state in my webpage, altho there is apparently no evidence,<br/>I think it&apos;s entirely possible that musicians in ancient India used<br/>an extended system tuned by ear in Pythagorean ratios, and then<br/>used the concept of schismatic substitution in order to incorporate<br/>Pythagorean ratios which closely approximated 5-limit ones, to<br/>provide subset scales in pseudo-5-limit-JI.  But the actual<br/>ratios still would have been Pythagorean.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m also willing to allow that over a (relatively<br/>short?) period of time, good musicians could have gotten to the<br/>point where they altered the tuning of those schismatic<br/>substitutions by ear so that they really *were* 5-limit ratios.</p><p>Then, going back to my reference to the recent Tuning List<br/>postings, there&apos;s also the observation that the interval between<br/>3^-7 (= ~1086 cents) and 3^7 (= ~114 cents) is ~ 973 cents,<br/>pretty darn close to a &apos;harmonic 7th&apos; of ~969 cents.  With<br/>this sound available in their tuning system, I have no problem<br/>extrapolating the data to reach the assumption that the ancient<br/>Indian musicians also could have used 7-limit (or Pythagorean<br/>pseudo-7-limit) ratios in their music.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
