This<br/>&gt; &gt; is truly one of Erv&apos;s most amazing visual models.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this on the net?</p><p>Last time I looked it wasnt yet.<br/>Kraig says he&apos;s working on it.<br/>When it does show up, it&apos;ll be in _The Wilson Archives_ at:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>It&apos;s nowhere near as dazzling as some of<br/>Erv&apos;s later more angular lattices, but<br/>it summarizes all the important harmonic information at one shot,<br/>excepting prime-factorization (if that *is* important).<br/>Altho, it&apos;s easily modified to prime just by<br/>ignoring all the composite rungs.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Now this is the hard part; taking account of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tolerance in chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suggest that everyone be very cautious about disallowing<br/>&gt; &gt; the relevance of prime-factorization when they embark on this<br/>&gt; &gt; task.  I&apos;m convinced that it plays a major part when<br/>&gt; &gt; considering pitch-sets of more-than-two distinct notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, Joe, it&apos;s _relative_ primality that is of concern here,<br/>&gt; not primality itself.</p><p>What exactly is the difference between<br/>relative primality and primality itself?</p><p>The only thing I&apos;ve been saying all along<br/>about the importance of primes in music<br/>is that they allow us to view the musical pitch material<br/>in its ultimately reduced and simplified form.</p><p>(and also that I think the lowest primes<br/>carry quasi-unique audible information<br/>- I say quasi because of the effect of bridges)</p><p>This reduction implies to me<br/>a blurring of the distinction over relativity.</p><p>Primality itself provides the underlying framework<br/>of the whole musical structure,<br/>thru which differing perspectives may be taken<br/>and by which the relative distinctions can therefore be seen.</p><p>Getting back to where I was going before,<br/>the problem I have over prime-vs.-odd is:<br/>how to account for the harmonic spiral without separate odd rungs<br/>because harmonics do seem to imply an odd-limit.</p><p>However, my recent findings suggest that<br/>triangular connections are just as important<br/>in chord-formation and -recogition<br/>as harmonic connections.<br/>(more on this in my next post)</p><p>&gt; Joe Monzo wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Inasmuch as all the different lattices and tonal systems<br/>&gt; &gt; we have been considering with this topic are based on<br/>&gt; &gt; an implicit assumption of a 1/1, they are all Monophonic<br/>&gt; &gt; (in the Partchian sense), and therefore *ALL* ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; are in one sense theoretically one rung away from 1/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Partch himself only considered ratios within the 11-odd-limit to<br/>&gt; be one rung away from 1/1 -- accounting for 29 of his pitches.<br/>&gt; The other 14 were explicitly built on other ratios and considered<br/>&gt; inharmonic with respect to 1/1.</p><p>Yes, this is true - thanks for expanding what I said.<br/>The 14 new additional intervals outside the 11-odd-limit diamond<br/>were added mainly by extension of the powers of 3<br/>to all boundaries of the lattice, symmetrically in both directions.</p><p>This did make them inharmonic with 1/1, altho<br/>they are closely related because they are basically<br/>!*triangular*! connections to the bounding ratios.</p><p>Also, Partch used more or less than 43 tones at times,<br/>so he was inconsistent with regard to, or at least<br/>did not restrict himself to, this particular system.</p><p>But my point was that<br/>at least for a substantial number of pitches under consideration<br/>in any given system,<br/>there is *in this one sense* a direct connection to 1/1,<br/>and *that should be taken into account in the formulae*<br/>when considering tri[+]ads.</p><p>As I hinted a few paragraphs ago,<br/>I think more direct connections among lattice-points<br/>of *various different exponents and primes*<br/>is a reasonable model of at least some examples of<br/>harmonic/melodic  practice.  As I promised,<br/>there will be more on this in my next post.</p><p>&gt; Partch&apos;s one-footed bride<br/>&gt; (which is designed to be octave-equivalent,<br/>&gt; except for the one &quot;foot&quot;)<br/>&gt; implies that he considered the consonance of ratios to decrease<br/>&gt; as their odd limit increased up to 11,<br/>&gt; and beyond that he considered all ratios equally dissonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first part of that points to<br/>&gt; my version of the Hahn-Lumma-Erlich algorithm,<br/>&gt; with declared odd limit of 11,<br/>&gt; implying a 5-dimensional lattice (3, 5, 7, 9, 11) with redundancies<br/>&gt; or a 4-dimensional lattice (3, 5, 7, 11) with wormholes.</p><p>OK - I understand the redundancies of the odd lattice,<br/>but what are the wormholes<br/>in this particular example of the prime lattice?</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking of the wormholes<br/>in terms of the xenharmonic bridges between primes.<br/>It sounds like you mean something different by it.</p><p>- monzo<br/>  <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>------------------------<br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2197 href="#2197">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The advantage of using primes is that each note<br/>appears in one and only one place; the disadvantage is that you have to<br/>imagine the ratio-of-9-connections to have shorter lengths than are actually<br/>possible to depict visually. This can lead to a lot of confusion, in fact it<br/>led me to a major error in my paper, where the whole speculation about the<br/>22 srutis coming from &quot;resonances&quot; with the drone notes is irrevocably<br/>messed up, due mainly to my failure to notice that 11:9 is a direct<br/>connection in the 11-limit lattice.</p></div>
