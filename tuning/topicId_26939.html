It uses the conventional<br/>EADGBE open string tuning. The guitar is 5-limit JI only.</p><p>Sabat-Garibaldi wished to have both accurate Pythagorean (3-limit JI) and<br/>accurate Ptolemaic (5-limit JI) diatonic scales and to be able to modulate<br/>them widely. See<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/drew_skyfyre/xe/dinarra.html">http://members.nbci.com/drew_skyfyre/xe/dinarra.html</a></p><p>He rediscovered schismic temperament (where an octave-reduced chain of 8<br/>perfect fourths gives a major third). He used the 5-limit MA optimum<br/>generator, i.e. the generator which gives the minimum value for the maximum<br/>of the absolute errors of all 5-limit intervals. This is a fourth widened<br/>by 1/9 of the schisma, or equivalently a fifth narrowed by 1/9-schisma<br/>(701.738c). A schisma is 32805/32768 = 2^-15 * 3^8 * 5^1 ~= 1.954 cents.</p><p>1/9-schisma temperament _is_ just. It has precise 5:6 minor thirds and has<br/>fifths and major thirds which are only 0.2 c narrower than 2:3 and 4:5.</p><p>In case you were wondering, it has a max 7-limit error of 7.1c. The best<br/>7-limit schismic temperament occurs with a 2/15-schisma _wide_ fifth, where<br/>the max error is 4.3c. Not a microtemperament.</p><p>Numbers of notes for MOS are  5 (7) 12 (17 29 41) 53 (65) 118 ...</p><p>Sabat-Garibaldi chose to use 53 frets to the octave on his guitar (called<br/>the Dinarra (pron. Deenarha)). He went to extraordinary lengths to obtain<br/>accurate fret placement. I suspect this was largely a waste of time.</p><p>Given the limitations of even the best acoustic instruments, I doubt<br/>whether even Johhny Reinhard could tell by listening to music played on it,<br/>whether such a guitar was fretted for 1/9-schisma or 53-EDO, unless a<br/>53-of-1/9-schisma &quot;wolf&quot; was played (7.7c wide). 53-EDO is approximately<br/>1/29-schisma and has 0.1 c error in the fifths and 1.4c and 1.3c errors in<br/>the major and minor thirds. The question of whether the chain of fifths is<br/>open, or closed at 53, is not likely to be answered by modulation in any<br/>ordinary piece of music.</p><p>Which brings me to the other thing I would have done differently, which is<br/>to stop at 29 notes. Even a 5-limit melodic minor only spans 19 generators<br/>and so 29 notes would allow its modulation through 9 different keys (majors<br/>would have 17 keys available). Why anyone would feel that modulation<br/>through 33 different keys was so desirable as to justify putting 53 frets<br/>per octave on a guitar, is beyond me.</p><p>Although the 29 fret version would have the same minimum fret spacing<br/>(20.9c) the larger spacings of 70.5c (as opposed to 28.7c for 53 frets)<br/>would give more guidance as to finger placement and there would be only<br/>half the work in building it.</p><p>That said, there is some very lovely music on that web page.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2001 11:42:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Why anyone would feel that modulation<br/>&gt; through 33 different keys was so desirable as to justify putting 53<br/>frets<br/>&gt; per octave on a guitar, is beyond me.</p><p>I hadda thort.</p><p>Maybe he wants 53 notes to the octave, not for modulation, but for<br/>_comma_drift_.

I wonder why anyone would bother with that division when 53<br/>&gt; works so wonderfully well?</p><p>The 53-division has some serious problems for common-practice music.<br/>The whole tone comes in two sizes, which is rather awkward<br/>melodically. Even more awkward are the &quot;comma-pump&quot; progressions like<br/>C-Am-Dm-G-C and C-F-Dm-G-C. If you try to use good voice leading, the<br/>final C chord is a comma lower than the initial C chord. The<br/>alternative is to have at least one tone, usually D, shift by a comma<br/>in the middle of the progression. This type of &quot;correction&quot; has a<br/>disturbing effect, smacking of poor intontation (melodically, not<br/>harmonically). A good, experienced choral group singing in adaptive<br/>JI will spread the comma over all four chord changes, so that it<br/>passes unnoticed, and there are no full-comma shifts or drifts.</p><p>The 55-division was never used in full, but was merely a convenient<br/>way of describing a meantone tuning (whose advantages we are all well<br/>aware) close to 1/6-comma meantone in the 18th century.<br/>Instrumentalists (including Mozart), especially string and wind<br/>players, were taught that the whole-tone was 9 parts (this applies to<br/>_all_ whole-tones, not just the &quot;major&quot; ones as in 53), the diatonic<br/>semitone was 5 parts, and the chromatic semitone 4 parts. Thus the 55-<br/>division was used as a system of reckoning, not as a practical tuning<br/>for instruments.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>8/14/2001 1:04:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow!

As a simplification, it&apos;s often stated that string<br/>players use Pythagorean tuning -- though when the pitches are<br/>measured, the typical result is much too varied to be pinned down to<br/>anything as rigid as Pythagorean or 12-tET. It&apos;s fair to say, though,<br/>that anything resembling just thirds is the exception rather than the<br/>rule in classically-trained string players today.

The whole thing about leading tones needing<br/>to be so skinny really irritates me, though! That whole idea flies<br/>directly in the face of good intonation, and it&apos;s a common idea among<br/>string players. Yuck!</p><p>I&apos;m a violinist of sorts, although I truly hesitate to say it these<br/>days. In spite of my lack of virtuosity, however, I do tend to play<br/>justly tuned double and triple stops, and in baroque music it is not<br/>so unusual to find chord sequences where the comma is right in your<br/>face as in the example I gave. It doesn&apos;t really bother my ear to<br/>shift the comma melodically like that, which you MUST do in so many<br/>instances on the violin, but it DEFINITELY bothers my ear to fail to<br/>make the shift and leave the harmony out by a comma.

Though 6 tones in the Octave multiplied by 9 commas<br/>equals 54, the case of the Dinarra is different. The  systematic of the<br/>Dinarra is Pithagoric (with some peculiarities), thus I count 5 tones<br/>of 9 commas each (45) plus 2 semitones of 4 commas each (8), resulting<br/>53 commas.<br/>These 53 commas are enclosed in 54 notes in the Octave but the first and<br/>the last notes have the same note-name (one duplicate the frequency of<br/>the other).<br/>The 53 notes are defined by a row of 52 fifths. This row of fifths I<br/>call<br/>Estructura Pitagorica. By comparison the Diatonic Pithagorean Structure<br/>is formed by a row of 6 fifths that make 7 note-names that are closed<br/>in the 8 notes per Octave.<br/>The semitonic scale is formed by 11 fifths, and has 12 note-names closed<br/>in 13 notes per Octave. Therefore, the Dynamic Scale (Gama Dinamica) is<br/>formed<br/>by 52 fifths, has 53 Omega Notes (or Dynamics Notes) that are closed in<br/>54 notes per Octave.<br/>I didn&apos;t use above the term Cromatic Pithagoric Scale instead of<br/>&quot;semitonic&quot; because this name is reserved for the scale of 21<br/>note-names.(According with &quot;La Gamme&quot; by Richard P., France, and some<br/>comments made in this list a time ago).</p><p>My question is the following: &quot;is number 54 as I use it the same as your<br/>?<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>To Johnny,<br/>Quote &quot;So, it is like the French system, with 9 commas to the<br/>equal-tempered whole tone.&quot;<br/>Unquote: I nodded yes.</p><p>But please excuse me if I wrongly nodded yes.

(i.e. 16/15, 8/5, 6/5 and 9/5  are by fifths).<br/>In my files I must have the list of the numbers that I copyrighted.<br/>But in those times I said &quot;if I would  know the deep reason of 5 and 3 I<br/>might do a complete arrangement by commas&quot;, because  in those moments<br/>and now I thought and think that the rational scale of the future must<br/>be by commas.</p><p>The system you propose of 29 notes is interesting but in my opinion the<br/>future is waiting for new news.<br/>Try  to make a design for a Dinarra-29. I am sure you will note that<br/>there must be<br/>some or many uncompleted frets, and in order to make an arrangement of<br/>an all<br/>complete frets you must arrive to a design by commas.</p><p>&gt;Blackjack and Canasta are not intended for playing music in the<br/>&gt;standard western major and minor scales.

This is exactly what was happened during the concert, even<br/>if<br/>one of the background-guitars had an E-string which didn&apos;t stop to slip<br/>away. Eduardo&apos;s guitarist mainly played latin-jazz standards, I think<br/>there<br/>was even The Girl from Ipanema.</p><p>The guitar itself was not really difficult to play. It had extremely<br/>heavy<br/>strings, which made it impossible to play bends. However, it didn&apos;t<br/>mater<br/>how narrow the space was between two frets. The string picked it up<br/>always<br/>very neatly. So it felt almost like a fretless guitar with a very good<br/>sustain, no special electronic devices needed, just the clean sound,<br/>straight from the pick-up. I don&apos;t think you get lost on this guitar.<br/>With a<br/>good background harmony, your ears tell you where to go and you don&apos;t<br/>really<br/>need to look at your fingers.
