Some of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; them aren&apos;t even that occult.  Some are quite exoteric except<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that its so buried that it will never be found until I blurt it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; out but I won&apos;t blurt it out here because these are mystical<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; secrets about the the Lambdoma and that&apos;s a religious artifact<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that should be carefully delivered lest I get shot by a religious<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fanatic.  The whole subject is so obscured by mysticism that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; looney zealots are a very real scare.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; right . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you actually ever run the circle of fifths around and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; around until they made an octave?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;circle of fifths&quot; never closes perfectly, but it comes close<br/>&gt; &gt; after 53, closer after 665, etc . . . see Paul Hahn or Kees van<br/>&gt; &gt; Prooijen&apos;s tables.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Troubledoor, I questioned you privately a few days ago about<br/>&gt; this &apos;ideal 71-tone Pythagorean scale&apos;, asking you why the limit<br/>&gt; at 72 tones, and what makes it &apos;ideal&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m willing to remain open-minded enough to consider some of<br/>&gt; the things about which you&apos;ve posted - indeed, I often skate<br/>&gt; dangerously close to mysticism myself in a lot of what I write.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But your answer then sounded like so much occult mumbo-jumbo<br/>&gt; that I wanted to wait awhile before responding; I see that<br/>&gt; much of the same is being used to answer publicly here.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hardly used any mumbo-jumbo.  I&apos;m sorry,  I&apos;m just trying to avoid the issue and the facts.<br/>As soon as I get to the websites that Paul Ehrlich directed me to, I can speak in a more cagey<br/>and unspecific manner so that I seem to talk about something useful.  Really though....I went<br/>insane for 5 years and got locked up in a hospital and I go for therapy sessions weekly and I<br/>take anti-psychotic medication because there is a great chance for error in mixing music with<br/>mystic philosophy---which actually happened in my case.  When you make mistakes in mysticism,<br/>the price is very heavy.  So you can see why I try to dance around the issue.  I&apos;ll be more<br/>useful in the coming year because the 72 tone theories are where I am headed.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In addition to the sources cited by Paul, take a look at this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/Pythagorean-cycle.gif">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/Pythagorean-cycle.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The number of &apos;5th&apos;s in the cycle appears across the bottom as<br/>&gt; the x-axis, and the y-axis shows the &apos;octave&apos;-reduced Semitone<br/>&gt; value (Semitones to 2 decimal places show the same thing as<br/>&gt; cents, with the 12-tET degree isolated before the decimal point.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can see clearly that 12 &apos;5ths&apos; come fairly close to an<br/>&gt; &apos;octave&apos; (~23 cents higher, the &apos;Pythagorean comma&apos;), and that<br/>&gt; 53 &apos;5ths&apos; come a whole lot closer (only ~4 cents higher), while<br/>&gt; 72 is, as Paul said, more than a semitone away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next closer values, which didn&apos;t make it onto my graph, were<br/>&gt; 306 &apos;5ths&apos; and 359 &apos;5ths&apos;, which are ~2 cents lower and higher,<br/>&gt; respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I agree with Paul that 72-tET is a good intonational<br/>&gt; resource, the only value I can see in choosing 72 as a limit<br/>&gt; in a Pythagorean tuning is that it makes available all the<br/>&gt; smaller subsets, like 36, 24, 18, and 12... IMO, this still<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t make it all that valuable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No ancient who bothered to either calculate any of this math<br/>&gt; or listen to the result would have had any reason to deliberately<br/>&gt; chose a 72-tone *Pythagorean* scale.  I suggest you re-evaluate<br/>&gt; the ideas you&apos;re developing in regard to this &apos;ideal scale&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS - Where you wrote &apos;exoteric&apos; you meant &apos;esoteric&apos;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I meant to say exoteric.  They are popular books too.  But it&apos;s all hidden.   I&apos;m pretty sure<br/>that the 72 tone thing is for the purpose of memory.  They are idealizing a way to map the<br/>mystic trips of sound.  I currently have no way to test this theory right now because I haven&apos;t<br/>contacted the inner realms of sound for a long time.  When you do yoga you literally hear a<br/>celestial music that carries you to the planets of Pythagorus and then onward to heaven.  This<br/>was the subject of most of alchemy.  It&apos;ll take me a long time to get there again because I&apos;m<br/>currently pursuing other matters.  72 is what fits in the RATIONAL philosophy of geometry.  It<br/>is called &quot;sacred-geometry&quot; officially and is based on The Golden Section and the angles of the<br/>pentagram or starfish.  I suspect the reason they insist on the Golden Section is that it<br/>instantly invokes the pentagram and that is the easiest image to remind one of The Highest God<br/>when the mind is in trouble with Wisdom (philo-Sophia) tripping.  So from the pentagram one has<br/>to go to the 72 tones.  It&apos;s the only thing that will stick in the mind-----in the RATIONAL<br/>mind that is.  A natural musician&apos;s ear might reject all this.  I won&apos;t ever know because I<br/>don&apos;t have a gifted ear.  So I use philosophy to break into the secrets of musical skills.  At<br/>least I&apos;m not using voodoo or witchcraft to practice guitar.  Although, I am not beyond that<br/>and I&apos;ve even begun to practice a Chinese form of witchcraft and with this I plan to attempt<br/>another go at perfect pitch or absolute pitch.  I basically want to play music better than the<br/>birds.  I am very envious of the neighborhood birds.  Little bastards just spew out microtonal<br/>scales all day and it makes me mad cause I have to work hard just to get a damn pentatonic<br/>scale out.</p><p>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

So he is going to get the numbers<br/>really big because he can&apos;t &quot;see&quot; when he has exceeded the visual/aesthetic<br/>threshold.  The goal as I see it is to make a visual representation that is easy<br/>for the memory and the memory can easily store the Platonic solids so they<br/>should never be left out.  I&apos;m sure that Paul Ehrlich&apos;s theories and Monzo&apos;s<br/>already suffice for this purpose just that people like it when the theories have<br/>a religious connotation because people trust that God is perfect and that<br/>therefore He is also rational so therefore, music should be rational too.  The<br/>Chinese already had this in China many 1000s of years ago.  They have 6 &quot;wings&quot;<br/>or classics.  The I Ching (Book of Changes) is one of them.  The Book of Music<br/>was unfortunately completely wiped out in their Imperial burning of books.   My<br/>guess is that the book was a 72 tone graphic representation of microtonal<br/>music.  So, back then, everyone already knew about it and no one thought to<br/>write about it because everyone knew about it.  Then one day, the original books<br/>were all burned and then suddenly the Dark Ages fell upon mankind (first in<br/>China and then in Europe)  and then there was already no hope for ever finally<br/>recording the Book of Music and so we have horrible pop music today because the<br/>document was completely lost from collective memory.  It&apos;ll slowly be<br/>reconstructed again based on the quaternary I Ching (16 tone increments<br/>hieroglypically represented) I rediscovered and using Schoenberg&apos;s tone row<br/>method.  It&apos;s so cheesy and simple really.  Just that it is going to spark a lot<br/>of controversy because it implies a holographic theory of universe so<br/>self-evident that even children can understand it.  And no one wants to expose<br/>children to the dangers of mysticism so the subject will forever get buried,<br/>again and again.  A holographic theory of the universe would end history because<br/>we would all start taking drugs all day.  Mostly because people would have such<br/>huge headaches from marvelling at how ordered the creation is.  They would need<br/>to medicate themselves constantly.  No one wants headaches of that magnitude.<br/>The universe is so ordered and rational it is haunting.  The order is everywhere<br/>and especially in music.  People would hate this idea because order implies<br/>creation and creation implies a creator and a creator implies morality and<br/>morality is a bright light thrown back upon the self and that would suck because<br/>many people are imperfect and imperfection is not good to dwell on because that<br/>is the very definition of insanity.  Its not a disease that visits you, its the<br/>awareness of intrinsic imperfection that causes insanity.  Insanity is a<br/>self-revelation.  Like the cartoon character that doesn&apos;t start falling until he<br/>has looked down to realize that the ground ended many steps ago.  That is very<br/>uncomfortable for many people to know that they are born fallen and that they<br/>must fall at some point in time.  Some cartoons would just like to never look<br/>down and just walk to ground on the other side.  But then that stupid bird<br/>always flies by and then the cartoon is suddenly aware that the ground ended.<br/>And everyone knows that birds play microtonal music the best.  I wish there were<br/>conductor birds.</p><p>&gt;     It also a problem of secrecy for misinformation to persist without<br/>&gt; correction.

But<br/>I never thought much about the Platonic solids - I just used<br/>a formula that worked for my purposes.</p><p>As it turns out, &apos;the guy&apos; whose work you&apos;re discussing (Erv Wilson)<br/>has drawn hundreds (thousands?) of diagrams representing musical pitch<br/>relationships, and many of them display connections which outline<br/>various polyhedra.  Browse around some more at <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a>,<br/>and try a search for &apos;hedron&apos; on the Tuning List archives.</p><p>&gt; The universe is so ordered and rational it is haunting.

IOW, there&apos;s a lot of stuff<br/>happening that&apos;s *not* rational and we just can&apos;t figure out what<br/>it is, or we can&apos;t even see it.</p><p>Secondly, modern studies of chaos show that it is inherent in<br/>the natural universe (at least the one we can experience).<br/>Einstein made a famous statement about &apos;refusing to believe<br/>that God plays dice&apos;, but apparently, he was wrong and that<br/>*is* what&apos;s going on.</p><p>What&apos;s really so haunting is that, despite the universe being<br/>peppered with chaotic events everywhere you turn, some of which<br/>have an enormous impact (literally, the case of meteors!) on<br/>evolutionary processes that are already under way, yet the<br/>rational laws keep operating and eventually accomodate the<br/>changes perpetrated by the random events; in some cases, the<br/>random event proves to be powerful enough to alter the trajectory<br/>of the evolutionary path, but still the evolutionary process<br/>continues...</p><p>Many researchers are coming around to the idea that science<br/>can never really describe objects, but only processes.  In a sense,<br/>on the cosmological or atomic timescales, the objects never &apos;really&apos;<br/>exist, only the laws that describe their movements.  A lot of<br/>the reason why this is so hard to grasp is because we have such an<br/>elusive and muddy idea of what time, the fourth dimension,<br/>really is.</p><p>And, of course, it&apos;s for this reason, based on the important<br/>role that time plays in music, that music-theory can be so<br/>alluring; in the same sense, music doesn&apos;t really &apos;exist&apos;,<br/>it just &apos;happens&apos; - that is, it can be perceived thru the<br/>usual 3 spatial dimensions only in an abstract way, thru<br/>analysis, whereas its &apos;normal&apos; perception as directly audible<br/>sound can only happen with temporal-based performance.</p><p>Going back to the stuff about Bode&apos;s Law:  there are indeed<br/>some interesting ratios embedded in the motions of the planets,<br/>but they have to do not with distance but with orbital period.<br/>There are intriguing synchronicities (meaning: ratios that are<br/>very close to small-integer proportions) between adjacent planets:</p><p>Mercury:Venus  =  9:23  (pretty close to 2:5)<br/>Venus:Earth    =  8:13  (nearly exact, close to 3:5 and 5:8)<br/>Earth:Mars     = 17:32  (close to 8:15)<br/>Mars:Jupiter   = 10:63  (pretty close to 3:19, 2:13, and 5:32)<br/>Jupiter:Saturn =  2:5<br/>Saturn:Uranus  =  7:20  (close to 6:17 and 1:3)<br/>Uranus:Neptune = 26:51  (pretty close to 1:2!)<br/>Neptune:Pluto  =  2:3</p><p>Perhaps there is some significance to be found in the primes<br/>that turn up in this table - of course, they are a result of<br/>various rounding procedures; one could find higher primes by<br/>using more accurate ratios.</p><p>But I find it interesting that even with the rounding I&apos;ve<br/>done, the table includes 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, and possibly<br/>19, but not 11; except for the omission of 11, all primes<br/>within the 23-limit are represented.  I&apos;ve stated before that<br/>I find 23 to be a kind of limit to harmonic perception in music;<br/>is there a connection?... and why is 11 conspicuously missing?</p><p>There&apos;s also an interesting progressing in the successively-<br/>more-accurate ratios which describe the Venus:Earth relationship:<br/>3:5, 5:8, 8:13.  The higher term in the less accurate ratio<br/>becomes the lower term in the next more accurate one.</p><p>Pluto&apos;s orbit is highly eccentric, and many astronomers believe<br/>that it was once an object orbiting in the Kuiper Belt, and that<br/>it was influenced by Neptune into its current orbit; they cite<br/>that strong 2:3 orbital-period synchronicity as evidence to<br/>support their argument.</p><p>And the strong gravitational pull of Jupiter is obvious in<br/>that its relationship to Saturn&apos;s period (~0.40258) is so<br/>close to such a low-integer ratio (2:5).</p><p>Hmmm... where Bode&apos;s Law was an attempt to portray the &apos;grand<br/>design&apos; of the whole solar-system, this comparision of orbital<br/>periods *only of adjacent planets* is similar to Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>comparison of *dyadic* harmonic entropy among members of a larger<br/>set (such as a chord or scale).</p><p>I sent a private message to Paul suggesting we collaborate on<br/>creating a piece which is an audible mapping of these planetary<br/>relationships, to which he never responded (Paul?).
