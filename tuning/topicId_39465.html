This would mean that if using a scale that has 19 tones to an octave, you would need to have two pianos (of course, only 10 keys on one, and 9 on the other would be used), or for a 31 tone scale, you will need 3 pianos.</p><p>The next question is &quot;has anyone done this sort of thing with MIDI-controlled Acoustic Pianos&quot; with a Generalized controller feeding the MIDI data to the instruments? It sounds like this could be set up with the &quot;Uath-108&quot;, as it says that each key can have its own programmed MIDI message. I am assuming that means it can be programed to send a group of MIDI commands (ie pitch bend, channel, pitch) as a single set of commands.</p><p>If this is true, then each piano could be set up to respond on their own channels, and then you will need to &quot;tune&quot; the pianos to their own sub-sets of pitches. I&apos;m sure you get the point.</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=39484 href="#39484">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/11/2002 2:13:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi again Michael,</p><p>&gt;Has anyone used more than one piano (ala Charles Ives Quarter Tone<br/>&gt;pieces...) for doing extended octave divisions?</p><p>Yes, this is the most common way.
