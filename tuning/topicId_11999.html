I&apos;ve been working on some ideas, but have<br/>&gt; &gt; nothing concrete to offer as yet.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Robin,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You describe where I&apos;m at. I&apos;m still in the process of committing<br/>&gt; myself to buying a 31tet guitar (I&apos;m a guitarist, if interested see<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.microtones.com">www.microtones.com</a>. We used to have their neck-builder on this list and he&apos;ll<br/>&gt; do other custom work if you wanted a guitar but didn&apos;t want a G&amp;L).</p><p>I don&apos;t think he works on guitars anymore. Apparently<br/>he gave it up for the big bucks of web page design.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
