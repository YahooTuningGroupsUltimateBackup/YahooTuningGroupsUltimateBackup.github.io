Planets travel in elliptical orbits perturbed by each other<br/>gravitationally. So no nice circles with nice &apos;harmonic&apos; relationships.</p><p>Actually, &apos;harmonic&apos; ratios of orbital periods are I think unstable as they<br/>are &apos;resonant&apos;. So planets in this configuration probably won&apos;t remain that<br/>way for the long term.</p><p>2. Most planets are oblate spheriods</p><p>3. No solar system is stable, it is &apos;metastable&apos;.</p><p>So any &apos;music of the spheres&apos; would be a temporal sounding of planetary<br/>motions over aeons of time.</p><p>So perhaps we should be talking about the &apos;quasi metastable orbital<br/>proportions of oblate spheriods&apos; - which probably isn&apos;t music.</p><p>Mark G</p></div>
