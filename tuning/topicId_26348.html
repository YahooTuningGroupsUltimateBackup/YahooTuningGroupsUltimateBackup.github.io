If it<br/>&gt; will be of any use to you, I volunteer to record a few raga-s for<br/>&gt; your jamming sessions and practice, in the key of your choice. They<br/>&gt; will be in slow alap-s, staying long on legitimate notes. I will<br/>&gt; select those raga-s which are amenable to accompaniement of soft<br/>&gt; chords.  I can record in MIDI format, to make tanpura track and<br/>&gt; chords track mutable.  I have Cubase VST.  Or, anyway you like and I<br/>&gt; can do.  I can record the main track in piano, or any instrument you<br/>&gt; choose and I may have (on the synthesizer).  I would prefer to use an<br/>&gt; instrument naturally capable of glissando [or, is it a mere matter of<br/>&gt; using pitch bend?]. I have to use 12-teT.  Can you tell me how to use<br/>&gt; MIDI and yet get JI? Or, will 12-teT do for now?</p><p>Thanks, that&apos;s great!</p><p>I think j.i. will be pretty important for me as I think it may be<br/>the j.i. that helps make it easy to play with.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got windows 95/98 you can relay through my Fractal Tune<br/>Smithy program to get j.i. MIDI. I can give more details.</p><p>You can also record in 12-tet and say which j.i. pitches correspond<br/>to which notes, and I can play the midi file through FTS to those<br/>pitches, or use Scala to retune the midi file in place.</p><p>Would be nice to have it in Indian instruments as there are a few<br/>in midi, if there are ones suitable.</p><p>The sitar voice on my soundcard is very nice. Soundcard<br/>has the General Midi list of voices - Sitar = 104.</p><p>I&apos;ll be able to change the selection of voice for the midi channels<br/>anyway (and in FTS can also play any of them with a combination of<br/>two or more voices in unison too).</p><p>Hard to find a nice pitched percussion to match the tabla if you have<br/>that. Maybe I&apos;ll try something like kalimba in unison with melodic tom,<br/>or synth drum (maybe a shade of agogo) or something or other.</p><p>Kalimba + melodic tom doesn&apos;t sound much like a tabla but is rather a<br/>nice timbre, dep. how it goes with the rest.</p><p>You can do glissandi with pitch bends in midi by recording while moving<br/>the pitch bend wheel but limited to glissandi up or down two midi notes.<br/>i.e. if note is close to say A, then you can do glissando up to B<br/>and down to G in that way.</p><p>If for ex. the j.i. note was 9/5, 17.6 cents above a midi note,<br/>then you have a range of -200 cents to + 182.4 cents for the<br/>original glissando after retuning.</p><p>If your pitch bend wheel has range of +- 1 semitone then that will<br/>always be okay after retuning, no matter what the retuned<br/>j.i. pitch.</p><p>So for ex. if you had midi clip in 12-tet with glissandi, then<br/>on retuning by playing through FTS, they&apos;d be in the j.i. scale<br/>with glissandi by the same amounts in terms of distance from<br/>the target pitch.</p><p>(at least it should work like this. Checking this in FTS has<br/>just turned up a bug in the retuning of a glissando when midi<br/>relaying from midi in which I&apos;ll fix).</p><p>Pitch bend glissandi work on midi voices even if not naturally capable<br/>of glissandi, even keyboard instruments like piano, at least<br/>on my soundcard.</p><p>As for which scales are best, it is a bit hard to say, as<br/>one can play any pitch on the recorder with appropriate<br/>fingerings and finger shading, and what lies &quot;well under<br/>the hands&quot; is a bit hard to characterise.</p><p>The C on the base recorder in F is a good strong note and may<br/>be a reasonable choice for the tonic, if there are no other<br/>considerations to place it somewhere else.</p><p>Could be nice to include whatever scale the one was that<br/>I was jamming with.</p><p>&gt; Please delete it tomorrow (07/20 evening).</p><p>Okay will do, this evening.</p><p>Much appreciated, :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
