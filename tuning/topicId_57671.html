Harrison&apos;s fifth is, precisely, 600+300/pi<br/>cents. A fifth 3/10 comma flat is 0.0104813... cents sharper than<br/>this, and an 88-et meantone fifth (as opposed to the one it shares<br/>with 22) is 0.0384204... cents flatter. Hence both are accurate, but<br/>not exact. If you want to go totally overboard, 2^(823/1420) is<br/>8.108658 x 10^(-4) cents flatter.</p></div>
