If not, it would be terribly boring. I would hesitate to<br/>call such construction a &quot;music&quot;.  No melody, no rhythm, no dynamics,<br/>no expression, no change of timbre, only all-intervallic 12tone<br/>series... BUT - what about all those poor microtones in between? They<br/>must be included... So maybe some linear glissando from 20 to 20<br/>would make it.</p><p>So, it looks now like the only polyphonic music which keeps all three<br/>rules is white noise :-)</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 14 Aug 2009, at 5:08 PM, Mark wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve often thought that the revolutionary cry of the Republic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute; sounds like the rallying cry for<br/>&gt; twelve-tone music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Liberty to play any notes at any time you want<br/>&gt; The equality of all tones<br/>&gt; Fraternity of all tones - no combination is held more important<br/>&gt; than any other - the emancipation of dissonance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark<br/>&gt;</p></div>
