If you decide to include like calculations for other<br/>&gt;&gt;12-note fixed tunings, would you please consider Werckmeister III?<br/>(John deLaubenfels:)&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll add it to my list of things to do :-)  Right now, I generate the<br/>&gt; fixed tunings I use from either COFT or n-tET, but I could add others<br/>&gt; or even allow them to be read in from external files.  Lessee: going<br/>&gt; back to a post by Wim Hoogewerf from May 4, Werckmeister III apparently<br/>&gt; has the following deviation from 12-tET, in cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C    0<br/>&gt; C# -10<br/>&gt; D   -8<br/>&gt; D#  -6<br/>&gt; E  -10<br/>&gt; F   -2<br/>&gt; F# -12<br/>&gt; G   -4<br/>&gt; G#  -8<br/>&gt; A  -12<br/>&gt; Bb  -4<br/>&gt; B   -8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is wrong, would somebody please correct me?  Boy, that seems<br/>&gt; like a STRANGE set of numbers!  I&apos;m now curious to see how much &quot;pain&quot;<br/>&gt; it causes...  Any recommendations for particular pieces to throw at it?</p><p>John, it&apos;s not so strange if you know how the Werckmeister III is<br/>constructed. It&apos;s the result of an circular chain of 8 perfect fithts and 4<br/>fifths which are each tempered by a quarter of a Pythagorean comma. The<br/>tempered  fifths are C-G, G-D, D-A and B-F#.</p><p>The deviations in cents may perhaps be calculated in a more precise way.<br/>Right now the pure fifth is considered to be 702 cents and the Puthagorean<br/>comma 24 cents.</p><p>Werckmeister III is not an attempt to obtain the ideal tuning for a singular<br/>piece, as you did marvellously well with Mozart&apos;s KV 606. (I listened to it<br/>many times!) As all Well-temperaments, Werckmeister III offers a solution to<br/>play reasonably in tune in all of the twelve keys, both minor and major. It<br/>becomes specially interesting when you listen to a set of pieces in many<br/>different keys, like Bach&apos;s two-part Inventions, the three-part Sinfonias or<br/>the Well-tempered clavier. Each key has it&apos;s own tuning characteristics. You<br/>can hear for example, without being absolute, if a piece is in D major or in<br/>Eb major.</p><p>Intuitively I think you will find about as much &apos;pain&apos; as in<br/>meantone-tuning.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
