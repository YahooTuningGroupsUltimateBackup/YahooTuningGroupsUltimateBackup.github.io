Note that my tuning mentioned above, Bamm24b,<br/>does not have any just 5-limit ratios or Syntonon Diatonon tetrachords<br/>or modes.</p><p>&gt;  It provides two sizes of each of the neutral intervals : seconds,<br/>&gt;  thirds, etc., except that within this limited number of notes<br/>&gt;  selected from the complete set of 77 notes, they can&apos;t be<br/>&gt;  experienced with the same tonic.</p><p>This raises an important point you discussed in your earlier long post<br/>on Maqam tunings. The vital thing is to have at least two sizes of<br/>neutral intervals, even if only one is available from a given step.</p><p>Even in O3, a 24-note system which does have some steps with two sizes<br/>of neutral intervals available at a comma apart, we can&apos;t get, for<br/>example, a moderate Rast (357.4 or 358.6 cents) and a moderate<br/>Mustaqim (345.7 or 346.9 cents) above the same note. That would<br/>require a lower and higher segah only 12 cents or so apart. What we<br/>can sometimes get, for example, is a high segah (369.1 cents) for a<br/>Turkish Rast or moderately low segah (345.7 cents) for a typical Arab<br/>Bayyati, a difference of a comma at 23.4 cents.</p><p>However, of course, a complete Tsaharuk does provide choices like a<br/>virtually just 72/59 or 59/48 above the same note, which I found in a<br/>94-note version with five generators equal to a pure 3/2.</p><p>&gt; The neutral intervals of Rast will be the tonic of Bayyati or<br/>&gt; Mustaqim, and reversely.</p><p>This is also a pattern we see in Mohajira or Wilson&apos;s Rast-Bayyati<br/>matrix, with a Rast heptatone appearing in a version extended to 10 or<br/>more notes. And likewise an Arab Makam Sikah has the smaller neutral<br/>intervals in contrast to Rast; while Persian Dastgah-e Segah has the<br/>larger neutral intervals, in contrast to Mustaqim (or a modern gushe<br/>such as Shekaste like the old Mustaqim).</p><p>&gt; This has been concocted simply with a sequence of 11 schismatic<br/>&gt; fifths, transposed by 28/27.</p><p>Curiously, Bamm24b results from extending a variation on a 17-note<br/>tuning for the &grave;oud explained by Cris Forster in his book _Musical<br/>Mathematics_, but may be concocted as two chains of 11 pure fifths at<br/>a 531/512 apart (63.1 cents), or 14337:14336 more than 28/27!</p><p>Thus the only primes are 2, 3, and 59 -- while your Tsaharuk also has<br/>5 and 7! The biggest difference may be that Tsaharuk 24 has pure<br/>5-limit thirds, in line with Julien&apos;s standard, while in Bamm24b all<br/>usual fifths are pure.</p><p>&gt;  So 28/27 appears 12 times as the larger step, alternatively with<br/>&gt;  five 36/35 and seven septimal commas 64/63, all evenly<br/>&gt;  distributed. Their relative size in 171-edo is 9, 7, and 4 steps.</p><p>In Bamm24b we have 12 larger steps at 531/512 (63.1 cents), five at<br/>243/236 (50.6 cents), and seven at 131072/129033, smaller than 64/63<br/>by 14337:14336.</p><p>&gt; Nine quasi-pure 7/4 appear between the two fifth sequences, which<br/>&gt; can be surprising for a Maqam tuning.</p><p>On this point Tsaharuk-24 and Bamm24b are similar, and I agree that a<br/>lot of modern Maqam theory doesn&apos;t emphasize septimal intervals. However, it said that in Maqam Ushshaq Masri (a variation on Nahawand<br/>associated with Egypt, somewhat like Persian Nava, with an upper<br/>Bayyati, e.g. re mi fa sol la si-d ut re, with &quot;si-d&quot; a half-flat, it<br/>is sad that the third is a comma lower than usual, which could mean<br/>around 7/6, with the seventh step maybe near 7/4. For a low Nahawand<br/>or Ushshaq Masri, Tsaharuk-24 might be very useful!</p><p>Also, I&apos;ve heard that Maqam Buselik in Turkey may favor a low third<br/>around 7/6, and the 5-limit intervals of Tsaharuk-24 should fit a<br/>Turkish style also.</p><p>&gt; But as I said in my first post, an optimal generator would arrive at<br/>&gt; 7:1 in 24 reiterations, while it gives also almost pure fifths,<br/>&gt; which is the first criteria Julien Jalaleddine Weiss and other<br/>&gt; musicians want for Maqam tunings.</p><p>Indeed it will give a pure 7/4 and an almost pure 3/2 (very slightly<br/>narrow) and 5/4 (likewise, with -40 generators at 385.290 cents).</p><p>&gt;  In fact, a pure 7:1 attained in 24 generators creates a slightly<br/>&gt;  schismatic tuning of the fifths, that produces also quasi-pure 5/4<br/>&gt;  thirds, and this is the idea of this tuning, in this central zone<br/>&gt;  near 171-edo.</p><p>For this generator, Scala shows 140.368 cents, yielding a fifth around<br/>701.839 cents. What I note is that 24 generators give a pure 7/4 and<br/>-40 a near-pure 5/4. With a fifth generator around 3/2, getting 7/4<br/>pure (-14 fifths) would require slightly extending the fifth, which<br/>would make 5/4 (-8 fifths) less pure.</p><p>&gt; The average Tsaharuk generator in the tuning below, five of them<br/>&gt; giving a fifth, is 1.08444952 ~20/171 of octave, itself very close<br/>&gt; to the meta-temperament version of Tsaharuk, 1.084451679092 ; it<br/>&gt; often appears as 64/59 in this rational version of the temperament.</p><p>An interesting point is that Bamm24b takes a pure 64/59 and 59/54 as<br/>one of its starting points (using generators of 3/2 and 531/512), but<br/>your Tsaharuk has generators of varying sizes around 3/2^1/5: for<br/>example 64/59 and 243/224, differing by 14337:14336, as well as two<br/>others a bit smaller helping to produce the pure 5-limit thirds.</p><p>&gt; You will notice there are neither 11 nor 13 primes in this tuning,<br/>&gt; but only 2, 3, 5 , 7 and 59.</p><p>It&apos;s curious that in Bamm24b, we have only 2, 3, and 59 -- but with<br/>the same types of approximations you mention next.</p><p>&gt; One of the reasons is that Tsaharuk tempers 352/351, and 59 finds<br/>&gt; its place precisely in between (59/48 for example is in the middle<br/>&gt; of 27/22 and 16/13).</p><p>Yes, 59 is very close to exactly between 11 and 13. A 59/48, for<br/>example, is larger than 27/22 by 649:648, and smaller than 16/13 by<br/>768:767, respectively 2.670 and 2.256 cents. Early this year I did a<br/>lattice for Bamm24b showing some of these near-equivalences:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/hexapentadic17.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/hexapentadic17.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I am only giving a rational version here, the more useful for<br/>&gt; fretting applications ; but it expresses a temperament.</p><p>The pure thirds, fitting Julien&apos;s criteria, do make the tempering<br/>clear.</p><p>With Bamm24b, we have basically two chains of 11 pure fifths at a<br/>531/512 apart, almost identical to a 28/27, which could be tuned by<br/>ear, so the only &quot;tempering&quot; is the 14337:14336 difference (0.121<br/>cents). In 1024-ED2, the generators are 599 steps (703.953 cents) and<br/>54 steps (63.281 cents) -- a virtually pure 3/2 I suspect Julien would<br/>accept, and an approximation of 531/512 about 0.200 cents wide.</p><p>However, while we have lots of 72/59 and 59/54 thirds for rast-segah<br/>in Bayyati or Mustaqim and Rast (but, as with Tsaharuk-24, not both positions above a single step), and nine virtually pure 7/4&apos;s, Julien<br/>would notice that there are no pure ratios of 5. They are not a part<br/>of the design, although some schismatic thirds will occur -- in<br/>contrast to the pure 5/4 and 6/5 thirds of tsaharuk-24, or near-pure<br/>thirds with complete Tsaharuk tunings using 7^1/24, for example.</p><p>I also notice that a Tsaharuk-94 with the 7^1/24 generator has some<br/>other near-just intervals like 13/11 and 17/14 -- and lots of places<br/>supporting both Rast with segah near 59/54 and Mustaqim or Bayyati<br/>with segah near 72/59!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2011 4:18:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Tuning List Colleagues,</p><p>Please let me express my sense of intellectual delight and artistic<br/>camaraderie in sharing with Jacques Dudon in our independent<br/>discoveries of 24-note JI tunings involving the small schisma of<br/>14337:14336 which defines the difference, for example, between the<br/>septimal ratio of 28/27 (the beloved thirdtone step of Archytas) and<br/>the ratio of 531/512 based on prime 59.</p><p>His most intricate and subtle Tsaharuk 24 tuning, and my earlier<br/>Bamm24b published on a smaller tuning group which Jacques had not<br/>seen, are a wonderful illustration of how certain ideas at certain<br/>times seem almost to be &quot;floating in the air,&quot; where different people<br/>in different parts of the world can independently recognize and<br/>embrace them. That is exactly what has happened here.</p><p>Following his creative path as a lover of Maqam and other musical<br/>traditions, and artfully uniting a musical sensitivity to these<br/>traditions with a fine aural and mathematical craft in designing<br/>differentially coherent (-c) JI tunings as well as most subtle<br/>temperaments, Jacques and such colleagues as Julien Jalaleddine Weiss<br/>along with some of the most renowned practitioners of this tradition,<br/>are setting a new state of the art.</p><p>While Jacques developed his Tsaharuk 24 quite unaware of my Bamm24b, I<br/>must add that my Bamm24b evolved in good part out of the discussions<br/>that Jacques and I had had last year in connection with the<br/>magnificent Ethno2 collection and the related topic of his -c series<br/>for Maqam and Persian Dastgah music involving ratios of 59.</p><p>Last December, when Cris Forster&apos;s book _Musical Mathematics_ gave me<br/>the idea of designing a 24-note JI tuning for the &grave;oud (or keyboard)<br/>expanding on classic &grave;oud tunings of the Islamic or Arabistic<br/>Renaissance of the 8th-15th centuries as measured by the European<br/>calendar, my earlier dialogues with Jacques helped to focus my mind on<br/>ratios such as 72/59 and 59/48 for neutral thirds, leading me to<br/>design a system with two chains of 11 pure fifths at 531/513 (around<br/>63.1 cents) apart. Immediately I recognized that this was extremely<br/>close to the very familiar ratio of 28/27, and quickly used Manuel Op<br/>de Coul&apos;s Scala to find that ratio for this small schisma was<br/>14337:14336 (about 0.121 cents).</p><p>In contrast to my quest for a 24-note JI superset of a classic &grave;oud<br/>tuning, Jacques has independently designed his Tsaharuk 24 as a<br/>subset, very useful in itself, of a fuller Tsaharuk system, an<br/>amazingly comprehensive tuning or gamut for the qanun which may<br/>advance the state of an art already flourishing with incredible<br/>subtlety when Ibn Sina described some of its tunings and modes about a<br/>millennium ago: the consummate art of Maqam, of which the Dastgah<br/>system of Persian music is also a most fruitful branch.</p><p>The independent nature of his conception is shown by the fine<br/>schismatic nuances which Jacques has introduced into Tsaharuk 24,<br/>something quite outside the conception or implementation of the<br/>simpler Bamm24b. Thus, through his deftly chosen subset, one may<br/>sample some of the refinements of a complete Tsaharuk system.</p><p>As George Secor has well said, &quot;cross-pollination&quot; is one of the basic<br/>creative processes in music and its intonation, and it is a great<br/>honor to share in the demonstration of this truth with such a<br/>distinguished colleague as Jacques Dudon.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
