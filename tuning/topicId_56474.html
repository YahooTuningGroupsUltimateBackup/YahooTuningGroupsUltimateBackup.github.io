notation.</p><p>my enthusiasm for this notation is only partly<br/>due to its excellence in notating 24-edo music<br/>(as can be seen in the short example of the Haba quartet<br/>on my webpage quoted at the bottom of this message).</p><p>more and more, i am embraciing 72-edo as<br/>a compact means of approximating 11-limit JI.</p><p>72-edo may be notated very neatly on my<br/>quarter-tone-staff with the use of only two<br/>accidentals -- i like to use up and down arrow-heads,<br/>which in this notational scheme are somewhat analagous<br/>to the way sharps and flats work in regular notation.</p><p>there&apos;s a graphic illustration here:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?72edo.htm&qtstaff">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?72edo.htm&qtstaff</a></p><p>i find this quarter-tone-staff presentation of 72-edo to<br/>be far superior to any other that has been devised<br/>(even despite my enthusiasm for Sagittal notation).</p><p>the 5-line staff was developed for diatonic music<br/>using a 7-tone scale which has two different step-sizes,<br/>and it has continued to work well for this type of music<br/>for 1000 years.  certainly, it has two prominent<br/>shortcomings, even for this type of music:</p><p>1)<br/>there is no visual indication of the difference<br/>between diatonic whole-steps and half-steps<br/>(which must instead be learned by rote); and</p><p>2)<br/>there is no visual representation of the<br/>&quot;octave&quot;-equivalence which is a feature of<br/>diatonic music.</p><p>upon moving beyond 7-tone diatonic music, even to<br/>something as simple as 12-edo, the 5-line staff&apos;s<br/>shortcomings quickly become a ponderous hindrance.<br/>(my personal feeling is that the 12edo-staff notation<br/>i devised works far better for this tuning.)</p><p>move further, into microtonal tunings which are not<br/>representative of traditional musical usage like<br/>meantone, etc., and to me it makes very little sense<br/>to force those types of tunings to be shoe-horned<br/>onto the 5-line staff.</p><p>there will be vehement arguments about how performing<br/>musicians need the continuance of the 5-line staff, but<br/>i say that&apos;s nonsense.  if a good musician can learn<br/>to read music which uses 2 different clefs (as any<br/>pianist, bassoonist, trombonist, or cellist must do<br/>... to say nothing of all the different clefs which<br/>must be mastered by composers and conductors), then<br/>there should be no problem acclimating to an entirely<br/>new staff system -- particulary if that staff was<br/>*designed* with the particular microtonal tuning<br/>in mind, and gives a good visual representation of<br/>the pitch-height and equivalence structure of that tuning.</p><p>i am indeed hoping that we (at Tonalsoft) will be able<br/>to get these two types of notation (12edo-staff and<br/>quarter-tone-staff) into the initial release of Musica.<br/>having a powerful compositional tool which makes use<br/>of these notations should render them much more<br/>quickly accpetable ... at least, that is my hope.</p><p>cordially,</p><p>monz</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: monz<br/>To: Ozan Yarman<br/>Sent: 18 Aral&Auml;&pm;k 2004 Cumartesi 1:38<br/>Subject: Re: OFFLIST - re: Tonalsoft Musica</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>in addition to the pitch-height graph notation and regular<br/>5-line staff notation, early versions of Musica (but probably<br/>after 1.0) will also incorporate my 12-edo-staff notation and<br/>my quarter-tone-staff notation.</p><p>you can look these up in the Encyclopaedia:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?12edo-staff.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?12edo-staff.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?qt-staff.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?qt-staff.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=56480 href="#56480">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2004 5:13:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

The visual indication for the half-tones E-F and B-C are<br/>&gt; the notes themselves. Paul has explained to me in our private<br/>&gt; conversation that the logic behind this discrepancy arises from<br/>&gt; the fact that the fifth must be five lines+spaces away from a<br/>&gt; notehead (including the notehead) in accordance with the<br/>&gt; diatonical nomenclature. What better reference for comprehending<br/>&gt; intonation if not as simple a scale as C Major expressed by<br/>&gt; consequent natural (unaccented) tones on the staff?</p><p>i agree that this system worked fine when Guido d&apos;Arezzo<br/>invented it 1000 years ago.  but with the advent of tonality<br/>in Western music (c.1500 or so) it should have been scrapped<br/>and a whole new system put in its place.  that didn&apos;t<br/>happen, and music has continued to develop at a dizzying<br/>pace with which the notation just couldn&apos;t keep up ... and<br/>having to ensure that the old diatonic staff would always<br/>be backwards-compatible only made the matter worse.</p><p>&gt; 3. You know that octave equivalance is not a big deal when<br/>&gt; reading regular staff notation. A learned musician knows that<br/>&gt; the octave is 7 steps away from the tone of reference.</p><p>it&apos;s not a big deal to me, only because i&apos;ve been reading it<br/>for so long that i&apos;m used to it.  that does not alter the fact<br/>that it is far more logical to use a staff notation which<br/>visually displays the periodicity of frequency which results<br/>from the acceptance of an interval-of-equivalence.  if both<br/>our hearing and our compositional practice say that it&apos;s<br/>there, then why use a notation which disguises the fact?</p><p>&gt; 4. Whether we like it or not, the 5-line staff notation<br/>&gt; is practiced everywhere by tens of thousands of music-makers.<br/>&gt; Are we supposed to start teaching them music all over again?<br/>&gt; I do not think they will accept that, and neither would I.<br/>&gt; Insisting on two or more seperate staff systems to notate<br/>&gt; pitches does not sound like a good idea either. Maybe I&apos;m<br/>&gt; more conservative than I wish to be in this case, but that&apos;s<br/>&gt; how it is.</p><p>yes, well, i&apos;ve already presented my argument for this<br/>under #1 above.  and yes, you *are* much more conservative<br/>than i about this matter.</p><p>the way i see it, using several different notations simultaneously<br/>can never be a bad thing.  it&apos;s like having a piece of writing<br/>translated into several different languages -- if you understand<br/>more than one of those languages, then comparing them will<br/>more than likely give you an insight that you would never<br/>get by reading it in just one language.</p><p>even if we (Tonalsoft) do not get my alternative new-staff<br/>notations into v1.0 of Musica, there will still already be<br/>at least two different graphical notations -- the 5-line<br/>diatonic-staff notation (whether using regular pythagorean/meantone<br/>or HEWM accidentals), and the pitch-height notation.</p><p>the pitch-height notation is a plain time-vs.-pitch graph,<br/>similar to the familiar &quot;piano-roll&quot; notation used in most<br/>other sequencer programs -- but the big difference of course<br/>is that it&apos;s not necessarily quantized to 12-edo.  (it certainly<br/>*can* be quantized to 12-edo, but only if that&apos;s the tuning<br/>being used by the user for that piece.)  instead, the vertical<br/>size of the spaces depends on the particular tuning chosen,<br/>and on the equivalence-interval being used (it does not have<br/>to be the 2:1 &quot;octave&quot;, but rather, can be any interval desired).<br/>for rational tunings, the spaces are unequally-sized.</p><p>so even in the very first release of Musica, the user will<br/>be able to see the piece in both the pitch-height notation<br/>and the diatonic-staff notation, and possibly also in my<br/>new-staff notations if we get them into that release.</p><p>and of course, the user will also have windows open which<br/>display various lattice-diagrams, whose lattice-points<br/>highlight in real-time as the music plays, displaying on<br/>the lattice the notes which are sounding.</p><p>i have always been a very big believer in redundant coding,<br/>and my software is going to make abundant use of it!</p><p>(hmm ... &quot;abundant redundance&quot; ... has a nice ring to it ...)</p><p>&gt; 5.

Gott&apos;s method hinges on the &quot;Copernican assumption&quot; that<br/>there is nothing special about the particular time of your observation, so<br/>with 95% confidence it occurs in the middle 95% of the lifetime. If the<br/>phenomenon is observed to have started A years ago, Gott infers that A<br/>represents between 1/40 (2.5%) and 39/40 (97.5%) of the total life. He<br/>therefore predicts that the remaining life will extend between A/39 and 39A<br/>years into the future. (Given Gott&apos;s assumptions, this is simple algebra: if<br/>A = (1/40)L where L is the total life, then the future life is L - A = 39A.)<br/>Gott has used the method to predict everything from the run of Broadway plays<br/>to the survival of the human species!</p><p>But can such broad applicability really be justified? Not according to Dr.<br/>Carlton Caves, a physicist at the University of New Mexico (and a New Yorker<br/>reader!) who has put together a systematic critique of Gott&apos;s work. His<br/>article, &quot;Predicting Future Duration from Present Age: A Critical<br/>Assessment,&quot; will be published in Contemporary Physics.</p><p>Caves&apos; ideas are based on Bayesian analysis. He says that Gott errs by<br/>ignoring prior information about the lifetimes of the phenomena in question.<br/>For example, Gott claims to have invented his method while standing at the<br/>Berlin Wall in 1969, eight years after it was erected. With 50% confidence he<br/>inferred that those eight years represented between 1/4 and 3/4 of its total<br/>life, so he predicted that the Wall would last between 2 2/3 years and 24<br/>years into the future. (For the record, twenty years later, the Wall did come<br/>down.) But what sense does it make, asks Caves, to ignore historical and<br/>political conditions when making such a prediction? Surely, such prior<br/>knowledge is relevant, and Bayesian ideas provide a framework for<br/>incorporating it. In Caves&apos; view, failing to do so in favor of some<br/>&quot;universal rule&quot; is unscientific.</p><p>To illustrate the matter more simply, Caves imagines discovering a party in<br/>progress, where we learn that the guest of honor is celebrating her 50th<br/>birthday. Gott&apos;s theory predicts that, with 95% certainty, she will live<br/>between 1.28 and 1950 additional years, a range which Caves dismisses as too<br/>wide to be useful. Even worse, he points out, would be to predict that with<br/>33% confidence she is in the first third of her lifetime and thus has a 33%<br/>chance to live past the age of 150! As a challenge to Gott, Caves has<br/>produced a notarized list of 24 dogs owned by people associated with his<br/>department. He identified the half dozen who are older than 10 years -- prior<br/>information that Gott would presumably ignore. Gott&apos;s method would presumably<br/>predict that each had a 50% chance of living to twice its current age. Caves<br/>is willing to bet Gott $1000 on each dog, offering 2-to-1 odds that it won&apos;t<br/>live that long. Caves cites Gott&apos;s refusal to bet as evidence that he doesn&apos;t<br/>believe his own rule.</p><p>For more technical details, you can read Caves&apos; paper online at</p><p> <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0001414">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0001414</a></p><p>and Gott&apos;s rebuttal at</p><p><a href="http://www.physicsweb.org/article/news/4/2/6/1/news-04-02-06a">http://www.physicsweb.org/article/news/4/2/6/1/news-04-02-06a</a></p><p>As for the dogs, Gott thinks his analysis would apply to the whole sample, not<br/>to each dog individually hand-picked by Caves. Trying to sort out all of this<br/>is an interesting discussion exercise involving the notions of sampling,<br/>confidence levels, and prediction.</p><p>################<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=56485 href="#56485">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2004 9:36:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Another argument for 5-line staves hasn&apos;t been touched upon here: it has<br/>&gt;been proven that our reaction time to seeing more than 5 of anything slows<br/>&gt;down, because we have to start counting the objects, and this is true of<br/>&gt;staff lines as it is for anything else.</p><p>These results are for a generalized stimulus, and don&apos;t consider training.<br/>One probably wouldn&apos;t need to count staff lines.
