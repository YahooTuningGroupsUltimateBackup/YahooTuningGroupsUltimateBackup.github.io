Describing the same interval as a<br/>&gt; &quot;bruised&quot; minor third is a rather different viewpoint, one which both<br/>&gt; Paul and I seem both to find curious -- but which could be quite<br/>&gt; descriptive in a musical context where some other size is expected.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry, I introduced the term bruised and meant no slight to any interval<br/>or musical style using such. My comment was in a thread regarding rhythmic<br/>thought and the conjecture I was making was that the way of thinking of<br/>some seven-beat patterns as &quot;two bars of 4/4 with a beat missing&quot; may<br/>have an analog to 7:6 being perceived as a &quot;bruised&quot; (meaning lowered)<br/>minor third. Indeed, the very nomenclature &quot;subminor third&quot; is<br/>making the same reference as &quot;a minor third that something has been<br/>done to&quot; (as major and minor third denote a &quot;third that something has<br/>been done to&quot;).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
