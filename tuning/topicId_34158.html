However, in my experience,<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; tension in the dominant seventh chord is further enhanced when 7-<br/>&gt; limit is<br/>&gt;&gt; employed. Contrary to what my teachers believed, the seventh<br/>&gt; partial is not<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;unusable.&quot; Combine a &quot;high third&quot; with a super-flat seventh over a<br/>&gt; dominant<br/>&gt;&gt; root and you&apos;ve got tension that *cries* for resolution.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The &quot;high third&quot; that &quot;locks&quot; in such a chord, however, seems to me<br/>&gt; *not* to<br/>&gt;&gt; be a Pythagorean third--which to my ear is too high. (Again, not to<br/>&gt; re-open<br/>&gt;&gt; past discussion, but simply to keep it in mind.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Gerald Eskelin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; gerry, isn&apos;t it also true that you, unlike george, feel/felt that<br/>&gt; the &apos;high third&apos; could/would/should be used in the *tonic* chord?</p><p>Yes, Paul. That has been my observation. At a choral convention where group<br/>after group sang for three days, I and a keen-eared buddy took notice of<br/>final-chord tuning. The major thirds were all over the place--mostly some<br/>shade of &quot;high.&quot; Many were right on my sense of high-third &quot;locking.&quot; Some<br/>were uncomfortably higher. And, as one would expect, there were many 12-tET<br/>thirds. But, surprisingly, not many JI thirds on final chords.</p><p>(I didn&apos;t get into tonic tuning in my response to George&apos;s post since my<br/>point was not to exclude 7-limit sevenths.)</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 11:36:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/12/02 10:13 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 3<br/>&gt;  Date: Wed, 13 Feb 2002 00:13:50 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 1890<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Paul and I have been talking about the ear&apos;s limitations regarding<br/>&gt; a few<br/>&gt;&gt; cents of difference.
