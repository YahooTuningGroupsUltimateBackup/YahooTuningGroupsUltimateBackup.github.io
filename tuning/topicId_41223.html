All software (or all software that lasts in the market) goes through changes and upgrades in response to either real or perceived consumer desires. Finale has been bitten pretty well by other notation programs, most notably Sibelius; this is the reason they&apos;ve had so many promotions.</p><p>And having worked with Finale in some of it&apos;s earliest forms, and then more recently (my last work with Finale was about 1.5 years ago), they had made a lot of improvements in useability. I&apos;m not conjecturing that it is as good/easy/transparent an interface as Sibelius, just that it may have come closer.</p><p>Bottom line: if we&apos;re discussing software (especially in comparison) it only serves its purpose if we discuss the most current versions. The features one is missing may very well be there if you are using an old version for your baseline.</p><p>My $.02,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=41234 href="#41234">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2002 8:02:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_41223.html#41232">/tuning/topicId_41223.html#41232</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Sibelius plug-in I&apos;ve been mentioning makes it possible to<br/>assign<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch bends to every pitch class and accidental througout the<br/>entire<br/>&gt; &gt; range, but of course those are also deviations from the basic 12-<br/>&gt; &gt; equal MIDI assignments.
