There<br/>are of course many ways of doing this, but let&apos;s say we choose this<br/>approach: We keep adding more and more pitches, using simple JI intervals,<br/>until we find a pitch very close to one we already have. We have found a<br/>&quot;comma&quot; or &quot;unison vector&quot;. Then we decide that the new pitch is not worth<br/>adding. In the 3-limit case, we are done. Because once we find a unison<br/>vector, any further additions along the chain of fifths will just introduce<br/>that same unison vector between the new notes and notes we already have.<br/>Let&apos;s give some examples:</p><p>Here is a chain of fifths:</p><p>1024/729-256/243-128/81-32/27-16/9-4/3-1/1-3/2-9/8-27/16-81/64-243/128-729/5<br/>12</p><p>Let&apos;s say we start in the middle (1/1) and start adding notes alternately to<br/>the right and left on the chain of fifths (it doesn&apos;t matter; we could go in<br/>just one direction if we wanted to). Soon we have both 9/8 (204.9 cents) and<br/>32/27 (294.1 cents) in our scale, and the interval between them, about 90<br/>cents, is the smallest interval in the scale. Let&apos;s say that we consider<br/>this a &quot;unison vector&quot;, and decide that we only want to keep one of those<br/>pitches, say 9/8, in our scale. So we have a pentatonic (5-note) scale. If<br/>we tried to add a fifth above 9/8, which is 27/16, to the scale, we would<br/>find that that is 90 cents from a pitch we already have, 16/9. This could<br/>have been anticipated by noting the regularity of the chain of fifths: all<br/>fifths are the same size, so all intervals constructed from a given number<br/>of fifths are the same size no matter where they occur in the chain. In this<br/>case, an interval of 90 cents is always produced by a chain of 5 fifths. In<br/>vector notation, we say</p><p>(5) = 90 cents.</p><p>This unison vector defines the pentatonic scale. As we have seen,<br/>considering 90 cents to be a unison vector causes us to stop after we have 5<br/>notes in the chain of fifths. The pentatonic scale is called a &quot;periodicity<br/>block&quot; because the entire, infinite chain of fifths can be divided up into a<br/>string of pentatonic scales, each transposed 90 cents relative to its<br/>neighbor. Every note in the infinite chain can be seen as equivalent to one<br/>and only one of the five pitches in our pentatonic scale, through<br/>transpositions of 90 cents. So considering (5) to be a unison vector in a<br/>sense collapses the infinite resources of Pythagorean tuning into a single<br/>pentatonic scale.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say you consider 90 cents to be a large interval, a distinction<br/>worth making on our instrument (most of us would!). Then you keep expanding<br/>your chain of fifths. When you get all the pitches shown above, you find<br/>that the interval between 1024/729 (588.3 cents) and 729/512 (612.7 cents)<br/>is only about 23 cents. You might decide that this is too small a<br/>distinction to keep on your instrument. So you choose only one of those two<br/>pitches, and you have a 12-tone scale. The unison vector in question is thus</p><p>(12) = 23 cents.</p><p>Again, this unison vector defines a periodicity block of 12 notes: every<br/>note in the infinite chain is equivalent to one and only one note in the<br/>12-tone scale through transpositions of 23 cents.</p><p>Any questions? If not, I will continue with the 2-D (5-limit) case next<br/>time.</p></div>
