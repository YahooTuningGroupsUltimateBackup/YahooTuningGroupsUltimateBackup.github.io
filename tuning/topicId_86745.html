The one I use the most uses 31 pitch classes (i.e. note names with quarter tones included) mapped to 41 degrees in 72 equal temperament, based on Miracle tuning, to approximate 11-limit JI.</p><p>The list below is an example of such a roadmap, using pitches in 53 equal temperament, 34 in all, assigned to 19 pitch classes. The pitches without a note name are alternates of another a 1/53-octave comma away, thus G# is normally 3, but can also be 2, and A is either 8 or 9, 8 by default. This is, of course, Hanson/kleismic tuning. The approximated ratios listed on each line are 5-limit-plus-13 with factors no more than 36.</p><p>(This table should be viewed in a monospaced font.)</p><p>0   G   1/1<br/>2<br/>3   G#  27/26 26/25 25/24<br/>5       16/15<br/>6   Ab  27/25 13/12<br/>8   A   10/9<br/>9       9/8<br/>11  A#  15/13<br/>12<br/>14  Bb  6/5<br/>16      16/13<br/>17  B   5/4<br/>19      32/25<br/>20  Cb  13/10<br/>22  C   4/3<br/>23      27/20<br/>25  C#  18/13 25/18<br/>26<br/>28  Db  36/25 13/9<br/>30<br/>31  D   3/2<br/>33  D#  20/13<br/>34      25/16<br/>36  Eb  8/5<br/>37      13/8<br/>39  E   5/3<br/>41<br/>42  Fb  26/15<br/>44      16/9<br/>45  F   9/5<br/>47  F#  24/13<br/>48      15/8<br/>50  Gb  25/13<br/>51<br/>53  G   2/1</p><p>There are two &quot;orphaned&quot; JI ratios that do map to 53 but not to 34; these are listed below.
