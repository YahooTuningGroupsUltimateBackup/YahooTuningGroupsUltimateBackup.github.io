I read a little ahead on the posts, for once, and I can see<br/>&gt;that I need to learn more about this system.  Could someone PLEASE<br/>&gt;send me some samples of it??  I will pay BIG money.  Even over $30...</p><p>&gt;Also, PLEASE include the &quot;key&quot; to the notation.  If I&apos;m understanding<br/>&gt;this all correctly, the 72-tET system includes 12-tET in it!  And it<br/>&gt;seems that the &quot;alterations&quot; are really quite a bit more managable<br/>&gt;than thinking of 50 cents alterations from a quarter tone.</p><p>Go to <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html</a>. There is also the<br/>Richter-Herf Institute&apos;s notation, which is conceptually the same.</p><p>&gt;Ummm.  The practical logic of this is irrefutable.  But, is Harry<br/>&gt;Partch&apos;s 43 tone system ALSO a subset of 72-tET???</p><p>No, but the 29 diamond intervals (the &quot;11-limit consonances&quot;) are all within<br/>4&cent; of 72-tET. They&apos;re all uniquely, unambigously, and quite accurately<br/>represented.</p><p>&gt;Gee... I guess it WOULD be... since if 72 is accurate to the 11th<br/>&gt;limit... and Partch goes to the 11th limit!!</p><p>72 is pretty accurate for any limit (Ezra Sims goes at least to 37), and<br/>it&apos;s consistent through the 17-limit.</p></div>
