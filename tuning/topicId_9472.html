I used bass fretwire, on my instruement and even though<br/>it is a little tight in the last frets it worked fine. I agree with you that</p><p>standard banjo fretwire doesn&apos;t give as fat a tone. Nor is it as playable,<br/>the other<br/>thing I like about larger fretwire is it is almost like having a scalloped<br/>fingerboard.<br/>(I can milk notes by just varrying the pressure).</p><p>by the way my neck is a Just intonation arraignment for 3 different keys<br/>with a few extra notes strategically placed.<br/>James Mckinney<br/>Banjo Player at Large</p></div>
