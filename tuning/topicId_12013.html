By<br/>&gt;the way, please let me thank you for your germinal articles on regular<br/>&gt;tunings with one or two chains of fifths, vital sources for so much of<br/>&gt;what I&apos;m now about, including some recent articles on neo-Gothic<br/>&gt;hypermeantones.</p><p>Just for the record, it was Keenan Pepper who made the recent post about<br/>&quot;crunchiness&quot;, while Dave Keenan wrote the germinal articles you refer to.</p></div>
