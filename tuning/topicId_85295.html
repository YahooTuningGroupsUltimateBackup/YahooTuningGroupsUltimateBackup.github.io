On the other hand,<br/>&gt;&gt; this one avoids weird comma shifts.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is something that I have found to be the most curious of the JI dilemmas, especially considering it is a simple chord set as well as one natural sounding to the ear.<br/>&gt; &gt; When I try to come up with a solution to this I base it on the idea that I am discovering the real arithmetic behind the ii-V-I that explains its musical quality, i.e. what is the ear hearing about it that has made it stand the test of time?<br/>&gt; &gt; One of my ideas is that the particular minor 7th chord that appears in this progression could actually be tuned differently, as an 11th chord extension of the following dominant. The tuning I have in mind is the sub-minor 7th, or septimal-minor 7th. 12:14:18:21. As such, it really would share a fundamental with the following dominant.
