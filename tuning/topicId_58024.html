Understood! just<br/>as microtonal is different from traditional scales but what does this<br/>have to do with Ragas,etc. I am sure one loves to talk about what one<br/>likes to listen to too or knows alot about. When listening to the music<br/>of DNA, I found it to be much like the other types of music that is<br/>presented here. All I was looking for was a means to be able to<br/>transcribe intervals,(regardless what type of genere) into DNA music,<br/>regardless if was in E.T.frogmented to the ninth power of 12 or<br/>whatever scales that are known. Really, guys or gals if you want to<br/>snub me. Just say, &quot;We don&apos;t care about no stinking music involving the<br/>make up of DNA molescues&quot;. Or just change the post.DNA Music(now<br/>ragas,etc.)and talk about your likes and dislikes off line.When I see a<br/>reply to my post, I am expecting someone to say something inreference<br/>to it.Right? I don&apos;t post often because alot of this material here is<br/>over my head but I thought I find some intelligent person to lead me to<br/>a source without changing the subject and keeping the same thread.
