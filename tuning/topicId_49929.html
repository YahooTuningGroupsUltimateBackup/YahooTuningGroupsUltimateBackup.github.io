Let me explain more<br/>&gt; clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what I have in mind:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The tuning would be a chain of seven fifths i.e. some form of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; meantone. The dominant seventh chord on the mixolydian tonic<br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; have to approximate 4:5:6:7 and the minor sixth chord on the<br/>&gt; dorian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tonic would have to approximate its utonal counterpart in root<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; position, that is 1/1:6/5:3/2:12/7 (although 16:19:24:27 might be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting too). I&apos;d think maximizing consonance for these with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; something like minimized unweighted RMS-errors or minimax would<br/>&gt; &gt; make<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the fifth much wider than meantone fifth, something close to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pythagorean (around 702 or 703 cents). But that makes major<br/>&gt; thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wide and I think these modes still sound better in 12-equal. Why<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; won&apos;t the optimal tuning sound better than 12-equal?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I calculated an rms-optimum at 701.797 cents for 4:5:6:7 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 16:19:24:27. I&apos;m not sure if this is correct but the tetrads sound<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; bit better than in 12-equal. But the thirds sound worse in<br/>&gt; isolation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I got 702.226 cents for 7-limit consonances only. The minor<br/>&gt; sixth chord sounds pretty much similar to the above.</p><p>Well, you realize that the basic problem is that two of the things you<br/>are trying to optimize are at complete cross purposes. A fifth of 715c<br/>satisfies the seventh, and 696c satisfies the third.</p><p>Do your solutions to you really sound like a 4:5:6:7 chord? In my opinion<br/>12et C:E:G:Bb desn&apos;t sound like a 4:5:6:7 chord, and your solutions are<br/>very close to 12et.</p><p>With some enharmonic magic you can get closer in a single chain of fifths.<br/>Re-spell mixolydian as C D E E# G A A# C (from the contiguous chain<br/>C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E#) and a typical meantone tuning (696.7c<br/>looked good) will make a much better 4:5:6:7 chord. For what its worth,<br/>you also get a 4:5:6:7 on the V chord.</p><p>But the VI chord is hosed.</p><p>And the Dorian is 1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 27/16 7/4, awesome, but maybe not<br/>what you were looking for.</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=49946 href="#49946">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2003 1:09:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Bob Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, you realize that the basic problem is that two of the things<br/>you<br/>&gt; are trying to optimize are at complete cross purposes.

I don&apos;t advocate the use of the rough 12-equal 7-<br/>limit tetrad approximation as a tonic chord. The mixolydian tonic<br/>chord would be the tonic triad but the seventh might be heard as<br/>moderately consonant when played against it.
