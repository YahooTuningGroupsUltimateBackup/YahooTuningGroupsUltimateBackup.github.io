However when classically trained singers or players of fretless string instruments perform<br/>music that is allegedly in some form of just intonation, I wonder how often a performer&apos;s realisation deviates from the theoretically ideal tuning prescribed by a composer. In the case of music where intervals are heard vertically (or simultaneously) rather than horizontally (or sequentially), what<br/>would be the most objective way of knowing when a performer has reached the tuning prescribed by the composer ? How would one go about analysing a performance to determine if the tuning was more like one tuning than another ? In other words while we can know what they are supposed to sing or play, how<br/>do we demonstrate when they are actually doing it ? This seems like an important question to me. I hope it&apos;s not a silly one.</p><p>Greg S</p></div>
