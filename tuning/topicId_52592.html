As<br/>I mentioned, it&apos;s originally set up as a default to<br/>send out six separate MIDI channels for what amounts<br/>to six separate keyboards. The black and white keys<br/>correspond to the black and white keys of a piano,<br/>only in a hexagonal shape for each key and honeycombed<br/>together for up to 72 notes per octave. Each<br/>individual &quot;keyboard&quot; is default-set for one standard<br/>MIDI row of notes, and each note is individually<br/>reprogrammable to any MIDI note or channel. I never<br/>did get the Kurzweil connection to play the music;<br/>instead I got Gigastudio. That&apos;s been tough, because I<br/>have to manually tune every note of every instrument.<br/>I&apos;ve found some shortcuts so tuning a single<br/>instrument now takes about an hour. Not too terrible.<br/>So MIDI Channel 1 plays the first keyboard row, which<br/>I create a separate instrument for and tune each note.<br/>Then MIDI Channel 2, the same instrument copied, then<br/>retuned for the notes I want that instrument to<br/>represent. And so on, for five keyboards. Some day I<br/>may use the sixth keyboard as a &quot;controller&quot;. The<br/>biggest problem was my computer, which had defective<br/>hardware and slowed me down enormously. A good<br/>computer, Gigastudio, the Starrlabs keyboard and a lot<br/>of setup time is all that was needed to set up a<br/>53-equal piano.<br/>So for now, I&apos;m studying W.A. Mathieu&apos;s book, Harmonic<br/>Experience, to learn some good Just Intonation theory<br/>and actually hear what everyone is talking about. No<br/>more technical building of instruments until I get to<br/>learn some actual music for a year or so!<br/>As far as the keyboard goes, because mine was a<br/>prototype it had some signficiant glitches, like keys<br/>rubbing against each other and playing multiple notes,<br/>various crashes etc. It is indeed not very expressive,<br/>though killer glassandi are possible. I don&apos;t think<br/>the aftertouch works on mine, tho newer versions may<br/>well have that. It&apos;s also hard to keep my big fingers<br/>on the key I&apos;m aiming for. I don&apos;t really consider it<br/>a great instrument for performance, but it sure is<br/>great to have an elegantly laid out instrument to<br/>plunk around on. My version is only 288 keys (four<br/>octaves), not the 900 or so of the full-sized model. I<br/>think the full-size version is something like $8000,<br/>and mine was around $3000, but that was four years<br/>ago. I also waited two years for my instrument to be<br/>built, though again that may be because I got one of<br/>the prototypes. I wish I had at least five octaves on<br/>this keyboard, and six would be even better.<br/>Hope this helps; let me know if you have further<br/>questions.<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
