The variation of this interval throught this area of the world is a matter of personal<br/>taste and from what i am told cultural/regonal identity. The idea that there is one and only one neural third is contrary to practice. It is not subjected to the same scutiny that the a harmonic would have. There is plenty of room for all types<br/>of neutral thirds.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Stephen Szpak&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stephen_szpak@hotmail.com">stephen_szpak@hotmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                              Stephen Szpak writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    (Please note this is, I believe your first reply to my original message a<br/>&gt; few days ago.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          I think we&apos;re thinking on 2 separate plains here. You are analyzing<br/>&gt; the Szpak Scale<br/>&gt;    with &quot;odd-limit&quot; &quot;prime-limit&quot; and other terms, and I am looking at the<br/>&gt; scale regarding<br/>&gt;    the harmonics it contains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    If one uses the tonics of the 12 EDO system (ignoring the richness of the<br/>&gt; other half of<br/>&gt;    the Szpak Scale) you have the ability to reach, access, use all of the<br/>&gt; first 12 harmonics.<br/>&gt;    The 12 EDO scale does NOT have the 7th and 11th harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     12 EDO  7th   harmonic        not available<br/>&gt;     12 EDO  11th harmonic        not available<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     24 EDO  7th harmonic         not available<br/>&gt;     24 EDO  11 harmonic          available in 24 tonics<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Szpak Scale  7th   harmonic    available in 12 tonics (the 12 western<br/>&gt; tonic notes)<br/>&gt;     Szpak Scale  11th harmonic    available in 12 tonics  (the 12 western<br/>&gt; tonic notes)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The reason that the neutral 3rd may be slightly off (I guess it is off<br/>&gt; by more than 10 cents)<br/>&gt;     if because of this. The 24 EDO scale, which is what the Szpak Scale is<br/>&gt; based on, is really<br/>&gt;     2   12 EDO scales that have been interlaced. If the first scale is<br/>&gt; untouched the 12 familiar<br/>&gt;     notes of western music are intact. The second scale has to be shifted<br/>&gt; however, if the<br/>&gt;     harmonic 7th is to be included.<br/>&gt;        But here&apos;s the important point. If the second scale is shifted too<br/>&gt; much the 11 th harmonic<br/>&gt;     is lost. The Szpak Scale includes the 7th and 11 harmonics BOTH at less<br/>&gt; than 10 cents off<br/>&gt;     their ideal locations at the expense of losing other ratios. In fact the<br/>&gt; shift of the second<br/>&gt;     scale can only exist (you can check the math if you really want to )<br/>&gt; within a 2.49 cent<br/>&gt;     window. Otherwise the 7th harmonic is off by 10 cents or more  OR   the<br/>&gt; 11 th harmonic<br/>&gt;     is off by 10 cents or more.  I realize that the &quot;10 cent&quot; business is<br/>&gt; arbitrary on my part, but<br/>&gt;     the line has to be drawn somewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       0   58.827    100    158.827   200   258.827   etc. until 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      0 61.317       100    161.317   200    261.317  etc until 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     0  60.88         100    160.88     200    260.88   etc until 1200<br/>&gt; (Szpak Scale)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     I suppose you might have realized all this already. Feel free to get<br/>&gt; back to me either way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Stephen Szpak<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
