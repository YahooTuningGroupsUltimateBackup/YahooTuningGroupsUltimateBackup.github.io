My warmest thanks to Robert Valentine, Joseph Pehrson,<br/>Kraig Grady, and others for their perspectives and insights, although<br/>any flaws in the &quot;intonational fusion/differentiation&quot; hypothesis I<br/>present are, of course, my own responsibility.</p><p>Also, Graham Breed, your remarks raise for me a very interesting<br/>question: does counterpoint have a tendency to favor tunings with<br/>certain characteristics, and if so, is circularity or the more general<br/>quality of regularity a factor here? Since this type of question may<br/>have lots of intricate and often controversial aspects, I&apos;ll save it<br/>for a separate post, responding also to Joseph Pehrson&apos;s remarks on<br/>this kind of question.</p><p>Thanks also to Alison Monteith for recommending what sounds like a<br/>fascinating text on medieval organum and discant, a text I might have<br/>heard about but haven&apos;t yet seen.</p><p>Alison, I want very warmly to agree with your remarks that experience<br/>with medieval materials could be helpful for dealing with various<br/>kinds of tuning systems where transpositions may not be the most<br/>important factor. For example, lots of 12th-13th century pieces have<br/>an immense variety to offer with 7 or 8 notes used per octave<br/>(diatonic notes plus Bb), although other accidentals in the range of<br/>Eb-C# do get used also now and then.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Established styles and the personal touch (Robert Valentine)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Robert Valentine, thank you for raising some very important questions<br/>about motivation and method in learning a given style of Western<br/>European counterpoint -- or any established musical style of any era<br/>in any world culture.</p><p>First of all, I would say that the decision to compose or improvise in<br/>_any_ established style has its own advantages and disadvantages,<br/>whether the style is that of a 13th-century cantilena, a 16th-century<br/>madrigal, a 12-bar Blues or a rock song in a conventional 20th-century<br/>manner, or an opus in extended just intonation after the manner of<br/>LaMonte Young.</p><p>How old or new the style happens to be may not be that important to<br/>the basic point that if one seeks to follow an established style, some<br/>&quot;artificial&quot; conventions or patterns are involved, however natural<br/>they may seem to the composer or performer.</p><p>Of course, one might add: if one has really made a style one&apos;s own,<br/>then there likely will be not only obvious similarities to colleagues<br/>and well-known works, but also some distinctive traits and quirks.</p><p>For example, in a more or less &quot;Vicentino-like&quot; style, I find the<br/>minimal third of 1/4-comma meantone (the augmented second, close to<br/>7:6) rather concordant, and like fifthtone progressions featuring this<br/>interval; Vicentino himself describes it in his treatise of 1555 as<br/>leaning toward dissonance. Here I feel free to be true to my own<br/>taste, which might also reflect my penchant for the narrow minor<br/>thirds of various neo-Gothic tunings.</p><p>This raises a more general point: as someone for whom medieval,<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic, and derivative styles are a routine musical<br/>mode of expression, my &quot;Top 40&quot; so to speak, I nevertheless may have a<br/>different musical and intonational viewpoint simply because I am<br/>immersed in _both_ Gothic and Renaissance practices, and the hybrid<br/>outlook naturally generated from this mixture.</p><p>Personally, I find that a kind of balance may be involved: playing now<br/>a &quot;classic&quot; Gothic or Renaissance style, now in an often classic style<br/>but with some new intervals here and there, and now in something like<br/>20-tone equal temperament (20-tET) where the _neo_-Gothic angle<br/>definitely comes to the fore. Maybe this is a bit like the situation<br/>of a performer with roots in traditional Blues, but lots of rock or<br/>other influences also.</p><p>From this viewpoint, learning counterpoint in a given historical<br/>European style is one example of learning a new style -- whether as a<br/>first musical language, or maybe after an immense amount of experience<br/>with other styles of music, European or otherwise. The motives and<br/>applications can be as varied as the learners.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. For Joe Monzo: on 14th-century polyrhythms and mannerism<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In discussing the 14th century, Monz, you&apos;ve called to my attention a<br/>point not always appreciated.</p><p>While the term &quot;Manneristic&quot; as applied to the late Gothic typically<br/>refers to the last two or three decades of the 14th century and the<br/>first decade or so of the 15th century (say 1370-1410), the elements<br/>of polyrhythm and syncopation reaching a height in this epoch have<br/>indeed been developing throughout the century.</p><p>(For unsuspecting readers, I should explain that while the term<br/>&quot;Manneristic&quot; is often applied to the era of around 1540-1640, Willi<br/>Apel and others have applied it also to the era around 1370-1410,<br/>which is seen to have certain analogous artistic qualities of<br/>complexity and calculated distortion of a &quot;classic&quot; model.)</p><p>As an advocate of the _Ars Nova_ or &quot;New Art&quot; of the early 14th<br/>century, the composer and theorist Philippe de Vitry used the device<br/>of &quot;coloration&quot; -- notes in red rather than the usual black -- to show<br/>a change in meter in a given part. The result is a texture where one<br/>part may be in meter corresponding to the modern 6/8, for example, and<br/>another in 2/4.</p><p>This kind of polymeter reaches its culmination in the &quot;Manneristic&quot;<br/>epoch or _Ars subtilior_ (&quot;more subtle art&quot;) near the end of the<br/>century, when one voice in 9/8 may be set against another in 2/4, for<br/>example, or a 9/8 measure (in terms of modern time signatures) may be<br/>split into two equal parts of 9/16, or a melodic line may take on a<br/>rhythmic pattern such as &quot;3 + 2 + 3&quot; or the like.</p><p>Sometimes I attempt to capture a small part of this in my keyboard<br/>improvisations, with a usual Pythagorean tuning having a beautiful<br/>effect and related neo-Gothic schemes offering some shadings and<br/>variations.</p><p>Anyway, Monz, we both seem to be captivated by this music, and I&apos;d<br/>much agree that in terms of the rhythmic independence of the parts, it<br/>may be the high point at least until the 20th century. There are lots<br/>of recordings by medieval ensembles, including more recent ones on CD,<br/>and one source on these is Todd McComb&apos;s fine Early Music FAQ site:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/</a></p><p>Incidentally, Joe Pehrson, this reminds me of our discussions about<br/>musicology, and your remarks about how it&apos;s curious that _more_ is<br/>known now about medieval or Renaissance music now than in 1700, say.<br/>Maybe both the quest of the 20th century to rediscover as it were the<br/>art of counterpoint apart from 18th-19th century tonality, and the<br/>interest of such styles as serialism in the kind of mathematical<br/>construction practiced by 14th-century composers (e.g. isorhythm),<br/>helped to encourage interest the _Ars subtilior_. Stravinsky, for<br/>example, wrote an introduction to Willi Apel&apos;s collection of 1950,<br/>_French Secular Music of the Late Fourteenth Century_.</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>3. Discant, counterpoint, and florid writing<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>In response to a query from Joe Monzo, I would explain that discant<br/>(_discantus_, literally &quot;singing apart&quot;) is the older term, dating<br/>back to around the 12th century, and counterpoint (_contrapunctus_)<br/>the newer one, dating to around the opening of the 14th century.<br/>However, both terms continued to be used in the 14th-16th century<br/>era.</p><p>Styles other than note-against-note -- &quot;counterpoint&quot; in the strict<br/>14th-century sense -- are sometimes referred to as _cantus fractabile_<br/>or the like if I remember correctly: literally &quot;breakable song,&quot; where<br/>the notes are ornamented or &quot;broken&quot; into smaller values.</p><p>However, medieval discant and late medieval and Renaissance forms of<br/>counterpoint could also generically refer to &quot;part-music&quot; or<br/>&quot;polyphony,&quot; not necessarily note-against-note.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Texture, fusion, and differentiation: Gothic and Renaissance<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Thank you, Robert Valentine and Joseph Pehrson, for some remarks about<br/>&quot;simultaneity&quot; and &quot;texture&quot; which have helped lead me to a distinctly<br/>intonational view of the way in which 16th-century counterpart may<br/>differ from that of earlier 13th-14th century Gothic styles, with the<br/>15th century serving as a kind of transition.</p><p>While people sometimes refer to Renaissance style as more &quot;vertical&quot;<br/>than Gothic style, I tend to respond that both melodic and vertical<br/>dimensions interact in either style, and that it&apos;s quite possible to<br/>find 13th-14th century pieces where we have something like a leading<br/>upper melody supported by accompanying lower parts, as well as<br/>16th-century pieces with all kind of complex interweaving of melodic<br/>strands.</p><p>However, while _simultaneities_ are vital to both styles, I realize<br/>that indeed in one way 16th-century style is more &quot;harmonic&quot; in a<br/>certain acoustical interpretation of that word: sonorities with<br/>closely fused or potentially fused partials pervade the texture, with<br/>other kinds of sonorities subject to rather cautious restraints.</p><p>In other words, apart from suspension dissonances and the like, the<br/>prominent sonorities making up the texture are based on simple ratios<br/>of 2, 3, and 5 (e.g. 4:5:6 or 10:12:15), inviting a pervasive &quot;fusion&quot;<br/>of partials.</p><p>While the stable 2:3:4 trines of Gothic music similarly achieve this<br/>fusion, other sonorities serve from this acoustical perspective to<br/>differentiate the voices and melodic lines even while uniting them in<br/>meaningful and often compellingly directed vertical progressions. We<br/>have a harmonious concourse of stable and unstable ratios, but<br/>something quite different from the seamless or almost seamless fusion<br/>of the 16th century.</p><p>In a _relatively_ concordant Gothic sonority like 64:81:96, or for<br/>that matter a neo-Gothic sonority like 28:33:42 or 14:17:21, the<br/>voices concord to a degree, and yet &quot;are heard to differ greatly,&quot; to<br/>quote a 13th-century description of major and minor thirds as<br/>&quot;imperfect concords.&quot; Sonorities with simpler ratios such as 6:8:9 or<br/>4:6:9 may have a similar effect, because they have &quot;trine-like&quot;<br/>qualities but also major seconds or ninths adding an element of<br/>excitement and tension -- and differentiation.</p><p>When people draw a distinction between Pythagorean and &quot;Just&quot; tunings,<br/>rather than considering the former as one example of the latter, this<br/>may reflect an ideal of &quot;just intonation&quot; as involving a _pervasive_<br/>fusion of the converging melodic lines. This is the distinction made<br/>by scholars such as Carl Dahlhaus and Mark Lindley: thirds and sixths<br/>represent a moment of differentiation in Gothic music based on<br/>Pythagorean intonation (or neo-Gothic music based on typical<br/>temperaments), but a moment of fusion in 16th-century music.</p><p>Both intonational and more general categorical considerations may<br/>contribute to this contrast: in Gothic music, as in much 20th-century<br/>music, just about any category of diatonic interval may be used quite<br/>boldly, with seconds and sevenths often playing a prominent role. In<br/>16th-century music, categories other than thirds and sixths are<br/>subject to a range of restraints (the rules on fifths by parallel or<br/>similar motion, the treatment of seconds and sevenths as incidental<br/>tones or suspensions).</p><p>The intonational factors seem often to mesh with these categorical<br/>ones: Pythagorean or neo-Gothic schemes offer a mix of simple and<br/>complex ratios in prominent places, while Renaissance meantones and<br/>just intonation systems favor simple ratios of 2, 3, and 5.</p><p>In short, &quot;harmony&quot; as a vertical dimension of beautiful ratios,<br/>sonorities, and progressions is common to both eras of discant and<br/>counterpoint. It is &quot;harmony&quot; in the narrow sense of &quot;pervasively<br/>merging partials&quot; which may distinguish the vertical fusion of the<br/>Renaissance from the bold Gothic contrast between fusion and<br/>differentiation as approaches for unifying the parts in an<br/>artistically satisfying whole.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/2/2001 7:24:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

Graham seems to feel<br/>that counterpoint (sorry if I&apos;m speaking for you here Graham!)<br/>flourishes in a CLOSED system... and I could certainly see how he<br/>could come to these conclusions.  HOWEVER, in another of his posts he<br/>seems to feel that, in a contradiction, counterpoint might actually<br/>EXPAND an OPEN system....  Frankly, I might tend toward THIS view,<br/>since it seems if there were possibly MORE notes to use in a system<br/>that hadn&apos;t been used, counterpoint might DISCOVER them!
