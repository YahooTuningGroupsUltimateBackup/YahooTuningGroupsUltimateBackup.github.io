A good notation for composers or<br/>theorists may not be so good for performers, and vice versa.</p><p>Meantone and Pythagorean tunings may be notated entirely with standard<br/>notation. Historically, sharps and their corresponding flats were not<br/>considered to represent the same pitch. In meantone, for instance, A# would<br/>have been pitched lower than Bb, while the opposite is true in Pythagorean<br/>tuning.</p><p>Quartertones, or intervals about half the size of a sharp or flat, may be<br/>represented by accidentals in front of the note. Typical names for these<br/>accidentals are &quot;semisharp&quot; for half a sharp, &quot;sesquisharp&quot; for one and a<br/>half sharps, &quot;semiflat&quot;, and &quot;sesquiflat&quot;. One common symbol for a<br/>semisharp looks like half a sharp sign. Different symbols for semiflats are<br/>in use by different composers. One system of notation that incorporates<br/>these symbols is the notation for 31-TET (31 equally spaced notes per<br/>octave) devised by Adriaan Fokker.</p><p>(<a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/music/notation.htm">http://www.bikexprt.com/music/notation.htm</a>)</p><p>Smaller intervals may be represented by various arrow-like symbols or<br/>numbers above the note specifying deviations in cents (1/100ths of a<br/>semitone) from the standard 12-note equally-tempered pitch. Ezra Sims has<br/>devised a notation for 72-TET (72 equally spaced notes per octave), which<br/>coincidentally provides a good approximation to 11-limit Just Intonation<br/>and is consistent as far as the 17-limit. (See &quot;limit&quot;, &quot;consistency&quot;.)</p><p>(Include link to Ezra Sims&apos; notation here.)</p><p>In his &quot;Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media&quot;, Easley<br/>Blackwood devised systems of notation for each of the equal scales from 13<br/>to 24 notes per octave. In addition to the standard accidentals (including<br/>double sharps and double flats), Blackwood included single and double<br/>circled arrows in both directions, to notate the pitches &quot;in between&quot; the<br/>ones reached by standard notation.</p><p>(Any online illustrations of Blackwood&apos;s notation?)</p><p>For keyboard instruments, notating the actual keys to be played by the<br/>performer, as if the keyboard instrument were tuned the standard way, is an<br/>alternative that might be more practical for the performer than other<br/>systems.</p><p>(Feel free to suggest more alternative notation systems. These are the<br/>first ones that came to mind, but I&apos;m sure there are others that are just<br/>as good.)</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/25/2001 7:15:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19423">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19423</a></p><p>&gt; Q: How can I notate alternative tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A: There is no general, uniform standard for notation of notes or<br/>intervals beyond the traditional chromatic scale.
