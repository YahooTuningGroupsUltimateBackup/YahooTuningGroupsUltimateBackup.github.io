The G4&apos;s are awesome.  Here is a copy of a post I<br/>wrote several weeks ago for a similar question on Irrational (Crazy)<br/>Music on MetaSynth.  What other Mac programs are you using -<br/>SuperCollider or Symbolic Composer? Feel free to respond to me<br/>privately.</p><p>Brian asked</p><p>&gt;    Ditto Mary.  Have MetaSynth and have used it a little. But you<br/>&gt; seem to get a lot more out of it than Yaws Twuwy. Perhaps Mary<br/>could<br/>&gt; post some detailed descriptions of how she teases those exotic<br/>&gt; timbres out of MetaSynth and how she organizes them--a sampler?<br/>&gt; GigaSampler?  Csound?  Or what?</p><p>MetaSynth is a great reason to own a MAC, just like Acid is reason<br/>enough to have a PC.  It truly encompasses worlds within worlds, and<br/>I&apos;ve only explored a few of the possibilites it offers.</p><p>Often times I take symbols that are meaningful to me, like Sanskrit<br/>or the Language of Light, and use those to synthesize a sound.  I<br/>like to take a piece of audio from a piece I am working on, bring<br/>into Metasynth and resynthesize it using the symbols.  It is very<br/>easy to do microtunings in metasynth either TET or by importing<br/>scales from Scala, and I may just run through a bunch of tunings till<br/>I find one I like.  I also like to bring in speech I find<br/>interesting, analyze it to its sonogram, and then resynthesize it<br/>using a sound like gongs or cymbals.  It gives the rythm of speech<br/>with the sound of the instrument.</p><p>Actually I find metasynth works best for me if I just treat it as &quot;a<br/>lab&quot;.  I put together lots of ingredients- pictures and sounds, then<br/>mix rthyms and tunings and just save all the sounds.  This works well<br/>on a second computer because the process is CPU intensive.  Usually<br/>days or weeks later I will then make a big playlist and pick out the<br/>ones I like best, then incorporate them back into the &quot;mother&quot; piece<br/>on another MAC running ProTools.  The most recent ProTools can<br/>convert 16bit into 24 bit now in the import audio window which saves<br/>a lot of time.  MetaSynth is only 16 bit and I use Spark to batch<br/>convert audiofiles from ProTools.  I also am finding that the newest<br/>autoTune works well in the &quot;learn midi(microtuning)&quot; mode as a TDM<br/>plugin.  I wasn&apos;t able to get this feature to work in VST.</p><p>Here are two &quot;standalone&quot; examples.  The Dark Side of DNA takes some<br/>audio composed from DNA code (another post) and mixes it with speech<br/>from an entity talking about traveling through the DNA into the void<br/>(shaman stuff).  I found that allowed me, by listening to the sound<br/>in my trusty mp3 player, to have some very interesting journeys. It<br/>also has done the same for others, but not everybody.   Culminations<br/>was made in a similar way and allows me to feel some of the awesome<br/>potential that the future holds in the genes themselves.</p><p><a href="http://www.elucida.com/DNA_Music1.html">http://www.elucida.com/DNA_Music1.html</a></p><p>Here is a work in progress using some of the techniques I talked<br/>about above.  The picture is what I used in the Image Synth to<br/>resynthesize some of the sounds, including the cymbals you hear<br/>through out the piece.  The tuning for the cymbals is 41 TET and 63<br/>TET which I think I chose because we were discussing 41 and it seemed<br/>to work (Forget how I got the 63).  I also used 72TET, because it has<br/>so many harmonics,  and 96TET which works with it.  Is there a<br/>mathematical reason for that - ie 96 as a harmonic of 72?  Anyway the<br/>speech you here is layered in as a rthym with a 96 tuning.  I also<br/>tried using 59 and 37 with it (that was from the scale tree) but it<br/>didn&apos;t work in this piece.  I moved the audio from MetaSynth around<br/>in ProTools until I felt I had a sense of ancient spaciousness, like<br/>one of the original hydrogen molecules from the big bang floating<br/>around in deep space.</p><p><a href="http://64.225.101.47/Layer4.html">http://64.225.101.47/Layer4.html</a></p><p>As usual it is a long (7mb) download.</p><p>Mary<br/><a href="http://www.elucida.com">http://www.elucida.com</a></p><p> /</p></div>
