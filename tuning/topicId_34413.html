From eigthtones I&apos;d go all the way to<br/>the 144-tet, twenty-fourth tones by augmenting the supra, infra and<br/>mean families:</p><p>first<br/>wide first<br/>narrow supra first<br/>supra first<br/>wide supra first<br/>narrow mean first<br/>mean first/mean minor second<br/>wide mean minor second<br/>narrow infra minor second<br/>infra minor second<br/>wide infra minor second<br/>narrow minor second<br/>minor second</p><p>Of course this leads to situations like calling the just 5/4 something<br/>like a &quot;wide infra major third&quot;, and that sort of thing will always<br/>seem backwards and several other ways amiss to microtonalist... and<br/>therein lies the dilemma!</p><p>Joe, you might be interested in the idea of composing for traditional<br/>instruments in some exotic ETs that you&apos;ve not yet explored using<br/>either the 72 or 144 notation as a template.

The only<br/>&gt; &gt; question I really have is whether to base the basic unadorned<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals on a just or a 12-tet scheme...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; take care,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****Personally, I think this &quot;elaboration&quot; of 72-tET into 144-tET is<br/>&gt; a *wonderful* idea!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping, though, just for &quot;consistency&quot; if the notation is to be<br/>&gt; performed with our past traditions, the basis is 12-tET...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
