So you just need to convince your browser to<br/>&gt; simply handle files with names ending in &quot;.ogg&quot; by simply downloading them<br/>&gt; to a folder.  Then it is icing on the cake if you can also figure out how to<br/>&gt; set the type and creator to match the Audion conventions, but I personally<br/>&gt; could not figure out which of the 20 or so offered file (icon) types to use,<br/>&gt; so I just skipped that part, and have blank icons which I can drag/drop onto<br/>&gt; Audion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (What I can&apos;t remember is whether this is going to expire in 15 or 30 days<br/>&gt; at which point I will have to pay.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene gave some links on his site for how to handle ogg files.
