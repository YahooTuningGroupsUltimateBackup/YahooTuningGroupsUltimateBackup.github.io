Even Partch&apos;s Diamond, and the 22 scale<br/>comprising the 1-3-7-9-11-15 eikosany is epimores throughout, accept one place where you have<br/>adjacent opposite functions. In fact all your Lambdomas result in Epimores. He feels it is a kind<br/>of &quot;bedrock&quot; and the simplest of interval relationships, that although not required, is a good<br/>indication that the scale one has constructed is good.</p><p>Daniel James Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; I couldn&apos;t agree more. English has never really decided whether to<br/>&gt; prefer Latin to Greek roots, and in this case, we&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; Latin roots which are actually based on Latin translations from<br/>&gt; Greek.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am profoundly against the accumulation of unnecessary neologisms,<br/>&gt; but these are hardly new, and belong to the established basics in the<br/>&gt; field.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, whether or not an epimore is of real musical importance is<br/>&gt; another issue. (One thinks of the great baseball statistian Bill<br/>&gt; James&apos; dispassionate analysis of the error count, where he concluded<br/>&gt; that it was a statistic that had no relevance to the outcome of a<br/>&gt; game. Nevertheless, errors remain a basic of baseball knowledge, an<br/>&gt; historical staple of early baseball theory).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In support of the epimoric, Lou Harrison has often cited the marked<br/>&gt; increase in resonance in tetrachordal tunings composed of epimores.<br/>&gt; Even when figuring in a diminished return on resonance as the<br/>&gt; numerator increase, this seems like a generally supportable empirical<br/>&gt; observation from a significant musician.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
