Let me assume you mean a 12-out-of-31 chain of fifths, which is<br/>nearly identical to QCMT. Some nice surprises in either: an augmented second<br/>is nearly a just 7/6, an augmented sixth is nearly a just 7/4, and those<br/>awful diminished fourths are actually very close to a just 9/7 -- pretty<br/>dissonant on its own but nice in certain chords like 4:5:6:7:9. Did you mean<br/>a different 12-out-of-31?</p></div>
