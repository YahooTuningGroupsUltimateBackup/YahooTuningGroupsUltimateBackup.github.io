(Very occasionally there<br/>&gt; will be invisible and spurious characters in a text file that<br/>&gt; cause Csound to crash, but that&apos;s the fault of the word<br/>&gt; processor, not Csound.)</p><p>I have been busy lately and only following the list<br/>loosely. I will get caught up eventually and make some<br/>points about various things that have come up that I think<br/>important, but I REALLY must momentarily step in here in<br/>defense of proper design, before people get the wrong<br/>idea. Bill&apos;s statement I suppose reflects an unfortunate<br/>fact that much software we are forced to deal with is<br/>deeply flawed and that unfortunately many people have come<br/>to expect that as normal and uncorrectable.</p><p>In defense of proper engineering, let me say the<br/>following:</p><p>If you have a program that *crashes* when reading a text<br/>file that has &apos;spurious&apos; characters, or incorrectly<br/>formatted information, or whatever, then you have a<br/>program with serious bugs that should be corrected.</p><p>When encountering odd, unexpected input, a program<br/>(perhaps ESPECIALLY a batch mode program like csound for<br/>which there is really to excuse not to other than<br/>incompetance and/or extreme laziness and/or profund<br/>sloppiness) should do something like one of these:</p><p>1. Automatically correct the input if possible</p><p>or</p><p>2. Notify the user that the file has problems,<br/>   helpfully identifying the line # and type of<br/>   error encountered.</p><p>I have used csound myself occasionaly for designing and<br/>prototyping effects before I code them in C or whatever<br/>and have not encountered these kinds of errors, but I<br/>doubt I have fed csound &apos;weird&apos; files either. But you know<br/>what, people DO feed programs weird files and inputs from<br/>time to time. It is to be expected. It is not the fault of<br/>the user or the word processor. It is not even a case of<br/>bad design. It is a case of bad coding. Bad input happens<br/>all the time and if your program cannot robustly deal with<br/>it gracefully and helpfully, then your program has a flaw<br/>that needs to be corrected.</p><p>But please, let&apos;s not say that this situation is the best<br/>we can expect. Dealing with spurious input in a batch<br/>program is such a simple and common problem that it really<br/>should be corrected.</p><p>Other than that, I agree with Bill&apos;s advice.</p><p>I&apos;ll add that csound is not for everyone.</p><p>It is not the same as building your own instruments.<br/>To experience that, you need to WRITE csound.</p><p>Yes, csound could be made into something completely<br/>different -- a word processor perhaps, or maybe a totally<br/>graphical synthesizer. But the engineering time would be<br/>unjustified unless someone wanted to do it just for fun.<br/>There are plenty of fine text editors out there, many of<br/>them totally free. And there are better programs available<br/>that do more and have better features if you want<br/>graphical editing -- like PD. So I would not advise anyone<br/>to hold their breath, or put off doing creative and<br/>interesting stuff while waiting for csound to become<br/>something it is not.</p><p>At this time I think it would be appropriate to note that<br/>I have typically found a self-defeating attitude among<br/>many would-be composers that they &quot;can not&quot; do anything<br/>because they don&apos;t have the right technology, or it is not<br/>available at the right price, or it doesn&apos;t come in the<br/>right color, or whatever. As an example, I will mention an<br/>extremely well known computer music researcher who<br/>believed himself a composer but had written absolutely<br/>nothing that anyone could remember ever since he wrote an<br/>article &apos;proving&apos; that the MIDI interface was too slow for<br/>serious music. He knew that someday though, people would<br/>realive he was write and there would be something better.<br/>When that happened, he would once again be able to write<br/>music. It&apos;s true that MIDI is relatively slow compared to<br/>how it could be if the world was perfect but let&apos;s face it<br/>-- MIDI is here to stay and it&apos;s long past time to deal<br/>with it.</p><p>If anyone recognizes in themselves that they have all<br/>these big plans and they never even get started on them,<br/>much less finish them because of an ever changing ongoing<br/>set of excuses, the fact is they need to get their act<br/>together, sit down and do something with what they have<br/>and stop talking about it. I often hear from many people<br/>about their great ideas and if 1/10th of 1% of the<br/>population acted on any of their great ideas, all the<br/>world&apos;s problems would have been solved a long time ago.<br/>Let&apos;s stop talking and start writing music, designing<br/>beautiful things, building them, raising gardens, planting<br/>flowers, finding things to praise in others, being nice to<br/>our friends and neighbors, treating others better, driving<br/>less, producing less garbage, polluting less, and helping<br/>other people along more.</p><p>[These remarks are general remarks along these lines that<br/>I make often and are most definately NOT directed at<br/>anyone that I know of on this list. I assume that all of<br/>you write music.]</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s frustrating to me that people find so many of these<br/>&gt; problems, because it turns them off from a very powerful tool,<br/>&gt; especially for tuning. No doubt the reason it is coming up on<br/>&gt; the tuning list is that, unlike most synthesizers, it is not<br/>&gt; tied to any particular tuning model. I have used it several<br/>&gt; times for &quot;free-style&quot; JI, something very, very difficult with<br/>&gt; any conventional acoustic or MIDI solution.</p><p>Yes, csound is a fine general purpose tool for what it is<br/>-- a sound design and composition programming language for<br/>compiling music and audio. Using csound is the same as<br/>writing music on paper -- you don&apos;t hear it right away (in<br/>&apos;real time&apos;), you hear it later. But csound is much more<br/>precise than standard notation and in fact is perfectly<br/>precise. It is probably not suitable as a method for<br/>generating scores to be followed by human performers,<br/>nor as a tool for composing improvisationally.</p><p>I suppose I think that every composition student should<br/>learn csound or one of its cousins -- I think it<br/>is accurate to say that both csound and PD and cmusic<br/>and perhaps others are descended from Music V. Even if you<br/>don&apos;t use it (or Neapolitan 6ths, say), you should know<br/>what it is and how it works. It&apos;s a basic skill and<br/>might come in handy some day.</p><p>But, like music theory and western music notation, it can<br/>be rather confounding to learn without a teacher and I<br/>sympathize with and encourage all who are taking the leap.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=21684 href="#21684">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>4/27/2001 8:21:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff,</p><p>Thanks for this profoundly true bit of advice, and the depth to takes<br/>to convey it.
