What<br/>&gt; about the 11-limit? There&apos;s probably a cut-off point where the music becomes<br/>&gt; incomprehensible in a folk tradition, especially when the system begins generating<br/>&gt; numerous intervals that could potentially compete for the same function (e.g.,<br/>&gt; subminor vs. minor third).</p><p>the 13th are found in Alp horn melodies and Kathleen Sclesinghers book. The Greek Aulos can give you all types of example of higher subharmonics as<br/>found on equally spaced holes on flutes. often we finfd the exit hole tuned to a 3/2 of on of the harmonics.</p><p>&gt; Contemporary higher-limit JI developments since Partch<br/>&gt; represent an important artistic tradition, but not a folk tradition.</p><p>There were quite a few persian scales developed not by using the concept of limits , but by using Means, hence causing some higher numbers to come<br/>out of their series. If with the greeks you find thistrend toward means.</p><p>&gt; If the &apos;people&apos; can&apos;t<br/>&gt; find the notes intuitively, the tradition will always remain hyperspecialized and won&apos;t<br/>&gt; infiltrate the general artistic culture.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there is a general artistic culture as much as the european builds as many walls around hinmself to protect himself from future shock</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, by those criteria, it&apos;s amazing that 12tet ever emerged, but the piano and<br/>&gt; its proto-ilk are to blame (along with other factors, I know). I&apos;d argue that 12tet is<br/>&gt; STILL not truly in practical use in Western music, but that&apos;s another thread. -Justin</p><p> I think most here on this list would agree with this. It happens very couple of years whether we want it to or not.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
