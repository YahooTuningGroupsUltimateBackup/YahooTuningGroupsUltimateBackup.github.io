Probably the reason no one felt compelled to reply. However, unlike Daniel, you didn&apos;t mention it as the beginning of a thread that said &quot;Serialism is the *best* way to write music, and people who have been writing music in other ways are mistaken. And all that music would sound better if we just serialized it.&quot;</p><p>&gt; This place is sounding more and more like any other Conservatorium<br/>&gt; with each successive digest. (Emphasis on conservative!)</p><p>Don&apos;t know how long you&apos;ve been on, but this place ebbs and flows quite a bit. But I can tell you that of the people I know here that have actively created music, or actively developed the basis for a music (consisting of one or more &apos;alternate&apos; tuning systems) - well, the stuff is pretty much all over the map. Some of it conservative, yes; some of it not that at all.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t see anything which says that a committment to<br/>&gt; microtonality is a prerequisite of membership, just an open and<br/>&gt; enquiring mind.</p><p>Of course. And Daniel, being a heads-up young lad, knew enough that when he posed his intial query he&apos;d get a lot of responses. 12tet has it&apos;s place, and there are zillions of places to explore it; there are damn few places to explore everything else, and this is one of those places.</p><p>&gt; Everybody has to start somewhere, and even Partch composed 12-ET<br/>&gt; music in his early years, before giving up, burning the lot, and<br/>&gt; starting again from the _true_ basics.</p><p>Hey, he&apos;s talking *my* subject! Yep, he sure did. And when he learned about what you refer to as the &quot;_true_ basics&quot;, he had to find that out all on his own, in a burdonsome and laborious exercise in low-rent scholarship and musical archeology. I have often wondered what would have happened (and wished, now, that I had asked him when he was alive) if there was a support network of people like the tuning list for him to bounce ideas off of. Even ideas like &quot;virtually all music would sound best in 12tet&quot;.</p><p>&gt; but really; in the final analysis, is there _really_ any criterion<br/>&gt; for adherence to a particular tuning system other than personal<br/>&gt; preference?</p><p>No, there isn&apos;t, which was one of my main thrusts to Daniel: you can&apos;t expect all music to get squeezed into one mold, which is what he is &apos;asking&apos; us to accept.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps this sort of reception explains why there are some five<br/>&gt; hundred lurkers on the list; maybe they feel just a trifle<br/>&gt; intimidated...?</p><p>Hardly. You must have missed this in one of my first replies to Daniel: &quot;Look, I mean this in all good intent. ASCII is awful at portraying feelings, so don&apos;t take any &apos;mean-ness&apos; in my writing.&quot;</p><p>To which he replied &quot;np&quot;, the universally accepted acronym for &quot;no problem&quot;. I&apos;ve also since complemented him on his music, having taken the time to go and check out his personal site. I&apos;ve also chided a colleague for what I think *was* a hasty rejection of Daniel out-of-hand - everyone should get a fair shake on this, or any forum.</p><p>I don&apos;t back down on anything I&apos;ve said to D, and I haven&apos;t had time tonight to reply to his latest to me (which needs doing, youbetcha). Give Daniel credit for having conviction and curiousity - I do, else I wouldn&apos;t waste my time trying to open some more doors for him to go through.</p><p>&gt; I have said my say.
