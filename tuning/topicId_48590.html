There are 7*6/2 = 21<br/>intervals to consider. So you plug in the dissonances of the 21<br/>intervals in the appropriate places in the 7-dimensional distance<br/>matrix, and you use MDS to scale that down to 2 or 3 dimensions.<br/>These, and similar results for some 10- and 12-note scales (and up to<br/>4 dimensions), are what i posted.

If you<br/>wish to use a curve of the Plomp-Levelt-Sethares family, the<br/>simplest &quot;cheat&quot; would be to simply average the curve from 0 to 1<br/>octave with the &quot;mirror&quot; curve going from 1 octave to 0. This would<br/>build octave-equivalence into your dissonance measure, as required.<br/>However, I&apos;ve avoided Sethares&apos;s curves because they have a scaling<br/>problem, and I&apos;ve used octave-equivalent harmonic entropy for this<br/>purpose instead.</p><p>&gt; &gt;So one doesn&apos;t need to worry about the condition for the metric<br/>&gt; &gt;being satisfied -- the dimension reduction implies some fitting<br/>&gt; &gt;anyway, and of course Euclidean space will end up satisfying<br/>&gt; &gt;the metric anyway.

G is<br/>excellent with C alone, but B and D are terrible, they do not even<br/>appear as local minima; 3 octaves up at 2112Hz, we get a deep but<br/>wide minima near D and a bit higher than B-flat ( but never B!).<br/>Perhaps this very weakness can be construed as a strength, though.<br/>The notes of the G chord serve two functions:</p><p>G, B and D fill in large interval gaps in (C-E-F-A-C)<br/>B has the leading tone property to C ( cf.

So their Plomp-Levelt-Sethares<br/>dissonance with C is completely irrelevant, since Plomp-Levelt-<br/>Sethares dissonance concerns the behavior of *simultaneously sounding<br/>tones*, not the behavior of tones vs. a keynote, or anything else.</p><p>It seemed to me your page was treating the notes of the major scale<br/>as if they were to be sounded against C and against C only, never<br/>against one another. This may be what happens in some Eastern and<br/>isolated Western styles, but not in the &apos;mainstream&apos; of Western music<br/>from the Renaissance through Romantic periods.</p><p>&gt; As far as scaling in Sethare&apos;s equation, are you referring to<br/>&gt; the fact that the dissonance &quot;bump function&quot; of 2 pure tones<br/>&gt; changes shape depending on the absolute pitch of the tones?</p><p>No, but that&apos;s another point where harmonic entropy ends up being<br/>more convenient.</p></div><h3><a id=48632 href="#48632">ðŸ”—</a>victorcerullo &#x3C;moog@libero.it&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2003 11:31:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>&gt; So you plug in the dissonances of the 21<br/>&gt; intervals in the appropriate places in the<br/>&gt; 7-dimensional distance matrix, and you use<br/>&gt; MDS to scale that down to 2 or 3 dimensions.</p><p>May I ask you what monotonic transform of the dissonance<br/>function did you use in the case of Sethares&apos;s equation?</p><p>&gt; If you wish to use a curve of the<br/>&gt; Plomp-Levelt-Sethares family, the<br/>&gt; simplest &quot;cheat&quot; would be to simply average<br/>&gt; the curve from 0 to 1 octave with the &quot;mirror&quot;<br/>&gt; curve going from 1 octave to 0.
