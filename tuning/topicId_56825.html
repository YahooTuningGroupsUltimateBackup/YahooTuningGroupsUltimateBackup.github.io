Last night he performed<br/>Variation II by John Cage for piano and tape.  The tape was three<br/>synthesized keyboards (harpsichord, electric piano and celesta).</p><p>The instruments were each tuned to 12 tone EQ BUT, each<br/>instrument was separated from the others by 25 cents -- giving a<br/>total of 48 note EQ.</p><p>What was interesting for me was that this microtonality was so<br/>totally disguised in the music.  Perhaps because so many of the<br/>sounds were disconnected and so my ear had little chance to<br/>reference the pitches.</p><p>Still, a very interesting effect.  Comments welcome...</p><p>I had the great opportunity to talk at length with GM and he was<br/>delightful:  with many insights and showing interest in music and<br/>musicians, obscure and distant.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p></div>
