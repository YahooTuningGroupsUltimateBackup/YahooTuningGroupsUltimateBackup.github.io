Maybe the notes being so far apart makes<br/>the spectra so unrelated, that we can no longer make sense of what we are<br/>hearing.  How else would you explain this phenomenon?</p><p>On a related note, Is it possible to produce a pure sound of a sine wave<br/>with no additional partials whatsoever?  Even the sound resonating in our<br/>hearing mechanisms would produce some partials.

Isn&apos;t that where the prime number theory came in?</p><p>No sir. Although I would say that 3/2 is more consonant than 4/3, in my<br/>usual work in music theory I treat them as equally consonant, since they are<br/>octave-equivalent. That is because they both have an ODD limit, or greatest<br/>odd factor, of 3. In the context of octave-equivalence, odd limit (up to<br/>about 11 or 13) is a fine measure of consonance, better than anything that<br/>incorporates prime factorization. An examination of Harry Partch&apos;s<br/>&quot;One-Footed Bride&quot; reveals that he used odd limit as a measure of<br/>consonance.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m really sorry I missed this one.
