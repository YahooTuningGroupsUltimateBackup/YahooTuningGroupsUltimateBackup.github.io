Intsruments that provide a<br/>fixed scale but allow the movement of individual notes (to a degree),<br/>the addition and subtraction of notes, and possibly even extremely<br/>exact systematic manipulation of notes (which might require computer<br/>assistance).</p><p>A clavichord with moveable keys. A magstrip-style slide clarinet after<br/>Bart Hopkin with very thin, adjustable keys. A synthesizer with extra<br/>keys hiding in the interior, waiting for you to pull them out should<br/>you need them. (I&apos;ve hoped for some of these on the Yahoo<br/>new_instruments group.)</p><p>I have long wanted to try a piece in a generalized diatonic scale<br/>where the &quot;generalized&quot; is accentuated by having the scale be warped<br/>*in real time* by a controller-controlled generator.  Well, it turns<br/>out that Marcus Satellite has been doing this.<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.perfectbuzzmusic.com/music/Continuum5/continuum5.01.html">http://www.perfectbuzzmusic.com/music/Continuum5/continuum5.01.html</a>&gt;<br/> (link made known to me by X.J. Scott) (awesome awesome stuff) This is<br/>a possible use for the aforementioned computer control of uber-precise<br/> pitch.</p><p>Whew.</p></div>
