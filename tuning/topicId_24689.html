But it occurred to me as I<br/>was listening to a recording of Pachelbel&apos;s Canon that the harmonic<br/>progression doesn&apos;t have any comma pumps, making it a perfect candidate for<br/>5-limit JI tuning. So I did a MIDI arrangement:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/canonj5.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/canonj5.mid</a></p><p>Sounds pretty nice, doesn&apos;t it? Then I started playing around with some<br/>more unusual tunings. The usual meantone scales sounded good, as expected.<br/>Scales with good approximations to 5-limit JI (like 34- and 72-equal) also<br/>work out well. The 7-limit approximations of 22-equal added a nice flavor.<br/>Even 15-equal sounded good, in contrast to what most music not specifically<br/>written for it does when played in 15! So I tried it in 23-equal, thinking<br/>it would bring out some more discordant harmonies (which it did), but it<br/>still didn&apos;t sound really bad, just different. Even warped 11- and 13-equal<br/>versions at least sounded somewhat pleasant and the harmonic progressions<br/>were still recognizable, although the melodic lines started to get really<br/>bent into strange forms.</p><p>I haven&apos;t tried non-octave scales yet; I figure they&apos;d probably break<br/>everything into dissonance. But I&apos;m thinking of doing retuned versions in a<br/>variety of different temperaments and putting them up on a &quot;Warped Canon&quot;<br/>page. Any suggestions for tunings that might sound interesting?</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>6/9/2001 8:10:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Okay, that might be a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p>Especially to anyone in a string quartet (or married to someone who<br/>is) or similar group that have played the Canon x million number of<br/>times at weddings and would like to dig up Pachelbel and kill him all<br/>over again!!!  &lt;g&gt;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2001 8:16:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/9/01 10:05 PM, &quot;Herman Miller&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So I tried it in 23-equal, thinking<br/>&gt; it would bring out some more discordant harmonies (which it did), but it<br/>&gt; still didn&apos;t sound really bad, just different.</p><p>Well first I have to agree with your subject line.</p><p>Some classical pieces are seemingly<br/>so rich with a kind of universal content,<br/>that they&apos;ll pretty much sound good anywhere.</p><p>And I just wanted to sympathize,<br/>I too thought something would sound wrong in 23,<br/>and it really didn&apos;t sound too bad.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 8:46:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, just to come back at 90 degrees, if not 180, from your post, I<br/>downloaded your sequence &amp; threw it at my adaptive methods.
