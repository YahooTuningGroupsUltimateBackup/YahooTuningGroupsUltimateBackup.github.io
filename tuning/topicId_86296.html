Well I used the minor triad as 16:19:24 as an example with the intention of doing more but surprisingly all the possible combo&apos;s were such a good match that I thought it unnecessary to say any more. You could use the ~ GCD formula to try say the major triad as 64:81:96 and any other chord you think of. I&apos;d be interested to know the results myself.</p><p>-Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read your paper  very good!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What happens with other chords?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Feb 11, 2010 at 9:44 PM, rick &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve uploaded a file which after many years and failed attempts, I finally<br/>&gt; &gt; finished yesterday.
