However, it seems whenever there is<br/>a &quot;vote&quot; on this matter, the majority of people don&apos;t really want to<br/>move.  And then there is the question of all the &quot;sister&quot; lists,<br/>which people use quite a bit as well.</p><p>Moving 500 people is quite a task, and most probably people<br/>should &quot;sign up&quot; but my guess is that a lot of people would continue<br/>to use *this* list, so there would be, essentially, TWO lists, unless<br/>this one could be taken down... and then we lose the archive.</p><p>The archive feature is also something to consider.  We can easily<br/>*link* as it stands now.</p><p>My guess is that the &quot;migration&quot; won&apos;t happen, and probably<br/>*shouldn&apos;t* happen unless this list totally goes &quot;belly-up&quot; as the<br/>old Mills list did.</p><p>Then, that would be quite a *powerful* incentive to move it!  :)</p><p>J.

Try posting your generous offer there.</p><p>The discontinuity of the archives is a worry. Robert Walker can do<br/>amazing things with archives. Could you talk to him about possibly<br/>getting the tuning-math archive in place on your server in the right<br/>form, so we can then add to it. There could be a brief interval when<br/>the yahoogroups tuning-math list is closed and the list-server isn&apos;t<br/>yet open, for the moving of the archive.</p></div><h3><a id=36119 href="#36119">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2002 10:35:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve got the go-ahead from the sys-admin at the Columbia University<br/>&gt; Computer Music Center to put the tuning-list on the majordomo-thingy<br/>&gt; there.</p><p>Hooray!</p></div>
