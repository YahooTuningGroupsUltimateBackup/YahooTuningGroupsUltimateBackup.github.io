I first saw the agreement when I wanted to post my<br/>message and go home.  I didn&apos;t have much time to study it, but some of it<br/>looked suspicious, and I only copied the most suspicious paragraph.  I<br/>didn&apos;t twig that this group is a &quot;Yahoo! Group&quot; although the URL clearly<br/>indicated that it is.</p><p>&gt; Also, the permission is terminated as soon as one removes ones file -<br/>&gt; i.e.<br/>&gt; they can&apos;t continue to include it on the site once one has clicked the<br/>&gt; delete<br/>&gt; button to remove it.</p><p>Yes.  I don&apos;t think even that paragraph applies to our files section,<br/>because it&apos;s members only.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s how I read it anyway, and I think if you look carefully, you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not sure what the other clause is about, but since it excludes Yahoo<br/>&gt; Groups<br/>&gt; specifically, it is nothing to do with us.</p><p>So long as the file list is part of the Group, and isn&apos;t public.  I think<br/>we&apos;re okay, I would still like clarification.</p><p>&gt; I think one can assume the license agreement will have been worked out<br/>&gt; to be acceptable to all concerned. After all, there is probably a<br/>&gt; Lawyer&apos;s Yahoo group somewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :-)</p><p>No, because an agreement like this was originally applied to Geocities.  I<br/>think that former paragraph is the rephrased version they came up with<br/>after the ensuing protest.  It looks much more reasonable, but I still<br/>wouldn&apos;t put it past them to try the same trick again.</p><p>I assume you saw the &quot;UK/Ireland&quot; license as well.  Note that some of it<br/>appears to have been drawn up in the light of the recent French case.</p><p>           Graham</p></div>
