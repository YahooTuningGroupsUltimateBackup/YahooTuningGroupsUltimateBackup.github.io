In the<br/>&gt;context of<br/>&gt;        C   D   G<br/>&gt;       1/1 9/8 3/2</p><p>&gt;I think the &quot;fifth of the fifth of the fifth&quot; will be perceived<br/>&gt;rather than a mistuned 5/3 (mistuned to become more harmonious!).</p><p>&gt;My guess is that sounding 27/16 with</p><p>&gt;        C    D   G<br/>&gt;       1/1 10/9 3/2</p><p>&gt;the 10/9 will be perceived as the &apos;wrong&apos; note.</p><p>&gt;Similarly in</p><p>&gt;        C    D   G    A<br/>&gt;       1/1  9/8 3/2  5/3</p><p>&gt;I think the 5/3 will be perceived as flat.</p><p>I absolutely agree with these and they are perfect illustrations of what I<br/>was trying to say:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Certainly one will find [ratios of higher powers of low primes] in many<br/>chords built mainly of consonant<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals, but if you compare the intervals themselves, and really try to<br/>&gt;&gt; listen for &quot;objective&quot; dissonance, I think you&apos;ll find that I&apos;m right.</p><p>So we are agreeing!</p><p>&gt;What I believe they<br/>&gt;show is my belief that the strong pocket at 3/2 (shown in your graphs)<br/>&gt;can (somehow) carry over into a strong pocket on the &quot;3/2 of 3/2&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s because there is an additional note sounding, so your &quot;strong pocket&quot;<br/>at the 3/2 of 3/2 is really nothing more than a pocket at 3/2 for the<br/>interval formed with the additional note.</p><p>&gt;The other point is that in all these cases, what I believe will be<br/>&gt;the perceived as &quot;correct note&quot; is also the &quot;overtone series note&quot;.</p><p>Well, that point I would contest, since in these examples you could voice<br/>the chords differently and the &quot;correct&quot; notes would not longer be<br/>octave-equivalent to overtones of the lowest note.</p></div>
