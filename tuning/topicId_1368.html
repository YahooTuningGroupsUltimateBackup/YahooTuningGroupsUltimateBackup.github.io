One reason it doesn&apos;t yet is that I&apos;m finding myself doing<br/>&gt; things in fixed tunings that a dynamic algorithm would stomp all over.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll be glad to assist anyone working on this sort of thing.  I can<br/>&gt; explain how to get MIDI working in Windows if nothing else.</p><p>Talk about Murphy!  I really NEEDED help just a couple of months ago,<br/>when I first tried to write programs to perform MIDI I/O on a PC (I had<br/>done it on a NeXT for some time, but of course the calls are completely<br/>different!).  It would run fine, then blow sky-high.  I FINALLY realized<br/>I needed to compile /MT to get the multi-threaded libraries, because I<br/>was allocating memory both in the callback routine and the main loop.</p><p>But I STILL need help on a related subject: the low-level programming<br/>needed to record and play back .wav files.  I&apos;m especially interested in<br/>getting digital input from an audio CD, so that I can manipulate the<br/>data and play it in real-time.  Does anybody know how to do this?</p><p>(I&apos;m running Microsoft Developer Studio 4.0, 32-bit).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
