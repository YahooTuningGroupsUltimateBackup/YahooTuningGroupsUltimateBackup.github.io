Instead, subsets of each dekany seemed<br/>to form the most important local melodic units and the dekany as a whole<br/>formed the collection or pool of harmonic resources.  I am fond of the<br/>ambiguous character of the dekanies, but just can&apos;t call them scales.</p><p>(2) Carl Lumma</p><p>Rothenberg&apos;s main source of information about Indonesia was Suryabrata, a<br/>Dutch-Indonesian  with an interesting autobiography but not a serious source<br/>of information about tunings. (His book, _The Island of Music_ has some<br/>interesting things among many howlers).  Relevant to Rothenberg, the idea<br/>that change in the pitch of a gamelan over time would lead to changes in the<br/>perceived tuning has got to be tempered (as it were) by the fact that<br/>Javanese owners of gamelan retune their instruments when they go out of tune,<br/>if they can afford it, just as piano owners would. Even the most valued old<br/>instruments (i.e. Kyai Kanyu Mesem in the Istana Mankunegara) have been<br/>retuned in recent memory.  The situation in Sunda is somewhat different to<br/>that of Central Java, although Rothenberg seems to use the two<br/>interchangeably, but largely because of the existence of a speculative<br/>theoretical tradition in Sunda. This, however, had little or no relevance to<br/>or impact on performance practice. Andrew Weintraub&apos;s dissertation covers<br/>this topic well.</p><p>I know of one example, in the gamelan Selonding of Tenganan, Bali, where the<br/>tuning of one pitch on one set of instruments shifted enough to require<br/>transposing the repertoire, but this was more-or-less an ordinary shift in<br/>the series of fifths, and the net result is modulation by a fifth.</p><p>(3) Joe Monzo:</p><p>Your take on MOS&apos;s is very good.  Wilson&apos;s work divides largely into two<br/>parts, with the melodic systems generated by &apos;linear series&apos; on the one hand,<br/>and the harmonic systems (CPSs, Diamonds etc.) on the other, with the<br/>keyboard mappings and notation designs linking both kinds of systems in<br/>practical designs.</p><p>I would only like to add in emphasis that in the MOS&apos;s, whether in a<br/>temperament or in just intonation, not only are the linear series of<br/>generating intervals subtended by the same numbers of tones, but the melodic<br/>intervals within the generating intervals are exactly symmetrical over the<br/>entire linear series.</p><p>Thus, the pentatonic scale C,D,F,G,A generated by 4/3s in the series<br/>A-D-G-C-F-(A) exhibits the following symmetry:</p><p>A 32/27 C 9/8 D<br/>              D 32/27 F 9/8 G<br/>                            G 9/8 A 32/27 C<br/>                                          C 9/8 D 32/27 F<br/>                                                        F 9/8 G 9/8 A</p><p>In a five-limit just version, with two sizes of generating intervals, the<br/>melodic symmetry is preserved coarsely but not exactly.</p><p>(4) For Kraig Grady and Joe Monzo: Wilson&apos;s term &quot;subtend&quot; is standard<br/>English usage, while &quot;freshman sum&quot; is standard mathematics. In fact, I<br/>happened to be at the table when (the composer/mathematician) David Feldman<br/>told Wilson that he was taking freshman sums.</p></div>
