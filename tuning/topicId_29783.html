A rather orthodox adherence to Yavorsky&apos;s theory<br/>is organically combined with a personal, original style and a fully<br/>developed musical aesthetical position, very much attuned to certain<br/>trends in early 20th century art, including music, literature and the<br/>visual arts: the bold stylistic innovations of the Futurists, the<br/>Romanticism and search for new mythological semantics of the<br/>Symbolists and the metaphysical cosmogony of the Suprematists.<br/>   Protopopoff&apos;s musical innovations could be compared to those of<br/>Alexander Scriabin and Igor Stravinsky as well as the lesser-known<br/>early 20th century Russian avant-garde composers, forming<br/>the &quot;forgotten generation of Russian composers&quot; of which Protopopoff<br/>is definitely a part. Among these composers, whose legacy has begun<br/>to be revived in the mid-80&apos;s, one could mention such names as<br/>Nicolai Roslavetz, Arthur Lourie and Alexander Mosolov.<br/>   Protopopoff, similarly to many other composers of his generation,<br/>has undergone the influence of Scriabin, especially in his late, post-<br/>tonal style, his new harmonic language with its specific structural<br/>system, as well as the spiritual legacy of Scriabin&apos;s music and<br/>philosophy. Notwithstanding a very strict adherence to Yavorsky&apos;s<br/>theoretical system and the extreme schematic and structuralistic<br/>qualities inherent in it, Protopopoff&apos;s music contains a strong<br/>influence of Scriabin in its harmony, instrumental textures and<br/>general musical aesthetical qualities. Yavorsky himself was greatly<br/>influenced by Scriabin&apos;s musical legacy and in his theoretical system<br/>one can trace many similarities to the structure of Scriabin&apos;s late<br/>musical style. Nevertheless, Yavorsky&apos;s theoretical system could not<br/>be reduced to adhering to Scriabin&apos;s harmonic discoveries, since<br/>their primary structural elements and concepts were derived from<br/>totally different sources and points of reference. Nevertheless, it<br/>might be worthwhile to bring out a tri-lateral scheme of Scriabin&apos;s<br/>influence (most of all, the influence of his harmonic language),<br/>forming a triangle: Scriabin: Protopopoff, Yavorsky:Protopopoff and<br/>Scriabin:Yavorsky:Protopopoff.<br/>   Scriabin&apos;s harmonic style (speaking exclusively of Scriabin&apos;s late<br/>style, starting from his &quot;Prometheus&quot;) is very structural and<br/>schematic in its essence, however it was formed by Scriabin<br/>throughout the course of many years of search and musical evolution,<br/>which ultimately led to an &quot;emancipation of dissonant intervals.&quot;<br/>Protopopoff&apos;s harmonic language, carrying in itself many<br/>correspondences and parallels to Scriabin&apos;s harmonic system, is from<br/>its source much more schematic in its origins, it follows more<br/>definite prescribed rules. Those musical &quot;laws,&quot; which in Scriabin&apos;s<br/>music are created in a more spontaneous manner, which he himself<br/>freely adheres to, modifies and transgresses at will, in<br/>Protopopoff&apos;s music are determined much more exactly and<br/>all &quot;transgressing&quot; and &quot;liberalizing&quot; of these laws, are carried out<br/>likewise forming a much more lengthy and clearly perceivable process.<br/>Nevertheless, Protopopoff&apos;s music maintains an assortment of<br/>Romantic, highly expressive and spiritually exalted qualities, which<br/>are inherent in Scriabin&apos;s music, even going as far as in such cases<br/>Protopopoff&apos;s music being less strictly structured and schematic than<br/>Scriabin&apos;s. Russian theorist Evgeny Kosiakin (in his<br/>article &quot;Scriabin and Russian Avant-garde Composers) writes about<br/>Scriabin&apos;s influence on the succeeding Russian avant-garde composers<br/>(to the category of which Protopopoff belongs): &quot;Despite all the<br/>sharpness of the struggle of the avant-garde composers against<br/>Scriabin&apos;s ideology, the depth of spirituality, coming out of<br/>Scriabin&apos;s music, exerted a great amount of influence on their<br/>creative output). One could assume that it was this depth which<br/>guarded them from excessive rationalism and dryness, tendencies<br/>towards which could be determined in their theoretical<br/>constructions. &quot; Protopopoff&apos;s music successfully carries out such<br/>organic symbiosis of Scriabin&apos;s musical and spiritual legacy with<br/>more cerebral, constructivistic aesthetical trends of the 1920&apos;s, the<br/>decade during which Protopopoff wrote most of his important<br/>compositions: his three Piano Sonatas as well as numerous songs for<br/>voice and piano to the texts of Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov,<br/>Sergei Lipsky, as well as longer and more elaborately developed songs<br/>on folk poems and folk tales (&quot;The Crow and the Lobster,&quot; &quot;The Hermit<br/>Fox&quot; and &quot;The Tale of the Wondrous Whistle&quot;).<br/>   The structural qualities of Protopopoff&apos;s music, as has been<br/>stated earlier, is in many ways similar to Scriabin&apos;s constructive<br/>qualities of his late style. The main feature is forming the basis of<br/>musical compositions on a central chord or scale, as well as formed<br/>hierarchies of chords and scales. Nevertheless, whereas Scriabin&apos;s<br/>innovative harmonic system served in his case as a means to further<br/>elaboration on and refinement of his already existing means of<br/>expression of his late Romantic style, Protopopoff&apos;s structural<br/>language serves him to pursue aims which are extremely different from<br/>Scriabin&apos;s - it is utilized to create large-scale, coldly-abstract<br/>constructive musical forms, which is the case mostly in his Piano<br/>Sonatas and, to a slightly lesser degree in his vocal compositions.<br/>While Scriabin creates extremely contrasting changes of moods and<br/>pungently mystical and emotional conditions, Protopopoff for the most<br/>part maintains a steady, persistent statically-exalted mode of<br/>expression, by which he evokes certain similarities with the<br/>Eastern &quot;non-linear&quot; aesthetics, as manifested in Japanese &quot;frozen<br/>landscapes&quot; as well as Indian raga.<br/>   The harsh, urbanistically-constructive attitude in Protopopoff&apos;s<br/>music, showing itself most notably in Protopopoff&apos;s pungent, dry and<br/>at the same time Romantically bravura piano technique, have certain<br/>similarities with the aesthetics of Cubism as demonstrated in the<br/>geometric forms in the art works of Russian Cubist and Suprematist<br/>painters, such as Kazimir Malevich, V. Tatlin, I. Matyushin and I.<br/>Chashnik (especially prominent in Malevich&apos;s famous painting &quot;The<br/>Black Square&quot;). It is also similar in part to the constructivistic<br/>musical language of Alexander Mosolov. Nevertheless one can discern a<br/>sharp difference between Mosolov&apos;s and Protopopoff&apos;s music. The<br/>technically elaborate and urbanistically virtuosic piano textures of<br/>Mosolov, though in many ways similar to those of Protopopoff, in the<br/>case of the former carry a more extravertively-expressive character<br/>of music, a more outwardly flashy and theatrical manner of presenting<br/>the musical material. Among the compositions, which especially<br/>demonstrate these qualities, one can mention his bravura modernistic<br/>arrangements of folk music of peoples of Central Asia (such as, for<br/>instance, &quot;Turkmenian Nights&quot; for piano), as well as his<br/>programmatically descriptive pieces, depicting machines (most notably<br/>the &quot;Iron Factory&quot; for orchestra). Unlike Protopopoff, Mosolov hardly<br/>gives any thought to strict pitch organization - it is present in a<br/>very sporadic and unorganized manner, mostly emphasizing thematic<br/>repetition or development. Mosolov&apos;s harmonic language is for the<br/>most part &quot;freely atonal,&quot; very improvisatory in its manner and more<br/>focused on searching for new piano textures for their own sake<br/>independent of pitch structure consciousness, as well as more<br/>attention to the directness of audience perception. Protopopoff&apos;s<br/>similarly urbanistic textures and aesthetical qualities are more<br/>abstract, cold and introvertive. Similarly to the futurists,<br/>Protopopoff aims at distancing himself from the programatic-<br/>descriptive musical language of the 19th and the early 20th century,<br/>focusing himself on &quot;absolute,&quot; an immersion into abstract sounds and<br/>sonorities for their own sake.<br/>   In this light it is especially interesting to compare<br/>Protopopoff&apos;s music with the music of his contemporary Arthur Lourie,<br/>a composer, who has most fully aligned himself with the Futurist<br/>movement. Most notably in Lourie&apos;s atonal compositions of 1913-1917,<br/>such as his &quot;Syntheses&quot; and &quot;Formes dans l&apos;air&quot; both for piano and<br/>the First String Quartet, one can see many points of similarity with<br/>the music of Protopopoff: the qualities of athematicism (in the case<br/>of Protopopoff a varied kind of athematicism in the form of a<br/>hermetically strict monothematicism), complete discarding of<br/>traditional structures in melody, harmony and form, as well as a<br/>centralized function of a leading harmonic structure. Both composers<br/>create new constructivist forms, at the core of which lie a<br/>continuous varied development as well as division into episodes,<br/>which are extremely contrasting from each other texturally.<br/>Nevertheless, in Lourie&apos;s compositions, the abstraction and the<br/>athematicism play a much greater role than in Protopopoff&apos;s music and<br/>the former composer pays a great deal less attention to the leading<br/>organizing role of scalar and harmonic constructions, in his case<br/>they change freely and sporadically.<br/>   The difference between the legacy of Protopopoff and that of the<br/>leading composer of the Russian musical avant-garde, Nicolai<br/>Roslavetz, could be established very clearly. A strict adherence to<br/>classical sonata form, present in Roslavetz&apos;s work, adequately<br/>combined with the new harmonic language, which the composer labels<br/>as &quot;the new system of organizing sounds,&quot; is for the most part absent<br/>in Protopopoff. An emotionally exuberant Romantic-Expressionistic<br/>manner, along with the spontaneous dramatic climaxes and recessions -<br/>all these features, which make Roslavetz&apos;s music so close to<br/>Scriabin&apos;s, are apparently as remote from Protopopoff&apos;s even-tempered<br/>and distinct juxtaposition of textural units and emotional moods into<br/>lengthy blocks of time. The main difference is in the harmonic<br/>systems of Roslavetz and Protopopoff, though here too there are many<br/>similarities. Roslavetz&apos;s system of the &quot;synthetic chord&quot;,<br/>notwithstanding its innovative qualities, is based essentially on<br/>slight modifications of the traditional tertial harmony. Often<br/>the &quot;synthetic chords&quot; contain elements of diatonic scales and<br/>consist of combinations of several major or minor trichords piled one<br/>on top of the other. Frequently the combination of trichords in<br/>certain &quot;synthetic chords&quot; could even contain trichords, carrying the<br/>harmonic functions (in the context of traditional, tonal theory) of<br/>tonic, dominant and subdominant chords, though not necessarily<br/>utilized in that manner or with that intent in the new system. For<br/>instance in the song &quot;You have not left&quot; for soprano and piano by<br/>Roslavetz, set to the poem of Alexander Blok, the &quot;synthetic chord&quot;<br/>contains an Ab minor trichord (carrying the presumable &quot;tonic&quot;<br/>function), an Eb minor trichord (with the presumable &quot;dominant&quot;<br/>function) as well as the note Fb (bringing in the &quot;subdominant&quot;<br/>element). Roslavetz never denied the concept and function<br/>of &quot;tonality&quot; in his works, though he preferred to replace it with<br/>the concept of &quot;new tonality&quot;, a term which gives the most adequate<br/>definition to not only Roslavetz&apos;s system but also those of late<br/>Scriabin and Protopopoff. This is yet another point of similarity<br/>between Roslavetz&apos;s harmonic system and those of late Scriabin and<br/>Protopopoff. Scriabin, along with Roslavetz and Protopopoff, utilizes<br/>his harmonic constructions in such a way as to bring in modified<br/>functions of &quot;tonic,&quot; &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;subdominant,&quot; along with all<br/>the possible transpositions of them. The similarity is also present<br/>in the usage of non-harmonic &quot;dissonant&quot; tones, which<br/>either &quot;resolve&quot; to the &quot;consonant&quot; notes present in a respective<br/>harmonic construction, or serve as means to &quot;modulate&quot; into a new<br/>harmonic construction. Nevertheless there exists a sharp difference<br/>between the system of Roslavetz on one hand and those of Scriabin and<br/>Protopopoff on the other hand, which has been most successfully<br/>formulated by Kholopov: &quot;...Roslavetz presents himself as a<br/>phenomenon coming later in time than Scriabin. The latter had indeed<br/>worked with chords as the leading element of his harmony. (...)<br/>Roslavetz, though naming the central element of his harmonic series<br/>as a &quot;synthetic chord,&quot; realizes it musically in all effect more<br/>serially than harmonically&quot; . Other major points of difference are<br/>that Roslavetz in general, unlike both Scriabin and Protopopoff, does<br/>not make an emphasis on presenting dominant-seventh sounding<br/>qualities in his &quot;tonic&quot; chordal constructions (presenting a greater<br/>amount of allusions to diatonic &quot;minor&quot; harmonies, unlike Scriabin&apos;s<br/>and Protopopoff&apos;s more insisting allusions to diatonic &quot;major&quot;<br/>harmonies), nor does he emphasize any inner symmetries within the<br/>horizontal, scalar manifestations of his &quot;synthetic chords&quot; nor give<br/>any special functional importance to the interval of the tritone.<br/>   Having compared the musical legacy with that of a number of the<br/>most notable representatives of the Russian musical avant-garde of<br/>the 1910&apos;s and the 1920&apos;s, we can proceed to discerning some of the<br/>basic principles of his compositional techniques, which requires that<br/>we examine an analyze the musical theory of his teacher Boleslav<br/>Yavorsky, which, along with Scriabin&apos;s harmonic language, played a<br/>crucial role in the development of Protopopoff&apos;s musical thinking.<br/>   The theoretical system of Yavorsky is well-known by the few books<br/>published during his life, dedicated to this theory. First of all,<br/>one can name the book of Yavorsky, called &quot;The Construction of the<br/>Language of Music,&quot; which was published in 1908. The most detailed<br/>and concise summary of the theory of this theory is in Protopopoff&apos;s<br/>own book &quot;Elements of Constructions of the Language of Music&quot; in two<br/>volumes, written under Yavorsky&apos;s guidance and published in Moscow in<br/>1930. Other summaries of the theory include smaller scale and less<br/>detailed descriptions in articles by Yavorsky and Protopopoff, most<br/>of them yet unpublished, as well as descriptions in books and<br/>articles by Dernova, Victor Zuckermann and Yuri Kholopov in Russia,<br/>Detlev Gojowy in Germany and Gordon Mcquere in the USA. As is well-<br/>known, the key element of music in Yavorsky&apos;s theoretical system is<br/>the interval of the tritone. Being a dissonant interval, the tritone<br/>naturally requires to be resolved: the diminished fifth (B-F) is<br/>resolved into the major third (C-E), the augmented fourth (B-E#)<br/>resolves into the minor sixth (A#-F#). In this manner, the<br/>intervallic distance between these two possible resolutions also<br/>turns out to equal to a tritone. (C-E and F#-A#) (Example 1).<br/>   This resolution in Yavorsky&apos;s system is given the function of<br/>a &quot;dominant&quot; resolution. A &quot;subdominant&quot; resolution is formed by<br/>moving from the interval of a perfect fifth (D-A), through a<br/>dissonant passing interval of a doubly-diminished fifth (D#-Ab) into<br/>a consonant interval of a minor third (E-G). The equivalent tritone<br/>transposition results in the resolution of the interval G#-D# through<br/>Gx-D into the consonant A#-C# (Example 2). From the combination of<br/>the dominant and subdominant resolutions the various harmonic<br/>systems &quot;scalar-modal units &quot; (&quot;lad&quot; in Russian) are formed. The most<br/>important and stable among the &quot;scalar-modal units&quot; is the<br/>major &quot;scalar-modal unit&quot; (Example 3). In conmbination with the<br/>tritone transposition, a &quot;double-scalar-modal unit&quot; is formed<br/>(Example 4). A complete combination of the dominant and subdominant<br/>progressions in conjunction with their tritonal transpositions is<br/>labeled in Protopopoff&apos;s book as a &quot;complete major double-scalar-<br/>modal unit&quot; (Example 5). Different diverse juxtapositions of the<br/>dominant and subdominant progressions result in other &quot;scalar-modal<br/>units:&quot; the minor (Example 6), the augmented (Example 7), the<br/>diminished or the &quot;chain&quot; (Example 8) and many other scalar-modal<br/>units, including much more complex and irregular ones. According to<br/>Yavorsky (as well as to Protopopoff), this theory can be applied to<br/>any kind of music: folk music, tonal, atonal (or rather, &quot;newly-<br/>tonal&quot; in the context to the music examined in the book) and even<br/>microtonal. Protopopoff&apos;s book examines all of these different types<br/>of music, successfully applying Yavorsky&apos;s theory to each one of<br/>them.<br/>   In the section of the book devoted to folk music, when applying<br/>Yavorsky&apos;s theory to unaccompanied melodies, Protopopoff still<br/>carries out the analysis, examining the melodic contour of the<br/>melodies by splitting the two-voice dominant and subdominant<br/>progressions into separate one-voice progressions using either the<br/>upper or the lower part of the two-voice progression to carry out the<br/>analysis, i.e. individually examining the resolution of either B to C<br/>or F to E in a melodic line, implying the dominant progression or the<br/>resolution of A (via an assumed Ab) to G or D (via an assumed D#) to<br/>E, implying the subdominant progression. The analysis of tonal music<br/>needs no further explanation as the theoretical system is more<br/>clearly fit to analyze music which is based on the relation between<br/>tonic, dominant and subdominant scale degrees. The musical examples<br/>used in this major section of the book include compositions by Bach,<br/>Chopin, Liszt and early Scriabin. When examining works by late 19th<br/>century composers, the book gives a good example of how well<br/>Yavorsky&apos;s theory could be applied to music with extended tonality,<br/>by analyzing it with less regular scalar-modal-units formed from more<br/>irregular combinations of the dominant and subdominant resolutions<br/>and, particularly by frequently utilizing the &quot;chain&quot; scalar-modal-<br/>unit. The final section of the book presents a section devoted to<br/>possible interpretation of microtonal music by means of this theory,<br/>which works generally the same way in an extended manner, utilizing<br/>such intervals as the quarter-tone, third tone and sixth tone. Though<br/>not containing any music examples, due to lack of available musical<br/>repertoire, this section speculates on possible music, which might be<br/>written in the future by means of extending this system to the<br/>microtonal realm and implies a suggestion or even an invitation to<br/>composers of the future to attempt to compose such microtonal music<br/>which, nevertheless, would fit this all-encompassing theory.<br/>   When examining examples of post-tonal harmony (we can label it<br/>this way to avoid the totally inadequate term &quot;atonal&quot;) when<br/>analyzing the compositions of late Scriabin as well as his own<br/>compositions, Protopopoff applies the theory of Yavorsky. The new<br/>functional basis of the analysis of the compositions become<br/>the &quot;double-scalar-modal units:&quot; the major (Example 5), the &quot;chain&quot;<br/>(Example 9) and the augmented (Example 10). When these &quot;scalar-modal<br/>units&quot; are presented in a purely horizontal linear-scalar form, a<br/>number of symmetrical scales or modes are formed (often similar or<br/>identical to Messiaen&apos;s &quot;modes of limited transposition&quot;), though<br/>frequently with the addition of &quot;passing tones,&quot; (formed from the<br/>dissonant passing intervals in the dominant and subdominant harmonic<br/>progressions), which are not contained in these scales, but are used<br/>as &quot;dissonant&quot; tones, which are meant to resolve into<br/>the &quot;consonances.&quot; The most frequently resulting scale formed from<br/>this horizontal presentation is the octotonic (&quot;whole-step half-step)<br/>scale. The vertical, harmonic manifestation of the scalar-modal unit,<br/>based on the resolving ditones, contains its own independent<br/>functional sound hierarchy, in which the first in importance are the<br/>two &quot;tonic&quot; pitches, in this case the pitches C and F#, the second in<br/>importance are E and A# and third in importance are G and C#, all of<br/>which determine the tonal sources of this system. Next come<br/>the &quot;unstable,&quot; &quot;dissonant&quot; scale steps, the most prominent among<br/>which are pitches present in the &quot;dominant&quot; progressions, i.e. B and<br/>F (or B and E# in the tritone transposition) and those present in<br/>the &quot;subdominant&quot; progressions, i.e. D and A (and, consequently, G#<br/>and D#) along with the &quot;passing tones,&quot; leading to the resolution,<br/>i.e. D# and Ab (consequently, Gx and D). (Example 11).<br/>   In Protopopoff&apos;s musical compositions one can discern<br/>two &quot;harmonic styles,&quot; resulting from two different ways of applying<br/>Yavorsky&apos;s theory to his music. The &quot;strict harmonic style&quot; is formed<br/>in such compositions which for the most part (or sometimes entirely)<br/>adhere to one fixed horizontal scale or mode, most frequently the<br/>octatonic scale (though usage of other formed scales are possible in<br/>the &quot;strict style&quot; as well), presenting different transpositions of<br/>this scale in different sections of the given composition, with<br/>virtually no deviation from this horizontal scale and almost no<br/>incursions of &quot;dissonant&quot; tones, not pertaining to the scale. This<br/>harmonic style is achieved by utilizing only the major and the chain<br/>scalar-modal-units, which in their purely horizontal aspects<br/>emphasize the octatonic scale. The &quot;free harmonic style&quot; involves<br/>usage of a greater amount &quot;dissonant&quot; pitches, avoids strict<br/>adherence to any one harmonic scale, such as the octatonic scale<br/>(except in certain sections when they are needed for structural and<br/>dramatic emphasis) and either uses the regular scalar-modal units<br/>(such as the major and minor) in a freer manner, making greater usage<br/>of all the dissonant intervals or uses more irregular constructions<br/>of scalar-modal-units and at times even combinations of several<br/>scalar-modal-units simultaneously in one piece or section of<br/>composition, allowing a greater freedom of pitch and oscillations<br/>between modal centricity and freer purely chromatic harmonies,<br/>bordering on complete atonality.<br/>   In all of Protopopoff&apos;s compositions these &quot;double-scalar-modal<br/>units&quot; or &quot;double-scalar-modal-units&quot; are notated above the beginning<br/>of the section involved on an auxiliary fragments of staves as a<br/>means of indication and clarification for the analysis of the harmony<br/>of a given composition. In the large-scale compositions, first of all<br/>in the three piano sonatas, the schemes of the double-scalar-modal-<br/>units are presented in the beginning of each section of the work, in<br/>which a new form of a scalar-modal unit or a new transposition of the<br/>preceding form. In the smaller compositions, most notably in the<br/>songs, only one scalar-modal unit is used, which is carried out<br/>throughout the entire composition. A very complex type of scalar-<br/>modal unit, quite irregular in its structure, is used in the song for<br/>soprano and piano &quot;The Hermit Fox&quot;, set to folk texts of the<br/>Arkhangelsk region of Russia. Two double-scalar-modal units,<br/>symmetrically distant from each other by the interval of a tritone,<br/>form one more complex form of a scalar-modal unit forming a &quot;double-<br/>double-scalar-modal-unit,&quot; which could even be called a &quot;quadruple-<br/>scalar-modal-unit&quot;. The first half of each &quot;double-scalar-modal-unit&quot;<br/>consists of two dominant progressions, forming a &quot;chain progression,&quot;<br/>while the second half of each &quot;double-scalar-modal-unit&quot; presents two<br/>subdominant progressions and resolutions, forming a conjunction of<br/>two double systems of the octatonic scale (Example 12).<br/>   In itself each of the two individual &quot;double-scalar-modal-units&quot;<br/>presents itself as the basis of a minor seventh chord C-Eb-G-Bb and<br/>its tritone transposition F#-A#-C#-E (formed from the lowest notes in<br/>all the consonant ditones), which does not form a regular symmetrical<br/>type of scalar-modal-unit. Nevertheless the lowest pitches of the<br/>first halves of each respective &quot;double-scalar-modal-units&quot; form<br/>respectively the chords C-Eb-F#-A (Example 13) and F#-A-C-Eb (Example<br/>14), which brings out the hidden symmetries of this unusual scalar-<br/>modal unit.<br/>   Obviously as a result in &quot;The Hermit Fox&quot; a much greater amount of<br/>modal freedom is achieved in terms of a greater availability of<br/>pitches and pitch correlation, resulting from a greater amount<br/>of &quot;dissonant&quot; tones present in the structure of the scalar-modal<br/>unit. This does not presume, though, an absence of structural<br/>correlation nor that atonal &quot;anarchy&quot; is present, but that a greater<br/>chain of levels of &quot;modality&quot; is present and a greater amount of<br/>gradations from a strict adherence to the octotonic scale (formed<br/>from a horizontal spreading out of the major and/or chain scalar-<br/>modal-units) through a whole scale of deviations from it by means<br/>of &quot;dissonant&quot; passing tones, various types of &quot;subsidiary&quot; modal-<br/>scalar units and a more or less free type of &quot;atonality&quot; achieved by<br/>the means of the first two elements. The latter does not present<br/>itself in a dominating form and does not infringe on the sovereignty<br/>of the &quot;quadruple-scalar-modal-unit&quot; but shows itself in the role of<br/>its &quot;polar antithesis&quot;.<br/>   In addition to the songs, the most important and significant<br/>compositions, written by Protopopoff in the 1920&apos;s, are the three<br/>piano sonatas. The First Piano Sonata, completed in 1920 and<br/>published as opus 1, dedicated to his teacher, Boleslav Yavorsky, is<br/>a three movement work, where the new harmonic system, already present<br/>in full, is successfully combined with yet a more traditional<br/>Romantic Lisztian type of piano textures and more or less standard<br/>classical sonata forms. The Third Sonata, finished in 1928 and<br/>dedicated to the memory of Leonardo da Vinci, presents itself as the<br/>most large-scale and brilliant composition, both in terms of piano<br/>textures and in terms of applying his teacher&apos;s theoretical system;<br/>in this work Protopopoff achieves the highest level of excellency and<br/>mastery in the usage of a great variety of textural means for the<br/>piano as well as the demonstration of the expressive means<br/>of &quot;constructivist&quot; and &quot;cubist&quot; trends in music. The Sonata is<br/>written in a &quot;free style&quot; in terms of application of Yavorsky&apos;s<br/>scalar-modal-units, where, similarly to the song &quot;The Hermit Fox,&quot; a<br/>greater amount of freedom is achieved in terms of deviating from a<br/>given strict horizontal scale by means of using a greater amount of<br/>scalar-modal-units with greater amount of dissonant notes, which,<br/>when applied in composition, make up for freer usage of the complete<br/>chromatic spectrum by means of greater amount of gradations between<br/>consonant and dissonant non-harmonic pitches and the resolution of<br/>the latter into the former. In certain sections one could find a<br/>stricter adherence to the octatonic scale (Example 15) while in other<br/>sections there is a greater drive toward free atonality, where,<br/>nevertheless, the connection with the dominating modality is kept<br/>(Example 16).<br/>   In the Second Sonata, which we shall examine in greater detail,<br/>despite strong influences of Scriabin&apos;s music, the individual traits<br/>of Protopopoff&apos;s mature style are already present. The composition<br/>was completed in 1924 and, likewise to the First Sonata, dedicated to<br/>Yavorsky. From the perspective of harmonic language, the Second<br/>Sonata is written in a more &quot;strict style&quot; than the First and Third<br/>Sonatas. It incorporates the octotonic scale, derived from<br/>the &quot;complete major&quot; and the &quot;chain scalar-modal-units&quot; almost<br/>throughout the whole composition with a minimal amount<br/>of &quot;deviations&quot; into the domain of &quot;auxiliary&quot; pitches, which,<br/>nevertheless, are very important in the context of the structural<br/>development of the Sonata.<br/>   The Sonata contains nine sections and, hence, nine transpositions<br/>of respectively the major and the chain scalar-modal units. A<br/>presentation of all nine indications of the scalar-modal-units, as<br/>presented at the beginning of each section by means of the auxiliary<br/>fragments of staves, could be demonstrated here, being at the same<br/>time the plan of the harmonic system of the entire Sonata (Example<br/>17). Many of these sections are precede by supplementary sub-<br/>sections, serving either as introductions or as tail-pieces to the<br/>individual sections; they are rhythmically unmetered and feature<br/>rumbling passages of parallel chords or ditones (starting out with<br/>ditones of parallel fifths in the first few sections and then<br/>deviating to other intervals as well as fuller chords) (Example 18).<br/>These passages with the parallel fifths obviously present the most<br/>clear deviations from the &quot;strict style&quot; of the octatonic scale and<br/>the usage of &quot;dissonant tones,&quot; though in this context, the rather<br/>simple usage of the &quot;dissonant tones&quot; as parallel tones to<br/>the &quot;consonant&quot; harmonic tones presents a rather elementary almost<br/>textbook demonstration of &quot;dissonance&quot; to perspective future scholars<br/>of Yavorsky&apos;s theory.<br/>   The basic &quot;melodic&quot; line of the passage does not extend the<br/>boundaries of the octatonic scale, while the pitches in the doubling<br/>lines correspond not only to &quot;passing dissonant&quot; tones, which are<br/>present in Yavorsky&apos;s double-scalar-modal units, but also to the two<br/>parallel transpositions of the octatonic scale, derived from the<br/>horizontal presentation of the complete major scalar-modal unit.<br/>   Throughout all of the Sonata&apos;s nine main sections, the concept of<br/>modal (in terms of the octatonic scale with almost no &quot;passing<br/>dissonant&quot; tones) and thematic unity is carried out in full. The<br/>primary motive of the Sonata, consisting of an ascending minor second<br/>and a descending major third, is developed according to the principle<br/>of monothematicism (Example 19).<br/>   Despite the virtually complete absence of direct usage of sonata<br/>form in this work, the latter is present in a more modified form: the<br/>first three sections of the work could in general terms be likened to<br/>an exposition of a sonata. They are connected by their exclusive<br/>usage of complete major scalar-modal-units, whereas all the following<br/>sections, with the exception of the last, incorporate the chain<br/>scalar-modal units, which are much less stable &quot;tonally.&quot; The<br/>recapitulatory function of the ninth and final section is emphasized<br/>by a return to the usage of the complete major scalar-modal-unit in<br/>the primary &quot;tonality&quot; (Bb-E).<br/>   The allusions to sonata form in this composition could be<br/>continued to be brought out in terms of the descriptive qualities of<br/>the textural usage in each of the respective sections. In the first<br/>section of the Second Sonata, after the initial introductory passage<br/>the primary theme is presented in a heroic, bravura passage, common<br/>to many primary theme groups of standardly formed sonatas (the<br/>author&apos;s remark written in Italian - &quot;apello, minacioso&quot;<br/>i.e. &quot;calling out, soaring&quot;) (Example 20). The passage is 15 measures<br/>long, not including the first long unmetered passage featuring the<br/>introduction.<br/>   In the second section, after its respective introductory passage,<br/>the main theme is presented in a more lyrical and calm manner, which<br/>is frequently associated with subsidiary theme groups (the author&apos;s<br/>remark: &quot;dolcissimo, soave, accarezzando&quot; i.e. &quot;very sweetly,<br/>suavely, caressing&quot;) (Example 21). This section utilizes the complete<br/>major scalar-modal-unit with the tonality of D-Ab.<br/>   The third section resembles a conclusory theme group in its<br/>further elaboration of the calm textures and mood, presenting the<br/>main theme echoed by a discant canonic imitation a major sixth above<br/>the main melody. Here the &quot;complete major scalar-modal-unit&quot; is<br/>presented in a different transposition (F#-C), suggesting an<br/>autonomous musical clause. The third section ends with a louder<br/>dynamic mark with more dynamic chordal and arpeggiated piano<br/>textures, suggesting a completion of a large section of the<br/>composition.<br/>   A change of the scalar-modal-unit type and the incursions of<br/>contrasting restless-dramatic passages in the fourth section clearly<br/>resemble a beginning of a development section of a sonata form. This<br/>effect is enhanced by the juxtaposition resembling a &quot;confrontation&quot;<br/>between more diminuted fragments, some of which resemble the<br/>introductory passages and others resemble the previous main sections<br/>with a full-textured statement of the leading motive, each of these<br/>contrasting fragments becoming slightly longer with each<br/>presentation. This section switches to the chain scalar-modal-unit<br/>with the tonality of Eb-A (or Eb-F#-A-C). The fifth section is<br/>texturally much more sparse and emotionally calmer and utilizes<br/>polyphonic means of development, presenting an extreme contrast to<br/>the preceding and the following sections. The chain scalar-modal-unit<br/>is presented in the tonality of Db-G (or Db-E-G-Bb). The sixth<br/>section, the most dramatic in the whole Sonata in its character,<br/>presents a gradual movement towards a climax, resembling a slow march<br/>with a steady march accompaniment in the left hand, emphasizing the<br/>adherence to the theory of the &quot;double-scalar-modal-units&quot; by its<br/>insistence on the two pitches of C and F#, two important pitches in<br/>this section returning to the tonality of Eb-A as presented by the<br/>chain scalar-modal-unit. The whole section has two regularly changing<br/>meters of 3/4 and 5/4, a steady crescendo from the dynamic mark of pp<br/>to that of fff, and presents images of a lofty, grandiose and at the<br/>same time fantastically-grotesque procession (the author&apos;s<br/>remark: &quot;maestoso, elevato&quot; i.e. &quot;with majesty, in an elevated<br/>manner&quot;.) The unmetered introductory passage is here presented as a<br/>coda to the sixth section, dispelling the heightened drama of its<br/>music.<br/>   The structural functions of the seventh and eighth sections are<br/>less explicitly clear. In terms of harmonic design (i.e. by their<br/>continued usage of the chain scalar-modal-units) and their texturally<br/>and emotionally episodic character, they resemble more of episodes<br/>within the structure of the development section, though in the<br/>context of the large-scale form of the composition as well as their<br/>thematic usage and development of the main motive of the piece they<br/>could likewise be associated with the &quot;conclusory&quot; and &quot;subsidiary<br/>theme groups&quot; in a reverse recapitulation of a sonata form. Both<br/>sections lack the unmetered introductory arpeggiated passages. The<br/>seventh section, incorporating the tonality of E-Bb (or E-G-Bb-Db) of<br/>the chain scalar-modal-unit, presents a scherzo type of texture with<br/>many grace-notes and light arpeggiated textures. The eighth section,<br/>returning to the Eb-A tonality of the chain scalar-modal unit, is<br/>slow, lyrical and features a chorale-type texture, each chord<br/>introduced with free-rhythm arpeggios. This section likewise has a<br/>regularly changing succession of 3/4 and 5/4 meters.<br/>   The ninth section, presented in the &quot;tonic&quot; Bb-E tonality of the<br/>major scalar-modal unit, starts with an introductory unmetered,<br/>arpeggiated passage, after which the section proper presents a<br/>curiously eclectic mixture of textures, starting with the heroic,<br/>bravura presentation of the main theme as in the first section,<br/>(demonstrating this section&apos;s definite recapitulatory function),<br/>which after two measures turns into a grotesque scherzo dance with<br/>extended unmetered measures. The initial bravura theme returns a<br/>second tone only to be interrupted once more with the same humorous<br/>scherzo-like passage after which the main theme returns for the third<br/>and last time, followed by a recurrence of the introductory unmetered<br/>arpeggiated passage presented as a coda to the ninth section and the<br/>whole Sonata, finishing off the whole work in a loud dramatic<br/>textural flurry.<br/>   In its form, resembling that of a sonata form with a reverse<br/>recapitulation as well as by it emotional moods the Sonata has some<br/>similarities with Scriabin&apos;s &quot;Prometheus&quot;. Nevertheless Protopopoff&apos;s<br/>aesthetical position still distances itself from both direct<br/>application of sonata form and from direct dramatically-descriptive<br/>means of expression, inherent in the music of late Romanticism. Many<br/>of the musical problems of formal development and the juxtaposition<br/>of the various musical sections are solved by Protopopoff in a<br/>strictly structural and cerebral manner. Especially noticeable are<br/>the differences in the interpretation of the apotheosis in the final<br/>section of Scriabin&apos;s &quot;Prometheus&quot; with that of the final, ninth<br/>section in Protopopoff&apos;s Second Sonata, which carries out the same<br/>function - it seems to give, purposely and with a large amount of<br/>irony, a reinterpretation of the concept of the climax<br/>in &quot;Prometheus,&quot; which in this case is carried out with the means of<br/>the more constructive musical language of the 1920&apos;s.<br/>   In this manner, holding on to the connections with the spiritual<br/>and musical quests of his time (the latter in terms of a search for<br/>new modal and harmonic musical systems) and successfully combining in<br/>his music many elements of the various diverse artistic trends and<br/>movements of his time Sergei Protopopoff organically obtained a<br/>rightful position in the history of music. The position, which he<br/>obtained was by no means constricted by the dogmas of Yavorsky&apos;s<br/>theory but rather greatly inspired in a creative manner by the newly<br/>opening perspectives which they had to offer.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2001 2:11:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; I forgot to include a recent article that appeared by Anton Rovner<br/>on<br/>&gt; Protopopoff... who was, indeed, involved in microtonality:</p><p>Well, it&apos;s unclear from this how fully Protopopoff worked out his<br/>microtonal theories, let alone whether he actually ever heard any<br/>tuning system other than 12-tET . . . but it looks (based on the<br/>allusion to quarter-tones and sixth-tones) as if he may have seen the<br/>same role for the tritone in microtonality as it plays in<br/>tonality . . . while in my theory, I generalize the tritone using the<br/>notion of the &quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; . . . none of my musical<br/>examples on the Web currently illustrate this, but the last piece I<br/>played at the first Microthon (which appeared to illustrate this)<br/>did . . .</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2001 2:19:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; none of my musical<br/>&gt; examples on the Web currently illustrate this, but the last piece I<br/>&gt; played at the first Microthon (which appeared to illustrate this)<br/>&gt; did . . .</p><p>Oops -- the parenthetical remark should have read, &quot;(which appeared<br/>to be the most popular)&quot;.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/30/2001 4:29:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/29785">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/29785</a></p><p>&gt; Well, it&apos;s unclear from this how fully Protopopoff worked out his<br/>&gt; microtonal theories</p><p>Hi Paul...</p><p>I just e-mailed Anton Rovner to see if he could amplify the section<br/>on Protopopoff&apos;s microtonal work using the reference materials he<br/>has...</p><p>Maybe he&apos;ll write up some specifics....</p><p>JP</p></div>
