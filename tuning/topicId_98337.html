Some chord progressions are so specific to particular temperaments that you could actually, just by listening to it, tell which temperament it is -- as long as the first and the last chord of the progression is the same. That means that one particular chord progression doesn&apos;t say much about what EDOs the temperament combines but it can say, very clearly, which interval is tempered out -- and what characteristic harmonic possibilities that gives us.

Is this tetracot?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely correct. :-)</p><p>Nice. I&apos;ve never actually played with tetracot before, but I heard 3/2<br/>being divided by 4 parts, and since this whole &quot;cot&quot; thing seems to<br/>have some mysterious thing to do with 3/2, I went for it.</p><p>Do you work with comma pumps that involve higher error tunings? For<br/>example, I was trying to find a suitable 5-limit &quot;tricot&quot; temperament,<br/>so I thought maybe if you temper 75/64 really flat that&apos;d do the<br/>trick, such that three 75/64&apos;s give you a 3/2. This vanishes<br/>140625/131072 - the page for it can be found here</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=10_16&limit=5&key=3_-1_2_2_5&error=14.705">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=10_16&limit=5&key=3_-1_2_2_5&error=14.705</a></p><p>16 and 26 are some tunings that support this temperament, and 26 might<br/>be ideal for it. One comma pump that works is (try this in 26-equal)</p><p>Cmaj -&gt; Em -&gt; Bmaj -&gt; D#maj -&gt; F##m -&gt; C##maj -&gt; E##maj -&gt; G###m -&gt;<br/>D###maj -&gt; F####maj -&gt; B###maj</p><p>Where the B###maj at the end is actually Cmaj again. This progression<br/>actually ends a major second up in 12-equal, but turns out to be a<br/>unison in 16 or 26 equal. It only ends up one step off in 19-equal<br/>though. But then again, maybe the error&apos;s a bit too high for you. And<br/>maybe there&apos;s a better 5-limit &quot;tricot&quot; as well.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also come to a similar progression recently but from the opposite<br/>&gt; side -- as in &quot;C-E-G C-E-A D-F#-A D-F#-B E-G#-B E-G#-C# F#-A#-C#<br/>&gt; [C#-]E#-G#-C#&quot;. But I haven&apos;t delved into these a great deal since Herman<br/>&gt; already has a fairly obvious pump at the end of his porcupine overture.</p><p>Right. I think you can make the one you wrote above also sound a bit<br/>more forceful by throwing in some V-I&apos;s and iv-I&apos;s</p><p>C-E-G -&gt; C#-E-A -&gt; D-F#-A -&gt; D#-F#-B -&gt; E-G#-B -&gt; E#-G#-C# -&gt; F#-A#-C#<br/>-&gt; F#-A-D# -&gt; C#-G#-E#!!! (now you&apos;re back at C again in porcupine<br/>temperament)</p><p>I&apos;m trying to also explore the use of tiny pieces of &quot;functional&quot;<br/>harmony in the middle of these comma pumps, as per the above. To my<br/>ears when you do that, they start sounding really natural, and after<br/>some repetition don&apos;t sound any stranger than comma pumps in meantone.</p><p>As a last note, I&apos;m about to make a post on tuning-math that attempts<br/>to figure out exactly what this &quot;characteristic sound&quot; of each comma<br/>pump is, so maybe you&apos;ll find that interesting.

What I&apos;ve discovered is<br/>that Helmholtz did not use the term &quot;schismatische<br/>Verwechse?lung&quot;.  You can find this by searching Google for<br/>&quot;schismatische Verwechslung&quot; and reading the Google Books<br/>preview of Liberty Manik&apos;s &quot;Das arabische Tonsystem im<br/>Mittelalter&quot; (The Arabian tone system in the Middle Ages).<br/>Unfortunately I exhausted my previews before I could track<br/>down who did coin it.  In case it helps another researcher,<br/>here are the pages (according to the index) where<br/>&quot;schismatische Verwechslung&quot; is covered: 77, 88, 91-96,<br/>101, 108, 122, 127.  From what I remember, Hugo Riemann was<br/>ahead of Helmholtz, but I couldn&apos;t find the page he said<br/>that.</p><p>Ellis was pretty early with &quot;skhismic temperament&quot; in 1885.<br/> Shoh&eacute; Tanaka had &quot;schismatische Verwechselung&quot; in 1890.</p><p>&gt; 1997<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I join; Paul is talking a lot about 81:80 defining<br/>&gt; meantone and the impossibility of performing<br/>&gt; common-practice music in JI. This view of temperament as<br/>&gt; &apos;natural&apos; raises a lot of hackles in the JI crowd.</p><p>I joined the list in 1996 but didn&apos;t post until early<br/>1997.  By then I&apos;d also been in contact with Brian McLaren<br/>about my matrices and at some point he sent me copies of a<br/>load of papers, including Fokker&apos;s English one.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a clear idea of what I knew at this point and<br/>what I learned from the list.  I was much impressed by the<br/>community in general and Paul Erlich in particular.  The<br/>main influence was that it got me interested in real-time<br/>MIDI retuning and so I wrote MIDI Relay.</p><p>I have backups of my old messages somewhere, and I&apos;ll find<br/>them one day I&apos;m sure.  I wrote an exposition of the<br/>matrices, and sent it to (I think) Manuel Op De Coul (in the<br/>belief that he was Paul Erlich, because Paul wasn&apos;t using<br/>his own e-mail at the time) asking if the list would be<br/>interested in it.

Monz and Paul will later discover a similar<br/>&gt; optimization had been done for meantone by Woolhouse in<br/>&gt; 1835.</p><p>I&apos;m surprised the 22-tone paper was so late.  I had a<br/>private conversation with Paul around that time, anyway.<br/>The important thing, to me, was that I learned how to deal<br/>with cases where the octave wasn&apos;t the period.  Before<br/>that, I had matrices to describe meantone and schismatic,<br/>and I could invert to them to get between mappings (vals)<br/>and unison vectors.  That method gave a fractional matrix<br/>for the diaschisma.  I thought it meant the system was ill<br/>formed, but Paul had already dealt with it, and showed the<br/>octave was divided in two.</p><p>&gt; Kraig launches the Wilson archives, and Wilson&apos;s work on<br/>&gt; linear temperaments and MOS will soon attract wider<br/>&gt; discussion.</p><p>Some of us had dead tree copies of a few papers, and I<br/>think there was already discussion of them before the<br/>archive went up.</p><p>&gt; In an offlist thread, Monz spurs the rediscovery of<br/>&gt; Fokker&apos;s papers on periodicity blocks.</p><p>It&apos;s a shame that was offlist because I don&apos;t remember<br/>anything about it.</p><p>&gt; 2000<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Negri, Hanson, and Valentine are re/discovered by Dave,<br/>&gt; Robert Valentine, myself, and others (they won&apos;t be named<br/>&gt; for another year or two).</p><p>The thing is, I have no recollection of knowing about these<br/>things until 2001.

Are any celebrations<br/>planned?</p><p>What I did fairly quickly was to work out a set of unison<br/>vectors or commas to produce Miracle.  That also entailed<br/>recognizing generators other than a fifth or a simple<br/>division of a fifth (Mohajira) which seems obvious but had<br/>held me up until then.</p><p>Dave Keenan wrote a program (or spreadsheet) to search for<br/>linear temperaments by choosing the size of the<br/>generator.  This already threw up Orwell as a standout,<br/>but confirmed Miracle as the best if you wanted a lower<br/>error.  Then I wrote a program to search by pairing off<br/>consistent equal temperaments, which was more general<br/>because it could handle periods other than the octave.  I<br/>also wrote a program to take a set of unison vectors and<br/>find the temperament they implied (given an optimization),<br/>which meant hammering down the matrix inversion method to<br/>deal with arbitrary periods and generators.  By the end of<br/>the year I had it working solidly and dealing with torsion<br/>(which had come up in the Fokker discussion before).</p><p>Monz and I both came up with decimal notations at the same<br/>time.  They were fairly obvious as generalizations staff<br/>notation applied to Miracle. A number of us were working<br/>with Miracle. I produced something in Magic, with a keyboard<br/>mapping and notation based on Miracle because I hadn&apos;t<br/>worked out a native Magic notation then.  I decided Miracle<br/>was the future and concentrated on that.  Other<br/>temperaments were being cataloged and tuned up.  There was<br/>a huge amount of progress that year.  Gene turned up in the<br/>middle of it all.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 6:35:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not familiar with semisixths, but a search of the tuning-math<br/>&gt; archives says it tempers out 78732/78125.

Some chord progressions are so specific to<br/>&gt; particular temperaments that you could actually, just by listening to it,<br/>&gt; tell which temperament it is -- as long as the first and the last chord of<br/>&gt; the progression is the same. That means that one particular chord<br/>&gt; progression doesn&apos;t say much about what EDOs the temperament combines but<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; can say, very clearly, which interval is tempered out -- and what<br/>&gt; characteristic harmonic possibilities that gives us.

I also noticed that an interval I was using in a 5-limit JI scale was close to 7/4, and got the idea of tempering out 126/125 by using tempered major and minor thirds as generators (the rank-3 starling temperament). I don&apos;t recall the exact dates, but I believe this was around the same time that miracle and magic were being discussed on the tuning list.

Can you point me to the file?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Seventh - a bunch of 10/9&apos;s turning into 3/2? What temperament is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; this? Is this tetracot?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Absolutely correct. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice. I&apos;ve never actually played with tetracot before, but I heard 3/2<br/>&gt; being divided by 4 parts, and since this whole &quot;cot&quot; thing seems to<br/>&gt; have some mysterious thing to do with 3/2, I went for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you work with comma pumps that involve higher error tunings? For<br/>&gt; example, I was trying to find a suitable 5-limit &quot;tricot&quot; temperament,<br/>&gt; so I thought maybe if you temper 75/64 really flat that&apos;d do the<br/>&gt; trick, such that three 75/64&apos;s give you a 3/2. This vanishes<br/>&gt; 140625/131072 - the page for it can be found here<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=10_16&limit=5&key=3_-1_2_2_5&error=14.705">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=10_16&limit=5&key=3_-1_2_2_5&error=14.705</a></p><p>As Petr has pointed out, this is a 5-limit version of lemba. I&apos;m most familiar with the 7-limit version, and indeed 26 is a near optimal tuning for it.</p><p>&gt; 16 and 26 are some tunings that support this temperament, and 26 might<br/>&gt; be ideal for it. One comma pump that works is (try this in 26-equal)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cmaj -&gt;  Em -&gt;  Bmaj -&gt;  D#maj -&gt;  F##m -&gt;  C##maj -&gt;  E##maj -&gt;  G###m -&gt;<br/>&gt; D###maj -&gt;  F####maj -&gt;  B###maj<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where the B###maj at the end is actually Cmaj again. This progression<br/>&gt; actually ends a major second up in 12-equal, but turns out to be a<br/>&gt; unison in 16 or 26 equal. It only ends up one step off in 19-equal<br/>&gt; though. But then again, maybe the error&apos;s a bit too high for you. And<br/>&gt; maybe there&apos;s a better 5-limit &quot;tricot&quot; as well.</p><p>If you mean dividing 3/2 into 3 parts, there&apos;s gorgo</p><p>[&lt;1 1 1|, &lt;0 3 7|]</p><p>or you could try rodan</p><p>[&lt;1 1 -1|, &lt;0 3 17|]</p><p>But like lemba, these are better as higher-limit temperaments. I&apos;ve used 7-limit gorgo, and rodan tends to come up in higher limit temperament searches although I haven&apos;t used it for anything.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2011 10:06:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 23 April 2011 00:28, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I seem to remember seeing your page on matrices<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/matrices.htm">http://x31eq.com/matrices.htm</a><br/>&gt; pretty early on, but I searched all our offlist mail and your<br/>&gt; first use of &quot;matri&quot; was in Jan 1999. &nbsp;I also searched your<br/>&gt; list posts a bit, but I got the list in digest form at that<br/>&gt; time and they&apos;re hard to search.</p><p>The Wayback Machine has it as<br/><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/matrices.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/matrices.htm</a> back to October 1999, which<br/>isn&apos;t much help.
