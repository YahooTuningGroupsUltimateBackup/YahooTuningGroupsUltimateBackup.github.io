And I&apos;m not sure what<br/>&gt; &gt; specifically you think is a &quot;tangent,&quot; because you didn&apos;t quote the<br/>&gt; &gt; thing you&apos;re claiming is tangential to your point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are going to flag rudeness, do it consistently.</p><p>I think I&apos;m pretty consistent with that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is, &quot;why not use Blackjack or Wizard(22)?&quot; and I am answering that.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We are talking about practical music-making.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was hopefully talking about getting you to release a version of your<br/>&gt; &gt; example which &quot;completed&quot; the relevant JI chords, so we could all hear<br/>&gt; &gt; how they&apos;re not out of tune 5-limit things but are upper structures of<br/>&gt; &gt; other, more complete chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But those are complete JI chords. Maybe the timbre is throwing you off- if I do get around to extending the piece, I&apos;ll use smoother (but with plenty of partials) timbres.</p><p>What do you mean complete JI chords? They&apos;re only 3 notes, I thought,<br/>and a complete 11-limit otonal chord is 6 notes. What were the chords<br/>you&apos;re using?</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK, well I think the 5-limit in 41-EDO is pretty good. I can hear it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; not perfectly just, but to me it makes sense to call a type of<br/>&gt; &gt; slightly tempered 4:5:6, from a purely intonational standpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think taller chords in 41 are pretty darn rational sounding- not perfect, but they pretty much &quot;do that thing&quot;. Out here in real life my experience is that people recognize the similarity, assuming that I am correct in assessing some very consistent and similar associative descriptions people use as being specifically descriptive of rational intervals: ancient, old-fashioned, church/choir, sleepy, etc.</p><p>I hear that pretty well for just 4:5:6.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you sometimes hear a different function and tonal tendency, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; fine, but I hope you can admit there are times when one can substitute<br/>&gt; &gt; for the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :facepalm: I just got through explaining how I need so many pitches in 41 because I use the harmonic seventh in some places and the &quot;5-limit&quot; in others. And of course they can straight out substitute for one another across the board, in certain kinds of music that are eccentric of mainstream Western tonal music, I already said that.</p><p>It seemed like you were saying that 4:5:6:7 chords didn&apos;t have the<br/>same tonal or dominant &quot;function&quot; as dominant 7 chords, and that this<br/>was something you expected was heard naturally by everyone. If that&apos;s<br/>not what you were saying, then I take it back.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, this is why I typically like to use EDOs. But, I think 22-EDO is<br/>&gt; &gt; great in the 11-limit, because my tolerance for error is apparently<br/>&gt; &gt; much higher than yours. How do you feel about 31-EDO for the 11 or<br/>&gt; &gt; 13-limit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 31-edo for the 11th and 13th partial? I don&apos;t know, have to check that out. I don&apos;t feel any &quot;11-ness&quot; to 22-edo at all, nor particularly 3 or 5 for that matter, it&apos;s pretty overwhelmingly 7th partial sounding to me. At least, the stuff I have heard.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103475 href="#103475">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2012 6:07:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gbreed@...&quot; &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finding tempered scales with consecutive syntonic commas (81:80) is an interesting problem.
