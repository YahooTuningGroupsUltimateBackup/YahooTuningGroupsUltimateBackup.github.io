That is, if you make a perfect<br/>set in steel and then make a replica in titanium, the<br/>&apos;concert pitch&apos; of the titanium set may differ, but the<br/>intervals should be the same.  I think.  So you could<br/>prototype in a cheap metal and then shave a single bar of<br/>the final metal until you get the right pitch, and then<br/>fab the final set of bars according to that scaling and<br/>you should be OK.  Actually I think the densities of the<br/>metals (which you can look up on wikipedia) will give the<br/>scaling pretty well but there are others here who are more<br/>knowledgeable than I.</p><p>Shape is much more important.  It can change the pitch<br/>and timbre radically.  If you tell us more about what<br/>you&apos;re trying to build we can give better advice.</p><p>&gt; I expect there are formulas one can use to at least obtain<br/>&gt; a starting point, which is more than I have right now - I<br/>&gt; lack even a basis for guessing about these things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any suggestions or ideas where to start?</p><p>You&apos;re at one of the best places.  I&apos;ll chip in with the<br/>one rule of thumb I&apos;ve heard, which is that the pitch of<br/>strings and such scales linearly with length, while the<br/>pitch of bars/tubes scales quadratically.  So like, an<br/>octave is a 2:1 frequency relationship.  For a pair of<br/>strings, one will be half the length of the other whereas<br/>for or a pair of bars one will be 1/4 the length of the<br/>other.  That&apos;s what I&apos;m remembering anyway.</p><p>&gt; A website where I could find elementary-enough<br/>&gt; information for a &quot;toddler&quot;? Any ideas, pointers,<br/>&gt; suggestions, anything at all would be deeply appreciated.</p><p>The microtonalists I know of who make metallophones do<br/>a lot of trial and error.  That goes for all instruments<br/>come to think of it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
