They were dealing with 1-dimensional CAs.</p><p>My idea was this:</p><p>first, construct an Ur-scale from the harmonic-series,  like:</p><p>1/1&#x9;&#x9;<br/>1/1&#x9;&#x9;                       3/2<br/>1/1                 5/4&#x9;               3/2         7/4<br/>1/1       9/8       5/4       11/8       3/2 13/8  7/4 15/8<br/>1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 21/16 11/8 23/16 3/2 13/8  7/4 15/8</p><p>etc.----in other words &quot;collecting&quot; tones from the  harmonic-series gamut.<br/>(Thus there is no 4/3).</p><p>(I used this as an ur-scale just for the heck of it, because I hadn&apos;t<br/>experimented with JI before, and figured it was about time, but you could<br/>use anything  with a large number of tones per octave (or per any other<br/>periodicity) The idea is to have a large number of tones from which you<br/>can extract smaller, 5-8 notes or so subsets---scales that have a modal<br/>character.)</p><p>Then, you make a cellular-automata grid something like:</p><p>111011101111</p><p>Notice it has 12 positions, the number of notes in the ur-scale.  Each<br/>position corresponds to a note of the ur-scale.</p><p>Then, you make up your CA rule system and let the thing go:<br/>(those of you who don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about, see<br/><a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-aeh/lifeeng.html">http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-aeh/lifeeng.html</a><br/>Very nice explanation and great, clear Java graphics<br/>at the bottom, there&apos;s a great 1 dimensional CA.  No time at all to figure<br/>out the basics CA theory once you&apos;ve seen it.)</p><p>and you get something like:</p><p>110110110100<br/>101101101011<br/>111011101101<br/>011011110101<br/>101110011110</p><p>or whatever (I was just made that up for the purpose of this e-mail, so<br/>don&apos;t look for a pattern.  But all CA&apos;s look something like the above.)</p><p>Anyway, the point is that my idea was that,  each &quot;line&quot; of this CA<br/>represents a certain amount of &quot;time&quot; to &quot;improvise&quot; in.<br/>For that period of time, one checks the grid:  a &quot;1&quot; means that scale-tone<br/>is &quot;on&quot;  and you can play with it, a &quot;0&quot; means it&apos;s off, and you leave it<br/>alone. Or the other way around.<br/>Then, after a while, you go onto the next line, and the scale-subset of<br/>the &quot;Ur-scale&quot; changes, and you have a new set of tones to jam on.</p><p>Get it?</p><p>Hence, the above example would give the following subsets,  (&quot;0&quot; means a<br/>note is &quot;on&quot; in this case:)</p><p>improv on:<br/>19/16 23/16<br/>for while, then on:<br/>9/8    21/16  3/2 7/4 15/8<br/>for a while, then on:<br/>17/16  5/4  23/16  13/8<br/>etc.<br/>19/16  23/16  7/4</p><p>etc.</p><p>It&apos;s a simple idea admittedly, and probably one can do much more<br/>interesting things with 2 or more dimensional CAs.   But I thought it was<br/>a nice way of generating quasi-random scale combinations.</p><p>In the actual patches I was playing with, the &quot;UR-scale&quot; consisted of a<br/>24-note octave, repeated from a low C3 to a high G7, or something (that<br/>range because I was going to write a piece for bass flute, viola and<br/>violin),  and I found a rule-pattern for the CA that worked particularly<br/>nicely---give me nice, interesting subset-scales.</p><p>Unfortuantely, they were too nice----too rich, almost, and I wasn&apos;t sure<br/>how to go about composing/improvising with them.  Now that I&apos;ve been on<br/>the list awhile, I&apos;m starting to see how to think of ways to combine JI<br/>tones to make interesting harmonies/melodies.</p><p>Hope this made some small degree of sense.</p><p>CB</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p>212-663-2515<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2001 4:02:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Christopher,</p><p>&gt; Anyway, the point is that my idea was that,  each &quot;line&quot; of this CA<br/>&gt; represents a certain amount of &quot;time&quot; to &quot;improvise&quot; in.<br/>&gt; For that period of time, one checks the grid:  a &quot;1&quot; means that scale-tone<br/>&gt; is &quot;on&quot;  and you can play with it, a &quot;0&quot; means it&apos;s off, and you leave it<br/>&gt; alone.
