I mean that is what Micheal has been<br/>talking about for years now. Tall chords. Come on man you ought know this!&quot;</p><p>    Oh man...you know what...I always have and still do.  Some of the theories I<br/>have I&apos;ve dropped to an extent (such as the PHI Section, 16th harmonic based,<br/>and Silver Section scales)...but I&apos;ve always believed in tall chords and still<br/>do: every scale I&apos;ve made is designed for maximizing the number of tall chords<br/>available per tone in scale.  Often I&apos;ve done this by NOT trying for low-limit<br/>triads (which limits the number of near-just dyads) and instead focusing on<br/>either low-limit dyads OR higher limit dyads with no obvious mathematical<br/>explanation but simply, in my opinion, a good musical mood (such as 12/11, 11/6,<br/>and 22/15).</p><p>    All that mumbo-jumbo about critical band dissonance, having less than 8<br/>cents error from JI, recurrent sequences, using irregular temperaments...holding<br/>for all dyads in my entire scale are built to maximize the available number of<br/>tall chords.  No matter how mathematically &quot;baseless&quot; this may seem...I think<br/>compositions in such scales by myself, Chris, and a few others seem to prove the<br/>value of my scales&apos; focus on tall chords in keeping an audience interested and<br/>enabling towering harmonic structures.</p><p>Cameron&gt;&quot;That which can be said ABOUT music, which cannot be said IN music, is<br/>of little to no value. &quot;<br/>   Indeed!   Which makes me want to rip my hair out when I post an idea with a<br/>sound/music sample and people say it means nothing without being able to post a<br/>sound/music counter-example.  Same goes when someone asks me to believe in an<br/>equation (especially stuff having to do with virtual frequencies) and I try the<br/>equation in a sound sample, my ears don&apos;t like it and a few people who I show it<br/>to don&apos;t like it, I post that they don&apos;t like it, and I get called a liar or<br/>&quot;having a baseless opinion not proven by equations/psychoacoustics/etc.&quot;</p><p>    In summary...why not just stop this academic supremacy march (what is this,<br/>the Imperial Forces?) :-D and sit down with some sound/music samples of<br/><a href="http://theories.in">theories.in</a> action and &quot;dish things out&quot; that way?<br/>   BTW, far as the whole Cameron vs. Carl<br/>tuning-theory-meets-musical-implementation challenge...I&apos;m still eager to hear<br/>it happen! :-)<br/>.</p></div><h3><a id=93465 href="#93465">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2010 1:31:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have the utmost respect for Michael&apos;s musical quest, which is not actually &quot;tall chords&quot;, but what we could call &quot;wind-chime tunings&quot;, the name suggested by a comment Herman Miller made once.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does it involve tall chords man?
