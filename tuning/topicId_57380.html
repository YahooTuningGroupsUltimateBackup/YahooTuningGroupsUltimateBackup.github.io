Maqam Music circles here need insight as to what is microtonality and how it can broaden the scope of the music-making process. I&apos;m sure your contributions would be much appreciated, and I would be more than happy to help translate them to Turkish. (I&apos;m also part of this organization, you know...)</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: sehvar besiroglu<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 08 Mart 2005 Sal&imath; 10:37<br/>  Subject: [tuning]</p><p>  CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT</p><p>  REPRESENTATION IN MUSIC / MUSICAL REPRESENTATION</p><p>  Istanbul Technical University Turkish Music State Conservatory</p><p>  Department of Musicology</p><p>  6-7-8- OCTOBER 2005</p><p>  Representation has been among main topics in social sciences and humanities over a decade.
