A<br/>few diminished chords were also spaced this way. I suspect that a 7:5<br/>tritone would be quite successful here (as distinct from the 7:5 dim<br/>5th in barbershop 7th chords) and may have been what we got close to<br/>in our a capella rehearsals.</p><p>The 7th chord would then be</p><p>28:35:42:50(:56)</p><p>using the 28:25 &apos;septimal middle tone&apos;, 126:125 away from 10:9 and<br/>225:224 from 9:8. Very natural for &apos;common practice&apos;, and even<br/>difficult to avoid when the tenor &amp; bass have the tritone and the<br/>tenor is used to singing true thirds:</p><p>e.g. when the 7th is prepared by the dominant triad with spacing</p><p>G-B-d-g -&gt; F-B-d-g.</p><p>This dom 7th tuning would be relatively easy to implement in adaptive<br/>JI, for example, involving quite small fractional pitch shifts.</p><p>A justly tuned &apos;Tristan chord&apos; F-B-D#-G# would then have the intervals</p><p>5:7, 4:5, 3:4</p><p>which is 60:84:105:140 or 1/7:1/5:1/4:1/3, as often discussed ...</p><p>... but one has to wonder if orchestral players possibly using 19th<br/>century &apos;expressive intonation&apos; (sharps sharp, etc.) would come<br/>anywhere close to this &apos;choral&apos; degree of justness, or even a good<br/>meantone approximation, particularly since the chord is completely<br/>unprepared and involves different orchestral sections.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
