Issues to Fret Over: WAFWO-Just<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Within A Fret-Width of Just (WAFWO-Just) might be quite descriptive<br/>for the problems that Dave Keenan and others have discussed regarding<br/>the tuning accuracy of such instruments. As I recall, there were<br/>suggestions on the order of 2-3 cents for this type of<br/>&quot;near-justness.&quot;</p><p>Within A Fretting-Nuance of Just (WAFNO-Just) alludes to a factor<br/>which Mark Lindley discusses in presenting Vincenzo Galilei&apos;s rule for<br/>fretting a lute in 12-EDO: have the frets spaced by successive ratios<br/>of 18:17 (the &quot;18 rule&quot; still followed by modern luthiers). Because of<br/>fretting pressures when playing, the performer can actually come<br/>closer to 100-cent semitones with this formula than with the &quot;correct&quot;<br/>logarithmic fretting distance. Or, maybe this could also be stated:<br/>&quot;Within A Fingering Nuance of Just&quot; (also WAFNO-Just).</p><p>(Aside: How about a &quot;25 rule&quot; for fretting in successive ratios of<br/>25:24, which could also be described as a moderate &quot;stretched octave&quot;<br/>tuning?)</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>2. A Just Synthesis?: WATU-Just or WANTU-Just?<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>Shifting from fretted instruments of the traditional kind to digital<br/>synthesizers and the like, we have some more acronyms:</p><p>Within A Tuning Unit of Just (WATU-Just): This means that an interval<br/>is within the instrument&apos;s smallest unit of measure -- for example,<br/>within 1/768 octave on a 768-EDO instrument.</p><p>Within A Nearest Tuning Unit of Just (WANTU-Just): This is a bit more<br/>particular, since it requires that the interval be tuned to the<br/>_nearest_ possible equivalent, and thus within _half_ a tuning unit,<br/>for example 1/1536 octave on a 768-EDO instrument. Note that with the<br/>frequent need for &quot;nanotemperament&quot; on such instruments, in which some<br/>intervals must be tuned to the &quot;next-most-accurate&quot; unit in order to<br/>improve accuracy on others, certain intervals are likely to be<br/>WATU-Just but not WANTU-Just.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s also a kind of special ribbon of distinction in<br/>this category:</p><p>Within A MIDI Unit of Just (WAMU-Just) means that an interval is<br/>accurate within the MIDI tuning unit of 1/49152 octave.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Intrinsic Units of Near-Justness: A Theorist&apos;s Delight<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Since &quot;justness&quot; often has an acoustical reality mediated through<br/>instruments with &quot;more-or-less-fixed-pitch&quot; lending themselves to<br/>comparisons like the above, such standards can have a certain<br/>practical appeal. However, there&apos;s also much entertainment to be had<br/>by going with units of measure having some connection with interval<br/>ratios and esoteric theory, and here are some ideas:</p><p>Within A Schisma/Skhisma Of Just (WASO-Just): This may be either the<br/>3-5 Skhisma of Helmholtz/Ellis (32805:32768, ~1.95 cents), or in a<br/>rather free usage which many might suggest is quite lax, the 3-7<br/>schisma (33554432:33480783, ~3.80 cents). However, my own view might<br/>be that the 3-7 schisma is better absorbed by one fifth in a 23-fifth<br/>chain than taken as a loose standard for &quot;near-justness.&quot;</p><p>Within A Johnny Reinhard Unit of Just (WAJRU-Just): This means within<br/>1/1200 octave of just, or a step of 1200-EDO, a unit of measure going<br/>back to China in the 16th century or so according to James Murray<br/>Barbour (if I recall the source correctly), and made famous on this<br/>list by Johnny Reinhard as a notational unit for microtonal ensembles.</p><p>Within A Nanisma Of Just (WANO-Just): A nanisma is a unit which I<br/>proposed here a bit more than a year ago, but Joe Monzo gave more<br/>practical meaning in a post last year: it&apos;s the difference between the<br/>3-7 schisma at around 3.80 cents, and the &quot;Comma of Mercator&quot; by which<br/>53 pure fifths fall short of 31 pure octaves (~3.62 cents), an<br/>interval of about 0.18 cents with the following ratio:</p><p>649037107316853453566312041152512:648966242035284859600333477874109</p><p>As our Monz observed, one could use a chain of 68 pure fourths up to<br/>obtain a minor third only a nanisma wide of 7:6 -- and we could<br/>similarly use 69 fifths up for a major third only a nanisma narrow of<br/>9:7. This seems one possible theoretical standard for &quot;just about<br/>just.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, I hope that this article has brought people considering the<br/>&quot;near-just&quot; acronyms another bit of random amusement.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2002 6:26:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
