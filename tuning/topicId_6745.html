In fact,<br/>here&apos;s an interesting job I will be doing soon: from January 14/Feb 6,<br/>2000, I&apos;ll be in a production at the Cleveland Playhouse of &quot;A Dream<br/>Play,&quot; by August Strindberg. It is a fantasy about an angel who comes to<br/>Earth to live as a human, and it&apos;s pretty out there structurally. My<br/>friend Lee Stametz is doing the music, and I am bringing 34, 19,<br/>fretless, and 12 tone guitars...Lee used 19 tone guitar a few years ago<br/>in a Denver production, so I think I&apos;ll be playing non 12 music in this<br/>show....although I can&apos;t say just what&apos;s going to happen, as the music<br/>is not yet written. The Playhouse # is 216-795-7000; my # will be<br/>216-751-8621...I don&apos;t know if any of you folks live in that area, but<br/>please get in touch if you do, and we&apos;ll hang out. I can be reached<br/>there by email at <a href="mailto:b3brooks@aol.com">b3brooks@aol.com</a>...the Millennium in<br/>Cleveland...yow...(if it really IS the Millennium)...Hstick  PS...I&apos;lll<br/>be in Cland on Dec 13...</p></div>
