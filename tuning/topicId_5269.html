I can imagine a table based on scalar intervals, but it would likely<br/>be quite a trick to get it to work well, and it wouldn&apos;t work at all unless<br/>the composer was paying attention to his spellings (99% of midi files out<br/>the window).  So the table would be based on absolute intervals. [For most<br/>music post 1850, a well-working scalar table would be equivalent to an<br/>absolute table for 12 anyway.]</p><p>Start by taking all dyads, triads, tetrads, and pentads of the set [1 3 5 7<br/>9 15 17 19].  That&apos;s less than 210 things.  Now, tune them each in 12tET.<br/>12 may be consistent with respect to this set.  If not, just use MAD (mean<br/>absolute deviation) to pick the closest tuning.  Now, sort by the 12tET<br/>side, and you should have multiple just versions for each 12tET chord.  For<br/>each of these, rank just versions inversely to their (MAD from 12) times<br/>(largest number in them).  Keep only the top four ranking chords in each<br/>class.</p><p>Now, assuming that your midi file has only one timbre per channel, as all<br/>good midi files do, come up with a decay time for notes on each channel, so<br/>you can measure from note-on how long a note will be heard.  Now step thru<br/>the midi file tick by tick.  At each tick...</p><p>a) if &lt; 2 or &gt; 5 octave-equivalent notes are sounding, do nothing,<br/>b) otherwise, look up the chord in your table and tune it accordingly,<br/>c) if there&apos;s no match, ignore the softest note and goto step 1.</p><p>&quot;Tune it accordingly&quot;.

I think that was John deLaubenfels&apos; idea.</p><p>That&apos;ll likely be bad in the middle, since drift is not uniform.  I<br/>exponentially decay the drift out as the piece progresses, using about a<br/>1 second half-life.  I find that this tends to limit maximum drift to<br/>about +/- 30 cents, a non-trivial amount, but bearable in context.</p><p>More sophisticated methods could be employed, certainly.</p><p>[Bill Sethares, TD 345.16:]<br/>&gt; One possibility would be to adjust the tuning based<br/>&gt; on the partials (spectrum) of the notes being played.<br/>&gt; This would be the same as adjusting to simple integer<br/>&gt; ratios if the sounds had harmonic overtones, but would<br/>&gt; be different otherwise.</p><p>Quite right, Bill!  I am failing to state that I am assuming harmonic<br/>timbres when I speak of integer ratios.  As your book, &quot;Tuning, Timbre,<br/>Spectrum, Scale&quot;, with its accompanying CD, make so vividly clear,<br/>other timbres require other ratios!</p><p>&gt; Another idea would be to adjust the tuning so as<br/>&gt; to achieve a certain rate of beating among the<br/>&gt; partials (i.e, adjusting to beatlessnes is not the<br/>&gt; only sensible goal). This is sometimes stated as a goal of<br/>&gt; gamelan tuners in poetic terms - to make the tones &quot;shimmer&quot;.</p><p>This makes me smile, because I think of the first 40 years of my life<br/>as being locked into the &quot;shimmering&quot; of 12-tET.  For the past ten<br/>years I have tasted JI, and I believe I could stand another 30 with<br/>nothing but JI, or as close as I can come, before wanting anything<br/>else!  But of course you&apos;re speaking of controlled out-of-tuneness,<br/>which might make perfect sense.</p><p>[Dan Stearns, TD 346.7:]<br/>&gt; Carl [Lumma],<br/>&gt; Thanks for coming up with and sharing all those adaptive tuning<br/>&gt; strategies. It seems like John deLaubenfels also found them very<br/>&gt; interesting, and hopefully someone who&apos;s doing adaptive tuning will<br/>&gt; eventually be able to try them out.</p><p>While it&apos;s always possible that Carl will find someone to program his<br/>ideas, it&apos;s been my experience that if I want something like this done,<br/>I&apos;d better do it myself (I&apos;m assuming for the sake of discussion that<br/>Carl doesn&apos;t have the resources to snap his fingers and have a<br/>programmer or two under his personal hire...).</p><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 346.9:]<br/>&gt; I love listening.
