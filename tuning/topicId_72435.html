Graham Breed has a page with a script that does this. In this case, take 22-ET and 41-ET. These are both temperaments that are consistent in the 11-limit, so you can take the 22-ET version of magic (with a 7-step generator) and the 41-ET version (with a 13-step generator) and combine them. A particular tuning for magic might have a generator closer to 7 steps of 22-ET, or closer to 13 steps of 41-ET, or anywhere in between.</p><p>Try this: <a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/twoet.html">http://x31eq.com/temper/twoet.html</a><br/>type &quot;22&quot; in the &quot;first et&quot; box,<br/>&quot;41&quot; in the &quot;second et&quot; box,<br/>and &quot;11&quot; in the &quot;odd limit&quot; box.</p><p>If you look at a chart of ET&apos;s like the one on monz&apos;s Tonalsoft site (<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx</a>), and imagine this chart having two more dimensions, you can visualize 11-limit magic as the line connecting 22 and 41 on the chart. Any interval in 11-limit magic can be tuned at least as closely to just as 22-ET or 41-ET, and possibly even closer if the 22-ET and 41-ET deviations are in opposite directions. So it can be convenient to think of this as a &quot;22&amp;41 regular temperament&quot; or 22&amp;41-RT. Actually, most of the common temperaments can be identified in this way. Meantone can be 12&amp;19, 12&amp;19, 19&amp;31, etc.</p><p>There&apos;s not a unique set of commas, since the sum or difference (in pitch space) of any two commas is another comma, but there are mathematical ways to derive the commas from the mapping or vice versa. There have been discussions on tuning-math about how to do that (which involves wedge products and is rather technical).</p></div><h3><a id=72445 href="#72445">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2007 11:11:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hiya Bill,</p><p>Nobody else linked to this, so I thought I would</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/commaseq.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/commaseq.htm</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=72452 href="#72452">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Sethares &#x3C;sethares@ece.wisc.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2007 8:16:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to all who replied --</p><p>So, it is true that to go from 11-limit JI (a 5-d system) to<br/>a 2-generator representation (a 2-d system), three things are needed.<br/>Herman pointed out that these can be commas<br/>(as I was anticipating) but that they might also be ETs<br/>(thanks Graham, for the on-line software!).</p><p>For the 11-limit magic family, Gene showed how to<br/>get a set of commas that work, though<br/>the final answer {100/99, 225/224, 245/243} is a bit odd<br/>because it does not obviously contain the magic comma at all!<br/>I guess this must be a result of the nonuniqueness of the<br/>representation (i.e., there must be other trios of commas<br/>that generate the same space and some of these representations<br/>must contain the magic comma directly).</p><p>Gene then showed another tempering (the one using the Hermite comma)<br/>which does contain the magic comma, along with two others...<br/>This makes the procedures a lot clearer... and<br/>I guess the bottom line is that *any* of these are legitimate<br/>generalizations of magic to the 11-limit.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=72463 href="#72463">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2007 10:26:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 7/19/07, Bill Sethares &lt;<a href="mailto:sethares@ece.wisc.edu">sethares@ece.wisc.edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I think this may be a question for Monzo or for Gene:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was looking at the tonalsoft site about the Magic family of tunings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/m/magic.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/m/magic.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where there are versions of magic for 5-limit, 7-limit and 11-limit<br/>&gt; JI.

A plane is defined by three points, but there is an<br/>infinite number of triples of points that define the same plane, so<br/>the question &quot;What three points define this plane?&quot; has no definite<br/>answer.</p><p>As you say, one of them could be the magic comma 3125/3072, and the<br/>others could be 225/224 and 100/99. Or one could be 3125/3072 and the<br/>others could be 225/224 and 385/384. Or 3125/3072, 875/864, and<br/>100/99.</p><p>Or one of the commas doesn&apos;t even have to be the magic comma. If you<br/>take 225/224, 875/864, and 100/99, the system produced by tempering<br/>those out is exactly the same system as the one you get by tempering<br/>out any of those other triples.</p><p>What&apos;s really going on here is that each of an infinite set of related<br/>commas (called the &quot;kernel&quot;) is tempered out. In this case, the kernel<br/>has dimension three, so you need at least three commas to &quot;span&quot; it.<br/>It&apos;s possible to have three commas that don&apos;t span it (for example,<br/>100/99, 10000/9801, and 1000000/970299, because they&apos;re all powers of<br/>100/99), but it&apos;s easy to find three commas that do span the kernel. I<br/>think they&apos;re related by unimodular matrices or something.</p><p>Gene has defined a way to get a unique set (or rather sequence) or<br/>commas for a given temperament, called the Hermite comma sequence<br/>(<a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/commaseq.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/commaseq.htm</a>). It always ends up<br/>looking at least as simple as any other set of commas, and they have<br/>the added benifit that chopping of the sequence gives you a<br/>lower-prime-limit version of the system. For example, the sequence<br/>3125/3072, 225/224, 100/99 has this property (I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s *the*<br/>Hermite comma sequence, but it has the prime limit property), so the<br/>system defined by just 3125/3072 is 5-limit magic, and 3125/3072 and<br/>225/224 define a 7-limit system.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=72466 href="#72466">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2007 1:51:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Sethares&quot; &lt;sethares@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene then showed another tempering (the one using the Hermite comma)<br/>&gt; which does contain the magic comma, along with two others...<br/>&gt; This makes the procedures a lot clearer... and<br/>&gt; I guess the bottom line is that *any* of these are legitimate<br/>&gt; generalizations of magic to the 11-limit.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t call it a tempering myself. One way to think of it is as a<br/>way of notating 11-limit JI in a way where the reduction to magic is<br/>perspicuous. The magic comma, tempered out, gives the 5-limit version<br/>of magic. We can write any magic interval by means of a 5-limit<br/>interval, with magic comma equivalencies. In particular (shown by the<br/>5-part of the factorization, 5^(-1), of the magic comma) we can<br/>express it in terms of just 2 and 5. Then the next two commas of the<br/>Hermite sequence are of the form |x x x 1 0&gt; and |x x x 0 1&gt;, so you<br/>see how they are a basis for extending the notation to the 7 and then<br/>the 11-limit. This is the usual pattern with Hermite comma sequences,<br/>though sometimes the extension needs to be done another way because<br/>thr +-1 exponents are lacking.</p><p>Hence, an 11-limit interval is written 2^a 5^b c1^c c2^d c3^e, where<br/>c1, c2, c3 are the three commas of the Hermite sequence. The<br/>corresponding 2-5 interval is just 2^a 5^b, and that interval tuned<br/>to 11-limit magic simply results from your tuning of 2 and 5. Which<br/>you already knew.</p></div><h3><a id=72538 href="#72538">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2007 12:23:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill Sethares wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks to all who replied -- &gt; &gt; So, it is true that to go from 11-limit JI (a 5-d system) to<br/>&gt; a 2-generator representation (a 2-d system), three things are needed.<br/>&gt; Herman pointed out that these can be commas<br/>&gt; (as I was anticipating) but that they might also be ETs<br/>&gt; (thanks Graham, for the on-line software!).</p><p>No.  In general you only need 2 ETs to get the 2-generator representation (what we call a rank 2 temperament).
