That&apos;s an exceptionally difficult<br/>&gt;   proposition for pianos, harpsichords, harps, etc.  Even<br/>&gt;   on electronic instruments it&apos;s not trivial,</p><p>Definitely I am talking about electronic instruments.  It is possible to<br/>make a piano do this by fitting tension or string length adjusters but<br/>it would clearly be a very expensive exercise (although pehaps justifies<br/>for concert pianos).</p><p>&gt;... and electronic<br/>&gt;   instruments still don&apos;t have the naturalness and expres-<br/>&gt;   siveness of &quot;real&quot; instruments.</p><p>Gary, you are right again.  I believe that there are multiple reasons<br/>for this and they need to be addressed in order to get a result that is<br/>the perfect instrument.  The most important of these is that many<br/>electronic instruments use waveforms played at various speeds to produce<br/>notes.  Sometimes they have one sample per octave to recognise that the<br/>waveform changes with frequency.  However playing a waveform even 50%<br/>faster than recorded at still has an entirely different set of<br/>resonances.  This must be properly done to get a correct result.  I have<br/>worked out how to do this and a couple of simple parameters allow<br/>accurate reproduction of many instruments.</p><p>Another factor is that real instrument waveforms continue to develop<br/>with time and don&apos;t settle down to a static situation as many electronic<br/>instruments force on us.  Again there are ways to address this.</p><p>&gt;More modern:  The cummulative effect of each tempera-<br/>&gt;   ment&apos;s inaccuracies gives music a &quot;mood&quot; that is inte-<br/>&gt;   resting in its own right.  Some would argue that Just<br/>&gt;   Intonation, in its phase-locked perfection sounds clean<br/>&gt;   to the point of being almost boring.  I don&apos;t agree as<br/>&gt;   such, but can readily see why they&apos;d make that claim.</p><p>Of course if we played a very pure instrument (say a sine wave<br/>generator) in perfect harmony, then it would be quite boring.<br/>That is why I stated from the start that there were additional<br/>considerations regarding modulation and variation that must also be<br/>allowed for.  This partly overlaps the electronic factor.  It is<br/>actually more interesting to have a note that has various levels of<br/>variation and  modulation including tremello (Yeah I know, not too much<br/>like modern opera singers) and other slower variations.  It is important<br/>that such variations are not random however but desirable that they be<br/>co-ordinated with the harmony and rhythm of the music.</p><p>If we have a piece of music in 4/4 time with 120 bpm and in C (let us<br/>say for simplicity that C=256 Hz) then the rhythm at 120 bpm is also at<br/>2 Hz which is exactly in tune with the key.  Any periodic variations in<br/>the instruments should be in tune also, such as at 4 Hz or 8 Hz or maybe<br/>6 Hz for a little bit of spice.</p><p>If notes are to be deliberately out of tune, as you suggest, then the<br/>amount should be chosen also deliberately and not dictated randomly as<br/>in ET.  For example, having say C=256 Hz and G=386 Hz (instead of 384)<br/>gives a 2Hz beat which is in tune with and probably with the rhythm.<br/>These dynamical variations occur in real music and prevent it being<br/>sterile.  They should apply to many things, volume, tempo, pitch,<br/>ratios, etc etc and they should occur at many levels of scale from fast<br/>to medium to slow and even very slow.  The Gods and Magic speak to us in<br/>the frequencies which are below human hearing.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
