I looked out to find a CD and was pleased to<br/>find one at an Indian concert the day before yesterday. The live<br/>recording was newer than the article so I hoped to find this special<br/>dhaivat (major sixth) on it, and indeed, the CD notes even mention it.<br/>What&apos;s not mentioned is that she actually spent years practicing this<br/>tone, and it&apos;s beautiful. It makes this CD one of the nicest Indian<br/>music CD&apos;s that I have, so I&apos;d like to recommend it here.<br/>The title is<br/>Live Concert Swarutsav 2000, Khayal, Kishori Amonkar vol. 1, Music<br/>Today, 2001, CD-A 01007. It contains raga Vibhas and a bhajan.<br/>If you think this must be the 5/3 shruti, well it&apos;s even lower than<br/>that! She knows it and worked hard to make it that low.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
