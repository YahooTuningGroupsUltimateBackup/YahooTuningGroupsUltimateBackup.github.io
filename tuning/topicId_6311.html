Volker Staub, a former student of Johannes Fritsch, is also<br/>an instrument builder, uses eighth-tones as a &quot;practical&quot; notation for<br/>working with the pitch continuum.  Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, from the school of<br/>Ferneyhough, has co-authored a manual of contemporary oboe techniques with<br/>Peter Veale including a 48tet fingering chart.  Like Staub, I believe Mankopf<br/>chose eighth tones from practical grounds -- they can be referenced readily<br/>to 12tet pitches.  Also, Ernstalbrecht Stiebler recently wrote an orchestral<br/>work _Unisono Divisi_, somewhat in the Scelsian spirit, where quartertone<br/>deviations from unison are used in most registers, but eighthtones at one<br/>point in the bass.</p><p>Out-of-tuners: Rhy Chatham, who started as a professional harpsichord tuner,<br/>then discovered JI via Tony Conrad, and then La Monte Young, has written one<br/>piece _The Out of Tune Guitar_, actually an ensemble work, based upon an<br/>accidental &quot;found&quot; tuning in which he once found his guitar.  Jonathan Segel,<br/>from the Camper van Beethoven camp, composed _Three Pieces for Out of Tune<br/>Piano_, intended to be played on a 12tet instrument that has drifted out of<br/>tune.</p></div>
