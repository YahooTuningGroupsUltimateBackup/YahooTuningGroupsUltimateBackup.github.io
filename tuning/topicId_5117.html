The tunign resulting from the hole spacings are reported to<br/>&gt; approximate our diatonic scale.  It is said to be intuitive --- that the<br/>&gt; octave is based on 8 rather than 5 or 10.</p><p>They say &quot;the interval relationships of the sounds from hole 3 to hole 7<br/>fitted reasonably well to the note sequence E6, D6, C6, B5, A5, with the<br/>tone of hole 1 = A6 and hole 2 = F#6&quot;.  Table 1 gives these numbers:</p><p>holes 1-2             284 cents    minor third<br/>holes 2-3             244 cents    Slightly larger than a major second<br/>                                    (whole tone)<br/>hole-7 to tube sound  260 cents    Slightly smaller than a minor third,<br/>                                    slightly larger than a whole tone</p><p>Anyone who thinks 260 cents is only &quot;slightly larger than a whole tone&quot;<br/>isn&apos;t really to be trusted.  Looks more like 5-equal (240 cent steps) than<br/>anything else, although they do say it&apos;s a 7-note near-octave.</p><p>They also say &quot;tests revealed that the tiny hole next to hole 7 (Fig. 1)<br/>was probably drilled to correct the off-pitch tone of the original hole<br/>7; thus a tone of G#5 + 16 Hz was corrected to A5 - 11 Hz, which is much<br/>closer to the octave of A6 - 36 Hz.&quot;  As someone said before, this is a<br/>weird way of measuring pitches.  However, I reckon A5-11Hz and A6-36Hz<br/>give an octave of 1164 cents.  Same discrepancy as the others, but not so<br/>bad for such a large interval.  G#+16 to A-11 I make 45 cents.  So maybe<br/>they wanted a quartertone?</p><p>There is an MP3 file on the website, and it doesn&apos;t sound diatonic to me.<br/> But I can&apos;t be sure as it&apos;s a Chinese tune, so I&apos;d expect it to be in a<br/>Chinese scale.  Maybe someone would like to analyse it.</p><p>The URLs are horrible.  Find your way from <a href="http://www.nature.com">http://www.nature.com</a> .  Get<br/>the sound file from the Supplementary Information page.  Save it in case<br/>the online copy is doctored to sound more diatonic!</p></div>
