He continued:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...then Jerry said...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Tonal music, in general, seems universal and probably predates God (at least<br/>&gt;&gt; man&apos;s concept of him/her). At the change of the millennium, polyphony was<br/>&gt;&gt; introduced in Western music, however it was still largely vocal,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m surprised this wasn&apos;t slammed harder than it was, what a well-behaved<br/>&gt; list. Tonal music, as in major/minor, is a minority of the music in the<br/>&gt; world.</p><p>Bob, before you start &quot;slamming,&quot; you might wonder how I am using the word.<br/>(Read Margo&apos;s article.)</p><p>&gt; Even modal music based on the ratios adopted by the tonal West (3<br/>&gt; and 5 limit) seems to be ignored or side-stepped in many cultures.</p><p>Perhaps true, but irrelevant when you understand my use of the word.</p><p>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt; mentioned Arab music and its a great example where some rather<br/>&gt; spicy ratios are preferred to those which were eventually turned into<br/>&gt; tonal music. (Thirds seconds and sixths seems to come from different pockets<br/>&gt; than the ones we use altogether). The Mysterious Voices of the Balkans<br/>&gt; recordings have some too, since harmonizing in seconds is just the way<br/>&gt; they like it.  Then there are EDOs which have little to do with temperring<br/>&gt; the same ratios the West has tempered, 5 and 7 come to mind for Africa?<br/>&gt; Thailand?</p><p>Again, irrelevant.</p><p>So, relax, Bob. Your ire is understandable if the word &quot;tonal&quot; _always meant<br/>what you thought it meant. Here&apos;s a wonderful opportunity to expand your<br/>horizons. When you don&apos;t &quot;agree&quot; with someone&apos;s post, why not ask for a<br/>clarification? Wow! What a concept. Leave &quot;slamming&quot; to the WWF.</p><p>Affectionately,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
