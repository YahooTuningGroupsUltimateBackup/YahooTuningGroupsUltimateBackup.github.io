If you don&apos;t see a piece<br/>that I said I would post by one week from now, please write me at<br/><a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a><br/>and I will see what is going on. Kraig, I am working on your stuff, and I<br/>haven&apos;t forgotten, but still I have a nagging feeling that something is<br/>amiss.</p><p>John Starrett</p><p>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
