Does anyone have<br/>any info?</p><p>And here&apos;s another point:</p><p>Because Ives uses &apos;D#&apos; for the first stretched-&apos;octave&apos; in<br/>this scale in the musical example, I submit that perhaps the<br/>musical example is an earlier conception of the scale, when<br/>he had tried both the 48-tET and 9-tET versions, and that<br/>the diagram is a later version, after he thought of the idea<br/>of using a quarter-tone interval as the cyclic repetition.<br/>This would be the opposite of what is implied by the editor&apos;s<br/>placement of these two fragments in the published version.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
