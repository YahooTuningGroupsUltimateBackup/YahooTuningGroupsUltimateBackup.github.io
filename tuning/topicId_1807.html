This is unplausible<br/>physiologically, to say the least. Marc Leman (of the<br/>Institute for Perception and Electronic Music) and I began<br/>to think about alternate mechanisms, and came up with the<br/>following idea, which we have just submitted to the Journal of<br/>the Acoustical Society of America.</p><p>The basic idea is to use the same blocks that models<br/>of pitch perception and masking use - and to then modify them<br/>slightly so that they give the familiar dissonance curves.<br/>Heres the title and abstract. If you&apos;d like to see the paper, let me<br/>know.</p><p>A Time-Based Model of Sensory Dissonance</p><p>This paper describes a time-based model for the calculation of<br/>sensory dissonance that is similar to the &grave;front end&apos; of modern pitch<br/>extraction and amplitude modulation detection models. The critical<br/>band filters feed a nonlinear rectification unit; the output is bandpass<br/>filtered and the energy is accumulated over a short time interval.<br/>This gives the energy in the beating, which is a primary component<br/>of the &grave;roughness&apos; or sensory dissonance percept. The model is<br/>analyzed in a few simple cases, and a series of simulations<br/>demonstrate that it successfully reproduces standard dissonance<br/>curves. Since the model utilizes many of the building blocks of<br/>standard auditory models, sensory dissonance can be viewed as a<br/>byproduct (or co-product) of these neural elements. Amplitude<br/>variations are handled automatically (unlike standard dissonance<br/>models) and the relationship between sensory dissonance and the<br/>critical band is a natural consequence of the form of the model.</p></div><h3><a id=1986 href="#1986">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/1999 2:14:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 17 Mar 1999, William Sethares wrote:<br/>&gt; One of the things that always bothered me about sensory<br/>&gt; dissonance models was that they require a decomposition<br/>&gt; of the sound into partials (say by an FFT) and then a step<br/>&gt; where the psychoacoustic curves from Plomp and Levelt<br/>&gt; (or similar researchers) is invoked.
