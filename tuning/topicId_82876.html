There are plenty<br/>of times I prefer the sound of the naked overtone series to a<br/>pandiatonic major scale or what have you. The one I chose was mainly a<br/>matter of mood, although I will say the stretching in the first<br/>example sounded really good.</p><p>&gt; Judging by the results, it seems A) has a fairly clear advantage for tonal<br/>&gt; color. Comments ranged from &quot;Rainbow-ish&quot; -Mike B to &quot;shimmering&quot; -Herman<br/>&gt; Miller.</p><p>Nobody ever claimed that the overtone series had a monopoly on<br/>pleasant sounding music. As for the examples you posted, I like the<br/>sound of the harmonic series, but you had either detuned the series or<br/>used a timbre that was so inharmonic that I could hear a significant<br/>amount of beating. Go ahead and post the same examples without<br/>detuning the overtone series or stretching any octave or using<br/>inharmonic timbres or doing whatever you did that caused the beating<br/>and let&apos;s run the test again.</p><p>&gt; ---<br/>&gt; Meanwhile, far as which one won with respect to<br/>&gt; &quot;relaxation/emotional-consonance&quot;, it seems relatively mixed.</p><p>Chords don&apos;t have a fixed emotional content that is constant in every<br/>situation. If you play C minor and then E minor, that E minor will<br/>have a completely different emotional delivery than if you play B<br/>major and then E minor.</p><p>Note that the order in which the two examples were played likely had<br/>an impact, and the aforementioned detuning of the harmonic series (or<br/>the timbre) is what killed it for me.</p><p>&gt; It all seems to beg the question &quot;are the harmonics which occur in nature<br/>&gt; not necessarily the most natural sounding&quot;?</p><p>Intervals that aren&apos;t harmonics in nature can be perfectly natural<br/>sounding. JI harmonics can sound perfectly natural as well. Both of<br/>these are &quot;natural&quot; and can lead into other musical events<br/>&quot;naturally.&quot; Go look up some of the recent discussion about metastable<br/>ratios that maximally avoid being near small-number JI ratios on<br/>purpose for another foray into this area (or &quot;gray tones&quot; as I liked<br/>to call them, although the name never caught on).</p><p>I would imagine the statement that the first one sounded more like an<br/>instrument was true because the second one blended into the sound of a<br/>low subtone with significant beating on top, and the first one<br/>exhibited no such blending. Thus the second one didn&apos;t quite fuse into<br/>a timbre, but the first one sounded like one timbre playing a lot of<br/>different notes.</p><p>&gt; So I wonder, after reading this...does this bring up any<br/>&gt; issues/possibilities with the idea of the harmonic series&apos; not having a<br/>&gt; monopoly over relaxed/colorful music and/or open any psycho-acoustic<br/>&gt; questions/possibilities for you (not just for my scale specifically, but any<br/>&gt; scale or even timbre not based on JI)?</p><p>I don&apos;t think many people around here would say it did. But for the<br/>record, your first example sounded like a C major scale that was<br/>significantly stretched. I heard a stretched C major, an F major, and<br/>a G major being played simultaneously, along with the relationships of<br/>all of the other dyads in the scale. That -still- implies harmonic<br/>relationships between the notes - how could I hear a &quot;major&quot; sound<br/>without some concept of a &quot;major chord&quot; - which is an otonal triad<br/>itself - being in there somewhere? However, in this instance, the<br/>scale&apos;s stretch - its deviation from the overtone series - also<br/>carried a quite pleasant sound in and of itself.</p><p>The fact that I heard your first example as having a &quot;pandiatonic<br/>major&quot; quality I think still serves as evidence that some kind of<br/>psychoacoustic harmonic analysis is still taking place, and so I don&apos;t<br/>know if it&apos;s possible to turn that off entirely.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>4/14/2009 11:53:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--&quot;If the second one hadn&apos;t had that<br/>--beating, I might well have said I preferred that one.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Fair enough...but the fact is that beating is a natural occurrence in the harmonic series: I certainly did not add it in there as a way to cheat.</p><p>--&quot;Nobody ever claimed that the overtone series had a monopoly on<br/>--pleasant sounding music.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; It sure seems that way, though.&nbsp; JI, for example, is obviously based on the harmonic series (IE 4/3 (4th) and 5/3 (6th) are based on the 4/3,5/3,6/3...part of the series).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; The counter question, as always, is why are there apparently so few examples of scales (or numerology of any sorts) around not based on rational-number-fractions (which are directly related to the harmonic series)...that are also being aimed as being<br/> pleasant/relaxed sounding?&nbsp;</p><p>--&quot;Chords don&apos;t have a fixed emotional content that is constant in every<br/>--situation. If you play C minor and then E minor...(CUT)&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course...but I made absolutely sure to start both chords on exactly the middle C to avoid the &quot;different root note, different emotion&quot; issue.</p><p>--&quot;Note that the order in which the two examples were played likely had<br/>--an impact, and the aforementioned detuning of the harmonic series (or<br/>--the timbre) is what killed it for me.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Firstly, yes, maybe the order did have an effect, but that&apos;s kind of a catch 22...if I put them in the opposite order I would have the exact same problem but &quot;in the other direction&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, you said you listened to both samples multiple times...so I wonder why (if you indeed did that) the order of presentation would be an issue.</p><p>--&quot;the aforementioned detuning of the harmonic series (or<br/>--the timbre) is what killed it for<br/> me.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AS I SAID BEFORE the scale I used for the harmonic series example is 7/7, 8/7, 9/7, 10/7, 11/7, 12/7, 13/7, 14/7&nbsp; There is ABSOLUTELY NO detuning of that scale and absolutely no detuning of the instrument used to play it.&nbsp; If it sounds detuned to you...perhaps the natural periodic beating/&quot;periodic buzz&quot; is tricking you into thinking it is de-tuned.</p><p>--&quot;the second one blended into the sound of a<br/>--low subtone with significant beating on top&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with that statement...indeed the more obvious beating in the harmonic series (for better or worse) make it sound less like a timbre.</p><p>--&quot;Intervals that aren&apos;t harmonics in nature can be perfectly natural<br/>--sounding...(cut)...go look up some of the recent discussion about --metastable ratios that maximally avoid being near small-number JI --ratios on purpose&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ve read (and have responded to reading) a paper<br/> about this several times.&nbsp; The paper is below&nbsp; (a paper about meta-stable ratios)<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/NobleMediant.txt">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/NobleMediant.txt</a><br/>And, again, for the record, that paper does not interest me as it reaches for the goal of non-relaxed-sounding tones IE maximum harmonic entropy.&nbsp; If you can give me an example actually based on the idea of finding less (AND NOT MORE) dissonant/&quot;unpleasant&quot; tones based on meta-stable ratios, though, I&apos;d be happy to read it.</p><p>--&quot;But for the record, your first example sounded like a C major scale ---that was significantly stretched.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Good ear, the scale was actually the subset of my PHI scale that sounded/felt to me most like C-major in an attempt to make the mood fairly similar to that of the harmonic series.<br/>&nbsp; You can actually take C major and make a chord out of it to compare if you wish...I tried that and found the actually C-major scale played as a 7-note-per-octave<br/> &quot;chord&quot; (for<br/> better of worse) beats a LOT more.&nbsp; Whether or not that beating counts as undesired tension or desired movement you&apos;ll likely have to leave to your ears.</p><p>--&quot;However, in this instance, the scale&apos;s stretch - its deviation from the ---overtone series - also carried a quite pleasant sound in and of itself.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my theory, that &quot;fluke&quot; that it comes out sounding more and not less pleasant from being &quot;stretched&quot; is caused by the fact the beating rates are all powers of PHI relative to each other (showing the same A+B/A = A/B relationship with difference tones A and B).</p><p>--&quot;(your) first example (had) a &quot;pandiatonic<br/>--major&quot; quality...psychoacoustic harmonic analysis is still taking place, --and so I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s possible to turn that off entirely.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My theory is that, although the notes are fairly close (10 cents or less off) in many places between the PHI scale and c-major (minus the very skewed 5th)...the mind locks the &quot;warped C-major&quot; scale according to difference tones and not the usual harmonic series overtones.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, you are right, the example does not make it blatantly obvious as in it is still quite likely the brain ends up tying it to the harmonic series in the end of the day, but just as &quot;a harmonic series with somewhat more pleasant beating/difference-tone proportions&quot;.&nbsp; So I&apos;ll have to look further into this...perhaps with a 7-tone scale that is far less aligned with C-major yet displays similarly &quot;nicely beating&quot; properties.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2009 1:28:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Just because it&apos;s a common approach doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s the only<br/>one. There is plenty of music that exists in temperaments that aren&apos;t<br/>JI or 12-tet. And the reason that there aren&apos;t that many scales around<br/>like that has to do with the fact that when we tend to hear harmonic<br/>structures in such scales, so a lot of people have decided to screw<br/>around with the harmonic structures directly and then<br/>alter/stretch/temper them for different effects.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course...but I made absolutely sure to start both chords on exactly<br/>&gt; the middle C to avoid the &quot;different root note, different emotion&quot; issue.</p><p>I was talking about where the chord is placed with respect to<br/>surrounding chords.

Difference tones exist<br/>don&apos;t cause the &quot;feeling&quot; or emotional content of any chord - they<br/>actually become just another part of the chord, and you&apos;ll try to hear<br/>the harmonic relationship between not only the notes in the original<br/>chord but these new difference tones at all.</p><p>Although you can get the frequency of beating by getting the<br/>difference between two tones, this isn&apos;t the same thing as the<br/>difference or combination tone as stated above.</p><p>As to the concept of one&apos;s determining a harmonic relationship between<br/>two notes or a chord by beating instead of direct frequency analysis:<br/>what evidence there is to indicate this?

Perhaps it&apos;s inharmonic.&quot; -Mike B</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using a plain old unmodified acoustic guitar sample.&nbsp; And, if I have it right, acoustic guitar gives a much purer version of the harmonic series, with many even tones, than something like a piano.&nbsp; My sense is that, since the difference between consecutive tones in the harmonic series are equal...the beating begins to stack up on one frequency and becomes overly dramatic it too many consecutive tones in the series have high amplitude peaks.</p><p>--&quot;A difference tone will manifest itself visually in a signal as an &quot;up<br/>---and down&quot; shift of the signal (aka an actual sine wave at that<br/>---frequency) and not just a volume envelope.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, you lost me there.&nbsp; So let me get this right, a 200hz and 300hz and 400hz sine wave do NOT form a 100hz difference tone?&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always<br/> thought they did, in fact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_tone">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_tone</a> shows an example where a &quot;missing fundamental&quot; is found that way.</p><p>--&quot;a third difference tone and a fourth sum<br/>--tone, your brain will take all four of those tones and try to zap them<br/>--into some kind of harmonic series relationship.&quot; -Mike B<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand...but, at the same time, I believe the mind is also able to form different series relationships (IE a+b/a = a/b) if it sees enough overtones/partials/&quot;mental equivalent of harmonics&quot; following a consistant pattern the brain will be able to derive a root tone &quot;anyhow&quot;.&nbsp; So while the harmonic series is a good example of difference tones pointing to a root...I am pretty sure it&apos;s not the only series through which they can do so.</p><p>--&quot;Although you can get the frequency of beating by getting the<br/>--difference between two tones, this isn&apos;t the same thing as the<br/>--difference or combination<br/> tone as stated above.&quot; -Mike B.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the combination tone requires many tones following a pattern relative to each other where the difference tone&apos;s repetition between any partials causes a root to be found...my scale (and, in fact, virtually all noble-numbered scales) follow the difference tone concept.&nbsp;<br/>******************important****************************************<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the difference tone concept is by definition (&quot;anally limited&quot; to the harmonic series). it obviously wouldn&apos;t apply to such scales as mine (noble-number generated scales)...and the question would become term be that I could use &quot;legally&quot;?<br/>*********************************************************************</p><p>--&quot;As to the concept of one&apos;s determining a harmonic relationship --&quot;between<br/>--&quot;two notes or a chord by beating instead of direct frequency analysis:<br/>--&quot;what evidence there is to indicate<br/> this?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the tones 1000hz 1618hz and 2000hz.&nbsp; Notice how if you move any of the three tones much the sense of one-ness falls apart completely.&nbsp; Not to mention that the rational approximation 13/8 (1.625)&nbsp; actually makes it sound significantly worse (at least to my ears)!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True, there&apos;s no<br/> constant &quot;difference tone&quot; (IE 1618-1000=618hz is obviously != 2000-1618 = 382hz)...but the same sense of &quot;the fluctations added merely add to the chord and don&apos;t distract from it&quot; (the same sense that happens in the harmonic series) is achieved, IMVHO.</p><p>--&quot;(I don&apos;t get why) pleasant sounding chords exist outside of JI --indicates anything about psychoacoustic harmonic analysis --mechanisms.&quot; -Mike B<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; It&apos;s still somewhat up for debate upon those who, say, try the above triad example I gave (again this has only been tested on about 8 people with no clear yes/no results).&nbsp; But, one thing I noticed: you (and others) keep on using the word harmonic which denotes the harmonic series.&nbsp; And the point is not to mathematically recreate the &quot;harmonic-series difference tone&quot; construct but, rather, to create a relationship of tones that add &quot;hidden&quot; tones which combine with the feel of the original chord rather than stick out like<br/> a sore thumb.&nbsp; And<br/> the fact at least some people thought the &quot;PHI-aligned c-major&quot; example sounded less jagged and more timbre-like than the harmonic series example seems to say, at least among some people, that their minds tie these extra results tones as while with differences between tones in noble-numbered scales as they do with the &quot;constant difference toned&quot; harmonic series.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, maybe the symmetry creates on emotional effect in the brain that only seems/feels like a psycho-acoustic alignment of beating...no matter; the point is, at least to some, it seems to create an equally, if not more, desirable feeling musically.&nbsp; Either of which is good enough for me.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>-Michael</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2009 7:40:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px;

Difference tones as perceived by our hearing do not occur in the same way as they do in distorted sounds. Don&apos;t know about you, but if I hear a very loud sounding 11/8 pure sine dyad in some high octaves (like C6-F&gt;6), I can quite clearly spot relative frequencies of 3 (i.e. hf-lf), 5 (2lf-hf), and sometimes 14 (2hf-lf).

It is not. Beating has a<br/>different psychoacoustic mechanism and isn&apos;t the same thing at all. If<br/>I play 1000 Hz and 1 Hz together, you won&apos;t hear the signal fade in<br/>and out with a frequency of 1 Hz.

Try coming<br/>up with &quot;false harmonic series&quot; that are not the harmonic series and<br/>see if virtual pitch detection still works. I could see that leading<br/>to some cool &quot;neutral&quot; sounding tonalities (is that an oxymoron?),<br/>especially if the timbres match the faux-harmonic series you used. Why<br/>not run some phantom fundamental checks and see? See if a phantom<br/>fundamental even comes to exist at all besides actual combination<br/>tones from speaker distortion (i.e. do it at low volume).</p><p>&gt; And the point<br/>&gt; is not to mathematically recreate the &quot;harmonic-series difference tone&quot;<br/>&gt; construct but, rather, to create a relationship of tones that add &quot;hidden&quot;<br/>&gt; tones which combine with the feel of the original chord rather than stick<br/>&gt; out like a sore thumb.</p><p>What you have essentially done is stretch and compress the harmonic<br/>series (which is basically what happens if you try to create a bunch<br/>of difference relationships like you&apos;re doing).
