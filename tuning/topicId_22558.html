I just downloaded the most recent version of<br/>Internet Explorer 5.5 as an upgrade... no improvement.</p><p>I am sure my &quot;cookies&quot; are enabled... although in the new 5.5 I don&apos;t<br/>see where one could change that, anyway, like in the older version...<br/>it appears to be the &quot;default.&quot;</p><p>Anybody ever hear of anything like this?  I have written to the<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> &quot;help&quot; staff... but who knows when THEY will get back...</p><p>Thanks if anybody has any tips.
