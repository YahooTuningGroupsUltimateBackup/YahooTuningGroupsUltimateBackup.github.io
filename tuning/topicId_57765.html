(A<br/>wiki is a web of (mostly-text) webpages that may be edited by anyone at any time. A web<br/>search will reveal much more about it than you will ever want to know!)</p><p>I think that having one is a good idea, for many reasons. Dredging through archives of<br/>Yahoo groups is an inefficient way of finding any sort of specific information. Doubtless<br/>we can make things easier for first-timers, everyone really, if we can free our collective<br/>knowledge (and opinions) from the mandatory chronologically-based system here.</p><p>Certainly there are many websites by members here and elsewhere full of good<br/>information. I already feel that I have enough of my own spin on things that I could have<br/>one as well. But I&apos;d much rather have a place where everyone could contribute, a place that<br/>would not depend on one person having enough time to maintain it.</p><p>A wiki could in time accomodate several things that would be good for the<br/>community. The ones I think of include:</p><p>Â•&quot;microtonal solutions&quot; as I like to say; not only examples of hardware-software setups as<br/>Jon Szanto has repeatedly suggested but also acoustic solutions, experiencial<br/>instrument-making info, a list with the location of every known rare microtonal<br/>instrument, and perhaps a way for composers to write for such instruments (providing the<br/>curators of them want this)</p><p>Â•lists of downloadable microtonal sounds and CD&apos;s, and perhaps discussion and criticism.</p><p>Â•a catalogue of scales that people like, or have composed in, or have created. and<br/>discussion, sound examples of them.</p><p>Â•one thing a wiki is great for, an FAQ. Everyone posts questions, answers.</p><p>But ultimately the content of a wiki depends on what everyone wants there. I guess there&apos;s<br/>no need for a grand master plan before starting something so insanely open-ended.</p><p>So where to start? We could either get run an open-source WikiEngine on<br/>somebody&apos;s server, or start one on an existing &quot;WikiFarm,&quot; or just leech onto an existing<br/>wiki. For the latter option, take a look at <a href="http://www.composerplanet.com">www.composerplanet.com</a> - to me its vision of<br/>helping everybody make music is a more general version of what I am suggesting. But<br/>perhaps we are a big enough community and this is a big enough subject that it needs its<br/>own place.</p><p>Talk to me.</p><p>--Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=57766 href="#57766">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2005 2:37:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Jacob,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been pondering the idea of a microtonal wiki,<br/>&gt; which Andrew first suggested to me.
