It was very disappointing not to have had a few<br/>celebratory responses. Paul&apos;s work on this is *cutting edge* important, I<br/>think.</p><p>In order to reconnect (and to save interested readers the time to find it),<br/>I&apos;ll paste my &quot;moment of truth&quot; post from last week:</p><p>---------------<br/>HOLY B&apos;GEEEESUS!!!!!!</p><p>Paul, as you likely remember, I initially agreed with Joe that the third<br/>sounded &quot;high&quot; on jerry0, and then later changed my mind and thought it to<br/>be JI (I guess because it sounded so &quot;good&quot;).</p><p>So, when I first played it in this new format, I sang a JI third into the<br/>open fifth. When the recorded third came in, I fell off my chair!!!! It was<br/>*way* higher than 4:5. So, then I sang &quot;my&quot; high third into the open fifth<br/>and when the recorded third came in we had a tonal love affair!</p><p>The third in jerry0 might still be a smidge low, but then that may be due to<br/>the adrenaline pumping through the sheer excitement of finding a synthesized<br/>major chord with human ears. WOW!</p><p>I&apos;ll go back and spend some time with the others and offer my &quot;evaluations.&quot;<br/>It&apos;ll really be easy with the new format. Thanks for your efforts. I can&apos;t<br/>wait to find out what you did to prepare these examples.</p><p>I think I&apos;ll go pour me a stiff one. Cheers!!!!!!!</p><p>Jerry<br/>------------------</p><p>Since then, I have spent some time with Paul&apos;s examples to see whether I<br/>hear the same things two days in a row. I now do, so here are my<br/>impressions:</p><p>jerry0 - This is *very* good. Since &quot;acoustic&quot; tuning is a matter of seeking<br/>the &quot;best&quot; adjustment, I&apos;d like to hear the third just a smidge higher and<br/>see whether it improves. Believe me, I&apos;d settle for whatever this is if sung<br/>by my group. Just curious to see whether improvement is possible here.</p><p>jerry1 - Quite sharp.</p><p>jerry2 - a little sharp.</p><p>jerry3 - also sharp.</p><p>jerry4 - very close, but on the flat side.</p><p>jerry5 - also close, but flat.</p><p>jerry6 - sharp.</p><p>jerry7 - slightly sharp.</p><p>In working with these examples, I experienced what I believe my students<br/>encounter when seeking &quot;best&quot; intervals in simple JI; namely, that it&apos;s not<br/>difficult to recognize a well-tuned example, but it&apos;s sometimes difficult to<br/>decide whether an out-of-tune example is a bit sharp or flat. That&apos;s why I<br/>hesitated to respond to the first jerries. I sometimes simply couldn&apos;t tell.</p><p>The new format made that considerably easier. Once establishing vocally the<br/>&quot;in tune&quot; third above the open fifth, I could hear (feel) the beating of an<br/>out-of-tune third when it entered. More importantly, it gave me a chance to<br/>see if it rang higher or lower when I stopped singing. (Paul&apos;s choice of key<br/>was a bit unfortunate, since it put the third into a wobbly part of my<br/>falsetto range; but with a little practice, I got it to hold fairly steady.)</p><p>At first, I changed my mind a few times (perhaps due to my wobbly falsetto),<br/>but now I&apos;m pretty sure that I&apos;m hearing them accurately. I&apos;d love to know<br/>what others have experienced in this regard.</p><p>Well, Paul. Where are we? Did you discover the &quot;high third&quot; by chance or by<br/>numbers? The world awaits!!!

So I&apos;m finished with the &quot;Jerries&quot;. I deliberately avoided<br/>looking at more than I had to in order to find the files. I didn&apos;t<br/>read anything that gives away what I was going to hear. I did happen<br/>to read some things on the way that others think they heard that have<br/>nothing to do with what I heard.</p><p>I am, I suppose from past interaction on the list, of the apparently<br/>controversial opinion that substantial tuning experience, including<br/>simply playing a violin or singing with the objective of achieving<br/>just harmonies, &quot;objectifies&quot; the tuner&apos;s ear so that it is less<br/>subject to &quot;aural illusions&quot;.</p><p>My personal subjective perceptions are as follows:</p><p>The timbres for all tones in all cases seem identical, namely a<br/>complex timbre closely resembling a saw-tooth or siren-like timbre.<br/>It seems to me a timbre with 100% harmonicity.</p><p>The pitches for the root and fifth of the triad which sound first<br/>remain constant for all &quot;Jerries&quot;. This initial open perfect fifth is<br/>justly tuned in every case. Also in every case, the third pitch<br/>introduced above it after sounding the root and fifth for a short<br/>while is a tenth above the root, so the three tones are mutually<br/>disposed in the same way they would be in the natural harmonic<br/>series, generating an open-voiced major triad. In every case, 00-07,<br/>the open fifth drops out toward the end and the tenth is left alone.</p><p>Jerry 00:<br/> This is absolutely just, beatless tuning. There is an apparent<br/>slight drop in pitch when the root and fifth drop out, but when the<br/>attention is focused on the tenth, it becomes clear there is no real<br/>drop in pitch. This is the aural equivalent of an optical illusion,<br/>with which any experienced tuner who has worked with complex timbres,<br/>especially synthesizer timbres, should be familiar. Singing an octave<br/>below the tenth to fill in the missing third, then tuning<br/>deliberately and precisely to the tenth confirms that the drop is<br/>only apparent and not objectively present in terms of either a<br/>frequency or timbre change to reinforce the illusion of pitch change.</p><p>Jerries 01 - 07:<br/>The only change from Jerry 00 is that the tenth is somewhat sharp in<br/>all subsequent &quot;Jerries&quot;. It appears initially to be rather bitterly<br/>sharp, but this first impression is a result of the complexity of the<br/>highly harmonic timbre and the purity of the fundamentals generating<br/>the timbre, so the beating, although only 3-4 times per second, is<br/>quite marked. The beat rate indicates to an experienced tuner that<br/>these tenths are less sharp than in standard 12t-ET tuning.</p><p>I would guess that the errors are very close to 10 cents as opposed<br/>to 13.7 cents for ET. They are clearly sharp in every case, 01-07,<br/>and the beat rate and subjective pitch deviation are not detectably<br/>different to my ear. I would guess that none are above 10 cents sharp<br/>by more than a hair, and would guess on the low side for error in<br/>judgment. Let&apos;s say they are all between 8 and 11 cents sharp. My<br/>pitch memory from one example to another is not good enough to detect<br/>a three cent variation from example to example.</p><p>The apparent pitch drop is not real in any of the cases. The sharp<br/>tenths remain sharp and to my ear, do not vary noticeably, either<br/>from the pitch as it sounded simultaneously with the open fifth,<br/>nor from one example to another (01-07).</p><p>So that&apos;s it, Paul. I await your feedback after we all finish playing<br/>with this.</p><p>Thanks! That was fun.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>P.S. In my desire to avoid prejudicing my perceptions, I never saw<br/>what the two questions you wanted answered were. I hope my<br/>descriptions were exhaustive enough to have answered them anyway.

The question here is: does this &quot;aural illusion&quot; constitute the<br/>experiential data that &quot;teaches&quot; singers and string players to &quot;prefer&quot; a<br/>high third? Your impression that the third apparently drops slightly when<br/>the root and third drop out indicates that we likely hear the same thing in<br/>this regard. The difference between the &quot;illusionary&quot; high third and the<br/>&quot;real&quot; JI one is what we are seeking.</p><p>&gt; Singing an octave<br/>&gt; below the tenth to fill in the missing third, then tuning<br/>&gt; deliberately and precisely to the tenth confirms that the drop is<br/>&gt; only apparent and not objectively present in terms of either a<br/>&gt; frequency or timbre change to reinforce the illusion of pitch change.</p><p>I verified this same characteristic by singing first a JI third into the<br/>open fifth and then singing a &quot;high third&quot; (based on my decades of having<br/>dealt with it) into the open fifth. In the first case, my vocal third was<br/>perfectly in tune with the sounding JI third.

It is, rather, just a plain third in the middle of the open<br/>fifth. This explains why it sounded so bitterly sharp to me<br/>considering the slow beat rate.</p><p>Bob earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; I would guess that the errors are very close to 10 cents as<br/>opposed<br/>&gt; &gt; to 13.7 cents for ET. They are clearly sharp in every case, 01-07,<br/>&gt; &gt; and the beat rate and subjective pitch deviation are not<br/>detectably<br/>&gt; &gt; different to my ear. I would guess that none are above 10 cents<br/>sharp<br/>&gt; &gt; by more than a hair, and would guess on the low side for error in<br/>&gt; &gt; judgment. Let&apos;s say they are all between 8 and 11 cents sharp. My<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch memory from one example to another is not good enough to<br/>detect<br/>&gt; &gt; a three cent variation from example to example.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bob now:<br/>That beat rate for a pitch an octave lower than I thought I heard<br/>would correspond to exactly double the deviation in cents I had<br/>estimated. I thought it was likely less than 10 cents, but this would<br/>put it at just under 20, say 17 or 18 cents or so.

This was<br/>my first post here in awhile. I just mean what I&apos;ve already implied<br/>in my above responses to your replies. In Jerry00 I do not hear<br/>any &quot;high third&quot; while the chord is sounding. When it stops and<br/>leaves the third alone, I do detect a subjective tendency to hear the<br/>pitch as having dropped somewhat, but I am not fooled by that, having<br/>had many years experience dealing with it. When I put my &quot;objective<br/>hat&quot; on and listen intently, I do not hear any pitch shift on Jerry00.</p><p>On all the others, the third actually *IS* high, and I assume this is<br/>not what you mean by the (illusory?) &quot;high third&quot; you seem to be<br/>referring to here. It is a real high third in every case; higher than<br/>I thought. I don&apos;t hear any significant variation either in terms of<br/>pitch deviation or beat rate in any of the examples after Jerry00.</p><p>If finding which one of them after Jerry00 is the &quot;best&quot; tuning is<br/>the objective here, I must admit I do not understand that at all. I<br/>think they all sound lousy and out of tune. I do notice roughly the<br/>same subjective tendency to hear them as dropping in pitch as in<br/>Jerry00 when the other members of the chord drop out, but again, I&apos;m<br/>not fooled by that.</p><p>I believe they all stay constant in pitch throughout the example,<br/>although the amount of the drop seems to vary somewhat for me from<br/>example to example. However, when I go back to listen again, the<br/>variations I thought I heard are not reliably replicated, so I&apos;m not<br/>sure there is any consistent pattern to my subjective impressions in<br/>this regard. I suspect that the variations are subjective also, and<br/>in any case, they are slight whether &quot;real&quot; or &quot;imagined&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what else to say. There is nothing interesting to hear<br/>for me after Jerry01. To me, they all sound essentially the same<br/>(i.e., badly sharp by roughly the same degree if not exactly). This<br/>will probably help a lot of people understand better where I&apos;ve been<br/>coming from on some of my previous posts going way back to August of<br/>last year when I first logged in here.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 12:33:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 3/18/02 6:10 PM, &quot;tuning@y...&quot; &lt;tuning@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Jerry 00:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is absolutely just, beatless tuning.

In the first case, my vocal third was<br/>&gt;&gt; perfectly in tune with the sounding JI third.

I sang a just third<br/>&gt; into Jerry00 and noticed that the pitch did not vary. My vibratoless<br/>&gt; voice was rock steady and the unison was beatless after the chord<br/>&gt; dropped out on Jerry00.

I didn&apos;t hear any.<br/>Presumably, (since you didn&apos;t mention it) you didn&apos;t either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s difficult for me to understand how anyone could think they were<br/>&gt; in tune with the third in any of the examples after Jerry00 and<br/>&gt; simultaneously hear themselves as in tune with the chord. This is not<br/>&gt; possible for my ear. The thirds are all high after Jerry00; even<br/>&gt; higher than I thought, so how could anyone perceive that they are in<br/>&gt; tune with those high thirds and in tune with the chord at the same<br/>&gt; time? My choir does *NOT* sing &quot;high thirds&quot;. They spontaneously go<br/>&gt; for the just thirds on sustained chords, and when they have practiced<br/>&gt; sufficiently, on all of them, especially in renaissance music.</p><p>Last year, during the time I was discussing this topic on the list, I ran<br/>into a list member at the American Choral Directors Association convention.<br/>Having observed the exchange on list, he offered that he &quot;prefers&quot; the JI<br/>third and urges his choir to sing it. We agreed to make somewhat of a<br/>&quot;sport&quot; of listening for high and JI thirds performed by the dozens of<br/>choirs we would hear over the next few days.</p><p>I asked him to predict which third would win the talley; and he thought the<br/>high third would. (So, evidently he was confident that he could tell the<br/>difference.) We agreed later that he was right. We both said we heard many<br/>more high thirds than JI ones.</p><p>A few months later, I listened to a recording of his choir and noted a<br/>plentiful scattering of high thirds. I thought at the time that perhaps some<br/>of those simply &quot;got past&quot; him.</p><p>Now, after hearing Paul&apos;s jerry00 as a &quot;high&quot; third, I suspect that we may<br/>have been hearing JI thirds and perceiving them as &quot;high&quot; thirds, just as I<br/>did here. Perhaps we both had been fooled by the &quot;illusion&quot; of a high third<br/>while hearing a JI one.</p><p>I could probably leave it there and go one with my life, except that I and<br/>many other singers consciously and intentionally sing thirds higher than ET.<br/>To my ear, there is a &quot;right&quot; place to tune such a third. Upon singing &quot;my&quot;<br/>high third into the JI jerry, I found I could tune it to sound &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>(but not beatless). Of course, when the root and fifth dropped out it<br/>sounded very dissonant to the sustaining JI third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I don&apos;t have any experience with the &quot;high&quot; third and fail to<br/>&gt; perceive what this refers to in the Jerry00. Jerry00 sounds perfectly<br/>&gt; fine to my ear with the deep, rich, satisfying fullness and<br/>&gt; perfection I expect in a justly tuned triad.

If so, you may not<br/>want to go on record as &quot;not hearing&quot; the high third. Otherwise, why would<br/>you experience the naked third as different as opposed to when it was<br/>wrapped in a perfect fifth?</p><p>&gt; I have become used to this phenomenon melodically and have learned to<br/>&gt; hear the pitch I need so that when the &quot;other players or singers&quot;<br/>&gt; (the root and fifth) come back in, I will be in tune with them (on a<br/>&gt; just third).</p><p>Makes sense to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob earlier:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Jerries 01 - 07:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; The only change from Jerry 00 is that the tenth is somewhat sharp in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; all subsequent &quot;Jerries&quot;.

When it stops and<br/>&gt; leaves the third alone, I do detect a subjective tendency to hear the<br/>&gt; pitch as having dropped somewhat, but I am not fooled by that, having<br/>&gt; had many years experience dealing with it. When I put my &quot;objective<br/>&gt; hat&quot; on and listen intently, I do not hear any pitch shift on Jerry00.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;ll have to find an &quot;objective hat&quot; that will rescue me from the<br/>illusion. But then I&apos;ll still have to deal with all those singers who just<br/>belt out &quot;real&quot; high thirds. Hey, wait a minute! I&apos;m retired! I don&apos;t have<br/>to deal with anyone if I don&apos;t choose to. I&apos;ll just smile knowingly and go<br/>on with my golf game.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On all the others, the third actually *IS* high, and I assume this is<br/>&gt; not what you mean by the (illusory?) &quot;high third&quot; you seem to be<br/>&gt; referring to here. It is a real high third in every case; higher than<br/>&gt; I thought. I don&apos;t hear any significant variation either in terms of<br/>&gt; pitch deviation or beat rate in any of the examples after Jerry00.</p><p>Nor did I. In fact I wondered if there really were any differences, so I<br/>dumped everything into my audio program and found that they were in fact<br/>different, but not more than a cent. That&apos;s when I realized that Paul was<br/>baiting me by asking me to estimate the differences in cents. What a guy!<br/>He&apos;ll get me yet. You just watch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If finding which one of them after Jerry00 is the &quot;best&quot; tuning is<br/>&gt; the objective here, I must admit I do not understand that at all. I<br/>&gt; think they all sound lousy and out of tune. I do notice roughly the<br/>&gt; same subjective tendency to hear them as dropping in pitch as in<br/>&gt; Jerry00 when the other members of the chord drop out, but again, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not fooled by that.</p><p>Aha! That&apos;s what I wondered about. I don&apos;t hear that. (Does that make us<br/>even??  ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe they all stay constant in pitch throughout the example,<br/>&gt; although the amount of the drop seems to vary somewhat for me from<br/>&gt; example to example. However, when I go back to listen again, the<br/>&gt; variations I thought I heard are not reliably replicated, so I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure there is any consistent pattern to my subjective impressions in<br/>&gt; this regard. I suspect that the variations are subjective also, and<br/>&gt; in any case, they are slight whether &quot;real&quot; or &quot;imagined&quot;.</p><p>Second Aha! We&apos;re not so different after all. Now if you will just go back<br/>to jerry00 and &quot;imagine&quot; you&apos;re hearing a pitch drop, I&apos;ll be a happy<br/>camper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what else to say. There is nothing interesting to hear<br/>&gt; for me after Jerry01. To me, they all sound essentially the same<br/>&gt; (i.e., badly sharp by roughly the same degree if not exactly).</p><p>Well, thanks, Bob, for this &quot;inordinate&quot; amount of time. I hope it wasn&apos;t<br/>*all* a waste for you. Perhaps you&apos;ll at least be more tolerant in the<br/>future of guys like me who &quot;insist&quot; they&apos;re hearing high thirds. Also<br/>consider that maybe we all hear high thirds but don&apos;t know it. (Thought<br/>you&apos;d like that one.)</p><p>I&apos;m looking forward to the next batch of jerries that will be even closer<br/>together than the one you so patiently examined. Perhaps we&apos;ll find the one<br/>that is not &quot;badly sharp.&quot; Stay in touch.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2002 12:59:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is this comment in reference to the format of jerry00?

Many of my beginning ear-training students have<br/>considerable difficulty knowing whether the pitches they are singing are<br/>slightly higher or slightly lower than a JI fifth. But when they move the<br/>pitch *slightly* up and/or down, they have no trouble hearing when they are<br/>exactly in tune. Then, with a little practice, they can go immediately to<br/>the &quot;right&quot; tuning.</p><p>That would seem to me to be the correct approach here. While I am having<br/>some difficulty hearing whether some of the jerries 01-07 are slightly high<br/>or low, I have no difficulty singing the &quot;right&quot; high third pitch with<br/>jerry00. (I trust you are reading my responses to Bob.) I can&apos;t move the<br/>jerry thirds in micro-cents with my present software, therefore I can&apos;t<br/>experiment that way. In order to know whether there is a specific pitch that<br/>will &quot;match&quot; the JI illusionary (presumably &quot;my&quot; high third), you&apos;ll have to<br/>produce one the *nails* it. This sharp/flat process is too hard to hear.</p><p>Since you have the ability to nudge the jerry thirds, it would be helpful to<br/>me to explore the most likely vicinity for the one that matches (sounds &quot;in<br/>tune&quot; with) both &quot;my&quot; high third and the jerry00&apos;s illusionary third. So<br/>far, the area surrounding jerry07 seems to be the place to &quot;shop.&quot;</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2002 1:03:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 3/20/02 8:02 PM, &quot;tuning@y...&quot; &lt;tuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: New jerries<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i was planning to make them further apart. why should they be<br/>closer<br/>&gt; &gt; together? you failed to find any preference for jerry01, even<br/>though<br/>&gt; &gt; it was *between* the two you found the most preference for. do you<br/>&gt; &gt; really think anything is to be gained by going *even closer*?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My suggest would be to explore the &quot;space&quot; immediately higher and<br/>lower than<br/>&gt; jerry07.
