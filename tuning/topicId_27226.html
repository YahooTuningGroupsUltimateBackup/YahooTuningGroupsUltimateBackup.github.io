Can you name this &quot;microtemperament&quot;?<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>Some people might argue that my keyboard layout and first crude<br/>attempts at sound design are merely a numerical palindrome on Fokker&apos;s<br/>famous organ recently mentioned here.</p><p>As a preface to my curious definition, I would emphasize that my<br/>references to Dave Keenan and David Beardsley may mainly show how<br/>ideas posted here might sometimes set things in motion that the<br/>authors may not necessarily have intended &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>However, given that 12-tET might be considered a &quot;microtempered JI&quot;<br/>system for world musics based on stable consonances of 3:2 and 4:3,<br/>maybe there&apos;s a certain xenharmonic exuberance about including some<br/>other tunings using irrational numbers also.</p><p>Here&apos;s my definition to celebrate my first close encounters with a<br/>very exciting scale:</p><p>          A tuning may be described as &quot;microtempered JI&quot;<br/>          if all stable concords are within one cent of an<br/>          integer ratio meeting at least one of these tests:</p><p>          (1) The ratio, a:b, is such that a*b&lt;=104; or</p><p>          (2) The ratio</p><p>              (a) is one repeatedly mentioned by David<br/>                  Beardsley (or an octave complement or<br/>                  extension of such an interval); and</p><p>              (b) serves as a stable concord on the given<br/>                  instrument in a given musical context,<br/>                  especially a context based on styles<br/>                  originally developed in a setting of<br/>                  harmonic timbres and JI ratios under<br/>                  definition (1).</p><p>To introduce the scale suggesting to me this curious definition, I<br/>might term it &quot;Blackwood&quot; both after a famous composer who has used<br/>it, and following the example of names such as &quot;Blackjack&quot; and<br/>&quot;Canasta&quot; on this list.</p><p>In view of the recent thread about Bartolomeo Ramos de Pareja, I would<br/>like to observe that &quot;Blackwood&quot; can be generated by using an interval<br/>almost identical to a ratio appearing on his famous monochrord (1482):<br/>135:128 (~92.18 cents). To obtain an equal division of the octave, we<br/>very slightly stretch this same generator to ~92.31 cents, or more<br/>precisely 92-4/13 cents, as Monz has noted.</p><p>However, we can also generate the scale using another interval, a<br/>&quot;microtempered&quot; stable concord in my stylistic context serving as the<br/>equivalent for a 3:2, and within one cent of an integer ratio often<br/>mentioned by David Beardsley: 49:32 (~737.65 cents). The &quot;Blackwood&quot;<br/>generator at ~738.46 cents, or 738-6/13 cents, is only ~0.81 cents<br/>wider than this ratio.</p><p>The tempered version of the Bohlen-Pierce scale, with its 3:1<br/>&quot;tritave&quot; divided into 13 equal parts, suggests another method for<br/>deriving &quot;Blackwood.&quot; Starting with an equal division of 49:16 based<br/>on the next Fibonacci number, 21, we get an interval at step 13 of<br/>~1199.50 cents, and can then very slightly stretch the tuning to<br/>obtain a pure 2:1 octave.</p><p>--------------------<br/>2. Playing in 13-tET<br/>--------------------</p><p>Enough for some possibly quite bizarre &quot;microtemperament&quot; theory -- my<br/>main idea, after all, is to celebrate the tuning, known in more<br/>familiar terms as 13-tET or 13-EDO.</p><p>Over the last couple of days, I&apos;ve been designing some custom timbres<br/>on the Yahama TX-802 synthesizer to emulate the remarkable effect of<br/>one of the built-in timbres: a stable quality for the interval of 8/13<br/>octave, or around 738 cents, more or less musically equivalent to that<br/>of a fifth around 3:2.</p><p>As  described in a recent discussion of &quot;meantone well-temperament,&quot;<br/>this preset &quot;Piccolo&quot; timbre (voice A27) made the &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; of<br/>1/4-comma meantone at ~737.64 cents -- almost precisely 49:32 --<br/>interchangeable to my ears with a usual fifth in this temperament at<br/>~696.58 cents.</p><p>Since I knew that the 13-tET fifth at ~738 cents is almost identical,<br/>my next logical step was to tune it up. Here people like Bill<br/>Sethares, Dan Stearns, Jeff Scott, and Jacky Ligon played a catalytic<br/>role both by advocacy and by example.</p><p>At first, I was content to thrill that the &quot;Piccolo&quot; timbre made it<br/>possible for me to play neo-Gothic progressions in 13-tET using a<br/>738-cent fifth --  not so surprising, given my meantone experience.<br/>Here I should explain for people unfamiliar with the term that<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; means inspired by the Gothic music of Europe around the<br/>13th-14th centuries, where fifths are the prime concords.</p><p>Then, inspired by the Bill Sethares CD _Xentonality_, I was moved to<br/>take the next step of trying to customize my own 13-tET timbres.</p><p>One of my favorite TX-802 voices is &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; (A56), and for<br/>something like 17-tET or even 20-tET in a neo-Gothic style it&apos;s fine<br/>&quot;right out of the box.&quot; For 13-tET, however, I could hear that I<br/>needed to do some &quot;Sethareanizing&quot; or maximizing of tuning/timbre<br/>consonance.</p><p>As a rank beginner, I can&apos;t claim to understand the sophisticated<br/>consonance/dissonace models of Sethares, much less to share his<br/>practiced musical judgment and art in the crafting of beautiful new<br/>timbres. This is indeed a new art of orchestration, which people like<br/>Bill Sethares and Mary Beth Ackerley are making one of the most<br/>engaging features of early 21st-century music.</p><p>However, I did know that part of the idea, also presented by earlier<br/>writers such as Ivor Darreg and Wendy Carlos, was to adjust the<br/>partials of a timbre to match the intervals of the tuning.</p><p>Thus for my 13-tET &quot;Puff Pipes,&quot; I would try using FM operators to<br/>define a timbre with partials to fit the 738-cent fifth -- slightly<br/>wider than the usual harmonic ratios of 3:1, 6:1, etc. The TX-802<br/>offered ratios such as 3.06, 6.12, and 12.24 -- in octave-reduced<br/>terms, around 736.24 cents, neatly approximating the tuning.</p><p>Using &quot;algorithm 31,&quot; the FM equivalent of a drawbar organ, to set up<br/>some partials of this kind, I found that some other qualities of the<br/>timbre changed: while the original &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; reminds me of a<br/>Renaissance chamber organ[1], this sounded maybe more like a larger<br/>pipe organ with a deeper and less brilliant sound.</p><p>With these adjustments, which I further fine-tuned today, I found that<br/>the fifths could sound amazingly stable and &quot;solid.&quot; It was delightful<br/>to play 13th-14th century progressions and find them recognizable, and<br/>beautiful -- sometimes with striking &quot;paradoxes&quot; and variations.</p><p>&quot;Paradoxes&quot; engagingly arise from a perspective of historical Western<br/>European styles of composition, because 13-tET isn&apos;t a regular<br/>diatonic tuning, and has different patterns than something like<br/>Pythagorean tuning or 29-tET for the way that intervals &quot;add up.&quot;</p><p>For example, if we use traditional Pythagorean or similar categories,<br/>two 13-tET &quot;fifths&quot; of 8/13 octave or 738 cents add up not to a major<br/>ninth but to an interval we might call a &quot;minor tenth&quot; at 1477 cents.<br/>Similarly, the difference between an 8-step &quot;fifth&quot; and a 5-step<br/>&quot;fourth&quot; isn&apos;t a &quot;major second&quot; (2 steps), but a 277-cent &quot;minor<br/>third&quot; (3 steps).</p><p>A bit of experience with this, and some wise counsel from a more<br/>expert musician, have led me to conclude that the best approach is to<br/>&quot;let 13-tET be 13-tET,&quot; describing the interval categories in terms of<br/>scale steps rather than nomenclatures that may often tend mainly to<br/>induce conceptual vertigo.</p><p>Having seen what can happen when authors attempt to explain<br/>13th-century European vertical style in terms of the presence or<br/>absence of 18th-century traits, I&apos;ll try to present 13-tET in its own<br/>terms, or at least make my best effort as a beginner in this<br/>direction.</p><p>Of course, this doesn&apos;t rule out the use of familiar terms where they<br/>fit the structure of the tuning: for example, &quot;semitone&quot; and &quot;tone&quot;<br/>for the 1-step and 2-step intervals. I also like &quot;sesquitone&quot; for the<br/>3-step interval (&quot;one-and-a-half-tones&quot;), which appears along with the<br/>semitone and tone as basic intervals of my versions of the medieval<br/>diatonic modes in 13-tET.</p><p>For example, my diatonic Lydian has the sequitone as the first<br/>interval:</p><p>                   3      2     2   1    2     2   1<br/>              0        3     5     7  8    10    12  13<br/>              0       277   462   646 738  923  1107 1200<br/>                  277    185   185  92  185   185  92</p><p>By the way, there are a few incongruities of rounding -- using Monzian<br/>fractions (e.g. 276-12/13 cents for the sesquitone) would avoid them.</p><p>There&apos;s not necessarily any harm in explaining, for example, how the<br/>role of a 13-tET interval in a given neo-Gothic progression parallels<br/>that of a usual Pythagorean interval -- as long as it&apos;s understood<br/>that we are talking in useful metaphors.</p><p>Above all, as someone often rather historical in approach, I would<br/>emphasize that 13-tET is a tuning with its own structure and patterns,<br/>which might evoke many stylistic &quot;allusions&quot; without being limited to<br/>them, just as Haresh Bakshi has written a fascinating comparison<br/>between the raga system of India and Western European modes.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll just share two neat experiences. The first is a really<br/>beautiful pentatonic scale that I play above a vertical 8-step<br/>interval (0-8) as the drone:</p><p>                      3     2     3      2     3<br/>                  0      3     5      8    10      13</p><p>In a timbre where the 8-step interval (738 cents) has a concordant,<br/>&quot;3:2-like&quot; quality, this sounds to me much like a pentatonic with what<br/>Dan Stearns or Paul Erlich would term &quot;2L + 3s&quot; -- here it&apos;s the<br/>charming converse pattern of &quot;3L + 2s&quot; (3 large, 2 small intervals).</p><p>Tossing in a semitone now and then at 7-8 or 12-13, I had a diatonic<br/>Lydian mode -- and I love both patterns.</p><p>It was like a journey through some beloved Chinese and other Asian<br/>musics, and also the 13th-century melodies of the _minnesingers_ or<br/>courtly &quot;love singers&quot; of Germany, often with a pentatonic feeling,<br/>favorite music of my college years, also reminding me of Joseph<br/>Yasser&apos;s theory of a &quot;pentatonic&quot; element in Gregorian chant and<br/>&quot;Medieval Quartal Harmony.&quot;</p><p>Was this a journey at all like the odysseys of Dan Stearns through<br/>landscapes of nature and of scalar patterns, whose stories and<br/>metaphors in turn remind me of my own musical meditations on long<br/>walks?</p><p>A curious theme of my pentatonic journey was the role of intervals<br/>having the feeling of my beloved 3:2 and 4:3. Would other people hear<br/>it this way? -- only they can answer that question.</p><p>I&apos;ll also give one very striking neo-Gothic progression in 13-tET,<br/>raising the basic problem of how I should notate it.</p><p>In 13-tET, a usual neo-Gothic trine, the basic three-voice concord --<br/>in JI terms 2:3:4 or a rounded 0-702-1200 cents, is 0-8-13 steps or<br/>0-738-1200 cents. A very rich and spacious version of this sonority<br/>adds a 21-step interval or quasi-3:1, 0-8-13-21 or 0-738-1200-1938<br/>cents.</p><p>If I number the notes of this stable sonority as 0-8-13-21, then the<br/>cadence would look like this, with signed numbers showing the<br/>ascending (positive) or descending (negative) motion in steps of each<br/>voice:</p><p>              20 -- +1 -- 21<br/>              12 -- +1 -- 13<br/>              10 -- -2 -- 8<br/>               2 -- -2 -- 0</p><p>The first sonority, on steps 2-10-12-20, has a vertical structure of<br/>0-738-923-1661 cents (or intervals above the lowest voice of 0-8-10-18<br/>steps). This expands majestically, and compellingly, to the stable<br/>0-8-13-21.</p><p>I look forward to writing more about the theory, but for now I&apos;ll say<br/>that it sounds gorgeous, quite sufficent a reason in itself for a<br/>well-timbred 13-tET.[2]</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. A philosophical conclusion: musical ambiguities and metaphors<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>An issue discussed by Paul Erlich, Joseph Pehrson, and others<br/>is the question as to whether timbres maximizing the sensory<br/>consonance of an interval such as 8/13 octave may tend to &quot;blur&quot; pitch<br/>definition by comparison to usual harmonic timbres.</p><p>One reply might be that the concept of &quot;blurring&quot; can come up in many<br/>creative periods of musical transition when familiar stylistic<br/>patterns or sonorous expectations are challenged or &quot;distorted.&quot; An<br/>impartial, or at least relatively impartial, assessment, might focus<br/>on the real musical values of the older patterns as well as the newer<br/>ones often applauded in textbook histories of 18th-century or<br/>20th-century European and related traditions as simple &quot;musical<br/>progress.&quot;</p><p>Of course, the new and innovative can and should be celebrated, but<br/>with an awareness of the validity of the older styles and paradigms<br/>also.  A recognization of this point may lend perspective to the<br/>question of harmonic vs. inharmonic timbres.</p><p>For example, the style of Dunstable and Dufay in the early 15th<br/>century has been applauded since Tinctoris (1477) as the &quot;font and<br/>origin&quot; of a new era of music, known as the Renaissance.</p><p>However, the medievalist Richard Crocker has credibly argued that from<br/>another viewpoint, Dunstable can be seen as blurring or obscuring the<br/>clear organizational patterns of 14th-century music.</p><p>Similarly, the innovations of Monteverdi around 1600 were decried by<br/>at least one theorist as demonstrating &quot;the imperfections of modern<br/>music&quot; and unwisely attempting to defy the &quot;natural&quot; categories of<br/>consonance and dissonance. Yet his music did not invalidate the<br/>artistic power of those categories, only their universality as the<br/>_only_ way to compose pleasingly (as 14th-century music, also, does<br/>not follow standard 16th-century patterns).</p><p>Around 1900, the innovations of Debussy could be seen as &quot;blurring&quot;<br/>both tonality (sometimes suggesting a freer &quot;neo-modality,&quot; for<br/>example) and traditional consonance/dissonance distinctions.<br/>Yet I see this neither as a &quot;flaw&quot; of Debussy&apos;s music, nor as a<br/>barrier for people such as Paul Erlich who wish to explore the<br/>possibilities of tonality in new systems such as the decatonic.</p><p>In &quot;Sethareanizing&quot; or &quot;Carlosizing&quot; or &quot;Darregizing&quot; 13-tET, I<br/>sometimes need to remind myself that my purpose is not to come up with<br/>a timbre/tuning combination indistinguishable from Pythagorean<br/>intonation, but to seek a new kind of consonance with patterns often<br/>radically different than historical tunings.</p><p>Just as visual Impressionism involves some deliberate blurring of<br/>details -- and thus is an alternative to rather than a substitute for<br/>other modes of expression in various world traditions -- so<br/>tuning/timbre &quot;pastelization&quot; or Impressionism is only one stylstic<br/>choice.</p><p>Possibly the &quot;probabilistic&quot; qualities of the technique are one of its<br/>special attractions -- to have an 8-step interval in 13-tET, for<br/>example, sound often like a convincing &quot;3:2,&quot; sometimes like a kind of<br/>minor sixth, and sometimes somewhere in-between.</p><p>Around four centuries ago, in the early 17th century, the use of novel<br/>dissonances in place of expected consonances was described and<br/>sometimes defended against critics as a kind of &quot;poetic metaphor&quot; in<br/>the rhetoric of music, and the art of tuning/timbre may also be one<br/>where intonational metaphors of sensory consonance can suggest<br/>familiar patterns or open the way to new musical languages, possibly<br/>both at once.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. The &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; might suggest to me either a &quot;portative organ&quot;<br/>played by a single person operating the bellows with one hand and<br/>negotiating the keyboard with the other, which as its name suggests<br/>can be carried around; or a larger &quot;positive&quot; organ. The latter<br/>category might include Nicola Vicentino&apos;s _arciorgano_ or &quot;superorgan&quot;<br/>built of wood and apparently featuring the same basic tunings of 36<br/>notes per octave as his _archicembalo_ or superharpsichord.</p><p>2. Incidentally, the stable 0-8-13-21 sonority of this progression<br/>features a set of nonunisonal intervals with sizes of (5, 8, 13, 21)<br/>steps, a portion of the Fibonacci series. Fibonacci or Golden Section<br/>lovers might also note that a 9-step interval at ~830.77 cents, or a<br/>Monzian 830-10/13 cents, is very close to 21:13 at ~830.25 cents, and<br/>not far from Phi itself at ~833.09 cents. In 1981, John Chowning used<br/>a scale based on Phi^1/9, very close to 13-tET, for his composition<br/>_Stria_; see Brian McLaren, &quot;A Brief History of Microtonality in the<br/>Twentieth Century,&quot; _Xenharmonikon_ 17:57-110 (Spring 1998), at p. 86.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2001 2:11:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wonderful post, Margo -- thanks!

I also recall Krenek being quoted on how, if Gesualdo&apos;s musical<br/>vision had prevailed, the development of European style might have<br/>been very different.</p><p>What intrigues me about 13-tET is that much of it seems to fit in with<br/>some trends in 14th-century European style which might have led in<br/>some interesting directions -- for example, the bold use of minor<br/>sevenths and major sixths in various directed progressions which one<br/>finds in Machaut and certain English styles, as well as in earlier<br/>13th=century practice.</p><p>Here it seems to me that the tuning/timbre interaction, making an<br/>interval of 8/13 octave have a &quot;concordant&quot; effect like that of a<br/>usual 3:2, is a kind of bridge to this curious neo-Gothic musical<br/>world where much is familiar and much radically new.</p><p>There might be many questions raised about consonance/dissonance and<br/>what I might term &quot;stylistic categorical perception&quot; -- how intervals<br/>or sonorities are &quot;recognized&quot; as fitting certain categories or<br/>playing certain role in a given musical language.</p><p>For example, I find that the 5-step interval of about 462 cents in<br/>13-tET can represent, or play the role of, either a stable 4:3-like<br/>interval or an unstable and directed cadential interval analogous to a<br/>9:7, or possibly to a 13:10. The later interval acts like a Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic &quot;major third&quot; insofar as it expands by stepwise contrary<br/>motion to the 3:2-like or 8-step interval of around 738 cents. It is<br/>most engaging for a single interval to play two such roles, depending<br/>on the context, and likely on the other intervals of a sonority.</p><p>In the next week or so I hope to post more on this, but for now, I<br/>would like to express my fascination with your &quot;The Musical<br/>Animal&apos;s Acoustic Adventures&quot; article in _Xenharmonikon_ 17<br/>(Spring 1998), pp. 41-56.</p><p>Your remarks on a tuning such as Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-cent equal<br/>temperament -- and this tuning&apos;s 792-cent interval almost identical to<br/>a usual Pythagorean minor sixth at 128:81 -- maybe suggest some<br/>interesting approaches to something like 13-tET also.</p><p>Again, thank you for your generous reply, and your many contributions<br/>to just and tempered systems of intonation, with the Bohlen-Pierce<br/>scale having versions representing both types of systems.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>HPBOHLEN@AOL.COM</h3><span>8/29/2001 8:44:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Margo, and thank you for your reply and especially for your<br/>kind words about the &quot;Musical Animal&quot;.<br/>Some people got that paper entirely wrong and were obviously upset by the<br/>thought that the BP scale and the poor animal could be brain children of the<br/>same father. And yet, what they didn&apos;t understand is that the animal&apos;s<br/>adventures deal exactly with the roots of BP, which is my basic musical<br/>belief that all consonance and dissonance is a gestalt phenomenon. Timbre,<br/>beats, difference tones and harmonics, they all can emphasize or veil the<br/>gestalt of a sound, but the gestalt is finally beyond them because it is she<br/>whom we recognize, memorize and rediscover.<br/>I think that this will create much of your fascination with 13-tET: that<br/>there are new gestalten (or gestalts?) to discover, some of them<br/>tantalizingly close to old acquaintances and still having their own distinct<br/>features.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Heinz</p></div>
