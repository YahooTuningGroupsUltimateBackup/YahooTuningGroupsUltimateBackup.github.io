I am not yet sure as to how precise this machine will work, but compared to alternatives where electrical currents eventually cause metal fatigue (<a href="http://www.qrsmusic.com/Press/pr02032501.htm">http://www.qrsmusic.com/Press/pr02032501.htm</a>), the Ultratonal Piano (tm) should operate safely with a precision of PLUS 200.000 equal steps per octave on any upright or console piano contained in room temperature with a non-fluctuating pressure.</p><p>The calculations for the operable limit will most likely be lenghty, but I feel that each tone can be optimally re-tuned up and down half an octave.</p><p>This means, an A4 string tuned to 440Hz with a force equal to about 1000 Newtons can be tightened by as much as half this force more, or vice versa. I&apos;m not sure if the strings will hold, but friction will be reduced to near-zero at the bridges with special machine oil and tiny rail-wheels around which the strings wound.</p><p>Of course, compensation and regulation of all other tones are required when the metal cast frame is subjected to enormous forces each time the tension is changed.</p><p>Magnetic coils can be utilized to measure the frequency of metallic vibrations with exactitude as described in the link above. I don&apos;t know of any other feasible method of ascertaining the change in frequency.</p><p>Now that I think of it, the harmonics of each tone should also be made available to the tuning-philes. Thus, the control-console should have an LCD touch-screen for graphical displays.</p><p>I believe any scale out of the entire SCALA archive can be mapped with the touch of a button to your ordinary house piano keyboard. In fact, you will be able to, with the swoop of your thumbs or forearms, manually &grave;de-tune&grave; your piano practically any way you want.</p><p>It is only a matter of building the computer that controls the forces in play. Obviously, this computer must have MIDI integration with other tuning programs.</p><p>Since the control interface will be electronic (I decided that mechanical just won&apos;t cut it), Adaptive JI algorithms can be implemented later on. This requires a dynamic system obviously, where real-time auto-tuning will kick in depending on the keys pressed and modulation. Later versions of this machine must include such options.</p><p>Just to be on the safe side, I will put your suggestion on our agenda, so that an electronic sensor system may be installed beneath the keys as an option.</p><p>Thanks very much for your contribution!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 16 May&imath;s 2005 Pazartesi 7:57<br/>  Subject: [tuning] RE: Calculating the tension of a string</p><p>  Oops!  :-)</p><p>  But 396 000 is still twice the 200 000 divisions of the octave<br/>  that you indicated.</p><p>  Imagine the fun that such an instrument may bring us!  I do hope<br/>  that it will make it easy to achieve any desired (fixed) tuning,<br/>  simply and quickly.  Does it have presets?  Where can I find out<br/>  more about the Ultratonal Piano?</p><p>  It occurred to me while writing the above that a piano capable of<br/>  Adaptive JI would be great ...</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p></div>
