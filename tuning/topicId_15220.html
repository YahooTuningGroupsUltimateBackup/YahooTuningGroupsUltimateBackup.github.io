It looks<br/>great, and even before I get a microtunable synth it&apos;ll help massively.<br/>I sing intervals for ear training anyway, so having a reliable source of<br/>JI intervals and non-ET ratios (other than guitar strings) is great.</p><p>    So then - TX81Z it is. Or suitable equivalent. Whatever I find<br/>first. Would you believe that after months reading this list I haven&apos;t<br/>really got past reading books and listening to Uncle Harry (and a few<br/>other non-ET notable and tuning punks). So now its time to get my hands<br/>dirty, and get rational.</p><p>    Of course, I still have to make it work with USB. If it comes to it,<br/>though, I can be all grown up and work out how to program a sysex dump<br/>through Logic myself.</p><p>    Thanks again</p><p>Adam</p></div>
