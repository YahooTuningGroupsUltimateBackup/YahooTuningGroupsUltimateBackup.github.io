It has been reserved ahead<br/>of time to be a liferaft to accept members from the<br/>practicalmicrotonality group should that group detonate in<br/>a nuclear explosion of controversy and hard feelings. The<br/>two groups have the same charter otherwise.</p><p>See <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/practicalmicrotonality">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/practicalmicrotonality</a><br/>for the charter.</p><p>Don&apos;t join this group, join the other group. This group is<br/>merely on standby to rescue survivors if needed.&quot;</p><p>-------</p><p>Anyway, those of you who liked practicalmicrotonality (as<br/>I did) and want to continue working within the constraints<br/>of its charter, feel free to continue it over there.</p><p>Good luck,</p><p>Jeff</p></div>
