If I remember correctly, Peter E&#xFFFD;tv&#xFFFD;s has done an arrangement<br/>of Studie II (for string orchestra?).</p><p>I have never found it a coincidence that Stockhausen made _Stimmung_ after<br/>paying a visit to La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela&apos;s loft.  I think that<br/>the Stockhausen has dated very badly. The bad erotic poetry (composers<br/>really shouldn&apos;t write lyrics!) and proto-new age &apos;magic names&apos; just come<br/>across as silly, while the rhythmic and timbral tranformation techniques<br/>now seem both pedantic and lack potential for surprise. Young&apos;s aesthetic,<br/>on the other hand, avoids giving the superstructure the kind of<br/>explicitness that has dated _Stimmung_ so badly, and uses a rule-base to<br/>control the improvised realization of the work that is really more honest<br/>than the hidden compositional controls exerted by Stockhausen.</p><p>I included _Sternklang_ on my list instead of the closely-related<br/>_Stimmung_ because it is materially more interesting (the diamond tonality<br/>and the techniques used by the instruments to control the formants) but<br/>more importantly because it takes the common ideas to extremes not present<br/>in the earlier piece.</p><p>You are right that _Stimmung_ is related to the whole new-agish &apos;overtone<br/>singing&apos; enterprise here in Germany (which has really slowed down since<br/>actual Tuvan and Mongolian singers started appearing live in Germany<br/>shopping districts, playing for spare change), much as David Hyke&apos;s choir<br/>was related to Young&apos;s ensemble work.  It is an interesting social-cultural<br/>and economic phenomenon and  many of the performers are very accomplished<br/>at what they do but I find it hard to imagine that there is really<br/>sufficient content in these musics to drive a music-theoretical discussion<br/>of any depth or weight.</p></div>
