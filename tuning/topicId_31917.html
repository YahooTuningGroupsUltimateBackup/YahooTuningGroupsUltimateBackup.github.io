We could eventually talk about the tetrachordality<br/>which, from the gammier theory perspective, is almost an obligation in pentatonic.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/indextg.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/indextg.htm</a> I wrote in French, in august 2000, vis-&agrave;-vis penta-9<br/>  It seems there exist only four great natural pentatonic genus.The eight first pentatonic gammiers<br/>  belong to these four genus. The next pentatonic gammier, in the canonical order of gammiers,<br/>  implies a new genus, using the harmonic 23. That&apos;s the gammier number 237. I don&apos;t know if<br/>  there exist modes approaching. If a musician tried to explore that gammier, I would be curious<br/>  to know his impressions.<br/>I had forgotten that when I wrote my precedent message asking to Margo an advice about<br/>the style pelog or japanese of her pentatonic scale. Reading anew this message, I was<br/>struck to read the last sentence:<br/>  It seems that the approximative Harrison 1 6 3 1 6 - (in 17-tET) is nearest from<br/>  Japanese than from Pelog. Or, would have to correct my styles?<br/>The 1 6 3 1 6 is justly the good caracterization of penta-9 as I used it in<br/>  <a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/gammes-gsp.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/gammes-gsp.htm</a></p><p>Verifying that, it was yet more astonishing: the distance between the gammier<br/>   &lt;3 7 9 27&gt;<br/>which gives the scales of Harrison and Margo, and penta-9 is the half-syntonic<br/>comma 162/161. The scale corresponding to the Harrison&apos;s one<br/>  1 24/23 4/3 3/2 36/23 2<br/>belongs to the gammier &lt;1 3 9 23&gt; while &lt;3 9 23 27&gt; gives yet this scale and also<br/>the scale corresponding to the Margo&apos;s one<br/>  1 27/23 4/3 3/2 36/23 2<br/>what is easily shown by<br/>  (161/162) 24/23 = 28/27<br/>  (161/162) 27/23 = 7/6<br/>  (161/162) 36/23 = 14/9.<br/>More generally the operator<br/>  T : 7 --&gt; 81/23<br/>transforms one gammier to another<br/>  T &lt;3 7 9 27&gt;<br/>  = &lt;3 81/23 9 27&gt;<br/>  = &lt;1 27/23 3 9&gt;<br/>  = &lt;27/27 27/23 27/9 27/3&gt;</p><p>  = &lt;3 9 23 27&gt;<br/>The gammier &lt;3 7 9 27&gt; is simpler than &lt;3 9 23 27&gt; but it&apos;s clear it has the<br/>style of the penta-9 &lt;1 3 9 23&gt;.<br/>  <a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/gam/tg237-penta9.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/gam/tg237-penta9.gif</a><br/>This simple remark is not a proposition to define or name a category. It&apos;s just to<br/>signal a proximity resulting from duality in the gammier generation.</p><p>I wrote &quot;I would be curious to know his impressions&quot; for I don&apos;t have any idea about the<br/>perceptive possiblity of the harmonic 23. Without a good color difference between<br/>the 17-tET tuning (slightly favorizing harmonic 23) and the 36-tET tuning of these<br/>scales, maybe we could have serious doubt on that possibility.</p><p>Happy holidays!</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
