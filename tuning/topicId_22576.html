I don&apos;t seem to have that message.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;What do you have already composed for acoustic instruments,<br/>&gt; Graham?&gt;&gt;</p><p>A movement for string quartet&apos;s the main thing, written at the same time<br/>as fuckfeedback.  About 3 minutes.  I&apos;m sure I could improve on it given<br/>the time and inclination, but I think it is worth listening to as it<br/>stands.  I&apos;ve never got it to work right in MIDI.  It also changed its<br/>character through my upgrading the synthesizer as I was writing it.</p><p>A few other things that aren&apos;t that good and/or never got finished.  I<br/>tend not to finish most of what I start, partly because I lose attention,<br/>partly because I learn so much by the time I&apos;m half-way through that I can<br/>do better by starting over.</p><p>Ah, it&apos;s all coming back now ...</p><p>The first serious thing I wrote was a setting of a Walcott poem for voice<br/>and microtonal piano.  It&apos;s intended for 7-prime limit tuning, but as I<br/>didn&apos;t have any microtonal synths back then, I had no idea what it would<br/>sound like.  And I never have gone back to it, perhaps I could dig it out<br/>tomorrow.  I wrote the music for one verse.  It&apos;s not supposed to repeat<br/>exactly, but I never got round to writing the whole thing out.</p><p>I currently have a piece in a similar state.  It&apos;s a re-scoring of a Stina<br/>Nordenstam song.  I heard it once on the radio, but the EP it&apos;s on got<br/>deleted before I caught up with it.  So the only way I can hear it is<br/>write it myself using the words I got from the web.  I decided it should<br/>really be in a neutral third scale.  There&apos;s a piano accompaniment I half<br/>have worked out.  Every time I try and get it MIDI-ed in, I end up<br/>changing the harmony in line with my greater experience, and then<br/>adjusting the melody to match and ... you know ...</p><p>&gt; I know this isn&apos;t addressed to me, but I took this as a veiled call<br/>&gt; for microtonal acoustic instrument scores... is that the case?</p><p>I don&apos;t know, looks more like an invitation to open the door to my dingy<br/>compositional past.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div>
