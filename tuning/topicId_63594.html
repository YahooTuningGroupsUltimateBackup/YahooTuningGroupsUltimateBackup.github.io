What do you<br/>&gt; call it?  How does it work?</p><p>These are steps of 46 equal to between one interval of Sa-grama<br/>tempered in 46 and another, if we assume the particular scale I called<br/>Shrutar[46] is being used to define sruits. In other words, in 46-et<br/>9/8 is represented by 8, and the scale steps from 0 to 8 inclusive are<br/>0-2-4-6-8; the differences between them being 2, 2, 2 and 2. Hence,<br/>(2222).</p><p>&gt; #2:  What exactly do you mean by the word Shrutar?<br/>&gt; Years ago Jacques Dudon built a guitar-like Just<br/>&gt; Intonation instrument that he named the Shrutar, but I<br/>&gt; doubt if that&apos;s what you&apos;re referring to here.</p><p>I&apos;m not the one who came up with the name, so Paul Erlich could<br/>explain that aspect better. By &quot;shrutar&quot; I mean the &quot;rank two&quot;<br/>temperament which has a period of half an octave, and a generator<br/>a flattened 11/8 interval. In terms of 46, that is 23/46 of an octave<br/>for the period, and 21/46 for the generator, so you can also take the<br/>generator to be an approximate quarter-tone of size 2/46. This is, of<br/>course, close to 1/22, and 22-tone scales can be constructed in this<br/>way which are fairly close to, but not actually, 22 equal tones to the<br/>octave. One way to do this would be two equal chains of 11 notes with<br/>2/46 quartertone steps, one starting from 0 cents and one starting<br/>from 600 cents; Paul was suggesting another scale would be better for<br/>concocting something sruti-like.</p><p>In terms of commas being tempered out, shrutar can be characterized as<br/>the 11-limit temperament tempering out 121/120, 176/175 and 245/243.</p></div>
