Found someone on the net who knows him<br/>&gt;and got an e-mail for someone who should be able to tell me how<br/>&gt;to get in touch with him.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s great, here&apos;s wishing you good luck!</p><p>&gt;If you&apos;re looking to buy any of his CDs, you can find them<br/>&gt;on the web. Just do a search for him. Almost everything that<br/>&gt;turns up is in Turkish (which I don&apos;t understand), though,<br/>&gt;so maybe you can e-mail and ask for info.<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m going to try that, i know on AltaVista you can get some sites put into<br/>english so that would work OK for now.</p><p>&gt;I found a listing (with a real audio sample, which I haven&apos;t heard)<br/>&gt;for &quot;Erkan Ogur - Eskiya&quot; at<br/>&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.turknet.com/music/cdguide/index.html">http://www.turknet.com/music/cdguide/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I tried to listen to it and it said my player was wrong...i know it&apos;s not,<br/>so it must be their site.</p><p>&gt;And there&apos;s a page for this here (all Turkish)<br/>&gt;<a href="http://sinema.tr-net.net.tr/movies/eskiya/cast/erkan_ogur.htm">http://sinema.tr-net.net.tr/movies/eskiya/cast/erkan_ogur.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>I saw the page and was amazed by the fretless STEINBERGER in the page. It is<br/>amazing. Wish i had one...or two.</p><p>Hopefully perhaps we can get some info from the man himself. It would be<br/>good to know what he&apos;s been up too since being in GP in 92.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Jeff Collins</p><p>A Strange View of Music<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Stadium/1429/STRANGETONES.html">http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Stadium/1429/STRANGETONES.html</a></p></div>
