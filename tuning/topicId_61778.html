Have you heard of Nayi Uthman Dede and Dmitri Kantemir?</p><p>&#x9;but the framework of intervallic structure mainly in structural intervals of modes, modal movement ,..... are specific.</p><p>What do you make of my claim that these three brothers born under the same roof are all tonal genres? And that Dastgahs/Maqams are keys rather than modes?</p><p>&#x9;You know,scales and tetrachord may be the same but the mixture of tetrachord and the way you think musically due to the rules of modes different.may be we two play in mokhalif but our taste of segah due to tuning of instrument , phrasing , ......different.</p><p>Misinterpretation, or outright denial of facts contained in historic treatises must be the cause of certain grotesque mistunings in my opinion. On the other hand, I concur that different tastes have evolved in Persia, Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries throughout the past millenium.</p><p>&#x9;I have a book in farsi by the late maestro morteza han&apos;naneh , a greate theorician and composer, working on the root of dastgah , he proposed that shur is the same as yegah , and rast is another root of persian music.according to old documents from maraghi and ..... melodic and rhythmic music of iran were bwsed on maqam concept.</p><p>It is interesting how there occured this reactionary movement both in Turkey and Iran against the original Maqam so much so that we almost entirely reverted back to the tetrachordal system of Ancient Greek and Arab theoreticians.</p><p>&#x9;like the other parts of islamic culture  but unfortunately we don&apos;t know the time of change to dastgah and loosing the rhythmic maqams.but as I mentioned before and you told we can trace the footprint of maqams from names from common structures and intonations.</p><p>The living relic, so to speak. It is a wonder how it survived all that mutilation in the hands of nationalists.</p><p>&#x9;We cant give exact scale-formula for each things in iranian music and also middle east and may be all musics based on personal approach, because of intervallic spectrum . I&apos;m working on this item to see what are the maximum and minimum limits of an interval to save the  taste of mode , indeed in degrees of good and bad . I don&apos;t mean that scales are bad or good but modal taste for example can be qualified .</p><p>Have you examined my 79 MOS 159-tET? I do believe that you can express all the tastes of Persian Art Music with this system.</p><p>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;These sacles are near to theory of dr.barkeshli who told for example quarter-tones in persiam music are just minor intervals + sy.

However, modes are edvar (pl. of devir, or cycle as in octave species from a gamut), Maqams are not Edvar, hence modality is a lacking term for the last 300 years of musical development in the Orient in my opinion.</p><p>Here is 79 MOS 159-tET again with Maqam Music diatonical perde names:</p><p>Notation is SCALA E79<br/>|<br/>  0:          1/1                   C             RAST      (Do=261 Hz, Sipurde Ahenk/double frequencies for Ney)<br/>  1:         15.092 cents   C/<br/>  2:         30.185 cents   C//<br/>  3:         45.277 cents   C^    Db(<br/>  4:         60.369 cents   C)    Dbv<br/>  5:         75.461 cents   C#\   Db\\<br/>  6:         90.554 cents   C#    Db\<br/>  7:        105.646 cents   C#/   Db<br/>  8:        120.738 cents   C#//  Db/<br/>  9:        135.830 cents   C#^   D(<br/> 10:        150.923 cents   C#)   Dv<br/> 11:        166.015 cents   D\\<br/> 12:        181.107 cents   D\<br/> 13:        196.200 cents   D            DUGAH<br/> 14:        211.292 cents   D/           dugah again<br/> 15:        226.384 cents   D//<br/> 16:        241.476 cents   D^    Eb(<br/> 17:        256.569 cents   D)    Ebv<br/> 18:        271.661 cents   D#\   Eb\\<br/> 19:        286.753 cents   D#    Eb\<br/> 20:        301.845 cents   D#/   Eb<br/> 21:        316.938 cents   D#//  Eb/<br/> 22:        332.030 cents   D#^   E(<br/> 23:        347.122 cents   D#)   Ev<br/> 24:        362.215 cents   E\\<br/> 25:        377.307 cents   E\              segah/ussaq down from here<br/> 26:        392.399 cents   E               SEGAH<br/> 27:        407.491 cents   E/    Fb      buselik<br/> 28:        422.584 cents   E//   Fb/     nishabur?<br/> 29:        437.676 cents   E^    F(<br/> 30:        452.768 cents   E)    Fv<br/> 31:        467.860 cents   E#\   F\\<br/> 32:        482.953 cents   E#    F\<br/> 33:        498.045 cents   F                CHARGAH<br/> 34:        513.137 cents   F/<br/> 35:        528.230 cents   F//<br/> 36:        543.322 cents   F^    Gb(<br/> 37:        558.414 cents   F)    Gbv<br/> 38:        573.506 cents   F#\   Gb\\<br/> 39:        588.599 cents   F#    Gb\<br/> 40:        603.691 cents   F#/   Gb<br/> 41:        618.783 cents   F#//  Gb/<br/> 42:        633.875 cents   F#^   G(<br/> 43:        648.968 cents   F#)   Gv<br/> 44:        664.060 cents   G\\<br/> 45:        679.152 cents   G\<br/> 46:        701.955 cents   G                NEVA (your PENCHGAH?)<br/> 47:        717.047 cents   G/<br/> 48:        732.140 cents   G//<br/> 49:        747.232 cents   G^    Ab(<br/> 50:        762.324 cents   G)    Abv<br/> 51:        777.416 cents   G#\   Ab\\<br/> 52:        792.509 cents   G#    Ab\<br/> 53:        807.601 cents   G#/   Ab<br/> 54:        822.693 cents   G#//  Ab/<br/> 55:        837.785 cents   G#^   A(<br/> 56:        852.878 cents   G#)   Av<br/> 57:        867.970 cents   A\\                hisar     (in Huzzam Maqam)<br/> 58:        883.062 cents   A\                 hisarek (Hisar in Segah Maqam)<br/> 59:        898.155 cents   A                  HUSEYNI<br/> 60:        913.247 cents   A/                 huseyni once more<br/> 61:        928.339 cents   A//<br/> 62:        943.431 cents   A^    Bb(<br/> 63:        958.524 cents   A)    Bbv<br/> 64:        973.616 cents   A#\   Bb\\<br/> 65:        988.708 cents   A#    Bb\<br/> 66:       1003.800 cents   A#/   Bb<br/> 67:       1018.893 cents   A#//  Bb/<br/> 68:       1033.985 cents   A#^   B(<br/> 69:       1049.077 cents   A#)   Bv<br/> 70:       1064.170 cents   B\\<br/> 71:       1079.262 cents   B\<br/> 72:       1094.354 cents   B                  EWDJ<br/> 73:       1109.446 cents   B/    Cb        mahur<br/> 74:       1124.539 cents   B//   Cb/       mahurek?<br/> 75:       1139.631 cents   B^    C(<br/> 76:       1154.723 cents   B)    Cv<br/> 77:       1169.815 cents   B#\   C\\<br/> 78:       1184.908 cents   B#    C\<br/> 79:       1200.000 cents   C                 GERDANIYE</p><p>Maybe you can identify some Dastgahs in this system?</p><p>I found 79 MOS 159-tET in this way:</p><p>1.

Divide the pure fourth (4/3) into 33 equal parts. This gives<br/>  &gt; you a comma of ~15.1 cents.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; 2. Stack up 79 of these until you get as close to the octave as<br/>  &gt; possible (~1192.3 cents)<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; 3. Complete the octave to 1200 cents, and find the remainder<br/>  &gt; comma as ~22.8 cents.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; 4. Move this comma between steps 45-46 to acquire a pure fifth<br/>  &gt; (3/2).<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Voila! You have found a system which is practically 79-tone<br/>  &gt; moment of symmetry out of 159-edo. This means that you have two<br/>  &gt; types of basic intervals in the temperament. Because the<br/>  &gt; resolution is dense, you may play all Maqams on all degrees with<br/>  &gt; acceptable error (maximum 7-8 cents).</p><p>  Dear Ozan,</p><p>  Thanks for this.

Still, here is list of<br/>&gt; common intervals which I deem important:</p><p>Thanks Ozan.  But I still have some concerns:</p><p>() I think the formatting of the table my not be right on my<br/>machine.  I don&apos;t require the Scala E79 notation column, if<br/>that helps.</p><p>() Shall I take it that your targets are ratios here?  In<br/>that case I don&apos;t need the cents column either.</p><p>() What are the ratios in parenthesis?</p><p>() Why is there sometimes more than one ratio per line,<br/>even outside paranthesis?</p><p>() Some of these ratios have large numbers in them.  Are<br/>they compound, in the sense that they are reached by<br/>stacking certain target intervals?  Since you have said<br/>that Maqam music has &quot;key&quot;, I seek only the targets needed<br/>in a single key, not those needed over the course of an<br/>entire piece if it modulates.  Also, if some targets are<br/>used in certain Maqams and not in others, it would be<br/>helpful to group them by Maqam.</p><p>With continued effort to understand your 79-MOS scale,</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
