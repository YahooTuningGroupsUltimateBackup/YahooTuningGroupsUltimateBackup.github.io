I strongly urge everyone to listen to this.  I got it off <a href="http://emusic.com">emusic.com</a>...  only $10 a month for a subscription or you can sign up for a free 30 day or 100 download trial (which really kicks butt)...  I&apos;m giving them free advertising...  but it is worth it if you like world music or electronica... anyway... I would like to press the list if the might know anything about this music and its tuning...  it is rather interesting....</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div>
