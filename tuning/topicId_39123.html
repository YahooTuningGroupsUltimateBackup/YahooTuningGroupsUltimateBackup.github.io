That will be a great &quot;supplement,&quot; but as you mention,<br/>yourself, the format and concept really works best on the Web (in<br/>*my* opinion).  It also allows for the frequent updates and<br/>amplifications that you have recently been doing, of course.  Not<br/>such a &quot;static&quot; format as print...  Frankly, I think some of the<br/>diagrams come off &quot;better&quot; on the web.  Sometimes graphics are hard<br/>to print and don&apos;t look so good after they&apos;re printed, unless one has<br/>an excellent printer and some pretty good luck!</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe P.</p></div>
