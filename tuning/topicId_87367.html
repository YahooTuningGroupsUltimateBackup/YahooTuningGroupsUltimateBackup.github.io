Something more realistic would be to pick out the bad intervals in, say, 7-8 tone subsets.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you avoid these 37 intervals when constructing a chord you can&apos;t go<br/>wrong. Michael pointed out that the 33/16 interval is clearly dissonant<br/>using a piano &quot;voice&quot;. Using sine wave tones however the beating is<br/>obvious but to my ear not too unpleasant.&quot;<br/>     True...it&apos;s not too bad...here low critical band dissonance helps level out the high periodic dissonance.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If I&apos;m right then this is big, bigger than Pythagoras and Harry Partch rolled into one.&quot;<br/>       Pythagorus comes across to me as very narrow minded; reducing everything to circles of 5ths or near-5ths.  Partch is more interesting, but still seems to boil down to straight o-tonal and u-tonal relationships so far as I see it.<br/>       If you want to pick a tuning/&quot;scale-smith&quot; icon to compete against, I&apos;d recommend people such as Erv Wilson, William Sethares, and Ptolemy...all of who break far away from mean-tone, 12TET, and other temperament systems based on &quot;circle of xths&quot; logic.  Wilson and Ptolemy also turn out to both consider critical band roughness and periodicity in their models: Ptolemy&apos;s Homolon or &quot;Smooth&quot; system merges on 7TET intervals and thus avoid critical band &quot;rough&quot;-ness while using very periodic tetra-chords while Wilson&apos;s Moment of Symmetry system balances between equal-spaced critical band smoothness and the sort of slightly-jagged major/minor harmonic series stacked intervals that encourage high periodicity.  To be honest though, MOS seems to fall apart so far as consonance at around 6 notes to my ears and Ptolemy&apos;s system doesn&apos;t seem to do as well as it should with making consonant chords that go between different octaves IE &quot;G5 B5 E6&quot;.  For sure,<br/> there is lots of progress left to be made/found.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you play keyboards then check out my system using the sine voice, it<br/>should be consistent. Also it seems to me that using pure sine wave<br/>tones this system is more versatile than any other.&quot;<br/>   In a way it is....if a tuning system fails with sine waves, it&apos;s guaranteed to fail with all other waveforms.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The next step is using synthetic tones that have exactly 16 harmonics.<br/>The frequencies of the harmonics are x, 2x, 3x, 4x...up to 16x. The<br/>amplitude of each harmonic is y, y/2, y/3, y/4... up to y/16.&quot;<br/>   Right, but I&apos;m still worried you are going to wind up simply merging your scale ever closer to plain old diatonic-JI if you use many overtones over 5 or so in your &quot;overtone roughness&quot; analysis...unless you take the amplitude of overtones into account and make overtones over around 5 much lower on volume than the other ones.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2010 8:51:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Anyway, the point is: your system should be describing how music<br/>works, not how you believe it should work.

I say ease of use since more good chords means less chances to go wrong and less chances to make mistakes in playing chords under the scale...a good scale, to me, needs less theory because the scale itself resolves many conflicts even without the need for musicians to &quot;calculate&quot; how to avoid sour chords and thus hit sweet ones.<br/>B) At least 6 notes so as to be as or nearly as melodically flexible as traditional 7-tone scales...at least if you want to compete with popular music&apos;s typical 7-tone scales.</p><p>    You know what...many of my scales can&apos;t play certain Western chords because they simply use different interval sets...yet they put different chords in their places so it&apos;s &quot;changing&quot; rather than &quot;dropping&quot; chords.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>John&gt; If I&apos;m right then this is big, bigger than Pythagoras and Harry Partch rolled into one.</p><p>Mike B&gt;&quot;I suggest familiarizing yourself with both Sethares&apos; theory of<br/>roughness-based consonance as well as Erlich&apos;s ideas on harmony<br/>entropy before throwing out ridiculous statements like that.&quot;<br/>    Ah, a follow-up on my statements about Sethares&apos; relevance to any use of instruments beside sine waves and critical band dissonance...yes Sethares work is incredibly important.<br/>    Erlich (at least to me) comes across as kind of a grandfather of Just Intonation.

The most often criticism I hear of micro-tonality is that &quot;12TET is hard enough&quot;, meaning the learning curve for micro-tonal is high and many people view it as lots of extra effort for very little reward.  Making things like less sour chords possible in new scales makes those scales much easier to digest for the general public.  You see it as training wheels, I see it as putting full gear on when I ride my motorcycle.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It is as if composers are incapable of selecting notes for a chord<br/>properly.<br/>If you want to create music mindlessly without effort there is<br/>already a solution for you:&quot;<br/>   Counter-example...my brother is a professional jazz guitarist and definitely not a lazy mindless musician.  He won&apos;t touch micro-tonality (and Lord knows I&apos;ve tried, showing him the works of Neil Haverstick and several others on this list)...and even he gave the &quot;12TET is hard enough&quot; excuse.  He also told me he was afraid of not being able to find good chords and having to &quot;start from scratch&quot;.  And you&apos;d better believe he is NOT that type of person to use Microsoft Songsmith. :-)</p><p> So I think there exist two options to lessen the harshness of the micro-tonal learning curve<br/>1)  Make scales with very few ways to make sour chords and thus lessen the amount of new theory needed to learn them...what type of chords (including those not in common practice) does not matter in this so long as they are not sour.<br/>2)  Avoid making musicians learn any new theory at all and make all &quot;common practice&quot; 12TET chords accessible in all keys (thus indirectly forcing the scale to sound a lot like 12TET)</p><p>....and, as you might have guessed...out of these two I strongly side with 1)</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2010 7:20:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike B&gt;&quot;So when people say things like &quot;a major 7 chord is considered<br/>dissonant,&quot; my question is - by who?

Indeed having a dissonant interval in a chord does not make that chord dissonant...only makes it more likely to be dissonant (IE there are very few consonant chords possible using the minor second and the fact common practice scales space the seconds at maximal distance apart to try to (not so successfully IMVHO) combat this issue is no accident).</p><p>MikeB&gt; &quot;I didn&apos;t say that E-F by itself wasn&apos;t dissonant, but that C-E-F-A wasn&apos;t dissonant. &quot;<br/>     Here (as I&apos;ve said before) the relatively far-spaced C E and F A intervals seem to compensate for the overly close E-F interval and draw attention away from the E-F dyad.  Then again, I agree that doing something like chaining minor seconds within a chord IE C EFF# is too dense to be consonant.  I think there&apos;s a sweet spot somewhere around the not-used-in-common-practice 12/11 interval where you can get things like 8:10:11:12 (with the consecutive &quot;smaller than major second&quot; 11/10 and 12/11 intervals) and still be consonant enough for it to count as a true chord and not just a bunch of densely arranged &quot;neighboring tones&quot;.</p><p>   Yeah here I go again :-)...I think a huge problem is that scale-smiths keep trying to get excellent chord capability out of 15/14 and 16/15 when they should break free of common-practice and make scales using 12/11 and 11/10 as &quot;(new) minor seconds&quot; instead.

Chords like C E F A are<br/>used all of the time, but you guys act like they&apos;re &quot;dissonant&quot;<br/>because of the beating.&quot;</p><p> I NEVER said C E F A was dissonant, look at my wording&apos;<br/>&gt;    Let me sum it up this way...what makes a good system (IMVHO)<br/>includes<br/>&gt; A) An excellent &quot;consonant chord&quot;-to-note ratio IE as many chords<br/>as possible per notes available to make sure it has both great harmonic<br/>flexibility and ease of use.<br/>   And I&apos;ve used C E F A as an example of a consonant chord many times before...even used it as an example of how non-extended JI can be a flawed theory in assuming a chord so high up the series &quot;has&quot; to be dissonant.  The re-state (for, what, the 5th time)...I think EF is dissonant but CEFA is not since the C E and F A intervals are spaced far enough that their consonance counters the EF&apos;s dissonance.  Why do I avoid the 16/15 or 15/14 EF interval then and use 12/11 and 11/10 instead?  Because, so far as I&apos;ve found, you can&apos;t make anything with too many dissonant dyads IE a chord with EFF# work while making a chord with 10:11:12 in it work seems a lot easier to do.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Furthermore - what&apos;s wrong with beating? Beating can sound amazing in a musical context.&quot;<br/>Right, but the problem is learning curve of memorizing, say, tons of new chords in order to make sure you get the level of beating you want when you want it.  Hence my mention of musicians I know hating micro-tonality because of the often-taken-as-hideous learning curve.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What it really boils down to is that in reality there is no single quantitative dimension of &quot;consonance, &quot; but rather several interacting features.&quot;<br/>    Well I would say the two most established are periodicity and critical band dissonance...and if you look at my theories, I use both of those together extensively.</p><p>&gt; B) At least 6 notes so as to be as or nearly as melodically<br/>flexible as traditional 7-tone scales...at least if you want to compete<br/>with popular music&apos;s typical 7-tone scales.<br/>&gt;&quot;OK, so the pentatonic scale isn&apos;t a &quot;valid system&quot; then?&quot;</p><p>I had said :at least if you want to compete<br/>with popular music&apos;s typical 7-tone scales.&quot;    And it&apos;s not valid as I see it in the sense of not being able to compete with typical 7-tone scales and get the public&apos;s attention on that level.  It&apos;s an issue of the musical flexibility of having both a few more tones and exponentially more harmonies available from those extra tones.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you were going to assign Paul a &quot;label&quot; the first thing that comes to mind would be regular temperament rather than JI.&quot;<br/>       I say JI because his theory of harmonic entropy consistantly hits dead-on JI ratios and the levels of consonance marked for each interval is fairly consistent with what the odd-limit consonance for those ratios is according to JI theory.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think that very &quot;rough&quot; intervals can be heard as harmonic, and their &quot;roughness&quot; doesn&apos;t detract from the pleasantness of the chord.&quot;<br/>I would counter to say they can, but only when balanced by a certain degree of consonant intervals.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And even more importantly, any theory that basically comes out of the following train of thought:<br/>1) The entire matter of whether a listener will like or dislike a<br/>sound/chord/ whatever can be simplistically reduced to how &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>it is&quot;<br/>   Not at all true, I&apos;m simply saying they should meet a minimum level of consonance to avoid coming across as &quot;un-calculated noise&quot; to many listeners.  Considering my standard definition for meeting &quot;ok&quot; consonance levels for held/sustained dyads is about 12/11 I don&apos;t see why that would make a hard standard to meet at all (many musicians say 6/5 is where consonance &quot;stops&quot; for dyads; I consider my definition of where dissonance really gets to people pretty liberal).</p><p>&gt;&quot;2) This entire dimension of &quot;consonance&quot; results from a single physical or psychoacoustic or mathematical principle&quot;<br/>   I am starting to question how much people are listening to from me.  I consistently name periodicity theory and critical band dissonance as basis for any theories of consonance I have...so that&apos;s two, not one.  If you consider things I&apos;ve discussed like mirroring around intervals and chaining/&quot;squaring&quot; certain super-particular intervals plus other things I&apos;ve mentioned...there are several theories that translate into what makes consonance work.  Ultimately yes...I believe there is an ultimate answer, but it sure as heck is NOT composed of just one principle.</p><p>&gt;&quot;3) Musical elements that don&apos;t fit into this and are thus &quot;dissonant&quot; have a very limited or no musical use&quot;<br/>     Well, many of them DO have very limited musical use so far as sustained harmony.  Within a single octave, beside C EF A, C EF B and transposed versions of those chords...how many chords can you find with half-steps that can be used as sustained chords without getting an annoyed &quot;hey, this guy doesn&apos;t know music!&quot; reaction from the audience?<br/>    Agreed, far as melody and neighboring tones you can get a bit more adventurous, using more dissonant chords and even &quot;accidentals&quot; for short &quot;stabs&quot; while still making the music sound confident and professional.</p><p>    But I&apos;m mainly talking about consonance so far as being used in sustained chords in harmony and, sadly, attitudes like &quot;odd dissonances are ok&quot; I swear are sadly those that keep much micro-tonal music from reaching the public ear and making a difference in what kinds of music theory are taught in schools.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, April 14, 2010 2:51:05 AM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Natural Pan Temperament with pure sine wave tones</p><p>&gt;    Oddly enough, I think perhaps both of you are being too narrow-minded on this issue.<br/>&gt;    Let me sum it up this way...what makes a good system (IMVHO) includes<br/>&gt; A) An excellent &quot;consonant chord&quot;-to-note ratio IE as many chords as possible per notes available to make sure it has both great harmonic flexibility and ease of use.  I say ease of use since more good chords means less chances to go wrong and less chances to make mistakes in playing chords under the scale...a good scale, to me, needs less theory because the scale itself resolves many conflicts even without the need for musicians to &quot;calculate&quot; how to avoid sour chords and thus hit sweet ones.</p><p>You and John have a unique definition of &quot;consonance&quot; that as far as I<br/>know nobody else in the world subscribes to.

For years I thought that &quot;temperament&quot; meant a tuning system&apos;s nature or character and only discovered relatively recently that it implies some notes are &apos;tempered&apos; so as to fit a scale. It implies imperfection. Interestingly the latin word &apos;temperamentum&apos; means &apos;correct mixture&apos;. So if you like call it &apos;Natural Pan Tuning&apos;. &apos;NPT&apos; for short whichever word you prefer.</p><p>There are 61 &apos;bad&apos; intervals (listed earlier) in NPT and not 37 (using sine waves). I said 37 because, with my system, *all* intervals that are one or two notes apart are dissonant. There are 24 of these. So you only have to learn the other 37.</p><p>With regard to chords that contain very narrow (dissonant) intervals it seems to me that no matter how much you &apos;dress up&apos; the chord (adding wider and stronger intervals), the dissonance of the &apos;bad&apos; interval can still be heard if you listen carefully.</p><p>Michael, it seems to me that we&apos;ve been working along parallel lines: the 1/x + 1/y part of my formula refers to periodicity and the x/y part (note x&lt;y) deals with dissonance (I think the term you use is &quot;critical band dissonance&quot; or something like that).

The first thing to do is to work out how &apos;strong&apos; each harmonic is. Then when pairing each of the harmonics of two notes &apos;weight&apos; each calculation according to the strength value of the weaker harmonic (the strength of the pairing is only as strong as the weaker element). I&apos;m working on this at the moment and should have something in a day or two. This is where my theory on chords comes in (the harmonic series of one note is a &apos;chord&apos;).</p><p>If I&apos;m on the right track then I will have an approximate system that covers all possible intervals for &quot;ideal notes&quot; (i.e. the harmonics are exactly x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x etc, and the &apos;initial&apos; amplitudes of the harmonics (before they are paired with all the others to give &apos;overall&apos; amplitudes) are exactly y, y/2, y/3, y/4 etc.). At the moment I&apos;m just working with the first 16 harmonics which should be enough to get a rough idea. So with instruments whose timbres are close to &quot;ideal notes&quot; we&apos;ll have a &apos;rough guide&apos; to consonance.

There&apos;s no Holy Grail, only smarter ways to optimize.

How would it handle the chord of C E F A?  My guess is it would call it dissonant when it&apos;s not.<br/>  Hate to sound like a Puritan...but anything which pretty much sums a chord by its &quot;weakest link&quot; is bound not only to fail, but to contradict critical band theory.  It would almost be like trying to prove 45/43 is a just interval.<br/>  Plug all the dyads possible in a pure C E F A into your formula and then try it with a pure C D# G B...then repeat the analysis by adding values from Plompt and Llevelt&apos;s dissonance curve (which is used directly by Sethares).  I strongly suspect you&apos;ll see your formula&apos;s results will contradict his...and the ears of most people (to whom C E F A is a fairly consonant chord).

But for now they aren&apos;t.&quot;<br/>    Right.  The marketability for such ideas, no matter how carefully thought out is low.  Heck, I think much a micro-tonality faces that issue...people see it as facing a high learning curve and often ending up with music that send &quot;tons of schematic information&quot; and yet gives very little added benefit far as emotional flexibility IE you hear a lot more and a lot as different, but very few of it makes enough sense to really nod your head to.</p><p>    It&apos;s funny because things like 22TET octa-tonic scales seem to almost make it: sounding very clear despite employing a large deal of new information...but the learning curve is pretty nasty and the numbers of chords that work / the number possible seems smaller even than under 12TET, plus there are more keys to keep track of.  I think systems like 22TET have great potential for listeners...but only so-so potential for recruiting new composers to micro-tonality.<br/>   Also, honestly, it amazes me just how much music theory is needed to teach classical music in 12TET or mean-tone...you&apos;d think if these musical systems were so elegant musicians would just have to memorize a handful of chords/intervals to avoid instead on memorizing hundreds of chords knowing hundreds more will simply sound out of tune.  I can indeed see where musicians get that annoying &quot;12TET is hard enough&quot; line from.</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 8:55:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Let me interrupt with this link</p><p>I released Revisionist Phiter under the pseudonym Charlie (et al)  and it<br/>has almost 1,800 DLs from this site</p><p><a href="http://charlie-buddha-ghandi-revisionist-phiter-mp3-download.kohit.net/_/893130">http://charlie-buddha-ghandi-revisionist-phiter-mp3-download.kohit.net/_/893130</a></p><p>Now -  look towards the bottom and look for<br/>Charlie - Over Silver Ho 1854<br/>Charlie - Over Silver Ho 1743</p><p>Apparently this piece with your silver tuning was uploaded twice and has<br/>close to 4,000 DLs</p><p>On Thu, Apr 15, 2010 at 11:25 AM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MikeB&gt;&quot;One of my favorite tricks in 12-equal these days is to use a cluster<br/>&gt; of 5 half steps to represent 16:17:18:19: 20.<br/>&gt;     Cool...though I do hear my brain trying to tune to 8:9:10 and treating<br/>&gt; the other tones like &quot;noise&quot; IE I don&apos;t see much gain in actual tonal<br/>&gt; variety.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 9:29:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you&apos;d like an even more trivial example, how about C D E G?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you say that&apos;s dissonant?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if a piece of music establishes major and minor triads as the<br/>&gt; &gt; basic harmonies then I at least hear both of these chords as<br/>&gt; &gt; unstable and in need of a resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, because the composer is using little musical tricks to mess<br/>&gt; with your mind and get you to hear that chord as &quot;unfamiliar&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;out of place&quot; or something.

For example, there is a dramatic difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between major and minor 7-limit tetrads even though they have the<br/>&gt; &gt; same (consonant) interval content but in different order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about the consonance/dissonance of all of its subsets? That is,<br/>&gt; all of its dyads, but then all of its triads as well?</p><p>(I assume we are talking about a sensory aspect of<br/>consonance/dissonance that is independent of the musical context.)</p><p>Yes, and not only the proper subsets but also the complete chord&apos;s<br/>fit to a harmonic series should be considered. As a harmonic series<br/>subset the 7-limit minor tetrad is 70:84:105:120 which results in a<br/>complex waveform. Interpreting the minor tetrad as 10:12:15:17 makes<br/>it sound smoother even if it then goes beyond 7-limit.</p><p>It might even be interpreted as 24:29:36:41! (Incidentally, the<br/>ratios 24:29, 41:24 and 41:29 are extremely well approximated in 22-<br/>equal.) Now, I&apos;m not suggesting these numbers as such are<br/>particularly meaningful for auditory system but with steady tones the<br/>resulting waveform is audibly more periodic than 70:84:105:120. The<br/>dyads might still be heard as approximate 7-limit intervals which<br/>would make this a case of harmonic tempering! Also, 10:12:15:17 is<br/>not readily extendable into &quot;9-limit&quot; minor pentad while that could<br/>be interpreted as 24:29:32:36:41. But enough of this. :)</p><p>&gt; Besides, the brain doesn&apos;t know that we conceive of a sound coming<br/>&gt; in as a unified &quot;chord,&quot; it just hears a bunch of different<br/>&gt; harmonic relationships going on.</p><p>I disagree a little: if partials have close onsets the auditory system<br/>tends to group them together. That&apos;s why there are formulas for the<br/>preparation of dissonances: because the dissonant interval is<br/>introduced so that the voices don&apos;t enter into it simultaneously its&apos;<br/>dissonance is much reduced.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I wonder if at least in older jazz the intervals traditionally<br/>&gt; &gt; classified as dissonances tend to move (when they move) to<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals traditionally classified as consonances even when using<br/>&gt; &gt; seventh and ninth chords and beyond. This is just a hunch, I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t know enough about jazz to claim anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is partially it, but also partially that it manages to<br/>&gt; manipulate all of the above elements to get you to hear intervals<br/>&gt; previously considered &quot;dissonant&quot; as consonant. It also really<br/>&gt; reveals how much stuff labeled as inherently &quot;dissonant&quot; can have a<br/>&gt; very consonant use that was previously unknown.</p><p>Maybe in such music there is a less clear cut difference between<br/>consonance and dissonance but surely some chords are more unstable<br/>than others (like dim7).</p><p>&gt; Again I don&apos;t really just mean just &quot;jazz&quot; per se, but all of that<br/>&gt; early 20th century American pop music (and some late Romantic music<br/>&gt; too).

Hell, for some<br/>&gt; of that stuff using maj7 chords over the I chord is necessary (or a<br/>&gt; related variant, like a maj 6/9 chord or something).

The average musician wouldn&apos;t be able to make sense out of<br/>any of this if it weren&apos;t for the theory already in place. You keep<br/>exploring, messing with new sounds, going by subtle intuitive<br/>inklings, questioning areas of arbitrariness in the existing theory.</p><p>&gt; The other thing is, ok, those are two ways to use consecutive half-steps...but I doubt there are that many more so, unless you can show they are, it kind of throws a rod in the concept of versatility/variety of half steps in harmony.&nbsp; In the above example it sounds like you&apos;re stressing certain notes in the cluster by putting a chord under it to boost the more harmonic roots in the cluster with the overtones of the Lydian Aug 2...thus getting a more tense Lydian Aug 2 type of sound...is that correct?</p><p>Sort of. I&apos;m not really sure how it works. The long story:</p><p>I started messing around with the concept of a &quot;#15&quot; a while ago,<br/>which in JI would most likely be tuned 135/128. I figured that since<br/>there&apos;s a clear progression from major -&gt; major7 -&gt; major9 -&gt; maj9#11<br/>-&gt; maj9#11/13, that maj9#11/13/#15 would be next. And it sort of works<br/>that way, once you figure out how to &quot;massage&quot; the situation so that<br/>you don&apos;t just hear that note as incredibly weird and foreign. This is<br/>more of an art than a science (so far).</p><p>So I figured out how to make that interval sound harmonic and then I<br/>started expanding it into a more dissonant sound, like Ebmaj/Gbmaj or<br/>something. So that G sticking out over the Gb is incredibly weird<br/>without a more direct &quot;bridge&quot; linking it to the Eb, but I got used to<br/>it. And then I started experimenting more, trying to figure out what<br/>the &quot;lydian aug version&quot;, would be then lydian aug #2. And THEN, if<br/>you view the #2 as just a fifth above the #5, I tried for one more<br/>fifth above that and got a #6. I also tried &quot;smushing&quot; all of the<br/>above modes together to get like an &quot;omni-lydian&quot; mode.</p><p>As you know the #6 is very close to 7/4 and suddenly it all snapped in<br/>for me that way. So at that point I had like 11 half steps in a row<br/>(imagine we&apos;re in Gb): C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb. Sweet.<br/>The only note that doesn&apos;t really fit is the Cb. But that&apos;s like the<br/>entire 12-tet chromatic scale being used in a consonant way. And you<br/>can very clearly hear hints of 14:15:16:17:18:19:20 in there, but it&apos;s<br/>sort of tempered and also has a different 5-limit perception as well.</p><p>The point? The point is that this is something new that hasn&apos;t been<br/>explored all that much in 12-tet (as you know, 17/16 and 19/16 have<br/>great approximations in 12-tet). And it also sounds good. I&apos;ll come up<br/>with some sound clips of me noodling around on it for you to listen<br/>to.</p><p>But the point is, I don&apos;t have any &quot;theory&quot; saying that stuff like<br/>this isn&apos;t possible.

My response:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; if a piece of music establishes major and minor triads as the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; basic harmonies then I at least hear both of these chords as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unstable and in need of a resolution.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure, because the composer is using little musical tricks to mess<br/>&gt; &gt; with your mind and get you to hear that chord as &quot;unfamiliar&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;out of place&quot; or something.

About messing with your mind: using seventh chords (or<br/>&gt; beyond) as basic harmonies is just as much a trick as triadic harmony<br/>&gt; is. All music messes with your mind in my opinion.</p><p>Agreed, but what is wrong is to take the historical &quot;tricks&quot; that<br/>people used and posit them as the foundation for the definition of<br/>consonance itself. They&apos;re just historical tricks.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That being said, to just write C-D-E-G off as an inherently<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant chord is a bit rash.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree but I&apos;d say the same about its&apos; &quot;inherent consonance&quot; too.</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>&gt; (I assume we are talking about a sensory aspect of<br/>&gt; consonance/dissonance that is independent of the musical context.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and not only the proper subsets but also the complete chord&apos;s<br/>&gt; fit to a harmonic series should be considered.</p><p>Certainly, as one of those subsets will be the chord itself. HOWEVER,<br/>chords can appear consonant even if the entire chord doesn&apos;t resolve<br/>too well to produce a unified fundamental. Then you get this sort of<br/>&quot;fractured fundamental&quot; or &quot;multiple fundamental&quot; approach.</p><p>A classic example is the 5-limit minor chord. Another example is a<br/>maj6 chord: 12:15:18:20. If this is spelled C-E-G-A, chances are<br/>you&apos;re not going to hear that F pop out on the bottom at all. Why?<br/>Because the strength of the C-E-G triad is overwhelming.</p><p>&gt; As a harmonic series<br/>&gt; subset the 7-limit minor tetrad is 70:84:105:120 which results in a<br/>&gt; complex waveform. Interpreting the minor tetrad as 10:12:15:17 makes<br/>&gt; it sound smoother even if it then goes beyond 7-limit.</p><p>Yes, but that doesn&apos;t eliminate chords that have complex overall JI<br/>representations from being able to be harmonically processed<br/>successfully by the brain. A Cmaj7#9 chord would most likely be tuned<br/>something like C E F# B D# (the F# added for harmonic stability,<br/>technically would make it a #11 chord as well). That in JI would be<br/>32:40:45:60:75. Not so consonant. However, you can still make sense of<br/>the chord as a series of interlinking harmonic relationships: you hear<br/>the Bmaj triad on top, the C-E dyad on the bottom, the E-B dyad<br/>linking the two together, etc. Perhaps if you&apos;re harmonically advanced<br/>enough you can hear the C-F# as 45:32 directly too and C-B as 15:8.<br/>Then you hear the less important relationships: the E-F# as 9:8, and<br/>the E-D# as 15:8, and you get the full &quot;map.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s my theory that once you come up with this &quot;map&quot; of the chord, you<br/>can start to get a &quot;glimpse&quot; of the full 32:40:45:60:75 structure -<br/>even if the direct waveform would otherwise be too complicated to<br/>understand. For example, 32:40:45:60:75 looks like it would be more<br/>dissonant than 31:39:45:59:71, because the numbers in the first are<br/>higher, but -- the first one will sound MUCH more &quot;consonant&quot; than the<br/>second. The first one is made up of a system of interlocking 5-limit<br/>dyads and thus the &quot;substructure&quot; can be attained and lead to the<br/>overall &quot;superstructure.&quot; The second one is made of higher-limit<br/>primes with no apparent relation to one another.</p><p>This getting a &quot;glimpse&quot; corresponds to a perceptual shift whereby the<br/>listener hears the whole chord as one unified structure instead of<br/>several unrelated polytonal structures. I think that this may take a<br/>few repeated listens to happen and that it is somewhat<br/>listener-dependent. It would explain why a piece of music like the<br/>Rite of Spring can sound so chaotic and random upon the first listen,<br/>but then after listening a few times the huge polychords contained<br/>therein start to become &quot;coherent.&quot;</p><p>I think this theory could use some updating though, because of what<br/>you wrote here:</p><p>&gt; It might even be interpreted as 24:29:36:41! (Incidentally, the<br/>&gt; ratios 24:29, 41:24 and 41:29 are extremely well approximated in 22-<br/>&gt; equal.) Now, I&apos;m not suggesting these numbers as such are<br/>&gt; particularly meaningful for auditory system but with steady tones the<br/>&gt; resulting waveform is audibly more periodic than 70:84:105:120. The<br/>&gt; dyads might still be heard as approximate 7-limit intervals which<br/>&gt; would make this a case of harmonic tempering! Also, 10:12:15:17 is<br/>&gt; not readily extendable into &quot;9-limit&quot; minor pentad while that could<br/>&gt; be interpreted as 24:29:32:36:41. But enough of this. :)</p><p>And also agreed that the interpretation of m6 as 10:12:15:17 is very<br/>underused (and extremely resonant as well). I came across that version<br/>a while ago and it&apos;s my new favorite tuning for that chord. I suppose<br/>it&apos;s a case of using JI as temperament, basically, like you said.</p><p>But it does make me question my &quot;map&quot; theory a bit - while my somewhat<br/>overused C-E-F#-B-D# analogy supports it, stuff like this doesn&apos;t. You<br/>can have conflicting &quot;maps&quot; for the same chord. How does that work?<br/>Does the brain just come up with a skewed non-JI representation for<br/>how things are working?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Besides, the brain doesn&apos;t know that we conceive of a sound coming<br/>&gt; &gt; in as a unified &quot;chord,&quot; it just hears a bunch of different<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic relationships going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree a little: if partials have close onsets the auditory system<br/>&gt; tends to group them together. That&apos;s why there are formulas for the<br/>&gt; preparation of dissonances: because the dissonant interval is<br/>&gt; introduced so that the voices don&apos;t enter into it simultaneously its&apos;<br/>&gt; dissonance is much reduced.</p><p>That is true and I concede your point. But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s really<br/>destructive to my point either, which is that - even though we might<br/>call chord like C-Eb-G 10:12:15, the brain doesn&apos;t really just hear it<br/>as that singular chunk, but multiple interlocking chunks as well.</p><p>&gt; Maybe in such music there is a less clear cut difference between<br/>&gt; consonance and dissonance but surely some chords are more unstable<br/>&gt; than others (like dim7).</p><p>It&apos;s just successful at getting you to raise your own tolerance for<br/>dissonance.

On the other hand,<br/>while a chord like 8:10:12:15 sounds consonant, a bare 8:15 dyad and<br/>particularly its&apos; inversion 15:16 sound dissonant played alone. To<br/>me, maj7 chord has a somewhat melancholic sound. Perhaps the 8:15<br/>doesn&apos;t really lose all of its&apos; dissonant quality in maj7 chord. In<br/>fact, I don&apos;t think it is necessary to think of seventh chords as<br/>consonant to use them as the basic sonorities. If there is always at<br/>least one dissonant interval to resolve by voice leading the music<br/>attains drive, emotion and &quot;virtual causality&quot;. I&apos;m pretty sure<br/>Vincent D&apos;Indy taught Cole Porter the common practice notion of<br/>dissonance.</p><p>It is debatable whether 8:9 or 9:10 sound consonant also outside<br/>chords but since the diatonic scale is normally considered a no-7s<br/>system there is a jump in relative dissonance with the 9-limit<br/>ratios. So it is at least understandable why there is such a clear-cut<br/>classification into consonances and dissonances in common practice<br/>theory.</p><p>One thing about 8:10:12:15: I don&apos;t think it is particularly important<br/>to have very well-tuned 8:15s in tempered maj7 chords for them to<br/>sound right. That would support understanding it as a chord with one<br/>dissonance in it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (I assume we are talking about a sensory aspect of<br/>&gt; &gt; consonance/dissonance that is independent of the musical context.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, and not only the proper subsets but also the complete chord&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; fit to a harmonic series should be considered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly, as one of those subsets will be the chord itself.<br/>&gt; HOWEVER, chords can appear consonant even if the entire chord<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t resolve too well to produce a unified fundamental. Then you<br/>&gt; get this sort of &quot;fractured fundamental&quot; or &quot;multiple fundamental&quot;<br/>&gt; approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A classic example is the 5-limit minor chord. Another example is a<br/>&gt; maj6 chord: 12:15:18:20. If this is spelled C-E-G-A, chances are<br/>&gt; you&apos;re not going to hear that F pop out on the bottom at all. Why?<br/>&gt; Because the strength of the C-E-G triad is overwhelming.</p><p>Yes and this multiple fundamental thing happens already as low in the<br/>harmonic series as 10:12:15.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As a harmonic series subset the 7-limit minor tetrad is<br/>&gt; &gt; 70:84:105:120 which results in a complex waveform. Interpreting<br/>&gt; &gt; the minor tetrad as 10:12:15:17 makes it sound smoother even if<br/>&gt; &gt; it then goes beyond 7-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but that doesn&apos;t eliminate chords that have complex overall JI<br/>&gt; representations from being able to be harmonically processed<br/>&gt; successfully by the brain.</p><p>Agreed. Chords higher up in the harmonic series must be played with<br/>very steady tones if the complete period is to have any effect on<br/>consonance. But likewise, I think dead steady electronic tones make<br/>the 7-limit minor tetrad sound less consonant than acoustic instument<br/>tones.</p><p>&gt; A Cmaj7#9 chord would most likely be<br/>&gt; tuned something like C E F# B D# (the F# added for harmonic<br/>&gt; stability, technically would make it a #11 chord as well). That in<br/>&gt; JI would be 32:40:45:60:75. Not so consonant. However, you can<br/>&gt; still make sense of the chord as a series of interlinking harmonic<br/>&gt; relationships: you hear the Bmaj triad on top, the C-E dyad on the<br/>&gt; bottom, the E-B dyad linking the two together, etc. Perhaps if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re harmonically advanced enough you can hear the C-F# as 45:32<br/>&gt; directly too and C-B as 15:8. Then you hear the less important<br/>&gt; relationships: the E-F# as 9:8, and the E-D# as 15:8, and you get<br/>&gt; the full &quot;map.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m skeptical about our abilities to literally hear these numerical<br/>relationships. I suppose that young children and very untutored<br/>listeners hear just an undifferentiated wash of sound when C E F# B D#<br/>is played. The rest of us hear out tones, intervals, dyads and triads<br/>with varying skill. Musical context, voice leading and such also<br/>play a role in what is heard.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s my theory that once you come up with this &quot;map&quot; of the chord,<br/>&gt; you can start to get a &quot;glimpse&quot; of the full 32:40:45:60:75<br/>&gt; structure - even if the direct waveform would otherwise be too<br/>&gt; complicated to understand. For example, 32:40:45:60:75 looks like<br/>&gt; it would be more dissonant than 31:39:45:59:71, because the numbers<br/>&gt; in the first are higher, but -- the first one will sound MUCH<br/>&gt; more &quot;consonant&quot; than the second. The first one is made up of a<br/>&gt; system of interlocking 5-limit dyads and thus the &quot;substructure&quot;<br/>&gt; can be attained and lead to the overall &quot;superstructure.&quot; The<br/>&gt; second one is made of higher-limit primes with no apparent relation<br/>&gt; to one another.</p><p>I think that subset consonance explains why the overall impression is<br/>more consonant in the first chord. I&apos;m not so sure if hearing the<br/>structure is important for consonance.</p><p>&gt; This getting a &quot;glimpse&quot; corresponds to a perceptual shift whereby<br/>&gt; the listener hears the whole chord as one unified structure instead<br/>&gt; of several unrelated polytonal structures. I think that this may<br/>&gt; take a few repeated listens to happen and that it is somewhat<br/>&gt; listener-dependent. It would explain why a piece of music like the<br/>&gt; Rite of Spring can sound so chaotic and random upon the first<br/>&gt; listen, but then after listening a few times the huge polychords<br/>&gt; contained therein start to become &quot;coherent.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this theory could use some updating though, because of what<br/>&gt; you wrote here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It might even be interpreted as 24:29:36:41! (Incidentally, the<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios 24:29, 41:24 and 41:29 are extremely well approximated in<br/>&gt; &gt; 22-equal.) Now, I&apos;m not suggesting these numbers as such are<br/>&gt; &gt; particularly meaningful for auditory system but with steady tones<br/>&gt; &gt; the resulting waveform is audibly more periodic than<br/>&gt; &gt; 70:84:105:120. The dyads might still be heard as approximate 7-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit intervals which would make this a case of harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; tempering! Also, 10:12:15:17 is not readily extendable into &quot;9-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit&quot; minor pentad while that could be interpreted as<br/>&gt; &gt; 24:29:32:36:41. But enough of this. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And also agreed that the interpretation of m6 as 10:12:15:17 is very<br/>&gt; underused (and extremely resonant as well). I came across that<br/>&gt; version a while ago and it&apos;s my new favorite tuning for that chord.<br/>&gt; I suppose it&apos;s a case of using JI as temperament, basically, like<br/>&gt; you said.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it does make me question my &quot;map&quot; theory a bit - while my<br/>&gt; somewhat overused C-E-F#-B-D# analogy supports it, stuff like this<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t. You can have conflicting &quot;maps&quot; for the same chord. How<br/>&gt; does that work? Does the brain just come up with a skewed non-JI<br/>&gt; representation for how things are working?</p><p>I still believe it doesn&apos;t need to make sense in terms of JI math to<br/>sound coherent.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, the brain doesn&apos;t know that we conceive of a sound<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; coming in as a unified &quot;chord,&quot; it just hears a bunch of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; different harmonic relationships going on.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I disagree a little: if partials have close onsets the auditory<br/>&gt; &gt; system tends to group them together. That&apos;s why there are<br/>&gt; &gt; formulas for the preparation of dissonances: because the<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant interval is introduced so that the voices don&apos;t enter<br/>&gt; &gt; into it simultaneously its&apos; dissonance is much reduced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is true and I concede your point. But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s really<br/>&gt; destructive to my point either, which is that - even though we might<br/>&gt; call chord like C-Eb-G 10:12:15, the brain doesn&apos;t really just hear<br/>&gt; it as that singular chunk, but multiple interlocking chunks as well.</p><p>Yes, I don&apos;t believe that &quot;exclusive allocation&quot; applies when<br/>listening to music. Multiple interpretations of the same data are<br/>often processed at the same time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Maybe in such music there is a less clear cut difference between<br/>&gt; &gt; consonance and dissonance but surely some chords are more unstable<br/>&gt; &gt; than others (like dim7).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just successful at getting you to raise your own tolerance for<br/>&gt; dissonance. Once that tolerance is raised, chords that previously<br/>&gt; sounded weird and out of place suddenly &quot;settle in&quot; and sound<br/>&gt; perfectly natural.</p><p>What sort of motor for musical movement do you propose other than<br/>the &quot;virtual causality&quot; of dissonances resolving to consonances?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I believe that this harmonic language was very much in use also in<br/>&gt; &gt; much of the music I was exposed in childhood: certain kinds of<br/>&gt; &gt; 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s popular music and the music of TV shows from that<br/>&gt; &gt; time.

Perhaps if I stopped<br/>doing that it would be more dissonant.</p><p>&gt; Agreed.

Because<br/>each &quot;note&quot; in the chord is itself a harmonic series placed to a<br/>fundamental, and the whole concept of chords involves seeing how these<br/>fundamentals then relate to each other.  Especially if the timbre has<br/>no fundamental of its own - let&apos;s say you play 4:5:6 with a timbre<br/>that has been sent through a high-pass filter so that no fundamental<br/>remains. So it&apos;s really a &quot;phantom&quot; 4, a &quot;phantom&quot; 5, and a &quot;phantom&quot;<br/>6.

I&apos;m betting you once they get the idea that things like a 9:11:12 chord aren&apos;t so alien the child will avoid getting into the pattern of &quot;only accepting one definition of consonance&quot;.<br/>   I am pretty convinced chords like 10:11:12 or 11:15:18 and certainly not only ones like 5:6:7 represent the near limits of the human mind to easily map chords.  One major thing I think keeps a lot of people from accepting things like extended JI or sometimes even something like 5-limit JI over 12TET is that the &quot;range&quot; of dissonance in 12TET is gradual while in things like JI often it&apos;s either &quot;x chord is perfectly pure&quot; or &quot;x chord is way off pure&quot; with very little in between to help the mind transition from one to the other.  I generally think making systems (or composing in ways) that have the most dissonant and least dissonant chords within a not-so-broad range of dissonance difference will make people less &quot;surprised&quot; by the extra dissonance.  In fact I think it&apos;s a huge part of modern music theory...the idea of drifting so and from dissonance within a not-so-broad range of dissonance...not only in things like chords, but also transitions, moving<br/> to and from less-consonant/tenser-sounding bridges only after getting the mind used to the theme, etc.</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 10:12:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>sorry again for the late response.

When you&apos;re used to a<br/>&gt; pristine environment where every chord is a major triad and every<br/>&gt; dyad consonant, your tolerance for things like maj7 chords and<br/>&gt; other crazy stacked extended harmonies will be... understandably<br/>&gt; low.</p><p>Actually very little common practice music is like that. Something<br/>like Mozart might sound non-offensive to an average listener but his<br/>music has dissonances everywhere. I think people are actually<br/>extremely tolerant when it comes to dissonance, it&apos;s just that when<br/>there is no audible logic in the treatment of dissonances (as in some<br/>contemporary music) they get frustrated.</p><p>&gt; I think part of the reason why 15/8 doesn&apos;t sound very dissonant to<br/>&gt; me is that I automatically &quot;imagine&quot; it as part of a major7 chord<br/>&gt; and thus create my own little &quot;map&quot; to the note. Perhaps if I<br/>&gt; stopped doing that it would be more dissonant.</p><p>Yes, see above what I said about the diatonic template.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m skeptical about our abilities to literally hear these<br/>&gt; &gt; numerical relationships. I suppose that young children and very<br/>&gt; &gt; untutored listeners hear just an undifferentiated wash of sound<br/>&gt; &gt; when C E F# B D# is played. The rest of us hear out tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals, dyads and triads with varying skill. Musical context,<br/>&gt; &gt; voice leading and such also play a role in what is heard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are your thoughts now that I have clarified my meaning above?<br/>&gt; Again I don&apos;t think we hear the 75/32 from C-D# &quot;directly,&quot; if you<br/>&gt; will, but I think that we do get a sense of how the D# is &quot;related&quot;<br/>&gt; to the C via a series of more consonant intervals (thirds and<br/>&gt; fifths). For the 12-tet chord C Eb G C Eb, we get a different way<br/>&gt; that the Eb is &quot;related&quot; to C, even though they&apos;re tuned the same<br/>&gt; interval.</p><p>I&apos;d say we hear all intervals directly but I don&apos;t really know if<br/>we hear them also indirectly through relationships. I think intervals<br/>heard as dissonant have much wider tolerance for mistuning than<br/>consonances. Their tuning can vary wildly, the only requirement being<br/>that they are recognized categorically as an instance of &quot;that<br/>interval&quot;. Example: 12-equal maj7 is much closer to 9:17 than 8:15<br/>but sounds fine. Perhaps the auditory system doesn&apos;t really recognize<br/>the 12-equal major seventh chord as a 8:10:12:15 harmonic series<br/>pattern. But in a 8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15 sonority, 8:15 tolerates less<br/>mistuning because the auditory system recognizes the harmonic series<br/>pattern. Here the 8:15 is unambiguous and thus according to the<br/>harmonic entropy idea, consonant.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think that subset consonance explains why the overall<br/>&gt; &gt; impression is more consonant in the first chord. I&apos;m not so sure<br/>&gt; &gt; if hearing the structure is important for consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Psychoacoustically speaking, it must be. Each of these intervals<br/>&gt; produces its own fundamental, and then I believe the brain figures<br/>&gt; out how the fundamentals themselves relate to each other. Why?<br/>&gt; Because each &quot;note&quot; in the chord is itself a harmonic series placed<br/>&gt; to a fundamental, and the whole concept of chords involves seeing<br/>&gt; how these fundamentals then relate to each other.  Especially if<br/>&gt; the timbre has no fundamental of its own - let&apos;s say you play 4:5:6<br/>&gt; with a timbre that has been sent through a high-pass filter so that<br/>&gt; no fundamental remains. So it&apos;s really a &quot;phantom&quot; 4, a &quot;phantom&quot;<br/>&gt; 5, and a &quot;phantom&quot; 6. Chances are you&apos;ll still hear the &quot;double<br/>&gt; phantom&quot; 2 and 1 popping out anyway.</p><p>First, you are confusing two &quot;fundamentals&quot; here. The &quot;fundamental&quot;<br/>of your high-pass filtered timbre is just the first harmonic. But<br/>that is not what we hear when we hear the fundamental of an interval,<br/>a chord or a high-pass filtered tone. There is nothing particularly<br/>special about this &quot;fundamental&quot;, it is just one of the harmonics.<br/>Pitch is not the first harmonic. Instead pitch at least correlates<br/>with the *fundamental frequency* of a periodic vibration.<br/>Fundamental frequency is a quantity i.e. property-like entity while<br/>harmonics are thing-like entities. There is nothing phantom (or<br/>virtual) about the fundamental frequency even in the &quot;missing<br/>fundamental&quot; situations but I do approve the use of &quot;phantom&quot;<br/>in relation to chords as chords are at least partly some kind<br/>of &quot;fake sources&quot; from the point of view of the auditory system.</p><p>Second, the auditory system probably finds the pitch of the 4:5:6<br/>complex directly, not by first finding 4, 5 and 6.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 10:35:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kalle&gt;&quot;I think people are actually extremely tolerant when it comes to dissonance, it&apos;s just that when<br/>there is no audible logic in the treatment of dissonances (as in some contemporary music) they get frustrated.&quot;</p><p>    I agree with a lot of this.  The problem seems to start when you go, say, from high consonance to much higher dissonance or vice-versa where the brain has trouble predicting where the dissonance range is.  In many (if not most) cases I&apos;ve found producing a scale with lots of reasonably pure intervals sounds much more relaxed/balanced than one with some perfectly pure intervals and some dead-sour intervals...because the composer can suddenly switch consonance/dissonance level by a huge amount.  If you play chords that are consistently fairly dissonant the mind will begin to expect dissonance and relax a bit...but it you take a bunch of consistently consonant chords and suddenly switch to a consonant one the brain or vice-versa becomes confused.  Note, especially in Igs aka &quot;City of the Asleep&quot;&apos;s music he uncovers consonances in dissonant tunings and manages to meld both high dissonance and consonance...but he is consistently very careful to fade<br/> gently between the two (something a whole lot of micro-tonalists seem to fail at).</p><p>&gt;&quot;There is an unfortunate tendency to equate &apos;dissonant&apos; with &apos;bad&apos; and &apos;consonant&apos; with &apos;good&apos; but there is no logical connection here. &quot;<br/>   I think it&apos;s fair to say there is a point where, say, even with chords of about equal dissonance that flow well into each other there is such a thing as too much dissonance.  However I think such a &quot;limit&quot; on minimum dissonance is at a considerably higher level of dissonance than most standard chords in 12TET.  The problem, I believe, is when people think &quot;dissonance&quot; they think of a fairly (though not terribly) sour chord being played uncontrollably in the middle of a bunch of sweet-sounding chords IE by an inexperienced musician.  That and the fact many people like larger chords (IE 4+ notes) and adding more notes to chords often adds to dissonance...hence to enable larger chords you often need to move the minimum consonance level to a higher level of consonance.  Another note is that musicians like Bach obviously use a lot of string sections...and chords played with strings (IE cello, violin, viola...) often sound more consonant than the same<br/> chords with other instruments due to how the overtones of those stringed instruments slide up/downwards (frequency modulation) and often at one point in this slide align was other root tones and overtones they wouldn&apos;t align with if they were not modulated.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
