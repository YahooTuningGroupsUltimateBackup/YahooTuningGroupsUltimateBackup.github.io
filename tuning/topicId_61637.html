And, of course, it brings to mind country music as well, which has often been referred to as white man&apos;s blues, which it certainly can be. Hank Williams wrote numerous blues, and Johnny Cash&apos;s &quot;Blood Sweat and Tears&quot; is one of my favorite all time blues albums...even though several of the tunes are not traditional blues forms, there&apos;s a deep blues feeling there...it&apos;s a masterpiece.

You want my guess? Probably<br/>pretty close to 5-limit JI. With pentatonic vocal melodies<br/>i don&apos;t think you&apos;d have a problem with commatic-drift etc.<br/>But pythagorean is also a possiblity. And then on the other<br/>hand, meantone was so pervasive in Europe from c.1500 on<br/>that it would be no surprise to me at all if that&apos;s what<br/>the European settlers brought to America.</p><p>Another thing to consider is the possible influence<br/>that Native-American music may have had on the evolution<br/>of music in America after the &quot;Euro-African invasion&quot;.<br/>But i know precious little about the tuning of<br/>Native-American music.</p><p>&gt; And, of course, it brings to mind country music as well,<br/>&gt; which has often been referred to as white man&apos;s blues,<br/>&gt; which it certainly can be.

I think it&apos;s one of the most fantastic<br/>things Hollywood has produced in a long time, and while<br/>i have never done any serious research on Ray Charles,<br/>it seems to me that the facts presented in that movie<br/>are probably genuine. (And Foxx did an *amazing* job of<br/>impersonating Charles!)</p><p>Anyway, at the point where Ray changed record labels and<br/>got total control of his music -- *and* a full orchestra<br/>to back him up -- he recorded &quot;I Can&apos;t Stop Loving You&quot; in<br/>all its whitey-country glory. His bandmates thought he<br/>went crazy ... but it went on to become his biggest seller<br/>at the time.</p><p>&gt; (Muddy also said once in Guitar Player mag, that Roy Clark<br/>&gt; was his favorite guitarist).</p><p>Now that&apos;s a bit of news i&apos;m *really* surprised to learn!<br/>Wow.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
