This is truly perverse thinking. I would go much<br/>further and say that even in the renaissance and baroque the harmonic<br/>pivots to new keys (no matter how they conceived of them) are what<br/>give the music its delicious color.</p><p>I had a tenor in my choir at one point (fortunately not for long)<br/>that had trouble hearing the shift to a new tonal center and would<br/>ignore the accidentals that acted as harmonic pivots to the new<br/>center. It totally destroyed the musicality of the section for him to<br/>do that. I agree wholeheartedly that one&apos;s ear has to be totally<br/>gross to think that way.</p><p>I teach people to hear the reduced syntonic comma one can demonstrate<br/>even with a 12-EDO electronic keyboard. You can play octave Cs, for<br/>example, and fill in the fifth with your voice. Then shift inwards to<br/>a fifth between Eb and Bb and it will force the fifth to shift down<br/>about 18 cents. It would be 21.5 cents on a just keyboard, but the<br/>two cents flatness of the fifths reduces this in 12-EDO. Since<br/>electronic keyboards tuned to 12-EDO are available almost everywhere,<br/>I have taken a practical approach using octaves as just, fifths as<br/>quasi-JI, and letting the voice or whatever fill in the thirds,<br/>sixths, etc.</p><p>It works beautifully to train people&apos;s ears to hear fine pitch<br/>differences on the order of the syntonic comma. I usually start with<br/>the septimal comma, however, since this 27 cent comma is conversely<br/>*augmented* by four cents on a 12-EDO keyboard to 31 cents (almost a<br/>third of a semitone)! This is still difficult for many to hear<br/>initially. By that I mean they shift, but usually do so slowly and<br/>fail to notice it. Doing it myself as a demonstration usually brings<br/>out some &quot;aha&quot; experiences, since it&apos;s easier for them to hear<br/>someone else doing it in one quick, sure move that is actually quite<br/>a significant one. When they&apos;re solid with that themselves, then I<br/>move to the one mentioned first.</p><p>I like to use an octave and fifth (e.g., C-G-C&apos;) and have them fill<br/>in the seventh, which once their ears have become habituated to fill<br/>in just thirds will tend toward the JI septimal seventh of 4:7 rather<br/>than the JI 9:16. The top octave is important, since an 8:9 second<br/>down from it feels more dissonant that 7:8, so it helps force the<br/>issue a bit.</p><p>Once they can reliably fill in the JI 4:7, I then move inward to the<br/>fourth between F and Bb on the 12-EDO keyboard. They have to raise<br/>the seventh by 31 cents to get to the new Bb. Then I further train<br/>them to move back down to the 4:7 septimal seventh when I switch back<br/>to C-G-C.</p><p>This latter move is more difficult, since the harmony here does not<br/>force them back down as it forced them up. They have to melodically<br/>*remember* where the septimal seventh was to get back there, since<br/>the 9:16 interval still works in the C-G-C context. So this becomes a<br/>very compact and efficient graduated exercise that you can introduce<br/>a piece at a time. Then we can go to the first exercise mentioned<br/>here, which is almost down to half the interval.</p><p>So now you have a couple of my &quot;trade secrets&quot; (chuckle).</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I received this recent e-mail from composer Lev Zhurbin, who<br/>studied<br/>&gt; at Juilliard.

I ask this because.. well<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; me, even with perfect pitch, I think it&apos;s hard to hear the<br/>&gt; difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between sixth of a tone and 12th of a tone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In Juilliard advanced-harmony class, we learned that flats and<br/>&gt; sharps<br/>&gt; &gt; are just colours, that they are in fact a sort of embellishment.<br/>&gt; And<br/>&gt; &gt; when you do chord progressions, this is plain to see - whether a<br/>&gt; note<br/>&gt; &gt; is a sharp or a flat simply doesn&apos;t matter.  As a result of this,<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; have grown somewhat ambivalent about colors, leaving them more<br/>&gt; &gt; towards the immediate interpretation on stage.  I haven&apos;t yet<br/>grown<br/>&gt; &gt; to the stage where I stop putting in sharps and flats, but I may<br/>&gt; &gt; someday. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;m sticking with my interpretation. juilliard advanced harmony<br/>class<br/>&gt; will teach 12-equal, not 7-equal.</p><p>***Well, regardless, I hope you got composer Lev Zhurbin&apos;s drift:<br/>that microtonality might not have any validity in music if it&apos;s not<br/>taught at a respectable music school or conservatory...</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=36163 href="#36163">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2002 8:24:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ***Well, regardless, I hope you got composer Lev Zhurbin&apos;s drift:<br/>&gt; that microtonality might not have any validity in music if it&apos;s not<br/>&gt; taught at a respectable music school or conservatory...</p><p>If that&apos;s his drift, then he can drift off the edge of the known world for all I care.
