(I have proven it to my own satisfaction but would not<br/>be able to convey that proof in e-mail.) I believe the algorithm I posted is<br/>&quot;Viggo Brun&apos;s subtractive version of the Euclidean Algorithm&quot; from John<br/>Chalmers, and the &quot;inner loop&quot; gives the &quot;semi-convergents as well&quot;.</p><p>To approximate an irrational by a rational, there is no one right answer;<br/>there are infinitely many rationals within any distance of any irrational.<br/>When interpreting an ET scale in terms of JI, while the CF algorithm does<br/>give the best approximants for a given size of numerator &amp; denominator,<br/>musicians might well be interested in what _other_ JI intervals are close by<br/>(at least closer than to the neighboring ET interval) as well.

Anyway, I wouldn&apos;t use any of these methods for interpreting<br/>an ET scale in terms of JI. Instead, I&apos;d find the approximations to all the<br/>consonances within a given odd limit, making sure they are consistent with<br/>one another, and then proceed to combine them, often producing many JI<br/>ratios for the same ET degree. For example, 81/64 is 10 steps in 31-tET,<br/>even though it&apos;s closer to 11 steps, since 81/64 is always the result of<br/>combining simpler intervals (such as 4 fifths) and never heard on its own. I<br/>doubt 81/64 would show up as a semi-convergent to the 10-step interval in<br/>31-tET. Meanwhile 13/9 does not make sense in 31-tET, since its best<br/>approximation is 16 steps while the best approximation of 13/12 (4 steps)<br/>plus the best approximation of 4/3 (13 steps) is 17 steps.</p><p>Alternately, you say that in a 5-limit harmonic context, 9/8 and 10/9 are<br/>dissonances so their melodic function as diatonic seconds is more important<br/>that their JI representations. Thinking this way (as I usually do) it&apos;s<br/>really only the ET&apos;s approximations to the consonances in a given limit that<br/>are worth looking at, since dissonances function by _not_ being easily<br/>perceived as ratios.</p></div>
