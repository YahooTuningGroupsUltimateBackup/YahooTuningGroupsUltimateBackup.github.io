See below:</p><p>Jack,</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt; ... It&apos;s possible that these forces<br/>&gt; affect the Earth more strongly than gravity as Bill says:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &grave;&grave;OK: Chuck, it is my opinion that *EMF laws* create the<br/>&gt;&gt; *orbitals* the planets ride in, and it is *EMF* that keeps<br/>&gt;&gt; the Earth in its present orbit.</p><p>&gt; ... Do you have any<br/>&gt; ideas how this might be done in the lab, or where it might<br/>&gt; be occurring somewhere in the universe so that we could<br/>&gt; observe it?</p><p>Indeed I do. The rate of decay of the orbits of two massive binary<br/>stars<br/>with a small radius is just such a test. The fact that this decay rate<br/>exactly matches that predicted by the field equations shows that both<br/>the radiation coupling and the propagation speed of the radiation are<br/>governed by the same speed, namely c. If either the speed of gravity or<br/>of gravity radiation were different from this, the rate of decay would<br/>be different.</p><p>However, this is not a &quot;direct&quot; measure of the speed of G. You could<br/>directly measure the speed of gravity radiation with a pair of gravity<br/>wave detectors close enough to the binary pair to detect the gravity<br/>waves. Then you could directly measure both frequency and wavelength.</p><p>If you could then position them close enough to detect the near field<br/>effects, you could also determine the speed of gravity. Most of us<br/>think<br/>they have to be the same anyway, because the field equations say that,<br/>but this would be an empirical way to verify it.</p><p>As to Bill&apos;s opinion about whatever he thinks emf is, and how it is<br/>controlling the planets, let&apos;s take a closer look, since several others<br/>have presented similar ideas. First, Bill apparently went to Charles<br/>Lucy to explain the connection of his &quot;Law&quot; to harmony. The description<br/>used musical notation, starting with the lowest frequency (C1) to<br/>correspond to the radius of Mercury&apos;s orbit, with higher octaves (C2,<br/>C3, etc.) extending out to Pluto&apos;s orbit, plus two fifths above the<br/>tonic (G) to fit the cases that don&apos;t line up.</p><p>Well, all waves, not just standing waves, obey the relation that<br/>frequency times wavelength equals the speed of propagation. This means<br/>that the longest standing wave node (Pluto) should have the lowest<br/>frequency, not the highest. The shortest standing wave node (Mercury)<br/>should have the highest frequency. Since the pattern described has this<br/>exactly backwards, there is absolutely no way this particular pattern<br/>can have anything to do with reality. The fact that Bill did not notice<br/>this perfect backwardness in Lucy&apos;s explanation is consistent with his<br/>thinking that a trade school text from 1950 on elementary electric<br/>circuits contains fundamental laws of physics.</p><p>So, I think what they should have been trying to say, was that Pluto&apos;s<br/>orbit should be considered as C1 and the two planets (Earth and<br/>Neptune)<br/>that did not fit as doublings were thirds above the tonic, rather than<br/>fifths. A third above is the same interval as a fifth below. Otherwise,<br/>the pattern is completely backward. We still have the problem that the<br/>series for the inner planets does not match that for the outer planets.<br/>They are still very much &quot;out of tune&quot; with each other.</p><p>Although this alternative has the lowest frequency properly associated<br/>with the longest wavelength, and vice versa, it brings us to my second<br/>comment on such patterns, namely that if you consider octaves, thirds,<br/>and fifths on the musical scale, you basically have half the notes of a<br/>major scale available for picking and choosing. That&apos;s 32 possible<br/>parameters for nine planets plus the asteroid belt. In this case they<br/>also used two different tonics, one for the inner planets and one for<br/>the outer, effectively doubling the number of possible parameters to<br/>64.</p><p>Unless there is a planet associated with each and every one of these 64<br/>&quot;notes,&quot; it suggests you simply have too many free parameters (more<br/>than<br/>six to one) for a fair test. As we like to tease the theorists, &quot;Given<br/>enough free parameters you can fit any theory to any data.&quot;</p><p>Thirdly, you can certainly fit any pattern of orbits where the<br/>separations between planets continues to increase to the accuracy<br/>cited,<br/>over 20%, if you use the actual mean distances and not the numbers<br/>Bill cites. Even when I add the radii of the Sun and Earth to the<br/>textbook distances, I get other results than he reports. For example,<br/>he<br/>gives the mean distance from the Sun to Mercury as 31.4 million miles.<br/>The book value is 36.0, even without adding the diameters. He says the<br/>Earth&apos;s mean distance is 94.2 million miles, when it is below 94 even<br/>with the diameters added. In other words, his numbers have been fudged<br/>(either up or down as needed) to make them look like they fit when they<br/>really do not.</p><p>Fourthly, even if they come out only a few percent off, which is what<br/>other &quot;harmony&quot; pattern enthusiasts have claimed, this is not<br/>physically<br/>possible for standing waves. If we look at any type of musical<br/>instrument, whether resonating strings or columns of air, we find that<br/>the higher harmonics are very precise multiples of the fundamental<br/>tone.<br/>This is not because musical instruments have been designed this way,<br/>rather, it is difficult to produce a resonant system that does not<br/>follow the pattern. You need a STRONGLY non-linear system for this to<br/>happen, for example, a string or column of air that changes effective<br/>length with frequency. Simple physical systems do not do this.</p><p>This is especially true for electromagnetic waves in vacuum. Any<br/>deviation at all from exact multiples (or fifths or thirds) would<br/>destroy the standing waves. Thus, the fact that the orbits only<br/>approximately make a fit (for two different sets of harmonics), makes<br/>this hypothesis untenable.</p><p>Finally, we have sent spacecraft very close to the Sun and now out to<br/>the edge of the solar system to measure electromagnetic fields in<br/>space.<br/>As impressive as these fields sometimes are, especially at the higher<br/>frequencies, they are nowhere near the scale needed to even perturb<br/>planets in their orbits, let alone hold them there in the absence of<br/>gravity.</p><p>The frequency for a single node fitting between the Sun and Pluto, for<br/>example, is 5.07 x 10^-5 Hz. You would have to wait nearly eleven hours<br/>for a single wavelength to pass at that frequency. To have a field that<br/>could move planets around at that distance, we would see a huge, very<br/>nearly DC electric field on the surface of the Earth that would reverse<br/>directions every five and half hours. We simply do not see that at<br/>Pluto&apos;s frequency, nor at 16.6 minutes, the period of Earth&apos;s supposed<br/>standing wave. Of course, if the Earth is on an anti-node, we would<br/>expect to see the 16.6 minute signal away from Earth&apos;s orbit, say on a<br/>Venus probe or recent Mars lander. Again, we simply don&apos;t see such<br/>fields, either on Earth or anywhere in space.</p><p>Chuck</p><p>Bill<br/>Author of Arnold&apos;s Law<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Gary Vezzoli writes, &quot;I would like to point out that .... simply<br/>because a &apos;model&apos; has worked for centuries in an almost precise<br/>prediction of the orbits of the planets, for example, does NOT mean<br/>that the model is a correct picture of nature...the data of Tycho Brahe<br/>and the laws of planetary motion of Kepler indicated that the planet&apos;s<br/>orbits were elipses [sic]...Newton...then employed the gravitational<br/>constant, G...very cleverly employed his equation to calculate the<br/>period of the moon, and obtained about 27 days which compared<br/>excellently with the 28 1/3 days.&quot;</p><p>OK: Gary, Newton was *not* even close!</p><p>OK: Gary, Newton was *wrong* by 1 and 1/3 days by your *own* math!</p><p>OK: Gary, strange that you should bring up the name of Tycho Brahe.<br/>Why not go back to Ptolemy, inasmuch as Ptolemy and Tycho had much more<br/>accurate *data* on planetary and moon *predictions* than Newton with<br/>his faulty &lt;G&gt; concept!</p><p>In my &quot;Bode&apos;s Law Explained&quot; paper of 1979 [see below], I wrote:</p><p>&quot;The problem as seen from the standpoint of most astronomers was not<br/>which theory best explained, but which best *predicted* the future<br/>positions of the orbiting bodies in space.  Astronomers (&apos;namers&apos; of<br/>&apos;stars&apos;) are really pragmatists at heart.  Like the ancient Egyptian<br/>geometers, the men in the fields as the Nile flood receded who surveyed<br/>the land with lengths of rope, astronomers are as &apos;down to earth&apos; in<br/>accuracy when it comes to measuring things in the heavens&quot; [84].<br/>also:<br/>&quot;In 1543 AD Copernicus of Poland used Ptolemy&apos;s data in his now famous<br/>book *De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium* (*On the Revolutions of the<br/>Celestial Orbs*) and presented a revivied, heliocentric, sun-centered,<br/>solar-planetary system (quite neo-Pythagorean).  But most of the book<br/>was in the well-established tradition of astronomical *prediction* and<br/>concerned itself with detailed analysis and tables of planetary<br/>motions&quot; [85].<br/>also:<br/>&quot;In 1577 AD astronomer Tycho Brahe of Denmark tried to do precisely<br/>that.  He used Copernicus&apos; tables (based on Ptolemy&apos;s *Mathmematica*)<br/>but found the planets were not where they were *predicted*.  With<br/>sophisticated, better-calibrated, larger mechanical equipment, money<br/>from the King and armies of assistants and an observatory of his *own*<br/>not far from Hamlet&apos;s famous castle, Tycho, the last of the &quot;naked-eye&quot;<br/>astronomers, for twenty laborious years (1576-1596), created accurate<br/>star catalogs and made extensive measurements of the planets which were<br/>30 times (30X) *more accurate* than Ptolemy&apos;s data.  For example,<br/>without aid of a telescope (the telescope was not *perfected* until<br/>1609 AD by Galileo), Tycho measured the year, the period of the earth<br/>round the sun--to *within one second!*  And because the earth year does<br/>*not* vary more than + or - 40 milliseconds in any one year (see<br/>Whipple, p. 109), this was a *landmark* achievement!&quot; [86].</p><p>OK: Gary, here is the *K-I-C-K-E-R* paragraph of my 1979 paper:<br/>&quot;But the new observational data of Tycho did not support the *perfect*<br/>circles implicit in the sun-centered system of Copernicus.  Tycho, the<br/>astronomer, interested in predicting the planet (particle), rejected<br/>the wave theory of Copernicus and published support of Ptolemy, for<br/>which the data made more sense, in the interest of accuracy--the law of<br/>the astronomer.  Tycho&apos;s data was impeccable although his<br/>solar-planetary theory was not&quot; [86].</p><p>OK: Gary, and Chuck, and all you other *particle* experimenters, take<br/>*S-E-R-I-O-U-S* note that we *R-E-A-D* all you write.  You might, like<br/>Ptolemy and Tycho, be great *experimenters* and yet you also might be<br/>less than great *theorists*!</p><p>OK: Ptolemy and Tycho were great *data* producing men, but admittedly<br/>they were *W-R-O-N-G* on theory.</p><p>OK: Gary, and Chuck, and your bevy of *apologists* ought to take note<br/>that theory is just that, *theory*!  And the one with the best *data*<br/>may *N-O-T* necessarily be the one to *B-E-S-T* explain<br/>*T-H-E-O-R-E-T-I-C-A-L-L-Y* what the *data* describes as a *M-O-D-E-L*!</p><p>OK: in other words, you might be, and I say might, advisedly, you might<br/>be as *wrong* as Ptolemy and Tycho with your *epicycle* views of the<br/>*models* of micro and macro *structures*!  OK, agreed?</p><p>OK: do you *not* understand that *data* does not prove a *theory*?</p><p>OK: do you *not* understand that it is *theory* which justifies the<br/>data, and mutually-exclusive theories, such as a geo-centered system<br/>vs. a solar-centered system are, *cannot* both be correct, or as we say<br/>in science, they *cannot* both be *true and certain!</p><p>OK: Ptolemy and Tycho *pounded the table* and exclaimed that because<br/>their *data* was more accurate, their *theory* was more accurate!</p><p>OK: Ipso facto, it does *not* follow, it does *not* compute!  You must<br/>drop that *logic* because it is *not* logical!  Got it?<br/>----------------------</p><p>Harmonic Voyager writes, &quot;I am interested in understanding what you<br/>are saying in Arnold&apos;s Law. I notice the simplicity of the ratios<br/>and find it quite compelling as a view of an ordered system. Could<br/>you explain to me how the &apos;ideal mean or perimeter&apos; is calculated?<br/>You mention: **means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and<br/>planet.  Perhaps you could derive the 3.14 X10(7th) miles for Mercury<br/>as an example. I realize it may be very easy to see, but &apos;I&apos; can&apos;t<br/>see yet and would like to.&quot;</p><p>OK: Harmonic Voyager, interesting name.  Anyway, the ideal arcs,<br/>column two, are related to Arnold&apos;s law or the ideal arcs as an<br/>expression of pi, column four, the perimeter of a circle [for a<br/>fuller explanation I would have to reproduce several pages from<br/>my 1979 paper--suffice it to say that that can be done]; inasmuch<br/>as the actual calculated *means* become *ideal circles* they are<br/>relatable.  I did not put up the actual *data* given in a standard<br/>encyclopedia by the astronomical community because it is readily<br/>available, but I did publish it in my &quot;Bode&apos;s Law Explained;&quot;<br/>understand that my 1979 paper is ten pages of fine print and quite a<br/>lot to digest all at once and would overwhelm one post.  Here are the<br/>*calculated means* based on astronomical data: in this case column four<br/>is the Calculated Means** [note I have substituted them for Arnold&apos;s<br/>law of Ideal Means, but you ought to see how close the *Ideal* is to<br/>the *Caluclated*; Arnold&apos;s law follows, below--so compare them and<br/>discover as you note the simplicty and order system you spoke to]:</p><p>Arnold&apos;s Law of Ordinal Spacing in Our Solar-Planetary System:</p><p>Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Calculated Means**</p><p>Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.64 X10(7th)miles<br/>Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.77<br/>Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.34<br/>Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____14.21<br/>Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______48.43<br/>Saturn______30__________90______1/4______88.85<br/>Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____178.00<br/>Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____279.15<br/>Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____365.43</p><p>**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet<br/>[These are simple *arithmetic means* of the aphelion and perihelion<br/>data points, added, divided by 2; then the radii of the Sun and the<br/>respective Planet are added so that the *calculated distance* is center<br/>to center; although in my paper I note that astrophysics refers to the<br/>dance of the respective *centers* so that refinements would be needed<br/>down the road, but for our purposes that is not necessary and would not<br/>much alter the data I have given you].<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>Arnold&apos;s Law of Ordinal Spacing in Our Solar-Planetary System:</p><p>Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal or Arnold&apos;s law**<br/>Or Perimeter or Pi Means</p><p>Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99</p><p>*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;</p><p>+<br/> (c) Bill Arnold, &quot;Bode&apos;s Law Explained,&quot; from the Bulletin of the<br/>Foundation For the Study of Cycles, Vol. XXX, No. 4, pages 82-92,<br/>1979.</p><p>OK: Harmonic Voyager, the key sections from my 1979 paper would take me<br/>some time to put in a message, so if you have further questions, ask<br/>away, and I will post some more; my paper began with the history of<br/>astronomy since ancient Egypt, up to the work of Kepler, and one<br/>hundred and fifty years later that of Titius and Bode, which resulted<br/>in the moniker of *Bode&apos;s Law*; then I went into the *math* and showed<br/>how the *astronomical unit* confused the math; converted it all to<br/>what I call the *solar unit* and then explicated the *proportionality*<br/>aspects; the end results you have seen, except for the actual<br/>calculated *ranges* of the planets, aphelion and perihelion points;<br/>the *arithmetic mean* of those two points you see as *calculated<br/>means*!</p><p>Bill<br/>Author of Arnold&apos;s Law</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
