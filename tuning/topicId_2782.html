After playing<br/>blues extensively for over 30 years, I teach the following as &quot;the&quot;<br/>blues scale: C-Eb-F-F#-G-Bb. But, over the years, I have seen it as<br/>C-Eb-F-G-Bb, and C-Eb-E-F-F#-G-Bb, as well as a couple of other<br/>variations. In the July 1981 issue of Guitar Player mag, Howard Roberts<br/>uses the 6 tone blues scale (same as mine), and my teachers John Parsons<br/>and George Keith, monstermonster bop players, also taught it to me as a<br/>6 tone scale. I don&apos;t like the 5 tone, minor pentatonic version, because<br/>without the b5th, the scale feels incomplete. I also don&apos;t like to start<br/>folks off with the more complex version, with the major 3rd, because I<br/>have found that it takes a while to learn to use the maj 3rd<br/>properly...this is totally subjective, but it has worked for me well. As<br/>a matter of fact, I routinely use (in the key of C) the E, D, and A...I<br/>do NOT use, very often, the B, Ab, or Db...yet, when you get into<br/>Parker/bop styled blues, almost anything goes. What works in a John Lee<br/>Hooker style, may not fly in a T Bone Walker style, or whatever. In<br/>fact, there are many many styles of blues, from Chicago to L.A. to Texas<br/>to Mississippi to Piedmont to Kansas City, and there is an incredible<br/>variety of music that calls itself blues...as my teacher George said<br/>once, &quot;Blues is a feeling, and blues can be a set of chord changes.&quot;<br/>Quite true....Charlie Parker told BB King that he was a blues player,<br/>Coltrane played with Cleanhead Vinson, and Ornette Coleman used to walk<br/>the bar, honking his tenor. I saw John Jackson, 70 year old Piedmont<br/>guitar  master, and he played a clean, fingerpicked style, light years<br/>removed from Albert King, master of the bent string...there&apos;s a lot of<br/>blues out there. The bottom line, for me, is when you sit down to play<br/>it, is it the real deal...that also can get real subjective, but when<br/>you hear a great blues player, I think you know...I think I know,<br/>anyway. By the way, the post about a piano blues scale was very hip...<br/>    Also, many great blues tunes do not go to the 4 chord...Spoonful,<br/>Smokestack Lightning, I&apos;m A Man, How Many More Years, Wang Dang Doodle,<br/>I&apos;m Bad, Machine Gun (I think of it as blues), Bo Diddley...I&apos;m sure<br/>there are many more. What a fascinating form of music...Hstick   PS...<br/>Reinhard, I saw in Helmholtz&apos;s book (in the appendices) that Handel had<br/>a 16 tone organ...I don&apos;t know the page offhand, but I relayed this info<br/>to Morrison a while back...</p></div>
