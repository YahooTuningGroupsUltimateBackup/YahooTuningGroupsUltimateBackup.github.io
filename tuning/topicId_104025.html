The function f(x) = 5*x+2 (to be interpreted in modular artihmetics) has the property that it maps the set of intervals that are consonant according to Fuxian counterpoint (i.e. 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9) to its complement in Z12, and, moreover, it is the only affine function on Z12 with that property. Functions and partitions of this kind are the basis for Mazzola&apos;s counterpoint model, which - as often with Mazzola -  consists of a lot of quite weird-looking mathematics, but, interestingly, produces quite accurately the rules of Fuxian first species counterpoint. How relevant this is is open to debate - and also, whether this is comparable to e=mc^2, of course. The magazine, I assume, wanted to squeeze a cartchy title out of it.</p><p>An interesting property of that counterpoint model is that it is applicable to arbitrary n-equal temperaments for even n. I have been planning for a while to try it out, for 22edo, for example - this would be a nice test for the relevance of the formula (if it sounds shitty, this would be a kind of falsification).

In the mathematics of Mazzola&apos;s model, &quot;consonance&quot; in the general meaning of the word is not important at all - all that counts is a special kind of symmetry, as the formula k = 5*d+2 summarizes. You can derive rules with dissonant intervals alone - how that sounds is another question. Well, maybe I should finally start exploring more seriously in that direction...<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
