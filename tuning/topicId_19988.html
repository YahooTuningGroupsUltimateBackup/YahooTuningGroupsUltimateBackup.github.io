It&apos;s a six note subset<br/>of the octony, and usually one thinks of a scale with fewer<br/>notes as easier to use somehow.</p><p>Here are some first thoughts towards trying to understand.</p><p>The hexany has plenty of pure triads. But it seems to be<br/>rather lacking in the slightly dissonant chords, only having<br/>ones that are very dissonant, leading to a kind of atonal<br/>music.</p><p>Maybe its dissonant chords could be used more easily if there<br/>were more in the way of middle ground to get from one<br/>to the other.</p><p>To use a rather vague term - it is lacking in &quot;softly dissonant&quot;<br/>chords.</p><p>It also has extremely uneven steps. That by itself is okay,<br/>works for the octony, but the way they are distributed is<br/>also extremely awkward under the hands somehow. At least,<br/>that&apos;s my experience with it.</p><p>Maybe one could make a first step towards a method to measure<br/>the ease of use for a scale by looking for the number of<br/>mildly, somehwat dissonant chords, the number of wonderfully<br/>consonant chords, and the number of ones that are extremely<br/>dissonant.</p><p>Perhaps one could also make a similar measure of awkwardness<br/>/ ease of melodic movement.</p><p>If one did that, it&apos;s perfectly possible that the SCALA 7-limit<br/>19-tone scale might turn out to be a much better scale for<br/>actual composition than some of the ones with beautiful<br/>lattices. One doesn&apos;t know, would have to find out.</p><p>I like musical lattices as a type of musical geometry, and<br/>I wonder if perhaps Monz&apos;s idea of a composition tool based<br/>on lattices may be the way for compoesre to use the rich harmonic<br/>resources of them.</p><p>Somehow, when one sees the scale as a linear series of notes,<br/>one can&apos;t easily find all those consonant triads, or understand<br/>well how they interact with each other.</p><p>Maybe they are best explored with some 3D display of the<br/>scale. Or, maybe some composers can (or will be able to)<br/>naturally see a scale that way and work with it without<br/>3D aids, but others might still need them.</p><p>Maybe also one needs a way to find the chords with slightly<br/>detuned j.i. intervals on the lattice, as they too seem<br/>to contribute to the harmonic richness of a scale.</p><p>Here is another thought about what could be missing<br/>in some of the lattices (not all I hasten to add).</p><p>Perhaps they lack a certain linearity (to coin a word). For<br/>example in the diatonic scale, if you play the chord<br/>with steps 2 2 2, you get a major or minor triad,<br/>wherever you place your hand.</p><p>In the hexany, there is no such simple way to find the<br/>consonant triads.</p><p>Maybe a search for slightly dissonant / detuned chords, and<br/>for linearity, could help lattice constructors to come up<br/>with scales that both have plenty of consonant triads,<br/>and also are easy to use as a scale structure.</p><p>Then maybe also, with methods like Monz&apos;s Just Music,<br/>tools may be developed to help composers tackle more<br/>easily some of the highly symmetrical lattices that<br/>lack linearity, or have fewer, or harder to locate,<br/>detuned dissonances.</p><p>Just a few things to think about,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/9/2001 8:51:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19988">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/19988</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are a few thoughts following on from your discussion with<br/>&gt; Dan Stearns.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think there are good or bad scales, but I think there<br/>&gt; are ones that are easy or more tricky to write in.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks so much, Robert, for your commentary, and you seem to be at<br/>least partially advocating the value of investigating scales<br/>according to certain properties as, possibly, a &quot;pre-compositional&quot;<br/>method.</p><p>I wonder what Joe Monzo would say in this regard...

I really do wish I&apos;d heed<br/>Brian McLaren&apos;s (admittedly quite abrasive) frequent<br/>exhortations to &quot;stop wasting so much valuable composition<br/>time on theory&quot;.  My productivity has indeed dropped off<br/>quite drastically over the last few years, as I&apos;ve become<br/>more and more interested in theoretical research.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve stated here, before, the whole background on<br/>my lattices and approach to theory.  But I&apos;ll do it again,<br/>hopefully in a way that will try to specifically answer<br/>your question.</p><p>The whole reason I started diagramming tuning systems on<br/>lattices was simply to compare different ones.</p><p>I found while reading Partch&apos;s book that I had a lot of<br/>difficulty internalizing the &quot;essence&quot; of a tuning from a<br/>list of ratios.</p><p>It was much easier for me to understand these scales by<br/>reducing all the harmonic relationships to their &quot;lowest<br/>common denominator&quot; (quite literally) and graphing them.</p><p>Now, why would it be important to compare different tunings?</p><p>For me, here&apos;s the quick answer:</p><p>I don&apos;t have &quot;absolute (A.K.A. perfect) pitch&quot;, but do have<br/>very good &quot;relative pitch&quot;.</p><p>I had gone thru a heavy musical training which enabled me to<br/>&quot;see&quot; the music I composed in my mind as it would appear in<br/>score, so that I could easily write it down without having to<br/>play it on an instrument (most likely, a piano) first.  I was<br/>able to sit in the park or on the subway and notate the music<br/>in my head.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m talking about 12-tET tuning here.</p><p>Then, when I learned about microtonality, I quite rapidly<br/>became mentally overwhelmed by the vast universe of new pitches<br/>that I realized were available.</p><p>As I became more and more familiar with the sound of rational<br/>tunings, the dilemma which unfolded was that now I could no<br/>longer &quot;see&quot; in my mind the music I could &quot;hear&quot; in my mind.</p><p>My home-grown solution to that was a new personal ear-training<br/>course.  But the key to understanding the differences between<br/>all those small intervals that were audibly more-or-less similar,<br/>was to see *on a lattice diagram* how their mathematics differed.</p><p>Of course, the regulars on this list know that as I&apos;ve dug<br/>more and more deeply into historical tunings, I&apos;ve quite lost<br/>the ability to climb out of that hole by now...</p><p>But my goal 15 years ago was, and today still is, to grasp enough<br/>of the variety in these various tuning schemes that I will<br/>eventually be able to sit down with pen and paper (and nothing<br/>else) and compose that great microtonal opera that&apos;s swimming<br/>around in my brain.</p><p>Along the way, I&apos;d have to say that, yes, a diagram of a tuning<br/>does often suggest ways of manipulating pitches that I probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t have thought of otherwise.  (A good example of this<br/>is the meditative middle section of _A Noiseless Patient Spider_,<br/>where I sort of hop-scotch around a 5-limit lattice.)</p><p>But there&apos;s also a bit of a difference between hearing a piece<br/>unfold silently, entirely in one&apos;s mind, and composing by<br/>actually playing an instrument, which is really more a form<br/>of improvisation.</p><p>I&apos;m not knocking either approach - I use both; more often the<br/>latter.  I&apos;d have to say that the combination of my imagination<br/>and my ears provides most of the stimulus in composing a new<br/>piece.</p><p>If I do spend time studying the lattice of a tuning, then<br/>certainly it does have *some* influence on the piece which<br/>results.  But it&apos;s usually a kind of slow &quot;osmosis&quot; effect<br/>which comes out in the final act of composition in a more<br/>subliminal way.  It&apos;s less often that I actually use a lattice<br/>in a direct sort of way, as I did in _Spider_.</p><p>Hope that helps shed some light on your query.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/10/2001 7:42:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., MONZ@J... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20030">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20030</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I do spend time studying the lattice of a tuning, then<br/>&gt; certainly it does have *some* influence on the piece which<br/>&gt; results.

I felt like I<br/>&gt; &gt; was driving a car<br/>&gt; &gt; with the steering wheel stuck turned all the way one way, just going around in<br/>&gt; &gt; endless circles<br/>&gt; &gt; getting no where harmonically or melodically.  I figured if I couldn&apos;t get used<br/>&gt; &gt; to the simplest of<br/>&gt; &gt; hexanies than x-anies in general were not for me.  Maybe I&apos;ll try an octany or<br/>&gt; &gt; dekany sometime.<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the heads up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,. Exactly my experience with it too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder how many others get put off x-anies in the same way!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps one should add a note when describing the hexany to the effect that<br/>&gt; though a small scale, it is pretty tricky to use in music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure it will be worth it if one does manage to write something in it, but<br/>&gt; I think that would be a later stage, rather than the first one to try, as one<br/>&gt; would expect. I think when one does master the hexany eventually, it may well<br/>&gt; be rather rewarding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From my experience, the octony does seem a pretty good one to begin with, and<br/>&gt; wonder what other lattices people have tried and found easy ones, to recommend<br/>&gt; to those who are attempting them for the first time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone on the TL got good recommendations for geometrical musical lattices that are<br/>&gt; especially welcoming to write music in? Or maybe that<br/>&gt; should be a kind of newbies question (i.e. newbie to composing using lattices)<br/>&gt; - what are good lattices to try, to get into the way of using them in music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>David J.

It&apos;s just that it can sometimes take a lot of<br/>stumbling from tuning to tuning to find something you know will be worth pursuing, in terms of your own<br/>musical tastes and goals.  There really is no such thing as a good or bad tuning, considered in<br/>isolation.  If your music requires simple, precise consonances, then JI is good, low number ET is bad.<br/>If you need smooth melodic motion, Myhill&apos;s property is good, JI is most likely not so good.  The<br/>eikosany is well suited for those who value permanent weightlessness but maybe not for those who prefer<br/>to feel our feet planted firmly on the ground at certain points.</p><p>The main benefit I got out of exploring x-anies was that it lead me &quot;accidentally&quot; to the discovery of<br/>Wilson&apos;s Horagrams of the Scale Tree.  :-)  It was love at first hearing.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
