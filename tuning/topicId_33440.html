Counting lines or spaces between notes might have<br/>encouraged a focus on general interval categories, with either a<br/>ditone (F-A) or a semiditone (E-G) at a visual distance of three<br/>inclusive steps.</p><p>Now for the reference to the &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;imperfect&quot; thirds of some<br/>late medieval theory: the ditone or larger regular third is &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>because it seeks expansion to the fifth, in 14th-century terms, while<br/>the smaller third is &quot;imperfect&quot; because it tends to contract to a<br/>unison. Thus according to Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1425-1440), one<br/>&quot;perfects&quot; a naturally minor third before a fifth by making it major<br/>(to use the modern categories), or &quot;colors&quot; a naturally major third<br/>before a unison by making it minor (e.g. E-G# before D-A; C-Eb before<br/>a unison on D).</p><p>The categories of _tertia_ or  &quot;third&quot; here are &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>vs. &quot;imperfect,&quot; synonymous with the later major and minor.</p><p>Around 1325, Jacobus of Liege speaks of _una tertia in semiditono_ or<br/>&quot;a third in the semiditone [form],&quot; which tends to resolve to the<br/>unison; and _una tertia in ditono_ or &quot;a third in the ditone [form},&quot;<br/>seeking expansion to the fifth.</p><p>Interesting, Jacobus recognizes in theory three varieties of tone,<br/>although regarding only the regular _tonus_ (9:8) as used in<br/>practice. The _tonus maior_ or &quot;major tone&quot; consists of two major<br/>semitones or apotomes at 2187:2048 (~113.69 cents), giving us an<br/>interval at around 227.37 cents (smaller than 8:7 by a 3-7 schisma of<br/>about 3.80 cents). The _tonus minor_ consists of two limmas or minor<br/>semitones, the usual 256:243 semitones (~90.22 cents), giving us an<br/>interval of about 180.45 cents (smaller than 10:9 by the 3-5 schisma<br/>of about 1.95 cents).</p><p>Jacobus demonstrates, for example, that the _tonus maior_ is larger<br/>than 9:8 but smaller than 8:7.</p><p>Anyway, the increasing use in medieval literature of informal Latin<br/>terms like _tertia_ for both varieties of thirds might be linked both<br/>to the popularization of basic theory (for example, in introductions<br/>to discant or polyphony), where terms like _quarta_ and _quinta_ are<br/>also used as alternatives to the Greek _diatessaron_ and _diapente_<br/>(since the Greek terms mean &quot;through four&quot; and &quot;through five,&quot; this is<br/>closer to a translation than to a different naming system, as with<br/>_tertia_ as a category including both _ditonus_ and _semiditonus_).</p><p>A brief remark on the 18:17:16 division of the 9:8 tone. Boethius uses<br/>it not as an illustration of what prevails in practice (he takes the<br/>Pythagorean division into 256:243 and 2187:2048 as the norm), but a<br/>theoretical example to show the impossibility of dividing a<br/>superparticular ratio such as 9:8 into two equal parts (i.e. a<br/>geometric division) -- using integer ratios, that is, we might add.</p><p>The 18:17:16 division gets mentioned in Marchettus of Padua (1318) as<br/>one possible division, and in 1373 is recommended as a way to add<br/>semitones to an organ when one has arranged a basic Pythagorean<br/>diatonic scale in the usual fashion: take the average of the lengths<br/>of two pipes a 9:8 tone apart, and use this as the length for the pipe<br/>adding an accidental between them.</p><p>I hope that this addresses some of the points in question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=33451 href="#33451">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2002 4:21:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo!,</p><p>It&apos;s been a while since I got a chance to address you!</p><p>&gt; From: M.

Aside to Jon Wild: the distinction you report in Aristoxenos between<br/>the simple and composite use of an interval such as the ditone or major<br/>third very much reminds me of the Vicentino-Lusitano controversy (does any<br/>use of a melodic minor or major third represent an element of the<br/>chromatic or enharmonic genus, so that almost all music is actually<br/>&quot;mixed&quot; rather than diatonic?). Here Lusitano and later Zarlino took the<br/>position you report, arguing that the chromatic semitone and enharmonic<br/>diesis are characteristic of these genera, while major and minor thirds<br/>are also routine as composite intervals in the diatonic.</p></div>
