Since accidentals<br/>&gt;are multiplicative, that means they will also<br/>&gt;accumulate at a steady rate.</p><p>It strikes me that there&apos;s an ongoing argument among the ET crowd against JI because of its limitations. You can&apos;t get too far away from the tonic. 1/1 exerts gravity. Accidentals accumulate, and become too cumbersome. You can&apos;t transpose just anywhere you want to. The notation is erratic and inconsistent. The fractions get too big too fast. Consonance is a ubiquitous temptation. And the ET people want to help us poor, benighted JI people into a better, ET world where we can leave all these limitations behind.</p><p>But some composers think limitations are a good thing - a great thing, in fact. Igor Stravinsky said that, if he felt he could write anything he wanted, he&apos;d be too paralyzed to put a note on paper; he couldn&apos;t compose without limitations. I love JI for exactly that: its limitations, its challenges and difficult choices, its gravity and fences. And every time an ET advocate urges me to come to ET land where I can get away from all these limitations, I get a shiver as if he&apos;s threatening to steal something precious from me. If the ET people are content in their vast, uniform, limitation-less desert, zipping anywhere they want without barriers, I&apos;m very happy for them and think they should stay there. But I&apos;ll remain in my verdant JI forest with plenty of trees and rocks to bump into.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said before, to each his own.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=41733 href="#41733">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2003 6:53:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;And every time an ET advocate urges me to come to ET land<br/>&gt; where I can get away from all these limitations, I get a shiver as if<br/>&gt; he&apos;s threatening to steal something precious from me.</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t play that game.
