If you really want to play<br/>mathematical tricks, you could try using a complex function to choose<br/>notes, and take the real part as key velocity and the imaginary part as<br/>pitch.  That&apos;s fairly harmless, could even be productive.</p><p>             Graham</p><p>****Good thinking Graham!</p><p>Using this as a notation we can manipulate scored music, I had plans<br/>for manipulateing pitch: INPUT-----&gt;formula-----&gt;OUTPUT, and this could be done<br/>with (x, y)=Both Real, (x, y)=Both imaginary, (x, y)=real and imaginary,<br/>and, naturally<br/>the same can be done for volume.</p><p>This is how mountains are moved, civilisations are formed!</p><p>Sarn &quot;Polyverse Philosopher&quot; Ursell.</p></div>
