Its harmonies will be finely controlled by partial frets. Two parallel lines of fractional frets make a separation of about 2 millimeters at the first fret and 1 millimiter at the 19th. These fret separations don&acute;t cause any dificult to the correct finger chord positions as it happened with the Piagui I, II and III.</p><p>The Piagui IV guitar is an improvement of the harmony showed by the three mentioned Piagui scales.</p><p>Ask more information on how were derived its twelve tone frequencies which are going to be used in the piano tuning as well.</p><p>Mario.</p></div>
