No decimal numbers. I didn&acute;t insist on consecutive pure fifths. The way I wrote the attached file is the way you want me to write I think. Besides, the new &quot;addend&quot; method for constructing a good scale is a very interesting and new way for solving similar cases. I say that it was possible to use this method thanks to the progression of musical cells.</p><p>Brad,<br/>This time there are no calculations.<br/>Interesting attached information.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Mario<br/>Lima, November 12</p></div>
