My<br/>suspicion is that he might have meant either his first tuning in 31-note<br/>meantone (close to 31-tone equal temperament or 31-tet), with the 5<br/>remaining notes of the instrument tuned to provide a few pure fifiths<br/>(adaptive just intonation) or his second tuning with the first 19 notes in<br/>meantone, and the other 17 tuned in pure fifths with these.</p><p>Clearly Vicentino intended singers especially to rely on his<br/>instrument in his first tuning, because intervals a diesis (about<br/>1/5-tone) smaller or larger than the usual ones (e.g. a &quot;proximate<br/>minor third&quot; enlarged by a diesis, ~11:9) would be unfamiliar. Writing<br/>about 25 years later, Vincenzo Galilei reports that singers indeed<br/>relied upon the archicembalo for their tunings of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>enharmonic music; while Galilei is not a favorable critic, this part<br/>of his report would fit Vicentino&apos;s own advocacy of the instrument as<br/>a standard of intonation.</p><p>However, Vicentino might also have intended singers to emulate his<br/>second tuning, the &quot;adaptive 5-limit tuning&quot; in which pure fifths (and<br/>minor thirds) may be substituted for tempered ones.</p><p>Incidentally, Vicentino did design two different keyboard instruments,<br/>apparently both sharing the same two alternative 36-note tunings: the<br/>archicembalo or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; and the arciorgano or &quot;superorgan,&quot;<br/>the latter a kind of portable organ which could be transposed on the<br/>back of a mule and assembled at the destination. While a &quot;portative&quot;<br/>organ was a smaller instrument carried by the player, the category of<br/>a &quot;positive&quot; organ might fit this instrument.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
