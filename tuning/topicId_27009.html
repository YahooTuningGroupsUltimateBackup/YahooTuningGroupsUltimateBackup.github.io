I not only<br/>specified, but even had patented the system &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;. This was<br/>feasible because the German patent authorities recognized an underlying<br/>technological progress!</p><p>But please consider: Why did Kuhnau pose a riddle on Gematria (=Bach&apos;s<br/>Gematria/Dieben) in the preface to his Biblische Historien Sonaten??<br/>Why did Bach produce R&iuml;&iquest;&half;tselkanons? Quaerendo invenietis??<br/>Apparently, posing enigmas was an intellectual &quot;sport&quot; in the Baroque<br/>epoch and challenging the others.</p><p>To find the suitable temperament replacing Mean-tone was in this domain<br/>and context the actual, THE BURNING problem. Bach didn&apos;t even state<br/>that there was a riddle hidden and the problem of the sheer existence<br/>of that riddle had to be solved beforehand.</p><p>Had you read all of Werckmeister, you would recognize the wealth of<br/>spirituality, of musico-theological nature. Essentially on tri-unitary<br/>symbolism of musical triads. All this entered as fervently glowing<br/>Christian creed and spirituality entered via &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; into all<br/>of Bach&apos;s music, notwithstanding that it required a good deal of rational<br/>mathematics.<br/>Bach&apos;s essentially symmetrical signet (=UNITAS) is crowned by a<br/>trefle (=TRINITAS).</p><p>There was obviously<br/>&gt; a lot happening in the tuning field at that time in Germany, and Bach<br/>&gt; was, surely, a Maestro on the subject.
