I&apos;ve added a little bit to<br/>it but the core idea is his, so props to him. He gave me permission to<br/>post it because I fear that someone&apos;s about to post some Unfortunate<br/>Tuning List Error Flamebait soon, and I think his idea provides a very<br/>elegant solution to the problem of how to bound a temperament&apos;s valid<br/>range.</p><p>The basic idea: harmony can get pretty out there. We&apos;ve been exploring<br/>exotemperaments a lot lately, which are recognizable if you try. We&apos;ve<br/>also been exploring things like mavila a lot over at the XA Facebook<br/>group, as well as some unconventional meantones like 17 and 26-equal.<br/>But all of the generator sizes for EVERY temperament that we&apos;ve been<br/>exploring - as well as any that has ever been used, in existence, ever<br/>- will always still obey one important rule: they always ensure that,<br/>in the mapping, 4/3 &gt;= 5/4 and 5/4 &gt;= 6/5. This is to say that, in<br/>Bosanquet&apos;s terminology, 16/15 and 25/24 are always positive and never<br/>reversed. Always, or else you&apos;ve mangled the raw structure of 5-limit<br/>harmony so much that the utonal inverse and inversions of the major<br/>triad will now get all out of whack relative to themselves, which is a<br/>simple fact regardless of any personal tolerance for tuning error.</p><p>Think about it - if 25/24 is ever negative, then that would mean that<br/>your mapping for 10:12:15 actually has what you&apos;re calling 6/5 larger<br/>than what you&apos;re calling 5/4. Therefore, 10:12:15 will now have the<br/>major third on the bottom and 4:5:6 has the minor third on the bottom.<br/>So if 25/24 ever flips around, you can bet that the inverse will sound<br/>more like an actual 4:5:6 than the mapping for 4:5:6 itself, no matter<br/>how poorly things are tuned. If you can&apos;t at least make major thirds<br/>bigger than minor thirds, then even if you pretend there are no 7 or<br/>11-limit identities you&apos;ve still completely ruined bare 5-limit<br/>harmony relative to itself. Flipping around 16/15 is even worse - it<br/>means that what you&apos;re calling 4/3 is now smaller than what you&apos;re<br/>calling 5/4. So if both 25/24 and 16/15 are reversed, then what you&apos;re<br/>calling 4:5:6 is actually going to be 3:4:5, which is ridiculous.</p><p>If you do this, the border for each temperament will be the EDO at one<br/>extreme where 16/15 vanishes, and the EDO at the other extreme where<br/>25/24 vanishes.</p><p>This leads to the following results, copied from John&apos;s post</p><p>&gt; Syntonic=81/80=7-edo to 5-edo<br/>&gt; Pelogic=135/128 = 2-edo to 7-edo<br/>&gt; Porcupine=250/243= 8-edo to 7-edo<br/>&gt; Magic=3125/3072= 10-edo to 3-edo<br/>&gt; Hanson=15625/15552= 4-edo to 11-edo</p><p>For those new to the list and unfamiliar, the terms &quot;Syntonic&quot; and<br/>&quot;Pelogic&quot; are alternate names for meantone and mavila, respectively.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99945 href="#99945">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 12:18:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, to add - this assumes that, in some sense, 25/24 and 16/15 are<br/>fundamental 5-limit intervals that must always remain positive (or<br/>perhaps vanish), but never disappear, or else the fundamental<br/>structure of 5-limit harmony gets all messed up. This makes intuitive<br/>sense, but to formalize it more rigorously, I thought a good way to<br/>approach it would be to preserve the ordering of the entire n-limit<br/>tonality diamond, which gives you a way to extend this to higher<br/>limits too (and subgroups, if you&apos;re clever).

Maybe.</p><p>As an unexpected bonus, if you&apos;re clever you&apos;ve noticed that these ET<br/>bounds also implicitly assign each temperament a &quot;mandatory MOS&quot; -<br/>since Meantone runs from 5 EDO-7 EDO, it must produce a 5L2s MOS, if<br/>Mavila runs from 2-EDO to 7-EDO, it must produce a 2L5s MOS, if Magic<br/>runs from 3-EDO to 10-EDO it must produce a 3L7s MOS, etc. This is a<br/>bonus because the goal of this isn&apos;t to rehash the discussion on how<br/>to tie together MOS&apos;s and temperaments, but this approach gives you a<br/>starting point for that anyway.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS - let&apos;s for the moment ignore the issue of tempered octaves now to<br/>keep things simple; I&apos;m not sure how to define the target criteria if<br/>octaves are tempered just yet.</p><p>On Sun, Jun 12, 2011 at 2:54 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Props to John Moriarty for coming up with this - this is a great idea<br/>&gt; and I&apos;ve never heard this suggested before.

As before, this choice somewhat arbitrary. But these intervals seem a reasonable choice - they are the only intervals designated consonances in common practice and they are only intervals found in the only triads designated consonant in common practice (major and minor triads).</p><p>For higher prime limits, this generalises, in the most obvious way, to the intervals found in 4:5:6:7, or 8:10:11:12:14, etc., or building things up in odd-limits - which is Partch&apos;s tonality diamond.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it simply because we use 4:5:6 as the fundamental harmonic unit, and it&apos;s identity will flip to 1/4:1/5:1/6 when 25/24 or 16/15 is reversed?</p><p>Not too sure what you mean here</p><p>&gt; If so, the use of another triad as &quot;fundamental&quot; would call for a whole new VTR, as you say would be the case for selecting new privileged intervals in your paper.</p><p>Yes, the Bohlen-Pierce system, for example, privileges the intervals in 3:5:7 and so implies a different VTR. As would a system that privileges any other subset of primes, or any other set of intervals.</p><p>Similarly, the VTR of an MOS scale can be defined by privileging the large step and the small step - so its boundary tunings occur when the small step hits zero size, and the small step and large step become equal size.</p><p>&gt; But might it have something to do with retaining an intelligible harmonic series derived from the mapping and tuning, or some other method that would not call for a variation in VTR regardless of your harmonic intent?</p><p>Is it any more possible to define a non-arbitrary set of privileged partials than it is musical ratios? Psychoacoustics would indicate that partials above about 10 are not resolvable, so should all ratios of integers up to about 10 be included - that would suggest we need to ensure the tempered 9/8&gt;10/9, hence all meantone tunings are boundary tunings, which seems a bit extreme?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though I&apos;ve already found it very useful to draw the lines for these temperaments where picking those privileged intervals has, I&apos;d like to figure out why that might be the case.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If a piece of music is made up of consonant harmonies, and the melody is made up voices that connect together these harmonies, the change in melodic direction caused by going beyond the VTR represents an easily noticeable change that will probably break its perceived identity.</p><p>Andy</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; John M<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=100002 href="#100002">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2011 12:41:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>just wanted to note that I think that the answer to your youtube tuning mystery is &quot;16&quot;</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, Jun 12, 2011 at 8:50 PM, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you&apos;ll also want to compare the tempered ratios to the adjacent<br/>&gt; &gt; just ratios.

If you want to be even stricter you<br/>&gt; &gt; could set a limit half way between the just ratios, in which case the<br/>&gt; &gt; only valid tuning for father would be 442.179 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure, because exotemperaments can really screw with your<br/>&gt; perception sometimes. Take hedgehog, for example - try the LLsLLLsL<br/>&gt; mode in 22-equal. I&apos;ll be damned if that LLsL doesn&apos;t sound like the<br/>&gt; same LLsL in the beginning of the major scale, just really flat. If<br/>&gt; you actually manage to hear it that way, then inasfar as the outer<br/>&gt; dyad is supposed to represent 3/2, it sounds like you&apos;ve tempered out<br/>&gt; 9/8.

I&apos;ve been talking about the whole &quot;retaining an intelligible harmonic series&apos; thing with a vague idea of why I thought it would work, but only recently have I gotten into the math and some things didn&apos;t work out like I thought they would.
