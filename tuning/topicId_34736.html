Kirnberger eliminates the syntonic comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; monz, *all* of them eliminate the syntonic comma, and *all* of them<br/>&gt; eliminate the pythagorean comma.</p><p>somehow i just knew that you were going to take that the wrong<br/>way, and i almost reworded it and am now sorry i didn&apos;t.</p><p>what i meant is that the  t u n i n g  procedure of Kirnberger III<br/>flattens a few of the 5ths by a fraction of the  s y n t o n i c<br/>comma, whereas the vast majority of other well-temperaments<br/>flattens the 5ths by a fraction of the Pythagorean comma.</p><p>&gt; &gt; paul, this has something to do with the confusion over<br/>&gt; &gt; exactly what i mean by a xenharmonic bridge.  in the case<br/>&gt; &gt; of Kirnberger III as i&apos;m describing here, the schisma is<br/>&gt; &gt; d e f i n i t e l y   a  xenaharmonic bridge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, it&apos;s a unison vector in *any* well temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it forms<br/>&gt; &gt; a bridge between different parts of the lattice without<br/>&gt; &gt; any artificial human construction; the latter is the case<br/>&gt; &gt; with meantones and other temperaments where a perceptible<br/>&gt; &gt; interval as large as a comma or diesis is tempered out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok, so it&apos;s a special instance of a unison vector, where its<br/>&gt; constituent intervals are all just (yet another putative definition<br/>&gt; of xenharmonic bridge). but this only happens in one place in<br/>&gt; kirnberger iii. functionally, there are lots of other schismas<br/>&gt; vanishing, in this and all other well temperaments.</p><p>right, i understand that.  that&apos;s part of my own explanation<br/>of Kirnberger III.  see below.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this audibly-identical equivalence of the chromatic notes in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a well-temperament is quite different from the implied ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the tempered notes (which in Kirnberger III are all &quot;white<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key&quot; notes),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where are you getting that from?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s how Kirnberger III works: in &quot;8ve&quot;-equivalent terms,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if C = n^0,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; aha! *that&apos;s* the key assumption you have to make. but isn&apos;t it just<br/>&gt; as valid to use G, or any other pitch as the &apos;center&apos;?</p><p>ok, paul, i see now that we weren&apos;t on the same wavelength here.</p><p>with this business about diatonic/white-key and chromatic/black-key,<br/>i&apos;m not talking about C as a key center, i&apos;m simply assuming the<br/>traditional method of tuning a piano in Kirnberger III.</p><p>The tuner starts by tuning C, then the four tempered 5ths/4ths<br/>which result in the major 3rd C:E = 5:4, then a series of 4:3s<br/>and 3:2s from C to Db, then finally from E up a 3:2 to B then<br/>down a 4:3 to F#.</p><p>the Db is only a schisma wider than a 3:2 C# above F#, and<br/>assuming a tuning resolution by the human tuner no greater<br/>than ~2 cents, the Db and C#  a r e  the same, and the cycle<br/>is closed at 12 tones.</p><p>&gt; From: paulerlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, February 22, 2002 3:04 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Werckmeister etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&apos;s how Kirnberger III works: in &quot;8ve&quot;-equivalent terms,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if C = n^0,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [paul]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; aha! *that&apos;s* the key assumption you have to make. but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&apos;t it just as valid to use G, or any other pitch as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &apos;center&apos;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Johnny Reinhard]<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, it not musically valid to shift the starting pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; for a well tempered tuning.  Changing the starting note for<br/>&gt; &gt; a tuning completely disregards the composer&apos;s choice of<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals (as each key is different).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [paul]<br/>&gt; johnny, you&apos;re completely misinterpreting me. i&apos;m *not* talking about<br/>&gt; transposing werckmeister up a fifth, or anything like that. with what<br/>&gt; i&apos;m suggesting, the intervals between any pair of pitches would<br/>&gt; remain the same. all the pitches remain the same. the structure of<br/>&gt; the tuning, and the sound of the music, remains unchanged. it&apos;s just<br/>&gt; that monz is pinning the 1/1 ratio on c, and drawing far reaching<br/>&gt; conclusions from that, which i&apos;m arguing don&apos;t have much meaning.</p><p>but as johnny says, paul, my approach here is the valid one<br/>for well-temperament.  i&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re suggesting,<br/>because composers who used well-temperaments expected each key<br/>to sound a certain way, and that only works if the tuning has<br/>a well-defined  a b s o l u t e  structure.</p><p>it&apos;s not the same as with meantone, where the generator is<br/>always the same and a linear chain results.  well-temperaments<br/>are irregular, and in Kirnberger III the keys only have the<br/>effect that composers expected them to have if you tune it<br/>the way i described, with specific intervals associated with<br/>each letter-name and/or letter-name plus # or b.</p><p>well-temperaments have a rich variety of specific sizes<br/>for generic interval-classes.  For example, Kirnberger III has :</p><p>Minor 3rds<br/>----------</p><p>~cents  [3 5] vector  instances</p><p>  310    [ 0 -3/4]    E:G, A:C<br/>  305    [-1 -1/2]    D:F, B:D<br/>  300    [-2 -1/4]    F#:A, G:Bb<br/>  296    [ 5  1  ]    Db:E, Eb:F#, Ab:B<br/>  294    [-3  0  ]    C:Eb, F:Ab, Bb:Db</p><p>because of the irrelevance of the skhisma, the 296-cent interval,<br/>[5 1], which is the JI ratio 1215:1024, can be interpreted as<br/>several different instances of the Pythagorean minor 3rd 32:27<br/>= [-3 0] = ~294 cents, as follows:</p><p>Db:E  = ~C#:E,, Db:~Fb<br/>Eb:F# = ~D#:F#, Eb:~Gb<br/>Ab:B  = ~G#:B, Ab:~Cb</p><p>note that the intervals F#:A and G:Bb are basically identical<br/>to the 12edo minor 3rds.</p><p>we can see that there&apos;s an even richer variety of major 3rds:</p><p>Major 3rds<br/>----------</p><p>~cents  [3 5] vector  instances</p><p>  408    [ 4  0  ]    Db:F, Ab:C<br/>  406    [-4 -1  ]    E:Ab, F#:Bb, B:Eb<br/>  402    [ 3  1/4]    Eb:G<br/>  400    [-5 -3/4]    A:Db<br/>  397    [ 2  1/2]    D:F#, Bb:D<br/>  392    [ 1  3/4]    F:A, G:B<br/>  386    [ 0  1  ]    C:E</p><p>because of the irrelevance of the skhisma, the 406-cent interval,<br/>[-4 -1], which is the JI ratio 512:405, can be interpreted as<br/>several different instances of the Pythagorean major 3rd 81:64<br/>= [4 0] = ~408 cents, as follows:</p><p>E:Ab  = E:~G#, ~Fb:Ab<br/>F#:Bb = F#:~A#, ~Gb:Bb<br/>B:Eb  = B:~D#, ~Cb:Eb</p><p>note that the interval A:Db is basically identical to the<br/>12edo major 3rd.  also note that in the case of the major 3rd,<br/>there are also intervals which are only +2 and -3 cents different<br/>from this one: Eb:G and (D:F#, Bb:D) respectively.  i would<br/>say that all of this would automatically be equivalent as well,<br/>because they are also near the limit of tuning resolution.</p><p>so, equivalences come into play depending on which note<br/>you pick as a key center, but the template for tuning<br/>Kirnberger III doesn&apos;t change, so the true interval<br/>relationships   b e t w e e n   n a m e d   n o t e s<br/>will always be as i describe here (plus or minus a few<br/>cents due to limits of human tuning resolution).</p><p>the fact that the size of the skhisma, as well as the<br/>other very small differences which arise in connection with<br/>the tempered major 3rds, are all already below the possible<br/>tuning resolution, is why i can confidently invoke the<br/>equivalences in the tables above.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=34899 href="#34899">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 12:06:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; the fact that the size of the skhisma, as well as the<br/>&gt; other very small differences which arise in connection with<br/>&gt; the tempered major 3rds, are all already below the possible<br/>&gt; tuning resolution, is why i can confidently invoke the<br/>&gt; equivalences in the tables above.</p><p>they don&apos;t really have much compositional importance though, because<br/>neither 512:405 nor 81:64 are sonorities that can be heard &apos;as such&apos;<br/>(in terms of such high harmonics) . . . both are merely &apos;pretty sharp<br/>major thirds&apos;.</p><p>compositionally, *all* 12-tone well temperaments rely on the<br/>vanishing of the full interval-group that includes the syntonic<br/>comma, diaschisma, schisma, pythagorean comma, several dieses, etc.<br/>this is perhaps demonstrated best in mathieu&apos;s book _the harmonic<br/>experience_, with lots of examples from the literature including<br/>beethoven and bartok.</p></div>
