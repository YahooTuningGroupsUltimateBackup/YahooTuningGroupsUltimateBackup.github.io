Just because Paul E mentioned it maybe 86 times? Okay,<br/>&gt;&gt;I guess that&apos;s important enough. Did Forte actually say something<br/>&gt;&gt;significant? Perhaps I was too young to notice.</p><p>Paul Erlich, evidently offended, replied:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look, you can drop the attitude -- John said he hadn&apos;t studied classical<br/>&gt; tonal analysis and I thought I&apos;d give him an example where he could learn<br/>&gt; about diatonic chord functions, linear harmonic devices, etc., in the<br/>&gt; context of the Western common-practice repertoire. I suppose you&apos;d do away<br/>&gt; with all classical tonal analysis and replace it with . . . ?</p><p>Easy baby! The key phrase there was &quot;perhaps I was too young to notice.&quot; (I<br/>guess you missed my &quot;wink.&quot;)  Granted, I came in on the conversation after<br/>the significance of the Forte book was mentioned. I had no intention of<br/>denigrating someone who appears to be your personal choice of experts on<br/>tradition. My own expert of choice (not mine, but my teachers&apos;) was Walter<br/>Piston, for whom I have no particular fondness and whose book I would not<br/>recommend to anyone.</p><p>Regarding your concern about my valuing classical tonal analysis, my goal is<br/>certainly not to do away with tradition--rather simply to help interested<br/>folks understand it. That&apos;s why I wrote &quot;The Sounds of Music: Perception and<br/>Notation.&quot; I feel that a better understanding of musical tuning will help to<br/>bring traditional music (indeed, all music) to a vibrant new life.</p><p>Paul, read my paragraph again. There is a compliment to you hidden not very<br/>deeply under my facetious remarks.</p><p>(To the new reader: The point of all of this is that I may be able to supply<br/>a copy of the book in question. Paul omitted that part.)</p></div><h3><a id=7234 href="#7234">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/1999 12:17:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The only reason Barbershop blends so much is because it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;monophonic.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As opposed to polyphonic.  Barbershop is supposed to blend into one voice,<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s written as one voice.  Try counterpoint in JI and get back to<br/>&gt; me, if there&apos;s even an instrument around with enough resolution to produce<br/>&gt; the effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>The problem here, as I see it, is somewhat semantic. The term monophonic is<br/>traditionally applicable to a single melody (sans harmony) as in a Gregorian<br/>chant. In traditional &quot;harmonized&quot; styles, the common textural descriptive<br/>term is &quot;homophonic.&quot;</p><p>I do see the logical application of the term monophonic in regard to<br/>barbershop in that the goal is to make the three &quot;harmony parts&quot; disappear<br/>into the melody and simply &quot;color&quot; it. This is also true of vocal jazz<br/>groups of the big-band era. In both of these styles there is no attempt at<br/>voice leading within the &quot;harmony parts&quot; therefore making the melody the<br/>only real musical entity.</p><p>However, Bach often seemed to ignore melodic continuity and &quot;voice leading&quot;<br/>in his &quot;harmony parts.&quot; Would a Bach chorale be monophonic or homophonic? Is<br/>it a matter of degree? (God, I hope not. My music appreciation students are<br/>confused enough as it is.)</p></div><h3><a id=7240 href="#7240">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/1999 8:22:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The problem here, as I see it, is somewhat semantic.</p><p>You got that right!</p><p>&gt;The term monophonic is traditionally applicable to a single melody (sans<br/>&gt;harmony) as in a Gregorian chant.
