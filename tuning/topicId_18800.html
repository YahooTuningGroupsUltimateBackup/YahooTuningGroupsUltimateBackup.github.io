Krenek had already retired from teaching at Hamline University when<br/>he came to live in the L.A. area around 1947, finally retiring to Palm Springs<br/>in 1966.  He was a frequent visitor to UCSD but never a regular faculty member.<br/>Two of his Hamline students (Robert Erickson and Will Ogdon) co-founded the UCSD<br/>music department, the head of the music library and a former college provost at<br/>UCSC are both Krenek scholars.</p><p>Krenek did not study with Schoenberg. He was a student of Franz Schreker,<br/>following Schreker fom Vienna to Berlin.</p><p>DJW</p></div>
