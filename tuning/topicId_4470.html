I played around with a<br/>small lyre that we have at home and tuned it<br/>with some notes from 22TET and recorded two<br/>little ditties, each about 30 seconds long, in<br/>RealAudio format. Kinda sound weird, and my<br/>lack of playing ability doesn&apos;t help. ;-)</p><p>The response I&apos;ve received from the 22TET page<br/>has been nice! I wasn&apos;t sure if I&apos;d just be<br/>doing this for myself or how many others would<br/>be interested or would contribute. But it&apos;s<br/>happening! Neat! Thanks!</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Darin &quot;Basil&quot; Arrick<br/><a href="mailto:basil@homestead.org">basil@homestead.org</a></p><p>Catch 22!
