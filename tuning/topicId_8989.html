If I used a scale which approximated yours by starting with an<br/>&gt; interval of 112 cents, it might be close enough, depending on the desired<br/>&gt; application.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this correct?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Ok, I just got the latest of mellosofttron III.  Seems to work well with<br/>no<br/>&gt; detectable latency with my AMDII 350.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t seem to have any microtonal capability, expect for pitch bend.<br/>&gt; Am I correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also am giving wavmaker a try, which has great flexibility it its tuning<br/>&gt; tables.  Seems a shame that they would not include that in mellosoftron.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I added WAVmaker to the Microtonal synthesis web site.  WAVmaker is a MIDI<br/>to wave rendering program, which means it generates the audio files in<br/>non-realtime.  The resolution to .00000000000000000001 Hz was pretty<br/>impressive.  Polyhedric Software&apos;s other programs do not have builtin<br/>microtuning features.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:microtonal@worldnet.att.net">microtonal@worldnet.att.net</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p></div>
