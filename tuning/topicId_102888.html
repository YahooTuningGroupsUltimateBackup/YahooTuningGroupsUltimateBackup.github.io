In practice we don&apos;t &quot;just&quot; do what Keenan did because it&apos;s easier to use ratios. Except Keenan apparently did use harmonic entropy and he&apos;s one of us. So we must have done that after all.<br/>Showing errors in target intervals also makes it clear what you got relative to what you wanted. And make it easier to say what you want to start with. And measure complexity.<br/>That should give you some pointers.
