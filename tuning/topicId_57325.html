There are other ways &gt;also to map to an octahedron that do not involve the 2 out of 4 set &gt;where the products are reduced into a single point in the set. The &gt;former was done by Fuller for one who made a big to do over it<br/>&gt;I am quite aware of being a lunatic, but all true beginnings always look &gt;like madness. Still i await a concrete example of combination product &gt;sets as such.<br/>&gt; the discovery of this was not some accidental discovery. Erv has stated &gt;that the moon flights were instrumental in conceiving of such weightless &gt;structures.  In retrospect salso he has pointed out to me the diagram on &gt;Page 123 of Partch&apos;s Genesis of a Music ( a book he did quite a few of &gt;the diagrams for) and finds that possibly this chart might have halso &gt;had an influence on him if one thinks for these as a product into tones &gt;instead of triads.  Regardless , it takes something to realize the &gt;signigance of this structure and what it can do musically.

The way the first proof<br/>is done rather shapes the subject to some<br/>extent. Or more generally, the way they<br/>get at the results originally if not particularly<br/>set out as a formal proof.</p><p>I think Gene couldn&apos;t be expected to come upu with<br/>the geometrical type approach to the CPS<br/>sets since he is after all an algebraicist.<br/>But has his own point of view and<br/>route into the subject. Erv has another.<br/>Some will be inspired by one and some by<br/>the other. Obviously one thinks that the<br/>whoever  particularly inspires oneself is<br/>the best. But that doesn&apos;t mean others<br/>are wrong if inspired by others to an<br/>equal degree. Clearly many here<br/>are inspired by Gene&apos;s approach and<br/>there is nothing wrong about that.<br/>But trying to say which is best<br/>or to win others over to ones own approach<br/>though natural will proably not get one very<br/>far.</p><p>Just a thought.

Euler already mapped all this territory if it is just a matter of ratios. i too can take eulers diagram and circle a  hexany for instance. But this is more like having the answer already and coming up with the question. to equate a correspondence of a centered structure that does not have a tone in common with the structure in question with an uncentered structure which the eikosany is, misses the mark and in mind mind only a very extreme coincidence, even less so than  the 1-3-5-7-9-11- genera of euler.<br/>While gene work is quite possible in inspiring other s as you put it. No one even knew about this existence until just the other day,  since it did not exist in a form that others could know it. It hardly puts this work in the same category of the hundred or so composers that not only written for the eikosany, but have tuned it up on real instruments  in the real world. The comparison does not compare nor at the present rank on the same level of inspiration. History may change that in the future , but for the time being, this irs the reality of the situation.  It might be good if on your own site you referred to the hexany as being discovered by Erv Wilson as opposed to a &apos;structure that some musicians call the hexany&apos;.

The way the first proof<br/>is done rather shapes the subject to some<br/>extent. Or more generally, the way they<br/>get at the results originally if not particularly<br/>set out as a formal proof.</p><p>I think Gene couldn&apos;t be expected to come upu with<br/>the geometrical type approach to the CPS<br/>sets since he is after all an algebraicist.<br/>But has his own point of view and route into the subject. Erv has another.<br/>Some will be inspired by one and some by<br/>the other. Obviously one thinks that the<br/>whoever  particularly inspires oneself is<br/>the best. But that doesn&apos;t mean others<br/>are wrong if inspired by others to an<br/>equal degree. Clearly many here<br/>are inspired by Gene&apos;s approach and<br/>there is nothing wrong about that.<br/>But trying to say which is best<br/>or to win others over to ones own approach<br/>though natural will proably not get one very<br/>far.</p><p>Just a thought.
