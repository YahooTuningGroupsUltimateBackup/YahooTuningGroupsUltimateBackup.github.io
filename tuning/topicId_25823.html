Perhaps<br/>&gt; you&apos;d care to discuss the _evidence_ behind your deduction that this<br/>&gt; is the temperament Bach intended?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt;Dear Mr. Erlich,</p><p>The reply to your query about &quot;evidence&quot; for authenticity - and this as<br/>exhaustively as possible, and to the best of my knowledge - is held in the 40 or<br/>so publications that are referred to in my site.</p><p>For about 250 years the E. T.-rubbish had been irresponsibly and<br/>incompetently disseminated and propagated. For baroque harpsichord music, the<br/>sound of E. T. is a disaster, an insult to hearing ears.<br/>It  is not possible, besides basing myself upon my publications, to present the<br/>material of 40 articles within 3 lines.</p><p>I have known my regretted friend John Barnes for about 30 years. He let read me<br/>porior to publication his deservedly famous text for comments - I had none! I<br/>just said to him, do publish it ASAP. Within his error margins, our results are<br/>entirely compatible.</p><p>In my review of Rasch&apos;s facsimile of Werckmeisters Musicalische Temperatur, I<br/>have demonstrated that Werckmeister himself knew &quot;Bach&apos;s&quot; wohltemperirt - this<br/>was, in fact, Werckmeister&apos;s preferred system.</p><p>No reasonable person would - could there be any sufficient reason - close C-E by<br/>three tempered plus 1 perfect fifth!! My article in ACUSTICA also tackles this<br/>aspect.</p><p>That is to say, Werckmeister didn&apos;t take himself his system W III seriously!!<br/>I published about 4 papers in the English Harpsichord Magazine which, above all,<br/>elucidated my own comprehension of Werckmeister&apos;s psychology. The proponent of W<br/>III for Bach should read that paper, published 1985 in Revue de Musicologie,<br/>Paris. I&apos;m certain he does not know it, but I leave happily everybody with his<br/>preconceived ideas, be they wrong, but makes and leaves them happy.</p><p>Baroque minds, JSB included, differ from ours, nowadays. Refer to Rolf Dammann,<br/>Der Musikbegriff im Deutschen Barock.</p><p>A convenient and hopefully easily accessible paper I published in THE TRACKER,<br/>Organ Historical Society which I heartily recommend. In my personal opinion, I<br/>was pretty surprised how readable it came out. I&apos;m even close to admire that<br/>article myself, were I not so modest by nature!</p><p>Kindest regards,</p><p>Yours sincerely,<br/>Herbert Anton Kellner<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

However, one harpsichordist, Joseph Spencer, has<br/>reported often leaning toward 1/3-comma as a more dramatically<br/>tempered arrangement -- and we know that Costeley (1570) liked this<br/>&quot;thirdtone&quot; tuning, or the almost identical division of the octave<br/>into 19 equal parts.</p><p>Zarlino adopts 2/7-comma as his own tuning, indeed the first such<br/>meantone tuning to be described in terms of a precise fraction of the<br/>syntonic comma (1558), and later comments that 1/4-comma is not<br/>difficult to tune while 1/3-comma is somewhat &quot;languid.&quot;</p><p>However, I might question any attempt to identify one of these tunings<br/>as _the_ &quot;Lasso tuning&quot; or &quot;Cabezon tuning&quot; or &quot;Gabrieli tuning,&quot;<br/>although in the last case one could argue that Zarlino&apos;s influence in<br/>Venice _might_ have made 2/7-comma a likely choice.</p><p>What one person sees as a &quot;flaw&quot; in Werckmeister III, another might<br/>see as a virtue: &quot;more dramatic shadings,&quot; for example. The major<br/>third C-E might be further from 5:4 than in some other<br/>well-temperaments of the era, but then again, it might also be<br/>described as somewhat closer to pure than in 1/6-comma meantone,<br/>Silbermann&apos;s famous organ tuning during the same era.</p><p>Going back my 16th-century analogy, I might also ask, &quot;Is it not<br/>possible to prefer slightly different temperaments for different<br/>pieces?&quot;</p><p>For example, Mark Lindley finds 2/7-comma meantone especially pleasing<br/>for some of Gabrieli&apos;s pieces featuring mostly slow-moving vertical<br/>sonorities; more contrapuntal textures suggest to him a less heavily<br/>tempered meantone (e.g. 1/4-comma) with somewhat narrower diatonic<br/>semitones.</p><p>Similarly, I find the hypothesis attractive that Bach may have played<br/>on keyboards with a range of well-temperaments, with Werckmeister III<br/>at one part of the spectrum and something like Victorian &quot;shades of<br/>equal temperament&quot; at another -- that is, temperaments with gentle<br/>color contrasts which might be deemed _relatively_ equal by comparison<br/>to other typical schemes.</p><p>However, this is reasoning by analogy, not by an appreciation of the<br/>fine structure of Bach&apos;s music which someone like Wendy Carlos could<br/>offer, for example, or Daniel Wolf, and which many people here are<br/>likely much better qualified to offer than I am.</p><p>My main point would be that a period may have an outlook on intonation<br/>suggesting a general approach -- meantone in the 16th century, or<br/>unequal well-temperaments in the 18th -- but leaving a range of<br/>tunings open which follow this approach, inviting then or now the<br/>exercise of taste and creative choice, often an exercise with much<br/>room for divergence.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
