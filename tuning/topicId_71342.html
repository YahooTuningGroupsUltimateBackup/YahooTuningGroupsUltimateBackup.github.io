I guess this is  with frets<br/>on a long neck?  Any details about the circumstances?</p><p>Thank you in advance. And please allow me to say, I love your  music.  I have<br/>just finished a new piece for bass trombone, wind quintet,  and percussion.<br/>Throughout I balance a Georgian-derived scale for the wind  quintet, in<br/>concert with the solo bass trombonist, who plays one  of your earlier posted scales.<br/> First rehearsal for the May 2 concert is  this Thursday.  (As we say in New<br/>York, fingers crossed.)</p><p>If you have, or might compose, a work for multiple acoustic musicians for  us<br/>to play on the next AFMM series, we would relish the opportunity to perform<br/>your music.</p><p>yours,</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s free at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a>.</p></div>
