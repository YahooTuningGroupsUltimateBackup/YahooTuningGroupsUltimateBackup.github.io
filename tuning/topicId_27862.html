In my usual terms, these would be &quot;augmented<br/>sixths&quot; such as Eb-C# -- a kind of sound, in a tempered version, that<br/>I much relish in something like 17-tET. I likewise found myself<br/>enjoying the near-11:6 intervals, and would like better to become<br/>acquainted with their nuances of &quot;justness.&quot;</p><p>Secor also notes the presence of some pure 11:7 intervals, familiar to<br/>me as regular minor sixths in a tuning with pure 14:11 major thirds --<br/>which, of course, are also available in what I might term the more<br/>&quot;remote&quot; portion of the tuning circle.</p><p>His beautiful temperament has nine of the fifths (Ab-B) at about<br/>707.220 cents, and the other eight at around 704.377 cents.</p><p>While I&apos;m not sure about the kind of stylistic setting which may have<br/>inspired Secor&apos;s tuning, I correctly guessed that it would be a<br/>wonderful choice for neo-Gothic music growing largely out of 13th-14th<br/>century Western European styles.</p><p>In the &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; timbre I used, the major thirds in the nearer part<br/>of the tuning circle at ~428.88 cents had a very pleasantly &quot;bright&quot;<br/>or sunny quality, at once relatively concordant and providing a most<br/>satisfying cadential resolution. They can be points of motion, or<br/>places to pause now and then.</p><p>There are five remote thirds at a pure 14:11 (~417.51 cents), the<br/>octave complements of Secor&apos;s pure 11:7&apos;s, and in this gestalt -- to<br/>borrow your term -- these major thirds seemed quite &quot;mellow,&quot; lending<br/>a note of &quot;modal color,&quot; while still providing very nice cadences.</p><p>As expected on the basis of experience with other tunings, I liked the<br/>pure 11:7 minor sixths also: they have a bit of a pleasantly &quot;languid&quot;<br/>flavor for me.</p><p>A feature of Secor&apos;s tuning circle is that the brightest major thirds,<br/>and also the most narrow or compact diatonic semitones, are located in<br/>the nearest transpositions -- with steps such as E-F or B-C at around<br/>63.90 cents, quite close to 28:27. As we move to the remote portion of<br/>the circle, these semitones gently increase in size to around 78.11<br/>cents -- identical to those of a regular tuning with pure 14:11 major<br/>thirds, and very close to 46-tET.</p><p>I very much like this touch, which gives the tuning its own character<br/>and pattern. Of course, I experience that pattern in the setting of<br/>the musical style I happen to be exploring, and would emphasize that<br/>Secor&apos;s tuning and its wealth of intervals and sonorities could fit<br/>many kinds of styles both known and yet to be discovered.</p><p>As it happens, I only learned of this superb well-temperament in the<br/>last few months, more or less, while looking at a post by Brian<br/>McLaren from a Tuning List archive for July, 1994. McLaren quotes from<br/>an article by Secor in the first issue of _Interval_ (1978).[1]</p><p>Just about a year ago, not yet aware of Secor&apos;s tuning, I came up with<br/>a 17-note well-temperament taking as the first 12 notes a regular<br/>tuning with pure 14:11 major thirds (Eb-G#). Five of the remaining<br/>fifths were tempered at about 708.77 cents to produce two pure 9:7<br/>major thirds in the far portion of the circle, with the remaining<br/>&quot;odd&quot; fifth at about 708.00 cents to fill out the circle, and produce<br/>another near-9:7 third.</p><p>In this scheme, the largest major thirds and narrowest diatonic<br/>semitones occur at the far portion of circle.

We have<br/>been studying it together, the Musical Animal and I, and the MA had some<br/>interesting thoughts about those 11:7 and 14:11 intervals that you detected<br/>in Secor&apos;s scale. On a piece of paper (the MA doesn&apos;t speak, as you well<br/>know) it pointed them out to me. It sketched the frequency spectrum of an<br/>octave, a fifth, a fourth, a major sixth and more intervals in the sequence<br/>of descending consonance, including 11:7 and 14:11, all of them with their<br/>lower harmonics and their combination tones up to about the third order. The<br/>MA looked at me, and I knew what it was asking:</p><p>&quot;Do you see how the great consonances, most of all the octave, the fifth and<br/>the fourth, are inflicted by coincidences of their harmonics and by<br/>combination tones that coincide with the very frequencies of the interval<br/>tones and their harmonics, but only in just tuning? Try to tune a little, try<br/>to temper, and you will get beats all over. Therefore the quest for<br/>temperaments with as many as possible just fifths, and did you ever hear of<br/>somebody trying to temper the octave? But those intervals like 11:7 and<br/>14:11, they are practically carefree. They are perhaps no great consonances,<br/>but they certainly lack dissonance. You don&apos;t need to fret over accuracy to<br/>enjoy them. Their harmonics meet only where we can&apos;t hear them anymore, and<br/>combination tones keep respectful distance from the base tones and their<br/>harmonics. Don&apos;t you think that this contributes to their beauty decidingly?&quot;</p><p>Well, who am I to argue with the MA about issues it is expert in. I just want<br/>you to know about its ideas. With that, we wish to say good bye to you and to<br/>the list for a few weeks. I will be on a trip to Europe, and the MA is going<br/>to join me. That&apos;s fine with me, it&apos;s good to have a companion during those<br/>long flights that shares one&apos;s thoughts.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Heinz</p></div>
