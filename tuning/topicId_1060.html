E.g. for sample length of 4096<br/>= just less than 10th of a second at 44100 samples<br/>per sec, the freq. bins are 10.77 hz apart.</p><p>So the FFT is more accurate for higher frequencies than<br/>for lower ones. It is indeed a harmonic series, but a<br/>harmonic series based on the frequency of 10.77 hz, rather<br/>than on the frequency of the instrumetn being sampled.</p><p>As I&apos;ve just posted, but you may not have seen yet,<br/>one can improve on this accuracy by frequency<br/>interpolation.</p><p>As regards amplitude, if one uses the complex FFT,<br/>and discards the imaginary<br/>part, then the real part may fluctuate wildly, as<br/>it will depend on the phase.</p><p>One should instead find the length of the complex<br/>vector (sqrt of sum of squares), as you mention.</p><p>Or use a real instead of complex fft (same result,<br/>but faster algorithm, if one is willing to discard<br/>the phase information).</p><p>This gives reasonably stable amplitudes I find in my<br/>tests, finding the amplitudes of the random frequencies<br/>of an 0.1 second clip with accuracy of often less than<br/>a decibel, but with the occasional wild value out by about 2 or 3 decibels,<br/>e.g. finding it as 24 decibels instead of 27.</p><p>It&apos;s not so good as the pitch determination.<br/>Perhaps there are ways of interpolating for the<br/>amplitude as well as the pitch?</p><p>The angle of the complex vector gives the phase information.<br/>Real and imaginary parts are two components of a vector,<br/>and from that one can recover an angle, which tells one<br/>where in the cycle the particular sine wave component<br/>is at the beginning  of the clip.</p><p>As for hearing partials in musical timbres, it is<br/>interesting to speculate about which came first,<br/>the FFT analysis, or hearing partials.</p><p>Did we lean to recognise partials as a<br/>result of FFT analysis or was that something we<br/>could do anyway?</p><p>I think one can demonstrate historically that hearing<br/>partials came first, as for instance bell makers<br/>in C17 listened to partials in bell sounds<br/>and measured them, in order to help with making<br/>of church bells.</p><p>I wonder what is the earliest record of someone<br/>hearing partials in a musical sound?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
