I send out a lot of CD&apos;s, I give em away to anyone who&apos;s interested, and I always try to explain that &quot;microtones&quot; are really just a neglected part of music that got sort of overlooked when the 12 eq system won out. And without fail, people respond very positively and with curiosity, which leads me to believe that, if people in general just KNEW about non 12 tunings, which most people don&apos;t, the whole situation would change, and tuning knowledge would become a more integrated part of music in general.

I like to point out to<br/>people not that there are merely &quot;manymany&quot; ways to<br/>tune an instrument, but that in fact there are<br/>infinite, unending numbers of ways to tune musical<br/>instruments.  Hardly anyone knows this simple fact.<br/>They don&apos;t teach it in school, in college, nor in<br/>music conservatories.  Sound is a continuum.  One can<br/>cut it an infinite number of ways.  Johnny Reinhard&apos;s<br/>poly-microtonal compositions demonstrate this.</p><p>                          -- Mark Rankin</p><p>--- Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:microstick@msn.com">microstick@msn.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    I totally agree with gene&apos;s last post, and I am<br/>&gt; totally convinced that<br/>&gt; non 12 tunings can become &quot;in,&quot; and part of the so<br/>&gt; called &quot;mainstream,&quot; but<br/>&gt; it&apos;s going to take a lot of patience and education<br/>&gt; to help it along.
