Here are some comments she makes<br/>&gt;in her article, &quot;Tuning at the Crossroads&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[Many Carlos quotes omitted]<br/>&gt;&quot;Since low partials are involved, the resulting flat<br/>&gt;fifths beat much slower than if some higher ratio were mistuned by the same<br/>&gt;5.3766 cents -- if you will, the fifth can &quot;stand it&quot; better.&quot;<br/>&gt;[More Carlos quotes omitted]</p><p>Paul, I think you are reading too much into Wendy&apos;s self-described &quot;capsule<br/>explanation&quot;. She was only trying to establish that 1/4 comma meantone (or<br/>_any_ meantone) distributes the syntonic comma better than equal tempered.<br/>She wasn&apos;t distinguishing between any characteristic meantones. Beats were<br/>an easily explained motivation. Relative increase in sensory dissonance<br/>would be just as good a motivation for this but much harder to explain.</p><p>I don&apos;t think anyone would find an error of 30 cents in fifths as<br/>acceptable as the errors of 14 and 16 cents that folks routinely put up<br/>with in major and minor thirds. And certainly no one finds errors of 60<br/>cents in an octave or unison to be as benign. I thought we had agreed that<br/>the error weighting function for these simple intervals is somewhere<br/>between equal weighted and weight proportional to 1/limit, and certainly<br/>not proportional to the limit.</p><p>However !!!!, I can conceive that when the differences between coinciding<br/>partials are so small as to give rise primarily to a slow beat (say &lt;5Hz),<br/>rather than roughness, even in the upper registers, then weight according<br/>to beating _might_ become a more important criterion than relative increase<br/>in sensory dissonance.</p><p>So which inversion of which triad do we make minimum beating, 4:5:6, 3:4:5,<br/>10:12:15? Do we use RMS or Max_Abs? I&apos;ll assume 4:5:6 and Max_Abs.</p><p>interval     frequency of coinciding partials (relative, arbitrary units)<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>fifth         6<br/>major third  10<br/>minor third  15</p><p>Let x be the flatness of the fifth, measured in commas (a positive fraction).<br/>The flatness of the major third is 4x - 1<br/>The flatness of the minor third is 1 - 3x</p><p>For such small deviations we can ignore the logarithmic relationship and we<br/>get relative beats of</p><p>interval     frequency of beat (relative, arbitrary units)<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>fifth        6x<br/>major third  40x - 10<br/>minor third  15 - 45x</p><p>The minimimum Max-Abs beat rate will occur when the (absolute value of the)<br/>rates are the same for major and minor third.</p><p>40x - 10 = 15 - 45x<br/>=&gt; 85x = 25<br/>=&gt; x = 25/85 = 5/17 ~= 0.294</p><p>I see now that 5/17 comma meantone gives equal beats for all three<br/>intervals in the 4:5:6 chord.</p><p>How come this number hasn&apos;t come up before?

The first few pages of both contain information on the<br/>proposed tuning system of Robert Smith. According to Mandelbaum, Smith&apos;s<br/>ideal fifth in his<br/>&gt;1759 _Harmonics_ is flat by, you guessed it, 5/18 of a comma. Mandelbaum&apos;s<br/>description makes it seem as if Smith might have used the same derivation<br/>as me. According to Jorgenson, however, Smith&apos;s ideal fifth derived from<br/>equal-beating<br/>&gt;considerations and satisfies the equation 3x^3+4x=16. That implies a fifth<br/>0.0027 cents smaller than that of 5/18-comma meantone. Though this is<br/>really splitting paramecial hairs, anyone know who&apos;s right about Smith?</p><p>Can you explain how 3x^3+4x=16 is derived from equal-beating<br/>considerations? I guess that x here represents the fifth-size as a<br/>frequency ratio rather than its logarithmic error in commas.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>perlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>5/7/1999 2:23:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Paul, I think you are reading too much into &gt;Wendy&apos;s self-described &quot;capsule<br/>&gt;explanation&quot;.

This could be a reference to the squared error she likes to use, but she just finished saying that the fifths can take mistuning better than thirds.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think anyone would find an error of 30 &gt;cents in fifths as<br/>&gt;acceptable as the errors of 14 and 16 cents that &gt;folks routinely put up<br/>&gt;with in major and minor thirds.</p><p>30 cents, no. 25 cents, as suggested by inverse limit-weighting, would still be problematic from a purely melodic point of view. Let&apos;s stick to the deviations in 12-tET and meantone. You have to remember how very engrained 12-tET is in most people&apos;s musical consciousness, and that in many parts of the world other non-JI intervals are equally engrained. The quality of JI or meantone thirds is really quite different from that of 12-tET, and to a musician the former is hard to put up with at first, until a good exposure period, after which a return to 12-tET is _really_ hard to put up with.</p><p>&gt;I see now that 5/17 comma meantone gives equal &gt;beats for all three<br/>&gt;intervals in the 4:5:6 chord.</p><p>&gt;How come this number hasn&apos;t come up before? What &gt;did I screw up?</p><p>I think Wilson&apos;s meta-meantone had the same equal-beating goal. Was that 5/17-comma? Jorgenson&apos;s book is loaded with equal-beating tunings -- equal beating seems some kind of holy grail in Jorgenson&apos;s mind. Maybe his bias led him to distort Smith&apos;s views.</p><p>&gt;Can you explain how 3x^3+4x=16 is derived from &gt;equal-beating<br/>&gt;considerations? I guess that x here represents &gt;the fifth-size as a<br/>&gt;frequency ratio rather than its logarithmic error &gt;in commas.</p><p>Yes. According to Jorgenson, Smith wanted a fifth and a major sixth to beat at the same rate when their lower note was the same.</p></div><h3>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>5/7/1999 4:45:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul writes:<br/>&gt;Jorgenson&apos;s book is loaded with equal-beating tunings -- equal beating<br/>&gt;seems some kind of holy grail in Jorgenson&apos;s mind.

The use of equal beating comparisons is<br/>a way of measurement which makes tuning easier to quantify and we know that<br/>the easiest way has always been the favored method by the average tuner.  The<br/>equal beating temperaments have their strengths and weakness, but for a<br/>practical matter, I think their ease was responsible for their popularity.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
