In<br/>the process of researching at Anaphoria to find more info about<br/>hexanies, dekanies, eikosanies, and so forth, I stumbled across<br/>Wilson&apos;s &quot;golden horagrams of the scale tree.&quot;  I can see that they<br/>contain lambdomic patterns of some kind.  They appear to be vertical<br/>slices of the tree bent around in a circle.  Does anyone on the list<br/>know what they are for?  I&apos;m working on the assumption - no more<br/>than a guess, really - that the circle represents 2:1 or possibly<br/>any interval of equivalence.  I&apos;ve generated some tunings by turning<br/>the angles directly into cents - simply multiplying the number of<br/>degrees by 3 1/3 (1200 cents/360 degrees).</p><p>Whether that&apos;s what Wilson intended, I have no idea, but it yields<br/>some amazing scales.  Unlike nearly all JI tunings I&apos;ve played with,<br/>most of these have a cohesiveness that is readily perceivable.<br/>There&apos;s a beauty to them that feels eerily natural to me, often kind<br/>of gooey or watery, if you know what I mean.  Change one tone in a<br/>scale by only a few cents - even if it brings a given interval<br/>closer to Just - or accidentally invoke a tone from the next ring<br/>out, and it stands out like a sore thumb.  This even in the context<br/>of already highly xenharmonic intervals.  I&apos;m kind of stunned.<br/>Never experienced anything like it.</p><p>Nevertheless, one thing that makes me wonder whether I&apos;m using them<br/>as intended (besides the fact that there&apos;s nothing in the way of a<br/>key or legend!) is that the horagrams are derived from the scale<br/>tree, which in turn appears to be an alternative representation of<br/>(sections of?) the Lambdoma, which is, in all other uses I&apos;ve seen<br/>of it, strictly rational.  So one might expect the horagrams to<br/>represent rational tunings, too, although the &quot;slices&quot; that become<br/>horagrams look like they&apos;re taken from approx. phi times the length<br/>of each &quot;branch&quot; of the tree.</p><p>This all assumes that the horagrams are supposed to represent<br/>tunings, also only a guess in the dark.  They might represent ways<br/>of categorizing scales by some means that doesn&apos;t taking specific<br/>tunings into account.  Or ...?</p><p>In any event, the tunings generated by &quot;my&quot; method sound promising<br/>to me.  If anyone is interested, I&apos;ll post them on a web page.<br/>There&apos;s probably too much material to publish on the List.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

A particular scale in a noble series of MOSs has the<br/>property that the ratio between the large and small melodic steps<br/>(measured logarithmically, e.g., in cents) is phi. Nothing special<br/>about that in itself. However, each successive scale in the series<br/>splits each of the large steps of the previous scale into two parts --<br/> one part is equal to the small step of the previous scale, and the<br/>other is equal to phi-1 = 1/phi times the small step of the previous<br/>scale. Thus the ratio between the two step sizes of the new scale is<br/>1:(phi-1) = 1:(1/phi) = phi. This magic works because phi is the<br/>solution to the equation<br/>x-1 = 1/x.<br/>Anyway, any non-noble, non-ET generator will eventually produce an<br/>MOS scale where the ratio of the step sizes is more uneven than phi.<br/>However, one may have to look at very high in the series of MOSs for<br/>a particular generator to find this uneven scale. So the advantage of<br/>using a noble generator seems only clear if you extend the series of<br/>MOSs very high.</p></div><h3><a id=15353 href="#15353">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2000 10:42:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;David Finnamore&quot; &lt;daeron@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the first one I chose horagram #50: 7phi+2 / 17phi+5, because<br/>it<br/>&gt; offers the familiar 5-&gt;7-&gt;12 pattern.

I wonder whether all noble generator MOS<br/>scales might have near approximations in EDOs (well, you know, EDOs<br/>smaller than 8539)?

Well, I&apos;d say it<br/>just jumps out at you.  This doesn&apos;t happen with JI tunings (unless<br/>they&apos;re MOS, maybe?).  In fact, play the heptatonic and then try<br/>replacing either the &quot;4&quot; or &quot;5&quot; with an adjacent tone from the 12<br/>ring and hear the system fall apart.
