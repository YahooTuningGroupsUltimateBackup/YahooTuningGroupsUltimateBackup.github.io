Wanting to hear Ives in Just<br/> Intonation or even 22-tone equal temperament would be a choice.  To say that<br/> C# is higher than Db is key to Ives&apos;s tuning conceptual model.</p><p> Question:  how would a B# be an eighthtone higher than a C natural in just<br/> intonation?</p><p> Johnny Reinhard<br/> AFMM<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>In the passage from the _Memos_ cited by Dan Stearns, Ives gives three<br/>possibilities for tuning in general: 12tet, a tuning where the leading tone<br/>is different in ascending and descending passages, and a tuning that seems to<br/>be pythagorean.  The second tuning _could_ be a form of just intonation where<br/>the leading tone is raised to the pythagorean value.</p><p>Need I add that nowhere does Ives give an explicit instruction for the<br/>intonation in _The Unanswered Question_? Your performing version was but one<br/>of several possibilities and -- barring some contact with the composer<br/>himself -- the choices, however attractive they may be, were indeed your own.<br/>To claim more than that is unwarranted by the evidence available.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
