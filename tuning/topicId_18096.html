Or a bicycle horn, it&apos;s hard to tell.<br/>&gt; Narrator: Skunkbucket LeFunke was born in 1876 and died in<br/>&gt; 1901. No one<br/>&gt; who heard him is alive today. The grandchildren of the people<br/>&gt; who heard him<br/>&gt; are not alive today. The great-grandchildren of the people<br/>&gt; who heard him<br/>&gt; are not alive today. He was never recorded.<br/>&gt; Wynton Marsalis: I&apos;ll tell you what Skunkbucket LeFunke<br/>&gt; sounded like. He<br/>&gt; had this big rippling sound, and he always phrased off the<br/>&gt; beat, and he<br/>&gt; slurred his notes. And when the Creole bands were still playing<br/>&gt; De-bah-de-bah-ta-da-tah, he was already playing<br/>&gt; Bo-dap-da-lete-do-do-do-bah!<br/>&gt; He was just like gumbo, ahead of his time.<br/>&gt; Announcer: LeFunke was a cornet player, gambler, card shark,<br/>&gt; pool hustler,<br/>&gt; pimp, male prostitute, Kelly Girl, computer programmer,brain<br/>&gt; surgeon and he<br/>&gt; invented the internet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley Crouch: When people listened to Skunkbucket LeFunke,<br/>&gt; they heard<br/>&gt; Do-do-dee-bwap-da-dee-dee-de-da-da-doop-doop-dap. And they<br/>&gt; knew even then<br/>&gt; how deeply profound that was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Announcer: It didn&apos;t take LeFunke long to advance the art of<br/>&gt; jazz past its<br/>&gt; humble beginnings in New Orleans whoredom with the addition<br/>&gt; of a bold and<br/>&gt; sassy beat.<br/>&gt; Wynton: Let me tell you about the Big Four. Before the Big Four,<br/>jazz<br/>&gt; drumming sounded like BOOM-chick-BOOM-chick-BOOM-chick. But<br/>&gt; now they had<br/>&gt; the Big Four, which was so powerful some said it felt like a<br/>&gt; Six. A few<br/>&gt; visiting musicians even swore they were in an Eight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: It was smooth and responsive, and there was no knocking and<br/>&gt; pinging, even on 87 octane.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: Even on gumbo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Announcer: When any musician in the world heard Louis<br/>&gt; Armstrong for the<br/>&gt; first time, they gnawed their arm off with envy, then said the<br/>angels<br/>&gt; probably wanted to sound like Louis. When you consider a<br/>&gt; bunch of angels<br/>&gt; talking in gruff voices and singing &quot;Hello Dolly,&quot; you<br/>&gt; realize what a stupid<br/>&gt; aspiration that is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gary Giddy: Louis changed jazz because he was the only cat going<br/>&gt; Do-da-dep-do-wah-be-be, while everyone else was doing<br/>&gt; Do-de-dap-dit-dit-dee.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: And that was very profound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marsalis: Like gumbo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: Uh-huh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Matt Glaser: I always have this fantasy that when Louis performed in<br/>&gt; Belgium, Heisenberg was in the audience and he was blown away<br/>&gt; and that&apos;s<br/>&gt; where he got the idea for his Uncertainty Principle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marsalis: Because the Uncertainty Principle, applied to jazz,<br/>&gt; means you<br/>&gt; never know if a cat is going to go Dap-da-de-do-ba-ta-bah or<br/>&gt; Dap-da-de-do-bip-de-beep.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: Louis was the first one to realize that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: And that can be very profound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: I thought it was a box of chocolates...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Announcer: The Savoy Ballroom brought people of all races colors<br/>&gt; andpolitical persuasions together to get sweaty as Europe<br/>&gt; moved closer and<br/>&gt; closer to the brink of World War II.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Savoy Dancer: We didn&apos;t care what color you were at the Savoy. We<br/>only<br/>&gt; cared if you were wearing deodorant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: Wynton always wears deodorant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Glaser: I&apos;ll bet Arthur Murray was on the dance floor and he<br/>&gt; was thinking<br/>&gt; about Louis and that&apos;s where he got the idea to open a bunch of<br/>dance<br/>&gt; schools.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: And that was very profound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Giddy: Let&apos;s talk about Louis some more. We&apos;ve wasted three<br/>&gt; minutes of this<br/>&gt; 57-part documentary not talking about Louis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: He was an angel, a genius, much better than Cats.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: He invented the word &quot;Cats.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: He invented swing, he invented jazz, he invented the<br/>&gt; telephone,the<br/>&gt; automobile and the polio vaccine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: And the internet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: Very profound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Announcer: Louis Armstrong turned commercial in the 1930s and<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t make<br/>&gt; any more breakthrough contributions to jazz. But it&apos;s not PC<br/>&gt; to point that<br/>&gt; out, so we&apos;ll be showing him in every segment of this series<br/>&gt; to come, even<br/>&gt; if he&apos;s just doing the same things as the last time you saw him.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Glaser: I&apos;ll bet Chuck Yeager was in the audience when Louis<br/>&gt; was hitting<br/>&gt; those high Cs at the Earle Theater in Philadelphia, and<br/>&gt; that&apos;s what made him<br/>&gt; decide to break the sound barrier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: And from there go to Pluto.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: I&apos;m going to make some gumbo-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: BOOM-chick-BOOM-chick-BOOM-chickSS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Giddy: Do-yap-do-wee-bah-scoot-scoot-dap-dap...That&apos;s what<br/>&gt; all the cats were<br/>&gt; saying back then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Announcer: In 1964, John Coltrane was at his peak, Eric Dolphy was<br/>in<br/>&gt; Europe, where he would eventually die, the Modern Jazz<br/>&gt; Quartet was making<br/>&gt; breakthrough recordings in the field of Third Stream Music,<br/>&gt; Miles Davis was<br/>&gt; breaking new barrier with his second great quintet, and<br/>&gt; Charlie Mingus was<br/>&gt; extending jazz composition to new levels of complexity. But<br/>&gt; we&apos;re going to<br/>&gt; talk about Louis singing &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;instead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stanley: Louis went,<br/>&gt; Ba-ba-yaba-do-do-dee-da-bebin-doo-wap-deet-deet-do-da-da.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton: Sweets went,<br/>&gt; Scoop-doop-shalaba-yaba-mokey-hokey-bwap-bwap-tee-tee-dee.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Giddy: I go, Da-da-shoobie-doobie-det-det-det-bap-bap-baaaaa...<br/>&gt; Announcer: The rest of the history of jazz will be shown in fast<br/>&gt; forward and will occupy exactly seven seconds. --There, that<br/>&gt; was it. Now<br/>&gt; here are some scenes from Ken Burns&apos; next documentary, a<br/>&gt; 97-part epic about<br/>&gt; the Empire State Building, titled &quot;The Empire State Building.&quot;<br/>&gt; &quot;It is tall and majestic. It is America&apos;s building. It is the Empire<br/>&gt; State Building. Dozens of workers gave their lives in the<br/>&gt; construction of<br/>&gt; this building.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Matt Glaser: I&apos;ll bet that they were thinking of Louis as<br/>&gt; they were falling<br/>&gt; to their deaths. I have this fantasy that his high notes inspired<br/>the<br/>&gt; immenseness of the Empire State Building.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wynton Marsalis: I&apos;ll bet most people who&apos;d fall off the Empire<br/>State<br/>&gt; Building would go &quot;Aaaaaahhhh!&quot; But these cats went:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Dee-dee-daba-da-da-bop-bop-de-dop-shewap-splat!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;That&apos;s next time on PBS&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Post message: <a href="mailto:jazz_guitar@yahoogroups.com">jazz_guitar@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subscribe:  <a href="mailto:jazz_guitar-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">jazz_guitar-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Unsubscribe:  <a href="mailto:jazz_guitar-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">jazz_guitar-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>List owner:  <a href="mailto:jazz_guitar-owner@yahoogroups.com">jazz_guitar-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>URL to this page: <a href="/jazz_guitar">/jazz_guitar</a></p></div>
