I believe that Pierre Boulez is playing one of<br/> the 4 piano parts.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>Opus 17 (...Zarathustra) was not played in the 1945 concert in which Boulez<br/>took part. The pieces played were the opera 10, 21, 23, 25, 28. Opus 17 was<br/>premiered in 1937 in Salle Chopin under the direction of the composer.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/> Boulez is one of the Honorary Advisors of the Wyschnegradsky Society in<br/> Paris.  He is not really hostile.  There is a story people tell of<br/> Wyschnegradsky bringing a score to Boulez who had said he would look it<br/>over.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>In recent years, and in light of the recent attention that Wyschnegradsky&apos;s<br/>music has had in the complexity and spectral circles, Boulez has mellowed<br/>somewhat, but his earlier disavowal and neglect of Wyschnegradsky are not<br/>negated.  Boulez had a tremendous amount of power and influence over French<br/>musical life while W. was still alive, and he was anything but supportive.</p></div>
