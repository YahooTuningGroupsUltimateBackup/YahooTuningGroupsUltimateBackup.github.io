It can hardly claim to be authentic, since the<br/>tempering is much more pronounced than what Bach would have used, but<br/>it made for striking contrasts between the keys, each of which to me<br/>worked as music. I uploaded a zipped file to tuning_files; you can do<br/>what you like with it but what I did was render it via midi and burn CDs.</p><p>Should Bach be played with microtonal thirds? It works for me.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2003 8:22:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I retuned Bach&apos;s WTC I, scored for woodwinds, via the rms grail set to<br/>&gt;C and cut two disks with the idea of finding whether I prefer the rms<br/>&gt;or JI version of grail.</p><p>And which did you prefer, or are you still working on it?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2003 8:24:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I retuned Bach&apos;s WTC I, scored for woodwinds, via the rms grail set to<br/>&gt;&gt;C and cut two disks with the idea of finding whether I prefer the rms<br/>&gt;&gt;or JI version of grail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And which did you prefer, or are you still working on it?</p><p>Interestingly, a while back a company called Q-Up Arts did a piano<br/>sample (available for a variety of synths) called the Holy Grail Piano.<br/>I think it was one of the first big 20-bit samples.

Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.&quot;<br/>- Former US Vice President Dan Quayle, 5/9/89</p><p>&quot;Few people think more than two or three times a year. I&apos;ve made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.&quot;<br/>-George Bernard Shaw, writer, Nobel laureate (1856-1950)</p><p>&quot;In a cookie factory, different cookies are baked in the shape of animals, cars, people, and airplanes. They all have different names and forms, but they are all made from the same dough, and they all taste the same. In the same way, all things in the universe - the sun, the moon, the stars, mountains, rivers, people, and so forth - have different names and forms, but they are all made from the same substance. The universe is organized into pairs of opposites: light and darkness, man and woman, sound and silence, good and bad. But all these opposites are mutual, because they are made from the same substance. Their names and their forms are different, but their substance is the same. Names and forms are made by your thinking. If you are not thinking and have no attachment to name and form, then all substance is one. Your don&apos;t know mind cuts off all thinking. This is your substance. Substance has no name and no form. Energy, mind, God, and matter are all name and form. Substance is the Absolute. Having name and form is having opposites. So the whole world is like the blind men fighting among themselves. Not understanding yourself is not understanding the truth. That is why there is fighting among ourselves. If all the people in the world understood themselves, they would attain the Absolute. Then the world would be at peace.&quot;<br/>- ?<br/>++++++</p></div>
