I looked for Fokker on the internet,<br/>&gt;periodicity blocks, etc... I couldn&apos;t find anything and<br/>&gt;have no idea what the matrix notation is referring to<br/>&gt;or why.</p><p>&gt;Oh well</p><p>************************************************************<br/>*A gentle introduction to Fokker periodicity blocks, part 1*<br/>************************************************************</p><p>Just intonation provides us with a potentially infinite set of pitches.<br/>Whether we are considering a one-dimensional string of perfect fifths<br/>(Pythagorean tuning or 3-limit JI), a two-dimensional grid of perfect fifths<br/>and major thirds (5-limit JI), a three-dimensional lattice of perfect<br/>fifths, major thirds, and harmonic sevenths (7-limit JI), or any other set<br/>of mutually prime intervals, the set of pitches will be infinite, with<br/>number of dimensions equal to the number of primary intervals.</p><p>Sometimes, for instance if we are building fixed-pitch JI instruments, we<br/>may decide it is necessary to settle for a finite number of pitches. There<br/>are of course many ways of doing this, but let&apos;s say we choose this<br/>approach: We keep adding more and more pitches, using simple JI intervals,<br/>until we find a pitch very close to one we already have. We have found a<br/>&quot;comma&quot; or &quot;unison vector&quot;. Then we decide that the new pitch is not worth<br/>adding. In the 3-limit case, we are done. Because once we find a unison<br/>vector, any further additions along the chain of fifths will just introduce<br/>that same unison vector between the new notes and notes we already have.<br/>Let&apos;s give some examples:</p><p>Here is a chain of fifths:</p><p>1024/729-256/243-128/81-32/27-16/9-4/3-1/1-3/2-9/8-27/16-81/64-243/128-729/5<br/>12</p><p>Let&apos;s say we start in the middle (1/1) and start adding notes alternately to<br/>the right and left on the chain of fifths (it doesn&apos;t matter; we could go in<br/>just one direction if we wanted to). Soon we have both 9/8 (204.9 cents) and<br/>32/27 (294.1 cents) in our scale, and the interval between them, about 90<br/>cents, is the smallest interval in the scale. Let&apos;s say that we consider<br/>this a &quot;unison vector&quot;, and decide that we only want to keep one of those<br/>pitches, say 9/8, in our scale. So we have a pentatonic (5-note) scale. If<br/>we tried to add a fifth above 9/8, which is 27/16, to the scale, we would<br/>find that that is 90 cents from a pitch we already have, 16/9. This could<br/>have been anticipated by noting the regularity of the chain of fifths: all<br/>fifths are the same size, so all intervals constructed from a given number<br/>of fifths are the same size no matter where they occur in the chain. In this<br/>case, an interval of 90 cents is always produced by a chain of 5 fifths. In<br/>vector notation, we say</p><p>(5) = 90 cents.</p><p>This unison vector defines the pentatonic scale. As we have seen,<br/>considering 90 cents to be a unison vector causes us to stop after we have 5<br/>notes in the chain of fifths. The pentatonic scale is called a &quot;periodicity<br/>block&quot; because the entire, infinite chain of fifths can be divided up into a<br/>string of pentatonic scales, each transposed 90 cents relative to its<br/>neighbor. Every note in the infinite chain can be seen as equivalent to one<br/>and only one of the five pitches in our pentatonic scale, through<br/>transpositions of 90 cents. So considering (5) to be a unison vector in a<br/>sense collapses the infinite resources of Pythagorean tuning into a single<br/>pentatonic scale.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say you consider 90 cents to be a large interval, a distinction<br/>worth making on our instrument (most of us would!). Then you keep expanding<br/>your chain of fifths. When you get all the pitches shown above, you find<br/>that the interval between 1024/729 (588.3 cents) and 729/512 (612.7 cents)<br/>is only about 23 cents. You might decide that this is too small a<br/>distinction to keep on your instrument. So you choose only one of those two<br/>pitches, and you have a 12-tone scale. The unison vector in question is thus</p><p>(12) = 23 cents.</p><p>Again, this unison vector defines a periodicity block of 12 notes: every<br/>note in the infinite chain is equivalent to one and only one note in the<br/>12-tone scale through transpositions of 23 cents.</p><p>Any questions? If not, I will continue with the 2-D (5-limit) case next<br/>time.</p></div><h3><a id=5351 href="#5351">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/1999 3:04:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; *A gentle introduction to Fokker periodicity blocks, part 1*</p><p>Hey, thanks for the intro!</p><p>&gt; Any questions? If not, I will continue with the 2-D (5-limit) case next<br/>&gt; time.</p><p>How about a history lesson?  Where did this Fokker periodicity block notion<br/>come from?  After a first reading, it seems to just be another way of saying<br/>that you can have a closed circle of pitches with some specified relation,<br/>and that&apos;s equivalent to any other closed circle on the same specified<br/>relation, by transposition through some interval.</p><p>Is that right?</p><p>Perhaps a nice lesson would be how this relates to (or is different from)<br/>the classical circle of fifths and/or cycle of intervals.  What is the<br/>utility of this method of looking at pitch relations?  I.e., in what context,<br/>for what purpose would I want to use it, as opposed to (say) some other<br/>method of looking at pitch relations?</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=5353 href="#5353">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/1999 3:40:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; in 5-limit JI we need two unison vectors at a time, which would turn the<br/>&gt; infinite sheet of fifths and thirds into a finite torus</p><p>Oh.

I<br/>Open question to the list__some folks with very good hearing (darren burgess)can discern a deviation of 3hz. What can you discern? i can feel the difference when tuning....<br/>How does one overcome the compensation factor that sometimes people experience when tuning? When tuning what portion of the arc is most satisfying when tuning.</p><p>Pagano</p></div><h3><a id=5358 href="#5358">ðŸ”—</a>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>10/8/1999 7:02:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/8/99 7:48:20 PM, <a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;From: &quot;patrick pagano&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul that is by far your most informative and enjoyable<br/>&gt;post.</p><p>Yes, one of Paul&apos;s best &amp; warmest.
