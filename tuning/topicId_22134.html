Consequently this array contains in the first row the<br/>values 1:1 9:8 5:4 4:3 3:2 5:3 15:8 representing the intervals C:C C:D C:E<br/>C:F C:G C:A C:B.</p><p>   ( I would add the fourth row contains as<br/>     F:F F:G F:A F:B F:C F:D F:E the intervals<br/>     1:1 9:8 5:4 45:32 3:2 27:16 15:8<br/>     which are the following harmonics of F :<br/>     1 9 5 45 3 27 15. See forward. )</p><p>When you talk about interval you refer always, if I have well understood,<br/>to such concrete pitch dyads like</p><p>   D:D = 1:1<br/>   F:G = 9:8<br/>   G:B = 5:4<br/>   B:E = 4:3</p><p>and you distinguish the tone 9/8 with the interval C:D = 9:8 for a scale is<br/>a concrete acoustical object made with pitches. So the tones 1 9/8 5/4 4/3<br/>3/2 5/3 15/8 are only &quot;designators&quot; of pitch heights &quot;measured&quot; from the<br/>tonic pitch.</p><p>I have absolutely nothing against this viewpoint, but a &quot;mode&quot;, in my<br/>terms, is very different. Even using the expression &quot;musical mode&quot; it&apos;s<br/>essentially a mathematical object defined in the pure context of an<br/>algebraic structure. (It&apos;s what is astonishing to find closed numerical<br/>relations between a such complex axiomatic object and concrete pitch<br/>intervals used by musicians.)</p><p>Let us talk, for instance, about our 1/1 uses. For you, the tone 1/1<br/>represents the tonic while you use 1:1 with the unison intervals C:C or D:D<br/>or E:E . . . For me, in the context of a structure having &quot;modes&quot;, I talk<br/>always about the neutral element of that singular mathematical structure.<br/>As you know, the neutral element 1 or 0 is defined by the following<br/>property : for any x in the structure we have</p><p>   1 * x = x * 1 = x  (with multiplication)<br/>   0 + x = x + 0 = x  (with addition)</p><p>When I talk about unison I refer uniquely to that neutral element having to<br/>exist in the structured set of intervals, and that, without any reference<br/>to a tonic or a pitch height for I use always an internal composition law.<br/>And there is no place for pitches in a such model since it makes no sense<br/>to use an internal composition law (addition or multiplication) with pitches.</p><p>The pitch question may come afterwards when musical scales and &quot;sui generis<br/>modes&quot; are compared. I would like to remark however that the comparison is<br/>made between intervals : my intervals as elements in a mathematical<br/>structure and your intervals you understand as pitch indicators.</p><p>Perhaps the better way to understand my 1 or 1/1, when scales and modes are<br/>compared, would be to see it as representing the class of your intervals<br/>{C:C, D:D, E:E, F:F, G:G, A:A, B:B}. That class is the neutral element in<br/>the algebraic structure built on the classes of your concrete intervals.</p><p>I add there exist 49 concrete X:Y intervals in your matrix while it is<br/>partitioned in 19 interval classes. The following set of rationals<br/>represents that set of classes :</p><p>   {1, 16/5, 10/9,  9/8, 32/27, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 27/20, 45/32,<br/>       15/8,  9/5, 16/9, 27/16, 5/3, 8/5, 3/2, 40/27, 64/45}</p><p>This set, with multiplication, is a gammier for all axioms of the gammier<br/>structure are respected. Besides, (since a gammier is an harmoid with<br/>supplemental axioms) there exist, as harmoid, an odd generator which is here</p><p>   &lt;1 3 5 9 15 27 45&gt;</p><p>  ( Cf. the precedent remark about<br/>    F:F F:G F:A F:B F:C F:D F:E<br/>    as harmonics of F. )</p><p>With the appropriate ordering you can then surely recognize the following<br/>array as identical to that one of your concrete pitch height intervals.<br/>However, I emphasize, there exist neither pitch reference nor concrete<br/>classes here : that are only classes of odd ratios modulo 2.</p><p>          3    27     15    1     9     5    45</p><p>    3     1    9/8   5/4   4/3   3/2   5/3  15/8<br/>   27   16/9    1   10/9  32/27  4/3  40/27  5/3<br/>   15    8/5   9/5    1   16/15  6/5   4/3   3/2<br/>    1    3/2  27/16 15/8    1    9/8   5/4  45/32<br/>    9    4/3   3/2   5/3  16/9    1   10/9   5/4<br/>    5    6/5  27/20  3/2   8/5   9/5    1    9/8<br/>   45   16/15  6/5   4/3  64/45  8/5  16/9    1</p><p>-----</p><p>Q. Is it the same stuff with only a more abstracted formulation?</p><p>A. I don&apos;t think so. A (concrete) scale spans a set of intervals<br/>   while a (virtual) structure spans a set of modes. The precedent<br/>   structured set of 19 intervals spans 84 distinct modes.</p><p>Q. What are these (sui generis) modes?</p><p>A. All ordered subsets of intervals X(i) such that any ratio</p><p>      X(i+1) / X(i)</p><p>   between two successive intervals in the subset (or the<br/>   limit 2) is an atom of the set.</p><p>   -- I recall my definition of an &quot;atom&quot; : any interval k<br/>      greater than unison that cannot be splitted in two other<br/>      intervals x and y greater than unison, where<br/>      x &lt; k and y &lt; k --</p><p>   -- In gammoids and gammiers the total amount of intervals<br/>      in any mode is always the same and atoms are synonymous<br/>      with steps --</p><p>-----</p><p>(Naturally, the properties of each mode are not equivalent particularly<br/>about harmonicity and transposability.

However the existence<br/>   itself of a such chord requires much more than 3 elements<br/>   having the ratio 4:5:6. In the relational paradigm an object<br/>   like a chord exist within a finite set S of intervals having<br/>   a partial composition law. If 3 elements &lt;a b c&gt; exist in S<br/>   such that a:b:c = 4:5:6 then &lt;a b c&gt; is a chord if and only<br/>   if the 7 intervals &lt;1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3&gt; exist in S,<br/>   otherwise &lt;a b c&gt; is called a discordance relatively to S. &gt;&gt;</p><p>You wrote in 21106 :</p><p>&lt;&lt; I don&apos;t understand this. Can you give a musical example?<br/>   For instance, in the key of C major, is the G major chord<br/>   a discordance? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Absolutely not. Any chord being a subchord of 1:5:3:15:9 or its dual (in<br/>any mode or combination of modes) in the gammier &lt;1 3 5 9 15&gt; is concordant<br/>: so not only any major and minor triads but also any maj7, min7, 6 and<br/>min6 tetrads  or maj9 and min9 pentads. This is the constitutive harmony of<br/>that gammier.</p><p>The other chords are discordant. That is the extension harmony relatively<br/>to that gammier. For instance, the triad G B D F, the dominant 7th chord on<br/>G, is discordant not only for F = 21/16 (near from 4/3) don&apos;t exist<br/>precisely in the set, but for the intervals 7/6, 7/5, 7/4 (and reverses)<br/>don&apos;t exist in the set. The tones (my &quot;tons&quot;) 7/6 and 7/4 are near from 6/5<br/>and 16/9 but the triton 7/5 appears more easily as a stranger. In the<br/>following matrix I retained the notes in the key of C major and its<br/>relative A minor.</p><p>       1  5  3 15  9</p><p>   1   C  E  G  B  D   (?)<br/>   5   -  C  -  G  -<br/>   3   F  A  C  E  G<br/>  15   -  F  -  C  -<br/>   9   -  D  F  A  C</p><p>We see clearly the distinction between the major tone D = 9/8 and the minor<br/>tone D = 10/9 in the two following submatrices showing the major harmony in<br/>the key of C major (with an extension for F = 21/16)</p><p>       1  5  3 15  9    21</p><p>   1   C  E  G  B  D   (F)<br/>   3   F  A  C  E  G</p><p>and the minor harmony in the relative key of A minor</p><p>       5 15</p><p>   1   E  B<br/>   5   C  G<br/>   3   A  E<br/>  15   F  C<br/>   9   D  A</p><p>Since G7 is discordant, the F in (G B D F) may not appear on a row of the<br/>matrix. Its place indicated by (?) outside the matrix corresponds to the<br/>harmonic 7 of G and then would have to correspond to the odd 21 in the<br/>generator. As you know the 21 --&gt; 5 and 15 --&gt; 1 resolution way of that<br/>discordance were abundandtly used in the tonal music.</p><p>The chord G7 is not discordant in itself : the discordance is not a<br/>microtonal property but a macrotonal property (i.e. depending of context<br/>configuration). For instance, in the gammier &lt;3 5 7 15 21&gt; which is the<br/>minimal structure containing the blues mode, the chord G7 is not a<br/>discordance for the internal intervals spanned by the dominant 7th chord is<br/>a subset of that gammier.</p><p>-----</p><p>Hoping it&apos;s more clear.</p><p>Maybe the next step would be I would write a developed text about my<br/>musical interval concept which uses a three levels definition :<br/>parametrical (as used in acoustics), relational (as I use it in algebra)<br/>and functional (as we have to use to explain why intervals are used in music).</p><p>Probably I will not have time for that before june or july.</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=22137 href="#22137">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/4/2001 9:32:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Pierre Lamothe &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have finally found time to continue with this thread.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You wrote in 21106 :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; but . . . do you agree with how I understand your definition<br/>&gt;    of &quot;interval&quot;, as I characterized with the Zarlino JI scale<br/>&gt;    example? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure really how you understand my definition since you use<br/>the term<br/>&gt; &quot;scale&quot; while I use the term &quot;mode&quot; in a mathematical sense.

For me, in the context of a structure having &quot;modes&quot;, I<br/>talk<br/>&gt; always about the neutral element of that singular mathematical<br/>structure.<br/>&gt; As you know, the neutral element 1 or 0 is defined by the following<br/>&gt; property : for any x in the structure we have<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    1 * x = x * 1 = x  (with multiplication)<br/>&gt;    0 + x = x + 0 = x  (with addition)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I talk about unison I refer uniquely to that neutral element<br/>having to<br/>&gt; exist in the structured set of intervals, and that, without any<br/>reference<br/>&gt; to a tonic or a pitch height for I use always an internal<br/>composition law.<br/>&gt; And there is no place for pitches in a such model since it makes no<br/>sense<br/>&gt; to use an internal composition law (addition or multiplication) with<br/>pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pitch question may come afterwards when musical scales and &quot;sui<br/>generis<br/>&gt; modes&quot; are compared.</p><p>&gt; Q. What are these (sui generis) modes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A. All ordered subsets of intervals X(i) such that any ratio<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       X(i+1) / X(i)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    between two successive intervals in the subset (or the<br/>&gt;    limit 2) is an atom of the set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    -- I recall my definition of an &quot;atom&quot; : any interval k<br/>&gt;       greater than unison that cannot be splitted in two other<br/>&gt;       intervals x and y greater than unison, where<br/>&gt;       x &lt; k and y &lt; k --</p><p>You&apos;ll have to refine this definition, because clearly any interval<br/>can be split into two smaller intervals.</p><p>&gt; (Naturally, the properties of each mode are not equivalent<br/>particularly<br/>&gt; about harmonicity and transposability. Historically, the reduction<br/>to a<br/>&gt; bimodal system in the tonal language corresponds, I presume, to an<br/>emphasis<br/>&gt; on these  properties since the modes retained maximize it.)</p><p>Can you please demonstrate this maximization? (As you know, I have a<br/>different point of view on this issue, but I&apos;m more than interested in<br/>yours.)</p><p>&gt; --------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                     II<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Quoting what I wrote :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; The ratio 4:5:6 is also synonynous with the major quality<br/>&gt;    of a chord in relational paradigm. However the existence<br/>&gt;    itself of a such chord requires much more than 3 elements<br/>&gt;    having the ratio 4:5:6. In the relational paradigm an object<br/>&gt;    like a chord exist within a finite set S of intervals having<br/>&gt;    a partial composition law. If 3 elements &lt;a b c&gt; exist in S<br/>&gt;    such that a:b:c = 4:5:6 then &lt;a b c&gt; is a chord if and only<br/>&gt;    if the 7 intervals &lt;1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3&gt; exist in S,<br/>&gt;    otherwise &lt;a b c&gt; is called a discordance relatively to S. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You wrote in 21106 :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; I don&apos;t understand this. Can you give a musical example?<br/>&gt;    For instance, in the key of C major, is the G major chord<br/>&gt;    a discordance? &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely not. Any chord being a subchord of 1:5:3:15:9 or its dual<br/>(in<br/>&gt; any mode or combination of modes) in the gammier &lt;1 3 5 9 15&gt; is<br/>concordant<br/>&gt; : so not only any major and minor triads but also any maj7, min7, 6<br/>and<br/>&gt; min6 tetrads</p><p>A min6 tetrad is, for example, D F A B. How can that be expressed as a<br/>subchord of 1:5:3:15:9 or its dual?</p><p>But you seem to be agreeing, then, that a 4:5:6 chord would be<br/>concordant regardless of its position relative to the mode . . . no?</p><p>And a practical problem with your theory would be the maj6/9 chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The chord G7 is not discordant in itself : the discordance is not a<br/>&gt; microtonal property but a macrotonal property (i.e. depending of<br/>context<br/>&gt; configuration). For instance, in the gammier &lt;3 5 7 15 21&gt; which is<br/>the<br/>&gt; minimal structure containing the blues mode, the chord G7 is not a<br/>&gt; discordance for the internal intervals spanned by the dominant 7th<br/>chord is<br/>&gt; a subset of that gammier.</p><p>I&apos;m very interested in discussing this further but it&apos;s clear that in<br/>musical practice, the &quot;blues mode&quot; uses neutral thirds much more<br/>frequently than subminor thirds as you would have it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hoping it&apos;s more clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe the next step would be I would write a developed text about my<br/>&gt; musical interval concept which uses a three levels definition :<br/>&gt; parametrical (as used in acoustics), relational (as I use it in<br/>algebra)<br/>&gt; and functional (as we have to use to explain why intervals are used<br/>in music).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably I will not have time for that before june or july.</p><p>I&apos;ll wait in anticipation!</p></div>
