<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>open letter re tuning list bullshit</h1><h3>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2002 12:39:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>Its completely selfish of me to let you know that I&apos;m hoping<br/>you&apos;ll keep your on-list presence up on one of the tuning lists.<br/>I just feel something is missing when the real composer / free<br/>thinkers are missing, and you&apos;re recent contributions have also<br/>been very relevent to me in my current place. I have no idea<br/>whether there was anything substantive behind this particular<br/>argument but for what its worth, I&apos;m on the side of those who&apos;ve<br/>been paying the dues, and that certainly includes you.</p><p>Bob</p></div>
