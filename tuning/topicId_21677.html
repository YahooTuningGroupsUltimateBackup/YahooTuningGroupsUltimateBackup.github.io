There&apos;s<br/>&gt; no<br/>&gt; need to throw out things that work.  5 equally spaced lines doesn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; work well for anybody.</p><p>Dear Pitchcolor (Aaron),</p><p>One thing that happens on this list is that every so often someone new to the<br/>lists reinvents the wheel.  And accordingly, much of this discussion has been<br/>held before, and no FAQ or pouring over the archives would change this<br/>situation much.  It&apos;s normal, and healthy, to think outside the frame, to<br/>imagine new ways.  Each time around brings new people in, and offers new<br/>perspectives to others.</p><p>First off Julian Carrillo chucked the 5 lines for his 96-tET scale.<br/>Unfortunately, for me, I have to rewrite it completely when he produce<br/>Carrillo&apos;s music, because trained musicians can&apos;t read it.  Lots of<br/>handwriting with a pencil (thank heavens for manuscript paper).</p><p>Secondly, 5 lines works great for me.  It&apos;s never let me down (at least until<br/>my eyes got worse requiring bifocals).  It&apos;s convenient and clear, tidy and<br/>comprehensible.</p><p>Since it is my business, to play and direct other people&apos;s music, 5 lines<br/>with cents deviations of 1200 possible (well I could you decimal points for<br/>even greater accuracy...), has been far and wide the best way to negotiate<br/>the vast seas of microtones.</p><p>I&apos;m not aware of more than a handful of people on this list that play other<br/>people&apos;s music with any regularity, if at all.  To compose prescriptively,<br/>there has to be a pharmacist that can decipher the doctor&apos;s prescription<br/>(trained musicians using their training).  To compose descriptively, as a<br/>blotter for the imagination in a letter to self, anything works that you<br/>enjoy.  Da Vinci wrote his diary in mirror-image...but he seems to have<br/>enjoyed it.</p><p>Tablature is ancient, and instrument specific.  That&apos;s how I compose,<br/>instrument specific, and I&apos;ve used it.  But tablature doesn&apos;t guarantee<br/>accurate intonation when a different wind or string player performs it.  It<br/>also doesn&apos;t guarantee that the blowing or resistance will be with the same<br/>harmonies as with multiphonics.  1200 divisions of the octave does.  It is<br/>also not unsightly since only a +/- number is associated with a note head, no<br/>other changes.  It mainstreams anything microtonal on the visual level.  (All<br/>right I admit it, I&apos;m using Finale now.)</p><p>A word about &quot;training&quot; -- it&apos;s not just the money and time spent in graduate<br/>school education and the sufferings of intense competitions, the speedy of<br/>acquisition of much new information and technically accomplished<br/>expressivity, it isn&apos;t even only an industry of people supporting familles.<br/>It is a connection with the first instrument masters back to the beginning of<br/>the instrument.  Teacher to teacher over centuries has eradicated bad habits<br/>the way antibiotics kill bacteria.  If you muck up notation with confusion<br/>(demonstrated in Gardner Read&apos;s multiplicity of notations in his book on the<br/>subject) even less will be done.</p><p>There&apos;s also the issue of timing.  Musicians really make hay with it, and my<br/>intuition says this is not the time for a notation revolution.  &quot;There&apos;s no<br/>reason to throw out things that work.&quot;</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2001 12:41:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Pitchcolor@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Abandoning 5 lines doesn&apos;t throw &quot;everything&quot; out the window.<br/>&gt; I agree that a new system should have continutity with existing<br/>&gt; notation, because there are things about existing notation that<br/>&gt; work.
