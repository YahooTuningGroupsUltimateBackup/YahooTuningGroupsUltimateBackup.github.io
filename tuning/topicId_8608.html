Two<br/>questions:</p><p>1. Does anybody know of any written recently for small mean-tome<br/>clavichord? (anybody want to write some?) Everything I&apos;ve got seems to<br/>need 5 octaves.</p><p>2. I have some 20th century Serbo-Croatian piano music that I love on<br/>clavichord; what tuning would be the most appropriate?</p><p>Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (<a href="mailto:jconrad@tiac.net">jconrad@tiac.net</a>)<br/>Music Minister, Calvary Baptist Church, Providence, RI<br/>Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br/>Piano and Harpsichord Tuner-Technician</p></div>
