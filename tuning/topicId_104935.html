I<br/>&gt; &gt; could use 60/49 and 49/40 (both about 351 cents) instead of 11/9, but that<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to add complexity and eliminate the eleven-ness of the darn thing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So don&apos;t ask me what that 357-cent neutral third is, but it&apos;s not an 11/9.<br/>&gt; &gt; :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because 13/11 * 14/11 = 3/2, 37 EDO tempers out 364/363. According to my<br/>&gt; &gt; spreadsheet, 37 EDO (using the patent val) also tempers out 2401/2400 (the<br/>&gt; &gt; breedsma, so the 49/40 and 60/49 neutral thirds are equated -- if you want<br/>&gt; &gt; to map the 357-cent neutral third to those intervals instead of 11/9).<br/>&gt; &gt; Those seem useful. Here are other commas that get tempered out (limiting<br/>&gt; &gt; myself to the 13 prime limit):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; |  17  1  -8 &gt;  11.45  393216/390625  W&uuml;rschmidt&apos;s  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; | -16 -6  11 &gt;  37.72                 Sycamore  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  1  -5   3 &gt;  49.17     250/243     Maximal  diesis<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; | -5  -1 -2  4 &gt;   0.72  2401/2400  Breedsma<br/>&gt; &gt; | 11   1 -3 -2 &gt;   5.36  6144/6125  porwell  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  6   0 -5  2 &gt;   6.08  3136/3125  middle  second  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  0  -2  5 -3 &gt;  21.18  3125/3087  major  BP  diesis<br/>&gt; &gt; | -5  -3  3  1 &gt;  21.90   875/864   keema<br/>&gt; &gt; |  6  -2  0 -1 &gt;  27.26    64/63    septimal  comma,  Archytas&apos;  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  1  -3 -2  3 &gt;  27.99   686/675   senga<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 11-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; |   5  -1  3  0 -3 &gt;   3.03   4000/3993   undecimal  schisma,  Wizardharry<br/>&gt; &gt; |  -7  -1  1  1  1 &gt;   4.50    385/384    undecimal  kleisma,  Keenanisma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  16   0  0 -2 -3 &gt;   8.39  65536/65219  orgonisma<br/>&gt; &gt; |   4   0 -2 -1  1 &gt;   9.86    176/175    valinorsma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  -3  -1 -1  0  2 &gt;  14.37    121/120    undecimal  seconds  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |   2  -2  2  0 -1 &gt;  17.40    100/99     Ptolemy&apos;s  comma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 13-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; |  3  0  2  0  1 -3 &gt;  2.36  2200/2197   2.36  Parizek  comma,  petrma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  2 -1  0  1 -2  1 &gt;  4.76   364/363    4.76  gentle  comma<br/>&gt; &gt; |  2 -1 -1  2  0 -1 &gt;  8.86   196/195    8.86  mynucuma<br/>&gt; &gt; | -1 -2 -1  1  0  1 &gt;  19.13   91/90    19.13  superleap<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t really know what a lot of those mean, but they&apos;re there if you want<br/>&gt; &gt; them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To see if I could exploit some of the nearly-just intervals in 37 EDO, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; done something like a billion attempts at using generators to create MOS<br/>&gt; &gt; scales. Unfortunately, few of them have reasonable size (say, 13 or fewer<br/>&gt; &gt; tones) and still take advantage of all -- or even many! -- of the great<br/>&gt; &gt; tones in the scale, and most of them are very improper.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At any rate, thinking I should try to do *something* to try out 37, I<br/>&gt; &gt; settled on an 11-note MOS that uses 11/8 as a generator. Here it is:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ! C:\Program Files (x86)\Scala22\37-EDO_generator11_8.scl<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  11<br/>&gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt;  162.16215<br/>&gt; &gt;  259.45945<br/>&gt; &gt;  356.75675<br/>&gt; &gt;  454.05405<br/>&gt; &gt;  551.35135<br/>&gt; &gt;  713.51350<br/>&gt; &gt;  810.81080<br/>&gt; &gt;  908.10810<br/>&gt; &gt;  1005.40540<br/>&gt; &gt;  1102.70270<br/>&gt; &gt;  2/1<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s strictly proper, and almost every mode of this scale has an 11/8,<br/>&gt; &gt; naturally, since that&apos;s the generator. Only this mode has a 3/2. There&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; mix of 11/9-ish neutral thirds, 5/4 major thirds, and 13/11 minor thirds in<br/>&gt; &gt; the other modes. There are no 14/11 major thirds. Interestingly, many modes<br/>&gt; &gt; have a 745-cent interval seems to go pretty well with the 551-cent interval<br/>&gt; &gt; -- I suppose it&apos;s like putting a 10/9 or 9/8 over the 11/8. The scale<br/>&gt; &gt; surprised me in a few ways that I haven&apos;t been able to properly exploit and<br/>&gt; &gt; play around with.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s a very brief ditty I did using this scale. It happened to work out<br/>&gt; &gt; to be about 37 seconds long, which seemed appropriate for 37 EDO, so I made<br/>&gt; &gt; it fit. I didn&apos;t exploit the other modes, so the melody mostly uses the<br/>&gt; &gt; sharp neutral third, sharp fifth, 11/8, and 8/5.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://soundcloud.com/jdfreivald/37-seconds">http://soundcloud.com/jdfreivald/37-seconds</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; Jake<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=104952 href="#104952">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2012 7:35:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs, good to see you here -- I thought you had dropped off. Since I<br/>don&apos;t mind the very-sharp 3/2, but I still want to use the kinda-sharp<br/>11/9, I think it makes the most sense to do it Battaglia-style (9&apos; is<br/>its own prime). I remember seeing people talk about that way of<br/>thinking, but had forgotten it. It suits the way I&apos;m considering the<br/>scales I&apos;ve generated in it. Thanks for the thought.</p><p>Monz, I had forgotten that 37 was the object of your recent<br/>discussion. I had just been looking through EDOs in a spreadsheet that<br/>calculates intervals and commas and the like (yes, I&apos;m the life of the<br/>party). I especially like your diagrams on the encyclopedia! Excellent<br/>view into what&apos;s going on.</p><p>One of the things I liked about dabbling in 37 is the perfect 11/8<br/>that can have a major second (a little flat) piled on top of it -- I<br/>haven&apos;t previously found myself liking 745 cents over the root, but<br/>when played on top of a pure 11/8 (551 cents) it sounds pretty good.<br/>It doesn&apos;t sound like an out-of-tune 3/2, as it sometimes does, but it<br/>still seems stretched somehow without being discordant. Anyway, I wish<br/>I had better capabilities to use 13+ tone scales, because I think this<br/>EDO could be really cool for extended scales.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=104956 href="#104956">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2012 4:55:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to Graham Breed for helping me finally track down the<br/>missing hyphen which was preventing that graph from loading.<br/>All is well now.</p><p>-monz</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Jake and Igs,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I posted here about 37-edo not too long ago.<br/>&gt; Have you seen my Encyclopedia page about it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/37-edo/37edo.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/37-edo/37edo.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... i should mention that for some reason the graph that is<br/>&gt; supposed to end the section &quot;Some 41-limit JI ratios<br/>&gt; mapped to 37-edo&quot; is not appearing ... i don&apos;t know why --<br/>&gt; the image file is uploaded to my website and the html code<br/>&gt; on the page seems to be correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p></div>
