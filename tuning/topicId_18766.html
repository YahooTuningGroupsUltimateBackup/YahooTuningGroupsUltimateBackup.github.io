I&apos;ll keep you posted if I find plans.<br/>It is such an amazing sounding instrument. It can&apos;t be too hard to<br/>construct, it&apos;s a 5.5 feet long cylinder, with what looks like a smaller<br/>cylinder as the mouthpiece, and I believe it only has three finger holes.<br/>But my failure rate at building useable instruments is considerable.</p><p>&gt; You know, I made two really incredible sounding Didgeridoos last<br/>&gt; year, with subtly different designs.  I did quite a bit of<br/>&gt; experimentation to get the right tone, but found the two designs to<br/>&gt; be very useful. The wax mouth-piece is crucial to the sound of the<br/>&gt; instrument. I would be happy to share my plans with anyone who wants<br/>&gt; to make one. But don&apos;t ask me how to circular breath! I&apos;m lame at it!<br/>&gt;<br/>I still can&apos;t circular breathe and play the didj at the same time. I can do<br/>either one independantly, put them together, it just doesn&apos;t want to happen.<br/>I keep hoping that some day, when I&apos;m not trying, it&apos;ll just happen<br/>naturally, as I am sure it should be.</p><p>&gt; On my end of things, I can convert just about any kind of audio<br/>&gt; format into the WAV format that I use. If I get stuff in AIFF, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; cool - easy to convert.

Not all<br/>of us have access to easily tuned samplers into which we can adequately<br/>represent, say, our 19-tet glass harmonicas or whatever. I do assume that<br/>MIDI will be a sort of basic platform since it can be controlled so nicely,<br/>but I think the project shouldbe able to include recordings too.
