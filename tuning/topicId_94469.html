I recall that there are 15 notes<br/>&gt; per octave.</p><p>The open strings were tuned to fifths, so the possible tetrachords can all be duplicated in an upper disjunct tetrachord. There was no fret at the 3:2! There was a fret at the Pythagorean M6, the scheme seems to be centered on open strings and at the 9:8. I am quite sure of the key position of the 9:8, as it not only has a fourth and fifth above, but I carefully listened and watched guys playing, and noticed that the thumb wrapped over as a kind of capo at the 9:8 seems to be a standard thing to do.</p><p>I have the entire original tuning as a Scala file, but I&apos;m loathe to give more than the frets which fall within the region of the first tetrachord, for above that I did not measure with such intense care.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be curious, for example, whether there&apos;s a neutral<br/>&gt; sixth step about a 3/2 up from 146 cents (say a 44/27,<br/>&gt; 845 cents); or maybe about a 4/3 up from that great<br/>&gt; 370-cent Rast third (say around 33/20 at 867 cents)?</p><p>The neutral sixth is there on the next string a pure 3:2 above, at<br/>845 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other questions might be 7/4 or 16/9 (especially<br/>&gt; given that 7/6!)? And maybe a 13/7 or so at a 3/2<br/>&gt; from 370 cents (which I&apos;ll join you in calling a<br/>&gt; 26/21)? I was picturing something for Rast like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   0    202   370   498   702   906  1072  1200</p><p>0...202....370....498....702....904....1072....1200<br/>is exactly the Rast, disjunct Rast, on the baglama. When it<br/>descends, as is typical, with a &quot;minor 7th&quot; (flatted second step of upper tetrachord), it is:</p><p>1:1, 9:8, 26:21, 4:3, 3:2, 27:16, 7:4, 2:1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;d be curious if between 4/3 and 3/2 there&apos;s<br/>&gt; maybe a step around 9/8 above 370 cents, or 574<br/>&gt; cents -- or maybe a 4/3 above 92 cents, around<br/>&gt; 588 or 590 cents?</p><p>Yes, above the 4:3 there is indeed a fret which corresponds to a whole step above the 26:21 and is very close to 7:5. When I get a chance to double-check it, I will post the data.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, given all the measurements you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; done, I&apos;d want to make this a question of<br/>&gt; &quot;Where are the 4/3 or 3/2 relationships that<br/>&gt; are easy to hear?&quot; -- as opposed to more<br/>&gt; measurements!</p><p>All the intervals are reduplicated at a 3:2, giving disjunct tetrachords, and by using the thumb as a capo on the 9:8, you can have either conjunct tetrachords, or the new pentachords made of the intervals between the 9:8 and the 27:16, and combinations thereof.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2010 11:06:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Other questions might be 7/4 or 16/9 (especially<br/>&gt; &gt; given that 7/6!)?

In the case of<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s Even Diatonic tetrachord, he first tuned<br/>the largest interval, or the characteristic interval,<br/>down from 4/3 by placing a bridge to locate ratio<br/>6/5. If all the strings have an overall length of<br/>1000.0 mm, then 4/3 would be located at 750.0<br/>mm, and 6/5 at 833.33 mm. Now, if one measures<br/>the short remaining string length of the 6/5 string, or<br/>the distance on the other side of the 6/5 bridge, it<br/>has a length of 166.67 mm. If one then divides this<br/>short length in half one gets 83.33. Now because<br/>833.33 mm + 83.33 mm = 916.66 mm, string length<br/>ratio 1000.00 mm / 916.66 mm simplifies to ratio<br/>12/11 = 150.64 cents. So, now in Greek ascending<br/>order, Ptolemy&apos;s Even Diatonic consists of interval<br/>ratios 12/11, 11/10, 10/9; or of frequency ratios 1/1,<br/>12/11, 6/5, 4/3.</p><p>So, by initially descending from 4/3 with the largest<br/>and therefore the characteristic interval of the<br/>tetrachord, and then by directly dividing the<br/>remaining string length section in half (or to<br/>whatever proportion one likes), this first step and<br/>the second step determine a descending direction<br/>of ratios.</p><p>The canon is a great scientific tool, but because of<br/>the rattling bridge problem, it never became a<br/>widely accepted musical instrument. The Arabian<br/>&grave;ud on the other hand, although just as accurate as<br/>a Greek canon, did evolve into a supreme musical<br/>instrument. The practicality of its moveable frets<br/>(like moveable canon bridges) caused musicians<br/>like Al-Farabi to rethink the process of constructing<br/>tetrachords with descending interval ratios.

There was no fret at the 3:2! There was a fret at<br/>&gt; the Pythagorean M6, the scheme seems to be centered on open<br/>&gt; strings and at the 9:8. I am quite sure of the key position of<br/>&gt; the 9:8, as it not only has a fourth and fifth above, but I<br/>&gt; carefully listened and watched guys playing, and noticed that<br/>&gt; the thumb wrapped over as a kind of capo at the 9:8 seems to be<br/>&gt; a standard thing to do.</p><p>Thanks for giving me exactly what I was asking: the &quot;upper<br/>disjunct tetrachord&quot; idea is a very helpful answer, and gives me<br/>some ideas about Persian as well as Turkish tetrachords and modes<br/>that might be available.</p><p>&gt; I have the entire original tuning as a Scala file, but I&apos;m<br/>&gt; loathe to give more than the frets which fall within the region<br/>&gt; of the first tetrachord, for above that I did not measure with<br/>&gt; such intense care.</p><p>Yes, I understand, when giving concrete figures in a Scala file,<br/>you want be as accurate as possible.</p><p>However, for my purposes, the information you give is perfect.<br/>I&apos;ll respond to some points in this post, and then write another<br/>article to respond to you and Cris on Ibn Sina&apos;s diatonic with<br/>septimal ratios (steps of 8:7-13:12-14:13).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;d be curious, for example, whether there&apos;s a neutral<br/>&gt;&gt; sixth step about a 3/2 up from 146 cents (say a 44/27,<br/>&gt;&gt; 845 cents); or maybe about a 4/3 up from that great<br/>&gt;&gt; 370-cent Rast third (say around 33/20 at 867 cents)?</p><p>&gt; The neutral sixth is there on the next string a pure 3:2 above,<br/>&gt; at 845 cents.</p><p>Ah, that reminds me of the one step out of the 15 per octave I<br/>might not have asked about: is there a step at around a 4:3 above<br/>146 cents, which would also be a 9:8 or so below 845 cents, say<br/>around 352/243 or 642 cents?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Other questions might be 7/4 or 16/9 (especially given that<br/>&gt;&gt; 7/6!)? And maybe a 13/7 or so at a 3/2 &gt; from 370 cents (which<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ll join you in calling a &gt; 26/21)? I was picturing something<br/>&gt;&gt; for Rast like: &gt; &gt; 0 202 370 498 702 906 1072 1200</p><p>&gt; 0...202....370....498....702....904....1072....1200<br/>&gt; is exactly the Rast, disjunct Rast, on the baglama. When it<br/>&gt; descends, as is typical, with a &quot;minor 7th&quot; (flatted second step of upper<br/>&gt; tetrachord), it is:</p><p>&gt; 1:1, 9:8, 26:21, 4:3, 3:2, 27:16, 7:4, 2:1</p><p>This is really interesting, and helps me emulate your instrument<br/>(more or less) in O3. For the ascending disjunct Rast, we have:</p><p>baglama:  0    202   370    498   702    906   1072  1200<br/>O3:       0    207   369    496   703    912   1073  1200<br/>        rast  dugah segah chargah neva huseyni evdj gerdaniye</p><p>For a typical descending from, which Ozan calls an &quot;acemli rast&quot;<br/>because of the minor seventh step acem, and using your suggested<br/>ratios on which the baglama has very small variations:</p><p>    1/1    9/8   26/21   4/3    3/2   27/16   7/4    2/1<br/>JI:  0     204    370    498    702    906    969   1200<br/>O3:  0     207    369    496    703    912    969   1200<br/>   rast   dugah  segah chargah  neva huseyni acem gerdaniue</p><p>A fine point which may tie in with some of Ozan&apos;s comments is<br/>that we have evdj, the high neutral seventh at 13/7, and acem,<br/>the minor seventh at 7/4, at around 103 or 104 cents apart --<br/>notably more than a Pythagorean limma at 90 cents, let alone the<br/>usual limma in O3 at 22/21 or 81 cents!</p><p>Similarly, and going directly to Ozan&apos;s point, we can consider<br/>the 7/6 step as kurdi, or a minor third step; and 26/21 as segah,<br/>the middle third, again with a distance of a bit over 100<br/>cents. One JI ratio might be 52/49 (103 cents), the difference<br/>between 7/6 and 26/21; in O3, it&apos;s about 104 cents.</p><p>Ozan&apos;s point was that if segah is in its high Turkish position a<br/>few cents below 5/4 (say 380 cents), then kurdi might be around<br/>13/11 (289 cents), as in one arrangement found in his 79-MOS; but<br/>if segah is lower, around 26/21, then kurdi would normally be<br/>lower as well, here 7/6. Your baglama is a good illustration!</p><p>Another fine point is that in the baglama tuning, that small<br/>semitone step in the version of Rast with a minor seventh,<br/>27/16-7/4, is very close to a just 28/27 or 63 cents. In O3,<br/>because the major sixth is a bit wider at around 22/13, we have a<br/>step of around 22/13-7/4, yet narrower at around 57 cents, which<br/>could be called a 91/88. This is, of course, one effect of the<br/>temperament, with the baglama&apos;s step very near the classical<br/>28:27 of Archytas probably just about optimal.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And I&apos;d be curious if between 4/3 and 3/2 there&apos;s maybe a step<br/>&gt;&gt; around 9/8 above 370 cents, or 574 cents -- or maybe a 4/3<br/>&gt;&gt; above 92 cents, around 588 or 590 cents?</p><p>&gt; Yes, above the 4:3 there is indeed a fret which corresponds to<br/>&gt; a whole step above the 26:21 and is very close to 7:5. When I<br/>&gt; get a chance to double-check it, I will post the data.</p><p>It sounds like you have a great Maqam Penchgah, then -- basically<br/>a form of Rast which often uses that raised fourth, which Ozan<br/>ideally would tune at 7:5 or so. In O3 it&apos;s around 577 cents, and<br/>indeed not too far from 7:5.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Again, given all the measurements you&apos;ve done, I&apos;d want to<br/>&gt;&gt; make this a question of &quot;Where are the 4/3 or 3/2<br/>&gt;&gt; relationships that &gt; are easy to hear?&quot; -- as opposed to more<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; measurements!</p><p>&gt; All the intervals are reduplicated at a 3:2, giving disjunct<br/>&gt; tetrachords, and by using the thumb as a capo on the 9:8, you<br/>&gt; can have either conjunct tetrachords, or the new pentachords<br/>&gt; made of the intervals between the 9:8 and the 27:16, and<br/>&gt; combinations thereof.</p><p>A few quick ideas occur to me, now that the only step I might<br/>want to confirm is that possible 642 cents or so.</p><p>The first is an interesting form of Hijazkar on rast which I<br/>often use in O3, although I&apos;m not sure what Ozan would say:</p><p>baglama:  0   92    370    498    702   ~792     1072   1200<br/>O3:       0   81    369    496    703    784     1073   1200</p><p>The second is that your baglama should have a great Maqam Huseyni<br/>that I think Ozan might really appreciate, starting on the 9/8:</p><p>baglama:  0    168   296   ~498    ~702    ~870   ~998    1200<br/>O3:       0    162   288    496     704     866    993    1200<br/>steps:   9/8  26/21  4/3    3/2    27/16   13/7    2/1     9/4</p><p>Here the sixth degree is sometimes lowered, for example in<br/>descending, we have an alternative form of:</p><p>baglama:  0   168   296   ~498    ~702    ~792    ~998    1200<br/>O3:       0   162   288    496     704     785     993    1200<br/>steps:   9/8  26/21  4/3    3/2    27/16   16/9    2/1     9/4</p><p>Also, there&apos;s a Maqam Kurdi, or actually Hijazkar Kurdi, on rast<br/>(Kurdi would be on the 9/8, dugah) with the low minor third and<br/>seventh:</p><p>baglama:  0   92    269    498    702   ~792    ~969    1200<br/>O3:       0   81    265    496    703    784     969    1200</p><p>Stating the baglama tuning in 53-commas, we have an interesting<br/>pattern: 4-8-10-9-4-8-10.</p><p>&gt; Oh, Margo, I forgot to mention that of course we should call<br/>&gt; the &quot;370 cent&quot; fretting here 26:21. This interval is one found<br/>&gt; in Ibn Sin&apos;s soft diatonic tetrachord, a tetrachordal division<br/>&gt; which is a stellar example of historical writers most certainly<br/>&gt; NOT playing number games, being perhaps the most physically<br/>&gt; simple and eminently practical division of the tetrachord of<br/>&gt; them all.</p><p>An interesting point that Cris clarifies, and I&apos;ll address more<br/>in another post, is that Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning often referred to as<br/>his &quot;soft diatonic,&quot; as in the Scala archive (avicenna_diat.scl),<br/>is actually 1/1-8/7-26/21-4/3, making the 26/21 all the more<br/>important.</p><p>&gt; When we have a contemporary example of a traditional<br/>&gt; instrument fretted to measurements which have been documented<br/>&gt; for some thousand years at least, and those measurements all<br/>&gt; ultimately derive from very simple and practical processes,<br/>&gt; only numerological superstition would prevent use from using<br/>&gt; traditional names for the intervals.</p><p>Yes, sometimes taking the theorists seriously and drawing the<br/>obvious connections is the most parsimonious way to slice with<br/>Occam&apos;s Razor. The devaluation of medieval Near Eastern and<br/>European theory can interfere with the empirical tests which<br/>anti-medievalists are so often holding up as an ideal.</p><p>&gt; In your case, this is an especially solid approach, as you<br/>&gt; temper with an intent to create a system with vertical<br/>&gt; harmonies, and the traditional name here immediately gives you<br/>&gt; the primes with which to work, very practical!</p><p>That&apos;s true, with the obvious caution that something like Maqam<br/>Penchgah is beautiful and melodically compelling quite apart from<br/>any polyphonic context. For example, in O3, we have a two-voice<br/>progression like this, which might be available on your baglama<br/>if there were some way of double-stopping or whatever so to<br/>combine the two relevant steps:</p><p>        577  703                            ~574?  702<br/>        207   0      or on the baglama(?)    202    0</p><p>Here we have a 26/21 expanding to a 3/2, which can sound like an<br/>interesting variation on a two-voice setting by the 14th-century<br/>European composer Guillaume de Machaut. It&apos;s very effective<br/>because a 26/21 does sound like a small or Zalzalian ditone, not<br/>exactly the same as an 81/64 or the like, but somehow &quot;in a<br/>similar category.&quot;</p><p>And in three voices:</p><p>       1073 1200                            1072  1200<br/>        577  703                            ~574?  702<br/>        207   0      or on the baglama(?)    202    0</p><p>&gt; -Cameron Bobro</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2010 7:24:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Cris and Cameron.</p><p>Cris wrote:</p><p>&gt; Cameron,</p><p>&gt; Please note carefully that Ibn Sina categorized the following<br/>&gt; tetrachord with ascending interval ratios 8/7, 13/12, 14/13, as<br/>&gt; Strong Genus Diatonic, No. 4, in &quot;La Musique Arab,&quot; Vol. 2,<br/>&gt; p. 148. The other two tetrachord categories he gives are Soft Genus<br/>&gt; Chromatic and Soft Genus Enharmonic.</p><p>Thank you for this critical information! In fact, for the last nine<br/>years almost, I had supposed that it was 14:13, 13:12, 8:7 -- or<br/>possibly 13:12, 14:13, 8:7 -- a form of what might now be called a<br/>septimal Persian shur or a very low Turkish Ushshaq or maybe a very<br/>low Arab Bayyati.</p><p>In fact, 8:7, 13:12, 14:13 is what I would call a bright Rast, if that<br/>term may apply to a form with the first step at 8:7 rather than a<br/>usual tone at 9:8. This is 1/1-8/7-26/21-4/3 or 0-231-370-498 cents.</p><p>In the O3 temperament, a form of Rast using this tetrachord (an<br/>asterisk shows a note in the higher chain of fifths) would be:</p><p>      |----------------|     |-----------------|<br/>     F#*    A    Bb*   B*   C#*     E    F*   F#*<br/>JI   1/1   8/7  26/21 4/3   3/2   12/7  13/7  2/1<br/>      0    231   370  498   702    933  1072 1200 O3    0    232   370  497   703    935  1073 1200</p><p>Of course, learning Ibn Sina&apos;s original form (compare<br/>avicenna_diat.scl in the Scala archives, which I&apos;ve been quoting for<br/>almost a decade) doesn&apos;t prevent me from also using various<br/>permutations including 28:26:24:21 (14:13-13:12-8:7) or 12:13:14:16<br/>(13:12-14:13-8:7), either of which I might use for Shur. But it does<br/>clarify the nature of his original, of which these are more like<br/>inversions (precisely so with 28:26:24:21).</p><p>[Cameron]</p><p>&gt; I know the &quot;orthodox&quot; order of the tetrachordal intervals of the<br/>&gt; ancient Greeks, but it&apos;s not clear to me what the equivalent would<br/>&gt; be for the medieval Islamic musicians- ascending, descending? And in<br/>&gt; a fair bit of reading on ancient tetrachordal music over the last<br/>&gt; few years, I haven&apos;t noticed anything giving a clear picture as to<br/>&gt; what extent the intervals of tetrachordal division were freely (or<br/>&gt; not) re-ordered in practice by the ancients and medievals.</p><p>I&apos;ve wondered about this also. We do know that medieval writers<br/>sometimes used permutations of ancient Greek tetrachords.

This is<br/>especially interesting to me because it&apos;s a distinction I make between<br/>two shades of Rast. However, since I know this is likely to be a<br/>detailed enough discussion just sticking to the ancient and medieval<br/>sources, why don&apos;t I put that digression aside for the moment.</p><p>First, let&apos;s look at Ibn Sina&apos;s Strong Diatonic, and then at a<br/>division given by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi maybe about 250 years later:</p><p>                                231    139     128<br/>                                8:7   13:12   14:13<br/>Ibn Sina Strong Diatonic:  1/1     8/7    26/21    4/3<br/>                            0      231     370     498</p><p>                                231    128     139<br/>Safi al-Din (Arslan):           8:7   14:13   13:12<br/>&quot;Soft&quot; Diatonic            1/1     8/7    16/13    4/3<br/>                            0      231     359     498</p><p>According to Dr. Fazli Arslan, Safi al-Din calls his tetrachord _qawi_<br/>or &quot;strong&quot; in the sense of diatonic; but also _daif_ or &quot;feeble, Ozan<br/>suggests that &quot;soft,&quot; taking the concept of the Greek _malakon_, might<br/>be a better Englishing.</p><p>While d&apos;Erlanger&apos;s Volume III might be good to check, Arslan does give<br/>string ratios of 64-56-52-48, which would simplify to 16-14-13-12, so<br/>if he&apos;s right, we do have a permutation of Ibn Sina.</p><p>While this could be seen as a small variation between two similar<br/>tetrachords, with Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din we also meet another<br/>permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s original tetrachord which we&apos;d clearly<br/>consider a different type of genus: Buzurg, also using steps of 8:7,<br/>14:13, and 13:12 in the lower tetrachord of a pentachordal genus:</p><p>             14:13     8:7     13:12    14:13   117:112<br/>              128      231      139      128      76<br/>Buzurg:   1/1    14/13    16/13     4/3      56/39   3/2<br/>           0      128      359      498       626    702</p><p>Here Ibn Sina&apos;s 8:7-13:12-14:13 or Safi al-Din&apos;s 8:7-14:13-13:12<br/>becomes 14:13-8:7-13:12.</p><p>Another form of Buzurg discussed by Safi al-Din has the lower<br/>tetrachord as a permutation of this last example:</p><p>             13:12     8:7     14:13    13:12    27:26<br/>              128      231      128      139      65<br/>Buzurg:   1/1    13/12    26/21     4/3      13/9   3/2<br/>           0      139      370      498       637   702</p><p>This time we have 13:12-8:7-14:13.</p><p>Aside from illustrating some medieval permutations of ancient or<br/>medieval tetrachords, these examples have a number of 26/21 steps.</p><p>[Cameron]</p><p>&gt; This question is of special interest to me as I use the enharmonic<br/>&gt; of Eratosthenes, which is definitely &quot;micro and macro&quot;tonal, and the<br/>&gt; ordering of the intervals makes a huge difference in the feeling of<br/>&gt; it. Since I tend to prefer conjuct tetrachords to disjunct these<br/>&gt; days, obviously different orderings can make for some very<br/>&gt; bunched-and-gapped resulting &quot;scales&quot;. Which is great, I just wonder<br/>&gt; if the ancients did such things in actual practice.</p><p>From Scala, I get that this tetrachord of Eratosthenes is<br/>40/39-20/19-4/3 (43-45-409 cents or so).</p><p>What the ancients may have done, I&apos;m not sure. In the medieval Islamic<br/>sources I&apos;d say there are some interesting examples of permutations of<br/>the kind we&apos;re discussing. And in modern Near Eastern theory and<br/>practice there are many examples we could discuss; here I&apos;m going in<br/>good part by writers such as Amine Beyhom, and I suspect that Ozan<br/>would take a similar view.</p><p>&gt; At any rate, the 26/21 is right there in the Strong Genus Diatonic,<br/>&gt; and the ultimate origin of the tetrachordal division could hardly<br/>&gt; have been anything other than the extremely simple process of<br/>&gt; dividing string lengths which is spelled within it. So I think it is<br/>&gt; the more reasonable as well as richer choice, as opposed to &quot;370<br/>&gt; cents&quot;. When I measured the song of a particular cuckoo, I called<br/>&gt; the result &quot;369 cents&quot;, but 26/21 is better for describing the<br/>&gt; fretting of a maqam instrument.</p><p>A curious thing is that while Safi al-Din&apos;s 8:7-14:13-13:12, maybe<br/>because it divides the upper 7:6 arithematically (14-13-12), has a<br/>very simple string ratio, 16-14-13-12, Ibn Sina&apos;s 8:7-13:12-14:13 can<br/>look rather more complicated on paper: 104-91-84-78, if I&apos;m right.</p><p>However, in practice: &quot;Start at the 1/1, and remove an eighth of the<br/>string length (i.e. 8/7). Now, starting at the 4/3, add a thirteenth<br/>of the string lenth (i.e. 26/21).&quot; And voila, there&apos;s our tetrachord.</p><p>A fine point is that while 370 cents very much makes sense as 26/21,<br/>of which 369 cents might be an approximation, Safi al-Din shows how<br/>369 cents could also be a basic ratio.</p><p>If we take 9:8 plus 11:10, we get 99/80 or 369 cents, almost identical<br/>to 26/21, and differing only by 2080:2079. So subtracting 14:13 from<br/>a 4:3 fourth and adding 11:10 to a 9:8 tone give almost the same<br/>interval.</p><p>Again, it&apos;s easy to envision a tuning instruction: &quot;Start at 9/8, and<br/>remove an eleventh of the remaining length.&quot; And there we have it.</p><p>All things being equal, I join you in finding 26/21 simpler and more<br/>intuitive.</p><p>Permutations in a modern maqam setting are fascinating to explore, and<br/>that could be another thread.</p><p>Again, thanks to both Cameron and Cris for your invaluable information<br/>about tetrachords and the acoustical instruments on which they may<br/>appear.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2010 4:04:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Isn&apos;t the age of which you speak also referred to as the Islamic Golden Age?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;c_ml_forster&quot; &lt;cris.forster@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re welcome, Cameron.
