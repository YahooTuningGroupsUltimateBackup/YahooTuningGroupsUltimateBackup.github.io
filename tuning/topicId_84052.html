It carried me to [(2^6)(3)(5)]^(-1) = 1/[(2^6)(3)(5)] = 0.00104166666.....= (1/960).<br/>I used this decimal number as a series adder without the premise of expecting musical tones along its expansion.</p><p>It was a surprise to notice that all or most JI tones appeared in the developed series, so I started to analyze it and prepared the attached excel pages.</p><p>I think it is an important finding no matter if the JI scales are not welcome scales as declared some musicians.</p><p>There are some interesting features:</p><p>-- Semitone factor values (Ratios between two consecutive tones) are rather uncommon for me excepting 16/15 that links E/F and B/2C, (15/8), (5/3), (3/2), (4/3), (5/4) and (9/8).</p><p>-- Semitone factors comply with the following  sequence:<br/>A B C D (16/15) A B C D  A B (16/15).</p><p>-- The number of adders comprised in the range C to E equals 60 while from E to A this number is 80; from A to B it is 100 and from B to 2C there are 120 adders, in this case there is a total increase of 120 x 0.0010416666.. = 0.125 regarding B = 1,875 = (15/8). Therefore 0.125 + 1.875 = 2 = 2C.</p><p>Similarly, since in the semitone interval C to C# there are 60 adders and C = 1, the frequency increase is given by 60 x 0.0010416666... = 0.0625. Hence, C# = 1 + 0,0625 = 1.0625 = (17/16) and so forth.</p><p>--- Other features, please examine the attached series in excel where I give more details.</p><p>May be this subject is important as a source of new musical parameters.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p><a href="mailto:piagui@ec-red.com">piagui@ec-red.com</a><br/>Lima, July 13, 2009</p></div>
