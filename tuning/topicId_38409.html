A<br/>concerted effort to avoid emphasis of the traditional intervals is<br/>based, of course, not on some presumed criteria regarding the quality<br/>of certain relationships, but rather upon the need simply to<br/>experience the new relationships, to become familiar with them and<br/>give them musical relevance.  This is an extension of the atonal bias<br/>described earlier, and is not unlike Schoenberg&apos;s advice in 1923<br/>to avoid major, minor and diminished triads, advice that may seem,<br/>especially to today&apos;s twelve-note composers, dogmatic and<br/>arbitrary.

I advocate an atonal, or non-scalar, approach for<br/>&gt; composers using microtonal chromatics, not simply out of aesthetic<br/>&gt; preference, but, more importantly, because of the simple but defining<br/>&gt; characteristic wherein &grave;notes are related only to one<br/>&gt; another.&apos;  Microtonal composers who restrict their music from the<br/>&gt; outset to preexisting diatonic schemes, and subject the pitches<br/>&gt; automatically to the overwhelming structural gravity of a fundamental<br/>&gt; tone, [ahem, the &quot;strength&quot; of the overtone series is tacitly<br/>&gt; acknowledged here&mldr;ed.] will risk being unable to hear each of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; new intervals independently and may therefore not have the richest<br/>&gt; palette available to them for writing, thereby limiting the scope of<br/>&gt; their musical innovations.  In fact, as will be demonstrated below,<br/>&gt; the use of a traditional diatonic idiom can make intervals as small<br/>&gt; as a twelfth-tone inaudible (see Example 6), and except in the case<br/>&gt; of justly-tuned tonality, there would seem to be no reason to use<br/>&gt; microtones in a manner in which they can&apos;t be perceived.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Conversely, the absence of the traditional prescribed<br/>&gt; intervallic hierarchies enables one to search freely and examine the<br/>&gt; new relationships.  Although any technique has its underlying bias,<br/>&gt; removing the prescriptions of tonality in this manner seems, more<br/>&gt; than any other approach, to allow the composer to &quot;start from<br/>&gt; scratch,&quot; and to use his/her ears and intellect to invent a<br/>&gt; compositional method.  With the creation of a new intervallic<br/>&gt; vocabulary such as the seventy-two note chromatic, such freedom from<br/>&gt; presumptions is crucial.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AND, page 188:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;As was suggested in Part 1, only when the composer begins to<br/>&gt; hear and use the new intervals independently from the traditional<br/>&gt; twelve can we say that a deeper level of microtonality has been<br/>&gt; attained and that a genuinely new language may have emerged.  A<br/>&gt; concerted effort to avoid emphasis of the traditional intervals is<br/>&gt; based, of course, not on some presumed criteria regarding the quality<br/>&gt; of certain relationships, but rather upon the need simply to<br/>&gt; experience the new relationships, to become familiar with them and<br/>&gt; give them musical relevance.  This is an extension of the atonal bias<br/>&gt; described earlier, and is not unlike Schoenberg&apos;s advice in 1923<br/>&gt; to avoid major, minor and diminished triads, advice that may seem,<br/>&gt; especially to today&apos;s twelve-note composers, dogmatic and<br/>&gt; arbitrary.

Some of my commentary clearly got out of<br/>hand as I got rather &quot;excitable...&quot;</p><p>However, I disagree that the discussion needs to be moved from this<br/>list where it started.  At the moment it *is* about the<br/>IMPLEMENTATION of composition using 72-tET, so it&apos;s not about a<br/>*multitude* of tunings, but just *one* but it *does* involved the<br/>theoretical basis of this system so could be on this list.</p><p>HOWEVER, it could *also* be on the MakeMicroMusic list, since it is<br/>now of a *practical* bent.

I see *noplace* in the<br/>article where diatonicity, however defined, comes up.
