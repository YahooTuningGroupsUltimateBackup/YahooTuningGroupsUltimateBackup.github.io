Ed Foote, where are you? &gt;&gt;</p><p>   Greetings,<br/>   I am in shock.  The 48 in rolling meantone? Palpitations, sweats, blurred<br/>vision and vertigo;  I probably need a hospital bed, with an IV in my arm,<br/>and probably a I and a V to go along with it......<br/>   To the stretch question, first.  There is stretch in all piano octaves,<br/>simply because of the inharmonic value of the partials emanating from a string.<br/>Do we notice it in the middle three octaves?  No, not as a rule.  However, if<br/>you are bringing the fundamental of a note into agreement with the first<br/>partial of the note one octave below,(what we call a 2:1), you will have an octave<br/>that is slightly wider than what you would get by simply doubling the lower<br/>note&apos;s fundamental frequency.  These octaves are heard as beatless, but<br/>technically, they are &quot;stretched&quot;.  Organs and synths do not do exhibit this quality<br/>unless intentionally expanded.<br/>    Doing an entire piano this way will stretch it out, but it will sound<br/>relatively lifeless to many listeners.  Common tastes influence those of us that<br/>produce tunings for money, and most of us cater to the market by finding some<br/>way to sharpen the treble as we go up.   Keeping the 2:1 arrangement for the<br/>middle of the piano, and then beginning to widen the octaves even more as we<br/>approach the ends,(in both directions), is a common treatment among tuners.  It<br/>brings the pitches closer to the non-linear way that human hearing seems to<br/>expect and produces more marketable product.<br/>   Many of us, (especially those who were taught by Bill Garlick) prefer to<br/>slightly increase the width of the temperament octave so that there is a smooth<br/>progression from center to end.  How much?  It is very hard to assign a<br/>numerical value, since different pianos require different amounts, but it tends to<br/>be somewhere between the 2:1 and a 4:2.  This allows all the intervals to be<br/>tempered in such a fashion that the soon-to-be stretching is already begun and<br/>no noticeable departure point will show itself.  While Bill&apos;s tuning is about<br/>as elegant as one can hope for, the differences between the above two<br/>approaches are almost academic.<br/>   Then there are those that lay the bearings of their temperament within a<br/>really wide octave.  The cumulative result is that the stretching compounds<br/>from a wide starting point and can get very wide in rapid order.  These tunings<br/>have a characteristic sound. The fifths are pure, the thirds are busier, the<br/>octaves are wide enough to slowly beat,(though the triple or quadruple octave<br/>may be pure).<br/>    Width (stretch) is a matter of taste.  What really makes a piano cook in<br/>a high energy jazz bar might seem a bit churlish in a Mozart recital, and what<br/>sounds solid and harmonious for a Beethoven sonata might sound anemic for a<br/>Rachmaninoff concerto.  Strings are weird, it is no surprise that those of us<br/>that wrestle with them daily form what might be called idiosyncratic feelings<br/>about their proper placement.</p><p>   Now, to the idea of the WTC as meaning &quot;wolves to consider&quot;,  I have to<br/>say that that sounds like a loony idea to me. Titling the piece in reference to<br/>a tuning style certainly tells us that he had a particular genre of tuning in<br/>mind.  I think it is plausible that Bach simply assumed the use of the then<br/>up-and-coming non-restrictive, Werckmeister ideas.  But if he had in mind a<br/>system of adaptive tuning from piece to piece, it makes no sense that he would not<br/>to have included information about such a radical idea. Even more<br/>implausible would be the idea he wanted everything to be Just.<br/>    We know that Bach employed dissonance as a compositional tool, (not just<br/>as a jibe at Silberman&apos;s 1/6 C organ tuning when he got the chance).  The use<br/>of it as a contrasting element in the WTC makes perfect musical sense.  The<br/>prelude in C# sounds dead as Tuesday night when transposed to C on a<br/>well-tempered tuning.   The JI advocates that believe total consonance was the aim of all<br/>tuning are, I think, fishing on the wrong side of the boat.  In Classical and<br/>later music, the harmonic contrast is where the hook lies.   Composers that<br/>used m2&apos;s in their harmonic construction were certainly not looking for<br/>consonance, regardless of what tuning is in place.<br/>   A meantone approach to the WTC is an interesting theory, but doesn&apos;t come<br/>with much musical logic, to me.  Play it like you like it, but don&apos;t be<br/>surprised if it doesn&apos;t sell.<br/>Regards,</p><p>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a>&quot;&gt;<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=45688 href="#45688">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2003 1:43:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt;    I am in shock.

Theorists have one angle, musicologists another, historians, another.<br/>&gt; Musicians don&apos;t seem to count on this list.</p><p>Please realize that my response here is not just a direct response to what<br/>Johnny has just said, so do not submit it to a point-by-point analysis in<br/>the current context.  However, I hope that on the whole what follows is an<br/>appropriate response to some of the issues Johnny is touching on.</p><p>Just to offer another angle on this, a musician (I would assume most<br/>musicians, eventually) may be compelled to experience something new.  In<br/>this case by &quot;new&quot; I don&apos;t mean a modern perspective so much, because any<br/>perspective already recognized as modern is already somewhat less than &quot;new&quot;<br/>in a person&apos;s experience.  Instead I refer to a spontaneous spark of<br/>absolute newness, and this is the very life of the musician (or historian,<br/>etc.).  Others can agree or disagree with such a spark, but there it is, and<br/>it becomes the musicians responsibility to give more life to that spark.</p><p>So to me a very helpful question when sorting these things out is to what<br/>degree the musician (or theorist, or historian) is in contact with what<br/>inspires them, and (or) to what degree they are compelled to carry out some<br/>process which will prove them in world.  I suspect it is usually some of<br/>both, and for myself it is an ongoing &quot;art&quot; to try to sort these two out<br/>from each other.</p><p>For myself, I have considerable interest in hearing Bach in ways that are<br/>close to what Bach heard himself.  I am also not compelled to ONLY hear Bach<br/>in this way, when I am inspired in other directions.  However I don&apos;t mind<br/>being clear when I am doing one and when I am doing the other, and<br/>clarifying that to my audience also strikes me as a good thing.  It strikes<br/>me as one possibility that some of the appearances of conflict that occur in<br/>the discourse on this list are actually misinterpretations of the angle of<br/>experience which inspires another persons approach, because another person&apos;s<br/>direction can be so different as to be entirely foreign and ultimately not<br/>even explainable.  In most cases I suspect it remains a mystery to each of<br/>us how just we are so different, and the need to justify or explain can<br/>baffle the very process of creation which is trying to happen.</p><p>I believe I see a lot of inspiration working in everyone on this list<br/>(certainly everyone I can think of off-hand).  Respect must include a<br/>respect for the irrational, for the spark of life that each of us sees in<br/>each other.  This kind of respect is awesome, i.e. it is an awesome<br/>experience of another person to feel this respect for their life, and it<br/>brings to rest my intellectual and academic considerations when I have this<br/>awesome respect.  With such non-academic (but not entirely anti-academic)<br/>respect as a starting point we can help each other to further clarify what<br/>each of us is after.  This will look a little different from a discourse<br/>rooted in an academic sort of respect.  It will be broader, deeper, more<br/>flexible.</p><p>To play a composition in a way in which it was not originally played is for<br/>many of us a growing edge and a requirement of our own lives.  Such might be<br/>the case for &quot;justifying&quot; Bach to more consonance, if it is not done as a<br/>historical statement, may be someone&apos;s true calling, because that is the<br/>call they hear when they hear Bach and when that meets their own experience<br/>of just tunings.</p><p>To say something is &quot;not possible&quot; often turns out to be somewhat less to<br/>the point than something else that could be said.  For example I might say<br/>that it is not possible for me to do a certain thing (and I might be wrong),<br/>or I might say that I have to the best of my knowledge never known anyonw<br/>who could do a certain thing.  Nonetheless amazing things can be achieved<br/>(athletically, musically, technically) that have never been achieved before,<br/>and I think this requires exactly the same kind of development from a human<br/>being as it requires to learn how to enter into a progressively more mature<br/>discourse.  It may be impossible to say that word &quot;mature&quot; without someone<br/>hearing a judgement, i.e. &quot;immature&quot;, yet maturing is something that does<br/>not have an ending point, and I am acutely aware of the incompleteness of my<br/>own maturing, and how exposed I am in where I am.</p><p>So back to the point of &quot;not possible&quot; why not leave it open as to what is<br/>possible?  Maybe even leave it open as a matter of principle, to give space<br/>to others who are inspired and mean no harm, and who actually have something<br/>to teach you, something which is almost inexpressible and even more so in a<br/>culture of right and wrong.  Academic rightness is only one way.  It may<br/>foster some things but it will kill others.  Personally I think we have had<br/>enough centuries of it by now that something else can have a turn.</p><p>&gt; I hope someday to put all the<br/>&gt; evidence together into a single book and that it sees the light of day.  In<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; meantime, my gut feeling is that people are spinning their intellectual<br/>&gt; wheels,<br/>&gt; often to the detriment of the music itself.  It is nothing personal, but<br/>&gt; scholarly honesty that propels me to respond at this time.  I hope no one<br/>&gt; takes this<br/>&gt; personally, but instead reexamines their prerogatives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone is free to say anything at anytime about anything.  But it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; make it right.</p><p>Many more things can be said and much more learned when the barrier of being<br/>right is removed.  Rightness in my own experience almost fully prevents any<br/>of my own development which is related to the true force of my own life.<br/>That force is something new and will not survive the experience of being<br/>divided by the blade of right and wrong.</p><p>But this is not an argument to justify being unclear.  Much more clarity can<br/>emerge when the true force of one&apos;s inspiration is recognized and<br/>distinguished.  The words will never be perfect, the questions never fully<br/>answered.  The fall of judgement is heard with a deep sigh followed by<br/>awesome growth of what life has to offer.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p><p>&gt; Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=45723 href="#45723">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2003 7:07:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; this is where i disagree with you. far from being a radical idea,<br/>the<br/>&gt; practice of retuning a meantone keyboard according to the tuning of<br/>&gt; the piece was *standard operating procedure* in most of europe for<br/>&gt; the preceding two centuries. have you been to many renaissance<br/>&gt; recitals lately?</p><p>Retuning a 1/4-comma keyboard would be particularly easy, and I&apos;m<br/>doing the WTC right now in that tuning.

It<br/>only relates to all other pieces by Bach.

Others speak of &quot;justifying&quot; Bach to more<br/>consonance,<br/>&gt; although this was a man whose reputations was built upon the<br/>dissonances and<br/>&gt; his temperings of consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bach&apos;s music is fast so it is not possible to tune up triads.  His<br/>music is<br/>&gt; chromatic, often using all 12 notes in a single piece, so just<br/>harmonies are<br/>&gt; not his dream for music.  It is not possible to practice adaptive<br/>tuning with<br/>&gt; it.  What&apos;s more, with any experience in performing this music, one<br/>soon<br/>&gt; realizes that playing apart of what the harpsichord is playing in a<br/>music like Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt; which ALWAYS has a harpsichord or organ creates a muddy sound that<br/>is ugly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Changing the composition to fit modern perspectives is the tail<br/>wagging the<br/>&gt; dog.

Is there anyway for any JI tuning to make that<br/>piece drip<br/>&gt; with consonance?</p><p>again, just to be sure we have it straight, i would be the *last*<br/>person to advocate a ji tuning for it, and i don&apos;t think anyone here<br/>would either. but yes, many chords in this piece *do* drip with<br/>consonance on a well-tuned organ (werckmeister iii included of course,<br/>d minor is quite nice).</p><p>&gt;      Are you making the case that the WTC was actually an excercise<br/>in JI,</p><p>nonononono. not even hafner was saying this.</p><p>&gt; thus, the tuning would be expected to be changed with each of the 24<br/>and  Bach<br/>&gt; decided not to say anything about it?  That he assumed people would<br/>know to<br/>&gt; pick up the wrench and retune for each of them?  Seems the mechanism<br/>to make that<br/>&gt; work would have been mentioned.</p><p>my only point was that for the most part, in 1500-1700, keyboard<br/>instruments were tuned in *meantone* and the accidentals were retuned<br/>according to the key of the piece to be played in. this part of<br/>hafner&apos;s argument has a lot of weight, i feel, though the others may<br/>not.</p><p>&gt;     Theory is fine, but I prefer to listen to the plausible<br/>alternatives for<br/>&gt; a piece and make the decision on what seems to work musically.<br/>Compare the<br/>&gt; prelude in C# using the normal 1/4 comma meantone moved over 1/2<br/>step with<br/>&gt; what it sounds like on a Werckmeister or Kellner,(or even a<br/>Kirnberger, if you<br/>&gt; like).   The piece goes dead as a mackerel without the wider thirds<br/>in the<br/>&gt; harmony.</p><p>are you doing this experiment on any instruments similar to those that<br/>existed in bach&apos;s day?</p></div><h3><a id=45744 href="#45744">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2003 12:00:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is the example you used in the 1999 thread, when I was arguing<br/>&gt; for the Scalatron thesis.
