I created<br/>my file called, &quot;Lepore, Walter&quot;.</p><p>I was also wondering why last names aren&apos;t listed first i.e. Doe,<br/>John instead of John Doe. It would sure be easier to find members by<br/>last name.</p><p>Although its not a big deal at this point. There aren&apos;t that many<br/>folders to search at this point in time.</p><p>Just a thought.</p><p>Regards<br/>Walter</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2003 11:46:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Can we take a moment to clean up the Files section?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually it was my first time visiting this section today.<br/>&gt;I created my file called, &quot;Lepore, Walter&quot;.</p><p>Heya Walter,</p><p>Just so you know, my rant wasn&apos;t because of your activity<br/>today.

In fact, he can make<br/>someone else the owner, even without asking. Paul did that do me on<br/>tuning-math, and after thinking about the situation I made some people<br/>into moderators. Because of the great tradition we&apos;ve established on<br/>tuning-math, I didn&apos;t ask either. For all I know some of our<br/>moderators don&apos;t know yet they are moderators.</p></div>
