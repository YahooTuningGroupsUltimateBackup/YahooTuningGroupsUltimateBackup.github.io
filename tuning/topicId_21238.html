That South India had a<br/>&gt; stronger British influence, and that tuning is closer to 12-equal.</p><p>you find more western instruments and western derived instruments such as the 12 ET shuti box<br/>(harmonium) and the violin which is only know making it into North indian music.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=21349 href="#21349">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>4/20/2001 4:52:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I think there has been quite a few people who have put up the 22<br/>&gt;shutis.

Cool!</p><p>As for this debate, i think every good Indian musician i&apos;ve ever<br/>heard uses a major third at 5/4 in most ragas. Haresh Bashki and i<br/>engaged in an intensive off-list conversation about this and, though<br/>we were both looking for a positive outcome, neither of us could feel<br/>justified in claiming that commatic differences between one raga and<br/>another in Indian musical practice, which are clearly observed, are<br/>equivalent to the outcome of any of the theoretical frameworks that<br/>have been proposed. Rather they appear to vary widely from one<br/>musical ghanara (or school) to another and different theories of<br/>what &quot;22&quot; is all about seem to have crystallized according to local<br/>expressive tendencies. 22 is an interesting outcome of one musician&apos;s<br/>(Bharata&apos;s, if I recall correctly) experiment over a thousand years<br/>ago. The particular sruti ratios usually proposed have the<br/>double &quot;advantage&quot; of an interpretation as a chain of 22 fifths, and<br/>as a 22-tone periodicity block in the 5-limit lattice (and the fact,<br/>maybe unrelated, that of 7-limit periodicity blocks, the greatest<br/>number seem to have either 22 or 171 notes). I wonder if perhaps a<br/>thousand other musicians contributed to modern Indian musical<br/>practice.</p></div>
