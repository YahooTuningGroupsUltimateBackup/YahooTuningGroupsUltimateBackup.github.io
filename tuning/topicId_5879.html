The acceptable difference here depends on<br/>whether the scale is used only melodically, in rapid counterpoint with<br/>inharmonic timbres, in long sustaining harmonies with harmonic timbres, etc.</p><p>&gt;I should note in this context that David Feldman has made a passacaglia (a<br/>&gt;prototype is described in his XH article) whose melody is a sequence of<br/>small<br/>&gt;number ratios with a product that is a very near unison  (I believe it is<br/>&gt;123201:123200).  A table of primes and factors is a good place to look for<br/>&gt;intervals like this.</p><p>Clearly this interval, 1/71 of 1 cent, qualifies as a unison vector under<br/>any reasonable definition.</p></div>
