Uh...sorry: just couldn&apos;t resist.</p><p>Kant at least deserves better.  Kant on music (slightly paraphrased):</p><p>&#x9;1) &quot;Not everybody&apos;s gonna like your riffs.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;2) &quot;You don&apos;t need words to dig the music: it&apos;s like birdsong, man.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;3) &quot;You keep playing the same thing over and over, you follow too<br/>&#x9;    many rules, and people gonna drowse off.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;4) &quot;Them birds, they don&apos;t got no rules.&quot;</p><p>[Bortion, Tina., &quot;The Concept of the Analytic and Synthetic in Kant&apos;s<br/>Aesthetic of Jazz&quot; in Proceedings of the Third Annual Symposium on<br/>Music as Autoeroticism.  Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987.]</p><p>Quoted at length (Critique of Judgement, tr. James Creed Meredith)<br/>DANGER--BORING PROSE!--DANGER:</p><p>&#x9;   It is not to be assumed that even the quality of the sensations<br/>&#x9;agrees in all subjects, and we can hardly take it for granted that<br/>&#x9;the agreeableness of a colour, or of the tone of a musical instrument,<br/>&#x9;which we judge to be preferable to that of another, is given a like<br/>&#x9;preference in the estimate of every one.</p><p>  &#x9;   Assuming vibrations [cause] sound, and, what is most important,<br/>&#x9;that the mind not alone perceives by sense their effect in stimulating<br/>&#x9;the organs, but also, by reflection, the regular play of the<br/>&#x9;impressions (and consequently the form in which different<br/>&#x9;representations are united)-which I, still, in no way doubt-then<br/>&#x9;colour and tone would not be mere sensations. They would be nothing<br/>&#x9;short of formal determinations of the unity of a manifold of<br/>&#x9;sensations, and in that case could even be ranked as intrinsic<br/>&#x9;beauties.</p><p>&#x9;  Flowers are free beauties of nature. Hardly anyone but a botanist<br/>&#x9;knows the true nature of a flower, and even he, while recognizing in<br/>&#x9;the flower the reproductive organ of the plant, pays no attention to<br/>&#x9;this natural end when using his taste to judge of its beauty....<br/>&#x9;[these] are self-subsisting beauties which are not appurtenant to any<br/>&#x9;object defined with respect to its end, but please freely and on their<br/>&#x9;own account...We may also rank in the same class what in music are<br/>&#x9;called fantasias (without a theme), and, indeed, all music that is<br/>&#x9;not set to words.</p><p>&#x9;   Bird&apos;s song, which we can reduce to no musical rule, seems to have<br/>&#x9;more freedom in it, and thus to be richer for taste, than the human<br/>&#x9;voice singing in accordance with all the rules that the art of music<br/>&#x9;prescribes; for we grow tired much sooner of frequent and lengthy<br/>&#x9;repetitions of the latter. Yet here most likely our sympathy with the<br/>&#x9;mirth of a dear little creature is confused with the beauty<br/>&#x9;of its song, for if exactly imitated by man (as has been sometimes<br/>&#x9;done with the notes of the nightingale) it would strike our ear as<br/>&#x9;wholly destitute of taste.</p><p>&quot;A chuckle a day keeps pomposity away.&quot;</p><p>--Mark</p><p>Rick Tagawa &lt;<a href="mailto:ricktagawa@earthlink.net">ricktagawa@earthlink.net</a>&gt; wrote on Monday, 22 Apr 2002 11:34:<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Nietzsche and &quot;Temperament&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Our understanding is a surface power; it is superficial.
