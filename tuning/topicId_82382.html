What do you think?</p><p>Interesting question.  Actually I think there are two questions<br/>here; one about the evolution of just intonation harmony, and<br/>another about the evolution of temperaments used to approximate<br/>it.</p><p>First, the evolution of harmony.  We know most musical<br/>traditions simly didn&apos;t employ it, at least not in an organic<br/>fashion.  Outside of Europe and prior to the 12th century, music<br/>was primarily monophonic or heterophonic.</p><p>Organum was the birth of 3-limit harmony, which is a 1-D system.<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organum">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organum</a><br/>About 250 years later, the 5-limit was introduced:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contenance_Angloise">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contenance_Angloise</a></p><p>Though Euler and others theorized about the 7-limit, tetradic<br/>music didn&apos;t emerge in practice until the late 19th century,<br/>in the French impressionist and African-American forms.<br/>(I&apos;m unaware of direct cross-pollination between these schools<br/>prior to Gershwin, but suspect it was taking place from the<br/>outset).</p><p>However it is hard to justify these styles as 7-limit styles,<br/>or at least, their principle tetrads are not 7-limit o- and<br/>utonalities.  Rather, they are the most consonant tetrads found<br/>in 12-ET -- approximations of 8:10:12:15, 10:12:15:18, 4:5:6:7,<br/>5:6:7:9, among others.</p><p>Harry Partch is apparently the first musician to systematically<br/>employ the 11-limit.</p><p>Now, about the rank of temperaments supporting this music.<br/>Temperaments by definition must be of lower rank than the<br/>harmony they support.  So the above gives upper bounds on which<br/>temperaments were in use.  Chains of pure (or not systematically<br/>tempered) 5ths were probably the most common tuning systems<br/>throughout the world.  Certain African and Eastern traditions<br/>may have been employing 5-, 7-, and 12-ET for several hundred<br/>years.  In Europe, the first extant description of a systematic<br/>tempering of these 5ths dates from the late 1500s; about<br/>150 years after 5-limit triads were introduced in song.</p><p>I expect there were a string of theorists noticing non-meantone<br/>temperings of the chain of 5ths (Huygens, Newton ... Helmholtz),<br/>but the first thorough inventory of linear temperaments with<br/>5th-based generators I know of was due to Bosanquet (1876).<br/>Fokker was apparently the first to understand tempering as<br/>reducing the rank of just intonation.  Erv Wilson was apparently<br/>one of the first to explore linear temperaments with non-5th<br/>generators.  Then, the recent explosion you mention, which<br/>took place on this mailing list, in which the full universe of<br/>temperaments was delineated (no pun intended).  Paul Erlich,<br/>Paul Hahn, Graham Breed, Dave Keenan, and Gene Ward Smith were<br/>especially instrumental in this between about 1997 and 2006.</p><p>Does this answer your questions?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=82386 href="#82386">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 3:43:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please tell me what is a 2D or 3D tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the first time I heard mention of this - or I forgot -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris</p><p>Chris, the answer is slightly involved, but has been given to<br/>you several times in the past, by myself and others, both onlist<br/>and offlist.

It hasn&apos;t rocked the world yet but probably more of us are using different rank 2 temperaments now than ever before. That&apos;s probably a result of the internet.  It lets the minority who might be interested in this kind of thing get in touch with each other.  Retunable digital synthesizers help as well.</p><p>Yes, there are old records of Pythagorean tuning, from Mesopotamia, China, and the actual Pythagoreans.  The idea persisted around Eurasia.  Some of the references could be taken as implying schismatic temperament but there was nothing explicit until Riemann, or somebody, in the 19th Century.</p><p>It certainly looks like a string of great thinkers -- including Euler and Newton -- studied mathematical music theory without discovering any rank 2 tunings beyond meantone and maybe schismatic.  I&apos;ve compared the temperament explosion to a paradigm shift.  During the meantone era, European theorists treated music as following meantone or 5-limit JI rules.  Any conflicting system would have been dismissed as useless or unmusical.  So, really, the idea was frozen -- meantone in Europe and Pythagorean outside.</p><p>You could maybe treat Vicentino as an exception.  Though he didn&apos;t describe it this way, his enharmonic system is really rank 2 with a neutral third generator.</p><p>If anybody has other counter examples, let&apos;s see them!</p><p>Back to the 19th Century.  A group of German theorists, including Riemann and most notably Helmholtz, understood schismatic temperament.  They were also in touch with Bosanquet, who made schismatic organs, and developed a system of classifying equal temperaments according to fifth generators.  Still, though, at the end of the 19th century rank 2 temperaments, and tunings in use, were exclusively variations of Pythagorean or meantone fifths.</p><p>Next is Shohe Tanaka.  He obviously wasn&apos;t German but you can still put him in the German school.  He showed that a kleisma &quot;unison vector&quot; (without that name) leads to a minor third generator.  But this was only a step towards 53 note equal temperament.</p><p>The kleisma was rediscovered by Larry Hanson, who designed a keyboard around the implied temperament.  Around the same time we have Erv Wilson adding more prime approximations to meantone and schismatic and designing keyboards around them and George Secor publishing an article on miracle temperament (without the name) as well as considering and rejecting other systems such as magic.  I think these people constitute a school of thought.  They knew enough about rank 2 temperaments to have started the explosion but interest seems to have dwindled.</p><p>There are other (obscure) examples before the internet school.  I don&apos;t know much about them though.  There&apos;s Negri (19&amp;29) published in 1986.  O&apos;Connell&apos;s phi tuning, currently under discussion, is essentially rank 2 although he equalized it.  Balzano and Zweifel I think used rank 2 constructions to get scales from equal temperaments. Rothenberg (earlier) did something similar as well but didn&apos;t publish.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Paul Erlich&apos;s paper on what we now call pajara.   This is important because it describes a system where the period divides the octave (equivalence interval).  A full theory of rank 2 temperaments has to consider such cases but they&apos;d been ignored before.  A group of us connected by the internet took it from there.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=82392 href="#82392">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 6:48:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Could it be placed into the xenharmonic wiki?</p><p>I have read that fairly well.</p><p>On Sat, Mar 28, 2009 at 6:43 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Chris Vaisvil<br/>&gt; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Please tell me what is a 2D or 3D tuning?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is the first time I heard mention of this - or I forgot -<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris, the answer is slightly involved, but has been given to<br/>&gt; you several times in the past, by myself and others, both onlist<br/>&gt; and offlist.

Temperaments work the same way.  12-ET is rank 1<br/>because all you need is the semitone.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=82399 href="#82399">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 8:48:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll read it - thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At this moment I don&apos;t know that the &quot;D&quot; stands for</p><p>Dimension.  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=82400 href="#82400">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 8:49:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so the &quot;D&quot; refers to the dimensions in the figures on the diagrams<br/>&gt; of note relationships?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=82404 href="#82404">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2009 5:32:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl?</p><p>Thanks a lot for your suggestions.</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt; I expect there were a string of theorists noticing non-meantone<br/>&gt; temperings of the chain of 5ths (Huygens, Newton ...

I don&apos;t know if I succeeded in doing it; someone commented that it was an &quot;exercise of style&quot;, and this left me really surprised, as I have quite no ambition to appear as  a man of letters, let alone in English language; the &quot;style&quot; here is just that of Aaron and Zarlino.</p><p>&gt;Question: Aron inconsistently entitled his chapter 40 XXXX and the &gt;chapter 41 XLI . Is for consistency that you translated the latter &gt;as XXXXI  or are we reading from different originals?</p><p>For this translation I used a transcription from the Thesaurus Musicarum Italicarum site; the relevant page is here:<br/><a href="http://euromusicology.cs.uu.nl:6334/dynaweb/tmiweb/a/aartos/@Generic__BookView;cs=default;ts=default;lang=it">http://euromusicology.cs.uu.nl:6334/dynaweb/tmiweb/a/aartos/@Generic__BookView;cs=default;ts=default;lang=it</a><br/>It appears the text is taken from the 1523 and 1529 editions and reports &quot;XXXXI&quot; for the chap 41 of the second book. I have no access to the original books for those editions. I have got reproductions of the 1531 and 1539 editions, where the chapters are numbered as you report. There is no error anyway as both forms represent the 41 exactly<br/>Anyway, I think the use of &quot;XXXX&quot; for 40, and &quot;XLI&quot; for 41 is not a real inconsistence for Aaron&apos;s part . While the common modern use for Roman numeration is the subtractive form , in late Middle-Ages and Renaissance the extended form was still in use as well, nor were they so meticulous with numbers. Remaining on Aaron&apos;s &quot;Toscanello&quot; (1531 ed.), you will find:<br/>-all 4 are in extended form (IIII,  XIIII, XXIIII etc.)<br/>-all 9 are in subtractive form (IX, XIX, XXIX etc), but the chap. 29 of the first book is numbered XXVIIII. Some chapters are numbered wrongly: in the first book, chap. 9 is  VIII, chap 39 is XXXVIII; in the second book, chap 19 is XVIII. Chap 40 of the first book is in the form XL. The 1539 edition shows even more errors.<br/>It appears such errors, probably due to inaccuracy by the typographer, were common and tolerated at that time.</p><p>The text Joe published had been written as a draft in plain text, so there was no way to represent accidentals properly; also, there are other small errors needing to be amended. Of course, all comments are welcome for my part.</p><p>Finally, I wish to seize the opportunity to thank Claudio Di Veroli for his writings. His first book on UT was my first source of knowledge about temperaments when I had my apprenticeship in early 80&apos;s.</p><p>Best regards</p><p>Leonardo</p></div>
