I just<br/>picked up &quot;A Complete Guide to Brass&quot; by Scott Whitener and it goes a<br/>long way in explaining which overtone series the brass instruments use.<br/>But there is still that mystery that Backus talks about in &quot;The<br/>Acoustical Foundations of Music&quot; where he states that &quot;it is not correct<br/>to think that the trumpet, or any other brass instrument automatically<br/>plays in just intonation.&quot; (p223).</p><p>I believe the reason that the third resonance of &quot;particular trumpet&quot; is<br/>flat 6&iuml;&iquest;&half;; 4th resonance flat 25&iuml;&iquest;&half;; 5th resonance flat 34&iuml;&iquest;&half;; 6th resonance<br/>flat 16&iuml;&iquest;&half; and the 8th resonance flat 54&iuml;&iquest;&half; may be because of the use of<br/>valves require inserting cylindrical section to an otherwise gradual<br/>flaring bore, although he says &quot;actually, there is no reason for<br/>assuming that there is any shape that will put all the modes into exact<br/>harmonic relationship.&quot;</p><p>Looking at Whitener&apos;s book, right at the beginning on page 6 he says<br/>&quot;Because the 7th, 11th, 13th, 14th and 15th overtones of the harmonic<br/>series are not in tune in the equal temperament system in use today,<br/>they are replaced by valve notes.&quot;</p><p>My question for the list, has anybody calculated where these pitches are<br/>so that they could possibly be used?  The same for the woodwinds.</p><p>I have a couple of leads.  My friend Bruce Brode plays French Horn.<br/>Also an acoustics professor at a music conservatory in Mexico emailed me<br/>on my website.  But I was throwing this question out there in case<br/>someone else already knows.</p><p>I was kind of surprised when at the Microfest Lou Harrison mentioned<br/>restricting some of his use of brass writing to trombones when I&apos;ve long<br/>felt that all wind instruments are fair game for microtonal resources.</p><p>RT</p></div><h3><a id=23342 href="#23342">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MR88CET@TEXAS.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 1:33:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I believe the reason that the third resonance of &quot;particular trumpet&quot; is<br/>&gt; flat 6&cent;; 4th resonance flat 25&cent;; 5th resonance flat 34&cent;; 6th resonance<br/>&gt; flat 16&cent; and the 8th resonance flat 54&cent; may be because of the use of<br/>&gt; valves require inserting cylindrical section to an otherwise gradual<br/>&gt; flaring bore, although he says &quot;actually, there is no reason for<br/>&gt; assuming that there is any shape that will put all the modes into exact<br/>&gt; harmonic relationship.&quot;</p><p>Be certain that you&apos;re making a clear distinction between the partials present in a particular<br/>note on a brass instrument, and the series of pitches that plays when you switch between different<br/>pitches by only adjusting lip tension (I&apos;m trying to avoid the word &quot;harmonic&quot; here, but it&apos;s not<br/>easy!).  There&apos;s no guarantee that the pitches you get from a single valve combination and varying<br/>lip tension will be exactly harmonic, but the partials present in a trumpet tone playing one<br/>nominal pitch are pretty much exactly harmonic.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My question for the list, has anybody calculated where these pitches are<br/>&gt; so that they could possibly be used?  The same for the woodwinds.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any single formula for calculating the lengths of the tubes added by<br/>depressing a valve.  Although I don&apos;t know for certain, I would not be at all surprised if each<br/>manufacturer probably has slightly different such lengths.</p><p>The toneholes of woodwinds are a largely different problem.  It&apos;s a very complex topic that I<br/>personally think is only indirectly related to unusual tunings.  A good source of information is<br/>Arthur Benade&apos;s book.  (Ack, the title slips my mind at the moment, and I don&apos;t have it here with<br/>me.)</p></div><h3><a id=23374 href="#23374">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 6:38:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Rick Tagawa &lt;ricktagawa@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I believe the reason that the third resonance of &quot;particular<br/>trumpet&quot; is<br/>&gt; flat 6&cent;; 4th resonance flat 25&cent;; 5th resonance flat 34&cent;; 6th<br/>resonance<br/>&gt; flat 16&cent; and the 8th resonance flat 54&cent; may be because of the use of<br/>&gt; valves require inserting cylindrical section to an otherwise gradual<br/>&gt; flaring bore, although he says &quot;actually, there is no reason for<br/>&gt; assuming that there is any shape that will put all the modes into<br/>exact<br/>&gt; harmonic relationship.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m wondering whether it isn&apos;t the flared bore that makes them<br/>inharmonic. i.e. Different frequencies experience different effective<br/>bore lengths.
