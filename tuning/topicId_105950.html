The POL2 for leapfrog at<br/>704.745 cents, or 63-EDO at 704.762 cents (with 23/16 wide by<br/>0.297 cents), may also be considered as tunings of skidoo if 23<br/>is a relevant consideration.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Subgroup+temperaments">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Subgroup+temperaments</a>&gt;</p><p>Since 23/16 is a higher prime which may have a rather narrow &quot;sphere<br/>of influence,&quot; one way to get a sense of the domain of skidoo would<br/>be to propose that this ratio should be within about a cent of<br/>just. A rough guide might be 704.5-704.9 cents, maybe with 80-EDO<br/>as a northern suburb (fifth 705 cents, augmented fourth 630 cents).</p><p>While skidoo is the name for this abstract temperament in<br/>general, 23-Skidoo is the tuning with a pure 23/16 (704.712 cents).</p><p>The general mapping of this rank-2 system is like that of<br/>leapfrog with prime 23 added.</p><p>For the brief, Xenwiki-like description that follows, I simply<br/>list the commas, or at least some of them; but I would be glad to<br/>explain them at more length, and know that if I were confronted<br/>with a similar list, I might have lots of questions!</p><p>----------</p><p>Skidoo</p><p>Group: 2.3.7.11.13.23</p><p>Commas: 896/891, 352/351, 364/363, 10648/10647; 14680064/14348907;<br/>        108224/177147, 19712/19683; 6656/6561; 169/168;<br/>        736/729, 208/207, 5632/5589, 897/896</p><p>Gencom mapping: [&lt;1 1 0 -6 -3 -1 1|, &lt;0 1 0 15 11 8 6|]</p><p>EDOs: 63, 109, 172</p><p>Some tunings and eigenmonzos:</p><p>109-EDO        704.587c<br/>pure 7/4       704.588c<br/>e-based        704.607c<br/>pure 23/22     704.609c<br/>172-EDO        704.651c<br/>pure 11/8      704.665c<br/>pure 23/16     704.712c<br/>pure 39/32     704.720c<br/>leapfrog POL2  704.745c<br/>63-EDO         704.762c<br/>pure 7/6       704.776c</p><p>Scala files:</p><p>23-Skidoo (12-MOS):<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_12.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_12.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>23-Skidoo (17-MOS):<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_17.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_17.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>23-Skidoo (24-note set):<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>23-Skidoo (29-MOS):<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_29.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/23-skidoo_29.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>-------------<br/>Musical notes -------------</p><p>The skidoo temperament is near the upper end of the gentle<br/>family, and shares the themes of this family: regular thirds at<br/>or near 14/11 and 13/11; and a &quot;paraschismic&quot; mapping for neutral<br/>or submajor/supraminor intervals from 7-11 fifths, with the<br/>diminished fourth (-8 fifths) as a submajor or largish neutral<br/>third, and the augmented second (+9 fifths) as a supraminor or<br/>smallish neutral third.</p><p>Additionally, as a rank-2 system, skidoo shares with leapfrog an<br/>apotome (+7 fifths) about midway between 14/13 and 13/12, with<br/>two apotomata (+14 fifths) approximating 7/6. The augmented third<br/>or &quot;wolf fourth&quot; (+11 fifths) approximates 11/8; and the<br/>augmented fifth (+8 fifths) approximates 13/8, although in the<br/>lower range of skidoo this interval is about halfway between the<br/>more complex Phi (833.090 cents) and 13/8, and may have some<br/>qualities of each.</p><p>In this upper region of gentle (which ranges roughly from 29-EDO<br/>to 80-EDO, or 703.45 to 705.0 cents), 14/11 is a bit larger than<br/>pure, while the minor third is closer to 33/28 than to 13/11. In<br/>the heartland of skidoo, the diatonic semitone is close to 23/22<br/>(76.956 cents).</p><p>For maqam music, the skidoo region or subregion of gentle offers<br/>large and small neutral intervals about a comma apart, such as<br/>thirds at 341/363 cents in the e-based temperament or 343/362<br/>cents in 63-EDO. This may fit many Syrian and some Turkish and<br/>Persian tastes, while being &quot;beginner-friendly&quot; in that the<br/>difference is easier to appreciate from an ear-training<br/>perspective than the more subtle shadings of some maqam tunings.</p><p>The basic heptad of skidoo could be 4:6:7:9:11:13:23, with a<br/>17-MOS yielding two of these heptads, and a 24-note set, nine.<br/>A 24-note set, or possibly a 29-MOS, is recommended to enjoy more<br/>fully the septimal (<a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a>) resources of this temperament.<br/>However, a basic 12-MOS permits much exploration of the regular<br/>thirds near 14/11 and 33/28 (or 13/11), the neutral intervals,<br/>and, of course, the augmented fourth at or near 23/16.</p><p>While I&apos;m not sure how far back the history of skidoo goes, the<br/>e-based tuning at 704.607 cents, with its near-just 23/16, may be<br/>one of the earlier examples on this list.</p><p>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_20573.html#20573">/tuning/topicId_20573.html#20573</a>&gt;</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
