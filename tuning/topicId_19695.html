Parts of<br/>the list can be brought over to the list for debate....</p><p>Then the FAQ is determined &quot;finalized.&quot;</p><p>When it is, the FAQ EDITOR, John de Laubenfels, will add the FAQ PAHT<br/>in the FILES area to the Yahoo DATABASE.</p><p>This database can be rearranged.  Essentially, ANYONE can also edit<br/>this database, and I don&apos;t believe it can be locked so ONLY the<br/>editor can edit it...  But, that should be OK....</p><p>When the DATABASE tree is completed, Robert Walker magically turns it<br/>into a HTML tree like the ones he has shown us and ALSO a PURE ASCII<br/>file for the &quot;asciiophiles.&quot;  BOTH will be available and made from<br/>the database.</p><p>This entire system saves John deLaubenfels from having TONS of<br/>individual FAQ e-mails, originals, amendations, revisions, etc.,<br/>etc., etc.... And he won&apos;t have to send them BACK either.</p><p>The logic, beauty and simplicity of this system for our FAQ purposes<br/>is practically beyond refute!</p><p>Anybody want to refute it!  Better not, now...  It&apos;s lookin&apos; good!</p><p>________ ______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
