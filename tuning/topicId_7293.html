In general, he experienced the<br/>&gt; &quot;high third&quot; as being considerably higher than Pythagorean.<br/>&gt; He played it for me over the phone (remember those?) and it<br/>&gt; is indeed the third that I commonly hear as the &quot;singer&apos;s<br/>&gt; third.&quot;</p><p>&gt; [John Link, TD 459.21]<br/>&gt; The high third is 9/7 relative to the root. Here&apos;s the<br/>&gt; experiment I did with my guitar to confirm that conclusion:<br/>&gt; &lt;etc. ... snip&gt;</p><p>Jerry, since you expressed such an interest in my<br/>Robert Johnson webpage,<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a></p><p>and John, since you&apos;re a microtonal (xenharmonic?) vocalist,<br/>and that webpage is concerning Johnson&apos;s microtonal vocals,<br/>I&apos;d like to point out to both of you one of the most surprising<br/>things I found after doing my analysis:</p><p>At the end of the very first line of the song (on the word<br/>&apos;man&apos; in &apos;I&apos;m a drunken hearted man...&apos;), Johnson sings<br/>a note which is the &apos;3rd&apos; of the tonic D-major chord.<br/>It begins quite a bit below the 12-tET (12-EDO?) &apos;3rd&apos;,<br/>then rises quite far above it.</p><p>What surprised me was that the ending pitch is *clearly*<br/>far higher than the Pythagorean &apos;3rd&apos; [= 81/64 = ~408 cents].</p><p>I hear it as starting out approximately 14 cents below<br/>2^(4/12) [= 400 cents] and rising to ~27 cents above.</p><p>The starting pitch is quite clearly implying a 5/4<br/>[= ~386 cents], and I interpreted the ending pitch rationally<br/>as a 32/25 [= ~427 cents].</p><p>I considered 9/7 [= ~435 cents] as the ending pitch, but<br/>when I tuned the MIDI track up to that, it sounded too high<br/>and did not (to my ears) accurately reflect Johnson&apos;s vocal.</p><p>I settled on 32/25 because my criteria, aside from closeness<br/>in pitch, was lowness of prime/integer limit, and those were<br/>the smallest ratio-numbers which fit.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

I just do<br/>&gt; my best to sing in tune.</p><p>Well, OK, sorry to label you without your approval... but<br/>as far as anyone on this List (except maybe Johnny Reinhard)<br/>is concerned, your efforts to &apos;sing in tune&apos; automatically<br/>make you a microtonalist/xenharmonicist/whatever-you-call-it,<br/>because you *sure* aren&apos;t singing in 12-tET/12-EDO!</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 460.15]<br/>&gt; In the context of the discussion with Gerald Eskelin,<br/>&gt; 32/25 would probably not be a viable answer, since its<br/>&gt; numbers (32 and 25) are far to high to produce any noticeable<br/>&gt; reduction of beating.

It can&apos;t be done.<br/>&gt; However, 9/7 can be tuned pretty comfortably by ear in the<br/>&gt; higher register.</p><p>OK, I&apos;m willing to grant that you may be right that what I<br/>said about 32/25 may not be applicable to the discussion with<br/>Gerald.  And probably also right about 9/7 being easier to<br/>tune correctly by ear.  But in Johnson&apos;s song, there&apos;s no<br/>other low-prime/odd ratio that comes closer to the pitch he&apos;s<br/>singing (as I hear it) than 32/25.</p><p>Paul, after reading what I have to say below (and, most<br/>importantly, *listening* to the passage in question), tell<br/>me what you think about why I found 64:75:96 to be so, uh...<br/>&apos;consonant&apos;, given the largeness of the integers involved.</p><p>Is 75/64 close enough to some other ratio with larger (but<br/>not &apos;too&apos; large) prime/odd-factors, that it is emulating it?<br/>Or what exactly do you think is going on?  I found 64:75:96,<br/>which can be expressed utonally with slightly smaller proportions<br/>as 50/75 : 50/64 : 50/50, to be better here than any of the<br/>smaller-number possibilities that I tried.</p><p>You may also want to look again at my posting on direct/indirect<br/>lattice connections in Onelist TD 132; I think what I noted<br/>there has a direct bearing on this.</p><p>&gt; [John Link]<br/>&gt; Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I will tune my guitar<br/>&gt; so that I can hear 32/25. Note the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        (9/7) / (32/25) = 225/224 = 1.00446<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        1200*(log(225/224)/log(2)) = 7.71<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the two intervals vary by less than one half of one percent,<br/>&gt; just under 8 cents.</p><p>Ah, very interesting...</p><p>Of course, we&apos;ve discussed this particular interval quite<br/>a bit in this forum already earlier this year, partly because<br/>it was important in Fokker&apos;s earliest musical theories (c. 1949).</p><p>I have another interesting observation on this interval.  It pertains to<br/>the new JI retuning I&apos;ve just done of my piece<br/>_3 Plus 4_:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/3plus4/3plus4ji.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/3plus4/3plus4ji.mid</a></p><p>I was going to save this for the analytical webpage of that<br/>tune, but since you brought it up...</p><p>At the climax of the main part of the tune (just before the<br/>&apos;hook&apos; - the first occurrence is at 0:20), I wanted a darker<br/>sound for the cadence onto D#-minor than could be gotten with<br/>the &apos;usual minor&apos; chord with proportions 10:12:15<br/>[== 1/6 : 1/5 : 1/4].</p><p>After experimenting with lots of different &apos;minor 3rds&apos;, I finally<br/>settled on 64:75 [= ~275 cents], which is 224:225 higher than 7/6<br/>[= ~267 cents], and which I would normally go for when trying to<br/>get that &apos;darker&apos; &apos;minor&apos; sound.</p><p>I had tried 7/6 first, and it didn&apos;t sound right at all - the<br/>whole chord sounded badly out of tune.  Then I tried 19/16<br/>[= ~298 cents], and that was better in-tune, but not &apos;dark&apos;<br/>enough.  So then I just altered the amount of pitch-bend by<br/>eye/ear until I got the sound I wanted, and it was darn close<br/>to 75/64, so that&apos;s how I finally retuned the &apos;3rd&apos;.</p><p>The big surprise to me was that there was such an audible<br/>difference between 75/64 and 7/6 [= ~8 cents difference],<br/>more so than between 19/16 and 75/64, which are ~23 cents apart!</p><p>My guess is that some of that perception depends on the<br/>musical context, and some of it on prime-limit or something<br/>resembling or related to it.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
