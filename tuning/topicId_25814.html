The theorists<br/>on the list have provided some useful directions to some of the composers and performers on the<br/>list.  Still, the particular question I&apos;m responding to here was how successful the tuning-list<br/>has been encouraging its members to compose and perform actual microtonal music.  Is that the most<br/>important question?  Well, I&apos;m sure there are lots of different opinions along those lines, but<br/>assuming that it is an important question, then here are some thoughts along those lines.</p><p>&gt; A quick glance at the Tuning Punks pages might be instructive.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon, although not presently a list participant, has<br/>&gt; vigorously participated and writes *lots* of music,<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; So, Szanto... what in the hell are you talking about??</p><p>I hope that everybody will understand that what I&apos;m saying below should not be interpreted as a<br/>complaint, but an invitation and a challenge to non- or infrequently-composing list members to<br/>&quot;just do it,&quot; so to speak:  take a crack at composing and performing.</p><p>I had just about given up on the list a year ago with respect to any real musical results coming<br/>from it, and then, recently some of you challenged me to take another look.  I&apos;ve been impressed<br/>with how much the tuning list seems to have improved over the past year or so with respect to<br/>producing actual music.  I definitely see some real progress there, for which I&apos;m grateful to the<br/>people mentioned in the above message from 30 June listed, and to others.</p><p>Still, consider this:  This tuning-list message mentioned 17 active microtonal composers and<br/>performers on the tuning list as examples.  I&apos;m sure there are other active microtonal composers<br/>and performers on the list than these 17 examples, but still, 17 people constitutes something like<br/>3 1/2% of the total number of people subscribed to the list.  All accounted for, how many active<br/>composers are we up to?  Would it be about three times that, or 10%?  Even if it&apos;s twice that<br/>number, we&apos;re only up to 20%.</p><p>Here&apos;s another statistic to consider:  In the month between 4/21 and 5/21, I see 2058 messages<br/>having been posted to the list by a total of (best I could factor out duplicate Email IDs by<br/>&quot;eyeball&quot; inspection) 81 people, or an average of about 25 messages per poster - a little less<br/>than one message a day on the average.  I recently asked myself how many hours I spend reading and<br/>writing tuning-list Email compared with the time I spend performing and composing microtonal<br/>music, and wasn&apos;t very happy with the answer.  Perhaps some of you might find that question<br/>enlightening to ask yourselves too?  (For the record, I haven&apos;t spent much time on either the list<br/>or composing over the past couple years or so.  Although I&apos;ve composed a fair amount of microtonal<br/>music in the past, I&apos;ve mostly been practicing the saxophone in an effort to recover some<br/>performance skills.  I really have to get back to composition!)</p><p>I suppose we could factor out the tuning-list members who are only casually interested in the<br/>topic by comparing those 17 known composers to the 81 active posters during that month?  That&apos;s<br/>only 21%.  If we suppose that that list of examples is only accounts for half of the active<br/>composer/performers on the tuning list, then we&apos;d be up to 42%, which is still under half.</p><p>Once again, my goal is not to complain or to criticize anybody, and certainly none of the people<br/>on that list of 17 example composers (other than myself perhaps).  I&apos;m just suggesting to those of<br/>you who haven&apos;t composed much music recently to have a crack at it.  I at least learn a lot more<br/>from writing and performing than just by reading or writing or calculating about microtonality.</p></div>
