That multimode is great, it allows to create FM sounds with more than 6 operators (by combining algorithms).</p><p>TX81z is 4 operator synth similar in parameters to DX11, DX21, DX27, DX27s, DX100, but it has again some improvements like configurable 2 to 8 part multimode (each part only monophonic), and interesting performance effects (programmable single note chord memory, transposed delay effects, pseudoreverb, alternate voice assign). Sound quality was also improved with new LSI chips, and there&apos;s 8 waveforms (not only sine), improved EG resolution, program change table... It&apos;s very good for using with WX series Wind Controller which I&apos;ve been doing for last 22 years. For this purpose I use also dedicated WT11 module.</p><p>And because DX/TX series is not only FM synthesis, but combines FM and additive synthesis, there&apos;s a lot of sound design possibilities. I still love those synths even after 24 years of using them. You can get great sounds from it but programming is not easy and needs some effort to learn.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 24 Mar 2010, at 6:38 AM, Cox Franklin wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for this offer.
