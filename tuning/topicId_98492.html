My initial impression:</p><p>I feel like all of these give off a very &quot;nature&quot; or &quot;earth&quot;-y vibe,<br/>but not in the stereotypical sense of you being in a forest and<br/>getting bitten by bugs. For example, when I listen to the 27-tet or<br/>32-tet diatonic scale, I feel like I&apos;m outside near the ocean in some<br/>way, maybe on a reef or a dock or something. There is motion by fifth<br/>everywhere, setting up lots of tonal structures, but all of the chords<br/>are 6:7:9 or 10:13:15. Everything is amazingly bright, more so than<br/>17-equal; it&apos;s as if it&apos;s become so bright that it&apos;s spilled over onto<br/>something totally new. I am enlightened and reveling in my own<br/>existence and near an ocean.</p><p>On the other hand, when I listen to 46-equal, I&apos;m still in nature, but<br/>now I feel like I&apos;m in an Avatar-style rainforest, where everything is<br/>luminescent and imbued with its own natural light, and you step on the<br/>ground and you leave neon footprints and stuff. Everything has a very<br/>colorful vibe to it. Neil Haverstick nailed this vibe in his piece<br/>&quot;Beautiful Springtime,&quot; although I doubt that he was tempering 91/90<br/>when he played. Imagine giant mushrooms with orange caps, except the<br/>orange caps are sort of glowing. That&apos;s about where I&apos;m at with this<br/>tuning. Don&apos;t read too much into the mushroom reference.</p><p>Then the semaphore-ish ones posted above evoke a different kind of<br/>nature, this time the &quot;island&quot; feel, which makes sense because they&apos;re<br/>also island temperaments. So there&apos;s a lot of overlap there.</p><p>But the characteristic is - this temperament makes supermajor chords<br/>palatable, which for me causes the above synesthetic associations to<br/>actually happen. For temperaments not eliminating 91/90 (like let&apos;s<br/>say 22-ET), supermajor chords sound bright and sometimes irritating -<br/>I&apos;m used to them at this point, but they don&apos;t cause this serene<br/>transcendental vibe like I wrote above. Instead, it sounds more like<br/>you have to watch your step, because if you accidentally land on a<br/>supermajor chord you&apos;re going to set an alarm off. It&apos;s not the same.</p><p>Any suggestions for a name for this complex, something like what we<br/>had with the archipelago? &quot;Nature&quot; temperament is too cheesy and<br/>evokes associations I don&apos;t want. Each one of these evokes different<br/>&quot;climates,&quot; so something like &quot;Landscape&quot; would be a good word,<br/>although that&apos;s already a different temperament I think. What would<br/>you call a selection of different landscapes?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98562 href="#98562">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2011 1:43:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 4/23/2011 4:59 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; As I was discussing with Igs in the other thread, 91/90 is a great<br/>&gt; comma; it makes the inverse of 6:7:9 out to be 10:13:15.
