I&apos;m curious to know if the<br/>Arabic Maqamat that you listed are usually intended to be used in<br/>Arabic music in strict 24 TET, or is it possible that ratios are used<br/>(or could be used) that would be closest to the quarter tones, such<br/>as 11/9 or 27/22 for instance? I&apos;m most interested in using ratios<br/>rather than 24 TET - just wondering how it&apos;s used in the actual music<br/>and theory of Arabic Music.</p><p>Jacky</p></div>
