I started doing that<br/>only last week. It all started after reading the email<br/>about 9:8 vs 8:7 which got me to experimenting. Before<br/>I knew it I had decided that my new love for this<br/>month is the following fifth-repeating scale I discovered:</p><p>&quot;seven and five&quot; tuning:</p><p>            1/1, 9/8, 9/7, 4/3, 3/2<br/>                      =<br/>  0.0, 203.910, 435.084, 498.045, 701.955 (cents)</p><p>This has a real medieval feel and is also quite<br/>Pythagoreanish on account of the base being a pure fifth.<br/>Lots of subminor and supermajor thirds; this is a<br/>root-position septimal triad lover&apos;s wet dream. Or<br/>at least a quick fling. We&apos;ll see if it lasts.</p><p>For those of you who (like me) cringe at the static<br/>dullness of pure just intervals (they sound like fingernails<br/>on a blackboard to me - anyone with me on this other<br/>than the Balinese?), stretch the scale until the fifth<br/>is around 1.507 or so:</p><p>&quot;Nuevo Renaissance&quot; tuning (in cents):</p><p>  0.0, 206.251, 440.080, 503.764, 710.015</p><p>Oooh! Now the supermajor third is at 440.1 cents - saucy!<br/>[I recommend mapping these to the vanilla keys if you are<br/> using a vanilla &amp; chocolate style keyboard]</p><p>&gt; I think the sub-minor has a nice dark sound.</p><p>I would call it voluptuous.</p><p>&gt; The super-major is an ugly chord, does anybody disagree?</p><p>I disagree with you 100%. You&apos;re just not treating her<br/>right. She&apos;s rather saucy and strident.

If played _very_ delicately, with the upper notes<br/>doubled in higher octaves (adding 1/3, 1/2, and 1/1), some consonance can be<br/>discerned in this chord. But use the slighest bit of force, and she will<br/>break (due to combination tones, which tend to fill up the entire frequency<br/>spectrum). Otonal chords such as the sub-minor (6:7:9) are, by contrast,<br/>aided by combination tones, which instead of filling up the entire frequency<br/>spectrum, only occur at dicrete frequencies, namely the other overtones of<br/>the missing fundamental that the chord tones are the 6th, 7th, and 9th (or<br/>whatever) overtones of.</p></div><h3><a id=2435 href="#2435">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

If no, does anybody have a midi sequence (or other<br/>&gt;music example) illustrating how to solve this problem?</p><p>John, this is the world of 9-limit harmony. Many JI composers (Micheal<br/>Harrison comes to mind)have used the scale of three sub-minor chords in a<br/>chain of fifths: 1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 14/9 7/4. I call it the sub-minor<br/>scale. In typical meantone a very close approximation of the scale can be<br/>found: Bb C C# Eb F G G#. Though the three sub-minor chords are nice, there<br/>is a very ugly 21:16 between 4/3 and 7/4 (in meantone, an augmented third -<br/>yuck!). 21:16 sounds like 4:3 but is out-of-tune by a septimal comma, 64:63.<br/>The best solution (apart from adaptive tuning) is to use a temperament where<br/>the septimal comma vanishes, such as 22-tET. The sub-minor scale, in 22-tET<br/>steps, is 4 1 4 4 1 4 4.</p><p>In any case, one has the &quot;super-major&quot; chords to contend with. As they<br/>convey none of the flavor of traditional major chords, I would say that few<br/>traditional pieces can be played in the sub-minor scale. It&apos;s a great scale<br/>for non-traditional music, though, and one of the many reasons I like<br/>22-tET.</p><p>The tuning of the A-C-E-G chord above (12:14:18:21) was given by Kami<br/>Rousseau as his preferred tuning of a C6 chord. That would be a super-major<br/>chord with an added large sixth. I responded that I would prefer<br/>10:12:15:18. These two chords are examples of saturated 9-limit chords;<br/>i.e., chords where all intervals are within the 9-limit but no note can be<br/>added without disturbing this property. The other two examples are the<br/>9-limit otonality (4:5:6:7:9) and the 9-limit utonality<br/>(1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4).</p></div><h3><a id=2506 href="#2506">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/1999 8:39:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Back in td147, Graham Breed responded to my sub-minor question:</p><p>&gt; I show some 7-limit scales on my website, including melodic examples<br/>&gt; (still no chords).  Using subminor thirds in a tonal context looks<br/>&gt; like trouble.  Using them with adaptive tuning really means more than<br/>&gt; 12 notes per octave to me.</p><p>Adaptive tuning works best, I agree, when one has the whole pitch<br/>spectrum available.</p><p>&gt; This is why I&apos;m not so interested in adaptive tuning.</p><p>Really???  I had gotten a different idea from the exchanges we&apos;ve had<br/>apart from this list!!  Why does it matter that you have more than 12<br/>notes per octave, especially if your INPUT is still 12/octave?</p><p>&gt; With a meantone, I know exactly where the subminor thirds are should I<br/>&gt; want to use them.  Diminished triads aren&apos;t my favourite 7-limit<br/>&gt; chords, as well.</p><p>Meantone is fine for pieces that don&apos;t modulate a whole lot.  My problem<br/>is, when I&apos;m playing I don&apos;t want to be confined to a narrow set of<br/>keys; I want to modulate freely.  So, for me, adaptive JI is a<br/>necessity.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=2540 href="#2540">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/1999 12:06:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I want to acknowledge and thank everyone who responded to my sub-minor<br/>question not long back.</p><p>To Kami Rousseau, td145.23, thanks for the reference!
