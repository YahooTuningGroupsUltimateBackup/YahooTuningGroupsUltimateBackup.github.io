He does discuss and give<br/>monochord measurements for all three genera.</p><p>Almost immediately after Boethius, the &quot;dark ages&quot; ensued,<br/>and there is a complete break in music theory at this point.<br/>we have nothing substantial until the Frankish theorists<br/>began writing treatises around 800 AD.  but while the<br/>medieval theorists continued to uphold Boethius&apos;s treatise<br/>as the ultimate reference on music theory all the way up<br/>about 1450, there are significant differences between<br/>Boethius and their own work -- primarily, the fact that<br/>they never discuss the chromatic or enharmonic genera again,<br/>basing everything on the diatonic.  it was only after the<br/>Crusades that European theorists rediscovered the ancient<br/>Greek theory and experimented with actually tuning up the<br/>chromatic and enharmonic genera.</p><p>so the *natural* minor scale became the standard source<br/>scale for medieval theory, which has continued to develop<br/>in an unbroken line up to the present day.  the natural<br/>minor scale does indeed contain 5 tones and 2 semitones.</p><p>it was only later, during the &quot;common-practice&quot; period<br/>of standard tonality, that the harmonic minor scale came<br/>into recognition and regular use.  it&apos;s still considered<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; because it uses all 7 letters and repeats none<br/>of them.  regardless of what i wrote before, that sentence<br/>really states the hallmark of all diatonic scales.</p><p>&gt; So it would be useful to me if you would define better<br/>&gt; this statement:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;diatonic&quot; refers to a scale which is composed mostly<br/>&gt; &gt; of &quot;whole-steps&quot; (often called &quot;tones&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So a whole tones scale would be diatonic?</p><p>no ... the definition says &quot;mostly&quot;.  perhaps i need to<br/>add the words &quot;but not entirely&quot;.  it is crucial to a<br/>diatonic scale that there are at least two different<br/>step sizes, and that the one which is used less is about<br/>half the size of the one which is used more.  any scale<br/>which follows that pattern will sound diatonic.</p><p>&gt; Do you think that it is possible to measure the minimum<br/>&gt; of tones and/or halftones to say &quot;diatonic&quot; instead of<br/>&gt; &quot;chromatic&quot;?

In Western harmony, the terms concern harmonic relations, and the enharmonic relation is the difference between the diatonic and chromatic halfsteps in a given tuning. In a modal context, I think that Greek theory gives you a better handle in classifying tetrachords of heptatonic scales. Western music (apart from the harmonic relations emntioned above) essentially differentiates between music in scales, which are diatonic except for the harmonic minor, which is explained as having a &quot;borrowed tone&quot;, and music which uses all the tones of 12-ET. Middle Eastern music has steps of around 150 cents that neither the West nor the Greeks know about, so there are probably Arabic terms going around that fit better than the Greek ones.</p><p>Your scale with the adjacent half steps is not diatonic in the Western of the Greek sense. Since it can be analyzed as two tetrachords with two half steps and large second, it is a perfect chromatic scale for the Greeks, but not to Western theory. Not being diatonic makes it a bad scale for anybody who needs consonant chords and movement by fifths,; it does not make it an inherently bad scale.
