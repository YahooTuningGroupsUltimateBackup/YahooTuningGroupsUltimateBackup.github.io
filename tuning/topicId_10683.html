This HAS to have been discussed before.</p><p>It&apos;s a nice idea, but the problem is that most posts aren&apos;t article<br/>quality.  I don&apos;t mean that in a bad way; I think it stems from the<br/>nature of the beasts.  When you put something in a journal like 1/1,<br/>it ought to have met some sort of peer-review.  But mailing lists are<br/>at their best, IMHO, when they are used as the place where peer review<br/>is done.  The truth sort-of materializes from the stream of consciousness<br/>of the list.</p><p>The final product in this sort of situation is a FAQ.  FAQs, IMHO, are<br/>one of the greatest resources of our age.   But they require an editor,<br/>not just to add commentary, but to carefully re-trace and summarize<br/>threads.  That means time, and lots of it.  Which I guess, is the reason<br/>we don&apos;t yet have a FAQ.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
