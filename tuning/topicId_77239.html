And every time, you skip right over its important subtext.  The quote is circumstantial evidence that some people REALLY WERE setting up temperaments with some slightly large 5ths in them, and presumably tolerating or even liking the results.  Why else would Sorge have his straw-man student character even bring up the question, to be shot down with Sorge&apos;s presumably better way?</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
