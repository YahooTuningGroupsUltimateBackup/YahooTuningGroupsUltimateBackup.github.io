I did not know that. I originally thought the<br/>neural 3rd of 360.88<br/>   cents was within 10 cents of perfect though. I was told by Max Zanetti<br/>that it was not. I&apos;m<br/>   sure he knows more than me so I&apos;m assuming he&apos;s right.  I do think, as<br/>you do that it&apos;s close<br/>   enough.  He thinks it&apos;s close enough as well.</p><p>       If you didn&apos;t see it before, the Szpak Scale actually has 2 types of<br/>neutral 3rds.</p><p>         using 12 EDO tonics            neutral 3rds = 360.88 cents<br/>         using the other 12 tonics      neutral 3rd  = 339.12 cents<br/>===========================================================<br/>Hello Stephen!</p><p>The neutral third which historicly was and is used primarily by the arabic<br/>and persian informed cultures never relied on limits in generating there<br/>tunings. The variation of this interval throught this area of the world is a<br/>matter of personal<br/>taste and from what i am told cultural/regonal identity. The idea that there<br/>is one and only one neural third is contrary to practice. It is not<br/>subjected to the same scutiny that the a harmonic would have. There is<br/>plenty of room for all types<br/>of neutral thirds.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Stephen Szpak&quot; &lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                              Stephen Szpak writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    (Please note this is, I believe your first reply to my original message &gt;a<br/>&gt;few days ago.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          I think we&apos;re thinking on 2 separate plains here. You are &gt;analyzing<br/>&gt;the Szpak Scale<br/>&gt;    with &quot;odd-limit&quot; &quot;prime-limit&quot; and other terms, and I am looking at the<br/>&gt;scale regarding<br/>&gt;    the harmonics it contains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    If one uses the tonics of the 12 EDO system (ignoring the richness of &gt;the<br/>&gt;other half of<br/>&gt;    the Szpak Scale) you have the ability to reach, access, use all of the<br/>&gt;first 12 harmonics.<br/>&gt;    The 12 EDO scale does NOT have the 7th and 11th harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     12 EDO  7th   harmonic        not available<br/>&gt;     12 EDO  11th harmonic        not available<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     24 EDO  7th harmonic         not available<br/>&gt;     24 EDO  11 harmonic          available in 24 tonics<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Szpak Scale  7th   harmonic    available in 12 tonics (the 12 western<br/>&gt;tonic notes)<br/>&gt;     Szpak Scale  11th harmonic    available in 12 tonics  (the 12 western<br/>&gt;tonic notes)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The reason that the neutral 3rd may be slightly off (I guess it is off<br/>&gt;by more than 10 cents)<br/>&gt;     if because of this. The 24 EDO scale, which is what the Szpak Scale is<br/>&gt;based on, is really<br/>&gt;     2   12 EDO scales that have been interlaced. If the first scale is<br/>&gt;untouched the 12 familiar<br/>&gt;     notes of western music are intact. The second scale has to be shifted<br/>&gt;however, if the<br/>&gt;     harmonic 7th is to be included.<br/>&gt;        But here&apos;s the important point. If the second scale is shifted too<br/>&gt;much the 11 th harmonic<br/>&gt;     is lost. The Szpak Scale includes the 7th and 11 harmonics BOTH at &gt;less<br/>&gt;than 10 cents off<br/>&gt;     their ideal locations at the expense of losing other ratios. In fact &gt;the<br/>&gt;shift of the second<br/>&gt;     scale can only exist (you can check the math if you really want to )<br/>&gt;within a 2.49 cent<br/>&gt;     window. Otherwise the 7th harmonic is off by 10 cents or more  OR   &gt;the<br/>&gt;11 th harmonic<br/>&gt;     is off by 10 cents or more.  I realize that the &quot;10 cent&quot; business is<br/>&gt;arbitrary on my part, but<br/>&gt;     the line has to be drawn somewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       0   58.827    100    158.827   200   258.827   etc. until 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      0 61.317       100    161.317   200    261.317  etc until 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     0  60.88         100    160.88     200    260.88   etc until 1200<br/>&gt;(Szpak Scale)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     I suppose you might have realized all this already. Feel free to get<br/>&gt;back to me either way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Stephen Szpak<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Working moms: Find helpful tips here on managing kids, home, work &#xFFFD;  and yourself.   <a href="http://special.msn.com/msnbc/workingmom.armx">http://special.msn.com/msnbc/workingmom.armx</a></p></div>
