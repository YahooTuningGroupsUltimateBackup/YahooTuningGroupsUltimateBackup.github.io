Centered on &quot;D&quot;, the notes of the 5-limit JI lattice would be notated like this:</p><p>+---------------+<br/>|     /Q\__     |<br/>|    /V S P\_   |<br/>|   /E B U R(O) |<br/>|  /J G D A T/  |<br/>| (O)L I F C/   |<br/>|    \N_K H/    |<br/>|       \M/     |<br/>+---------------+</p><p>One problem with this notation is that it&apos;s incompatible with the traditional cycle of fifths (FCGDAEB). It agrees with traditional notation in the representation of most thirds (EG, GB, BD, DF, FA, AC), but CE is a minor third instead of the expected major third.</p><p>So I&apos;ve been trying to come up with alternative 22-ET-based notations. If we keep &quot;O&quot; as the notation for the half-octave, the rest of the alphabet can be divided into three groups of 7: A-G, H-N, and P-V. If we use A-G to notate the basic chain of fifths, we can the other groups to notate chains of fifths transposed up or down by an interval of 10/9:</p><p>+---------------------+<br/>|______________       |<br/>|\U_R V S P T Q(O)    |<br/>|   \F C G D A E B\__ |<br/>|    (O)M_J_N_K_H_L_I\|<br/>|                     |<br/>+---------------------+</p><p>Alternatively, the groups could be arranged this way:</p><p>+---------------------+<br/>|______________       |<br/>|\M_J N K H L I(O)    |<br/>|   \F C G D A E B\__ |<br/>|    (O)U_R_V_S_P_T_Q\|<br/>|                     |<br/>+---------------------+</p><p>I have a slight preference for the first one, since in 22-ET the intervals G-H is the same size as the intervals B-C and E-F (one step each), but I don&apos;t have a really strong preference for either one.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t much improvement over the traditional notation for third-based temperaments, so it&apos;s useful to move the far corners to be closer to the middle, where they can serve to notate extra major and minor thirds.</p><p>+---------------+  +---------------+<br/>|    En____R    |  |    En____J    |<br/>|    /H L I\_   |  |    /P T Q\_   |<br/>|___/S P T Q(O) |  |___/K H L I(O) |<br/>|\F C G D A E_B\|  |\F C G D A E_B\|<br/>| (O)M J N K/   |  | (O)U R V S/   |<br/>|    \U_R_V/    |  |    \M_J_N/    |<br/>|    L     Cu   |  |    T     Cu   |<br/>+---------------+  +---------------+</p><p>Note that if you go beyond five notes in a chain of major or minor thirds, or seven notes in a chain of fourths or fifths, you end up outside the bounds of this 22-ET block. For the chains of major thirds, the notation is only off by a magic comma (3125;3072, ~29.6 cents), and since magic is the temperament you&apos;re probably wanting to notate anyway if you&apos;re using a chain of major thirds, this can be ignored. If you&apos;re going beyond seven notes in a chain of fourths or fifths, you can just use the traditional sharps and flats. But chains of minor thirds run into the porcupine comma (250;243, ~49.2 cents), so you&apos;ll need to start using accidentals after a five note chain if you need to be precise. I suggest using the Sagittal symbols for 36;35 /|) \!) (or the shorthand equivalents n and u), which differ from the porcupine comma by the very small interval 4375;4374 (~0.4 cents) (in the size range for a schismina if it isn&apos;t one already). This allows for an 11-note chain of minor thirds, which is sufficient to notate kleismic:</p><p>In Qn En H P D N V Cu Mu Uu</p><p>or alternatively,</p><p>Qn In En P H D V N Cu Uu Mu</p></div><h3><a id=55137 href="#55137">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2004 3:39:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Herman,</p><p>I&apos;m glad someone&apos;s still thinking about this stuff.

Using E for 9/8 would free T to represent 8/7, if the distinction needs to be made (the two are identical in 22-ET). I was wanting to make T sharper for kleismic anyway.

We are intending to notate<br/>temperaments after all. I think what we want to know is what is the<br/>allowable range (best expressed as rational fractions of an octave,<br/>since ETs will be pivots) for each nominal. We&apos;d like to minimise<br/>the overlap of those ranges.</p><p>We can start with D and O having no allowable variation. They are<br/>always zero and 1/2-oct respectively, and if you arrange the 22<br/>nominals around a circle, we can insist on reflective symmetry about<br/>the line DO. So we only need to look at the half-octave from D to O.</p><p>I assume we want to let G vary from 2/5 to 3/7-oct and E vary from<br/>1/7 to 1/5-oct, but F isn&apos;t needed for a 5-nominal system of fifths<br/>so it only needs to vary from 3/12 to 2/7-oct.
