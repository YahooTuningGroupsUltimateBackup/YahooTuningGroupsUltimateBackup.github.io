I am glad to encounter someone as experienced as him. Yet, it is clear to me, that our mathematical languages and worries are not the same. This is normal. At any rate, as far as I recall, it was over the technical assistance I have given you, upon which he argued that your string tension equation was only an approximation. I have proven to you mathematically, that your equation and his are identical. Now, I am pleased to behold, that by posting your equation together with his, he accepted both of them as equally valid expressions.</p><p>Thus, there seems to be nothing further to discuss.<br/>My best wishes and regards to him, as well as to all of your colleagues on the tuning list.</p><p>Cordially...<br/>Papa Tolga</p><p><a href="mailto:tyarman@isikun.edu.tr">tyarman@isikun.edu.tr</a></p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Cris Forster<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 28 May&imath;s 2005 Cumartesi 19:25<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Different ways of expressing the same tension equation</p><p>  &gt;My Dear Ozan,<br/>  &gt;His Equations (1) and (2) are identical, since obviously, the<br/>  &gt;diameter is twice the size of the radius. For this reason, I would<br/>  &gt;say, they are redundant.</p><p>  Dear Ozan&apos;s Father,</p><p>  As a builder of traditional and original acoustic musical<br/>  instruments, I find little redundancy in the mathematics of<br/>  vibrating systems.  I am passionate about the subject of _musical<br/>  mathematics_ because it is my life&apos;s work.  This commitment<br/>  leaves very little on my redundancy plate.  I have simply<br/>  attempted to be thorough.</p><p>  I have communicated with builders of acoustic musical<br/>  instruments for 30 years.  Some builders prefer to measure<br/>  tension with a diameter variable, others prefer to measure tension<br/>  with a  radius variable.  I know no better way to dispel confusion<br/>  than to be thorough.</p><p>  &gt;However, these equations are correct for the &quot;first harmonic&quot;<br/>  &gt;only. Else, one should multiply the tension (or the &quot;weight&quot; that<br/>  &gt;will create the tension) by n^2, where n, being an integer, points<br/>  &gt;to the nth harmonic.</p><p>  Builders of musical instruments only consider the tension of the<br/>  fundamental mode of vibration, or of the first harmonic.  Here&apos;s<br/>  why: most strings are tensioned between 40% and 50% of their<br/>  _break strength_.  If the tension falls too much below the lower<br/>  limit, the strings are too loose and will sound weak.  If the<br/>  tension rises too much above the upper limit, the strings are too<br/>  tight and will break prematurely.  To calculate a string&apos;s break<br/>  strength, we must know the _tensile strength_ of the stringing<br/>  material.  Tensile strength refers to the maximum tension a material<br/>  can withstand without tearing.  I won&apos;t digress with detailed break<br/>  strength calculations.  Suffice it to say, the tensile strength of<br/>  spring steel music wire varies with diameter.</p><p>  &gt;His equation (3) too is identical to his equation (1); recall that<br/>  &gt;I have previously explained that the mass per unit length is<br/>  &gt;nothing else but D^2 x pi x rho.<br/>  &gt;Anyway, I am glad he finally agrees with you about the fact that<br/>  &gt;equation (3) (the one you had furnished sometime ago), is not an<br/>  &gt;approximate relationship, but is as rigorous as his first equation;<br/>  &gt;they are in fact, as I keep on saying, identical relationships...</p><p>  In Ozan&apos;s original text, and I quote,</p><p>  ******************************</p><p>  The middle strings are manufactured from stainless steel such<br/>  that each weigh about 20 grams per unit meter, or 8 grams (0.008<br/>  kgs) per 0.4 meters.</p><p>  ******************************</p><p>  the diameter of the sample string is not included.<br/>  Hence, no one is able to verify the accuracy of this physical<br/>  property of the wire.</p><p>  &gt;His last equation too is correct, but, although he defined it, I<br/>  &gt;would have used another symbol for the total mass so as not<br/>  &gt;to confuse it with &grave;mass per unit length&grave;. Nevertheless, after<br/>  &gt;writing eqation (3),  his equation (4) is again a triviality, and<br/>  &gt;for this reason, redundant.</p><p>  Again, I believe it is better to be thorough than to be terse.<br/>  Also, Equations 3 and 4 are highly interesting to me because they<br/>  would enable a prospective instrument builder to contemplate<br/>  these kinds of calculations without owning an expensive<br/>  micrometer.  An accurate postage scale could be used to measure<br/>  either the mass per unit length (M/u.l.) or the total mass (M) of a<br/>  string.  Personally, I find this kind of approach, especially in a<br/>  classroom where for financial reasons a precision micrometer may<br/>  not exist, highly interesting and most relevant.</p><p>  &gt;On the whole, I am glad to see that he has tacitly agreed with<br/>  you in the end...<br/>  &gt;My best wishes to him...<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;Pap T.</p><p>  Dear Distinguished Professor at MIT,</p><p>  My best wishes to you as well.</p><p>  Cris Forster, Music Director<br/>  <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p></div>
