There&apos;s a few<br/>ex-Lucier students, doing ex-Lucier kinds of things, a bunch of spectral<br/>composers (of course, due to the presence of Tristan Murail on fac here),<br/>and some weirdos like me who are fooling/flirting with JI and various ETs,<br/>or a friend of mine Marcus Bittencourt who&apos;s writing a massive radio-opera<br/>with some insane 31-note non-octave [microtonal of course] scales.<br/>Thanassis Rikakis gave a talk at Microfest a month ago that some of you<br/>might have heard. . .</p><p>In fact, I&apos;d say there are more people writing microtonal music than<br/>aren&apos;t.
