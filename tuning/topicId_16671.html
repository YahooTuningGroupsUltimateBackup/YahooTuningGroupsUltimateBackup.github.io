I would like to<br/>ask how quickly it will track to the correct pitch across the neck,<br/>and especially on low notes, where I heard is where the GK-2 works a<br/>little more slowly. I&apos;ve kept up with the development of guitar<br/>synths and the GK-2 is supposed to track after sensing 1/2 of a cycle<br/>from the string.</p><p>Is there any sliding/glissing/portamento of the notes as the synth<br/>trys to track the results of playing on a microtonally fretted neck?</p><p>This is looking more and more feasible for me, and I appreciate you<br/>giving me yet another part of the puzzle!</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, alfredo giusto &lt;agiusto@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Jacky,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The GK2 pickup will work with microtonal tunings if your synth. has<br/>the capability. For ex, I<br/>&gt; have a Roland JV-1080 and I put a fretless guitar though it with<br/>the GK pickup and I can play<br/>&gt; any microtonal interval. You have to set the bend range from -12 to<br/>+12. That even ables you<br/>&gt; to play bends on normal 12 et guitars. You also have to set the<br/>interface (Roland GI-10) to<br/>&gt; the same bend range. The equipment might have changed a bit since I<br/>got mine, but the concept<br/>&gt; is the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I have a Chapman Stick. I&apos;ve been thinking about refretting<br/>it. Let me know what you<br/>&gt; find out. I&apos;ll keep you posted on my end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Al Giusto<br/>&gt;</p></div>
