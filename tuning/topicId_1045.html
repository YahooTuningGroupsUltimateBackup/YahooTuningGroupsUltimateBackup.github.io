Weather that sound fits within any discernable musical<br/>&gt;&gt;system as itself is another question. I doubt if it could to any human<br/>ears &gt;&gt;(at least at this stage of our aural evolution. Who knows what the<br/>next few<br/>&gt;&gt;thousand years may bring!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Evolution happens because of survival of the fittest. What kind of<br/>&gt;eugenics program do you forsee that will wipe out those with poor aural<br/>&gt;resolution?</p><p>Evolution works because of mutation and survival.  Fitness is very hard to<br/>define, unless you say it&apos;s what survives, which is redundant.  Even<br/>survival is not the whole story, as many systems that tend towards<br/>extinction are more successful that traditionally &quot;fit&quot; systems (they wipe<br/>out the &quot;fit&quot; system, and then themselves).  Then there is the lemming<br/>reflex, where suicide is selected to preserve the population.  Observing<br/>this behavior in human cells (esp. immune system cells) is very<br/>interesting.  The thing opens up a whole new reason to get picky about<br/>one&apos;s definition of &quot;time&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, I think it&apos;s safe to say that humans have reached the point where<br/>what we think is a critical part of our &quot;genome&quot;.  And so we can evolve<br/>just by thinking.  Language is perhaps the earliest and most glaring<br/>example.  Music is also important.  I think music can be a powerful<br/>learning tool; I believe it &quot;works&quot; by imitating symmetries found in<br/>nature, ones we use for problem-solving and memory.  We have emotional<br/>responses to music because we think we&apos;re learning -- the primary role of<br/>emotion is the reinforcement of learning.</p><p>To answer your question Paul, looking closely at life on earth reveals to<br/>me a surprising lack of 1:1 relationship between selected traits and<br/>fitness.  There&apos;s all kinds of piggybacking (porkbarrel legislation :) and<br/>the like.  But, assuming you disagree with the above, what kind of eugenics<br/>program can you see to select for those who enjoy music at all?  That is,<br/>if it has come this far, why not to the point where 400 cents can have an<br/>independent harmonic meaning?</p><p>And putting the evolution thing aside for a sec, what about just over the<br/>course of a song?  While your probabilistic approach to harmony makes the<br/>most sense of any I know of, I think that compositional practice may narrow<br/>down the options real fast; what about a song that makes a point of<br/>emphasising the difference between 400 cents and 5/4?</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1055 href="#1055">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/1999 4:34:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl &amp; Paul<br/>    The idea of Evolution when applied to music sets up for of music as<br/>being better.  I believe Margo in her last post  was addressing this<br/>question in regard to Medieval and 16th century music. Evolution is a<br/>myth that could apply to a single scale development as with Yasser yet<br/>can lead to dangerous conclusions if not safely guarded!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
