Playing with simple, pure harmonies is like playing with light,<br/>and the fascination with that cusp between complexity and out-of-<br/>tuneness is like playing on the dark side. The flirtation between the<br/>light and the dark is a kind of confrontation with destiny itself, an<br/>reenactment of the battle between survival and annihilation, harmony<br/>and noise. We cherish this in our music. As long as we are singing about<br/>life and death we know we are still alive. The various commas, whether<br/>they are used as expressive shading or a functional way of zapping through<br/>harmonic territory, far from being pesky problems that many theorists<br/>have assumed them to be, are in fact windows to the affective dark side<br/>of the psyche, and they enable music to fill up to the brim with the full<br/>range of human feeling. ... &quot; - W.
