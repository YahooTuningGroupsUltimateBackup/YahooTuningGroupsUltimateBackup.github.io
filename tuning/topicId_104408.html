The temperament could possibly be extended to higher limits but it&apos;s<br/>probably something else than you want anyway.</p><p>If I allow significantly more complexity, there&apos;s the one of ||91 51 -74&gt;&gt;<br/>but do we want to go as far as that? It doesn&apos;t seem to be particularly &quot;in<br/>tune&quot; to make it worth it.
