The fact that I may take a<br/>different viewpoint on some issues only indicates that there is may be<br/>room for more than one opinion; indeed, the Tuning List might be<br/>considerably less interesting were this otherwise &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Anyway, to begin with, I would say that although &quot;humanism&quot; is often<br/>associated with the movements around the 15th and 16th centuries often<br/>styled the Renaissance, in fact medieval humanism was a vital force in<br/>its own right. We could discuss the &quot;Carolingean Renaissance&quot; of<br/>around 800, interestingly coming not long before the first treatises<br/>on polyphony dated to around the middle to late 9th century, and the<br/>better known &quot;12th-century Renaissance&quot; accompanying the flowering of<br/>polyphonic composition at Notre Dame and elsewhere.</p><p>Were medieval composers interested in saturating the senses with<br/>beautiful harmonies? I would say &quot;Yes, and they admirably succeeded.&quot;<br/>Were they interested in &quot;maximizing consonance&quot;? I would say,<br/>&quot;Probably no more and no less than in any other era of Western<br/>European composition -- with one possible and interesting exception<br/>arguable.&quot;</p><p>Of course, the &quot;maximization of consonance&quot; concept has often been<br/>applied not so much to musical styles of composition as tunings, but<br/>in both cases the issues may be more complex than some recent<br/>discussions might suggest.</p><p>From a certain viewpoint, the 16th century might be seen as uniquely<br/>an era of &quot;maximization of consonance&quot; as defined at the time in a<br/>tertian (5-limit) manner. In theory and practice, composers cultivate<br/>smooth motions between saturation tertian sonorities, while applying<br/>rather restrictive treatments to more complex intervals (e.g. seconds<br/>and sevenths).</p><p>This &quot;homogeneity&quot; of texture -- suspensions in a sense being the<br/>partial exception that proves the rule -- does give this music a very<br/>special flavor of &quot;maximal consonance&quot; that can make either<br/>13th-century or 18th-century polyphony seem &quot;crude&quot; or &quot;needlessly<br/>offensive to the senses&quot; in comparison.</p><p>To complement this smooth tertian flavor, a 5-limit tuning (or<br/>meantone for keyboards, which maximizes the prime concords for the<br/>most part) brings out the sense of balance and delicate shading. One<br/>might be tempted to compare this balance to the visual technique of a<br/>Titian or Botticelli, and of course both arts are part of a scene<br/>influenced by the cultural humanism of the time.</p><p>However, would we not be mistaken to assume that earlier and later<br/>styles of composition favoring less homogenously concordant textures<br/>are somehow indifferent to pleasing the ear or uninfluenced by<br/>humanistic movements?</p><p>Thus around the end of the 12th century, the advent of regular<br/>compositions for three or more voices by Perotin and his colleagues is<br/>accompanied by a fascination with Classical rhetoric (e.g. John of<br/>Salisbury), as well as an infusion of culture from Islamic<br/>civilizations (reintroducing Greek sources such as Aristotle).</p><p>Thus John of Salisbury describes the sheer sensuous intoxication of<br/>hearing part-music of this era, with its amazing mixture of high, low,<br/>and middle voices. He says that too much is not a good thing, but that<br/>in moderation this music can inspire spiritual refreshment and<br/>tranquillity.</p><p>To me, the music of Perotin is awesome and exquisite, like a<br/>stained-glass window with its brightly contrasting colors. This is a<br/>very different art than that of a Titian, but is it less satisfying to<br/>the senses in its own way?</p><p>In two ways, &quot;maximization of consonance&quot; is just as important in<br/>Perotin as in Palestrina or Bach. First, Perotin in his works for<br/>three and four voices fills the texture with complete trines<br/>(i.e. full 3-limit sonorities with octave, lower fifth, and upper<br/>fourth, e.g. D3-A3-D4). Secondly, the ideal Pythagorean or 3-limit<br/>tuning indeed maximizes these stable concords, as any JI system seeks<br/>to do.</p><p>However, while the 16th-century approach of smooth and homogenous<br/>concord is certainly one way of gratifying the senses, bold and<br/>studied contrasts between stable and unstable sonorities is another. A<br/>demand that _all_ intervals have &quot;maximal consonance&quot; -- not just<br/>stable concords -- may conflict with this kind of pleasing contrast,<br/>as well as other stylistic imperatives of intonation.</p><p>An unqualified theory of &quot;maximal consonance,&quot; for example, would<br/>require that minor sevenths in Monteverdi&apos;s bold new dissonant<br/>sonorities around 1600 always or as often as possible be sung at<br/>around 7:4. However, this is likely to present problems for the<br/>intonation system as a whole, and also to conflict with the likely<br/>expectation that minor sevenths be treated as points of tension, not<br/>of ideal euphony.</p><p>Note that such considerations do not exclude the possibility that<br/>performers around 1600 (or around 1200) may have sung some minor<br/>sevenths around 7:4. Nor do they exclude the possibility that some<br/>major thirds around 1200 (melodic or vertical) may have been tuned<br/>around 5:4 -- or 9:7, for that matter.</p><p>In any case, I might conclude that the idea of saturating a texture<br/>with the most complex stable sonorities possible, and maximizing the<br/>concord of these sonorities by tuning them in pure integer ratios<br/>(e.g. 3-limit, 5-limit, or 19-limit just intonation), may be common to<br/>most eras. The homogeneity of texture achieved in the Renaissance may<br/>make that &quot;early 5-limit&quot; era in some ways unique.</p><p>However, each style is its own sensuous universe. A pure 3:2 fifth or<br/>complete trine can seem just as rich and satisfying in a 13th-century<br/>piece as a pure 5:4 major third or complete triad in a 16th-century<br/>piece -- or a complete added-sixth chord or 11th chord in 20th-century<br/>pop music.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>David J.

The last thing we need, IMO, is to get sidetracked<br/>onto a topic as flammable as philosophy.  But just so you<br/>know whence I come, I follow Francis Schaeffer&apos;s view that<br/>humanism, gradually expressing itself in ever greater<br/>degrees of relativism, began to cause the decline of Western<br/>thought and culture at about the transition between the<br/>Middle Ages and the &quot;Enlightenment.&quot; (See his book &quot;How<br/>Should We Then Live&quot;)  If anyone wishes to discuss this<br/>(admittedly unorthodox) idea with me, please do so off-list!<br/>:-)  There is, of course, a correlation between philosophy<br/>and musical composition but I don&apos;t know whether its<br/>implications for tuning are great enough to warrant<br/>exploration in this forum.</p><p>&gt; Of course, the &quot;maximization of consonance&quot; concept has often been<br/>&gt; applied not so much to musical styles of composition as tunings, but<br/>&gt; in both cases the issues may be more complex than some recent<br/>&gt; discussions might suggest.</p><p>That suggestion arose at least in part from my misuse of a<br/>term.

The consonant sonority that<br/>characterizes most Medieval music is not the Pythagorean 1-3-5 triad, which<br/>was but one of many unstable sonorities, but the 3-limit diad, or what Margo<br/>Schulter calls the &quot;trine&quot; where one note is doubled at the octave. The<br/>3-limit diad is in fact more beatless (less beatful?) that the 5-limit<br/>triad. So I would say that Gothic singers did equate beatlessness with<br/>consonance as much as, say, late Baroque singers. It&apos;s just that the musical<br/>language was different -- I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find any 3-limit diads/trines<br/>on strong beats in late Baroque music!</p></div><h3>David J.

But I was still thinking within the context<br/>of the thread about the possible limit-raising effects of<br/>long reverberant environments on tuning.  To be more<br/>specific, while a medieval composition might not use triads<br/>in stable positions &quot;on paper,&quot; it would be nearly<br/>unavoidable that even more complex virtual chords would<br/>occur in a performance in such an environment.  In fact, the<br/>whole diatonic scale plus ficta would sometimes have to be<br/>heard ringing together.</p><p>That said, I hesitate to speculate any longer on what effect<br/>that might have had on intonation in practice.  At first I<br/>thought it would inevitably guide Pythagorean singers toward<br/>5-limit JI.  As Margo pointed out, to assert that assumption<br/>would be a form of intonational fascism (she chose the less<br/>inflammatory term &quot;politics&quot;).</p><p>David</p></div>
