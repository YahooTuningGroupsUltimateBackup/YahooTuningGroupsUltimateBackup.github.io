BTW, Wendy Carlos did &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; in<br/>&gt;1/5-comma meantone, and there was an article called &quot;the 48 in 31&quot; by one of<br/>&gt;the Scalatron people claiming that the entire WTC worked better in meantone<br/>&gt;(specifically, 31-tET).</p><p>&gt;Actually, some parts (of the 25th anniversary version) were in 1/5-comma<br/>&gt;meantone, and others were in a kind of well-tempered scale (&quot;circular&quot;<br/>&gt;tuning in her terminology). But either tuning sounds good for Bach to me; I<br/>&gt;usually use a well-tempered scale of one kind or another. I haven&apos;t tried<br/>&gt;the WTC in 31-TET, but it sounds like an interesting idea, since it&apos;s so<br/>&gt;close to 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>&quot;25th anniversary&quot; is the subtitle of the album otherwise known as<br/>&quot;Switched-on Bach 2000&quot;, which features a variety tunings, including 1/5<br/>comma meantone, &quot;optimized&quot; well-temperament, and even a polymicrotonal<br/>piece in which the brass are tuned to the harmonic series.  The original<br/>S-OB is &quot;barely in equal temperament&quot;.</p><p>Paul, I read that Scalatron article, and agreed with it completely.<br/>Herman, I think your MIDI sequences are incredible, especially the 16tET<br/>one.  Bravo too on the Joplinesque one in 26.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
