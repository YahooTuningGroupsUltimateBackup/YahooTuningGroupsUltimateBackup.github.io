Virtually NO beating the in 12-22.  For me, these<br/>&gt;chords had as pronounced a difference as the dominant sevenths...  Is<br/>&gt;this the way it &quot;should&quot; be??</p><p>Well, sort of -- in this 5:6:7:9, just as in the 4:5:6:7 we looked at<br/>before, the 3:2 (aka 9:6) is worse in 22-tET than in 12-tET, and the 5:7 is<br/>the same, while the 5:6 and 6:7 are better. This chord also contains a 5:9,<br/>which is 19&cent; off in 22-tET and 18&cent; off in 12-tET. The interval that really<br/>makes the difference is the 7:9 -- it&apos;s only 1&cent; off in 22-tET, but 35&cent; off<br/>in 12-tET.</p><p>So, one of the things that&apos;s really neat about 22-tET is that it gives you<br/>two _different_ versions of a half-diminished seventh chord, _both_ of which<br/>you&apos;ve found to be smoother than the 12-tET half-diminished seventh. If you<br/>were to use the full 22-tET mapping (with the skipped Es), you could play<br/>some microtonal shifts between one type of half-diminished seventh and the<br/>other (two tones remain fixed while the other two move by 1/22 octave),<br/>thereby giving &quot;quartertones&quot; a harmonic logic that is very rarely<br/>associated with them.</p><p>I enjoy a similar effect with minor seventh chords, though you&apos;ve said you<br/>weren&apos;t too fond of the 12:14:18:21-approximating chord such as the one<br/>found at Eb-Gb-Bb-Db in the 12-out-of-22 mapping (the other one is<br/>10:12:15:18-approximation such as found at C-Eb-G-Bb).</p><p>The great thing about this 12-out-of-22 mapping, besides representing many<br/>of the important resources of 22-tET, is that all chords that &quot;look&quot; the<br/>same, in terms of both the pattern of colors and the interval-sizes looking<br/>the same, sound the same; and you can even reverse the colors (black -&gt;<br/>white, white -&gt; black) and the chord will still sound the same. So once<br/>you&apos;re familiar with the different chords you want to use, you can navigate<br/>around the tuning fairly easily (with the caveat, of course, that&apos;s you&apos;ll<br/>be restricted to just 12 out of the 22 tones).</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
