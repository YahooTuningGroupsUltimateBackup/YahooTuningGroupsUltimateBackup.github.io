I don&apos;t seem to be quite getting it as it appears<br/>&gt;in J.

Monzo (though he might like being called Mr. Monaco, I don&apos;t know<br/>:)!</p><p>This term is an invention of Erv Wilson (the other definition, attributed to<br/>Carl Lumma, was simply based on a misunderstanding of Wilson&apos;s writings).<br/>The definition reads:</p><p>&gt;A tuning system where each interval occurs always subtended by the same<br/>number of steps. &gt;(THAT IS ALL, NO OTHER RESTRICTIONS)</p><p>&gt;[from Erv Wilson, via Kriag Grady, &quot; Onlist Tuning Digest # 340, message 15</p><p>For example, if the scale contains more than one 5:4, the 5:4 is always<br/>subtended by the same number of steps. In the case of a just or meantone<br/>diatonic scale, that number would always be two (aka a &quot;third&quot;).</p><p>All strictly proper scales are CS because if a given interval were subtended<br/>by different numbers of steps at different points in the scale, specific<br/>interval size could not be a strictly increasing function of generic step<br/>size. However, not all CS scales are strictly proper or even proper.</p><p>Wilson (as far as I know) only used the term to refer to scales in JI and,<br/>as I understand Kraig Grady&apos;s remarks, these scales tended to be conceived<br/>of as MOS scales with certain commatic alterations to get more consonant<br/>intervals (e.g., a chain of 3:2s would have one of the 3:2s diminished by a<br/>comma to get a bunch of 6:5 and 5:4 thirds). Perhaps Wilson saw the constant<br/>structures principle as a guiding restriction in the process of making these<br/>alterations.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2000 7:14:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul H.
