I reproduce the conclusion for Carl Lumma&apos;s benefit:</p><p>&gt;We can confirm the predictions from expertise theory, namely that expertise<br/>is always domain-&gt;specific (see Ericsson, 1996): there is no evidence for<br/>successful task-adaptation if there has &gt;not been enough time for skill<br/>acquisition.</p><p>[the players had 10 days to learn the example they were presented on a CD --<br/>some received a JI version and some received an ET version -- PHE]</p><p>&gt;The standard tuning system for a trumpet player in an orchestra is the<br/>equal tempered system. &gt;This seems to be already internalized in the early<br/>stage of higher music education, as with a &gt;conservatoire student. The<br/>student player &quot;H&quot; already shows a remarkable instinct for his major &gt;thirds<br/>and minor seventh. From this point we can say that subject &quot;H&quot; was not a<br/>novice and his &gt;near-perfect adaptation to ET was not expected.</p><p>&gt;There is no evidence for an automatic adaptation to a so-called &quot;natural&quot;<br/>tuning system like JI. &gt;Both performers had far less expertise in ensemble<br/>playing (without piano) and had had little &gt;chance to acquire intonational<br/>skills for JI to the same extent as for ET. We can assume that &gt;the player&apos;s<br/>adaptation to JI would be much better for instance after one week of<br/>intensive &gt;rehearsals in a brass ensemble. On the basis of Sundberg&apos;s (1987,<br/>p. 178) studies on intonation &gt;in barbershop singing which showed that these<br/>singers can adapt to beat-free just intonation &gt;with a mean deviation of<br/>less than 3 c, we can hypothesize that expert musicians are capable of<br/>&gt;perfect task adaptation.</p><p>&gt;These results open perspectives for music education. The surprisingly<br/>successful adaptation to &gt;the &quot;unnatural&quot; ET system shows that only<br/>deliberate practice is required to adapt to a given &gt;task. So we cannot<br/>support Vogel&apos;s assumption (see quotation in the header) of the<br/>&gt;unattainability of ET for brass instruments. From our point of view the<br/>role of the human &gt;factor, the professional musician and his skill to<br/>compensate for a wide range of imperfections &gt;has been underestimated. In<br/>other words: not the trumpet, but the trumpeter makes the music.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/29/2000 9:07:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<a href="http://musicweb.hmt-hannover.de/intonation">http://musicweb.hmt-hannover.de/intonation</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This site contains a short description of an experiment in intonational<br/>&gt;adaptation with 2 trumpet players.  Comments and discussions are welcome.</p><p>That&apos;s a very interesting experiment, which bears on a topic Paul Erlich<br/>and I have been discussing.  The experiment, or at least its write-up, has<br/>one major hurdle for me, and that is the playing of an entire song.  It<br/>would help me to see data on lone intervals first, obtained under the<br/>conditions of the rest of your test.  I am also concerned about the size of<br/>your sample space, and the fact that they were both highly trained musicians.</p><p>I would like to ask how the players heard themselves during the recording.<br/>Was their sound mixed into their headphones?  If so, how?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
