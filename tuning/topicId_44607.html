I also<br/>naively thought that I could organise some sort of microfest within the<br/>Festival till I found out the extortionate costs of attempting such a folly.</p><p>Let&apos;s see if things are better this year.</p><p>I&apos;ll disregard the Fringe Festival which amongst the smush and bad stand-up<br/>comics often presents a fair smattering of music from around the world, the<br/>occasional stray microtonalist minstrel and very occasionally some<br/>enlightened early music specialists who know their historical temperaments.</p><p>We&apos;re still looking at a programme which is supposed to excite us by<br/>offering pictures of virtuosi and of course Maestri looking mostly very glum<br/>and arrogant in direct proportion to their perceived importance. Quotes such<br/>as &quot;her dark, syrupy mezzo....&quot; or &quot;she tore through the music&apos;s virtuoso<br/>workout&quot; (an aerobics session?)... or how about this  - &quot; watching him<br/>conduct seemed almost like spying on a visual artist; his gestures are<br/>reminiscent of a painter applying oils and of a sculptor moulding materials.<br/>He has also no shred of conventional technique (sic?!). Instead he acts as<br/>though music were a physical substance....etc.&quot;  Hold me back. (BTW you can<br/>blame the LA times for that one.)</p><p>Well despite all this tosh designed to get bums on seats there is a very<br/>bold initiative called &apos;Connecting Cultures&apos; presenting the music of China,<br/>Korea, India and Japan and launched with an all day interactive<br/>lecture/session.</p><p>The set of concerts includes Li Xiangting playing Qin, the Nieuw Ensemble<br/>presenting the work of contemporary Chinese and Korean composers, Korean<br/>folk instrumental music, Shiv Kumar Sharma playing Santoor and Japanese<br/>song, shamisen and koto. I chose an evening of &quot;Sanjo&quot; which means<br/>&quot;scattered folk melodies&quot; at the core of Korean folk instrumental music. &quot;A<br/>virtuoso instrument is accompanied by an hourglass drum called a Janggo. The<br/>musical characteristics of Sanjo include subtle melodic decoration and a<br/>fantastic variation of rhythmic patterns.&quot; The bowed kotos look wonderful<br/>and I hope to get a chance to speak to the performers about instrument<br/>design, tuning, composition and instrumental training and technique.</p><p>Added to this there are five nights of &quot;Pansori&quot; a traditional Korean<br/>artform combining storytelling and music. I would expect something corporeal<br/>in the Partchian sense of the word. The action is driven by two master<br/>percusssionists (wearing the distinctive costumes and strange hats) and a<br/>singer/actor. Performances range from 2 - 5 1/2 hours.</p><p>Slightly off topic the complete Beethoven String Quartets are being<br/>performed over three days. I couldn&apos;t resist and got in for the &apos;Grosse<br/>Fuge&apos; and op. 130. Might ask what the Quartet thinks of tuning if i can meet<br/>them.</p><p>I also have a ticket for the &quot;New Music Scotland&quot; evening. This is &quot;an<br/>evening of informal music and conversation with established and emerging<br/>Scottish composers&quot;. As I&apos;m emerging I thought I&apos;d go along and make an<br/>exhibition of myself by asking when some of them were going to stop behaving<br/>like 19th century clones and have they any intention of actually trying<br/>something &quot;new&quot; like a new tuning for example oh and why do you all sound<br/>like somebody else - perhaps you should take time out to think about what<br/>you do and why, etc.  You get the drift. Should be my finest hour.....</p><p>Oh and finally - I got tickets for some contemporary Dance and a play called<br/>San Diego by prominent Scottish playwright David Greig. Is that the one<br/>about a gang of sad rednecks in a border town who still listen to and play<br/>music in 12 tet......?  : - )   (Sorry Jon - couldn&apos;t resist it.)</p><p>I&apos;ll report back on the microtonal stuff later.</p><p>Sincerely<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=44610 href="#44610">ðŸ”—</a>Steve Langford &#x3C;s@TheRiver.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2003 6:51:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, all!  :-)</p><p>        I&apos;d like to know lots more about historical temperaments that were used to play early music, Alison Monteith.</p><p>                Thanks,</p><p>                        Steve Langford<br/>                        (new to this list)</p></div><h3><a id=44619 href="#44619">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2003 8:33:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ali,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Added to this there are five nights of &quot;Pansori&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ll second KG&apos;s comment - Pansori is one of the truly extraordinary art forms on the planet.
