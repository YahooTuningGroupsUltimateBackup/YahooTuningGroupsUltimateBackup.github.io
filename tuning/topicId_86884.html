But the ear is remarkably insensitive to frequency ratios between simultaneous and successive pure tones (Allen, 1967;Plomp, 1967; Plomp &amp; Levelt, 1965). Western musical intervals are perceived linearly and categorically, and intervals are defined by the center and boundaries of the category Â– not by ratios such as 5:4 or 81:64. Intervals can vary in size by up to asemitone (e.g., a major 3rd ranges from 350 to 450 cents: Burns, 1999). Typicalintonations deviate systematically from frequency ratios (major 3rds larger than 4:5,8ves larger than 2:1) and the size of the deviation depends on register (Rosner,1999). The exact size of a performed interval is the result of a compromise between partially conflicting constraints (Terhardt, 1974a) such as roughness, temporalcontext, musical style, emotion, and melodic emphasis: intonation thus depends notonly on sensitivity to the musical surface but also on cultural knowledge (Burns,1999). Frequency ratios do not directly affect or determine intonation; instead, pureintonation minimizes roughness between harmonic complex tones (Hagerman &amp;Sundberg, 1980; cf. Mathews &amp; Pierce, 1980) Â– but most intonation is closer to equal temperament or Pythagorean than pure (Burns, 1999). These empirically based arguments cast doubt on ratio-based, abstract-mathematical theories of the natureand origins of scales.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=86885 href="#86885">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2010 9:35:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Octatonic&quot;&gt;The exact size of a performed interval is the result of a compromise<br/>between partially conflicting constraints (Terhardt, 1974a) such as<br/>roughness, temporal context, musical style, emotion, and melodic<br/>emphasis:</p><p>   I will agree 110% on the roughness and temporal context parts of this.  Ages ago I had a discussion with Bill Sethares and we both agreed temporal context is what keeps things like the initial noise in the striking of a piano key, striking of a guitar string, or attack/&quot;sizzle&quot; in a snare from being obscenely dissonant.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Frequency ratios do not directly affect or determine intonation;<br/>instead, pureintonation minimizes roughness between harmonic complex<br/>tones&quot;<br/>  I don&apos;t know about the rest of you, but I only partly agree with this.  For something like a saw wave with very strong overtones I whole-heartedly agree...but the fact is many instruments have only the first 3-6 overtones being of loudness approaching the root tone.  Also note, even Sethares &quot;derivation of 7-tone diatonic JI&quot; assumes that the timbre has all overtones at almost as high an amplitude as the root tone: not exactly realistic for many instruments.<br/>  For instruments more concentrated on very low overtone loudness, the actual roughness between the root tones becomes more important than &quot;aligning/minimizing-roughness-between higher overtones&quot;.  Of course, 4/3 is much less rough than 5/4 with either type of instrument, but then again 4/3 spaces the root tones much further apart than 5/4 (along with being more periodic).</p><p>    To me where this gets dicey is intervals like 13/11 vs. 8/7 where 13/11 has further apart root tones but 8/7 is more periodic.  Depending on which instrument is used, IMVHO, the &quot;less pure&quot; 13/11 may actually sound less rough in many cases.</p><p>     (Octa-tonic) It&apos;s funny you use the term roughness to describe what I consider periodicity.   General question to all: I usually call roughness between root tones just plain &quot;roughness&quot; and roughness assuming fairly loud overtones that match the harmonic series &quot;periodicity&quot;...aren&apos;t those the proper terms for these phenomena?</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86886 href="#86886">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2010 9:56:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;pure-intonation minimizes roughness between harmonic complex tones<br/>(Hagerman &amp;Sundberg, 1980; cf.

It still amazes me how Pythagorean tuning took off and evolved into mean-tone all the while Ptolemy&apos;s tuning systems died.  Not that Pythagorean theory or the idea of building scales on estimated &quot;circles of 5ths&quot; is a bad idea but, IMVHO Ptolemy was the one with the smarter idea.</p><p>  Look at <a href="http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diatonic-genus.aspx">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/d/diatonic-genus.aspx</a>.<br/>  If you look at Ptolemy&apos;s &quot;Didymus&quot; system, it concentrates on optimizing periodicity and matches the first four notes of 7-tone JI diatonic scale perfectly.  And his &quot;tense diatonic&quot; scale nails the last 3 tones of diatonic JI!   Put them together and you get</p><p>24 : 27 : 30 : 32  Ptolemy&apos;s &quot;Didymus&quot; +</p><p>36 : 40 : 45 : 48  Ptolemy&apos;s &quot;Tense Diatonic&quot; =</p><p>24 : 27 : 30 : 32 : 36 : 40 : 45 : 48 (!!!7-tone DIATONIC JI!!!)</p><p>    I dare any of you to argue that he didn&apos;t, between those two scales, derived 7-tone diatonic JI long before just intonation was invented...or to argue his systems are &quot;not suitable for poly-phonic music&quot; (which is, IMVHO, pure BS).</p><p>  Then again, I agree with you that trying to achieve &quot;pure intonation&quot; as a consideration above almost all else is not an optimum approach.  Meanwhile, to back up this stance (at least to a good extent), Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon IE &quot;smooth&quot; scale system merges on 7TET and provides near-optimum reduction of root-tone roughness while keeping a good degree of average periodicity.<br/>  As I&apos;ve said far too many times, his Homalon system is my favorite scale system around and works beautifully in heavy polyphony (both in harmony and melody, I&apos;ve found) for almost any type of instrument except those with very strong upper overtones (in which case strict JI IMVHO takes the lead).</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86888 href="#86888">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2010 1:43:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;octatonic10&quot; &lt;octatonic10@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a well-known textbook on this subject, it is written: &gt;&quot;Octaves, 5th and 4ths correspond approximately to the frequency &gt;ratios 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4.</p><p>This is simply deceptive.
