The program<br/>asks first the scale size and then the formal octave. Next the<br/>position of the formal fifth in the scale must be given. If instead 0<br/>is entered, the order of pitches is determined by their size<br/>(monotonically ascending). This is also default when just the return<br/>key is pressed. Otherwise the range is indicated where the formal<br/>fifth must be in, for the resulting scale to be monotonic. Then the<br/>formal fifth is entered. The default value for this is pitch memory<br/>0. Subsequently the count downwards, i.e. the number of fifths that<br/>are stacked in the downward direction is entered which is by default<br/>0. This gives a scale in another key. Defining it here can prevent<br/>pitches from becoming a floating point value if ratios overflow.</p><p>OK... so, first off I want a chain of 35 fifths, so that would be my<br/>scale size...
