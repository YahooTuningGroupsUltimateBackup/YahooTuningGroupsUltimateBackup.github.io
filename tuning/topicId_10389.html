Rootedness, as Sethares suggests,<br/>may be a result of the masking phenomenon (low frequencies obscure nearby<br/>high ones, but not vice versa).</p><p>&gt;Lastly, would removing all factors of 2 from a chord, except those<br/>&gt;which preserve the ordering of its identities (leaving the factors<br/>&gt;whose removal would invert the chord) before performing tonalness<br/>&gt;measurements be a workable fix?</p><p>Ugly.</p></div>
