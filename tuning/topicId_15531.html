It looks like the full complexity of<br/>Kyma is beyond my PC in real-time.  But there are ways of getting good<br/>results with simple algorithms, like analog emulation or sampling, that<br/>can use the PC&apos;s slack CPU time instead of hogging Kyma&apos;s DSPs.  Samplers<br/>are particularly useful because it should be possible to get Kyma to<br/>convert a complex instrument into sound files that can be imported into a<br/>sampler.</p><p>Also, Kyma can&apos;t compete with Gigasampler at present because it doesn&apos;t<br/>have direct access to a hard disk.</p><p>Best for the time being is to keep learning how to use Kyma, and then look<br/>at software if I find I&apos;m reaching its limitations.</p><p>&gt; Barry Vercoe (CSound&apos;s originator) has worked with ANalog<br/>&gt; Devices for a number of years on porting to their DSP chips, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know if anything commercial exists or if you have to buy the chips and<br/>&gt; do<br/>&gt; your own hardware integration. THis setup is covered on one of the<br/>&gt; CD-ROMS<br/>&gt; in &quot;The CSound Book&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s an interesting idea, but it all depends on how good the user<br/>interface is.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t aware the VL series supported tuning tables.  But sure<br/>&gt; &gt; enough, they&apos;re on John Loffink&apos;s list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t remember whether I checked this or not; the WX5 has a manual<br/>&gt; pitch<br/>&gt; bend control on it and my plan was to re-tune on the fly by passing MIDI<br/>&gt; through a computer on its way from the WX5 to the VL70-m. Tuning tables<br/>&gt; would be a big plus. The VL70-m looks quite programmable; they have<br/>&gt; something called an &quot;Expert Editor&quot; that lets you get down and personal<br/>&gt; with the hardware, although the typical musician probably won&apos;t be able<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; do anything useful with it. What wasn&apos;t clear to me from the manual was<br/>&gt; how monophonic the VL70-m is. There are some hooks for polyphony,<br/>&gt; although<br/>&gt; it is clearly sold as a monophonic device.<br/>&gt; I am a flute player, and I am<br/>&gt; pretty much useless on a standard keyboard.  As I said before, I have<br/>&gt; wanted a synthesizer that I could play like a flute;</p><p>Well, there you go.  You only need it to be monophonic, so long as it&apos;s<br/>very good.  But be wary about sending it pitch bends.  My AWE64&apos;s acoustic<br/>modelling (which obviously isn&apos;t of the same class) alters the timbre<br/>along with pitch bends, to emulate what would happen on a real flute.  So<br/>it wouldn&apos;t sound like a flute that naturally played the scale you want.<br/>Tuning tables would hopefully behave differently.</p><p>            Graham</p></div>
