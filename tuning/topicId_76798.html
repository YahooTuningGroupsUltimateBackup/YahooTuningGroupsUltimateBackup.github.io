As a matter-of-<br/>fact, it was the dueling pairs of distorted fifths and maj thirds as<br/>well as the inclusion of the exotic, Javanese like 5-tone equal<br/>temperament that initially led me to try this tuning. A couple of<br/>curious byproduct of this tuning on a guitar has the unique ability<br/>to tune the open strings exclusively in fourths (at 2/5ths of an<br/>octave) and still retain the traditional EADGBE arrangement--so in<br/>cents this would be 420, 900, 180, 660, 1140 and back to E at 420<br/>again. It also contains a beautifully odd diatonic scale which by<br/>rotation utilizes every interval in the tuning, a trait shared with<br/>12-tet but very unusual in such a large-numbered tuning.</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/P7070193.jpg">http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/P7070193.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/P7070146.jpg">http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/P7070146.jpg</a><br/><a href="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/P7070113.jpg">http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/P7070113.jpg</a></p></div><h3><a id=76804 href="#76804">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2008 8:36:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:<br/>&gt; For anyone who might be interested, there are a few ancient rough and &gt; tumble examples/demos up here featuring my 20-tone equal temperament &gt; guitar :<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6kmwcs">http://tinyurl.com/6kmwcs</a><br/>&gt; &gt; These bits have been up and down a hundred times before, and they are &gt; really just trash.....utter useless junk, complete throwaway stuff &gt; just pretending to give a little bit of an idea of what&apos;s potentially &gt; possible.....but sometimes, even that&apos;s more than what&apos;s out there &gt; now.</p><p>They may have been up before, but a few of them are new to me (I know I&apos;ve listened to some of your 20-ET examples before). I think 20-ET is one of the underrated tunings that has a lot of potential -- Easley Blackwood&apos;s 20-ET etude is one of my favorites from that set.</p><p>All I&apos;ve got in 20-ET is this thing I wrote back in 1999 which I&apos;ve mentioned a few times already, but might not be familiar to some of the newer members. (It uses MIDI pitch bends, which a few MIDI players might not perform as intended, but it works with the ones that I&apos;ve tried.)</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/20tet.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/20tet.mid</a></p></div><h3><a id=76846 href="#76846">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2008 1:12:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For anyone who might be interested, there are a few ancient rough<br/>&gt; and tumble examples/demos up here featuring my 20-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperament guitar :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6kmwcs">http://tinyurl.com/6kmwcs</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>I would like to include these in the xenharmonic wiki!<br/>There is just one thing I have noticed - maybe this should be<br/>discussed: repeatedly links to you were added to the wiki and then<br/>deleted again - in <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/11edo">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/11edo</a>, for<br/>example.
