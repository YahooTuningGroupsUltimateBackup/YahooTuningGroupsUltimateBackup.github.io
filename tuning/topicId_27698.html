Naturally, the similarity in our names led to a<br/>question of whether we were related.  So, we exchanged e-mail off-list,<br/>and I have reduced it to the following dialog:</p><p>   E: Who are you?  How did you get my last name?</p><p>   J: I dunno.  Guess we must be related.</p><p>   E: I don&apos;t think so!  I _know_ who my relatives are, and you&apos;re not<br/>      one of &apos;em.</p><p>   J: Well...  my father didn&apos;t have much contact with his family after<br/>      the war.  He had been wounded in New Guinea, actually was missing<br/>      and presumed dead for some time, and, to be perfectly frank, was<br/>      apparently never quite the same after that, from what I can gather<br/>      (though I hope his genetics are still all right! ;-&gt; ).  His<br/>      parents had moved during the war, and he never followed.  As far<br/>      as I know, he never visited or wrote to his family again.  I think<br/>      my grandfather was some kind of college professor.</p><p>   E: No kidding?  What is your father&apos;s name?  My dad had an older<br/>      brother named Harry, or something like that, who was lost in WWII.<br/>      That&apos;s not him, is it??</p><p>   J: Woah, this is too weird; my father&apos;s name is Larry.  He was born<br/>      in 1924, does that fit?</p><p>   E: Yes!  My dad is David, born in 1925.  You didn&apos;t know that their<br/>      father, Max deLaubenfels, was a famous zoologist, with a long<br/>      string of college girls following him around Pasadena?  We&apos;re<br/>      first cousins!</p><p>Yes, Eric and I have shed real e-tears over this amazing, unbelievable<br/>reunion.</p><p>All of the above is true, except the part about Larry being wounded in<br/>the war, and the part about him not visiting his family after that, and<br/>the part about Eric and I not realizing we are first cousins.</p><p>JdL</p><p>P.S.
