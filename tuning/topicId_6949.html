When it&apos;s finished, I&apos;ll send it to the Tuning Punks, but in<br/>the meantime, here&apos;s a 95K sample of one of the &quot;new&quot; sections (it was in<br/>the original Porcupine Overture but not in the 113-second excerpt that&apos;s on<br/>my web page). Unfortunately, the nice sound of the spectrally-tuned samples<br/>is covered up by the distortion introduced by the RealAudio compression,<br/>but at least you can get an idea of what it sounds like.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/audio/sample.ra">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/audio/sample.ra</a><br/>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
