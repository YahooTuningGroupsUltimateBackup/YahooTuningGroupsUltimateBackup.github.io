First, &quot;musical&quot; is too broad,<br/>&gt;&gt; and I prefer &quot;harmonic&quot;. And second, it&apos;s not mine,<br/>&gt;&gt; since others (Manuel Op de Coul at least) have proposed<br/>&gt;&gt; treating the prime weights as parameters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK, Manuel called this &quot;harmonicity&quot;, right?<br/>&gt;How come we don&apos;t want to use his term?<br/>&gt;(or have I mangled my understanding of this?<br/>&gt;I am brain-dead from too much theorizing)</p><p>I expect others are confused too, so forgive me for posting your question<br/>to the list.</p><p>The terminology is messy. Barlow&apos;s Harmonicity (and Manuel&apos;s<br/>parameterisation of it) is a &quot;simplicity&quot; measure (not complexity) i.e. the<br/>numbers increase in the same direction as consonance whereas harmonic<br/>complexity measures increase in the direction of dissonance. Take the<br/>reciprocal of (the absolute value of) Barlow&apos;s Harmonicity to convert it to<br/>a complexity measure. I&apos;ve included this in my spreadsheet and called it<br/>Barlow&apos;s Indigestibility, since that&apos;s what he called it when applied to<br/>whole numbers.</p><p>Most related measures increase with dissonance. Barlow&apos;s (and Manuel&apos;s<br/>generalisation of it) appear to be the only ones that don&apos;t. I prefer the<br/>dissonance direction, since otherwise we may end up with an infinity (1/0)<br/>at the unison (as we do with Barlow&apos;s harmonicity).</p><p>*** LCM is the same as product, for dyads ***</p><p>Something else I just realised (duh!). Euler&apos;s Gradus Suavatis and Totient<br/>functions (two COMPLEXITY measures) are first defined for whole numbers,<br/>and then defined for any chord as the Gradus Suavatis or Totient<br/>respectively, of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) divided by Greatest Common<br/>Divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the chord (expressed as n:m:k:j:... where<br/>n,m,k,j,.. are whole numbers. When they are applied to dyads where the<br/>ratio n:d is already in lowest terms, the LCM is the same as the product<br/>n*d (and the GCD is 1), and so these measures suffer from the possible<br/>defect pointed out by Paul Erlich where for example, 15/4 has the same<br/>complexity as 12/5, or 3/2 the same as 6/1. However the disagreement with<br/>perceived dissonance may be taken care of by TOLERANCE in the first case<br/>and SPAN in the second. So they may not amount to a defect in the<br/>COMPLEXITY measure.</p><p>Note also that the LCM of a chord corresponds to the &quot;guide tone&quot; while the<br/>GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) corresponds to the &quot;virtual fundamental&quot;.<br/>These functions are available in Excel and are also useful for obtaining<br/>prime factorisations.</p><p>*** More notes = higher limit ? ***</p><p>Another thing. I looks to me like the more notes there are in a chord, the<br/>higher one can go in COMPLEXITY before TOLERANCE takes over and blurrs the<br/>distinctions between the ratios. We seem to agree that ratios of 11 are<br/>approximately the maximum for dyads, and ratios of 19 for triads. Anyone<br/>want to disagree? Anyone want to suggest approximate limits for tetrads,<br/>pentads etc?</p><p>*** Update of dyadic complexity spreadsheet ***</p><p>My spreadsheet now compares the following 11 harmonic complexity measures<br/>for all ratios up to a maximum sum-of-numerator-and-denominator of 21.</p><p>(n+d)/2<br/>Prime weighted (n+d)/2&#x9;(choose your own weights)<br/>Integer limit<br/>Odd limit<br/>Prime limit<br/>Barlow&apos;s indigestibility /3<br/>Wilson&apos;s complexity /2<br/>Vogel&apos;s complexity /2<br/>Euler&apos;s gradus suavatis /2<br/>Euler&apos;s totient /4<br/>Genovese DF (sqrt)</p><p>The previous version did not contain Vogel&apos;s, and Euler&apos;s pair were<br/>seriously incomplete.</p><p>I&apos;ll add the log-max-prime weighted triangular lattice distance if someone<br/>tells me how to do it. Paul H., Paul E. and Manuel, do you all agree yet?</p><p>It&apos;s grown significantly in size so I&apos;ve zipped it.</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/HarmonicComplexity.zip">http://dkeenan.com/Music/HarmonicComplexity.zip</a>       135kB</p><p>I also zipped my Sethares dissonance spreadsheet but it didn&apos;t shrink much.</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/SetharesDissonance.zip">http://dkeenan.com/Music/SetharesDissonance.zip</a>       636kB</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div>
