(in a word:<br/>babys)</p><p>Anyway,  I am considering the purchase of the korg Oasys PCI or the<br/>Creamware Pulsar I or II.  Oasys is known to be microtonally<br/>capable.  Has anyone tried out this capability and if so what is your<br/>experience with such.  The oasys docs state that one can load a text<br/>tuning table to 1/100th cent accuracy.</p><p>Also, I would like to know the microtonal capabilities of the pulsar<br/>I and Pulsar II.</p><p>That is:</p><p>1.  Can one assign any frequency to any midi note number?</p><p>2.  What is the frequency resolution of the tuning capability?</p><p>3.  How is this accomplished?</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>Gainesville FL</p></div>
