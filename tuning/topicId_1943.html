I noticed that it has a lot of stacked fifths and fourths as<br/>well as thirds, so I decided that this would be a good opportunity to try<br/>schismic temperament. I eventually ended up using all but 5 of a series of<br/>34 fifths, each tempered by 1/9 of a schisma. Parts of the retuned piece<br/>are questionable, but in other cases this tuning made a noticeable<br/>improvement. I even used the 225/224 &quot;bridge&quot; to bring in some<br/>approximations to 7-limit intervals in a couple of places. Both versions<br/>are up on my web page now for comparison.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
