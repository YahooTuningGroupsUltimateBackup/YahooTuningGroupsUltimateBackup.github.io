Only slight<br/>drawback is that it would require the dialog to be a separate process,<br/>so probably would need to be &quot;always on top&quot;, otherwise one would<br/>easily lose it amongst the other windows on the desktop.</p><p>Now you can think about providing some graphics output from<br/>SCALA as well!</p><p>Look forward to seeing what you do and how you do it.</p><p>Robert</p><p>could make a little windows app that you could<br/>spawn, with the text saved to a temporary<br/>file (file name passed on the command line), and then it would paste<br/>that text to the clipboard, delete the temporary file, and exit. I could do it so<br/>that it never shows any windows, so that the whole thing would be<br/>transparent to the user.</p><p>Could also do one to paste text into scala - when you call it, it<br/>gets the contents of the clipboard, and saves it to a temporary file<br/>(you could pass the name on the command line)<br/>which you can then access in SCALA, and delete.</p><p>That way round, SCALA would need to keep checking every<br/>few milliseconds until the temporary file is ready.</p><p>Same could be done for other things. E.g. for the standard<br/>Windows File | Open, explorer window, if you can&apos;t access<br/>that in SCALA, you could call a tiny windows app that would<br/>call it up, and then when user clicks OK, it would<br/>save the file name as contents of a temporary file which<br/>you could then read in SCALA.</p><p>If there is no other way to communicate, one could settle on a<br/>file name that is unlikely to be used, e.g.<br/>3.14159265.OK<br/>or something,<br/>and you keep checking for its presence every twentieth of a second<br/>or something, and when you find it, you know that the  Open<br/>window has exited, and can look for the file name. Or if you find<br/>3.14159265.CANCEL, you know that they clicked &quot;Cancel&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure whether you can spawn it as a child of your window<br/>so that it is always on top of it, but goes behind other windows.<br/>If not, it could be an &quot;always on top&quot; window, as it isn&apos;t so often<br/>that one wants to change to another program while the Open window<br/>is in use.</p><p>I could do a single windows app which would do any of those things,<br/>and anything else in windows that you want, just by passing it<br/>various parameters on the command line.</p><p>Say if you&apos;d like that.</p><p>It would take very little in the way of programming - mostly, some<br/>cut and paste of the relevant code from FTS (which is only a few<br/>lines anyway for most of those things).</p><p>Come to think of it, such a windows prog. could also evolve<br/>into a useful freeware app. that programmers more generally could<br/>distribute with their programs to access these things.</p><p>I wonder if anyone has done that before, but can&apos;t recall seeing it.</p><p>Now you can think about providing some graphics output from<br/>SCALA as well!</p><p>Look forward to seeing what you do and how you do it.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=17813 href="#17813">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>1/22/2001 7:44:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert wrote:</p><p>&gt;Have you thought of making it so that typing the up and down arrow key<br/>&gt;in the command line at the bottom of the main window moves you up<br/>&gt;and down through the command history (like doskey in MSDOS)?</p><p>Indeed, this is high on my to-do list.</p><p>&gt;Can your multi-platform gui access the Windows clipboard?</p><p>I believe so, I also saw things about drag-and-drop, so I will try to<br/>implement this too.<br/>There are some other shortcomings.
