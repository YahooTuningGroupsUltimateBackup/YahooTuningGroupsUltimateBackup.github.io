And I&apos;ve seen this appear just about everywhere: power chords, arpeggios in trance, drum tuning, vocal harmonization, etc...I fully believe you that the fourth was/is considered dissonant in pure interval choral music, but don&apos;t see how that would make, say, the chord CGC used so much in modern music sour.</p><p>&gt;&quot;(this is why I brought up Lucy tuning before - the context is everything for these assessments. )&quot;<br/>    I understand the context is important and that, in some cases IE the major &quot;third&quot; interval 12TET differs considerably from pure...but, so far at least, I don&apos;t see any differences being large enough to matter (if that&apos;s what you&apos;re getting at).

You can see this in the attached image/graph where C:F:C appears mirrored and the amplitude humps seem to lead up to each other while in C:G:C the humps go consistently down and then bump back up suddenly.<br/>   Perhaps &quot;periodicity&quot; isn&apos;t the perfect word to describe it, since something can mathematically have a shorter period but &quot;sound&quot; less periodic (IE seem to the ear to be beating more) in the case of C:G:C vs. C:F:C, for example.  Perhaps the fact the human ear can only hear in the time domain with accuracy of about 1/10th of a second has something to do with this (IE any shortening of period to a period beyond 1/10th of a second may not matter to the human ear while beating may take over as being the leading sense of consonance in a sound).

The reason I&apos;m using visuals is that one &gt;very&lt; easy way to determine how long the period (with even the simplest verbal definition)...is visually by looking for when the waveform repeats.</p><p>    Also from a producer&apos;s point of view (mastering, compression, etc.) you can look at a visual graph and get a good sense how well mixed a file is.  IE if there are lots of sudden spikes (very sudden loud spots followed by soft spots with little lead/fade-in) you can safely assume the instruments either need more compression or to be tuned differently so frequencies don&apos;t duplicate and make sudden loud areas.  As anyone who produces the stuff can tell you, this is incredibly important in things like dance music where production quality standards are very high...and not easy to do well in a song with many instruments.<br/>   The point being that you can either use compression and/or good tuning habits to help you make songs that sound both louder and clearer.  And since hard compression often sounds un-natural and applies to some genres (IE pop and techno) more than others (classical and rock)...I figured it would be interesting to look into how much optimization for loudness and clarity (along with consonance) could be achieved by tuning alone.</p><p>    For the record, lately I&apos;ve been tuning all my drums to the chord C5 F5 A5 C6 (can&apos;t think of the ratios for that chord off the top of my head, feel free to help me out)...and I&apos;ve noticed I no longer need to worry about compression and aliasing and can still get the same type of loudness I&apos;d expect from a highly compressed master.  So, in conclusion, this brings up the question in what ways can tuning be used to lessen the need for un-natural sounding effects (IE ridiculous amounts of compression) in music production?</p><p>-Michael</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Sunday, August 9, 2009 6:22:23 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Periodicity and beating (and example comparing 4ths and 5ths)</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Carl&gt;&quot;I haven&apos;t followed along as well as I&apos;d like, but I think<br/>&gt; the original comparison was C:G:C&apos; vs. C:F:C&apos;, which of<br/>&gt; course would be 2:3:4 vs. 3:4:6.

Again all this periodicity experimentation seems to have implications to audio production in general and not just tuning.</p><p>   Also, notice how in the graph of the 3:4:6 chord the peaks work their way down over 3 peaks and then up over 2 peaks while the 2:3:4 (C:G:C) chord&apos;s peaks work their way down over 3 peaks and then suddenly up all the way on the 4th peak &gt;even&lt; though, of course, C:G:C has the shorter period (4 total peaks vs. 5).  How this translates into sound is that C:G:C sounds more &quot;shaky&quot; than C:F:C despite having a shorter period (sudden loud gains in sound after a period of relatively soft amplitude increases the &quot;shakiness&quot;).  Also, I strongly suspect the shakiness is interpreted by the brain as beating.</p><p>*********************************************<br/>   The flip side (not explained by the graph) is that the C:G:C indeed sounds happier than C:F:C (and more resolved if you consider the emotion of happiness to more-or-less mean resolved) and I figure some people may equate happiness with consonance to a certain extent.

Technically speaking, all rationals are periodic. It&apos;s just that for higher harmonics the repeat time is very large compared to the period of the component frequencies. (For example, if we take 440Hz and 445Hz then these are the 88th and 89th harmonics of 5Hz, and (1/5)sec is very large in comparison). You said something to this effect when you noticed they must be smaller than (1/10)th sec. Since rationals = periodic, it follows that irrationals are aperiodic by definition.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=84351 href="#84351">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2009 5:04:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i chime in because  Rick and I have been talking about this offlist.<br/>I only want to add to the discussion the result of this experiment that shows that the 440 _could not be virtual_ in this case.<br/>I took Ricks recording, filtered out all the generating pitches with a low pass and what remained was 440.<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/440withfilter.mp3">http://anaphoria.com/440withfilter.mp3</a><br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3><a id=84359 href="#84359">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2009 1:37:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>This is mathematically impossible unless the 440 was in the signal to<br/>begin with.
