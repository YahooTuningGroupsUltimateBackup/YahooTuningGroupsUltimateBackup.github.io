I use a couple dozen different,<br/>about 10 continually. As far as &quot;public consumption&quot;, it depends on<br/>the public, and the context. All this fun stuff is my job, and so far<br/>noone has ever even noticed that I do only alternative tunings,<br/>except for the occasional comment that something is too soft and<br/>mellow.</p><p>When there are visuals you can get away with absolutely anything as<br/>far as tuning anyway, even completely mainstream movies use<br/>alternative tunings and trippy sounds of all kinds. With art video,<br/>anything goes- and there are always non-poseur artists and serious<br/>art lovers who are delighted to hear something other than the usual<br/>Max/Msp zooshing and farting or po-mo pastiches.</p><p>&gt; B<br/>&gt; B B B  I am still rather ambiguous as to whether your<br/>scale or my own sounds more &quot;constant in character&quot;...they both sound<br/>about the same to my ears, though yours has a more &quot;minor&quot; feel and<br/>mine a more &quot;major&quot;...so I&apos;m wondering if we can figure out a clever<br/>way to use them in conjunction with each other...</p><p>Don&apos;t know how that would work, but I think either tuning would work<br/>well with straight &quot;simple JI&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>B B B B  ******************************************************************<br/>&gt; B B B  ............I&apos;m also just wondering how you came<br/>up with these ratios.</p><p>The ratios as such don&apos;t matter, I  just got lucky in<br/>deciding to flip-flop multiples of 70, x70/d, n/x70, trying to find<br/>what sounded right. One ratio system I use quite a bit could be<br/>described with this example: 10401/10000, 10402/10000... because it<br/>is measuring in Hz to .01 accuracy over a 104 Hz drone. Sadly the<br/>tuning pots on my discrete analog are not creamy smooth even when<br/>clean because this is my favorite method; record a drone then play<br/>over it tweaking the tuning knob and hitting record when it&apos;s right.</p><p>Then the ratio is Track2-Hz/Track1-Hz. If ratios and proportions were<br/>described by things like &quot;Aunt Mathilda and hang a left at Oki Dogs&quot;<br/>it wouldn&apos;t matter, it&apos;s about sounds and the percieved relationships<br/>between them.</p><p>Numerology approaches which enfore patterns but whose chances of<br/>being audibly acoustically relevant are slim to none seem to be good<br/>for making horrifying sounds. I have one such tuning made on a lark<br/>and I hesitate to use or discuss it because it is very beautiful in a<br/>slinky way but makes me literally ill and I frankly feel that it is<br/>evil. It is like a poisonous green snake.</p><p>B<br/>&gt; B ;B B  Mine came out of just the<br/>&gt;  simplest/lowest-denominator Just Intonation intervals, plus the<br/>square roots over several of them IE sqrt(3/2) IE square root of the<br/>fifth.B  Before I had made a scale purely by ear and came up with<br/>ratios like 1.111 and 3.3333 and 4.4444 and thought &quot;many of these<br/>sound like the results of square roots&quot;, thus leading me to want to<br/>take the square root of fractions to see if I could come close to<br/>reproducing these numbers + find some more new &quot;in character&quot; ratios.</p><p>And if it didn&apos;t sound right you&apos;d toss the idea and look for<br/>something else, and if you couldn&apos;t find anything you&apos;d say whatever<br/>and keep using the tuning because you like it, right? In that case<br/>we&apos;ve got the same basic approach.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; *****************************************<br/>&gt; B B  I think we may truly be on to something...one thing<br/>that seems obvious is making notes consonant relative to each other<br/>is not enough in and of itself.B</p><p>Literal consonance and euphony and artistic worth aren&apos;t all the same<br/>thing.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
