I&apos;ve known him by email for a while. He told<br/>me he has also made these guitars for Joe Satriani an John McLaughlin.<br/>We&apos;re doing a cd trade so hopefully I&apos;ll be playing his music on the<br/>show in the weeks to come. (Special Hindustani Guitar show on right<br/>now as I type!)</p><p>I just heard Ned&apos;s stuff for the first time a couple of days ago (I<br/>had never even heard of him before you posted this bit a while back)<br/>and I think it&apos;s fabulous! He&apos;s really making the fretless the front<br/>and center focal point of his music... and all its playing<br/>idiosyncrasies and timbral quirks are set into his music like fine<br/>jewels. Mightily impressive!</p><p>Dan</p></div>
