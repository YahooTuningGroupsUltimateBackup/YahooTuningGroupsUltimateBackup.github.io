I&apos;ve had a wonderful time and learned so much in this<br/>&gt; &quot;learning exchange&quot;, but it has become, for me, an addiction.<br/>&gt; Which means that I&apos;m not getting other things done that I want<br/>&gt; to get done.</p><p>&gt; [Dan Stearns, TD 267.3]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I (for one) am really sorry to hear this... Hopefully the TD<br/>&gt; will become a manageable addiction, and you&apos;ll soon be back...<br/>&gt; I have personally come to regard the TD as a pretty singular<br/>&gt; and dynamic source of theoretical (or technical) information<br/>&gt; exchange that I can&apos;t quite imagine finding anywhere else...<br/>&gt; and as far as I&apos;m concerned, your contribution (to it) will be<br/>&gt; sorely missed.</p><p>I second everything Dan says.  Dave, your posts have been some<br/>of the most informative and interesting that I&apos;ve seen here, and<br/>your webpages about tuning have a visual beauty that *really*<br/>appeals to me.</p><p>I can understand being addicted to the Tuning List - it happened<br/>to me too.  The only thing that brought me out of it was:<br/>getting addicted to another List (about Mahler).  Then the<br/>attention required by a new girlfriend quickly got me out of<br/>that one.</p><p>I hope you can find a way to deal with your addiction to the<br/>Tuning List while remaining a subscriber, so that the *occasional*<br/>post from you will be forthcoming... I certainly will look<br/>forward to anything else you have to say in the future about<br/>tuning.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
