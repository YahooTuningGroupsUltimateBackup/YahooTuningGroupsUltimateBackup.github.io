The<br/>course uses the harmonic structure as the basis for the exploration of the underlying<br/>meaning of musical intervals.</p><p>This class will teach the fundamentals of rhythm and music notation: ABCs of notes, how<br/>notes combine to create intervals, scales and modes and how these combine in turn into<br/>voice lines, chords and harmonic motion. Throughout the factual material we will use our<br/>senses to perceive experientially.to explore the energies behind intervals and certain<br/>types of motion and rhythms.

And to experience energetically what<br/>is learned intellectually.</p><p>Call David at (415) 777-2486 or email David@...</p></div>
