S. B. Woolhouse, who wrote in the 19th century: &quot;It is<br/>&gt; very misleading to suppose that the necessity of temperament<br/>&gt; applies only to instruments which have fixed tones.  Singers<br/>&gt; and performers on perfect instruments must all temper their<br/>&gt; intervals, or they could not keep in tune with each other,<br/>&gt; or even with themselves; an on arriving at the same notes<br/>&gt; by different routes, would be continually finding a want<br/>&gt; of agreement.  The scale of equal temperament obviates all<br/>&gt; such inconveniences, and continues to be universally accepted<br/>&gt; with unqualified satisfaction by the most eminent vocalists;<br/>&gt; and equally so by the most renowned and accomplished performers<br/>&gt; on stringed instruments, although these instruments are capable<br/>&gt; of an indefinite variety of intonation. The high development<br/>&gt; of modern instrumental music would not have been possible,<br/>&gt; and could not have been acquired, without the manifold<br/>&gt; advantages of tempered intonation by equal semitones, and<br/>&gt; it has, in consequence, long become the established basis of<br/>&gt; tuning.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    At present, although most of us see the belief in the<br/>&gt; absolute supremacy of integers as applied to music to be<br/>&gt; naive, it also seems, as Paul Erlich has said with regard<br/>&gt; to simultaneous notes, that integer ratios or very near<br/>&gt; integer ratios (closer than called for by 12-EQT) correspond<br/>&gt; to a psychological reality as regards our perception of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I believe that Mr. Woolhouse, in stating that equal<br/>&gt; temperament is rightly the long established basis of tuning,<br/>&gt; really went too far and overlooked the fact of experience<br/>&gt; that the deviations of equal temperament from the just ratios<br/>&gt; are so large that they really do have an appreciable effect<br/>&gt; on the sound of music performed in equal temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Some of Mr. Woolhouse&apos;s contemporaries strongly disagreed<br/>&gt; with him, too.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 439.11]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that Wesley Woolhouse was a prominent advocate of<br/>&gt; _19_ tone equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 439.12]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, my knowledge of Woolhouse&apos;s theories suggests<br/>&gt; that he viewed some form of meantone temperament to be ideal.<br/>&gt; According to Mandelbaum, Woolhouse derived an optimal meantone<br/>&gt; tuning (I believe it was the squared-error optimal tuning for<br/>&gt; the three 5-limit consonances, namely 7/26-comma meantone),<br/>&gt; and decided that 19-tone equal tempermant was a close enough<br/>&gt; approximation, and one which gave to the musician the desirable<br/>&gt; properties of a closed system which were giving 12-equal its<br/>&gt; rise to prominence at the time. In fact, 31- or 50-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperaments would be better approximations (though not as<br/>&gt; convenient from a practical point of view), and neither of<br/>&gt; those tunings commits any errors l<br/>rger than 6 cents in any<br/>&gt; of the classic (5-limit) consonant intervals. 19-equal has<br/>&gt; major thirds and perfect fifths that are over 7 cents off.<br/>&gt; 12-equal, of course, has major thirds 14 cents off and minor<br/>&gt; thirds 16 cents off.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Second and more importantly, I think Dave Hill has missed<br/>&gt; the importance of the last quoted statement (from Woolhouse)<br/>&gt; above. Many if not most common-practice musical passages<br/>&gt; performed in just intonation would result in contradictory<br/>&gt; tunings for the same written pitch. Whether or not Mr.<br/>&gt; Woolhouse went &quot;too far&quot;, Mr. Hill has failed to address<br/>&gt; Woolhouse&apos;s point here. Furthermore, far from overlooking<br/>&gt; the errors from just intonation, Woolhouse sought the best<br/>&gt; way to reduce them while preserving the musical meaning<br/>&gt; of the notes in the Western tradition.</p><p>&gt; [Dave Hill, TD 440.1]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I took the quote from Woolhouse from the book: &quot;Piano Tuning&quot;<br/>&gt; by J. Cree Fischer.  The book was originally published in<br/>&gt; 1907.  I have the Dover edition of 1975.  The author, Fischer,<br/>&gt; introduces the quote from Woolhouse as follows (p. 144 of the<br/>&gt; Dover edition):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot;That the equal temperament is the only practical temperament,<br/>&gt; is confidently affirmed by Mr. W. S. B. Woolhouse, an eminent<br/>&gt; authority on musical mathematics, who says:-  &apos;It is very<br/>&gt; misleading to suppose that the necessity of temperament applies<br/>&gt; only to instruments which have fixed tones...  - rest of longish<br/>&gt; quote - &apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Apart from the quotation in Fischer, I know nothing about<br/>&gt; W. S. B. Woolhouse excepting that he lived in the 19th century<br/>&gt; and that he is mentioned in Ellis&apos; translation of Helmholtz<br/>&gt; in connection with a 19 tone equal temperament.  In posting<br/>&gt; the quote to the tuning list, I assumed Mr. Fischer&apos;s<br/>&gt; reliability in conveying Mr. Woolhouse&apos;s point of view.<br/>&gt; Is it possible that Mr. Woolhouse had done studies on 19 tone<br/>&gt; equal temperament, but nevertheless emphatically advocated<br/>&gt; the more usual 12 equal temperament for practical musical<br/>&gt; performance?<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; [Carl Lumma, TD 440.7]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul Erlich wrote...]<br/>&gt; Whether or not Mr. Woolhouse went &quot;too far&quot;, Mr. Hill has<br/>&gt; failed to address Woolhouse&apos;s point here. Furthermore, far<br/>&gt; from overlooking the errors from just intonation, Woolhouse<br/>&gt; sought the best way to reduce them while preserving the<br/>&gt; musical meaning of the notes in the Western tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would unquestionably involve meantone.  But there are<br/>&gt; two points I&apos;d like to make here: &lt;etc...snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 441.16]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave Hill wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Is it possible that Mr. Woolhouse had done studies on<br/>&gt;&gt; 19 tone equal temperament, but nevertheless emphatically<br/>&gt;&gt; advocated the more usual 12 equal temperament for practical<br/>&gt;&gt; musical performance?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Quite possible, given what composers of his time were trying<br/>&gt; to do (by the 19th century, most composers thought of G# and<br/>&gt; Ab, etc., as entirely interchageable and used such enharmonic<br/>&gt; equivalency to modulate around fractions or the entirety of<br/>&gt; the circle of fifths). However, his advocacy of 19-tone equal<br/>&gt; tempermant, though it would not allow such practices, clearly<br/>&gt; had a very &quot;practical&quot; component, since the &quot;optimal&quot; meantone<br/>&gt; he derived (from 16th-18th century musical considerations)<br/>&gt; was essentially 50-tone equal temperament, and the only<br/>&gt; possible reason for suggesting 19 instead of 50 would be a<br/>&gt; practical one of actually getting all those notes onto<br/>&gt; instruments.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Woolhouse&apos;s book<br/>================</p><p>Introductory<br/>------------</p><p>The references here to Woolhouse are all from secondary sources:<br/>Dave Hill quoting Fisher 1907, and Paul Erlich summarizing<br/>Mandelbaum 1961.</p><p>I just got myself a copy of Woolhouse&apos;s little book yesterday,<br/>and as I seem to be the only one on the List who has it, thought<br/>it would be good to give a brief summary of the book.</p><p>Here&apos;s the full citation:</p><p>Woolhouse, W.

Our consonances will thus be<br/>&gt; limited to the proportions -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4/5, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 1/2<br/>&gt;</p><p>[p 10] Woolhouse devises the following pentatonic scale from<br/>the basic 5-limit JI ratios:</p><p>note interval     ratio  string-length</p><p>C   octave          2/1   180/360<br/>A   sixth-major     5/3   216/360<br/>G   fifth           3/2   240/360<br/>F   fourth          4/3   270/360<br/>E   third-major     5/4   288/360<br/>C   first/keynote   1/1   360/360</p><p>Woolhouse then observes that 240/180 = 360/270 (= 4/3)<br/>and divides this scale into 2 &apos;tetrachords&apos; (even tho<br/>they only have 3 notes at this point) which have dissimilar<br/>spacing, then adds &apos;D&apos; and &apos;B&apos; to the scale to &apos;equalize&apos;<br/>each tetrachord, using the following ratios:</p><p>note interval     ratio  string-length</p><p>B   seventh        15/5   192/360<br/>C   second          9/8   320/360</p><p>which produces the usual 5-limit JI &apos;major&apos; scale:</p><p>      A---E---B<br/>     / \ / \ / \<br/>    F---C---G---D</p><p>The &apos;mean semitone&apos;<br/>...................</p><p>[p 12] Woolhouse defines &apos;mean semitone&apos; as 2^(1/12).  He<br/>shows the mean semitone values of the JI intervals, almost<br/>exactly the same way I use Semitones (the exception being<br/>that he carries the decimal part further than 2 places).</p><p>He explains [p 11-16] how to calculate string-lengths of the<br/>12-tET scale for comparison to the just ratios.</p><p>The basic JI intervals for scale construction<br/>.............................................</p><p>Then he defines [p 17] the following basic intervals (I have<br/>added the tilde [~] to indicate that a value is only approximate):</p><p> interval    ratio  mean semitones</p><p>major-tone    9/8    ~2.0391<br/>minor-tone   10/9    ~1.8240<br/>limma        16/15   ~1.1173</p><p>(Note that this definition of _limma_ is quite different<br/>from the usual Pythagorean one, which makes it equal to<br/>256/243 [= ~0.90 Semitone]; it is in fact much closer to<br/>the larger Pythagorean semitone, the _apotome_ [= ~1.12<br/>Semitones].  See my Tuning Dictionary.)</p><p>730-tET as a basic unit<br/>.......................</p><p>Towards the end of this chapter [p 18-19] comes Woolhouse&apos;s most<br/>original contribution:  730-tET, using 2^(1/730) as the basic unit<br/>of measurement for the comparison of different intervals - a<br/>precursor to Ellis&apos;s use of 2^(1/1200) = 1 cent in his 1875<br/>translation of Helmholtz.</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 18]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It will be useful to divide the octave into such a number<br/>&gt; of equal divisions that each interval of the scale may comprise<br/>&gt; an integral number of them ... such as will render the major<br/>&gt; and minor-tones and limma whole numbers, since all other<br/>&gt; intervals result from the various combinations of these<br/>&gt; elemental ones.</p><p>Note the emphasis on his 5-limit JI conception here.</p><p>He examines some other notably accurate divisions of the &apos;octave&apos;:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 19]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has been proposed by some to divide the octave into 53<br/>&gt; divisions, taking 9 of them for the major-tone, 8 for the<br/>&gt; minor-tone, and 5 for the limma [the 15:16 semitone], which<br/>&gt; furnishes a pretty accurate scale.</p><p>[p 20]<br/>Woolhouse mentions likening the octave to a circle, and<br/>using degrees, minutes, and seconds to measure the intervals.<br/>This amounts to 1296000-tET (yes, that&apos;s over a million degrees:<br/>360 * 60 * 60), which Woolhouse dismisses as &apos;of no advantage<br/>in musical computations&apos;.</p><p>Then he mentions 301-tET of Sir J. Herschel [paper on &apos;Sound&apos;,<br/>vol 2 of mixed sciences, _Encyclopedia Metropolitana_], and<br/>presents a table comparing the errors from JI for 301-, 53-,<br/>and 730-tET, which shows that</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p ]<br/>&gt; the last, which has been found by various trials, is that<br/>&gt; which differs less than any other from the true series,<br/>&gt; unless we ascend to very high numbers; and is the one which<br/>&gt; is therefore most to be recommended&apos;.</p><p>Woolhouse chose this division precisely because he wished to<br/>avoid using decimals or fractions, and the integer values<br/>of 730-tET designating the three basic intervals of 15:16, 9:10,<br/>and 8:9 are so close to the actual JI values:</p><p> interval       ratio   mean semitones   log(ratio)/(730/log(2))</p><p>JI:</p><p>major-tone       9/8       ~2.0391   t         ~124.045<br/>minor-tone      10/9       ~1.8240   t,        ~110.962<br/>limma           16/15      ~1.1173   _theta_   ~ 67.970<br/>comma           81/80      ~0.2151   c         ~ 13.083</p><p>730-tET:</p><p>major-tone   2^(124/730)   ~2.0384   t           124.000<br/>minor-tone   2^(111/730)   ~1.8247   t,          111.000<br/>limma        2^( 68/730)   ~1.1178   _theta_      68.000<br/>comma        2^( 13/730)   ~0.2137   c            13.000</p><p>(He uses the actual Greek letter _theta_ to represent the<br/>_limma_.)</p><p>Woolhouse gives the more exact value (which I placed at the<br/>end of the first table), then notes how closely the integer<br/>values (which I put in the second table) approximate them.<br/>He will use the abbreviations in his math equations.</p><p>Problems with JI<br/>................</p><p>The conclusion of this second chapter:</p><p>[p 23] Woolhouse refers us back to where he selected an<br/>arbitrary measurement for &apos;D&apos; and &apos;B&apos;, the &apos;2nd&apos; and &apos;7th&apos;<br/>of the scale, respectively, to &apos;equalize&apos; the two tetrachords.<br/>Now he emphasizes the arbitrariness of that choice, and says<br/>that the &apos;2nd&apos; my be tuned either to 9/8, to give fit it<br/>into the harmonic series over the &apos;keynote&apos;, or 10/9, which<br/>makes the intervallic structure of the tetrachords identical.</p><p>[p 24] Then follows Woolhouse&apos;s crucial statement concerning<br/>JI versus temperament, without mentioning commatic drift:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 24]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This difference in the note D, which in theory is a comma,<br/>&gt; is entirely done away with in practice, as the harmonic<br/>&gt; advantages which could be derived from the true theoretical<br/>&gt; scale, as directed by nature, would by no means compensate<br/>&gt; the difficulties of its performance.</p><p>Harmonics<br/>---------</p><p>The third chapter [p 25-35] is an explanation of harmonics,<br/>about which most here know plenty already.  Woolhouse gives<br/>tables [p 30-31] showing harmonics up to the 20th, and the<br/>&apos;error&apos; of the harmonics from the &apos;true diatonic&apos; (i.e.,<br/>5-limit JI).</p><p>Without making any claims for their use, he gives measurements<br/>[p 33-35] which show how to get the set of &apos;natural harmonics&apos;<br/>on a violin, thus encouraging the reader to experiment.</p><p>Temperament<br/>-----------</p><p>The fourth chapter is Woolhouse&apos;s exploration of temperament,<br/>which really forms the climax of the book.</p><p>He starts out [p 36] with an emphasis on &apos;a very approximate<br/>diatonic series on the assumption of any one of them as a<br/>key-note&apos;, whose &apos;practical formation&apos; demands temperament.</p><p>12-tET<br/>......</p><p>First is an examination of 12-tET, noting that its &apos;greatest<br/>imperfections are those of the 3rd and 6th&apos;, with a maximum<br/>of 9&amp;1/2 &apos;degrees&apos; [= ~15.64 cents] deviation, and after<br/>tabulating all the &apos;errors&apos; from JI, he says that</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 38]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These deviations, however, which are considerably less<br/>&gt; than a comma or 13 degrees [= 2^(13/730) = ~21.37 cents],<br/>&gt; are too small to affect, in a very sensible degree, the<br/>&gt; melody of the intervals.</p><p>Note that here he emphasizes the perception of melody and<br/>not of harmony.  He also says [p 38-39] that any human tuner<br/>is bound to commit small errors because of the imperfections<br/>of his hearing, and that because of this, it is futile to<br/>argue that 12-tET produces a blandness which the unequal<br/>temperaments don&apos;t have.  (Sounds like Johnny Reinhard<br/>saying &apos;people aren&apos;t perfect...12-equal *is* microtonal!...&apos;)</p><p>He explains very briefly [p 40-41] that 12-tET can be<br/>tuned by tempering the &apos;5ths&apos; &apos;about one degree [= 2^(1/730)<br/>= ~1.64 cents] flat&apos;, because &apos;each fifth must contain<br/>425&amp;5/6 degrees&apos;.  The exact figure is obviously 1&amp;1/6<br/>degrees [= 2^((7/6)/730) = ~1.92 cents].</p><p>This may be done either with an ascending series of &apos;5ths&apos;<br/>(C to A#, with the break in notation between A# and F, from<br/>where the cycle repeats) or a descending series (which Woolhouse<br/>again, this time strangely, notates as sharps), the latter<br/>being the usual method used.</p><p>Finally on 12-tET he concludes:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 41]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This scale [12-tET] is, without doubt, the best one for<br/>&gt; such instruments as the common pianoforte, organ, &amp;c. which<br/>&gt; must necessarily have but one sound for both a sharp and the<br/>&gt; flat of the next upper note.</p><p>I don&apos;t really understand why he says that, because all thru<br/>the rest of the book he stresses that the goal of his work<br/>is to find a good tempered approximation to 5-limit JI which<br/>will give a practicable closed system, and he will go on to<br/>choose a meantone and several ETs which all fulfill these<br/>wishes better than 12-tET.  But there it is.</p><p>I think examining that paragraph alone like this is a perfect<br/>example of taking something out of context.</p><p>It seems to me at first like he&apos;s making a great praise that<br/>ultimately turns out to be pretty empty.  In what instance<br/>must a keyboard &apos;necessarily have but one sound for both a<br/>sharp and the flat of the next upper note&apos;?</p><p>An emphasis on that sentence seems to me to betray a slyly<br/>indignant way of implying that if one chooses to have an<br/>instrument specially built with more than 12 keys, then<br/>there are other temperaments that are better. And indeed,<br/>the rest of the book will pretty much bear this out.</p><p>The optimal temperament: 6/13- &amp; 9/26-comma meantone<br/>....................................................</p><p>He immediately continues by saying that a system of temperament<br/>that gives two different sizes of semitone provides a much<br/>better approximation to JI.</p><p>[p 42] With echoes of Marchetto, Woolhouse discusses the<br/>&apos;major&apos; or &apos;diatonic semitone&apos;, the &apos;minor&apos; or &apos;chromatic<br/>semitone&apos;, and the &apos;enharmonic diesis&apos;, the latter being<br/>the difference between the two former.  Their relationships<br/>can be summarized thus:</p><p>diatonic semitone  &gt; (9/8)^(1/2)<br/>chromatic semitone &lt; (9/8)^(1/2)<br/>enharmonic diesis = diatonic - [minus] chromatic semitones</p><p>And here he utters the most important sentence in the book<br/>(and the basis of Paul&apos;s admiration of his work), where he<br/>sets out:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 45]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... to ascertain the particular values which must be assigned<br/>&gt; to the *tone* and *diatonic semitone*, so that all the concords<br/>&gt; shall be affected with the least possible imperfections; and<br/>&gt; this we shall effect by the principle of least squares.  We<br/>&gt; must first observe, that the *third-minor*, *third-major* and<br/>&gt; *fourth*, are the only concords necessary to be considered,<br/>&gt; because the others are merely the inversions of these, and<br/>&gt; we know that any error which may increase or diminish a concord,<br/>&gt; will have precisely the same effect in decreasing or increasing<br/>&gt; its inversion, as the octave, which is composed of them both,<br/>&gt; is unchangeable.</p><p>(This is the same method Paul used to discover his 7/26-comma<br/>meantone tuning.)</p><p>Putting that on a lattice for a geometric view of the situation:</p><p>           E<br/>          / \<br/>        M3   m3<br/>        m6   M6<br/>       /       \<br/>      C -P4/P5- G</p><p>It should be obvious that the 5-limit lattice can be extended<br/>infinitely in both dimensions by adding on additional cells<br/>just like this one (or parts of it), thus proving Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>statement.</p><p>Then [p 43-45] he uses algebra to find the difference between<br/>JI and this ideal temperament with _tau_ to represent the<br/>tempered tone and _sigma_ to represent the diatonic semitone,<br/>and the other abbreviations presented earlier for the JI<br/>intervals, to make up the six intervals on my lattice.</p><p>The result is:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 45]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _tau_   =      t, + (6/13)c = 117 degrees<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _sigma_ = _theta_ + (9/26)c = 72&amp;1/2 degrees<br/>&gt;</p><p>Or in English and math:</p><p>tempered tone     = (10/9)  * ((81/80)^(6/13)) = 2^(~117.001/730)<br/>tempered semitone = (16/15) * ((81/80)^(9/26)) = 2^(~ 72.499/730)</p><p>He notes that the relationship between these two is &apos;very<br/>nearly in the ratio of 8 to 5&apos;.  More precise figures are<br/>~1.613832172 : 1  =  ~8.06916086 : 5.  Thus,</p><p>50-tET<br/>......</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 45]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We may therefore divide the octave into 50 equal divisions,<br/>&gt; and appropriate 8 of them to the tone and 6 to the diatonic<br/>&gt; semitone.</p><p>Woolhouse is assuming a diatonic scale with a basic interval<br/>mapping of 5L,2s; that is, 5 large &apos;steps&apos; and 2 small ones.<br/>Solving the simple algebraic equation 5L + 2s = 50 gives</p><p>L = 2s - 2</p><p>s = L/2 + 1</p><p>L = 8 and s = 5</p><p>This produces a basic scale of 21-out-of-50 tones per octave,<br/>which Woolhouse illustrates as follows with the number of 50-tET<br/>degrees between both the Diatonic and Chromatic scale members<br/>(I have added ratios and Semitones, and for comparison, the<br/>cents-values for his optimal 6/13-&amp;-9/26-comma):</p><p>                     50-tET          6/13-&amp;-9/26-comma meantone</p><p>                 ratio    cents     cents   difference of 50-tET</p><p>   /  C   \     2^(50/50)  1200    1200.000      0.000<br/>  |        2<br/>  |   B#  &lt;     2^(48/50)  1152   ~1153.978      1.978<br/>  5        1<br/>  |   Cb  &lt;     2^(47/50)  1128   ~1126.846     -1.154<br/>  |        2<br/>   &gt;  B   &lt;     2^(45/50)  1080   ~1080.824      0.824<br/>  |        3<br/>  |   Bb  &lt;     2^(42/50)  1008   ~1007.670     -0.330<br/>  8        2<br/>  |   A#  &lt;     2^(40/50)   960   ~961.648       1.648<br/>  |        3<br/>   &gt;  A   &lt;     2^(37/50)   888   ~888.495       0.495<br/>  |        3<br/>  |   Ab  &lt;     2^(34/50)   816   ~815.341      -0.659<br/>  8        2<br/>  |   G#  &lt;     2^(32/50)   768   ~769.319       1.319<br/>  |        3<br/>   &gt;  G   &lt;     2^(29/50)   696   ~696.165       0.165<br/>  |        3<br/>  |   Gb  &lt;     2^(26/50)   624   ~623.011      -0.989<br/>  8        2<br/>  |   F#  &lt;     2^(24/50)   576   ~576.989       0.989<br/>  |        3<br/>   &gt;  F   &lt;     2^(21/50)   504   ~503.835      -0.165<br/>  |        2<br/>  |   E#  &lt;     2^(19/50)   456   ~457.813       1.813<br/>  5        1<br/>  |   Fb  &lt;     2^(18/50)   432   ~430.681      -1.319<br/>  |        2<br/>   &gt;  E   &lt;     2^(16/50)   384   ~384.659       0.659<br/>  |        3<br/>  |   Eb  &lt;     2^(13/50)   312   ~311.505      -0.495<br/>  8        2<br/>  |   D#  &lt;     2^(11/50)   264   ~265.484       1.484<br/>  |        3<br/>   &gt;  D   &lt;     2^( 8/50)   192   ~192.330       0.330<br/>  |        3<br/>  |   Db  &lt;     2^( 5/50)   120   ~119.176      -0.824<br/>  8        2<br/>  |   C#  &lt;     2^( 3/50)    72   ~ 73.154       1.154<br/>  |        3<br/>   \  C   /     2^( 0/50)     0      0.000       0.000</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 46]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This system is precisely the same as that which Dr. Smith,<br/>&gt; in his Treatise on harmonics [Smith 1759], calls the scale<br/>&gt; of equal harmony.  It is decidedly the most perfect of any<br/>&gt; systems in which the tones are all alike.</p><p>Based on this scale, Woolhouse gives a list [p 47] of<br/>&apos;all the major-keys which are necessary in music&apos;, which<br/>can be summarized as:</p><p>2^(x/50)</p><p>      / (C)<br/>  5<br/>      &gt;  B<br/>  3<br/>      &gt;  Bb<br/>  5<br/>      &gt;  A<br/>  3<br/>      &gt;  Ab<br/>  5<br/>      &gt;  G<br/>  3<br/>      &gt;  Gb<br/>  5<br/>      &gt;  F<br/>  5<br/>      &gt;  E<br/>  3<br/>      &gt;  Eb<br/>  5<br/>      &gt;  D<br/>  3<br/>      &gt;  Db<br/>  5<br/>      \  C</p><p>and he proposes [p 48] to eliminate F#, C# and Cb major<br/>as superfluous.</p><p>31-tET<br/>......</p><p>Woolhouse then gives [p 49] the same kind of description of<br/>Huygens&apos;s 31-tET, about which he says:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 49]<br/>&gt; This scale, therefore, has the greatest temperament in the<br/>&gt; minor-third, and its inversion the major-sixth, which is the<br/>&gt; principal objection to it, as it is known that these concords<br/>&gt; are most readily put out of tune, and consequently should have<br/>&gt; the least temperament.  However, taking all into account, it<br/>&gt; must be acknowledged to be a very good scale.</p><p>19-tET<br/>......</p><p>Next he considers 19-tET:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 50]<br/>&gt; For the practical tuning of a keyed instrument, such as the<br/>&gt; organ, in which the full enharmonic scale is to be introduced,<br/>&gt; perhaps the best method after all would be to divide the octave<br/>&gt; into 19 equal intervals by 20 keys.</p><p>and he gives a list of all the keys and a diagram of how it<br/>could be produced on a keyboard.</p><p>53-tET<br/>......</p><p>He then analyzes the resources of a 53-tET &apos;enharmonic organ&apos;,<br/>built by J. Robson and Son, St. Martin&apos;s-lane, but says that<br/>the number of keys is too much to be practicable, and settles<br/>again on 19-tET.</p><p>[p 56]</p><p>Woolhouse gives a table providing exact monochord-string<br/>measurements for 12-, 19-, 31-, 50-, and 53-tET.</p><p>Beats of Imperfect Concords<br/>---------------------------</p><p>The last regular chapter in the book, &apos;Beats of Imperfect<br/>Concords&apos;, is a detailed examination of beats arising from<br/>the 5 equal-temperaments listed in the table.</p><p>After elaborating on the most scrupulous methods for<br/>experimenting with the tuning of a stretched string, including<br/>laying it vertically rather than horizontally so the pressure<br/>of the string on the bridge will not affect the tuning,<br/>and putting the effect of the earth&apos;s gravity into his equation,<br/>he says:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 64]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the pitch-note A vibrates about 424 times in one second.<br/>&gt; This may differ one or two vibrations from the truth, on<br/>&gt; account of the unavoidable small defects of the materials<br/>&gt; used in the experiment.</p><p>So Woolhouse expresses his limit of accuracy here in Hz<br/>as about 1/4 percent .</p><p>He gives a table [p 65] showing the beat divisors for 12-,<br/>19-, 31-, 50-, and 53-tET, and at the end of this chapter<br/>[p 66-68] gives the beats for all &apos;5ths&apos; in the 12- and<br/>19-tET systems.</p><p>Miscellaneous Additions<br/>-----------------------</p><p>The final section of the book, &apos;Miscellaneous Additions&apos;,<br/>gives some specific information regarding various instruments,<br/>from tuning forks to strings to winds, with observations<br/>on how the latter two apply to pianos &amp; harpsichords, and<br/>organs, respectively.</p><p>My conclusions<br/>==============</p><p>I know nothing of any of Woolhouse&apos;s other work, but according<br/>to this book, he seems to have only been resigned to accepting<br/>the error involved in 12-tET because of its ubiquity and<br/>practicality.</p><p>In fact, looking thru the Table of Contents again, it seems to<br/>me now like he ingeniously praised 12-tET for its practicality,<br/>and then demonstrated just that in his tuning guide, for a few<br/>pages, just to &apos;hook&apos; the reader into something familiar,<br/>before his short but complex foray into optimum meantone and<br/>then (with a quick segue) into temperaments that approximated<br/>them well.</p><p>He certainly noted the disadvantages of strict 5-limit JI, yet<br/>he sought ultimately a temperament which would approximate it<br/>better than 12-tET.</p><p>Knowing from Fischer 1907 only that quote posted by Dave,<br/>I would venture to say that Fischer approved of 12-tET<br/>and quoted Woolhouse a bit out of context to make him<br/>appear a champion of that tuning.  [...confirm, Dave?]</p><p>But based on a reading of Woolhouse&apos;s _Essay_, it is clear<br/>that he preferred several other temperaments which approximated<br/>5-limit JI better than the 12-tET system is capable of, with<br/>19-tET giving the &apos;most bang for the buck&apos; in terms of the<br/>mutually exclusive aims of better approximation to JI and<br/>practicality on instruments, especially those of fixed pitch.</p><p>Woolhouse doesn&apos;t talk specifically about notation much,<br/>but he mentions enough about those of 19- and 50-tET to<br/>offer that as another advantage over the more cumbersome<br/>possibilities.</p><p>I had only scanned thru Mandelbaum 1961 once at Johnny<br/>Reinhard&apos;s, reading certain small parts of it more deeply<br/>because hey piqued my interest.  Most of what I remember<br/>was my first encounter with Fokker&apos;s work, but if I did<br/>read about Woolhouse and don&apos;t remember, I can say now<br/>that based on what Paul wrote in TDs 439.12 and 441.16,<br/>Mandelbaum gives an excellent summary of Woolhouse&apos;s book.<br/>(If Paul did the summarizing, then kudos to you Paul!)</p><p>Citing Mandelbaum on Woolhouse, these statements are<br/>absolutely correct:</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 439.12]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, my knowledge of Woolhouse&apos;s theories suggests<br/>&gt; that he viewed some form of meantone temperament to be ideal.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt; According to Mandelbaum, Woolhouse derived an optimal meantone<br/>&gt; tuning (I believe it was the squared-error optimal tuning for<br/>&gt; the three 5-limit consonances,</p><p>Indeed it was - Woolhouse&apos;s description led me to believe<br/>originally that I&apos;d be discussing two different tunings right<br/>here...</p><p>:)  (more on that below)</p><p>&gt; namely 7/26-comma meantone),</p><p>In a private email he&apos;s given me permission to share, Paul<br/>said:</p><p>&gt; It seems he was about an eyelash away from discovering my<br/>&gt; cherished 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>I was going to say: it&apos;s still &apos;no cigar&apos;, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s<br/>closer than an eyelash away.  Take a look at this analysis:</p><p>The total difference between the sum of ratios in JI and those<br/>in the meantone is 3 commas.  This must be spread over all<br/>notes in the scale to make the &apos;octave&apos; be 1:2, which is<br/>specified by Woolhouse.</p><p>The amounts added to the JI &apos;tone&apos; and &apos;semitone&apos; are<br/>respectively 6/13- [= 12/26] and 9/26-comma.</p><p>3 commas, each divided into 26 parts = (3*26)/26<br/>= 78/26 commas.</p><p>What I find most interesting about Woolhouse&apos;s approach<br/>is that it is more along the lines of what I&apos;ve just recently<br/>gotten very involved in, via Dan Stearns: L&amp;s mapping.</p><p>Noticing that Woolhouse based his meantone not on a constant<br/>7/26-comma applied to all intervals as Paul did, but rather<br/>on the *two* basic intervals of the scale, the &apos;tone&apos; and<br/>&apos;semitone&apos;, which are respectively the L and s intervals<br/>in a &apos;5L,2s&apos; mapping, applying different amounts of tempering<br/>to the two different intervals:</p><p>                         ratio                 Semitones</p><p>tempered tone     = (10/ 9)*((81/80)^(6/13)) = ~1.92<br/>tempered semitone = (16/15)*((81/80)^(9/26)) = ~1.19</p><p>I saw that the total scale was:</p><p>(5*(10/9)*((81/80)^(6/13))) + (2*(16/15)*((81/80)^(9/26)))</p><p>Focusing on the addition of just the commatic parts<br/>shows how Woolhouse divided the 3-comma discrepancy:</p><p>     3/1  commas<br/>=   78/26<br/>=   60/26  +   18/26<br/>=   30/13  +   18/26<br/>= (5*6/13) + (2*9/26)  commas</p><p>which (I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any significance) can be<br/>further reduced to:</p><p>= 5*(3*4) + 2*(3*3) / 26<br/>= ((2^2)*3*5) + (2*(3^2)) / (2*13)  commas</p><p>(Paul can manipulate these numbers better, and perhaps show<br/>some new insight into what Woolhouse is doing.)</p><p>But the 5L,2s mapping puts the &apos;7&apos; in there... don&apos;t know<br/>if that means anything either, in regard to 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>Now, the reason why I wrote earlier that &apos;I was going to say...&apos;:</p><p>Paul sent me a table of cents-values of his 7/26-comma<br/>meantone diatonic &apos;major&apos; scale carried out to three decimal<br/>places, and it was exactly the same as Woolhouse&apos;s temperament<br/>at that accuracy level:</p><p>    50-tET    6/13-&amp;-9/26-comma<br/>             AND 7/26-comma meantone</p><p>C    1200       1200.000<br/>B    1080      ~1080.824<br/>A     888      ~ 888.495<br/>G     696      ~ 696.165<br/>F     504      ~ 503.835<br/>E     384      ~ 384.659<br/>D     192      ~ 192.330<br/>C       0          0.000</p><p>I was intrigued by this and decided to do the calculation<br/>myself and see how far I had to take the decimal place<br/>to find a difference.  After trying 12 decimal places,<br/>I finally found a discrepancy of one digit at the end of<br/>only one of the numbers, which I think was probably due<br/>to rounding in my spreadsheet anyway.</p><p>So it turns out that Woolhouse actually *did* describe<br/>Paul&apos;s 7/26-comma meantone, but not in that way.  Woolhouse<br/>described it in terms of a &apos;5L,2s&apos; mapping, whereas Paul<br/>describes it based on a cycle of tempered 2:3s.  Hmmm...</p><p>Perhaps someone will bother to go thru the drudgery to<br/>show us exactly why it works out both ways; I&apos;m certainly<br/>interested, especially in how 12/26 and 9/26 averages out<br/>to 7/26!</p><p>&gt; [back to Paul]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and decided that 19-tone equal tempermant was a close<br/>&gt; enough approximation,</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>&gt; and one which gave to the musician the desirable properties<br/>&gt; of a closed system which were giving 12-equal its rise to<br/>&gt; prominence at the time.</p><p>Again, 100% true.</p><p>&gt; In fact, 31- or 50-tone equal temperaments would be better<br/>&gt; approximations (though not as convenient from a practical point<br/>&gt; of view)</p><p>Both points made by Woolhouse.</p><p>&gt; [Paul, TD 441.16]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the &quot;optimal&quot; meantone he derived (from 16th-18th century<br/>&gt; musical considerations)</p><p>As far as I recall, Woolhouse doesn&apos;t specifically mention<br/>anything about repertoire.</p><p>&gt; was essentially 50-tone equal temperament, and the only<br/>&gt; possible reason for suggesting 19 instead of 50 would be<br/>&gt; a practical one of actually getting all those notes onto<br/>&gt; instruments.</p><p>This is all absolutely true, except that I would say his<br/>optimal tuning was the 6/13- &amp; 9/26-comma meantone, and<br/>even advocating 50-tET was a bit of backsliding; due to<br/>what, I don&apos;t know: he could have given beat-counting charts<br/>for the meantone as well as the ETs.  Perhaps this give<br/>a bit of weight to Dave Hill&apos;s hypothesis that Woolhouse<br/>was more willing to accept the tuning status-quo than he<br/>books makes him seem.</p><p>A very intriguing little treatise.  I&apos;ll be making a webpage<br/>out of this in the next few days, and can probably make the<br/>whole book into a set of webpages without too much work.<br/>I&apos;m pretty sure there&apos;s no copyright restriction on it by now.<br/>Stay &apos;tuned&apos; for updates.</p><p>Another tidbit:  in his Introduction to Bosanquet 1987<br/>[p 40 and 45], Rasch shows that earlier versions of Bosanquet&apos;s<br/>book included summaries of Woolhouse&apos;s, which were deleted<br/>from the published edition, thus proving that Bosanquet was<br/>quite familiar with Woolhouse 1835.</p><p>And here&apos;s a challenge to Paul or any others of the<br/>mathematically-inclined out there: since we&apos;ve all heard<br/>so much about how well 53-tET approximates both 3- and<br/>5-limit JI and relatively little about 50-tET, how about<br/>showing us exactly why 50-tET is better.  Or if it&apos;s not<br/>better, then tell us what descriptions best characterize<br/>the comparison of these two temperaments.</p><p>REFERENCES<br/>----------</p><p>Smith, Robert.  1749.<br/>   _Harmonics, or the Philosophy of Musical Sounds_.<br/>   Cambridge.<br/>   [2nd edition: 1759, London.]</p><p>Herschel, J.
