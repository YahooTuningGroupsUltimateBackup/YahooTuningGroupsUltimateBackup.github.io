If no, does anybody have a midi sequence (or other<br/>&gt; &gt; music example) illustrating how to solve this problem?</p><p>   Sorry if I missed some context, but what problem?  This question seems<br/>to be based upon the premise that subminors lack richness, tunability,<br/>and desirability.  If in &quot;subminors&quot; you include 7:6 and 7:4 for example,<br/>then I personally see no evidence of that.</p></div>
