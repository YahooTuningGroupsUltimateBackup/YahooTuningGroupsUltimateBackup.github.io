I&apos;ve seen a lot of M-out-of-N ME scales<br/>where the number of tetrads is almost N -- but here it&apos;s _greater_<br/>than N!</p><p>There are thirty-six consonant (5-limit) triads which are simply the<br/>36 tetrads with their 7 identities removed.</p><p>There are twenty-five consonant (3-limit) dyads.</p><p>There are twenty-four consonant (9-limit) pentads: twelve major and<br/>twelve minor.</p><p>There are eighteen consonant (11-limit) hexads: nine major and nine<br/>minor.</p><p>How does the scale achieve this magic?</p><p>Answer: the scale is an MOS built from a generator which is 7/72<br/>octave.</p><p>Stacking six of these upward gives you the 3/2. So you need a chain<br/>of 6 to yield a 3-limit dyad. 31 - 6 = 25 -- that&apos;s why there are 25<br/>dyads.</p><p>Stacking seven of these _downward_ gives you the 4/5. So you need a<br/>chain of 7+6=13 to yield a 5-limit triad. 31-13=18 -- that&apos;s why<br/>there are 18 major triads and 18 minor triads.</p><p>Stacking only two of these downward gives you the 7/8. That&apos;s why all<br/>the triads can be completed into 7-limit tetrads.</p><p>Stacking twelve of these upward gives you the 9/4. 12+7=19, and 31-<br/>19=12 -- that&apos;s why there are 12 major pentads and 12 minor pentads.</p><p>Stacking fifteen of these upward gives you the 11/4. 15+7=22, and 31-<br/>22=9 -- that why there are 9 major hexads and 9 minor hexads.</p><p>It looks like the generator itself would make for a really<br/>interesting non-octave ET, with nearly pure 5:7:8:12:18:22 hexads.<br/>And Dave, didn&apos;t you once propose an MOS scale using a generator of<br/>around this size, was it 115 cents, with around 10 notes?</p></div><h3><a id=21901 href="#21901">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/30/2001 1:05:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This scale also has five 7-limit Tonality Diamonds.

And other musical applications will suggest themselves as<br/>the ideas crystallize and are understood in greater and greater<br/>generality.</p><p>If you read Erv Wilson&apos;s work, particularly &quot;D&apos;Allessandro -- like a<br/>hurricane&quot;, you&apos;ll begin to appreciate how profound this &quot;popping&quot;<br/>process can be, and how it can provide inspiration for a lifetime of<br/>scale-creation. One instance of this is captured in the Wilson quote<br/>in Joe Monzo&apos;s .sig -- &quot;I had broken through the lattice barrier&quot;.<br/>This is a perfect example of such a conceptual &quot;pop&quot;.</p><p>Kraig Grady has let us in on only the tip of the iceberg when it<br/>comes to Erv Wilson&apos;s work, and it should provide materials for<br/>generations of composers to come.</p><p>You may be aware that Harry Partch wrote the theoretical work in<br/>_Genesis of a Music_ early in his life, and then went on to drop<br/>theorizing for composing.</p><p>So you may wonder why someone would seemingly spend their life<br/>developing a body of theoretical work 30 times as large as the Partch<br/>tome. In this case, that &quot;somebody&quot; would be Dave Keenan and me.</p><p>Well, me, I&apos;m 28. So hopefully, I will have plenty of time to<br/>compose. Even though I have a very good ear, I&apos;m only slowly<br/>learning, little by little, to capture the music from my moments of<br/>greatest inspiration, usually occuring between sleeping and waking<br/>states.</p><p>Dave Keenan, on the other hand, is more of a mathematician than a<br/>musician. Much more. By choosing to put his formidable mind to the<br/>subject of tuning and microtonality, he is benefitting all composers<br/>who choose to leave the 12-tET cage. He&apos;s probably not going to<br/>produce any musical masterpieces anytime soon.</p><p>Similarly, a very fine composer somewhere, say in New York City,<br/>might be fascinated with the sounds of various microtonal structures<br/>but may be a struggling with ways to utilize them that allow his<br/>familiar process of writing at the keyboard to be maintained, and his<br/>goal of getting just-sounding performances from instrumentalists to<br/>be realized. So he asks the mathematician for help.</p><p>What could be more natural than for people with different strengths<br/>and talents to get together and collaborate on solving various<br/>problems?</p><p>This is how society was built!</p><p>What would happen if all of a sudden all the mathematicians had to<br/>become composers and all the composers had to become mathematicians.<br/>I don&apos;t think that would lead to a happy time for the music listener!</p><p>Jon, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re going to take a look at my paper, and perhaps<br/>you&apos;ll have your own &quot;breakthrough&quot; and come back with a genuine<br/>interest in the theoretical matters we&apos;re talking about.</p><p>But if not, that delete button will still be there for you. You&apos;ll<br/>never have to look at another lattice diagram again, if you don&apos;t<br/>want to. No harm done, no hard feelings.</p></div><h3><a id=21909 href="#21909">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/30/2001 3:03:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_21894.html#21894">/tuning/topicId_21894.html#21894</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve started examining Dave Keenan&apos;s 31-out-of-72 ME scale which<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to be the &quot;source set&quot; for most of our proposals for Joseph<br/>&gt; &gt; Pehrson.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It has some truly mind-blowing properties.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, this is really important, so I&apos;d better be sure I have the<br/>&gt; right scale, ahem  (!!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the one that&apos;s outlined in:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_21636.html#21871">/tuning/topicId_21636.html#21871</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct??</p><p>Nope -- there&apos;s no 31-tone scale mentioned in that message.</p><p>The scale in question is the following degrees of 72-tET:</p><p>0<br/>2<br/>5<br/>7<br/>9<br/>12<br/>14<br/>16<br/>19<br/>21<br/>23<br/>26<br/>28<br/>30<br/>33<br/>35<br/>37<br/>39<br/>42<br/>44<br/>46<br/>49<br/>51<br/>53<br/>56<br/>58<br/>60<br/>63<br/>65<br/>67<br/>70<br/>(72)</p></div><h3><a id=21911 href="#21911">ðŸ”—</a>Kees van Prooijen &#x3C;kees@dnai.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2001 3:09:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was about to mention that.

It reflects my feelings<br/>about our theoretical research *exactly*.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; You see, there are some very deep multidimensional patterns<br/>&gt; underlying all of this, but no one is going to grasp these<br/>&gt; all at once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By going through many particular cases, one begins to develop<br/>&gt; a feel for the patterns and then . . . pop! . . . you&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; walking own the street and you&apos;ll &quot;get it&quot; . . . something<br/>&gt; will click and you&apos;ll suddenly understand a new overarching<br/>&gt; principle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you read Erv Wilson&apos;s work, particularly &quot;D&apos;Allessandro --<br/>&gt; like a hurricane&quot;, you&apos;ll begin to appreciate how profound<br/>&gt; this &quot;popping&quot; process can be, and how it can provide<br/>&gt; inspiration for a lifetime of scale-creation. One instance<br/>&gt; of this is captured in the Wilson quote in Joe Monzo&apos;s .sig<br/>&gt; -- &quot;I had broken through the lattice barrier&quot;.<br/>&gt; This is a perfect example of such a conceptual &quot;pop&quot;.</p><p>Well, I was planning to reply to this post anyway, but now<br/>since you mentioned me, I feel compelled.</p><p>I believe (but I&apos;m not entirely sure) that Wilson and I are<br/>both referring to precisely the same &quot;lattice barrier&quot;: how<br/>does one represent structures with more than 3 dimensions<br/>on a 2-dimensional piece of paper or computer screen?<br/>Anyway, that was my &quot;barrier&quot;.</p><p>I struggled for at least a couple of years with this problem.</p><p>Those of you who have a copy of my book can see the earlier<br/>&quot;matrix diagrams&quot; I created (the forerunners of my &quot;lattice<br/>diagrams&quot; - eventually they will be purged from the book, so<br/>keep those old copies as collector&apos;s items!), where prime-factors<br/>3 and 5 could be conveniently arranged in a 2-dimensional space,<br/>as here:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a></p><p>But to include prime-factors above 5, I had to stack the<br/>3x5 planes like steps on a ladder.  I was never entirely<br/>happy about this design.</p><p>Then suddenly one day I realized that by using a variety of<br/>different angles, each prime-factor could have its own<br/>unique dimension.</p><p>John Chalmers and Erv Wilson had already done this, but<br/>I wasn&apos;t aware of their work at the time.  The first two<br/>diagrams here give an illustration:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/chalmers/diagrams.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/chalmers/diagrams.htm</a></p><p>Chalmers and Wilson used more-or-less arbitrary angles<br/>- altho Wilson&apos;s often are determined by his desire to<br/>harness the structural possibilities of polyhedra; see:<br/><a href="http://www.georgehart.com/pavilion.html">http://www.georgehart.com/pavilion.html</a><br/>for a bunch of links dealing with polyhedra.</p><p>After playing around with this for a few days, I realized<br/>that I could impose a formula where each prime had a logical<br/>angle for its axis, thus revealing the sort of &quot;general<br/>principles&quot; mentioned here by Paul.  See:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm</a></p><p>The concepual &quot;pop&quot; Paul refers to was indeed a flash of<br/>insight that struck me with a force I&apos;ve felt only a few<br/>times in my life.  Chasing after this insight is the primary<br/>reason why I myself am so interested in this theoretical<br/>stuff.</p><p>Yes, it means that I &quot;waste&quot; a lot of my time on theory,<br/>instead of making use of the talents and abilities as a<br/>composer that other people have told me I have.  But one<br/>does with his life what one wants to, if he has that<br/>opportunity.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;d like to compose more music.  But I suppose, to<br/>paraphrase Partch, I&apos;m &quot;a composer seduced into theory&quot;.<br/>And at this point, I don&apos;t think I can turn back.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21989 href="#21989">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/2/2001 10:47:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m starting to try and take a look at this a bit but I had a few<br/>&gt; questions to try and make sure that I&apos;m clearly understanding<br/>&gt; everything...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;How does the scale achieve this magic?

See:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm</a></p><p>I guess this is very similar to what I discussed in my brief thread with<br/>Paul two weeks ago about multidimensional scaling solutions.  I hope to<br/>post more about the use and theory of multidimensional scaling soon for<br/>those not familiar with it.  Since my search through my local public<br/>library and community college library catalogs revealed no hits on<br/>various subject keywords related to it, I imagine not very many people<br/>here are familiar with the subject (although most of the subjects on this<br/>list also come up with very few hits in library databases or on the web).</p><p>One of the key uses of multidimensional scaling is to reveal subtle<br/>relationships of data points in large sets.  The previously mentioned<br/>studies by Krumhansel and Kessler, 1982 (really, I will give more info on<br/>this later, I promise), and by Paul Erlich conclude that relationships<br/>amongst key signatures (interval classes in Paul&apos;s analysis) in 12tET can<br/>be summarized in four dimensions.  Krumhansel&apos;s interpretation was that<br/>one two-dimensional projection of the four-dimensional solution reveals<br/>the circle of fifths relationships amongst key signatures, and another<br/>two-dimensional projection reveal parallel major-key/minor-key<br/>relationships.  Looking at the second graph in her book &quot;Cognitive<br/>Foundations of Musical Pitch,&quot; pg 43, I see that major keys are grouped<br/>closely by major thirds (Db F A, D F# Bb, etc.), with adjacent trios of<br/>minor keys (db f a, d f# bb, etc.) in four sets progressing by semitones,<br/>in a circle, for a total of 24 key signatures.  It seems to me that the<br/>first graph presents 3-limit relationships, and the second group presents<br/>5-limit relationships.</p><p>A key feature of multidimensional scaling is the &quot;stress value.&quot;  The<br/>computer program takes as input a matrix containing similarity values for<br/>all pairs of data points under consideration (in Krumhansel&apos;s study, the<br/>correlation coefficients of pairs of key signatures, a 24 x 24 matrix).<br/>The program calculates distances amongst the points using the Pythagorean<br/>Theorem, and determines a number of dimensions that does the least<br/>violence to the data.  The greater the number of dimensions, the lower<br/>the stress value, and vice versa.  It is my hypothesis that the best<br/>representation of sets of intervals will have a dimensionality<br/>corresponding to the limit value of the system.  In other words, an<br/>11-limit system would need to be represented in 11 dimensions for a low<br/>stress value.  However, I am new at this line of inquiry, so please don&apos;t<br/>consider me an authority on the subject.</p><p>The &quot;popping&quot; sensation you are describing seems to relate to the problem<br/>of visualizing data patterns in more than three dimensions.  Fortunately,<br/>this is a problem encountered by vast numbers of scientists,<br/>philosophers, and mystics; consequently, there seems to be quite a few<br/>more books on this subject.  I just checked one out from the library<br/>entitled &quot;Beyond the Third Dimension:  Geometry, Computer Graphics, and<br/>Higher Dimensions&quot; by Thomas F Banchoff, copyright 1990 by Scientific<br/>American Library.  It is helping me quite a bit.</p><p>By the way, Monz, I have started to dig into your on-line dictionary, and<br/>I&apos;m finding it very helpful.

For a JI scale,<br/>you need one dimension for a 3-limit system, two dimensions for a 5-<br/>limit system, three for 7-limit, four for 11-limit, etc. For a<br/>tempered scale, you need as many additional dimensions as there are<br/>unison vectors. For example, Krumhansl&apos;s 4-dimensional torus comes<br/>from the two-dimensional 5-limit JI lattice being curved around to<br/>meet itself at both the syntonic comma and the diesis. A 5-limit<br/>meantone system would be only 3-dimensional because only the syntonic<br/>comma is used to &quot;wrap&quot; the 2-d 5-limit plane into a cylinder.</p></div><h3><a id=22055 href="#22055">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/3/2001 1:45:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21894.html#22049">/tuning/topicId_21894.html#22049</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., BVAL@I... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hope to write more about this program to this<br/>&gt; &gt; forum after my weekend, but thought I&apos;d at least chime<br/>&gt; &gt; in with this &apos;me too!&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks.

Otherwise, a scale that seems good for dyads<br/>might fall apart when trying to construct chords.</p></div><h3><a id=45411 href="#45411">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2003 10:10:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, paul@s... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21894.html#21938">/tuning/topicId_21894.html#21938</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, this is a curiosity...
