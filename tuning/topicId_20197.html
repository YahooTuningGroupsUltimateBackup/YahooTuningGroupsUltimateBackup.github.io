You MACkies have all the fun!</p><p>You silly rabbits!</p><p>Hm, hey you guys, it&apos;s us Mac people that are missing out!</p><p>See here: now, it was Miller Puckette (as in Miller<br/>*S*. Puckette, or MSP) who invented MAX (tribute to Max<br/>Mathews) at IRCAM to be a graphical front end for IRCAM&apos;s<br/>ultra fancy ISPW DSP board. Then, a commercial version of<br/>MAX that was limited to MIDI processing functions was<br/>brought forth by David Zicarelli for Opcode.</p><p>Since then, Miller has created a completely new<br/>application for manipulating data in real time called PD<br/>(Pure Data). Completely written from scratch in a clean<br/>room, but conveniently 100% backwards compatible with MAX,<br/>and yet it does SO MUCH MORE. Miller is without equal. He<br/>is the world&apos;s *greatest* meta musical instrument<br/>designer, a fine composer, a mathematical genius, and an<br/>all-around wonderful and fun and easygoing family man. His<br/>software engineering is on par with Kerighan and Ritchie.<br/>Any one who has met him is fortunate indeed. Miller is<br/>someone that we would all be incredibly jealous of if he<br/>wasn&apos;t so darn modest!</p><p>Miller&apos;s greatest work of art, PD, is simply the most<br/>fantastic real-time digital audio tool kit in existence.<br/>And that&apos;s just a massive oversimplification of what it<br/>is. Heck, you could patch it up to monitor and analyze<br/>stock quotes coming in off the internet if you like, then<br/>generate 3D graphics and algorithmic compositions that<br/>reflect up-to-the-millisecond real-time pork belly<br/>futures. And you could do it all without having to<br/>learn any complicated weird stuff.</p><p>The realtime audio processing kernel scales to run on<br/>multiple processors. (So if you are a millionaire or Intel<br/>executive and your computer has an array of 16 1Ghz<br/>Pentium 4s then you have a 16Ghz real time audio rendering<br/>engine that you can easily program using a graphical,<br/>object-oriented, streaming data processing language to do<br/>_anything_.) There is also a fantastic plugin for it that<br/>enables you to run realtime 3D graphics off of the crazy<br/>thing (GEM). Development is subsidized by a grant from<br/>Intel because it runs on Windows NT as well as Linux and<br/>really makes Intel look _goooood_ (say this with a low,<br/>gutteral voice).</p><p>What is this MSP you are all so crazy about? Well it is a<br/>port done by Zicarelli&apos;s company, Cycling74, of PD&apos;s core<br/>to the PPC to work with the Opcode version of MAX.</p><p>How can Cycling74 do that? Easy, PD comes with all the<br/>source code, is free, and the license says you can do<br/>anything you want with it at all, even include it in a<br/>commercial application.</p><p>See where I&apos;m heading? MSP/MAX is just a shadow of PD. PD<br/>is where it&apos;s really at. And if you&apos;ve got Linux or NT<br/>(and it works somewhat under 95/98, but you know how 95/98<br/>is as goes stability), it&apos;s --100% FREE--. But I must<br/>caution the dilentantes on this list. If you get it you<br/>will no longer have any excuses not to write music because<br/>you don&apos;t have the right tools.</p><p>Now when you do come up with your own PD plug ins,<br/>effects, processors, patches, etc. that are oh-so-amazing,<br/>keep things balanced and put some of them in the public<br/>domain. Share the joy! Share and enjoy!</p><p>Why are you waiting? The only reason I want someone --<br/>anyone -- to send me their unused PC is so I can<br/>turn it into a PD box.</p><p>It&apos;s the sort of thing that&apos;s so dang good, I want to keep<br/>it all to myself, but oh well! Now stop fooling around and<br/>go get it!
