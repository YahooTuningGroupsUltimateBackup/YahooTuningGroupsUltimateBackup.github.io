I have hesitated to go MIDI<br/>with it because I was worried that option *B* would glitch the attacks of<br/>notes, and that option *A* would be expensive. Please tell of your experience<br/>with MIDI on your guitar controller.</p><p>I have used both Beetle Quantar and  Starr Labs controllers.<br/>Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but both are pure<br/>MIDI controllers - that is, they make no sound, but send<br/>only MIDI note data. The retuning into various temperaments<br/>is done in the synth module via tuning table.<br/>Im afraid this doesnt directly address your problem though.</p><p>My experience with pitch bend methods is ok, but it is awkward<br/>when setting up the synth-all channels in mono mode, and changing<br/>a patch requires changing the ssound on all channels at once.<br/>The trick with making pitch bends not be obnoxious is to send the<br/>pitch bend command just before the note on - that way you avoid the<br/>slide from the 12-tet sound to the retuned sound.<br/>I use MAX to do that - which is unfortunate only because it means<br/>I need to have a computer around.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
