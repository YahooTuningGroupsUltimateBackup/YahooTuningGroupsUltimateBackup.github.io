The theoretical tradition says precious little<br/>about how these materials are projected into real harmonic contexts.  Indeed,<br/>it is extremely difficult to do so: one might say that we think about tonal<br/>music in terms of JI although it is not, much as we orient ourselves locally<br/>on the earth as if the planet were flat (which I am told it is not).</p><p>An extremely interesting reading of the history of music theory from Rameau<br/>through Riemann through Schenker and Schoenberg can be found in the emergence<br/>of competing (but not necessarily contradictory) theories of the relationship<br/>between pitch (i.e. tuning) structure and large scale musical form.</p><p>Although Schenker&apos;s ideas about underlying tonal structures (Klang, Ursatz,<br/>Urlinie etc.) and the way musical surfaces emerge from these structures and<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s &quot;structural functions&quot; are 20th century theories, the repertoire<br/>they apply to most directly is that of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and<br/>a reading (one might even say a _deconstructive_ reading) of both theorists<br/>as covert exponents of meantone temperament would be most instructive.</p></div>
