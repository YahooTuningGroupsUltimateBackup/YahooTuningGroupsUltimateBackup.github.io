I&apos;m still groping for the perfect answer,<br/>&gt; ideally one which satisfies all of the following:</p><p>This may raise a basic philosophical issue: is a &quot;universal&quot; method for<br/>styles of music which may have radically different expectations really so<br/>universal? I&apos;m tempted to remark that assuming an equivalence between G#<br/>and Ab, for example, seems a very &quot;limiting&quot; assumption -- although I<br/>recognize that certain specific styles indeed make such an assumption the<br/>basis for some artful structures and effects.</p><p>&gt;    . One approach applies to pieces old and new, constrained and bold.</p><p>As an interesting problem of the same kind as &quot;tune a 12-note keyboard so<br/>that it can be used at least tolerably to play European compositions from<br/>both the medieval and Renaissance eras,&quot; this search for a single tuning<br/>algorithm is the kind of question that can engage our mathematical skills<br/>and reveal something about our musical tastes and priorities.</p><p>However, speaking for myself, I would far prefer to use algorithms adapted<br/>to the assumptions and artistic potentials of a specific style. Thus<br/>1/4-comma meantone or something close to it seems a logical basis to me<br/>for some kind of adaptive just intonation applied to Gesualdo, for<br/>example; for music based on the radically different assumptions of 12-tet<br/>or something not too far from it, that temperament might serve as the best<br/>basis.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=10112 href="#10112">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@idcomm.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2000 11:14:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter, TD 643.13, makes a good point, and upon further<br/>reflection my desire for a tuning method universal across the centuries<br/>seems misguided.</p><p>My own tastes tend toward the 19th century and beyond, where mapping<br/>12-tET onto no more than 12 retuned notes seems to make a lot more<br/>sense.</p><p>But, for the 18th century and earlier, it does seem overly harsh to<br/>squeeze everything into 12 notes.</p><p>I am now thinking of trying to map any piece of music onto 31-tET, with<br/>the goal of deciding whether or not it makes sense; if it does, then<br/>the world of more than 12 notes is open; if it does not, then a 12 note<br/>universe (howbeit with the possibility of adaptive tuning) seems to be<br/>more fitting.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
