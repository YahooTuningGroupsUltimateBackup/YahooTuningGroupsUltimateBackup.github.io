The score was not<br/>&gt; simply representing the sounding result.ach</p><p>If you could be specific about what the organ in a different tuning means<br/>regarding its pitch basis, it would be appreciated.  Personally, I have set<br/>up a Bach Cantata session at the library with my harpsichordist.  Together we<br/>will choose a program for next year, and also, take note of continuo pitch<br/>elements.</p><p>&gt; To the playing techniques of flutes, oboes, bassoons: In<br/>&gt; historic  woodwinds  the application depends heavily on<br/>&gt; &quot;Gabelgriffe&quot; to produce different tones like F# or Gb (for<br/>&gt; example described in historical oboe methods) and the change of<br/>&gt; timbre.</p><p>I believe you are describing &quot;Forked Fingerings.&quot;  As it happens, I am am<br/>knowledgeable in a multiplicity of bassoon &quot;grippings&quot; or fingerings.  There<br/>was never any doubt that in some music, there is a distinction between an F#<br/>and a Gb.  Sometimes the F# is higher and sometime lower.  Sometimes they are<br/>the same.  It all depends on the particular practice of composers living in<br/>certain geographical areas.</p><p>What is important in this discussion is that Bach did not make this<br/>difference and retained enharmonic identities.  As you have suggested, modern<br/>instruments will make any pitch distinctions that older music has made.</p><p>&gt; application if they were to produce the same pitch (not even<br/>&gt; speaking of the claim of 1 cent exactness)?<br/>&gt; These techniques are not usable on the modern woodwinds.</p><p>I would have to respond that these same techniques are usable on modern<br/>woodwinds in all important ways.  (Only the bass clarinet has blocked out<br/>open tone holes, and some closed hole flutes, which are not recommended for<br/>microtonal use).</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;JR: Double reeds are my specialty. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Otherwise I conclude the discussion, as I am doing research on<br/>&gt; the historical evidence - evidence which you have denied,<br/>&gt; rejected etc.</p><p>What I reject is an exclusive interpretation.  I am interested more in what<br/>happened and how that might affect what can happen, and less interested in<br/>how moderns describe it to me.  Music historians and musicologists have<br/>failed to pull apart the veils of the period of Bach and as a musician, I<br/>find it necessary to research further and independently.  It is unlikely,<br/>Ibo, you will every find anyone as passionate as I am to uncover what is the<br/>true situation for Bach.  Knowledge of the organ is just one more challenge<br/>on the road.  Thanks you for your barbed wire attention to my interests.</p><p>&gt; And I don&apos;t want to discuss personal, historically not-founded<br/>&gt; convictions, however artistic and respectable they are as modern<br/>&gt; experiences, like yours.</p><p>Not-founded until founded is always the way of the world.</p><p>Good luck in your research.  I guess you don&apos;t even want the recording(s) I<br/>suggested or you would have e-mailed an address.  Maybe you consider them a<br/>distraction.  Regardles, thanks for sharing and for the leads.</p><p>&gt; Good success with your work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kind regards<br/>&gt; Ibo</p><p>Good luck uncovering new facts.  May they continue to be brought to the<br/>public so that then can be enacted upon.  It may be to others, though, to<br/>connect the dots.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
