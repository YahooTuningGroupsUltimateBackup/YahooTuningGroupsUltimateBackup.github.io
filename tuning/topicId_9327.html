The device number should not be<br/>&quot;off&quot;, then change it to &quot;all&quot;.<br/>The TG77 should be compatible with the SY77.

I am trying<br/>to send a sysex bulk tuning dump to the synth to tune the entire table at<br/>once, but it is not working.  I was able to find the voice edit/microtune<br/>edit screens you describe, but my tuning system is complex and I do not want<br/>to edit each note number individually!</p><p>here is my second message to manuel:<br/>Still having trouble.</p><p>Yes, it (sysex receive channel) was already set to&quot; all&quot;, and memory<br/>protection  is definitely off,<br/>and I am definitely setting it up to edit one of the user definable tuning<br/>tables..  I am using send/file and cakewalk to play the tuning midi file.<br/>Documentation on the synth says that it can receive sysex at any time.<br/>Should I use a sysex file type instead?  How do I do that?  I tried using<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/send">@send</a>, and gsplay seems to function, but then cakewalk seems to no longer be<br/>able to send mididata.  Another sequencer I have still works in this<br/>condition though.</p><p>When I play the midi tuning file in cake walk, the synth seems to recieve<br/>data (the voice button flashes), but the microtuning data edit screen does<br/>not scroll through as it would with the tx81z.</p><p>What now?!?!? Send a sysex data file?  Edit synth par?</p><p>Darren</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;david first&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d1st@earthlink.net">d1st@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, March 23, 2000 7:58 AM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] tg77 retuning</p><p>&gt; From: david first &lt;<a href="mailto:d1st@earthlink.net">d1st@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Darren Burgess wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Darren Burgess&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET">DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Manuel and Tuning list,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does any one know how to retune the Yamaha TG77?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s been a few years, but I believe you find the micro-tuning function<br/>in Voice Edit Mode.
