But if a<br/>scale is &quot;inconsistent&quot; at a certain limit, then it is<br/>not possible (in fixed intonation) to take advantage of<br/>the implied &quot;nearest&quot; scale degree when forming consonant<br/>chords (or particular melodic figures) - that is, within<br/>the specified m-limit.  For example, &quot;goodness-of-fit&quot;<br/>shows that 24-ET has a better approximation of the harmonic<br/>seventh than 12-ET.  However, suppose that we want to form<br/>a root position &quot;just intonation dominant seventh&quot; chord,<br/>approximating 7-Limit just intonation, in 24-ET.   The<br/>just chord is described by the ratios &quot;4:5:6:7&quot; - that is,<br/>the notes 1/1, 5/4, 6/5 and 7/4.  There are thus six ratios<br/>implicit in this chord: 5/4, 6/4 (3/2), 7/4, 6/5, 7/5 and 7/6.<br/>In 24-ET the closest approximation to 5/4 (major third,<br/>386 cents) is 400 cents (8 quarter-tones), and the closest<br/>approximation to 7/5 (septimal augmented fourth, 583 cents)<br/>is 600 cents (12 quarter-tones).  If the two just intervals<br/>are added the result is equal to 7/4 (harmonic seventh,<br/>969 cents).  But the closest approximation to 7/4 in 24-ET<br/>is 950 cents (19 quarter-tones), and 8 + 12 &sup1; 19.  And<br/>although the same chord (C E G Bb) can be formed by exactly<br/>the same intervals in 24-ET as in 12-ET, there is no single<br/>optimal approximation of the just dominant seventh chord in<br/>24-ET, since, whichever way the chord is tuned,  7/4 and 7/5<br/>cannot both be &quot;optimally approximated&quot; at the same time<br/>within the temperament.  Therefore, 24-ET is &quot;inconsistent&quot;<br/>at the (primary) 7-Limit.</p><p>In 12-ET the nearest realisation of this chord is of course<br/>C E G Bb (when 1/1 is C).  And it can be shown that all of<br/>the six ratios implicit in this chord are given the best<br/>possible approximation in 12-ET by C E G Bb (or 4, 3 and 3<br/>semitones).  So although the chord can in fact be tuned better<br/>in 24-ET than in 12-ET, 12-ET has the virtue of being<br/>consistent, whereas 24-ET does not.  In fact, it can be<br/>shown that chord formation in 12-ET is actually consistent<br/>to the primary 9-Limit, whereas 24-ET is consistent only<br/>to the 5-limit.</p><p>- end quote -</p><p>Ozzard-Low&apos;s &quot;Appendix IV&quot; contains the most detailed<br/>explanation of &quot;consistency&quot; that i&apos;ve seen anywhere.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;tdent@auth.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2005 5:34:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi Tom,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (...) i&apos;d prefer to assume the opposite of your last<br/>&gt; sentence: Mozart specifically uses F# all over the<br/>&gt; beginning of his G-minor Symphony (as one would expect),<br/>&gt; but there&apos;s a point later in the movement where he<br/>&gt; writes Gb, and since his own teaching specified that<br/>&gt; these are two different pitches, i think we should<br/>&gt; assume that his music *does* &quot;specifically ... exploit<br/>&gt; fine details of tuning&quot;.</p><p>The Gb is only heard for tiny fractions of a second in passing -<br/>but I would certainly agree now that you have pointed out the<br/>specific issue of enharmonics.

In C, that&apos;s C Am Dm G7 C.<br/>In passing from the C chord to the Am chord, there<br/>is NO need for the E to move, hence no tendency<br/>for it to sharpen.  Should the player now play a<br/>_different_ E than he played in passing from I to IV?<br/>(We&apos;re not talking adaptive tunings here.)

(Not sure about the bit marked *...*; the alternative<br/>&gt; seems to be to hold to the same D, and move _both_ the F<br/>&gt; and the A.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are the things that I still don&apos;t get:<br/>&gt; Where is the fraction of a comma?  How do we circulate<br/>&gt; the shift?  What is the strategy?  And how, if the melodies<br/>&gt; still shift - albeit by smaller amounts than a comma - can we<br/>&gt; prevent a drift in intonation?</p><p>you&apos;re thinking too much in true JI, that&apos;s why you<br/>don&apos;t get it.</p><p>let&apos;s use Vicentino&apos;s adaptive-JI tuning for your example.<br/>here&apos;s your chord progression again, with cents values<br/>for the notes taken from Vicentino, but shifted so that<br/>C is 0 (zero) cents, since it&apos;s obvious that we&apos;re in<br/>the key of C here:</p><p>G 0702 - G 0697 - F 0509 - F 0503 - E 0386<br/>E 0386 - D 0199 - D 0193 - C 0005 - C 0000<br/>C 0000 - B 1083 - A 0895 - A 0890 - G 0702</p><p>I ------ V ------ ii ----- IV ----- I</p><p>first, look at the cents values vertically:<br/>every triad here is a perfectly in-tune JI<br/>major or minor triad.</p><p>now, look at the cents values horizontally:</p><p>on the top line:</p><p>. the first G (~702 cents) is a 3:2 ratio above C (0 cents),<br/>but the second G (~697 cents) is tempered flat by 1/4-comma<br/>(~5 cents);</p><p>. the following F (~509 cents) is tempered sharp by 1/2-comma,<br/>but it is a perfect 3:2 above the root of the chord, which is<br/>a D (~503 cents) tuned 1/4-comma sharp; the next F (~503 cents)<br/>is the root of that chord.</p><p>the maximum melodic shift on this line is ~5 cents.</p><p>similarly for the other lines.</p><p>now let&apos;s look at the cents values for the roots of the chords:</p><p>C 0000 - G 0697 - D 0193 - F 0503 - C 0000</p><p>I ------ V ------ ii ----- IV ----- I</p><p>again, the maximum deviation from true JI is 1/4-comma, ~5 cents.</p><p>do you see how it works now? the theory is that most ears<br/>will accept this because all of the chords sound like real JI<br/>-- BECAUSE THEY ARE! -- but the melodic shifting necessary<br/>to acheive this is nowhere great enough to really be noticeable.</p><p>&gt; Let me ask this: is there just ONE adaptive-<br/>&gt; JI rendition of any triadic progression, or are there<br/>&gt; choice points, where one could equally correctly choose<br/>&gt; a different realization of the next chord?</p><p>there are an infinite number of adaptive-JI possibilities.<br/>the basic concept is that you create a linear temperament<br/>chain, then create another one at a distance of the amount<br/>of tempering. by doing that, your tuning has the JI ratios<br/>embedded in it, and you just choose the notes from either<br/>chain which you need to get JI chords.</p><p>&gt; (The links to cawapu, bike-chain and even comma-pump<br/>&gt; on those pages seem to be broken every time I try them.)</p><p>sorry about that.  i can&apos;t fix broken links now, because<br/>the Encyclopedia is in a state of transition while i work<br/>on converting all of the pages to the new format. if you<br/>all can just bear with us, in a few weeks the whole job<br/>should be done, and the new Encyclopedia uploaded.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2005 10:29:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>&quot;monz&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; [Yayha:]<br/>&gt; &gt; (The links to cawapu,<br/>&gt; &gt; bike-chain and even<br/>&gt; &gt; comma-pump on those pages<br/>&gt; &gt; seem to be broken every<br/>&gt; &gt; time I try them.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sorry about that.  i can&apos;t<br/>&gt; fix broken links now, because<br/>&gt; the Encyclopedia is in a<br/>&gt; state of transition while i<br/>&gt; work on converting all of the<br/>&gt; pages to the new format. if<br/>&gt; you all can just bear with us,<br/>&gt; in a few weeks the whole job<br/>&gt; should be done, and the new<br/>&gt; Encyclopedia uploaded.</p><p>generally, the current problems with the Encyclopedia links<br/>result from the fact that there is no &quot;monzo&quot; directory<br/>on the Tonalsoft site right now, and so anything that links<br/>into that directory is being redirected to <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo">sonic-arts.org/monzo</a>.<br/>if you click on a link on one of *those* pages, it tries<br/>to refer to the non-existent &quot;enc&quot; directory at sonic-arts.</p><p>the pages you&apos;re looking for (cawapu, bike-chain, comma-pump)<br/>do exist, but on the <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">tonalsoft.com</a> site -- you can get to<br/>them from the Encyclopedia index. sorry about the rigamarole,<br/>it&apos;s temporary.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div>
