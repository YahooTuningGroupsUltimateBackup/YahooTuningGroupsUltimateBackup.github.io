At<br/>&gt;around 5:03, it sounds like a sharp is too sharp, perhaps replaced by<br/>&gt;the next higher note&apos;s flat -- so perhaps a COFT of more than 12 notes<br/>&gt;&gt;would be appropriate, though not necessarily more historically<br/>&gt;&gt;accurate-sounding.</p><p>Not historically accurate?  Paul, there&apos;s hope for you yet!</p><p>&gt;By the way, your website says, &quot;Project Retune: the retuning of<br/>&gt;single-voice MIDI files to adaptive Just Intonation (JI).&quot; while in<br/>&gt;fact you&apos;ve done very little in true adaptive JI and most of your work<br/>&gt;could be regarded as adaptive tuning, or perhaps adaptive quasi-JI.</p><p>You are right, and I will change my title forthwith.</p><p>&gt;And aren&apos;t these multi-voice MIDI files? They do contain harmony, after<br/>&gt;all.</p><p>They&apos;re all piano, that&apos;s what I mean by single voice.  Solo instrument.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
