If it&apos;s<br/>very positive, it&apos;s very otonal. If it&apos;s very negative, then it&apos;s very<br/>utonal.</p><p>In intuitive terms, you compare the complexity of a chord expressed in<br/>lowest terms, and the complexity of its inverse expressed in lowest terms,<br/>and see which is greater. Whichever one has lower complexity (e.g. is<br/>simpler) wins. For this model, I chose to represent complexity with Tenney<br/>height, but you theoretically could use anything that you want.</p><p>For example: 10:12:15 has a Tenney height of 1800. Its inverse, 4:5:6, has a<br/>Tenney height of 120. Since this chord&apos;s inverse has a lower Tenney height<br/>than the chord itself, it is very utonal, which in fact 10:12:15 is.</p><p>The actual definition for the otonality coefficient, using Tenney height as<br/>a complexity metric, is:</p><p>OC(a:b:c:...) = log(LCM(a,b,c,...)^N/(a*b*c*...)^2)</p><p>Where LCM is the least common multiple of a:b:c:d:e:..., and N is the number<br/>of notes in the chord. This was derived from the following, more intuitive,<br/>and non-Tenney specific definition:<br/>log(complexity(reduce(1/chord))/complexity(reduce(chord))).</p><p>Here&apos;s the OC for some chords:</p><p>Otonal chords<br/>4:5:6 = 2.7081<br/>5:6:7 = 5.3471<br/>4:5:6:7 = 10.6942</p><p>Utonal inverses of the above<br/>10:12:15 = -2.7081<br/>30:35:42 = -5.3471<br/>60:70:84:105 = -10.6942</p><p>ASS&apos;s<br/>3:5:9:15 = 0<br/>3:7:9:21 = 0<br/>3:5:7:15:21:35 = 0</p><p>Dyads<br/>2:3 = 0<br/>3:4 = 0<br/>1:2 = 0</p><p>Random number pentads with numbers between 1 and 100<br/>40:45:69:71:74 = 17.611<br/>40:43:77:83:89 = 27.386<br/>33:44:68:80:95 = 6.9878<br/>16:20:52:59:89 = 31.687<br/>9:12:14:54:68 = -2.0149<br/>6:8:25:45:90 = 11.015</p><p>Random number pentads with numbers between 1 and 2^53-1<br/>2.967e+014  4.8515e+014  4.9736e+015  7.2514e+015  8.1795e+015        14.13<br/>1.2053e+015  1.8699e+015  2.8652e+015  6.0967e+015  7.4451e+015       8.1403<br/>2.9606e+015  5.8557e+015    6.41e+015  7.8496e+015  8.7805e+015       20.383<br/>1.2962e+015  2.2922e+015  2.9197e+015   3.619e+015   5.458e+015       16.816<br/>8.5234e+014  2.1087e+015   2.911e+015  6.6686e+015  6.9319e+015       12.312<br/>2.93e+015   4.711e+015   5.017e+015  7.2985e+015  7.4926e+015      0.96508<br/>2.1147e+015  4.8513e+015  6.8024e+015  8.8312e+015  8.9325e+015        31.48</p><p>Weird Pathological Cases<br/>1:1:2 = 0.6931<br/>1:2:2 = -0.6931<br/>1:2:3:4:5:... = Infinity<br/>1/(1:2:3:4:5:...) = -Infinity</p><p>This assumes that the chord that you&apos;re putting into it is being expressed<br/>in lowest terms - e.g. if you want the otonality coefficient for 10:12:15,<br/>put in 10:12:15, not 1/6:1/5:1/4.
