Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve updated the FAQ database.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also added your entry to the two trees by hand, to show how it will<br/>work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is the work in progress one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try adding something to your file, and it will immediately change<br/>on<br/>this tree.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I just did, a little line underneith, and it immediately appeared on<br/>the HTML tree!</p><p>&gt; However, it links to your site on the tunings folder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If anyone else wants to link to your entry, they need to link to<br/>the<br/>site url instead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This one has a copy of your entry in it (which in practice would be<br/>&gt; ftpd by the program, but I just copied by hand to show how it would<br/>&gt; work).<br/>&gt; <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/site_ex/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/site_ex/tree.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now if anyone wants to link to your entry, they navigate to<br/>&gt; it in this tree, click Hide tree, and then use the url<br/>&gt; they see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That url won&apos;t change (I&apos;m talking about when it is the real site<br/>&gt; of course)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you look at it, you will see that it ends<br/>&gt; josephpehrson/19-tET_notation.htm<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, josephpehrson is your folder on the tuning_faq web site, and<br/>&gt; all your entries will go in there, wherever they are on the tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Don&apos;t worry, I find it a bit mind boggling too, but the program<br/>&gt; will have no trouble figuring it all out)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This means that if the keeper of the faq moves folders around and<br/>&gt; changes the structure of the tree, all the urls will remain<br/>&gt; as before, because the files themselves won&apos;t be moved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the interconnecting links between the various faqs will be kept<br/>&gt; okay, and won&apos;t be broken by that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, since this tree uses a copy of your text, your entry in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/site_ex/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/site_ex/tree.htm</a><br/>&gt; won&apos;t change immediately when you edit the original<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the actual working site, it will be refreshed next time the<br/>keeper of the FAQ runs the refresh program to update the &quot;on-site&quot;<br/>&gt; FAQ tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert</p><p>Thanks, Robert, for the &quot;new&quot; explanation of the FAQ tree process at:</p><p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm</a></p><p>Now the explanation is simple, so that ANYBODY can easily use it.<br/>After all, we don&apos;t really need to know ALL the details in order to<br/>use it... we can ask YOU as we go about it!  It works great!</p><p>FINALLY, I understood the bit about IMPORTING using the &quot;semicolon.&quot;<br/>Frankly, that was something I couldn&apos;t understand AT ALL in your<br/>earlier messages, so I just decided for the time being to &quot;skip it&quot; :)</p><p>Now the explanations are clear.</p><p>I see you included my silly little 19-tET notations example as a FAQ<br/>test....  It works great.  Of course, we will have more &quot;elaborate&quot;<br/>entries for such when we all get working on it.</p><p>I am particularly impressed that you can included OTHER links to this<br/>database as well as the text ones in the FILES sections... and I&apos;m<br/>impressed that you can turn the entire into a wonderful set of web<br/>pages as WELL as the &quot;sexy ascii.&quot;</p><p>You know, I REALLY like your web page tree.  I like the feel of it<br/>and<br/>the navigation.  It&apos;s SO MODERN, such a WONDERFUL way to organize<br/>information (Sorry Jon Szanto if too many CAPS!)</p><p>Your reorganization of the database seems sensible, too.  There was<br/>really no reason for the date... it just made things more complicated.</p><p>I&apos;ll go so far as to say this is the best method for organizing<br/>information I HAVE EVER SEEN...  (sorry, again Jon)</p><p>Thanks again for this terrific work!!!!!</p><p>___________ ________ _______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
