padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Paul Erlich and Gene Ward Smith and everyone.</p><p>While a recent thread I joined has been titled &quot;7-limit thinking,&quot; I want<br/>to address some more basic and general questions raised in that thread<br/>about the roles of melodic and vertical intervals and progressions in<br/>Gothic and Renaissance/Manneristic music of Europe, including for example<br/>the progressions of Tomas Luis de Victoria.</p><p>As someone whose background is mainly in European composed music of<br/>around 1200-1600, I may have a different point of view on these<br/>questions than someone oriented mainly to 18th-19th century traditions<br/>of key tonality in Europe, or someone like Haresh Bakshi trained in<br/>the raga system of India, for example.</p><p>Since short messages may invite more responses than long ones, I&apos;ll<br/>try to keep this brief, as unlikely as it seems &lt;grin&gt; -- that is, not<br/>more than 200 lines.</p><p>In dialogues of this kind, I often seem to see a kind of contrast<br/>drawn between isolated melodic lines and 18th-century key progressions<br/>of the kind often notated with Roman numerals.</p><p>Here I would like suggest that 13th-16th century European music, and<br/>also to a great extent early 17th-century music, may involve vertical<br/>approaches just as sophisticated as that of the 18th-century key<br/>system, but different.</p><p>What I can best describe is how I conceive of some of these concepts<br/>as someone who plays, improvises, and composers in these or similar<br/>styles, and also what some theorists of the Gothic-Manneristic eras<br/>say about them.</p><p>Above all, I&apos;d stress that an awareness of vertical progressions in<br/>1200, 1350, 1500, or 1600, means awareness of a complex system quite<br/>different than that of the 18th century -- as does such awareness in<br/>many musical settings of the year 2001.</p><p>For an overview of 13th-century verticality, for example, people are<br/>invited to visit my article at Todd McComb&apos;s fine Early Music FAQ site<br/>for the Medieval Music and Arts Foundation:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a></p><p>As you can read there in more detail, I view 13th-century polyphony as<br/>featuring a set of idiomatic sonorities and cadential progressions for<br/>three or voices, and theorists such as Jacobus of Liege catalogue and<br/>discuss some of those sonorities, which Jacobus terms &quot;partitions.&quot;</p><p>Since Victoria has been mentioned, I&apos;ll say a bit about 16th-century<br/>practice and theory, in my view an independent system of vertical<br/>progressions distinct from that of the 18th century, and having its<br/>own logic.</p><p>For example, in the Spanish tradition, Tomas de Santa Maria (1565) in<br/>his treatise on the art of _fantasia_ (one might say &quot;invention&quot; or<br/>improvisation on keyboard or other polyphonic instruments) presents<br/>a technique based on four-voice sonorities and progressions.</p><p>He terms these sonorities _differencias_, or &quot;differences,&quot; since the<br/>outer two voices of bass and treble define the basic intervals, while<br/>the two inner voices make &quot;differences&quot; or interior intervals<br/>providing additional concords and &quot;filling in the space&quot; between the<br/>outer voices.</p><p>This is, of course, only one kind of 16th-century technique, but Santa<br/>Maria&apos;s concepts and analysis of the four-voice sonorities or<br/>differences seem to me nicely to fit note-against-note textures in<br/>many vocal as well as instrumental compositions.</p><p>When improvising in a Renaissance or &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; style, I often<br/>find myself &quot;instinctively&quot; following some of the patterns described<br/>by Santa Maria: for example, a kind of progression in which the bass<br/>alternates motion by fourths up and steps down, or the like.</p><p>He also extensively discusses the modes, and some cadences for three<br/>and four voices, focusing for example on the ascending or descending<br/>semitone motions appropriate for the resolution of different<br/>suspension dissonances.</p><p>In his presentation of the &quot;differences&quot; of sonorities for four voices<br/>with different outer intervals between bass and treble (e.g. octave,<br/>tenth, twelfth, fifteenth), he rates them in &quot;grades&quot; by their degree<br/>of euphony, urging composers to use the best grades where the<br/>part-writing permits it.</p><p>While a treatise of this kind can hardly capture the subtle artistry<br/>and expertise of composer such as Victoria, it lets us know that<br/>16th-century musicians could insightfully analyze four-voice<br/>sonorities and progressions.</p><p>For 18th-century music, of course, one is dealing with a different<br/>kind of four-voice practice, calling for a different analysis,<br/>although the two systems share interesting similarities as well as<br/>differences.</p><p>Now we come to 18th-century inversion theory, and analogous but<br/>different 16th-century concepts. Here Zarlino&apos;s treatise of 1558 is<br/>illuminating, showing how 16th-century theory makes analytical and<br/>aesthetic distinctions of its own.</p><p>Curiously, both Zarlino&apos;s 16th-century theory of _harmonia perfetta_<br/>or &quot;complete harmony&quot; (5-limit, in the terms often used here), and the<br/>18th-century theory of inversion with some 17th-century antecedents in<br/>Johannes Lippius (1612) and others, recognize an interesting dichotomy<br/>between two categories of saturated 5-limit sonorities, or &quot;perfect<br/>harmonies,&quot; as Zarlino calls them.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot; divisions correspond with the<br/>later &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; categories, as the following table may<br/>suggest, which shows string ratios for the different arrangements<br/>discussed and compared in his treatise:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval set:    (5,M3,m3)          (M6,M3,4)          (m6,m3,4)<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>                 | G3 10            | E4 12            | C4 15<br/>Natural          |     (m3)         |     (M3)         |     (4)<br/>arrangement    5 | E3 12         M6 | C4 15         m6 | G3 20<br/>                 |     (M3)         |     (4)          |     (m3)<br/>                 | C3 15            | G3 20            | E3 24</p><p>(Frequency       (4:5:6)            (3:4:5)            (5:6:8)<br/> ratios)<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>                 | A3 4             | D4 3             | F4 5<br/>Artificial       |     (M3)         |     (4)          |     (m3)<br/>arrangement    5 | F3 5          M6 | A3 4          m6 | D4 6<br/>                 |     (m3)         |     (M3)         |     (4)<br/>                 | D3 6             | F3 5             | A3 8</p><p>(Frequency      (10:12:15)          (12:15:20)         (15:20:24)<br/> ratios)</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Note that we can use three possible types of &quot;divisions&quot; for saturated<br/>16th-century sonorities, Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia perfetta_. We may have<br/>the outer voices at a fifth, divided by a middle voice into a major<br/>third below and minor third above, or the converse; or an outer major<br/>sixth divided into fourth and major third; or an outer minor sixth<br/>divided into minor third and fourth.</p><p>Since each division has two arrangements, that makes six arrangements<br/>or types of sonorities in all.</p><p>Comparing the two arrangements for each division, Zarlino regards one<br/>sonority of each pair as &quot;natural,&quot; and the other as &quot;artificial&quot; -- a<br/>distinction which, as it happens, corresponds with the 18th-century<br/>distinction between &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; root-position triads and<br/>inversions.</p><p>However, 16th-century theory, following earlier Gothic concepts<br/>developed in a different stylistic setting but still playing an<br/>important role in guiding multi-voice progressions in the newer style,<br/>draws some important distinctions within these &quot;natural&quot; and<br/>&quot;artificial&quot; categories.</p><p>For example, Zarlino regards both of the following sonorities as<br/>&quot;artificial&quot;:</p><p>  D4   A4<br/>  A3   D4<br/>  F3   A3<br/>  D3   F3</p><p>However, these two sonorities are not equivalent, because the second<br/>features major thirds and sixths above the bass, expansive or<br/>&quot;outgoing&quot; intervals seeking expansion to the fifth (Maj3-5) and<br/>octave (Maj6-8), as in this common progression:</p><p>A4   G#4<br/>D4   E4<br/>A3   B3<br/>F3   E3</p><p>If we omit the highest voice, in fact, we have a standard 13th-14th<br/>century cadence (Maj6-8 + Maj3-5) resolving to a complete Gothic trine<br/>(2:3:4, here E3-B3-E4), which Pythagorean tuning nicely serves.</p><p>In a 16th-century setting, the same two-voice progressions participate<br/>in a different kind of progression from one _harmonia perfetta_ or<br/>5-limit sonority to another, with meantone as a fine realization.</p><p>To conclude, I might just observe that Zarlino urges composers ideally<br/>to alternate the natural or &quot;harmonic&quot; division of the fifth --<br/>e.g. C3-E3-G3 -- with the artificial or &quot;arithmetic&quot; division,<br/>e.g. D3-F3-A3. Such alternation is typical in various modes.</p><p>This distinct preference in multi-voice harmony produces an aesthetic<br/>rather different from that of the more &quot;polarized&quot; major/minor keys of<br/>the 18th century, where one division tends to prevail.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
