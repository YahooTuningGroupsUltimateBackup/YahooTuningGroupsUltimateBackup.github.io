This written for the Vox Novus Composer&apos;s Voice series and was not selected. The call for scores gave a choice of percussion instruments paired with flute. I chose a vibraphone as being one that suited the picture I was trying to paint - spooky, a bit light hearted yet sad.</p><p> As for the composition itself it is written in free tonality that is driven by melodic and harmonic tendencies that I heard / imagined while composing.Of course your mileage may vary. I took this as an opportunity to explore various 12 note tunings, specifically Blue JI, Pythagorean JI  and  Marvelous dwarf 1/4 kleismic tempered duodene</p><p>The score for the piece is here:<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/the_angels_of_minamisoma/The_Angels_of_Minamisoma.pdf">http://micro.soonlabel.com/the_angels_of_minamisoma/The_Angels_of_Minamisoma.pdf</a></p><p>The Pythagorean version of the piece is here:<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/the_angels_of_minamisoma/the_angels_of_minamisoma_phythagorean.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/the_angels_of_minamisoma/the_angels_of_minamisoma_phythagorean.mp3</a></p><p>This file and all of the other tuning variations can be played online at <a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=806">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=806</a></p></div>
