Pehrson:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;My favorite part of it is the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fact that the TRITONE is the OCTAVE!  That&apos;s just great in my<br/>&gt;&gt;book...<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; turning the &quot;resolving&quot; interval into the ultimate consonant diad!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoopee!</p><p>P. Erlich:<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, that would be true for any 6-note scale when played on a<br/>&gt;&gt; standard keyboard.</p><p>J. Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt;Well, so much the better! That means that most ANY 6-note scales are<br/>&gt;going to have a similar effect!</p><p>and in another message, Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&gt;Is the point of the decatonic to make the traditional 7-limit interval<br/>&gt;the ultimate consonance... the C to Bb being the octave in this case.</p><p>Joseph, it seems you&apos;re placing far too much importance on the way these<br/>scales are mapped to the keyboard. The &quot;former&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; function of<br/>any interesting intervals in these scales is _totally irrelevant_ because<br/>the mapping to the traditional keyboard, and the fact that the traditional<br/>keyboard is used at all, is _purely arbitrary_. These characteristics you&apos;ve<br/>been focusing on are completely incidental, and could easily disappear in a<br/>keyboard mapping philosophy different from &quot;one key, one pitch&quot; (see my<br/>paper for a couple of different ways to map 22-tET scales to the standard<br/>keyboard). To someone listening to (as opposed to playing) the music, what<br/>possible difference could it make what 12-tET keyboard interval a particular<br/>xenharmonic interval is mapped to???</p></div>
