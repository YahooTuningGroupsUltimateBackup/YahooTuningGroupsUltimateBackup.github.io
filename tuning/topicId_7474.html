How about written sources? My<br/>&gt;&gt;experience is as follows:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Cars: usually two horns, tuned 2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But now I&apos;m not so sure about the 4:5. In the last few days I think I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been hearing 7:9 for at least some of the major thirds. Please listen to<br/>&gt; the horns in your neighborhood and tell me what you think you hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Link</p><p>My god, John. That&apos;s it!!! I grew up in Detroit. No wonder my ear is fixated<br/>on the 7:9 third. Evidently, I was startled at a young age hearing a Chevy<br/>horn in one ear and a large truck blasting a 2:3 in the other. It really had<br/>nothing to do with my high school choral teacher warming up the group<br/>building major triads a cappella. Besides, all those other kids in the choir<br/>grew up in the Detroit area and were likely similarly infected. ;-)</p><p>Keep up the good work, my friend.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=11196 href="#11196">ðŸ”—</a>James C.

A section on Harry Partch. From<br/>inspirational to riotously funny - which reminds me of why I&apos;m writing. The<br/>book mentions Wendy Mae Chambers, who dug through auto graveyards until she<br/>had enough different car horns to build the car horn organ. The CD features<br/>her playing - most appropriately - &quot;New York, New York.&quot;</p><p>My library has it, and I hope yours does, too.</p><p>- Chris P.</p></div>
