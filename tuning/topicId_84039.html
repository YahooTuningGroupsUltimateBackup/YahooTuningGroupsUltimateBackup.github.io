For some reason which I was unable to explain at that time, I just didn&apos;t want to use small intervals in my scales and I was doing everything I could to avoid intervals under 100 cents or so.  In October, I was making meantone variations on an old ciacona and I ran it through some very dense reverb--here&apos;s an excerpt from that: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/uoylni">www.sendspace.com/file/uoylni</a></p><p>A few days later, I took an excerpt of my first semisixths piece and ran it through the same reverb: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/roin30">www.sendspace.com/file/roin30</a></p><p>Suddenly, when I heard the result, I was almost disgusted every time any of the voices rose or fell by the small 56-cent step. This means that although intervals in semisixths are about 2 cents away from JI, that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that we can mix the tones of this temperament in whatever way we choose. And this gave me the explanation why I didn&apos;t want small intervals in my scales in the first place. Even though my earlier music wasn&apos;t using dense reverb, I think I was somewhat &quot;subconsciously&quot; trying to find a set of tones that would sound good together to me.</p><p>I think that even if we work with 5-limit JI and don&apos;t use temperaments, we can find three &quot;basic&quot; factors which can tell us something about distances of triads. If you tak&eacute; a C major triad and you want to make another triad by changing just one pitch, you can use an A minor, an E minor, or a C minor. This means that the factors changing the pitches are 10/9, 16/15, and 25/24. The interesting thing is that if I use 10/9, it sounds to me as completely &quot;peaceful and relaxed&quot;; if I use 16/15, I&apos;m slightly &quot;more curious about what happens next&quot; but the general feeling is essentially the same; however, if I use 25/24, I suddenly feel like there&apos;s some totally different &quot;mood&quot; going on or simply like if it were another bit of music --- don&apos;t know how to describe that feeling with words.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
