This means that<br/>as long as you credit the author and note any changes or revisions you<br/>might have made, a text is available for circulation, distribution,<br/>reposting, etc.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m especially delighted to have an item used in your Tuning<br/>Dictionary, Monz -- a really great resource including both your own<br/>approaches to the subject and a compilation of views and commentaries by<br/>others. That&apos;s one impressive project!</p><p>A point on the 17-note Pythagorean described in 15th-century Europe<br/>(or more specifically Italy, by Prosdocimus de Beldemandis in 1413 and by<br/>Ugolino of Orvieto sometime around 1425-1440 or so): while this system<br/>(Gb-A#) indeed includes some schismatic intervals, to describe it as a<br/>&quot;schismatic&quot; system might imply that near-5-limit ratios are the preferred<br/>ones. Actually it&apos;s a regular diatonic Pythagorean scale (F-B) plus ten<br/>accidentals, with a flat and a sharp dividing each whole-tone into a<br/>pattern of limma-comma-limma (e.g. F-Gb-F#-G).</p><p>Both Prosdocimus and Ugolino advocate such a system above all as a<br/>solution to the problem of having _regular_ Pythagorean intervals and<br/>cadences available at as many places as possible, especially progressions<br/>by stepwise contrary motion with 32:27 minor thirds before unisons<br/>(min3-1), 81:64 major thirds before fifths, and 27:16 major sixths before<br/>octaves (Maj6-8). In each stepwise progression, one voice moves by a<br/>regular 9:8 whole-tone and the other by a 256:243 diatonic semitone.</p><p>In fact, they advocate the 17-note system as a way of _avoiding_ certain<br/>schismatic variations of these regular intervals -- although a keyboardist<br/>conversant with both the old style and the new might mix them creatively,<br/>using for example schismic thirds and sixths for sustained noncadential<br/>sonorities and regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths for directed<br/>cadences. From this point of view, the 17-note system (or a system with<br/>13 or more notes including both Gb and F#) does include all the notes of<br/>the modern 12-note Gb-B tuning plus a pure fifth B-F# (which Ugolino notes<br/>would be absent in Gb-B where B-Gb does not &quot;fully perfect&quot; this fifth,<br/>resulting in what is now termed a Pythagorean Wolf fifth or diminished<br/>sixth).</p><p>It might be best to say that in earlier 15th-century Europe, the 17-note<br/>tuning is proposed mainly as a method of making more regular Pythagorean<br/>intervals and cadences available at remote locations, but could also serve<br/>as a system for mixing regular and schismatic thirds and sixths according<br/>to the taste of the player.</p><p>It might further be worth specifically emphasizing that the basic diatonic<br/>scale here is regular Pythagorean (F-B), with C-E, for example, as a usual<br/>81:64 third. Likewise F-A and G-B are the usual 81:64 -- in contrast to<br/>&quot;schismatic&quot; systems with intervals like C-Fb, F-Bbb, and G-Cb. The<br/>17-note Pythagorean Europe adds more accidentals to a usual diatonic<br/>Pythagorean system, rather than altering the system to make near-5-limit<br/>intervals a harmonic norm.</p><p>As I discussed in my earlier recent post, the 12-note Gb-B system of this<br/>same era likewise has usual Pythagorean thirds within the regular gamut of<br/>the diatonic notes plus Bb, so that &quot;partially schismatic&quot; might be one<br/>possible description (i.e. sharps tuned as flats).</p><p>Of course, any regular 12-note Pythagorean tuning will have some<br/>schismatic intervals, including the Eb-G# arrangement likely common in the<br/>14th century. Here, for example, the diminished fourth C#-F is a<br/>schismatic major third (resulting, for example, in certain ornamented<br/>versions of the min3-1 cadence in Italian music), while F-C# (which can<br/>come up in some progressions) is a schismatic minor sixth. However, it&apos;s<br/>debatable whether the &quot;5-limit-like&quot; qualities of these intervals was<br/>significant much before the era of 1380-1410, when the partially<br/>schismatic Gb-B tuning may have come into fashion.</p><p>Thus it might be worthwhile to decide just when a Pythagorean tuning with<br/>some schismatic intervals becomes a &quot;schismatic&quot; -- or &quot;semi-schismatic&quot;<br/>(e.g. Gb-B) -- tuning.</p><p>Such distinctions might depend in part on the orientation of the tuning --<br/>how &quot;near&quot; or &quot;remote&quot; are the schismatic intervals (e.g. Eb-G# vs. Gb-B<br/>around 1400, vs. something with C-Fb or the like), and what is the<br/>interpretation of the person describing the tuning (if this is available)?</p><p>Thus it is possible that in one culture or subculture/taste a 17-note<br/>Pythagorean scheme might be favored specifically to approximate a 5-limit<br/>system for the most prominent intervals; in another, to make _regular_<br/>Pythagorean intervals available at more locations (as advocated by<br/>Prosdocimus and Ugolino, with the latter advocating a 17-note organ); and<br/>in yet another, to mix or contrast both types of sonorities in the same<br/>piece (as might have happened in 15th-century Europe if a 17-note keyboard<br/>was actually built, a question left open by Lindley).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
