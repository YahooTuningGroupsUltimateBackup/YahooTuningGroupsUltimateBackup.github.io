A fashionable arrangement of all the ratios in a Farey series of order X?<br/>2. The solutions to an old puzzle involving colored space-filling polytopes?<br/>3. A list of distances between any harmonic and all other harmonics up to X?<br/>4. A list of all the modes of a scale relative to one master key?<br/>5. A slightly-mutilated Rothenberg interval matrix (aka difference matrix)?<br/>6. A Cartesian cross between a set of rationals and their reciprocals?<br/>7. The one structure with the highest complete-chords/notes ratio at limit X?<br/>8. The coordinates in the generic tetrahedral lattice of the centers of<br/>X-dimensional spheres in the first &quot;shell&quot; of their closest-packing?</p><p>#1.  The number of items in a Farey series of order X and Lambdoma of cap X<br/>is 2^X, since there&apos;s X things taken two at a time (two places for a number<br/>in a fraction).  This makes sense if you look at the diamond as a square;<br/>as a child you learn to count objects in a grid by counting along the edges<br/>and multiplying.  The jury is still out on just how fashionable the<br/>arrangement of Farey fractions in the diamond is...</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#2.  Some time ago, John Chalmers posted to the list about his fondness for<br/>Martin Gardner&apos;s recreational math.  Recently, when looking thru my<br/>bookshelf for something to read on my frequent bus trips to and from New<br/>York city, I picked out &quot;Fractal Music Hypercards and More&quot;, which proved<br/>to be a lot of fun.</p><p>One of the articles in it, &quot;The Thirty Color Cubes&quot; (it doesn&apos;t seem to say<br/>what issue of Scientific American it was reprinted from) describes two<br/>classic &quot;domino tiling&quot; puzzles involving a set of cubes.  With 6 colors<br/>and one color to a face, there are 30 ways to paint a cube so it uses each<br/>color only once.</p><p>One puzzle is to take one of these cubes and then build a two-by-two model<br/>of it using 8 of the remaining cubes, so that all touching interior faces<br/>of the model match in color.  A second puzzle is to find a set of 5 cubes<br/>such that they can be placed same-color down on a table and have each of<br/>the 5 remaining colors showing faces up.</p><p>John H. Conway found a graphic method for solving both of these problems:<br/>an arrangement of the 30 cubes in a grid.  The grid has no blocks along<br/>this mysterious diagonal... when I saw this, my diamond warning lights went<br/>off.  With 6 factors the diamond has 36 members, 6 of which will contain<br/>two of the same color (the 1/1&apos;s), leaving 30.  [Of course, we are used to<br/>the 11-limit diamond having 29 pitches, as we only eliminate 5 of the<br/>1/1&apos;s, giving 31, and also eliminate the 9:3 and 3:9]</p><p>All of the solutions to the second puzzle are given by the rows and colums<br/>in Conway&apos;s matrix.  This puzzle is equivalent to selecting O or<br/>Utonalities (minus the unity) from the diamond.  The colors touching the<br/>table are the numerary nexi.</p><p>The first puzzle is solved by finding the inversion of the prototype cube<br/>and taking the 8 cubes for the model from the row and column that intersect<br/>at inversion cube, minus the inversion cube itself and the 1/1&apos;s [11 minus<br/>1 minus 2].  I do not know what musical analog this first puzzle has.</p><p>A final note is that Conway&apos;s matrix itself meets the &quot;domino condition&quot;.<br/>That is, all the touching faces match in color.  Again I do not know the<br/>musical significance (if any).</p><p>It seems to me that the diamond should provide solutions for similar<br/>puzzles involving any number of things and a corresponding set of<br/>thing-sided space-filling polytopes.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#3.  Start with 3, go down to 2.  Take 4 and go down to 3.  Take 5 and go<br/>down to 4 and to 3.  Take 6, go down to 5.  Take 7, go down to 6, 5, and 4.<br/> And so on...  Lambdoma city.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#4.  This was my big breakthru with the diamond.  I had come up with a<br/>bunch of 7-limit scales (one of which was the Centaur), and I wanted to<br/>compare them by how &quot;low numbered&quot; the ratios in each of the modes were.<br/>That is, if I modulated to one of notes in the scale, what kind of<br/>relationships would I have?  In essence, I wanted to make a given note of<br/>the scale 1/1.  This is done by multiplying thru by the reciprocal of that<br/>note.  When I had done this for all the modes, I noticed inversions of the<br/>modes running at right angles.  I had myself a diamond!</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#5.  This article was inspired by John Chalmers, whose substantial work and<br/>ready help has played no small part in my understanding of music, and who<br/>suggested that I explain on the list my recent statement that a scale&apos;s<br/>Rothenberg interval matrix was &quot;just its lambdoma or tonality dimond&quot;.  I<br/>believe that he who has read my recent Rothenberg post, and up to here in<br/>this post, should have no problems turning a diamond into an interval<br/>matrix and back (the interval classes in the IM are the diagonals on the<br/>diamond).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#6.  Yessir.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#7.  This is unproven, but I am convinced it is true.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>#8.  I believe this is also unproven (tho it works in 2 and 3 dimensions).<br/>In fact, I have read things that seem to suggest it is not true.  I wonder<br/>what relationship this question has to question #7?</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This is by no mean a complete list of the amazing properties of the diamond.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=52 href="#52">ðŸ”—</a>bram &#x3C;bram@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1998 12:58:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Speaking of diamonds ...</p><p>Does anyone have an opinion as to whether 9/3 and 3/1 are really the same<br/>thing, or should they be viewed as an auditory pun and used in slightly<br/>different contexts?</p><p>Generalized diamonds are much prettier, more symmetrical-looking things if<br/>you regard them as being a bit different.</p><p>-Bram</p></div><h3><a id=68 href="#68">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/1999 1:59:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>bram wrote:</p><p>&gt; Does anyone have an opinion as to whether 9/3 and 3/1 are really the same<br/>&gt; thing, or should they be viewed as an auditory pun and used in slightly<br/>&gt; different contexts?</p><p>   Perhaps from a diamond-layout perspective they could be placed on two<br/>bars, but obviously there&apos;s no way the ear could distinguish between the two,<br/>except contextually.</p></div><h3><a id=69 href="#69">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/1999 1:21:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Gary<br/>I am new to this forum but I am A Director of the South East Just Intonation<br/>Society--<br/>No difference just numbes  are different<br/>You should obtain Barbara Hero&apos;s Bead theory book from <a href="http://www.lambdoma.com">www.lambdoma.com</a> or get<br/>your hands on Kayser&apos;s Akroasis or get some graph paper and you will be able to<br/>diagnose &quot;equivalence w/o ambivalence.<br/>Resinate and Extenuate<br/>Pat Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just intonation Society</p><p>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Gary Morrison &lt;<a href="mailto:mr88cet@texas.net">mr88cet@texas.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bram wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does anyone have an opinion as to whether 9/3 and 3/1 are really the same<br/>&gt; &gt; thing, or should they be viewed as an auditory pun and used in slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; different contexts?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Perhaps from a diamond-layout perspective they could be placed on two<br/>&gt; bars, but obviously there&apos;s no way the ear could distinguish between the two,<br/>&gt; except contextually.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>&gt; select the User Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
