I followed the earlier thread between David Finnamore and Paul<br/>Erlich which shed some, but not a lot, of much needed light and I&apos;m<br/>grateful to these two for their greater understanding of things<br/>mathematical.

Moving on to the pages with columns - <a href="http://calc.data">calc.data</a>, log2, pitch and<br/>approx 8ve, I think I can see some connection between the numbers in<br/><a href="http://calc.data">calc.data</a>, such as 8 1 phi, read right to left as the arrow indicates,<br/>but I can&apos;t see a consistent correlation. Presumably the log is arrived<br/>at from the data, no idea how, and the other two columns follow. The<br/>approx 8ve column I thought seemed reasonable but I can&apos;t see how 3/19<br/>comes from 1.114727845 and 7/3 from 1.140386925.

This makes perfect<br/>sense to me, and I think is what Dave Keenan was talking about in his<br/>goodbye post to the list, when he brought up a 19-tone subset of<br/>MIRACLE (note that Dave has posted since then but emphasizes that he<br/>isn&apos;t back).</p></div><h3><a id=29981 href="#29981">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2001 10:06:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:genewardsmith@juno.com">genewardsmith@juno.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, that&apos;s certainly clearer now, though I&apos;m unsure as to the<br/>&gt; &gt; importance of MOS scales.

One major breakthrough was<br/>&gt; my &quot;Hypothesis&quot; presented here and discussed more over at tuning-<br/>&gt; math. My personal feeling is that omnitetrachordal variants of MOS<br/>&gt; scales are melodically nicer than MOS scales themselves, though the<br/>&gt; MOS scales tend to have more of the consonant chords. Of course,<br/>&gt; the &quot;Hypothesis&quot; and the question of consonant chords are irrelevant<br/>&gt; for the Horagrams, because consonance doesn&apos;t figure into them in any<br/>&gt; way.</p><p>Interesting. I&apos;m not quite up to the level for the math list. Once I understand what you&apos;ve<br/>explained I&apos;ll try to make sense of the horagrams themselves.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div>
