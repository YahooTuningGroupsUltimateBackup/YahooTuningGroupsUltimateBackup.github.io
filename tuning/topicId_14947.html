It<br/>&gt;really ties together the random stuff I&apos;ve learned about (neo-)gothic<br/>&gt;polyphony. The melody being on the bottom is really wierd, though I suppose<br/>&gt;there&apos;s really no reason for it to be on the top. It sounds wicked in a<br/>&gt;chorus voice on my synth. In Robert Walker&apos;s midi, why is one note of the<br/>&gt;penultimate chord in a different timbre?</p><p>Ah, found a bug in TS.</p><p>It was supposed to be choir Ahs for all the voices.</p><p>However I haven&apos;t tested combination of recording to Midi as you play<br/>while using as Midi In the Midi output from another prog before.</p><p>Looking now at the hex dump for it, I see that it only did the Ah patch for that<br/>one note, and the rest didn&apos;t have any voice patches at all.</p><p>Since they didn&apos;t have any patches, and because Media player doesn&apos;t do a<br/>reset for the patches, when I played it back in Windows Media Player, it<br/>sounded okay.</p><p>There&apos;s an option in TS to use the original patches from the MIDI In, and with<br/>that option you get the patches okay, but if you choose option for TS to use it&apos;s<br/>own patches, which is what I did, it leaves them out - definitely a bug.</p><p>So here is a version with choir Oohs and choir Aahs for the melody line.<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/happy_birthday_Keenan.mid">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/happy_birthday_Keenan.mid</a></p><p>This one has Oohs and shanai:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_Keenan_with_shanai.mid">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_Keenan_with_shanai.mid</a></p><p>This one has no patches at all:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_Keenan_no_patches.mid">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_Keenan_no_patches.mid</a></p><p>The notes are assigned to the channels in order of pitch. Not sure exactly<br/>how that is happening at present - I think NWC is prob. playing them on<br/>channels 1.and 2., and TS is re-assgning them to separate channels for<br/>each voice in order to get the pitch bends right, and is ignoring the NWC<br/>distinction between channs. 1. and 2, and making the voice distinction<br/>between 1. and 2. by using multiple patches in same channel.</p><p>So if you play the last two in that order, you will prob. find that when you<br/>get to the one with no patches, the shanai is playing the lowest notes only,<br/>without the voice crossing.</p><p>(Multiple simultaneous patches in same chann. are not in Midi spec, but<br/>I gather that they are common to the nearly all modern implementation,<br/>e.g. of soundcards, that uses concept of tracks instead of channel, and<br/>TS uses them extensively).</p><p>N.B. it uses channels 2 to 4, and chann 5. for the extra note in the<br/>second last chord. (Not sure why it isn&apos;t using Chann 1 - have to look<br/>into that...)</p><p>It should really also change channels between every note for each melody line.</p><p>That&apos;s for voices like celeste that can continue to sound noticeably after the<br/>note has stopped (depending on Midi Synth)</p><p>When all notes are played in same channel, the resonance from the previous note<br/>will be pitch bent along with the new note, because MIDI pitch bends are for<br/>the entire channel rather than a single note. Can have rather wierd effect for wide<br/>pitch bends and solo voice, but with these rich chords, you don&apos;t really notice it<br/>when it happens.</p><p>Alternatively, you can just use an All sound off to switch off all sound in the<br/>channel before the pitch bend, but that can create a noticeable &quot;Click&quot; effect<br/>as all the voices are abruptly cut off, so I don&apos;t want to do that.</p><p>This shows what I mean (first few notes of a fractal tune, Celeste voice,<br/>deliberate choice of gamelan scale that has wide pitch bends, including<br/>one of -46.44 cents):<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/pitch_bent_resonances.wav">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/pitch_bent_resonances.wav</a><br/>[156 Kb]</p><p>And with changes of channel for each new note that requires a new<br/>pitch bend.<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/change_chann_for_pitch_bends.wav">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/change_chann_for_pitch_bends.wav</a><br/>[93 Kb]</p><p>For some reason TS isn&apos;t doing this change of channels in this sit.<br/>at present, so I&apos;ll investigate and fix that, and then do a new midi clip<br/>- may sound a bit &quot;crisper&quot;.</p><p>This is 12 tet to compare to hear what diff. the scale makes:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_Keenan_et.mid">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_Keenan_et.mid</a><br/>(same voicing as Oohs + shanai)</p><p>I&apos;ve also uploaded the hex dumps - same file names with ext .hex<br/>They include comments added by TS, to say what all the MIDI hex<br/>codes do.</p><p>The cents values are the actual values in the midi file, i.e. the closest<br/>ones you can get to within the MIDI spec for pitch bends.</p><p>N.B. for TS users:</p><p>There&apos;s also a bug in the new record to midi as you play button -<br/>sometimes sets the patch for one channel, then plays it on another<br/>- I had to fix it to get these midi files to do the patches properly.<br/>Doesn&apos;t affect the Save As Midi file option.</p><p>Next upload of TS beta is delayed - trying to track down a bug that I&apos;ve<br/>introduced since last beta upload and is proving really elusive- if worst<br/>comes to worst, may turn out to be quickest to go back to the 14th Oct code<br/>and add in all the new things again, sorry,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
