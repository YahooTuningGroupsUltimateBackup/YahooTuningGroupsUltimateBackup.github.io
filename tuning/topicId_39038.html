I have no recordings from<br/>that time, but, instead used the equipment in curious live theatrical<br/>performances (I was only 20)</p><p>Anyway, John has a wonderful tribute to Terry and his work on this<br/>page, and it&apos;s a shame that Terry didn&apos;t become better recognized.<br/>He had a rather withdrawn personality.  Tragically he died of unknown<br/>causes in the mid 1990&apos;s according to John.</p><p>I would urge people to listen to some of the electronic music<br/>extracts on this site, which is surely microtonal.  It reminds me of<br/>much of the &quot;freewheeling&quot; tape and splice type analog efforts that<br/>were going on in Ann Arbor Michigan in the very late 1960&apos;s.  Some of<br/>this music, to *me* anyway, has a certain freshness that somehow<br/>digital never achieved...</p><p>Here&apos;s the link:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonalsynthesis.com/wm/index.html">http://www.microtonalsynthesis.com/wm/index.html</a></p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
