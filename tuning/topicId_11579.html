When you present the ideas one at a time, I&apos;m finding that<br/>your English is sufficient to make them perfectly understandable. Please do<br/>not let my challenges to your theories deter you from continuing to try to<br/>cross the language barrier. Rather let them be a springboard for you to<br/>introduce more and more of your ideas, so that, in time, a fuller picture<br/>may emerge. I prefer theories to have a minimum of arbitrary abstract<br/>notions; however I am aware that at this point in time I have only the<br/>flimsiest understanding of how your ideas tie together. By asking you very<br/>pointed questions, and by replying pointedly to your questions, I&apos;m hoping<br/>to tease out the substance of your theory, while at the same time presenting<br/>you with alternatives to consider, as efficiently as possible.</p><p>You wrote (in French):</p><p>&gt;As for the question of listening, I do not have at present any means of<br/>listening &gt;to anything. I would like to, but I cannot. I must have patience.</p><p>Can you play .wav files or .mp3 files on your computer? You should be able<br/>to if you have speakers. I&apos;d be happy to create files of any chords, etc.<br/>that you wish.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
