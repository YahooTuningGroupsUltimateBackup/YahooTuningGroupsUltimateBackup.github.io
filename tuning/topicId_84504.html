Seventh chords were used good 350 years before Late Baroque.</p><p>2. There IS difference between triad dominant and seventh dominant -<br/>second chord itself has more tension thanks to tritone inside, and<br/>resolution of this chord to another chords is more tight and stronger<br/>(depending to which chord it goes).  Basic harmonic function is the<br/>same, of course, and again depends on resolution (you know well<br/>Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek&apos;s resolution G-B-D-F ----&gt; Ab-Db-Db-F).<br/>There is difference also between any triad and seventh chord based on<br/>it, again in the sound (depends on intervallic structure, as we have<br/>12 types of seventh chord) and in the resolution.</p><p>3. During history of European music and music theory using of higher<br/>chords of triadic structure (seventh, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth,<br/>later even crossing two octaves border and using of 12tone triadic<br/>chords) came in my opinion just as logical development of adding more<br/>tones, which is not necessarily connected with harmonic series. But<br/>it&apos;s as well possible ithere&apos;s a connection.<br/>I think that only piano composers like Chopin, Liszt, Debussy, Ravel,<br/>Skriabin found (probably thanks to using of pedal) some beauty in the<br/>chord based on harmonic series (13/11+) and used this intentionally<br/>in some of their works. But they used as well whole tone scale (and<br/>harmony) and diminished scale (and harmony)...</p><p>4. You can&apos;t understand higher tones of triadic chords bigger than<br/>triads just as some &quot;ornamentation&quot; or additional, purely<br/>&quot;decorative&quot; tones to basic triad,  adding only some color to it. All<br/>tones of such chords are equal and have some reason why composers use<br/>them. Maybe we can find some examaples of purely timbral using of<br/>such chords in some styles of the music of 20th century...</p><p>5. There are many ways how to resolve seventh chords, in my personalharmonic theory to any of 24 triads, and of course we can connect<br/>them with more complex chords than triads.</p><p>BTW what&apos;s wrong with resolution F-A-C-D# to E-G#-B-E? It&apos;s standard<br/>harmonic progression, especially in Classicism period, where the<br/>first chord can be subdominant or flatted VI grade in major key, or<br/>VI grade in minor key.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 29 Aug 2009, at 3:20 AM, Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not sure how much you&apos;ll find of interest here but if this makes<br/>&gt; you bored,<br/>&gt; you can let me know. :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few hours ago, I was thinking that while there&apos;s melodic<br/>&gt; ornamentation ()<br/>&gt; and intonational ornamentation (), some properties of classical<br/>&gt; harmony<br/>&gt; could be described as harmonic ornamentation.

I was throwing some<br/>similar ideas around earlier this year, and apparently I&apos;d reached the<br/>conclusion that the 13:4 sonority and the 7:4 sonority were closer in<br/>&quot;harmonic flavor&quot; than 7:4 and 11:4, when used in an otonal sonority.</p><p>&gt; i.e. octaves work as equivalence intervals, fifths<br/>&gt; determine the &quot;harmonic fundamental&quot;, and thirds determine major or minor<br/>&gt; &quot;tonal gender&quot; (I&apos;m translating word for word from Czech, don&apos;t know if<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a proper English name for this).</p><p>They would usually refer to it as the chord &quot;quality&quot;, I think,<br/>although that could also refer to whether it&apos;s a 7th chord, or a 9th<br/>chord, or an aug#11, or what have you. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a term<br/>that refers specifically to which type of third the chord uses.</p><p>&gt; i.e. whether you played<br/>&gt; &quot;G-D-G-B, C-C-E-C&quot; or &quot;G-D-F-B, C-C-E-C&quot;, the harmonic &quot;meaning&quot; of the<br/>&gt; phrase was more or less the same.</p><p>How about G-C#-F-B, C-C-E-C? And if we had more than 4 notes in here,<br/>I&apos;d throw in a b9 for good measure too :)</p><p>&gt; Now, if we think of it in terms of successive primes, then we get 2 as the<br/>&gt; interval of equivalence, 3 as the identifier of the harmonic fundamental, 5<br/>&gt; as the identifier of &quot;tonal gender&quot;, and 7 for harmonic ornamentation.<br/>&gt; Although I say this with some disappointment (since my meantone-like<br/>&gt; conditioning doesn&apos;t support this claim), it&apos;s pretty possible that the use<br/>&gt; of seventh chords arose from some ideas of approximating 7-limit intervals.</p><p>So would you describe the extended and altered harmonies incorporating<br/>b9&apos;s and #9&apos;s to be 17- and 19- limit intervals? Would a #11 be a<br/>ratio of 11, or perhaps a 23?</p><p>If you look at it that way, it&apos;s interesting to see the tendency<br/>people have to actually strengthen the fundamental of dominant chords<br/>with these higher-limit ratios. You would expect a triad like<br/>4:5:6:7:17/2:19/2:23/2 to be extremely accordant and resonate well as<br/>a 1 chord, but this added resonance is much more often used within the<br/>context of a V chord (or an aug6 chord), with it often resolving to a<br/>far simpler form of I chord. You do of course see b7&apos;s and #11&apos;s and<br/>#9&apos;s as 1 chords in certain contexts (like the very end of a song<br/>sometimes)...</p><p>And even more interesting about this approach is that (especially in<br/>early American pop music) these extended harmonies are often in a way<br/>that sounds completely natural and intuitive, even though it<br/>completely steps outside the realm of whatever scale or mode the song<br/>is in. Of course, for some reason, when I try to throw 13/4 right in<br/>like that, it doesn&apos;t always sit right. (maybe I&apos;m just biased towards<br/>12-tet intervals).</p><p>&gt; OTOH, meantone supports a different view on the 7/4 (i.e. as an augmented<br/>&gt; sixth) and I have found chords using it in the most acoustically &quot;correct&quot;<br/>&gt; ways, even at some expense of breaking basic classical harmony rules )i.e.<br/>&gt; F-A-C-D#, E-B-G#-E). But even then, such a D# sounds to me like some<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonic ornamentation&quot; to the F major.</p><p>What classical rule does that break?</p><p>&gt; Interestingly enough, 7-limit ratios were never used in a similar way to the<br/>&gt; 5-limit ones.

Quite different world :-) Nice to see how near triadic and quartal structure can be - sometimes it depends on the way how chord is written.</p><p>&gt; If you look at it that way, it&apos;s interesting to see the tendency<br/>&gt; people have to actually strengthen the fundamental of dominant chords<br/>&gt; with these higher-limit ratios.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Not only dominant chord...</p><p>&gt; You would expect a triad like<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7:17/2:19/2:23/2 to be extremely accordant and resonate well as<br/>&gt; a 1 chord,<br/>&gt;</p><p>For chord functions in functional harmony it&apos;s better to use Roman numerals - I, II... For I, IV and V we usually use T, S and D. Your writing &quot;1&quot; is confusing.</p><p>&gt; but this added resonance is much more often used within the<br/>&gt; context of a V chord (or an aug6 chord), with it often resolving to a<br/>&gt; far simpler form of I chord. You do of course see b7&apos;s and #11&apos;s and<br/>&gt; #9&apos;s as 1 chords in certain contexts (like the very end of a song<br/>&gt; sometimes)...<br/>&gt;</p><p>This kind of using of higher triadic chords has direct relation to harmonics series, for sure (provided there&apos;s 13/11+/9/7, like 13th, 11th, 9th and 7th harmonic tone). It serves really as colorization of ending T chord in some jazz styles (or other chords in the song).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And even more interesting about this approach is that (especially in<br/>&gt; early American pop music)<br/>&gt;</p><p>What do you mean by this? Could you specify?</p><p>&gt; &gt; OTOH, meantone supports a different view on the 7/4 (i.e. as an &gt; augmented<br/>&gt; &gt; sixth) and I have found chords using it in the most acoustically &gt; &quot;correct&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; ways, even at some expense of breaking basic classical harmony &gt; rules )i.e.<br/>&gt; &gt; F-A-C-D#, E-B-G#-E). But even then, such a D# sounds to me like some<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;harmonic ornamentation&quot; to the F major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What classical rule does that break?<br/>&gt;<br/>I have asked him the same, as I&apos;m sure it&apos;s quite OK in the classical music.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3><a id=84517 href="#84517">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2009 1:58:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do you mean fifths and thirds as consonances?</p><p>No, I mean fourths.
