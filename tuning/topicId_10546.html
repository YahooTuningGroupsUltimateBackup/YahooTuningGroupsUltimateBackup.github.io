You bring in historical tuning limits,<br/>the nature of modality and tonality, a 22-tet tuning and subsets of it<br/>new to many people, and what I find rather playful &quot;remappings&quot; (not<br/>necessarily to a specific keyboard layout) of interval names such as<br/>&quot;perfect seventh&quot; for something about as wide of 3:2 as a 19-tet fifth<br/>is narrow of this just ratio.</p><p>Trying to understand such a tuning in terms of keyboard mappings,<br/>Joseph, is what I consider one natural and concrete approach. Of<br/>course, I agree with Paul that such a mapping is only one lens through<br/>which to view a tuning, so to speak -- but it&apos;s a starting point.</p><p>As far as the topicality on this Alternate Tuning List of discussions<br/>about subsets of tunings, specifically equal divisions of the octave<br/>(n-tone equal temperaments or n-tet&apos;s for short), mapped to keyboards,<br/>I would say that it is very topical.</p><p>For example, mapping a given six tones of 12-tet to a keyboard octave<br/>is a starting point where I would consider a natural response on this<br/>Tuning List to be: &quot;Yes, 12-tet is one possible equal division with<br/>lots of six-note possibilities in itself, but why don&apos;t we make this<br/>experiment even more fascinating by also trying corresponding six-note<br/>(or n-note) subsets of 11-tet, or 17-tet, or 19-tet, or 24-tet, or<br/>31-tet, or 53-tet -- or, of course, 22-tet?&quot;</p><p>As for reader difficulties in comprehending intricate theoretical<br/>statements, by authors including myself, I would consider it routine,<br/>a flaw neither of the author or the reader, but a natural part of the<br/>imperfect but engaging process of communication.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
