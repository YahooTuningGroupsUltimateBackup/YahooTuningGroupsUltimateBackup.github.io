So Scala agrees with my paper. My quote<br/>&gt; above agrees only with the version of the mapping I used for my senior<br/>&gt; project in 1993-4.</p><p>Thanks, Paul, for the clarification.  I was looking around for ANOTHER<br/>Scala mapping file that would pertain, and wasn&apos;t finding it...  Now I<br/>don&apos;t have to.</p><p>___________ ______ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
