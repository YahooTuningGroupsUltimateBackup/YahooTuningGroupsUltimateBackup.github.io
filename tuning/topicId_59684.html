First, perhaps the focus just on Bach is not the only issue here; obviously, there were hundreds, perhaps thousands of other keyboard players in Germany (not to mention the rest of Europe) at the time of Bach...so, what tunings were they using? And, what about the rest of the musicians, from string players to horns? I would imagine when keyboards were used in a composition, everybody would follow that tuning; but, what about when keys weren&apos;t part of an ensemble (I assume there was music being made that did not feature keys)...how would the musicians tune then?<br/>  And, although lute music was not a very large part of Bach&apos;s compositions, he did write some things, as well as rearrange some other works for lute (definitely pieces from the violin sonatas and cello suites)...and, he was known to have played with lutenists on occasion, and I imagine the lutes were in 12 equal, or very close. He was also known to have a clavier with the tone of a lute, and his lute works, perhaps, were composed to be played on lute or clavier. So, when he and Sylvious Weiss jammed, did Bach retune to 12 eq? Or, did it matter? Did he care? In fact, the eminent lutenist Lutz Kirchof said in the liner notes for his recording of the lute suites, that Bach wrote pieces for lute that may have been unplayable in the form he wrote them...but, he would give them to the lutenists, and expect them to make the necessary alterations to the original, so they were then playable on lute. So, it sounds like he was a very open minded sort, open to various interpretations of his works.<br/>  It seems to me, and I am not an expert by a long shot, that Bach, who was a very practical, working musician, and in touch with all sorts of musicians in his area, would have been familiar with many of the tuning theories of the time, and may well have used different tunings, depending on the circumstances he found himself in...why not? Perhaps he favored one particular tuning for his compositions, but maybe he experimented...again, why not? He seems like a most intelligent, curious man, who transcribed music by many other composers from various countries, which means he was exposed to many theories of composition by other masters...which also brings up an interesting question: when Bach was transcribing works from Italian or French composers, what tuning were THOSE pieces in, and did Bach leave them in the original tuning, or put them in one of his favorites? And if he did change the tuning from what the original composer intended, did it change the piece? In a good way or negative way?<br/>  I had never considered some of these issues before this discussion, and now I am. Again, I think it&apos;s a lot bigger than Bach, and I&apos;m not sure how many definitive answers there are for some of these issues...I&apos;m looking forward to seeing what some of you forum folks have to say about all this...best...HHH</p></div><h3><a id=59686 href="#59686">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@akjmusic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2005 1:11:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>Nice questions. I think they boil down to: was Bach a tuning pluralist or not?<br/>Conidering his knowledge of Italian, French, and English masters and trends,<br/>each with their own regional and historical tuning trends, I imagine he<br/>embraced plurality of means, and maybe, where he had control of it, came up<br/>with one or maybe more of his own tunings to suit the needs of a &apos;general<br/>practice universal musician&apos;.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m would be surprised if he didn&apos;t know of French Temperamant<br/>Ordinaire that Rameau used, 1/6 comma meantone, Werckmeister,<br/>1/5-commameantone, 12-equal on fretted instruments, perhaps some<br/>proto-Neidhardt or proto-Sorge tunings, and for sure experimented with<br/>homegrown varieties, eventually arriving at something<br/>exactly equivalent or closely equivalent to what Brad Lehman describes, which<br/>is incidentally, close to what Neidhardt and Sorge, and Sorge in particular,<br/>proposed.</p><p>In answer to transcribing from other sources, I can imagine that the<br/>transcribed music would work in Bach&apos;s German tuning of choice, but might<br/>lose some character of its sound, and this would be particularly true of<br/>anything French which might have used Temperament Ordinaire, which is a<br/>modified meantone of the Rameau perios where the wolf fifth gets distributed<br/>through 4 wide fifths.</p><p>In Italian music, where you have the Vivaldi Concerti transcriptions, I&apos;m not<br/>certain what Vivaldi&apos;s tuning would be. I&apos;m guessing 1/6-comma meantone,<br/>because I think Vivaldi&apos;s music doesn&apos;t venture outside the meantone keys,<br/>but I haven&apos;t listened to or studied all 60,000 concerti that he wrote!<br/>Anyway, my guess is that Italy continued in the meantone tradition longer<br/>than Germany. Does anyone know what, say Frescobaldi&apos;s organ was tuned to?<br/>My guess is 1/5 or 1/6 comma....</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>On Wednesday 17 August 2005 1:23 pm, Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;    Because Bach is my favorite musician, the well temp discussion interests<br/>&gt; me, and I&apos;ve been thinking about what has been said so far, and I have a<br/>&gt; few questions/comments.

A<br/>&gt; baroque flutist did not have a 12-note-octave, he had<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; 18-note-octave, and all the discussions about how to<br/>&gt; tune the twelve keys on a keyboard instrument are<br/>&gt; typically done by keyboarders who stare at their own<br/>&gt; insturment only. But Bach, when composing a piece for<br/>&gt; flute and harpsichord, he would be aware of that,<br/>&gt; because Buffardin for sure wasn&apos;t playing<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, he was playing meantone.<br/>&gt; As to the trumpet techniques - I was using the German<br/>&gt; words which Walther uses in his dictionary because we<br/>&gt; don not know for sure what they mean. Valveless<br/>&gt; trumpet playing techniques were guild secrets for<br/>&gt; which the little German town of Weissenfels had the<br/>&gt; monopoly. Practically all famous trumpeters came from<br/>&gt; there, and they had learnt it from their relatives.</p><p>Michael,</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p><p>I was referring specifically to overtone flutes - that is,<br/>end-blown flutes without fingering holes - rather than<br/>to the baroque flute.  But your information is quite<br/>interesting nonetheless!  I take it that the 18 holes per<br/>octave were required to distinguish, say, D# from Eb -<br/>notes which are enharmonic equivalents in 12-EDO, and<br/>indeed in 12-UDO (12 Unequal Divisions ofthe Octave)?<br/>What were the 18 notes per octave?  The only way I can<br/>arrive at 18 notes is by including both ends of the octave,<br/>thus:<br/>   8 naturals (say) C to C&apos;<br/>+ 5 sharps on C D F G and A<br/>+ 5 flats on  D E G A and B.</p><p>Or have I completely missed the boat here?</p><p>Re the trumpet techniques, if they are now unknown in<br/>Germany, I guess they&apos;re waiting to be reinvented!<br/>Anyone who&apos;d like to become famous might spend some<br/>time trying that ...  Still, if necessity is the mother of<br/>invention, ease is the mother of conservatism.  When it<br/>became a little easier to produce the required pitches<br/>using valves, very few players would have seen much<br/>point in continuing to do things the hard way, so it&apos;s<br/>understandable that those techniques were lost.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=59745 href="#59745">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2005 11:47:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What were the 18 notes per octave?

I am not<br/>talking 18 holes. The baroque transverse flute is an<br/>inverse-conical, normally wooden tube with d as the<br/>fundamental, with six open finger holes and one d#<br/>key. Quantz added a second eb key to the flute, which<br/>however did not become the standard. The 18 different<br/>fingerings were done by cross fingering. I.e. f#&apos; is<br/>fingered 1234---, while gb&apos; is fingered 123-56-. For<br/>any flutist, there would be even more notes per octave<br/>than the 18 I mentioned, because e#&apos; for instance you<br/>can play meantone by fingering f&apos; and rotating the<br/>flute inwards to lower the tone - Quantz actually<br/>provides fingerings for e#&apos;, fx&apos;, cx&apos;&apos; with the<br/>fingerings for f&apos;, g&apos;, and d&apos;&apos;, with the implication<br/>that you alter the sounding note by rotation.</p><p>&lt;Re the trumpet techniques, if they are now unknown in<br/>Germany, I guess they&apos;re waiting to be reinvented!&gt;</p><p>As the techniques were a Weissenfels secret, there is<br/>no written record, and the art is lost. Bach must have<br/>known a lot about it, because Anna Magdalena was from<br/>Weissenfels, and her father was a court trumpeter.<br/>Reinventing the technique is an ordeal which would<br/>take a major part of one&apos;s life, amidst constant<br/>frustration because the valve trumpeters grin at you<br/>all the time, and for no economic benefit and most<br/>likely no students to teach, so why do it?</p><p>Michael</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>How much free photo storage do you get?
