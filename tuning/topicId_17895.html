This<br/>becomes exceedingly important when considering the close matching of<br/>timbre to tuning for ensembles of metallophone instruments. Working<br/>with harmonic timbres is much easier for the generalized tunings you<br/>speak of, but altogether different with inharmonic ones.</p><p>But certainly hearing is believing. Until one actually hears, and<br/>makes music with the effect of tunings matched to inharmonic<br/>partials, then it&apos;s all conjecture. I agree with JdL. It *is*<br/>something wonderful to hear, and not so subtle. This is an active<br/>area of research and music making in my quarter, of which I plan to<br/>share the music and theory in this forum at some future time.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Then you have metallophones and drums, which generally<br/>have partials so different from an integer harmonic series that it wouldn&apos;t<br/>make much sense to think of it either as a &quot;stretched overtone series&quot; _or_<br/>a &quot;squashed overtone series&quot;.</p></div>
