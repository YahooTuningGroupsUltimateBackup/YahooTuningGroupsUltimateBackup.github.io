We taught a workshop called &ldquo;The Sound Visual<br/>Connection&rdquo;, which brought together several ways of doing music and visual<br/>art non-separately.</p><p>We played the students music they hadn&rsquo;t heard before, and they drew<br/>sketches they hadn&rsquo;t drawn before.  We listened to the marching band warming<br/>up outside the window, and performed Andrew&rsquo;s *Miniatures for Two Otonalists<br/>* in a bout of oddmusical evangelism.  Then, a visit to the computer lab for<br/>making graphic computer-music scores with HighC.  Finally, udderbot making!<br/>And circle games.</p><p>I want to put in a plug for HighC &lt;<a href="http://highc.org/history.html">http://highc.org/history.html</a>&gt;.  It&rsquo;s a<br/>beautifully designed, light-weight, elegant program which enables one to<br/>make graphic scores.  Time is on the horizontal axis, and pitch on the<br/>vertical axis.  Different timbres appear as different colors; amplitudes are<br/>represented by line thickness.  Pitch is by default on a continuum<br/>(microtonal in the broadest sense).  The whole thing costs 30 Euros (we used<br/>the demo for our class, but if you&rsquo;re looking for an Xmas present for<br/>Oddmusic&mldr;)</p><p>Following a brief introduction to the program, students were given only *10<br/>minutes* to make a score lasting between 12 and 30 seconds.  I arranged the<br/>results into this slideshow, which gives a peek into the variety attainable<br/>with this program, as well as the variety of each student.<br/><a href="http://oddmusicuc.wordpress.com/2010/12/19/making-graphic-scores-is-easier-than-ever/">http://oddmusicuc.wordpress.com/2010/12/19/making-graphic-scores-is-easier-than-ever/</a></p></div>
