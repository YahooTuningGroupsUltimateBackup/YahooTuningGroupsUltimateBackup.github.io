This is<br/>silly.  The tones in Chinese are relative.

There are four basic pitch *inflections*: flat, up,<br/>down-up, and down.  There are *not* absolute tones that one is expected<br/>to recognize.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/14/1999 6:54:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/14/1999 07:36:12 PM, <a href="mailto:christopher.chapman@conexant.com">christopher.chapman@conexant.com</a><br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;The premise of the article seems to me to be that speakers of Chinese<br/>&gt;must have perfect pitch because they speak a tonal language.

Also regional dialects influence a lotta of the<br/>&quot;inflections.&quot;<br/>This is how a knowledgable person from Beijing can tell where another<br/>Mandarin speaker hails from - whether they are from Wuhan, Taiwan, Singapore<br/>or from America (or even Germany) . . . whether they are a native speaker or<br/>a non-native speaker.</p><p>zHANg, Han Qwa&apos;i/Jung G&apos;war Ren</p></div>
