I find it remarkable that such a<br/>&gt;&gt;coherently structured, extended piece came about &quot;bottom-up&quot; rather than<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;top-down.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;My recollection of the Bruford interview was that they<br/>&gt;sat and discussed the music right down to what note<br/>&gt;and chord went next. Close to the Edge in particular.<br/>&gt;If I can figure out where I read this I&apos;ll look for the interview,<br/>&gt;but not now - I&apos;m trying to wrap a bunch of stuff before<br/>&gt;the end of the month.</p><p>You&apos;re both right.  I believe the interview David refers to appears on the<br/>YesStory (or something) video, which I once borrowed from a friend.</p><p>While The YES Album and Fragile featured jam-derived compositions, Close to<br/>the Edge and Tales featured this method where Steve and Jon (and sometimes<br/>Chris) would come up with fragments, and then the band would piece them<br/>together.  For Tales the piecing process was a little less democratic than<br/>some members liked, as Jon and Steve had worked more closely together in<br/>the fragment-making process and already agreed on a lot of things by the<br/>time they got to the studio.</p><p>Relayer was the first and only album for which a piece was completely<br/>composed before entering the studio.  That was The Gates of Delirium, by<br/>Anderson.  The other two cuts on Relayer returned more to the jam-oriented<br/>style, owing much to the influence of Patrick Moraz.</p><p>There are guys out there who know the origin of every fragment.  For<br/>example, the &quot;What happened to this song&quot; section of The Revealing Science<br/>of God (Tales) was written by Steve Howe in the 60&apos;s, years before he<br/>joined YES.  A recording Steve made of it appears on Homebrew, which is a<br/>complete artistic disaster.</p><p>I never subscribed to Notes, but I tried to read them (<a href="http://nfte.org">nfte.org</a>) for a<br/>while.  At the time (&apos;96) there was a serious lack of intelligent<br/>discussion, and I gave up.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
