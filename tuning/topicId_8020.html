Might that have any<br/>&gt;&gt;relation to this discussion. (If that is a naive notion, just say so and<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ll forget it.)</p><p>And Paul Erlich clarified:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did respond to that -- it was the first time I suggested 1/24:1/19:1/16.<br/>&gt; The common overtone of these notes is the dominant, four octaves higher. As<br/>&gt; for undertones, the &quot;undertone series&quot; does not occur in nature as a<br/>&gt; simultaneous event, the way the overtone series does.</p><p>Sorry. I guess I either missed it altogether or failed to connect it to my<br/>question. Sorry. I&apos;ll try to do better in the future. BTW, thanks for the<br/>info.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
