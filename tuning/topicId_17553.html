During the early part of the meantone era, one<br/>&gt; could be burned at the stake for spurning church doctrine, and the<br/>&gt; definition of the scale was something that the church seemed to have<br/>&gt; strong feelings about. Secular composers had to have some idea of<br/>&gt; what was acceptable, not only to the church, but also their<br/>&gt; audiences.</p><p>Here two issues are raised: the attitude of late 15th-17th century<br/>composers and theorists to consonance and dissonance in tuning, and<br/>the interplay between theology and musical (including intonational)<br/>style.</p><p>To begin, I would certainly agree that &quot;the early part of the meantone<br/>era&quot; (say 1450-1600) was indeed, most tragically, a high point of the<br/>Inquisition, and also, during the Reformation/Counter-Reformation of<br/>the 16th century, of religious wars. How ironic that the treatise of<br/>Ramos (1482) preceded by only two years a famous Papal declaration<br/>lending impetus to the anti-witchcraft mania, a madness which was to<br/>lead to the mass murder and torture of women and men in Protestant as<br/>well as Catholic Europe during the next two centuries and a bit more.</p><p>In the late 15th-century Spain of Ramos, the 5-limit monochords and<br/>new meantone keyboards which this theorist reports were sadly<br/>accompanied by the triumph of intolerance under the Spanish<br/>Inquisition of Torquemada, the expulsion of the Jews (1492) and Moors<br/>(1498) who would not convert to Christianity, and the start of a hunt<br/>for &quot;covert Jews&quot; who espoused Christianity but might retain some of<br/>their Jewish customs and ceremonies. This reign of inhumanity was a<br/>dramatic step backward from the 13th century, when all three religions<br/>were recognized and tolerated in both Catholic and Islamic parts of<br/>Spain.</p><p>In such an area as astronomy and cosmology, around 1440-1460 the<br/>Bishop Nicolas of Cusa could describe a universe not only with the sun<br/>at the center of our solar system, but with many such solar systems,<br/>many inhabited by possibly superior forms of life. In the era of<br/>Galileo, as we know, by 1616 the &quot;teaching or defense&quot; of heliocentric<br/>views could indeed cause one to be charged and convicted of heresy.</p><p>However, to my best knowledge, questions of musical intonation were a<br/>matter of professional rather than theological &quot;heresy,&quot; with the<br/>negative consequences much like those faced by European and other<br/>musicians of various eras when they dare to champion the new and<br/>unconventional.</p><p>Thus a century after Marchettus of Padua (1318) had advocated a tuning<br/>system for voices which could be read to divide the whole-tone into<br/>five equal parts, Prosdocimus of Beldemandis (1425 or later) wrote as<br/>another mathematician to correct the &quot;errors&quot; of this departure from<br/>traditional Pythagorean integer mathematics. However, these errors are<br/>presented in musical and mathematical rather than theological terms.</p><p>In 1482, when Ramos described a monochord with 5:4 and 6:5 thirds, he<br/>became the center of professional controversy and acrimony --<br/>involving to my best knowledge other music theorists, however, rather<br/>than the Inquisition. Adding fuel to the fire -- fortunately, a<br/>figurative expression rather than a literal _auto de fe_ -- was his<br/>rejection of Guido d&apos;Arezzo and conventional solmization, iconically<br/>revered in the musical tradition of the time. This professional stance<br/>of irreverence led to professional rather than ecclesiastical<br/>consequences.</p><p>In the 20th century, also, musicians such as Charles Ives were not<br/>exempt from such a fate. Interestingly, while Pythagorean vs. 5-limit<br/>mathematics were an important part of the controversy, Gafurius, the<br/>great rival of Ramos, recognizes in 1496 that keyboards are in<br/>practice tempered in meantone.</p><p>When Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576) espoused his music based on the<br/>chromatic and enharmonic genera (the latter realized in his 31-note<br/>division of the octave), he found himself in a disputation with<br/>Lusitano (1551 or thereabouts) in which he was judged the loser -- and<br/>thus prodded to write his great treatise of 1555 on _Ancient Music<br/>Adapted to Modern Practice_. In 1558, without mentioning his name,<br/>Zarlino condemned the &quot;chromaticists&quot; in the strongest language,<br/>directly addressing the issues of the Vicentino-Lusitano controversy,<br/>but does not accuse Vicentino and his followers of theological (as<br/>opposed to musical) heresy.</p><p>In fact, theologians curiously may have been more open than many<br/>musicians (including a radical theorist such as Vincenzo Galileo,<br/>father of the astronomer who _would_ have problems with the<br/>Inquisition) to Vicentino&apos;s chromaticism, since he took a reverent<br/>attitude to Church music and was concerned about the frivolous<br/>treatment of the liturgy and of sacred texts.</p><p>While the Council of Trent devoted much attention to liturgical music,<br/>I am not aware of any special concerns with intonation: the curbing of<br/>&quot;worldly&quot; styles, and the easy intelligibility of the text, were major<br/>themes, along with the trimming back of much of the diverse medieval<br/>repertory of chants.</p><p>Thus Cardinal Carlo Borromeo of Milan remarked that he was open to<br/>various styles of the &quot;intelligible music&quot; championed by the Council,<br/>and would be ready to hear a chromatic Mass by Vicentino.</p><p>Tragically, there was no need for the Inquisition to delve into<br/>questions of musical intonation in order to keep itself busy: in late<br/>16th-century Milan, for example, the people were told that it was<br/>their religious duty to inform against neighbors suspected of heresy;<br/>and even in Venice, known for its religious diversity and tolerance,<br/>those convicted of heresy were sometimes executed (secretly by<br/>drowning in this maritime Republic) in response to political pressure<br/>with its arbitrary caprices. Four hundred years later, the lesson that<br/>governments should not premeditatedly kill their own citizens has yet<br/>to be learned in some &quot;civilized&quot; societies.</p><p>Turning now to the question of consonance and intonational motivations<br/>in the meantone era, I would say that temperament was generally<br/>regarded as more of a practical necessity than a deliberate quest for<br/>slightly impure intervals.</p><p>However, in additional to the enthusiastic cultivation of new<br/>intervals such as the near-11:9 &quot;proximate minor third&quot; by Nicola<br/>Vicentino, composers did sometimes use &quot;odd&quot; meantone intervals such<br/>as the diminished fourth or augmented fifth to give special color to<br/>the music. This can be heard in the keyboard music of Cabezon, and<br/>also in a vocal Psalm setting of the era around 1600.</p><p>In describing a tuning which might be described as a<br/>&quot;semi-well-temperament,&quot; Arnold Schlick (1511) advocates that Ab be<br/>tuned so as to serve as a marginally acceptable G# in quick cadential<br/>passages; the idea seems to be a practical compromise rather than a<br/>search for modal color or the like.</p><p>There&apos;s much more to be said here, but maybe this is a starting<br/>point for discussion, and I welcome any corrections or amendments to<br/>my impression that intonational style was not in itself a matter for<br/>religious persecution in this often all-too-intolerant age, although it<br/>often could be and was a topic for various theological analogies and<br/>allegories.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
