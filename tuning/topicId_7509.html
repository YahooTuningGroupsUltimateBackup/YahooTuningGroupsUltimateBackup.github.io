Specifically, a &quot;diesis&quot; (without further<br/>qualifications) refers to the difference in JI between three major thirds<br/>and an octave. Starting on Ab, going up a major third to C, another major<br/>third to E, and another major third to G#, we find the diesis Ab:G# =<br/>128:125 = 41 cents. To render this progression without the 41-cent shift, as<br/>would be required for much of Schubert&apos;s music for example, one has to use<br/>(on average) the 12-tET major third, either harmonically or as the<br/>horizontal interval in an adaptive JI scheme. I&apos;d be happy to go into more<br/>detail and map this out if you wish.</p><p>&gt;And why is it called &quot;pump?&quot;</p><p>I think it&apos;s because, every time you play the progression in JI with all<br/>common tones observed, the overall pitch shifts by a comma or diesis. So<br/>playing the progression over and over again shifts the pitch more and more,<br/>even though nominally the notes keep returning to the same place. Sort of<br/>like a bicycle pump where you keep pressing the lever, it keeps retuning to<br/>the same place, yet the tire gets more and more full of air . . . ???</p></div><h3>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2000 8:40:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In TD 472.19 Joseph Pehrson &lt;<a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;Subject: Pumping comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have a question concerning the term &quot;pump&quot; as it applies to the &quot;comma<br/>&gt;drift.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What is the difference between the &quot;comma pump&quot; which, evidently, Paul<br/>&gt;Erlich kindly illustrated for me and the &quot;diesis pump?&quot;</p><p>&quot;comma&quot; and &quot;diesis&quot; are the small intervals by which everything is shifted<br/>after going once around the sequence.

It&apos;s just that the noun from the verb &quot;to<br/>pump&quot; doesn&apos;t really work. i.e. &quot;pumpedness&quot;. So we use &quot;drift&quot;, despite<br/>its modern association with aimlessness. Perhaps a mixture of metaphors but<br/>it seems to work. In mechanical engineering one still drifts things with a<br/>hammer. But maybe because of its cyclic nature a chord sequence that does<br/>this seems more like a pump than a hammer. Each time around the cycle,<br/>shifts everything by another comma (or diesis or whatever). I suppose we<br/>could call it &quot;shift&quot; rather than &quot;drift&quot;.</p><p>Diesis pumps don&apos;t occur in diatonic scales. Here&apos;s two:</p><p> ,-&gt; III V VIIb I# -.  4 &quot;stacked&quot; minor thirds<br/>|                    |<br/> &grave;------------------&apos;</p><p> ,-&gt; II IV# VIIb -.    3 &quot;stacked&quot; major thirds<br/>|                  |<br/> &grave;----------------&apos;</p><p>Diesis pumps are kind of obvious. There&apos;s even a discontinuity in the<br/>spelling.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
