At least that&apos;s what<br/>I do. (If you&apos;re writing for a sequencer I guess you&apos;d better count on its<br/>lack of intelligence, lack of musicality, and completely literal<br/>interpretation of your instructions.) For my singers I find that it is<br/>often better to not try to be so complete in my instructions. For example,<br/>when arranging Bydlo (Ox Cart) from Mussorgsky&apos;s Pictures at an Exhibition,<br/>I carefully copied all of Mussorgsky&apos;s eighth-note rests, many of which<br/>simply indicate phrasing. Well, my singers were so careful not to sing<br/>through the rests that they ruined the phrasing! So I rewrote the<br/>arrangement without the rests, forcing my singers to find the phrasing. Of<br/>course I wished that my singers had exercised more intelligence in their<br/>interpretation of the rests, but in any case I think my example shows how a<br/>less complete set of instructions can lead to better results.</p><p>We must also remember that the composer himself might not fully know his<br/>intention. (Is this dangerous ground? Let me go further: A composer, if he<br/>is any good, simply does his best to give instructions to others to<br/>recreate sounds that he has imagined, and might make mistakes in<br/>transcribing his imagination or might be misunderstood.) On several<br/>occasions I&apos;ve had the extremely satisfying experience of hearing one of my<br/>singers, even in an audition, sing something I wrote in such a way that I<br/>felt as if I had been shown something about my music. What a pleasure that<br/>was. I wish that all of you could have performances like that.</p><p>John Link</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill Evans, Ennio and<br/>Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=6731 href="#6731">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/7/1999 3:48:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/7/99 5:34:40 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a> writes:</p><p>&lt;&lt;  A composer, if he<br/> is any good, simply does his best to give instructions to others to<br/> recreate sounds that he has imagined, and might make mistakes in<br/> transcribing his imagination or might be misunderstood. &gt;&gt;</p><p>There are deeper levels, which I am sure you will recognize.

That doesn&apos;t sound like me at all,<br/>yet there it is in my message! (I actually checked to find out whether I<br/>wrote &quot;recreate sounds&quot;.) I should have written &quot;recreate music that he has<br/>imagined&quot;, which of course involves phrasing and other aspects of the<br/>music.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps a metaphor - if I was a sculptor and sculpted a masterpiece and sold<br/>&gt;it to one of you, could you add a little clay of your own before exhibiting<br/>&gt;it under the original artist&apos;s name?</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t do such a thing, and to anyone who would I would say &quot;Keep your<br/>clay to yourself!&quot;. But the metaphor isn&apos;t quite applicable. To stay in the<br/>domain of sculture we&apos;d have to assume that instead of sculpting a<br/>masterpiece you had written instructions for the creation of a masterpiece.<br/>In such a case different sculptors working from your instructions would<br/>supply not a little bit of clay but ALL the clay, and as they fashioned it<br/>with their hands would undoubtedly produce a variety of realizations of<br/>your plan, as cooks do with recipes.</p><p>&gt;About Bach, please, Switch-On, no problem.  I&apos;m just very sensitive to<br/>&gt;distortions that defeat the intent of the composer.  Granted, it&apos;s not easy<br/>&gt;to know the intent.  But if you do, it makes sense to honor that intent if<br/>&gt;performance is your profession.</p><p>I am in complete agreement with you. When I arrange solo piano works for<br/>voices it is my intention to stay true to the composer&apos;s intention as best<br/>as I understand it. I don&apos;t, for example, try to &quot;jazz up&quot; old classics. I<br/>find that so silly. My arrangment of Bach&apos;s &quot;Wachet Auf&quot; expands his melody<br/>line into a four more-or-less parallel voices. I was very careful in<br/>harmonizing the melody to choose chords that sounded like I think Bach<br/>would have used had he made an SATB harmonization. I was guided by the<br/>figured bass and I listened carefully for the appropriateness of the<br/>chords. Sometimes I would write a chord that might be appropriate to some<br/>other style, and I would immediately reject it. By this sort of attention<br/>to detail I believe I created an arrangement that would please Bach, and<br/>maybe even surprise him at the same time. *I* was surprised at some of the<br/>chords that presented themselves this way.</p><p>John Link</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill Evans, Ennio and<br/>Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=6740 href="#6740">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/7/1999 6:44:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d like to share some passages from Leonard Berstein&apos; book &quot;The Infinite<br/>Variety of Music&quot; that I consider relevant to our discussion:</p><p>&quot;...if I deliberately sit down to write an American piece of music, I think<br/>I am likely to write a pretty bad one. If what occurs to me unconsciously<br/>happens to come out sounding American, if it happens to borrow from jazz,<br/>chances are it&apos;ll be a better piece. This has been proved over and over<br/>again, because whatever will derive from American or Americanisms will be<br/>more integral, will be a more organic part of the music. I could make up a<br/>theme that&apos;s about as dull a theme as you can think of. I sit down and<br/>write this tune and say, &quot;That&apos;s awfully dull and besides it doesn&apos;t sound<br/>American.&quot; Now how can I Americanize it? Well, I can apply a little jazz<br/>technique to it. Let&apos;s say instead of a square rhythm I write the same<br/>thing with a boogie beat. That&apos;s easy. Now it begins to have a little more<br/>personality and a little more interest. I could make it even more jazzy;<br/>there are all kind of things I could do. I&apos;m doing these all very<br/>consciously because of a knowledge of how to do them.</p><p>&quot;I have some friends in the composing world who compose this way, and there<br/>have always been composers who compose this way, and there have always been<br/>writers who write this way, and painters who paint this way. And they come<br/>up with a piece finally that can almost be convincing. Now, let&apos;s<br/>say-supposing you hadn&apos;t gone through that little process with me-I come<br/>into Carnegie Hall about to play a piece, a new piece you&apos;ve never heard.<br/>Let&apos;s say I start with a grandiose introduction in Hollywood style, which<br/>*could* be pretty impressive in Carnegie Hall, at least to some people.<br/>Actually, I&apos;ve done nothing. I wouldn&apos;t give you two cents for it. But this<br/>kind of music appears all the time and not only passes muster but causes a<br/>lot of excitement. You can always tell whether it has come from an inner or<br/>an outer place. And the people who can tell best, strangely enough, are not<br/>the critics and not other composers, but the public. In the long run, the<br/>public is a very sure-footed little beast, if it&apos;s a beast at all, that<br/>knows exactly whether it is getting the &quot;McCoy&quot; or not. Even if they hate<br/>the music, they know it&apos;s the &quot;McCoy.&quot; Even if they are listening to a<br/>quartet by Webern and they don&apos;t like Webern, they know that it&apos;s real,<br/>that Webern was a real composer. And the reason for this is that they can<br/>sense the communication. They can tell the music that comes from an inner<br/>place and wasn&apos;t just made up out of somebody&apos;s head.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a little list of other things that can influence the trance and<br/>the concept, and I&apos;d like to run through it without discussing anything in<br/>great detail.<br/>        ...a fashionable trend of the time<br/>        ...What will the critics say?<br/>        ...What will my fellow composers say?<br/>        ...What was my last work?<br/>        ...the dictate of social structures<br/>        ...the influences of other arts<br/>        ...How much time do I have to write this thing?<br/>        ...that censor within the mind that says<br/>                &apos;Do not do that, it&apos;s derivative....<br/>                 Do not do that, it&apos;s out of style....<br/>                 Do not do that, it&apos;s vulgar.&apos;</p><p>...All of these things that I have mentioned do operate legitimately in<br/>every composer. The difference between a good and bad operation is only<br/>that proportion equivalent to unconscious versus conscious. It&apos;s all<br/>according to how blithely he decides he&apos;s going to put one of his<br/>principles into motion. If he doesn&apos;t decide anything, he&apos;s lucky. If he<br/>*has* to decide, then probably he&apos;s no composer at all.&quot;</p><p>&gt;From Leonard Berstein, &quot;The Infinite Variety of Music&quot;, Simon and Schuster,<br/>(c)1966, pp. 277-280.</p><p>I hope that you find this interesting and inspiring. I sure do.

As one example I arranged a piece, written for 12 celli by Sarah<br/>Hopkins, for nine horns and didjeridu.  The piece asks for harmonics in the<br/>last 3-4 minutes and in order to make it fit as well as I could into a<br/>concert of JI music I specified particular tunings for the earlier sections.<br/>This ended up much more specific than the composer had considered - not that<br/>she complained, however I went to more trouble than she thought necessary.</p><p>We have enough trouble playing in tune (not to mention in time) with each<br/>other that using the ears alone often does not do the trick.
