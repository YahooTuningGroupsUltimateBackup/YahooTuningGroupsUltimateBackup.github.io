This approach<br/>wasn&apos;t explored much in western music because the root for the major<br/>chord is also the same thing as the bottom note doubled down an<br/>octave. The same applies to the minor chord, which is generally heard<br/>as 3/2 with some weakly tonal inharmonic note in the middle. But when<br/>you&apos;re dealing with 5:6:7 as a tonal chord, to double the 5 down an<br/>octave makes the whole thing sound a lot more dissonant.</p><p>This is sort of an expansion on a technique I&apos;ve been using in<br/>12-equal harmony some time, which stems from Stravinsky&apos;s &quot;modal<br/>fields&quot; approach. Some day, when I have enough time to think like a<br/>normal person, I&apos;ll have to try to work some of this out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2011 7:32:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This might make sense in a sort of nonoctave approach, or where you<br/>&gt; use different scale in the bass than in the treble.

I don&apos;t see what you mean about the fifth vs third<br/>generator. I don&apos;t think you got my point about the 5:6:7 and the<br/>nonoctave scale.</p><p>If we&apos;re using 4:5:6, and if you naively double the bottom note down<br/>an octave, it makes sense because 4:5:6 is a rooted triad. Doubling<br/>the bottom note down an octave for 10:12:15 works as well because we<br/>hear the VF pop out for 10:12:15 as though it were a 3/2 with an extra<br/>note in there.</p><p>There&apos;s also that a minor chord, if you double the root down a bunch<br/>of times, might be more perceptually related to 16:19:24, because I&apos;d<br/>expect that 1:2:4:8:16:19:24 has a stronger field of attraction than<br/>5:10:20:40:80:96:120. This is just a conjecture, something to think<br/>about, something you&apos;ve no doubt heard a million times before on this<br/>list, and I&apos;m not going to argue it.</p><p>Either way, if you do that with 5:6:7, you end up with a much more<br/>dissonant chord than 5:6:7 alone.  If, instead of doubling the bottom<br/>note an octave, your approach to the bass is to play the note<br/>corresponding to the VF of each chord, and so treat the &quot;root&quot; of<br/>5:6:7 as 1, 2, and 4 instead of as 5, it ends up sounding more<br/>consonant.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2011 9:42:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having mentioned that Myna[7] has no tetrads, I thought I&apos;d better point out that it has other things going for it, and could be used as a septimal alternative to Meantone[7].</p><p>In case anyone wants to play with it:</p><p>! myna7opt.scl<br/>Lesfip version of 7-limit Myna[7]<br/>7<br/>!<br/>267.31590<br/>310.96887<br/>579.17475<br/>620.82525<br/>889.03113<br/>932.68410<br/>1200.0000</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2011 9:49:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>I was playing with it on Scala, and note it has perfectly good traditional note names which Scala doesn&apos;t default to, but set the notation scheme to P31 and you are in business: C D# Eb F# Gb A Bbb C.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2011 1:36:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 24 January 2011 05:56, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; That thar is a powerful lot of harmony packed into just seven notes, I reckon.

I&apos;d encountered this scale in 19-EDO before but never worked out the harmonic basis for it.  Though now that I think about it, I could see the 19-EDO as sort of a 13-limit version, supplanting 5:6:7 triads with 13:15:18 triads.  Not as smooth, but perhaps still usable.  I&apos;ll have to try it out.
