In many ways the two can appear to be the same thing.</p><p>When a &quot;mean&quot; tone was invented for keyboard modulatory reasons, it was as an<br/>intentional equal temperament bisecting of the major third interval.  The<br/>results accomplished in any meantone tuning was much more of an equalness in<br/>music than listeners of earlier periods of music had ever heard before.  And it<br/>was noticieable.  Each of the keys of any variant of meantone tuning has more of<br/>a sequence sounding follow up that one can associate with equalness.</p><p>ET is, in fact, eleventh comma meantone.  It exists for the same reason that<br/>all meantones exist, but it is less expensive in the number of notes needed<br/>for it to comply to created music.</p><p>Likewise (to it being a legitimate meantone tuning variant), ET is a tempered<br/>Pythagorean tuning.  The 2-cent difference in the &quot;perfect fifths&quot; points to<br/>this fact.</p><p>The changing of a composer&apos;s manuscript notation is insidious.  The result,<br/>however, is no different than mistreating a composer&apos;s intonation so that if<br/>fits into a modern ideology.  The performer&apos;s credo is to perform a composer&apos;s<br/>music with the best of the composer&apos;s intentions.  The care given to a<br/>composer&apos;s intonation has a bearing on tempo, phrasing, ornatmentation, vibrato,<br/>accents, mood, sentiments.</p><p>Unequalness makes for more interest in music because of what it stirs up.  It<br/>is a better metaphor for the overtone series, which is also unequal.<br/>Unequalness makes instruments ring more, especially harpsichords and organs.  And yet<br/>meantone is the necessary step to ET.</p><p>ET is descended directly from meantone, while well temperament was an off<br/>shoot of meantone that went into a different direction.  ET, once the theory that<br/>no one could hear right, has gained such hegemony that well temperament now<br/>appears most inscrutable.  The shoe is merely on the other foot.</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2005 12:21:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kraig,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; While i am sure there are<br/>&gt; part of Mahler that might<br/>&gt; fit into 31 ET i can assure<br/>&gt; you as someone who has<br/>&gt; immersed myself in it ,<br/>&gt; that he would be screaming<br/>&gt; for a good 9/8, especially<br/>&gt; in his brass melodies.<br/>&gt; And if one listens to the<br/>&gt; 4th movement of the 3rd<br/>&gt; symphony, this cannot exist<br/>&gt; with out a really good 9/8.</p><p>yes, i&apos;m sure Mahler relished the sound of a good 9/8 as much<br/>as any other listener. but Mahler himself said this:</p><p>&quot;The loss of ... distinctive key coloration, which<br/>transforms the fixed pitch music of this [earlier] period<br/>with subtle coloristic distinctions impossible to imagine<br/>until one has heard them, is the great loss we have<br/>suffered in changing from meantone to the equal intervals<br/>and indistinguishable keys of equal temperament.</p><p>[Peter Yates 1964, &quot;An Amateur at the Keyboard&quot;, p 60;<br/>quoted by Douglas Leedy in _Interval_ vol. 4 #1, winter 1982-83]</p><p>and since Mahler indicates that he himself had heard<br/>meantone, it was most likely Josef Petzval&apos;s lectures<br/>and demonstrations of 31-edo at the Vienna University.</p><p>&gt;  Also there is no reason to assume that a composer would<br/>&gt; hear the same tuning throughout an entire piece.

However, many of the 55-et<br/>pitches are as foreign to sixth comma meantone practice as can be.  The larger<br/>numbers are good for grouping meantone variants, as has been done since at<br/>least Saveur (who listed 31, 43, and 55).  But they seem misleading as to<br/>performance practice, which is my primary focus.</p><p>To a modern it may not be necessry to conform to a sixth comma variant of<br/>mentone, although it may be the historically appropriate variant.  They can opt<br/>for their own preferred aesthetic and not that of a long dead composer.  They<br/>might also make use in a modern composition of pitches from the larger set of<br/>meantone extension.  My work in presenting live performances of early music<br/>makes me more prudent.</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2005 8:30:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>&quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>&gt; &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And far from the gently<br/>&gt; &gt; undulating landscape of a<br/>&gt; &gt; well-temperament, when one<br/>&gt; &gt; departs from those central<br/>&gt; &gt; 6 majors and 3 minors in a<br/>&gt; &gt; typical meantone-12, one<br/>&gt; &gt; falls off a cliff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not really a cliff until<br/>&gt; you hit the wolf fifth, since<br/>&gt; the diminished fourth in the<br/>&gt; place of a major third sort<br/>&gt; of works, and an augmented<br/>&gt; second in place of a minor<br/>&gt; third is really pretty nice.<br/>&gt; We get just 7/6s for those<br/>&gt; with the (112/3)^(1/9) fifth,<br/>&gt; which is pretty close to 31<br/>&gt; and quite close to 81; in<br/>&gt; other words, in an optimal<br/>&gt; meantone region near 1/4 comma.</p><p>thank you both for your thoughts on this. it always bothered<br/>me that Mahler specifically cites meantone, but that his<br/>emphasis was on distinctive key coloration, which i have<br/>known all along implies a well-temperament.</p><p>however, a quick perusal of his symphonic scores shows him<br/>using both notes of an enharmonic pair in a relatively<br/>short time frame. if he really was thinking in terms of<br/>a 12-note tuning, whether well-tempered or meantone, he<br/>probably wouldn&apos;t have written it that way. so apparently<br/>he was thinking of real meantone, and one that extended<br/>beyond 12 notes. how far beyond, is a question that can<br/>only be answered by a close examination of not only his<br/>published scores, but also his manuscripts and sketches.</p><p>as i write on the &quot;Vienna&quot; webpage, it&apos;s easy to find<br/>double-sharps in Mahler&apos;s manuscripts which have been<br/>&quot;naturalized&quot; by his editors in the Critical Edition.<br/>given his favorable statement about meantone, i think<br/>a performance of such a passage should take his original<br/>notation into account and play the double-sharp at a<br/>lower pitch than the enharmonically equivalent natural.</p><p>Mahler&apos;s harmonic vocabulary was post-Wagnerian, and<br/>was certainly sophisticated enough to contain both<br/>diminished-4ths and augmented-2nds -- but one<br/>interesting point to note is that despite this<br/>sophistication, and as he himself admitted, the<br/>basis of his harmony was simple diatonicism, which<br/>again, i think, argues in favor of meantone.</p><p>perhaps Mahler knew the sound of 31-edo from Petzval&apos;s<br/>lectures, but was working with only a 19-tone subset<br/>of it, a la Mozart with 55-edo.</p><p>finally, perhaps Mahler got his history muddled.<br/>it&apos;s a possibility. but he did speak of &quot;subtle<br/>coloristic distinctions impossible to imagine until<br/>one has heard them&quot;, and i&apos;m sure he had a very fine<br/>ear for intonation.</p><p>also, i don&apos;t think he would have been so concerned<br/>with the sound of individual intervals, but rather<br/>the overall sound of a key or set of chords.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/25/2005 8:37:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/25/2005 11:32:33 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com">monz@tonalsoft.com</a> writes:<br/>also, i don&apos;t think he would have been so concerned<br/>with the sound of individual intervals, but rather<br/>the overall sound of a key or set of chords.<br/>Hi Monz,</p><p>Since Mahler is post-Wagner (who Joel Mandelbaum marks as ET), any move<br/>toward meantone would travel through sixth comma meantone notes in the direction<br/>toward quarter comma notes.
