Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2000 12:20:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and thanks to such contributors as Joe Monzo and Kraig<br/>Grady for reminding me that one danger of an &quot;historical disclaimer&quot;<br/>that one may possibly disclaim too much, and in an ethnocentric manner<br/>to boot.</p><p>When responding to a question whether Pythagorean intervals such as a<br/>major third a comma wider than the regular ditone at 81:64, and major<br/>sixth a comma wider than the regular 27:16 (respectively ~9:7 and<br/>~12:7) were used &quot;historically,&quot; I unreflectingly took the question to<br/>refer to medieval European practice.</p><p>While one can find these intervals, for example, in the 17-note<br/>Pythagorean keyboard octave of Gb-A# proposed by Prosdocimus of<br/>Beldemandis (1413) and Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1425-1440?) --<br/>e.g. G#-Gb (~7:4); D#-Gb (~7:6); Gb-A# (~9:7) -- I am not aware of any<br/>proposals suggesting that these intervals could be resolved in<br/>&quot;superefficient&quot; cadences (possibly of the kind advocated by<br/>Marchettus of Padua in 1318) to stable 3-limit intervals.</p><p>Xeno-Gothic tuning, practice, and theory, might be viewed in a sense<br/>as just such a project -- but as a further offshoot of actual Gothic<br/>theory, not as a reporting or restatement of that theory.</p><p>Having often discussed in this forum Marchettus and my Xeno-Gothic<br/>interpretation (only possible choice) of his cadential aesthetics,<br/>I felt a special responsibility to make this distinction between known<br/>medieval practice and theory, and &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; offshoots.</p><p>However, as I have now been very constructively reminded, &quot;historical&quot;<br/>uses of intervals are not a monopoly of European composed music: and<br/>the system of srutis in India, and 17-note systems in various Arabic<br/>and Persian traditions, for example, may indeed offer examples of<br/>7-limit intervals as well as 5-limit intervals derived from<br/>Pythagorean tuning in their schisma forms and eventually modified<br/>slightly to obtain simple 7-based ratios.</p><p>Since the 5-limit schisma (~1.95 cents) and septimal schisma (~3.80<br/>cents) are so small, this kind of modification might have no major<br/>musical impact, but could permit a &quot;neater&quot; theoretical scheme of<br/>ratios.</p><p>While I want to be cautious not to speak for Erv Wilson, who speaks<br/>most eloquently for himself, I might add that Erv has communicated to<br/>me his fascination for extended Pythagorean tunings documented or<br/>reasonably postulated for various world musical traditions. Thus I<br/>must confess cultural myopia, rather than mere invincible ignorance,<br/>as a flaw revealed by my overly sweeping disclaimer.</p><p>Please let me warmly send my greetings to Kraig Grady and the<br/>Anaphorians, whose territory in &quot;North America&quot; (or ?estom k&apos;awi, &quot;the<br/>Middle Land (or Continent,&quot; as I sometimes call it in an immigrant<br/>dialect of Nisenan, the indigenous language of my own territory,<br/>incidentally including &quot;South America&quot; also) I would take to include<br/>not only the USA but Canada and Mexico, the latter being also one of<br/>the nations of Erv Wilson.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=10624 href="#10624">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/14/2000 2:02:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Since the 5-limit schisma (~1.95 cents) and septimal schisma (~3.80<br/>&gt; cents) are so small, this kind of modification might have no major<br/>&gt; musical impact, but could permit a &quot;neater&quot; theoretical scheme of<br/>&gt; ratios.</p><p>Maybe this is a trivial point, but that&apos;s never stopped me before.  The<br/>septimal schisma of 3.8 cents is a fairly arbitrary interval.  Simpler<br/>ratios are 225/224 and 5120/5103, which are between 5 and 8 cents.  So<br/>7-limit intervals are not as well approximated by Pythagorean tuning as<br/>5-limit intervals are.  Although still well enough to be recognized and<br/>distinguished.</p><p>            Graham</p></div>
