I have to disagree with you that it is not a matter of<br/>belief. When you say: &quot;i found that after a few years there was something about<br/>the sound i did not like or was not doing what i wanted it to do,&quot; and &quot;On the other<br/>hand, those scales i have tuned in JI i have never tired of and they have remained<br/>an inspiration to use,&quot; how can you then say that this is not a subjective experience<br/>(i.e. personal belief, or personal reaction)?</p><p>What I object to so much (as I expressed in my essay) is exactly this notion that<br/>there are immutable facts about musical perception; that imagination, musical<br/>context, and cultural differences (and beliefs) are not important variables. Is this<br/>not a vastly more rigid, intolerant stance than the one I present in Part 1 of my<br/>paper? (If you&apos;ve seen it...) It seems like you&apos;d be a good spokesperson for the JI<br/>movement on this particular issue, and I&apos;m very curious to know what you&apos;d say to<br/>this question.</p><p>&gt;Most people who work in JI do so because of the sound not on any esoteric<br/>beliefs.

For instance the 40/27 is an interval i would never use as a<br/>consonance yet i find it exceptionally expressive. In fact the 80/27 I really like cause you end<br/>up with beating against the 3 partial of your lower note.<br/>If I worked in a tuning that  has a interval 2401/2400 off from a low integer ratio, I would<br/>rather exploits this uniqueness. When one interval beats in a tuning ,it helps define where you<br/>are hence less ambiguity in where you are. This is an aesthetic choice and not a theoretical<br/>universal answer for all. Interestingly you find  use of beats possibly in this spirit in<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s Mixtur and especially with the Russian national anthem (beginning of the 3rd region)<br/>in Hymnen. I tend to think they sound better acoustically produced though. The same would hold<br/>true of someone like Phil Niblock where the  precise control of beats becomes apart of the music.<br/>To temper out these would destroy what it is he is going after. So if maximizing consonaces over<br/>all else was what i was interested in, it might apply. As i have stated in myriad of posts, my<br/>interest is as much in structural integrity and unambiguity, the use of beats and compound beat<br/>patterns.</p><p>emotionaljourney22 wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello Paul!<br/>&gt; &gt;     It seems like that was what he was doing to me.

Who uses 270, 665 Et anyway, no one on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok -- but the et was not the real meat of gene&apos;s point. what he was<br/>&gt; getting at (to me, anyway, since i&apos;ve had far more contact with him<br/>&gt; than you have) was the possibilities opened up if you can absorb the<br/>&gt; 2401:2400 (and perhaps 4375:4374 too). doing so in an absolutely<br/>&gt; optimal way would result in a linear or planar temperament -- which<br/>&gt; like ji is open and infinite in general -- not an et. now it is true<br/>&gt; that for certain contrived values of the generators, you do get an<br/>&gt; et -- in this case, 612-equal -- and the infinite array of pitches<br/>&gt; collapses to a finite one. by expressing his result in terms of 612-<br/>&gt; equal, gene was able to get across, in as concise a manner as<br/>&gt; possible, what the pitches actually were. but any actual set of 612<br/>&gt; pitches is completely foreign to the problem at hand, which involved<br/>&gt; a scale with a very small number of pitches, so focusing on that<br/>&gt; aspect of it completely misses the point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if you&apos;re willing to accept errors of a full 2401:2400 (and/or<br/>&gt; 4375:4374), as gene pointed out in a later post, then you can exploit<br/>&gt; this idea in just intonation -- and it&apos;s one that you&apos;re likely to<br/>&gt; miss if you&apos;re focused only on the ratios themselves without an eye<br/>&gt; to the simpler ratios they approximate. however, if 2401:2400 is too<br/>&gt; large an error for John Doe&apos;s ears to accept, but a fraction of that<br/>&gt; error is OK, then a microtemperament may be of value to Mr. Doe. and<br/>&gt; 612-equal is only the easiest such microtemperament to name, not<br/>&gt; necessarily the best or most desirable such microtemperament.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=37576 href="#37576">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 12:25:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello Paul!<br/>&gt;     I quite understand what you are saying here but there are<br/>assumptions here that might work for<br/>&gt; what you do but not for me. For instance the 40/27 is an interval i<br/>would never use as a<br/>&gt; consonance yet i find it exceptionally expressive. In fact the<br/>80/27 I really like cause you end<br/>&gt; up with beating against the 3 partial of your lower note.<br/>&gt; If I worked in a tuning that  has a interval 2401/2400 off from a<br/>low integer ratio, I would<br/>&gt; rather exploits this uniqueness. When one interval beats in a<br/>tuning ,it helps define where you<br/>&gt; are hence less ambiguity in where you are. This is an aesthetic<br/>choice and not a theoretical<br/>&gt; universal answer for all.</p><p>thanks for your reply kraig. i appreciate your tone here (not to<br/>mention your content), and hope that we on this list will be<br/>enlightened enough to keep things at such a mature level of discourse.</p></div><h3><a id=37582 href="#37582">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 1:03:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As an attempt to begin a new thread along the lines of the old one,<br/>let&apos;s<br/>&gt; ask the question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; what scale or tuning do you consider (as a composer or theorist),<br/>offers you<br/>&gt; the most interesting potential,</p><p>right now, if i had to pick just one system that all my future<br/>compositions would have to be in, it would be 152-tone equal<br/>temperament. it&apos;s capable of approximating, well enough for my ears<br/>and for the rate at which my music moves, the majority of the<br/>tempered and just scales and adaptive tuning systems that i feel i<br/>can speak through. i doubt that this will prove much more than a<br/>theoretical curiosity, though, as neither a set of instruments nor a<br/>notation system designed for 152-equal seem practically<br/>feasible . . . though that would allow me to combine all my ideas in<br/>a single piece of music, should i wish to go that far . . .</p><p>&gt; and, perhaps, what techniques you use as a<br/>&gt; composer?</p><p>i composed a lot when i was in school but none of the compositions<br/>expressed &quot;me&quot; as well as my improvisations do. i decided to focus on<br/>the latter for a while. so these days, i&apos;m typically more of a &quot;jazz&quot;<br/>composer, in that i&apos;ll come up with the chord progression and often<br/>a &quot;head&quot; melody, and leave the rest up to the improvisors. often i&apos;ll<br/>improvise an entire piece on the spot, and have the other players<br/>simply listen and follow me -- this is related to composition because<br/>i do hear the music in my head first, a moment before i play it, and<br/>i shape the overall contour of the music to be as satisfying as i can<br/>for the alloted time period. perhaps when i turn 30 i&apos;ll try<br/>composing per se once again, and hopefully my experience will allow<br/>this to come out less &quot;rigid&quot; sounding than my schoolwork did.</p><p>i&apos;m presently wowing audiences with a new technique, which i&apos;ll keep<br/>a secret for now. the resulting music has a life of its own . . . i<br/>*don&apos;t* hear the notes in my head before i play them, and they come<br/>out in a dazzling dance, so it&apos;s a whole new learning experience.<br/>it&apos;s a sort of acoustic techno that uses, for the most part, this ji<br/>scale:</p><p>1/1 33/32 9/8 5/4 21/16 11/8 3/2 27/16 7/4 15/8 (2/1)</p></div><h3><a id=37584 href="#37584">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 1:18:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; what scale or tuning do you consider (as a composer or theorist), offers you<br/>&gt; the most interesting potential, and, perhaps, what techniques you use as a<br/>&gt; composer?</p><p>Carl&apos;s got an interesting collection going.
