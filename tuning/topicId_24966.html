She was a Renaissance Queen, a 6<br/>feet tall redhead who ate men for breakfast, a sort of Nicole Kidman<br/>with attitude. Anyway where I live in Jedburgh there&apos;s a house, more of<br/>a castle really, called Mary Queen of Scots&apos; House where she lived for a<br/>while until the vile English : - ) got their perfidious paws on her and<br/>relieved her of her finely shaped head. Recently a lock of her hair was<br/>found (nobody has asked how they know it&apos;s hers and more to the point<br/>nobody has asked which part of her body it came from) and there is to be<br/>a grand event in the House this Thursday the 14th June to inaugurate the<br/>lock of hair. All the important government and civic dignitaries will be<br/>there and they are to be entertained by listening to Renaissance lute<br/>music provided by - yes - your&apos;s truly! I got the gig and this could be<br/>the first time that real Renaissance lute music has been played in the<br/>House since the 16th century.</p><p>The point is that if I had bothered my *&amp;^% to do my research I reckon<br/>that I could have adopted an appropriate historical tuning and could<br/>have added even greater authenticity to the recital. Or if I had been<br/>brave enough I could have refretted my lute (a difficult job) and spiced<br/>up the Fantasias of Luis Milan and the Ricercars of Francesco da Milano<br/>with 7 limit harmonies.</p><p>I have at least two more &apos;historical&apos; performances this summer, both in<br/>medieval Abbeys (sacked by those dreadful English again) so if anyone<br/>has concrete information on successful Renaissance lute<br/>other-than-12-tunings I&apos;d be grateful for a lead.</p><p>Thanks in anticipation,</p><p>Regards.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/12/2001 5:04:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/12/01 5:37:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; I have at least two more &apos;historical&apos; performances this summer, both in<br/>&gt; medieval Abbeys (sacked by those dreadful English again) so if anyone<br/>&gt; has concrete information on successful Renaissance lute<br/>&gt; other-than-12-tunings I&apos;d be grateful for a lead.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Alison, may I recommend John Dowland&apos;s tuning which is a well-temperament as<br/>reported by his son Robert.

I live in the<br/>Scottish Borders and Sir Walter Scott the writer claimed that more<br/>ballads have been written about this area than anywhere else in the<br/>world. The place is reeking with history, not all of it pretty. Some of<br/>your Presidents (I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re American - forgive me if I&apos;m wrong)<br/>like Nixon and LBJ carry names that are still big down here. The point<br/>I&apos;m making is that there is a vast resource of great depth for a<br/>composer.</p><p>I recently met with the Traditional Arts Officer for the region who has<br/>the job of promoting traditional song and music. She wants to put<br/>together a reasonably proficient female voices choir made up of the<br/>better young singers who are specialising in voice. Always on the look<br/>out for commissions I&apos;ve offered my services as a composer and the great<br/>Ballads naturally come to mind. My idea is to get down to the original<br/>tunes as far as possible and to harmonise sparingly and modally<br/>(sneaking in as much microtonal content as I can get off with) and using<br/>the lyrics to structure the pieces. There&apos;s the full range of material<br/>from love songs to war songs. So thanks for these references as they<br/>might help me with background. BTW Kate Rusby is making big waves in the<br/>traditional song department over here. I&apos;d recommend any of her recent<br/>work.</p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 12:08:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alison, may I recommend John Dowland&apos;s tuning which is a well-<br/>temperament as<br/>&gt; reported by his son Robert.
