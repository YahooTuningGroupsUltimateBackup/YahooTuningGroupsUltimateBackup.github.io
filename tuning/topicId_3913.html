(If anyone needs advice on how to get two</p><p>pianos to be a reliable quarter-tone apart and don&apos;t already know a<br/>reference for same, I can tell you how.)<br/>Possibly, the most extravagant temperament accomplishment I witnessed<br/>was<br/>when Pietro Grossi, who taught at Indiana in 1966, proudly demonstrated<br/>to<br/>us his 118-tone-per-octave  equal temperament. I also had the fun of<br/>playing<br/>on a sort of square piano with normally spaced keys, 96 of them covering<br/>an<br/>octave.

Of course, ya gotta start by having a well-tuned<br/>piano at standard pitch in order to make oral comparissons. First, I tune<br/>the C on the &quot;flat&quot; piano so that it beats _just perceptibly slower with the<br/>B on the standard-pitch (sp) piano than with the latter&apos;s C. Then I tune a<br/>normal 12-tet, bearing in mind that all the intervals should beat an iota<br/>slower on the &quot;qt&quot; piano. Now comes the fun oral test.<br/>On the sp piano you play an ascending chromatic sequence of falling major<br/>seconds: d-c e flat-d-flat, e-d, etc. Simultaneously, on the qt piano, you<br/>play an ascending chromatic sequence of rising minor thirds: c-e flat, c<br/>sharp-e, d-f, etc. If you got the two pianos spaced right, you&apos;ll hear this<br/>unmistakably consisten interval, five quarter-tones wide, ascending by<br/>quarter-tones. The stereo effect of the two pianos provides an odd sorta<br/>focus that makes wee variations very obvious.<br/>Of course, you tune just one octave&apos;s worth for this test and, once you&apos;ve<br/>at least hit the ball park, you crank the octave on the qt piano down five<br/>or six hertz so that, when you finish lowering the pitch in the rough<br/>tuning, the thing will be within striking distance of the needed pitch.<br/>As to Carillo&apos;s music, when I was at Indiana U. in Bloomington in the late<br/>&apos;60&apos;s, there was a well-stocked Latin American Music Center supervised by<br/>the composer, Juan Orrego-Sallas. They had tons of his stuff in their tape<br/>library. I&apos;d start looking there although no doubt, things have changed over<br/>the years.<br/>Nonesuch Records put out a recording of his Mass for Pope John XXIII in the<br/>&apos;70&apos;s. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s been reissued on CD, but I&apos;d be glad to sendja a<br/>tape of it. To hear a chorus tackle music in 1/6th tone temperament is truly<br/>awesome, and the work is certainly powerful.<br/> At 12:40 PM 7/10/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: Rick Tagawa &lt;<a href="mailto:ricktagawa@earthlink.net">ricktagawa@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: [tuning] new temperament on the cyberblock<br/>&gt;Date: Sat, 3 Jul 1999 17:13:16 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;From: Jay Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:jaywill@utah-inter.net">jaywill@utah-inter.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dear Jay,<br/>&gt;I would like to take you up on your offer of advice for tuning pianos a<br/>&gt;quarter tone apart.

There was<br/>also a Philips LP featuring a Piano Concerto in 1/3 tones (18 ET)<br/>and the remarkable Preludio a Cristobol Colon composed in the<br/>1920s and featuring instruments capable of increments up to 1/16<br/>tones (96 ET).  Eleven years ago at the Ricordi Store in Mexico<br/>City DF, I picked up a bunch of locally-produced cassettes<br/>featuring many other works of his, among them a very impressive<br/>1/4 tone string quartet and an earth shattering work called<br/>Balbuceos for orchestra (in 12 ET) and 96-tone piano soloist.  The<br/>whole piano does not even reach an octave!!

Carillo was a<br/>Mexican composer who worked in a variety of equal divisions of the<br/>semitone. His first experiments with quartertones were back in 1895, I<br/>think, making him one of the earliest modern microtonal composers. He wrote<br/>for a variety of microtonal harps, guitars, and other fixed-pitch<br/>instruments in addition to writing for microtonal voice and unfretted<br/>strings. Towards the end of his life, a European company manufactured a<br/>series of pianos from 24 to 96TET for him, though I don&apos;t know what<br/>happened to them. He wrote some theoretical works, but I don&apos;t know if<br/>they&apos;ve ever been translated to English.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
