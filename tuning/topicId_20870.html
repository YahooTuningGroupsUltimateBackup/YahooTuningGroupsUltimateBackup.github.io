This is lighter, more airy, than Metamorphose (which for me is<br/>like the spirit of thunder).</p><p>best wishes to all of you<br/>Lawrence Ball</p><p>1)Transmigrations Of The Inner Light<br/>This has a soaring sense of lightness, yet very earthed and solid.<br/>There are 8 and 16 beat cycles although they are handled in interesting ways<br/>that sound like 7, 9 or 13. The transitions and discontinuities are very<br/>appropriate and magically done. The rhythmic flow, momentum and precision<br/>feel of timimg is excellent.<br/>This signifies a new anthem or heralding of psychic-energetic-expression of<br/>ancient and contemporary music. Ecstatically innovative.<br/>My feeling for the tonality is that my ears constantly yearn to hear, and<br/>are thwarted from hearing, more familiar whole number ratios and this is<br/>like a kind of aural retuning of the mental gauge and palette.<br/>The bass drum permeates the texture beautifully. An incredible sandwich of<br/>energies. The vocal melody echo at the end is exhilirating.</p><p>2) Galunlati<br/>Jacky&apos;s original sounds, long, nasal, eerily broad in scope are majestic and<br/>processional. A hothouse of exotic timbral flowers and plants. A magnetic<br/>garden for crystallisation of inspired and super-mundane thoughts. Like<br/>peering into teeming convoluted green shoots and folds of rare and huge<br/>blossoms and plant forms.<br/>Not so much music as usually known, as an ornate arrangement of exquisite<br/>aural colours and forms. Its hard to believe so much variety of texture and<br/>melodic colour are possible.<br/>A sea of floating voices and energies that evokes a really clear spirit.<br/>Gongs and metallophones give everything a wonderful sheen, so so airy and<br/>light permeated.</p><p>3) Quest For Pure Metals<br/>Before the rhythms begin, this is a place in an invisible world, not simply<br/>sounds. Voices are awesome in expression...  slow background harmonies are<br/>far richer than they appear at first, a very ancestral/ceremonial energy.</p><p>4)Clouds Of Remembrance<br/>Percussion oceans - whole spherical time wheels of pure energetic momentum -<br/>oceans that modulate and articulate murmurs of real presence and being.<br/>Solid and powerfully speaking of dream spirit. A joyful tree full of music.<br/>Deep rooted sounds.<br/>Its strangely beautiful to hear bells and gongs to percussion, wind and<br/>synth textures. A new science here of orchestral logistics which Jacky<br/>navigates capably. Bell motifs and synth sounds make a beautiful coda.</p><p>5)Ten Thousand Things<br/>Spoken/sung seas of layers - even more layers here - reinvents the word<br/>multi track! Seas of light heard VIA sound, anchored into joyful wheels of<br/>rhythmic drums and metal instruments. Textures compounded from drums, gongs,<br/>metallophones into glorious dialogue. A mass of sound, transparent carpets<br/>of interpermeating designs. Fascinating afterglow-acoustic and psychic.</p></div><h3><a id=20901 href="#20901">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

Like everything I&apos;ve heard from Jacky, it is<br/>astounding.  As a recording engineer, I can vouch for the richness of sound texture.  I don&apos;t know<br/>when I&apos;ve heard a record that took advantage of the full spectrum of human hearing as effectively<br/>Galunlati does.  On first listening, I was drawn too far into the imaginative realm to give it much<br/>analytical attention.  But on the second listening one of the first things I noticed was that I was<br/>not being assaulted by the irritating wall of upper midrange sound usual in most modern recordings.</p><p>Jacky controls the sound with expert artistry.  The mix of acoustic and electronic instruments is<br/>natural and believable, and maintains the strengths of each.  The sounds are mostly unusual, often<br/>surprising, always well suited to their part.  The variety of tonal color is extremely broad without<br/>being gaudy or ostentatious.</p><p>One of his trademarks, at least on this record, is the way sections and phrases come and go in a<br/>precisely demarked fashion.  It&apos;s hard to describe it clearly because I don&apos;t know of anything to<br/>compare it to.  The feeling is of being drawn along in a vehicle of some sort, which periodic makes<br/>smooth, brief halts and restarts.  It&apos;s an arresting feeling but a good one, a little bit like an<br/>amusement ride (although I almost hate to say it that way because it cheapens it).</p><p>This music is at once ancient and modern, in the best senses of both.</p><p>&gt; A joyful tree full of music.</p><p>Are you kidding?  It&apos;s a whole dang forest! :-)</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Be sure to listen to this CD on a sound system that can support<br/>extreme low end.  Jacky makes extensive, expressive use of the 20-60<br/>Hz range, which requires a subwoofer to reproduce properly unless your<br/>listening room is carefully tuned to your speakers.  This is not the<br/>sort of record you can get full benefit from by listening only in your<br/>car!</p><p>--<br/>David J.
