I mean, who really knows why, but it is very interesting to me how the D# at 318 cents, and the Fb at 384 seemed to be generally overlooked in European tuning systems over the years. Yes, their ratios were pretty high up there, but in purely practical terms, since they are only 2 cents off the simple 6/5 and 5/4 ratios, it seems to me that these notes would have been sought after more. Two cents, when playing a guitar, for instance, is absolutely a non existant interval...the pitch on a guitar string changes just by the amount of pressure one puts when their finger presses down, so perhaps theoretically, 2 cents is meaningful, but not when one is actually playing.<br/>  And I know European musicians used the keyboard as a standard for tuning, overall, but even there 2 cents is nothing. I&apos;ve often read that there is a deviation of several cents for most any acoustic instrument, so being precisely &quot;in tune&quot; is most likely impossible. Room temperature alone can make any acoustic axe go in and out of tune pretty easily. So, most ANY tuning is theoretical in that sense, you just get as close as you can at the moment, and hope it stays there. When I do clasical guitar gigs, I constantly need to retune, so while I&apos;m playing, the pitch of my notes is often not exactly at a precise eq temp. I guess this isn&apos;t exactly news that will change the world, but it points up the difference between intellectual theory, and actual playing, in a simple way.<br/>  And, it&apos;s interesting...with fixed pitch instruments, like keyboards or the guitar family, it&apos;s very difficult, if not impossible, to adjust pitch while playing, whereas ouds, sarods, and violins can be tweaked while playing, just by the feel of where one puts their finger. The longer I study tuning theory, the deeper it gets, you won&apos;t get bored in this field....best...HHH</p></div><h3><a id=63582 href="#63582">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2006 11:41:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Yes, their ratios were pretty high up there,<br/>&gt; but in purely practical terms, since they are only 2 cents off the<br/>simple<br/>&gt; 6/5 and 5/4 ratios, it seems to me that these notes would have been<br/>sought<br/>&gt; after more.</p><p>How many notes to an octave do you regard as practical on a guitar?<br/>One way of doing this system is to use 53 equal, but that&apos;s a lot of<br/>notes.</p></div><h3><a id=63584 href="#63584">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2006 12:08:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 1/22/06, Gene Ward Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, their ratios were pretty high up there,<br/>&gt; &gt; but in purely practical terms, since they are only 2 cents off the<br/>&gt; simple<br/>&gt; &gt; 6/5 and 5/4 ratios, it seems to me that these notes would have been<br/>&gt; sought<br/>&gt; &gt; after more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How many notes to an octave do you regard as practical on a guitar?<br/>&gt; One way of doing this system is to use 53 equal, but that&apos;s a lot of<br/>&gt; notes.</p><p>Yes, this is the main problem.
