After I&apos;d written the E-mail to her, it occurred<br/>to me to post the part about the testing I&apos;d done here.  The work<br/>is still in progress, and the i&apos;s haven&apos;t all been dotted nor the<br/>t&apos;s all crossed.  Although my sample sizes tended to be small, some<br/>tests for statistical significance - e.g., existence of a correlation<br/>between pitch acuity and degree of preference for just intonation for<br/>the 12 and 13 year olds came out significant at the - I believe -<br/>one percent level.  Quite frequently, preference for just or equal<br/>temperament<br/>versions depended upon which of the two versions had a wider melodic<br/>interval at some point of emphasis in the phrase - e.g. a phrase<br/>containing a prominent melodic drop of a minor third would tend to<br/>be preferred more in the just version (m3 wider in just), while<br/>a phrase with an emphasized step up from a fifth to a major sixth<br/>above a root note would have a tendency to be preferred in the<br/>equal temperament version as sounding more expressive or emotional.<br/>The test results taught me a lot, and I hope to publicize them in<br/>a tidied up form.  If someone were planning to embark on a major<br/>study in the area of tuning preferences, the experiences derived<br/>from the work I did at Florida State might be useful towards<br/>designing the study.</p><p>    One serious problem with testing groups of listeners in a<br/>classroom setting is that there is the possibility that one individual&apos;s<br/>subtle reactions of liking or dislike for a particular example<br/>version might be picked up by others - perhaps subliminally -<br/>and influence their reactions to the examples.  I was not present<br/>in person during the testing, but those who gave the tests at<br/>Florida State were aware of this possible interfering factor and<br/>tried to conduct the tests in such a way that the listeners<br/>understood that they were to avoid talking or doing anything<br/>which could disturb the others taking the test.</p><p>    Here&apos;s what I wrote to my daughter:</p><p>    In 1997 and 1998 I gave - sent cassettes and then in 1998<br/>CDs - listening tests to about 300 music &quot;campers&quot; and incoming<br/>students.</p><p>    (They had summer music camps at Florida State<br/>in which high school students from all over Florida would come and<br/>spend two weeks there taking an intensive series of individual<br/>and group lessons in their musical instrument and take part in<br/>a musical performance together with other campers at the end<br/>of their time at FSU)</p><p>    In the tests I asked about their preferences between<br/>different tuning versions of brief musical phrases.  You would<br/>have to see it to believe it!  The reactions of different listeners<br/>to the comparisons were so different!  What one person thought<br/>sounded beautiful another thought sounded terrible!  Then I&apos;ve found<br/>that most people, whatever preferences they have, find it hard to<br/>believe that many others respond to sounds very differently<br/>than they do.</p><p>    I believe that both &quot;genes&quot; and musical listening experience<br/>are very important as to the way we respond to different musical<br/>sounds and different kinds of music.  Some groups I tested were<br/>adolescents ranging in age from 12 to 18, and there were some<br/>interesting relationships.  As you would expect, there was some<br/>increase in pitch acuity with age - especially between about 12<br/>and 15 - very slight change after that.  I found that among the<br/>youngest ones - 12 years old - those who had the greatest acuity<br/>for detecting pitch differences had a strong tendency to also<br/>prefer the just intonation versions of comparison examples, while<br/>those with the least pitch acuity heavily favored the equal<br/>temperament versions.  There was the same trend among the 13 year<br/>olds, but it wasn&apos;t as pronounced, and I didn&apos;t see much of<br/>any clear cut trend in this direction among the older ones.  The<br/>older ones generally had had more musical training than the<br/>younger ones, and I believe that as equal temperament is used<br/>as a standard in most music education (brass is an exception),<br/>as the young musicians get more training and experience in<br/>equal temperament, an innate inclination towards just intonation<br/>of those with such a high level of pitch acuity as to make the<br/>different tunings really sound a lot different to them becomes<br/>increasingly replaced by a learned preference for equal temperament<br/>as a result of more musical training in equal temperament music.<br/>But the story is more complicated than that - all sorts of variation!<br/>In some cases, at the beginning of the test a listener would consistently<br/>prefer one version and then suddenly switch and prefer the opposite<br/>version.</p><p>    I hope this post contributes constructively.</p><p>    Dave Hill,   Borrego Springs, CA</p></div>
