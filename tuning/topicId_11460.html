Joe has written a book, &quot;Preliminary<br/>Studies<br/>in the Virtual Pitch Continuum&quot; which contains exercises for playing/<br/>singing the various 72-tET intervals. He makes no attempt to classify<br/>them by consonance -- to him, Schoenberg emancipated the dissonances,<br/>and Maneri is just emancipating more of them. Joe teaches 72-tET ear-<br/>training at New England Conservatory using a 72-tET keyboard that he<br/>obtained (but didn&apos;t make). It has a very annoying timbre but has<br/>served to train many Boston microtonal musicians. Joe&apos;s violininst<br/>son<br/>Mat and keyboardist Steve Lantner made a CD (which I just got a copy<br/>of) in which Steve uses 36-tET, a subset of 72-tET, and the playing<br/>is<br/>primarily in an atonal language. Joe himself has several CDs<br/>available, though I don&apos;t own any of them. I met Joe at a Boston<br/>Microtonal Society meeting and he is a very warm fellow. I&apos;ve heard<br/>him play the clarinet and he seems less concerned with finding any<br/>nice scales within 72-tET than in bringing the maximum amount of<br/>color<br/>into his jazzy improvisations.</p><p>By contrast, Joe&apos;s friend, Boston composer Ezra Sims, uses 72-tET for<br/>its excellent approximations to harmonic intervals (it makes no<br/>errors<br/>greater than 4 cents in the 11-odd-limit, and is consistent though<br/>the<br/>17-odd-limit, though Sims tries to imply much higher harmonics<br/>through<br/>his 72-tone notation).</p></div><h3><a id=11471 href="#11471">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2000 2:06:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>P.S. Steve Lantner is an incredible jazz keyboardist as well as an<br/>incredible Maneri-microtonal modern-classical keyboardist. I&apos;ll have<br/>to ask him on Thursday (when his jazz/funk band plays) if he&apos;s ever<br/>done anything he&apos;d consider &quot;microtonal jazz&quot;. By the way, I noticed<br/>that my 22-tET piece &quot;TIBIA&quot; was classified as &quot;General Jazz&quot; by<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.

I was a student of joe&apos;s. To get his book &quot;prelimanary studies in the<br/>virtual pitch continuum&quot; contact &quot;the boston microtonal society, 7 maple lane, framingham, ma<br/>01701&apos;. write the letter to joe and tell him i referred you. it&apos;s a good book to learn the<br/>72et with simple excercises to hear the intervals. It&apos;s set up like a shoenberg method with<br/>the notes set up in different kind of rows to compose from. you don&apos;t have to follow that<br/>compositionally. but it&apos;s a good learning process. You can also use ezra simm&apos;s method, the<br/>originater of the 72 et system, which is closer to just but not exact. Once you get the book,<br/>i could send you ezra&apos;s formation of the19 note scale in 72et.</p><p>As for the keyboard, it&apos;s a big box with round buttons. It&apos;s much better for learning than<br/>playing pieces upon. But things might have changed, so ask.</p><p>I hope this helps and if you want, you can always contact me off list.</p><p>al giusto</p><p>Alexandros Papadopoulos wrote:</p><p>&gt; Does anybody have information on Joe Manieri and his 72tone tuning?<br/>&gt; I also read that he has made a microtonal keyboard.<br/>&gt; Thanks<br/>&gt;       Alex<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
