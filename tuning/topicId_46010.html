What the nature of consonance is.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Although the sense of hearing recognizes consonances,<br/>&gt;&gt; reason weighs their value.  When two strings, one of which<br/>&gt;&gt; is lower, are stretched and struck at the same time,<br/>&gt;&gt; and they produce, so to speak, an intermingled and sweet sound,<br/>&gt;&gt; and the two pitches coalesce into one as if linked together,<br/>&gt;&gt; then that which is called &quot;consonance&quot; occurs.  When,<br/>&gt;&gt; on the other hand, they are struck at the same time<br/>&gt;&gt; and each desires to go its own way, and they do not<br/>&gt;&gt; bring together a sweet sound in the ear, a single sound<br/>&gt;&gt; composed of two, then this is what is called &quot;dissonance&quot;.</p><p>In a footnote, Bower [p 47, footnote 130] says:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Compare this definition of consonance (and dissonance)<br/>&gt;&gt; with Nocomachus Enchiridion 12 (JanS. 262.1-6);<br/>&gt;&gt; an important element in these definitions [by Boethius]<br/>&gt;&gt; and those found in Nicomachus is the phrase<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;struck at the same time&quot; (_simul pulsae_, a translation<br/>&gt;&gt; of the Greek _[h]ana xrousthentes_). ...&quot;</p><p>here is the passage from Nicomachus (c. 100 AD), chapter 12:</p><p>&gt;&gt; A system is a combination of two or more intervals.<br/>&gt;&gt; But no note among the intervals is consonant with<br/>&gt;&gt; the one immediately following it, but is completely<br/>&gt;&gt; dissonant with it.  Among the systems, however,<br/>&gt;&gt; some are consonat, others dissonant.  Systems are consonant<br/>&gt;&gt; when the notes comprising them, though they be different<br/>&gt;&gt; in compass, commingle with one another when played together<br/>&gt;&gt; or are somehow sounded simultaneously, in such a way that<br/>&gt;&gt; the sound produced from them is of a oneness like<br/>&gt;&gt; a single voice.  Notes are dissonant, however, when<br/>&gt;&gt; the sound emanating from both of them is heard to be<br/>&gt;&gt; disparate in some way and unblended.</p><p>Boethius _De institutione musica_, 4.1 [near the end]</p><p>LATIN<br/><a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS4_TEXT.html">http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS4_TEXT.html</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; Consonae quidem sunt, quae simul pulsae suavem<br/>&gt;&gt; permixtumque inter se coniungunt sonum.

You see some in the table I linked<br/>&gt; to above.</p><p>Not sure what you mean; but, anyway, my &quot;starting point&quot; for working with temperaments always was one particular comma which I wanted to vanish (i.e. to be &quot;tempered out&quot;). If the comma in question is 2-dimmensional (i.e. its factor contains 2 different prime numbers -- like 2 and 3, for example, or 3 and 5), then this gives you an equal temperament. A good example is 12-equal, where the comma to vanish is the Pyth. comma (i.e. 3^12 / 2^19), which means you go 12 steps to map the 2/1 and you go 19 steps to map the 3/1. If the comma is 3-dimmensional (i.e. the factor contains three different primes), this gives you a 2D (or &quot;regular&quot;) temperament, where you use two intervals (one called the &quot;period&quot; and the other called the &quot;generator&quot;) to map the target ones. For example, the syntonic comma (which is usually viewed as the distance between a Pythagorean third and a pure third) has a factor of &quot;3^4 / 2^4 / 5&quot;, which can also be written as &quot;(3/2)^4 / 5&quot;. This tells you that if you want the syntonic comma to vanish in your temperament, the interval you use to approximate 5/1 will be exactly 4 times larger than the one for approximating 3/2. And because the lowest prime in the factor is 2, this eventually tells you that the &quot;period&quot; of the temperament is an octave and the generator is a fifth and that you can approximate a pure major third by taking 4 fifths and subtracting 2 octaves. In fact, this is the mapping for the meantone temperament; and a good example is the &quot;quarter-comma meantone&quot;, where the period is a pure octave and the generator is a fifth of ~696.5 cents, so that the major third really is pure there. -- Further more, if, instead of choosing one comma, you choose two 3D commas to vanish and their factors both contain the same primes, then you get an equal temperament. For example, let&apos;s say we want to find a temperament where not only the syntonic comma vanishes but where also the schisma vanishes. The factor for the schisma is &quot;3^8 / 2^15 * 5&quot;, which means we are comparing a chain of 8 fourths to a pure major third plus 3 octaves. If you then try to make a mapping where the schisma and the syntonic comma both turn into unison, you get 12-equal.</p><p>BTW: You can also make 3D temperaments by tempering out a 4D comma, which often results in less mistuning. Again, if you tak&eacute; two 4D commas as your starting point, you get a 2D temperament. And if you tak&eacute; three 4D commas which you want to be tempered out, you get an equal temperament.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;ve only shown two examples here but there are lots and lots of other commas you can use. And if you do, soon you&apos;ll realize that there are temperaments with other generators than fifths, fourths, or major or minor seconds. What I think illustrates this nicely is, among others, the &quot;semisixth&quot; temperament (sometimes called &quot;sensipent&quot;), which uses a generator of about 443 cents.</p><p>PS: Before some of the other &quot;temperament makers&quot; lay into me, I should probably note that it&apos;s usually better to write the factors as prime space coordinates to list the exponents in a consistent order (i.e. the syntonic comma is &quot;-4  4 -1) and the schisma is &quot;-15   8   1&quot;.</p><p>Also, some people like to use a fourth as a meantone generator instead of a fifth.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=80424 href="#80424">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2009 1:50:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are tools to answer this question, which have uncovered<br/>&gt; &gt; a whole universe of temperaments, which Petr can tell you about<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps more easily than I.
