Have you already done this or was your example below<br/>&gt; hard-coded?  Some of the terms will be multi-word.  Can you handle that?<br/>&gt; This is not a 100% solution but will be pretty good.</p><p>My example is hard coded as you put it. When you write the entry<br/>you include the url to the relevant encyclopedia entry.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Well if Joe wanted to do it all of course,<br/>&gt; &gt; but it is such a big undertaking...</p><p>&gt; The encyclopedia is already close to having a short definition at the top<br/>&gt; for many words, and perhaps that case could be recognized and the content<br/>&gt; incorporated in the filtering process.</p><p>I thought of that, but no, it doesn&apos;t work. Well some of them could almost be used as a<br/>dictionary if a bit too wordy for such, but some just won&apos;t work at alll.<br/>Let&apos;s see if I can explain better with some examples.</p><p>Look at this one for example:</p><p>Aeolian:<br/>One of the standard Western modes. The name &quot;aeolian&quot; was not used by the ancient Greeks , and so it originated with medieval<br/>theorists who misunderstood the Greek treatises.</p><p>The diatonic genus of the aeolian mode equates to the &quot;8ve&quot;-species from A to A, in ascending order thus (&quot;t&quot; means &quot;tone&quot; in the<br/>sense of &quot;whole-tone&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; means semitone):</p><p>A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A<br/> t  s  t  t  s  t  t</p><p>That&apos;s fine for a first paragraph of an encyclopedia but it is no good<br/>at all for a dictionary. There would be really no point in putting<br/>those first two paragraphs into a little window frame in the archive<br/>- the diagram would be out of sight - and the user would need to<br/>scroll down a couple of paragraphs - or better - open<br/>up the complete page to find out what an Aeolian mode is if they don&apos;t<br/>know it already.</p><p>Extracting a dictionary type entry from the same page:</p><p>Aeolian:<br/>Natural minor scale. Example: A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A, steps: t s t t s t t (t = tone, s = semitone)</p><p>Do you see how it is a different format - encyclopedias are no good<br/>as dictionaries because they aren&apos;t written as such. If you<br/>want to know the meaning of a word you look up a dictionary.<br/>If you want to know more about it and want to explore it in<br/>depth, you look up an encyclopedia.</p><p>This isn&apos;t a criticism of the encyclopedia<br/>- you simply don&apos;t expect to be able to<br/>use encyclopedias to look up the<br/>meanings of words. You have to do it that way right now.<br/>but a dictionary would make everything much easier.</p><p>Similarly</p><p>Diesis:</p><p>Diesis is a term which has been used so variously at different times in history that it requires 7 separate definitions here.</p><p>When the term is unqualified, it generally is meant to refer to the ratio 128:125 = [2 3 5]^[7 0 -3] = ~41.05885841 (~411/17) cents,<br/>as described in definition #4 below.<br/>...</p><p>Extracting a dictionary type definition:</p><p>Diesis:<br/>Usually 125/128 - the interval between 2/1 and (5/4) * (5/4) * (5/4).</p><p>More generally, a small interval of about a quarter tone between low number ratios or products of ratios such as the undecimal<br/>diesis 33/32, which is the interval between 11/8 and 4/3.</p><p>This one is more like a dictionary entry already but too loquacious for such:</p><p>Accidental:</p><p>A symbol placed before a note-head in musical notation, or after a letter-name in a text description, which indicates some<br/>intonational change or adjustment relative to the tuning of the plain note or letter-name. The name &quot;accidental&quot; is derived from the<br/>fact that these notes are felt to lie outside the regular diatonic scale.</p><p>The standard musical accidentals are:</p><p>symbol   name           effect</p><p>  #   sharp         raise 1 semitone<br/>  b   flat          lower 1 semitone<br/>  x   double-sharp  raise 2 semitones (sometimes written ##)<br/>  bb  double-flat   lower 2 semitones</p><p>There is also a &quot;natural&quot;, which cancels the effect of a previously given accidental, whether that accidental occurs in a particular<br/>instance or in the key-signature.</p><p>Accidental:</p><p>Symbol used to modify pitch. Normally # raises the pitch by a semitone and b lowers it<br/>x or ## = double sharp, bb = double flat. A natural cancels the effect of the<br/>previous accidental. Many microtonal accidentals - see  encyclopedia.</p><p>Except, if we assume that the reader already knows about<br/>music notation as is rather reasonable for a reader<br/>of the tuning list, it might be better as:</p><p>Accidental:<br/>Symbol used to modify pitch such as # or b.<br/>Two versions of sixth tone notation are in use:<br/>                +   -  ++  -- +++ ---<br/>Maneri / Sims:  ^   v   &gt;  &lt;  ]   [<br/>HEWM (newest):  -   +   &lt;  &gt;  v   ^</p><p>The recent Saggital system is designed for use with any<br/>tuning. Many other notations in common use for<br/>various tunings - see the &lt;SCALA help&gt; for<br/>the most comprehensive list available.</p><p>Well - that is already rather long for a dictionary<br/>entry - maybe it can be made a bit shorter<br/>with some more work (it has already taken me half<br/>an hour or so to write to get it down to as<br/>few words as that).</p><p>If the user needs to scroll down, but only by one<br/>paragraph (or to resize the definition window to<br/>show another paragraph) it may still be acceptable.<br/>Some just can&apos;t be done in two sentences, but<br/>where possible they should and not more than<br/>four or five as the upper limit.</p><p>Anyway - do you see now why I think a dictionary is a different beast.</p><p>It would be useful for Monz&apos;s encyclopedia too - I know the entries are<br/>all cross-linked, but if you try and read it that way you<br/>end up going down and down through maybe two or three nesting levels<br/>to find out what something means, then you keep going back up and<br/>down again so it takes a while to read a topic if you aren&apos;t<br/>famliar with its terms yet.</p><p>So, if one had a dictionary to hand as well then it would be<br/>a much faster read.</p><p>Once you know what an Aeolian mode is, or what a diesis is,<br/>if you want to follow it up further you can then click<br/>on the link at the end of the dictionary entry to get<br/>to the encyclopedia, or other links if the author<br/>of the entry mentions other pages as well<br/>- no reason why it should only link to<br/>the encyclopedia for every single entry<br/>though it makes sense to link to it when<br/>there is an encyclopedia entry available or<br/>the term.</p><p>Do you see now why I feel a dictionary is needed<br/>in addition to an encyclopedia?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=54824 href="#54824">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2004 5:12:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Sorry should be:</p><p>&quot;<br/>Accidental:<br/>Symbol used to modify pitch such as # or b.<br/>Two versions of sixth tone notation are in common use:<br/>                +   -  ++  -- +++ ---<br/>Maneri / Sims:  ^   v   &gt;  &lt;  ]   [<br/>HEWM (newest):  +   -   &gt;  &lt;  ^   v</p><p>The recent Saggital system is designed for use with any<br/>tuning.

With the encyclopedia being the only thing going,<br/>float-over followed by click is less accessible than simply a click, and so<br/>I&apos;d vote for eliminating the extra step and having direct links from message<br/>body to encyclopedia.  Maybe.  One reason why not is because a dictionary<br/>project might start very soon in a small way and gradually grow.  Another<br/>reason why not is that the message may read better with no hyperlinks, at<br/>least without underlined hyperlinks, though of course *that* is a style<br/>sheet option.
