In fact, he seems<br/>more open to opposing views than practically ANYBODY on the list, in<br/>my view...</p><p>Now it depends on whether Robert can take the time from the Fractal<br/>Tune Smithy to assist with this process.</p><p>Does everybody agree that this might work?? AND is Robert interested<br/>in doing it??</p><p>Robert??</p><p>OH... BTW, it can be quite a long range project.  My assumption is<br/>that tuning may be around for some time to come... So this &quot;Web Tree&quot;<br/>could be developed very gradually... Maybe, that way it wouldn&apos;t take<br/>so much time in one &quot;chunk...&quot;</p><p>Besides, there could be more time for debate, which I, personally,<br/>feel could be very interesting...<br/>________ _____ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
