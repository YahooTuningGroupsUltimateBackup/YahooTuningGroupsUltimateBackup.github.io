Margo came up with a &gt; tuning based on a fifth of 1200 (1+3e)/(2+5e) cents, where e = exp(1) is &gt; the base of the natural logarithms. But Margo did not reject closely &gt; related tunings as unacceptable, claim her tuning was the be-all and &gt; end-all of musical tuning, or maintain her method even made sense other &gt; than as a way which helped her break out the box and find a tuning she &gt; liked and whose properties she could explore. She gained all the &gt; benefits of eccentricity without being in the least eccentric. But if &gt; making the tuning popular requires dubbing it something like &gt; SchulterTuning and putting up a web site, patenting it, and endlessly &gt; promoting it, maybe she fell short of the efforts of Charles Lucy. And &gt; as I&apos;ve remarked before, salesmanship does seem to have a good deal to &gt; do with which tunings become well-known.</p><p>Dear Gene,</p><p>Thank you for a very accurate summary of my &quot;e-based&quot; tuning. And, of<br/>course, we&apos;re absolutely agreed that it&apos;s only one possible shading in<br/>a rich neighborhood: 46-EDO with a bit less tempering, or 63-EDO with a<br/>bit more, for example. And while I happened to pick the point where the<br/>ratio of the logarithmic (e.g. in cents) sizes of the whole tone and<br/>diatonic semitone (at around 209.21 cents and 76.97 cents) is equal<br/>to Euler&apos;s e, we could alternatively set that semitone to precisely<br/>one third of a pure 8/7, for example, and get virtually the same tuning.</p><p>&gt; I apologize in advance to Margo for dragging her into this, but it&apos;s the &gt; only comparable example I know to LucyTuning.</p><p>Actually I&apos;d like to thank you for your advertising &lt;grin&gt;, and add the<br/>important point that while some tunings are promoted as &quot;one size fits<br/>everyone and all musical applications,&quot; the e-based tuning and lots<br/>of others related to it are definitely _not_ in this category!</p><p>While you&apos;re well aware of what follows, Gene, I might include it as<br/>a disclaimer to others:</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for thirds around 6/5 and 5/4, for example, you might<br/>best look elsewhere. The focus is on regular thirds around 418 and 286<br/>cents; neutral thirds around 341 and 363 cents (close to 15 and 16 commas<br/>for followers of Near Eastern tuning discussions); and septimal thirds<br/>around 264 and 440 cents. In my medieval and neomedieval styles, all these<br/>thirds are pleasant but unstable intervals that resolve to stable ones<br/>such as fifths.</p><p>Thus this is no replacement for meantone or other systems supporting<br/>5-limit harmony: the outlook is quite different!</p><p>Anyway, Gene, I&apos;m flattered that you would use this tuning as an example,<br/>agree with the parallels and contrasts you&apos;ve drawn, and would add that<br/>at the time I devised it I was quite ignorant of Near Eastern music,<br/>although now it&apos;s my favorite maqam tuning using a single 24-note<br/>chain of fifths.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=94045 href="#94045">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2010 11:32:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Michael,</p><p>Please let me comment on your scale, and on David Keenan&apos;s<br/>&quot;Noble Mediant&quot; which I was honored to be a part of in some<br/>way, although it was definitely his idea that developed in<br/>the process of some dialogues we were having in the late<br/>summer of 2000 on tuning, and especially on complex intervals<br/>such as thirds and sixths in a medieval or neomedieval style.</p><p>&gt; Come to think of it...I&apos;ve had similar issues with my (very old) PHI &gt; sections theory as compared to high points of harmonic entropy. Because &gt; if you take (using my old generating formula of (PHI-1)^x + 1 &gt; exclusively...and no other tones):</p><p>Please just let me add early that I&apos;d love to see your complete<br/>scale, or maybe versions in different sizes.</p><p>&gt; 0.618^1 + 1 = 1.618</p><p>Just to add a value in cents: this is, of course 833.090 cents, and the common element shared by the &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; approach and your scale.</p><p>&gt; 0.618^2 + 1 = 1.3819 (near the area right between 4/3 and 7/5)</p><p>This is around 559.584 cents, a bit larger than 11/8 (551 cents) and smaller than 18/13 (563 cents). I wouldn&apos;t necessarily think of it as<br/>maximum, just as an interesting place, although I haven&apos;t carefully considered this region. Curiously, your result does appear just about<br/>identical to our Noble Mediant, but it&apos;s not something I would have<br/>predicted (maybe someone like Gene could explain this result).</p><p>Something around this size could easily occur as a small &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>in a maqam like Rast, and I&apos;d happily use it in a polyphonic<br/>progression, for example between the two upper voices of a sonority<br/>with minor third (around 13/11 or 289 cents) and neutral sixth<br/>(around 18/11 or 853 cents) expanding stepwise to fifth and octave.<br/>This is a tad narrower, but should be fine! I&apos;d use it first, and<br/>ask questions about &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; later.</p><p>&gt; 0.618^3 + 1 = 1.236 (not far from the mediant at (6+5)/(5+4) &lt;the &gt; mediant of 6/5 and 5/4&gt; = 11/9)</p><p>Here I get 366.910 cents, which I&apos;d consider in a different class than 11/9. although also, of course, a neutral third. I&apos;d call it a submajor third, very close to 21/17 (366 cents) and not far from 26/21 (370 cents).<br/>This would be a great third to use for a bright Maqam Rast, among<br/>other things!</p><p>Anyway, our Noble Mediant is definitely different for 5/4 and 6/5, around<br/>339.344 cents, or somewhere between 17/14 (336 cents) and 28/23 (340 cents). That&apos;s supraminor, a bit below the &quot;central zone&quot; roughly from<br/>39/32 and 16/13 (342-360 cents or so), while yours is submajor.</p><p>So whatever is happening, you&apos;re not simply duplicating our results.</p><p>&gt; 0.618^4 + 1 = 1.145 (about 8/7, not actually a mediant of any sort but &gt; not at the 7/6 low entropy point on the harmonic entropy)</p><p>That&apos;s 235.774 cents, or a bit wide of 8/7. Our Noble Mediant is around<br/>243.619 cents. Again, you&apos;re not duplicating our results but using a different method and getting different shadings of intervals.</p><p>Musically, the main distinction I&apos;d see, and one noted by Jacques<br/>Dudon in this general region also, is that while 236 cents might<br/>still be like 8/7, a &quot;large tone,&quot; around 240 cents we find that<br/>an interval is large enough to serve as a very small &quot;minor third,&quot;<br/>for example with one voice ascending by 60 cents or so and the<br/>other descending by 180 cents or so, to contract to a unison.</p><p>For me, the exact degree of SHE (Cameron&apos;s Spectral Harmonic Entropy)<br/>isn&apos;t as important -- if I could really determine it anyway -- as<br/>the melodic context, and with music for two or more voices also the<br/>vertical or contrapuntal context. How an interval helps form a<br/>melody, or, if simultaneous, either marks a resolution (e.g. 3:2)<br/>or helps move toward a resolution (as any of the intervals in your<br/>tuning or almost any Noble Mediant might do), is most important.</p><p>Even with fine shadings, I don&apos;t necessarily think in terms of<br/>exact &quot;entropy&quot; (as if such a thing were known), but in terms<br/>of color -- with the realization, of course, that in many of<br/>my styles 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3 define stability (and 2:3:4<br/>complete stability and richness), so those are the &quot;valleys.&quot;<br/>But there are important differences of color.</p><p>Thus around 355-360 cents is &quot;high central neutral,&quot; while<br/>365-370 cents is &quot;submajor,&quot; a delightful small major third<br/>at 21/17 or 26/21, for example! Both flavors are beautiful,<br/>and it&apos;s nice to have both available. But to someone looking<br/>for 5/4, both would be &quot;high entropy&quot; by comparison.</p><p>&gt; 0.618^4 + 1 = 1.09 (about 12/11, again not actually a mediant of any &gt; sort but not at the 7/6 &apos;smallest ratio&apos; entropy point on the harmonic &gt; entropy)</p><p>Here I&apos;m fairly confident you mean 0.618^5 + 1.</p><p>Indeed it&apos;s a near-just approximation of 12/11, 149.464 cents<br/>by comparison to a just 150.637 cents. That&apos;s a central neutral<br/>second, and in my view nowhere near 7/6, a small minor third;<br/>those are different categories and regions of the spectrum.<br/>But if I read you correctly, I do agree that 7/6 is maybe the<br/>first dramatic &quot;valley&quot; as we move out from a unison and listen<br/>to simple dyads. In many of my musical styles, it tends to be<br/>the simplest and most concordant of all the thirds I regularly<br/>use.</p><p>Of course any kind of second, and especially one substantially<br/>smaller than 9/8, is going to be considerably more tense. But<br/>in a 13th-century medieval European style, it&apos;s common to<br/>use vertical minor seconds, so something like 1/1-3/2-18/11<br/>with an upper 12/11 is by that standard &quot;rather mild&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>Of course, the tension is something we (or at least I) welcome<br/>in a sixth sonority seeking expansion to an octave. To give a<br/>concrete example, in my present tuning I have A*-E*-F# (the<br/>asterisk showing a note on the upper keyboard) at around<br/>0-703-853 cents, resolving nicely to G*-D*-G*: the lower<br/>two voices descend by usual tones at 207-209 cents, while the<br/>highest voice ascends by a 138 cents or a near-just 13:12.</p><p>With 12:11 alone, the close spacing does add to the<br/>tension. In two-voice counterpoint, say in maqam-based<br/>polyphony, I might, all things being equal, consider<br/>11:6 contracting to a fifth a bit milder than 12:11<br/>expanding to a fourth -- but might well use either,<br/>depending on the context.</p><p>Anyway, again, I would consider your 149-cent interval<br/>as distinct from anything I&apos;d expect from the Noble Mediant<br/>method. And I tend to consider 12/11 as a cardinal point<br/>of reference in itself, as it has been to various theorists<br/>of maqam music looking at ratios at least since al-Farabi,<br/>rather than a mediant of two other intervals.</p><p>&gt; Some people saw a fair number of the fractions generated by ratios in my &gt; &quot;PHI sections&quot; scale</p><p>Well, now I&apos;ve seen a few, and would like to see more.</p><p>&gt; A) Were near mediants between Harmonic Entropy</p><p>This seems to me a very general category. For example<br/>either 339 cents (Noble Mediant) or your 367 cents is<br/>in the neutral region, but they&apos;re near opposite ends,<br/>respectively supraminor and submajor. This is a contrast<br/>that I encounter and relish on an everyday basis, and<br/>I can tell you that your result is different from what<br/>Dave&apos;s method, which I was delighted to take some role<br/>in discovering although it was his discovery, would<br/>yield.</p><p>&gt; B) They recalled that, historically, PHI had often been used for the &gt; quest for maximum dissonance (even though I had been trying for maximum &gt; consonance by using PHI in a different manner).</p><p>Phi can be used for many things, and one doesn&apos;t exclude another.</p><p>&gt; So they threw their hands up and told me I had simply &quot;discovered &gt; someone else&apos;s theory&quot;. They said that the exact mediants were defined &gt; by a method called noble mediants IE &gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/NobleMediant.txt">http://dkeenan.com/Music/NobleMediant.txt</a> that turn up numbers near &gt; Harmonic Entropy maxima. But if you plug in the formula on that page to &gt; Harmonic Entropy minima you will get ratios at least 10 cents away from &gt; the values in my scale.</p><p>Yes, I agree that they are distinct methods, and arise from different<br/>motivations. I&apos;ll explain the motivation that Dave and I had below.</p><p>&gt; And even if the values were the same (or in fact, are close enough in &gt; some people&apos;s minds to qualify as being the same), note that I generated &gt; them by sections and Margo Schulter and David Keenan (authors of the &gt; paper) generated them by mediants.</p><p>To me, both the methods and the results are distinct.</p><p>&gt; Actually Margo, perhaps you could help explain the differences between &gt; my old scale and the values from your &quot;Noble Mediants&quot; study &gt; yourself...I figure it&apos;s clearest to get information from its original &gt; source.</p><p>Well, while I can&apos;t speak for Dave, I see the results as very distinct,<br/>in part because your scale touches a lot of the regions where I live<br/>from day to day. The neutral third region from 330 to 372 cents or<br/>so, say, is very richly populated, and 339 cents vs. 367 cents is<br/>a distinction with a difference for me. In fact, those two intervals<br/>together would give an approximation of 14:17:21 (0-336-702 cents), one<br/>of my favorite divisions of the fifth into thirds!</p><p>&gt; Now I step back years after I found the PHI-section scale. First of all, I<br/>&gt; disagree that it&apos;s as good at producing consonance as I originally thought. I<br/>&gt; originally thought, when rounded to JI values IE 8/7, 12/11, 16/13, 13/8,<br/>&gt; 11/8...it would be competitive with things like 1/4 comma meantone for<br/>&gt; consonance but enable more chords.</p><p>&quot;Competitive&quot; is to me a curious word, because these seem like two<br/>different worlds to me. Here&apos;s a piece I wrote using some of the<br/>ratios of the kind we&apos;re discussing, for example a near-just 13/8<br/>and 7/4 as well a submajor third around 370 cents or 26/21, close<br/>to your 367 cents:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Prelude_in_Shur_for_Erv_Wilson.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This is from one point of view a variation on 13th-century European<br/>polyphony using Persian Shur with its neutral steps and intervals<br/>(or one possible flavor thereof). The same patterns apply from a<br/>harmonic point of view: stable fifths and fourths, alternating<br/>with various kinds of unstable sonorities from relatively blending<br/>to impressively tense.</p><p>Now here&apos;s a short piece in meantone (actually 2/7-comma, and<br/>a bit modified, but in the same general category as 1/4-comma):</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Invocation-ToneIV.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Invocation-ToneIV.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Major and minor thirds very close to 5/4 and 6/5 are stable<br/>concords, playing a role analogous to 3/2 and 4/3 in the<br/>previous piece. And there&apos;s less contrast in levels of<br/>tension, as well as much greater restraint in introducing<br/>unstable intervals (e.g. through suspensions).</p><p>In my view, neither style could substitute for the other:<br/>and I love both!</p><p>And this brings me to my promised explanation of the Noble<br/>Mediant. At the beginning of September 2000, Dave and I<br/>were discussing medieval European music and its neomedieval<br/>offshoots, and especially the role of complex major and<br/>minor sixths at or near ratios such as 14/11 (418 cents),<br/>13/11 (289 cents), 17/14 (336 cents) and 21/17 (366 cents).</p><p>His idea, when we discussed how some of these ratios are<br/>classical mediants (e.g. 14/11 from 5/4 and 9/7 as<br/>(5+9)/(4+7), was to find a way to locate the region of<br/>maximum complexity between two simpler ratios.</p><p>On September 5, Keenan Pepper posted his proposal for<br/>a &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning based on a logarithmic use of<br/>Phi -- not as an interval ratio, but as the logarithmic<br/>ratio of sizes between a tuning&apos;s whole tone and<br/>chromatic semitone -- in contrast to Kornerup&apos;s<br/>famous Golden Meantone, with Phi as the logarithmic<br/>ratio between the whole tone and diatonic semitone.</p><p>And Dave would want me to be _very_ clear on the<br/>distinction between Phi as an interval ratio and<br/>Phi as a logarithmic ratio!</p><p>Anyway, with our discussion on mediants and Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s post as spurs, Dave got the idea that<br/>Phi might be just what we needed to calculate a<br/>weighted mediant showing the approximate region<br/>of maximum complexity. And our paper followed.</p><p>As the paper itself explains, we were looking at<br/>a situation where fifths and fourths are stable<br/>concords, while major and minor thirds and sixths --<br/>and sometimes neutral thirds and sixths also --<br/>are used as unstable intervals.</p><p>While I consider the mathematical tool to be<br/>wonderful, I should add that I&apos;m not necessarily<br/>going for maximum complexity, at least not all<br/>the time, in such styles. Of course, for a region<br/>like 408-440 cents or so, anything is going to<br/>be relatively complex, and what I might seek is<br/>some interesting shadings within this range,<br/>which might but wouldn&apos;t necessarily have to<br/>including something close to our maximum around<br/>422-423 cents. Thus the Noble Mediant is a<br/>great tool for orienting oneself and exploring<br/>the different degrees and nuances of complexity.</p><p>&gt; Now it doesn&apos;t seem as such for consonance but the range of chords &gt; available with &quot;at least decent&quot; consonance still seems very broad to my &gt; ears. Perhaps it&apos;s because the scale simply stays predictably in a range &gt; of &quot;decent consonance&quot; and doesn&apos;t ping-pong from &quot;great&quot;/low to &gt; &quot;piercing&quot;/high consonance (like so many microtonal scales do) that it &gt; seems more stable than it actually is (at least in JI format).</p><p>A good starting point for your scale might be _timbre_. With<br/>Bill Sethares, I&apos;d say that a good tuning/timbre match for<br/>you (and you&apos;re the judge, maybe with help from others) can<br/>be far more important than someone&apos;s theoretical entropy<br/>rating in the abstract. What kind of melodic, contrapuntal,<br/>or harmonic style might fit your tuning/timbre combination --<br/>or vice versa?</p><p>More focus on various traditional or new styles of melody<br/>and polyphony -- the first not necessarily requiring the<br/>second! -- and less theoretical micromanagement of someone&apos;s<br/>notion of precise &quot;harmonic entropy,&quot; might not be a bad<br/>trend.</p><p>My advice would be that rather than trying to &quot;compete&quot;<br/>with other scales, you should explore your Phi section<br/>tuning as a world in itself. Maybe you&apos;ll want to develop<br/>timbres that can maximize consonance by matching partials<br/>or the like, especially if you want rather complex<br/>sonorities to sound more independently concordant.</p><p>Remember, interesting melody is a fine starting point.<br/>If you have that, then you can play around with matching<br/>timbre to tuning, and get something really unique and<br/>beautiful.</p><p>Try the Sethares &quot;Xentonality&quot; album, for example, for<br/>a bit of orientation. Also, the Ethno2 collection and<br/>pieces entered for the recent contest will give you a<br/>sample of lots of world musical traditions. Can you<br/>Phi scale approximate any of the tunings in that<br/>collection, or suggest some interesting variation<br/>on one or more those tuninings that you like?</p><p>Please forgive me for writing at this length.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=94047 href="#94047">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 12:38:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; 0.618^2 + 1 = 1.3819 (near the area right between 4/3 and 7/5)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is around 559.584 cents, a bit larger than 11/8 (551 cents) and<br/>&gt; smaller than 18/13 (563 cents).

But, to make complex sonorities independently concordant or,<br/>in my terms (as I understand it), maximize the number of tall chords available<br/>that can work together regardless of if it does/doesn&apos;t acheive the overall<br/>consonance of standard &quot;non-PHI&quot; theories, I agree that would be an ideal goal.</p><p>   As for can my PHI sections scale approximate any tunings in the Sethares<br/>Xenharmonic album collection...I don&apos;t remember seeing anything that matched<br/>(lots of examples IE &quot;Blue Dabo Girl&quot; and &quot;Ten Fingers&quot; just make the timbre and<br/>scale equal IE both aligned to 11TET and 10TET...and many others align to things<br/>like a straight harmonic scale and timbre or a scale that matches a bell&apos;s odd<br/>disharmonic timbre)...but I&apos;ll gladly check again.</p></div><h3><a id=94354 href="#94354">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2010 6:34:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It would seem to<br/>&gt; follow that if you don&apos;t use low-HE ratios as inputs to the Noble Mediant<br/>&gt; formula, you don&apos;t get mediants representing maximum Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>That is correct.
