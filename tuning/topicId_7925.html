This is the kind of thing I had hoped for when I got involved here.</p><p>&gt; The 7:9 has been pretty much rejected as not one that is<br/>&gt; likely to be instinctively accepted as a smooth consonance.</p><p>Really??? I thought it sounded pretty good when John Link played &quot;it&quot;(?) on<br/>his guitar over the phone. Are we talking about the same interval? Perhaps<br/>John has a comment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve made a MIDI file of some possibilities for this<br/>&gt; &apos;high 3rd&apos;, with some interesting results.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The chord is sequenced like the old Three Stooges<br/>&gt; &apos;hello hello hello&apos; routine: in 4/4 time, the ratios<br/>&gt; 1/1 on the first beat, 5/4 on the third, and 3/2 on the<br/>&gt; first beat of the second measure, with pitch-bend applied<br/>&gt; continuously to the 5/4 between the first and second beats<br/>&gt; of the second measure to create a glissando up to the target<br/>&gt; &apos;high 3rd&apos;.</p><p>It&apos;s a little difficult to evaluate the target tunings since these sustain<br/>for only a short time. Would it be convenient to add a beat or two to each<br/>item to let the target tuning sustain a bit longer? Does your software allow<br/>for this without redoing the whole set up?</p><p>Also, I agree with Paul that it would help &quot;fine tune&quot; the experiment if the<br/>vibrato could be eliminated. &quot;Straight&quot; tone is easier to tune (as well as<br/>evaluate for tuning).</p><p>&gt; Here are the possibilities I used:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) m1-2  The 4:5 is held thru the entire chord.<br/>&gt; I agree with Jerry that it doesn&apos;t sound like what<br/>&gt; singers normally do.</p><p>I noticed an interesting thing while listening to this one. Although you did<br/>not bend the third here, I had the impression that it raised slightly when<br/>the fifth came in. Possibilities: (1) perhaps I &quot;willed&quot; it to move out of<br/>habit, (2) perhaps the high third is simply a perceptual illusion, (3) and<br/>if 2 is true, perhaps singers are influenced by the illusion and actually<br/>attempt to sing what they have been &quot;hearing.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m not quite ready to believe those &quot;perhaps&quot;&apos;s at this point, but I&apos;m<br/>trying to keep an open mind.</p><p>&gt; 2) m3-4  The 4:5 slides upward to 64:81.<br/>&gt; This was the one that I thought would have sounded<br/>&gt; the smoothest, based on the numerics of the ratios.<br/>&gt; Not bad, but (surprisingly) to my ears not the best;<br/>&gt; it sounds like it goes a little too sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) m5-6  The 4:5 slides upward to 2^(4/12).<br/>&gt; To me, surprisingly, this was a close second-best.<br/>&gt; Perhaps the role of cultural conditioning plays<br/>&gt; a stronger part than we realize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) m7-8  The 4:5 slides upward to 19:24.<br/>&gt; Most surprisingly of all, this possibility suggested<br/>&gt; by Paul Erlich turned out to be the smoothest to my ears.</p><p>2, 3, and 4 all sound &quot;in the ball park&quot; to me. I sang &quot;my third&quot; to each<br/>item (from the beginning of the item) and in these cases the third came<br/>close to what I was singing (give or take for vibrato).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) m9-10  The 4:5 slides upward to 11:14.<br/>&gt; This one sounds pretty good to me, but a little too sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6) m11-12  The 4:5 slides upward to 25:32.<br/>&gt; This one definitely sounds too sharp to me,<br/>&gt; which would certainly rule out 7:9.</p><p>The last two are so high they sound more like sus chords than major triads.<br/>Certainly the 7:9 third, which sounds nothing like a perfect fourth, is not<br/>as high as these.</p><p>There are 7 items on your sound example and only 6 described here. What did<br/>I miss?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I .... used the General MIDI &apos;Choir Ahs&apos; patch.</p><p>Most synthesized &quot;Choir&quot; patches are doused in vibrato. If you can&apos;t iron it<br/>out, you might try a flute, oboe or string patch (although string patches<br/>frequently are pretty syruppy, too).</p><p>&gt; Feedback definitely wanted.</p><p>Thanks again for your efforts here. Hope this &quot;feedback&quot; is helpful.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>P.S. I hope to post some sounds next week. My &quot;new&quot; college choir will be<br/>the guinea pigs.</p></div><h3><a id=7934 href="#7934">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

What did<br/>&gt;I miss?</p><p>This is what you missed: On Wed 1/19/00 12:41 PM, Joe Monzo wrote,</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve added another rendition of the chord to the end of the<br/>&gt;MIDI file, with a glissando from 4:5 to 7:9.</p><p>&gt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a></p><p>So it appears the two chords you thought sounded like a sus chord were in<br/>fact the ones with 32:25 and 7:9 third. Vibrato aside, it seems, as I<br/>suspected you would, that you&apos;ve now judged the 7:9 major third as too high<br/>for even the &quot;high third&quot;. Furthermore, I&apos;ll venture a guess as to the<br/>reason you thought these were sus chords: due to the thirds in the example<br/>getting larger and larger, and the fact that you&apos;re not used to hearing<br/>microtonal climbs in pitch, your ear at some point decided that the pitch<br/>was a half-step above the major third, i.e., a perfect fourth. However, if<br/>the example started with a 6:8:9 (sus chord) and then went down to 14:18:21<br/>(chord with 7:9 major third), you would probably hear it as a major triad,<br/>albeit still an out-of-tune one. Joe?</p><p>Anyway, Jerry, you evidently did not express an opinion about the fifth<br/>chord, the one with a 11:14 major third. Given the amount of vibrato in the<br/>example, I don&apos;t blame you. Still, I&apos;m curious.</p></div><h3><a id=7977 href="#7977">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2000 10:43:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Possibilities: (1) perhaps I &quot;willed&quot; it to move out of<br/>&gt;&gt;habit, (2) perhaps the high third is simply a perceptual illusion, (3) and<br/>&gt;&gt;if 2 is true, perhaps singers are influenced by the illusion and actually<br/>&gt;&gt;attempt to sing what they have been &quot;hearing.&quot;</p><p>And Paul Erlich responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a psychoacoustically established fact that adding new tones can alter<br/>&gt; the perceived pitch of constant, sustained tones.

It seems very possible to me that I was<br/>experiencing that phenomenon in this case. I&apos;m not sure that it fully<br/>explains why the high third appears to &quot;lock,&quot; however, particularly since<br/>you note that it appears to happen mainly with sine waves. On the other<br/>hand, why do you &quot;doubt it would continue to be important with normal<br/>harmonic timbres&quot;? Has this effect been studied with &quot;normal&quot; timbres and<br/>been shown not to happen?</p><p>In any case, this opens a whole other world of possibilities.</p><p>BTW, You still haven&apos;t responded to my &quot;off the wall&quot; suggestion that the<br/>shift in tuning may have to do with the combination of overtones (or<br/>undertones) in the tonic and dominant fundamentals.

Of course context plays a role<br/>&gt; here too.  If the 1/1 - 32/25 - 3/2 chord were heard in<br/>&gt; a different context, with the &apos;3rd&apos; right on 32/25 rather<br/>&gt; than rising from the previous 5/4, it may sound more<br/>&gt; like a &apos;major&apos; triad.</p><p>Yes, Paul mentioned that and I am keeping it in mind.

Admittedly, my explanation is specious, but I was trying to<br/>accomodate Jerry&apos;s suggestion that there is some kind of locking going on<br/>the high third that can only occur when the fifth is present, and was<br/>assuming the high third is in the range he found it to be when listening to<br/>Monz&apos;s MIDI file.</p></div><h3><a id=8161 href="#8161">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2000 9:04:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To the post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The numbers 9, 7, and 6 being lower than 24, 19, and 16, I believe that it<br/>&gt;&gt;would be easier to lock at 1/9:1/7:1/6 than at 1/24:1/19:1/16.</p><p>Paul Erlich responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. However, the 7:9 is too wide to be musically acceptable as a stable<br/>&gt; major third over a root; so high, in fact, that it sounds quite a bit like a<br/>&gt; perfect fourth (witness Jerry&apos;s reaction to the MIDI file -- he said the<br/>&gt; high third he sung was in the range of the 400-408&#xFFFD; major thirds -- he<br/>&gt; clearly heard the file correctly since he identified the opening interval<br/>&gt; correctly as the pure 4:5 major third).</p><p>But what about the 7:9 third in the post describing the 4:6:7:9 drone? That<br/>third, as I stated earlier, was perfect for tuning the &quot;high third&quot; triad.<br/>The alleged 7:9 third in the MIDI file was not close to locking. It sounded<br/>horrid (as heard on my computer). I&apos;m quite sure, as I remember, that I<br/>could not have added a vocal fifth to that sound to complete a satisfying<br/>triad. What was the difference, assuming that both contained a valid 7:9<br/>third?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason I suggested 1/24:1/19:1/16 is that Jerry said the high third is<br/>&gt; _not_ used when just the root is present (in that case the low 4:5 third is<br/>&gt; used), but _is_ used</p><p>(&quot;seems to be preferred&quot;)</p><p>&gt; when the root and fifth are present. My reasoning<br/>&gt; (admittedly far-fetched) was that, on some level, the common overtone is<br/>&gt; actually heard</p><p>audibly? sensed? other?</p><p>&gt; as an independent voice, and therefore must</p><p>why?</p><p>&gt; be one of the<br/>&gt; notes actually in the chord. If the root is C, the common overtone of 4:5 is<br/>&gt; E, which is in the C-E dyad, but of 4:5:6 is B, which is not in the C-E-G<br/>&gt; triad. For the 7:9 dyad and the 14:18:21 = 1/9:1/7:1/6 chord, the common<br/>&gt; overtone is D, not in either chord. But for the 19:24 dyad and the<br/>&gt; 1/24:1/19:1/16 chord, the common overtone is G, which is not in the C-E dyad<br/>&gt; but is in the C-E-G triad. Hence the rule, of having the common overtone<br/>&gt; agree with the chord, would explain Jerry&apos;s observation that the major third<br/>&gt; dyad is sung as 4:5, while in the triad the major third falls in the<br/>&gt; 400-408&#xFFFD; range, which would agree with 19:24 = 404&#xFFFD;.</p><p>Interesting....but (as you say) somewhat farfetched....nevertheless,<br/>admirable.</p><p>The subject is still open, I trust.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8162 href="#8162">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2000 9:18:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Bottom line: If that was the 7:9 third, it sounds very close<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to what I have been calling the &quot;high third.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe Monzo wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;OK.  But if you&apos;re hearing 7:9 as the &apos;high 3rd&apos; here, you<br/>&gt;&gt;should also be hearing it as the &apos;high 3rd&apos; in my MIDI-file<br/>&gt;&gt;of your experiment, because it&apos;s exactly the same interval!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I suggest that the context is playing tricks on you here.</p><p>To which Paul Erlich appears to celebrate some sort of victory:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You got him, Joe!!! Good work. Clearly there are various &quot;high thirds&quot; that<br/>&gt; Jerry wants depending on context -- as the seventh and ninth of a dominant<br/>&gt; chord, he wants 7:9, but between the root and third of a major triad, he<br/>&gt; finds 7:9 &quot;way too high&quot; and prefers something in the range of 400-408&#xFFFD;.</p><p>Before admitting some sort of &quot;defeat,&quot; I would like to hear Mr. Monzo&apos;s 7:9<br/>third with NO context. If I can&apos;t sing a fifth with it that completes a<br/>locked-in &quot;high third&quot; triad, you (and Joe, I presume) can break open the<br/>bubbly.
