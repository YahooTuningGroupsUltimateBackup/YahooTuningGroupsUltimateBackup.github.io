Likewise the major ninth (9:4) represents<br/>&gt;the sum of two pure fifths.</p><p>&gt;Even as bare intervals, M2 or M9 and m7 are held to be somewhat<br/>&gt;&quot;compatible&quot; by various medieval theorists of polyphony ranging from<br/>&gt;Guido d&apos;Arezzo (c. 1030) to Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325).</p><p>I would doubt that these intervals were considered consonant outside of their ability to arise from<br/>perfect fifths and fourths in the chordal contexts you mention below:</p><p>&gt;Around 1200,<br/>&gt;when Perotin and other composers begin writing regularly for three or<br/>&gt;four voices, these intervals can actually have a relatively blending<br/>&gt;effect when combined with two fifths or fourths.</p><p>&gt;Thus Jacobus much likes the &quot;concordant&quot; effect of the major ninth<br/>&gt;when presented in a sonority with two fifths (e.g. G3-D4-A4, 4:6:9),<br/>&gt;or a minor seventh in a sonority with two fourths (e.g. G3-C4-F4,<br/>&gt;16:12:9). In 13th-century practice, a combination of fifth, fourth,<br/>&gt;and major second is also popular (e.g. G3-C4-D4, 6:8:9, or G3-A3-D4,<br/>&gt;8:9:12).</p><p>&gt;Such sonorities, also found in many other world polyphonies based on<br/>&gt;fifths and fourths as primary concords, give Gothic music an element<br/>&gt;of color and contrast. These sonorities have a kind of &quot;energetic<br/>&gt;blend&quot; which fits the overall quintal/quartal flavor but at the same<br/>&gt;time brings into play the considerable excitement and tension of the<br/>&gt;major second or ninth or minor seventh. From Perotin to Machaut, these<br/>&gt;relatively blending 3-limit sonorities (along with the unstable but<br/>&gt;relatively concordant thirds) are an attractive feature of the music.</p><p>These chords are the 3-limit analogues of the later practice of stacking thirds to create major and minor<br/>&quot;seventh&quot; and &quot;ninth&quot; chords.</p><p>&gt;In fact, Jacobus advocates what might be called an ideal of<br/>&gt;&quot;pancompatibility&quot;: _all_ the regular Pyhagorean intervals, except for<br/>&gt;outright &quot;discords&quot; (i.e. m2, M7, A4, d5, m6), may be used pleasingly<br/>&gt;in a wide range of vertical combinations, many of which he<br/>&gt;catalogues. Notably included in these essential combinations are M2,<br/>&gt;m7, and M9.</p><p>Later medieval works that feature this kind of technique represent an overall level of dissonance that<br/>was not matched again until perhaps Beethoven.</p><p>&gt;Here one might raise the question of why English theorists such as<br/>&gt;Theinred of Dover (13th c.?) and Walter Odington (c. 1300) write of<br/>&gt;thirds at or near ratios of 5:4 and 6:5, while the advocacy of such a<br/>&gt;tuning on the Continent only occurs around the time of Ramos<br/>&gt;(1482). To me, an attractive hypothesis would be that tertian or<br/>&gt;&quot;5-limit&quot; styles of harmony are recorded in regions of 13th-century<br/>&gt;England, but only became common in Continental composition during the<br/>&gt;15th century.</p><p>Sounds right to me.</p><p>&gt;However, we are fortunate to have direct evidence that a Continental<br/>&gt;theorist around 1300 favoring Pythagorean tuning _was_ quite capable<br/>&gt;of describing 5-limit and 7-limit ratios.</p><p>Excellent . . . why the &quot;however&quot;?</p><p>&gt;Jacobus of Liege, in the Fourth Book of his _Speculum musicae_<br/>&gt;(&quot;MIrror of Music&quot;) comparing the various concords, remarks that it<br/>&gt;would be quite possible to build instruments using such interval<br/>&gt;ratios as 5:1 and 7:1, but that these intervals would not be properly<br/>&gt;formed in terms of whole-tones and semitones.</p><p>&gt;He goes on to demonstrate what we call the syntonic and septimal<br/>&gt;commas: 5:1 or 80:16 is smaller than the regular major third plus two<br/>&gt;octaves at 81:16 by a factor of 81:80; and 7:1 or 63:9 is smaller than<br/>&gt;the regular minor seventh plus two octaves at 64:9 by a factor of<br/>&gt;64:63.</p><p>&gt;The inquiring Jacobus also notes the gap between the classic 3-limit<br/>&gt;concords of the fifth (3:2) and fourth (4:3), and the next &quot;useable&quot;<br/>&gt;superparticular ratio (i.e. n+1:n) of the major second (9:8),<br/>&gt;suggesting that the quite &quot;imperfect&quot; quality of the latter concord<br/>&gt;may reflect this gap. Thus he recognizes that the intervening<br/>&gt;superparticular ratios (5:4, 6:5, 7:6, 8:7) are conceivable in theory,<br/>&gt;but don&apos;t fit the tuning system used in practice.</p><p>&gt;To me, this approach seems much like that of 20th-century authors who<br/>&gt;observe that the harmonic series indeed includes a seventh partial,<br/>&gt;but that it doesn&apos;t fit the tuning of classical European music. Those<br/>&gt;who appreciate the musical value of intervals at or near 7:4 may<br/>&gt;rightly emphasize that such authors are hardly exhausting the<br/>&gt;possibilities. However, the issue is one of style rather than of<br/>&gt;mathematics.</p><p>Agreed. Monz and Dale Scott, take note.</p></div>
