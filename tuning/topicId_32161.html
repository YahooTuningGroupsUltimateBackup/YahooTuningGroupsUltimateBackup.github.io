The idea that the<br/>addition to seventh chords, ninth chords etc to the Western<br/>composers harmonic pallatte are &apos;adding the higher<br/>harmonics&apos; is just plain wrong no matter who says it. These<br/>are extended references in the 5-limit (we could say<br/>5-prime-limit), and are aurally quite distinquishable from<br/>addition of higher primes.</p><p>My take on Western music &quot;evolution&quot; is that it was something<br/>more like the evolution of the whale. We swam in a sea of<br/>3-limit, later addition of schismic thirds leading to the<br/>great &quot;step onto the land&quot; of 5-limit and then, as<br/>transposition and &quot;sameness of keys&quot; became more important,<br/>&quot;back into the sea&quot; of a closed 3-limit cycle with some<br/>&quot;good enough&quot; 5-limit identities.</p><p>A similar whalelike bit of evolution in Western music is<br/>the reduction of the complexity of accidental useage in the<br/>modal systems as well as the simplification of historic<br/>rhythmic techniques as Western music fell into the local<br/>minimum of &quot;major minor march and waltz&quot;.</p><p>In the thread it appeared, Joseph was suggesting that<br/>analogs between harmonic usage and rhythmic usage should<br/>follow the same evolution as in harmony. I guess I&apos;ve made<br/>my point about the problems I saw with that comment.</p><p>Happy New Year everyone.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=32173 href="#32173">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2001 12:14:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_32161.html#32161">/tuning/topicId_32161.html#32161</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph alluded to the notion of Western music evolving by<br/>&gt; marching ever higher up the overtone series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tend to think this is an incorrect viewpoint of evolution<br/>&gt; for one thing, and a questionable view of Western music<br/>&gt; history as well.</p><p>*****Hello Bob...</p><p>I wish I could say I invented this viewpoint.
