Instead, sometimes<br/>(particularly if I go to bed a little earlier than usual), I&apos;ll fall<br/>into the &quot;wrong hole&quot; -- instead of being asleep, I&apos;m in a paralyzed<br/>state.

Like Huyghens, Petzval worked<br/>mostly in optics, and his invention of an anastigmatic lens<br/>led eventually to the development of the modern camera.</p><p>Anyway, also like Huyghens (who - my guess - was probably<br/>the source for it), Petzval advocated 31-tET in his lectures<br/>at the University of Vienna beginning in the 1860s.  Petzval<br/>did have a piano tuned to it, and also an instrument he<br/>invented, called a &quot;guitharp&quot;.</p><p>(This information comes from M&ouml;llendorff&apos;s book, which I<br/>translated for my presentation.  Barbara Hero, who was<br/>at Microfest and saw my lecture, had with her a book sponsored<br/>by list member Jan Haluska, in which Jan wrote an article<br/>about Petzval&apos;s tuning.  She gave me the book, but I haven&apos;t<br/>had time to take more than a cursory glance at it yet.)</p><p>Well... there&apos;s a bit of a connection here, because Mahler<br/>attended the Vienna Conservatory and the University of Vienna<br/>from 1875 to 1880.</p><p>So the only thread I can trace here is that Mahler must have<br/>been exposed to Petzval&apos;s 31-tET demonstrations, and Petzval<br/>more than likely summarized how closely 31-tET resembles<br/>1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>I&apos;ve remarked here before I ever knew any of this Petzval<br/>stuff that my hunch was that Mahler would not have preferred<br/>12-tET anyway, because he worked almost exclusively with<br/>orchestras after leaving the University, and they are<br/>infinitely adjustable in intonation.</p><p>So knowing that Petzval demonstrated 31-tET at Vienna ties<br/>all of this together quite nicely.  I&apos;m pretty sure that<br/>the meantone Mahler would have preferred would have been<br/>1/4-comma.  I know quite a lot about his life, and there&apos;s<br/>no information anywhere that he would have even known about<br/>any other kind of tuning, other than 12-tET.</p><p>So my retuning of Mahler&apos;s work would definitely be based on<br/>1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>After 1904, when he became quite close with Schoenberg,<br/>Mahler probably did consider 12-tET in a bit of a different<br/>light, due to the latter&apos;s influence.</p><p>But as I demonstrated at Microfest, even Schoenberg did not<br/>definitely reject 1/4-tones until 1909 in his own work, and<br/>even in the original 1911 edition of his _Harmonielehre_ he<br/>still speaks very favorably about microtonality.  It wasn&apos;t<br/>until Schoenberg&apos;s development of the 12-Tone Method in the<br/>early 1920s that he became a staunch advocate of 12-EDO tuning.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
