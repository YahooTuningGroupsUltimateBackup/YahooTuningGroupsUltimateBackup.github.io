A properly-regulated<br/>&gt;&gt;piano&apos;s keys are actually lighter than un-weighted synth action keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Huh? That seems contrary to all my experience (and the very definition<br/>&gt;of un-weighted)! Of course &quot;lightness&quot; is subjective, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt;definitely easier (for me) to play unweighted synth after playing piano<br/>&gt;for a while than to play piano after playing unweighted synth for a<br/>&gt;while.</p><p>Piano keys are balanced.  It should require almost no pressure to move<br/>them.  Visit Faust-Harrison pianos in Manhattan sometime, and see if you<br/>disagree.  The pianos they sell are expensive, but ask them and they&apos;ll<br/>tell you the secret is the boys in the back with the screwdrivers.</p><p>The majority of pianos are poorly regulated.  It isn&apos;t too difficult, and<br/>you can do it yourself with $20 worth of tools.</p><p>Another problem is technique.  Somebody said their hands were too weak to<br/>play the piano.  Strength is a mistake.  The action has to do its thing.<br/>Just tickle.</p><p>Unweighted synth actions are done with springs.  They do not have<br/>consistent force throughout their range, and they have no momentum.  They<br/>just dumbly hug your finger.  They also mistakenly assume that actuating a<br/>sound at the point the key slams into the bottom of its stroke and<br/>actuating a sound at a specific point during the stroke is the same.</p><p>Weighted synth actions are, by and large, junk.  They slow the action down,<br/>and offer no improvement over unweighted actions.  Weight=bad.</p><p>I think somebody said they could play faster on an electric piano than an<br/>acoustic one.  Many harpsichordists say their instrument is faster too.<br/>Maybe for runs.  But ask yourself why nobody plays Rachmaninov on a synth.<br/>There&apos;s more to speed than runs.  Repetition is the most important place to<br/>have speed, and the piano has got everything else beat by a mile.  Because<br/>the keys have momentum and move independently of one&apos;s finger, and because<br/>the action has momentum and moves independently of the key.</p><p>It should not be difficult to build a synth action that has all the<br/>desirable properties of a piano action, and requires no regulation.  It<br/>should also be possible to design synth actions that do new types of<br/>things, that pianos don&apos;t.</p><p>Many people assume that the keyboard is some sort of urinstrument whose<br/>particulars don&apos;t effect what you can play on it.  Not true (I do buy the<br/>Sapir-Whorf for musical instruments)!  For example, one does not play<br/>Prokoviev on an upright.  Upright actions do not reset until the key has<br/>almost reset.  A good grand action resets the instant the hammer leaves the<br/>jack.  Stride was developed on uprights, because it took that long for the<br/>keys to pop back up.</p><p>C.</p></div>
