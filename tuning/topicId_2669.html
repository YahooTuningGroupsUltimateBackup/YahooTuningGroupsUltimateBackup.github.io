Here are some comments she makes<br/>in her article, &quot;Tuning at the Crossroads&quot;:</p><p>&quot;<br/>  More frustrating than [the limited tolerance of acoustic intruments and<br/>analog synthesizers] is the usual limit on number of tones in an octave,<br/>which really was the wholly &quot;economic&quot; reason for musicians in Bach&apos;s time<br/>to yield the much preferable sounds of the several varieties of meantone<br/>tuning for 12th-root-of-2 equal temperament. Ellis describes the results in<br/>his fine appendixes [sic] to Helmholtz&apos;s book (1954, p. 434):</p><p>&#x9;If carried out to 27 notes . . . it would probably<br/>&#x9;have still remained in use. . . . The only objec-<br/>&#x9;tion . . . was that the organ-builders, with rare<br/>&#x9;exceptions . . . used only 12 notes to the octave<br/>&#x9;. . . and hence this temperament [Meantone]<br/>&#x9;was first styled &quot;unequal&quot; (whereas the organ,<br/>&#x9;not the _temperament_ was -- not unequal, but --<br/>&#x9;_defective_) and then abandoned.</p><p>  Not everyone agreed with abandoning meantone. The English held out on many<br/>instruments until the end of the last century. Even now the truce of equal<br/>temperament is not altogether as benign as all of us born into it commonly<br/>assume</p><p>  [. . .]</p><p>  Earlier I suggested about meantone that we have excellent reasons to<br/>believe that were it not for modulation problems of &quot;wolf tones&quot; (when<br/>instruments were tuned to only 12 meantone pitches), this form of<br/>temperament would likely be in use right through to the present. . . .<br/>  What is actually occuring is that we are trying to force (3/2)^4 * (1/2)^2<br/>to be = 5/4. The left terms total 81/64, or 81/80 higher than 5/4. In cents,<br/>the left side is (4 * 701.9950) [should be 701.9550] - (2 * 1200.0) =<br/>407.8200, and that is greater than 386.3137 by the _syntonic comma_ of<br/>21.5063. But musicians for centuries have notated the major triad on C to<br/>be: C--E--G, not: C--E-flattened-by-one-comma--G . . . Something had to<br/>give, and the best-sounding way was meantone. There are four fifths to<br/>absorb the excess comma, so let&apos;s give each a quarter of it: 701.9950<br/>[should be 701.9550] - (21.5063/4) = 696.5784 for the meantone fifth. (Two<br/>of these up (and down an octave) form a &quot;tone&quot; which is exactly in between<br/>the &quot;major tone&quot; of 9/8 and the &quot;minor tone&quot; of 10/9, hence the name,<br/>_meantone_. . . .) Since low partials are involved, the resulting flat<br/>fifths beat much slower than if some higher ratio were mistuned by the same<br/>5.3766 cents -- if you will, the fifth can &quot;stand it&quot; better. The major<br/>third that results from four of these fifths is . . . perfect: 386.3137<br/>cents.<br/>  To round out this capsule explanation, what occurs in the equal-tempered<br/>version is easily shown . . . In cents we have the familiar fifth, 700.0.<br/>Now go up four of these and down two octaves: (4 * 700.0) - (2 * 1200.0) =<br/>400.0. And this is 400.0000 - 386.3137 = 13.6863 cents sharp for a major<br/>third. A 5/4 involves harmonics double those for a 3/2, so the beats of this<br/>sharp third are worse than only four times the meantone fifth&apos;s error . . .<br/>&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=2670 href="#2670">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>5/5/1999 4:03:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Inre Wendy Carlos, Paul quotes her as saying:<br/>&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt;  More frustrating than [the limited tolerance of acoustic intruments and<br/>&gt;analog synthesizers] is the usual limit on number of tones in an octave,<br/>&gt;which really was the wholly &quot;economic&quot; reason for musicians in Bach&apos;s time<br/>&gt;to yield the much preferable sounds of the several varieties of meantone<br/>&gt;tuning for 12th-root-of-2 equal temperament.</p><p>  I am amazed that Wendy Carlos would ascribe 12-ET to musicians of Bach&apos;s<br/>time.

There is no evidence that anyone at the time<br/>wanted sharp major thirds, but they had to have them in order to get the<br/>circle to close at 12.

It is tuning ET directly that is least<br/>accurate than JI. But let me not be misunderstood in implying that only certain<br/>JI intervals can be tuned in response all phemnomenon. The properties of<br/>difference tones in chords of many notes can lead to pitches outside of the<br/>standard matrix. But with 12 ET boomsliter and Creel points out that what<br/>players are hearing when playing ET is not ET (and not standard JI either). No<br/>orchestra plays in 12ET. The biggest example of the intonational problems of<br/>12ET are those pieces that combine string instruments with the keyboard. Some of<br/>the ugliest out of tune music comes out of these ensembles. String players play<br/>closer to Pythagorean. Those with Masters degrees represent for the most part a<br/>group that produces no better music that any other and as a standard represents<br/>one of the greatest injustices in our socalled civilization. We are talking<br/>about individuals spending many times over 100,000 dollars on information and<br/>attitudes that are there only to justify there own existence. This is the same<br/>group that promoted pure ugliest as a standard. It is music for an upper class<br/>to snub down to the lower classes. If not how could you afford it. The same is<br/>true of our art schools.

Handel had 14 keys per octave (not</p><p>&gt;16).  R.H.M. Bosanquet wrote in his 19th century monograph on Temperament<br/>&gt;that he could still see the shadows of the split keys where the split keys<br/>&gt;used to be.  I recall his deduction to be a mere 14.</p><p>I had seen many references to 16 pitches, produced by stop mechanisms, on<br/>Handel&apos;s organ. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t remember where I had seen these<br/>references. Fortunately, I just stumbled upon another one: Mandelbaum&apos;s<br/>dissertation. On page 251, footnote 7, he writes:</p><p>&quot;Handel, in England, had been using an organ with 16 keys to realize a broad<br/>range in what may well have been a temperament of more than 1/6 of a comma.&quot;</p></div>
