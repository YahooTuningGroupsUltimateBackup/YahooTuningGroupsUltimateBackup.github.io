With an undivided pyknon, though, it&apos;s very good<br/>to my ears as an ultra-austere enharmonic, and anyway I&apos;m a big fan of the<br/>interval range that can&apos;t really be called a &quot;third&quot; or a &quot;fourth&quot;, as are a<br/>couple of others on the lists if I recall correctly.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
