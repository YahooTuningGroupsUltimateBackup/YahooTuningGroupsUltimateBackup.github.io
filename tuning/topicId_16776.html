It&apos;s nothing you are doing I&apos;m sure.</p><p>&gt;I will send a &quot;bug&quot; report this evening, and hopefully we can<br/>exterminate the bug...</p><p>Thanks. Yes I imagine it must happen to others - why it was necessary<br/>to withdraw it immediately.</p><p>Bugs do have a way of coming back if you don&apos;t get rid of them completely!</p><p>Yes, let&apos;s hope we can get rid of it now!</p><p>I&apos;m travelling overnight and have a long-ish journey by coach.</p><p>So will prob. be more like the weekend before I can see to it, and let&apos;s<br/>hope I can get MSVC set up okay on Skye.</p><p>(Would be funny if it happened on my sister&apos;s machine!)</p><p>Thanks also for your encouraging remarks on absolute pitch and interval<br/>sense. It is nice to know that there are programs to help develop it, and<br/>confirm that such things can be learnt.</p><p>I&apos;ve just looked up Setheres on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>. Yes, I can relate well to that.<br/>Very appropriate just before setting off on a long journey with lots of<br/>engine noise in it - I hear partials in those kinds of sounds easily. It<br/>does make a kind of interesting music if you listen in that way. Have to<br/>make a point to remember and listen specially at some stages in the<br/>journey...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=17186 href="#17186">ðŸ”—</a>robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2001 3:19:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just to say, I&apos;ve been able to duplicate this bug, by looking at the<br/>debug logs Joseph has sent to me - thanks!</p><p>It happens if you have<br/>&quot;Slide to most recently visited new scale, arp. or seed&quot; ticked<br/>in<br/>Arpeggio / scale playback config button (the two tied quavers to<br/>right of the Scale... button)</p><p>If you then use one of the play buttons, with none of the<br/>scale /arp / seed windows showing, FTS tries to slide each note, and<br/>crashes.</p><p>The code is intended to be used only when you have two or more seed /<br/>scale / arpeggio windows showing, so it isn&apos;t too surprising it would<br/>crash if none are showing, but I will only know the exact details and<br/>be able to fix it when I go home (after Sunday).</p><p>To fix it, untick that option.</p><p>(if it is disabled, show two of the scale, arp. or seed windows to<br/>enable it).</p><p>Alternatively, if you don&apos;t mind resetting all the check boxes, just<br/>tick File | Reset Check boxes etc.</p><p>It is rather easy to tick a check box without intending to, as all<br/>you need do is to click on its text in order to move the focus back<br/>to the window it is on. This is the way check boxes work in Windows,<br/>so not much I can do about it. But of course, FTS shouldn&apos;t crash,<br/>whatever options one ticks!!</p><p>What a relief!!</p><p>Robert</p><p>Robert</p></div>
