In the range of his instrument - 89-178 Hz - Pythagorean is within 1 Hz of<br/>12t-ET, too.  My bad.  And actually, on closer inspection of the 4th partials, his 5th<br/>tone, what we would call a minor 7th, is a little bit sharp to both 12 equal and<br/>Pythagorean.  Somehow, it still sounds like 12 equal to my ear, which is what<br/>motivated me to do the analysis in the first place.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

I<br/>believe, however, that it is not uncommon for humans to develop musical ears<br/>that rival electronic tuners, particularly in regard to tuning a pentatonic<br/>instrument. Paul&apos;s question regarding whether his instrument was close to<br/>Pythagorean tuning was very appropriate to this point. Pentatonic music<br/>systems are so universal among primitive cultures that one must consider the<br/>likelihood that these arise out of aural sensitivity to acoustic<br/>relationships.</p><p>Vocal inflections, on the other hand, are clearly regional and these<br/>particularly intriguing to a well-tuned Western ear.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>(Sorry for the lateness of this post.

Clearly not.  Fantastic piano tuner.  Absolutely.  I would be<br/>most surprised if the artist referred to by David Finnamore did not listen<br/>for beat frequency, and use interval tests, to arrive at his beautiful tuning.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>John Thaden</p><p>John Thaden<br/>Little Rock, Arkansas, USA<br/><a href="http://www.flash.net/~jjthaden">http://www.flash.net/~jjthaden</a></p></div>
