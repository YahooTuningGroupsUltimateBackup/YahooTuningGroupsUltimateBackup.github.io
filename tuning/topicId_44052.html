I hope this is the right list for a question like this.</p><p>I would like to _quickly_ come up with a tuning to try on an organ, in the<br/>well-tempered category that will do well with Bach but not destroy Messiaen.</p><p>I have noticed that some of my favorite Messiaen pieces hang out around Bmjr<br/>and F#mjr a lot, and am concerned about putting a Bach-oriented tuning on<br/>the pipes.  I would perhaps rather compromise the Bach in some interesting<br/>way (at least I am getting out of 12eq) rather than do damage to the<br/>Messiaen.  Still I would like to have a little more stillness around C and G<br/>major.</p><p>But maybe well-tempered is no problem for Messiaen?</p><p>I just browsed the list archives a bit, and I see that there are vast<br/>territories to learn about that I have not been exposed to, but I need to<br/>come up with a tuning to try in 2 or 3 days.</p><p>The organ in question is a small (200 pipe, 3 rank, no reeds) unified Moller<br/>that includes a couple of unified 2-2/3 stops (from the stopped flute rank<br/>and from the salicional rank, the latter together with the 2&apos; salicional<br/>serving to add some (somewhat subtle) upper spectrum to go with the 8&apos;/4&apos;<br/>conical principal).</p><p>I have been warned that some organs may not tolerate much of a different<br/>tuning from the one the pipes were made for.  But I am just guessing<br/>(nievely) that a well-tempered tuning will not be so far off from 12eq to<br/>stress the range of any of the pipes.  Also I _assume_ I could adjust the<br/>overall pitch to try to equalize the balance between pipes tuned sharper and<br/>pipes tuned flatter.  Or perhaps emphasising more flat or more sharp will<br/>turn out to be a better strategy depending on what limitations we run into<br/>as we tune.</p><p>The top priority is using the organ by itself, not with other instruments.</p><p>Thanks for any input.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3><a id=44056 href="#44056">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/2/2003 4:30:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>My research points to Werckmeister III tuning for JS Bach.
