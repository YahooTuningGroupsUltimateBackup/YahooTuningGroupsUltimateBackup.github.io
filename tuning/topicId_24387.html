I&apos;m glad to hear of<br/>&gt; your success. I&apos;d be grateful for<br/>&gt; any references to recordings<br/>&gt; and/or the ear training/voice<br/>&gt; production method.  Have you<br/>&gt; had success with large choruses?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best Wishes.<br/>&gt;<br/>The only ear-training method I know for 72 is Joe Maneri&apos;s and Scott Van<br/>Duyne&apos;s book, Preliminary Studies in the Virtual Pitch Continuum, which<br/>Maneri uses in his class.</p><p>I have a recording of Maneri&apos;s choral piece with two soprano saxophones,<br/>Cain and Abel. But the performers were a group of music students, only one<br/>of whom was a voice major. So while the pitches are good, the music doesn&apos;t<br/>sound its best. If only a professional choir would agree to do it, but, with<br/>some notable exceptions, most professional musicians here in conservative<br/>Boston avoid microtones like the plague. No choruses, at all. I think there<br/>is also a cassette recording of a performance/demonstration of some 4-part<br/>microtonal contrapuntal etudes from the book I mentioned.</p><p>I have some solo songs in 72-note ET, Maneri has a new one for voice and<br/>tenor sax, and Ezra Sims has several vocal pieces. He may even have a choral<br/>piece. I could look into that.<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>------- End of forwarded message -------</p></div><h3><a id=24395 href="#24395">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2001 2:56:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only ear-training method I know for 72 is Joe Maneri&apos;s and Scott Van<br/>&gt; Duyne&apos;s book, Preliminary Studies in the Virtual Pitch Continuum, which<br/>&gt; Maneri uses in his class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a recording of Maneri&apos;s choral piece with two soprano saxophones,<br/>&gt; Cain and Abel.

I suppose if these recordings were more widely available then there<br/>would be a brighter future for 72 in the big wide conservative world.
