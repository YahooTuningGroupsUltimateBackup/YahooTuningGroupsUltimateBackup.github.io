Most modern tracker software (modplug included) has features such<br/>as pitch, cutoff, volume, and panning envelopes (cutoff usually requires MMX).<br/> I compose Microtonal music with Impulse Tracker, Buzz, and ModPlug Tracker.<br/>Although Impulse Tracker is the best as far as the sampler itself go, Buzz has<br/>a nice plugin system called machines, giving various synthesis techniques<br/>(including several different trackers), and effects.  There are countless<br/>machines available for Download, Buzz itself is free, its really easy to write<br/>plugins for (with Visual C++ 5 or grater).  You can&apos;t use most of its synths<br/>for microtuning, but some are detunable, in percentages, or cents, or whatever<br/>the author of the machine decides to make :[ The effects however make the<br/>tracked music sound really nice.  I can send you a couple Microtonal MODs<br/>(.MOD is the original tracker format, and still used to refer to all tracked<br/>music). MODs can get massive quick though, so you have to be careful, if you<br/>plan on distributing them in their native format.  You can easily save to .WAV<br/>to convert to .RA or .MP3.  Basically, I use a software synthesizer<br/>(orangator, stomper, etc) that&apos;s geared up for making single note samples, or<br/>load sounds off my keyboards with cooledit, or use guitars, or csound, or<br/>download them off the internet (go to <a href="http://www.united-trackers.org">www.united-trackers.org</a>, and click on UT<br/>Sample Ring to find lots of free samples).  Another problem is pitch bends, I<br/>take the two notes I want, compare them and bend (using the Exx of Fxx<br/>commandsets, and do it by ear.  Theres lots of neat tricks to getting better<br/>sounds.  Great stuff.  Big time waster though.
