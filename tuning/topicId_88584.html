The appalachian tuning has a E flat that necessitated some movement of pitches and still has a rough patch 0:48 - 0:52 but I still prefer this tuning.</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=177">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=177</a></p><p>The synchronous_12 does not differ from 12 tet too much so is a subtle change.</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=178">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=178</a></p><p>Chris</p></div>
