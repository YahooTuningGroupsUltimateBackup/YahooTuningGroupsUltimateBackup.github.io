I was wondering if anyone can help me understand wedgies and<br/>monzos.</p><p>1. What are the rules for &quot;flipping a monzo&quot; to create a wedgie?</p><p>2. What, practically speaking, can I learn from a wedgie?</p><p>I&apos;ll write up what I learn and add it to the wedgie page on the wiki,<br/>with examples.</p><p>Let me unpack those two questions a little bit.</p><p>==========</p><p>I ask #1 because it looks like &quot;flipping&quot; may be easier than<br/>multiplying-out-the-(n,m)-shuffles stuff going on on the Monzo page --<br/>but the flipping process isn&apos;t clear, because I see<br/>similar-but-different flipping going on.</p><p>For instance, on the Wiki page for the Schismatic family (<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Schismatic+family">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Schismatic+family</a> ), I read the<br/>following: &quot;Its [the schisma, 32805/32768] monzo is |-15 8 1&gt;, and<br/>flipping that yields &lt;&lt;1 -8 -15|| for the wedgie.&quot; Reverse the<br/>exponent order, flip the outer signs, keep the middle sign. But for,<br/>say, the Wuerschmidt comma, I read: &quot;Its monzo is |17 1 -8&gt;, and<br/>flipping that yields &lt;&lt;8 1 -17|| for the wedgie.&quot; Reverse the exponent<br/>order, but keep all the signs.</p><p>So, is there a shortcut? Does it also work for 7-limit and higher commas?</p><p>Also, is this a reversible process? In other words, if I have a<br/>wedgie, can I flip it to find the monzo of the comma(s) that&apos;s being<br/>tempered?</p><p>==========</p><p>I ask #2 because I can make some sense of some wedgies, but not<br/>others. Here are a few examples to show you the level of understanding<br/>I have.</p><p>-----<br/>WEDGIES WITH A 1 IN THE (2,n) PLACE.<br/>-----</p><p>These are finally straightforward to me, at least with respect to the<br/>(2,n) values.</p><p>Here&apos;s what the wiki page says about the schisma&apos;s wedgie, &lt;&lt;1 -8 -15||.</p><p>&quot;This tells us the generator is a fifth and that we will need eight<br/>fourths in succession to reach the pitch class of a major third. In<br/>fact, 10 = (4/3)^8 * 32805/32768.&quot;</p><p>Following the wedgie page, and using &quot;Schismatic&quot; where it uses<br/>&quot;meantone&quot;, Schismatic(2,3) = 1, Schismatic(2,5) = -8, and<br/>Schismatic(3,5) = -15. In other words, the first two numbers have a<br/>period of 2, and the third has a period of 3. (I&apos;m not sure why the<br/>third one is useful, as we&apos;ll see.)</p><p>A. This means that 1 generator (on a period of 2) gets you to a<br/>multiple of 3, so the generator must be (or, more precisely, I think,<br/>must be reducible to) a 3/2.</p><p>B. -8 generators (on a period of 2) gets you to a multiple of 5 in the<br/>numerator. The wiki uses 8 fourths up instead of 5 fourths down, but<br/>it&apos;s the same thing under octave equivalence: 4/3^8 = 2^16 / 3^8, and<br/>3/2^-8 = 2^8 / 3^8; these are both, when I multiply them by the<br/>schisma, 5 * (2 to some power).</p><p>C. I don&apos;t understand the third number. It looks like -15 generators<br/>on a period of 3 gets you to a multiple of 5 in the numerator. This<br/>means ((3/2)^-15) * schisma = (2^15 / 3^15) * schisma = 5/2187. This<br/>is 5 * 3^-6, and since 3 is the period, maybe I can ignore it the same<br/>way I ignored powers of two above. The thing is, I don&apos;t understand<br/>what to do with it. In some sense, we have a tritave-equivalent 5/3, I<br/>guess. Since -8 fifths = -5 octaves + a 5/4, and -15 fifths = 2*(-8<br/>fifths) + 1 fifth, it seems that we could also say this is -10 octaves<br/>+ 2 5/4 + 1 fifth. I tried this in 12-tET, which tempers the schisma,<br/>and it works: from C, it&apos;s an Eb. But Eb in 12-tET is a tempered 8/5,<br/>so I&apos;m not sure what that has to do with prime 3.</p><p>Anyway, none of this has anything to do with how the tempering is<br/>done, of course, but if I temper a scale using Scala or an EDO<br/>mapping, I know the relationships of my five-limit intervals. 12EDO<br/>tempers the schisma, so I can test this on familiar terrain, and it<br/>works. (I have all the details written down, and will use them on the<br/>wiki if I do a write-up, but I won&apos;t bother you with them now.)</p><p>The schisma is a 5-limit comma, so I don&apos;t expect there to be any<br/>information about 7-limit mappings in the wedgie. I&apos;d expect the<br/>schisma to leave the 7/4 completely untempered. I&apos;m not sure how it<br/>would affect something like 7/6, where the 7 is untempered and the 3<br/>is tempered, or if such an operation is even defined with a 5-limit<br/>wedgie.</p><p>I&apos;ve proved to myself that this basic procedure works for, e.g., the<br/>Wuerschmidt comma, which has a 1 in the (2,5) place. I assume that if<br/>I had a 7-limit comma, it would have a (2,7) place, and a 1 in that<br/>place would also give me the generator. I did a little checking using<br/>the Giribaldi wedgie, and the checking I did looked good. (Of course,<br/>I don&apos;t know whether my check was complete.)</p><p>-----<br/>WEDGIES WITHOUT A 1 IN THEM ANYWHERE<br/>-----</p><p>These seem more complicated, but not always completely opaque. I think<br/>I understand the kleisma, but I get lost on handling the diaschisma.</p><p>KLEISMA: &lt;&lt;6 5 -6||   --   &quot;This tells us the generator is a minor<br/>third, and that to get to the interval class of major thirds will<br/>require five of these, and so to get to fifths will require six. In<br/>fact, (6/5)^5 = 5/2 * 15625/15552.&quot;</p><p>The generator on this isn&apos;t immediately obvious to me, but I think I<br/>understand one way to get it. The 6 and 5 in the wedgie are<br/>tantalizing when the wiki tells me that the generator&apos;s a minor third,<br/>but I think that what matters isn&apos;t that they&apos;re 6 and 5 -- what<br/>matters is that they differ by 1.</p><p>5 generators gets you to 5*(2^m), and 6 generators gets you to<br/>3*(2^n), so 5*2^m * g = 3*2^n. I don&apos;t care what the factors of 2 are,<br/>so I can see that g = (3 / 5) * (2^x). The octave-equivalent generator<br/>of 3/5 is, of course, 6/5. Other intervals follow; e.g., 9/8 = 3*3<br/>(ignoring the twos because of octave equivalence) = 2*6 generator<br/>steps up.</p><p>15 tempers out the kleisma, so I can check my work, and it checks out:<br/>using &lt; 15 24 35 |, 6/5 = 320 cents and 9/8 = 240 cents. 12 generators<br/>= 12 * 320 = 3840 cents, which, modulo 1200, is 240 cents.</p><p>Are there other ways to get the generator?</p><p>------</p><p>Diaschisma: &lt;&lt;2 -4 -11||  --   &quot;This tells us the period is half an<br/>octave, the GCD of 2 and -4, and that the generator is a fifth. Three<br/>periods gives 1800 cents, and decreasing this by two fifths gives the<br/>major third.&quot;</p><p>This one completely messes me up.</p><p>It&apos;s not intuitive to me why the period should be divided by the GCD<br/>of (2,3) and (2,5) -- and my understanding goes downhill from there.</p><p>Diaschisma(2,3) = 2. That means two generators should get us to<br/>3*(2^n). But this seems to contradict the statement, &quot;the generator is<br/>a fifth.&quot; If the generator were a fifth, it seems like Diaschisma(2,3)<br/>should equal 1.</p><p>Also, two fifths on a period of an octave gets you to 9/8, or 3^2, not<br/>to 3 as the wedgie suggests. So it seems like the period should<br/>actually be half of a fifth.</p><p>Diaschisma(2,5) = -4. That means going down four generators should get<br/>us to 5*(2^m).</p><p>So 6/5 should be 2 steps up (for the 3 in 3*2 -- we&apos;re ignoring the 2)<br/>and -4 steps (for the 5) down (because the 5 is in the denominator),<br/>or 2 - -4 = 6 steps up. But with the fifth as a generator in 12-tET<br/>(which tempers out the diaschisma), 6 steps up gets me the tritone.</p><p>So let&apos;s say I think the wiki&apos;s wrong (which I don&apos;t), and I want to<br/>determine what the generator is myself. Using the same logic as I did<br/>with the kleisma, 2 generators gets you to 3*(2^n), and -4 gets you to<br/>5*(2^m), so 5*(2^m) * g^6 = 3*(2^n). That means g^6 = (3/5)*(2^x), or<br/>g = (3/5)^-6. Somehow I doubt it -- we&apos;ve gone from having primes to<br/>being in irrational number territory.</p><p>So what do I do? Take the GCD for Diaschisma(2,3) and Diaschisma(2,5)<br/>and, in all my calculations, divide it by that number?</p><p>That means one generator gets to 3 (which at least tells me the<br/>generator is a fifth), and two generators down gets to 5.</p><p>9/8 = two generators up. That works: 12-tET tempers the diaschisma,<br/>and two fifths = C to G to D.</p><p>6/5 = 1 generator - -2 generators = 3 generators. That doesn&apos;t work:<br/>In 12-tET, three fifths = C to G to D to A, but it should be Eb.</p><p>I&apos;m clearly all kinds of screwed up. Why?</p><p>-----<br/>WEDGIES WITH A 1, BUT NOT IN A (2,n) PLACE<br/>-----</p><p>Porcupine: &lt;&lt;3 5 1||  -- &quot;This tells us the generator is a minor whole<br/>tone, the 10/9 interval, and that three of these add up to a fourth,<br/>with two more giving the minor sixth. In fact, (10/9)^3 = 4/3 *<br/>250/243, and (10/9)^5 = 8/5 * (250/243)^2.&quot;</p><p>This is weird: In previous calculations, the first number in the<br/>wedgie gave me the number of steps to reach 3*(2^n). This time, I&apos;m<br/>being told that it&apos;s the number of steps to reach (2^n)/3. And the<br/>second number was the steps needed to reach 5*(2^m), but this time<br/>it&apos;s the number of steps to reach (2^m)/5. Why?</p><p>I also don&apos;t see why the generator is 10/9. The 1 in Porcupine(3,5)<br/>makes it reasonable that the generator would be related to both 3 and<br/>5, but why to 3 *squared* and 5?</p><p>If I didn&apos;t have the wiki&apos;s statement in front of me, here&apos;s what I<br/>would guess this wedgie means.</p><p>By definition, Porcupine(2,3) = 3, Porcupine(2,5) = 5, and Porcupine(3,5) = 1.</p><p>The 1 in Porcupine(3,5) makes me think that it&apos;s the generator:<br/>analogous to the case where schismatic(2,3) = 1 and one step gets you<br/>to 3*(2^n), Porcupine(3,5) = 1 makes it look like 1 generator step<br/>gets you to 5*(3^n). Now, I wonder whether the generator is supposed<br/>to be based on a period of 2, i.e., octave-equivalent, or based on a<br/>period of 3, i.e., tritave-equivalent. It doesn&apos;t matter, though,<br/>since either way it has to be 5/3.</p><p>Now, 3 generator steps should get me to 3*(2^n), and 5 generator steps<br/>should get you to 5*(2^n). 15 EDO tempers Porcupine, so using val &lt;15<br/>24 35| I get the generator 5/3 = 880 cents, 3 steps gets me to 240<br/>cents and 5 steps gets me to 800 cents. Clearly, I&apos;m wrong again.</p><p>So, what *is* right?</p><p>===================</p><p>And on top of all that, what obvious stuff am I leaving out? :)</p><p>My degree is in engineering, by the way, not mathematics. Hand-waving<br/>is fine, as long as it&apos;s deterministic. :)</p><p>Thanks very much,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=99713 href="#99713">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2011 2:44:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve looked for answers to the following questions, but I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see them. I was wondering if anyone can help me<br/>&gt; understand wedgies and monzos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. What are the rules for &quot;flipping a monzo&quot; to create a<br/>&gt; wedgie?</p><p>It&apos;s the complement operation from exterior algebra.</p><p>This is our old reference that still comes out top in a<br/>search:</p><p><a href="http://gaupdate.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/jbrowne-book-and-mathematica-appl-for-grassmann-alg/">http://gaupdate.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/jbrowne-book-and-mathematica-appl-for-grassmann-alg/</a></p><p>&gt; 2. What, practically speaking, can I learn from a wedgie?</p><p>It&apos;s one way of representing the mapping of a regular<br/>temperament, without choosing a specific tuning, or even<br/>period-generator pair.  One thing it tells you that you<br/>couldn&apos;t get any easier way is the degree of torsion but<br/>you don&apos;t need the complement for that.</p><p>&gt; I ask #1 because it looks like &quot;flipping&quot; may be easier<br/>&gt; than multiplying-out-the-(n,m)-shuffles stuff going on on<br/>&gt; the Monzo page -- but the flipping process isn&apos;t clear,<br/>&gt; because I see similar-but-different flipping going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance, on the Wiki page for the Schismatic family (<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Schismatic+family">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Schismatic+family</a> ), I<br/>&gt; read the following: &quot;Its [the schisma, 32805/32768] monzo<br/>&gt; is |-15 8 1&gt;, and flipping that yields &lt;&lt;1 -8 -15|| for<br/>&gt; the wedgie.&quot; Reverse the exponent order, flip the outer<br/>&gt; signs, keep the middle sign. But for, say, the<br/>&gt; Wuerschmidt comma, I read: &quot;Its monzo is |17 1 -8&gt;, and<br/>&gt; flipping that yields &lt;&lt;8 1 -17|| for the wedgie.&quot; Reverse<br/>&gt; the exponent order, but keep all the signs.</p><p>I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s a reliable recipe for the rank 2<br/>5-limit case.</p><p>&gt; So, is there a shortcut? Does it also work for 7-limit<br/>&gt; and higher commas?</p><p>There&apos;s no shortcut, but there are ways of abstracting it.<br/>One comma in the 7-limit defines a rank 3 temperament<br/>class.  If you want to stay in rank 2 beyond the 5-limit,<br/>you have to deal with multivectors either way -- or ignore<br/>wedgies altogether, which is an option.</p><p>&gt; Also, is this a reversible process? In other words, if I<br/>&gt; have a wedgie, can I flip it to find the monzo of the<br/>&gt; comma(s) that&apos;s being tempered?</p><p>Yes.  Strictly speaking, it isn&apos;t perfectly reversible<br/>because the sign may change.  Applying the complement 4<br/>times always gets you back to where you started.</p><p>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; WEDGIES WITH A 1 IN THE (2,n) PLACE.<br/>&gt; -----</p><p>The (2,n) place tells you the number of generators to a<br/>fifth, then?  This can be useful because it helps you guess<br/>what multiple of 12-equal you can use, if you want to use<br/>such a thing.</p><p>&gt; C. I don&apos;t understand the third number. It looks like -15<br/>&gt; generators on a period of 3 gets you to a multiple of 5<br/>&gt; in the numerator. This means ((3/2)^-15) * schisma =<br/>&gt; (2^15 / 3^15) * schisma = 5/2187. This is 5 * 3^-6, and<br/>&gt; since 3 is the period, maybe I can ignore it the same way<br/>&gt; I ignored powers of two above. The thing is, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; understand what to do with it. In some sense, we have a<br/>&gt; tritave-equivalent 5/3, I guess. Since -8 fifths = -5<br/>&gt; octaves + a 5/4, and -15 fifths = 2*(-8 fifths) + 1<br/>&gt; fifth, it seems that we could also say this is -10 octaves<br/>&gt; + 2 5/4 + 1 fifth. I tried this in 12-tET, which tempers<br/>&gt; the schisma, and it works: from C, it&apos;s an Eb. But Eb in<br/>&gt; 12-tET is a tempered 8/5, so I&apos;m not sure what that has<br/>&gt; to do with prime 3.</p><p>That number involves periods rather than generators.</p><p>&gt; The schisma is a 5-limit comma, so I don&apos;t expect there<br/>&gt; to be any information about 7-limit mappings in the<br/>&gt; wedgie. I&apos;d expect the schisma to leave the 7/4<br/>&gt; completely untempered. I&apos;m not sure how it would affect<br/>&gt; something like 7/6, where the 7 is untempered and the 3<br/>&gt; is tempered, or if such an operation is even defined with<br/>&gt; a 5-limit wedgie.</p><p>What you get is a rank 3 temperament where the 7:1 is<br/>orthogonal to the schismatic/helmholtz plane.  It&apos;s<br/>numerically like this:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53_171_130&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53_171_130&limit=7</a></p><p>It looks like the 7:1 is left pure, but you could have<br/>fixed it with 7:6 pure instead.  (Maybe it doesn&apos;t matter<br/>because schismatic is already so close to pure.)</p><p>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; WEDGIES WITHOUT A 1 IN THEM ANYWHERE<br/>&gt; -----</p><p>Finding the generator isn&apos;t obvious.  The best thing is to<br/>follow an algorithm to find its optimal tuning.  If you<br/>want a rational representative, you can look for ratios<br/>that approximate the optimal tuning.</p><p>&gt; Diaschisma: &lt;&lt;2 -4 -11||  --   &quot;This tells us the period<br/>&gt; is half an octave, the GCD of 2 and -4, and that the<br/>&gt; generator is a fifth. Three periods gives 1800 cents, and<br/>&gt; decreasing this by two fifths gives the major third.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This one completely messes me up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not intuitive to me why the period should be divided<br/>&gt; by the GCD of (2,3) and (2,5) -- and my understanding<br/>&gt; goes downhill from there.</p><p>You always divide the period by the GCD of the octave<br/>equivalent mapping.  For a 5-limit wedgie,<br/>those first two entries are the octave equivalent wedgie.</p><p>&gt; Diaschisma(2,3) = 2. That means two generators should get<br/>&gt; us to 3*(2^n). But this seems to contradict the<br/>&gt; statement, &quot;the generator is a fifth.&quot; If the generator<br/>&gt; were a fifth, it seems like Diaschisma(2,3) should equal<br/>&gt; 1.</p><p>That&apos;s because the octave equivalent wedgie isn&apos;t the same<br/>as the generator mapping.  You need to divide the former<br/>through by its GCD.</p><p>&gt; Also, two fifths on a period of an octave gets you to<br/>&gt; 9/8, or 3^2, not to 3 as the wedgie suggests. So it seems<br/>&gt; like the period should actually be half of a fifth.</p><p>No, the period&apos;s half of an octave because the period has<br/>to divide an octave.  That&apos;s how it&apos;s defined.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; WEDGIES WITH A 1, BUT NOT IN A (2,n) PLACE<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Porcupine: &lt;&lt;3 5 1||  -- &quot;This tells us the generator is<br/>&gt; a minor whole tone, the 10/9 interval, and that three of<br/>&gt; these add up to a fourth, with two more giving the minor<br/>&gt; sixth. In fact, (10/9)^3 = 4/3 * 250/243, and (10/9)^5 =<br/>&gt; 8/5 * (250/243)^2.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is weird: In previous calculations, the first number<br/>&gt; in the wedgie gave me the number of steps to reach<br/>&gt; 3*(2^n). This time, I&apos;m being told that it&apos;s the number<br/>&gt; of steps to reach (2^n)/3. And the second number was the<br/>&gt; steps needed to reach 5*(2^m), but this time it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; number of steps to reach (2^m)/5. Why?</p><p>The first number gives you the number of steps to a fifth<br/>in octave-equivalent terms.  Fourths and fifths are also<br/>equivalent because the generator could be either ascending<br/>or descending -- the wedgie doesn&apos;t specify it.</p><p>&gt; I also don&apos;t see why the generator is 10/9. The 1 in<br/>&gt; Porcupine(3,5) makes it reasonable that the generator<br/>&gt; would be related to both 3 and 5, but why to 3 *squared*<br/>&gt; and 5?</p><p>You can extract the generator mapping as &lt;0 3 5].  Then you<br/>can write 10/9 as a ket vector: [1 -2 1&gt;.  The number of<br/>generators to a 10/9 is the bracket of these two: &lt;0 3 5|1<br/>-2 1&gt; = -3*2 + 5*1 = 5-6 = -1.  (For a 10/9 generator, the<br/>mapping should have been &lt;0 -3 -5].  The wedgie doesn&apos;t<br/>directly tell you that.)</p><p>&gt; My degree is in engineering, by the way, not mathematics.<br/>&gt; Hand-waving is fine, as long as it&apos;s deterministic. :)</p><p>If you happen to know linear algebra, you don&apos;t need<br/>wedgies.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=99714 href="#99714">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2011 3:41:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; But for, say, the<br/>&gt; &gt; Wuerschmidt comma, I read: &quot;Its monzo is |17 1 -8&gt;, and<br/>&gt; &gt; flipping that yields &lt;&lt;8 1 -17|| for the wedgie.&quot; Reverse<br/>&gt; &gt; the exponent order, but keep all the signs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s a reliable recipe for the rank 2<br/>&gt; 5-limit case.</p><p>I fixed the Wuerschmidt reference.</p></div><h3><a id=99715 href="#99715">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2011 3:46:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; My degree is in engineering, by the way, not mathematics.<br/>&gt; &gt; Hand-waving is fine, as long as it&apos;s deterministic. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you happen to know linear algebra, you don&apos;t need<br/>&gt; wedgies.</p><p>Various ways of representing abstract regular temperaments uniquely are given here:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Abstract+regular+temperament">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Abstract+regular+temperament</a></p><p>The two methods which allow you do do pretty much everything, one way or another, are the wedgie and the Frobenius projection map.
