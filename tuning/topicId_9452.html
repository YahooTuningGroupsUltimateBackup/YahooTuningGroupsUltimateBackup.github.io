That&apos;s what I&apos;m using as the base scale, with a<br/>&gt;transposition available a 6:7 away.  I&apos;ve not yet tried incorporating<br/>&gt;the bottom system into the chords built using the top one. That is,<br/>&gt;using this shape:</p><p>&gt;    &lt;14:9&gt;     &lt;7:6&gt;     &lt;7:4&gt;   &lt;21:16&gt;    ; first three,<br/>&gt;     &lt;4:3&gt;     &lt;1:1&gt;     &lt;3:2&gt;     &lt;9:8&gt;    ; all four<br/>&gt;     &lt;8:7&gt;    &lt;12:7&gt;     &lt;9:7&gt;   &lt;27:14&gt;    ; &quot;chromatic&quot;</p><p>&gt;I haven&apos;t yet tinkered with chords using the bottom row, although<br/>&gt;using the bottom two, you get everything you get in the top one, just<br/>&gt;down 7/6.  I realize this is obvious to many on this list, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt;still a new way of thinking for me.</p><p>&gt;        By restricting myself to the 12 notes above I have no doubt<br/>&gt;I&apos;m missing a lot of interesting possibilites, which I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;seeing in forthcoming email :), but as I said earlier, I have to start<br/>&gt;somewhere.</p><p>Actually, using 12 for the number of notes turns out not to be such a bad<br/>idea in this case; it&apos;s just that the particular &quot;chromatic&quot; notes you&apos;ve<br/>chosen don&apos;t fall where you (I?) would want them to. For example, if try to<br/>map your scale to a standard keyboard, with the base scale on the white<br/>keys, you&apos;d have</p><p>A - 1/1<br/>B - 9/8<br/>C - 7/6<br/>D - 4/3<br/>E - 3/2<br/>F - 14/9<br/>G - 7/4</p><p>which would place your chromatic notes</p><p>12/7 - F#<br/>27/14 - G#<br/>9/7 - C#<br/>21/16 - C#<br/>8/7 - between B and C</p><p>So you&apos;d have a conflict between two of the notes and no good place to put<br/>another. You&apos;d get a more even &quot;chromatic&quot; scale, and thus a better mapping<br/>to the keyboard, if you used 9:7 instead of 6:7 as the vertical interval in<br/>your chart. You&apos;d still have the same base &quot;white note&quot; scale:</p><p>&gt;   &lt;28:27&gt;    &lt;14:9&gt;     &lt;7:6&gt;     &lt;7:4&gt;   ; last three,<br/>&gt;     &lt;4:3&gt;     &lt;1:1&gt;     &lt;3:2&gt;     &lt;9:8&gt;   ; all four<br/>&gt;    &lt;12:7&gt;     &lt;9:7&gt;   &lt;27:14&gt;   &lt;81:56&gt;   ; &quot;chromatic&quot;</p><p>which would place your chromatic notes</p><p>28/27 - A#<br/>12/7 - F#<br/>9/7 - C#<br/>27/14 - G#<br/>81/56 - D#</p><p>Ah, much better!</p><p>Now, either of our 12-note schemes above allow for your &quot;base&quot; scale<br/>(consisting of 6:7:9 triads on I, IV and V) to be played in only two<br/>different keys. But using 12 notes, you can get a virtually identical &quot;base&quot;<br/>scale to play in six different keys! This magic happens by constructing the<br/>12-tone tuning as a single chain of slighly modified fifths. This is<br/>analagous to the application of meantone temperament. Here it is the<br/>septimal comma, rather than the syntonic comma, that we wish to distribute;<br/>for example, if we increase the size of each fifth by 1/4 of a septimal<br/>comma, the 7:9 intervals comes out just, and the 6:7 intervals will be 1/4<br/>septimal comma wide; if we increase each fifth by 1/3 of a septimal comma,<br/>the 6:7 intervals will be just, and the 7:9 intervals will 1/3 septimal<br/>comma wide. My old friend 22-tone equal temperament is happily between these<br/>two bounds of optimality. So, as I mentioned before, I&apos;d tune your base<br/>scale 4 1 4 4 1 4 4 in 22-tET, but this time I&apos;d tune the 12-tone scale 1 3<br/>1 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 in 22-tET, and now you have your &quot;base&quot; scale available<br/>in six different keys! Try that and see how it strikes your ears.</p></div>
