Your reaction is the first that make sense to me. You&apos;re a rebel.<br/>I neither like tunings nor scales. To be more precise: I don&apos;t like a<br/>limited number of different tones to use in a piece of music.</p><p>In mine opinion, Just Intonated tones have to be recalculated at each very<br/>moment. Depending on:<br/>1. Melody: what happens before, what&apos;s gonna happen afterwards.<br/>2. Harmony: what&apos;s happening on the moment itself.<br/>With a limited number of tones you get stuck when the piece of music evolve.<br/>Because, it seems to me, melody runs on other tuningrules than harmony..</p><p>I see one important reason to choose for a limited number of tones:<br/>It&apos;s the property of most musical instruments. They are pretuned whit fixed<br/>tones. ET12 or JI, it doesn&apos;t  matter. The number is fixed en limited.</p><p>So why not determine first how a piece of music should sound like and<br/>afterwards take the limitation of the instrument in count.</p><p>Acoustics, physics and maths.are the base to start from to create a new<br/>theory. Let&apos;s start from zero, as today&apos;s music has never exist.</p><p>I think you are right. This is the wrong list. If you ever find the right<br/>one, please let me know. I&apos;ll join.</p><p>Peter</p></div>
