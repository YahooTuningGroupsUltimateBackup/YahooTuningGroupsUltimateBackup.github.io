That being said, we did our best to put into context<br/>various pieces by Lou Harrison, the earliest being 1990 and the<br/>latest being 2000.  Harrison died, regrettably, in 2003, so these<br/>works are among his very last.</p><p>A couple of things need first be said about Harrison.  For one thing,<br/>he was a great pioneer of many trends in contemporary music which we<br/>hold dear today.  He advocated &quot;multiculturism&quot; &grave;way before it became<br/>fashionable, and for decades was weaving non-Western musics,<br/>particularly Javanese Gamelan influences, into his pieces.  He also<br/>took a great interest in &quot;alternate tunings,&quot; i.e. notes other than<br/>those heard by playing our &quot;normal&quot; 12 &quot;black and white&quot; keys on a<br/>typical piano.</p><p>It need be said that, to some Western ears, these influences create a<br/>kind of &quot;flat&quot; surface to his music.  This is not necessarily a<br/>criticism, simply an observation that his music weaves around in<br/>a &quot;modal&quot; or &quot;scalar&quot; way and doesn&apos;t really try to modulate,<br/>or &quot;change key&quot; much in the traditional Western sense.  In this way,<br/>it is a bit of a precursor to our modern &quot;minimalist&quot; movement,<br/>restrained in it&apos;s use of key change and what is known in theoretical<br/>jargon as &quot;tonicization,&quot; or making various chords predominate.</p><p>To those expecting more conventional Western chord change, there is<br/>an appearance of something lacking.  There could be an appearance of<br/>an even greater something lacking when one Harrison piece is played<br/>after another, a situation which provoked one composer companion<br/>(hardly a conservative, by the way) to opine that this concert<br/>was &quot;long winded&quot;  I suppose Buddhist meditation could also be<br/>considered &quot;long winded&quot;, so it all depends on how one looks at it.</p><p>Another factor could be Harrison&apos;s avoidance, whether intentional or<br/>not, of many textural elements possible with conventional<br/>instruments.  He seems just not interested in these.  You will almost<br/>never hear a sul ponticello (bowing near the bridge) or a sul tasto<br/>(bowing near the fingerboard) in his string writing, for instance.<br/>He&apos;s more interested in weaving melodic lines in a modal fabric, in a<br/>practically hypnotic state, rather than having the spell broken<br/>by &quot;special effects.&quot; For some, the hypnotism is exhilarating;  for<br/>others, it&apos;s time for a &quot;no-doze.&quot;</p><p>Of the six Harrison works presented during the evening, one real<br/>standout was the most recent piece, Sonata for Harpsichord (2000).<br/>This piece was in one of Harrison&apos;s favorite &quot;alternate tunings,&quot;<br/>announced simply as &quot;Kirnberger.&quot; Most probably this was the tuning<br/>of  &quot;Kirnberger II,&quot; which Harrison has frequently used. Harrison is<br/>interested in &quot;just intonation,&quot; or creating tunings with &quot;pure<br/>tones&quot; or &quot;minimal beating&quot; and Kirnberger II is a tuning that is<br/>about as close as one can come to &quot;just intonation,&quot; music with no<br/>interval beating, and still use only 12 pitches per octave.</p><p>One feature of this harpsichord piece which made it exceptional was<br/>the final movement, &quot;Estampie.&quot;  This is based on a Middle Ages dance<br/>and one can imagine that it was actually &quot;stamped&quot; by dancers in<br/>those days.  Harrison chooses to intersperse chromatic clusters<br/>(playing several adjacent notes of the harpsichord together) amid the<br/>more modal elements of his style.  With a brisk tempo, this work<br/>really &quot;livened up&quot; the proceedings.</p><p>Another work, although very short, which seemed particularly<br/>successful was Harrison&apos;s piece for soprano, sung here nicely by<br/>Ellen Macdonald, and a mixed ensemble of two violas, harp and<br/>flute/piccolo, Vestiunt Silva (Latin text) from 1995.  Although in<br/>Harrison&apos;s &quot;expected&quot; style, the varieties of timbres made by all<br/>these instruments really made this piece sparkle.  And, as usual,<br/>Harrison&apos;s work is extremely well-crafted.</p><p>Of note was the last movement of Harrison&apos;s Suite (1995) for cello<br/>and piano.  This piece showed off one of Harrison&apos;s greatest<br/>strengths, the long-long line.  Move over Nadia Boulanger:  this<br/>Allegro had a theme that must have used 50 consecutive notes in one<br/>melodic &quot;take.&quot;  Cellist Gregory Hesselink navigated this long phrase<br/>with apparent ease.</p><p>The last work on the program was huge, or at least for the<br/>exceedingly beautiful, but small Christ Chapel of Riverside.  Fifteen<br/>string players sawed through a nice New First Suite for Strings<br/>(1994), filled with energetic, voluminous counterpoint, chromaticism<br/>in the second movement &quot;Chorale&quot; and even the joyous percussive<br/>slapping of the lower instruments with hands during the &quot;Round<br/>Dance,&quot; a fun touch.</p><p>At a conference/concert series in Claremont, California in 2001, I<br/>had the meaningful opportunity to meet Lou Harrison, probably one of<br/>the kindest and wisest individuals humanity can be proud to claim.<br/>Yes, sadly those meetings are not going to happen anymore.  He&apos;s no<br/>longer with us, but his spirited and spiritual music lives on.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
