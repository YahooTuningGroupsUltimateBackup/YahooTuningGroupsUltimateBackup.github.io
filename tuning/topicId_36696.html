The patterns of<br/>counterpoint and harmony are at once familiar, and yet quite<br/>altered. It is a new universe, a xentonal expanse only very partially<br/>to be described in words, musical notations, or tabulations in cents.</p><p>Of course, as many of you may suspect, the new universe of concord<br/>which I have experienced depends largely on the critical factor of<br/>timbre, that marvellous dimension of music which Pierce, Darreg,<br/>Chowning, Carlos, Sethares, Ligon, and others have helped to make<br/>accessible to these ongoing explorations.</p><p>Finding the &quot;right timbre&quot; for 11-EDO, or more specifically my<br/>approach to it, has been my aspiration since last summer, and only in<br/>the last few days, prodding by that &quot;Decimal Counterpoint&quot; thread,<br/>have I come up with some FM settings that have really drawn me into<br/>that approach -- amplifying and modifying it in the process, of<br/>course.</p><p>At the same time as I was getting the timbre settings into place --<br/>not that I claim any definitive solution -- the idea of the hexatonic<br/>scale occurred to me, with lots of inspiration, Paul, from your paper<br/>and some more recent comments.</p><p>This scale, easy to find on my 22-EDO keyboard, provides a ready<br/>&quot;compass&quot; to 11-EDO -- indeed the complete 11-EDO set can be mapped as<br/>two hexatonic scales at 1/11 octave apart, with one note shared in<br/>common on both manuals. In 11-EDO degrees and cents, the hexatonic<br/>scale is:</p><p>       0          2          4         6         8      9       11<br/>       0       218.18     436.36    654.55    872.73 981.82    1200<br/>           2           2         2         2        1        2<br/>        218.18      218.18    218.18     218.18   109.09   218.18<br/>           L           L         L         L        s        L</p><p>In my next post, I&apos;ll share more on this scale (and some comments<br/>about it returned by the SHOW DATA command in Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s<br/>excellent Scala program available free on the Internet), explain my<br/>keyboard layout for 22-EDO and 11-EDO, and give a quick first example<br/>of note-against-note counterpoint in the hexatonic scale.</p><p>Also, Paul, I can&apos;t resist giving a table of hexatonic names for the<br/>interval categories in 11-EDO; and Graham, I&apos;ll give a quick table of<br/>concord/discord categories as I tend to treat them at this early<br/>stage.</p><p>However, since short posts are easier to read, I&apos;ll conclude these<br/>first impressions by saying that 11-EDO is beautiful, that it has a<br/>special kind of consonance and enchanting patterns of counterpoint and<br/>harmony to offer, and that the wonders of customized timbre do indeed<br/>reveal new musical geometries, new expressions of musical coherence<br/>and meaning.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36700 href="#36700">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2002 7:34:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

Near the bottom of what? Certainly not near the<br/>bottom of a list of all possible 5-limit temperaments. It is number 16 on<br/>my personal list, that starts like this (excluding the degenerate twin and<br/>half meantones which would otherwise go just above neutral thirds).</p><p>meantone<br/>schismic<br/>diaschismic<br/>kleismic<br/>augmented<br/>magic<br/>semiminorthirds (porcupine)<br/>wuerschmidt<br/>subminor thirds (orwell)<br/>semisixths (tiny diesic)<br/>quartafifths (minimal diesic)<br/>quintelevenths (AMT)<br/>neutral thirds<br/>tertiathirds (Negri&apos;s system)<br/>diminished<br/>pelogic<br/>quintuple thirds (Blackwood&apos;s decatonic)</p><p>Now any kind of ranking of tunings for some kind of &quot;usefulness&quot; or<br/>&quot;interestingness&quot; is bound to make someone unhappy. It&apos;s a crazy thing to<br/>try to do, really. But the purpose was mainly to limit, from the infinity<br/>of possibilities, the number of temperaments to appear in a sort of catalog<br/>of 5-limit temperaments. So Paul should simply be happy that pelogic is in<br/>there.</p><p>Please note that, the identification of a 5 note chain in pelogic<br/>temperament, with actual pelog, is still open to debate. But even assuming<br/>this to be valid, placing a low value on pelog _as_a_5-limit_temperament_<br/>is not the same as placing a low value on pelog per se. I know very little<br/>about pelog but I understand that the approximate 5-limit triads of pelogic<br/>temperament do not feature highly (if at all) in traditional pelog music. I<br/>assume there are pelog experts on the list who will correct me if I&apos;m wrong<br/>here.</p><p>The other issue is of course that of &quot;custom timbres&quot;. I expect that _any_<br/>temperament on that list whose low position is due to its large  deviations<br/>from 5-limit consonances (as opposed to being due to it requiring large<br/>numbers of notes to get a few chords) could be elevated to near the top of<br/>the list by finding or designing a custom timbre for it in the manner of<br/>Sethares. The last three on the list are in this category.</p><p>This is not &quot;slavishly following the harmonic series&quot; but it is still<br/>following a (inharmonic) partial series. And the reason why we do this is<br/>simple. I assume we can take it that interesting music, if it uses harmony<br/>at all, must have consonances of some kind. Few people find music<br/>containing only dissonance interesting for very long. Of the two (of course<br/>it is really a continuum) consonance is by far the hardest to find in (or<br/>put into) a scale, because other desirable scale properties tend to be<br/>incompatible with it; a recessive gene as it were. This is because<br/>consonance is experienced only when the partials of the simultaneous notes<br/>coincide or nearly coincide in frequency. This includes the partials<br/>generated by nonlinearities in our ears. Note that the latter are harmonic<br/>even if the original timbre isn&apos;t.</p><p>If one is to give a single ranking of 5-limit temperaments for general use,<br/>one must of course assume a lot of things, one of which is that the timbre<br/>is harmonic. We do this because the most common timbres _are_ harmonic, or<br/>very nearly so. And surely, the ability to produce consonance with only<br/>one, or a small class of timbres, makes a tuning less generally useful.</p><p>Maybe there is some commonality among inharmonic timbres so that someone<br/>could produce another list ranked for consonance with &quot;a typical inharmonic<br/>timbre&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I hope<br/>&gt; margo and others will join me in trying to convince him otherwise; a<br/>&gt; well crafted example with fifths that are 47 cents (!) off the<br/>&gt; harmonic series might just do the trick.</p><p>I would love to hear such music, but in this case I don&apos;t think it will<br/>convince me of anything I am not already convinced of.</p><p>In regard to 11-EDO, if I remember rightly, Dan Stearns pointed out that it<br/>has reasonably good approximations to 7:9:11, which can function as<br/>consonances even _with_ a harmonic timbre. In that regard, it&apos;s still<br/>following the harmonic series (there&apos;s nothing slavish about it), but it&apos;s<br/>following a part of the series that doesn&apos;t fit into the n-limit way of<br/>categorising tunings, which has been dominant for too long.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=36719 href="#36719">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2002 7:55:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Another way (to evaluate ETs), one that has been notably argued triple<br/>fortissimo by folks like Darreg and McLaren as the only truly useful<br/>way, is to make music in these tunings.</p><p>This would be the hands-on approach--the MMM approach.</p><p>It would be great if there were many talented and gossipy folks<br/>committed to composing and creating with these tunings for a while,<br/>exchanging notes and ideas... seeing what works and what doesn&apos;t WHERE<br/>IT REALLY COUNTS (in actual music).

I expect<br/>&gt; that _any_<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament on that list whose low position is due to its large<br/>&gt; deviations<br/>&gt; &gt; from 5-limit consonances (as opposed to being due to it requiring<br/>&gt; large<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers of notes to get a few chords) could be elevated to near<br/>the<br/>&gt; top of<br/>&gt; &gt; the list by finding or designing a custom timbre for it in the<br/>&gt; manner of<br/>&gt; &gt; Sethares.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ah -- but this is quite different from what i (and to some extent<br/>&gt; margo and dan) am suggesting. one can get away with a &quot;pastelized&quot;<br/>&gt; timbre -- a wide variety of inharmonic timbres are possible for this<br/>-<br/>&gt; - and &apos;pelogic&apos; will work just fine -- no need to tune timbre to<br/>&gt; tuning a la sethares. i&apos;ve related this to my harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; theory -- the greater the inharmonicity, the more uncertain the<br/>&gt; virtual fundamental of each tone, and therefore the larger the s<br/>&gt; value in the appropriate harmonic entropy calculation for dyadic or<br/>&gt; chordal consonance, and therefore the larger the mistuning allowable<br/>&gt; for simple intervals. the details of the inharmonic timbre are<br/>&gt; relatively unimportant!</p><p>OK. This is a new idea for me. That some tunings may work well with<br/>_any_ harmonic timbre. I&apos;d like to hear some evidence for that. Such<br/>as the same pelogic piece done with two timbres having 6 partials,<br/>with the same amplitude and envelopes for the corresponding partials,<br/>but one of them having the partials designed to match the scale and<br/>the other one having them moved by the same number of cents on the<br/>_other_ side of harmonic. This could simply be all partials compressed<br/>by 23 cents versus stretched by 23 cents.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; margo and others will join me in trying to convince him<br/>&gt; otherwise; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; well crafted example with fifths that are 47 cents (!) off the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmonic series might just do the trick.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would love to hear such music, but in this case I don&apos;t think it<br/>&gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; convince me of anything I am not already convinced of.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In regard to 11-EDO, if I remember rightly, Dan Stearns pointed<br/>out<br/>&gt; that it<br/>&gt; &gt; has reasonably good approximations to 7:9:11, which can function<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; consonances even _with_ a harmonic timbre. In that regard, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; following the harmonic series (there&apos;s nothing slavish about it),<br/>&gt; but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; following a part of the series that doesn&apos;t fit into the n-limit<br/>&gt; way of<br/>&gt; &gt; categorising tunings, which has been dominant for too long.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you&apos;re missing the point above. read margo&apos;s post again. it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; *fifths* and *fourths*, standing in for 3:2 and 4:3, that margo<br/>seems<br/>&gt; to be happy with in her &apos;Chowningized&apos; 11-equal example. this has<br/>&gt; nothing to do with 7:9:11. we&apos;re talking 3-limit!</p><p>I apparently haven&apos;t read the post you are referring to at all.

Xenofifths and xenofourths<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>When presented in timbres where they are optimized for stability and<br/>consonance, the 11-EDO intervals of 6/11 octave (~654.545 cents) and<br/>5/11 octave (~545.454 cents) can have an amazingly &quot;convincing&quot;<br/>fifthlike or fourthlike quality, and yet, as Jacky has said, also one<br/>quite &quot;alien.&quot;</p><p>To communicate both sides of this reality, which I have experienced<br/>with my own timbres as well as Jacky&apos;s, I would like to propose the<br/>terms &quot;xenofifths&quot; and &quot;xenofourths&quot; to describe these timbrally<br/>consonant intervals about a diesis from 3:2 (~701.955 cents) and 4:3<br/>(~498.045 cents).</p><p>In 11-EDO, these intervals belong to what I would term the subcategory<br/>of infrafifths and ultrafourths, that is, small xenofifths and large<br/>xenofourths. In tuning systems such as 13-EDO, we have ultrafifths and<br/>infrafourths -- again about a diesis from 3:2 and 4:3, but in the<br/>opposite directions.</p><p>So far, I have found it easiest to get reasonably predictable results<br/>with 11-EDO infrafifths and ultrafourths using a celeste-like timbre:<br/>that is, to get these intervals to sound comparably consonant at<br/>different locations in the tuning.</p><p>With organlike timbres, I encounter a curious situation where F3-B3-F4<br/>can sound like very convincing &quot;musical equivalent&quot; of a 2:3:4 trine<br/>(or xenotrine), but G3-C#4 might sound quite tense and &quot;dissonant,&quot;<br/>like a usual tritone. My immediate response is more trial and error;<br/>someone like Bill Sethares, or Jacky Ligon for that matter, might be<br/>able to approach the problem in a more directed way.</p><p>Anyway, having read the dialogue between Jacky and Paul Erlich and Joe<br/>Pehrson, I would say that all have presented different sides of the<br/>picture.</p><p>While I&apos;m ready to accept both Jacky&apos;s 11-EDO infrafifths and mine<br/>(with the celeste-like timbre, and sometimes the organ-like timbres)<br/>as &quot;musically interchangeable&quot; with 3:2, this doesn&apos;t mean that a<br/>listener like Paul might not be able very quickly to identify the cues<br/>that this is indeed musical metaphor rather than an equation.</p><p>At the moment when I hear an 11-EDO xenotrine that succeeds, my<br/>impression is one of delightful concord and aptness, maybe like a<br/>system of artificial gravity. However, Paul could be tuned into the<br/>signs that this is, to follow the analogy, indeed a rotating<br/>spaceship, not a planet exerting the substantial gravitational field<br/>associated with familiar 1G conditions.</p><p>As Joe has said, the music produces the impression of a fifth or<br/>fourth, at least for some of us -- and the term _xenofifth_ or<br/>_xenofourth_ focuses on both the similarities and differences.</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>2. Jacky&apos;s experiments -- by telephone<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>How exciting it was to hear Jacky&apos;s examples by telephone, and to<br/>learn more about the artistic purpose and context.</p><p>Listening to the first examples posted here, I indeed heard &quot;fifths&quot;<br/>of a special kind, and at the same time the unusual character of the<br/>timbre itself struck me. As Jacky explained, the intention here was<br/>not simply to maximize the consonance of these xenofifths, but also<br/>deliberately to produce a timbre with overlapping sonorities, in<br/>contrast to more of a usual organ effect making these sonorities<br/>discrete.</p><p>Then Jacky tried a timbre with odd partials based on the ratios of<br/>11-EDO, and adjusted the parameters to get more discrete sonorities.<br/>I found the xenofifths clearer, and was impressed by the total<br/>impression of consonance -- present in the first examples also, but<br/>better defined with an increase in clarity of pitches and successive<br/>sonorities.</p><p>At this point, we tried a four-voice cadence in Jacky&apos;s odd partials<br/>timbre which sounded quite convincing to me, and for which I will<br/>provide a link along with the following discussion.</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>3. An 11-EDO cadence in Jacky&apos;s timbre<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>While people may debate how &quot;consonance&quot; or &quot;dissonant&quot; 11-EDO should<br/>be considered in different timbral conditions, one reputation that<br/>this tuning has is that it isn&apos;t very cadentially oriented. This could<br/>be deemed an advantage either for styles seeking &quot;random dissonance,&quot;<br/>or for those relishing &quot;random acts of consonance.&quot;</p><p>Indeed I would agree that treating a 655-cent xenofifth as a stable<br/>&quot;resolution&quot; is a musical metaphor, by force of taste and sheer<br/>historical association, rather than a reflection of the special<br/>simplicity of this interval -- in contrast to a usual 3:2.</p><p>However, under the right circumstances, cadentiality can happen, and<br/>here&apos;s my favorite four-voice progression as shown in 22-EDO notation<br/>based on a Pythagorean-like chain of 22-EDO fifths (13/22 octave),<br/>with the 11-EDO xenofifth spelled as a tritone, and a + sign showing<br/>a note raised by 1/11 octave:</p><p>                  E4    F4<br/>                  C#4   B3<br/>                  A3    B3<br/>                  G3    F3</p><p>Here&apos;s Jacky&apos;s rendition in the odd-partials timbre:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/Schulter-11EDO-Cadence.mp3">http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/Schulter-11EDO-Cadence.mp3</a></p><p>The &quot;unstable&quot; sonority at a rounded 0-218-655-873 cents expands to a<br/>xenotrine at 0-655-1200 cents, with a guiding outer progression of<br/>an 8-step inteval expanding to an 11-step octave. This is the<br/>equivalent of a usual medieval resolution from major sixth to octave,<br/>which for me has strong cadential implications.</p><p>-----------------------<br/>4. Consonance in 11-EDO<br/>-----------------------</p><p>My experiments suggest that while a xenotrine can indeed provide a<br/>convincing resolution, the tuning seems to have many notably restful<br/>or &quot;concordant&quot; sonorities -- for example, Dave Keenan&apos;s 0-4-7 steps,<br/>and also, interestingly, 0-4-9 steps. The latter could be taken as an<br/>approximate 1:1-9:7-7:4, with the tempering placing the upper voices<br/>at a 545-cent xenofourth.</p><p>This would lead to the conclusion that 11-EDO, like Paul&apos;s beloved<br/>22-EDO tetrad of 0-7-13-18 steps (~4:5:6:7), has a potentially stable<br/>and concordant sonority -- at least in some timbres I tried --<br/>combining forms of what would conventionally be termed a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>and &quot;minor seventh.&quot; In the 11-EDO sonority, both intervals<br/>approximate septimal forms.</p><p>These are notes in the middle of experimentation, and I would also<br/>warmly like to thank Gene Ward Smith and the others who have shared in<br/>this discussion, with special greetings to Stephen Golovnin, and hopes<br/>the excitement about 11-EDO may lead to much beautiful music in this<br/>and other tunings.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36879 href="#36879">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2002 9:41:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
