They cease not polluting young minds with extreme doses of nationalist indoctrination which eventually lead to toxic isolation and reactionist fanaticism.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Pete McRae<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 03 Mart 2005 Per&scedil;embe 23:59<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: new member question from a theory class</p><p>  I hope you&apos;ll forgive any impertinence on my part for feeling the need to chime in here, again.</p><p>  Once again, a statement like that does a tremendous disservice to intellectuals who are quite capable (to say the least) of discerning the difference between &quot;objective&quot; quantification, and experiential &quot;knowing&quot;, but who may be skeptical towards the &quot;science&quot;.</p><p>  I know from the flurry of nonsense that came from the very mention of ___, that  &quot;real&quot; intellectuals are just as prey to their affections and affectations as anyone else.  And, I just met a physics professor who insists on calling 12Tet a &quot;well-temperament&quot;, presumably to obfuscate the nature of his real agenda, which is preserving the institution as it serves himself.</p><p>  For my money, Western &quot;functional&quot; harmony is merely a function of Western &quot;teleological&quot; or &quot;pragmatic&quot; considerations, NOT of any particular physical reality, ie the overtone series.</p><p>  If one considers a harmonic progression (eg V-I) in the Music Theory class sense &quot;profound&quot;, or insipid and sentimental (as I do), what does that mean with respect to someone who considers an interval, or scale, or Rag, or whatever, &quot;devotional&quot;?</p><p>  The former probably does not believe that he or she is merely buffeted by their own emotions, in other words they don&apos;t believe it&apos;s insipid or sentimental, anymore than the latter believes that their devotion will actually cure disease, or achieve enlighenment, in any time-constrained fashion.</p><p>  I hope we can keep the &quot;debunking&quot; on topic, and somehow mitigate so much, pardon the expression, musical Eugenics.</p><p>  Best,</p><p>  Pete</p></div>
