At best, these theories give us some clues as to what qualifies in A) as a &quot;dual purpose chord&quot; and some sense of where the root is (although, again, even that perception can vary widely per person).</p><p>But what, perhaps, does not vary widely is</p><p>A) How much TONAL COLOR a piece has (IE sense of different roots)<br/>B) How much PLAYFULNESS a piece has between switching tonal colors and rhythms EASILY AKA without requiring much effort of the listener to follow the music.<br/>C) How much complexity can be allowed without making the dissonance (or consonance!) of the music sway too far from it&apos;s original &quot;root&quot; theme.</p><p>  And these, I believe, is where microtonality can truly give us many more options virtually all listeners can agree on as valuable.</p></div><h3><a id=100299 href="#100299">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2011 9:46:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think, in the end of the day (trying to &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot;) music can be reduced to a few things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A) A &quot;root&quot; chord/mood (or usually two to three or so at most), which establishes the general emotion for any given theme/part of a piece of music.</p><p>What in the world makes you think music must have a tonal center?</p></div><h3><a id=100300 href="#100300">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2011 10:00:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;What in the world makes you think music must have a tonal center?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never said tonal center, I said root &quot;mood&quot;.&nbsp; I&apos;m referring to the average mood and amount of tension of that mood in a piece of music.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way a song starting in C minor may have a &quot;minor&quot; mood even if it has another resolved-sounding chord that does NOT have a root at C.&nbsp; A lot of this goes back to &quot;mode theory&quot;...IE what&apos;s the difference between major and relative minor in 12TET when the notes and chords used are the same?...a lot of it goes back to the mood of the often longer-held resolved chords in the piece of music in question.&nbsp; I&apos;m talking mood here, not &quot;math&quot;.</p><p>--- On Thu, 6/23/11, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: kiss<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Thursday, June 23, 2011, 9:46 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think, in the end of the day (trying to &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot;) music can be reduced to a few things:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; A) A &quot;root&quot; chord/mood (or usually two to three or so at most), which establishes the general emotion for any given theme/part of a piece of music.</p><p>What in the world makes you think music must have a tonal center?</p></div><h3><a id=100302 href="#100302">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2011 11:21:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;What in the world makes you think music must have a tonal center?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; I never said tonal center, I said root &quot;mood&quot;.</p><p>Does my music have a root mood, in your view?

He uses<br/>&gt; the words very slightly differently than that, but that&apos;s the gist of<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>Well, the thing that seems evident to me is that both the completely Otonal (lydian) and the completely Utonal (locrian) modes are actually the least harmonically stable, and the ones that are mostly Otonal (Ionian) and mostly Utonal (Phrygian) are the most stable modes. I couldn&apos;t tell you exactly why, but that is what I have observed. The thing is, once you get into the middle ground between the Utonal and Otonal-ness, the stability dips.</p><p>Another thing we have to consider is the difference between melodic and harmonic stability in a scale. One thing I have also noticed is that the Otonal (major) intervals seem to flow melodically best upwards, and the Utonal (minor) intervals flow melodically best downwards. Maybe the slightly mixed U/Otonal scales work better because the melodic movement is directed better to the chord tones of the tonic triad.</p><p>I find Ionian b6 to be more tonally stable than regular Ionian; The 7th leads to the tonic, the 6th leads to the fifth, and the 4th to the 3rd. According to my theory, in regular Ionian the 6th has more of a tendency to move up because it is a major interval even though the 5th and 7th are both the same distance away. (in equal temperament anyway)</p><p>But I don&apos;t know, maybe this could be better explained simply by the concept of leading tones?

Now, I&apos;m not saying that all the tuning<br/>theory produced up until this point is pointless, but that it lacks a<br/>strong fundamental core, and comprehensive laws of tonal gravity.&quot;</p><p>I think, in the end of the day (trying to &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot;) music can be reduced to a few things:</p><p>A) A &quot;root&quot; chord/mood (or usually two to three or so at most), which establishes the general emotion for any given theme/part of a piece of music.</p><p>&nbsp; This begs the challenge I mentioned before of which chords in microtonality, while certainly not necessarily as resolved as major chords, ARE resolved enough sounding to work as points of resolution in music...&nbsp; And, best yet, which ones of those are ALSO dissonant enough to work as points of tension IE very flexible &quot;dual purpose&quot; chords.</p><p>B) Use a bunch of more dissonant chords in between each &quot;root&quot; chord that builds tension, but always maintain an average level of tension not too far above the &quot;root&quot; chord&apos;s tension (this can be done via shorter phrasing of extremely dissonant chords, for example).<br/>&nbsp; The tension/phrasing relationship applies for rhythm as well.&nbsp; This is basically a system for arranging what we get from A) intelligently.</p><p>C) The general goal of music is not just to communicate more emotion, but to do so with less processing required per piece of emotional information.</p><p>&nbsp; Thus, using less notes to generate a shifting sense of &quot;root&quot; tones and moods and using motifs but with slight changes that signify change in root, for example, are elegant and virtually ideal.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtually all pop songs (even) seem to have this...you hear/feel more content and mood variation than is actually in the chords...like viewing a constellation and having your mind draw between the dots to make full pictures.&nbsp; A pop song may have 3 chords and a vocal lead...but you may easily (in your head) add chords to make it 6 or 7 to bring out the sense of shifting root tones better as those 3 chords &quot;clearly point at several more&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More complex<br/>pieces of music cater to those on the spectrum of listeners more skilled at digesting music quickly and willing to use a lot more effort in order to get some more emotional content/variety...&nbsp; But still, in general, even a few notes of the most complex piece are &quot;efficient&quot; enough to denote a strong emotion even when standing by themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychoacoustics also seems to come into this: the clearer/easier something is read by the mind in terms of root tone, the more tones you can recognize quickly with less effort.&nbsp; Of course, this doesn&apos;t mean force everything to be consonant in an almost mechanical fashion, but to give yourself more options for chords while staying near the average &quot;root&quot; mood of the piece of music you are composing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far as determining Tonal Gravitation, Critical Band Dissonance, sense of root and Virtual Pitch...I&apos;ve come to the conclusion A LOT OF IT VARIES WIDELY BETWEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE.&nbsp; At best, these theories give us some clues as to what qualifies in A) as a &quot;dual purpose chord&quot; and some sense of where the root is (although, again, even that perception can vary widely per person).</p><p>But what, perhaps, does not vary widely is</p><p>A) How much TONAL COLOR a piece has (IE sense of different roots)<br/>B) How much PLAYFULNESS a piece has between switching tonal colors and rhythms EASILY AKA without requiring much effort of the listener to follow the music.<br/>C) How much complexity can be allowed without making the dissonance (or consonance!) of the music sway too far from it&apos;s original &quot;root&quot; theme.</p><p>&nbsp; And these, I believe, is where microtonality can truly give us many more options virtually all listeners can agree on as valuable.</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!
