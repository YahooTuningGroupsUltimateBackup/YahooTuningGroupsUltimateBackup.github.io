Experiencing lean times from the<br/>excesses and bloated financial expectations of the early seventies,<br/>major record companies tightened their belts, investing in nothing but<br/>sure-bet megagroups or their clones. Free-form FM radio died and<br/>programming fell completely under the control of paid &quot;consultants&quot;<br/>who dictated what musical mush would yield the maximum number of<br/>listeners. Under these conditions, musicians even marginally outside<br/>the plain vanilla mainstream had no choice but to create and circulate<br/>their music via self-developed means and channels.</p><p>Equally significant during this period, technologies emerged which<br/>allowed musicians to create increasingly sophisticated recordings<br/>without relying on large commercial studios. Audio cassettes and<br/>recorders developed into a surprisingly high-fidelity medium and<br/>provided an accessible means of distributing independent music.<br/>Musician-produced recordings have since thrived in an environment of<br/>four-track cassette portastudios, affordable synthesizers with<br/>remarkably detailed sound, digital delay and reverb units, sampling<br/>machines, and of course the Musical Instrument Digital Interface<br/>(MIDI). Along with digital audio technologies, the much-lauded<br/>phenomenon of MIDI has brought equipment costs down and allowed<br/>greatly enhanced compatibility between instruments, processors, and<br/>even recording machines.</p><p>Being an &quot;electronic musician&quot; and shameless tech-head, I might be<br/>expected to join the ranks of those praising such developments to the<br/>heavens. But since I consider myself a troublemaker first and a<br/>musician second, and considering the fact that there appear to be more<br/>than enough praise-singers here and about, you&apos;ll have to indulge my<br/>playing devil&apos;s advocate in the present instance. My task here is to<br/>examine the neglected underside of these developments.</p><p>What underside? Since hardware has only become<br/>&quot;faster-cheaper-better,&quot; and standards for equipment compatibility and<br/>control have exceeded any expectations, one may well wonder what there<br/>is to bitch about. Ten years ago independent musicians certainly found<br/>life more difficult and more expensive. In the area of electronic<br/>music, synthesizers were only slowly coming to programmability; one<br/>might work for hours to attain a particular sound on a<br/>patch-cord-style machine, and have only a dim possibility of<br/>recreating it with any accuracy at a later time. Such synths were<br/>typically monophonic, time-consuming to program, bulky, and pricy. The<br/>workhorse home&quot; multi-track tape recorder at the time, the Teac 3440,<br/>was considerably more costly than later portastudio-type machines, and<br/>of course additionally required an external mixing board. As far as<br/>the most essential sound processor--reverb--the situation was even<br/>worse; manufacturers continually struggled to produce the least<br/>crappy-sounding spring reverberation, few having much success, and not<br/>many musicians self-producing their recordings could afford the cost<br/>or space requirements of the much-preferred plate reverbs. In<br/>retrospect it all seems to have been unbearably difficult; every<br/>production was a challenge to one&apos;s resourcefulness and innovative<br/>craftiness. Many times things seemed held together with spit and<br/>exhibited a fidelity to match, by today&apos;s standards. But at least in<br/>the days of modular and other non-programmable synthesizers, we didn&apos;t<br/>turn on the radio and hear the same patch over and over again. The<br/>3440 did and still does offer superior sound to any cassette<br/>portastudio. And as far as reverb units...well, that one is a bit<br/>tougher to justify, but let&apos;s at least say that the truly adventurous<br/>who built their own plates or pressed unoccupied bathrooms and<br/>stairwells into service certainly had something special to show for<br/>their efforts.</p><p>Today, of course, much higher sound fidelity is attainable, we have<br/>access to more, ah, beautiful sounds, the price of outfitting a home<br/>studio is within reason for many, and naturally of greatest importance<br/>these days--it is all so much easier. The current hot item is the<br/>&quot;workstation,&quot; a piece of gear incorporating keyboard, multiple-voice<br/>synthesizer, realistic sampled instruments (usually including several<br/>full drum kits), delay, reverb, and other processors, and a digital<br/>multi-track sequencer/recorder. As the ads say, &quot;Now you can get down<br/>to the real business of making music,&quot; the dirty job of creating sound<br/>and schemes for assembling it into unique music now out of the way!</p><p>But it seems that innovation is now an optional ingredient rather than<br/>a necessary one. Current digital wonders are relatively cheap and easy<br/>to use, but without the requirement of innovative approaches, many<br/>musicians leave out the innovation part altogether. The most frequent<br/>and damning criticism of today&apos;s &quot;home studio&quot; music productions is<br/>that they all sound so similar. With vastly increased possibilities,<br/>and manufacturers telling us that we are &quot;limited only by our<br/>imagination,&quot; why does one hear so many independent cassette<br/>recordings that sound virtually identical?</p><p>The fact is that most of our expanded technical capability has come<br/>about through that mixed blessing of modern civilization, mass<br/>production. The palm-top digital reverb unit only exists because the<br/>potential sale of a hundred thousand of the little suckers subsidized<br/>the whole affair. (I own one myself, but what are the implications of<br/>a dozen or so sounds spread amongst tens of thousands of users?) Out<br/>of necessity large corporations design products for Mr. Average<br/>User--as average and bland as possible, in fact. But does that<br/>describe you and your music? If so, you&apos;ve probably read too far<br/>already.</p><p>Perhaps most curious of all is that musicians not only accept this<br/>middle-of-the-roadism, but often don&apos;t even meet manufacturers&apos; modest<br/>expectations of them. A common story in synthesizer repair departments<br/>is that units brought in for work frequently contain only the original<br/>factory preset sounds, the famously creative musicians never having<br/>even tried to come up with any of their own. And the manufacturers<br/>listen! Now we find, in many cases, newer models of equipment which,<br/>rather than employing more developed soundcrafting possibilities,<br/>actually revert to less capable (easier to use) versions, even of<br/>inferior sound quality.</p><p>I have met musicians who own home studios which almost literally<br/>contain &quot;one of everything.&quot; And within each of the devices which are<br/>programmable, guess what you&apos;ll find? Yup--factory junk, milquetoast<br/>sounds for milquetoast music. My argument here is that one does not<br/>need to be a major stockholder in Yamaha or Roland to produce<br/>interesting, vital music. (They even dragged me into it for a couple<br/>of years, promising heaven-with-a-MIDI-cord-attached, but I got wise.)<br/>We don&apos;t need one of everything, we don&apos;t need stacks of MIDI synths<br/>and $10,000 samplers. We need innovation and original approaches.<br/>Don&apos;t use factory synthesizer patches; don&apos;t buy factory disks for<br/>your sampler--it was made to use your sounds. Look into &quot;obsolete&quot;<br/>gear like non-programmable synths, ring modulators, and analog delays.<br/>Use a transducer driver to run your voice through a suspended<br/>refrigerator rack on its way to your vocal track, put some alligator<br/>clips on your guitar strings, use a mixer to add more regeneration to<br/>effects than the manufacturer would normally allow.</p><p>What&apos;s most difficult to obtain today is interesting music. Been to a<br/>record store lately? I haven&apos;t found much. Oh, and one last thing:<br/>Anybody have a spring reverb for sale?</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=15746 href="#15746">ðŸ”—</a>M.

But I do not share your pessimism, nor do I share the pessimism<br/>of Moore and Myers. First of all, MIDI is nothing more or less than a<br/>standard for digital control of electronic instruments. The standard defines<br/>little more than the pitches and durations of notes, with enough flexibility<br/>to allow, for example, pitch bending. There is little difference between a<br/>MIDI file and a printed score for a conventional ensemble or orchestra.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve weighed in with my own view that while greatly liberating -- and<br/>&gt; especially so for the microtonalist -- I also almost always find MIDI<br/>&gt; realizations gnawingly problematic as well. It is my opinion that most<br/>&gt; of these &quot;problems&quot; stem from the exclusive and rote use of<br/>&gt; uninteresting canned instrument simulations, resulting in varying<br/>&gt; degrees of static (and generally unlistenable) realizations.</p><p>The state of the art in emulation of well-known instruments (flute,<br/>clarinet, violin, piano, etc.) is well beyond where it was 20 years ago, but<br/>it is still fairly easy for a sophisticated listener to tell whether a<br/>recording was produced by a real musician on a real instrument or on a<br/>digitally controlled simulation. Yet we move closer to this goal, if indeed<br/>it is a goal, every time a faster signal processing chip is created, and it<br/>is only a matter of time before we reach it. Would I buy a completely<br/>synthesized performance of, say, the Shostakovich 4th Symphony? If the<br/>person or team that did the synthesis provided an equivalent musical<br/>experience to an orchestral performance, I would. I chose this example<br/>because it strikes me as an extraordinarily difficult task, both to<br/>synthesize this work and to perform it well with a real-world orchestra. It<br/>is rarely performed because of its length and difficulty.</p><p>On a smaller scale, I rather like the &quot;experimental animal&quot; I have been<br/>working with in the MPEG-4 Structured Audio example set, a piano piece by<br/>Granados called &quot;El Pelele&quot;. When played with a rather simple sample-based<br/>piano simulator coded in the MPEG-4 SAOL language, driven by a MIDI file, it<br/>sounds better than the Windows Media Player MIDI piano. Does it sound like a<br/>concert grand? Not really ... not as bad as Crazy Otto, though :-). A little<br/>more code, a faster computer, a higher sample rate, a wider D/A converter --<br/>all these would make it sound better and raise the cost.</p><p>&gt; The strengths of MIDI realizations are all stacked in the direction of<br/>&gt; ease of execution and realization, but this is all at the expense of<br/>&gt; interesting, detailed sonic tapestries... it&apos;s not impossible to<br/>&gt; overcome these inherent obstacles, but a piece of music/composer has<br/>&gt; to either work eighty-seven times harder to do so, or strategically or<br/>&gt; intuitively point the music towards the inherent strengths and<br/>&gt; characteristic compass of the medium. (Luck, talent, and a strong<br/>&gt; &quot;personality&quot; go a ways as well of course...)</p><p>Part of this is the &quot;pitch and duration&quot; mindset that MIDI inherited from<br/>Western music. Trevor Wishart argues elegantly against this mindset in &quot;On<br/>Sonic Art&quot;; it should be noted that his music is &quot;musique concrete&quot; realized<br/>on a digital computer rather than with tape recorders as in the past. It<br/>seems to me, though, that the concept of &quot;notes&quot; with a definite pitch and<br/>duration is rather essential in microtonal music. It&apos;s not clear to me how<br/>one combines microtonality and &quot;musique concrete&quot;; since I am interested in<br/>both of them this is a problem I will need to solve. My solution may or may<br/>not involve MIDI, since I&apos;m not a keyboard player.</p><p>&gt; On the large scale, i.e., pop<br/>&gt; music, things got worse before they got better... but in the curious<br/>&gt; world of the modern DIY home-composer, things would appear to be dead<br/>&gt; smack in the middle of the finding-the-way, worse phase... note<br/>&gt; Moore&apos;s parenthetical, &quot;Debussy wrote somewhere that he could spend<br/>&gt; days trying to decide between two piano chords&quot;, quote in the<br/>&gt; following &quot;The Recording Studio as Musical Instrument&quot; article...<br/>&gt; shouldn&apos;t the same care and important deliberations go into the sonic<br/>&gt; carriers of ones ideas? I believe so.--</p><p>The DIY home-composer is not limited to MIDI by any stretch of the<br/>imagination. There are wonderful tools out there like CSound, CDP and many<br/>others. The learning curves are steep, and the discipline of programming is<br/>vastly different from the discipline of music.</p><p>I recall many years ago, a friend of mine was writing a rock opera. He<br/>managed to borrow an Arp 2600 from a musician, and the two of us sat down<br/>with it and a tape recorder. Basically, we just poked buttons, tried this<br/>and that, twiddled knobs, and captured about six hours of tape. Then the two<br/>of us gave the Arp back to its owner and set up a pair of tape recorders and<br/>a splicing block. The final result was, if I remember correctly, about 11<br/>minutes long.</p><p>If I were going to do something like this today, my approach would not be<br/>fundamentally different. I&apos;d sit down with the composer at my laptop, fire<br/>up CSound, load some of the sample instruments from &quot;The CSound Book&quot; and<br/>start poking keys and adjusting parameters. Rather than capturing the output<br/>as wave files (10 megabytes a minute!) I&apos;d simply check the CSound code into<br/>my revision control system and play the snippets we liked back with Perl<br/>scripts.</p><p>At some point, there would be pieces of audio on the hard drive or on the<br/>CD-RW drive, and eventually the entire piece would be assembled and<br/>converted to a WAV file. Instead of the ARP there is computer-generated and<br/>transformed audio; instead of the tape there are hard disk files. But the<br/>process is the same ... play with the instrument, explore what it can do,<br/>keep careful records of what you liked and didn&apos;t like, play some more,<br/>transform the sounds, play some more, have fun with it, use an infinite<br/>amount of recording medium and then distill everything down to the music you<br/>want.<br/>--<br/>M.

Sure, Dan and others &quot;dumped&quot; on MIDI<br/>&gt; instrumental realizations, but, for me, that wasn&apos;t the gist of the<br/>&gt; articles...</p><p>Well, using studio techniques aka musique concrete certainly resonates with<br/>me, since in my early days as a composer it was all I had. My three biggest<br/>early influences were Lejaren Hiller (algorithmic composition), Harry Partch<br/>(y&apos;all know his stuff better than I do :-) and Alwin Nikolais (dance set to<br/>musique concrete). Musique concrete has been around a long time, though --<br/>since the early 1950s. Musique concrete / studio techniques have been a part<br/>of American popular music since David Seville aka Ross Bagdasarian (the<br/>*father* of the current one!) created the Chipmunks!</p><p>&gt; Just as amusing, and actually true... is the fact that many of the<br/>&gt; poppers really feel that &quot;classical music&quot; is behind the times, in<br/>&gt; the use of the recording studio as a &quot;classical snapshot&quot; and no<br/>&gt; &quot;plastic&quot; manipulation of the medium through electronics.</p><p>Of course classical music is behind the times :-). I went to a board meeting<br/>of our classical station, KBPS-FM, last week. They play more 20th century<br/>music than any other classical station I&apos;ve ever heard. Still, what the<br/>audience wants is Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner and of course<br/>Vivaldi and Copland. These are the people who can hear the difference<br/>between a vinyl recording and a CD and prefer the vinyl. These are the<br/>people who heat their homes in the winter with vacuum tube stereo equipment.<br/>These are the people who spend more money on Shostakovich CDs than they do<br/>on lunch. These are the people who would prefer to hear a monaural Toscanini<br/>Beethoven symphony remastered with a high-frequency cutoff at 10 KHz than an<br/>uninspired performance recorded with perfect audio quality.</p><p>And they tend to run away full speed ahead when &quot;challenged&quot; with even mild<br/>experiments like Varese. There are composers who can write for these people<br/>and still be true to their own microtonal or experimental muses; Lou<br/>Harrison is one that immediately comes to mind. I don&apos;t write music for<br/>conventional instruments and ensembles because I haven&apos;t put in the study<br/>necessary to do it.</p><p>If I wanted to, I suppose I could con some code into doing it, sketching out<br/>the performance with *shudder* MIDI emulations of conventional instruments,<br/>converting the finished MIDI score into a printed one. This would have the<br/>advantage of letting people know what the piece was supposed to sound like<br/>without having to read the score. This is something that couldn&apos;t be done 25<br/>years ago -- sketch out a conventional instrumental piece with electronic<br/>emulations. The best most composers could do was sketch out their pieces on<br/>the piano, making it virtually necessary for the composer to be a pianist.<br/>I&apos;m not a pianist; I studied it for a year when I was very young and never<br/>progressed beyond &quot;Chopsticks&quot; and &quot;The Marine Hymn&quot;.</p><p>As far as I&apos;m concerned, with the exception of &quot;Switched on Bach&quot;, there<br/>wouldn&apos;t even *be* experimental / electronic music today outside of academia<br/>if it had not been for the adoption of first the synthesizer and later MIDI<br/>by the rock / pop culture. And just as &quot;mainstream&quot; classical composers all<br/>over the world incorporated jazz in the early and middle 20th century,<br/>&quot;mainstream&quot; composers today are incorporating rock into their music. It is<br/>an exciting time to be alive and to be composing, and I for one am very glad<br/>the pop culture kept the synthesizer and MIDI alive for me to use.<br/>--<br/>M.

The<br/>first half of the century saw the development of the recording<br/>industry, and with it an elaboration of the path from composer to<br/>listener, and a redistribution of power amongst new personnel and<br/>technologies. The second half of the century has seen a similar<br/>redefinition of the musical instrument: the physics of plucked strings<br/>and vibrating reeds has been overtaken by electronic manipulation of<br/>every link in the sonic chain that stretches between finger and ear.<br/>Such dramatic changes have affected the way music is made and the way<br/>music is heard. They have altered our very sense of what music is and<br/>can be.</p><p>Thomas Edison did not invent the phonograph, contrary to the popular<br/>American myth. Rather, as he had for so many other of his<br/>&quot;inventions&quot;, he recognized the consumer potential of an untried<br/>machine. Various technologies for sound recording and reproduction had<br/>been under development in several countries for several years --<br/>Edison picked the one that seemed most practical and profitable,<br/>tweaked it in his lab, and introduced it to the American public. With<br/>a foresight worthy of a modern day computer mogul, he realized that<br/>the key to financial success with the phonograph lay in controlling<br/>both the hardware (the recorders and players) and the software (the<br/>recordings), so he manufactured both. Partially deaf as a result of a<br/>punch to the head as a child , Edison claimed to have no ear for, or<br/>interest in, music. He saw the phonograph record as a sonic autograph,<br/>and the player as a way to hear the speaking voices of famous persons.<br/>Musical recordings were initially introduced as a novelty, and were<br/>not taken seriously by Edison for years. It would seem to have been a<br/>case of right technology, wrong vision.</p><p>Edison did, however, have a canny insight into the effect the<br/>phonograph would have on the act of listening. By choosing to record<br/>that most personal of sounds, the spoken voice, he anticipated a<br/>fundamental change in the social role of music that took place in the<br/>course of the twentieth century -- the shift from music as a<br/>predominately public activity to music as a predominately private<br/>activity. If the voice of President William McKinley did not become a<br/>valued possession in the home of every American, the voice of Caruso<br/>did. Professional music left the concert hall and entered the parlor.<br/>Putting on one&apos;s own choice of a record, to listen to alone, replaced<br/>attending a concert with the masses. And putting on a record in the<br/>presence of friends replaced playing in a quartet with them.</p><p>The phonograph had a precedent in the 19th century popularity of the<br/>piano, which linked the virtuoso on stage and the amateur at home: the<br/>only difference was the time you spent practicing. The phonograph was<br/>an even greater leveler: a seemingly infinite array of instruments and<br/>ghost performers at your fingertips and no need to practice. Perhaps<br/>this was too strong an affront to the late Victorian work ethic,<br/>because the phonograph was immediately relegated to the status of<br/>furniture rather than being treated as a musical instrument -- a<br/>situation which remained unchallenged, with a few exceptions such as<br/>John Cage&apos;s &quot;Imaginary Landscapes #1&quot; (1939), until rise of the<br/>&quot;turntable artist&quot; in the 1980s. Society was split into two distinct<br/>categories: a small group of professionals who made music and the<br/>large mass of society that consumed it. The phonograph represented a<br/>milestone in the gradual distancing of people from the act of making<br/>music -- a process that had been taking place since the rise of art<br/>music in Europe. Edison&apos;s invention effectively replaced the Victorian<br/>amateur with the modern consumer.</p><p>Recording music is no more &quot;natural&quot; a process than taking a<br/>photograph or making a film. Much effort and artifice goes into making<br/>a recording seem effortless and artless. Each new generation of<br/>recording technology is touted for its verisimilitude, its accuracy,<br/>its transparency. In the CD era it is hard to believe that anybody<br/>took these claims seriously at the time of the Edison cylinder. The<br/>ever-savvy Edison , when introducing the phonograph, set up two<br/>important support systems: the marketing forces required to convince<br/>the public that a seat in front of this small box with a horn was<br/>indistinguishable from one in a box at La Scala, and the recording<br/>technicians who pushed feverishly at the limits of the technology in<br/>pursuit of this ideal.</p><p>The technicians included design engineers who sought to improve the<br/>existing technology, and recording engineers and producers who made<br/>the best of what they had. The latter two rapidly rose in importance<br/>and profoundly changed the distribution of power within the chain from<br/>composer to consumer. They were to recorded music as the conductor was<br/>to orchestral music, and not since the emergence of the conductor as a<br/>charismatic figure had the singular authority of the composer been so<br/>seriously undermined. The engineer and producer were responsible for<br/>making the recording sound like the &quot;original&quot; music, the composer&apos;s<br/>auditory vision, but they also influenced the kind of music that made<br/>it to the record&apos;s surface, and many of its formal and structural<br/>details. They became the orchestrators of recorded music -- they knew<br/>what sounded good on record -- and for the same reason they became its<br/>censors. And because the producer was also &quot;the man who wrote the<br/>checks&quot;, he soon became the single most important person in the<br/>recording chain.</p><p>The film composers of the 1930s and 1940s were the first to learn the<br/>technique of &quot;studio scoring&quot;: they wrote music that was only heard<br/>over loudspeakers. They were followed by the Tin Pan Alley<br/>songwriters, who understood that a two and a half minute song on one<br/>side of a 78 was a much more effective use of the medium than a<br/>symphony chopped up on a dropping stack of ten. But it was Phil<br/>Spector who perfected the art of making music for vinyl. By<br/>positioning himself as a producer first and foremost, in the middle of<br/>the recording chain, Spector extended his power and influence over the<br/>entire production process: he wrote the tunes and lyrics, did the<br/>arrangements, picked the musicians and singers, invented new recording<br/>techniques, owned interest in the companies that pressed and<br/>distributed the disks. Not until a record had proven itself a hit did<br/>he bother to assemble, for the sake of live shows, a group to match<br/>the name on the label. Total control.</p><p>Or was it? The recording age saw the emergence of two other<br/>significant new powers in the musical machine: the disk jockey and the<br/>consumer. Thanks to radio, the record may have been one of the first<br/>products to act as its own advertisement, but records didn&apos;t play<br/>themselves on air, disk jockeys did. One DJ was worth a thousand<br/>listeners, more or less, depending on personality, wattage and<br/>demographics, and thus he was a force to be reckoned with, courted,<br/>and bought, if necessary. On radio, and later in a booth or on stage,<br/>the DJ was acknowledged as the virtuoso of the turntable -- as much<br/>for his encyclopedic knowledge of recorded repertoire as for his<br/>physical touch. Any vestige of the musical instrument that remained in<br/>the phonograph was appropriated by the DJ.</p><p>The downside of making records, record players and radios affordable<br/>to the masses was that the masses could pick and choose with careless<br/>ease amongst a myriad of musical offerings. Flipping off a record<br/>midway through a side, or scanning the radio stations, had none of the<br/>social stigma or economic recklessness of walking out on a concert.<br/>The phonograph and radio may have been no match for the piano in terms<br/>of musical expressiveness, but they did give the user an unprecedented<br/>degree of control over his or her musical environment. Feedback from<br/>listeners to record companies was quickly formalized into the &quot;charts&quot;<br/>that continue to drive record marketing today. Baroque and Classical<br/>composers survived by winning the patronage of a wealthy few; now the<br/>fickle buying habits of the man and woman on the street held sway over<br/>composers and steered musical style.</p><p>By 1960 the traditional, pre-recording model of musical production and<br/>transmission had been exploded. The locus of power had shifted away<br/>from the composer and the germ of the musical idea and was distributed<br/>amongst specialist technicians and middle men (arrangers, producers,<br/>engineers, disk jockeys, A&amp;R men) and consumers. The effect of the<br/>&quot;British Invasion&quot; of popular music in the early sixties was to kill<br/>off the American Tin Pan Alley/Phil Spector tradition of<br/>producer-centered authority, and to establish a new class of composers<br/>who recognized the importance of recording studio literacy. The<br/>Beatles and the Rolling Stones may have started out as bar bands but<br/>they came of age in the studio under the guidance of gifted producers<br/>such as George Martin. Production vision became as essential to a<br/>songwriter as melodies and lyrics; studio technique as critical for a<br/>band as instrumental competence. Recording technology evolved quickly,<br/>and experimentation extended its application beyond the direct,<br/>accurate transference of sound to tape. The recording studio became<br/>both a musical instrument in its own right and a compositional tool.<br/>After Sgt Pepper the challenge was not how to replicate a live<br/>performance on record, but how to replicate the record in live<br/>performance.</p><p>The notion of the studio as instrument had been pioneered years<br/>earlier in European electronic music studios -- rooms full of abducted<br/>electronic test equipment and spinoff radio technology. Pop music gave<br/>the idea public visibility and commercial viability. The next step was<br/>for RCA Laboratories to formalize the concept by transforming the room<br/>full of electronic objects into an electronic object the size of a<br/>room: the synthesizer. Taking its cue from the increasing influence of<br/>electronic technology over the transformation of acoustic sound into<br/>recorded product, RCA thought to dispense with the acoustic sources --<br/>and the musician&apos;s hourly wage -- and to replace them with electronic<br/>ones. This pursuit of the union musician&apos;s worst nightmare was<br/>ultimately fruitless, but synthesizer design succeeded in altering our<br/>understanding of the &quot;musical instrument&quot; in ways parallel to those by<br/>which the phonograph had altered the social uses of music: it exploded<br/>the chain of command.</p><p>Synthesizers -- from RCA to Buchla, Moog, Arp, and Serge to Oberheim<br/>to Yamaha and Roland -- have been based on the premise that musical<br/>sound could be analyzed, broken down into modular components, and<br/>reconstructed (synthesized) by electronic circuits that emulated those<br/>modules. It is a seductive idea: in place of dozens of different<br/>instruments and skilled players, a single technician could arrange a<br/>handful of electronic oscillators, filters, amplifiers, and control<br/>circuits to conjure up any existing instrument or even some novel<br/>hybrid combination of instruments. But the greatest implication of the<br/>synthesizer lay not in how well it replicated sound -- some 35 years<br/>later traditional synthesis methods have yet to mimic acoustic<br/>instruments accurately enough to pass close scrutiny -- but in the<br/>fact that for the first time in the history of instrument design the<br/>causal properties of physical acoustics could be ignored.</p><p>Synthesizer modules were based not on modeling the physics of the<br/>excitation and transmission of sound , but rather on a description of<br/>the resulting sound itself. Without the mechanical causality built<br/>into buzzing reeds on resonant tubes and bowed strings on soundboards,<br/>synthesizers needed a system of interconnecting and controlling the<br/>modules. The closest thing to a standard in the first generation of<br/>commercially viable synthesizers was Voltage Control. Briefly, all<br/>modules in a Voltage Controlled synthesizer were designed so that any<br/>adjustable parameter, such as the pitch of an oscillator, could be<br/>externally controlled by a variable DC voltage. In a Voltage<br/>Controlled Oscillator, for example, increasing the voltage applied to<br/>the frequency control input from one volt to 2two volts would raise<br/>the pitch one octave. Thus a keyboard might put out a control voltage<br/>that increases by one-twelfth volt with each key that, when applied to<br/>the Oscillator, would produce an equal tempered scale; or a second,<br/>very slow sine wave oscillator could vary the pitch of an<br/>audio-frequency oscillator just enough to produce something akin to<br/>vibrato. Since the output of any module was a fluctuating voltage of<br/>some kind, Voltage Control permitted any module&apos;s output to be<br/>connected to any control input.</p><p>More interesting than merely reversing the analysis process in order<br/>to re-synthesize a known instrument was the possibility of rearranging<br/>the modules with seemingly infinite variety, producing permutational<br/>richness quite beyond the limitations of lips, strings, reeds, and<br/>fingers. &quot;Patchcord music&quot; was born of throwing away the keyboard and<br/>interconnecting modules according to systems that were no longer<br/>imitative. The 1960s model of analysis/synthesis failed, but its<br/>electronic building blocks acquired a structural meaning independent<br/>of that original model.</p><p>While Voltage Control technology lay at the heart of most early<br/>commercial synthesizers, there were variations in its implementations<br/>that made it difficult to interconnect the machines of different<br/>manufacturers. Voltage Control was accepted widely not as an &quot;industry<br/>standard&quot; but simply because it made modular design possible within a<br/>single instrument or a product line. Initially, company strategists<br/>encouraged incompatibility: it could provide patent protection or fend<br/>off infringement liability, and it was thought to insure customer<br/>loyalty and repeat purchases. But in the early 1980s a handful of<br/>manufacturers saw the potential benefits of implementing an<br/>industry-wide control standard that would permit total compatibility,<br/>and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was born.</p><p>The inspiration had come from the booming personal computer industry.<br/>As microprocessors and memory became cheaper and more powerful,<br/>synthesizer manufacturers started to incorporate them into instruments<br/>for control and storage functions. For a synthesizer&apos;s microprocessor<br/>to control another synthesizer&apos;s sound instead of only its own all<br/>that was needed was an extra pair of jacks and a little bit of<br/>programming -- communication protocols were already well established<br/>in the computer world. Furthermore, the growth of the computer<br/>industry had shattered long-held assumptions about the importance of<br/>proprietary standards, and had demonstrated the profitability of open<br/>architecture and third-party developers. Total compatibility meant<br/>more sales for everyone, seemingly at the expense of no-one.</p><p>MIDI employs a serial communication protocol such as that used between<br/>computers and peripherals. It requires a microprocessor in both the<br/>controlling device (such as a keyboard) and the controlled device<br/>(such as a sound generating module), but the cost of such a<br/>microprocessor is negligeable. The MIDI language permits the free<br/>exchange of a large amount of information describing the articulation<br/>of musical events over time. The language was designed by a committee<br/>of representatives from synthesizer manufacturers -- not by musicians<br/>and certainly not in consultation with any members of the avant<br/>garde -- and it reflects a businessman&apos;s assumptions of what<br/>information is musically important. Thus it is a bit like Esperanto:<br/>not beautiful, not natural, but useful, logical and expandable.</p><p>This expandability is important. The microprocessors required to<br/>transmit, receive, and interpret MIDI information were initially<br/>underutilized (rather like the VW Beetle engine block, which remained<br/>externally unchanged between 1955 and 1966, but internally was stroked<br/>and bored until the horsepower of that very conservative design had<br/>doubled.) MIDI initially clumped the modules of electronic music into<br/>two groups: controllers and sound modules. But by placing a<br/>user-programmable computer between the controller and the controlled,<br/>composers could turbocharge MIDI and introduce a whole new order of<br/>musical possibilities.</p><p>The first commercial programs to take advantage of MIDI&apos;s<br/>expandability were utilitarian tools that might best be described as<br/>&quot;organizers&quot;: sequencers (with which you record and edit &quot;scores&quot; for<br/>controlling MIDI sound modules -- sort of digital piano rolls), voice<br/>editing software (which lets you tweak sounds in the comparative<br/>luxury of the computer screen rather than using the synthesizer&apos;s<br/>knobs and curt displays), and librarian programs (for backing up and<br/>restoring a synthesizer&apos;s programmable variables.) The second wave of<br/>products included what might be called &quot;re-organizers,&quot; programs that<br/>interpreted and transformed the MIDI data in various ways:<br/>arpeggiators, accompanists, variation generators, improvisors. These<br/>represent the most recent stage in the dismantling and reconstruction<br/>of the musical instrument.</p><p>By placing a decision-making device between the player&apos;s controller<br/>and his sound output, electronic instruments have progressed still<br/>further from their acoustic antecedents. The composer can now re-enter<br/>the musical chain post-score, post-player, and immediately preceding<br/>actual sound, by programming the computer to filter out unwanted<br/>actions by players. Or the computer can change or accompany the<br/>player&apos;s activity according to algorithms specified by the composer or<br/>performer but beyond his or her direct control. Or it can act like the<br/>server in a computer network, co-ordinating the actions of several<br/>players and controlling the sounds of multiple synthesizers. Inserting<br/>a computer in the MIDI chain can infuse a performer&apos;s instrument with<br/>the characteristics of a score, an orchestrator, an orchestra, an<br/>accompanist, an improvisor, a conductor, a teacher, a censor, a<br/>producer. In short, it opens up the musical instrument -- previously<br/>thought of as the self-contained final link between player and<br/>sound -- to incorporate any stage of the industrial chain of music<br/>production.</p><p>MIDI&apos;s transformation of the musical instrument has had a profound<br/>effect on the nature of both electronic music and the musical<br/>instrument industry. A technology once intimately linked to the avant<br/>garde has now become a mainstay of commercial pop. By creating an<br/>instrument structure that parallels the production chain of a<br/>recording, the locus of power can be shifted easily to suit the<br/>musical ideology. Control over the end product can rest in the hand of<br/>a virtuoso player touching a key, in the sequences prepared by a<br/>producer, in software that improvises, in the studio automation<br/>package controlled by the mixing engineer, in a technician&apos;s samples<br/>or voices patches, or in a score embedded in a program. And the style<br/>of the music reflects the center of authority. The charmingly<br/>shambolic performances by the electronic music group the Hub result<br/>from a collective computer network where no-one has direct control.<br/>Composer and trombonist George Lewis shares the stage with a digital<br/>alter ego, which improvises well because Lewis has taught it how, and<br/>Lewis improvises brilliantly. Ed Tomney is woken up each morning by a<br/>computer-generated voice that tells him what kind of music to write<br/>that day. In a more commercial realm, the precision of House music is<br/>built on power sequencing, while Rap makes extensive use of witty<br/>sampler appropriation and the speaker-popping kick drum sound of the<br/>venerable Roland TR707 drum machine. After MIDI, electronic<br/>instruments are no longer contained instruments, and electronic music<br/>is no longer a contained style.</p><p>Starting with David Tudor in the 1950s, there has been a long<br/>tradition of &quot;homemade&quot; electronic musical instruments, but before<br/>MIDI successful commercial production of home designs was limited to<br/>those with the financial backing needed to underwrite the considerable<br/>tool-up costs of hardware development. MIDI, however, divided the<br/>musical instrument and its manufacturing into three distinct parts:<br/>controllers, software, and sound modules. Controllers and sound<br/>modules incorporate both hardware and software, while software is just<br/>software. Software isn&apos;t any easier to write than hardware is to<br/>build, but it can be cheaper. It can be produced on a very modest<br/>scale, free of the demands of investors who want a product&apos;s<br/>eccentricities worked out along with its bugs. The 1980s saw several<br/>composers market programs imbued with their own distinctive<br/>personalities (most notably Joel Chadabe&apos;s M and Jam Factory, and<br/>Laurie Spiegel&apos;s Music Mouse.) Ironically, although MIDI was developed<br/>as a convenience by and for large companies at the point when<br/>electronic instruments began to acquire serious commercial value, it<br/>also permitted the flourishing of artist-run cottage industries.</p><p>STEIM has, for 25 years, operated as a kind of subsidized cottage<br/>industry. Our status as a government-supported foundation has given us<br/>the freedom to extend non-commercial, artist-inspired design beyond<br/>the software realm into the more cost-intensive, hardware-dependent<br/>projects. Our primary function is serving composers whose needs are<br/>not met by existing commercial products, or whose technical or<br/>financial limitations place their musical vision beyond their grasp.<br/>The emphasis has always been on live performance, and since the advent<br/>of MIDI we have stressed the design of new controllers, which are not<br/>based on the forms of existing instruments the way most commercial<br/>ones are, and the development of software that extends the performer&apos;s<br/>control over complex musical textures.</p><p>The &quot;SensorLab&quot; is the heart of STEIM&apos;s new controller design: a small<br/>microcomputer that reads switches, pots, pressure pads and other<br/>sensors, and translates that information into MIDI data; the<br/>accompanying SPIDER control language lets the user program multiple,<br/>dynamically re-configurable instruments based on a single, economical<br/>hardware core. &quot;Deviator&quot; and &quot;The Lick Machine&quot; are software programs<br/>for interrupting and transforming the MIDI data stream between the<br/>controller and the sound modules. &quot;Deviator&quot; is essentially an effect<br/>processor for MIDI data, producing delays, echoes, offsets, and other<br/>transformations of incoming note and controller information. &quot;The Lick<br/>Machine&quot; maps user defined sequences onto specific notes from the<br/>controller for playback and manipulation by the performer. The &quot;Big<br/>Eye&quot; software transforms a video camera into a contact-free controller<br/>for translating movement and images into MIDI data.</p><p>There is a danger inherent in MIDI&apos;s modularity similar to one that<br/>besets the recording industry: a lack of integration and feedback<br/>between the parts. With the separation of modules it is easy to forget<br/>one musical component while concentrating on another, to forget the<br/>whole while indulging in the parts. Whereas commercial instrument<br/>design usually focuses on sound at the expense of controllers, STEIM<br/>has for many years emphasized controllers and interpretive software.<br/>Mindful of the pitfall of segregation, we have recently embarked on an<br/>ambitious Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project. We are designing a<br/>compact DSP module that will serve not only as a MIDI sound generator,<br/>sampler, and processor, but -- by incorporating elements of the<br/>SensorLab -- will also have direct sensor interfaces allowing it to<br/>serve as the core of a fully integrated electronic instrument. There<br/>are aspects of acoustic instruments that have yet to be adequately<br/>emulated in electronic ones, such as the tactile feedback between a<br/>player&apos;s finger and a stopped vibrating string. We hope that by<br/>combining delicate input sensors into the same hardware/software<br/>package as the sound source we can begin to recreate this kind of<br/>elusive musical touch. This return to a self-sufficient instrument may<br/>seem like a step backward, but it is important to remember that while<br/>this new module will serve as an integrated controller, software<br/>interpreter, and sound module, it will also function as a hub for<br/>communication with external hardware and software. After the<br/>MIDI-based explosion of the instrument, STEIM is now creating<br/>expandable music &quot;kits&quot; that have multiple options for re-assembly.</p><p>So where do we go from here? After the record&apos;s transformation of the<br/>music industry, and electronic music&apos;s transformation of the identity<br/>of the musical instrument, there are still links in the musical chain<br/>that have remained relatively unchanged since the turn of the<br/>century -- most notably the architecture and audience of the concert<br/>hall, the audience at home, and the chamber ensemble. Are there ways<br/>to open these as well, such that we might foster new musical forms?</p><p>Architecture is the final &quot;instrument&quot; in the acoustic chain from a<br/>performer to our ears, imposing its own acoustic signature on the<br/>music played within it, but unlike every other stage in that process<br/>it is invariably inflexible. With the exception of the rather<br/>underutilized performance space at IRCAM in Paris, there are no public<br/>concert halls that permit the real-time transformation of<br/>architectural acoustics. There are obvious economic reasons for this,<br/>in addition to the fact that little music has been written for such<br/>architectural instruments. But such music will not be written until<br/>appropriate performance spaces are more readily available. If music<br/>institutions were to encourage the construction of malleable concert<br/>spaces -- with real-time remote control of shape, reverberation time,<br/>frequency response, and other physical characteristics -- it might<br/>provoke the creation of music of a truly monumental scale.</p><p>The development of architecture for music has closely paralleled the<br/>gradual disappearance of participatory musical events within the<br/>community. Accordingly, the modern concert hall places a passive<br/>audience in fixed seating. Despite the fact that music is a<br/>three-dimensional, moving medium (as Alvin Lucier has eloquently<br/>demonstrated), &quot;serious listening&quot; has become a motionless activity.<br/>Attempts to change this behavior, through interactive audio<br/>installations and non-traditional concert hall design, have been<br/>generally unsuccessful. We are faced with a fundamental attitudinal<br/>difference between the passive and active consumption of music, with<br/>the latter reserved for dance music, a small sector of the<br/>experimental fringe, and musics outside the European classical<br/>tradition. But just as the availability of halls with variable<br/>acoustics might inspire new forms of &quot;architectural music&quot;,<br/>alternative listening environments might encourage more activity on<br/>the part of audiences. Like the nightclubs of the 1980s, a concert<br/>hall could be built not as a single &quot;optimum&quot; space, but as a sequence<br/>of acoustically and electronically linked rooms, each with its own<br/>character and social function. One space might cater to focused<br/>listening and direct visual contact with the players (as in a<br/>traditional concert hall), while another might present the music at an<br/>ambient or even subliminal sound level. More active listeners could<br/>interact directly with the music in &quot;remix rooms&quot;, by adjusting<br/>loudness, mix, and balance to suit individual taste, or wander through<br/>a labyrinth of corridors and small rooms that would acoustically<br/>transform the music more with every stage.</p><p>A similar passivity problem exists with &quot;home audiences&quot;. There has<br/>been little increase in listener activity since the advent of the<br/>record and radio gave the consumer the power to select. Interactive<br/>media such as CD-I are commercially insignificant compared to the<br/>music CD, whose major selling point, I&apos;m sure, is not sound quality<br/>but the fact that you don&apos;t have to turn it over. Even music CDs boast<br/>a degree of interactivity unknown with records or tapes, but what<br/>percentage of listeners bother to program their own sequences or<br/>listen in &quot;shuffle&quot; or random mode? Let&apos;s face it, once beyond passive<br/>listening, we enter the realm of activities where satisfaction is<br/>based on short-term competent task fulfillment. What fulfillment is<br/>there in an alternative sequence of familiar songs? Interaction with<br/>home electronics typically consists of scanning channels with a remote<br/>control or playing video games. Video games emphasize the speed of<br/>hand-eye co-ordination, usually in competition with the computer<br/>itself rather than with other players. Scanning lets the viewer edit<br/>broadcast material to the exact length of his attention span, while<br/>pursuing a futile desire to miss nothing.</p><p>Neither of these two activities seems innately musical, but can we<br/>develop a new form of parlor music based on their motivation? A task<br/>that sits between the passive appreciation of music and the<br/>accessible, if competitive, satisfaction of games? Scanning could be a<br/>useful model. Multi-channel broadcast media carry tremendous amounts<br/>of information that can be used directly in a musical work as sound<br/>material, or can be transformed into structural elements -- for<br/>example, translating the &quot;value&quot; of a given station&apos;s programming into<br/>the amount of time you stay on it before moving on is not far removed<br/>from certain practices of improvisational music.</p><p>Video games stress competition for its own sake, and only secondarily<br/>(if at all) do they have any aesthetic content. A better game model<br/>for music might be bridge. Although competitive, bridge has certain<br/>characteristics that are similar to those of chamber music and<br/>improvisation: it is a group activity (which sets it apart from that<br/>other game commonly linked to music, chess); and it has a social value<br/>beyond pure competition, with a tradition of a foursome playing<br/>together on a regular basis. There are styles, strategies, and<br/>&quot;classic games&quot; -- all contributing to a tradition of theory and<br/>analysis. I could imagine a form of home music evolving like a weekly<br/>bridge game. A cable scanner, an interactive CD, or a computer program<br/>could provide elements of chance, topicality, score, and sound<br/>material. Performances could take place at many different levels of<br/>skill. Performances could be played back later for analysis or passive<br/>listening. The game-like competitiveness could provide the initial<br/>hook for pulling a listener off the couch and activating him or her as<br/>a performer, while the social factor would encourage the<br/>re-integration of musical performance into everyday life.</p><p>Whether this would ever happen depends, of course, not on the will of<br/>any one composer or any four bridge players, but on the constellation<br/>of technology, economy, social norms, and zeitgeist that governs all<br/>cultural developments. Edison&apos;s genius, after all, lay not in<br/>invention, but in a gift for being in the right place, at the right<br/>time, with the right machine.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=15856 href="#15856">ðŸ”—</a>David J.
