As usual<br/>with Johnny&apos;s pieces, there&apos;s a bit of theatre involved. The first violinist<br/>approaches the stage after the piece begins - trespassing on the other<br/>players. All 17 is a beautiful tuning, the 17th harmonic and those<br/>mysterious<br/>neutral thirds.</p><p>Giscinto Scelsi, String Quartet No. 5: more equal temperament fun, 96tet I<br/>think.<br/>I kinda missed out on this one, after having a conversation during<br/>intermission,<br/>I was making notes. Before I knew what happened, the Scelsi was over.</p><p>Charles Ives, String Quartet No. 2: although I really liked the AFMM version<br/>The Unanswered Question that was performed a few years ago, I&apos;m not a big<br/>fan of Ives.<br/>Performing the 2nd String Qt. in Ives&apos; extended Pythagorean tuning really<br/>brought the<br/>work to life.</p><p>A great concert, I liked the Johnston and Reinhard the best. A nice crowd<br/>too,<br/>an appearance by JR on WNYCs New Sounds the previous evening probably<br/>helped.</p><p><a href="http://wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/episodes/03072003">http://wnyc.org/shows/newsounds/episodes/03072003</a></p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
