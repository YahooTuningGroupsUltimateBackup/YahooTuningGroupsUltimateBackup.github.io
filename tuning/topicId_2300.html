I just sat through a lecture last week where I spent the<br/>whole time trying to calculate 2^65536 (2&amp;5) on paper. Of course, by the end<br/>of class I had only the lowest five digits (65536, interestingly enough) and<br/>I determined that it would take me no less than 87 years to figure out the<br/>rest. (The calculater on my computer can do it in 2.5 seconds. Of course, I<br/>was originally interested in 2&amp;65536, which would be ludicrous to find out<br/>with any machine. At any rate, now that I think about it, the last five<br/>digits to 2&amp;65536 are 65536. In fact, the last five digits to any superpower<br/>of 2 where the superexponent is greater than 3 are 65536. Strange.)</p><p>Sarn&apos;s Reply:</p><p>Yes, as J.B. Haldans said:&quot;Not only is the Universe weirder than we think,<br/>it&apos;s weirder than we CAN think&quot;.<br/>I agree, but what may be even weirder is a thing called &quot;The Polyverse&quot;.</p><p>At the Big Bang (TIME=0------&gt;TIME=10^-43), there is evidence that the<br/>Universe split into many (infinity...) Universe&apos;s, which is still splitting<br/>up as we speak.<br/>A theory fom quantum mechanics suggests, that whenever we make a decision,<br/>e.g. toss a coin, the Universe we inhabit splits into three (HEADS OR TAILS<br/>OR &quot;ON THE SIDE&quot; :o) ).</p><p>OK, then, I believe that at the moment of creation, all the possible<br/>Universes were created, our Universe, and all the other &quot;un-Universes&quot;, from<br/>variations on a theme of ours (being very similar to ours), to Universes<br/>with completely different laws of science.<br/>Empty Universes, with different propertys, and laws of science, like<br/>different games in a toystore.<br/>And also, variations on ours, e.g. Todd with green hair, Todd with a striped<br/>shirt, Sarn&apos;s with a purple computer and three eyes and also of &quot;tri-sexual&quot;<br/>orientation-i.e. Sarn will &quot;try anything for a laugh&quot;....<br/> :o) ).</p><p>Mabey this is where the Superpowers could be used in theoretical physics and<br/>practical engineering one day.</p><p>Actually, I want to use curves created from ((((x^x)^x)^x)^x)...... and<br/>......((((x^x)^x)^x)), for variokinetic weight training FVT curves.</p><p>But anyway, about the pattern of 65536 in the last digits where and<br/>superexponent of 2 is greater than three.</p><p>I wounder if there are any such other interesting propertys of numbers a&amp;b<br/>where a=3, 4, 5, 6, 7...... and b=2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7......?</p><p>I don&apos;t believe that there is a formula for prime numbers, no matter how<br/>high we go into the super-super-super-super...........power stack.</p><p>I believe its been proven.</p><p>I checked out if (5&amp;0.25)&amp;0.25= 5&amp;0.5, when we use a&amp;b=.....(x^(x^x)) and it<br/>wasen&apos;t to be the case.</p><p>However, what you may, also find really interesting, is that is is ALSO NOT<br/>THE CASE when a&amp;b=((x^x)^x)..... either!</p><p>Here the 4th QRoot reverse 5=1.545921430......., and its quiggle<br/>square=2.12937248 (as normal quiggles), but and THIS fellows quiggle square<br/>(or 5=(((x^x)^x)^x)= 1.960960668757......, and this did not = x, when x^x=5<br/>(5&apos;s quiggle square), or 2.12937248.....</p><p>Mabey, ((5&amp;0.25)&amp;0.25)=<br/>5&amp;(0.25^0.25)=5&amp;0.707106781=(5&amp;10000000000)&amp;-root(707106781), bigger<br/>numbers=more accuracy.</p><p>      O<br/>{SNIP} \           /<br/>        -----------<br/>       /           \<br/>      O</p><p>I&apos;m guessing that left to right should be the order for hyperquiggles also. I<br/>think this is because when you look at something like this x^(x^(x^x)) you<br/>aren&apos;t really going from left to right anyway, you are starting with the second<br/>to last, then going right, then going back again to the second x, then going<br/>back to your original result of x^x, in a sort of zig-zag. If you order things<br/>left to right, you are going the way which the exponent ascociates just by<br/>itself.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s Reply:</p><p>Yes, this is true.</p><p>I have managed to base some microtonal musical temperaments on this point,<br/>thanks to you!!!!!, also, which I will explain below.<br/>Thank&apos;s for pointing this out to me.</p><p>I will be composing using David Cope&apos;s SARA in LISP, a VERY GOOD music<br/>creation AI type programme, which has fooled music lovers.<br/>You can hardly tell the difference from human brain composed music.</p><p>Actually, from this logical inconsistency, we can actually MAKE this have<br/>some very interesting results!</p><p>(Much like a famous New Zealand drink, &quot;Lemon And Paeroa&quot; was a fluke&quot;).</p><p>Say we take 7(&amp;)7=p.</p><p>I put the little &amp; symbol in brackest, because it:</p><p>a)Looked lonely, and a little cold, :o)<br/>b)Because its a general way of specifing and generalizeing what I&apos;m about to<br/>show you.</p><p>From this, we can have:</p><p>p=7th (QuiggleRoot type_n) 7, where (QuiggleRoot_n)=</p><p>1.(((x^x)^x)^x)^(x^(x^x))<br/>2.((x^x)^x)^(x^(x^(x^x)))<br/>3.((x^x)^(x^x))^(x^(x^x)) ect.......</p><p>Actually, there are n*(n-1)*(n-2)*.....(n-r+1) when they are selected r at a<br/>time, thus ALL the possible ways of defineing a&amp;n=</p><p>  (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*......(n-r+1))<br/>        E<br/>        r</p><p>Where n=kth root, and r=1, 2, 3, ....n</p><p>so, for the 7th quiggle root,of 7, there are:</p><p>(7*6*5*4*3*2*1)+(6*5*4*3*2*1*2)+(5*4*3*2*1*3)+(4*3*2*1*4)+(1*2*3*3)+(1*2*2)+<br/>(1*1)=</p><p>5040+1440+360+96+18+4+1=</p><p>6959 different ways of defineing the 7th quiggle root of any number.</p><p>Which one is correct?</p><p>Also, what if we line these up in Square, of 83.42 unit side lengths, and<br/>apply them to the color spectrum of a photograph gridded off like so, to<br/>translate them into another color spectrum?</p><p>The grid could be ordered by rank of size:    1 2  3  4  5  6<br/>                                             19 20--------- 7<br/>                                             18            |8<br/>                                             17      &lt;-----|9<br/>                                             16 14 13 12 11 10</p><p>spiraling inwards.</p><p>I want to do this with sonograms, and to see what happens to the sound of a<br/>sample.</p><p>Anyway, I woundered, what would the graph of:</p><p>y=xth(Quiggleroot_z)w as a 3D solid in hyperspace looklike?</p><p>Assumeing here, that the z&apos;s are ordered by rank, what would the solid looklike?</p><p>      O<br/>{SNIP} \           /<br/>        -----------<br/>       /           \<br/>      O</p><p>Plus look at this pattern:</p><p>3*3 = 3+3+3 = 9<br/>3^3 = 3*3*3 = 3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 3*9 = 27<br/>3(&amp;.)3 = (3^3)^3 = 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3^9 = it doesn&apos;t matter</p><p>Notice that the reverse quiggle fits in with the pattern, whereas, a regular<br/>quiggle:<br/>3&amp;3 = 3^(3^3) = 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3^27</p><p>On that same token, the hyperquiggle (the reverse hyperreversequiggle) should<br/>be: 3@3 = (3(&amp;.)3)(&amp;.)3 = 3^3^3^3^3^3^3^3^3 = 3&amp;9</p><p>So, from here on out, maybe the reverse quiggle should be changed to just<br/>quiggle, and the quiggle should become the reverse quiggle.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s Reply:</p><p>Yes, perhaps that&apos;s correct.</p><p>I used to define what I now call reverse quiggle as quiggle, until someone<br/>pointed out to me that it was just exponentional exponents.</p><p>However, using this as the rule, the only operator we&apos;d ever need is addition!</p><p>I guess its just a matter of practicality!</p><p>      O<br/>{SNIP} \           /<br/>        -----------<br/>       /           \<br/>      O<br/>Hmmmm...x^0=1 because 1 is the starting point of all multiplication (anything<br/>times 1 equals itself) so x&amp;0 should be the starting point of all<br/>exponentation. I think it would be 1 again, because you can raise things to the<br/>power of one and never change them. But that only follows for this form x^1=x,<br/>it&apos;s not true that 1^x=x, because 1^x=1. Maybe it should be different for each<br/>number. 1.414...^2=2  so  2&amp;0=1.414...  x^3=3  so   3&amp;0 = x. Negative<br/>superexponents should be reverse exponentation on the starting point (roots).<br/>For example: 3&amp;-1 would be the third root of 3&amp;0 (the third root of the third<br/>root of 3) just like 3^-1 would be 3 divided by 3 divided by 3.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>Well, this is interesting!</p><p>So, 3&amp;0=3^(1/3), because (3^3)^(1/3)=3, but (1/3)^(3^3)=1.311372652*10^-13.</p><p>And, it thus follows that x&amp;-n=xth quiggle root(x&amp;(n+1)) until n=0.</p><p>     O<br/>{SNIP} \           /<br/>        -----------<br/>       /           \<br/>      O<br/>Of course, something like (-2)&amp;0 would be the negative second root of -2, which<br/>would be the square root of one over -2, which would be imaginary. I suppose it<br/>is possible that there would be some equations which couldn&apos;t be solved by<br/>imaginary numbers. Perhaps we would have to create superimaginary<br/>numbers...ludricrous numbers, or something like that.</p><p>What is a number raised to the power of an imaginary number anyway? 2^i=? You<br/>multiply 2 by itself an imaginary number of times.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s Reply:</p><p>Yes, FASINATING!!!!!!!!</p><p>Fancy-An imaginary number multiplyed by itself an imaginary number of times.</p><p>Yes, using the x&amp;-n=Q-root (x&amp;(n+1))----&gt;n-----&gt;0 definition, (-2)&amp;0 should<br/>be equal to<br/>(-2)^2=2, or i(2^(1/2)) or i1.414213562.</p><p>I wounder what i2&amp;0 would give?</p><p>((i2)^2)=-1.4141213562</p><p>*    |+2  | -2  | -i2  | i2  |<br/>--------------------------------------------<br/>+2   | 4  | -4  | -i4  | i4  |<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>-2   |-4  | 4   | 4i   | -4i |<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>-i2  |-i4 | 4i  |  -4  | 4   |<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>i2   | i4 | -4i | 4    | -4  |<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>Yes, there are some equations that can&apos;t be solved by reals, negative reals,<br/>+/- imaginary.</p><p>I believe they use &quot;Quarternians&quot;, &quot;Octernians&quot;, or a combination of there<br/>and complex numbers.</p><p>You can&apos;t have anything higher, like hyper-hyper-hyper-complex numbers either.</p><p>The proof exists, but is not nice, at all.</p><p>     O<br/>{SNIP} \           /<br/>        -----------<br/>       /           \<br/>      O</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>Yes, I wounder.</p><p>Using my table above, we could have, say:</p><p>1^i=i1, -i1, +1, -1??</p><p>Supposedly, we could have:</p><p> Z    |  i |   -i | 1  |   -1  |       Where Z=Operator above<br/>multiplication: ^, &amp;, hyper&amp;, hyper/hyper&amp;<br/>--------------------------------<br/>i    |     |      |    |       |<br/>--------------------------------<br/>-i   |     |      |    |       |<br/>--------------------------------<br/>-1   |     |      |    |       |<br/>--------------------------------<br/>+1   |     |      |    |       |<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>Any more comments?</p><p>SARN GOES ON FURTHER TO SAY:</p><p>This is all very peculiar.</p><p>Since there are:</p><p>       ----                          -------- ^2<br/>      | (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*.......(n-r+1))|<br/>      |              E                      |<br/>      |              r                      |<br/>      |                                     |<br/>       ----                           ------<br/>           r=1, 2, 3.......n</p><p>Different temperaments that can be gained from a 12 tower high exponent<br/>series, I should have a lot to play with.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Sarn Ursell.</p></div>
