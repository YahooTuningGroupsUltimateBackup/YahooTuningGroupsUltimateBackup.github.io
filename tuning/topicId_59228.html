All this is written in verse.<br/>The second part of the book is in prose, and it covers<br/>theoretical matters. He treats the division of the<br/>octave and the intervals, musical metres, their basic<br/>patterns and their &apos;cycles&apos;. Compositional rules for<br/>suites follow, and the closing paragraph is pointing<br/>to the possibility fo dividing the octave into 24<br/>steps (!).</p><p>In my opinion, the book&apos;s editorial bonus is the<br/>footnote explanatory section which is nearly the<br/>entire second half the book, and which is filled with<br/>background explanations and cross-references.

Their<br/>asked price across the table is EUR 35 plus 7 % VAT<br/>(multiply that with whatever Fahrenheit for the<br/>currency of your domicile), as opposed to a list price<br/>of EUR 53.</p><p>Michael</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>How much free photo storage do you get?
