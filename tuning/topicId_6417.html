Since I&apos;m away from my office at the moment,<br/>let&apos;s look at an easy example, 24-tET. I think the &quot;worst&quot; 7-limit triad from a<br/>consistency standpoint in 24-tET is 4:5:7, the example with which we all should<br/>be familiar by now. The degree of inconsistency could be measured by the<br/>difference between the deviation of the best approximation of an interval and the<br/>deviation of the approximation required to make the chord consistent. In this<br/>case, the worst degree of inconsistency is in the 4:5, since 400 cents is only 14<br/>cents sharp, while 350 cents, which would make the chord consistent, is 36 cents<br/>flat. 36-14=22 cents, which represents .44 of a step of 24-tET.</p><p>So, I would say that for 24-tET in the 7-limit, the worst degree of worst<br/>inconsistency is .44. You&apos;ll find it&apos;s much lower for 14-tET.</p><p>&gt;BTW, is this form of ET<br/>&gt;consistency your own original conception Paul?</p><p>Yes. I posted it to the list back when it was on the Mills server in digest 6??<br/>or 7??, and its definition appears in a footnote of my paper, TTTTTT. Paul Hahn<br/>then generalized this to higher-level consistency, where mine is level 1. I then<br/>showed that consistency of level N&gt;1.5 is simply equivalent to a measure of the<br/>whether the maximum error in the given limit is less than 1/2N of a step.<br/>the maximum error in the given limi</p></div><h3><a id=7850 href="#7850">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2000 9:11:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;OK, Dan, you could take this into account by assigning (sorry to add more<br/>&gt;measures, Carl) a worst degree_ of worst inconsistency to each ET in each<br/>&gt;limit.</p><p>Actually, this is just fractional Hahn levels, no?</p><p>&gt;&gt;BTW, is this form of ET consistency your own original conception Paul?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes.

In<br/>&gt; that case, in the 11-limit we don&apos;t have h46=h34+h12, but if we<br/>&gt; instead send 11 to 41 steps of the 12-et, we have a map g12(2)=12,<br/>&gt; g12(3)=19, g12(5)=28, g12(7)=34 g12(11)=41 which tells us how many<br/>&gt; scale steps we use for anything in the 11-limit, and then we do have<br/>&gt; h46=h34+g12, as well as consistency.</p><p>That all makes sense, assuming you meant 48 to be 46.  But we&apos;re still<br/>getting different results, aren&apos;t we?</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Taking nearest prime approximations, I get<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [1, -2, -8, -6].</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is what I get for 34, not 46.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, you can get anything you like from 34 because, again, it<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; consistent.</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; I can get anything I like from anything, consistent or not, but why<br/>&gt; should I want to? The above is derived from the nearest prime<br/>&gt; approximations for 34, it seems to me.</p><p>It can be assumed that an equal temperament uses the closest<br/>approximations to the relevant consonance limit.  Any more specific rule,<br/>and you have to say what it is.  Nearest primes is fine, but you didn&apos;t<br/>say you were using it before.</p><p>I still get this mapping as [1, -2, -8, 11].</p><p>h46 is [46, 73, 107, 129, 159].  h34 is [34, 54, 79, 95, 118].</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; 46+58 is the linear temperament consistent with both 46- and 58-<br/>&gt; equal.</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; This is definately something we want a notation for, but so is the et<br/>&gt; and generator defined by 46 and 58, which is what I&apos;ve been using it<br/>&gt; for. What would you say to 46&amp;58 or 46^58 to mean the temperament<br/>&gt; obtained by intersecting the kernels of 46 and 58?</p><p>What&apos;s the difference?</p><p>I got into special symbols before.  After a while, I couldn&apos;t remember<br/>what they meant, and I don&apos;t think anyone else ever worked it out.  It&apos;s<br/>best to call the temperament m+n that with m intervals of one size and n<br/>of another.  That means the approximation is only defined where m and n<br/>are consistent[1].  Anything more specific and you could say so in<br/>English.</p><p>It may be you&apos;re defining the smaller ET as step sizes of its closest<br/>approximation in the larger one.  I don&apos;t like that written as a sum,<br/>because one argument depends on the other in a non-obvious way.<br/>h46.subscale(34)+h46 maybe.</p><p>                   Graham</p><p>[1] You could work it out if only one of m and n is consistent, but m+n<br/>is.  The trouble is, that would mean using the result of the sum to<br/>determine one of the arguments, which I don&apos;t like.</p></div><h3><a id=29976 href="#29976">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/6/2001 7:08:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; In-Reply-To: &lt;9s8a8n+u3p0@e...&gt;</p><p>&gt; Nearest primes is fine, but you didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; say you were using it before.</p><p>It&apos;s what I mean by hn, as I&apos;ve explained a few times.</p><p>&gt; I still get this mapping as [1, -2, -8, 11].</p><p>I thought you said [1,-2,-8,-6], which is the same mod 17 as<br/>[1,-2,-8,11], but *not* the same mod 23.</p><p>&gt; h46 is [46, 73, 107, 129, 159].  h34 is [34, 54, 79, 95, 118].</p><p>And 159/4 = 11 (mod 23), 118/3 = -6 = 11 (mod 17.)</p><p>&gt; Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 46+58 is the linear temperament consistent with both 46- and 58-<br/>&gt; &gt; equal.</p><p>&gt; Gene:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is definately something we want a notation for, but so is<br/>the et<br/>&gt; &gt; and generator defined by 46 and 58, which is what I&apos;ve been using<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; for.
