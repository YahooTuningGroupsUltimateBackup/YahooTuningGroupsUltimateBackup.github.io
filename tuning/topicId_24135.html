If they<br/>do, the post gets ignored as those not following the intricacies<br/>of the 72-tet debate miss what few posts are on other topics.</p><p>In attempt to get attention of the 72-tet enthusiasts that this<br/>is a real issue, I&apos;ve done a new poll:</p><p>Would you be happier if the posts on 72-tet were on another<br/>list?</p><p>Yes, No.</p><p>Please vote either way. I&apos;ll leave it running, no close date.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;m wrong, maybe only a few vocal posters feel that this<br/>is a real issue.
