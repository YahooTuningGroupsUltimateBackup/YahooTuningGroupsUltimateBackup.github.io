But anyway, what if you<br/>&gt;try tuning only the melodic interval, as I suggested?</p><p>What do you mean you don&apos;t know what I mean?  The whole thread is about it.<br/> You just explained it to Darren.</p><p>I actually don&apos;t know if they were sum tones.  They sounded like high<br/>frequency pure tones, and had the same ghosty &quot;strafing&quot; effect that<br/>difference tones have when you turn your head.</p><p>I don&apos;t actually have the gear to do the test you recommend.  I don&apos;t have<br/>a tuning knob on any synth, and Malinowski&apos;s generators are both-at-once or<br/>nothing-at-all (also, the box is several thousand miles away).  Also, I&apos;d<br/>like to note for the record that this test is not equivalent to telling two<br/>tunings (with up to 50 cent differences) of a melody apart, which is the<br/>thing I said would be easy.  Actually, considering how little &quot;up to 50<br/>cent differences&quot; does to specify a method of re-tuning, I retract my<br/>statment.</p><p>&gt;What tunings were you tuning with sum tones, and why are they horrible?</p><p>Ah- I was talking about the unisons.  For some reason, the sum tones (or<br/>whatever it is that I hear) don&apos;t always stop beating when the fundamentals<br/>do, and vice versa.  Can that be right?  Ed?</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Is the phenomenon different with two strings than<br/>with one string? If so, you probably have a defective string and/or piano<br/>that&apos;s causing different degrees of inharmonicity on the two strings. Then<br/>of course the partials will beat when the fundamentals don&apos;t, and vice<br/>versa. The people on the pianotech list can probably tell you more about<br/>what kind of pianos are particularly prone to unpredictable inharmonicity,<br/>but this is a well-known phenomenon (even in a few Steinways) and is quite<br/>mysterious theoretically.</p></div>
