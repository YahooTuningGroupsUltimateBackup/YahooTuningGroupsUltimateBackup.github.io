I found this just about as simple to compose in as diatonic...no kidding.&nbsp; :-)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the feeling the reason Mike B.&apos;s tuning is so efficient resolves a lot around the fact one of the ratios is right smack between 11/7 and 14/9...and the 14/9 also happens to have 9/7 as an octave inverse.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a couple of &quot;just wolf fifths&quot; around 40/27...but it&apos;s not enough to distract from the general stability of everything else. :-)</p></div>
