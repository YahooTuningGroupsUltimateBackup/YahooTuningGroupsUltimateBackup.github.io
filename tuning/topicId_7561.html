The tuning works absolutely admirably on both<br/>systems. But I don&apos;t doubt that different sound cards react differently to<br/>such parameters. You&apos;ll likely hafta probe its software innards and tweek<br/>the thing.<br/>On my Tropez sound card, incidentally, the sustain function is spotty at<br/>best. All this still reaffirms my impressions that sound card-based synths<br/>are still not &quot;serious&quot; when it comes to achieving optimal MIDI<br/>implementation.
