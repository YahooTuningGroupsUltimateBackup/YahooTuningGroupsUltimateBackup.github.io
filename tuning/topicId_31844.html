This represents an approximate 1.5:1<br/>&quot;compression ratio&quot; over an 60 dB &quot;input dynamic range&quot; (up to 100 Phons),<br/>resulting in approximately 20 db of non-linear &quot;loudness reduction&quot; occuring.</p><p>The resultant *perceived partials* generated by such non-linearity (at 500 Hz)<br/>are the 2nd harmonic (at 40 Phons), the 3rd harmonic (at 60 Phons), the 4th<br/>harmonic (at 70 Phons), and the 5th harmonic (at 80 Phons). At around 250 Hz,<br/>these &quot;compression thresholds&quot; begin about 10-20 dB lower levels (in Phons) than<br/>are listed above. At 1000 Hz (and higher in frequency), these &quot;compression<br/>thresholds&quot; begin about 10 dB higher levels (in Phons) than are listed above<br/>(&quot;Music, Physics, and Engineering&quot;, Second Edition, Olson, 1967, after Wegel and<br/>Lane, page 256).<br/>_______________________________________</p><p>JG: Paul, evidently referring to applying a (dyadic or tetradic) &quot;discordance&quot;<br/>algorithm which appears to have been generated by Bill Sethares (and referred to<br/>in a thread entitled &quot;Sethares algorithm) in &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #27:</p><p>PE: &quot;... if I use a fixed waveform and simply adjust the volume up<br/>or down (by adding a constant to all the dBs), I get very different curves.<br/>Is that the way it&apos;s supposed to work, Bill?&quot;</p><p>___________________________________</p><p>Recalling the experience in:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898">/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898</a><br/>[<a href="/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898">/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898</a>]</p><p>PE: Again, Sethares, working with me, was unable to ascertain exactly how<br/>to use his formula. And his formula fails pretty badly for chords of<br/>three or more notes, where it fails to reproduce our observations<br/>that otonal chords are more consonant than utonal chords.</p><p>PE: The problem Sethares and I were finding was that, depending on the<br/>decibel level you assumed (yes, by &quot;amplitude&quot; Sethares really<br/>means &quot;decibel level&quot;), you can get a wildly different dissonance<br/>curve.<br/>_______________________________</p><p>In &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #28:</p><p>Sethares:<br/>&gt;I think the normal thing to do when comparing different waveforms is<br/>&gt;to equalize the energy in the signal (add up all the dB numbers, then<br/>&gt;divide by the total to normalize to &quot;1&quot;, for instance).<br/>&gt;Then youve got a &quot;fair&quot; comparison between the two sounds.</p><p>PE: hmm . . . but the results will be very different depending on whether you<br/>normalize to &quot;1&quot; or to some other constant . . . and what about negative dB<br/>values? They&apos;re present in any waveform, their extent depending on your<br/>arbitrary choice of a zero-dB point, but they contribute perversely to the<br/>normalization above (the dB numbers could easily sum to zero, or to a<br/>negative number) . . . and you don&apos;t really mean &quot;energy&quot; above, since<br/>energy goes as the square of the amplitude, while dBs measure log-amplitude --<br/>correct?</p><p>Sethares:<br/>&gt;All the comments above, though, only make sense within<br/>&gt;a limited range... certainly using dB to approximate amplitude<br/>&gt;is good to first approximation</p><p>PE: You say &quot;amplitude&quot; but of course dB is logarithmic in amplitude . . . the<br/>two are in no way interchangeable, as Ed Borasky&apos;s comments show . . . do<br/>you really mean &quot;loudness&quot;?</p><p>_______________________</p><p>In &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #29</p><p>Sethares:<br/>surely we must be using our numbers to mean loudness,<br/>which is normally measured in dB, with respect to<br/>some arbitrary point at the threshold of hearing...<br/>youre right that we cant be adding negative &quot;loudnesses&quot;<br/>but I do agree that there is a scaling issue here...</p><p>Im not sure what the best &quot;zero-point&quot; is.<br/>Maybe zero should be equated to the noise floor?<br/>Now I understand why you refrenced to the smallest<br/>partial, because in a synthetic example the noise floor<br/>is essentially infinite?</p><p>So I guess the proper normalization would involve<br/>equal loudnesses among the two sounds?<br/>__________________________________</p><p>In harmonic_entropy message #530, J Gill&apos;s asked some questions regarding the<br/>conditions under which the &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; model is applicable for &quot;complex&quot;<br/>or &quot;harmonic dyads&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; PE: ...&quot;(b)the multiplicity of partials will represent several<br/>&gt; &gt; independent<br/>&gt; &gt; sources of information for the same ratio-interpretations&quot;</p><p>&gt; JG: Would not (b) directly above imply that - for the equivalence<br/>&gt; of &quot;ratio-interpretations&quot; to exist from &quot;several independent sources<br/>&gt; of information&quot; (those sources being the individual complex tones<br/>&gt; from which the dyad is constructed) - the spectral amplitudes of each<br/>&gt; of the overtones of the individual fundamental frequencies of such<br/>&gt; individual complex tones must be equivalent. That is -the (steady<br/>&gt; state, as well as the transient) frequency spectrums of the (complex)<br/>&gt; tones number 1 and number 2 from which the dyad is constructed must<br/>&gt; be identical (or nearly identical) in order for your assumption (b)<br/>&gt; directly above to be valid?</p><p>JG: Additionally, due to the nonlinear amplitude transfer function of<br/>perceived loudness levels [shown as approximately equal to a value of<br/>( (SPL)b/(SPL)a )^(2/3) at SPL levels greater than40Phons (in SPL),<br/>which is equal to 0.1 SONE (in LOUDNESS UNITS, being 20 dB above the<br/>threshold of human hearing)] [from &quot;Music, Physics, and Engineering&quot;,<br/>Olson, 1967, page 252], is it not also true that, in order that &quot;the<br/>spectral amplitudes of each of the overtones of the individual<br/>fundamental frequencies of such individual complex tones&quot; remain<br/>identical (or nearly identical) relative to the amplitudes of those<br/>fundamental frequencies - that the two identical (steady-state as<br/>well as transient) frequency spectrums of the (complex) tones number<br/>1 and number 2 from which the dyad is constructed ALSO be of equal<br/>(or near equal) scalar amplitude throughout the time period during<br/>which each of the individual complex tones are sounded(steady-state<br/>as well as transient)?<br/>NOTE: The phrases &quot;steady-state&quot; as well as &quot;transient&quot; are utilized<br/>above in an inclusive manner to describe all phases of the process of<br/>time-varying amplitude envelopes multiplying each of the values of<br/>the individual complex tones (existing for some given time duration)<br/>from which the dyad is constructed.<br/>______________________________</p><p>In harmonic_entropy mesage 531, Paul Erlich (responding to J Gill&apos;s questions<br/>regarding the conditions under which the &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; model is applicable<br/>for &quot;harmonic dyads&quot;) wrote:</p><p>&gt;JG: That is - the (steady<br/>&gt; state, as well as the transient) frequency spectrums of the (complex)<br/>&gt; tones number 1 and number 2 from which the dyad is constructed must<br/>&gt; be identical (or nearly identical) in order for your assumption (b)<br/>&gt; directly above to be valid?</p><p>PE: For the assumption to be valid, both tones would have to have a fairly<br/>complete complement of overtones, present with decent amplitude, in the<br/>frequency range in question.<br/>________________________</p><p>J Gill: For reasons other than amplitude nonlinearities, as well as for reason<br/>of amplitude nonlinearities, it appears (to me) that the application of<br/>&quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; to a (&quot;complex&quot; or &quot;harmonic&quot;) dyad (where both tones of the<br/>dyad contain harmonics of the individual fundamental frequencies of the<br/>individual notes&apos; pitch) is premised (in the ideal sense of the model) upon the<br/>two &quot;complex&quot; notes to be considered having:</p><p>(1) Identical measured *loudness* levels for each of the fundamental frequency<br/>components; and</p><p>(2) Identical relative *loudnesses* for each member of the set of the<br/>&quot;harmonics&quot; existing at integer multiples of the individual fundamental<br/>frequency components.</p><p>The sinusoidal case of applying the &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; concept removes<br/>consideration &apos;(2)&apos; directly above, but appears to, as well, be subject to<br/>consideration &apos;(1)&apos; directly above.<br/>_______________</p><p>In &quot;tuning&quot; message #23898, Paul appears to affirm the considerations &apos;(1)&apos; and<br/>&apos;(2)&apos; listed directly above:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898">/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898</a><br/>[<a href="/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898">/tuning/topicId_23887.html#23898</a>]</p><p>&gt;JG: It appear that all such systems attempting to map our<br/>(nonlinear) &quot;aural minds&quot;, and particularly the more descriptive<br/>&gt;approaches (which attempt to account for timbre over and above the<br/>&gt;sinusoid) are inherently subject to such nonlinearities in the case<br/>&gt;of *differing* amplitudes between two (or more) simultaneously<br/>&gt;sounded tones (whether sinusoidal or complex) to be.</p><p>Paul responds:</p><p>&gt;(a) I woudln&apos;t call that a &quot;nonlinearity&quot;.</p><p>JG: Would you call it (&quot;aural loudness&quot; perception) a *linear system*?</p><p>Paul&apos;s response (continued):</p><p>(b) While Sethares&apos; roughness is very sensitive to amplitude EVEN<br/>HOLDING THE AMPLITUDES OF THE TWO TONES EQUAL TO ONE<br/>ANOTHER, harmonic entropy is not.</p><p>JG: It seems that to your statement should be added : &quot;... as long as the<br/>perceived &apos;loudness levels&apos; of each of the fundamental frequencies (as well as<br/>the perceived &apos;loudness levels&apos; of each and every one of the partials occuring<br/>at all of the various harmonic multiples of each of the fundamental frequencies)<br/>remains *matched* in value at all times considered in analysis.</p><p>JG: It also seems that, due to the &quot;frequency-selectivity&quot; of the family of<br/>&quot;Fletcher-Munsen&quot; curves further complicating the picture (as I indicated<br/>above), arestriction of frequencies considered of around 300 - 3000 Hz is<br/>imperative, in order to avoid further errors in approximating an &quot;equal<br/>loudness&quot; of the values of all of the individual frequency components of each of<br/>the complex (fundamental plus harmonics) tones sounded simultaneously.</p><p>Wishing that this &quot;aural analysis&quot; business was simpler, but accepting the fact<br/>that it is (by its inherently complicated nature) *not*,</p><p>J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=31849 href="#31849">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2001 1:34:08 PM</span><button style="float: right;
