In fact we do not know anything about the tuning he  might<br/>have had in mind, or experienced on some organ or  pedal<br/>clavichord/harpsichord. There is nothing that shows that it could  not<br/>be equal temperament ... to speak of a &apos;Fischer temperament&apos;  is<br/>meaningless.</p><p>Johnny: Meaningless for me is to ignore the problem.  At least try  some<br/>mental algebra with an unknown variable and set up an equation, at least<br/>metaphorically.  He had to use something!</p><p>While theoretically it is possible that Fischer used equal temperament,  that<br/>is the least likely possibility for a number of reasons.  It was not  what<br/>was done at that time for keyboard.  It would have been noted as such  (most<br/>likely scenario).  After 20 keys, using the last 4 would make a lot  of sense.<br/>Bach followed Fischer up with 24, aware that he was using a full  circle.</p><p>Tom:  Fischer did not write in &apos;20 major or minor keys&apos; - he wrote  in 10<br/>major keys (C D Eb E F G Ab A Bb B), 9 minor keys (C# D E F F# G A  B<br/>C) and the Phrygian mode on E. Apart from B major, the major and  minor<br/>keys are those which in modern notation have up to 4 flats or  sharps.</p><p>Johnny:  Thank you for specifying in more detail.  My point is  that it is<br/>most likely that Fischer did not use keys with 2 fifths, the same 2  fifths that<br/>limit&apos;s Schlick&apos;s tuning.  In other words, there are at least 2  dogs.  With<br/>this reality, a composer would avoid the dogs in composed works  unless trying<br/>to portray an extra-musical idea in the music.</p><p>Within an aesthetic of variegation in keys, it may be more forgivable to<br/>stray to a poodle or a goat, as Margo and I have been discussing.  But  there are<br/>definitely badlands to be avoided.  Unfortunately, I do not have  the Fischer<br/>music, nor have I seen it.  But it makes intuitive sense that  there is no<br/>enclopedic effort by Fister to catalogue all possibilities  as contrasted to<br/>Bach&apos;s almost scientific Well-tempered Clavier,  Musical Offering, Art of the<br/>Fugue.  Fischer&apos;s use of the E Phrygian mode  only underscores more of a bouquet<br/>of flowers in presentation.  It is quite  possible Fisher had audible<br/>distinctions between his keys, more like experienced  with a mixed sushi selection.</p><p>Tom:  The 20 tonalities encompass every chromatic degree, in that  the set of<br/>tonics is the familiar 12-note chromatic scale.</p><p>Johnny:  Curious, are there only 12 pitch notations, or like with<br/>Werckmeister, does he use enharmonic identities?  This would be most  telling.</p><p>Tom:  So every fifth round the circle should then be musically  employable,<br/>since every fifth is involved in either a tonic major or tonic  minor<br/>chord or both.</p><p>Johnny:  Please consider the difference between employable and being<br/>functional.  Do doubt all chromatics can be used; however, using C# major  as a<br/>functional tonic for a key with a wonky fifth was simply not done.</p><p>Tom: Moreover the use of the dominant chord with major third<br/>in the  minor tonality means that the range of chords used is rather<br/>wider than the  mere list of tonic triads. The tuning has to be<br/>circulating in the narrow  sense of the word.</p><p>Johnny:  Yes, circulating in the narrow sense of the word.  It is  not a well<br/>temperament.  Nor is it a meantone.  And it is not equal  temperament.  What<br/>you describe above can be legitimate for  a rare circumstance.</p><p>That leaves us with an irregular tuning that favors most of the keyboard<br/>with differences between keys.  This is anathema to meantone, and this is  one<br/>reason why I have not been comfortable with the term &quot;modified  meantone.&quot;</p><p>Tom:  There are various reasons why Fischer might not have written  in F# and<br/>C# major and G#, D# and Bb minor - perhaps he considered them  simply<br/>too inconvenient to read, to play or even to notate.</p><p>Johnny:  Good try, but it sounds too administrative a reason to be  true.<br/>Fischer&apos;s choice of keys (and mode) are indicative of having a good  ear for<br/>what sits best in each -- distinctive -- scale (or mode).  As an  irregular<br/>tuning, especially a personal one like the kind some believe Bach  possessed, it<br/>would be difficult to impossible to analyze with key is which when  listening,<br/>for lots of reasons.</p><p>Tom:  By the way, considering  Schlick&apos;s text, it seems extremely unlikely<br/>that any player in the early  1500&apos;s would try to go beyond the tonal<br/>range of *his* tuning, which is  between the chords of Ab major/F minor<br/>and E major/F# minor (G# is marginally  usable as a third, but not as a<br/>perfect fifth).</p><p>Essentially: The fifths that fall between the sharps (primarily  C#-G#)<br/>are not important because no-one uses them, no chants are written  in<br/>modes transposed onto the sharps. And even if someone composed a  piece<br/>in that way, the organist could transpose it to avoid using the  most<br/>dissonant sharps, that is C# and G#.</p><p>One point sometimes  overlooked is that Schlick&apos;s keyboard could be<br/>moved a tone relative to the  pipes...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>Johnny:  Great information, Tom.  But I will no longer overlook  that there<br/>could be a move up &quot;a tone relative to the pipes.  Wow!  If  that is true (just<br/>want to be sure) and Schlick is following his own  irregular tuning, then it<br/>is even more fantastic that he could modulate up a  whole tone and completely<br/>changing the relationships of the variegated  keys.</p><p>One interesting thing about Schlick, he is the only proponent of irregular<br/>tuning that doesn&apos;t come from Thuringia.</p><p>best wishes, Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=74091 href="#74091">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2007 8:32:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He had to use something!</p><p>Well, why not an organ in ET? Perhaps the instrument was built by some<br/>now-forgotten equality enthusiast and they wanted some<br/>widely-modulating pieces to show it off; but Fischer&apos;s musical<br/>imagination, or his comfort in handling exotic notation, only went as<br/>far as five sharps and four flats.</p><p>&gt; While theoretically it is possible that Fischer used equal<br/>temperament, that<br/>&gt; is the least likely possibility for a number of reasons.  It was not<br/> what<br/>&gt; was done at that time for keyboard.</p><p>That is only your assumption. Werckmeister mentions the possibility of<br/>it being done in the last decade of the century. During the 17th<br/>century we get occasional hints of ET being applied in practice (e.g.<br/>Galle in Paris around the time of Mersenne!). Of course, it was not<br/>*usual*, and the musical effects were usually not welcomed. But<br/>Ariadne is not a usual or normal collection of organ music either.</p><p>Look at the rest of Fischer&apos;s works: they are much more conventional<br/>in choice of keys. Ariadne was an exception, which *could* have been<br/>due to an exceptional instrument.</p><p>&gt; It would have been noted as such (most likely scenario).</p><p>What does that mean? There was no way for any early 18th century<br/>composer to have &apos;noted&apos; or notated equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; After 20 keys, using the last 4 would make a lot of sense.</p><p>From the perspective of someone who routinely notated music with<br/>double sharps, double flats and naturals, yes. Not for someone who<br/>used the old convention of only sharps and flats, with the sharp signs<br/>doubling as naturals in flat keys, and vice versa.</p><p>Ariadne does not include a single double-sharp, double-flat, or<br/>natural sign. B major and E major never modulate to the relative minor<br/>- even though the requisite dominants (D# major and G# major) were<br/>enharmonic to Eb and Ab major, perfectly usable chords. I think there<br/>may be a good reason for the lack of double sharps: Fischer didn&apos;t<br/>know how to notate them.</p><p>&gt; Bach followed Fischer up with 24, aware that he was using a full<br/>circle.</p><p>But Fischer used a full circle of tonalities too! Consider the<br/>following: 10 major keys (C D Eb E F G Ab A Bb B), 9 minor keys (C# D<br/>E F F# G A B C). Rearrange according to tonic:</p><p> Ab Eb Bb F/f C/c G/g D/d A/a E/e/Phrygian B/b f# c#</p><p>This makes twelve tonics, and twelve tonic major and/or minor chords<br/>which have to have good fifths. C# minor uses C#-G#, which Schlick<br/>says is *not* used, Ab major uses Ab-Eb. If one assumes enharmonic<br/>equivalence, this is a complete circle.</p><p>&gt; Johnny:  Curious, are there only 12 pitch notations, or like with<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, does he use enharmonic identities?  This would be most<br/> telling.</p><p>The tonal range is from Db round to B#, apart from one Cb in a<br/>diminished chord (above D natural and F) in the Ab major prelude.</p><p>&gt; using C# major as a<br/>&gt; functional tonic for a key with a wonky fifth was simply not done.</p><p>The C# minor prelude finishes on precisely that chord.</p><p>&gt; It is not a well temperament.</p><p>Why not? Every major chord round the circle is used conspicuously,<br/>either as tonic or dominant or both.</p><p>&gt; Nor is it a meantone.</p><p>Why not? It could be 1/4-comma meantone on an instrument with 18 notes<br/>in the octave (Db through to B#) where the rogue Cb is simply played<br/>as a B. In this case the lack of double sharps is due to their absence<br/>on the instrument.</p><p>&gt; And it is not equal temperament.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>&gt; Fischer&apos;s choice of keys (and mode) are indicative of having a good<br/> ear for<br/>&gt; what sits best in each -- distinctive -- scale (or mode).</p><p>How could you judge this if you don&apos;t know the tuning and you don&apos;t<br/>know the music?</p><p>The usual historian&apos;s fallacy is to assume some kind of tuning for a<br/>given piece of music; then remark simultaneously 1) how well the music<br/>is written to match the tuning 2) how well the tuning suits the music;<br/>then to imagine that this has proved something worth knowing. Johnny<br/>has gone one better: he doesn&apos;t know either the tuning or the music,<br/>yet he can still praise the choice of keys.</p><p>By the way, since Fischer&apos;s range of fifths goes round the entire<br/>circle, can we count him as a non-Thuringian advocate of circulation?<br/>Same thing could be remarked about Heinichen, whose continuo exercises<br/>(1711) include each element of the circle, and who actually invented<br/>the &apos;musical circle&apos; as a practical graphical device.</p><p>&apos;Heinichen in his 1711 treatise showed that it was while a harpsichord<br/>student of Kuhnau that the concept of a &quot;musical circle&quot; relating all<br/>the major and minor keys originated.&apos;<br/><a href="http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/heinichen.html">http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/heinichen.html</a></p><p>Saxony, and to be precise Leipzig, emerges as another nest of<br/>circulating activity around 1700.</p><p>If you want to make something unequal out of Fischer, you could get a<br/>copy of the music (Performers&apos; Facsimiles, New York, Broude Bros.) and<br/>count the number of times each major third appears in a consonant<br/>chord, like Barnes did with part of the WTC.

Fine.  As this Fischer<br/>business is only tangential to my actual  work, I find it intriguing.  Brad made<br/>certain assertions that Bach  used actual motives from Fischer&apos;s music.  If that<br/>is true, even partially,  then it serves my purpose that Bach was impressed<br/>by Fischer.  Even  more so, is the coincidence of the use of many keys.</p><p>Now, I do not have Fischer and have never heard  or seen it.  Damn, I wish<br/>you could give medicine that tasted better.   I will have to await my acquiring<br/>originals.  Here, where you can be so  helpful as a musicologist, you (and<br/>Paul) kick dust in the face.  Frankly,  I will be surprised if you genuinely<br/>believe Fischer used ET, even if that&apos;s how  you prefer listening to it.</p><p>Tom:  Well, why not an organ in ET? Perhaps  the instrument was built by some<br/>now-forgotten equality enthusiast and they  wanted some<br/>widely-modulating pieces to show it off; but Fischer&apos;s  musical<br/>imagination, or his comfort in handling exotic notation, only went  as<br/>far as five sharps and four flats.</p><p>Johnny: Yes, you have little expectation for a  musician to know any better.<br/>Poor Fischer didn&apos;t know how to get past five  sharps and four flats,<br/>although he wrote the piece with the most variety of keys  in history.  Maybe, as you<br/>say, there was no variety because it was in  ET.  What a waste it would be<br/>then.  BTW, have you knowledge of  pieces certifiably in ET that makes use of<br/>every major and minor key?   Inquiring minds would like to know.</p><p>&gt; While theoretically it is possible that  Fischer used equal<br/>temperament, that<br/>&gt; is the least likely possibility  for a number of reasons. It was not<br/>what<br/>&gt; was done at that time for  keyboard.</p><p>Tom:  That is only your assumption.</p><p>Johnny: Back off!  Yes, I am being  creative.  Pardon me from seeing things<br/>in different ways, and  simultaneously, it is my curse.  It works quite well<br/>for me in  improvisation.  Sometime the passion that is useful for playing<br/>colors a  verbal argument, only to make it less valid to the emotionally even.<br/>Maybe  an emotional person is best equated with a circular tuning with wide<br/>variety?</p><p>&gt; It would have been noted as such (most  likely scenario).</p><p>Tom: What does that mean? There was no way for any  early 18th century<br/>composer to have &apos;noted&apos; or notated equal  temperament.</p><p>Johnny:  It was always possible for someone  to describe a tuning.  And it<br/>should be possible to check for chromatic  pairs.  I have mentioned this before<br/>but it didn&apos;t stick.</p><p>If in a single piece of music, defined as music  for which there is no time<br/>for a break to retune an instrument, a par of  chromatics are notated (e.g.,<br/>C#/Db, A#/Bb, etc.) we are probably dealing with  an &quot;enharmonic identity.&quot;<br/>Now, I know Andreas Werckmeister promoted the  idea of enharmonic identities,<br/>realizing that it was unlikely to retain only one  notation for one pitch.</p><p>In other words, if Fischer uses enharmonic  identities, it will be as a<br/>result of Werckmeister&apos;s contributions.   Although a Bohemian in Baden, Johann<br/>Caspar Ferdinand Fischer (1670-1746) wrote  Ariadne in 1702.</p><p>So, Fischer was 32 years old when he wrote his  bouquet of keys collection,<br/>20 years after Werckmeister published Orgel Probe in  1681, and 11 years after<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s Musicalische Temperatur.  Looking  at this evidence, although<br/>without the genuine item which will eventually  acquire, Fischer may have used<br/>Werckmeister III tuning, if not another  variant.</p><p>If, as you maintain, ET was a likely tuning for  Fischer, pre-Neidhardt,<br/>based only on an allusion to less popularized tracts to  be read by musicians,<br/>WIII is a better choice.  Besides what would you have  against WIII as Fischer&apos;s<br/>tuning.  You have already concluded he may not be  very smart (using no double<br/>sharps or flats), and that he may be limited in his  ability to describe what<br/>he is doing.  Have you ever heard anywhere that  Fischer&apos;s music was so<br/>supposed to demonstrate identical keys?  How stupid  that would be with the<br/>insistence of a B phrygian mode for  inclusion.</p><p>Tom: Ariadne does not include a single  double-sharp, double-flat, or<br/>natural sign. B major and E major never  modulate to the relative minor<br/>- even though the requisite dominants (D#  major and G# major) were<br/>enharmonic to Eb and Ab major, perfectly usable  chords. I think there<br/>may be a good reason for the lack of double sharps:  Fischer didn&apos;t<br/>know how to notate them.</p><p>&gt; Bach followed Fischer up  with 24, aware that he was using a full<br/>circle.</p><p>But Fischer used a  full circle of tonalities too!</p><p>Johnny: But consider that JS Bach declared his  full circle of tonalities and<br/>Fischer did not.</p><p>Tom: Consider the<br/>following: 10 major keys (C  D Eb E F G Ab A Bb B), 9 minor keys (C# D<br/>E F F# G A B C). Rearrange  according to tonic:</p><p>Ab Eb Bb F/f C/c G/g D/d A/a E/e/Phrygian B/b f#  c#</p><p>This makes twelve tonics, and twelve tonic major and/or minor  chords<br/>which have to have good fifths. C# minor uses C#-G#, which  Schlick<br/>says is *not* used, Ab major uses Ab-Eb. If one assumes  enharmonic<br/>equivalence, this is a complete circle.</p><p>Johnny: And a likely candidate for WIII.   Tom, without the music experience<br/>I don&apos;t know how the collection was  used.  For example, did Fischer use each<br/>piece as a training exercise for  players, also achievable with the<br/>Well-tempered Clavier?  Maybe Fischer  just ran out of creativity so as to stop where he<br/>did.  Still, maybe Bach  sensed his opportunity historically to plant his<br/>name on the circle of 12 major  and 12 minor keys.  Brad provided information, if<br/>true, that would confirm  this.</p><p>Surely, if Bach heard of Fischer, Fischer heard  of Werckmeister.  Put on<br/>your creativity cap; a top form musician/composer  would be abreast of every<br/>latest development.  Werckmeister was a musical  revolution.  ET was an idea that<br/>some individuals supposed could work, like  in China, but that rarely was<br/>heard, or even approved of, unless it was in an  instrument of short resonance,<br/>like a lute.   And did Fischer intend  his music to be passed on anonymously for<br/>others in his time, or for  posterity?</p><p>Tom, there are other ways of thinking than simply  yours.  It does not help<br/>to hide among others who feel the same way that  you do either.  History is not<br/>Herstory.  History is the story of the  winners.  There are plenty of<br/>chestnuts to drop.</p><p>&gt; Johnny: Curious, are there only 12 pitch  notations, or like with<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, does he use enharmonic identities?  This would be most<br/>telling.</p><p>The tonal range is from Db round to B#,  apart from one Cb in a<br/>diminished chord (above D natural and F) in the Ab  major prelude.</p><p>Johnny:  Thank you, this is good  information.  If there is a B#, then we<br/>have enharmonic equivalence.   I don&apos;t a subsemitonia keyboard is intended.  Just<br/>a gut reaction.   Too post-Praetorius.  Too post-Werckmeister.  If we can use<br/>Walthe&apos;s  lexicon, the B# would be played on the keyboard note that is a C.<br/>(Look E#  and it is played as an F, Walther).  Once again, Werckmeister III<br/>makes the  best example as a tuning for a piece of music that is circulating to<br/>other  musicians.  (can I use circulating in this way?).</p><p>&gt; using C# major as a<br/>&gt; functional  tonic for a key with a wonky fifth was simply not done.</p><p>Tom:  The C#  minor prelude finishes on precisely that chord.</p><p>Johnny:  Perfect.  In WIII this is a  wonderful triad:  0   300   702.<br/>Sounds great for  a prelude to something, or for anything else.  It is a set mood<br/>of a  triad.  And we all know today its sound because 300 is modern ET.   Have<br/>we all had advanced ear training, dictation, solfege.  Many have  learned 300<br/>cents minor by rote through a lifetime of experience.  But this  Fischer chord<br/>goes one better with the just fifth.</p><p>&gt; Nor is it a meantone.</p><p>Tom:  Why not? It could be 1/4-comma meantone on an instrument with 18 notes<br/>in the  octave (Db through to B#) where the rogue Cb is simply played<br/>as a B. In this  case the lack of double sharps is due to their absence<br/>on the  instrument.</p><p>Johnny: You rogue, you, trying to disguise a  Cb.  It has been pretty obvious<br/>to me which composer notations are for  subsemitonia.  Colonna, Vicentino.<br/>Mostly, subsemitonia help prevent  retuning, not for extended chromatics.  Do<br/>you know of a(ny) piece intended  for subsemitonia in the baroque?  I can&apos;t<br/>think of one, and I think it a  wrong response for Fischer.  Any subsemitonia<br/>keyboards in Bohemia at any  time?</p><p>&gt; And it is not equal  temperament.</p><p>Tom: Why not?</p><p>Johnny: a hunch.</p><p>&gt; Fischer&apos;s choice of  keys (and mode) are indicative of having a good<br/>ear for<br/>&gt; what sits  best in each -- distinctive -- scale (or mode).</p><p>Tom:  How could you  judge this if you don&apos;t know the tuning and you don&apos;t<br/>know the  music?</p><p>Johnny: That&apos;s what composers do.  That&apos;s what Bach  did.  That&apos;s likely what<br/>Fischer did.  Otherwise, composing is just  crunching numbers.</p><p>Tom: The usual historian&apos;s fallacy is to assume  some kind of tuning for a<br/>given piece of music; then remark simultaneously 1)  how well the music<br/>is written to match the tuning 2) how well the tuning  suits the music;<br/>then to imagine that this has proved something worth  knowing. Johnny<br/>has gone one better: he doesn&apos;t know either the tuning or the  music,<br/>yet he can still praise the choice of keys.</p><p>Johnny: Hopefully, some of what I wrote above is  a fitting response to my<br/>exploration of music of the past.  I looked to  you, with information at hand,<br/>to further inform on Fischer.  To some  degree, you have been very helpful,<br/>even if you don&apos;t like conclusions different  than yours.  Tom, do you snap your<br/>fingers on 1 and 3 in compound measures  in Jazz?  Musicians don&apos;t indicate<br/>everything on paper.  Swing is a  tough concept to extend on paper, and I don&apos;t<br/>think it every has.  But it&apos;s  everywhere in the music.</p><p>Keys have had sentiments attached to them as long  as they were perceived as<br/>different from each other.  Your listening back  is limited at best, as it is<br/>for everybody until they have hands on  opportunities to listen and experience<br/>music in different tunings.   Thankfully, some of us have had these<br/>experiences.  You are right to point  out some of the prejudices.</p><p>More to the point, I&apos;m using a multiple choice  idea for discovery the tuning<br/>of Bach.  (Ready to LOL or to cry?).  If  I can categorize tunings in such a<br/>way as to delimit all the possibilities to  the fewest possible choices, only<br/>to disprove them one at a time, I should be  left with only won of the<br/>possible multiple choice answers.</p><p>Tom: By the way, since Fischer&apos;s range of fifths  goes round the entire<br/>circle, can we count him as a non-Thuringian advocate  of circulation?</p><p>Johnny:  Obviously, only my remarks  about Thuringians were about an<br/>aesthetic for unequal scales that are clearly  distinctive from one another.  Fischer<br/>was clearly in Germanic culture,  like Neidhardt, so they must be attuned to<br/>the proclamations of  Werckmeister.</p><p>Tom:  Same thing could be remarked about  Heinichen, whose continuo exercises<br/>(1711) include each element of the  circle, and who actually invented<br/>the &apos;musical circle&apos; as a practical  graphical device.</p><p>Johnny:  Um, 1711 years after Werckmeister  died.  The circle as an idea is<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s, even if the graphic  representation is Heinichen&apos;s.  The idea<br/>of a closed circle was spreading,  as were enharmonic identities, like found<br/>apparently in Fischer.</p><p>Tom:  &apos;Heinichen in his 1711 treatise  showed that it was while a harpsichord<br/>student of Kuhnau that the concept of  a &quot;musical circle&quot; relating all<br/>the major and minor keys originated.&apos;<br/>_http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/heinichen.html_<br/>(<a href="http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/heinichen.html">http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/heinichen.html</a>)</p><p>Johnny:  I haven&apos;t looked yet at your  link.  I hope to soon.  But let me add<br/>that Kuhnau would have been  quite familiar with Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>accomplishments, even long distance friends,  as Werckmeister was to have with Walther.</p><p>Tom:  Saxony, and to be precise Leipzig,  emerges as another nest of<br/>circulating activity around 1700.</p><p>Johnny:  Yes, it comes out of the liberation  of the keyboard as a virtuoso<br/>instrument in improvisation.  Saxony and  Thuringia, with the huge percentage<br/>of churches they have, would be at the  cutting edge of this interest, a<br/>circular tuning where every key would function  acceptably to norms.</p><p>Remember, Werckmeister worked in cities that  began with what is Werckmeister<br/>IV.  Barring the confusion created by  number an earlier tuning to a more<br/>recent innovation (WIII), the Wiki use of 2  names for each tuning, ala Barbour,<br/>is unfortunate.  Musicians accept the  English horn as neither English nor a<br/>horn.  But when you, Wiki, give  choices, it&apos;s screwy.</p><p>Andreas Werckmeister determined the name of  each of six tunings on a<br/>monochord in 1691.  They should remain  consistent.  On the hand, gee, there may be<br/>some mathematical errors in  Werckmeister.  There&apos;s a big mathematical error in<br/>John Dowland&apos;s fretted  tuning that has been corrected.  As a mathematically<br/>challenged individual,  I would be indignant to unfair responses that miss the<br/>forest for the  tree.</p><p>Tom:  If you want to make something  unequal out of Fischer, you could get a<br/>copy of the music (Performers&apos;  Facsimiles, New York, Broude Bros.) and<br/>count the number of times each major  third appears in a consonant<br/>chord, like Barnes did with part of the WTC.  Ariadne is a lot shorter,<br/>so you should be able to do a more complete  job!</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>Johnny:  Thanks for the extra work.  Guess  you attacking Barnes for not<br/>doing a more complete job?</p><p>I&apos;ll get back to you on Fischer when I obtain the  materials.  Promise.</p><p>Johny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=74123 href="#74123">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2007 1:18:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tom, it sounds like you believe Fischer is  ET.  Fine.  As this Fischer<br/>&gt; business is only tangential to my actual  work, I find it<br/>intriguing.

However, it is obviously impossible<br/>for me to give any meaningful or useful summary that would enable<br/>anyone to draw informed conclusions without actually studying the<br/>music. And I don&apos;t think it is a good use of my time, or this list, to<br/>spend hours carefully cataloguing the key and tonal extent of each<br/>piece, let alone the thematic content, etc. etc. so that Johnny can<br/>marginally improve his speculations.</p><p>Even then we couldn&apos;t get very far, simply because of the lack of<br/>clear contemporary evidence, and the historian&apos;s fallacy that I<br/>mentioned before: in only very few cases is it possible just by<br/>looking at the music to know what temperament was expected or wanted.<br/>Johnny mentions enharmonics used within the same piece: but all<br/>circulating tunings, and some not-really-circulating ones such as<br/>temperament ordinare, permit the use of enharmonics without (much)<br/>dissonance.</p><p>And even then, some &apos;wrong&apos; enharmonics can sound perfectly OK in<br/>context.

I&apos;m over  here...Tom!  over here.<br/>Someone thank Tom for me for putting up Wiki for Fischer.  Guess he  doesn&apos;t<br/>have any control on the Fischer article.</p><p>_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Caspar_Ferdinand_Fischer_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Caspar_Ferdinand_Fischer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Caspar_Ferdinand_Fischer</a>)</p><p>Johnny:  According to Wiki, &quot;This is a collection of _pipe organ_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ</a>)   pieces (most written for _manuals_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_(music)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_(music)</a>)  only or have  optional _pedal_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_clavier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_clavier</a>) ) in two parts.   So why all the discussion<br/>on subsemitonia?  Clearly Wiki doesn&apos;t think it  likely or even worth<br/>mentioned?</p><p>Similarly, you now seem to agree that a Werckmeister tuning is quite<br/>possible for Fischer.  But there is no mention of Werckmeister at all in  the Wiki<br/>article on Werckmeister?</p><p>And may have recalled incorrectly, but didn&apos;t you say the Fischer Phrygian<br/>scale was on B; Wiki says it is based on E.<br/>    *   The first part contains twenty preludes and _fugues_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue</a>)  in nineteen different _keys_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)</a>)  and one in the _Phrygian mode_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_mode">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_mode</a>)  based on  E. It is considered a significant precursor to<br/>_Johann Sebastian  Bach_ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach</a>) &apos;s<br/>_The  Well-Tempered Clavier_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier</a>) . Bach held Fischer&apos;s work in high regard.</p><p>Johnny:  And I agree, enough from me about Fischer since I have not  seen the<br/>music itself.</p><p>Tom: Johnny mentions enharmonics used within the same piece: but  all<br/>circulating tunings, and some not-really-circulating ones such  as<br/>temperament ordinare, permit the use of enharmonics without  (much)<br/>dissonance.</p><p>Johnny: I am not familiar that much with temperament ordinaire; was it used<br/>throughout Germany at any time?</p><p>Tom:  And even then, some &apos;wrong&apos; enharmonics can sound perfectly  OK in<br/>context. (Try C#-B-F-A in quarter-comma meantone, as a  modified<br/>dominant for F# minor.) Louis Couperin used Eb and D# within the  same<br/>piece (a long chaconne or passacaglia in G/g) but I don&apos;t think  that<br/>shows anything except that this note was probably adjusted between  the<br/>two meantone extremes according to taste. And your taste (and mine)  is<br/>probably not very much like that of Louie&apos;s harpsichord-playing  comrades.</p><p>Johnny: Absolutely, our taste is suspect.  Can anyone on the list  state when<br/>enharmonic identities arrived pre-Werckmeister?  If not, it is  not pertinent<br/>to Fischer, not if a different series of tuning traditions are in  place.</p><p>Tom: The reason why I am sceptical is that we are not putting on  a<br/>performance here, we are (hopefully) trying to do history. In the  case<br/>of Ariadne, there are half a dozen reasonable hypotheses.

(I guess that was directed to me.)   Except that the<br/>Wiki says that use of the pedals was optional for only 2  pieces.  And there<br/>was nothing about extra chromatics.  This leaves  ET, and a Werckmeister-like<br/>tuning, which has been left out all together by  Wiki, even though it is more<br/>likely, historically, than ET for Fischer&apos;s  piece.</p><p>Tom:  Now what reason could you have to put one of these possibilities  in<br/>front of any other, as a historical fact - rather than as something<br/>you  would personally like to be true?</p><p>Johnny:  The most important reason of all is that 99.99% of all  recordings<br/>of music is recorded in ET.  Only by an emphasis on a new  recognition of a<br/>historical likelihood that baroque music in the Germanic lands  used a non-ET<br/>aesthetic in their tunings will there ever be a likelihood of new  recordings,<br/>and performances, in historically sensitive tunings.  It&apos;s not  what I want to<br/>be true, it&apos;s that any unequal tuning will sound more like  another unequal<br/>tuning that it does to an ET tuning.  It&apos;s not only about  pitch height, and not<br/>only about training the fingers to play in different keys,  there is also the<br/>sentiments.  Read about it, it&apos;s in the literature.</p><p>Tom: Also, C# m a j o r (which is the chord Fischer&apos;s C# minor  prelude<br/>finishes in) in &apos;Werckmeister III&apos; has a major third of 408  cents.</p><p>Johnny:  Problem with not having the score.  You said...Tom  said....a C#<br/>minor prelude ending on C#, but he didn&apos;t indicate the Piccardy  third major<br/>chord on C#.  I think I have already made it clear I will  research Fischer<br/>further...if not...I do declare it hereforth.</p><p>Tom:  This is the eternal question for WIII-fans: how much  Pythagorean<br/>intonation are you prepared to tolerate. Werckmeister himself  said<br/>that if you tune 4 pure fifths one after another, the result  is<br/>unpleasant...</p><p>Johnny:  True that.</p><p>Tom:  Fischer certainly doesn&apos;t avoid using the chords of F#<br/>major,  C# major, Ab major, often fully voiced. Rather than thinning<br/>down the harmony  in supposedly &apos;difficult&apos; keys (as Bach seems to do<br/>in some preludes of WTC  1), Fischer often loads the table.</p><p>Johnny:  Bach did not, especially if one supposes an unequal like  WIII, try<br/>to emphasize different keys.  Exceptions include the Chromatic  Fantasy and<br/>Fugue in D minor and the St. Matthew&apos;s Passion, which I believe  should be<br/>thought of as beginning in D minor.</p><p>Tom:  By the way, I am responsible for many aspects of the current  state of<br/>the wiki page<br/>_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament_<br/>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament</a>)<br/>and  I believe the explanation of the numbering is clear, transparent<br/>and  accurate.
