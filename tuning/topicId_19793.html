I checked my Maj 3rd against one of the kotos during a<br/>rehearsal, and her 3rd was higher than 12 eq...probably based off of a<br/>non tempered cycle of 5ths. Yoko Hiraoka and I chatted a bit about<br/>tunings...she said she would tune her 1/2 step to 90 cents, but she<br/>sometimes used 85 cents instead. It&apos;s funny how much, at times, the koto<br/>and 12 tone guitar would sound very close...yet, at other times, they<br/>were obviously not in synch. Also, I found that I was more interested in<br/>just playing music, rather than trying to figure out the tunings<br/>involved (although I was curious). And, I began using my fretless to<br/>play Sakura with Yoko, and just tried to find the pitches by ear..and I<br/>did. I get the feeling that tuning theory, per se, was not a big part of<br/>either koto player&apos;s training...not unlike western musicians. I have<br/>been told that Japanese music derives from Chinese, which would seem to<br/>indicate a 5ths based system...also, since a lot of traditional Japanese<br/>music uses pentatonic scales, the 5ths based system is a natural.<br/>    Then, on the other hand, I&apos;ll bet there&apos;s a lot of individual<br/>tweaking that may go on from player to player, depending on the tune and<br/>the ear of the player...kotos are mighty flexible. Also, of great<br/>interest to me, was the fact that, although many Japanese tunes are<br/>basically pentatonic, I found as many as 11 separate tones in one<br/>particular piece; and, Yoko would do some mighty microtonal sounding<br/>bends in other pieces. It seems that it may be  a bit over simplistic to<br/>categorize Japanese/Chinese music as pentatonic...at least, that&apos;s been<br/>my experience. I would invite any Oriental players on this list to add<br/>their viewpoint...hope this helps..Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=19799 href="#19799">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2001 1:46:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I thought that they where in Pythagorean, tuned in fourths.
