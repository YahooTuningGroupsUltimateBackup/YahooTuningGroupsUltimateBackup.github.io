It<br/>would be nice to see a more accurate (and more detailed) analysis<br/>than what Mr. Grauer gives here.  Perhaps it can be run thru<br/>&apos;Spectrogram&apos;?, since it&apos;s for unaccompanied voices.</p><p>(&apos;Our own&apos; John Chalmers has a contribution to this discussion near<br/>the end of this webpage, but it&apos;s more about rhythm than tuning.)</p><p>&gt; Date: Wed, 10 May 2000 10:26:36 -0400 (EDT)<br/>&gt; Sender: Victor Grauer<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Princes of Dahomey<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert B. Cantrick wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&#x9;Victor Grauer states that the tuning system employed in<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Princes of Dahomey&quot; is esoteric, conforming to no familiar<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals at all.  It seems to me, on the basis of repeating<br/>&gt;&gt; listening during a period of many years in classroom teaching,<br/>&gt;&gt; that there is a simple, familiar interval pattern in the opening<br/>&gt;&gt; song, SONG OF ZOMADOU.  The piece is by unaccompanied chorus in<br/>&gt;&gt; unison throughout.  The simple, familiar interval pattern is<br/>&gt;&gt; (a) a descending minor third, then (b) a descending major third,<br/>&gt;&gt; then (c) the descending minor third an octave lower.  In the<br/>&gt;&gt; following notation I am assuming that there are appoggiaturas<br/>&gt;&gt; which I omit for the sake of showing the fundamental interval<br/>&gt;&gt; scheme<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (a)               c2 down to a1<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (b)                g#1 down to e1<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (c)               c1 down to a<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I am taking c1 as middle c.  This pattern is repeated many times.<br/>&gt;&gt; I assume that the pattern is established by the rhythm, and I am<br/>&gt;&gt; assuming that the rhythm is determined by the words (which I<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t understand).  The rhythm is basically short-long in each<br/>&gt;&gt; descending third.  Again, I omit the appoggiaturas for the sake<br/>&gt;&gt; of simplicity, but my justification for calling them appoggiaturas<br/>&gt;&gt; is the rhythm:  all of them are short.  In other words, an<br/>&gt;&gt; appoggiatura, as I use the word here, can be a third as well as<br/>&gt;&gt; a second.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I must admit I&apos;ve never listened to this music with any degree of<br/>&gt; care and never attempted to notate it.  My reaction was based on<br/>&gt; an overall impression.  Nevertheless, listening now more<br/>&gt; carefully,  I have to stick with my original assessment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For starters, the first note we hear, played by the bell, is<br/>&gt; clearly an f2, no?   The other bell note is roughly a minor 7th<br/>&gt; below, close to tempered g1.   Immediately after this, we hear a<br/>&gt; solo voice singing what I&apos;m hearing as roughly a d#1 followed by<br/>&gt; a g#1, then b1, a#1, g#1. The d# sounds flat to me, I can almost<br/>&gt; hear it as a d natural going up a tritone to g#, but the g# also<br/>&gt; sounds a bit flat.  Later the pitch of the vocalists rises a bit,<br/>&gt; so at some points, yes, I can hear the notes Cantrick is referring<br/>&gt; to: c2, a1, g#1, e1.  But the e1 also sounds flat, almost the<br/>&gt; effect of a tritone with the following a1.  At some points the<br/>&gt; g# sounds closer to a g natural to me.  And sometimes I hear<br/>&gt; something close to a diminished triad, consisting of d#1, c1, a,<br/>&gt; c1.   I agree with Cantrick that, if we ignore what seems to be<br/>&gt; a certain amount of vocal &quot;drift,&quot; one can attempt to produce a<br/>&gt; kind of &quot;ideal&quot; notation using the notes a, c, e and g#.  But on<br/>&gt; the recording at least some of these pitches seem distinctly<br/>&gt; &quot;off&quot; from any of the tunings we&apos;re used to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you try to sing this music I think you&apos;ll see my point rather<br/>&gt; quickly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Victor Grauer<br/>&gt; Chatham College<br/>&gt; Pgh.
