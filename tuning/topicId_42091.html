We had sent Adam Schweigert and Joe Panzner, two students in<br/>Composition and Theory, to Chicago with a University van to greet Lou and<br/>his traveling companion, Todd Burlingame, and drive them back to campus for<br/>the Festival.  Lou does not like to fly and took the train, the California<br/>Zephyr, from near San Francisco to Chicago.  The train arrived at about<br/>5:15 PM.  While en route to Indianapolis, their overnight destination,<br/>Adam, Joe, Lou and Todd decided to stop at a Denny&apos;s restaurant in<br/>Lafayette, Indiana, for some dinner.  Lou stumbled and fell upon getting<br/>out of the vehicle and apparently suffered a heart attack.  He had great<br/>difficulty breathing.  Paramedics were called and they arrived within<br/>minutes. Lou was transported to the hospital but was unable to be revived.<br/>He passed away around 9 or 9:30 PM.     We are  awaiting the coroner&apos;s<br/>report for final confirmation of the cause of death.</p><p>This is a great tragedy for the entire world of music.  Lou was as excited<br/>about the Festival as we were.  Our sympathies go out to all in the world<br/>of music and dance who treasured his great gift.   I will always remember<br/>the joy in his voice when we spoke over the telephone about the Festival.<br/>He was an active participant in planning the concerts.  He had also<br/>prepared a special seminar for OSU students in composition.  He was very<br/>much looking forward to the CSO performances of his Third Symphony in a<br/>final revision that he had just completed.  He told me how honored he felt<br/>to have so many of his compositions performed on the Festival.  Let<br/>everyone know that the Festival will go on as planned as a tribute to this<br/>legendary American musician.</p><p>Lou Harrison will be cremated today; his remains shipped back to<br/>California.   He was eighty-five years old.</p><p>Donald Harris, Professor of Composition &amp; Theory<br/>School of Music, The Ohio State University</p></div><h3><a id=42107 href="#42107">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2003 12:08:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_42091.html#42100">/tuning/topicId_42091.html#42100</a></p><p>&gt; Leta Miller, Lou&apos;s biographer, says that Lou died in Indianapolis.<br/>He<br/>&gt; had been picked up at the Chicago airport by some students who were<br/>&gt; driving him to Ohio State.

I feel privileged to have seen him speak twice,<br/>in LA and San Jose.  His Music Primer contains many truths, and<br/>was part of my first order to the JIN store (along with Doty&apos;s<br/>Primer, Bitter Music, and Michael Harrison&apos;s &quot;From Ancient Worlds&quot;)<br/>which formed my first impressions of the alternate-tuning<br/>universe.  I have since enjoyed much of his recorded music.  In<br/>fact, just 48 hours ago I ordered &quot;Solo Keyboards&quot; from New Albion.</p><p>&gt;If ya gotta go, what a way to go: right in the middle of a trip<br/>&gt;to have your work honored once again.
