Last year I<br/>posted something about the possibility of organising a mini microtonal<br/>festival as part of the larger Edinburgh Festival. Unfortunately, the<br/>way things stand, you have to pay large sums of money, then more money<br/>and then the spending really starts before you play a note. On top of<br/>this you are constantly battling against thrillseekers out on a three<br/>week bender who want to share obscenities with dubious stand up comics.<br/>And that&apos;s just the opera. (I hear some of you begging to be invited).</p><p>Seriously, though,  I don&apos;t think that the Edinburgh Festival would be<br/>an appropriate event for new music and I wouldn&apos;t like to be responsible<br/>for shelling out thousands to invite overseas visitors to play. But<br/>there are other performance possibilities around the UK. There is also<br/>the possibility, with the right approach, of funding from Arts Councils<br/>and certainly in Scotland of the archiving and dissemination of scores<br/>and tapes through the Scottish Music Information Council (SMIC) in<br/>Glasgow. I have always liked the idea of contributing in some way to a<br/>journal dealing with theoretical and practical microtonal issues, a mini<br/>Xenharmonicon, which might be left around or even sent to our<br/>illustrious musical establishments. We could even organise a night out<br/>with Graham to sort out unbelievers : - ) (just joking, I love your work<br/>and scholarship).</p><p>Anyway, all this is in the realm of possibility so I propose that the<br/>first step would be to establish if there are enough of us to begin<br/>small scale with tape exchanges and writing articles or organising<br/>events. I&apos;m willing to act as a point of contact. Nothing ventured,<br/>nothing gained. Private or list emails as you wish.</p><p>I&apos;m expecting someone to pop up and say that there is already this or<br/>that forum in the UK. With respect to what else is going on, if it&apos;s not<br/>making itself known to this list then it&apos;s not wired up properly.  I&apos;d<br/>rather gravitate towards  the expertise and inspiration we have from the<br/>regular theoreticians and musicians on this list as I trust and respect<br/>their academic and musical integrity and their spirit of sharing,<br/>qualities I find sadly lacking in a lot of UK institutions.</p><p>In anticipation...</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2001 12:26:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/21912">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/21912</a></p><p>&gt; That was a ploy to get the attention of the UK visitors to<br/>&gt; this list.

I would like to encourage this, then we can be<br/>honest about whether we think there is enough  variety and quality to merit performances. Another<br/>option would be to build a UK microtonal site and keep it alive with streamed audio, scores and<br/>theoretical issues. If it was publicised around the right places it should arouses some interest.</p><p>&gt; Expect some might want to play or demonstrate instruments<br/>&gt; and tunings, or to improvise, or some to give papers, and some<br/>&gt; might just want to swell the audience and listen<br/>&gt; and meet everyone, first time anyway.</p><p>I could offer to play my 22 tet guitar pieces. For other pieces the instruments would need to be<br/>built or modified and players/singers trained but till that happens good sampler/midi realisations<br/>would be a start. That&apos;s a starting point for collaborations.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Edinburgh is pretty accessible for me as I have relatives<br/>&gt; who live near Ed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I&apos;m in Oxford myself, but with my mother and sisters in Scotland,<br/>&gt; - on the islands of Skye and Mull, and in the borders).</p><p>I&apos;m in Jedburgh in the Borders so that&apos;s useful to know.</p><p>&gt; I wonder if there is any possibility of a music dept hosting<br/>&gt; this kind of thing? I know Ed. is strong on historical musical<br/>&gt; instruments, as they have a web site all about it, but don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know about microtonalism, but there is a connection there isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; there anyway, with authentic performance of early music.</p><p>I&apos;m considering approaching Edinburgh University formally but it needs to be done carefully. They<br/>have an attitude and are quite in love with themselves if you get my drift. They are very canny<br/>with money in the Music Department but there are individuals who could pull strings. I think we&apos;d<br/>need to get some work together and make a proposal. For example they have a series of lunchtime<br/>recitals. I know also that the French Institute in Edinburgh would host an event and they are owe<br/>me a few favours. There might in any case be other less &apos;distinguished&apos; universities or<br/>institutions who might help out and I&apos;m working on that too.</p><p>&gt; Could give a little space for players / demonstrators of<br/>&gt; tunings and instruments, and in that sort of situation it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t matter if there is a tiny audience, and maybe it<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t cost much if there was anyone connected with the<br/>&gt; dept. interested, and if the room wasn&apos;t being used for anything else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also plenty of Scottish connections, e.g. with the bagpipe scale<br/>&gt; and I&apos;m sure there are interesting things to learn about<br/>&gt; tunings of early Scottish music.

First some sort of profile would have to be established, to<br/>get the credibility in the first place. I&apos;ve just read Graham&apos;s suggestions and, though it breaks<br/>my heart to say it, I agree that England is probably a more suitable focal point than Edinburgh<br/>for now. For a start as far as I know the current  microtonal population of Scotland is 1.</p><p>It strikes me that the theorists are way ahead of the game and that a well presented paper on the<br/>Miracle and related tunings with electronic or midi pieces would be a sound start. This could be<br/>done in a reasonably short time span given sympathetic music institutions. Perhaps if a UK<br/>microtonal website was up and running concurrently, interest would grow and we&apos;d get the critical<br/>mass for an event.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if these are practical suggestions, just in<br/>&gt; case they suggest anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert</p><p>It&apos;s important to keep the ideas coming.  It&apos;s most encouraging that some interest has ignited,<br/>particularly in the light of the remarkable recent discoveries. Although I had no part in it I<br/>will use the findings to compose but for now I think that Graham is right to be thinking of<br/>presentations and I&apos;ll do all I can to get him a foot in the door. Maybe some sort of intro-spiel<br/>for heads of music departments would be useful with a going rate fee. If the findings are to make<br/>any impression in the academic journals, one could tempt departments by offering them the chance<br/>to say, &quot;you heard about it here first&quot;.</p><p>Well lots more ideas.
