What other<br/>books should I seriously consider next?  Monzo&apos;s JustMusic?<br/>What about Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale?</p><p>My other question is, how can I search the tuning list messages<br/>without going through the slow process of searching only a<br/>small portion at once as happens when using the search part of<br/>the message index?  I know that google find old tuning list<br/>messages sometimes.

At this point I want to know if<br/>&gt; I&apos;m missing some fundamental concept(s) or perspectives.</p><p>Perhaps we all are. In addition to the fundamental concepts and<br/>perspectives that you come into frequent contact with on these lists,<br/>there are philosophies of microtonality that eschew all reference to<br/>ratios, acoustics, psychoacoustics, tonal harmony, etc., and are<br/>interested in progressing 20th century art music forwards through the<br/>novelty of adding new pitches. For example the composers Haba,<br/>Wychnegradsky, and currently the Boston Microtonal Society would fall<br/>into this category.</p><p>&gt; Also<br/>&gt; I want to know both for myself learning and to have available for<br/>&gt; others if there exist any equal or better books describing tuning<br/>&gt; fundamentals in addition to those I have.</p><p>Did you see my recent post on non-web reading recommendations? That<br/>should cover some bases that your collection doesn&apos;t. Also I can ask<br/>you to read my papers, though that may be too biased on my part. I<br/>don&apos;t think any one book is that great on its own -- for example<br/>Mandelbaum&apos;s book is deeply self-contradictory in one respect -- but<br/>at the same time, you have to reach a certain point where you take<br/>off on your own wings, since reading everything possibly relevant<br/>could itself take a lifetime!</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I&apos;m quite aware of the value of rereading things.  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; part-way into rerereading Harmonic Experience, and I&apos;m well into<br/>&gt; a first reading of both Helmholtz and Blackwood, and I&apos;ve read<br/>&gt; everything else I listed except Genesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My impression is that &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot; seems<br/>&gt; like it actually presents some unique perspectives.  What do you<br/>&gt; think?  Is is worthwhile?  (I&apos;m of course asking everyone, not just<br/>&gt; Paul).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron</p><p>Aaron, I&apos;m actually in the process of helping Bill Sethares write a<br/>revised version of this book. I feel there may have been some severe<br/>limitations in the original, and my hope is that I&apos;ll be able to give<br/>my highest recommendation to the upcoming revision when it is<br/>printed. Until then, the same basic point is made in many other<br/>places, such as in Wendy Carlos&apos;s articles and in what Sethares has<br/>on the web, so you won&apos;t necessarily be missing any fundamental ideas.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p></div>
