Once a &quot;microtone&quot; was<br/>an interval smaller than a semitone (Harvard Dictionary of Music).  Now that<br/>we have evolved (a verb?) the term &quot;microtone&quot; to include any interval of<br/>integrity that differs from a strict 12-TET model, the amount of microtones<br/>to non-microtones is ridiculous.</p><p>I usually calculate by the cent but I&apos;ve noticed that Kyle Gann counts fewer<br/>than 250 as usable musical intervals.</p><p>Microtonality is the discipline that contains all the sub-disciplines dealing<br/>with tuning and music.  Over the years we have established a virtual<br/>university on the net through this list.  The sub-disciplines expressed<br/>include composition, performance, scholarship, speculative theory, instrument<br/>making and design, technology, abstract mathematics, and a few that skip my<br/>mind right now.</p><p>It&apos;s time to own this term &quot;Microtonality&quot; so that the science of what we do<br/>is recognized as both credible and sought out.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>Paul H.

In music history such use of small intervals is<br/>&gt;extremely rare; I have more than one posted a request on this list for<br/>anyone<br/>&gt;to come up with an example of enharmonic melodic practice outside of the<br/>&gt;classical Greek world.  Aside from a few scattered attempts to imitate the<br/>&gt;Greek practice (Vincentino, Slonimsky, Partch, and Darreg come to mind), it</p><p>&gt;seems to have been unique to that culture and without further resonance.</p><p>The best piece I&apos;ve written in 22-tET so far actually uses the smallest<br/>interval almost exclusively in the melody. It is called _TIBIA_ and is<br/>available on the Tuning Digest Tape Swap from 1997 (ask Gary Morrison for a<br/>copy) and I performed it at the Microthon. I sang it in the shower quite a<br/>bit after writing it in 1996. It&apos;s almost impossible to sing without<br/>imagining the harmony, though.</p></div><h3>Zhang2323@aol.com</h3><span>12/3/1999 10:40:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/03/1999 03:42:40 PM,<br/>&gt;From: Patrick Pagano &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;or how about evil temperment for ET<br/>&gt;and Pure sound for JI<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;hahahahahahahahahahahaha</p><p>::flicks Pagano&apos;s ear:: ...very funny, Pat... *snarfle*</p><p>[&quot;snarfle&quot; = snicker + snort + churtle/chuckle/cackle]</p><p>zHANg</p></div><h3>Alyssa Ryvers &#x3C;ryvers@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/1999 7:33:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Well, I rarely post but peruse regularly.</p><p>Seems to me that as I consider sound at it&apos;s most basic, I consider<br/>microtonality being the language with which it can be truly described.</p><p>&quot;Tunings&quot; are &quot;Aesthetics&quot; chosen by humans as we create order.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I hear everything as microtones.<br/>From that basis, we create tunings to make certain expressions possible.</p><p>Equal temperament is an ordering of microtones, as is Just, etc. etc.</p><p>But all are microtones, nonetheless.</p><p>I&apos;m not looking to augment the war here, just include another vote in<br/>the opinion poll.</p><p>My 2c.  :)<br/>--<br/>Alyssa.<br/>__________________<br/>Alyssa Ryvers<br/><a href="http://www.musicnorth.com">www.musicnorth.com</a></p></div>
