Would anyone be interested?</p><p>Although microtonal capable synths don&apos;t require something to be<br/>hooked up in order to make microtonal music, they do require<br/>programming and so on.</p><p>The advantages over relying on a computer running software with<br/>a MIDI interface would be the portablility and general ease of use<br/>you normally get from a dedicated hardware device. As this would<br/>be a new product, we could build it so that the entire Scala archive<br/>could exist in memory with room to spare. It could also interface<br/>directly with Scala, if Manuel collaborates.</p><p>What do you think? If you like the idea, are there any other functions<br/>you would like to see in such a product?</p><p>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi instruments</p></div>
