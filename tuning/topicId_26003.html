I&apos;m sure there are other active<br/>&gt; microtonal composers<br/>&gt; and performers on the list than these 17 examples, but still, 17 people<br/>&gt; constitutes something like<br/>&gt; 3 1/2% of the total number of people subscribed to the list.  All accounted<br/>&gt; for, how many active<br/>&gt; composers are we up to?  Would it be about three times that, or 10%?  Even if<br/>&gt; it&apos;s twice that<br/>&gt; number, we&apos;re only up to 20%.</p><p>Hi,</p><p>Just for the record, although I don&apos;t post to the list very often, I am an<br/>active (but uncounted) composer. I&apos;ve composed and/or played some microtonal<br/>music before ever joining the list, and am in the process of composing more<br/>microtonal music, as well as honing my skills at playing it, but haven&apos;t yet<br/>posted anything to the files page. Hopefully this will soon be remedied. In<br/>my current situation, it is not always easy to record and upload music. But<br/>there&apos;s one more to add to the list, for whatever it&apos;s worth. I&apos;m sure there<br/>are others lurking as well.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div>
