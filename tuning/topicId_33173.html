(I had posted this here on July 1 of last year.)</p><p>Yes, I think I remember this.  It seems to have the same biases as staff<br/>notation, but less applicable to meantone.  As it stands, it doesn&apos;t do<br/>72, not that it&apos;d be difficult to change that.  So it&apos;s more a notation<br/>reform thing than a way of tackling the problems of microtonality.  As<br/>such, I expect it&apos;s a great idea doomed to failure.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
