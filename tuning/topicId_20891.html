This is evident<br/>&gt; from a table of decatonic key signatures. To see a correct version of that,<br/>&gt; you may order my paper _The Forms of Tonality_ from Bill Alves.</p><p>I want it, shouldn&apos;t this and other papers from the Microfest go online<br/>somewhere?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;2) Is this orderring, &quot;maximally even&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               baa baa baaa<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; might be maximally even depending on what b and a are. If b and a are 1 and<br/>&gt; 2 or 2 and 1, yes. If b and a are 1 and 3 or 3 and 1, no. Maximal evenness<br/>&gt; is only defined with respect to the cardinality of the &quot;chromatic set&quot;.<br/>&gt; Another reason I don&apos;t like maximal evenness -- why should you have to<br/>&gt; postulate a chromatic set in a musical style which doesn&apos;t make use of one?</p><p>Okay, I was thinking of it in terms of the set of &quot;3 b&apos;s and 7 a&apos;s&quot; rather<br/>than the numeric values.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Is this tuning &quot;proper&quot;? I would say no becuase the<br/>&gt; &gt;largest third (333) is larger than the smallest<br/>&gt; &gt;fourth (1331). Is there a special word fo improper<br/>&gt; &gt;but unique?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean there&apos;s only one impropriety? Like the Pythagorean diatonic?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s what I was asking, demonstrated with three pentatonics.</p><p>        chroma   seconds  thirds   fourths<br/>43343     4,3      7,6     10,11    14,13<br/>42242     4,2      6,4      8,10    12,10<br/>41141     4,1      5,2      6,9     10,7</p><p>As I understand propriety, tuning one has it by having all<br/>&quot;all thirds bigger than all seconds&quot; etc.</p><p>Tuning three certainly doesn&apos;t have this property, BUT, all<br/>intervals are unique. So &quot;7&quot;, despite being a &quot;fourth&quot; between<br/>the two flavors of &quot;third&quot; is still uniquely a fourth. (This<br/>is the special word I was looking for).</p><p>Tuning two is ordered but non-unique, &quot;all thirds are greater<br/>than or equal to all seconds&quot;. If this is not proper then the<br/>12tet diatonic is improper...</p><p>Thanks for the post regarding ways to think of transposability<br/>with decatonics. I like the &apos;disjoint MOS&apos; interpretation the<br/>best.I had considered &apos;multi-step&apos; and &apos;vectors of<br/>accidentals&apos; approaches but couldn&apos;t make them come out &apos;neat&apos;.<br/>In some cases, it looks like this approach may do it, as well<br/>as providing an interesting approach wo working with tunings<br/>which have disjoint sets.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=20910 href="#20910">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
