Their own reactions to various tunings were as valid to them as your<br/>&gt;&gt; reactions are to you. Like you, they made music in the way that sounded most<br/>&gt;&gt; natural to them, and heard various proposed tunings relative to that. What<br/>&gt;&gt; is fascinating is the conviction with which one set of norms felt &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; to a set of musicians in one period, a different set of norms being<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;natural&quot; in another period, and occasionally the _same_ musician will<br/>&gt;&gt; express a _different_ opinion of what sounds best early vs. late in their<br/>&gt;&gt; life (if they lived in a transitional period).</p><p>I originally responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No problem here.</p><p>Upon rereading that passage, and now having the benefit of Margo&apos;s post, it<br/>is clear that Paul and I are using the term &quot;natural&quot; differently. (And it<br/>has been going on since before I joined the List.) Paul evidently is using<br/>the word to mean &quot;preferred&quot; and I am using the word to mean &quot;acoustic,&quot; or<br/>pure JI. In fairness, Paul appears also to believe that _all preference<br/>(therefore &quot;natural,&quot; or &quot;comfortable&quot;) generates from culturization. While<br/>that may be true, that is not primarily what I am concerned with. Because I<br/>have observed pitch-sensitive singers approximating what I believe are JI<br/>tunings (except for the &quot;high third&quot;), I believe (as apparently Zarlino did)<br/>they are &quot;listening to mother nature.&quot;</p><p>Thanks again, Margo.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8804 href="#8804">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

On this we can agree to agree. (Jon<br/>Szanto will be ecstatic!) As I have said recently, I am moving toward the<br/>conclusion that the &quot;high third&quot; cannot be quantified by any single<br/>small-number ratio, however I&apos;m still puzzled by the fact that this<br/>phenomenon can be observed consistently, even with inexperienced singers<br/>whose &quot;culturization&quot; is very suspect and certainly not practiced (in the<br/>&quot;habitual&quot; sense).</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
