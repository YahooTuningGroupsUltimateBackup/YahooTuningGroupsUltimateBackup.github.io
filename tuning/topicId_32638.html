I therefore plan to &quot;tweak&quot; each track once I can acquire a copy of Melodyne which will save.</p><p>The demo at the Mac Expo was particularly interesting because they were using the original 24 track from Abbey Road of Freddy Mercury and Queen for Bohemian Rhapsody, and adjusting Freddy&apos;s voice to sing alternative melodies which were very convincing as solo vocals.</p><p>It was part of a project to produce a surround sound mix of the album.</p><p>--<br/>--  Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a> ------<br/>Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning - LucyScaleDevelopments<br/>For info. &amp; tech. specs. for Tuning &amp; Pi go to:<br/><a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>For LucyTuned Lullabies and free mp3 downloads go to: <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div>
