I&apos;m stopping over in Shenzhen now, ready to<br/>cross the border into Hong Kong before my residence permit<br/>expires.  I think I remember some microtonality in the<br/>university many years ago.  So, if anybody&apos;s still there<br/>and would like to talk about weird rank 2 temperaments or<br/>whatever over the next few days, get in touch.  Either from<br/>this Gmail address, or try my China Mobile number:</p><p>15106101219</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll work in Hong Kong, but still, it&apos;s<br/>worth mentioning because it ends in two meantone ETs and<br/>before them another ET to give pajara or negri.  All that<br/>and no 4&apos;s!</p><p>Anyway, take care</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
