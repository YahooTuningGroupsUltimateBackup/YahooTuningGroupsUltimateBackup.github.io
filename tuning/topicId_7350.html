Agree?  Disagree?</p><p>That sounds fair, but the actual point of the switchover could vary<br/>depending on timbre, tempo, and other factors. Certainly, the first two<br/>notes in the melody of Blackwood&apos;s etude in 16-note equal tuning sound<br/>convincingly like a perfect fifth, even though the actual ratio is far from<br/>3/2 and if the notes were sounded simultaneously would sound more like a<br/>27:40, a dissonant interval. And one of the reasons I like about equal<br/>tunings is that melodic intervals can be transposed to any scale degree and<br/>still sound the same.<br/>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=7373 href="#7373">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/1999 8:25:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;(My tuning methods so far have emphasized vertical tuning and pretty<br/>&gt;much neglected melodic intervals, and I&apos;m trying to gain the<br/>&gt;understanding to change this.)</p><p>John, the procedure described at <a href="http://lumma.org/adaptive.txt">http://lumma.org/adaptive.txt</a> achieves the<br/>theoretical minimum pain possible with every vertical sonority just.

I mean, how much they can deviate from<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; for a given level of &quot;pain&quot;.

Nevertheless, when performing melodically within a<br/>harmonic context containing changing roots, horizontal &quot;targets&quot; are subject<br/>to vertical &quot;correction&quot; upon arrival. But then, life itself is a compromise<br/>at times. :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7432 href="#7432">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 1:38:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;John, the procedure described at <a href="http://lumma.org/adaptive.txt">http://lumma.org/adaptive.txt</a> achieves<br/>&gt;&gt;the theoretical minimum pain possible with every vertical sonority<br/>&gt;&gt;just.
