It bears emphasis, as Judith Conrad has<br/>observed, that the prohibition of parallels in Renaissance<br/>counterpoint is a rule relating to _part-writing_, not always to<br/>sounds. Further, it might apply partially or not at all to certain<br/>genres of keyboard music, as we shall see below.</p><p>In Gothic polyphony up to around 1300, there is no restriction on<br/>parallel fifths in theory or practice, aside from a general precept<br/>that one should prefer a variety of vertical intervals and<br/>motions. While contrary motion is especially favored, parallel fifths<br/>and octaves as well as fourths are a regular part of the texture, and<br/>occur in a great proportion of favorite cadences for three and four<br/>voices.</p><p>As Frank J. Oteri has remarked, this practice nicely fits both with a<br/>musical style where fifths and fourths are the most rich and complex<br/>stable intervals, and with a Pythagorean tuning presenting these<br/>preferred intervals in their ideal ratios of 3:2 and 4:3. In such an<br/>environment, parallel fifths seem as &quot;natural&quot; as parallel thirds in<br/>the Renaissance or Romantic period.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>1. A conditional rule: Ars Nova theory (c. 1300-1420)<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Interestingly, however, this apparent stylistic equilibrium seems to<br/>shift around 1300, when some &quot;modern&quot; discant and counterpoint<br/>treatises begin to present a new rule against consecutive fifths or<br/>octaves in basic two-voice writing. This rule, foreign to traditional<br/>13th-century music, may be seen as one manifestation of the Ars Nova<br/>movement placing itself in contrast to the older Ars Antiqua.</p><p>The new rule, in fact, is associated with the introduction of the term<br/>_contrapunctus_ or &quot;counterpoint,&quot; referring in a strict sense to the<br/>technique of writing for two voices note-against-note (or literally<br/>&quot;point against point&quot;).</p><p>Parallel fifths and octaves are often excluded in these 14th-century<br/>treatises specifically under the conditions of two-voice,<br/>note-against-note, writing -- not if three or more voices are<br/>sounding, and not necessarily in more ornamental writing.</p><p>This _partial_ prohibition of parallel fifths and octaves seems<br/>connected with some other shifting guidelines of the Ars Nova<br/>theorists:</p><p>(1) A positive approval of two or three parallel thirds or sixths --<br/>in contrast to the 13th century, when parallels of all kinds can be<br/>found, but fifths seem often the most favored;</p><p>(2) A change in the status of the fourth (4:3) above the lowest voice<br/>from a concord ranking with-but-after the fifth to a discord, or at<br/>best a &quot;concord _per accidens_&quot; when accompanied, for example, by a<br/>fifth below; and</p><p>(3) A restriction of M2 (9:8), m7 (16:9), and M9 (9:4) to a<br/>&quot;non-essential&quot; role as dissonances -- in contrast to a 13th-century<br/>tradition in which these intervals had some &quot;compatibility.&quot;</p><p>Both the partial prohibition of parallel fifths and octaves, and the<br/>restriction of the M2/m7/M9 family of &quot;9-based&quot; intervals, could be<br/>seen as a significant shift in the &quot;balance of power&quot; of the intervals<br/>toward thirds and sixths.</p><p>However, fifths and (upper) fourths remain the most complex stable<br/>intervals, and the goal of directed cadential progressions;<br/>Pythagorean tuning remains the ideal for a theorist at the end of the<br/>Ars Nova era such as Prosdocimus, who in his counterpoint treatise of<br/>1409 explains that parallel fifths and octaves are avoided because the<br/>purpose of counterpoint is that two voices should not sing the same<br/>thing, but rather than they should sing different but concordant<br/>melodies.</p><p>It bears emphasis that even in two-voice writing, or in simple<br/>note-against-note textures, 14th-century composers do not necessarily<br/>feel bound by the &quot;modern&quot; rule against parallels, any more than<br/>Guillaume de Machaut feels obliged to avoid the bold use of<br/>combinations involving M2, m7, and M9 (whether as the continuation of<br/>an older tradition, or for his own artistic reasons).</p><p>Likewise, in some English styles of writing around the middle to late<br/>14th century, a predilection for thirds and sixths does not exclude<br/>cadences such as this common and very effective 13th-century formula:</p><p>    e&apos;-f&apos;<br/>    d&apos;-c&apos;<br/>    g -f</p><p>(M6-8 + M2-4)</p><p>Both the bold M2 between the upper voices of the first sonority, and<br/>the parallel fifths between the lower voices, demonstrate either that<br/>the &quot;modern&quot; 14th-century rules are indeed to be taken as qualified,<br/>or that composers feel free to write what sounds good to them.</p><p>It is only later, around the middle of the 15th century, that two<br/>events appear to occur at roughly the same time: the _consistent_<br/>avoidance of parallel fifths and octaves in multi-voice textures; and<br/>the move toward meantone temperaments for keyboards.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Renaissance parallels: part-writing, keyboards, and meantone<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Both developments might reasonably be associated with a move from<br/>3-limit to 5-limit systems of harmony and tuning: thirds, ranked as<br/>&quot;imperfect&quot; (i.e. &quot;partial&quot;) concords in 13th-14th century theory, are<br/>approaching musical stability.</p><p>This association might lead one to wonder: might parallel fifths have<br/>sounded especially displeasing, even in a multi-voice texture, on a<br/>keyboard with narrowed or &quot;blunted&quot; (Vicentino, 1555) meantone fifths?<br/>In 1/4-comma meantone with pure major thirds, for example, the fifth<br/>is about 5.38 cents narrower than a just 3:2; might a succession of<br/>two such fifths, as has been suggested here by Frank Oteri, call<br/>attention to this compromise of temperament in an especially blatant<br/>way?</p><p>Looking through some keyboard compositions likely intended for<br/>meantone (e.g. ending on a sonority of c-g-e&apos;), it becomes clear that<br/>the _sound_ of such fifths can hardly be in great disfavor, e.g.</p><p>1    2    3 |<br/>e&apos;   e&apos;   d&apos;<br/>c&apos;        b<br/>a         g</p><p>In vocal and instrumental music alike, consecutive fifths are by no<br/>means excluded if they involve crossing of voices so that parts, to<br/>borrow the earlier words of Prosdocimus, do not &quot;sing the same thing.&quot;<br/>A very common three-voice cadence of the 15th century, although not<br/>necessarily devised specifically to avoid violating the rule against<br/>parallel fifths (which may only have come into consistent observance<br/>after this cadence had become popular), illustrates this point:</p><p>e&apos;-f&apos;<br/>g -f<br/>c -c&apos;</p><p>Here the upper two voices have a standard M6-8 resolution still<br/>recognized in the Renaissance as a leading two-voice cadence; the<br/>lowest voice leaps an octave to arrive at the fifth of the final<br/>sonority. In sound, we have the two consecutive fifths c-g and f-c&apos;.</p><p>Such progressions with &quot;parallel fifths in sound&quot; occur often in<br/>vocal and keyboard music alike, and Vicentino (1555) explicitly notes<br/>that consecutive fifths are not against the rule if the voices cross.</p><p>One radical theorist, Vincenzo Galilei (1581), goes so far as to<br/>challenge the rule against parallel fifths as a principle of<br/>part-writing on this basis: if the fifths continually played on<br/>instruments do not offend the ear, why try to avoid parallelism on<br/>paper? Uncannily mirroring the actual history, he suggests that the<br/>rule originally applied to a texture of two voices only; but unlike<br/>conventional Renaissance theorists, he sees the extension to<br/>multi-voice writing not as a refinement but as a pedantic<br/>extravagance.</p><p>As Kraig Grady rightly points out, Zarlino as an enthuastic exponent<br/>of the rule objects not only to parallel fifths, but also to<br/>consecutive thirds or sixths of the same proportion, for the same<br/>reasons: there is no variety either in the consonances or in the<br/>motions of the voices. However, he adds that the unequal whole-tones<br/>of tertian just intonation for voices (9:8, 10:9) may provide some<br/>variety to mitigate this effect if both voices move conjunctly.</p><p>A curious corollary of this analysis would be that parallel thirds or<br/>sixths of the same size should be more acceptable for voices than for<br/>a keyboard instrument, where a meantone tuning will result in the same<br/>ratios for all regular whole-steps.</p><p>At any rate, Viadana (1602) reflects the situation at the end of the<br/>16th century when he states in his explanatory notes to his collection<br/>of church music for voices and continuo after the new manner: &quot;The<br/>organ part is never under an obligation to avoid two fifths or two<br/>octaves, but those parts which are sung by the voices are.&quot;</p><p>-------------<br/>3. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>As people have noted, there are some interesting tuning-related<br/>reference points in the history of parallel fifths. They are<br/>consistently avoided _on paper in conventional part-writing_ starting<br/>around 1450, the same epoch evidently as the Pythagorean-meantone<br/>transition; and they are &quot;re-admitted&quot; to &quot;serious&quot; practice and<br/>theory on a regular basis at the end of the 19th century<br/>(e.g. Debussy), about the same epoch as the increasing standardization<br/>of 12-tone equal temperament with its almost-pure fifths.</p><p>Yet the acceptance of parallel fifths in sound during the Renaissance,<br/>and their frequent occurrence in keyboard music, suggests that<br/>interactions of this kind are more complex than they might seem,<br/>involving something more than a case of &quot;You compose what you tune.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
