Inspired by the integrity of Javanese and<br/>African dance and musical traditions, they decided to create what American<br/>composer Harry Partch called &quot;Corporeal music&quot;, an art form that kept dance<br/>and theater as the ritual parameters for music. Carrying instruments from<br/>the Javanese Gamelan orchestra back to New York City, Gburek built frames<br/>for the iron and bronze keys of the xylophonesque instruments and, along<br/>with the two-stringed fiddle called rebab (now electrified), bonang,<br/>electro-acoustic mbira, and new percussion instruments built from scrap<br/>metal, he began performing with Greenhill at local venues. By March of 1999<br/>Djalma already had its first new member, Neel Murgai, playing sitar and<br/>Persian daf. Bridging and blinding the gaps between the Indian and Javanese<br/>tonal systems, the ensemble now had a core offset from the by now<br/>traditional free jazz/improv/noise/new music and world music sounds,<br/>achieved by re-tuning of the instruments and rethinking the ways of playing<br/>them. In the summer of 1999 rehearsal began with two new members, Rich<br/>Gross on clarinet and Chris Forsyth on electric guitar, both sonic<br/>chameleons without parallel who had been working together in the guitar trio<br/>All Time Present. One of the first performances took place at the<br/>adventurous C.O.M.A. series at ABC No Rio on the Lower East Side and was<br/>attended by the flautist Muriel Vergnaud who soon thereafter joined the<br/>group.</p><p>Since then Djalma has performed with full arsenal at The Cooler, Knitting<br/>Factory and other venues familiar to the improv scene, including a stint on<br/>New Year&iacute;s 1999 on Free Radio 103.5 in Williamsburg  with Daniel Carter,<br/>Blaise Siwula and Eyedoor, in a full evening&iacute;s tribute to the spirit of<br/>American sonic creativity. But the group has also performed out of doors,<br/>following Julie Greenhill&iacute;s  vision of site-specific dance, performing in<br/>the parks and street meridians where the dream-effect of the dance clashes<br/>with the realities of daily-life&iacute;s dream. The most recent performances have<br/>been duets for Greenhill and Gburek in Berlin at the Post Furhampt Festival<br/>2000 and in Grosseto and Roccataderighi, both in Tuscany. Djalma&iacute;s CD, &apos;the<br/>rags of larium pali&euml;&apos; has been issued by Orphan Sounds.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
