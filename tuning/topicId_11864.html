It&apos;s in that vol. 1 of Guy Murchie&apos;s Music<br/>&gt; &gt; of the Spheres though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have to keep an eye out for this book. Another<br/>&gt; semi-related book is Jesus Christ, Sun of God (that&apos;s<br/>&gt; not a typo), Ancient Cosmology and Early Christian Symbolism<br/>&gt; by David Fideler.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lots of talk about ratios, words that numbers,</p><p>That&apos;s how I got started on this subject.  That Hurrian tablet (supposedly the world&apos;s oldest<br/>musical notation but really it wasn&apos;t according to Monzo) said that the number of syllables of<br/>the text were equal to the number of notes of the tablet.  So I got to thinking about some of<br/>the very elaborate games that writers play in their books to hide certain things for their<br/>desired audience of readers.  Berg did something like this too.  Except that his was more for<br/>the humor.   He would construct melodies from the names of his friends using the letters as<br/>notes..  all that music that has influenced the world so was merely letter games for Berg.</p><p>&gt; more<br/>&gt; about gnosis than christianity even though it explains<br/>&gt; some of the symbolism in the bible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I picked my way through this book this summer and<br/>&gt; has anyone noticed that if you:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Convert a 3/2 to decimal = .666<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would make Ozzy smile!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; nada bhrama,<br/>&gt; db<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; * D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>&gt; * 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

By hologram, I mean something like the<br/>traditional hieroglyphic style of Chinese writing except that it<br/>has an internal sequence/logic.  I accomplished this by representing<br/>the changing lines differently.  You can see the new graphic<br/>arrangement at my webpage (it&apos;s about 2 paragraphs down):</p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor">http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor</a></p><p>You can also download the software for free. I use Norton&apos;s anti-virus with the<br/>latest software upgrades so the download is virus free.<br/>Please distribute it to your other I Ching friends.  Thanks.</p><p>symmetric keyboard:<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2000 7:08:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David Beardsley wrote:</p><p>&gt; Lots of talk about ratios, words that numbers,</p><p>I wanted to write words that represent numbers.<br/>Sorry &apos;bout the typo.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
