So instead of the usual 225/224, this scale is based on<br/>making the 126/125 vanish. Specifically, the major third is 388 cents (1.7<br/>cents sharp) and the minor third is 312 cents (3.6 cents flat), resulting<br/>in a perfect fifth of 700 cents (2 cents flat) and an augmented sixth of<br/>964 cents (4.8 cents flat). Here&apos;s a good 12-note subset of this tuning,<br/>which has a number of complete tetrads and triads. (Can anyone find a<br/>better 12-note subset?)</p><p>         A#<br/>      C / \ G<br/>       /   \<br/>B-----F#----C#<br/> \ Ab/ \ Eb/ \<br/>  \ /   \ /   \<br/>   D-----A-----E<br/>    \   / \   / \<br/>     \ /   \ / A#\<br/>      F-----C-----G<br/>       \   / \   /<br/>      B \ / F#\ / C#<br/>         Ab----Eb</p><p>Another interesting thing about this scale is that the &quot;fifths&quot; G-D and E-B<br/>are only about 14 cents flat, which produces noticeable beating, but not<br/>nearly as unpleasant as the syntonic comma in traditional JI. Furthermore,<br/>this scale has a good approximation of 11/8, from taking a major third down<br/>and three minor thirds up (resulting in an interval of 548 cents, only 3.3<br/>cents flat). In the 12-note subset, this 11/8 interval is found between A#<br/>and Eb.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been playing with 7-note &quot;modes&quot; of this scale; in fact, the mode<br/>which led me to discover this tuning is Ab A C C# Eb E F#. Another<br/>interesting mode, which reminds me of some middle-eastern music, is G Ab A#<br/>C D Eb F.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Paul H.

You should contact<br/>Dave Keenan, who has made a very extensive study on these sorts of scales,<br/>but is no longer subscribed to this list. Also Graham Breed (who is<br/>subscribed) should be able to provide some interesting thoughts. I&apos;ve<br/>enjoyed the musical examples you&apos;ve created so far and look forward to<br/>hearing more!</p><p>-Paul Erlich</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@xx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/1999 9:47:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s a reply from Dave Keenan to a message I sent him about the new scale<br/>I&apos;ve been playing with lately:</p><p>&gt;&gt;This is a description of a scale I sent to the tuning list. Paul Erlich<br/>&gt;&gt;suggested that I should contact you, since you&apos;ve done a lot of work with<br/>&gt;&gt;similar scales. Have you heard of anything like this before?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No. I haven&apos;t seen this one before. Thanks. I love these things!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can however describe it as a third (and previously unsuspected) member of<br/>&gt;a class of 12-tone 7-limit tunings for which I don&apos;t have a name. The other<br/>&gt;two members are a 12 of 31-tET (or nearby meantone) that I found (I really<br/>&gt;just converted an existing Just scale to 31-tET/meantone) and a tuning<br/>&gt;where the 225/224 disappears due to Carl Lumma (and we later learned that<br/>&gt;Fokker had described it earlier in Just terms, rather than tempered).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So in mine we distribute the 81/80 and in Lumma&apos;s we distribute the<br/>&gt;225/224. Yours is right in between with its distributed 126/125. Beautiful!<br/>&gt;So it is also intermediate in its tradeoff between the number of available<br/>&gt;7-limit harmonies and their accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually, everything I said above applies not to the 12-tone subset you<br/>&gt;gave, but the ones whose lattices appear below. I think you will find they<br/>&gt;have more 7-limit harmonies. At least they have one more tetrad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      D#----A#<br/>&gt;   F / \ C /   G<br/>&gt;    /   \ /<br/>&gt;   B-----F#<br/>&gt;Db  \ Ab/ \<br/>&gt;     \ /   \<br/>&gt;      D-----A-----E<br/>&gt;       \   / \   / \<br/>&gt;        \ / D#\ / A#\<br/>&gt;         F-----C-----G<br/>&gt;        / \   /<br/>&gt;       / B \ / F#<br/>&gt;      Db----Ab<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We still have E:B and G:D as mild wolves and we still have a good<br/>&gt;approximation to an 8:11, but now it is D#:Ab. Note that the lattice could<br/>&gt;also be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         D#----A#<br/>&gt;      F / \ C /<br/>&gt;       /   \ /<br/>&gt;E-----B-----F#<br/>&gt; \ Db/ \ Ab/ \<br/>&gt;  \ /   \ /   \<br/>&gt;   G-----D-----A<br/>&gt;          \   / \<br/>&gt;           \ / D#\   A#<br/>&gt;            F-----C<br/>&gt;           / \   /<br/>&gt;      E   / B \ / F#<br/>&gt;         Db----Ab<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;but one would normally prefer to have more otonal tetrads than utonal. C:G<br/>&gt;and A:E are now the mild wolves. An obvious possibility is to tune the E<br/>&gt;and G halfway between the two results above, so we get 6 tetrads, with two<br/>&gt;of them, and two triads, having much worse fifths than the others, but no<br/>&gt;longer being wolves. This is getting closer to the 31-tET/meantone case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What this class of tunings (mine, Lumma&apos;s and yours) have in common, apart<br/>&gt;from all being proper 12-tone 7-limit scales, is that if notes are mapped<br/>&gt;to the nearest 31-tET notes, they all come out as the same mode, which, as<br/>&gt;a chain of fifths, looks like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Db Ab .  .  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# .  .  D# A#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So they all have the 3 wolves A#:F, F#:Db and Ab:D#. Lumma&apos;s has an<br/>&gt;additional wolf D:A as the price of all the remaining 7-limit intervals<br/>&gt;getting to within 2 cents of Just (which really *is* Just in my book).<br/>&gt;Yours has two additional (but mild-mannered) wolves, or no wolves but 4 bad<br/>&gt;fifths, and can get the remaining 7-limit intervals within 4.6 cents (the<br/>&gt;tempering you describe has a 5:7 which is 6.5 cents narrow).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I may have considered 126/125 for this purpose and rejected it. I think I<br/>&gt;decided that the errors of 4.6 cents were too close to what was available<br/>&gt;from the meantone case. I may have been too hasty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It would be a worthwhile project to make some tables comparing the<br/>&gt;properties (errors in intervals, numbers of tetrads, triads, consonances)<br/>&gt;of the three tunings (and maybe also a related 7-limit Just tuning). The<br/>&gt;specific tempering chosen for each should be the result of the same kind of<br/>&gt;optimisation e.g. min RMS-error, min max-absolute-error, min<br/>&gt;max-absolute-beat-rate (my current favourite). Or maybe all three optima<br/>&gt;should be examined in all three tunings. Unfortunately I don&apos;t have time to<br/>&gt;pursue this at present. Let me know if you ever do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Feel free to post the above to the tuning list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt;<a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
