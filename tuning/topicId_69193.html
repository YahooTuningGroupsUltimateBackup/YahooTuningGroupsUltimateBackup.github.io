Nothing really stands out, but it does sound like it might be a little unequal (or in any better than expected for ET). Now watch as this one turns out to be 12-ET! But I&apos;m guessing that f.mp3 is the ET one.</p><p>B: Something about this that I can&apos;t quite identify seems a little less solid than the first one. Parts of it sound pretty good though. In any case, it sounds as appropriate as any of the others, and some of the key color variations are effective.</p><p>C: A pleasant tuning. The sequence of key colors around 4:00 has a nice progression effect; you can tell there&apos;s something going on. I&apos;ll tentatively identify this one as the one I like the best, but many of the others are about as good.</p><p>D: This one doesn&apos;t hold up as well as the others. It&apos;s an interesting effect, like playing Beethoven in 15-ET, but some parts really don&apos;t work at all. Parts sound like meantone, and other parts sound like meantone with misspelled notes.</p><p>E: This tuning has a generally pleasant effect, without having much of a distinctive flavor of its own. It does seem appropriate for the organ timbre. This would be my second favorite after C. Or maybe this one is better; it&apos;s really a pretty good fit.</p><p>F: Seems like a pretty generic tuning. I can&apos;t detect any key contrast in the 4:00-4:20 progression. I vote for this one as &quot;most likely to be mistaken for ET&quot;.</p><p>G: I like this one, although after hearing all the others it&apos;s getting harder to point out anything distinctive about it. The key differences are pretty subtle, but it does seem as if some of the keys have a different quality from others.</p></div><h3><a id=69223 href="#69223">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2007 9:23:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, this is pretty long, so I&apos;ll just listen to the fantasia for<br/>now<br/>&gt; and leave the fugue for later.</p><p>Very interesting; I&apos;ll respond but probably not for a while.</p></div><h3><a id=69231 href="#69231">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2007 11:26:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; This for people who want to get serious about it.

It&apos;s gotta be<br/>grail.  It works really well in the introduction with the<br/>diminished chords and pedal point.  It starts to sound<br/>too far out somewhere around 1:15 (where there&apos;s an awkward<br/>upward melodic leap in the tenor).  And the run at 1:39<br/>sounds wrong.  It&apos;s still enjoyable and ear-opening to<br/>listen to the piece, but it wouldn&apos;t be my choice if I<br/>was performing it.</p><p>E is interesting.  Probably my favorite, given the very<br/>limited listening I&apos;m doing.</p><p>I&apos;m surprised 31 didn&apos;t jump out at me.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=69244 href="#69244">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@dividebypi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2007 10:21:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Gene,</p><p>It&apos;s late here and my mind and ears are tired. I wanted to thank you<br/>for doing this.</p><p>Quickly, I want to listen more to this with more critical ears, but I<br/>found that I liked e for it&apos;s attrctive consonance--I would guess off<br/>the bat that this was 31-equal, but I could be wrong.</p><p>c sounded close to equal, at least for the beginning part that I<br/>heard. It seemed that the interval sizes were pretty consistant.</p><p>I&apos;m confident d was grail---it&apos;s out there.</p><p>I&apos;ll comment more as I get more into it...the files are long and I<br/>only got partway in most of the time. I&apos;m fried.</p><p>I wanted to say that I liked the performance---one of the more<br/>realistic MIDI files in terms of expressive articulation and agogic<br/>accent---it was nice to here a MIDI file that didn&apos;t march in strict<br/>metronomic time, but had bouyancy...where did you find it.</p><p>I&apos;m also, on the side, curious how you went about retuning to<br/>31-equal---are you just using a subset of 31-equal, matched to the<br/>gamut (ala 1/4-c. meantone?).

It&apos;s recorded from a live performance,<br/>which gets away from the mechanical sound.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m also, on the side, curious how you went about retuning to<br/>&gt; 31-equal---are you just using a subset of 31-equal, matched to the<br/>&gt; gamut (ala 1/4-c. meantone?). What&apos;s your software and process?</p><p>No, it&apos;s extended meantone.</p><p>(1) I take a midi file and convert it to a seq file, in the<br/>sharps/flats, not numerical, notation.</p><p>(2) I run that through a sed script which produces another file,<br/>where the notation is now numerical in terms of generators--that is,<br/>F is -1, C is 0, G is 1, D is 2 and so forth.</p><p>(3) This is read into Maple as a Maple file, and then I have Maple<br/>programs analyze it. An important thing I look for is the meantone<br/>span of each chord--that is, the farthest up the circle of fifths<br/>minus the farthest down. Hence a G major triad, {1,2,5}, would have a<br/>span of 4. If the span of every chord in the piece is 10 or less, I<br/>have a good starting point, because then every interval is either a<br/>dissonance no matter how you adjust it enharmonically by a diesis up<br/>or down, is a 5-limit consonance, or is a 7 or 9-limit consonace.<br/>That doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m done, but it does mean things are not going to<br/>get totally out of hand.</p><p>(4) I now use the information Maple provides me to edit the seq file,<br/>replacing notes with enharmonic equivalents--ie, adjusting up or down<br/>by a diesis. That is, I swap an Ab for a G# and so forth.</p><p>(5) Then I feed this into the sed script again and iterate the<br/>process.</p><p>Writing a program to automate this process would be possible, and<br/>quite an achievement for someone.</p></div>
