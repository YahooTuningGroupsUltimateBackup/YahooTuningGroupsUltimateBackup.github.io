Thus I should have stated: &quot;Here are<br/>five possible definitions treating JI as either synonymous with RI, or<br/>as a subset; however, Dave Keenan has often discussed a different type<br/>of definition focusing on audible purity rather than mathematics.&quot;</p><p>Turning to the historical discussion, I might first comment that the<br/>real horrors of burning at the stake for heresy in later medieval<br/>Europe, and also for witchcraft on a widespread basis in early modern<br/>or Renaissance Europe, need to be remembered early and often. The year<br/>2008, for example, will mark the 800th anniversary of the so-called<br/>&quot;Albigensian crusade,&quot; actually an act of genocide (1208-1242), which<br/>by around 1230 led to the launching of the Inquisition.</p><p>However, if discussing or advocating the use of the tritone had then<br/>actually been considered a form of heresy -- as opposing war, capital<br/>punishment, or more specifically the execution of those convicted of<br/>heresy and so sentenced often was, by the way -- then a number of<br/>theorists would have been in danger, ranging from Jacobus of Liege<br/>(c. 1325) to the famous Zarlino himself (1558 and later).</p><p>For more detail on this, see my Tritone FAQ at Todd McComb&apos;s fine site<br/>of the Medieval Music and Arts Foundation:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/tritone.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/tritone.html</a></p><p>To give a brief summary from an intonational perspective, I might say<br/>here that Jacobus of Liege in the early 14th century generally<br/>regards the tritone as a strong discord, but observes that this<br/>interval does sometimes occur melodically in certain ecclesiastical<br/>chants. He also distinguishes this tritone equal to three whole-tones<br/>at 9:8, or 729:512 (~611.73 cents), from the _semitritonus_ or<br/>diminished fifth at 1024:729 (~588.27 cents), finding the latter<br/>somewhat less dissonant. He says that these intervals rarely occur<br/>because they are dissonant and awkward to sing, but that their theory<br/>is beautiful.</p><p>In 1357, Johannes Boen specifically approves of the tritone as a<br/>&quot;consonance by situation&quot; (_consonantia per accidens_) if it is placed<br/>in a three-voice sonority above a minor third (e.g. D3-F3-B3, with C4<br/>showing middle C as in MIDI notation).</p><p>Both melodic and vertical tritones occur in 13th-14th century music,<br/>and while some of these intervals may have been altered to perfect<br/>fourths or fifths by performers using unwritten accidentals (e.g. the<br/>usual or _musica recta_ step of Bb in place of B-natural, or<br/>additional &quot;invented&quot; or _musical ficta_ accidentals such as F#), they<br/>could not well all have been avoided. Scholars such as Hans Tischler<br/>and Gordon Anderson have emphasized this point.</p><p>Both Jacobus and Boen are writing in a setting of Pythagorean or<br/>3-limit JI. By the way, Jacobus discusses ratios of 5 and 7,<br/>concluding that they might well be concordant to a considerable degree<br/>on instruments built to use them, but do not fit a musical system<br/>based on well-defined Pythagorean steps. This could be taken as a<br/>statement not of perceived theological evil, but of intonational<br/>inertia, much like: &quot;Ratios of 7 are not necessarily displeasing, but<br/>we don&apos;t use them because they don&apos;t fit well with our 12-tone scale.&quot;</p><p>In fact, Jacobus demonstrates such things as the 28:27 and 135:128<br/>semitones, and the commas of 81:80 and 64:63. Part of his interest<br/>might relate to Greek theory; in any event, he doesn&apos;t consider these<br/>things unmentionable. They are interesting, and potentially<br/>concordant, but inconsistent (begging pardon of Paul Erlich, Dave<br/>Keenan, and others who have made this a term of art) with the<br/>intonational structure he takes as given in practice.</p><p>Johannes Boen also briefly discusses such ratios as 5:1 and 7:1,<br/>showing that they do not coincide with usual Pythagorean intervals.<br/>His approach generally seems pragmatic, and he is ready to describe<br/>the pleasing practical use of such intervals as the tritone and also<br/>the diminished fourth.</p><p>It is interesting that he takes the latter, described as a comma<br/>smaller than the usual major third, as an interval which can be a<br/>&quot;consonance by situation&quot; specifically when it has a regular major<br/>third placed below (e.g. E3-G#3-C4). Thus in the mid-14th century,<br/>this interval at 8192:6561 (~384.36 cents) was evidently regarded as a<br/>&quot;special&quot; interval, much like a diminished fourth in a Renaissance<br/>setting, rather than an independently concordant &quot;schisma third,&quot;<br/>which it became by the early 15th century.</p><p>In the early Renaissance, the increasing treatment of thirds and<br/>sixths as near-stable or even stable concords means that the tritone<br/>or diminished fifth can resolve to such a concord by stepwise contrary<br/>motion, giving it a new significance. By 1558, Zarlino recommends<br/>basic progressions such as B3-F4 to C3-E3, which are indeed<br/>characteristic both of late modal styles (16th and early 17th<br/>centuries) and of major/minor tonality (established by around 1680,<br/>the era of Corelli and Werckmeister).</p><p>Now for the matter of adaptive 5-limit JI and meantone in the<br/>Renaissance. In one case, we have singers splitting or finessing<br/>commas while maintaining or closely approximating just intonation<br/>(under Dave Keenan&apos;s definition of &quot;audible purity,&quot; these two might<br/>be synonymous). In the other, we have a fixed-pitch instrument tuned<br/>to divide the commas -- and possibly to permit an adaptive JI<br/>technique, as with Nicola Vicentino&apos;s two manuals likely tuned at a<br/>distance of 1/4-comma apart (his second archicembalo tuning of 1555).</p><p>Reading around and between the lines, we find that two theorists of<br/>the 16th century reached similar conclusions. Zarlino (1558) remarks<br/>that singers seem to seek pure concords without running into the<br/>commas that one encounters on a keyboard tuned to the syntonic<br/>diatonic; and he later specifically notes that singers can avoid such<br/>difficulties as the 40:27 fifth (around 680 cents, an 81:80 narrower<br/>than 3:2) which would occur in a single 7-note scale of this type.</p><p>His erstwhile student Vincenzo Galilei, however, looks at similar<br/>pragmatic observations of vocal style in another way, suggesting that<br/>such intonation is closest to a meantone tuning, and somewhere between<br/>the tuning with equal semitones (12-EDO) for a lute and the 2/7-comma<br/>temperament he, like Zarlino, prefers for keyboards. While Zarlino<br/>sees this style of intonation as an adaptation of the syntonic<br/>diatonic, Galilei looks at it as more of a quasi-regular tuning.</p><p>Yet Galilei, also, says that while he regards vocal intonation as<br/>different from the syntonic diatonic, it is very similar to this<br/>system. Thus the two famous rivals, Zarlino and Galilei, seem largely<br/>at agreement on this point, at least.</p><p>From this theory we go back to a topic you have raised, Monz, the<br/>reported &quot;rusticities&quot; in Gregorian chant around 800, or in the 9th<br/>century, the same era in which the _rustica lingua Romana_ or Romance<br/>vernacular (e.g. Old French) was winning recognition as the<br/>appropriate language for sermons to the common people, and getting<br/>recorded in written prose and poetry.</p><p>Here there might be a very wide scope for guesses, with 5-limit<br/>intonation only one possibility. How about something like 12:11:10:9,<br/>for example, a kind of intonation associated with Byzantine chant and<br/>also with Near Eastern traditions, and documented in the equable<br/>diatonic of Ptolemy? How about enharmonic or other &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>ornaments which wouldn&apos;t fit a diatonic organ tuning?</p><p>Of course, I would agree that there is very appreciable evidence for a<br/>5-limit or similar tradition among the Vikings, for example -- the<br/>later Hymn to St. Magnus from the Norwegian-controlled Orkney Islands,<br/>and reports by Giraldus Cambrensis around 1200 of a distinctive kind<br/>of part-singing in the North and West of England, which he attributes<br/>to the influence of Scandanavian occupiers.</p><p>Certainly the 9th century was an era of raids from the North, with the<br/>peace settlement in France making the warlike Rollo the Duke of<br/>Normandy coming in 911, as I recall. The acceptance by King Pepin in<br/>757 of an organ as a gift from Constantinople might likewise symbolize<br/>the Byzantine influence, which could have brought a range of<br/>alternative tunings as well, ironically, as the instrument which could<br/>have served to &quot;standardize&quot; a diatonic Pythagorean framework for the<br/>chant.</p><p>What I do want to clarify is that persecution or burning at the stake<br/>for _theological_ heresy should not be equated with the fame or<br/>notoriety that one could earn for advocating unorthodox musical<br/>doctrine. Thus Marchettus of Padua (1318), by introducing a fivefold<br/>division of the tone which some interpreters took to be geometric, won<br/>both the theoretical scorn of Prosdocimus about a century later, who<br/>regarded him as a very bad mathematician although a good practical<br/>musician; and the approval of some other 15th-century writers.<br/>However, I am not aware of anyone making an issue of faith out of<br/>this -- although the same era, sadly, witnesses such events as the<br/>statutory ratification of the burning of heretics in England (1401)<br/>and the burning of Jan Hus at the Council of Constance (1415).</p><p>Similarly, when Ramos published his famous treatise of 1482 poking fun<br/>at the Guidonians, as well as introducing a 5-limit monochord for the<br/>easier instruction of young students confused by intricate Pythagorean<br/>ratios and divisions, he drew much criticism -- but not theological<br/>censure, as far as I am aware.</p><p>Incidentally, Ramos is a defender of the tritone in due place, for<br/>example in defining the medieval Lydian mode with a lower ascending<br/>pentachord of F-G-A-B-C. He quotes his friend Tristan de Silva to say<br/>that a tritone is not the worst musical sin -- a metaphor, but not<br/>evidently one to be taken too literally, given not only the<br/>theoretical recognition of this interval by writers in earlier<br/>centuries, but its occurrence in practice.</p><p>In Zarlino&apos;s scheme, I suspect that stylistic tidiness rather than any<br/>theological consideration excludes 7 from the set of &quot;concordant&quot;<br/>numbers, just as Kepler early in the next century excludes 9, earlier<br/>included by Jacobus of Liege. The stylistic predilection of this<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic era for saturated 5-odd-limit sonorities is<br/>reflected in theological images and allegories, which one can also<br/>find a bit later in Werckmeister.</p><p>Rather than assume that Zarlino was somehow constrained by theology to<br/>regard 4:5:6:7 or 12:14:18:21 as a dissonance, or Kepler so to regard<br/>6:8:9, I would suggest that this was a matter of stylistic perception<br/>or &quot;good taste,&quot; which could, of course, be treated as a basis for<br/>philosophical or theological explanation or allegory.</p><p>Likewise, in 1555, Vicentino, who has few inhibitions about advocating<br/>new ratios such the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; which he describes as an<br/>approximate 11:9 and finds finds rather concordant, considers narrow<br/>or minimal thirds and sevenths which we should describe at near 7:6<br/>and 7:4 as on the discordant side. Factors such as certain categorical<br/>perceptions of basic consonance/dissonance categories, which Vicentino<br/>and Zarlino may have shared despite dramatic differences on other<br/>issues, might explain why neither includes a ratio such as 7:4 among<br/>the concords, although Vicentino is ready so to regard 11:9 to at<br/>least a degree.</p><p>It is significant to recognize that in the year 1600, Giordano Bruno<br/>indeed _was_ burned for heresy; the fact that in that very same year,<br/>Giovanni Maria Artusi could take for granted the acceptability of the<br/>tritone or diminished fifth when treated in the proper fashion, as<br/>opposed to the unconventional one of an unnamed composer easily<br/>recognizable as Claudio Monteverdi, should not distract us from this<br/>act of cruelty and brutality.</p><p>To sum up: the tritone, although considered a dissonance (at least in<br/>itself, as a simple dyad), was recognized as an interval in use by<br/>both medieval and Renaissance theorists. People who want to explain<br/>the apparently rather frequent appearance of the tritone in music<br/>around 1200 from a &quot;low integer ratio&quot; or &quot;audible purity&quot; hypothesis<br/>might argue that the Pythagorean ratios of 729:512 and 1024:729 are<br/>only about 5.76 cents (5120:5103, the 5-7 schisma) from pure ratios of<br/>10:7 and 7:5. Such people might propose that singers would lean toward<br/>these simple ratios.</p><p>Of course, such a hypothesis should take note that in a typical Gothic<br/>style, these intervals resolve to stable fifths and fourths, rather<br/>than to the fully concordant thirds and sixths of a Renaissance style<br/>which set a pattern of tritone tension and resolution also obtaining<br/>in later tonal schemes.</p><p>More generally, I would suggest that musical predilections could<br/>influence intonational preferences in medieval Europe as well as<br/>elsewhere. Thus in England, where some 13th-century pieces have an<br/>audibly different quality than typical Continental pieces since they<br/>treat thirds as fully concordant and indeed sometimes conclusive,<br/>these thirds tend to be associated with ratios of 5:4 and 6:5<br/>(Theinred of Dover, Walter Odington). Odington, in contrast, regards<br/>4:6:9 or 6:8:9 as dissonant, although recognizing that other musicians<br/>may disagree; in the same era Jacobus finds these sonorities<br/>relatively concordant.</p><p>Yet earlier, around 1100, John of Afflighem (sometimes known as John<br/>Cotton) remarks that different people treat organum or polyphony in<br/>different ways, but that he will offer a straightforward approach<br/>based on the principle of contrary motion between the two voices.</p><p>Going yet further back, we find that Guido (c. 1030) describes the<br/>kind of polyphony that he prefers and finds most pleasing, recognizing<br/>not only the basic stable concords or _symphoniae_ (for him especially<br/>the unison, fourth, and in a three-voice texture also the octave, and<br/>only secondarily the fifth), but also major seconds and major or minor<br/>thirds.</p><p>Certainly there are assumptions here about what sounds pleasing or<br/>otherwise, and indeed some passages showing that musicians not only<br/>could differ, but were sometimes aware of these differences and<br/>controversies.</p><p>It is a tragic reality of history that relatively free musical<br/>interchange and dialogue can occur at the same time as mass killings<br/>and even genocide -- consider also the assertive musical independence<br/>of a composer such as William Billings in the 18th century on the<br/>continent traditionally known to some of its indigenous nations as the<br/>Great Turtle Island, and the genocide against many of those nations in<br/>progress during that same era.</p><p>Some medieval music theory has a very refreshingly experimental<br/>quality, reminding me a bit of some Tuning List dialogues, albeit at a<br/>slower pace imposed by the technologies then available. Now, as then,<br/>musical pluralism may or may not imply respect for the basic human<br/>rights guidelines of Amnesty International -- a lesson of which we<br/>might take note at the opening of a new century.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
