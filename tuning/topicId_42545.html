From a message with Chris, I had found that I had made the mistaken assumption that &quot;adaptive&quot; tuning trys to allow modulations to other keys (tonal centers), while adjusting the tuning relationships to a &quot;new tonal center&quot;. (I would think that it still could be used for this purpose.)</p><p>After reading Monz&apos;s Dictionary Description of &quot;adaptive tuning&quot;, I get the impression that the whole idea behind &quot;adaptive&quot; is to reduce the level of disonance to a minimum (from Monz: &quot;which keeps the ratios of simultaneous sounds close to just-intonation while also altering melodic intervals to reduce the retuning motion and/or drift relative to a strict JI realization&quot;). The part on &quot;reducing the retuning motion&quot; is a little vague to me at the moment, and the &quot;drift relative to a strict&quot; seems to be somewhat understandable.</p><p>Does the use of adaptive tuning shift the means of selecting the harmonic fabric used away from the &quot;traditional&quot; root of a chord to how the chord fits to the melody? How would something like polyphony be handled? What do the tuning relationships relate to?</p><p>So, from this I get the idea that adaptive tuning is really just a larger number of steps in a grander scale, all for the purpose of reducing all the intervals to their closest JI interval. If this is the case, does this mean that the relationship on which to base that retuning is related to a key (or tonal center), or is it related only to that specific set of pitches at that given moment? Also, doesn&apos;t this accomplish the task of eliminating the occurance of higher order dissonances, thus accomplishing a similar side effect of 12-edo [or any equal temperment] of making all chords sound the same [although not to the same degree]?</p><p>Is there a set of online example pieces that show the usage of adaptive tuning? Comparisons?</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=42546 href="#42546">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2003 7:27:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael McGonagle &lt;fndsnd@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After reading the messages about John deLaubenfel&apos;s JIRelay, it has<br/>made<br/>&gt; me wonder if the usage of &quot;adaptive&quot; tuning is something that is an<br/>&gt; &quot;automatic&quot; function (ie John&apos;s program determines the pitch<br/>centers),<br/>&gt; or is that something that is still left up to the composer to do?</p><p>either way!</p><p>&gt; I also remember Carl having made a comment about Chris Bailey&apos;s<br/>&gt; recording of his Piano Sonata, and having liked the &quot;adaptive&quot;<br/>tuning.</p><p>it had been retuned by john delaubenfels.</p><p>&gt;  From a message with Chris, I had found that I had made the<br/>mistaken<br/>&gt; assumption that &quot;adaptive&quot; tuning trys to allow modulations to<br/>other<br/>&gt; keys (tonal centers), while adjusting the tuning relationships to<br/>a &quot;new<br/>&gt; tonal center&quot;.
