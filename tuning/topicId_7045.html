Does anyone else have the reaction that<br/>Schubert is the ultimate realization of five-limit music??  Or music,<br/>however it&apos;s tuned, that takes us to the fifth harmonic partial of the<br/>acoustical series??</p><p>Given this impression, Schubert is certainly a prime candidate for tuning<br/>experiments -- the effect is bound to be immense.  Who, exactly on the list<br/>is doing this research and experimentation??  It is Ed Foote, or others as<br/>well?...  I would love to hear the results.</p><p>Regarding the guitar issue.  Yes, it would be &quot;most cool&quot; if Schubert were<br/>a guitarist, however I don&apos;t believe there is any direct evidence to this<br/>effect.  His training, according to Harold Schoenberg, was on piano and<br/>violin.  He did, of course, accompany voice with the piano during the<br/>acclaimed &quot;Schubertiads.&quot;</p><p>There is ample evidence, however, that Schubert actively DISLIKED the<br/>piano, at least for composing, which is undoubtedly a reaction he shares<br/>with Johnny Reinhard.</p><p>From Harold Schonberg&apos;s &quot;The Lives of the Great Composers:</p><p>&quot;Schubert was always short of cash, and never had enough even to rent a<br/>piano, much less buy one.  It made no difference, for he did not need a<br/>piano for composition. HE SAID IT MADE HIM LOSE HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT [Ed.<br/>emphasis].  If he needed a piano, he would go to a friend&apos;s house.  Among<br/>Schubert&apos;s closest friends were Schwind and Eduard von Bauerfield, and the<br/>three of them formed a tiny communistic enclave in which there was no such<br/>thing as private property... -- all was communal.&quot;</p><p>As far as his composing habits were concerned...  it seems that Schubert<br/>worked extremely rapidly and with a fairly regular schedule.  (From<br/>Schonberg):</p><p>&quot;From about 9 in the morning (unless he was suffering from a hangover)<br/>until 2 in the afternoon, he composed.  Then he was on the town.  Unless<br/>invited somewhere to dinner, or to a party, he frequented the cafes...&quot;</p><p>Ok, I am finally off list topic.  Or am I (ha!!)</p><p>Excoriations, vituperations or illuminations welcome...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I might call it &quot;the ultimate<br/>realization of five-limit music in a closed 12-tone system&quot;. Because many of<br/>Schubert&apos;s practices, such as modulating through three consecutive major<br/>thirds and ending up in the same place, depend intimately on having a closed<br/>12-tone system. Few composers before him had this dependency in any<br/>significant measure.</p></div>
