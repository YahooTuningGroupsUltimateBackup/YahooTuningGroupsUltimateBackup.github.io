How is this<br/>discrepancy supposed to be reconciled?</p><p>- Monzo&lt;</p><p>The lower chart is correct. Lou made an idle mistake when adding the a at<br/>the end of the tuning sequence, which should have been 80/63 above the f.<br/>His intention was to notate &quot;5/4 + 64/63&quot;. He later recognized the error,<br/>but he figured that anyone who would go to the trouble of retuning and<br/>tacking their piano would be able to figure it out as well so that it was<br/>better to leave as is than take a knife to the manuscript, which is<br/>typically beautiful.</p><p>_Music for Corneille&apos;s Cinna_ has been frequently performed. I heard it<br/>once at his 65th birthday concert in California and another time in New<br/>York, in the Continuum Erickson/Harrison concert. You can hear Harrison&apos;s<br/>own performance of the piece, along with a demonstration of the tuning, on<br/>the cd accompanying the Miller/Liebermann biography of the composer.</p></div>
