However, I hope to provide a<br/>clear map, below, to a method of realising this tuning<br/>on a wide range of keyboards.</p><p>That includes the one I&apos;m stuck with for now, my<br/>aging Roland E-28.  It has many lovely sounds - or so<br/>_I_ think! - but has limited tuning capacity.  It will<br/>change each of the 12 pitches per octave, in the<br/>range of 64 cents below to 63 cents above the<br/>standard pitch, changing in increments of 1 cent.<br/>The tuning of the same note is identical in all octaves.</p><p>I&apos;ve set out my reasoning in a spreadsheet, which is<br/>available to anyone who requests it by private email.<br/>I extract that reasoning below;   I also include the<br/>final tuning instructions below, tabulated with dots,<br/>for anyone to try out for themselves.  However, the<br/>full table of calculations is too tedious to format<br/>and include in a plain text message (even with dots!)</p><p>The reasoning:<br/>----------------</p><p>(Constructive C&amp;C welcome, of course!)</p><p>The octatonic scale consists of:<br/>  C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G, A, Bb.&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;</p><p>There are four chains of four minor thirds 6/5<br/>implied in this scale:</p><p>o ... The first is A 5/3, C 1/1, Eb 6/5, Gb 36/25.<br/>These are exact ratios from the scale.&#x9;</p><p>o ... The second is a perfect fifth 3/2 higher than<br/>the first: E 5/4, G 3/2, Bb 9/5, Db 27/25.  These<br/>are exact ratios from the scale.&#x9;</p><p>o ... The third is a major third 5/4 higher than the first:<br/>C# 25/24, E 5/4, G 3/2, Bb 9/5.  All are exact ratios<br/>from the scale, except for the C#, which is 648/625<br/>flatter than Db.&#x9;</p><p>o ... The fourth is a minor third 6/5 higher than the<br/>first: C 1/1, Eb 6/5, Gb 36/25, Bbb 216/125.  All<br/>are exact ratios from the scale, except for the Bbb,<br/>which is 648/625 sharper than A.&#x9;</p><p>To complete these four chains, we add C# as an<br/>alternate for Db, and Bbb as an alternate for A.<br/>Extending the chains in either direction produces<br/>more non-scale degrees; Bbb and C# are just the<br/>first two of these.&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;</p><p>Using just the scale degrees and these two alternates:</p><p>o ... The interval C to C# is a (small) semitone 25/24,<br/>just 71 cents.&#x9;</p><p>o ... The interval Eb to E is a (small) semitone 25/24,<br/>just 71 cents.&#x9;</p><p>o ... We assign the symbol # to mean &quot;raise by a (small)<br/>semitone&quot; and b to mean &quot;lower by a (small) semitone&quot;. &#x9;</p><p>o ... Using these symbols we can assign an unequivocal<br/>meaning to every normal note spelling, eg Fb, G# or Cx.&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;<br/>o ... There is a major triad 1/1, 5/4, 3/2 on every other<br/>degree: C, Eb, Gb, A.&#x9;</p><p> ... o ... The major triad on C consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: C 1/1, E 5/4, G 3/2.</p><p> ... o ... The major triad on Eb consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: 6/5 * (1/1, 5/4, 3/2): Eb, G, Bb.</p><p> ... o ... The major triad on Gb consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: 36/25 * (1/1, 5/4, 3/2): Gb, Bb, Db.</p><p> ... o ... The major triad on A consists of the notes:<br/>5/3 * (1/1, 5/4, 3/2): A, C#, E.</p><p> ... These four chords are spelled normally.&#x9;</p><p>o ... There is no major triad rooted on G, Bb, Db or E. &#x9;<br/> ... The major third of the A major triad is C#, which<br/>lies between two scale degrees.&#x9;  It is an alternate<br/>for Db, which is the major third of Bbb major.  The<br/>major triad on Bbb consists of the notes:<br/>216/125 * (1/1, 5/4, 3/2): Bbb, Db, Fb+.  The last of<br/>these, Fb+, is 162/125, just 81/80 sharper than Fb.<br/>It is not a note of the octatonic scale.&#x9;</p><p>o ... There is a minor triad 1/1, 6/5, 3/2 on every other<br/>degree: C, Eb, Gb, A.&#x9;</p><p> ... o ... The minor triad on C consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: C 1/1, Eb 6/5, G 3/2.</p><p> ... o ... The minor triad on Eb consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: 6/5 * (1/1, 6/5, 3/2): Eb, Gb, Bb.</p><p> ... o ... The minor triad on Gb consists of the notes:<br/>36/25 * (1/1, 6/5, 3/2): Gb, Bbb, Db.</p><p> ... o ... The minor triad on A consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: 5/3 * (1/1, 6/5, 3/2): A, C, E.</p><p> ... These four chords are spelled normally.&#x9;</p><p>o ... There is no minor triad rooted on G, Bb, Db or E. &#x9;<br/> ... To create them would require adding their perfect<br/>fifths 3/2 above: D 9/8, F 27/20, Ab 81/50 or B 15/8.&#x9;</p><p>o ... There is a diminished triad 1/1, 6/5, 36/25 on A, C<br/>and Eb, but not on Gb.&#x9;</p><p> ... o ... The diminished triad on A consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: 5/3 * (1/1, 6/5, 36/25): A, C, Eb.</p><p> ... o ... The diminished triad on C consists of scale notes<br/>entirely: C 1/1, Eb 6/5, Gb 36/25.</p><p> ... o ... The diminished triad on Eb consists of the notes:<br/>6/5 * (1/1, 6/5, 36/25): Eb, Gb, Bbb.</p><p> ... These three chords are spelled normally.&#x9;</p><p>o ... There is no diminished triad rooted on Gb.&#x9;<br/> ... To create it would require adding the minor third 6/5<br/>above Bbb 216/125: Dbb 648/625.&#x9;</p><p> --- End of  ---</p><p>Tuning instructions:<br/>----------------------</p><p>Only the notes with a number 1, 2, 3 ... 8) are<br/>scale notes.  The notes 2-k and 7+k are a comma<br/>of size 648/625 below and above notes 2 and 7;<br/>these are the two alternate notes C# and Bbb.<br/>All other named notes are shown only for<br/>completeness, however, most double sharps and<br/>double flats are not shown.</p><p>To tune the octatonic scale with two alternates,<br/>use the table below.  Tune the note with number<br/>&quot;Note No.&quot; and name &quot;Note Name&quot; by using the<br/>12-EDO key normally used as &quot;Use note&quot; and<br/>adjusting its tuning by &quot;adjust note by&quot; cents.</p><p>As will be seen from the table, the tuning is 37<br/>cents sharp relative to A=440 Hertz.</p><p>The &quot;Use note&quot; column also tells you what note<br/>you must play in order to produce the note named<br/>in &quot;Note Name&quot;.  For example, to play a C major<br/>triad, C-E-G, in Just Intonation, you will need to<br/>play the notes normally used for C-F-G# in 12-EDO;<br/>it will seem that you are fingering an F minor triad!<br/>All notes except C, C# and A are played on the note<br/>that would be one semitone higher in 12-EDO.</p><p>Note ..
