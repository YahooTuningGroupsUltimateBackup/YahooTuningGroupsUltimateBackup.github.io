This pitch happens to be notated the same<br/>way (G-) in both the Johnston and HEWM notations.</p><p>The harmony is primarily an alternation of major chords on<br/>G- and F- (which is also spelled the same way in both notations,<br/>and represents 320/243 Otonality).  The F- chord-root is<br/>a 9:8 below the G- root.</p><p>A lot of the music has a blues flavor, and the progressions<br/>to &quot;harmonic 7th chords&quot; on C- (160/81 Otonality, the &quot;IV&quot;)<br/>and D- (10/9 Otonality, the &quot;V&quot;) enhance that effect.</p><p>Unfortunately, my unregistered copy of Cool Edit truncates<br/>all saved files to only the first minute.  So at the very end,<br/>you can hear just a little bit of a beautiful modulation onto<br/>the mediant, 50/27 Otonality, which Johnston notates as B-.<br/>In HEWM notation this would be B--, because prime-factor 5<br/>now has an exponent of 2.</p><p>The music here has the some alternating rocking as the first<br/>section, with the second chord-root again a 9:8 below the first.</p><p>But a look at the score at this point discloses the kinds of<br/>problems we&apos;ve been discussing here.  This 50/27 Otonality,<br/>or B- (Johnston) or B-- (HEWM) chord, which right here is a<br/>&quot;major 7th chord&quot;, is spelled in Johnston&apos;s notation<br/>B- : D#- : F# : A# .  So the two &quot;perfect 5ths&quot; in this<br/>chord are spelled  B- : F#  and  D#- : A# !!  Yuck!</p><p>In HEWM notation this chord would be spelled<br/>B-- : D#--- : F#-- : A#--- , which admittedly is also pretty<br/>ugly-looking.  But at least the &quot;perfect 5ths&quot; make visual<br/>sense:  B-- : F#--  and  D#--- : A#--- .</p><p>This brings up an interesting point in connection with Johnston&apos;s<br/>harmonic practice.  You&apos;ll often find these mediant-related<br/>modulations in his scores, which makes his music a bit different<br/>from the usual.  Music normally tends to modulate according to<br/>Pythagorean root-movement.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking right now that it&apos;s probably more than a coincidence.<br/>The nature of Johnston&apos;s notation keeps the simplest notations<br/>lined up along a 25:24 axis.  So it seems to me that he tends<br/>to modulate along the 5-axis rather than the 3-axis because<br/>it keeps the visual look of his scores the simplest.</p><p>With the profusion of bewildering accidentals in his scores,<br/>I&apos;d bet that this really is a consideration while he&apos;s composing,<br/>whether he&apos;s conscious of it or not.</p><p>Very interesting...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2001 5:00:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/21464">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/21464</a></p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/johnston/jnstn-82.mp3">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/johnston/jnstn-82.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the beginning of the 2nd movement (tempo: Lazy, Rocking)<br/>&gt; from his _8th Quartet_, dated at the end &quot;April 13, 1986&quot;.</p><p>I thought I should say a little more about the harmony.</p><p>The first 3 measures are 5-limit.</p><p>Prime-factor 7 is used starting in measure 4 (~9 seconds).</p><p>Prime-factor 11 enters at the end of measure 5 (~13.5 seconds).</p><p>Prime-factor 13 enters in measure 11 (~31 seconds).</p><p>The modulation occurs at measure 19 (~58.5 seconds).</p><p>This gradual entry of successively higher prime-factors is<br/>quite typical of the Johnston scores I&apos;ve examined.

Be warned: my version<br/>(since it&apos;s done on a computer) is probably the only one that<br/>will ever be tuned as accurately as he would like it to be!</p><p>As I&apos;ve said, Johnston intends for his notation and harmonic<br/>structures to work together to make his music intelligible.<br/>But because of the large number of different prime-factors,<br/>and the correspondingly convoluted notation, it&apos;s more than<br/>most live performers can handle.</p><p>Also, be warned that I use much more _rubato_ in my<br/>interpretations than most other performers.  Some listeners<br/>feel it&apos;s excessive, but I feel that it gives more life<br/>and shape to the music.  (I&apos;m &quot;old school&quot; in this respect:<br/>I got the idea from Mahler/Schoenberg/Webern.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; This brings up an interesting point in connection with Johnston&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic practice.
