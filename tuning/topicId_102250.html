Just &quot;86&quot; by itself could represent more than one temperament, but &quot;86p&quot; is the nearest prime mapping (a.k.a. &quot;patent val&quot;), the temperament which uses the closest approximation of each of the primes.</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22p%2686p&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22p%2686p&limit=11</a></p><p>&gt; So that&apos;s the question: What does the two-EDO notation mean?</p><p>One way of finding or describing regular temperaments is to use a combination of ETs (two for a rank 2 temperament). You can think of the temperament as a kind of weighted average of the two ETs. If the EDO has a letter after it, it represents a temperament having one prime mapped to the second nearest approximation. If it has more than one letter, like that &quot;86ce&quot;, more than one of the primes uses the less accurate mapping (in this case 5 and 11).</p><p>So 86p is this:<br/>&lt;86 136 200 241 298]</p><p>and 86ce is this:<br/>&lt;86 136 199 241 297]</p><p>The &quot;reduced mapping&quot; on the page is just a more convenient mapping of the same temperament, where the first generator is an octave or fraction of an octave, and the second one is reduced to be smaller than the first one. (I use the convention that the second generator is smaller than half the first one, but not everyone follows this convention.)</p><p>To relate the temperament to JI, you can either use the generator tunings with the reduced mapping or the step tunings with the equal temperament mapping. I&apos;ll use the reduced mapping here.</p><p>&#x9;2&#x9;3&#x9;5&#x9;7&#x9;11&#x9;<br/>[&lt;&#x9;2&#x9;4&#x9;4&#x9;7&#x9;6&#x9;]<br/>&lt;&#x9;0&#x9;-9&#x9;7&#x9;-15&#x9;10&#x9;]&gt;</p><p>This is a shorthand notation for describing the mapping of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. To get the prime 2 (the octave), just take 2 of the first generator (599.838). To get the prime 3, take 4 of the first generator (599.838) and -9 of the second (55.289).</p><p>4 * 599.838 - 9 * 55.298 = 1901.67</p><p>If you have the mapping of the primes, you can calculate the tempered equivalent of any interval by finding its prime factors.</p></div><h3><a id=102494 href="#102494">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2012 8:36:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry I failed to respond to this earlier.
