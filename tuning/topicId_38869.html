The discussion by Ramos of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; intervals<br/>on this keyboard suggests meantone rather than a just tuning based on<br/>his monochord or a similar scheme.</p><p>It is noteworthy that in 1496, Gafurius, the champion of Pythagorean<br/>ratios as a basis for the theory of tuning, himself reports that<br/>organists make fifths narrower than pure by &quot;a certain small and<br/>hidden quantity.&quot; This comment also suggests some kind of meantone.</p><p>While ratios of 5 indeed occur in both ancient Greek and medieval Near<br/>Eastern music theory, I might remark that such traditions also present<br/>a variety of other ratios for intervals we would term thirds and<br/>sixths.</p><p>In addition to Pythagorean ratios, both regular and 3-5 schismic,<br/>there are ratios such as 7:6 and 9:7 (the diatonic of Archytas, also<br/>appearing in al-Farabi); 11:7 and 14:11 (e.g. Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic<br/>chromatic); and also a range of neutral or &quot;semi-neutral&quot; ratios<br/>(e.g. 11:9, 27:22, 13:8, 21:13).</p><p>As it happened, ratios of 5:4 and 6:5 nicely fit the stylistic trends<br/>of late 15th-century Europe, with Ramos as an important landmark both<br/>for just intonation theory and for his comments on a 12-note keyboard<br/>likely in a meantone temperament of some kind.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=46794 href="#46794">ðŸ”—</a>Leen van Assendelft &#x3C;leenvanass@wanadoo.nl&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2003 3:37:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To all Tuners</p><p>I feel happy to have entered the tuning group.Thanks to all who reacted to my remarks about Ramos.
