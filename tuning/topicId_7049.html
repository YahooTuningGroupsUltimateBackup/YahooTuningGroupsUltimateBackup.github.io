This is probably just not<br/>possible to hear, making a preference for something else understandable.</p><p>In extended Pythagorean the strings shimmer with difference tones.  Ives<br/>writes in his essay &quot;Some &apos;Quarter-Tone&apos; Impressions&quot; about Thoreau&apos;s<br/>sensitive ears: &quot;Perhaps he caught some of the composite resultants which<br/>other ears don&apos;t catch.  If he did, his inspiration from natural sounds<br/>probably reached its zenith-for is not the simple resultant one of the most<br/>wonderful and mysterious things in nature?&quot;</p><p>The already perfect fifth-tuned strings are ideal for the Pythagorean<br/>harmonies.  Additionally, the chords are widely spaced by the composer so as<br/>to make them more maleable, less offensive to sensitive ears.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
