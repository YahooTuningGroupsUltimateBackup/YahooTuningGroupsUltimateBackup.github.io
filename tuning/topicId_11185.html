In fact, I&apos;ve long had a wish to conduct a study on babies<br/>that would compare their reaction to just major thirds vs. 12-tET<br/>tempered versions, and 4:5:6:7 dom 7th against more dissonant variants.</p><p>To me it does not seem implausible that a 600 cent tritone would be<br/>perceived as unpleasant by babies.

I _hope_ it&apos;s the way they<br/>report this stuff.  Anytime there&apos;s a neurological correlate of behavior,<br/>science seems surprised.  Learning music helps with math?  Just math?  And<br/>why is that surprising??

Erlich wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;While music is of course a cultural construct and creates no<br/>&gt;&gt;evolutionary stresses on its own, the basic aesthetic characteristics<br/>&gt;&gt;of musical sounds could have some degree of universality. As another<br/>&gt;&gt;example, clothing is a cultural construct and yet the perception of<br/>&gt;&gt;certain fabrics being more comfortable than others is relatively<br/>&gt;&gt;universal . . .</p><p>[Kraig Grady wrote:]<br/>&gt;Yes it would be nice if there was such a universality, but we are not<br/>&gt;so fortunate. Pleasing and unpleasant sounds are a result to a very<br/>&gt;large degree, cultural constructs. Otherwise i can only pity those that<br/>&gt;are subjected to the intervals of Pelog at an early age. I doubt this<br/>&gt;is the case and the same test done in Jakarta might result in the fifth<br/>&gt;as being perceived as unpleasant due to its lifelessness The only<br/>&gt;universality seems to be melody, that different tones are strung<br/>&gt;together as heard belonging together. Rhythm is another universal that<br/>&gt;seems to be cross cultural. Consonance and disconance-we can&apos;t even<br/>&gt;come to any consensus on this list!</p><p>Kraig, in an earlier post you raised the concern, in testing performed<br/>on babies, that the prejudices of the tester could distort the results.<br/>I very much agree that such a possibility exists.  But it is also true<br/>that methodologies exist to deal effectively with such problems.  For<br/>example: the babies could be played a series of tones and a videotape<br/>made showing time and the babies&apos; responses.  Another researcher, who<br/>does not know the order of the tones played, could view the videotape<br/>with the sound removed, and record the babies&apos; reactions only against<br/>elapsed time.  Such methods sharply reduce the likelihood of prejudicial<br/>distortions of the results.</p><p>If I&apos;m following exactly the points you&apos;re making, you seem to reject<br/>any possibility of a universal response among babies from different<br/>parts of the world.  Though I&apos;m far from certain, my guess is that you<br/>are mistaken on this point.  Finding the true results is the point of<br/>research, yes?  It seems likely to me that babies may be more consistent<br/>than adults when it comes to their reactions, since they&apos;ve had less<br/>time to build cultural perspectives.</p><p>Can we at least agree that it&apos;s an open question, and that further<br/>research might shed some interesting light?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
