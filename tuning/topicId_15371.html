First, I am delighted we are at<br/>6 years...not bad for us folks out in the wilds of Colorado. Next, this<br/>year featured all local artists, and a variety of tunings/approaches.<br/>Chris Mohr started off with a talk/demonstration of his generalized 53<br/>tone keyboard; Chris spent 20 years writing/recording his 12 tone opera<br/>(with one 19 tone and one 34 tone piece as well), &quot;In the Realm of the<br/>Shadow&quot; (which will be released on Naxos in Feb 2001), and plans to<br/>spend the next 10 years writing a 53 tone oratorio..I am sure he will.<br/>    Next, Harry Grainger, playing Electronic Wind Instrument with midi<br/>accompaniment ( with Barb Halladay, vocal), premiered his piece &quot;Bitch<br/>Slap the Hoot,&quot; which moved from 12 eq to Tibetan to Pierce-Bohlen and<br/>back...a fascinating contrast. This was followed by Ernie Crews, playing<br/>waterphone, a most unique instrument which produced truly otherworldly<br/>sounds...the hall was transfixed. Ernie finished with a brief solo on<br/>his wife&apos;s aluminum mixing bowl. Ernie and Starrett then did a duo<br/>improv, featuring Starrett on fretless bass, and Crews on Jew&apos;s<br/>harp...rather humorous, and a nice change. After this, I joined them for<br/>Starrett&apos;s piece, &quot;Dance of the Mermaids,&quot; which had John playing<br/>harmonics on the bass, and my 19 tone guitar, with Ernie on waterphone.<br/>   After a break, I began with my first fretless piece (electric<br/>guitar), with a tuning of 1/1, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4, 35/32, 21/16...it was<br/>improvised from motives which I composed the week before...fretless is a<br/>hoot, and I plan on doing much more with it. Then, Yoko Hiraoka did a<br/>mesmerizing traditional Japanese piece, featuring her singing and koto<br/>playing...Yoko is a master, and has a lot of depth. After her solo, we<br/>performed &quot;Sakura&quot; together, with my fretless acoustic guitar tuned to<br/>her Japanese pentatonic scale..this was totally improvised. And, to end<br/>the concert, we did &quot;34 Steps,&quot; from my &quot;Acoustic Stick&quot; CD...Yoko tuned<br/>the koto to 34, and played absolutely amazing lines.<br/>    We had about 75 people, including a number of young guitar<br/>students...the most encouraging development this year was that Creative<br/>Music Works produced the show, which meant I could concentrate on my<br/>music instead of the business...an enormous relief. And, it looks like<br/>they might pick it up next year as well. The problem with being out<br/>here, of course, is that we don&apos;t have access to all you coast<br/>fellers...we want to get more folks from around the world involved, and<br/>have already talked to a well known LA performer who has expressed<br/>interest in coming out...I hope to make it happen.<br/>   I am pleased with the way things are happening around the country,<br/>with Reinhard&apos;s monster fest, Schneider and crew in LA moving along, and<br/>a fest next year in El Paso...very encouraging. Hope it continues to<br/>spread, and I believe it will...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=15373 href="#15373">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2000 9:59:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Congratulations Neil, sounds like another great show; the koto in 34<br/>&lt;!&gt;, awesome...</p><p>Also I&apos;d like to wish everybody here who will be contributing to this<br/>weekends mammoth microthon a big ol&apos; heartfelt good luck -- GOOD LUCK!</p><p>My hat&apos;s really off to folks like Johnny and Neil who bring these<br/>types of microtonal events to life year in and year out...</p><p>Bravo!</p><p>-- Dan Stearns</p></div>
