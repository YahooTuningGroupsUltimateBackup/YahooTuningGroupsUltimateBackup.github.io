It turned out that it was the tempo alone that was preventing the TX81Z from receiving the midi file. Once I lowered the tempo, then played the file, the TX switched to the full keyboard edit mode and I was able to see the midi being transmitted on the front panel. Brilliance! The TX81Z is a very important instrument for me, for all of the same reasons mentioned. I have used it in my music since the late 80s. I have practically an orchestra of sounds for the old beasts (I actually have 2, which I run in the alternating mode - doubling the polyphony). I have programmed (mostly from the front panel) many sounds for my EWI, that are focused on wood wind timbres, as well as sound FX. I used these with my other modules in a free form microtonal improv group until 95; now they serve as members of my &quot;electronic orchestra&quot;. I have programmed many nice emulations of Gamelan Orchestral Metalaphone instruments, also attempted an emulation of Partch&apos;s Cloud Chamber Bowls and have some very convincing Gongs too (not to mention some sounds that would bring to mind the Zoomoozaphone). It is remarkable that with just 4 operators, you can get some really great sounding metallic timbres. One important feature of the TX is that you can set it to play up to an 8 step/tone scale or a melodic passage as you just keep triggering one note (Alternate Mode in Performance). For instance you can set it up to alternate through the pitches of a justly tuned pentatonic scale, while also panning and alternating timbres. I also use the TX81Zs to create the Harmonic Drones that I use to underpin many of my JI pieces. I have tuned the TXs to the Harmonic Series and the Undertone Series to the 128th Partial/Undertones (front panel hell! It&apos;s a wonder I&apos;m not blind from these endeavors). Mostly, I will sequence the first 16 overtones and about the first 8 undertones - I then create a single sample of this in the key note of the composition, which can then be copied and transposed/superimposed to other just intervals - in the manner of multiple Tamboura strings. My goal has always been to create a sound that could serve a function in the music that is similar to the Tamboura in East Indian Classical music. I kind of accidentally discovered that I could make this sound when I first tuned the TXs to the overtone series back in the late 80s. I love to use these drones for practicing singing, as well as checking out tunings over them too (the primary scales that I favor for composing in JI - 13 Pitch Symmetrical JI - are derived from the overtone series - would like to discuss this in future post, if any would find this of interest). It&apos;s great to know that others are still enjoying this old piece. Yes, it is a little noisy too. I will frequently use audio plugins and my mixing board to eq the sound a bit - all worth it in the end. Also wanted to mention that I recently saw a TX81Z on <a href="http://roguemusic.com">roguemusic.com</a> for around $160.00, as well as a TX802 for $350.00. I just need to make music with the stuff I&apos;ve got, can&apos;t rationalize buying anything else now - but thought it might be of interest to someone that may need a budget module to work with JI.  Thanks for all the input on this! It has been most helpful. The tuning list rules!!!! Jacky</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get Yahoo!
