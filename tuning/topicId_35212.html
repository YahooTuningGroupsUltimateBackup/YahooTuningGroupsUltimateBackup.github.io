I haven&apos;t yet fully explored the harmonic resources of all the<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachords taken together. Before I splatter the page with all these<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios, I&apos;d like to ask first if anyone has expanded Partch&apos;s successful<br/>&gt; &gt; 11 limit system through 13,17 and 19, and used the system in actual<br/>&gt; &gt; melodic and harmonic music with acoustic instruments. Once I know this I<br/>&gt; &gt; can get on to my next questions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I notice in &quot;The Just Intonation Primer&quot; that the author is sceptical or<br/>&gt; &gt; unsure as to the efficacy of ratios involving 17 and 19. I interpret<br/>&gt; &gt; this as relating to harmonic music. I personally have no doubt as to<br/>&gt; &gt; their usefulness in melodic music. Again I&apos;d be interested to hear<br/>&gt; &gt; from/of musicians who have used the higher primes successfully in<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic situations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i saw Jacky&apos;s response to this (i think it was on the MMM list)<br/>&gt; and can pretty much agree with him.  i&apos;ve used primes up to 31,<br/>&gt; and even that 31-limit piece was really just an experiment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but i&apos;m a strong believer in 19.  i haven&apos;t done anything with<br/>&gt; it on acoustic instruments ... only on the computer.  but i<br/>&gt; generally use acoustic-like timbres, if that makes a difference.<br/>&gt; i really like the &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; that you get when you<br/>&gt; include 19 in a nice meaty chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; my piece _Theme from &quot;Invisible Haircut&quot;_ uses 19 and 13<br/>&gt; prominently in some of the chords:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haircut/haircut.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haircut/haircut.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you can view the javascript lattices for it at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haircut/haircutlattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/haircut/haircutlattices.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and there are also links on the main &quot;haircut&quot; page to some<br/>&gt; old tuning-list posts that describe the harmony in more detail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hope that helps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It helps indeed.
