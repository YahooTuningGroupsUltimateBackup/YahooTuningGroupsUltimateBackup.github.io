Do to the close fretting the idea of playing all the tetrads is not really<br/>feasable. To do that i think one could build a Surrogate Kithara using 9 strings or 9 sets of unison strings where the middle three strings were tuned<br/>to a 1-3-9 (two fifths, actually being 4-6-9). one set of the adjacent three strings are tuned to  the 5-7-11 while the other set treats the 4-6-9 as the<br/>subharmonic 9/6/4 and tunes it strings to a subharmonic 5 -7 -11. then the player plays only 6 strings at a time which will give him either a harmonic<br/>or subharmonic hexad. The only disadvantages of this is appegios will not be from low to high, but then again this might be an advantage and more<br/>interesting musically. If i were going to demand a guitar , i would be more interested in a subset of the eikosany because in my humble opinion, the<br/>eikosany is out of your basic guitar &quot;Language&quot; Still one has all types of tetrachordal scales that can be taken from this mother set to musical<br/>advantage. The Eikosany is good for instruments that can be played on a Bosanquet keyboard or keyboard lay out. The 22 1-3-7-9-11-15 eikosany<br/>scales does do some funny rthings on your convential keyboard. the fifth looks like a Minor ninth, but your M3 looks like a fifth and your 9/8 looks<br/>like a Major 3. something kinda Yassarian if one wanted to indulge in so &quot;evolutional &quot; speculation. the third becoming /in place of the fifth , the<br/>second becoming /in place of the third etc. Margo has already pointed out some problems with this:)</p></div><h3><a id=26659 href="#26659">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2001 1:54:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., kraiggrady@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi there!<br/>&gt; &#x9;Sorry to enter this so late in the game as i just got back on<br/>this list for a while.</p><p>Good to hear from you, Kraig.</p><p>&gt; Pete Mc Rae has a electric guitar that we came up with that uses the<br/>1-3-7-9-11-15 Eikosany fretting all 22 tones straight across.</p><p>How can an eikosany have 22 tones?

Why 1-3-7-9-11-15<br/>&gt; instead of 1-3-5-7-9-11?</p><p>The first to have a Constant structure requires 22 tones while the later<br/>requires 31. Although it was the later that i used the longest having<br/>made instruments in the full 1-3-5-7-9-11- CPS</p><p>&gt; &gt;If i were going to demand a guitar , i would<br/>&gt; be more interested in a subset of the eikosany because in my humble<br/>&gt; opinion, the<br/>&gt; &gt; eikosany is out of your basic guitar &quot;Language&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d like to understand more about this.</p><p>As each tetrad occurs only once in the Eikosany, and each tetrad is made<br/>of a different set of 6 elements. it is really hard to come up with a<br/>string and fretting pattern that makes it easy to play all of them. Now<br/>if one wants to use hexanies this makes it even harder, although it<br/>seems even harder. With the guitar it is a part of its language to<br/>transpose a given chord position up and down your fret board, which you<br/>can do, but then you will be using more the melodic properties of the<br/>constant structure and I would guess would wanted material to be<br/>repeated higher or lower which might lead you back to tetrachoral<br/>scales.<br/>    The very nature of the structural possibilities of the Eikosany is<br/>how each material , tetrad and hexanies has very defined places that<br/>they occur. After using this structure, one becomes quite familiar where<br/>one is in the structure by where each of these structures occur. It sets<br/>up a strong as structure as tonality, at least this was my final<br/>perception of it. You have other things such as those tetrachordal<br/>scales found as a fringe benefit will be mirrored on those tones<br/>farthest away from your original set of pitches. The inversion of<br/>something becomes tied in with the most dissonant.<br/>    Having a guitar, this was the only way we were able to us it without<br/>the complexity making it just to hard to play. Not trying to ruin your<br/>party , just don&apos;t want you to not put alot an effort into a guitar that<br/>might not pan out for you. Having  had almost a 50% failure of<br/>instruments to do what i wanted them to do (which i am sure Partch&apos;s<br/>record was about the same). It can cause one to turn away from making<br/>another attempt, which often means abandoning the entire path that lead<br/>to a particular design. Notice that Partch abandoned fretting the<br/>diamond after a certain point.<br/>    Anyway sometimes the answer to a problem might be useful for other<br/>reasons so proceed. Often in working in the Eikosany, the best solution<br/>are those that are self mirroring. I would look at tuning to a hexany<br/>maybe or the hexagon formed by the pattern ABC BCD CDE DEF EFA FAB where<br/>each letter could stand for each factor of 1-3-5-7-9-11.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=26720 href="#26720">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 11:17:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., kraiggrady@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi there!<br/>&gt; &gt; &#x9;Sorry to enter this so late in the game as i just got back on<br/>&gt; this list for a while.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good to hear from you, Kraig.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Pete Mc Rae has a electric guitar that we came up with that uses<br/>the<br/>&gt; 1-3-7-9-11-15 Eikosany fretting all 22 tones straight across.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How can an eikosany have 22 tones?

You&apos;ll find this at the bottom of<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/musinst.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/musinst.html</a>&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe I can design one without the close fretting. Why 1-3-7-9-11-<br/>15<br/>&gt; instead of 1-3-5-7-9-11?</p><p>I think this is mainly because 1-3-5-7-9-11 can&apos;t be embedded in a CS<br/>with a relatively small number of notes, such as 22.
