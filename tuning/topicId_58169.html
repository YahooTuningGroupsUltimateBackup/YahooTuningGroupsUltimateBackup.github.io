In the standard septimal meantone, the correct way<br/>to write 1-7/6-7/4 would be C-D#-A#, and 1-3/2-7/4 would be C-G-A#. In<br/>the meantone variant we&apos;ve called &quot;dominant&quot;, they would indeed be<br/>C-Eb-Bb and C-G-Bb, but that comes with not very accurate tuning.</p><p>However, in this system I&apos;m using C-G as the 36-equal approximation to<br/>1-7/4, not 1-3/2. Hence four &quot;fifths&quot; of size about 7/4 up, and two<br/>octaves down, is 2401/1024, which when you flatten it by 1024/1029,<br/>becomes 7/3. Hence you can map 1-5/4-3/2 to 1-7/3-7/4, but this takes<br/>us out of the range of an octave and won&apos;t work as a Scala-like<br/>notation system. However, four 7/4s and *three* octaves down give us<br/>an approximate 7/6 in 36-et, and so we can call this note &quot;E&quot;.</p><p>The notation as given sends consonances to consonances. Sometimes you<br/>might not like which octave you get, in which case you can adjust up<br/>or down an octave. But as it stands it will take 5-limit meantone<br/>music and make consonant but totally different music out of it. More<br/>complex chords are dicier. The interval C-Bb is sent to a 21/16, so<br/>C-E-G-Bb is approximately 1-7/6-21/16-7/4, which is pretty cool. C-A#<br/>however becomes rather disasterously an approximate 28/27.</p><p>&gt; I had myself prepared long ago a mapping of 35 Western tones, and<br/>it&apos;s in <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/mainpage/academic.html">http://www.ozanyarman.com/mainpage/academic.html</a>.
