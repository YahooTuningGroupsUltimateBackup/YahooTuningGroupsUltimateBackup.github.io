investigation into pitches and pitch intervals might be essential<br/>&gt; more for polyphonic/tonal musics or for melody-based<br/>monophonic/modal<br/>&gt; musics such as Turkish music?</p><p>both, though i believe that if the investigation is centered around<br/>the philosophy of using simple just ratios for the intervals between<br/>notes, it will tend to have a lot more relevance for polyphonic<br/>music, homophonic music, and monophonic music with a drone, and less<br/>relevance for monophonic music without a drone. this is because<br/>simultaneously sounding notes exhibit very clear, unique, well-<br/>documented, and well-understood effects when their frequency ratios<br/>are simple rational numbers, while judgments of melodic intervals<br/>seem to rely almost entirely on experience and training, and one<br/>finds an incredible diversity of &quot;correct&quot; melodic intervals when one<br/>surveys the cultures of the world.</p><p>however, i would certainly not extend this judgment to your<br/>tonal/modal dichotomy. if anything, the demise of modality and the<br/>ascent and development of tonality in western music made the purity<br/>of simple frequency ratios *less* important, as the &quot;panconsonant&quot;<br/>music of the renaissance and early baroque gave way to music with<br/>more &quot;directed&quot; progressions and, by the time of beethoven,<br/>enharmonic equivalence. let me know if you want this explained in<br/>more detail.</p></div><h3>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 7:03:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Could you explain this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Martin</p><p>according to margo schulter, 1670 is probably a good choice for a<br/>year in which western music became essentially &quot;tonal&quot; in the modern,<br/>western-music sense of the word. in tonal music, chromatic<br/>alterations (other than ornamental ones) have specific harmonic<br/>meanings and resolve in set patterns. more importantly, the single<br/>chromatic (that is, not perfect, major, or minor) interval in the<br/>unaltered diatonic scale, the tritone, resolved in contrary motion<br/>through diatonic semitones to members of a tonic-function triad<br/>separated by a major third. this created the functional cadence of<br/>tonal music that replaced the older, medieval-derived cadential<br/>formulae in which a major or minor interval would resolve in contrary<br/>motion through one diatonic semitone and one whole tone to a perfect<br/>interval. it is through the newer cadential pattern that the modern<br/>major and minor modes were established as the only two allowable<br/>choices. the diminished seventh chord (and the related harmonic minor<br/>mode), where three chromatic intervals (two tritones and a diminished<br/>seventh) each resolve by contrary stepwise motion to the tonic-<br/>function triad, was a hallmark of tonally-conceived music. diatonic<br/>modes other than major or minor were rendered archaic, since any of<br/>them would have its tritone sharing a pitch with the tonic triad,<br/>such that the occurence, and proper resolution, of the tritone would<br/>immediately contradict the &apos;tonality&apos; of the mode. the older modes<br/>did persist in theory (even in bach&apos;s key signatures) for some time,<br/>though, even after they fell out of use in practice.</p><p>why is this relevant for tuning? it seems somewhat possible that the<br/>shift from more consonant meantones such as 1/4-comma and 2/7-comma<br/>and 19-equal and 31-equal in the renaissance and early baroque, to<br/>1/5-comma and 1/6-comma meantones and 55-equal in the late baroque<br/>and classical periods, might have stemmed from a desire to make the<br/>cadential diatonic semitones more &quot;incisive&quot;, as margo puts it. as<br/>far as i know, this is pure speculation. but cadences do somehow<br/>seem &quot;stronger&quot; to many people when the motions involved are smaller;<br/>margo has used idea this to analyze medieval and neo-medieval<br/>progressions, while harry partch mentions it as a &quot;law&quot; surrounding<br/>microtonal progressions in just intonation.</p></div><h3>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2003 1:08:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
