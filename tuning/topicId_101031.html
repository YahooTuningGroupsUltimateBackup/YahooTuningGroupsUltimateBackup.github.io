This goal hasn&apos;t been realised yet because I haven&apos;t made sense of the available writing on the topic. What little I do understand hasn&apos;t yet allowed me to use these pitch structures with the tools I have available. I&apos;m hoping to get a discussion going about CPS tunings so that I can get some idea of how to apply them (and to ask some specific questions while at it).</p><p>Members of this list who have caught any of my previous posts might remember that I have very limited understanding of tuning theory and maths. Be aware that this is still the case. :)</p><p>--Working out the pitches--</p><p>I&apos;ve been able to create hexanies, dekanies and eikosanies using the Scala microtuning software. The result, however, is a set of pitches in ascending order - this reveals nothing about the structure of the set and which pitches are harmonious with which. Personally I don&apos;t understand how I will figure this out.</p><p>To gain some understanding I recently (started with an easy one) created a hexany in Scala and tried to map the pitches to a diagram of an octahedron. I copied the shape from diagrams I found online (e.g. this from wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hexanyfacets.gif">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hexanyfacets.gif</a> and some found at the Anaphorian Embassy) and tried to match the pitches from Scala with the diagram. I&apos;m unsure if I did this correctly because the diagrams I have found describe the vertices like &quot;3x7&quot; and &quot;1x5&quot; for example.</p><p>What is the method by which &quot;3x5&quot; and the rest are converted into cents or ratios? I need to convert to either cents or ratios to more easily understand the geometry of the pitches (by drawing diagrams which I can be certain are *correct*) and to retune my synths using Scala.</p><p>--Scala Options--</p><p>When creating a new CPS in Scala there are (at least) two options whose implications I don&apos;t fully understand. Those are &quot;delete 1/1 from result scale&quot; and &quot;normalize result by 2/1&quot;.</p><p>Is it absolutely necessary to delete the 1/1? How about if one simply avoids using 1/1, rather than delete it? My issue is that when you compare a scale where the 1/1 has been deleted with a scale where it hasn&apos;t, the other pitches change dramatically. Even the intervals between pitches are changing. What does it mean and why is this so?</p><p>Also, when you delete the 1/1 the resultant scale also has a 1/1, which is very confusing.</p><p>Is it absolutely necessary to normalise the result by 2/1? Personally I would like to map each pitch of the CPS to my keyboard once, with no octave equivalents. That is to say, for a hexany there will be only 6 pitches mapped, for an eikosany only 20. (My keyboard is an AXiS-49 from C-Thru Music, one of those hexagonal lattice MIDI controllers). In composition I would probably have every instrument use the same mapping but with certain instruments orchestrated to lower octaves (e.g. the bass 2 octaves lower). Am I right in thinking that normalising the result by 2/1 would be unhelpful in this case?</p><p>--Mapping to AXiS keyboard--</p><p>Last time I played around with the hexany, trying to understand it, I mapped the 6 notes to 6 keys on my keyboard. First I chose one hexagon-button, then I imagined the 6 hexagon-buttons around it were the vertices of the hexany&apos;s octahedron. I think this worked quite well (playing it for the first time was fun for a while), though I&apos;m still unsure if each pitch was mapped to the correct vertex.</p><p>Are there any projections of the larger dekany and eikosany shapes which will map well to the AXiS-49 (or similar hexagon-keyboard)?</p><p>--Existing music--</p><p>What are your favourite musical works composed with CPS tunings?</p><p>Thanks folks, I&apos;m interested to see how much fog can be removed from this topic! :)</p><p>Sean</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2011 11:10:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sevishmusic&quot; &lt;sevish@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been able to create hexanies, dekanies and eikosanies using the Scala microtuning software.

I know that was so simple, but this point has never been made clear to me before now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is it absolutely necessary to delete the 1/1?

My issue is that when you compare a scale where the 1/1 has been deleted with a scale where it hasn&apos;t, the other pitches change dramatically. Even the intervals between pitches are changing.

If you think they are, you&apos;re misunderstanding something.</p><p>I certainly was misunderstanding something... As you rightly said, Scala automatically transposes everything and this hurt my little mind while trying to find patterns in the madness.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is it absolutely necessary to normalise the result by 2/1? Personally I would like to map each pitch of the CPS to my keyboard once, with no octave equivalents. That is to say, for a hexany there will be only 6 pitches mapped, for an eikosany only 20.

But certainly you don&apos;t have to do that.</p><p>My first concern was not being able to fit more than one octave of a CPS onto my keyboard at any one time. The hexany at least is small enough that I can fit three of them on the AXiS-49 while keeping their ring shape. I&apos;ve decided to octave-reduce after all, but this wasn&apos;t an obvious good idea at first.</p><p>&gt; However, if you don&apos;t assume octave periodicity, then don&apos;t forget 2,4,etc. as possible factors for your CPSs! For example, you have the {2,3,4,5} hexany:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {2*3,2*4,2*5,3*4,3*5,4*5}<br/>&gt; {6/1,8/1,10/1,12/1,15/1,20/1}<br/>&gt; or transposed down by 6/1:<br/>&gt; {1/1,4/3,5/3,2/1,5/2,20/3}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or the {3,4,5,6,7} dekany:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {3*4,3*5,3*6,3*7,4*5,4*6,4*7,5*6,5*7,6*7}<br/>&gt; {12/1,15/1,18/1,21/1,20/1,24/1,28/1,30/1,35/1,42/1}<br/>&gt; or transposing down by 12/1 and also swapping the two out-of-order pitches:<br/>&gt; {1/1,5/4,3/2,5/3,7/4,2/1,7/3,5/2,35/12,7/2}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan</p><p>Thanks again for all the tips Keenan! The first breakthrough was understanding how to turn say 3x5 into a ratio (and to know to remove the 1/1) - yes I know it was simple, but since then I was able to draw a bunch of this little diagrams for myself and work out the pitches without Scala. 7-9-11-15 is sounding the slickest of all. My project this week is to compose a tune with it. After that I&apos;ll dip my toes into a dekany!</p><p>Should any other AXiS owners want to try my mapping I&apos;ve posted it below. Each dark blue (G#) key has 6 pitches around it. Try with any hexany.</p><p>Sean</p><p>! put 6 notes around dark blue keys on axis 49 or 64<br/>! Size of map:<br/>12<br/>!
