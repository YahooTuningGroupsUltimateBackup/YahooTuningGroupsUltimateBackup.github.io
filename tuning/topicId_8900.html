For me-no go!!<br/>&gt;<br/>I should point out that a 768 division of the octave is a characteristic of<br/>the TX-81Z, not of the MIDI standard. The MIDI standard leaves tuning<br/>resolution entirely up to the instrument itself (which, by the way, is<br/>1024/octave on the DX-7). I have sometimes successfully used JI on<br/>instruments with such resolution, but, of course, it all depends on the<br/>musical context, and I can imagine cases (e.g. Grady, Wolf, Young) where<br/>that resolution would not be sufficient.</p><p>If you&apos;re the adventurous sort, it is possible to use Csound with MIDI in<br/>real time. Frequencies are represented by floating point variables in<br/>Csound, which on most systems means that the difference between 20 hz and<br/>the next highest representable frequency is only about 0.00021 cents. By<br/>the way, details on how to do tunings and realtime performance with Csound<br/>are in the now newly available book/CD-ROM _Making Music with Csound_ (in<br/>which I have chapter on implementing tunings):<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262522616/qid%3D951766311/104-845011">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262522616/qid%3D951766311/104-845011</a><br/>5-1070838.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

I want to put together a portable synthesizer-based setup so<br/>&gt; that I can play with friends.   However, according to the Microtonal<br/>&gt; Synthesis website, there aren&apos;t any low-cost, commercially available<br/>&gt; hardware synths that have a scale resolution fine enough to handle JI.<br/>The<br/>&gt; site has virtually no information on any samplers that might have the<br/>&gt; necessary resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe these are some of the reasons all the responses I have received<br/>&gt; so far indicated that I&apos;d better get a laptop - because apparently none of<br/>&gt; the commercial products have the scale resolution and there isn&apos;t any<br/>&gt; solution for imposing JI on  a synth that does not involve the realtime<br/>use<br/>&gt; of a computer.</p><p>Just intonation can be done on synths with 1 cent resolution depending<br/>somewhat on the style of music you&apos;re attempting.  If you look at the<br/>recommended listening at my site many pieces in JI were accomplished with<br/>regular hardware synthesizers.  However, if you want long sustained chords<br/>with no perceptial beating then you&apos;re right, 1 cent would not be enough.</p><p>My site has no information on &quot;traditional&quot; samplers with better than 1 cent<br/>resolution because there aren&apos;t any.  Remember, to get better than 1 cent<br/>resolution for samplers or wavetable synths not only does the hardware have<br/>to be capable of it, you&apos;ll also need to tune each sample to better than 1<br/>cent accuracy.  Depending on the source, variation could be as great as 1<br/>cent over the length of a single sample.  Don&apos;t expect better resolution<br/>than that for commercially available samples, you&apos;ll have to roll your own,<br/>or find a DSP means to retune each sample consistently.</p><p>Cycling 74, CSound, Reaktor are software based synthsizers that can do the<br/>high resolution you&apos;re asking for and provide a challenging music synthesis<br/>environment, but one caveat is that polyphony can be limited.  I was able to<br/>run Reaktor on a Dell 300 MHz Pentium II laptop, but might have anywhere<br/>from 1 to 10 voices of polyphony available depending on the complexity of<br/>the instrument.  Unless you already own a laptop this doesn&apos;t meet the low<br/>cost criteria as you&apos;ll need an up to date machine in the 200-500 MHz range<br/>to pull it off.</p><p>I&apos;m curious what you meant by the comment &quot;there isn&apos;t any solution for<br/>imposing JI on a synth that does not involve the realtime use of a<br/>computer.&quot;  There are quite a few synths that can do JI.  If you were<br/>talking about better than 1 cent resolution as being a requirement, adding a<br/>computer into the mix won&apos;t improve the resolution of the 1 cent or worse<br/>instruments.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:microtonal@worldnet.att.net">microtonal@worldnet.att.net</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p></div><h3><a id=8946 href="#8946">ðŸ”—</a>pvallad1@tampabay.rr.com</h3><span>1/4/1999 2:17:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Just intonation can be done on synths with 1 cent resolution depending<br/>&gt;somewhat on the style of music you&apos;re attempting.

However, if you want long sustained chords<br/>&gt;with no perceptial beating then you&apos;re right, 1 cent would not be enough.</p><p>John,</p><p>Thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because the intervals<br/>between consecutive note degrees in your example JI scales include<br/>fractions of a cent to as much as four decimal places of precision.</p><p>If I am understanding you correctly, you are saying that depending on my<br/>musical goals, I can reasonably approximate JI using only whole cents.  For<br/>example, the first interval in your example 12-tone JI scale is 111.7313<br/>cents.  If I used a scale which approximated yours by starting with an<br/>interval of 112 cents, it might be close enough, depending on the desired<br/>application.</p><p>Is this correct?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=8963 href="#8963">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Perhaps this is old news or<br/>&gt;perhaps it really doesn&apos;t fit this thread. I just thought I&apos;d mention it in<br/>&gt;case it is helpful. The URL is &lt;<a href="http://www.justonic.com">http://www.justonic.com</a>&gt;</p><p>I bought the software in 97, after I saw its ad in Keyboard magazine.  I<br/>promptly went off to Barbershop &quot;Harmony College&quot;, and found that one of my<br/>profs was using the software in his theory class.  When I got back, I<br/>developed some scales with the software, and tweaked some of my midi files<br/>with root-change messages.  Unfortunately, using MIDI cables and a Proteus,<br/>most of the key changes took too long to be usable (they caused artifacts).<br/> I managed to get a few of the slower tunes working by carefully timing the<br/>messages, and by using a software synth.</p><p>I corresponded with Thomas Langley about the next version of the software,<br/>which unfortunately never appeared.  When the USB Roland boxes came out,<br/>Thomas wrote me to say that the root changes were groovy on them.  But by<br/>that time, I had decided that Kyma, CSound, and the built-in features of<br/>some synths better met my needs, and that the Justonic software was lost in<br/>Win16 land.</p><p>Final analysis: Pitch Palette was over-priced.  The chord-follower was<br/>over-hyped, and for my purposes, useless.  To its credit, it was the only<br/>thing available at the time which would re-tune synths from a PC, and with<br/>the exception of some expensive Kurzweil and late model Emu units, it is<br/>still the only way to get root changes out of the box.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
