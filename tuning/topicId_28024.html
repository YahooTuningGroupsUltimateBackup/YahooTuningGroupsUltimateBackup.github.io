You might also expect<br/>that scales designed from the partials of inharmonic timbres wouldn&apos;t sound<br/>as good as JI or near-JI scales for harmonic timbres. But if the timbres<br/>you start with are inherently dissonant, the same scales might sound better<br/>with more consonant timbres.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=28035 href="#28035">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2001 10:41:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; Ok... just to elaborate further...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s say Sethares were to come along and say &quot;Well, I&apos;ve got an<br/>&gt; interesting idea to create some new scales...
