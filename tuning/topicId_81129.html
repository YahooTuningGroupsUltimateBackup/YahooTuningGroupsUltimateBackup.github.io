We already live in the Idiocracy.  In times bygone, people had, at least, pianos in their parlors, and Wagner was capable of causing controversy.  No understanding without participation.

Everyone has her will to power, his self-<br/>&gt; interest, that colors perception and judgment.  The people in the<br/>&gt; commercial world were &apos;stodgier&apos;.</p><p>Yes, my intended target for the &quot;stodgy&quot; accusation was vague, but I<br/>will not hone it because it&apos;s something I shouldn&apos;t have said anyway =)</p><p>&gt; -I think that the typical American simply has little interest in music<br/>&gt; other than socializing and sentiment, little ability to pay attention,<br/>&gt; and has so little knowledge that they actually have fun playing air-<br/>&gt; guitar video games.  We already live in the Idiocracy.  In times<br/>&gt; bygone, people had, at least, pianos in their parlors, and Wagner was<br/>&gt; capable of causing controversy.  No understanding without<br/>&gt; participation.  Music is not a spectator sport.</p><p>THIS is what I&apos;m getting at!  Especially since I consider myself to be<br/>in the &quot;idiot&quot; group when compared to the amount of brain-power here.</p><p>I&apos;m not prepared to layout judgement on the composer-to-common-joe<br/>gap, but I feel like common-joe has been, and continues to be, thrown<br/>to the curb and disregarded when it comes to &apos;serious&apos; composition,<br/>and I suspect the next major composer in history will sound good to<br/>both academics *and* common-joes.  Maybe not for the same reasons, but<br/>genius to both types none-the-less.  Of course, I may be way off or<br/>maybe it already happened and I&apos;m unaware, but that&apos;s how I feel.</p><p>One exciting thing about this, to me anyway, is that there is now a<br/>huge opportunity to edify common-joe aurally, if it is decided they<br/>are worth the effort, and my question is... &quot;how can microtonality<br/>contribute to this effort?&quot;.  My current answer is &quot;Through free<br/>microtonality and &apos;synthesis&apos; instead of what I consider &apos;traditional,<br/>rule-based composition&apos; that just sounds out of tune.&quot;</p><p>I mean, if you&apos;re gonna go the microtonal route and concede the fact<br/>that common-joe won&apos;t understand it, why not go farther and just go<br/>waaaay off the deep end when it comes to originality in the hopes that<br/>common-joe will like it despite not being able to understand it?  Why<br/>lock yourself into a specific &quot;out-of&quot; tuning for a piece at all?</p><p>---</p><p>...so, anyway, I&apos;m not sure if my point is coming through clearly as<br/>my communication skills are somewhat lacking (I blame the 10 years of<br/>writing code for that :)... but that&apos;s where I&apos;m at right now as far<br/>as I can tell.</p><p>Consider this an opportunity to edify *this* common-joe, I guess,<br/>because I just don&apos;t understand why a lot of microtonal music sounds<br/>horrible to me, or why anybody would have written it with the<br/>knowledge that the majority of people on the planet will think it<br/>sounds horrible, too.

I choose to respond in general--not line by line.  I speak for myself.<br/>I&apos;m going for relative pith, and there&apos;s no particular order here.</p><p>-Don&apos;t be embarrassed.  Also, you&apos;re far from the average Joe.</p><p>-I like to joke that I&apos;m &apos;elitist&apos; because the shoe fits in one way:  music.</p><p>-I&apos;m an elitist only because I&apos;m interested in music that I think is well-made, well-conceived,<br/>well-heard, and because I wish to learn from my betters.  I&apos;m less interested in music that<br/>seems shoddy or brutish or imitative.  I&apos;m less interested in teaching others, except in the<br/>rare cases when they want to learn from me.  I&apos;m not interested in general outreach.</p><p>-There&apos;s amazing things to be heard in almost all styles of music, with the possible<br/>exception of:  disco.  The Sex Pistols.</p><p>-I can&apos;t afford to be too exclusive in my tastes, nor do I want to be.  I&apos;m far from the most<br/>talented musician in the world.  Heck, I&apos;m not even the most talented musician on my block,<br/>probably.  (There&apos;s a guy who I hear whistling from time to time...damn.)</p><p>-The &apos;elitism&apos; that we should perhaps condemn is economic, or racial, or concerned<br/>with status.  That&apos;s the kind of elitism that says that rich people deserve to be rich because<br/>they&apos;re better, and they should rule, and we should admire them, for instance.<br/>There are other kinds of elitism, too, that I don&apos;t believe in.</p><p>-I&apos;m an elitist in the sense that I&apos;d rather listen to Coltrane than Kenny G., even though<br/>Kenny G.  probably sells more records.</p><p>-I completely reject &quot;lifestyle&quot; elitism--the kind of thing you see in advertisements, in which<br/>wealth is associated with expensive consumption, which is associated with a fine palate or<br/>a good eye for expensive duds.  Wine-tasting elitism. Country-club elitism.</p><p>-I did lowly science-documentary scoring for a living in the 90&apos;s.  It was mainly a marathon<br/>making the best music I could as quickly as possible with synthesizers, because<br/>there wasn&apos;t time or budget for live players.  It was mainly about trying to please producers.<br/>It was an exercise in alienation, because I couldn&apos;t really use my own ears or my own taste.<br/>I learned, by trial-and-error, what &quot;worked.&quot;   Within that, I often had a lot of fun, but I almost<br/>never wrote something I thought had lasting value.  Some of it was funny, some of it worked.</p><p>-Film/TV production is hierarchical.  Exec producer on top, producer, host, editor, production<br/>assistant.  Composer is not even part of hierarchy.  No power whatsoever.  Composer is at<br/>end of production cycle, which means things are always insanely rushed.</p><p>-A musically ignorant man like executive producer John Angier could smirk about a major figure<br/>in my estimation: Wendy Carlos.  He could smirk because he didn&apos;t have a clue what she has<br/>accomplished.  And, because he felt accustomed to being in charge.  He could afford to &quot;hire<br/>the best&quot;, without having a truly informed opinion about what that meant.  He and others like<br/>him are examples of elitism as arrogance, of vanity from power.</p><p>-The TV world didn&apos;t respect the teachers at Berklee or NEC, and the music world didn&apos;t respect<br/>the TV world.</p><p>-I respond viscerally:  Music sounds good or it doesn&apos;t.  It takes a while to learn to hear<br/>microtones like it does anything else.   Once you hear whatever it is you hear, you can&apos;t really<br/>go back to the way you heard before.  You can&apos;t renounce your own tastes.  Or, to do so<br/>is an exercise in ascetic self-overcoming, like sleeping on a bed of nails.</p><p>-Most people&apos;s taste for new musical experience shuts down around age 30, which is<br/>the end of our protracted adolescence.  I think it requires training and effort to stay open<br/>to new things.</p><p>-There are maybe a dozen people here who I&apos;m already sure know a lot more than me<br/>about tuning, and I want to learn from them.</p><p>-My experience is mostly with hands-on extended JI.</p><p>-Jargon:  It may seem elitist, but jargon is often necessary short-hand, tech-talk that would<br/>be laborious to state in other ways.   Sometimes used to puff things up, but not necessarily.</p><p>-So, here:  once I understand what a 3-d tuning is, what Orwell, or magic, or any of these<br/>other terms that seem so mysterious, I will have learned what I came here to learn. Also,<br/>there&apos;s basic understanding, but then there&apos;s a deeper understanding that comes from<br/>using these scales, these concepts.  Applying them.</p><p>-I try to compose what sounds good to me, but that includes what is challenging, new and<br/>therefore exciting.  New tunings are new flavors, but they are also new structural situations.</p><p>-I&apos;ve got decent relative pitch, and very weak absolute pitch, so already, I&apos;d probably fail<br/>the entrance exam at Juilliard.

We already live in the Idiocracy. In times<br/>&gt; &gt; bygone, people had, at least, pianos in their parlors, and Wagner &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; capable of causing controversy. No understanding without<br/>&gt; &gt; participation. Music is not a spectator sport.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THIS is what I&apos;m getting at! Especially since I consider myself to be<br/>&gt; in the &quot;idiot&quot; group when compared to the amount of brain-power here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not prepared to layout judgement on the composer-to-common-joe<br/>&gt; gap, but I feel like common-joe has been, and continues to be, thrown<br/>&gt; to the curb and disregarded when it comes to &apos;serious&apos; composition,<br/>&gt; and I suspect the next major composer in history will sound good to<br/>&gt; both academics *and* common-joes. Maybe not for the same reasons, but<br/>&gt; genius to both types none-the-less. Of course, I may be way off or<br/>&gt; maybe it already happened and I&apos;m unaware, but that&apos;s how I feel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One exciting thing about this, to me anyway, is that there is now a<br/>&gt; huge opportunity to edify common-joe aurally, if it is decided they<br/>&gt; are worth the effort, and my question is... &quot;how can microtonality<br/>&gt; contribute to this effort?&quot;. My current answer is &quot;Through free<br/>&gt; microtonality and &apos;synthesis&apos; instead of what I consider &apos;traditional,<br/>&gt; rule-based composition&apos; that just sounds out of tune.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean, if you&apos;re gonna go the microtonal route and concede the fact<br/>&gt; that common-joe won&apos;t understand it, why not go farther and just go<br/>&gt; waaaay off the deep end when it comes to originality in the hopes that<br/>&gt; common-joe will like it despite not being able to understand it?

To my common-joe ears, it simply sounded out of<br/>&gt;&gt; tune, like a mistake had been made that, for some reason, made it all<br/>&gt;&gt; the way into the production version.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; -I think it&apos;s actually a real insult, and simply incorrect, to call<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; academics &apos;stodgy&apos;--even &apos;seemingly&apos;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My apologies to the non-stodgy academics, then :( in my defense,<br/>&gt;&gt; though, I did preface the post with (rephrasing. ..) &quot;I&apos;m not very<br/>&gt;&gt; smart, which is why I don&apos;t usually post here&quot;. :)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; They weren&apos;t stodgy at NEC, or<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Berklee, or Penn State. Everyone has her will to power, his self-<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; interest, that colors perception and judgment. The people in the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; commercial world were &apos;stodgier&apos;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, my intended target for the &quot;stodgy&quot; accusation was vague, but I<br/>&gt;&gt; will not hone it because it&apos;s something I shouldn&apos;t have said &gt;&gt; anyway =)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; -I think that the typical American simply has little interest in &gt;&gt; music<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; other than socializing and sentiment, little ability to pay &gt;&gt; attention,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; and has so little knowledge that they actually have fun playing &gt;&gt; air-<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; guitar video games. We already live in the Idiocracy. In times<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; bygone, people had, at least, pianos in their parlors, and Wagner &gt;&gt; was<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; capable of causing controversy. No understanding without<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; participation. Music is not a spectator sport.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; THIS is what I&apos;m getting at! Especially since I consider myself to be<br/>&gt;&gt; in the &quot;idiot&quot; group when compared to the amount of brain-power here.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m not prepared to layout judgement on the composer-to- common-joe<br/>&gt;&gt; gap, but I feel like common-joe has been, and continues to be, thrown<br/>&gt;&gt; to the curb and disregarded when it comes to &apos;serious&apos; composition,<br/>&gt;&gt; and I suspect the next major composer in history will sound good to<br/>&gt;&gt; both academics *and* common-joes. Maybe not for the same reasons, but<br/>&gt;&gt; genius to both types none-the-less. Of course, I may be way off or<br/>&gt;&gt; maybe it already happened and I&apos;m unaware, but that&apos;s how I feel.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One exciting thing about this, to me anyway, is that there is now a<br/>&gt;&gt; huge opportunity to edify common-joe aurally, if it is decided they<br/>&gt;&gt; are worth the effort, and my question is... &quot;how can microtonality<br/>&gt;&gt; contribute to this effort?&quot;. My current answer is &quot;Through free<br/>&gt;&gt; microtonality and &apos;synthesis&apos; instead of what I consider &gt;&gt; &apos;traditional,<br/>&gt;&gt; rule-based composition&apos; that just sounds out of tune.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I mean, if you&apos;re gonna go the microtonal route and concede the fact<br/>&gt;&gt; that common-joe won&apos;t understand it, why not go farther and just go<br/>&gt;&gt; waaaay off the deep end when it comes to originality in the hopes &gt;&gt; that<br/>&gt;&gt; common-joe will like it despite not being able to understand it? Why<br/>&gt;&gt; lock yourself into a specific &quot;out-of&quot; tuning for a piece at all?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ---<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ...so, anyway, I&apos;m not sure if my point is coming through clearly as<br/>&gt;&gt; my communication skills are somewhat lacking (I blame the 10 years of<br/>&gt;&gt; writing code for that :)... but that&apos;s where I&apos;m at right now as far<br/>&gt;&gt; as I can tell.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Consider this an opportunity to edify *this* common-joe, I guess,<br/>&gt;&gt; because I just don&apos;t understand why a lot of microtonal music sounds<br/>&gt;&gt; horrible to me, or why anybody would have written it with the<br/>&gt;&gt; knowledge that the majority of people on the planet will think it<br/>&gt;&gt; sounds horrible, too. I mean, you guys aren&apos;t stupid, that&apos;s for<br/>&gt;&gt; sure. You could all write music for common-joe pretty easily, but you<br/>&gt;&gt; choose not to. To me, that comes across as selfish (which must be an<br/>&gt;&gt; incorrect suspicion, right? ....because you all here don&apos;t seem like<br/>&gt;&gt; the selfish types to me).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ---<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt;&gt; ~af~<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; p.s.

So we call meantone a &quot;rank 2&quot; temperament [class] because it has 2 dimensions. The octave and the fourth are referred to as the &quot;generators&quot; of meantone. It&apos;s &quot;regular&quot; because it has a consistent &quot;mapping&quot; of approximations to JI -- a major third for instance is always two octaves up, four fourths down.

But actually, I later added three more tones to the original version, which resulted in 36 tones. The problem was that no matter if there were 33 or 36 tones, I didn&apos;t find an easy way to realize this in actual music, which I still hope will change some day.</p><p>Anyway, if you are interested, here&apos;s how I made the scale.</p><p>Suppose we have a frequency of F. If we add a frequency of F/2 to that, the F can work not only as a proper frequency of F but also as the second harmonic of F/2. If we add F/3 and 2F/3 to that, then the 2F/3 works as the second harmonic of F/3 and the F works as the third harmonic of F/3. Then, if we add F/4 and 3F/4 to that, the F/2, 3F/4, and F can work as the second, third, and fourth harmonic of F/4, respectively. And so on and so on, until you get to the point where you add frequencies as low as F/15. So you see, you eventually get a subharmonic scale from F/1 to F/15 filled with the corresponding harmonics for each subharmonic up to the F. All the frequencies used are lower than or equal to F and this F has many possible meanings here ranging from the second harmonic of F/2 (or even the first harmonic of F, for that matter) to the 15th harmonic of F/15. If you then reduce this into a single octave (i.e. keep multipliing them by 2 until they are greater than F but not greater than 2F), you get a 33-tone scale. And if, instead of using F/15 as the lowest subharmonic, you use F/16 and do the same, you get a 36-tone scale, which is what I did there back in 2003.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=81264 href="#81264">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2009 7:37:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hmm.

But<br/>&gt; actually, I later added three more tones to the original version,<br/>&gt; which resulted in 36 tones. The problem was that no matter if there<br/>&gt; were 33 or 36 tones, I didn&rsquo;t find an easy way to realize this in<br/>&gt; actual music, which I still hope will change some day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, if you are interested, here&rsquo;s how I made the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suppose we have a frequency of F. If we add a frequency of F/2 to<br/>&gt; that, the F can work not only as a proper frequency of F but also as<br/>&gt; the second harmonic of F/2. If we add F/3 and 2F/3 to that, then the<br/>&gt; 2F/3 works as the second harmonic of F/3 and the F works as the<br/>&gt; third harmonic of F/3. Then, if we add F/4 and 3F/4 to that, the F/<br/>&gt; 2, 3F/4, and F can work as the second, third, and fourth harmonic of<br/>&gt; F/4, respectively. And so on and so on, until you get to the point<br/>&gt; where you add frequencies as low as F/15. So you see, you eventually<br/>&gt; get a subharmonic scale from F/1 to F/15 filled with the<br/>&gt; corresponding harmonics for each subharmonic up to the F. All the<br/>&gt; frequencies used are lower than or equal to F and this F has many<br/>&gt; possible meanings here ranging from the second harmonic of F/2 (or<br/>&gt; even the first harmonic of F, for that matter) to the 15th harmonic<br/>&gt; of F/15. If you then reduce this into a single octave (i.e. keep<br/>&gt; multipliing them by 2 until they are greater than F but not greater<br/>&gt; than 2F), you get a 33-tone scale. And if, instead of using F/15 as<br/>&gt; the lowest subharmonic, you use F/16 and do the same, you get a 36-<br/>&gt; tone scale, which is what I did there back in 2003.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=81265 href="#81265">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2009 8:10:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Caleb wrote:</p><p>&gt; hmm.

With so many theorists and composers<br/>(myself included) working in tonality-diamond scales, I never inclined<br/>myself to use scales like this one, created by adding overtone series on<br/>each note of the overtone series. I feel that this method of scale<br/>generation will give me lots of new tonal resources to work in. (Besides<br/>this, I am not really familiar with 13-limit tunings.

Yet it also is designed<br/>&gt; to meet the consonance standards of the 12TET-accustomed ear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Other examples that don&apos;t sound a lot like 12TET seem hard to<br/>&gt; find.  Even most of Wilson&apos;s MOS scales (like the one in the 2nd link)<br/>&gt; and Lucy Tuning are often just a trivial amount of cents away from<br/>&gt; either 12TET or Just Intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Let me know how it works.  I&apos;m happy to see someone here beside<br/>&gt; me is very interested in finding a non-JI-like/&quot;in your face&quot; scale<br/>&gt; system that works well enough for the public ear to make them think<br/>&gt; &quot;hey, that&apos;s different but seriously cool and confident sounding, I<br/>&gt; want to try that!&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   And, by all means (if you are willing to dive in to creating your<br/>&gt; own scale), I encourage you to experiment with the path less taken to<br/>&gt; create scales IE using irrational numbers as generators to &quot;normal&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning method.  Once you find a gem of an irrational generator like<br/>&gt; PHI...you&apos;ll likely find many cool intervals to play with to make<br/>&gt; scales from...maybe you can find a scale under PHI which beats mine so<br/>&gt; far and persuades more people to &quot;go micro-tonal&quot;...who knows. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --I&apos;m sure the answer is in here somewhere and I&apos;m simply missing<br/>&gt; &gt; --it. Of course, it may be another 10 years before my brain is ready<br/>&gt; &gt; --for the answer, but I&apos;ll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br/>&gt; &gt;     The fact there are so many cool symmetrical patterns in math<br/>&gt; based on things like irrational ratios (I&apos;ve been experimenting with<br/>&gt; PHI, and Charles Lucy with PI) seem to say the Lord has left us clues<br/>&gt; in math.<br/>&gt; &gt;    So does the fact that much of the world&apos;s best architecture AND<br/>&gt; what&apos;s viewed as physically attractive far as human proportions is<br/>&gt; based on PHI.<br/>&gt; &gt;     This has gotten me back into hard-core efforts trying to create<br/>&gt; tunings.  For the longest time I was stuck on simply mixing up JI<br/>&gt; scales thinking that&apos;s as &quot;rebellious&quot; as I could get while pleasing<br/>&gt; the &quot;Average Joe&quot;.  Of course, the &quot;classic&quot; ratios of 2 and 3/2 come<br/>&gt; across as very natural in music and other calculations...but, to be<br/>&gt; sure, those are not the only basis or near-basis for beautiful &gt; scales. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -michael<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@...</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=81547 href="#81547">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2009 6:29:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you come up with any new scales let us know, for I think that I<br/>&gt; have already covered all the possible 12edo scales at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/scales/">http://www.lucytune.com/scales/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; although there are thousands of (less ambiguous) others which can be<br/>&gt; generated by alternative spellings, which are unique and playable in<br/>&gt; meantone tunings.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Question: Why is this list restricted to 12 tones?
