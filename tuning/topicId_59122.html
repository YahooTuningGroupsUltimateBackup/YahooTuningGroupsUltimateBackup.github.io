(But I think Ozan needs more than 19<br/>  &gt; pitches/octave.)</p><p>  The whole generator question is murky. The MOS in question has a<br/>  generator of 2deg159, but he wants to use it for both 92deg159 and<br/>  93deg159 as nearly as I can tell. How that works is unclear.</p><p>  &gt; &gt; If you are<br/>  &gt; &gt; going to take a multiple of a meantone system, the claims of 152 and<br/>  &gt; &gt; 171 should be considered,<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Yes, and as I pointed out, I don&apos;t expect that 19 pitches +<br/>  &gt; flexibility will be enough.  Hmmm, now that I&apos;ve said that, what<br/>  &gt; about two circles of 19?  38-ET would use the same Tartini<br/>  &gt; accidentals as 31-ET.

What would a list of<br/>  ideally tuned maqams be? If we had that, we could began to optimize.</p><p>  &gt; But those are alterations to a chain of nominals generated by the<br/>  &gt; best fifth of 159.  I think Ozan may want a notation that uses<br/>  &gt; nominals generated by a 159-meantone fifth (one degree smaller),<br/>  &gt; which would be something quite different.  Gene, have you considered<br/>  &gt; looking at this as a chain of semi-159-meantone-fifths (46deg159)?</p><p>  Hey, we induct injera, godzilla/semaphore or semififhts into the maqam<br/>  business! No, I didn&apos;t consider it; I&apos;m not clear on what the target<br/>  really is.</p><p>  You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  Yahoo!

Each maqam could have its own characteristic combination<br/>of micro-arrows.  (I don&apos;t know how well this would work, with only 7<br/>staff-position-classes available, but it may be worth a thought.)</p><p>--George</p></div>
