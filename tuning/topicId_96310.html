You<br/>could hypothetically pick any dyads you want and just optimize it<br/>around that.</p><p>&gt; B) What&apos;s the generator for 1/3rd comma meantone (in cents)?</p><p>It&apos;s pretty much identical to 19-tet&apos;s fourth (or fifth), but let&apos;s<br/>work it out. So for 1/3-comma meantone, three fourths should put you<br/>at an exact 6/5 (octave-equivalent), just like in how 1/4 comma<br/>meantone, four fifths puts you at an exact 5/4 (octave-equivalent).<br/>Think about this for a second if it doesn&apos;t make immediate sense. But<br/>mathematically, the derivation of the generator is simple:</p><p>1) Start with 6/5 * 2/1, or 12/5.<br/>2) You know that three generators will get you to 12/5, meaning that g^3 = 12/5.<br/>3) Therefore, g = (12/5)^(1/3).<br/>4) So what is g in cents? cents(g) = 1200*log(g)/log(2) =<br/>1200*log((12/5)^(1/3))/log(2)<br/>5) Since log(x^y) = y * log(x), the 1/3 comes outside of the log and<br/>you get 1/3 * 1200 * log(12/5)/log(2)<br/>6) This equals 505.214 cents. In comparison, 19-equal&apos;s fourth is<br/>505.263 cents.

So now the question remains how much we really care about the proper sound of the original 5-limit chords, considering the fact that standard staff notation is 2D and doesn&apos;t offer secondary accidentals which would be independent of sharps/flats. If something like a 3D notation existed, then the written comma pump would indeed finish with a different chord than it started -- I mean something like this:<br/>C-E&lt;-G, C-E&lt;-A&lt;, D&lt;-F-A&lt;, B&lt;&lt;-D&lt;-G&lt;, C&lt;-E&lt;&lt;-G&lt;</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2011 1:59:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Obviously, 5-limit JI is a 3D system and so is Vicentino&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s system is just an arrangement of 1/4-comma meantone, so it&apos;s 2D.</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2011 4:09:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; Vicentino&apos;s system is just an arrangement of 1/4-comma meantone, so it&apos;s &gt; 2D.</p><p>Meantone tempering is 2D because it only tempers out one interval within the 3D system called &quot;5-limit JI&quot;.

My stomping grounds are South Carolina, Georgia and Europe. Some people confuse me with the Gregg Gibson who is a rock singer. We are of about the same age, but I have never met him.</p><p>I am very pleased that the responses here have been of assistance to you. The best references to temperament are usually in Latin, Italian, French or German, and not everyone has time to acquire so many languages. Even I do not yet read German just for pleasure. English was only a minor language in this subject until the 20th century. Zarlino is however slowly being translated into English, and I believe someone has done Salinas as well, although I have not seen it; my Latin is good enough to use the original. Mersenne was translated long ago, but I have never seen it; I do have the original however, which makes fascinating reading.</p><p>I should not have said that Nenna and the Neapolitans used the 19-tone equal; they used the 1/3 comma meantone, which is aurally identical to the 19-tone equal; the divergence in the intervals is on the order of  a cent. Any good musical theorist will have calculated and studied this somewhere in his notes. It is as easy as multiplying fractions and converting their product to logarithms and then to cents or to savarts.</p><p>As you are probably aware, in the cycle of fifths, the major sixth is three fifths above the prime or beginning tone, and the major third is four fifths above the prime. The minor third is three fifths below the prime, and the minor sixth is four fifths below the prime. Therefore the most obvious way to redistribute the comma is to diminish the fifth by 1/3 comma or 1/4 comma, and these are the systems that were first invented and used. No one knows who actually invented these tunings; we only know who first described them. Salinas states that he was the inventor of the 1/3 comma meantone, but Zarlino assures us that it was in use before Salinas, and Salinas gracefully conceded that this was probably the case, in a famous passage of his de Musica.</p><p>A fifth augmented even slightly will exacerbate the comma, resulting in thirds and sixths still worse than in Pythagorean Intonation.</p><p>It is now generally admitted that the Neapolitan School employed 1/3 comma meantone in preference to the 1/4 comma meantone. The kingdom was full of 19-tone keyboards at a time when 12- or 13-tone keyboards were the rule elsewhere. This is a commonplace of historical musicology. A few of them are still on display in Naples museums.</p><p>It is sometimes asserted, after Ellis as I recall, that 19-tone keyboards could just as easily have been tuned in 1/4 comma meantone. This would however have reintroduced the wolf. Moreover, there is no particular reason to select 19 of the 31 slightly unequal degrees of the 1/4 meantone.  17 or 26 are much more logical selections for Baroque music.</p><p>I am always puzzled when theorists treat 1/3 comma meantone as an oddity , and question whether it was ever used. I have read and translated Costeley&apos;s preface, and Mersenne&apos;s references to Titelouze. There is no doubt that 1/3 comma meantone was in current use, at least in France and Italy. Zarlino assures us that both were in common use at Rome and in Italy in general.</p><p>I believe Costeley was mentioned by another correspondent.</p><p>As will shortly be seen, Guillaume Costeley (pronounce: coat-lay) expressly states that he used an octave divided into equal 1/3 tones, and also expressly refers to 19 pitches in the octave, in a preface of 1570, a year before Salinas mathematically defined the 1/3 comma mesotonic, which is aurally absolutely identical to the 19-tone equal. Probably this tuning was &apos;in the air&apos;, and both men independently discovered slightly different ways of defining the same system. Costeley finds the 19-tone equal far superior to any other tuning.</p><p>The relevant passage is printed in Les Ma&icirc;tres Musiciens de la Renaissance Fran&ccedil;aise, and precedes Costeley&apos;s celebrated chromatic motet &quot;Seigneur Dieu Ta piti&eacute;&quot;. I give my translation, posted on this list circa 1998:</p><p>[After a greeting to his friends, and a general praise of music, there follows:]</p><p>&quot;Now I do not doubt that you gentlemen find it strange that I should have exceeded in certain of my compositions the usual limits of the tones [i.e. the diatonics plus C#, Eb, F#, G# or Ab, &amp; Bb - he implies that he has used Db, D#, E#, Fb, Gb,A#, B# &amp; Cb in some of his compositions, which exceed the usual limits of the pythagorean tuning hitherto prevailing] of which usual limits I am not ignorant.</p><p>&quot;I reply to these possible criticisms, first, that I have wished to provide the most excellent choristers of our Most Christian, Magnanimous and most Royally Born King of FRANCE (whom may God long preserve among us) with all that which might most please our Master. But I have done this [i.e. added these new tones to music] without ever going out of the key [this phrase admits of differing interpretations, but probably means that by the use of 1/3 tones he can more exactly preserve the mode when it has been modulated to a new key], and withal so that I might render our music more airy [he probably means, more harmonious, or perhaps less polyphonic and more dramatic, or else more freely modulated].</p><p>&quot;As for the song that follows, I composed it 12 long years ago as an experiment, to render more practical an idea that I had, which I hoped should give a sweeter and more agreeable music than the diatonic, provided it were well and skillfully handled. This new music has its voices separated by intervals of one-third tone [instead of by unequal fractions of a tone, or else by more or less equal semitones]. And this [possibility] points up how far from perfection are the designs of our organs and spinets, inasmuch as they have but 7 diatonics and 5 accidentals in the octave, whereas perfection requires not 5, but 12 accidentals, which a good workman [with a skilful] design can introduce into the keyboard without making it unplayably complex. And when by these equal 1/3 tones we dispose the diatonics and accidentals in their natural order, we possess a marvelously new and pleasing instrument, without which the song which I have composed for it cannot be played.</p><p>&quot;By using this 19-tone instrument tuned by 1/3 tones, we can always modulate [d&eacute;tonner] without discord [for the requisite accidental is always present, just as it is on the 12-tone keyboards, but with far less sweetness in the harmony, and the requisite accidental is by no means available in the 1/4 comma mesotonic, unless it be carried to an unmanageable 31 tones in the octave]. For we can always lower or raise a note by 1/3 or 2/3 of a tone as needed [to fit the new key].</p><p>&quot;There is no further need to speak of semitones, for in this tuning there are none [he means, the chromatic and diatonic semitones are no longer equal, the former being but half the width of the latter]. Our lutes as usually tuned suffer from the same imperfection as our keyboard instruments, although by its natural sweetness even the most delicate ears rarely find anything amiss with it. [He means perhaps that good players adjust the unequal semitones of the mesotonic as needed, it being remembered that the lute&apos;s tones are not prolonged, which tends to mask bad harmony - or perhaps he even means that lute-players used an approximation of 12-tone equal temperament, though this is very doubtful.] Therefore the perfect music such as I have suggested has not been more practiced on the lute than on organs or spinets [despite the lute&apos;s movable frets], for it imperatively requires the use of all the 1/3 tones. Well-played violins have the advantage over the above-mentioned instruments in this regard, inasmuch as they can be played justly without the division of the octave into any particular intervals.</p><p>&quot;Now the true difference between flats and sharps, between flats and naturals, or between sharps and naturals, is 1/3 tone. For example, between Bb and B is 1/3 tone, and between Eb and E is 1/3 tone again. But on the other hand between F# and G is 2/3 tone. I have marked this distinction whenever necessary for the sake of clarity. For most musicians and singers have hitherto confounded sharps and flats. But only when a G for example is twice flatted, is it the same as F#.</p><p>&quot;As for all other information regarding this matter, I leave it sirs, to your most reliable and equitable judgement, which will permit you to benefit from my labors, both now and in the future. And in this spirit I pray God that He may keep you ever in His peace.<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Paris, 1 January 1570</p><p>[End of Costeley&apos;s Preface]</p><p>Gregg Gibson</p></div><h3>gregggibson &#x3C;gregggibson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2011 7:24:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am replying to my own post, to clarify and elaborate upon something I said.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am always puzzled when theorists treat 1/3 comma meantone as an oddity , and question whether it was ever used. I have read and translated Costeley&apos;s preface, and Mersenne&apos;s references to Titelouze. There is no doubt that 1/3 comma meantone was in current use, at least in France and Italy.

Anyone dissatisfied with the thirds and/or sixths of this system, would immediately look at the cycle of fifths. He would first find the major sixth three fifths above the prime, e.g.</p><p>D-A-E-B</p><p>He would note that the Pythagorean Major Sixth is sharper or wider than the 5/3 major sixth.</p><p>And he would then multiply 3/2 three times in succession to get 27/8, or within the reference octave 27/16. But he wants 5/3, the consonant major third. He would then take the difference of 27/16 and 5/3, i.e. he would divide 27/16 by 5/3, or multiply 27/16 by 3/5, yielding 81/80, the comma. Hence the major sixth in the cycle of fifths is one comma too wide. But the major sixth is separated from the prime by three fifths, so each fifth must be narrowed or diminished by 1/3 comma so that the whole comma may be distributed among the three fifths, and the major sixth narrowed by one comma, so that it becomes just.</p><p>Therefore it is the 1/3 comma meantone that was first discovered. Only later would the 1/4 comma meantone have been discovered, after someone noticed (or remembered from common tuning practice) that the fourth fifth above the prime is the major third.</p><p>Of course, one might argue that the theorists were more concerned about the major third than the major sixth, but this is questionable; they were concerned about all the thirds and sixths.</p><p>It is true that, all other things being equal, it might seem more attractive to temper a fifth by 1/4 comma than by 1/3 comma. But all other things are NOT equal. The 1/3 comma meantone very nearly closes the cycle of fifths after only 19 degrees, whereas the 1/4 comma meantone requires 31 degrees to do so, and these degrees are by no means so nearly equal. So the dreaded wolf is eliminated much more conveniently by 1/3 comma meantone than by any other tuning, except of course the 12-tone equal, but the harmony of that system is very poor because of its bad thirds and sixths.</p><p>Also, it may be noted that in most timbres it is easier to tune major sixths pure using the beats, than to tune the major thirds pure.</p><p>There is also the matter of the habits of thought of 16th century musicians as regards the accidentals. Musicians had been acquainted with 7 sharps and 7 flats since the 14th century, and 1/3 comma meantone remains reassuringly within this system. But double sharps and double flats were outside musicians&apos; usual frame of reference, and the 1/4 comma meantone of course introduces this unfamiliar concept.</p><p>Therefore it is scarcely surprising that some musicians would have welcomed 1/3 comma meantone, while initially giving 1/4 meantone the cold shoulder. Vicentino was considered a madman, but Nenna founded a whole school of 1/3 meantone proponents.</p><p>However, the course of musical history finally favored 1/4 meantone, or rather a 12 to 17 tone selection of this tuning. It is interesting to speculate why this occurred.</p><p>For one thing, the Neapolitan Kingdom and Rome fell under Spanish influence and the Inquisition, and began to decline economically, while as the result of the 30-Years War Germany was ruined and France became the dominant European power for centuries. But France too was relatively backward in tuning lore compared to the Italians, despite Costeley and Titelouze. Mersenne preferred the just intervals, and could never fully understand why temperament was necessary at all, or desirable. He refers readers interested in temperament to Zarlino and Salinas. Finally, Sauveur, after considering 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 and 1/6 comma meantone, opted for 1/5 meantone, and his choice, together with 1/6 comma, became the usual tuning of the 18th century. 1/3 comma meantone seemed too great a temperament of the fifth, and the Renaissance interest in 19-key chromaticism was replaced by the modulated diatonicism of Haydn, with its self-confinement into 12 keys only. This effectively obscured the virtues of the 1/3 meantone, until even 1/4 comma meantone died out everywhere except in England, where however it survived almost till the end of the 19th century, perhaps because of the very ancient English preference for just thirds and sixths.</p><p>Underlying all this was the confirmed prejudice of keyboard players in favor of 12-tone instruments. As Helmholtz once commented, the convenience of musicians was permitted to take precedence over everything else... to the great discomfiture of those same musicians, who ended up with the horrible harmonies of the 12-tone equal.</p></div><h3>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2011 1:17:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Compared to the main voices on this list, I am relatively clueless about<br/>these issues as well, apollo.

This instrument had<br/>two manuals (keyboards) one of 19 notes and the other 17<br/>notes to the octave.  Each was a conventional (Halberstadt)<br/>layout with split keys.</p><p>The first tuning, and the one most associated him, was<br/>essentially 31 note equal temperament spread over the two<br/>manuals.  The 19 note manual was tuned to a meantone<br/>chain.  (The exact tuning isn&apos;t specified, so you could<br/>call it 1/4 comma meantone or a subset of 31-equal.)  12<br/>notes of the other manual were tuned to a different<br/>meantone chain that you can think of as an extension of the<br/>31-equal tuning.  His notation distinguished between the<br/>two manuals, but he also used equivalent spellings that<br/>show he was thinking of a 31 note scale.  The tuning of the<br/>other 5 keys of the second manual is unclear.</p><p>The second tuning, and the one mentioned in this thread,<br/>had both manuals tuned to meantone but the offset between<br/>the two manuals chosen such that a root played on the first<br/>and a fifth played on the second gave a true 3:2 perfect<br/>fifth.  Because quarter comma meantone has a true 5:4 major<br/>third, it&apos;s possible to get just intonation on this<br/>arrangement.  But some meantone intervals are still going<br/>to be outside just intonation.  It&apos;s what we call a rank 3,<br/>contorted system.  The point of it is probably that your<br/>root motions can follow the first manual, with the fifths<br/>on the second manual to keep pure triads.  That makes it a<br/>simple form of adaptive temperament. Vicentino didn&apos;t<br/>explain this, though.

Now most musicologists know little of temperament, and must take their opinions at second hand. No shame in that, unless the source used happens to be biassed, ignorant or untrustworthy. The first occurence of this opinion that I have found is in an article by Alexander Ellis, the English translator of Helmholtz. I do not have the article to hand, and will leave it to interested readers to locate, if they care to do so. I consulted it many years ago at the University of Georgia Music Library. In an appendix to Helmholtz added by the translator, he dismisses 19-tone equal with the terse comment that its fifths are out of the question. He did not bother to inquire if this minor defect could be remedied, but that is not so surprising; few theorists dared suggest tempering the octave until the 20th century, however slightly. Ellis, though quite influential, does not appear to have had much knowledge of early tunings; perhaps he could not read Latin and Italian fluently enough to consult the original sources.</p><p>Of course it is absurd to assert that 19-tone keyboards were ever built with 1/4 meantone in mind. I will now explain why.</p><p>The first 19-tone harpsichord occurring in musical literature was built to the order of Gioseffo Zarlino. He was a close friend of Francisco Salinas, from the 1550s to the 1580s. Now anyone who has read Salinas&apos; _de musica_ is aware that the main subject of this work is Spanish folk song. This folk song is highly chromatic, and Salinas wanted to discover a tuning system which could exactly render it, and permit him to notate it. He therefore turned to the study of temperament. He discovered that 1/3 comma meantone, which he initially supposed to be his own invention, divided the octave into nineteen very nearly equal 1/3 tones, and that this system was alone adequate for his purposes of precisely rendering the chromatic complexities of Spanish folk song. He also suggested, echoing Aristoxenos, that ancient Greek singers of the enharmonic genus could not have accurately sung 1/4 tones, and must have substituted 1/3 tones instead. Salinas also studied the 1/4 comma meantone, but showed little interest in it, presumably because its 1/5 tones are too narrow to be sung. He was not hostile to it however, noting its just major thirds with approval. But it was not to his purpose.</p><p>Now Salinas, we may be sure, discussed these matters with Zarlino; if he did not, Zarlino would surely have read _de musica_ for it was almost as famous in its day as Zarlino&apos;s own works. Its Latin is elegant and clear, and a pleasure to read. And the Italian Zarlino was aware, unlike the provincial Spaniard Salinas, that 1/3 and 1/4 comma meantone had long been in use in Italy on 12- and 13-tone keyboards. Salinas says that Zarlino so informed him, and Zarlino also refers to the matter.There is nothing like reading the original sources to understand the past!</p><p>But apparently no one had as yet thought of having a 19-tone keyboard made, perhaps because no one was fully aware that 1/3 comma meantone does indeed very nearly close the cycle of fifths after 19 degrees, dividing the octave into 1/3 tones.</p><p>Zarlino proceeded to command such a keyboard to be made. I use the word &grave;command&apos; advisedly; Zarlino, the Choirmaster of St Marks in Venice, was the second most celebrated musician of all Europe, after only Palestrina himself. Zarlino tells us that he did so in order to investigate Salinas&apos; discovery, and to have a perfect instrument. But this strongly implies that he intended it to be tuned in 1/3 comma meantone, with no wolves, and hence &grave;perfect&apos;. That is what this adjective usually means in Renaissance Latin and Italian, when applied to instruments. He would scarcely have thought of ordering such an instrument PRIMARILY to investigate 1/4 comma meantone, for a 19-tone selection of 1/4 comma meantone does not eliminate the wolf, and is not otherwise by any means a natural one, as I will soon show.</p><p>Now when the famed Zarlino ordered such a 19-tone keyboard, and had an engraving of it made to be inserted in his latest work of musical theory, all Europe drew its collective breath.<br/>Soon every musician lay awake at night, dreaming of obtaining the perfect harpsichord or clavi-organ. And this is true even though Zarlino himself was troubled slightly by the flat fifths of the 1/3 comma meantone, though not so troubled that he did not hasten to propose his own compromise between 1/3 comma meantone and 1/4 comma meantone, 2/7 comma meantone. Of course, he never thought of stretching the octave to improve the fifths of 1/3 comma meantone, at the cost of a negligible deterioration of the fourth; tempering the octave, however slightly, was outside his world-view, and one gets the impression that he was not as rigorous a thinker as Salinas. After all, he was basically an artist, not a mathematician.</p><p>Now I turn to why it is logically most unlikely that anyone would order a 19-tone keyboard in order to tune it in 1/4 comma meantone.</p><p>First, I observe that 19-tone instruments fit 1/3 comma meantone like a glove, because in that tuning the augmented third and the diminished fourth, e.g. C-E# &amp; C-Fb, are only a few cents apart, so that they can be confounded with each other, as also are the augmented seventh and the diminished octave, e.g. C-B# &amp; C-Cb. This effectively reduces the number of accidentals from 14 (7 flats and 7 sharps) to 12.</p><p>But this is NOT the case for 1/4 comma meantone, Where these two pairs differ by about 35 cents in width. Hence anyone desiring access to all the first group of accidentals (single sharps and single flats) of the 1/4 comma meantone would certainly not order a 19-tone keyboard, but a 21-tone keyboard. I will note in passing that the most heavily used keys of Handel&apos;s time require 16 or perhaps 17 notes of the 1/4 comma meantone; the rarer keys raise this to 26 or perhaps 27; obviously one cannot be exact in such a fluid matter as key ranges.</p><p>Second, I again observe that a 19-tone selection of the 1/4 comma meantone makes no sense as far as eliminating the wolf, whereas of course 1/3 comma meantone has no wolf, when carried out to 19 tones.</p><p>Third, there is a great deal of evidence that when musicians really did use 1/4 comma meantone, they were content merely to &quot;push the wolf away from the door&quot; by slowly and reluctantly splitting first the G#/Ab accidental, and then others, but almost never beyond 16 tones in the octave. Only the advocates and users of 1/3 comma meantone had any compelling reason to go as high as 19 tones at one stroke, and then to be content to stay at 19.</p><p>Fourth, in most timbres it is much easier to tune the just major sixth by beats than the just major third, or even the just major tenth. This may be why musicians who used 1/4 comma meantone, with its just major thirds, were not enthusiastic about tuning more than 12 or 13 notes in the octave, whereas musicians who used 1/3 comma meantone were not discouraged, at least not much, by tuning 19 notes in the octave.</p><p>Finally, I would like to comment on a tendency I have noted among musical theorists to regard 1/4 comma meantone as much more usual than it really was. They seem to assume that since 12-tone equal has become almost universal during the last century or so, earlier centuries must have had a dominant tuning at all times. This is not at all true. Within a century or so after the invention of 1/3 and 1/4 comma meantone, there were a great many tunings in Europe other than the Pythagorean; by 1700 Sauveur assures us that French musicians preferred 1/5 comma meantone, and by the eighteenth century there were dozens of more-or-less usual tunings, equal and unequal. Also, because only 1/4 comma meantone results in a tone exactly intermediate in width between the minor tone 10:9 and the major tone 9:8, there is sometimes a disposition to regard it as somehow more &grave;orthodox&apos; than the other meantone temperaments. This is however unjustified; the older theorists were little concerned with the exact size of the tone; the consonances were what worried them.</p><p>From the very beginnings of temperament, the world has been largely divided into those who want to somehow tweak 12 tones in the octave into sounding a little better, and those who are willing and eager to make the jump to 19 actual tones in the octave. In my opinion there is no way to make a silk purse out of a sow&apos;s ear, and we should make the jump to 19. Terrestrial brains appear to have made this jump hundreds of thousands, or even hundreds of millions of years ago, because, as I have but very recently discovered, it is about 30 times more efficient to express the 19-tone equal temperament in binary code than any other tuning. Music should follow the native tuning of the brain.</p><p>Gregg Gibson</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2011 8:19:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gregggibson&quot; &lt;gregggibson@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Terrestrial brains appear to have made this jump hundreds of thousands, or even hundreds of millions of years ago, because, as I have but very recently discovered, it is about 30 times more efficient to express the 19-tone equal temperament in binary code than any other tuning.

Logarithms are all equally logarithmic, though logs base 10^(1/1000) (savarts) might be preferred to logs base 2^(1/1200) (cents) if you are a base ten fanatic. For musical purposes, 2 is more important than 10 and dividing an octave into an integer number of parts should be preferred.

Is not the justification for dividing the octave into 12, 19, or 31 parts based on the fact that these are the ratios that we&apos;re attempting to approximate?  Although composers such as Igs and Herman Miller have chosen to concentrate on divisions of the octave that do not closely approximate these ratios for their compositions, the rest of us here have no quarrel with them, because we believe that virtually any kind of tuning can be used to produce worth-while music, and that the skill of the composer in working with the tonal materials is a greater factor for success than the tuning itself.</p><p>&gt; I have been working on a theory that attempts to transcend this division by directly examining the binary code used by the deep brain.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this.

No 15-limit consonance (i.e., an interval ratio expressed using any two integers 15 or lower in value, or inversion thereof) is tempered by more than 3.25 cents.

I already have a key shape intermediate between Bosanquet&apos;s and Wilson&apos;s in my diagram of a keyboard designed for tunings and octave divisions in the pajara temperament class (which have tones in two chains of  wide fifths, with the chains 600 cents apart):<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbPaj34-46.gif">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbPaj34-46.gif</a><br/>(You must be a member of the tuning-math group to access this file.  Most of my files are there, because that&apos;s where space was available at the time I began uploading them.)</p><p>Since both touch-coding and convex key surfaces have already been used on the Motorola Scalatron with generalized keyboard (1975, using elliptical keys, which I expect you won&apos;t find in a patent search, because it wasn&apos;t considered worthwhile to attempt a patent), I can&apos;t imagine what feature(s) you could have come up with that might be patentable unless it&apos;s some particular *combination* of features that those of us who have designed keyboard might regard as too obvious to be suitable for a patent.  If it&apos;s only a variation on Bosanquet that consists of a particular key size &amp; shape, then there&apos;s probably a gray area regarding how close to your key dimensions someone else may come without infringing on your potential patent.  Several decades ago Erv Wilson released quite a few drawings showing considerable variation of size and proportion for hexagonal keys, so the idea of modifications on Bosanquet&apos;s original idea involving variations in size, proportion, and key shape are by this time rather obvious and IMO undeserving of a patent.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I will take this opportunity to add to my post on Alexander Ellis&apos; dislike of the 1/3 comma meantone. Everything and everyone having anything to do with it he treated as a personal enemy. He went so far as to publish an article arguing that Salinas did not know what he was taking about regarding 1/3 comma meantone, and suggesting that he was really describing 1/6 comma meantone instead.

His translation of Helmholtz is unreliable; for those with shaky German it is safer to use the French translation as a crib instead. But perhaps I am falling into my own case of personal dislike. Elis was an ugly fellow too.</p><p>It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve read Ellis&apos;s translation of Helmholz (I have the book), so for now I&apos;ll take your word for it, because I&apos;ve seen enough errors and half-truths on the part of so-called &quot;authorities&quot; that I would have no trouble believing that.</p><p>&gt; Ellis also invented the cent, which is heavily biassed in favor of the 12-tone equal, and succeeded in persuading the anglophone world to use it in preference to the savart, which is of course is in much more direct contact with the ear&apos;s logarithmic hearing. Ever since we have had to confront musicians convinced that the cents somehow &grave;prove&apos; that there are 12 equal semitones in the octave.</p><p>Cents and savarts (or heptamerides, or degrees of 301-EDO) are both logarithmic units of measure, so there is no merit in arguing that one has any advantage over the other on the basis of the way we hear pitches.  However, I quite agree with your observation of the 12-equal bias inherent in cents.  As I will demonstrate below, there are distinct advantages in thinking outside the 12-tone squirrelcage.</p><p>The historical advantage in using savarts was that you could use a four-place base-10 log table to look up the number of savarts in a ratio (expressed as a decimal), since an octave (with ratio 2/1) is exactly 301 savarts and the base-10 logarithm of 2 is .3010 (to 4 decimal places).  However, with the wide availability of computers and scientific calculators, this is no longer necessary.</p><p>A more significant advantage in using savarts is that, because 301-EDO is a fairly good division for approximating harmonics and just ratios (it&apos;s 17-limit consistent), you can round the values for many just ratios off to whole numbers and use them in calculations without the rounding errors that occur with whole-number cents.</p><p>The chief problem with savarts is that, rounded to whole numbers, they lack the precision of cents.  For example, if I want to compare the interval 8505:8192 (the apotome-complement of 35:36) with 26:27, I would not be able to use whole-number savarts, since these two ratios differ by only ~0.4 cents -- much less than 1 savart.  (This is not a contrived example; these are actual ratios that came up in the process of my devising symbols for microtonal accidentals.)  Since I would have to use savarts with decimal places, I would then lose the advantage of having a unit of interval measure that can be expressed as whole numbers.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a better alternative.  My own nomination for a unit of measure is the &quot;mina&quot; (short for &quot;schismina&quot;, a term Dave Keenan coined to represent a class of interval smaller than a schisma).  One mina is 1/2460th of an octave (alternatively defined as 1/233rd of an apotome), which is slightly less than 1/2 cent.  Since 2460-EDO is 27-limit consistent and is far more accurate (in both absolute and relative terms) than lesser octave divisions, it allows many complicated interval calculations free of rounding errors.  In the foregoing example, 8505:8192 is 133.075 minas and 26:27 is 133.942 minas, which round to 133 and 134 minas, respectively.  It&apos;s no accident that the decimal figures are so close to integers: the 2460 division, first suggested by Gene Ward Smith, is highly consistent at the 27 limit.</p><p>Since 2460 is divisible by 12, a semitone of 12-equal is exactly 205 minas.  Didymus&apos; comma (80:81) is 44.088 minas, a number which, when rounded to 44, is divisible by 4, so the tones of 1/4-comma meantone can also be expressed in whole-number minas.</p><p>The usefulness of the mina as a unit of measure doesn&apos;t stop there.  2460 is also divisible by 41, so the tones of 41-EDO can be expressed exactly in whole minas, and they happen to be multiples of 60.  Since 41 also happens to be an excellent division (15-limit consistent), it&apos;s possible to express intervals as degrees of 41 plus leftover minas in exactly the same manner that one writes hours and minutes of time.  For example:</p><p>Ratio   Minas      [degrees of 41]:[minas]<br/>2:3     1439.008   23:59 - rounded from 23:59.008<br/>4:5      791.943   13:12 - rounded from 13:11.943<br/>5:6      647.065   10:47 - rounded from 10:47.065<br/>4:7     1986.093   33:06 - rounded from 33:06.093<br/>80:81     44.088    0:44 - rounded from  0:44.088</p><p>Thus you can round off the numbers in column 2  to whole minas (1439.008 to 1439), or you can round the numbers in column 3 (23:59.008 to 23:59 or, more roughly, to 24), since both the 2460 and 41 divisions allow interval calculations to be performed (within certain limits) without rounding errors.  Of course, these limits are more generous with minas than with degrees of 41.  (Note that 23:59 is *not* the decimal number 23.59.  You must read it as you would read hours and minutes of time, observing that it&apos;s only one mina less than 24:00.)</p><p>In case you didn&apos;t already know, Dave Keenan and I have also devised a system of microtonal accidentals (called Sagittal) capable of distinguishing pitches differing by a single mina.  It consists of a single set of symbols that can be used to notate just intonation (to at least the 31 limit), a huge number of EDO&apos;s, many different temperament classes, and other kinds of tunings.  Although designed for a conventional staff, the Sagittal accidentals may also be used in notations that use staves having other than 7 positions per octave.</p><p>&gt; Helmholtz by the way is said to have become very disturbed at the liberties Ellis took with his German.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In short, Ellis... bad boy, bad boy. But his appendix to Helmholtz is full of interesting material, if one treats it with caution.</p><p>Thanks, Gregg.

A less cheesy and less obvious example of this<br/>is a scale like C C# D# E F# G# A C, which is a fusion of C D# E F# G#<br/>A B C and C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bbb C.</p><p>&gt; Personally, I would have to disagree with this last statement. I find slightly wide fifths (of around 703 to 705 cents) preferable to narrow ones. One of my favorite tunings has fifths tempered wide by ~1.6237 cents in 3 separate chains: one for 3-limit intervals, the second one 5:4 above the first (for ratios of 5), and the third 7:4 above the first (for ratios of 7, 11, and 13). No 15-limit consonance (i.e., an interval ratio expressed using any two integers 15 or lower in value, or inversion thereof) is tempered by more than 3.25 cents. The tuning sounds very much like just intonation (complete with what sounds for all the world like periodicity buzz in isoharmonic chords), and the melodic properties are excellent (IMO).</p><p>I find the fifths of 17-equal to be far more pleasant than the fifths<br/>of 19-equal. 22-equal is where it gets bit too far out in my opinion.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2011 12:33:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 12-equal is also favored for music that makes use of the beautiful<br/>&gt; colors that emerge when 128/125 vanishes.</p><p>Not everyone likes those &quot;beautiful colors&quot;.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2011 12:34:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Feb 21, 2011 at 3:33 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-equal is also favored for music that makes use of the beautiful<br/>&gt; &gt; colors that emerge when 128/125 vanishes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not everyone likes those &quot;beautiful colors&quot;.</p><p>Some people don&apos;t even like the &quot;beautiful colors&quot; that emerge when<br/>81/80 vanishes.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>gregggibson &#x3C;gregggibson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2011 10:10:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I remember reading one comment about 19-equal, probably Barbour&apos;s, where the writer offered the opinion that, judging by the numbers, the major 3rds will sound &quot;insipid in the extreme&quot;.</p><p>Yes, long before I read that he had finally confessed never to have listened to the temperaments he presumed to judge in print, his strange statements led me to suspect his honesty. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There is however a certain limited aspect of the brain&apos;s binary code that favors 12-tone equal almost as much as 19-tone equal, but I confess I am not eager to point this out, for well I know with what joy our conservatories will welcome such a finding, while ignoring everything else. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t quite know what to make of this.  I think 12-equal tends to be favored for its diatonic melodic properties, but 19-equal for its diatonic harmonic properties.  However, 19-equal also provides new melodic intervals that can trump 12, including an alternate (higher) leading tone that makes a wide dissonant third with the dominant that very effectively resolves (both melodically &amp; harmonically) to the tonic tone by 63 cents.  Another thing that can be done in 19, but not in 12, is a rendering of the ancient Greek enharmonic genus.</p><p>I am sorry, but it is premature for me to explain further on this forum. After I have published my theory, I will be glad to answer your questions about it, time permitting. I will however observe that to my ears 12-tone equal sounds very mistuned even in diatonic melody. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The division in the microtonal community is perhaps best described as the old quarrel between the Pythagoreans, who love ratios, and Aristoxenians, who are skeptical that these ratios really exist immanently in the brain, and would rather speak of divisions of the tone or of the octave. The melodic limen strongly favors the latter school, while the beating phenomenon somewhat favors the former, but in most timbres only for some members of the senario and perhaps a septimal or two. If pressed I would describe myself as a moderate Aristoxenian. At one time I pored over the ratios with as much devotion as anyone could wish, however. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t the observation that the most acoustically consonant intervals are expressed as simple-number ratios (due to the elimination of beats) sufficient grounds for affirming that ratios are the single, most significant in determining which intervals are most consonant?  Is not the justification for dividing the octave into 12, 19, or 31 parts based on the fact that these are the ratios that we&apos;re attempting to approximate?  Although composers such as Igs and Herman Miller have chosen to concentrate on divisions of the octave that do not closely approximate these ratios for their compositions, the rest of us here have no quarrel with them, because we believe that virtually any kind of tuning can be used to produce worth-while music, and that the skill of the composer in working with the tonal materials is a greater factor for success than the tuning itself.</p><p>But of course you understand that the presence of beats is dependent upon the presence of the relevant partial pairs; they are by no means invariably present. Few timbres will have all the partials present necessary even to define all members of the senario by beats. For example, if the eighth or fifth partial is weak, or their multiples, then 8:5 will NOT be surrounded by audible beats. This is one of the basic flaws with Helmholtz&apos; theory; he himself recognized this, and offered his theory of consonance in a somewhat diffident manner. The modern just intonationists, with their worship of the ratios, seized upon Helmholtz&apos; theory for their own purposes. GG</p><p>It is true that the senario favors the 19- and 31-tone equal among others, but this is by no means the only consideration. The melodic limen of 55-60 cents favors the 19-tone equal, and no other tuning. And the brain&apos;s binary code also strongly favors it, quite apart from the simple ratios. GG</p><p>By the way, another correspondent asserts that cents are logarithms. They are not. Neither are savarts. Only logarithms are logarithms. One can of course divide the octave into any artificial number of measuring degrees that one desires by the use of a conversion factor, but the resulting artificial division is not a logarithm. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have been working on a theory that attempts to transcend this division by directly examining the binary code used by the deep brain. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand this.  Are you claiming to have deciphered the circuitry in the part of the neural network of the human brain that processes musical sounds?</p><p>Yes. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ellis also invented the cent, which is heavily biassed in favor of the 12-tone equal, and succeeded in persuading the anglophone world to use it in preference to the savart, which is of course is in much more direct contact with the ear&apos;s logarithmic hearing. Ever since we have had to confront musicians convinced that the cents somehow &grave;prove&apos; that there are 12 equal semitones in the octave. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cents and savarts (or heptamerides, or degrees of 301-EDO) are both logarithmic units of measure, so there is no merit in arguing that one has any advantage over the other on the basis of the way we hear pitches.  However, I quite agree with your observation of the 12-equal bias inherent in cents.  As I will demonstrate below, there are distinct advantages in thinking outside the 12-tone squirrelcage.</p><p>I did not say that the savart is a logarithm. But because its conversion factor is 1000, it is less likely to confuse beginners, who often do not fully realize that we measure intervals in logarithms, so that we may replace multiplication and division of ratios by addition and subtraction. It is incidentally somewhat more logical to use base 2 logarithms, since the octave equals 2, not 10. But this is really trivial of course. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The historical advantage in using savarts was that you could use a four-place base-10 log table to look up the number of savarts in a ratio (expressed as a decimal), since an octave (with ratio 2/1) is exactly 301 savarts and the base-10 logarithm of 2 is .3010 (to 4 decimal places).</p><p>Yes, but there are not EXACTLY 301 savarts in the octave; there are more digits. Usually at least 8 digits are used. The errors quickly become serious otherwise. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A more significant advantage in using savarts is that, because 301-EDO is a fairly good division for approximating harmonics and just ratios (it&apos;s 17-limit consistent), you can round the values for many just ratios off to whole numbers and use them in calculations without the rounding errors that occur with whole-number cents.</p><p>The so-called 17-limit is an artefact, not a reality, because the  brain has no way to identify such intervals, save in the unlikely event that such high partial pairs are present. But such timbres are very harsh and unmusical. Personally I always carry cents and savarts out to at least 8 digits. GG</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The chief problem with savarts is that, rounded to whole numbers, they lack the precision of cents.  For example, if I want to compare the interval 8505:8192 (the apotome-complement of 35:36) with 26:27, I would not be able to use whole-number savarts, since these two ratios differ by only ~0.4 cents -- much less than 1 savart.  (This is not a contrived example; these are actual ratios that came up in the process of my devising symbols for microtonal accidentals.)  Since I would have to use savarts with decimal places, I would then lose the advantage of having a unit of interval measure that can be expressed as whole numbers.</p><p>Other than for avoiding calculation errors, there is no particular point in greater accuracy than the differential limen however. No one can hear a cent difference. Even the savart is near the edge of differential perception.

The first example is the logarithm with base 10, the second is the logarithm with base &quot;e&quot;, the third is the logarithm with base 2. All of these are logarithmical measurements, only their bases are different. First to note, the logarithm with base 10 is not called the &quot;natural logarithm&quot; since this term is used for the base &quot;e&quot; logarithm. Secodn, there&apos;s also the binary logarithm, which corresponds to octaves in hearing frequency ratios. This means there&apos;s no need to use logarithms with base 10 for musical purposes when there&apos;s actually a more useful thing, the base 2 (or binary) logarithm. Now, if you multiply this by 1200 or if you use a logarithm of base 2^(1/1200), you get cents. If you can, get your calculator, try it and you&apos;ll see we were right. Because binary logarithm is a logarithmical unit, then also a 12-EDO semitone is a logarithmical unit and so are cents. This is because of the definition of logarithms which has been agreed upon centuries ago so there&apos;s not too much of a point in trying to change the definition.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2011 11:16:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gregggibson&quot; &lt;gregggibson@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;It is all very silly, even pathetic.

That is to say, one must<br/>&gt; raise 10 to about the 0.30103 power to make it equal 2.</p><p>Note that Gregg says that Nature *divides the octave into 0.30103 units*.<br/>Not that it breaks the octave into multiple parts, each of which is .30103<br/>in size, but that it &quot;divides the octave into 0.30103 units&quot;.</p><p>Think about what that means. By analogy, consider taking a banana and<br/>dividing it into three units, i.e., cutting it into thirds. 1 banana / 3<br/>units = 1/3 banana / unit.</p><p>Now, if you take a banana and *divide it into 0.30103 units, *what have you<br/>done, really? Using the same math, 1 banana / 0.30103 units = 3.32 bananas /<br/>unit.</p><p>Instead of dividing something into a larger number of units, you are<br/>&quot;dividing&quot; something into a *smaller* number of units. Which is to say, you<br/>haven&apos;t divided anything. You have assembled it. Each unit is a<br/>Frankenstein&apos;s superbanana that is the conglomeration of over three bananas.</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s pretty funny. But ignore the obvious language problem / math<br/>misconception for a moment and let&apos;s talk about logarithms.</p><p>Logarithms can have any base. Gregg is working in base 10. But someone could<br/>just as easily use 13.</p><p>That person would say, &quot;Nature divides the octave 2/1 or 2:1 into about<br/>0.270238 units, because one must raise 13 to about the 0.270238 power to<br/>make it equal 2. (I.e., 0.270238 is the log (base 13) of 2.&quot; Again, ignore<br/>the gibberish about &quot;dividing&quot; the octave into fractional units. The math in<br/>this paragraph is essentially equivalent to what Gregg posited.</p><p>And it&apos;s equally useless. The choice of 13 was arbitrary, just as Gregg&apos;s<br/>choice of 10 was arbitrary. What does the 10 or 13 *actually tell us* about<br/>anything? To what do they correlate?</p><p>Nothing in particular.</p><p>The so-called natural logarithm seems less arbitrary because it has the word<br/>&quot;natural&quot; in it. But that doesn&apos;t correlate to anything interesting, either.</p><p>More than either 10 or 13, it would make more sense to say that Nature<br/>divides the octave 2/1 into about 1 unit, because that is the log (base 2)<br/>of 2. That is to say, one must raise 2 to the 1 power to make it equal 2.<br/>One must raise 2 to the 2 power to make it equal 4. One must raise it to the<br/>3 power to make it equal 8.</p><p>It seems boring, but it&apos;s precisely this correlation -- the fact that 1, 2,<br/>and 3 are integers instead of something like 0.30103 -- that makes it a<br/>non-arbitrary measurement. Our ears take these intervals and make them sound<br/>&quot;the same&quot;. Each unit is a successive octave.</p><p>Got that? If you use 2 as the logarithm base, each unit is an octave.</p><p>*Now* we&apos;re talking. But that unit isn&apos;t a very precise measure, so let&apos;s<br/>make it finer-grained. Let&apos;s, say, divide that 1 unit into, say, 1200<br/>mini-units -- which neatly corresponds with each 12-EDO semitone having 100<br/>mini-units.</p><p>The fact that it&apos;s 100 mini-units (as opposed to 500 or 235 or whatever) is<br/>somewhat arbitrary, but it&apos;s enough mini-units to provide reasonable<br/>precision, and few enough that a difference of a few mini-units is<br/>detectable.</p><p>Since it&apos;s 100 mini-units per semitone, let&apos;s call these mini-units &quot;cents&quot;.</p><p>Now the choice is clear:</p><p>You can use an arbitrary system endorsed by only one person on the planet<br/>that makes not-particularly-usable units based on powers of 10.</p><p>Or you can use the common system that makes cents.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2011 10:04:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>[Gregg wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been working on a theory that attempts to transcend this division by directly examining the binary code used by the deep brain.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand this.

I have tried at least a score of 19-tone designs over the years, and I believe this is perhaps the best solution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bosanquet&apos;s brother was an admiral, but you probably mean Thomas Perronet Thompson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fortunately, there is a better alternative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Several better ones, in fact. You might also mention 612, which is divisible not only by 12 but also 17, which you ought to like. Then there&apos;s Woolhouse&apos;s 730, and Woolhouse has priority in this matter. 730 is not 29-limit consistent, but its patent val does score better in the 29 limit than anything smaller, including consistent divisions. 882et is the first to beat it.</p><p>Of course, 612 is great for the 5-limit, but it falls apart at 17.  I disqualify 730 for its excessive amount of error (37% of degree), which causes ratios containing 7^2 as a factor to fail the rounding test.  I also want an extremely low error (&lt;1%) for prime 3, because ratios of interest frequently have relatively high powers of 3 as factors; the 5-schisma contains 3^8, where 882 fails.  Minas can express tones in a Pythagorean chain well beyond 3^50 without rounding errors.</p><p>&gt; Still, for general xenharmonic purposes it&apos;s hard to beat the mina, except for the little fact that cents are already established. I&apos;d use it if not for that.</p><p>Yeah, even I&apos;m not using them yet.  I intend to introduce them in The Book and to use them throughout, with the corresponding number of cents in parentheses.

GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There is however a certain limited aspect of the brain&apos;s binary code that favors 12-tone equal almost as much as 19-tone equal, but I confess I am not eager to point this out, for well I know with what joy our conservatories will welcome such a finding, while ignoring everything else. GG<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t quite know what to make of this.  I think 12-equal tends to be favored for its diatonic melodic properties, but 19-equal for its diatonic harmonic properties.  However, 19-equal also provides new melodic intervals that can trump 12, including an alternate (higher) leading tone that makes a wide dissonant third with the dominant that very effectively resolves (both melodically &amp; harmonically) to the tonic tone by 63 cents.  Another thing that can be done in 19, but not in 12, is a rendering of the ancient Greek enharmonic genus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am sorry, but it is premature for me to explain further on this forum. After I have published my theory, I will be glad to answer your questions about it, time permitting. I will however observe that to my ears 12-tone equal sounds very mistuned even in diatonic melody. GG</p><p>I should mention that not everyone who has tried 19-equal has liked it.  In Joel Mandelbaum&apos;s doctoral thesis, &quot;Multiple Division of the Octave and the Tonal Resources of 19o?=tone Temperament&quot; (1961), he mentions (in chapter 11 on Joseph Yasser), he states that: &quot;Yasser appears to have been the principal influence on McClure in England, who built a 19-tone harmonium.  According to Schafer, who maintained a correspondence with McClure (now deceased), McClure was not altogether satisfied with the results and finally decided that the fifths and thirds were too small.&quot;  Evidently McClure was already familiar with 1/4-comma meantone temperament and wouldn&apos;t settle for something not as &quot;good&quot; as that.</p><p>Having worked with both 19-equal and 31-equal (the virtual equivalent for 1/4-comma meantone) for several decades, I fully understand his reservations regarding 19.  When I first tried it, I had already tried 1/4-comma meantone and was not able to accept 19 &quot;right out of the box.&quot;  It required a &quot;break-in&quot; period of about a week to get accustomed to its diatonic melodic properties, which I now regard as a sort of &quot;accent&quot; that the &quot;language&quot; of Meantone is &quot;spoken&quot; with in Nineteen-tone Land.  Once I got used to it, I found it quite charming for most music written between 1500 and 1750 and very suitable for a blues idiom (by virtue of its augmented 2nds and 6ths).  It also tends to lose its diatonic &quot;accent&quot; when used in non-diatonic scales (of which it is abundantly capable, as Gene noted).</p><p>Yet, in spite of all this, 19-equal is definitely not in my Top Five List of Favorite Tunings.  However, one tuning that contains a closed circle of 19 (unequal) fifths *is* in my Top Two, because it significantly improves five of the six 7-limit consonances and also allows 15-limit harmony in 3 different keys.  I have little interest in a tuning that would limit consonant intervals to the senario.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The division in the microtonal community is perhaps best described as the old quarrel between the Pythagoreans, who love ratios, and Aristoxenians, who are skeptical that these ratios really exist immanently in the brain, and would rather speak of divisions of the tone or of the octave. The melodic limen strongly favors the latter school, while the beating phenomenon somewhat favors the former, but in most timbres only for some members of the senario and perhaps a septimal or two. If pressed I would describe myself as a moderate Aristoxenian. At one time I pored over the ratios with as much devotion as anyone could wish, however. GG<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t the observation that the most acoustically consonant intervals are expressed as simple-number ratios (due to the elimination of beats) sufficient grounds for affirming that ratios are the single, most significant in determining which intervals are most consonant?  Is not the justification for dividing the octave into 12, 19, or 31 parts based on the fact that these are the ratios that we&apos;re attempting to approximate?  Although composers such as Igs and Herman Miller have chosen to concentrate on divisions of the octave that do not closely approximate these ratios for their compositions, the rest of us here have no quarrel with them, because we believe that virtually any kind of tuning can be used to produce worth-while music, and that the skill of the composer in working with the tonal materials is a greater factor for success than the tuning itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But of course you understand that the presence of beats is dependent upon the presence of the relevant partial pairs; they are by no means invariably present. Few timbres will have all the partials present necessary even to define all members of the senario by beats. For example, if the eighth or fifth partial is weak, or their multiples, then 8:5 will NOT be surrounded by audible beats. This is one of the basic flaws with Helmholtz&apos; theory; he himself recognized this, and offered his theory of consonance in a somewhat diffident manner. The modern just intonationists, with their worship of the ratios, seized upon Helmholtz&apos; theory for their own purposes. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is true that the senario favors the 19- and 31-tone equal among others, but this is by no means the only consideration. The melodic limen of 55-60 cents favors the 19-tone equal, and no other tuning.</p><p>What do you mean by putting the melodic limen at 55-60 cents?  You seem to be saying that an interval of less than 55 cents or so cannot be perceived melodically, but that can&apos;t be right.  We can easily hear an interval of a comma, which is less than half that size.  If you&apos;re saying that anything smaller than about 55 cents is unsuitable for use as a melodic interval, I must strongly disagree, because my own experience informs me that steps of 31-equal are melodically distinct, i.e., I clearly perceive them as being in different pitch-classes.  Furthermore, I clearly perceive any two intervals of 31-equal differing in size by a single degree (e.g., a major 3rd and neutral 3rd) as being both melodically and harmonically distinct.</p><p>But wait a minute!  What do you mean by &quot;19-tone equal, and no other tuning&quot; being favored by this melodic limen.  Doesn&apos;t 22-equal also make it?  The greatest liability I found with 19-equal is that it doesn&apos;t have a good dominant 7th chord: in C-E-G-Bb the top tone is too high and in C-E-G-A# it&apos;s too low.  22-equal has a very nice dominant 7th chord, with three thirds of different sizes, and it permits the chord progression C, F, G7, C with the tonic of F and the 7th of G7 to be the same pitch.  What about that?  (And in case you&apos;re wondering, 22-equal also didn&apos;t make my Top Five List, but 31-equal did.)</p><p>&gt; And the brain&apos;s binary code also strongly favors it, quite apart from the simple ratios. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, another correspondent asserts that cents are logarithms. They are not. Neither are savarts. Only logarithms are logarithms. One can of course divide the octave into any artificial number of measuring degrees that one desires by the use of a conversion factor, but the resulting artificial division is not a logarithm. GG<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been working on a theory that attempts to transcend this division by directly examining the binary code used by the deep brain. GG<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t understand this.  Are you claiming to have deciphered the circuitry in the part of the neural network of the human brain that processes musical sounds?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. GG</p><p>&lt;Gasp!&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ellis also invented the cent, which is heavily biassed in favor of the 12-tone equal, and succeeded in persuading the anglophone world to use it in preference to the savart, which is of course is in much more direct contact with the ear&apos;s logarithmic hearing. Ever since we have had to confront musicians convinced that the cents somehow &grave;prove&apos; that there are 12 equal semitones in the octave. GG<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cents and savarts (or heptamerides, or degrees of 301-EDO) are both logarithmic units of measure, so there is no merit in arguing that one has any advantage over the other on the basis of the way we hear pitches.  However, I quite agree with your observation of the 12-equal bias inherent in cents.  As I will demonstrate below, there are distinct advantages in thinking outside the 12-tone squirrelcage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did not say that the savart is a logarithm.</p><p>Nevertheless it is, whether you say so or not.</p><p>&gt; But because its conversion factor is 1000, it is less likely to confuse beginners, who often do not fully realize that we measure intervals in logarithms, so that we may replace multiplication and division of ratios by addition and subtraction. It is incidentally somewhat more logical to use base 2 logarithms, since the octave equals 2, not 10. But this is really trivial of course. GG<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The historical advantage in using savarts was that you could use a four-place base-10 log table to look up the number of savarts in a ratio (expressed as a decimal), since an octave (with ratio 2/1) is exactly 301 savarts and the base-10 logarithm of 2 is .3010 (to 4 decimal places).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but there are not EXACTLY 301 savarts in the octave; there are more digits. Usually at least 8 digits are used. The errors quickly become serious otherwise. GG</p><p>Okay, I stand corrected; it&apos;s not exactly 1/301 octave.  But then, why should anyone want to use  an interval measure in which an octave is not exactly a whole number of units?  For me, it&apos;s a deal-breaker!</p><p>&gt; &gt; A more significant advantage in using savarts is that, because 301-EDO is a fairly good division for approximating harmonics and just ratios (it&apos;s 17-limit consistent), you can round the values for many just ratios off to whole numbers and use them in calculations without the rounding errors that occur with whole-number cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The so-called 17-limit is an artefact, not a reality, because the  brain has no way to identify such intervals, save in the unlikely event that such high partial pairs are present. But such timbres are very harsh and unmusical.</p><p>I believe that a rational interval is entitled to be called a consonance if it&apos;s possible to distinguish by ear that ratio in just intonation from tempered approximations of that ratio by a few cents.  I have observed that beating of harmonic partials is not the only way to discern whether intervals are in virtually-exact rational ratios or not.  There&apos;s another factor that comes into play when those intervals are used in isoharmonic chords.  In the tetrad 9:11:13:15, for example, it&apos;s easy to tell whether one of the inner tones is mistuned, even with timbres having weak 11th or 13th partials.  The same should hold true for the triad 14:17:20 (try it!).  How would you explain this phenomenon?</p><p>&gt; Personally I always carry cents and savarts out to at least 8 digits. GG</p><p>You&apos;ve just sealed the deal for me on minas!</p><p>&gt; &gt; The chief problem with savarts is that, rounded to whole numbers, they lack the precision of cents.  For example, if I want to compare the interval 8505:8192 (the apotome-complement of 35:36) with 26:27, I would not be able to use whole-number savarts, since these two ratios differ by only ~0.4 cents -- much less than 1 savart.  (This is not a contrived example; these are actual ratios that came up in the process of my devising symbols for microtonal accidentals.)  Since I would have to use savarts with decimal places, I would then lose the advantage of having a unit of interval measure that can be expressed as whole numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other than for avoiding calculation errors, there is no particular point in greater accuracy than the differential limen however. No one can hear a cent difference. Even the savart is near the edge of differential perception. GG</p><p>You can easily tell the difference between a tempered fifth in 17-EDO and one in 22-EDO (about 1 savart difference), and I think you can also tell the difference between one in 19-EDO vs. one in 31-EDO (about 2 cents difference).  It would be nice if our unit of measure were smaller than what we&apos;re able to hear.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2011 10:06:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gregggibson&quot; &lt;gregggibson@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt; Although composers such as Igs and Herman Miller have chosen to &lt;concentrate on divisions of the octave that do not closely approximate these ratios for their compositions, the rest of us here have no quarrel with them, because we believe that virtually any kind of tuning can be used to produce worth-while music, and that the skill of the composer in working with the tonal materials is a greater factor for success than the tuning itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are followers of Stockhausen. You have no quarrel with them? I doubt that everyone here views such experiments with enthusiasm. Although I do not wish to persecute such experiments, they are entirely in contradiction with common musical experience. No composer of the past, however open-minded, would have accepted such an idea. They would have assumed the theorist who proposed it to be insane. I personally do not feel that strongly, but it is a very strange idea, and entirely outside my musical world-view. GG</p><p>It&apos;s standard practice in places like Thailand and Indonesia.</p><p>&gt; Such experiments should never be funded by the public, in my opinion. They are really just a form of public exhibitionism. What you are saying is that there is no such thing as being &quot;in tune&quot;, but that all tunings are of more or less equal worth. I would disagree with such an assertion. GG</p><p>I didn&apos;t say that all tunings are of more or less equal worth.  I said that I believe that folks around here &quot;believe that virtually any kind of tuning can be used to produce worth-while music, and that the skill of the composer in working with the tonal materials is a greater factor for success than the tuning itself.&quot;  I have heard microtonal music written in &quot;good&quot; tunings that I thought was poorly written and that I would not care to listen to again, and I have also heard music (e.g., pieces by Easley Blackwood, Herman Miller, and Igs) written in so-called &quot;bad&quot; tunings that I thought was well written, to which I have listened again numerous times, because they stretch my musical horizon with their unconventional (and unexpected) tonal relationships.  For example, a tuning such as 15-EDO has three small circles of fifths, each of which includes a tempered 7/4, but not a tempered 5/4 (which you must go to a different circle to get).  It&apos;s a very different world of sound, something like visiting an alien planet.</p><p>Personally, I can&apos;t imagine myself wanting to write for that sort of tuning, because I believe that there are &quot;better&quot; options available to me as a composer.  Therefore, I don&apos;t think that all tunings are of more or less equal worth.  It&apos;s more a matter that not all of us agree on which ones to value most highly.</p><p>Ah, there&apos;s one exception that I&apos;ll need to confess.  I am probably the first person ever to have produced a piece in 11-EDO, in 1970, using a retuned electronic organ.  (I had promised Igs that I would convert my open-reel tape recording to a sound file, but it completely slipped my mind; I&apos;ll have to get on it this weekend.)  Having observed that there is not much consonance-to-dissonance contrast in the intervals of 11-EDO (except for the unison and octave), and since there is nothing approximating a perfect 5th (which makes it fairly easy to avoid implying a tonic key or tonal center), I concluded that this tuning would be much more suitable for atonal music than 12, so much so that there wouldn&apos;t even be any need to bother with tone rows: just use whatever tones you feel like using, whenever and wherever you wish.  I tried it, and it worked beautifully!  12-tone serialism is a movement that chooses to ignore the fact that the various intervals of 12-equal have different acoustical properties, some being more consonant than others.  With 11-EDO, by contrast, the tuning cooperates with their goal, with or without a serial technique.</p><p>&gt; I would strongly disagree that individual genius can overcome even a tuning that, for example, has no consonances. This is rather like saying that Virgil could have written the AEneid without vowels, or better, without an alphabet, or better still, without a language at all. GG</p><p>Igs already made the point that a tuning with no consonances does not exist, but your statement can be disproved even with a tuning with minimal consonance-to-dissonance contrast.</p><p>&gt; Your opinion is not uncommon among microtonalists, although very uncommon among musicians.</p><p>Be careful with your words!  Someone may infer that microtonalists are not musicians! ;-)</p><p>&gt; It arises perhaps as a reaction against the overwhelming dominance of the 12-tone equal. In order for music to affect the emotions, it must be memorable, and conform at least roughly to the brains&apos;s own innate tuning system. Music written in say, 13-tone equal is just random noise.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you would say that if you had actually listened to anything in 13-EDO.  If you haven&apos;t, then here&apos;s your chance (Herman Miller&apos;s &quot;Triskaidekaphobia&quot;, an exercise in 13-tone equal tuning, is a little more than halfway down the page):<br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a></p><p>You may not like the piece, &quot;Dr. Barbour&quot;, but be careful of using hyperbole to dismiss something without a hearing.  If there&apos;s any consolation, you&apos;re not the only one here who has done that; I did it myself when I first showed up here with a microtonal notation that I expected would be useful for just about any &quot;worth-while&quot; tuning:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/34231">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/34231</a><br/>Eventually I realized that my notation would need to be expanded to handle both these weird octave divisions and also divisions with literally hundreds of tones per octave.  Dave Keenan and I developed the essentials of Sagittal over the next 18 months, but it took about 5 years to address numerous additional details and concerns.</p><p>&gt; It can have no more musical effect than street noises. Again, I do not say that such extreme ideas are entirely harmful. Perhaps a period of wild liberty is needed to break up the 12-tone equal mould.

But<br/>&gt; mathematically, the derivation of the generator is simple:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Start with 6/5 * 2/1, or 12/5.<br/>&gt; 2) You know that three generators will get you to 12/5, meaning that g^3 = 12/5.<br/>&gt; 3) Therefore, g = (12/5)^(1/3).<br/>&gt; 4) So what is g in cents? cents(g) = 1200*log(g)/log(2) =<br/>&gt; 1200*log((12/5)^(1/3))/log(2)<br/>&gt; 5) Since log(x^y) = y * log(x), the 1/3 comes outside of the log and<br/>&gt; you get 1/3 * 1200 * log(12/5)/log(2)<br/>&gt; 6) This equals 505.214 cents.

In a famous interview, he was asked why he wanted to use 12-tone equal at all. His system implies that dissonances and consonances are to be treated in exactly the same fashion, so why use 12-tone equal, which has at least two very good consonances, the fifth and octave?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Poor Schoenberg was thoroughly nonplussed. After sputtering and going red in the face, he finally confessed he did not know the answer to the question, but that he had to use what was available for the orchestra - 12-tone instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even more ironically, the serialists now venerate the 12-tone equal more than most, again without logical reason. They do not have the courage of their convictions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gregg Gibson<br/>&gt;</p></div>
