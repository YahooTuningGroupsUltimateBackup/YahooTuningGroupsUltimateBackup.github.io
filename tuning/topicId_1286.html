You play bass and guitar. Would you be interested in<br/>exploring other scales with those instruments? You mention an interest in<br/>piano and violin. Yes, the violin is intrinsically a microtonal instrument.<br/>The piano is not and is very hard to retune. But if you instead mean an<br/>electronic keyboard with a piano sound, then that can be easy to retune to<br/>at least some scales, depending on the model.</p><p>In getting started, are you interested in performance, composition, theory,<br/>all? Have you heard of just intonation? Of Harry Partch? Are you familiar<br/>much with any types of world music?</p><p>Best,</p><p>Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1288 href="#1288">ðŸ”—</a>Jimmy &#x3C;dead_dude32@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2004 4:29:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hi Jimmy,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be really helpful if you could clarify your interests and<br/>goals<br/>&gt; here just a little bit.

As well as being<br/>the ultimate in microtonal, it will really help develop your ear to hear the<br/>intervals and have an intuition for them.</p><p>&gt; harry partch nope im never heard about the person.</p><p>He is a composer and musical instrument designer who was a major figure in<br/>the world of microtonality. If you can find his book &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; in<br/>a library or bookstore (can also find it on amazon), it is a good read and<br/>discusses a lot of interesting things about tuning and also shows some of<br/>his strange and unusual instruments. That&apos;s a good book to start with if<br/>looking for inspiration.</p><p>&gt; how do you mean world music? as in latain jazz tribal drums and old<br/>&gt; folk songs.</p><p>Yes - music from other cultures often uses tunings that are different from<br/>western music. For example, Arabic music uses tunings that are the<br/>descendents of tunings used by the ancient greeks. In Indonesia, they have<br/>orchestras called gamelans made up largely of metallophones (instruments<br/>with metal keys) and gongs. These instruments use very interesting scales.<br/>So listening to world music can give some ideas about what is possible with<br/>different tunings.</p><p>&gt; but i do prefer to get a paino but funds are limited so<br/>&gt; i have to resort to a replacement keyboard for now which sucks.</p><p>Alas, not very many modern hardware synths are retunable. Those that are<br/>usually don&apos;t support the full keyboard retuning needed to work with the<br/>most interesting scales. But many software synths nowadays are retunable.<br/>Also there are ways using software to make many nonretunable synths<br/>retunable.</p><p>One can study the theory for years, but the most important thing about<br/>learning about microtonality is to actually play with different scales on<br/>instruments and let your ear be your guide. Defretting your bass is a great<br/>place to start with that.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
