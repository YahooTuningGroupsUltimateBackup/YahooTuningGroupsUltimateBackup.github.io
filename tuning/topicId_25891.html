I am not an expert in gamelan,<br/>although I greatly enjoy the music, but this question can and perhaps should<br/>be asked by anyone involved in study and practice of world music. Substitute<br/>any other musical genre in place of the word gamelan, ask the same question,<br/>I think the answers would be enlightening.</p><p>My specialties are with traditional folk music, mostly of American and/or<br/>European origin, particularly Celtic, Appalachian, delta blues, and eastern<br/>European klezmer, among others. In all of these musics, non 12-ET pitches<br/>are used widely, and with specific intent, but not generally discussed by<br/>the players in terms used by people on this type of forum. If we look at<br/>these musics from a perspective gained from study of JI and microtonality,<br/>we will often see use of natural scales and harmonies.</p><p>At the same time, I find that, although I&apos;ve been intensely studying JI with<br/>the goals of achieving the ability to accurately and consistently play just<br/>intervals for my own composition, I have no desire to impose too much<br/>precision of analysis of intonation on my folk music playing. For example,<br/>rather than over-analyzing a folk tune to see exactly which third or seventh<br/>is being used, whether a 3, 5, 7 or other limit, seems counter-intuitive to<br/>just listening to the old and young masters live and on 78s, and playing the<br/>tune by ear with these microtonal shadings. After all, folk music is an oral<br/>tradition.</p><p>It is unfortunately all too easy for the perspective of the folk<br/>practitioner to be dismissed or ignored in a forum where everything is<br/>discussed from a more mathematic approach, simply because that person isn&apos;t<br/>speaking the academic language &quot;properly&quot;. And so it is important for us on<br/>this list to learn to truly listen to other voices and other ways of using<br/>microtonality. Otherwise we greatly run the risk of an elitist discourse.<br/>For that matter, the very fact that we are having this discussion in English<br/>on the internet is excluding people who either might wish to be part of this<br/>dialog, but don&apos;t have access to the computer technology that all of us on<br/>this list enjoy, and/or they don&apos;t speak English.</p><p>Thanks again for bringing up this question, I look forward to hearing other<br/>peoples&apos; thoughts on this subject.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div><h3>Michael Saunders &#x3C;michaelsaunders7@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2001 6:11:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>You&apos;ve brought up some points that have been the focus of much<br/>of my work---obviously, fascinating points, in my opinion!<br/>As you know, my work involves the representation of music<br/>theories as pieces of software.  I strove, from the beginning<br/>of my project, to be as general as possible; it&apos;s one of my<br/>design tennants that any existing musical object (a scale, say)<br/>should be representable by my system and, furthermore, that<br/>anything we might call a scale (whether it already exists or<br/>not) should be representable as a Rusty scale.</p><p>This wasn&apos;t the result of any sort of politically correct impulse,<br/>but came out of practical experience (I don&apos;t think every musical<br/>idea is equal, but I think they&apos;re all useful to some degree).<br/>I found ideas from other music theories fascinating and useful<br/>in composition, but I also found, when trying to learn about them,<br/>that _writing_ about music theories was uniformly confused and<br/>insular throughout the world.  So, I set out, for each sort of<br/>musical object, to find the format for representing its various<br/>manifestations most naturally.  Of course, world music theories<br/>informed this to a great degree, but I also found useful a sort<br/>of &quot;first principles&quot; approach to the business of seeking these<br/>&quot;forms of forms&quot; of music theories.  At the end, I think I&apos;ve<br/>got a universal, tradition-independent (or nearly so) language<br/>for talking about music theories and, since it&apos;s in the form of<br/>software, for animating them in practice.</p><p>Underlying all this, there&apos;s an interesting assumption---I think<br/>there is a one-to-one correspondence between musical traditions<br/>or generes and the music theories that generate them.  I also<br/>think that the relationship between different genres/theories is<br/>probably a lot like that between different languages---if we<br/>mapped them we would find trees with branches, borrowed elements,<br/>etc.  In looking for a universal language for music theory/style,<br/>I didn&apos;t look exclusively to the tree of Western music and its many<br/>branches, but to the whole forest and, more than that, to the<br/>nature of the objects themselves.</p><p>For a tuning example, I think that representing tunings as<br/>networks of fuzzily-defined intervals reflects in a general<br/>way (the fuzzy intervals could be effectively crisp) the way<br/>everyone thinks of tunings, consciously or not.  Of course,<br/>there&apos;s a lot more to it than that---there are many refinements,<br/>modifiers, parameters and so on---to use a gamelen example, I<br/>allow the possiblity of mis-tuned unisons with a unison offset<br/>parameter---a subtlety informed by Balinese practices.</p><p>So, is my system complete, correct and useful (Aquinas would ask<br/>if it had wholeness, harmony and radiance)?  I think so, but I<br/>invite everybody to give me their opinions (especially you, Margo!).<br/>If there are any specific points that I&apos;ve fallen short on, I&apos;d<br/>love to hear about them!</p><p>You also asked some interesting, more specific questions:</p><p>&gt;          (1) If a sizable portion of the people discussing gamelan<br/>&gt;              intonation here were Balinese or Javanese gamelan<br/>&gt;              musicians, how might the discussion be different?</p><p>In that case, I think that a lot of the discussion would revolve<br/>around the nature and practice of _embat_---the subtle differences<br/>between different realizations of the same tuning system.  It&apos;s<br/>a fascinating subject---the different flavors that can be gained<br/>by small variations on intonation.  I think it&apos;s similar to the<br/>differences between well-temperaments and their keys (and that it<br/>has a similar underlying representation)---to use an example from<br/>&quot;our&quot; music.  I always wondered why this was so seldom discussed<br/>on the list.</p><p>&gt;          (2) If a sizable portion our our participants came from<br/>&gt;              a range of world polyphonic traditions featuring, to<br/>&gt;              use the interval categories of the European compositional<br/>&gt;              tradition, a variety of preferences such as parallel<br/>&gt;              fifths, fourths, thirds, or seconds, how might &quot;n-limit&quot;<br/>&gt;              concepts vary in formulation or musical significance?</p><p>I&apos;m not so sure about how this would affect notions of n-limit<br/>(except that it might be more important in traditions where seconds<br/>were prominent) but, it would be nice to see more discussion<br/>about voice leading (and harmonic function, come to think of it)<br/>with different tunings.  Your posts are refreshing for that reason!<br/>Unfortunately, I&apos;m afraid most people just doodle around with<br/>a new scale rather than thinking about it.  I love it when people<br/>think.</p><p>&gt;          (3) If the numeration systems connected with these musics --<br/>&gt;              not always necessarily formalized for all aspects of<br/>&gt;              a musical piece or performance -- were part of our<br/>&gt;              common vocabulary, how might dialogues on &quot;music and<br/>&gt;              math&quot; take on a new direction, or many new directions?</p><p>Here, I have to ask you to clarify what you mean by &quot;numeration&quot;.<br/>Do you mean the format for expressing intervals (JI, ET, fuzzy,<br/>etc.) or the vocabulary of interval classes (seconds, thirds, etc.)<br/>or the morphology of scales (e.g. tetrachords)?</p><p>&gt;Sadly, despite the powerful metaphor of the &quot;global village,&quot; the<br/>&gt;Internet and at least many of its music forums still seek truly global<br/>&gt;representativeness as a goal rather than an accomplished or even<br/>&gt;approximate reality.</p><p>I agree.
