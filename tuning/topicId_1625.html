(I&apos;m sure your right!) Then again what<br/>&gt; is played on it. The traditional repertoire wouldn&apos;t work.

The Creation of the Worlds which you have a copy of shows the<br/>possibly of continuously modulating to the point where there is no tonal center.<br/>or the center is everywhere. Besides this to modulate to a set of keys that are<br/>not the ideal (which is true in all cases of et) the new key can create a feeling<br/>of a need to resolve. The whole idea that some keys are more restful and others<br/>more brilliant  are musically useful. The work of Boomliter and Creel I have to<br/>admit would say that this tension exist even if you truly modulate and I have to<br/>agree , but I find to modulate in the way I describe musically interesting and<br/>useful. I refuse to be pent in to any tuning in the sense If I hear something I<br/>will do it. The eikosany is Ideal for modulation and (serialist take note) is the<br/>perfect for atonal or better said uncentered music. Modulation I feel is the one<br/>thing that the west has to offer.
