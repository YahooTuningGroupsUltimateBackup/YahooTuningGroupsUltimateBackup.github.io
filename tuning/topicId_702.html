This is off the record. My comments are my own<br/>and have nothing to do with the MELA Foundation.</p><p>Conrad seems more interested in anarchy and noise than JI.<br/>Sometimes (if not all the time!) when he performs, he runs<br/>his instrument through effect boxes like distortion and<br/>a ring modulator and it obscures the JI intent.<br/>Maybe even his bowing technique is nasty too! Very harsh,<br/>this creates overtones that obscures the tuning.</p><p>So I hear moments of *in tune*. Not the approach and<br/>devotion to purity that he rambles on about.</p><p>La Monte has a grand *Project/Object* vision like Zappa:<br/>his &quot;Theatre of Eternal Music&quot; runs from the begining<br/>of his music to the the end (in LY&apos;s case to the edge of time).</p><p>Conrad has been major league<br/>distracted with film and only dabbled in music while trying to<br/>ride the coat talez of the Early Minimalists.</p><p>If he was really making that kind of music,<br/>there would be more evidence beyond 4 Violins and<br/>the Faust album! The Early Minimalism box just<br/>seems like an afterthought.</p><p>&gt;In fact I would assert that Mr. Conrad is a frustrated Pythagoras<br/>&gt;himself and indie rock elites Gastr del Sol are his curtseying cult!.</p><p>Well there you go! He accuses La Monte of being a Pythagoras<br/>with his cult, when Conrad is exactly that too!</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
