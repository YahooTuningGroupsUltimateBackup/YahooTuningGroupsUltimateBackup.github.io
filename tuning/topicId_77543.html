Those &quot;harmony photos&quot; are important results of the research.<br/>Since all the Piagui triad responses are periodic and aesthetic while the equal tempered ones are disordered and approaching to chaotic &iquest;Don&grave;t you think that these features are enough to conclude that Piagui triad harmonies are better than their corresponding equal tempered triads harmony?.<br/>In my opinion, the fact that some fifths deviate from the classic (3/2) = 1,5 and also some of the thirds do not coincide with the expected (5/4) = 1,25, these Piagui deviations intervene in all kind of Piagui triads to produce aesthetic photos so I think that the aesthetic responses should have a higher primacy than the expected frequency ratios when evaluating the harmony produced by both types of scales.<br/>I am attaching the graphs of D Major and G Major and hope that you receive them because normally graphs and diagrams are not accepted by this link.</p><p>Please advise.</p><p>Regards</p><p>MARIO PIZARRO<br/>Lima, June 21, 2008<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>GRAPH No. 7<br/>TEMPERED CHORD WAVE PEAKS,,,,,D Major = F# + A + 2D</p><p>GRAPH No. 8<br/>PIAGUI I CHORD WAVE PEAKS,,,,D Major = F# + A + 2D</p><p>VIII. 6     CHORD WAVE PEAKS OF G MAJOR  (G + B + 2D)</p><p>TEMPERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,...PIAGUI I</p><p>COMPONENTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,COMPONENTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,DISCREPANCY (%)</p><p>G = 391.9954 (Hz)           G = 392.4383 (Hz)                  + 0.113</p><p>B = 493.8833                  B = 495                                  + 0.226</p><p>2D = 587.3295                 2D = 588.6575                        + 0.226</p><p>TEMPERED CHORD WAVE PEAKS (GRAPH No. 11)</p><p>The non-aesthetic mark distribution shows the imperfection of the tempered G Major.  Three mark waves appear to be superimposed, each one varying in size and shape producing considerable distortion.</p><p>This response is similar to that shown in Graph No. 3.  The frequency chord components give an unequal number of empty areas around the time axis.</p><p>The disorderly display follows the same pattern in all tempered major triads, excepting Tempered D Major where the third tone is 2D to get an aesthetic response with different voicing.</p><p>GRAPH No. 11<br/>TEMPERED CHORD WAVE PEAKS,,,,,,,,,,G Major = G + B + 2D</p><p>PIAGUI I CHORD WAVE PEAKS (GRAPH No. 12)</p><p>Three positive and three negative mark waves give an aesthetic display apparently made by a skilled computer programmer.</p><p>Piagui I - G Major is a perfect triad. With keynote G as 1, the triad components are 1, K3P, K5P2 and consequently, its responses are similar to those of C Major.</p><p>Similar chord wave peaks are given by C# Major, E Major and Bb Major, and so they were not plotted.</p><p>GRAPH No. 12<br/>PIAGUI I CHORD WAVE PEAKS,,,,G Major = G + B + 2D</p><p>G MAJOR = G + (B)d + (2D)d</p><p>TEMPERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PIAGUI I</p><p>COMPONENTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,COMPONENTS,,,,,,,,,,DISCREPANCY (%)</p><p>G = 391.9954 (Hz)           G = 392.4383 (Hz)                  + 0.113</p><p>B = 493.8833                  B = 495                                  + 0.226</p><p>2D = 587.3295                 2D = 588.6575                        + 0.226</p><p>(G Major) Temoered = sin [2 ?

Each sinusoid has no range at t = 0 seconds.  Furthermore, combined sound does not depend on this particular condition and in order to demonstrate that the aesthetic response remains constant regardless of the time delays of the tone components, G Major is plotted with two delayed tones, (B)d and (2D)d. In no case have overtones been considered.</p><p>TEMPERED CHORD WAVE PEAKS (GRAPH No. 15)</p><p>The non-aesthetic view corresponds to disharmony.</p><p>GRAPH No. 15<br/>TEMPERED CHORD WAVE PEAKS,,,,G Major = G + (B)d + (2D)d</p><p>PIAGUI I CHORD WAVE PEAKS (GRAPH No. 16)</p><p>Delays do not affect the magnificent appearance of the Piagui I response.  Looking at the cyclical mark distribution, we conclude that it corresponds to perfect harmony.</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>Graph No. 1 up to No. 34 show chord waves and chord wave peaks of triads whose frequency tones are based on keynotes that lie in the middle octave (261.6255 - 523.2511 Hz).  In all cases, the Tempered responses exhibit non-aesthetic displays, which are signs of disharmony.  In Chapter IX, Graphs Nos. 35 and 36 show Tempered and Piagui I chord wave peak responses respectively.  In these cases, the keynote frequencies of G Major (2G + 2B + 4D) are twice the values contained in the middle octave.  It can be seen that the degree of discordance of the Tempered triad is greater during the same one second of the display period.  As the keynote frequencies go up, the Tempered triad is more discordant.</p><p>     The question is if the mentioned deterioration that we endure at the present time while the new intonation keeps its chord qualities, might increase the interest of composers to use higher keynote frequencies of the Piagui scale.  This way, true harmonious chords would be generated from the upper octaves of the piano keyboard.</p><p>GRAPH No. 16<br/>PIAGUI I CHORD WAVE PEAKS...G Major = G + (B)d + (2D)d</p><p>Regards<br/>MARIO PIZARRO<br/>Lima, June 21, 2008</p></div><h3><a id=77546 href="#77546">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 5:10:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Heya Mario,</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how the second G major chord is periodic, unless 402<br/>cents corresponds to some sort of just interval that I&apos;m not aware of.<br/>Either way, the thing that you&apos;re not taking note of here is this:</p><p>I took a picture myself:</p><p><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/dt0q2yrcwk">http://www.box.net/shared/dt0q2yrcwk</a></p><p>The top is the Piagui I C major chord, and the bottom is the 12-tet C<br/>major chord.
