I believe if the average music listener heard a brass<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;choir play in 12tet, they would say they were out of tune.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t think so.  They may notice something was wrong, but I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; &gt;they&apos;d realise it was the tuning.</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gentlemen, such sweeping statements.  Who is this average music listener?<br/>&gt; Last week I had the pleasure of hearing the American Brass Quartet in a<br/>&gt; very intimate setting.  This is arguably the world&apos;s best quintet, and<br/>&gt; their intonation is astounding -- in everything from early music to the<br/>&gt; latest Sampson quintet featuring &quot;cloud&quot;-like tone clusters.  Everyone in<br/>&gt; my party commented on the intonation, as did another fellow I happened to<br/>&gt; overhear afterwards.</p><p>And what do you think they (the listeners, average or not) were basing their<br/>judgment of intonation on?  I&apos;ll bet it was the beatlessness of consonant<br/>chords.  Ergo, if the Quartet (all five of them?) used 12tet tuning, these<br/>listeners would not have been so &quot;astounded&quot;.</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p><p>____________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a href="http://webmail.netscape.com">http://webmail.netscape.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=7121 href="#7121">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/1999 8:28:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Fred Reinagel wrote...]<br/>&gt;And what do you think they (the listeners, average or not) were basing their<br/>&gt;judgment of intonation on?

They are the American Brass Quintet, two<br/>trumpets, horn, trombone, and bass trombone.</p><p>Yes, I do believe it is the beatless &quot;ring&quot; that people notice.  If the<br/>quintet could somehow learn to play in 12tet, the sound would be so rough<br/>by comparison that probably many people would fail to identify them as a<br/>brass group at all upon hearing a recording.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7139 href="#7139">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

A very slow beating ensures<br/>that all phases will rotate through all their allowed values and the<br/>intended harmonic constitution of the instruments will be well-represented.</p><p>That said, I think good classical brass ensembles often do a very good job<br/>of keeping their simultaneities within a few cents of JI.</p></div>
