Though it&apos;s not explicitly stated, I suspect that many<br/>&gt;or all who had problems were trying to play the file directly from the<br/>&gt;web.  I recommend downloading the file instead, and playing it offline.<br/>&gt;The file should come down as 975 bytes; it&apos;s about 33 seconds long.  All<br/>&gt;three voices come through clearly when played with, say, Media Player.</p><p>I did download it (that was the only way it would play at all), and it came<br/>up as a 21-second file, with only the first two of the three instruments<br/>Monz mentioned.</p></div>
