I figured this out as 2/1 over 11/8 = 16/11, a terrible tritone-ish fifth-like interval.  And since you have an octave-based scale, having a 11/8 would mean also having a 16/11.  So be glad you didn&apos;t get that interval. :-)</p><p>   Missing 11/6 and hitting 13/7 twice though, I feel is a mistake because I feel 11/6 is easily the superior 7th interval (though the 9/5 interval you ran into isn&apos;t bad either and I&apos;d even say 18/11 is pretty good as a 7th).<br/>.....<br/>  Note 2/1 over 13/7 = about 14/13...which seems too close to the maximum critical band dissonance point around 17/16 to my ears.  That&apos;s the real thing I keep running into with your scales...there are few real obvious neutral second options...and thus many of your semi-tones that result from your &quot;stretched 7ths&quot; become too close to be used in many chords (minus things like inverted 7th chords).</p><p>  I realize getting the 11/6 and often the 9/5 requires the use of neutral seconds (that&apos;s how my latest scales get the 11/6)...but this comes back to my point about 12+ tone somewhat equally spaced tunings being somewhat unrealistic.  And, again, I keep on thinking 7-9 tones or so would enable much better dyadic ratios.</p><p>   For an example of neutral second chords, look at the attached mp3.  If that doesn&apos;t change you mind on whether neutral seconds can be at least semi-consonant I don&apos;t know what can. :-)<br/>****************<br/>   I think that&apos;s the most major downside to your tuning...though it has a few new good intervals it by and large stays on the same &quot;mean-tone&quot; type constructs that ultimately help form 12TET.  So it&apos;s purity is good but it&apos;s new-ness...maybe not so much.<br/>****************</p><p>   Meanwhile the good news...you hit the more exotic 9/7 and 11/7 ratios very well and managed to hit 5/3 instead of 12TET&apos;s 37/22-ish interval for the 6th (5/3 sounds significantly better IMVHO...it&apos;s almost as if 12TET sounds 15 cents or so off).</p><p>  I&apos;ll also take a shot at composing with your new scale as well when I get the time.</p></div><h3><a id=89331 href="#89331">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2010 10:42:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Some questions:<br/>  1) If those are your good intervals...what to your &quot;bad&quot; intervals look like and what notes are they formed between?<br/>  2) How come you are still using 9/8 instead of the 10/9 swap I suggested to straighten out your sour 5th?

Hence you can&apos;t have the good without the bad...in that case and many others.  Same goes in that if you have 15/8 (even if you did like it), you also get 16/15 by virtue of the octave period (2/1 over 15/8...the &quot;octave inversion&quot;).  So again, before you consider an interval &quot;good&quot;, I&apos;d highly recommend checking what the above mentioned &quot;octave inversion&quot; is.

If you forget about trying to make the tuning a wind-chime tuning and accept that different intervals are going to be used in different ways in different contexts, you can greatly enrichen this scale by doing things like dropping a 22/21 above the 1/1 and the 3/2 (like a Db and an Ab, at 22/21 and 11/7, but your &quot;Db&quot; is 8/7 above your &quot;Bb&quot;, trippy but sweet).</p><p>Then you&apos;ll have a strong and lovely alternative to a leading tone, tonicizing Do or Sol. Like this: 1/1, 11/12 (the 11/6 below the 1/1), 22/21, 1/1. C, Bb, Db, C. Kind of wraps around the tonic rather than simply rising to it.</p><p>The 11/7 will work this way tonicizing/emphasizing Sol, you can add a 33/28 to the scale, very nice dark minor third, to get the same action on your 11/10 &quot;re&quot;, and so on and so forth.</p><p>This kind of wrap-around is common in modal musics, but it sounds great and it works, and it will let you anchor things at those times you wish them to be anchored, without a leading tone or V-I. You&apos;ve got to have compositional tools that aren&apos;t specific to 12-tET or meantone or major/minor triadic thinking, otherwise you&apos;ll always be falling into wonky and wobbly sounding tunes, or be limited to a few crude sequences, with these xenharmonic tunings.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=89352 href="#89352">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2010 8:51:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John&gt;&quot;when building a scale I consider all intervals less than an octave wide<br/>that occur over a *TWO* octave range (1/1 to 4/1) so I think this<br/>covers all octave inversions, am I right?&quot;<br/>  Yes.  However doing that check in limiting your original set of desirable intervals saves you the hassle of checking the 2 over (original interval) dyads for ANY scale you use which uses that dyad list.  Think of it as writing a re-usable function instead of redundant code in a computer program.</p></div><h3><a id=89353 href="#89353">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2010 8:51:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve thought about it and I think that, using my approach, I don&apos;t need<br/>to consider octave inversions when I&apos;m working out a scale.&quot;<br/>  Well, doing so would likely cut the number of bad intervals possible almost in half...considering that for every interval there is another interval equal to 2 over that interval.  Like it or not, every time you have an 11/8, you also have a 16/11 between the top of the 11/8 dyad and an octave over the root tone of the 11/8.  This is perhaps the main reason the newer versions of the Infinity scale are different than the old ones, the other being the use of alternative 5ths to gain a higher percentage of 5ths that are &quot;within 10 cents of perfect intervals&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;which starting notes do those bad intervals occur on?&quot; That would take some time to figure out.&quot;<br/>  Right, but if you worked out that info gave me it I could easily use if to help you optimize the scale.</p></div>
