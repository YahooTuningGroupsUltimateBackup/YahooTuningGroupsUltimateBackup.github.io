Well, I was just agreeing with you that the difference is<br/>&gt; quite small. With all due respect, that was your statement; not mine,<br/>&gt; Johnny. My language, namely the word &quot;improves&quot;, only meant to refer<br/>&gt; to the incontrovertible fact that it tunes them closer to the pure JI<br/>&gt; interval, but only marginally so as you pointed out yourself in the<br/>&gt; post to which I was responding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Bob,</p><p>I&apos;m sorry if I tweaked you a tad.  I did use the ; )  icon to show tongue in<br/>cheek.
