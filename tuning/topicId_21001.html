If<br/>you even attempt to do, it will not make any sense, except, perhaps,<br/>by way of tolerant and mild amusement, to anyone who has not had such<br/>experience himself.  But, if your audience DID have such experience,<br/>he will not only follow what is going on, but also realize that he is<br/>on the right track himself.</p><p>The Indian Rishi-s wrote millions of verses to tell us about their<br/>realization of Self, and God, only, after all that, to exclaim &quot;neti,<br/>neti&quot; [not this, not this] to warn us about what Self is NOT.</p><p>Perhaps that may be the only way to describe music, too.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=21150 href="#21150">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2001 12:37:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21001.html#21070">/tuning/topicId_21001.html#21070</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Monz,  How can you describe any creative, ecstatic experience?<br/>&gt; If you even attempt to do, it will not make any sense, except,<br/>&gt; perhaps,  by way of tolerant and mild amusement, to anyone who<br/>&gt; has not had such experience himself.
