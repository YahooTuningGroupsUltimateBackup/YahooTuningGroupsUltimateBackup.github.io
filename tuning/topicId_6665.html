A &quot;well tempered&quot; keyboard in<br/>1722 would very likely have had a Werckmiester-based tuning, so lets just<br/>start from there.<br/>   The C#-F (which is really just an E#) in any plausible tuning of that time<br/>is going to be 19 to 21 cents wide.  The C-E 3rd is going to be anywhere from<br/>O  to 5 cents wide.  These two widths of thirds are extremes and they produce<br/>a very different sounding interval, how could they not have been<br/>compositional factors for Bach?<br/>      I had suggested before, and will again, play the C and C# preludes on a<br/>well tempered keyboard, and then transpose them to each others key.  The<br/>musical effect of the tempering is unmistakable.  The C prelude doesn&apos;t work<br/>with a lot of tempering happening in the harmony, and the C# just kinda lays<br/>there in a key with tranquil thirds.<br/>      It could go without saying, but I won&apos;t let it, that ET frees the<br/>listener from such complexity.  However,  I am going to continue believing<br/>the evidence that centers on Kirnberger&apos;s statements, that Bach did not<br/>approve of ET.  The written record seems to support that, logic (at least<br/>mine), supports it, and the music has, so far, clearly had more impact in a<br/>non-equal tuning.  Harpsichordists and pianofortists have known this for a<br/>long time,  pianists are just getting started.<br/>     (I am not sure that an electronic keyboard, with its built in<br/>temperament stuff,  is going to produce the same amount of<br/>tempering-dependant &quot;color&quot; as an acoustic piano, so in that respect, I am<br/>speaking from a somewhat limited perspective)<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/6/1999 8:03:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To help give some eyewitness acounts to the fore I though I&apos;d post some<br/>Kirnberger and Werckmeister quotes from my Bach&apos;s Tuning essay (PITCH I:2)</p><p>Kirnberger disdained 12TET and he is quite clear about it.  &quot;First, it is<br/>impossible to tune without a monochord, or something similar.  With the bare<br/>ear consonant intervals may be tuned perfectly, but dissonant ones cannot be<br/>determined exactly.</p><p>&quot;Secondly, the diversity of the tones is reduced by equal temperament.<br/>Unfortunately only two types remain, for on the one hand, all major modes<br/>and, on the other, all minor modes are completely alike.<br/>&quot;Therefore, through the twenty-four scales one has not really gained<br/>anything, but has lost a great deal.<br/>&quot;Equal temperament narrows the field, and merely offers the composer the<br/>choice between the major and minor mode.&quot;</p><p>Kirnberger&apos;s contemporary, Berlin theorist Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg wrote in<br/>his &quot;Versuch uber die musikalische Temperatur that:  &quot;Mr. Kirnberger himself<br/>has more than once told me as well as others about how the famous J. S. Bach,<br/>during the time when the former was enjoying musical instruction at his<br/>hands, confided to him the tuning of his clavier, and how the master<br/>expressly required of him that he &apos;tune all the major thirds sharp.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Andreas Werckmeister wrote in his &quot;Hypomnemata musica&quot; of 1697 - when Bach<br/>was  12 years old - that he didn&apos;t care for 12TET:  &quot;So far I have not been<br/>able to agree with this view, because I prefer to keep the diatonic notes<br/>which are used most often with the diatonic tonalities, as pure as possible<br/>in tuning.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1999 8:37:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Do you have any documentary support for your disbelief?
