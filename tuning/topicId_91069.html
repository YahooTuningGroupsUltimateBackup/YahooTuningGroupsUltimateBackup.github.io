But on a more personal note, I used to get home from school, pick up my guitar and books and study and practice till sometimes all hours of the night. Every other hour I was painting or composing. The implication that all this hard work by me and other (proper) musicians is just some form of &apos;jihad&apos;, or that we&apos;ve all been conned because we took the 12 tet system for granted, reeks of missionary zeal. Sure, most of the music out there is crap. But the source of this is the inevitable mass-ignorance created by hyper-capitalism and fake-advertising, of a system which rewards laziness under &apos;human rights&apos; and the banner of &apos;hard work&apos;, not musicians with integrity just doing their thing. *This* is why the west is so down on itself and its own traditions. It knows it has no integrity and therefore no inner strength to fall back on (do you think that terrorism would have worked against the Romans?). But it&apos;s throwing the baby out with the bathwater. If we spoke of other cultures like we do about ourselves we would be called racist. In any case, if the 12 system was so out of tune it could never have taken hold in the first place. It&apos;s one solution to the problem of ET, one that takes advantage of another great western tradition, irrationals. Now how else is a person with my background to approach the topic of alternate tunings but to take what I know and move outwards from there?

Trying to retune these using whole-numbers is not impossible by any means so long as one distinguishes between tonal and passing intervals and noting where they appear in a composition.</p></div><h3><a id=91158 href="#91158">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2010 7:06:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Most or all of them are magic chords, which again, Paul argued<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are more consonant than any just tuning thereof.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, if you adopt the theory that you need to get within<br/>&gt; &gt; seven cents or so for it to count, they aren&apos;t magic chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What theory is that?</p><p>The &quot;theory&quot; is more an observation, that if you don&apos;t get within 7 cents you&apos;ve got a pretty piss-poor approximation for musical purposes.</p><p> sqrt(2) clearly functions as a 7/5 in<br/>&gt; the dominant 7th chord in 12-ET.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t say &quot;clearly&quot;, because the 7 in the dom7 in 12et is not completely clear.

The &quot;nearly equal&quot; version has a stack of 6/5s adding up to 12/7, and I think that sounds better. It&apos;s certainly in better tune by the numbers.

Distribute 62.6 cents four ways and you are in crap city, the same somewhat dubious minor third we all enjoy in 12et, and tritones even worse.</p><p> There aren&apos;t JI equivalents in that range.  In many<br/>&gt; cases the perfectly equal version is slightly less than<br/>&gt; optimal -- you yourself provided planar tunings for some of<br/>&gt; these, once upona.</p><p>Wake up and smell the coffee!

It<br/>determines which dyads, triads, etc. you are nearest to and thus what the<br/>program tries to &quot;round&quot; you chord to.

One of my favourite V7 chords in a ballad is the 7(#9)-&gt; 7(b9) voiced so that the #9 (aka &apos;minor third&apos;) and major third are semitones apart eg G-F-A#-B to G-F-Ab-B to Cmaj7.

It&apos;s just that sometimes I have to use the term for the entire theory of VP. When I spoke to Bill he said &quot;If you can A) prove this for Fourier series in general and B) show how it relates to harmonic entropy, then I think that you&apos;ll have a legitimate alternative to virtual pitch&quot;. I mentioned nothing of VP. I then showed him how both of these could be done and he agreed. He also immediately recognised the difference between his own harmonic stretching and this. Whereas his changes the condition of the waves, mine takes them as is and pulls them apart. They are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Also, you shouldn&apos;t put words in my mouth. I did not say &quot;I have singlehandedly disproven virtual pitch&quot; at all. What I said was &quot;bring into serious doubt the cherished theory of virtual pitch&quot;. What I have in mind is the fact that a scientific theory is never proved &apos;true&apos; (Hume, Popper). It only ever remains unfalsified up to a given point in time. And according to Popper, highly falsifiable/testible theories are usually those ones that seem the most &apos;bold and unbelievable&apos;. For eg, if we say &quot;It&apos;s going to rain sometime in the future&quot; this is untestable because it gives no time or space limit. Everyone will believe it. Yet if we say &quot;It&apos;s going to rain at such and such a time and exactly at this place&quot; then it becomes both highly testable and more unbelievable. So if it does happen to rain then people take notice. Unfortunately, this &apos;boldness&apos; is too often taken for arrogance or even madness and is why good theories are often ignored for many years (Evolution and Fourier series are two that comes to mind). Really, I&apos;m just finishing up an idea that started in the late 90&apos;s and I haven&apos;t been able to formulize until now.</p><p>Therefore when you say &quot;LOL I wasn&apos;t aware that when something is published, it becomes an undeniable fact&quot; you&apos;re right because there is no such thing. And I don&apos;t have to point out that this runs both ways to Fourier transforms, VP, wavelets, convolution etc...I&apos;ll also say again that what worried me about VP theory is that I couldn&apos;t think of how it could possibly be falsified, hence my statement &quot;relegated musical harmony to everything we *don&apos;t* understand about the brain&quot;. &quot;Why do we hear this note? Oh its just the VP&quot;. They thought they had applied Occam&apos;s razor and eliminated all possible wave theoretical explanations for this phenomena. But they hadn&apos;t.</p><p>It&apos;s much harder finding something new than learning what&apos;s already been done because we have to go through all the complicated maths with no guarantee at the end.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=91205 href="#91205">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2010 10:31:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, if I remember correctly, didn&apos;t your model basically crap out<br/>&gt; for 10 steps out of 12?

The 5/4 for eg will occur much more often than the 19/15&apos;s (of which there are more than one, all with different ~ GCD&apos;s). This is because it&apos;s p/q is small and its ~ GCD is significantly *larger* in comparison to the component frequencies. It will therefore have a higher frequency of occurrence (We can see this quickly by just dividing the component freq&apos;s by p and q which puts us in the general area. 81/64 for eg, 81/5 ~ 64/4 ~ 16. 81/19 ~ 64/15 ~ 4 and already we&apos;re a long way below).</p><p>I posted some graphic examples which explains it better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Jul 19, 2010 at 11:49 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; On Mon, Jul 19, 2010 at 6:38 AM, rick &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On Sat, Jul 17, 2010 at 11:34 AM, rick &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think that conducting experiments in a laboratory is how one learns or understands music, by collecting data?

It is not simply an algorithm nor is there anything random about it. It&apos;s more a form of analysis which &apos;reveals&apos; the harmonic content that is already there. This is distinct from, but not mutually exclusive with, all the waveforms you mention above. The difference between continued fractions and wave convergents is that the former *are* just methods for finding rational approximations, but the latter are physically present in the wave as envelopes. I suspected something was going on with the GCD&apos;s but was just as surprised as anyone to find these. They were &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot; as the saying goes. Now there exist a new class of external phenomena that must be factored into any calculation, perception of pitch being just one of them. Even in the simplest case of the dyad there&apos;s a whole new world of possibilities. What occurs when we apply these to more complex waveforms like the ones you mention above? I&apos;d be interested to see how it applies to stretched 8ves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&quot;It is the theory that determines what is to be observed&quot; Einstein</p><p>The connection between the outside world and sensory experience is far more problematic than you make out here. We often see what we expect (want) to see and go about &apos;proving&apos; it after the fact. (Hegel says that mathematicians are the worst for doing this). Admit the possibility that you *already* have in mind that the brain is some type of algorithm calculator. And you know many possible examples, mine becoming just one of them. But this very idea itself came from VP (which is a theory despite what you say). It might now be that we just hear the frequency directly, taken in this broader sense of the word. Or it might not.

So you transpose it by<br/>1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and so on, and add all the results together.  The<br/>virtual pitch should then be the strongest sine wave, from Fourier<br/>analysis, or however else you find it.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=91219 href="#91219">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2010 11:33:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;There have been hundreds upon hundreds of books written, dating way back to ancient Greece, which take to task this false idea that there can be any such thing as &apos;pure mathematics&apos;.</p><p>No, there haven&apos;t been. Your credibility suffers because you continually make claims like this, which seem to be pulled out of your nether regions. If you are so unreliable when talking about the history of music or the philosophy of mathematics or all of the myriad other subjects you know little about but choose to lecture the rest of us on anyway, it casts doubt on everything you say.</p><p>&gt; The connection between the outside world and sensory experience is far more problematic than you make out here.
