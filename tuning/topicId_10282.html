Manuel Op. de Coul was<br/>remarking that the 19 tone scale derived from 1/4 comma meantone<br/>shouldn&apos;t sound much different from the 19 tone scale derived from<br/>31-tET since, after all, 31-tET is circulating 1/4 comma meantone, and<br/>the pitches of both scales are very similar.</p><p>However, it really DOES sound different (I think!), with the 1/4 comma<br/>meantone example seeming to beat MUCH less...  Could it be the<br/>particular frequencies of the example???</p><p>____________ ______ _____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
