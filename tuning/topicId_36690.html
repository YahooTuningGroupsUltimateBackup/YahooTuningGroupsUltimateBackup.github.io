Gilmore International Keyboard Festival:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1:30 pm, Thursday, May 2, 2002 - Little Theatre<br/>&gt;Western Michigan University - Kalamazoo, Michigan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Groven Piano is a revolutionary performing instrument merging<br/>&gt;acoustic pianos with digital technology to free the piano from the<br/>&gt;constraints of the keyboard.  Developed in Norway by WMU music professor<br/>&gt;David Loberg Code, the Groven Piano is comprised of four specially-tuned<br/>&gt;Yamaha Disklavier pianos networked together on-stage.  A computer<br/>&gt;program synchronizes them in real-time to provide acoustically pure<br/>&gt;harmonies and exotic scales.  The result is similar to the more subtle<br/>&gt;nuances of pitch experienced by a string quartet or an a cappella vocal<br/>&gt;ensemble.  The Gilmore premiere is free and open to the public.  It will<br/>&gt;include a lecture by Dr. Code and performances by WMU faculty and guest<br/>&gt;artists featuring a wide variety of classical, folk, and jazz<br/>&gt;repertoire.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;More information (including pictures and soundfiles) is available at the<br/>&gt;Groven Piano website:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/groven">http://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/groven</a><br/>&gt;</p><br/>

The<br/>experience of hearing justly tuned acoustic piano even with glitches<br/>is worth something, I would venture. It at least offers a taste of<br/>freedom for those ears who have never before had any feel for what it<br/>might be like to live outside the 12-tET prison.</p></div>
