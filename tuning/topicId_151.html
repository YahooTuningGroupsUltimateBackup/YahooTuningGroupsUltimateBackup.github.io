I think I might also post it at my web site.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p></div><h3><a id=17287 href="#17287">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/8/2001 7:38:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There are many levels to Harry Partch, perhaps some of them are negative,<br/>most show stark originality and a specific point of view.  Dissimilar to<br/>Daniel Wolf, I have a different set of Partch favorites.</p><p>Some see Partch for the just intonation harmony, while I see more of the<br/>American English intonation of meaning as more spectacular.  I would consider<br/>&quot;U.S. Highball&quot; as both a Partch and an American classic, if not a 20th<br/>century masterpiece.  &quot;Dark Brother&quot; is by no means a failure.  More failing,<br/>for me, is &quot;Lord is My Shepherd,&quot; while I never fully enjoyed &quot;Bewitched.&quot;</p><p>Yes, the music can sound dated since Partch was an Elvis man, pre-Beatles.<br/>And he had a tough personality to bear (some would say as well as for Bach<br/>and Beethoven), but he was a good person who pioneered much of what music has<br/>become.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=17288 href="#17288">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

If you<br/>like Zappa, you should begin to like some Partch after a few good listens<br/>spread over at least a week -- you need repeated exposures to break down<br/>your mental barriers to the highly unusual tuning, but you&apos;ll already be<br/>somewhat accustomed to the odd rhythms and textures from Zappa.</p></div>
