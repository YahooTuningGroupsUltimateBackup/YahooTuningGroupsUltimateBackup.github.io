What is this Paigui? How has its scale come to<br/>resemble the quotidian Western tone-system so much in a year? Does it<br/>deserve to be dubbed this way anymore since it is practically none<br/>other than the 12-tone scale of Western music?</p><p>I believe this topic is going nowhere in particular, contributes<br/>nothing refreshingly new to tuning list and should be checked by the<br/>moderators.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Aug 20, 2009, at 2:07 AM, Mario Pizarro wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear friends,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some time ago, distinguished members of the tuning list stated that<br/>&gt; chords formed by scale tones  whose components have only 2 or 3<br/>&gt; cents or about 2 cents, do not show any difference in sound<br/>&gt; regarding their corresponding e-tempered chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The most favorable opinion was that it is a difficult job to detect<br/>&gt; any difference.
