I love your book, &quot;Lies My Music<br/>Teacher Told Me&quot;; I like your writing style.  (I&apos;m not much of a &quot;reader&quot;,<br/>so if a book is able to keep my attention, it must have something going for<br/>it, in my humble opinion...)</p><p>At 05:17 PM 5/7/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;... I can&apos;t seem to find what you mean by &quot;seven limit.&quot; In what sense<br/>&gt;did I give the impression in my book &quot;Lies&quot; that I &quot;use it&quot;?</p><p>Okay, I dug up your book, and found that you do not refer to your tuning by<br/>the name &quot;seven limit&quot;.  I&apos;m using the term &quot;limit&quot; in the following sense<br/>(quoting my own web page at &lt;<a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint</a>&gt;):</p><p>  &quot;The 5-Limit Just Intonation tuning system is confined to<br/>   ratios of integers which are products of 2, 3, and 5 (prime<br/>   numbers up to 5).  Increasing the limit to 7 would include<br/>   the 7th harmonic, which sounds flat to Western ears.&quot;</p><p>Another definition of limit may be found at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/limit.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/limit.htm</a>&gt;.  Our hero Helmholtz&apos; book<br/>&quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot; refers to 7-limit as &quot;septimal&quot; harmony, and<br/>5-limit as &quot;tertian&quot; harmony (due to pure major third intervals).  (See<br/>&quot;septimal&quot; in his index.)</p><p>In your chapter entitled &quot;Lie #7:  Key Name is First Step&quot;, on p.76 (first<br/>printing), you tune a V7 chord as 4:5:6:7.  When you refer to singers&apos; notes<br/>&quot;locking in&quot;, I imagine you&apos;re referring to this tuning of a V7.  And<br/>elsewhere in your book you consider even higher limits, such as the 11th and<br/>13th partials.</p><p>&gt;I am convinced that a simple major triad is not tuned (by even amateur<br/>&gt;singers) as 4:5:6. I have observed that when C is sounded and sung by basses<br/>&gt;and women are asked to sing E they tune it somewhat below tempered E,<br/>&gt;probably 4:5. When tenors join the basses C with a well-tuned G (presumably<br/>&gt;a 2:3 ratio), the women (without coaching) tune their E above tempered<br/>&gt;pitch. This &quot;experiment&quot; never fails. Your comments, please.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty puzzling.  I don&apos;t have an explanation for that phenomenon.<br/>But it reminds me of something I recently heard about string players.<br/>Supposedly they sometimes play a little sharp so they can hear themselves<br/>apart from the rest of the section.  I guess trombonists like myself don&apos;t<br/>have that problem, since our whole head is pretty much rattling to whatever<br/>note we&apos;re playing.</p><p>&gt;Regarding the tendency of the dom7 chord to resolve, I believe it has much<br/>&gt;to do with the acoustic (by ear) tuning of the tritone (5:7 and 7:10). While<br/>&gt;the tempered tritone (thus the term) can by heard enharmonically in two<br/>&gt;keys, the well-tuned tritone is clearly in one or the other. In other words,<br/>&gt;B-F clearly pulls to the key of C (major and/or minor), while B-E# clearly<br/>&gt;pulls to the key of F# (major and/or minor). The augmented fourth is<br/>&gt;significantly larger than the diminished fifth. The two &quot;versions&quot; can be<br/>&gt;&quot;tuned&quot; by ear as clearly as any other small-ratio combination. (The more<br/>&gt;experience, the better, naturally.) Comments?</p><p>I agree that the diminished fifth (B-F) should be tuned differently than the<br/>tritone (B-E#).  In my obsession to keep things in 5-limit just intonation,<br/>though, I&apos;d tune B-F as 45:64, and B-E# as 32:45.</p><p>          equal      7-limit         5-limit<br/>          temp.   (your tuning)    (my tuning)<br/>          -----   -------------   -------------<br/>  B-F     1.414   5:7  = 1.4      45:64 = 1.422<br/>  B-E#    1.414   7:10 = 1.429    32:45 = 1.406</p><p>So that&apos;s pretty wild - you and I both advocate two flavors of the interval,<br/>but my B-F is the wider one, whereas your B-E# is your wide one.  I&apos;ll have<br/>to look into that!  (The rationale for my tuning goes &quot;a little something<br/>like this&quot;:  In B-F, I tune both notes a perfect fourth away from notes in<br/>the resolution chord:  B is 3/4 of E, and F is 4/3 of C.)</p><p>I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll have replies to the rest of your email, but for now I better<br/>get some sleep!  I love the topic of musical tunings, and I really<br/>appreciate your input on it.  Thanks again,</p><p>--Mark</p><p>P.S.:  I live in Glendale, so I&apos;m right in your area.  As a matter of fact,<br/>I&apos;m gonna attend the &quot;Microfest&quot; concert at Pierce College Sunday (5/9/99)<br/>at 7pm.  You&apos;re probably already aware of the concert - they use all sorts<br/>of so-called &quot;microtonal&quot; tunings.  Among others, I believe your fellow<br/>faculty member John Schneider will be playing guitar.  You oughta go to it!</p><p>P.P.S.:  You wrote:<br/>&gt; If you have the time and interest, my web site is<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/</a>&gt;</p><p>Been there - that&apos;s where I found your email address...</p><p>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+</p></div>
