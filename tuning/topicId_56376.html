Parallel line in the key below will coincide with the intervals in most of the full eikosany lattices ( there are a few exceptions)<br/>If one is a factor in every other note , it sounds like you are referring to the centered Pentagon lattice. One could place any factor in the middle, say 7 and then every other tone would include 7. using the factor 1 is what separates Erv&apos;s work from Eulers, who would use one as a start but not as a product in a full set. It prevented Euler from discovering the hexany. If one preserves the notation ofthe three factors it is much easier to move around the structure and to pick out all the cross relations.<br/>I recommend reading the letter to John Chalmers on this subject</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;OTOH, I do notice a certain pattern in the rotational symmetry of the &apos;star&apos; &gt;figure, where for instance, the &apos;1&apos; factor occurs as every other vertex on &gt;the outside, etc. But that seems arbitrary. And wouldn&apos;t it be better to do &gt;this diagram with the actual resultant ratios listed, and not the generating &gt;factors, so that we might intuit the pentachords which are formed as a result &gt;of the process?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Kraig? Carl? Monz? Gene? Paul, if you are lurking? Othere experts on Wilson &gt;out there lurking, who I have neglected to mention?<br/>&gt; &gt;-A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=56380 href="#56380">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
