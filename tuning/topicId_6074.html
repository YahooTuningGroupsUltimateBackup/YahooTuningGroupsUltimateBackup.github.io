What was fascinating was<br/>that it had a clear 6/5 minor third for its minor scale.  It was a JI tuning<br/>in both our estimations, quite contrary to the later Babylonian Pythagorean<br/>tuning basis.</p><p>The Greek connection is wild.  Not only is the Aulos common to both (though<br/>the Sumerian version is softer), there seems to be a common aesthetic based<br/>on the admittedly curious example between the Ancient Greek predilection for<br/>small ratio JI and the Sumerians.</p><p>If the Sumerians are Turks, as Turks believe, this would be an interesting<br/>objection since the Turks use extended Pythagorean and are likely to have<br/>used it for millenia.<br/>No one can be certain from where the Sumerians originally lived before<br/>arriving among the Hurrians in southern Mesopotamia.</p><p>The Hurrians have their descendants in Georgians, Chechens, and Kurds...maybe<br/>even the On Ogur Hungarians.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
