Information 212-925-8270<br/>MELA Foundation<br/>275 Church Street, 3rd Floor<br/>between Franklin &amp; White Streets in Tribeca<br/><a href="http://www.melafoundation.org">www.melafoundation.org</a></p><p>Dream House: Seven+Eight Years of Sound and Light, a<br/>collaborative Sound and Light Environment by composer<br/>La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela, is<br/>presented in an extended exhibition at MELA Foundation,<br/>275 Church Street, 3rd Floor.  The environment is open<br/>Thursdays and Saturdays from 2:00 PM to Midnight.<br/>Suggested contribution is $4.00.  The long-term exhibition<br/>opened in Fall 1993 and continues for its tenth season<br/>through June 21, 2003.   The Dream House is scheduled to<br/>reopen September 20 for the 2003-2004 season.</p><p> Young and Zazeela characterize the Sound and Light<br/>Environment as &quot;a time installation measured by a setting<br/>of continuous frequencies in sound and light.&quot;  In the light<br/>environment Marian Zazeela presents four works, two environmental:</p><p>Imagic Light and Magenta Day, Magenta Night, in installations<br/>specifically designed for the site; and two sculptural:  a neon<br/>work, Dream House Variation I, and a wall sculpture, Ruine<br/>Window 1992 from her series, Still Light.  In the environment<br/>Imagic Light, Zazeela projects pairs of colored lights on mobile<br/>forms to create seemingly three-dimensional colored shadows<br/>in a luminous field.</p><p>In the concurrent sound environment, La Monte Young<br/>presents The Base 9:7:4 Symmetry in Prime Time When<br/>Centered above and below The Lowest Term Primes in The<br/>Range 288 to 224 with The Addition of 279 and 261 in Which<br/>The Half of The Symmetric Division Mapped above and<br/>Including 288 Consists of The Powers of 2 Multiplied by<br/>The Primes within The Ranges of 144 to 128, 72 to 64 and 36<br/>to 32 Which Are Symmetrical to Those Primes in Lowest<br/>Terms in The Half of The Symmetric Division Mapped below<br/>and Including 224 within The Ranges 126 to 112, 63 to 56<br/>and 31.5 to 28 with The Addition of 119, a periodic composite<br/>sound waveform environment created from sine wave components<br/>generated digitally in real time on a custom-designed Rayna<br/> interval synthesizer.</p><p>Both artists are presenting works utilizing concepts of<br/>structural symmetry.  Zazeela&apos;s mobile forms are arrayed<br/>in symmetrical patterns with lights placed in precisely<br/>symmetrical positions creating symmetrical colored shadows;<br/>the wall-mounted light sculpture and the neon are both symmetrical<br/>forms.   Young&apos;s sound environment is composed of frequencies<br/>tuned to the harmonic series between 288 and 224, utilizing numbers<br/>with factors of only 9, or those primes or octave transpositions of<br/>smaller primes that fall within this range.  The interval 288/256<br/>reduces to a 9/8 interval as does the interval 252/224.  Thirty-two<br/>frequencies satisfy the above definition, of which seventeen fall<br/>within the range of the upper, and fourteen fall within the range of<br/>the lower of these two symmetrical 9/8 intervals.  Young has<br/>arranged these thirty-one frequencies in a unique constellation,<br/>symmetrical above and below the thirty-second frequency, the<br/>center harmonic 254 (the prime 127 x 2).</p><p>Young has stated that:  &quot;This is my newest and most radical<br/>work; the Rayna synthesizer has made it possible to realize<br/>intervals which are derived from such high primes that, not<br/>only is it unlikely that anyone has ever worked with these intervals<br/>before, it is also highly unlikely that anyone has ever heard them<br/>or perhaps even imagined the feelings they create.&quot;</p><p>In 1966, Young and Zazeela pioneered the concept of the continuous<br/>sound and light environment, and have since presented large-scale<br/>sound and light productions in museums and galleries worldwide<br/>for continuous periods from one week to five years, including<br/>installations in the Metropolitan Museum, New York; Moderna<br/>Museet, Stockholm; documenta 5, Kassel; Kunstverein, Cologne.<br/>Under a long-term commission from the Dia Art Foundation<br/>(1979-85), Zazeela and Young collaborated in a six-year continuous<br/>Dream House presentation set in a six-story building on<br/>Harrison Street in New York City, featuring multiple interrelated<br/>sound and light environments, exhibitions, performances,<br/>research and listening facilities, and archives.  Now in its tenth<br/>year, MELA Foundation&apos;s Dream House: Seven+Eight<br/>Years of Sound and Light, is Young and Zazeela&apos;s longest installation to<br/>date.</p><p>In Minimalism:Origins (Indiana University Press, 1993),<br/>Edward Strickland has written of their collaborative environments:<br/>&quot;Intense light [is] aimed through [colored] filters at quasicalligraphic<br/>aluminum shapes hung by ultrafine filaments.  The effect is a<br/>unique and extraordinary transvaluation of perception: the<br/>mobiles seem to hover unanchored, while the shadows they<br/>cast in various hues attain an apparent solidity against the<br/>light-dissolved walls equal to their literally palpable but<br/>apparently disembodied sources.  Like Young&apos;s music, to<br/>which it serves as an almost uncanny complement, Zazeela&apos;s<br/>work is predicated upon the extended duration necessary to<br/>experience the nuances which are its essence.&quot;</p><p>Their one-year sound and light environment collaboration,<br/>The Romantic Symmetry (over a 60 cycle base) in Prime<br/>Time from 112 to 144 with 119 / Time Light Symmetry (Dia<br/>Art Foundation, 22nd Street, NYC 1989), was described by<br/>Village Voice critic Kyle Gann as &quot;some of the strangest and<br/>most forward-looking art New York has to offer.&quot;   A 1990<br/>Donguy Gallery, Paris, exhibition was purchased by the<br/>French Cultural Ministry National Foundation of Contemporary<br/>Art for permanent installation in a French museum.<br/>Die Tageszeitung wrote about their 1992 DAAD Ruine der<br/>K&iuml;&iquest;&half;nste, Berlin environment:  &quot;A longer stay in the Dream<br/>House is necessary to experience the full effect.  The mind<br/>is calmed by the environment in a meditative way, and subtle<br/>sound and light effects that are veiled at first sight then come<br/>to the fore.&quot;</p><p>Of the current environment, Seven+Eight Years of Sound<br/>and Light, Sandy McCroskey has written in 1/1 that<br/>&quot;...the multifaceted form of the 35-frequency construction<br/>of Young&apos;s current installation is the principal reason it<br/>changes hallucinogenically with every minute shift in<br/>perspective and why the tones freeze in place as long as<br/>one is perfectly still while the slightest gesture will startle<br/>forth unnameable, wildly plumed melodies from the luxuriant<br/>harmonic foliage...  Zazeela&apos;s light sculptures have invariably,<br/>teasingly refused to surrender their entire secret to photographic<br/>reproduction, so much do they depend on the retinal impact of<br/>activated photons in real time and so much do they exploit, in<br/>ways analogous to Young&apos;s techniques, the creation of visual<br/>combination tones and an accumulation of after-images.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.lamonteyoung.com">http://www.lamonteyoung.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=44635 href="#44635">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2003 3:10:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; La Monte Young   Marian Zazeela<br/>&gt; Dream House Sound and Light Environment<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last three open dates this season:<br/>&gt; Saturday, June 14<br/>&gt; Thursday, June 19<br/>&gt; Saturday, June 21<br/>&gt; 2:00 PM to Midnight<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Contribution $4.00.
