One of them is Costeley. Margo, who is the other?</p><p>Honestly, I know only of Costeley -- and of the possible implications<br/>of the 1/3-comma meantone of Salinas (1577), almost identical to<br/>19-tet (either tempering the fifth about as much as 22-tet, but in the<br/>opposite direction) &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>If there is another advocate of 19-tet in the 16th century, maybe<br/>among the French circles in which Costeley moved, I&apos;d be very<br/>interested; certainly there were other French musicians experimenting<br/>with chromaticism of a kind which might lead to experimentation with<br/>such a tuning.</p><p>Vicentino, of course, favors a division of the octave into fifthtones<br/>of _about_ 1/31 octave, and 1/4-comma meantone carried to 31 notes<br/>nicely approximates this model.</p><p>Parenthetically, I might comment that the focus on _precisely_ equal<br/>divisions of the octave might be curious tendency of some modern<br/>theorists and historians. To me, the idea of dividing the octave into<br/>31 _approximately_ equal parts indeed goes back to Vicentino, and that<br/>to place his proposal in a totally separate compartment from the later<br/>history of 31-tet might be a bit artificial.</p><p>Certainly I want to recognize the distinction between 1/4-comma<br/>meantone and precise 31-tet, but I&apos;d like to recognize the<br/>similarities also.</p><p>Thus if I were doing a table, I might head it &quot;equal or near-equal<br/>divisions of the octave,&quot; and list Vicentino (and Colonna in 1618)<br/>under &quot;31-division&quot; with an asterisk (*) leading to a note</p><p>* Realized by extended meantone, likely ~1/4-comma</p><p>This approach notes the kinship of the older pragmatic 31-division<br/>derived from 16th-century common-practice meantone, and mathematically<br/>precise 19-tet as defined by Lemme Rossi (1666) using string lengths<br/>to within about .1 cent, and by Christopher Huyghens in a more<br/>rigorous mathematical fashion.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
