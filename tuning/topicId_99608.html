My<br/>&gt;&gt; feeling with 15-EDO is that even its 7-limit properties don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; give it any audible advantage over 12-TET/Dominant temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt; So if you&apos;re trying to pimp it as Blacksmith (the &quot;uber-simple<br/>&gt;&gt; 7-limit temperament with 5 otonal and 5 utonal tetrads as well<br/>&gt;&gt; as 5 major and 5 minor 7th chords!) that&apos;s a bad idea because<br/>&gt;&gt; it doesn&apos;t sound anything like 7-limit JI and you&apos;re not<br/>&gt;&gt; fooling anybody. The point comes across, sure, but it&apos;s really<br/>&gt;&gt; rough and would probably bother the hell out of most people,<br/>&gt;&gt; so in 15-EDO your best bet is to do as I do and keep the<br/>&gt;&gt; harmony simple. It&apos;s just not very good as a full 7-limit<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree about blacksmith, but not the part about it meaning<br/>&gt; 22 is no good. And, I like 15 for 5-limit harmony when it&apos;s<br/>&gt; done carefully. It&apos;s not as accurate as 12 but I really like<br/>&gt; the blackwood comma pump and the melodic nature of the<br/>&gt; blackwood decatonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
