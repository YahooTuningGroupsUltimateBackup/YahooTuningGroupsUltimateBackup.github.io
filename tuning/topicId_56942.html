The main thing is that a CD burner<br/>can *only* create CDs, but a DVD burner can create both CDs and DVDs.<br/>If you *ever* might need the latter, it makes sense to get the DVD<br/>drive. Whether CDs become obsolete in the near future I can&apos;t say, but<br/>they won&apos;t be around forever. In fact, *no* formats will probably last<br/>more than a few years anymore.

Are CDs becoming obsolete<br/>&gt; &gt;       or is it a storage issue? Both?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl can chime in here if he wants. The main thing is that a CD<br/>burner<br/>&gt; can *only* create CDs, but a DVD burner can create both CDs and<br/>DVDs.<br/>&gt; If you *ever* might need the latter, it makes sense to get the DVD<br/>&gt; drive. Whether CDs become obsolete in the near future I can&apos;t say,<br/>but<br/>&gt; they won&apos;t be around forever. In fact, *no* formats will probably<br/>last<br/>&gt; more than a few years anymore. But, yes, the DVD holds *much* more<br/>&gt; data than a CD, and that is one way in which they are used even if<br/>one<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t burn movies on them. The price difference between the two<br/>&gt; kinds of burner drives isn&apos;t much, so you should probably consider<br/>the<br/>&gt; latter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last thing: if you ARE sure all you want to do is create CDs, the CD<br/>&gt; burner drives will create them a lot faster...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   2) I would like to take a particular sound from my non-MIDI<br/>&gt; &gt;      keyboard (eventually) and use it in the future in my<br/>&gt; &gt;      playing. Do I just need a microphone and some freeware to<br/>&gt; &gt;      sample it? Should I make sure the future system has a<br/>&gt; &gt;      USB port for this, or are we talking about some other type<br/>&gt; &gt;      of electrical connection?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, yes, you *do* have a bit to learn! If your keyboard has audio<br/>line<br/>&gt; outputs (as opposed to just having some built-in speakers or<br/>&gt; something) those would normally be routed to the inputs of an audio<br/>&gt; card, and then an application on the computer could be used to<br/>record<br/>&gt; (and then edit) the music/sound. There are nice applications that<br/>&gt; would do this at no cost.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HTH,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3><a id=57003 href="#57003">ðŸ”—</a>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2005 12:28:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Various computers for sale.
