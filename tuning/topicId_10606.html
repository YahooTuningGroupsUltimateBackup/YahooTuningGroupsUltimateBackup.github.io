But the actual<br/>&gt; ratios still would have been Pythagorean.</p><p>&gt; Of course, I&apos;m also willing to allow that over a (relatively<br/>&gt; short?) period of time, good musicians could have gotten to the<br/>&gt; point where they altered the tuning of those schismatic<br/>&gt; substitutions by ear so that they really *were* 5-limit ratios.</p><p>this is what Amiya Dasgupta stated is the case.

With<br/>&gt; this sound available in their tuning system, I have no problem<br/>&gt; extrapolating the data to reach the assumption that the ancient<br/>&gt; Indian musicians also could have used 7-limit (or Pythagorean<br/>&gt; pseudo-7-limit) ratios in their music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=10615 href="#10615">ðŸ”—</a>Barbara Demetz &#x3C;BARBARAD@CYBERHIGHWAY.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2000 3:01:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>PLEASE!

I would have to say, not really. All<br/>harmony in Indian music is mediated by the drone of 1/1 and 3/2 (or<br/>sometimes 1/1 and 4/3, or the dissonant drone of 1/1 and 15/8), and<br/>none of the chords above includes the drone. Although you may find<br/>one of the drone notes in the any of the chords above, you will not<br/>find both. And it is the drone that implies the harmony. Indian music<br/>does not use free combinations of simultaneous notes -- at any given<br/>time, only one note is sounding that is not part of the drone. So<br/>real 7-limit harmony would require approximations to pitches like<br/>7/6, 7/4, 12/7, 8/7 -- approximations not found even in the complete<br/>sruti system.</p><p>In other words, due to the fixed nature of the harmony in Indian<br/>music, any operative bridges must be affixed at one end to the<br/>central pitch, the drone. Since the Pythagorean chain that forms the<br/>basis of the Indian system only extends 11 steps in either direction<br/>from the center, there are not enough perfect fifths in any operative<br/>harmonic interval for the septimal schisma to play a role in Indian<br/>music as we know it.</p><p>Of course we have no idea what ancient Indian music sounded like, and<br/>the preponderance of 22-tone systems among 7-limit periodicity blocks<br/>is suggestive, but I&apos;ve have to say that there&apos;s no evidence that the<br/>sruti system, as a Pythagorean chain with possible schismatic<br/>substitutions, was ever associated with 7-limit harmony. 5-limit,<br/>almost certainly yes; 7-limit, it doesn&apos;t look that way.</p><p>Nevertheless, the first part of this message shows that a modern<br/>composer using a fixed-pitch 12-tone Indian instrument, such as the<br/>santoor, could exploit four full consonant 7-limit tetrads, if she<br/>chose to drop the drone, or to create polyharmony against the drone.</p></div><h3><a id=10648 href="#10648">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2000 2:06:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>While periodicity can be useful for new music, and may be relevant to older<br/>traditions, it&apos;s not likely to be relevant to contemporary practice in<br/>Hindustani or Karnatik musics.
