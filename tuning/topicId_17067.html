Very high harmonics might beat every few years (or every few<br/>&gt; &gt;centurys). For practical purposes, that is fusing in my book.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert, there would be no beat rate slower than the fundamental frequency<br/>&gt; itself, no matter how high the harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>                                                      -32<br/>Well, I was thinking of fundamentals on the order of 2    hertz. [As<br/>Danny Gatton said about his bassists fifth string &quot;thats a big LOW<br/>note&quot;.] Audible harmonics could have beat rates around a century. I&apos;m<br/>not sure about the commercial potential (or physical realisabilty) of<br/>such music.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
