But, Hariprasad<br/>was not destined to become a singer.  He heard the famous fluitist<br/>Pandit Bholanath, of Varanasi, was captivated, became his pupil.<br/>Hariprasad received further guidance from the famous teacher-Surbahar<br/>player Annapurna Devi, the illustrious daughter of Mahiar gharana<br/>maestro Ustad Allaudin Khan, sister of the Sarod Guru Ali Akbar Khan,<br/>and the &quot;better half&quot; of the legendary Sitarist Pandit Ravi Shankar.<br/>[Surbahar is like a bigger Sitar, tuned one octave lower.  The<br/>quality of its timbre in the very low octave has to be heard to be<br/>believed.] Thus Hariprasad was able to stand on his own merit, even<br/>when the music world was under the influence of the greatest flutist<br/>Pannalal Ghosh.</p><p>Hari-ji, as he is lovingly called [please note, JI stands for love<br/>and respect!], Hariprasad is not only a master of the North Indian<br/>bamboo flute, but also an excellent and painstaking teacher.  He has<br/>done great sevice to the cause of Indian music all over the world,<br/>while pursuing an inspired performing career as a musician.</p><p>Hari-ji has recorded extensively his solo recitals, jugalbandhi-s<br/>(duets) with the Santoor wizard Shiv Kumar Sharma; has also recorded<br/>with artistes like John McLaughlin to Jan Garbarek .  He has composed<br/>music for Indian movies like Silsila.</p><p>For Hari-ji&apos;s comprehensive discography, visit<br/><a href="http://www.chaurasia.com/">http://www.chaurasia.com/</a><br/><a href="http://www.songsearch.net/CATALOG/H/HARIPRASAD_CHAURASIA.HTM">http://www.songsearch.net/CATALOG/H/HARIPRASAD_CHAURASIA.HTM</a></p><p>In passing, I have observed that all instrumentalists -- Hariprasad<br/>(flute), Sultan Khan (Sarangi), Vilayat Khan (Sitar), Annapurna Devi<br/>(Surbahar) -- have always been good singers.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=20543 href="#20543">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2001 10:51:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David Beardsley wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  he&apos;s one of my favorite Hindustani musicans!</p><p>I have a recording of Hariji playing a Malkauns.
