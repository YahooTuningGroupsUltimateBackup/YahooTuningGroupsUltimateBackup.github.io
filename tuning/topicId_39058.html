This astonished<br/>even me.  I thought, on being confronted with scales like 13 and 11<br/>and 23, that I would have mental blocks or would have to skip over<br/>them with an apologetic short piece and hurry on to the next tuning<br/>before the listeners get too annoyed.  And yet they all work!<br/>Absolutely amazed me.&quot;</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
