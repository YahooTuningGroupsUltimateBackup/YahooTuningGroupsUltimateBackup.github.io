Take a look at my new post on<br/>tuning-math and tell me what you think.</p><p>The adaptune program would have to have some way of<br/>determing which &quot;tonic&quot; would be in effect at any<br/>given time; this is a non-trivial problem for this<br/>group of compositions.</p><p>Another example could be my idea of illustrating Sumerian<br/>brick walls as representing 5-limit lattices, as described<br/>in this tuning-math post [Sun Jun 24, 2001  6:32 pm GMT]<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/316">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/316</a>&gt;.</p><p>I believe that the Sumerians were deeply interested in<br/>musical temperaments, and would like to portray this<br/>vividly in a visual representation along with sound.</p><p>These could be fantastic explanatory materials for<br/>acquainting people with some concepts about tuning or<br/>for illustrating theory, or simply for some good<br/>microtonal music with really cool video.</p><p>Perhaps this &quot;real world music&quot; project could be what<br/>finally gets us working in earnest on the hybrid<br/>Scala/FTS/adaptune/Midiconv/JustMusic/????<br/>software application project.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=620 href="#620">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 4:20:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Monz; this sounds really exciting and fun, but... if it took much<br/>of any modification to my program right now, the chances of my having<br/>time for it any time soon are slim.</p><p>It sounds like we would need that feature we&apos;ve talked about, where the<br/>sequencer can instruct the program what tuning to use when.  Then,<br/>existing code could make use of the springs to distribute out commas<br/>where necessary, etc.  That&apos;s pretty high on my list, but...</p><p>Do you think anything else would be required in the way of features?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
