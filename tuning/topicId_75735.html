You can tune pajara in a number of different ways; another optimal tuning by a different standard is TOP-RMS, with a period of 598.859347 cents and a generator of 106.844183 cents.</p><p>There are other temperaments that temper out one or the other of 50/49 and 64/63 but not both. An example is porcupine, which reduces 50/49 to 16.61 cents in the TOP-RMS tuning (P = 1197.839112, G = 162.586787) and tempers out 64/63 completely. Doublewide (TOP-RMS P = 600.046727, G = 274.302244) tempers out 50/49 completely and reduces 64/63 to 17.09 cents.</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2008 11:28:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Torsten Anders wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, this whole subject is very new to me and so I wanted to ask<br/>&gt; for alternative recommendations.

If you don&apos;t care about 7-limit intervals, then you get the 5-limit diaschismatic temperament which tempers out 2048/2025 (i.e. the diaschisma). If you want completely pure octaves and relatively &quot;nice&quot; thirds and fifths, the best solution I was able to find is to use a period of 600 cents and a generator of 105.8655 cents (i.e. 7/10 of the diaschisma wider than 135/128). By the way, this is exactly what I&apos;ve done at the end of January this year . At that time, I also made a piece of music in this tuning and some people here have also heard it on the day I finished it. In this piece, I used 12 tones per octave instead of 10 (i.e. 6 tones to each half-octave period), which gave me the advantage to play in G major and at the same time in Db major, for example.

I don&apos;t think you can get appreciably more just, anyway -- unless by &quot;thirds and fifths&quot; you mean the 5-limit intervals.

If you want to be more pragmatic there are alternatives:</p><p>Well temperament -- make the tuning more lumpy.  You can make some chords better in tune at the expense of others. Naturally you&apos;ll probably want the most important chords to be well tuned.  As a bonus you can get the temperament to circulate, so that you can modulate over a fixed number of notes.  22 and 34 are the most obvious choices.</p><p>Adaptive temperament -- have the tuning adjust on the fly. This is probably not something you&apos;re ready to deal with because you&apos;ll have to program it yourself.</p><p>Use more than 10 notes for the decatonic scale.  I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a cute name for this.  It means you can get the improved precision of adaptive temperament but you have to do the work yourself, instead of a machine making the adjustments for you.  As an extreme measure you can write decatonic music and tune it to just intonation.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps I should mention that the TOP tuning of Pajara is seemingly  &gt; not contained in the Scala list of scales, so I wondered whether  &gt; there are alternative or even better recommendations.</p><p>You can easily set up a pajara tuning using the &quot;pythagorean&quot; command in Scala.  So there isn&apos;t a need to supply every interesting tuning of every temperament class.</p><p>The reason 22 ET was originally considered optimal is that the tuning of 7:5 is independent of the generator size.  As no intervals in 22-equal are worse than this you can&apos;t improve on 22-equal -- if you believe in the minimax (minimum value of the maximum error).</p><p>A minimax tuning for the pajara generator is 109.4 cents.</p><p>For comparison, the generator&apos;s 109.1 cents in 22-equal.</p><p>However there are some intervals which can be improved relative to 22-equal.  If you care about the average mistuning then the RMS (root mean squared) optimum is more relevant.</p><p>The 7-limit RMS tuning is 108.8 cents.</p><p>Now we come to the &quot;TOP&quot; tunings.  The idea is that simple intervals are more important than complex one.  Herman&apos;s given you the TOP-RMS tuning, which optimizes the RMS of weighted intervals.  This is most valid if you care about the average mistuning of intervals beyond the 7-odd limit. The octave is one of the intervals that gets optimized.  If you don&apos;t want that you can unstretch the scale so that octaves are pure again.</p><p>The unstretched TOP-RMS tuning is 107.0 cents.</p><p>The plain TOP you found optimizes the worst weighted error.   However, this error is always that of 7:5, so to get a single answer you have to consider only intervals that depend on the generator.  I don&apos;t think that has any special meaning, but it&apos;ll work fine because it&apos;ll be close to the TOP-RMS.</p><p>The unstretched TOP tuning is 106.8 cents.</p><p>Which of these tunings is best is entirely a matter of taste.  The current fashion is for something like TOP.  You should try different ones (there are only two numbers to choose).

In the following I am translating some basic<br/>terminology from the documentation.</p><p>Intervall: specifies an interval, e.g., as ratio or an expression<br/>(&quot;Quint&quot; is fifth, &quot;Terz&quot; is third, &quot;wurzel&quot; is root).</p><p>  Quint = 3 : 2<br/>  SynKomma = 4 Quint - 2 Oktave - Terz<br/>  Semitone = 12 WURZEL 2</p><p>Ton: declares a note name, either absolutely or relatively to other<br/>pitches</p><p>  a = 440<br/>  e = a + Fifth</p><p>Tonsystem: declares a tone system consisting in a reference MIDI key<br/>(Verankerungstaste), a sequence or set (Menge) of tones (implicitly<br/>defining the size of the system), and an interval at which these<br/>tones are repeated (Periodenintervall).</p><p>  C_DUR = 60 [c, des, d, es, e, f, ges, g, as, a, b, h] Oktave<br/>  ET12 = 60 [c] HalbTon</p><p>Umstimmung: defines rules how the present tuning shall be changed,<br/>either absolute or relative to the present state. There are various<br/>possibilities. For example, the reference key (Verankerungstaste),<br/>the sequence of notes (including their size), or the<br/>Periodenintervall might be changed. The keyword &quot;@&quot; denotes the<br/>present state. The following example transposes the reference key by<br/>a variable x.</p><p>  Transpo (x) = @ + x [ ]</p><p>Harmonie: declares a key pattern of tone system positions.

However, I would prefer a<br/>tuning where the intervals are somewhat closer to their JI<br/>equivalents. In particular, I would like the (diatonically speaking)<br/>thirds and fifths to be &quot;somewhat more just&quot;. So, I searched around<br/>for a while and came across the TOP tuning of Pajara (AKA Paultone,<br/>or Twintone) which Erlich reports in his text &quot;A Middle Path&quot;. I find<br/>this tuning rather pleasing for my purposes.</p><p>However, this whole subject is very new to me and so I wanted to ask<br/>for alternative recommendations. Important for my purposes is that<br/>all intervals within the decatonic scales can be used, so 50/49 and<br/>64/63 (and 224/225) must be tempered out (which Pajara does, as does<br/>22 ET). Additionally, as mentioned above, I would like relatively<br/>just tunings (thirds and fifths in particular).</p><p>In general, I would be grateful for any alternative temperament<br/>recommendations with which these scales can be played, just to get a<br/>better overview of the options. &gt;&gt;</p><p>(End of quote)</p><p>I thought that, even if there were any doubt whether Torsten was<br/>seeking a temperament (class) or temperament (tuning), the inclusion<br/>of the phrases &quot;would prefer a tuning&quot; and &quot;find this tuning rather<br/>pleasing&quot; should have made it clear that it was the latter.  All 3<br/>occurrences of the term &quot;temperament&quot; in his message make perfect<br/>sense when you interpret it to mean a tuning, particularly when he<br/>says that he wants &quot;the thirds and fifths in particular&quot; (which I<br/>think we agree refers to the 5-limit consonances) &quot;relatively just&quot;<br/>to specify what he&apos;s seeking in a tuning for the decatonic scale.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps Torsten can clarify, but I understood him to ask<br/>&gt; about a temperament other than pajara.</p><p>Just to clarify that I understand what you mean by &quot;temperament&quot;,<br/>that&apos;s temperament (class) you&apos;re speaking of, not temperament<br/>(tuning).</p><p>After reading through this thread, I discovered that he did indeed<br/>clarify what he was seeking:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75755">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75755</a><br/>from which I quote:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Naively, I would have assumed that &quot;tuning&quot; indicates any pitch<br/>set (including JI), and &quot;temperament&quot; is some tuning which only<br/>approximates JI for some reasons (e.g., to remove some commas).

Unfortunately, that didn&apos;t seem to<br/>clarify very much, since that term was new to Torsten.  I would<br/>really prefer &quot;temperament family&quot;, which I used extensively in both<br/>my 17-tone and Miracle articles; after all, don&apos;t temperaments<br/>(tempered tunings) inherit characteristics from their families.

None<br/>of these require specific pitches (or intervals between pitches), but<br/>any one of these:<br/>1) is a set of tones suitable for composing a simple melody (as<br/>opposed to a few consecutive pitches separated by, e.g., 3 or 3000<br/>cents);<br/>2) is generally assumed to repeat at a particular period (usually an<br/>octave);<br/>3) generally indicates some particular number of tones per period:<br/>major=7, chromatic=12); decatonic=10, pelog=7;<br/>4) often specifies some general interval pattern (or progression of<br/>interval classes) when the tones are put in ascending order:<br/>major=LLsLLLs, etc.;<br/>5) is capable of being played in more than a single tuning (such that<br/>the pitches and/or intervals are not really specific).</p><p>So #5 reveals that a bag of pitches is not necessarily a scale, while<br/>two different bags of pitches may indeed be the same scale.</p><p>&gt; Given<br/>&gt; it alone, it can be impossible to know whether it implies<br/>&gt; a temperament or not, etc. etc.</p><p>Yes, it can be tricky to discern the origin and/or intent of some<br/>irregular collection of pitches, but OTOH, you can often reverse-<br/>engineer a tuning by playing around with it and/or executing a &quot;show<br/>data&quot; command in Scala.  It&apos;s pretty obvious that 152-ET closely<br/>approximates 11-limit JI, but to understand why Paul Erlich likes it<br/>you&apos;d also have to be interested in multi-purpose tunings with both<br/>narrow (meantone-like) and wide (pajara) fifths.  I&apos;d have to say<br/>that 224-ET is much better across the board; but I digress.</p><p>&gt; There are temperaments<br/>&gt; arbitrarily close in accuracy to JI, and in practice any<br/>&gt; JI cannot be exact.</p><p>Yep, such is the folly of being a diehard JI-ist.</p><p>&gt; Further, it is possible to express a<br/>&gt; temperament using rational numbers.</p><p>If you&apos;re using the term to mean a (tempered) tuning (which I&apos;m not<br/>sure you are), then yes, that was a lot of fun for me a couple of<br/>years ago.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t call a bag of<br/>&gt; pitches a tuning unless I know what the target is.</p><p>What do you mean by that?  A set of pitches, listed as frequencies<br/>(or cents) and expressible as a Scala file, *are* the target (to<br/>which one tunes).  (Technically, it&apos;s the intervals between the<br/>pitches that are specified, since changing the starting pitch doesn&apos;t<br/>really change the essence of the tuning, but merely transposes it.)</p><p>&gt; temperament * tuning = scale</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>As I see it, in order to make music using a temperament (class), you<br/>need to choose a tuning by specifying the exact generator(s) and<br/>period.  Then, if that tuning is not a closed system (one-<br/>dimensional), you need to specify a scale that limits the tuning to a<br/>finite number of tones (within the audible range of pitches).</p><p>We&apos;re probably saying much the same things, but our terms may not<br/>mean the same.  Rigorous definitions can require a lot of careful<br/>thought.</p><p>&gt; In the case of a linear temperament, the tuning can be<br/>&gt; expressed with only two numbers (the size of the period<br/>&gt; and the generator), but the tuning could be more complex.<br/>&gt; For example, in the case of well temperaments (which<br/>&gt; I would like to call &quot;circulating tunings&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George wants to preserve the common usage of these terms.<br/>&gt; However, since the common usage isn&apos;t precise (uses these<br/>&gt; terms interchangeably), I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a good idea.</p><p>I&apos;m only saying that it&apos;s not a good idea to assign a term (such<br/>as &quot;temperament&quot;, or &quot;meantone&quot; as used in conjunction<br/>with &quot;temperament&quot;) a meaning that is seldom (if ever) used outside<br/>these lists.  That makes terms even less precise than they already<br/>are.</p><p>&gt; &gt; BTW: Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory also has<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; entry for temperament, but not (yet?) for &quot;temperament class&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/t/temperament.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/t/temperament.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  The entry for temperament also shows several different<br/>&gt; definitions.  Gene&apos;s is the one I am advocating.</p><p>Tee hee!  You practically need a math degree to figure out what that<br/>means.</p><p>Besides, Gene&apos;s definition is for a *regular* temperament, and<br/>therefore not a temperament in general.</p><p>-- George</p></div><h3>George D.

The &quot;limit&quot; terminology is used throughout the<br/>literature of the Just Intonation Network (and their<br/>journal 1/1), and goes back to Partch.  In the world at<br/>large, just intonation usually implies the 5-limit, and<br/>people say &quot;extended just intonation&quot; to refer to stuff<br/>beyond that.  Here when we say &quot;JI&quot; we don&apos;t mean specifically<br/>the 5-limit, so it would seem you&apos;re in good company here.</p><p>&gt; Diatonic, fixed pitch instruments did and still do use<br/>&gt; Just intonation.

I guess you will spring the snare and explain<br/>&gt; your point in asking.</p><p>Yes, sorry.  There was a long period during which Pythagorean<br/>(&quot;3-limit JI&quot;) was the standard for keyboard instruments.<br/>This regime gave way directly to meantone.  It is a common<br/>misconception that there was a period of 5-limit JI use<br/>first.  If you are claiming that, now would be the time to<br/>present evidence, citations, etc.</p><p>&gt; I guess I am a bit edgy because of these peculiar,<br/>&gt; microscopic, seemingly deliberately intimidating distinctions<br/>&gt; you fellas want to make in terminology, unheard of outside<br/>&gt; of this group.

Secor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2008 10:44:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear &quot;Tuneit99&quot; (sorry, but that&apos;s the best I can do, since I don&apos;t<br/>think you have yet told us your actual name),</p><p>I apologize if I did not make myself clear.  My intention was not to<br/>correct you, but simply to explain my understanding that meantone<br/>followed *both* Pythagorean (the *tuning actually used* for many<br/>centuries up to that time) and JI (a rediscovered *tuning ideal* used<br/>by the ancient Greeks).  As such, I see it as a reconciliation (or<br/>synthesis) between an actual and an ideal, so that to ignore one or<br/>the other is to miss half the picture.  If you choose not to see it<br/>that way, then we can agree to disagree.  But at least let me explain<br/>how I came to this conclusion.</p><p>If all of the descriptions you have read say that meantone was<br/>derived from JI, not Pythagorean, then I would have to think that<br/>either they were mistaken, or else you&apos;re making an incorrect<br/>inference from what was said or (more likely) not said.  When I first<br/>investigated alternative tunings (in the mid-1960&apos;s), there were not<br/>very many sources of information available to me.  Nevertheless,<br/>there were differing viewpoints and biases, and it didn&apos;t take me<br/>long to discover that some of these sources contained all sorts of<br/>misleading information: either incomplete, or inaccurate, or<br/>incorrect, or mere opinion, or some combination of these.  Sadly,<br/>much of this misinformation appeared in articles in music<br/>dictionaries and encyclopedias, written by people who were supposedly<br/>authorities on the subject.  Since some of these seemed to be passing<br/>on misinformation from others, I concluded that a majority opinion<br/>cannot be assumed to be correct.</p><p>One blatant example I encountered was the widespread belief that<br/>melody involving intervals smaller than a semitone (such as found in<br/>musical scales in the East, and in experimental microtonal scales) is<br/>incompatible with harmony, from which one was expected to draw the<br/>following conclusions: 1) a 12-tone octave, specifically 12-equal, is<br/>best for harmony; and 2) microtonality is not an appropriate and/or<br/>desirable path for the music of the West.</p><p>Anyway, to get back to the point in question, my most reliable<br/>historical source was J. Murray Barbour&apos;s _Tuning and Temperament_,<br/>from which I&apos;ll quote from the beginning of chapter 3<br/>(titled &quot;Meantone Temperament&quot;, pp. 25-26):</p><p>&lt;&lt; It is not definitely known when temperament was first used.<br/>Vicentino stated that the fretted instruments had always been in<br/>equal temperament.  As for the keyboard instruments, Zarlino declared<br/>that temperament was as old as the complete chromatic keyboard.  It<br/>may well be that some organs in the fifteenth century had had<br/>temperament of a sort, although the Pythagorean tuning continued to<br/>have too many advocates not to have been dominant in the earlier<br/>period.  However that may be, Riemann discovered the first mention of<br/>temperament in a passage from Gafurius&apos; _Practica musica_ (1496).<br/>[footnote: Hugo Riemann, _Geschichte der Musiktheorie_ (Berlin,<br/>1898), p. 327]  There, among the eight rules of counterpoint,<br/>Gafurius said that organists assert that fifths undergo a small,<br/>indefinite amount of diminution called temperament (_participata_).<br/>Since he was reporting a contemporary fact, rather than advocating an<br/>innovation, the practice may have begun decades earlier than his time.</p><p>... Grammateus&apos; division of Pythagorean tones into equal semitones<br/>came only twenty-two years after Gafurius&apos; observation, and ranks<br/>very high among irregular systems that approach equal temperament. ...</p><p>Dechales had no authority for stating that Guideo of Arezzo was the<br/>father of temperament.  The association of Ramis with temperament is<br/>one of the most common misconceptions in the history of tuning.  And,<br/>although Schlick&apos;s system undoubtedly can properly be described as a<br/>temperament, it is just as surely of an irregular variety.  It is<br/>well to mention these names, and discard each of them, before saying<br/>that full credit for describing the meantone temperament must go to<br/>Pietro Aron. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Barbour goes on to give Aron&apos;s directions for tuning meantone,<br/>starting with a just C-E, then making the fifths C-G and G-D &quot;a<br/>little flat&quot; and then tuning A &quot;so that the fifths D-A and A-E are<br/>equal.&quot;  From these tuning directions I believe we can safely<br/>conclude that this temperament was intended to be used on *keyboard<br/>instruments*.</p><p>So you see that the first temperaments (in the several decades<br/>preceding Aron&apos;s description of meantone, in 1523) were deliberate<br/>alterations to the Pythagorean tuning, on keyboard instruments.  I<br/>would find it very difficult to believe that these early practical<br/>experiments had no influence or bearing whatsoever on the development<br/>of the meantone temperament.  While it&apos;s possible to explain that<br/>meantone temperament can be derived (abstractly) *solely* with<br/>reference to just intonation, the historical context seems to<br/>indicate that this was not the way it actually happened.</p><p>Do you have any evidence that just intonation was actually used on<br/>keyboard instruments prior to meantone, or that Aron (or one of his<br/>contemporaries) explicitly explained meantone temperament as having<br/>been derived solely from JI, or that meantone temperament was<br/>designed for (and consequently used on) an instrument previously<br/>tuned to JI (such as a psaltery, as you suggest)?  If such is the<br/>case, then I&apos;ll gladly stand corrected.</p><p>Really, I&apos;m not trying to intimidate you.  Discussions in which there<br/>exist differences of opinion can be contests, or they can be<br/>opportunities to learn and to build a consensus.  You were the one<br/>who initiated this, when you said that you thought I needed to<br/>clarify that meantone was derived (exclusively) from JI in one place<br/>in my 17-tone paper, where I wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;Once tones related by simple ratios involving the prime number 5<br/>&gt; were discovered to be harmonically consonant (beginning in the 13th<br/>&gt; century), it was found that if the fifths were altered (or<br/>tempered)<br/>&gt; slightly narrow, the resulting scale would be better for triadic<br/>&gt; harmony. The meantone temperament, devised in 1523 by Pietro Aron,<br/>&gt; has a fifth tempered by one-quarter of Didymus&apos; comma (the amount<br/>by<br/>&gt; which four just fifths less two octaves exceeds a just major<br/>third),<br/>&gt; of approximately 696.6 cents.&quot;</p><p>This was a portion of my very brief (four-paragraph) &quot;whirlwind&quot;<br/>history of tuning, against which I subsequently outlined a fictional<br/>alternate history of tuning that could have been, and if it were so,<br/>then where we might be today.</p><p>Is there anything in the above quote that&apos;s incorrect or misleading?<br/>(Too late to change it anyway, since it&apos;s already published in<br/>Xenharmonikon 18.)  I referred to both 5-limit JI (as &quot;simple ratios<br/>involving the prime number 5&quot;) and tempered fifths, with the<br/>(intended) implication that they were essential ingredients that led<br/>to the development of the meantone temperament.  One omission in the<br/>above quote, which has come up in the course of this discussion, is<br/>that temperaments have been developed mainly on (and for) keyboard<br/>instruments, but I can&apos;t see that as serious.</p><p>If the tuning of the psaltery had any part to play (was anyone using<br/>it in JI in the early 16th century?) in the development of meantone,<br/>then that would be good to know.</p><p>--George</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;tuneit99&quot; &lt;tuneit99@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Attribute abstract complexity to it if you wish, but I choose not<br/>to be<br/>&gt; corrected on that point.
