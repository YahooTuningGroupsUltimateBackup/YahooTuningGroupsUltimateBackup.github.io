Also, one of your studies<br/>has helped to set in motion a musical project on which I am now<br/>engaged, making this an all the more appropriate occasion to support<br/>some of your insights on the question of music education and &quot;canons.&quot;</p><p>In 1597, Thomas Morley wrote of some &quot;faults to be avoided in<br/>imitation,&quot; and the kind of &quot;canons&quot; we are discussing may indeed<br/>involve faults such as universalizing the musical values of a<br/>particular style or era or culture while ignoring or even actively<br/>devaluing other equally important values of other styles and eras and<br/>cultures.</p><p>Morley specifically wanted to warn his students against emulating<br/>certain Italian composers (then all the rage in post-Armada England)<br/>in what he viewed as their licenses involving parallel fifths and<br/>octaves, or near approaches thereto. Here, I suspect that both of us<br/>are urging that people avoid unquestioningly engaging in the imitation<br/>and perpetuation of &quot;canonic&quot; values which, as you emphasize,<br/>marginalize many kind of European as well as other world musics.</p><p>Since this is a Tuning List, one good example of a &quot;canonic&quot; view is<br/>the assertion that 16th-century practice and theory are moving toward<br/>12-tone equal temperament (12-tet) as well as the major/minor key<br/>tonality of the 18th and 19th centuries. In other words, it seems to<br/>me, the Classic/Romantic eras of European music favored by this<br/>&quot;canon&quot; become a kind of universal frame of reference by which all<br/>other music should be measured -- as you so well describe in your own<br/>article.</p><p>Is it really so &quot;obvious&quot; that &quot;everyone&quot; today would wish to trade a<br/>keyboard in 31-note meantone, for example, for one in 12-tet, or that<br/>the modal system of the 16th century (with all its flexibility and<br/>&quot;mixed modes&quot; documented in theory and practice) is somehow less<br/>beautiful or fertile than the 18th-century key system (conceived,<br/>incidentally, in an environment where unequal well- temperaments for<br/>keyboards were likely far more prominent than 12-tet approximations)?</p><p>While I tend to look at the &quot;canon&quot; from the perspective of medieval<br/>and Renaissance European music, there is another curious tendency: the<br/>tendency of authors to identify with a &quot;we&quot; which may pertain to<br/>18th-century norms, but not necessarily to 20th-century norms as<br/>expressed in actual contemporary European &quot;classical&quot; music, let alone<br/>the historical and current practices of many other world musics.</p><p>For example, I have seen in various places the assertion that a<br/>three-voice sonority of 4:6:9 &quot;was consonant to medieval composers,<br/>but is dissonant to us.&quot; Here it is tempting to ask, &quot;What about all<br/>the 20th-century music using fourth and fifth chords as favored<br/>concords?&quot; Such sonorities indeed sound &quot;dissonant&quot; in musics where<br/>they are out of place, or are treated in ways other than the idiomatic<br/>ones (e.g. suspensions).</p><p>One value of the current movement for alternative tunings is that it<br/>affords a radically different perspective -- or many such perspectives<br/>-- for viewing history. As Glenn Watkins notes in his study of<br/>Gesualdo, quoting Giedion, absolute points of reference are no more<br/>open to the historian than to the physicist. Looking at music in terms<br/>of its basic assumptions regarding the size of intervals is one way to<br/>appreciate some different points of view.</p><p>The case of Nicola Vicentino, the topic of the paper which introduced<br/>me to you and your writings, today remains a leading example. Even<br/>modern authors who have considerable interest in &quot;avant garde&quot; music,<br/>Renaissance or current, tend to accept the view that Vicentino &quot;went<br/>off the deep end&quot; when it came to really taking the chromatic and<br/>enharmonic genera seriously, and proposing their very practical modern<br/>use.</p><p>Then, as now, a music based on radically different intervals and<br/>premises requires some acculturation; thus I can easily understood how<br/>an unfamiliar listener might conclude that &quot;this is just a mathe-<br/>matical or historical exercise which even the composer doesn&apos;t<br/>_really_ like to hear.&quot; Maybe the issue here, quite apart from the<br/>actual quality of the new music (another question), is how willing the<br/>listener is to adjust to a novel set of sounds -- or, in the case of<br/>Vicentino, a set of often familiar concords arranged in radically new<br/>relations.</p><p>Along with an acculturation to new sounds may go a new orientation to<br/>history: for example, the various systems of the 16th and 17th<br/>centuries with more than 12 notes per octave.</p><p>Finally, such a flexible approach to tunings and styles may invite us<br/>to join in the making of history, to create new music following a road<br/>which may not have been taken (or may indeed have bene taken, but not<br/>as often as others).</p><p>As Morley declares, there be more ways to the woods than one. In<br/>the matter of musical &quot;canons,&quot; I find it often a useful rule to<br/>follow one of the time-honored doctrines of discant and counterpoint:<br/>the value of contrary motion.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
