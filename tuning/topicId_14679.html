I<br/>find I can do more with allowing choices within strongly defined structures. It takes so<br/>little in instructions to influence a music. If i place a particular instrument in front of a<br/>person with a particular scale, I have determined quite allot, even more so it a rhythmic<br/>substructure is played , even by another. I have found it fruitful  in single pieces to have<br/>different players to have different levels of predetermined music, from total to none. Many<br/>world music have such balance in all types of different ways and it has produced some very<br/>varied music within it confines.</p><p>&quot;D.Stearns&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I could never<br/>&gt; compose a &quot;better&quot; solo guitar piece than I could improvise, but<br/>&gt; there&apos;s also no way that I would expect any of my groups to improvise<br/>&gt; one of my compositions -- if you want a three measure rhythmic unison<br/>&gt; across seven instruments, free-improvisation might not be the best<br/>&gt; tactical approach to solving this problem!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I cherish both through composition and total improvisation. But aside<br/>&gt; from hopefully being good music &lt;!&gt;, I don&apos;t expect each to be able to<br/>&gt; be the other.</p><p>&gt; --d.stearns</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
