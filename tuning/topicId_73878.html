The key of A major as a whole could still be rather<br/>lousy or lumpy for real music, if notes such as E# and A# are<br/>uncomfortably high for their musical contexts.  Those notes do come<br/>up frequently in 18th century A-major music....</p><p>This type of enharmonic problem comes up, even in temperaments that<br/>are as moderate as &quot;Vallotti&quot; is (or, for that matter and sticking to<br/>England: Young&apos;s #1 of 1799, which is merely the same layout as<br/>Vallotti but with the B nudged up by about 1/12 comma, and the F<br/>similarly nudged down).</p><p>So, how is anybody sure that -- as the green section of that web page<br/>asserts in several places, inserting a premise into the presentation -<br/>- Cavallo was reacting to anything near the tightness of 1/4 comma,<br/>or its resulting pure major 3rds?  Why couldn&apos;t he have been<br/>describing a &quot;common&quot; system more in the 1/5, 1/6, or even 1/7 or 1/8<br/>range, and have just been a good musician assessing intonation in<br/>whole compositions, beyond plunking the central triads per key?  On<br/>the Cavallo excerpts as presented, it appears he was sensitive enough<br/>musically to have done so.</p><p>And if Cavallo omitted G minor among the good keys, in whatever<br/>temperaments he heard in common use, maybe he was reacting to typical<br/>things that are problematic in G minor music -- such as some too-low<br/>Ab, Db, and/or Gb in some harmonic or melodic contexts, drawing undue<br/>attention to themselves?  Cavallo cites Handel&apos;s music.  Well, I have<br/>some Handel pieces in G minor right here, and they have plenty of Db<br/>occurrences in them, and they sound (IMO) unfelicitous at those spots<br/>when played in Werckmeister III, or some of the other typical<br/>circulating temps.  Perhaps Cavallo was hearing something similarly<br/>subtle.</p><p>On a harpsichord, try something as simple as straightforward<br/>Vallotti, and then at the end knock down the Bb/A# a little bit so<br/>the F# major triad is nicer, at not much expense of Bb major.  (This<br/>will improve the usability of B minor for music, but without making<br/>F# major itself very good yet for full-length pieces.)  Then play<br/>around in some Handel, plus some other B minor music, with Cavallo&apos;s<br/>commentary in the background.  Do you hear the same effects he&apos;s<br/>describing, as to the usability of the keys he says he likes and<br/>dislikes?  I do.  That&apos;s not to say that he was hearing specifically<br/>that type of recipe...but only that the usable/unusable assessment<br/>for Cavallo may have been geared toward subtleties, not toward the<br/>broadsword obviousness of meantones or slightly modified meantones.</p><p>He&apos;s omitted E minor from the good list, but has B minor on there<br/>(so, we might assume that A# was not a terrible note in context).<br/>Maybe some musicians around him were fond of relatively high D#s, or<br/>a narrow Eb-Bb?  Or perhaps is the omission of E minor implying a<br/>lousy E#, in modulations to ii (F# minor) of E minor, and/or<br/>melodically....?</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
