What we need is a two-headed lion, a notation that can easily switch from meantone to pythagorean. Why don&apos;t you focus on the 79 MOS instead?

In fact, you can get as much diatonical major scales as can be achieved by 159tET. I am, of course assuming 7.5 cent equivalences.</p><p>  It&apos;s not clear how this is supposed to work. If you go around a circle<br/>  of fifths, you get two alternating sizes of fifths. If M is a meantone<br/>  fifth and P is a Pythagorean fifth, you get scales like MPMPMPP. How<br/>  are these going to be useful for maqams?</p><p>  In exactly the way you delineated. Meantone fifth gives an E closer to 5/4, Pythagorean, to 81/64, Super-Pythagorean to 14/11. A significant number of Maqams require this precision in most cases. In order to specify the principal generator interval I can write M, P and SP to the staff wherever they may be required.</p></div>
