In addition, you get some idea of my<br/>voice. &lt;grin&gt; Enjly. Now on to Dave Carpenter&apos;s message.</p><p>&gt;Guys, thanks again for your work in the Verituner project so far. The<br/>&gt;demo went real well. Of course there is lots more to talk about and do.<br/>&gt;Perhaps we could set up a conference call. In the meantime, I made a<br/>&gt;10-minute presentation about the project and the demo at the PTG<br/>&gt;convention. It includes audio from the Verituner. Have a listen, sorry<br/>&gt;it&apos;s a little squeaky because I compressed it down:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.veritune.com/download/AudibleTalk32kbps.mp3">http://www.veritune.com/download/AudibleTalk32kbps.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
