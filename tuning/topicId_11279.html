I missed the point of your previously reply because I<br/>hadn&apos;t recognized 2^phi as the generator of the Fibonacci series scales.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  Are cyclic groups perceptually real?  I<br/>&gt;can&apos;t say,<br/>&gt;&gt; but from experience I feel that every piece of music sets up an<br/>&gt;expectation<br/>&gt;&gt; of a minimum step, which doesn&apos;t mean minimum with reference to some<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute standard in freq or log freq ratio (we might say, Western<br/>&gt;music<br/>&gt;&gt; sets up a 100 cent minimum, but that would be wrong, because a<br/>&gt;raised<br/>&gt;&gt; leading tone doesn&apos;t upset the expectation), but a minimum with<br/>&gt;reference<br/>&gt;&gt; to the number of distinct tones per 8ve, tuned however.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;With no restrictions on propriety?</p><p>I&apos;m assuming propriety to be derived from relations in the scale<br/>constructed by the listener, not relations between absolute pitches.  If<br/>the listener has 12 notes in his 8ve (which will presumably be the case for<br/>Western music which is not completely diatonic), then a tritone is a<br/>tritone, whether or not the scale is tuned as a Pythagorean or Just 12-tone<br/>scale.  Certainly a Pythagorean diatonic doesn&apos;t have the effect of an<br/>improper scale, but in terms of absolute pitches, it is.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In any case, a stronger point is that many musical systems<br/>&gt;&gt; using fifth-generated scales employ non-harmonic and rapid decay<br/>&gt;toned<br/>&gt;&gt; idiophones such as xylophone-type instruments, where the consonance<br/>&gt;of the<br/>&gt;&gt; 3/2 is irrelevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What happened to the difference tones you mentioned above? They occur<br/>&gt;even between sine waves when played harmonically, so certainly they<br/>&gt;occur with xylophon-like timbres, but I&apos;m suspicious about your claim<br/>&gt;that they occur melodically -- you must have overlapping decays or<br/>&gt;something.</p><p>When I play a short repeating sequence of notes in the upper range of the<br/>tin whistle, very clear difference tones result from the interaction of the<br/>sounding note with the resonances of the preceeding note.  But this is such<br/>an unusual effect that you&apos;d never design scales on the basis of it.<br/>Obviously, with xylophone-type instruments, the same effect will not occur,<br/>the decay time, range, and volume are all completely different.  Rasch has<br/>done psychoacoustical studies on difference tones and concluded that they<br/>are so weak in ordinary musical circumstances that they couldn&apos;t possibly<br/>have an influence on ordinary musical perception.  The point I meant to<br/>illustrate, which I didn&apos;t make clear, even the weakest aspect associated<br/>with the vertical combination of tones can influence the perception of<br/>melody in some circumstances, a con to the main point I was trying to make.</p><p>&gt;In any case, you will not find that the 3:2 is at all a<br/>&gt;special generator when considered on the basis of how often it<br/>&gt;produces<br/>&gt;proper scales. And in fact, in cultures where these xylophone-like<br/>&gt;timbres are used, the generator often deviates quite far from 3:2 (or<br/>&gt;7/12 octave): in Thailand it is 4/7 octave, and in Indonesia it is<br/>&gt;either approximately 3/5 octave, or approximately 5/9 octave, for<br/>&gt;slendro and pelog, respectively. The fact that all these generators<br/>&gt;are<br/>&gt;within 35 cents of a 3:2 ratio is, I believe, rooted in the vocal<br/>&gt;basis<br/>&gt;of these musical cultures. If the octave were truly the only<br/>&gt;acoustically relevant interval, and propriety at various stages of<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;construction of a scale from a single generator was the only<br/>&gt;criterion,<br/>&gt;there would be no reason to choose a 3:2 ratio or anything near it.</p><p>Absolutely.  We&apos;re agreed on this point.  My idea is that perhaps the<br/>Kornerup golden fifth has certain special mathematical properties which are<br/>musically relevant.  The nearness of this interval to the harmonically<br/>relevant interval of 3:2 may be a coincidence which confuses our sense of<br/>why the fifth is an important interval in various respects.</p><p>&gt;The question as to which generator is &quot;best&quot; in your sense is a<br/>&gt;difficult one, Jason, since all noble numbers share the property that<br/>&gt;the ratio of the size of the denominator of one convergent to the<br/>&gt;size<br/>&gt;of the denominator of the next convergent rapidly approaches phi as<br/>&gt;you<br/>&gt;go farther and farther out into the expansion.</p><p>&gt;However, you may be more interested in the first few MOS scales you<br/>&gt;get<br/>&gt;than in the behavior of MOS scales out toward infinity. Observe that<br/>&gt;the last property I mentioned, dividing existing steps in the<br/>&gt;proportion 1:phi, starts happening at the point in the process of<br/>&gt;taking convergents where the rest of the continued fraction expansion<br/>&gt;contains all 1s. Since that happens right away with the &quot;2^phi&quot; or<br/>&gt;phi-<br/>&gt;of-an-octave generator, it would seem that this generator best<br/>&gt;captures<br/>&gt;the property you&apos;re after. I know that you are interested in<br/>&gt;propriety;<br/>&gt;I leave it as an exercise for you to catalogue the first few proper<br/>&gt;scales that each of these generators generates, and let me know how<br/>&gt;they compare. My bets are on the the phi-of-an-octave generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m afraid this generator, and the scales it produces, do not agree<br/>&gt;with what we observe in scales around the world. In fact I&apos;m unaware<br/>&gt;of<br/>&gt;any music that uses this generator and any of the Fibonacci series of<br/>&gt;MOSs that it produces.</p><p>I concur again.  I&apos;m way off the mark if my analysis points out the 2^phi<br/>generated scales as special.  And clearly, it&apos;s cardinality numbers are<br/>lower with respect to their positions in the series than any other similar<br/>series, since it begins with the lowest numbers.  I&apos;ve been looking at that<br/>series and comparing it to Yasser&apos;s series and it turns out that Yasser&apos;s<br/>scales are more efficient.  Whether adding efficiency into the equation<br/>brings out a third series as special, I haven&apos;t discovered yet.  Efficiency<br/>is a much more difficult property to generalize about.  What I have<br/>discovered is that MOS&apos;s in general are special with respect to efficiency,<br/>because they always have two transpositions differing only in one note from<br/>the original.  All of the MOS scales are generated by this process are<br/>equivalent with respect to stability, so another factor must be at work,<br/>and most likely, that factor is the approximation of Kornerup&apos;s 5th to the<br/>3/2, but efficiency is, at least, one more possible consideration.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=11280 href="#11280">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

My idea is that perhaps the<br/>&gt;Kornerup golden fifth has certain special mathematical properties</p><p>It certainly does.</p><p>&gt;which are<br/>&gt;musically relevant.</p><p>That is what I dispute. Spud duBoise has some interesting web pages up (see<br/><a href="http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/golden.html">http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/golden.html</a>, on Kornerup&apos;s golden<br/>meantone tuning) and when I grilled him on his assumptions behind the page<br/><a href="http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/temperament.html">http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/music/temperament.html</a>, it turned out that he<br/>felt much as you do (I&apos;ll ask him if I can forward his remarks). However he<br/>did not discount the importance of approximating simple ratios -- if<br/>anything, he over-zealously ascribes</p><p>&gt;The nearness of this interval to the harmonically<br/>&gt;relevant interval of 3:2 may be a coincidence which confuses our sense of<br/>&gt;why the fifth is an important interval in various respects.</p><p>The Kornerup golden fifth is even nearer to the optimal meantone fifth<br/>(i.e., the optimal fifth for triadic harmony). See the table about 3/5 of<br/>the way down the page <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm</a> --<br/>observe how very close the optimal meantone fifths are to the Kornerup<br/>Golden fifth at 696.21 cents. See also the table at the bottom of the page.<br/>Anyhow, the Kornerup fifth (like the Harrison/LucyTuning fifth) is so near<br/>as to be indistinguishable from fifths with musically relevant properties.<br/>That&apos;s as close as I&apos;m willing to come to saying it&apos;s musically relevant.</p><p>&gt;I concur again.  I&apos;m way off the mark if my analysis points out the 2^phi<br/>&gt;generated scales as special.  And clearly, it&apos;s cardinality numbers are<br/>&gt;lower with respect to their positions in the series than any other similar<br/>&gt;series, since it begins with the lowest numbers.</p><p>Well, as I showed in my post earlier today, that appears incorrect. Calling<br/>the 2^phi case &quot;Phibonacci&quot;:</p><p>Phibonacci 1  2  3  5  8  13 21 34 55 89 . . .<br/>Kornerup   1  2  3  5  7  12 19 31 50 81 . . .<br/>Lucas      1  2  3  4  7  11 18 29 47 76 . . .</p><p>So in fact, Phibonacci&apos;s points of propriety are higher numbers with respect<br/>to their positions than those of Kornerup&apos;s golden fifth. However, the Lucas<br/>generator of 868.33 cents has got both of them beat.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve been looking at that<br/>&gt;series and comparing it to Yasser&apos;s series and it turns out that Yasser&apos;s<br/>&gt;scales are more efficient.  Whether adding efficiency into the equation<br/>&gt;brings out a third series as special, I haven&apos;t discovered yet.  Efficiency<br/>&gt;is a much more difficult property to generalize about.  What I have<br/>&gt;discovered is that MOS&apos;s in general are special with respect to efficiency,<br/>&gt;because they always have two transpositions differing only in one note from<br/>&gt;the original.  All of the MOS scales are generated by this process are<br/>&gt;equivalent with respect to stability, so another factor must be at work,<br/>&gt;and most likely, that factor is the approximation of Kornerup&apos;s 5th to the<br/>&gt;3/2, but efficiency is, at least, one more possible consideration.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested in seeing your efficiency analysis and also analyzing the<br/>Lucas scales I posted about today on the basis of efficiency. Actually, I<br/>was going to guess the opposite -- that the Phibonacci generator is best<br/>with regard to efficiency.</p></div>
