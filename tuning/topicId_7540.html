Let&apos;s briefly consider this<br/>reservation, which could be overcome with a somewhat larger<br/>instrument.</p><p>In presenting his 36-note (or ideally 38-note) archicembalo, Vicentino<br/>actually describes two tunings. The first tuning uses the 31 notes of<br/>the first five &quot;ranks&quot; -- the 19 notes of the lower manual, and the<br/>first 12 notes of the second -- to divide the octave into roughly<br/>equal dieses of about 1/5-tone. The remaining 5 notes on the sixth<br/>rank of the instrument -- the last rank of the second manual --<br/>provide a few pure fifths with the notes of the first rank for<br/>adaptive JI.</p><p>In practice, Vicentino evidently found it difficult to accommodate<br/>more than 17 notes on his second manual -- but in principle, he would<br/>like to have 19 notes on the upper manual as well as the lower,<br/>allowing 7 notes rather than 5 for the sixth rank.</p><p>Here I give these extra notes in parentheses; an asterisk (*) shows a<br/>note raised by a diesis or fifthtone, while an apostrophe or raised<br/>comma (&apos;) shows a note raised by a &quot;comma&quot; -- which, for Vicentino,<br/>can mean among other things the amount by which the fifth is tempered<br/>in his basic meantone tuning. If we assume 1/4-comma meantone, this<br/>&quot;comma&quot; would actually be equal to 1/4 syntonic comma, or ~5.38<br/>cents.</p><p>6  (F&apos;)      G&apos;        A&apos;       B&apos;    (C&apos;)       D&apos;       E&apos;    F&apos;<br/>5          Gb*       Ab*      Bb*              Db*       Eb*<br/>4    F*        G*        A*        B*   C*         D*        E*<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3        Gb        Ab      A#        B#      Db      D#        E#<br/>2      F#        G#          Bb            C#          Eb<br/>1  F         G         A         B     C         D         E     F</p><p>The second tuning likewise has the first manual in a 19-note meantone<br/>with a compass of Gb-A#, but has all notes of the second manual tuned<br/>in pure fifths with the first. If the first manual is tuned in<br/>1/4-comma temperament, then this arrangement indeed provides precisely<br/>the pure 5-limit consonances associated in the 16th century with<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic:</p><p>6        Gb&apos;       Ab&apos;     A#&apos;      (B#&apos;)    Db&apos;    D#&apos;       (E#&apos;)<br/>5      F#&apos;       G#&apos;         Bb&apos;           C#&apos;         Eb&apos;<br/>4  F&apos;        G&apos;        A&apos;        B&apos;    C&apos;        D&apos;        E&apos;<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3        Gb        Ab      A#        B#      Db      D#        E#<br/>2      F#        G#          Bb            C#          Eb<br/>1  F         G         A         B     C         D         E     F</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s first tuning provides a complete system for<br/>enharmonic or fifthtone music, plus a few adaptive JI sonorities, his<br/>second provides a more or less complete adaptive JI system with a<br/>compass of Gb-A#, sufficient for just about any 16th-century music<br/>except such fifthtone compositions.</p><p>Discussing the application of this adaptive JI system -- or classic<br/>5-limit JI a la Zarlino, for that matter -- to this music raises the<br/>question of 16th-century approaches to vertical sonorities and<br/>progressions. Here I present a single progression for consideration,<br/>in order to introduce a few concepts and also illustrate Vicentino&apos;s<br/>tuning in action.</p><p>Let us consider this common and pleasant progression for four voices,<br/>with C4 as middle C, and higher numbers showing higher octaves. Note<br/>that I show vertical intervals as integer ratios and as values in<br/>rounded cents, with rounding errors of up to one cent possible:</p><p>    G4  -- +193 -- A4<br/>(4:3/498)       (5:4/386)<br/>    D&apos;4 -- +305 -- F4<br/>(6:5/316)       (4:3/498)<br/>    B3  -- +122 -- C&apos;4<br/>(5:4/386)       (3:2/702)<br/>    G3  -- -193 -- F3</p><p>    8H            10H<br/>          (M3-5)</p><p>Let&apos;s first consider the &quot;fine-tuning,&quot; and then some general musical<br/>concepts which may explain the shorthand symbols below the example --<br/>the 8H, 10H, and (M3-5).</p><p>In Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI, a pure fifth is formed by a note on the<br/>&quot;regular&quot; lower manual plus its &quot;comma key&quot; on the second manual: thus<br/>we have G3-B3-D&apos;4-G4 for the first sonority, and F3-C&apos;4-F4-A4 for the<br/>second. A pure fourth conversely has a comma key for its _lower_ note<br/>and a regular key for its upper note: here D&apos;4-G4 and C&apos;4-F4.</p><p>Regularly spelled major thirds or tenths on each keyboard are already<br/>pure: e.g. G3-B3 and F3-A4 -- and likewise minor sixths or thirteenths.<br/>Minor thirds or tenths have a regular key for their lower note and a<br/>comma key for their upper note: e.g. B3-D&apos;4. Minor sixths or<br/>thirteenths conversely have a comma key for their lower note and a<br/>regular key for their upper note: e.g. C&apos;4-A4.</p><p>How does this kind of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; affect melodic progressions?<br/>As long as a melodic line stays on a single manual, we have the usual<br/>tempered intervals of 1/4-comma meantone: for example, usual<br/>whole-tones of around 193.16 cents in the two outer voices, G3-F3 and<br/>G4-A4. When a voice shifts between manuals, however, there occurs a<br/>variation of 1/4 syntonic comma, or ~5.38 cents, from the usual<br/>tempered interval.</p><p>Thus the tenor or second to lowest voice of this example progresses<br/>B3-C&apos;4, an interval of ~5.38 cents larger than the usual diatonic<br/>semitone in 1/4-comma of ~117.11 cents, or ~122.49 cents. Similarly,<br/>the alto or second to highest voice progresses D&apos;4-F4, a minor third<br/>at ~5.38 cents smaller than the usual meantone interval of ~310.26<br/>cents, or ~304.88 cents.</p><p>A critic might observe that an altered whole-tone such as B&apos;3-C4 is<br/>more than 10 cents wider than the already amply wide 16:15 of classic<br/>5-limit JI -- although it is still narrower than the whole-tone of<br/>19-tet or 1/3-comma meantone. This melodic stretching might be a<br/>tolerable compromise for the sake of pure concords.</p><p>Having considered the tuning, let&apos;s consider the progression itself.</p><p>In the 16th century, composers in practice and theory seek to<br/>maintain what Gioseffo Zarlino (1558) calls _harmonia perfetta_ or<br/>&quot;perfect harmony,&quot; defined as a complete sonority consisting of &quot;the<br/>third plus the fifth or sixth&quot; above the bass. In terms of later<br/>tuning theory, this might be described as a &quot;saturated 5-limit<br/>sonority.&quot;</p><p>Another theorist especially interested in keyboard composition and<br/>improvisation, Tomas de Santa Maria (1565), more specifically<br/>classifies various four-voice sonorities according to the interval<br/>between the two outer voices and the _differencias_ or adjacent<br/>intervals added by the middle voices. Among his most preferred<br/>sonorities of the &quot;first grade&quot; are three arrangements which would fit<br/>into Zarlino&apos;s &quot;third-plus-fifth&quot; category, having outer intervals of<br/>an octave, tenth, and twelfth:</p><p>G4  A4  A4<br/>D4  F4  F4<br/>B3  C3  D4<br/>G3  F3  D3</p><p>8   10  12</p><p>Santa Maria defines these _differencias_ in terms of the ascending<br/>adjacent intervals: thus we have here the octave &quot;differentiated&quot; into<br/>third, third, and fourth; the tenth into fifth, fourth, and third; and<br/>the twelfth into octave, third, and third.</p><p>Since these three &quot;differences&quot; of the octave, tenth, and twelve are<br/>much favored in practice, we can let the symbols &quot;8&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, and &quot;12&quot;<br/>stand for these specific arrangements unless otherwise qualified.</p><p>Zarlino, in discussing _harmonia perfetta_, discusses a distinction<br/>between the &quot;harmonic division&quot; of the fifth with a major third below<br/>and a minor third above (e.g. G3-B3-D4), and the &quot;arithmetic division&quot;<br/>with the minor third below and the major third above (e.g. D3-F3-A3).<br/>More generally, in any &quot;third-plus-fifth&quot; variety of sonority, the<br/>harmonic division has the major third above the bass, and the<br/>arithmetic division the minor third above the bass.</p><p>Combining the approaches of Zarlino and Santa Maria, we can classify<br/>these sonorities both by their outer intervals and &quot;differences,&quot; and<br/>by their use of the harmonic or arithmetic division, thus</p><p>G4  A4  A4<br/>D4  F4  F4<br/>B3  C3  D4<br/>G3  F3  D3</p><p>8H  10H 12A</p><p>From this viewpoint, our progression may be described as:</p><p>G4 A4<br/>D4 F3<br/>B3 C3<br/>G3 F3</p><p>8H 10H</p><p>This shorthand tells us that we are progressing from the most common<br/>difference of the octave to that of the tenth, both sonorities being<br/>harmonic divisions of the fifth (major third or tenth above bass).</p><p>Additionally, the lower two voices define a progression from major<br/>third to fifth by stepwise contrary motion, one of the standard<br/>two-voice resolutions of 3-limit Gothic music (e.g. m3-1, M3-5, m3-5,<br/>M6-8) now serving to guide progressions between the new stable 5-limit<br/>sonorities. To show both the vertical sonorities, and this guiding<br/>resolution, we can use the following shorthand, as in the example<br/>above:</p><p>G4  A4<br/>D4  F4<br/>B3  C3<br/>G3  F3</p><p>8H  10H</p><p>(M3-5)</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s second or adaptive JI tuning covers a compass of<br/>Gb-A#, it would be quite possible to implement such a tuning for<br/>Vicentino&apos;s complete enharmonic system of 31 notes per octave if we<br/>build an instrument with 62 keys per octave: the 31 notes of the lower<br/>five ranks of the instrument in Vicentino&apos;s first or fifthtone tuning,<br/>plus another 31 notes each a &quot;comma&quot; (i.e. 1/4 syntonic comma) higher.<br/>This tuning permits both fifthtone music with pure 5-limit concords,<br/>and a basic circulating temperament very close to 31-tet.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
