Thanks, everybody.</p><p>The following synopsis recapitulates and encapsulates the current<br/>concept of a raga as it is performed today:<br/>------------------------------------<br/>The rudiments of Grammar:<br/>[a] A raga is a set of notes (swara-s).<br/>[b] The number of notes (swara-s) required of a raga is at least 5.<br/>(There are exceptions.)<br/>[c] A raga can never exclude Sa, because the remaining notes exist<br/>only in relation to Sa. The Sa is called the tonic, or the key.<br/>[d] A raga cannot omit both Ma (the fourth) and Pa (the fifth) at the<br/>same time.<br/>[e] A raga revolves around two principal notes (swara-s). The more<br/>important of these two is called the Sonant (vadi); the other, the<br/>Consonant (samvadi).  The remaining notes (swara-s) in a raga are<br/>called assonants (anuvadi). A prosonant (pranuvadi) is an assonant of<br/>importance. The notes (swara-s) not included in the raga are called<br/>dissonants (vivadi). Though not included as such, a vivadi quite often<br/>becomes a part of a raga, because it beautifies the raga.<br/>[f] A raga cannot include two variations (i.e. sharp and flat) of the<br/>same note simultaneously. (There are exceptions.)<br/>[g] The time theory is an important traditional consideration for a<br/>raga to be performed.</p><p>The Aesthetics of improvisation:<br/>A raga exists eternally as a &grave;prototype&apos;. It manifests itself during<br/>its performance. Performance of a raga is the improvisation of its<br/>constituent notes, with or without accompaniment of a taal (roughly,<br/>rhythm).  (Improvisation is variously called elaboration, expansion,<br/>extemporization, amplification, development, interpretation,<br/>unfolding, evolution; aalapa, badhat, vistaara, etc.) The<br/>improvisation takes place while a raga is being performed, by the<br/>process of intuitive nascence: there is no prior plan, nor any score<br/>to follow.  It is ad-lib, extemporaneous.  It is done without any<br/>rehearsal.  It takes place at the scene of action -- on the stage. It<br/>is an on-site, real-time, and spontaneous exposition of the aesthetics<br/>of the raga. It is the nascent unfolding of the raga: the<br/>interpretation of the raga comes into existence while it is being<br/>performed.</p><p>But there are definite rules of aesthetics-grammar to be observed, like:<br/>taking the included notes in certain order only. This includes many<br/>&apos;jumps&apos; and &apos;gaps&apos;, because the improvisation is not linear or<br/>sequential;<br/>emphasizing, repeating, staying on certain notes;<br/>de-emphasizing certain notes;<br/>omitting the excluded notes;<br/>and yet including any of the excluded note(s) in an aesthetically<br/>pleasing way.</p><p>But a really good performance is the result of great talent, a great<br/>guru, consistent, hard work, and a lot of experience. It requires<br/>assiduous work, courage, and thorough learning. It demands great<br/>training; exceptional creative ability and natural talent; thorough,<br/>intuitive grasp of the aesthetics of the raga; and natural flair for<br/>effective presentation.</p><p>The technique of improvisation has two main components, namely<br/>expansion (baDhat), and creative growth (upaj). Thus, improvisation is<br/>two-fold. On the one hand, it keeps on increasing its area of<br/>development, one small step at a time. On the other hand, it reaches<br/>the maximum creative depth at every step of development.</p><p>Improvisation means weaving patterns around the sonant (vadi),<br/>consonant (samvadi) and prosonant (pranuvadi). taking into account the<br/>following direction:</p><p>Octave: Lower, to middle, to higher<br/>Notes: only very few, to a few, to more, to many<br/>Complexity: very simple, to simple, to increasing complexity, to very<br/>complex<br/>Speed: Quite slow, to moderate, to fast, to very fast<br/>Overlapping: almost absent, to some, to much<br/>Taans: very few and very small in very small area, to more profuse and<br/>longer and in wider area, to many and quite long and complex and<br/>sweeping all areas.</p><p>Use of various aesthetic tools (alankar-s, gamaka etc).<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>I hope the above synopsis is helpful.</p><p>Thanks and regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
