padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to Cameron for the idea of testing the scale with high sustain.&nbsp; In the version I used an infinitely sustained/looped ocarina as an instrument.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound example of a 9-tone scale-chord within the octave is<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/qp9eak">http://tinyurl.com/qp9eak</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note, unlike my PHI scales, this is based on the formula (1/octave)^x+1 and produces straight forward JI intervals.&nbsp; This generation method, as you can see, is very much like the one I favor for PHI scales: (1/PHI)^x+1.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale used in the example is<br/>1<br/>1.0625&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17/16<br/>1.125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9/8<br/>1.25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/4<br/>1.41176&nbsp; 24/17<br/>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3/2 (this is the period, rather than the 2/1 octave)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW Marcel, I&apos;m pretty sure this will cast at least some doubt to whether the idea of a chord-scale is un-realstic.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will agree this (nor anything else) is quite as consonant as the 1 5/4 3/2 triad...however:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; A) It seems at least nearing the consonance of a major 7th chord to my ears.&nbsp; Makes mathematical sense too: everything except the 24/17 is in common with the x/16 harmonic series and the 24/17 has a common tie in that it is simply 1.5 (scale period) / 1.0625 (17/16).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Note that tension can be added by doing things like playing notes at higher amplitudes, altering the rhythm to something quicker, altering the level of attack in the instruments and more...surely picking &quot;sour tones&quot; need not be the only way of promoting tension in good compositional practice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even if you want sour tones...you can always add extra notes to the scale such as 4/3 and 6/5 plus noble mediants of existing tones in the scale to the scale to create more dissonance at will.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2009 1:52:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
