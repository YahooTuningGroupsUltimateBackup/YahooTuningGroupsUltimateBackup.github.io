IMHO.</p><p>Partch wrote in 1967 to Allen Strange (page 410 of Enclosures 3):<br/>    &quot;The  winter of 1937-38 I heard both electronic music and common sounds<br/>music, recorded on acetate records, by a young man in Los Angeles (he later<br/>became Schonberg&apos;s secretary).  It was a new, fresh idea, and I was<br/>enchanted.  I think I can say flatly that I was the only musician who gave<br/>the man any encouragement.  But he got nowhere with his ideas.  Eighteen<br/>years later a group in Paris became famous from New York to California for<br/>doing exactly the same thing, not as well, in my opinion.  Then Columbia and<br/>Princeton wanted to do something similar and went to Rockefeller.  They did<br/>not say: Los Angeles has done it, therefore it must be good.  They said,<br/>Paris and Milan and Cologne have done it, therefore it must be good.  When I<br/>am pointed out as the Anti Man I hope that someone will add that I am<br/>probably the first musician in the United States of America to give solid<br/>encouragement to both electronic music and common-sounds music.  H.P. &quot;</p><p>    Since Otto Luening&apos;s introduction of electronic music on television in<br/>1952 is being celebrated at Lincoln Center in its current electronic music<br/>festival as the real start for electronic music, it seems increasingly<br/>reasonable to consider Harry Partch a pioneer in electronic concepts.  It<br/>also may make one reconsider the use of an electronic &quot;chromelodeon&quot; in<br/>contemporary performance, as well.</p><p>    Elsewhere (p. 401 of Enclosures 3) Partch further amplified his thoughts<br/>on the issue of electronics in a San Francisco publication &quot;Truth-In-Music&quot;:<br/>    &quot;I&apos;m against total electronic music and I don&apos;t believe it will catch on<br/>totally in the future.  Philosophically, there is magic in anything you<br/>touch, be it a string, a piece of bamboo or an electron tube.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
