Unfortunately, the opposite bias seems to be in evidence with respect to people&apos;s stated preferences, at least on these lists, with more people expressing a fondness for slightly sharp fifths over slightly flat ones. One reason I used hemifamity (5120/5103 planar) temperament was just its slightly sharp tendency, with the 3 and 7 tending sharp.</p><p>Another planar temperament with 3 and 7 tending sharp is octagar (4000/3969) temperament. If you orthogonally project in Euclidean interval/tuning space perpendicular to both 4000/3969 and 2, you project the 7-limit lattice onto a two-dimensional one. The two closest lattice points to the origin are 21/20 and either 63/50 or 63/40. Choosing the former, which is nearly perpendicular (97.7 degrees) to 21/20, we obtain a lattice basis. Using the facts that (21/20)(63/50)(4000/3969) = 4/3, (63/50)^2 * (4000/3969) = 8/5 and (21/20)^2/(63/50) = 8/7 we can locate the 7-limit pitch classes on the lattice, mapping them to lattice points via the mapping [&lt;0 -1 0 2|, &lt;0 -1 -2 -1|].</p><p>If you sharpen both 3 and 7 by (4000/3969)^(1/6) and leave 2 and 5 alone, you obtain a fifth in the 704-705 cent range promoted by Margo, and you also obtain the 7-limit minimax tuning. 162, 189 or 230 equal also give tunings in that range. If you want something with the fifth a little less sharp, the 9-limit minimax tuning has a 3 sharp by only (4000/3969)^(1/8) and penalizes 7 by having it sharp by twice that amount.</p><p>Another feature of octagar temperament is that the 5/4-sqrt(8/5)-sqrt(8/5) version of the augmented triad is all over the place, being so low in complexity. Has this chord received any attention?</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2010 2:14:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>I intended to post this to tuning-math, but Fate decreed otherwise.
