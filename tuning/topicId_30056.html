Quite simply, it&apos;s where the<br/>two 2 steps of 72 fall. Because BJ isn&apos;t an equal temperament, I have to<br/>choose where to start and that presents a problem for me because in<br/>order to work with a completely new scale I like to think in terms of a<br/>root. So it seemed natural to start with the root on A440, with 2 steps<br/>of 72 above and below.</p><p>By choosing to work with the notation system centred on the D-A fifth,<br/>my &apos;root&apos; is F]. This is strange to me as I&apos;m thinking of everything<br/>rooted on A. But I&apos;m getting used to it. None of this would matter if I<br/>wasn&apos;t building and tuning several instruments, some to subsets of BJ.<br/>The last thing you want is to tune up 36 steel bars to a set of<br/>frequencies only to find you&apos;re out of sync with your other instruments.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
