Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1999 7:27:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary,</p><p>&gt;I use a Mac, and I&apos;m 90% certain that the Mac version of Netscape supports<br/>&gt;WAV files.  I have not downloaded any audio-playing plug-ins, and yet have<br/>&gt;played audio from at least one web page - a web page that also played fine<br/>&gt;from my SPARCstation at work.  It seems unlikely that Netscape for the Mac<br/>&gt;supports something more exotic than WAV, so I&apos;d think it likely that the<br/>audio<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve played were WAV files.</p><p>It is certainly possible that Netscape/Mac supports .wav files, since we&apos;ve<br/>been inundated with them (courtesy Bill Gates). The original Mac audio file<br/>format was .aiff (Audio Interchange File Format), which has been well<br/>supported by players/plugins. From the early days of the Net, when UNIX<br/>stations ruled, the .au file format still hangs on, though much less<br/>supported due to its lesser sound qualities.</p><p>More than we *all* wanted to know about audio/web file formats, Jon.  :)</p><p>&gt;   Oooo cool!  Where can I find them those players (URL)?  Everytime I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;attempted to download a Real Audio player, the first question they asked was<br/>&gt;&quot;what&apos;s your credit card number?&quot;.</p><p>Should be able to get the RealPlayer at <a href="http://www.real.com/">http://www.real.com/</a>  If they have<br/>somehow started charging, I&apos;ll be surprised.</p><p>As to &apos;where to do a web site&apos;, how about some of the free places, like<br/>Geocities or Tripod? I know they&apos;re supported by ads, but they&apos;d be<br/>&apos;relatively&apos; free. Whoever decides to be Webmaster could have people email<br/>him/her the web pages and/or graphics/soundfiles as attachments, and he/she<br/>could upload them. And, yes, I&apos;d expect the submitters to do the work on<br/>the pages/graphics/etc so you wouldn&apos;t have to; if you can do the math for<br/>non-12tet like some of the folks here, hacking html in a wysiwyg editor<br/>should be a piece of pastry. (I sometimes hand code only because it&apos;s the<br/>only way to really produce clean, optimized html, as yet. But I use good<br/>tools...)</p><p>Sound like a bit of work? Yep. I know, having had a site up for almost 3<br/>years running. But the words of thanks that come back make it worthwhile,<br/>if you&apos;ve got the time, energy, etc.</p><p>All: lest we forget what started this, Gary&apos;s idea was to go beyond ascii<br/>and when talking about music and intonation to be able to HEAR music and<br/>intonation, and it is a worth and noble effort!!! If I didn&apos;t already have<br/>a site to curate, I&apos;d take it on, but if someone else wants to be<br/>webmaster, I&apos;ll certainly try and help somehow. In any event, Gary, keep up<br/>the brainstorming til we/you find a way...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. to Allen: Yep, I mis-remembered the lumbering circuit-boards -- the<br/>big beast at SDSU was a Buchla setup. I didn&apos;t spend a lot of time in<br/>there, mainly when Pete Middleton showed me some basic patching and I went<br/>nuts with ... oh well, it was a long time ago!  :)<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Jonathan M.

Perhaps some sort of web-based<br/>repository for microtonal illustrations more in conjunction with this list could<br/>be my next such effort.</p><p>   Hmm...  Let me think about that a bit.</p></div>
