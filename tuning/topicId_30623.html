He has<br/>commented on, with Amiya<br/>Dasgupta, on how the Persian 17 tuning was adopted to North India. Along<br/>with personal<br/>communications which includes those head of the UCLA music department,<br/>there are also others at<br/>the University of Washington, plus all the recent records, that refer to<br/>the 17 as the reference<br/>for tuning.  One of the reasons that Wilson, or myself or few others<br/>have proposed a mid east<br/>tuning is that we recognize that the intonational practices very greatly<br/>around the traditional<br/>pitches due to regional taste. One Palestinian musician told me he could<br/>tell where a musician was<br/>from within 20 miles by intonation and ornament. 24 ET began as a<br/>theoretical proposition and<br/>works well in cross over areas. Although they mention the use of 24 ET<br/>and yamaha uses this for it<br/>instruments in this neck of the woods, the records show its use is very<br/>very limited. You might<br/>like to look at The music of the Arabs by Touma. Rod Poole also has<br/>quite a bit of writings by<br/>persians blasting 24 ET . I have yet to see any that does the opposite.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2001 11:41:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig -- I&apos;m surprised to see you leaning on Western academia for<br/>support of your contentions! How odd!</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Rod Poole also has<br/>&gt; quite a bit of writings by<br/>&gt; persians blasting 24 ET .</p><p>Persian music is a whole other animal. Their intervals are clearly<br/>very far from 24-tET. Why did you change the subject line to &quot;Persian<br/>tuning&quot;, you canniving little devil! But in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria,<br/>Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula, the maqamat that are used are<br/>_roughly_ subsets of 24-tET. Note that I say _roughly_. The 17-tone<br/>medieval Arabic tuning, however, fits none of these cultures at the<br/>present time (not sure if you were saying they do with your<br/>references to Western academic institutions -- you weren&apos;t clear).</p></div>
