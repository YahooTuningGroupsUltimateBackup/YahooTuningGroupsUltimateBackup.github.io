I can hear the low combination tone rumble with all of them,<br/>suggesting that the fifth is &quot;right on.&quot; However, the rumble is clearest<br/>with Jerry0, suggesting that it, too, is JI. If it isn&apos;t, I&apos;ll be *very*<br/>surprised.</p><p>My next &quot;method&quot; was to sing &quot;my third&quot; into the example while it is<br/>sounding, then stop singing and see if the sounding third is higher or lower<br/>than mine. This was hard to hear and my impression kept changing from one<br/>pass to another on the same item. Overall, my impression was generally that<br/>the example third was higher than the one I had sung; but I usually wasn&apos;t<br/>sure because it sounded different when I just played it and didn&apos;t sing.</p><p>Then I just listened to them quickly one after another, trying to see which<br/>ones would be most &quot;acceptable&quot; if sung by my singers. 4 and 7 sound pretty<br/>good to me. I wouldn&apos;t stop the rehearsal for them. 5 and 6 are less good.<br/>1, 2 and 3 would make me stop and ask the singers to &quot;try it again, this<br/>time with their ears open.&quot;</p><p>Finally, I sang &quot;my third&quot; before playing the item (by memory of where the<br/>root and fifth were after multi playings), and then played the item to see<br/>how close each third was to my anticipation of where it &quot;should&quot; be. Again,<br/>4 and 7 were the clear winners.</p><p>So, Paul, don&apos;t give the details quite yet. Let me try again over the<br/>weekend and see if I get similar results. I&apos;ll do my best to be specific<br/>about &quot;higher,&quot; &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;how much.&quot;</p><p>Thanks a bunch for doing this. It&apos;ll be interesting to see what the numbers<br/>are.</p><p>If you still have the energy, interest and time, you might consider redoing<br/>the items with the root and fifth sounding alone for about three seconds (so<br/>I can establish my &quot;well-tuned&quot; third), then add the third for about five<br/>seconds, then drop out the root and fifth so I can see where the third is<br/>sounding in relation to &quot;my&quot; third. Whaddaya think?</p><p>Another option would be to supply the root and fifth *below* the third<br/>(where it would fall in the partial series 2/3/5). I find it&apos;s much easier<br/>to hear and tune in that configuration.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=34726 href="#34726">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 6:32:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, Paul, don&apos;t give the details quite yet.
