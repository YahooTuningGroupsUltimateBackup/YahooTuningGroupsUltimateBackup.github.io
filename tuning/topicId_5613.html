<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>archives in HTML & other ramblings</h1><h3>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;drew_skyfyre@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/1999 6:33:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greetings All,</p><p>I suppose I could be timid about this and once again let the prospect of an<br/>easy to access, searchable, HTML archive of the Tuning List fade into the<br/>mist. But I&apos;m not gonna do that !:-)</p><p>Instead I&apos;m going to talk a little about the matter of putting the archives<br/>in an easy to use format, this list itself, &amp; a few related subjects.<br/>This is the first time I&apos;ve felt the need to post anything even remotely<br/>heated. Hopefully the last. I&apos;m quite nervous about sending this out, but<br/>waht the heck. Needs to be said.</p><p>&gt; Personally, I don&apos;t have a big problem with the *content* of those postings<br/>&gt; ending up somewhere, but there are issues to ponder before you simply plop<br/>&gt; them on a web site somewhere. It isn&apos;t too much to ask, I think, to<br/>&gt; consider and respect the wishes of the people that contributed to the Mills<br/>&gt; tuning list in these matters.</p><p>Jonathan, you make it sound like I&apos;m planning to violate some kind of sacred<br/>oath or something. This isn&apos;t a fraternity or a cult or anything, is it ?<br/>I thought it was meant to be an open forum for the discussion &amp; promotion of<br/>microtonality. Otherwise all the useful info would only be in $50+ books<br/>that no one is going to buy off-hand (if they can afford it) &amp; isnt easy to<br/>get hold off. And then where would we be ?</p><p>Speaking of $50+ books &amp; such : has anyone considered the prospect of making<br/>your books, dissertations, etc. available over the interent for a lower<br/>price (i.e. shareware), so that a greater no. of people can benefit ? 3<br/>cheers for Monzo &amp; Patrick O-L. They didn&apos;t have to make it available for<br/>free.</p><p>When I first mentioned it, I asked if it was o.k. No one said anything.<br/>One person did email me privately to say it would be a good thing.<br/>Yes, I suppose I should have asked more clearly, but if Jonathan caught my<br/>line in the later post, he or someone else could have cought the original<br/>post where I shouted &quot; I FOUND THE ARCHIVES !!!&quot; &amp; said :</p><p>&quot;If it&apos;s o.k, I&apos;m gonna have the entire archive up on the web, searchable,<br/>and also downloadable in reasonably sized zipped files.&quot;</p><p>And notice, it was me, the broke, struggling  musician idiot sitting in his<br/>room in Goa, India who took the time &amp; trouble to track the archives down,<br/>when no help was forthcoming from any quarter, simply because I recognized<br/>the importance of the archives. And this is not the first time I or anyone<br/>else asked where to find the archives.</p><p>It just seems so damned idiotic to not allow the older messages to be made<br/>available on the web, since this is a public forum, and the archives are<br/>ALREADY public !</p><p>&gt; However, it would seem that any one objection should be considered reason<br/>&gt; enough to NOT publish them publicly.<br/>If you mean that if even one person objects to their posts being made<br/>public, I emphatically disagree. This is a *public* forum. As a matter of<br/>principle it should be wrong for anyone to prevent these archives being<br/>made easily accessible.</p><p>And they already are public &amp; accessible to anyone who wants them.<br/>If someone has no desire for their postings to be public, they should *not*<br/>be on a public forum. The current incarnation of the list IS on the WWW.</p><p>At <a href="http://www.onelist.com/archive/tuning">http://www.onelist.com/archive/tuning</a></p></div><h3>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;drew_skyfyre@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/1999 6:10:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Since all subscribers to the Mills list initially received an email<br/>&gt; indicating that the list was archived, it should not be problematic to post<br/>&gt; the archives to a new web site. However, once the archives are posted, it<br/>&gt; would be a good gesture to offer all contributors the opportunity to remove<br/>&gt; any of their own postings. Any other kinds of editing or revisions of the<br/>&gt; texts would be too much work, but the opportunity to retract an item should<br/>&gt; be reserved for every writer.</p><p>Retractions ? Yes.<br/>Corrections ? Yes.</p><p>Deletions ? No. No. No.<br/>Alterations ? No. No. No.</p><p>Given the threaded nature of a *discussion* list, such an exercise would be<br/>counterproductive in the extreme &amp; contrary to the spririt of an open (&amp;<br/>open minded) public discussion list. Even the littlest contribution to any<br/>topic under discussion, no matter how erroneous/misinformed, is integral to<br/>the whole. And what would be accomplish by such deletions ? Other than<br/>displaying a certain lack of integrity...</p><p>You might as well delete/throw away the entire archives, why not stop<br/>archiving altogether, just because you may change your mind about something<br/>you said at a later date, or suddenly don&apos;t feel like sharing your<br/>knowledge.</p><p>Take a look at the situation with newsgroups : Go to<br/><a href="http://www.deja.com">http://www.deja.com</a> Every belch uttered on countless newsgroups is recorded<br/>for posterity. Digests starting from Dec 1998 are currently archived &amp;<br/>searchable on the web automatically in HTML at<br/><a href="http://www.onelist.com/archive/tuning">http://www.onelist.com/archive/tuning</a> , which makes objections to making<br/>earlier posts even easier to use start to take on a funny smell...</p><p>However, to get back to the issue brought up by Daniel, I do have a<br/>solution. Nothing radical, just the same as is done in most forms of<br/>journalism, though a discussion list is not a journal/publication in the<br/>conventional sense.</p><p>I can set up pages for errata &amp; retractions.</p><p>The Errata page would enable anyone to post a correction to something they<br/>read in the archives, wich could even mean a message only a week old. I can<br/>set this up as a bulletin board.</p><p>Retractions, well, this could also be done as a bulletin board, so any<br/>author of any message in the archives can post an appropriate message.</p><p>The title/subject of each errata/retraction posting can be the date &amp; digest<br/>number of the tuning digest in question. if it is for an older message from<br/>1994, before there were digests, simply put the date of the message. The<br/>first line of the post itself can state the actual subject matter in one<br/>line.</p><p>And I&apos;m curious, these things have been there since 1994. Any number of<br/>people have been downloading &amp; reading them over the past 6 years.<br/>Also, a number of messages from 1995 have been on an HTML archive on, I<br/>think, a server in Finland. And in all this time, no one has had a problem<br/>with them being available to anyone &amp; everyone as it should be. Why the fuss<br/>now ? All I am offering to do is make them easily accessible, more useful, &amp;<br/>of greater benefit to microtonalists of every level, everywhere.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

All I&apos;ve<br/>asked is that you consider a couple of issues.</p><p>&gt;Jonathan, you make it sound like I&apos;m planning to violate some kind of sacred<br/>&gt;oath or something. This isn&apos;t a fraternity or a cult or anything, is it ?<br/>&gt;I thought it was meant to be an open forum for the discussion &amp; promotion of<br/>&gt;microtonality.</p><p>No, not a cult, but there are important differences between a mailing list<br/>one subscribes to, especially a non-commercial one, and an entity on the<br/>www. The Mills list was certainly &apos;open&apos;, but to those that subscribed.</p><p>&gt;When I first mentioned it, I asked if it was o.k. No one said anything.<br/>&gt;One person did email me privately to say it would be a good thing.</p><p>Somehow I must have missed your original posting, as I would have sent<br/>similar ideas to you.</p><p>&gt;Yes, I suppose I should have asked more clearly, but if Jonathan caught my<br/>&gt;line in the later post, he or someone else could have cought the original<br/>&gt;post where I shouted &quot; I FOUND THE ARCHIVES !!!&quot; &amp; said :</p><p>Well, it could have been that I&apos;ve been accessing the archives ever since<br/>the list moved, and it didn&apos;t seem like a big deal to find them. But I&apos;m<br/>GLAD you found them.</p><p>&gt;It just seems so damned idiotic to not allow the older messages to be made<br/>&gt;available on the web, since this is a public forum, and the archives are<br/>&gt;ALREADY public !</p><p>Um, what do you mean by public? They are accessable, but only when you send<br/>a request - they are not browsable. When I posted to the list I had a<br/>pretty good idea where the intended reading audience was, and wrote<br/>accordingly. But, as Dan Wolf pointed out, I really doubt that anyone would<br/>object to the content of their postings being more easily accessed, me<br/>included.</p><p>&gt;And they already are public &amp; accessible to anyone who wants them.</p><p>Yes, but they are on servers, searchable by human interaction, and NOT<br/>sitting on a web page somewhere, easy fodder for spiders and spambots to<br/>pull out even more lists of millions of email addresses. Please note: this<br/>is my only emphatic point.</p><p>&gt;If someone has no desire for their postings to be public, they should *not*<br/>&gt;be on a public forum. The current incarnation of the list IS on the WWW.</p><p>Yes, and look what someone has done with a little perl (or some other) script:</p><p>13.

I don&apos;t know how long<br/>you&apos;ve been online, but the longer you are at one email address, and the<br/>more often it shows up on the net, the more dung drops into your inbox.<br/>THAT is my only request: in return for all the great(?) information you are<br/>able to access from the couple of years of the tuning list at Mills, it<br/>doesn&apos;t seem too much to ask that you afford the same courtesy and<br/>protection of the list members by scrubbing the addresses. This is exactly<br/>what Onelist does when it makes the archives truly PUBLIC (as opposed to<br/>the subscribable list). It really doesn&apos;t seem too much to ask, and it&apos;s a<br/>task any good webmaster can accomplish.</p><p>And as one last bit, if no one has mentioned it, there are gaps in the<br/>Mills archives (and always will be) due to their servers going down a<br/>couple of times and old messages being lost. Still *plenty* of info there.<br/>I pity the person who wades through some of the screaming fits... :)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.
