However,<br/>the chord relations are based on the chain of fifths, whereas the<br/>native chord relations of 7-limit music involves the whole 7-limit<br/>diamond. (I also wonder incidentally if 6:7:9:10 gets much play in<br/>barbershop.)</p><p>If take an otonal tetrad, and look at all the otonal tetrads which, up<br/>to octave equivalence, share a note with it, we get twelve chords.<br/>These define twenty-eight notes, with thirteen otonal tetrads and ten<br/>utonal tetrads, which I think would be a nice addition to the Scala<br/>directory. It would be very interesting to see if a barbershop quartet<br/>could be induced to sing music in a scale such as this, and it would<br/>also be interesting to know how easily they could learn some such<br/>notation as Sagittal for that purpose. I could certainly write such<br/>music, if someone wanted to try singing it.</p><p>! notchedcube.scl<br/>Otonal tetrads sharing a note with the root tetrad, a notched chord cube<br/>28<br/>!<br/>49/48<br/>25/24<br/>21/20<br/>15/14<br/>35/32<br/>9/8<br/>8/7<br/>7/6<br/>6/5<br/>49/40<br/>5/4<br/>9/7<br/>21/16<br/>4/3<br/>7/5<br/>10/7<br/>35/24<br/>3/2<br/>49/32<br/>25/16<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>12/7<br/>7/4<br/>25/14<br/>9/5<br/>15/8<br/>2</p></div>
