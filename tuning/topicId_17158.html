The monitor<br/> would be mounted so that it faced up.</p><p>The great advantage for such a keyboard<br/>is that it can be continuous or discrete.<br/>Any grid or key pattern can be programming<br/>So it is microtuning capable. The possibilities<br/>would be endless.</p><p>Back to the real world! The technology at<br/>present can only recognize one finger<br/>touch art a time! Sorry to disappoint<br/>any one.</p><p>Vas</p></div>
