Would you have musicians<br/>&gt; that know only one new tuning?  If you want many musicians that can play in<br/>&gt; many systems, then you need to keep the 400 cents as an anchor for the mind.<br/>&gt; Instead of thinking with a bias either for or against conventional tuning,<br/>&gt; try this:  music is NEVER exactly played in 12-tET since expressivity is<br/>&gt; added which means that notes have direction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thinking in 1200 is not thinking in 12.  Playing a just third as -14 cents to<br/>&gt; a standard will give every bit of 5/4.  If individuals insist on changing the<br/>&gt; rules for mapping microtonal intervals to the mind there will be more<br/>&gt; provincialism if there are performances at all.  I have available thousands<br/>&gt; of musicians that can understand pitch deviations from a standard.  New<br/>&gt; notation, as entertaining as Gardner Read&apos;s book may be, will not aid in<br/>&gt; performances, as easily as it can hinder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Johnny, your comment resonated with my own concern regarding this topic. In<br/>my experience, sensitive group singers move pitches constantly while seeking<br/>&quot;best&quot; tuning. Sometimes this &quot;flexible&quot; tuning agrees (apparently) with JI<br/>and sometimes not. Soloists, on the other hand frequently &quot;bend&quot; pitches<br/>from a standard (as you state) in an expressive manner (described by Pablo<br/>Casals and others).</p><p>As I implied in an earlier post, notational devices to suggest artistic<br/>pitch deviations might make a considerable contribution toward more<br/>expressive performances. At minimum, it would alert the performing public<br/>that there are more than 12 pitches available to them. Whether specific<br/>*amounts* of deviation can be (or should be) successfully communicated<br/>remains to be seen.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/11/2002 5:47:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 2/9/02 6:12:44 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:stg3music@earthlink.net">stg3music@earthlink.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Whether specific<br/>&gt; *amounts* of deviation can be (or should be) successfully communicated<br/>&gt; remains to be seen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Gerald, at least with instruments, &quot;specific&quot; amounts of deviation have been<br/>seen many, many times over.
