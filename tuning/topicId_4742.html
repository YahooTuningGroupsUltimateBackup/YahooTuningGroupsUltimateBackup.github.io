It&apos;s definitely in 31tet but Haba&apos;s non-thematic<br/>style and absence of a cohesive harmonic technique doesn&apos;t allow him to take<br/>much advantage, if any, of the abundant resources of 31tet.  Is anyone else<br/>out there as consistantly disappointed by Haba&apos;s music as I am?</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div>
