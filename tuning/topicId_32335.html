In the case of<br/>Ensoniq&apos;s ASR-10 for example, which I&apos;ve used quite a bit, you pretty much<br/>have to create separate versions of each instrument for each tuning, since<br/>you have to redistribute the boundaries of each &quot;wavesample&quot; to match the<br/>tuning.  I would therefore do that and create an easily-loadable &quot;bank&quot; of<br/>so-customized sounds for each particular composition I work on.</p><p>To put it another way, when I work on, or play, a given composition, I load<br/>the sequencer document into my computer and load the bank on the ASR-10.<br/>That&apos;s very easy once you set it up the first time, but you end up with<br/>lots of copies of what are, conceptually, the same sound.  (Actually, I end<br/>up doing other customizations to the sounds to make them more appropriate<br/>for that particular composition.)</p><p>Anyway, I now have several synthesizers that don&apos;t really allow you to edit<br/>tuning tables from the front panel, and in fact rely strictly upon SysEx<br/>messages.</p><p>My question then is, what is the usual means of dealing with such SysEx<br/>messages?  I&apos;m guessing that, assuming that the synth includes the tuning<br/>information in a MIDI patch dump, the preferred approach would be to fire<br/>up a MIDI patch librarian to configure your MIDI instruments for the<br/>particular composition.  Am I guessing correctly?  Since I&apos;ve always done<br/>all synthesizer-internal stuff in the synth itself, I have to confess to<br/>embarrassingly limited knowledge of patch librarian programs, although my<br/>knowledge of MIDI and synths in general is pretty good.</p></div><h3><a id=32337 href="#32337">ðŸ”—</a>John Loffink &#x3C;jloffink@austin.rr.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2002 12:52:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, you want a universal patch librarian.
