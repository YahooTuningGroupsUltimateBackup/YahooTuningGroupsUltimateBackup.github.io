Wired Planet is excellent mp3<br/>streaming software and a set of internet radio stations that play very<br/>innovative music in many genres.</p><p>Haverstick did complain about the backbiting on the list, but he was<br/>known to mix it up himself. He quit the list mainly because he is<br/>not interested in the the type of mathematical music theory that grows<br/>here.</p><p>Anyhow, I think the discussions here are important and will help shape the<br/>history of the modern microtonal movement. We need theorists, performers,<br/>evangalists, composers, dabblers and all manner of enthusiasts. People on<br/>this forum discuss what is of interest to them, and there is nothing<br/>forcing the mathematical theory content of the list. If you are a newcomer<br/>to the list, please do not be afraid to post anything tuning related. The<br/>roughnecks on  the list have been self chastised and may be counted on to<br/>give polite and thoughtful replies.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div>
