And the more random scales one makes, the quicker one<br/>learns what one likse and what one doesn&apos;t like in scales, which<br/>should help one&apos;s theoretical scale-constructing activities<br/>immensely, and perhaps induce them to reflect one&apos;s personal<br/>aesthetic sensibilities more directly.</p></div><h3><a id=22483 href="#22483">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/11/2001 2:49:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff wrote:</p><p>&gt; And so I realized that not only are there no bad scales,<br/>&gt; but that randomly chosen scales are pretty good too as<br/>&gt; long as you are not afraid of them.</p><p>Yes!  I found this as well, some time back.  I got a random number<br/>generator to design the scales for me.  It was a way of testing whether<br/>all the &quot;melodic&quot; criteria for assessing scales were really important for<br/>melody, or if any old pitches would work.  They do!</p><p>I did find that generating numbers from 0 to 1 and placing them within the<br/>octave meant that they tended to cluster together, which I didn&apos;t like.<br/>So I randomised the deviation from 12-equal instead, to +/- 50 cents.<br/>That worked great.</p><p>Harmony&apos;s a different matter.  Most chords sounded awful, so you do need<br/>to think about that.  You could work out timbres to fit a random scale,<br/>but that&apos;s taking a good thing to far.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=22486 href="#22486">ðŸ”—</a>J Scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2001 3:02:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[graham on aleatoric scales:]<br/>&gt; Harmony&apos;s a different matter.

With the xylophone its less of<br/>an issue since I seldom play more than two notes at once,<br/>and when I do things are hunky-dory on account of the<br/>inharmonic overtones, but with the harp, chords do take<br/>some &apos;getting used to&apos;.

The idea is<br/>to score the scale according to how close to equal it&apos;s steps are.  And<br/>then it is assumed that the more equal they are the better the scale is<br/>melodically.</p><p>In fact I find an inequality is a good thing.  Pythagorean diatonics are<br/>already improper.

I think not!</p><p>All these measures are more relevant to notation, where if you have an<br/>improper scale it will likely be heard as a subset of a wider scale, or<br/>generalised diatonic music.  If you want to transpose a melody<br/>diatonically within a scale, it helps if the steps are roughly equal.</p><p>           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=22555 href="#22555">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2001 9:56:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham!<br/>    Could not agree more.
