This is terrific. What I&apos;m afraid of, though, is<br/>that *mathematically* one can define plenty of other non-trivial<br/>equivalence relations in pitch space (of course one can). It&apos;s<br/>important, I feel, to emphasize that of these, only octave-<br/>equivalence corresponds to an actual perceived similarity, rather<br/>universallly accepted by musicians, and whose<br/>biological/psychological origin may (or may not) have been accounted<br/>for by Terhardt. This &quot;special&quot; equivalence relation then leads to<br/>the helical model of pitch/chroma that I described. Finally, this<br/>construct allows us, where it is appropriate (say if we are<br/>interested in octave-repeating tuning systems), to abstract the<br/>chroma concept away from pitch (something that cannot be acheived<br/>with actual tones, except the rather artificial Shepard tones), and<br/>to construct theoretical &quot;castles&quot; such as periodicity blocks, linear<br/>temperaments, evoking &quot;odd-limit&quot; consonance measures, etc. . . . I&apos;m<br/>trying to share with Jeremy my confidence that we are not making any<br/>illegal logical &quot;leaps&quot; in so doing, that we are not over-relying on<br/>an imperfect mathematical model (in particular, the &quot;imperfect<br/>equivalence&quot; that bothers Jeremy) and incorporating unseen implicit<br/>assumptions whose validity may be questionable (or whatever it is<br/>Jeremy is afraid of) . . .

The helix I refer to is a model of<br/>&gt; certain psychological sensations associated with the pitch<br/>&gt; continuum.<br/>&gt; The model can be stated in mathematically very precise terms.</p><p>JG: But in terms which does not comport with 2^N, right?</p><p>&gt; The<br/>&gt; similarity relation which concerns us corresponds mathematically to<br/>&gt; the equality of _angular position_, but not necessarily _height_,<br/>&gt; along the helix.</p><p>JG: So your &quot;slinky&quot; is &quot;stretch-able&quot; (in &quot;height along the<br/>helix) depending upon the various measured phenomena to be<br/>explained?

It is _not_ a question of pure<br/>&gt; mathematics -- pure mathematics fails to decide between falsifiable<br/>&gt; theories in the &quot;hard sciences&quot;, let alone the &quot;soft sciences&quot; such<br/>&gt; as psychology.</p><p>JG: My original interest and concern has been (and remains)<br/>the degree of precision with which conceptual models of musical<br/>*systems* comport with what listeners report as &quot;similarities&quot;.<br/>If *perceptual* &quot;chroma-octaves&quot; are not equivalent to *numerical-<br/>octaves* described by poweres of 2^N, so be it.

Another possible basis would be if<br/>&gt;one<br/>&gt; &gt; decided beforehand that one wishes to have an octave-repeating<br/>&gt;scale<br/>&gt; &gt; or tuning system. Either of these are perfectly good<br/>justifications<br/>&gt; &gt; for making use of an octave equivalence relation, and dealing<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch classes instead of pitches. If one does not wish to do so,<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s no big deal, one can proceed and build all kinds of<br/>systems<br/>&gt; &gt; (as Gene has hinted on the tuning-math list) without making any<br/>use<br/>&gt; &gt; whatsoever of octave-equivalence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: The simple original question was: does 2^N accurately describe<br/>&gt; our perception of equivalent pitch classes, or does it not?</p><p>It seems to come very close when the tones have a decent complement<br/>of harmonic partials. Otherwise, it may depart from that -- I<br/>detailed some cases to Joseph here, yesterday I think.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand the &quot;slinky&quot; bit, and the stretching of &quot;pitch&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; independent of &quot;chroma&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think it&apos;s independent at all -- it&apos;s highly _dependent_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Yet I do not hear you elucidating any known systematic way<br/>&gt; in which this is so. It&apos;s all so &quot;mystical&quot;, and non-coherent ...</p><p>The stretching of pitch that you refer to would seem to mean the<br/>stretching of octaves? So that causes the chromas to be a little more<br/>spread out in pitch, no? Seems coherent to me . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Such may serve as a model to attempt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to accomodate listener *perceptions*, but it establishes a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *non-equality* (between &quot;chroma&quot; and &quot;pitch&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The two were never equal to begin with!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Well then, that explains it! It&apos;s all *so* clear ...</p><p>I don&apos;t know what to say to you, Jeremy. What exactly are you getting<br/>at with this &quot;non-equality&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt;are far less<br/>&gt; &gt; important than the fact that music has linguistic, emotional, and<br/>&gt; &gt; other associations that are (for the forseeable future) far<br/>beyond<br/>&gt; &gt; the capacity of any mathematical model, or any consciously<br/>&gt;expressed<br/>&gt; &gt; intellectual framework, to capture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: So, in &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #512, where you stated,<br/>&gt; &quot;Waveform has nothing to do with it. Harmonic entropy is the<br/>&gt; simplest possible model of consonance and cannot be regarded<br/>&gt; as specific to any waveform.&quot;, you actually meant it?</p><p>Yes, although</p><p>(a) I don&apos;t see what relevance harmonic entropy has to anything we&apos;re<br/>talking about here; and</p><p>(b) I do tend to use different values of harmonic entropy&apos;s free<br/>parameter, s, depending on timbre. This is far from arbitrary -- both<br/>mathematics and experience suggest that ratio-intepretation of<br/>intervals in timbres with weak, absent, or inharmonic partials are<br/>more &quot;blurred&quot; (&quot;pastelized&quot; is one of Margo&apos;s terms for it) than in<br/>timbres with a strong complement of harmonic partials.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 3:44:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; J Gill: So Paul, tell me, have *you* ever &quot;heard&quot; a 20-25 Hz<br/>&gt; tone, or have you ever met anyone who has &quot;heard&quot; a 20-25 Hz<br/>&gt; tone?</p><p>I don&apos;t know, but considering the vast amount of psychoacoustic data<br/>that you cite, I felt it appropriate to note that your lower bound of<br/>70 Hz definitely seemed out of line with the published evidence.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 8:42:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/32597">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/32597</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; J Gill: So Paul, tell me, have *you* ever &quot;heard&quot; a 20-25 Hz<br/>&gt; &gt; tone, or have you ever met anyone who has &quot;heard&quot; a 20-25 Hz<br/>&gt; &gt; tone?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; J Gill<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well - you both have now.
