However, essentially, the new woodwind is a wooden tube blown<br/>through a fipple-(recorder)-type mouthpiece (or potentially some kind of<br/>conventional single or double reed).  There are no tone-holes drilled<br/>through the side of the bore of the tube... but there are a series of<br/>electronic keys on outside of the bore.  There&apos;s a very clever peice of<br/>hardware inside the bore which is controlled by the electronic keys...<br/>as you blow the instrument and press the electronic keys the sounding<br/>pitch _and_ the timbre of the instrument can be varied.... Wow!!!  The<br/>pitches produced can potentially be very accurate... and in any tuning<br/>system.  This system is NOT the same principal as that used by Giles<br/>Brindley in the Logical Bassoon, or Howard McGill&apos;s Clarinet (see my<br/>paper for those who didn&apos;t see these in my lecturese etc). Neverthless,<br/>the sound is acoustic... that is, the sound is coming from within the<br/>wooden tube.... The new instrument is still very much a prototype.</p><p>My thanks, and astonishment, go to its inventor, who, unfortunately, is<br/>probably not on the list...<br/>--<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/>mailto: <a href="mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/>Tel   : (44) 1603 614380</p></div>
