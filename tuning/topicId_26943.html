However, the actual<br/>music played are Jazz standards that have been altered by the tuning.<br/>Putting your fingers on the fingerboard gives the feel of &quot;all frets&quot; since<br/>they have a fairly thick width.</p><p>Uruguayan Alejandro Sanchez is the master of the instrument. He has written<br/>original music for it.  During the performance, 12-tET guitarists Harris<br/>Becker and Jesse Eagle comped with the soloist.  There was a second Dinarra,<br/>but the action was tough if not dangerous for their hands (in their<br/>estimation).   But since all the music was based on 12-tET, there was no<br/>problem...and Alejandro played virtuosically.</p><p>How the tuning is used is an important consideration here.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 5:37:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Dave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, the NY debut of Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s Dinarra from<br/>Montevideo,<br/>&gt; Urugay took place during Microthon 2000.

To us, the use of the<br/>conventional guitar which was fully mapped on the Dinarra, indicated that it<br/>shared the same pitches.  I spoke with Harris Becker the other night to see<br/>if he had to fudge anything or change anything &quot;tuning-wise&quot; to play the<br/>Dinarra&apos;s notes, and he didn&apos;t think he did.</p><p>The French system, taught by Rene Longy at The Juilliard for decades, has 6<br/>equal tempered major whole tones which are split into 9 commas.  We naturally<br/>(or unnaturally) thought this is what you were doing.  The actual difference<br/>between what you did and the French system was glossed over in the music.</p><p>Sorry if I misinterpreted you.  Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2001 2:14:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The French system, taught by Rene Longy at The Juilliard for<br/>decades, has 6<br/>&gt; equal tempered major whole tones which are split into 9 commas.</p><p>This seems like a very strange system.
