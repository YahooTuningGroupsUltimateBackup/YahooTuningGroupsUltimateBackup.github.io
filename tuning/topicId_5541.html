See, people, Paul does know about *other* stuff !</p><p>Here&apos;s some more of my thoughts, including a few I missed (thanks for<br/>reminding me about the compound radius, P.)</p><p>&gt; 1. Fretboard radius (flatter = better, shred machines are 16&quot;)</p><p>     Compound radius fingerboards are best. Usually going from the Fender<br/>     Strat 12&quot; at the nut to 16&quot; at the 24th/22nd fret.<br/>     Could be tedious to do this on necks with more than 12 frets, though...</p><p>Add :</p><p>7. String material. I think stainless steel strings, or just the more<br/>   brighter ones (like Dean Markley Blue Steels) seem o buzz more.</p><p>8. Fret height. Higher = better.</p><p>   The problem occurs when the frets are low enough that the fretting finger<br/>   cannot press down on it so that there is a nice clean contact between the<br/>   string &amp; the fret. You end up pressing down on the wood.</p><p>   Scalloped fretboards also a solution. Like Yngwie Malmsteen uses.<br/>   Could be tedious to do this on necks with more than 12 frets, though...</p><p>   The tallest commercially available frets are (I think) Dunlop 6100.</p><p>9. Whammy bars / Tremolos. Get rid of them. If your last name isn&apos;t Vai,<br/>   save yourself the money.</p><p>For an idea of how much choice there is in the electric guitar thing :<br/><a href="http://www.warmoth.com/">http://www.warmoth.com/</a></p><p>Oh, Stylus picks are made by Dunlop, so easily available.</p><p>&gt; Re:  THANKS DREW !<br/>Hey you guys are more than welcome ! May we all live long &amp; prosper :-)<br/>And may we all have the opportunity to visit Montevideo (&amp; California !) :-)</p><p>&gt; I apologize if someone already mentioned this, ...etc.<br/>Chris, never apologize !

Get rid of them. If your last name isn&apos;t Vai,<br/>&gt;   save yourself the money.</p><p>Interesting. I have the tremolo blocked on both of my Vai-designed Ibanez<br/>Universe guitars. But that&apos;s just me. Would you really take the whammy from<br/>Hendrix, SRV, Bolin, and Zappa? And what about all the surf-rockers out<br/>there?</p></div>
