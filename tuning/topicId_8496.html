One teacher I had (with whom<br/>we<br/>&gt;used Forte) did the same kind of thing, emphasizing that the &quot;subdominant&quot;<br/>&gt;function is one of &quot;dominant preparation&quot; -- my best recollection (in<br/>&gt;reference to major or harmonic minor):</p><p>&gt;VII      Dominant<br/>&gt;VI       Tonic or Subdominant<br/>&gt;V        Dominant<br/>&gt;IV       Subdominant<br/>&gt;III      in minor, a rare augmented triad; in major, Subdominant<br/>preparation<br/>&gt;II       Subdominant<br/>&gt;I        Tonic</p><p>&gt;The idea here is that any chord labelled &quot;subdominant&quot; usually leads to a<br/>&gt;chord labeled &quot;dominant&quot;, though not always immediately; any chord<br/>labelled<br/>&gt;&quot;dominant&quot; tends to resolve usually immediately, to a chord labeled<br/>&quot;tonic&quot;;<br/>&gt;and any chord labeled &quot;tonic&quot; can do whatever it wants.</p><p>Hi Paul (Erlich).  Thanks for getting into the &quot;fray&quot; on this one.  It<br/>seems like this is all a matter of semantics... we all agree that the<br/>system is basically modulating through the Pythagorean matrix as its<br/>fundamental characteristic.  So perhaps the overall point, from the tuning<br/>perspective, is &quot;moot&quot; as Daniel Wolf suggests...</p><p>However, to continue anyway, how was I to know that VI, called here<br/>&quot;Subdominant&quot; was not specifically referring to a IV chord, but meant ANY<br/>secondary function, i.e. V of V??  Particularly since Monz referred to the<br/>Riemann system as a:</p><p>[Monz TD 526:8]<br/>&gt;paradigm which places the tonic in the center as a balancing point and the<br/>subdominant and dominant &gt;on either side of it in opposing forces, with all<br/>other chord-roots being categorized into one of the three &gt;&apos;positions.&apos;</p><p>Let&apos;s get REALLY simplistic for a moment.  Therefore the chart would be:</p><p>F--C--G</p><p>IV--I--V</p><p>And, the &quot;secondary functions&quot; of an extended series of fifths would be:</p><p>F--C--G--D--A--E</p><p>IV--I--V--IV (implied) -- IV (implied) -- IV (implied)</p><p>It looks a little &quot;lopsided&quot; to me...</p><p>And, what about all the fifths on the &quot;other side&quot;:</p><p>Bb, Eb, Ab, etc?? [I guess those fourthy subdomiant ones are pretty &quot;cool&quot;<br/>rock progressions...]</p><p>Do we get, many thanks to Pythagoras:</p><p>Ab--Eb--Bb--F--C--G--D--A--E</p><p>IV (implied)--IV (implied)--IV(implied)--IV (the &quot;real one&quot;)--I (thank<br/>god)--V (whoopee)--IV (implied, you &quot;gotta believe&quot;)-- IV (implied) -- IV<br/>(implied)</p><p>Man, I&apos;m sure glad I&apos;m not a V.  I&apos;d get &quot;whalloped&quot; by all the &quot;betas...!&quot;</p><p>In any case, if this is the Riemann system, I would rather opt for the<br/>Forte which, as we have shown is quite a bit different.  Just for<br/>reference, here it is again.  (I hope the server can store it...)</p><p>[From TD 525:20]:</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s Forte&apos;s functional harmony chart, again from _Tonal Harmony in<br/>Concept and Practice_:<br/>&gt;I quote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;II -- Supertonic -- Dominant preparation<br/>&gt;III (in major)-- Mediant -- Leads to dominant preparations IV, II-6 or VI<br/>&gt;III (in minor) -- Mediant -- Independent triad that often usurps role of<br/>tonic<br/>&gt;IV Subdominant -- Dominant preparation or melodic embellishment of tonic<br/>&gt;VI (in major) Submediant -- Dominant preparation or tonic substitute<br/>&gt;VI (in minor) Submediant -- Dominant preparation<br/>&gt;VII (in major and harmonic minor) -- leading tone triad -- Dominant<br/>substitute or melodic &gt;embellishment of tonic<br/>&gt;VII (in natural minor) -- Natural VII - Secondary dominant in relation to<br/>the mediant triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Unquote...</p><p>Obviously, Paul, your teacher was teaching Reimann and *not* Forte, since<br/>the definitions you mention are quite different from Forte&apos;s definitions<br/>and terminology shown above.<br/>P.S. -- And don&apos;t forget the III in minor, you call a &quot;rare augmented<br/>triad&quot; frequently becomes MAJOR like superman... establishing the relative<br/>major, trashing and usurping the entire scene... as Allen Forte so clearly<br/>and capably lays out...</p><p>:-)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8540 href="#8540">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
