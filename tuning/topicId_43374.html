In each instance, the specific interval<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; used is a semitone of 108 cents,</p><p>&gt;&gt;This is fiction:<br/>&gt;&gt;How would Bach or someone else guarantee an performance to the &gt;&gt;maximum deviation of 0.1 cent (which your use of the figure 108 &gt;&gt;indicates. I guess you follow the scientific standard in giving &gt;&gt;figures and the degree of  preciseness indicated by them).</p><p>&gt; ibo, johnny said 108 cents, not 108.0 cents. therefore the<br/>&gt; scientific standard indicates a maximum deviation of at<br/>&gt; least 0.4 cents, not 0.1 cent.</p><p>You&apos;re right - my mistake in giving the number, sorry!</p><p>The theoretical maxima should be<br/>107.5  and 108.49</p><p>Question to Johnny:   did you mean it that exact? Do you have measurements of the practical result of one of your Bach-performances to show that the exactness of +/- 0.5 cent is actually reached by everyone in the ensemble? How consistent is the exactness reached for the different occuring intervals. Interesting would especially be to get such measurements from a part of the music which modulates and employs augmented or diminished intervals.</p><p>&gt; now it is true that such intervals cannot even be defined for<br/>&gt; arbitrary sound signals that last for a very short period of time. &gt; but invoking the drift of wind instruments with respect to air &gt; pressure is certainoly no argument here, as johnny and his players do &gt; not rely on fixed fingerings for each cent value -- i think he&apos;s said &gt; that fingerings get you within a 25-cent zone at best -- they rely on &gt; their *ears* and make moment-to-moment adjustments as necessary.  &gt; the claim of 1 cent accuracy, when johnny is pressed hard<br/>&gt; enough, becomes a worthwhile goal rather than a verifiable<br/>&gt; result,</p><p>which seems to express my opinion, it is an approximation.<br/>One tries to reach perfection, knowing that it is impossible, but anyway trying.</p><p>&gt; but nothing *you* said speaks against the acheivability<br/>&gt; of this goal, ibo.</p><p>I disgree, because I think the &quot;chaotic&quot; factors in a &quot;practical&quot; situation (I sketched a few) outweigh the other factors</p><p>&gt; i wish i had time to read and comment on the rest of<br/>&gt; the discussion.<br/>&gt; i&apos;ve just glanced around a bit. while it&apos;s been clear for some time &gt; that johnny boldly comes to conclusions about the intended tunings of &gt; certain composers based on speculative leaps and without anything &gt; like scientific evidence, i don&apos;t think that ibo&apos;s position is &gt; anything like &quot;science&quot; either. perhaps more reasoned, yes -- and his &gt; bringing to light the writings of primary sources, etc. is certainly &gt; invaluable.  &gt; but as a physicist, i see nothing resembing &quot;science&quot;<br/>&gt; here,</p><p>Some natural sciences methods might in humaniora be sniffed at as &quot;positivistic&quot; (the big club). And on the contrary natural sciences might look down at methods applied by humaniora as not being &quot;science&quot;. I don&apos;t agree with both views. I see the necessity learn from each other, take and refine the methods to narrow in - at least respect them, not saying from the other scientific branch, this is not &quot;science&quot; (which involves gaining knowledge, skill, insight, science).</p><p>&gt; and as a musician, i know the importance of confidence and<br/>&gt; boldness and how these can outweigh many other factors in<br/>&gt; producing a  convincing performance.</p><p>I fully agree, and have stated that before.</p><p>&gt; personally, i hope for a world where different groups<br/>&gt; of musicians can perform bach in strict werckmeister<br/>&gt; iii, in adaptive just intonation where only a rare pitch<br/>&gt; deviates more than +/- 3 cents from a keyboard extended<br/>&gt; meantone model,</p><p>and the historical approach as represented in the sources around Bach, in which it can deviate quite much more between the fixed pitch-continuo instruments (in any of the described or practised temperaments) and the free intonating musicians (often explained and described now ...)</p><p>This is represented for example in organs tuned in many temperaments. An example: the fifths in meantone chords are already (theoretically) 5.4 cents deviating from the pure fifths in a mixture or a quint-stop. It has some nucleus of &quot;truth&quot; that the organ is called &quot;queen/king of instruments&quot; - as it matches in one instrument, historical description of ensemble intonation (including the voice).</p><p>&gt; in<br/>&gt; kellner bach tuning, barnes bach tuning, etc. the world will be a &gt; richer place for all the options, which hopefully would lead to a new &gt; generation of more intonation-sensitive musicians.</p><p>Fully agreed!</p><p>&gt; certainly the liberties that have been taken, to good<br/>&gt; effect, with performances of bach&apos;s music are far more<br/>&gt; striking to the average listener than these subtle<br/>&gt; shadings of intonation would be. nevertheless, i hope the<br/>&gt; tuning debate rages on, it&apos;s healthy . . .</p><p>dito</p><p>kind regards<br/>Ibo</p></div><h3><a id=43384 href="#43384">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/17/2003 6:26:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/17/03 7:54:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:ibo.ortgies@musik.gu.se">ibo.ortgies@musik.gu.se</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Question to Johnny:   did you mean it that exact?

There is<br/>vibrato, there is a burp, there is a mistake.  The AFMM Ensemble plays in all<br/>sorts of tunings, and to critical acclaim.  Can you not see that playing Bach<br/>in another tuning is just that, another tuning.  No can measure it later to<br/>your heart&apos;s content.  I don&apos;t doubt it is a better performance than Bach was<br/>likely to receive (if he hear BC #2 at all in his lifetime).</p><p>And yes, I can play, vocalize, and hear cents.  Even itty-bitty single cents.<br/> On February 8th I did a piece called &quot;Hearing a Cent&quot; as part of an AFMM<br/>concert.

The harpsichord tunes it in 15 minutes (much<br/>as Bach was reputed to do) and then each string players tunes to the open<br/>strings of the harpsichord.  The recorder and oboe match as previously<br/>described.  My concerts are open to the public and the Bach got great reviews<br/>both last year (in The New York Times), and this year (un reviewed in print).</p><p>Paul added:</p><p>&gt; &gt; now it is true that such intervals cannot even be defined for<br/>&gt; &gt; arbitrary sound signals that last for a very short period of time.<br/>&gt; &gt; but invoking the drift of wind instruments with respect to air<br/>&gt; &gt; pressure is certainoly no argument here, as johnny and his players do<br/>&gt; &gt; not rely on fixed fingerings for each cent value -- i think he&apos;s said<br/>&gt; &gt; that fingerings get you within a 25-cent zone at best -- they rely on<br/>&gt; &gt; their *ears* and make moment-to-moment adjustments as necessary.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Paul, you are confusing my comments about doing Renaissance a capella vocal<br/>music in just intonation (and drift) with the Bach performances in Werck<br/>meister III.  WIII requires exact fingerings for each of the 12 tones.  On<br/>the winds there is only 1 single fingering (other than some virtuosic<br/>involvement, e.g. trills, monophonic alternates, alternate fingering).</p><p>Where did you get this about relying on ears for a 25-cent zone?  Perhaps you<br/>are thinking about violins.  We always use our ears, and maybe, as in the<br/>second movement I took a liberty to accenuate the tuning in a solo turn.</p><p>&gt; &gt; the claim of 1 cent accuracy, when johnny is pressed hard<br/>&gt; &gt; enough, becomes a worthwhile goal rather than a verifiable<br/>&gt; &gt; result,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which seems to express my opinion, it is an approximation.<br/>&gt; One tries to reach perfection, knowing that it is impossible,<br/>&gt; but anyway trying.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is not impossible.

You mean the temperature and the elements?<br/>Man, I hope you don&apos;t suffer a stroke when you finally get to hear WIII<br/>performed accurately in a composition by Bach.  What else do you expect to<br/>uncover about early performance practice that will &quot;help&quot; modern<br/>performances, or is it more like the study of ancient Greek, forever<br/>theorized in pronunciation and music, but never realized.</p><p>&gt; personally, i hope for a world where different groups<br/>&gt; &gt; of musicians can perform bach in strict werckmeister<br/>&gt; &gt; iii, in adaptive just intonation where only a rare pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; deviates more than +/- 3 cents from a keyboard extended<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone model,<br/>&gt;</p><p>JR: Which I abhor, because I think it takes us further from the integrity of<br/>the composer&apos;s intentions.</p><p>&gt; and the historical approach as represented in the sources around<br/>&gt; Bach, in which it can deviate quite much more between the fixed<br/>&gt; pitch-continuo instruments (in any of the described or practised<br/>&gt; temperaments) and the free intonating musicians (often explained<br/>&gt; and described now ...)<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is just plain wrong.
