I think that even<br/>if one is passively listening to music by oneself,<br/>one feels that the music is making certain demands<br/>on one&apos;s mind to &quot;go along with it&quot;.  Sometimes<br/>less exciting, less powerful and brilliantly<br/>constructed music may be better suited to carry<br/>one along with it according to one&apos;s mood then.</p><p>    There&apos;s a CD - Lyrichord Early Music Series 8010<br/>containing two three-part sung masses by J. Ockeghem.<br/>Both of these (one quite different from the other<br/>harmonically) have a rather spare sound which I find<br/>very soothing to listen to at times.  They seem to<br/>leave one to be as one is, while still being &quot;present&quot; -<br/>the sound of constructive human thought and activity<br/>and not a vacuum.</p><p>    On an item of personal news, I plan to work with<br/>a pianist and others at Florida State University,<br/>Tallahassee to produce a CD(s) bringing the sounds<br/>of the differently tuned piano to a larger<br/>audience in a careful professional way.  I&apos;ll be<br/>leaving the San Diego area June 10th or shortly<br/>thereafter.</p><p>    Dave Hill,    La Mesa,  CA</p></div>
