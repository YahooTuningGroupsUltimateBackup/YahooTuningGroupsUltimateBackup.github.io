But the &quot;golden section&quot;<br/>is<br/>&gt;also called &quot;division into extreme and mean ratios&quot;, which, when<br/>sectioning<br/>&gt;a line (for example) means &quot;the ratio of the whole to the larger part<br/>is<br/>&gt;equal to the ratio of the larger part to the smaller&quot;, which divides<br/>the<br/>&gt;line at 1/phi or ~.618..</p><p>Which is ~-833c.</p><p>&gt;But if I  compute a division of the octave according to the above<br/>dictum, I<br/>&gt;get the following:</p><p>&gt;The ratio of the whole (2/1)<br/>&gt;to the larger part (call it &quot;x&quot;)<br/>&gt;is equal to the ratio of the larger part (x)<br/>&gt;to the smaller part (2/x)</p><p>&gt;or:</p><p>&gt;2/x=x/(2/x)</p><p>&gt;this reduces to:</p><p>&gt;x^2=4/x<br/>&gt;x^3=4<br/>&gt;x=cube root of 4<br/>&gt;also<br/>&gt;x=(cube root of 2)^2<br/>&gt;x=~1.58740105197</p><p>&gt;This is 800c, or &gt;exactly an equal tempered minor sixth&lt;! Its like<br/>dividing<br/>&gt;the octave in 3tet, and taking two parts (cube root of 2)^2.</p><p>&gt;The only thing I can make of this is that 1.618... is the linear golden<br/>&gt;section, which applies to euclidian space  and 1.587.. is some kind of<br/>log<br/>&gt;golden section, which applies to pitch space.</p><p>&gt;Is this correct, or am I making a dumb mistake somewhere?</p><p>You are making a mistake in that the &quot;ratio&quot; of two interval sizes is<br/>not a simple division -- in fact, a simple division is the &quot;difference&quot;<br/>of two interval sizes. To divide the octave logarithmically into the<br/>golden section, use 1200/phi=741.6408 cents.</p></div>
