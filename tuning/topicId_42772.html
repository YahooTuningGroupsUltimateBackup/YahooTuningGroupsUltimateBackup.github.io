I have given a look<br/>&gt;&gt; there, and it seems that Zarlino uses a sort of<br/>&gt;&gt; monochord to establish the length of the strings;<br/>&gt;&gt; he is pretty practical there, and never speaks of<br/>&gt;&gt; beatings or something that could be referred to them.<br/>&gt;&gt; Also, if you look at the method described in this<br/>&gt;&gt; chapter, it suggests a procedure based essentially<br/>&gt;&gt; on measurements (...to narrow a fifth, place a comma<br/>&gt;&gt; at its high end, divide it by seven, and take away<br/>&gt;&gt; the two higher parts...).</p><p>i have just realized that if Zarlino actually<br/>intended to *measure* 2/7-comma meantone on a monochord,<br/>he most likely was not using (81/80)^-(2/7) as his<br/>division, which is what we&apos;ve been assuming all along,<br/>but rather, he probably divided the monochord<br/>*string-length* of the syntonic comma into 7<br/>*arithmetically* equal parts!</p><p>in cap. 43 of part 2,</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/cap42-43.txt">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/zarlino/1558/cap42-43.txt</a></p><p>Zarlino describes these divisions as &quot;equal&quot;, and<br/>insists that they therefore cannot be &quot;rational&quot;,<br/>as are the regular JI intervals he had presented a<br/>few chapters before this.  this would lead the<br/>reader to believe that he is indeed discussing<br/>logarithmic divisions.</p><p>but he then continues to describe how to determine<br/>the tempered intervals by *dividing the string-length<br/>of the comma into 7 equal parts* and measuring off<br/>various numbers of those parts.</p><p>this procedure would result in the following<br/>divisions for the &quot;5th&quot;:</p><p>    ratio           string   ~cents<br/>                    length<br/>3:2 &quot;perfect 5th&quot;    560   701.9550009<br/>3:2 less 1/7-comma   561   698.8662685<br/>3:2 less 2/7-comma   562   695.7830369<br/>3:2 less 3/7-comma   563   692.7052867<br/>3:2 less 4/7-comma   564   689.6329983<br/>3:2 less 5/7-comma   565   686.5661524<br/>3:2 less 6/7-comma   566   683.5047298<br/>3:2 less 1 comma     567   680.4487113<br/>1:1                  840     0</p><p>if this is how Zarlino calculated his temperament,<br/>then his 2/7-comma meantone &quot;5th&quot; is ~695.7830369<br/>cents, and not the ~695.8103467 cents which results<br/>from the logarithmic division of the comma, and it<br/>is indeed a rational number: 840/562.</p><p>a tempered approximation of this &quot;5th&quot; is 2^(40/69).</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=42773 href="#42773">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2003 7:18:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@attglobal.net">monz@attglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 09, 2003 7:10 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] arithmetic divisions for 2/7-comma meantone?
