Erlich<br/>&gt; Sent:&#x9;Tuesday, February 23, 1999 7:39 PM<br/>&gt; To:&#x9;&apos;Joseph L Monzo&apos;<br/>&gt; Subject:&#x9;RE: thanks for all the hospitality<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A Fokker article just fel into my lap! I didn&apos;t even look for it! It&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Selections from the Harmonic Lattice of Perfect Fifths and Major<br/>&gt; Thirds Containing 12, 19, 22, 31, 41, or 53 Notes.&quot; This is how it<br/>&gt; starts -- this sounds just like your finity concept:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; **********************************************************************<br/>_Summary and Conclusion_<br/>&gt; &#x9;The infinite multitude of notes is investigated, which are<br/>&gt; generated by reiterated traspositions of a central note by perfect<br/>&gt; fifths (3/2) and perfect major thirds (5/4). The notes are represented<br/>&gt; in a rectangular lattice. The numbers of factors 3 and 5 involved in<br/>&gt; their definition are coordinates in the plane of the lattice. Around<br/>&gt; the central note (0,0) the notes are thus defined by pairs of numbers<br/>&gt; (p,q), where both p and q may run from - to + infinity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;In practice it will be convenient to use letters, from a to g<br/>&gt; inclusive, with additional sharps and flats. In order to discriminate<br/>&gt; between members of a commatic pair, commatic strokes, sloping up or<br/>&gt; down, may preced the letters. For reasons of symmetry the central note<br/>&gt; will be chosen to be D.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;The pitches of some notes are so close one to another, that they<br/>&gt; may be mistaken to be unison. Again, too, on purpose they may be taken<br/>&gt; to be unisons, in order to reduce the infinite multitude of notes to<br/>&gt; tractable smaller numbers. Such vanishing intervals are represented by<br/>&gt; vectors in the lattice from the centre to the postulated unisonious<br/>&gt; note. We call them _unison vectors_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Any unison vector introduces a periodicity into the lattice. Two<br/>&gt; unison vectors postulate a two-fold periodicity, producing _periodic<br/>&gt; meshes_. These are parallelograms having for sides the two unison<br/>&gt; vectors. They include a _number of notes_, a varying number according<br/>&gt; to the choice of the unison vectors. Such numbers have served to<br/>&gt; constitute equal temperaments, with equal intervals between<br/>&gt; consecutive members of one periodicity mesh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;The common equal temperament takes a selection of twelve<br/>&gt; semitones. Nineteen tritotones have been advocated by Wesley Woolhouse<br/>&gt; (1835) and in modern times by Joseph Yasser (1932). The Indian<br/>&gt; musicians discriminate twenty-two sruti&apos;s. Christiaan Huygens (1691)<br/>&gt; computed a system of thirty-one dieses. This is supported by the<br/>&gt; present writer. Forty-one supracomma&apos;s have been put forward by Paul<br/>&gt; Von Janko (1901), and Nicolaus Mercator, as early as 1608, extended<br/>&gt; the selection to fifty-three comma&apos;s.<br/>&gt; **********************************************************************<br/>&gt;<br/>--------------------------------</p><p>That&apos;s what I sent to Joe. Now I&apos;ll skip to almost the end of the<br/>article.</p><p>**********************************************************************<br/>_Geometry in the lattice_<br/>&#x9;Geometry shows that a vector (a,b) and a second vector (p,q)<br/>define a parallelogram with an are (aq-bp). This is written in the<br/>algebraical form</p><p>                   |a   b|<br/>                   |     | = aq-bp<br/>                   |p   q|</p><p>&#x9;Therefore, in the lattice, two unison vectors will define an<br/>area, i.e., a number of lattice area units. Each unit carrying one note,<br/>that area will give the number of the notes in the selection.</p><p>&#x9;The selections examined in the preceding pages are the<br/>following.</p><p>                   |0  -3|   |4  -1|<br/>              12 = |     | = |     |<br/>                   |4  -1|   |8   1|</p><p>                   |4  -1|   |4  -1|<br/>              19 = |     | = |     |<br/>                   |-1  5|   |-5  6|</p><p>                   |4   2|   |4   2|<br/>              22 = |     | = |     |<br/>                   |-1  5|   |3   7|</p><p>                   |4  -1|   |1  -8|<br/>              31 = |     | = |     |<br/>                   |3   7|   |4  -1|</p><p>                   |8   1|   |8   1|<br/>              41 = |     | = |     |<br/>                   |-1  5|   |7   6|</p><p>                   |8   1|   |8   1|<br/>              53 = |     | = |     |<br/>                   |-5  6|   |3   7|<br/>**********************************************************************</p><p>When Joe was over at my house this weekend I already knew about this<br/>aspect of Fokker&apos;s theory (from Graham Breed and/or Paul Hahn) so we<br/>tried this with all kinds of 5-limit commas and got 34 in addition to<br/>all the values above.</p><p>The two bars surrounding a square matrix of numbers is called the<br/>determinant.

At this point I am not so much interested in using them to<br/>generate ETs (I&apos;m pretty much committed to 31TET) as for &quot;generalized<br/>diatonic&quot; scales embedded within them.
