So<br/>Partch thought that Cage was a charlatan? Talk about an &apos;out<br/>of tune 17-limit interval&apos;! Yawn.</p><p>Neil, you said you were working in 31 now. I take it you got<br/>a 31tet guitar. Where from? Can you compare your 31<br/>explorations and impressions with 19 and 34?</p><p>As for me, most composition is done from my head (or rather,<br/>the spirits are able to go through my head) and it usually<br/>relates to the people I&apos;m working with. For me to open a<br/>new compositional area (so that those spirits can flow<br/>through my head), requires some time doing paper-work,<br/>improvisation and some forced &apos;bad&apos; compositions (what<br/>one could call studies). After a whole lot of work, I<br/>may be able to get out of the way and let the music come.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
