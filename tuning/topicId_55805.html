IIRC it&apos;s RPN 100 &amp; 101  that adjust<br/>pitch-bend range.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Andy F.</p></div><h3><a id=55884 href="#55884">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2004 8:07:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan Mozell wrote:<br/>&gt;Has anyone found that midi devices may not play pitches accurately?</p><p>Yes, that happens.
