Nevertheless, it IS well audible and it does have a significant meaning<br/>when we judge if one chord is more or less &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;concordant&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; or &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;harmonious&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; than<br/>another. And because of that, it is one of the primary reasons why, for<br/>example, European classical harmony developed the way it did. Even people<br/>like Zarlino had known about that and were using that knowledge to describe<br/>what &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;perfect harmony&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; should sound like &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; meaning, for example, that a<br/>major triad of C4-E4-G4 is in &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;perfect harmony&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; if there are no beats heard<br/>and the fundamental of C2 is audible (because all of these tones are<br/>harmonics of the C2, which is what he considered a perfect reference for<br/>explaining what &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;in tune&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; means).</p><p>&gt; What does this have to do with anything? Of course one can<br/>&gt; construct any number of synthesized examples where phase<br/>&gt; cancelations occur in the signal generation domain. Such<br/>&gt; effects are almost never heard in musical contexts, and are<br/>&gt; not a significant source of anything remotely related to<br/>&gt; consonance or dissonance in normal musical settings. If you<br/>&gt; have evidence to the contrary, I would like to download it.</p><p>First of all, this is not about phase cancellation. Second, even if they<br/>shouldn&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;t have a great deal to do with the &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;musical&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; view of con/dissonance,<br/>they have a lot to do with the fundamental frequency and with the multiple<br/>periodicity phenomenon, which I was trying to illustrate there. Should I try<br/>to say it in a less complicated way, basically, what I meant was that if you<br/>mix frequencies of 3:7:11:15:19Hz and so on, up to as high as you can hear,<br/>you&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ll get, as a result, a sound which exploits two kinds of periodicity,<br/>one of 1Hz and another of 4Hz, even though neither of these frequencies<br/>themselves is actually present in it. If you had a program for finding<br/>frequencies of periodic sounds and loaded a sound like this into it, it<br/>would say &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;1Hz&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;. If you then listened to such a sound, instead of hearing<br/>proper tones, you would hear beats of 4Hz. And if, as they clearly can,<br/>these things can be heard at frequencies that low in the form of beats, I<br/>see no reason why they couldn&apos;t be heard in our hearing range in the form of<br/>tones.</p><p>If you want to listen on your own, I&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ve made a Rar archive containing a few<br/>wave files demonstrating this. The number contained in each filename tells<br/>the frequency whose multiples there are of 3, 7, 11, and so on. So, the<br/>number 30 sais that the sound contains 90Hz, 210Hz, 330Hz and so on. The<br/>&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;5over4&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; stands for 1.25.

There was the thing which I could try to translate perhaps as major or minor &quot;tonal gender&quot;, which meant that the chord contained a rising major or minor third from the fundamental tone. But none of that appeared to have to do anything with the harmonic series. OTOH, when I later started my first web search about microtonal music and the harmonic series, many times I found a term of &quot;fundamental frequency&quot; referring specifically to the relative frequency of 1 in JI chords and some articles were even stressing that distinction should be made between a &quot;fundamental tone&quot; in classical harmony and a &quot;fundamental tone&quot; of the harmonic series, the latter meaning the lowest tone in the series.</p><p>&gt; Sure... but how do you quantify this?

What about irrational intervals?&quot; Well there&apos;s the rub! On the<br/>one hand we have a rational model which seems to explain musical<br/>harmony to some extent. On the other, we have a 12-t system which is<br/>based on irrationals and therefore by definition cannot have a GCD.<br/>Yet it has the advantage of equalizing all notes such that each tone<br/>is placed in the same harmonic role as every other.</p><p>What I suspect - and it is just a theory - is that the 12-t notes in<br/>the real world are not irrational at all, but are actually very high<br/>overtones in the series. Why? First, irrationals are supposed to have<br/>an infinite number of digits eg Flat 5 as sq root of 2 is 1.414...to<br/>infinity. I don&apos;t think this would be even possible to realize on,<br/>say, a piano. Second, we have limits of human hearing to consider,<br/>like the schisma. Hindemith makes the point that we can still<br/>recognise a melody when it is out of tune. So maybe each tempered<br/>interval is a &quot;cluster&quot; of possible higher overtones, and that we have<br/>a type of &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; at work? For instance, the harmonics<br/>640 through to 645, taken over 512, all approximate what our brain<br/>registers as a maj 3. The first 640/512 = 5/4, while the last 645/512<br/>gives a very close approximation to the tempered maj 3 as 2 to the<br/>power of 1/3. In fact, I seem to recall that the difference b/w them<br/>is less than the schisma (but I haven&apos;t got my calculator). Maybe<br/>playing notes together &quot;pushes&quot; these harmonics out or something to<br/>that effect?</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2009 8:42:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you are interested, some small part of my works of all kind is on <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/forrotronics">www.soundclick.com/forrotronics</a>, recently I have added my profile and MP3&apos;s here: <a href="http://netnewmusic.ning.com/profile/DanielForro">netnewmusic.ning.com/profile/DanielForro</a><br/>Still much more is waiting for uploading...
