I like that. So EDIs contain EDOs (which contains equal<br/>temperaments<br/>and equal tunings) and CETs, while UDIs (unequal division of the<br/>interval)<br/>contain UDOs (which contain just intonation, pelog, slendro, etc.) and<br/>pretty<br/>much all other tuning schemes. Well, it makes sense.<br/>        This is sort of cool. We have in effect an international tuning<br/>congress,<br/>and some of the things we agree on here may well become the defacto<br/>standards of<br/>the future, due to the power of the internet. I hope we can agree on<br/>some sensible<br/>definitions and terminology, and use them consistently.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/1999 8:53:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Gerald Eskelin wrote...]<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes. I&apos;m quite sure that the ear does &quot;temper&quot; such chords &quot;naturally.&quot; I<br/>&gt;&gt;commonly hear singers make slight pitch modifications in notationally<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;repeated&quot; or &quot;sustained&quot; notes as the fundamental shifts. And, believe me,<br/>&gt;&gt;very few of those singers have any notion of numbers, ratios or tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;systems.&quot; They simply have sensitive ears.</p><p>Carl Luma replied:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry, this doesn&apos;t sound anything like temperament to me.  It sounds like<br/>&gt; the singers you describe are making commatic adjustments consistent with<br/>&gt; singing in JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>Carl, the term &quot;temper&quot; was used in my paragraph to refer to quote to which<br/>I was responding. That&apos;s why it was in quotes. But you are correct. Thanks<br/>for clarifying what I rather clumsily expressed.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
