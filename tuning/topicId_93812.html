Therefore, it also seems that if modern composers want to change<br/>keys, and they are synthesizing their music, they can just create<br/>section 1 in key #1 and create section 2 in key #2, and to heck with<br/>all of the imprecision that comes from using any equally tempered<br/>scale.

Is<br/>&gt; there something I&apos;m missing that&apos;s special harmonically or melodically<br/>&gt; (vs. mathematically) about EDO scales?</p><p>You&apos;re right that one of the motivations for using Equal Divisions of the Octave is for computational or instrumental simplicity, but at least in my experience, they have another advantage. A scale&apos;s desirability is not only dependent on it&apos;s approximation of just ratios, but also on it&apos;s melodic stability. That is, if an interval is functioning melodically the same as another interval in the scale, we tend to expect them to be the same size. If the sizes of inconsistent it can be disconcerting for a listener.</p><p>For example, in a Just Diatonic Scale of 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 the melodically functional distance from 1/1 to 9/8 and from 9/8 to 5/4 is the same, ie, they are both major seconds. But in that scale I described one major second is 9/8 whereas the other is 10/9, and this can be, as I said, disconcerting for a listener. If instead we choose an edo like 12, 19, 53, 17, among others (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_Temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_Temperament</a>) they fit in just right with the diatonic scale so that they can have exactly 5 equally larges steps (major seconds) and 2 equally small steps (minor seconds).</p><p>&gt; 2. A fair bit of the microtonal music I&apos;ve been listening to (which,<br/>&gt; honestly, is stuff I can download for free or stream online) uses<br/>&gt; square, sawtooth, and triangle waves. My understanding is that these<br/>&gt; waveforms have fairly high amplitudes in the higher-frequency<br/>&gt; harmonics. Do composers use those sounds because they deliberately<br/>&gt; want to highlight the clashes among upper partials of those notes?</p><p>Timbre plays a big part in microtonality, but many composers will have different motivations for whatever they use. Some will, as you say, highlight the clash, or lack thereof, with harsher timbres, whereas some will remap timbres to be perfectly in line with their tuning, and then sacrifice a little of the tone of the timbre itself.</p><p>A lot of the time, however, a microtonal composer will use whatever resources he has available, which is equally often low quality samples built in to his computer that highlight the worst of unfamiliar scales.</p><p>&gt; 3. I know this will vary a lot from composer to composer, but when<br/>&gt; using microtonal scales, how much do you pay attention to things like<br/>&gt; leading tones, chord progressions, and other traditional aspects of<br/>&gt; music theory? People may use them a lot, for all I know, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; see people writing about them as much. Is that because those things<br/>&gt; are already understood, or because microtonal composers tend to<br/>&gt; discount their effectiveness in microtonal music, or something else?</p><p>It depends on how you are treating your music functionally. Many people do hear their microtonal music in diatonic terms, in which case most traditional functional expectations having to do with chord progressions and leading tones are met. There are tunings, however, that support completely different scale structures than the diatonic. Remember how I described the Diatonic as a scale with 5 Large and 2 Small steps (5L,2S)? 16-edo supports a seven note scale with (3L,4S) which behaves completely differently to common practice tonality. Because microtonality in this area has not been widely explored, we can&apos;t say exactly how things tend to work in these other scale structures, but they may very well have their own parallels to leading tones and tertian harmony.</p><p>And, of course, this is only one of many many many opinions out there.</p><p>John M</p></div><h3><a id=93815 href="#93815">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2010 4:38:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jake!  Thanks for saying hello.  I&apos;ll take a stab at<br/>your questions...</p><p>&gt; 1. Why do so many people look for EDO tunings? If traditional<br/>&gt; melody and harmony was based on non-EDO diatonic or even<br/>&gt; pentatonic scales, why worry about EDO microtonal scales?<br/>&gt; It seems to me that if it weren&apos;t for the limitations in<br/>&gt; instruments -- an inability to have instruments that are<br/>&gt; playable in multiple keys without wolf tones -- then as a<br/>&gt; culture we wouldn&apos;t have bothered with equal temperament at<br/>&gt; all.</p><p>Since the 15th century, and perhaps earlier, Western music<br/>has exploited the remarkable properties of the comma 81/80,<br/>by ignoring it.  Doing so results in what we call meantone<br/>temperament (a.k.a. syntonic temperament).  This temperament<br/>need not be equal.  It need not have 12 notes to the<br/>octave (19-ET is a meantone temperament).  It need not even<br/>be tempered.  Ensembles naturally seem to perform in<br/>&quot;adaptive just intonation&quot;, where chords are just but 81/80<br/>vanishes in the melodic intervals.  Let me know if any of<br/>this makes sense to you.</p><p>12-ET is also a meantone in that 81/80 is tempered to<br/>zero steps.  But other commas also disappear, for instance<br/>the major diesis, 648/625.  And while the elimination of<br/>wolves on keyboard instruments may have been the primary<br/>driver of 12-ET adoption, composers quickly made use of<br/>these extra commas, for instance by writing progressions<br/>involving diminished chords.  The octatonic scale of bebop,<br/>Messiaen, and Rimsky-Korsakov (and I recently learned it<br/>was used in Islamic music even earlier) is to 648/625 what<br/>the diatonic scale is to 81/80.  To learn more and see some<br/>pretty illustrations of this, check out The Forms of Tonality</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p><p>&gt; Therefore, it also seems that if modern composers want to change<br/>&gt; keys, and they are synthesizing their music, they can just create<br/>&gt; section 1 in key #1 and create section 2 in key #2, and to heck<br/>&gt; with all of the imprecision that comes from using any equally<br/>&gt; tempered scale. (I&apos;m using the term &quot;key&quot; loosely; this would be<br/>&gt; true for all tonal music, and I&apos;m not suggesting we only use<br/>&gt; traditional keys.)</p><p>This can be done, but you still have to dispose of 81/80.<br/>If you hold common tones common, you will get pitch drift,<br/>by more than an octave over the course of some pieces.<br/>An alternative is to anchor chord roots to 12-ET, and this<br/>is how Hermode tuning works</p><p><a href="http://www.hermode.com/index_en.html">http://www.hermode.com/index_en.html</a></p><p>Other methods exist.</p><p>&gt; Is there something I&apos;m missing that&apos;s special harmonically or<br/>&gt; melodically (vs. mathematically) about EDO scales?</p><p>Aside from considerations like the above, ETs also contain<br/>many chords not found in just intonation, that some people<br/>find interesting.  ETs also work very naturally on guitars,<br/>where the frets can simply go straight across.</p><p>&gt; 3. I know this will vary a lot from composer to composer, but<br/>&gt; when using microtonal scales, how much do you pay attention to<br/>&gt; things like leading tones, chord progressions, and other<br/>&gt; traditional aspects of music theory? People may use them a lot,<br/>&gt; for all I know, but I don&apos;t see people writing about them<br/>&gt; as much. Is that because those things are already understood,</p><p>I think probably more the reverse, that they are so poorly<br/>understood there&apos;s really no way to talk about them.<br/>I mean, in 12 your leading tone is 100 cents or 200 cents,<br/>or maybe a minor 3rd.  If you disagree with somebody which<br/>is best, at least there are only two ways to disagree.<br/>In microtonal music the flame wars could go on for ever,<br/>and usually do. :)</p><p>That said, I would welcome more discussion of these compositional<br/>nuts and bolts, either here or on the MakeMicroMusic list</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/">/makemicromusic/</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=93817 href="#93817">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2010 5:57:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ll throw in my 2 cents as well.</p><p>On Mon, Oct 25, 2010 at 6:08 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that I understand some fundamentals of classic and jazz music<br/>&gt; theory, but am not a composer, and I understand enough about harmonics<br/>&gt; and physics to basically understand the notation I&apos;ve seen people use.</p><p>I am a composer - I know mostly classical, rock, and what I&apos;ve been<br/>developing in my mind with regard to ambient.<br/>Everything I say below is from my personal and subjective perspective.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

When you abandon the circle of fifths, you are suddenly in very uncharted territory.  Sometimes even a basic I-IV-V isn&apos;t possible, and most of the time conventions of chromatic harmony go out the window.  There are a few composers, like Easley Blackwood, George Secor, Margo Shulter, and Herman Miller (just to name a couple) who have worked out (or so it seems) the beginnings of some new harmonic theories for non-diatonic temperaments, though it seems like the majority of what is composed in microtonal scales is done by ear or mathematically.  Frankly, the general principles behind common-practice chromatic harmony are ill-understood, and have only been applied to extended diatonic frameworks; in terms of developing actual *music* theory for microtonal scales, very little work has been done.  If we understood better the reasons *why* we can (in 12-tET or other diatonic temperaments) systematically deviate from the plain TTsTTTs diatonic scale without losing the sense of tonal center--and often actually ENHANCING the sense of tonal center--we might be better able to concoct microtonal music that &quot;sounds better&quot;.

The fact that<br/>we&apos;re both interested in alternative intonations does not guarantee<br/>that we&apos;ll focus on the same tuning systems or world musical styles.<br/>I apologize in advance for bringing in topics that may be familiar to<br/>me, but possibly not to the list as a whole, as well for my less than<br/>ideal skill at appreciating limitations of a tuning which from my<br/>perspective might not be so obvious, but from that of another person&apos;s<br/>style are all too obvious!</p><p>&gt;     Note that I understand some fundamentals of classic and jazz<br/>&gt;     music theory, but am not a composer, and I understand enough<br/>&gt;     about harmonics and physics to basically understand the notation<br/>&gt;     I&apos;ve seen people use.</p><p>Please note that you may be way ahead of me on the styles with which<br/>you&apos;re familiar! Discussions of &quot;microtonality,&quot; in my view, are not<br/>about a genre of music, but about a dimension of music.</p><p>It&apos;s like discussing &quot;rhythm&quot; in music. Complex Arab or Turkish<br/>rhythms, the rhythms of late 14th-century European music in the<br/>&quot;Manneristic&quot; style of some French and Italian composers, complex<br/>African rhythms, and rhythms in some 20th-century jazz styles are<br/>all different techniques.</p><p>&gt;     1. Why do so many people look for EDO tunings? If traditional melody<br/>&gt;     and harmony was based on non-EDO diatonic or even pentatonic scales,<br/>&gt;     why worry about EDO microtonal scales?</p><p>You&apos;re asking a good question, and as someone who tends often to<br/>prefer non-EDO tunings (just or tempered), I suspect there may be a<br/>number of answers.</p><p>First, some people may be oriented to types of music which presume<br/>circulation: that is, a continuous circle of fifths all reasonably<br/>close to 3:2 which can return to any starting point.</p><p>In the styles which most influence me, European medieval and<br/>Renaissance styles and medieval and more recent Near Eastern styles,<br/>circulation is generally not assumed, and so I have no special reason<br/>to seek an EDO, although I do tend to seek out one, or often two,<br/>regular chains of fifths. A single 24-note chain of fifths, or two<br/>12-note chains often at a distance around a small semitone (say 55-60<br/>cents), are my most typical preferences.</p><p>Of course, there are a large number of EDO tunings, so that any<br/>regular tuning is likely to be not too far from some EDO. For example,<br/>one of my favorites has two 12-note chains of fifths at an average<br/>size quite close to 104-EDO, although there are subtle differences.<br/>However, that would be close to two 12-note chains of fifths in<br/>104-EDO at 5/104 octave apart, rather than a complete circle of<br/>104-EDO.</p><p>Another fine point is that while many EDO scales are circulating in<br/>the above definition (assuming that the fifth is close enough to 3:2<br/>to qualify in a given definition, say within 7 cents or so), not all<br/>circulating systems are EDO.</p><p>For example a 53-note Pythagorean chain with 52 pure fifths at 3:2<br/>actually makes a fine circulating system! What happens is that when we<br/>add a pure 2:1 octave, we get one fifth narrow by about 3.615 cents, a<br/>small interval known as the Comma of Mercator. This doesn&apos;t throw<br/>anything off, but actually adds a bit of variety, since we&apos;ll get two<br/>slightly different flavors of certain intervals, for example neutral<br/>seconds at either 133.5 or 137.1 cents. The one slightly narrow fifth<br/>is actually quite mild compared to many circulating systems.</p><p>Yet a circulating 53-note Pythagorean system may get discussed a lot<br/>less often than 53-EDO because it&apos;s a bit more complex and not<br/>precisely symmetrical. Mathematically, it&apos;s true: the system is _not_<br/>precisely a circle; but musically, for all practical purposes, it is!</p><p>Having said this, a true confession: since my Yahama synthesizer uses<br/>1024-EDO, it could be said that I&apos;m using an EDO all the time, even if<br/>my theoretical model is some kind of JI or a tempered system not based<br/>on this EDO! And that&apos;s answer on why some of us, in a sense, can&apos;t<br/>escape 1024-EDO or the like, at least on a given digital instrument of<br/>interest: &quot;Because my synthesizer says so.&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s also a more general question: &quot;Why temper -- equally or<br/>otherwise?&quot;</p><p>The answer would seem to be because, at times, temperament can be<br/>very convenient. And that&apos;s a long discussion!</p><p>&gt; It seems to me that if it weren&apos;t for the limitations in instruments<br/>&gt; -- an inability to have instruments that are playable in multiple<br/>&gt; keys without wolf tones -- then as a culture we wouldn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; bothered with equal temperament at all. Therefore, it also seems<br/>&gt; that if modern composers want to change keys, and they are<br/>&gt; synthesizing their music, they can just create section 1 in key #1<br/>&gt; and create section 2 in key #2, and to heck with all of the<br/>&gt; imprecision that comes from using any equally tempered scale. (I&apos;m<br/>&gt; using the term &quot;key&quot; loosely; this would be true for all tonal<br/>&gt; music, and I&apos;m not suggesting we only use traditional keys.) Is<br/>&gt; there something I&apos;m missing that&apos;s special harmonically or<br/>&gt; melodically (vs. mathematically) about EDO scales?</p><p>Here I&apos;d say that there&apos;s a difference between shifting the tonic,<br/>final, or more generally &quot;resting note&quot; for a given key, mode, or<br/>modal transposition used in the course of a piece, and using a<br/>circulating system. The second often expedites the first, but the<br/>first may not necessarily require the second.</p><p>In European music, for example, we find that Guillaume de Machaut in<br/>the 14th century has all kinds of artful mutations, shifts, and<br/>creation of a momentary &quot;center&quot; (actual or anticipated) nicely<br/>accommodated by a 12-note Pythagorean tuning which definitely has a<br/>wolf fifth (e.g. G#-Eb). And likewise for 16th-century European music<br/>in a meantone framework (e.g. G#-Eb).</p><p>Likewise, in Near Eastern music based on the maqam and dastgah<br/>systems, an instrument like the 17-note Persian tar tuned in a<br/>definitely noncirculating tuning can cover a vast variety of<br/>transformations or modulations. However, there are also some<br/>limitations: certain modal families are customarily placed on<br/>certain steps and not on others.</p><p>The issue of whether a tuning circulates, and whether it can provides<br/>a great variety of modulations (be they tonal, European modal, Near<br/>Eastern maqam or dastgah, etc.), are two different questions, with<br/>different contexts setting different priorities.</p><p>Thus 12-EDO circulates flawlessly, of course, but simply doesn&apos;t have<br/>the middle or neutral intervals (between major and minor) needed to<br/>play one of the many Near Eastern modes using these intervals<br/>(e.g. neutral seconds at around 135 and 160 cents, adding up to a<br/>minor third of around 295 cents -- or, likely, more precisely the<br/>Pythagoran 32/27 at 294 cents, although as Carl Lumma points out these<br/>intonations can vary by a few cents in either direction).</p><p>In contrast, a 17-note Persian tar tuning typically does not<br/>circulate, but does have the required steps and intervals for lots of<br/>interesting modulations of a kind called for by the Persian dastgah<br/>system.</p><p>And there are lots of situations where a simple JI scale, maybe with<br/>an alternative form or two for certain steps, can make beautiful<br/>music, quite apart from complications which might arise if you were<br/>doing something else. Consider:</p><p>   1/1   9/8   7/6  32/27  21/16  4/3   3/2   27/16  7/4  16/9   2/1<br/>    0    204   267   294    471   498   702    906   969   996  1200</p><p>In this 10-note or decatonic JI scale based on ratios of 2-3-7, we<br/>have &quot;alternative versions&quot; of the minor third, fourth, and minor<br/>seventh (7/6 or 32/27; 21/16 or 4/3; 7/4 or 16/9) at a 64/63 or 27.26<br/>cents apart, the &quot;septimal comma&quot; or &quot;comma of Archytas.&quot;</p><p>It can be used for simple melody or polyphony, although the polyphonic<br/>progressions may be closer to classical 13th-century European<br/>techniques -- or maybe some kind of Javanese or Balinese gamelan<br/>counterpoint -- than to typical jazz, or to 18th-century European<br/>tonality!</p><p>For example, 1/1-7/6-4/3-3/2-7/4-2/1 makes a beautiful pentatonic<br/>scale, and also a kind of JI variation on Javanese or Balinese slendro<br/>as catalogued by Lou Harrison, Jacques Dudon, and others.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t already tried or heard this, an exquisite and<br/>&quot;something else again&quot; progression is</p><p>       7/4    27/16<br/>       3/2    27/16<br/>      21/16    9/8<br/>       1/1     9/8</p><p>And another way to look at this 10-note tuning would be as follows:</p><p>                                    7/6 ----- 7/4 ----- 21/16<br/>                                    /         /          /<br/>                                   /         /          /<br/> 32/27 ----- 16/9 ----- 4/3 ----- 1/1 ----- 3/2 ----- 9/8 ----- 27/16</p><p>Here you&apos;ll see that we have a seven-note chain of pure 3:2 fifths,<br/>plus a three-note chain starting at our 7/6 or narrow minor third<br/>step. The &quot;squares&quot; in this diagram formed by 1/1-7/6-3/2-7/4 or<br/>3/2-7/4-9/8-21/16 are special sonorities which from a jazz perspective<br/>might be called minor seventh chords: I find them especially smooth<br/>and blending. And with the pure fourths and fifths, you&apos;ll also find<br/>lots of quartal and quintal harmony.</p><p>While any tuning, including a JI tuning, will have its limitations,<br/>there&apos;s no reason we can&apos;t use JI tunings -- or, sometimes, tempered<br/>systems with almost identical intervals. A bit of experimenting may<br/>show you what you like and enjoy playing in real time. And a bit of<br/>practice may make the unfamiliar into the routine, although your<br/>mileage may vary!</p><p>&gt;     2. A fair bit of the microtonal music I&apos;ve been listening to<br/>&gt;     (which, honestly, is stuff I can download for free or stream<br/>&gt;     online) uses square, sawtooth, and triangle waves. My<br/>&gt;     understanding is that these waveforms have fairly high<br/>&gt;     amplitudes in the higher-frequency harmonics. Do composers use<br/>&gt;     those sounds because they deliberately want to highlight the<br/>&gt;     clashes among upper partials of those notes?</p><p>Actually one motive, I&apos;d guess, might be to highlight the matching or<br/>&quot;locking in&quot; of partials in JI tunings, or temperaments which closely<br/>approximate JI sonorities. George Secor spoke to me of liking bright<br/>harmonic timbres for his 17-tone well-temperament (17-WT,<br/>secor17wt.scl in the Scala scale archive available with Manuel Op de<br/>Coul&apos;s Scala software program offered for free download on the Web),<br/>which approximates JI sonorities like 7:9:11:13.</p><p>&gt;     3. I know this will vary a lot from composer to composer, but<br/>&gt;     when using microtonal scales, how much do you pay attention to<br/>&gt;     things like leading tones, chord progressions, and other<br/>&gt;     traditional aspects of music theory? People may use them a lot,<br/>&gt;     for all I know, but I don&apos;t see people writing about them as<br/>&gt;     much. Is that because those things are already understood, or<br/>&gt;     because microtonal composers tend to discount their<br/>&gt;     effectiveness in microtonal music, or something else?</p><p>Of course, &quot;traditional aspects of music theory&quot; vary depending on the<br/>tradition, period, and style in question, but I would say that some of<br/>us do pay attention -- while remaining open to new possibilities. And<br/>sometimes this may involve writing a bit of new theory!</p><p>Actually I do tend to write a bit about two situations, for example,<br/>which may illustrate this point.</p><p>The first is applying new kinds of intervals and progressions to a<br/>familiar historical style -- familiar to the author, at least! -- like<br/>13th-14th century European polyphony in a tuning system with middle or<br/>neutral intervals. While it&apos;s possible that these intervals may have<br/>occurred in passing in certain 14th-century European styles of<br/>intonation, using them deliberately in cadential progressions is a<br/>modern addition or amendment to medieval practice and theory.<br/>Thus we often speak of &quot;neomedieval&quot; music.</p><p>Some rules evolve rather naturally. If it&apos;s common in 13th-century<br/>European styles for a minor or major seventh to contract to a fifth by<br/>stepwise contrary motion, then why not a neutral seventh also? At the<br/>same time, there are situations where a neutral seventh may instead<br/>expand to an octave by stepwise contrary motion, as both George Secor<br/>and I have found.</p><p>In developing polyphonic styles for Near Eastern music where the<br/>neutral or middle intervals are themselves a given, but polyphony is<br/>mostly a new element, a similar process takes place. Of course,<br/>there&apos;s the question of taste: what sounds &quot;delightful&quot; to me as a<br/>lover of 13th-century European polyphony might or might not sound so<br/>delightful to a Near Eastern musician!</p><p>There can also be interesting parallels -- and differences -- between<br/>different traditions and styles. Thus medieval European music<br/>sometimes uses _musica ficta_ (&quot;false,&quot; &quot;fictitious,&quot; or &quot;invented&quot;<br/>music), or altered notes not present in the regular gamut (e.g., in<br/>modern notation, F#, C#, G#) for various melodic and especially<br/>polyphonic reasons. Arab theory likewise recognizes a _dint_ (raised<br/>note) or _dunt_ (lowered note), although for more purely melodic<br/>reasons. A performer in either tradition will face choices as to<br/>whether or how often to use such inflections, or to use the regular<br/>form of a step in a given mode.</p><p>Personally, I think questions of this kind are very productive to<br/>discuss on the Tuning list; but it seems that debates on more general<br/>topics often overshadow the specifics of planning, composing, or<br/>improvising music in a given style or &quot;fusion&quot; of styles.</p><p>&gt;     As I said, I&apos;m a newbie, so if the answers are &quot;you haven&apos;t been<br/>&gt;     looking hard enough,&quot; I&apos;m open to that. :) Any suggestions on<br/>&gt;     reading / listening materials would be helpful. I&apos;m just trying<br/>&gt;     to get a little more inside the heads of the people whose<br/>&gt;     discussions I&apos;m following.</p><p>Well, of course, there are many possible sources, especially given<br/>that there is an immense diversity of world musical styles and tuning<br/>systems!</p><p>What I can offer myself is a site with some of my own music plus<br/>renditions of some historical European compositions and a few papers<br/>on theory. Currently I&apos;m involved in the Ethno Extras project to<br/>supplement the outstanding Ethno2 collection by Jacques Dudon<br/>surveying many world musical traditions. My special focus is on Near<br/>Eastern music, although I should emphasize that my knowledge is in one<br/>important sense secondhand, since I have not had the benefit of<br/>training by a teacher which is so central to this art. That is an<br/>important disclaimer!</p><p>For my website, you may visit:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/QuickTour.html">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/QuickTour.html</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, while this is _not_ the same as personal instruction from a<br/>teacher, there are some excellent books and other sources on Near<br/>Eastern musical traditions, maqam/dastgah systems, and some fine<br/>points of intonation. Ozan Yarman has his monumental thesis on Turkish<br/>music available online, for example, and hundreds of pages of a<br/>fascinating thesis by Amine Beyhom on Near Eastern modal systems is<br/>likewise available (mostly in French).</p><p>Of course, these specific sources would be of interest mostly if you<br/>are inclined to explore some Near Eastern music. But this does raise a<br/>more general point.</p><p>While the topic of this list, of course, is &quot;Tuning,&quot; often in<br/>practice this means tuning in a given context. And, as your remarks<br/>suggest, understanding that context can be very helpful in exploring<br/>the fine points of intonation within it, or possibly in pushing its<br/>envelope, so to speak.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=93823 href="#93823">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2010 4:03:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; First, some people may be oriented to types of music which presume<br/>&gt; circulation: that is, a continuous circle of fifths all reasonably<br/>&gt; close to 3:2 which can return to any starting point.</p><p>To clarify: there can be more than one such circle (34et has two, for instance, and 72et has six.)

A hot headed complaint with no alternative solution but instead<br/>a boastful &quot;you&apos;re wrong&quot; or, in this case, &quot;get out of here / off this list!&quot;</p><p>     Realistically though...&quot;Tuning Research&quot; is a good group for people who<br/>want to introduce anything to the world of tuning.   And, despite what Carl<br/>says, the list is about anything but supporting pet theories.  I&apos;d say about 10%<br/>of what is posted there gets anything near unanimous approval by the group.  In<br/>fact most of what goes on is people arguing how other people&apos;s theories can be<br/>improved rather than saying their theories are correct.  A prime example: Marcel<br/>made a bunch of new versions of Drei Equili which failed to get approval and<br/>only recently has gotten a version that virtually everyone on the list agrees is<br/>better sounding than 5-limit JI and, even then, they&apos;ve said &quot;but you still have<br/>yet to prove it against 1/4 comma meantone and 31TET!&quot; and have not accepted<br/>Marcel&apos;s open/yet-unproved claims that only 53TET can compete with his scale.<br/>Nothing on there goes through unchecked...trust me.</p><p>     Summary: that list is about open-minded arguments...and anything but<br/>randomly boosting each others egos...but it&apos;s probably pretty lousy for those<br/>looking for &quot;proven&quot; results since most of what floats around there is<br/>work/theories in progress.</p><p>  My take is that perhaps, Ozan, you should start an academically focused<br/>Ethnomusicology list if you are frustrated with Carl and invite others from this<br/>list to join and/or work on moving this list in that direction.</p><p>One way I see it is this is to divide the lists like this:</p><p>A) This &quot;Tuning&quot; list: academic tuning (IE reviewing existing tuning<br/>documentation, including ethno-musicology, with the idea of either debating<br/>things referenced in several papers OR not debating at all).<br/>B)  The &quot;Tuning Research&quot; list to focus on development of new micro-tonal ideas<br/>with the idea of trying to gather useful parts of theories regardless of whether<br/>we agree with the theories as a whole or not.  Built with the idea of debate,<br/>constant improvement, and the idea that the best answer is one that inspires<br/>much interest for development and improvement (and conversely no answer is &quot;the<br/>most right&quot;).<br/>C) The MMM list: finished works, microtonal production ideas (lists of<br/>synths/software/etc.), compositional ideas that have been well tested by the<br/>poster for use by other composers, and detailed sound examples as proofs of<br/>theories such as those posted on &quot;tuning theory&quot; and this list.  I figure all<br/>&quot;final draft&quot;/ &quot;composed&quot; products end up on MMM.</p><p>    However...I don&apos;t even see A happening with this list if even other people<br/>gung-ho about making the Tuning list more academically based like Ozan or<br/>professional musicians like Neil Haverstick can even find a way to get along<br/>with Carl.  That is, unless Carl turns around and starts giving other academic<br/>masters like Ozan fair credit and influence...which, judging by his quote above<br/>and countless others, I have doubts will ever happen.</p></div><h3><a id=93877 href="#93877">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2010 9:03:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s word of a forthcoming 1TB torrent containing all<br/>&gt; of Geocities.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2720">http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2720</a></p><p>I went through those search results I mentioned and found<br/>these refs, in case anybody does have 1TB to spare (at least<br/>temporarily) for that torrent:</p><p>~</p><p>The 22TET page has been updated.
