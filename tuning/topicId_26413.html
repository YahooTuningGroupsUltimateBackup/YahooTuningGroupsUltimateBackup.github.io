I already<br/>have plans for some specific meetings, but would welcome<br/>the opportunity to see as many of you as I can fit into<br/>my itinerary.</p><p>The centerpiece of the trip is the ISMA (International<br/>Symposium on Musical Acoustics) 2001 Conference in Perugia,<br/>Italy, for which I am an Invited Speaker.</p><p>My lecture on &quot;John Dowland&apos;s Lute: An Early Well-Temperament&quot;<br/>will be presented in the Special Demo Session after the<br/>Workshop (Gestural Interfaces and Control of Expressiveness<br/>in Microtonality) on Thursday, September 13.  Wim Hoogewerf<br/>will be joining me in the presentation, as he will perform<br/>some pieces by Dowland in Dowland&apos;s preferred tuning, on his<br/>Vogt guitar with moveable frets.</p><p>My presentation will be an expansion of my Dowland webpage:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p>The funds and time I have available for this trip are both<br/>extremely limited, and I have had to make my visit shorter<br/>and much less extensive than I had originally hoped.</p><p>I will be flying into Paris on September 5 and spending<br/>the first few days there.  The Conference will be the entire<br/>week of September 10-15, and I hope to be able to visit<br/>Rome and Florence either before or after, since they are<br/>both quite close to Perugia.</p><p>Then after the Conference I will be visiting Amsterdam<br/>and Den Haag in the Netherlands, where Manuel Op de Coul,<br/>Robert Walker (and possibly also Graham Breed) and I will<br/>meet, primarily to focus on development of the JustMusic<br/>software.  Lastly, I will spend a few more days in Paris,<br/>from where I leave on September 23.</p><p>If anyone living in Europe can provide me with suggestions,<br/>advice, or assistance regarding inexpensive hotels or<br/>other places to stay, and regarding transportation, it would<br/>be most appreciated.  I am particularly interested in being<br/>able to visit some other places outside the cities I have<br/>indicated, if it is possible to travel to them.</p><p>Please respond privately.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26494 href="#26494">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2001 6:08:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Then after the Conference I will be visiting Amsterdam<br/>&gt; and Den Haag in the Netherlands, where Manuel Op de Coul,<br/>&gt; Robert Walker (and possibly also Graham Breed) and I will<br/>&gt; meet, primarily to focus on development of the JustMusic<br/>&gt; software.

I may end up driving with someone from Italy to<br/>Amsterdam, beginning on September 15.  Depending on whether<br/>I drive or fly, I expect to be in Amsterdam somewhere around<br/>September 16-20 or so.  I would definitely like to stop in<br/>and meet the folks at the Huyghens-Fokker Foundation.  Part<br/>of the trip thru Netherlands will be in the Den Haag area also.</p><p>Would also like to meet Siemen Terpstra if he&apos;s around.<br/>We&apos;d have a lot to discuss re: Sumerian/Babylonian tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; (And Monz, any news on that ZTar?)</p><p>I&apos;ve been *ridiculously* busy the last two weeks... I did<br/>manage to talk to Harvey briefly last week but no concrete<br/>info yet.  I&apos;ll try to reach him Saturday.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26531 href="#26531">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>7/30/2001 2:18:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote:<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll be visiting the museum in Haarlem with<br/>&gt; Fokker&apos;s instruments, won&apos;t we?</p><p>Unfortunately the 31-tone organ is no longer there because<br/>the Teyler&apos;s Museum had an alteration.
