Has anybody noticed this?  Try it!</p><p>I thought, &quot;Gee, maybe that&apos;s 10/9-&gt;6/5 vs. 9/8-5/4...&quot;  I took a look at<br/>it a few months ago and found to my horror that I wasn&apos;t singing &quot;me&quot; as<br/>6/5 either.   I was much closer to 19/16.  I thought maybe I was leaning<br/>toward 32/27, for chain-of-fifth reasons (or perhaps 19/16 for harmonic<br/>reasons --- maybe even 300 cents, for cultural reasons).</p><p>I fiddled some more yesterday, and found I liked the minor third even<br/>flatter than 32/27.  In fact that ratio seemed to be the upper limit of a<br/>range of desirable minor thirds (7/6 being the lower limit).  I fiddled<br/>with all the notes in the major and minor do-re-me&apos;s, and finally came up<br/>with this (in cents, because I couldn&apos;t find a rational explanation)...</p><p>tone    do  re   me<br/>major   0   210  390<br/>minor   0   182  285</p><p>Here are the ranges...</p><p>tone   re       me<br/>major  200-215  385-400<br/>minor  180-200  270-295</p><p>I used one timbre for the entire thing; a wavetable reed organ patch.  I<br/>would play &quot;do&quot;, sing do-re-me, and then play re and me to compare.  This<br/>is where the ranges came from.  Then, I made a scala file with a bunch of<br/>notes in every range, and played around until I got the specific notes<br/>above.  Would anybody care to try this?  What are your preferences?</p><p>It is worthwhile mentioning that if I first played the dyad me/do, and then<br/>sang do-re-me, &quot;me&quot; would always come out where I had heard it in the dyad,<br/>and would sound natural, even if outside the range.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
