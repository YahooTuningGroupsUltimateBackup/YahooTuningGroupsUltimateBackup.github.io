Note that the<br/>&gt;generator here can be either a fifth or a major third. They end up as the<br/>&gt;same 8 note scale. In 12-tET it is 12121212. Outside of 12-tET the minor<br/>&gt;thirds must stay at 300 cents but you are free to narrow the fifths to<br/>&gt;improve the major thirds.</p><p>Aha!  Thanks.  So we can describe the octatonic scale as two chains of<br/>minor thirds a fifth apart.  Any improvement over 12-tET is going to be<br/>very small.</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s the 9 note proper scale with 12 triads, based on 3 chains of fifths<br/>&gt;(or minor thirds) 1/3 octave apart. In 12-tET it&apos;s 121121121. The major<br/>&gt;thirds are stuck at 400 cents but you can widen the fifths to improve the<br/>&gt;minor thirds. If you lose an outside note you lose 3 triads. Lose a second<br/>&gt;note on the same side and you only lose another 2 triads, leaving 7 triads<br/>&gt;in 7 notes.</p><p>Wild.  Unfortunately, neither the major or minor versions of this 7-note<br/>structure are anywhere near proper, and their triads do not occur on a<br/>regular pattern of scale steps.</p><p>&gt;Do these symmetrical 8 and 9 note scales have standard names?</p><p>I am not familiar with the 9-note, but the 8-note one is commonly<br/>called the &quot;octatonic&quot; scale.  Messiaen is known for using it and<br/>writing about it, but Stravinsky also used it extensively, and I<br/>believe Rimski-Korsakov was the first to use it.</p><p>&gt;By the way, why is this stuff in a thread called &quot;more on composing in X<br/>&gt;tuning&quot;? It doesn&apos;t seem to have anything to do with composing per se.<br/>&gt;&quot;Good 5-limit scale generators&quot; seemed like a perfectly good title to me.</p><p>I have no idea.  I changed it back.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=13927 href="#13927">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2000 8:02:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13926">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13926</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am not familiar with the 9-note, but the 8-note one is commonly<br/>&gt; called the &quot;octatonic&quot; scale.
