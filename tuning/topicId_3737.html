For reference, here are all the saturated chords at each<br/>&gt; harmonic limit through 13 (octave equivalence is assumed):</p><p>Hello, there, and we are evidently in agreement on the matter of<br/>&quot;saturated&quot; sonorities.</p><p>The list of saturated sonorities leads me to offer a comment on one<br/>matter from a medieval (or medievalist) viewpoint: the definition of a<br/>saturated 3-limit sonority.</p><p>The list which you quote proposes:</p><p>&gt; 3-limit:<br/>&gt; ratios                                    cents<br/>&gt; 3:2 (=1/3:1/2)                            0 702</p><p>If one considers only nonoctaval intervals, then this is quite<br/>correct, and of course in much traditional music it is customary to<br/>treat the octave as a kind of &quot;compound unison&quot; rather than a distinct<br/>interval in its own right.</p><p>From a medieval viewpoint, however, there are _three_ simple<br/>_symphoniae_ or stable concords: the octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), and<br/>fourth (4:3). According to Johannes de Grocheio (c. 1300), the _trina<br/>harmoniae perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot; is<br/>manifested when _all three_ of these concords are sounded at once:<br/>that is in a sonority such as D3-A3-D4. This &quot;trine&quot; (borrowed from<br/>Grocheio&apos;s _trina_) has an outer 2:1 octave, a lower 3:2 fifth, and an<br/>upper 4:3 fourth.</p><p>As Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous I (c. 1300) and Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325)<br/>remark, the fourth can also be placed below the fifth, e.g. D3-G3-D4,<br/>but this arrangement is not as harmonious as the first.</p><p>If one follows this medieval approach and recognizes the 3-limit trine<br/>as the &quot;saturated harmony&quot; of the era, then our table might be revised<br/>to read as follows:</p><p> 3-limit:<br/> ratios                                    cents<br/> 2:3:4                                     0 702 1200<br/> 1/2:1/3:1/4                               0 498 1200</p><p>Of course, such recognition of the octave as a &quot;real&quot; interval<br/>specifically in a 3-limit (or specifically medieval European 3-limit<br/>setting) might raise the question of why this interval might be<br/>treated as more of a duplication in 5-limit or higher systems. There<br/>are at least two possible answers, other than the argument from<br/>&quot;historical correctness&quot; in following medieval theorists themselves.</p><p>First, the complete 3-limit trine has the interesting property of<br/>consisting of three successive partials, with the lowest partial an<br/>even power or two (i.e. an even octave) of the fundamental --<br/>2:3:4. It shares this property with the 5-limit major triad. In<br/>contrast, a 5-limit triad plus octave (4:5:6:8) does not share this<br/>&quot;adjacency&quot; property.</p><p>Secondly, the octave (2:1) is only one intuitive &quot;consonance category&quot;<br/>removed from the most richly stable trinic (3-limit) concords, the<br/>fifth and fourth. We might possibly say that the octave is &quot;2-limit,&quot;<br/>the fifth and fourth &quot;3-limit.&quot; In contrast, an octave added to a<br/>5-limit triad is _two_ such categories removed from the richest stable<br/>intervals (the fifth of the triad being one category removed, like the<br/>octave of a trine).</p><p>More experientially speaking, I do tend to hear that moving from a<br/>simple 3:2 fifth to a complete 2:3:4 trine (including octave and upper<br/>fourth) &quot;adds more&quot; than moving from a complete 4:5:6 triad to 4:5:6:8<br/>(with the octave).</p><p>The first point might be more theoretically neat than the second,<br/>since the 6:4 fifth of 4:5:6:7 is also two categories removed from the<br/>richest stable intervals of this 7-limit sonority, the 7:4 minor<br/>seventh and the 7:5 diminished fifth. Yet it&apos;s unlikely that anyone<br/>would argue that this fifth is not a &quot;real&quot; interval.</p><p>In a medieval setting, I would go with the complete trine as the<br/>definition of 3-limit saturation; for a more general kind of theory,<br/>the issue may be more controversial. One possible argument in favor of<br/>considering the trinic octave as a &quot;real&quot; interval is that we then<br/>have a 3-limit otonality (2:3:4) and utonality (1/2:1/3:1/4). This<br/>would permit a certain gratifying symmetry with 5-limit major and<br/>minor triads.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=3742 href="#3742">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

While there are some<br/>registral or spacing techniques avaiable which might assist the listener in<br/>disambiguating the sonorities mentioned, the last attempts to extend the<br/>representation of higher identities by 12tet collapsed under their own<br/>inconsistancies. Witness the static (non-transposable) pseudo-harmonic<br/>constructs of Skryabin and Obuchov, Schoenberg&apos;s letter to Yasser, and the<br/>attempts by Schoenberg and Hindemith to describe 12tet intervals in terms<br/>of harmonic series.

Most of his other pieces imply 24tet from the<br/>notation, but my understanding is that he is not after precise<br/>24th-root-of-two intervals, but rather microtonal inflections of 12. At<br/>Tenney&apos;s Darmstadt lecture, Ferneyhough was rather pointed in saying that<br/>he heard 12tet intervals as broadly defined, i.e. inflectable, without<br/>reference to their rational neighbors.</p><p>This is quite different from the approach of either Babbitt or Balzano, who<br/>both are able to hear their chosen temperaments (12 and 20, respectively)<br/>by focusing on group symmetries. Anyone with doubts about this ought to<br/>meet either of these guys -- they both have fantastic ears and get around<br/>in their respective tunings with incredible ease. (Balzano chose 20tet<br/>because it was a division of the octave with the same number of factors as<br/>12tet).</p><p>As to Ferneyhough&apos;s scores and performer fatigue, I can only say that there<br/>are quite a few players who find his pieces tremendously rewarding to play,<br/>in part because the impossibility of exactly executing the notation forces<br/>the player to become creative within the disciplined environment of the<br/>notation. This has always struck me as a bit dishonest, but it doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to be an issue to either F. or his players, and the world&apos;s certainly big<br/>enough to acommodate disagreement on this point.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
