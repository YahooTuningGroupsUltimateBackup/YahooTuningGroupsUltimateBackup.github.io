The c5 is fixed tuning, and the intervals ARE<br/>meantonish, a quality dictated by the conflict between thirds and<br/>fifths.  The deviation from 12-tET, arranged in a circle of fifths<br/>(0==C, 11==B):</p><p> ( E4 11 42  (For pitch  4, we have target bend   6.7602) )<br/>   EC 6A 44  (For pitch 11, we have target bend  15.2843)<br/>   E6 15 44  (For pitch  6, we have target bend  13.1738)<br/>   E1 1A 42  (For pitch  1, we have target bend   6.9875)<br/>   E8 14 41  (For pitch  8, we have target bend   3.6702)<br/>   E3 57 40  (For pitch  3, we have target bend   2.1743)<br/>   EB 00 40  (For pitch 10, we have target bend   0.0093)<br/>   E5 2A 3F  (For pitch  5, we have target bend  -2.1488)<br/>   E0 4B 3D  (For pitch  0, we have target bend  -7.6434)<br/>   E7 64 3C  (For pitch  7, we have target bend -10.1997)<br/>   E2 4A 3B  (For pitch  2, we have target bend -13.9894)<br/>   EA 47 3B  (For pitch  9, we have target bend -14.0784)<br/> ( E4 11 42  (For pitch  4, we have target bend   6.7602) )</p><p>Pitch 4 (E) is ambiguous; the rest fall clearly along a meantone-like<br/>tuning, with every fifth a few cents flat.</p><p>As to 7-limit, only tritones make the tuning any different than 5-limit,<br/>and, looking at your piece now, I see that the only significant tritone<br/>is between note 3 and 9, an interval which is already well narrowed in<br/>the context of the piece.</p><p>If you don&apos;t hear much difference between the c5 and the cs5, that&apos;s<br/>probably good - I haven&apos;t jarred you with tuning motion.  The cs5 should<br/>be a touch sweeter in its intervals - listen for fifths particularly.</p><p>[Mats:]<br/>&gt;I should do a real 12tet/retuned version instead of this one which is<br/>&gt;merely a conversion of the original version(in the 17-tone schismic<br/>&gt;scale).</p><p>Not sure what distinction you&apos;re drawing here.</p><p>&gt;Put them up if you want.</p><p>I&apos;m still remote from my web site&apos;s ISP, so there&apos;s not much movement<br/>there.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
