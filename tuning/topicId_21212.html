In my preliminary researches into this field I&apos;ve<br/>come across an excellent source book that I&apos;d like to share with y&apos;all.<br/>It&apos;s called &apos;Musical Instruments of the World - an Illustrated<br/>Encyclopedia by the Diagram Group&apos;. It is published by different<br/>publishers in different countries so I&apos;ll give you the ISBN which is 0<br/>8467 0143 0 and you can get a 2nd hand copy at a reasonable price from<br/>Amazon though it took me a while to find it. I&apos;ve &apos;borrowed&apos; mine from<br/>Edinburgh Library for an &apos;extended&apos; loan if you know what I mean ; - )</p><p>The book is filled with detailed drawings of instruments from every<br/>instrument type from all over the world with details on construction and<br/>playing (but not tuning be it noted! ). I recommend it particularly for<br/>anyone looking for design ideas for Partch-like instruments. Truly<br/>inspiring.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/17/2001 11:05:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve come across an excellent source book that I&apos;d like to share<br/>&gt; with y&apos;all.
