When John first mentioned the Golden tuning several months<br/>ago, I thought that it was generated by setting the ratio of whole<br/>tone/diatonic semitone to phi.  (The two are equivalent, of course.)<br/>The self-similarity that Brian mentions was apparent to me also, and it<br/>occurred to me to speculate about an even more self-similar (by my<br/>lights, anyway) tuning: one in which the ratio of the octave to the<br/>fifth is equal to the ratio of the whole tone to the diatonic semitone.<br/>Mathematically, that ratio works out to sqrt(5/2)-1, or (as a continued<br/>fraction) 0;1,1,2.  It can also therefore be represented by self-similar<br/>rectangles reduced by squares, thus:</p><p>+-----+-----+---+------------------------+<br/>|     |     |XXX|                        |<br/>|     |     |XXX|                        |<br/>|     |     |XXX|                        |<br/>+-----+-----+---+                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>|               |                        |<br/>+---------------+------------------------+</p><p>In case your font is not proportioned as mine is, the X-filled<br/>rectangle is supposed to be similar to the large one; the other four<br/>spaces are supposed to be square.  This is a visual representation of<br/>subtracting a fifth from an octave, then a fourth from a fifth, then two<br/>wholetones from a fourth.</p><p>I think of this as my &quot;recursive&quot; meantone because wholetones are<br/>subdivided exactly as the octave is.  To illustrate: if the 1/1 is<br/>consider position 0, three steps in the positive and negative directions<br/>around the spiral of fifths generate a dorian scale, thus:</p><p>|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|<br/>0           2     -3          -1           1           3     -2           0</p><p>Now, if you consider what the next (nearest; smallest absolute-value)<br/>steps that fall between, say, -1 and 1 will be, they are:</p><p>|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|<br/>-1         -13     18          6          -6          -18     13          1</p><p>and the sizes of the intervals will be in the same ratios; the process<br/>can be continued infinitely.  Unfortunately, as with Brian&apos;s schemes I<br/>can imagine no way to make these mathematical relationships actually<br/>audible in a composition.</p><p>sqrt(5/2)-1 comes to about 0.5811388.  This times 1200 cents/octave<br/>makes a fifth of 697.36660 cents.  This is about two-thirds of the way<br/>from 1/4 comma to 1/5 comma meantone, or 3/14 comma.  (It is also very<br/>well approximated by 74-tet.)  In actual practice, I at least cannot<br/>distinguish this tuning from 1/5 comma meantone, so for yet another<br/>reason the whole house of cards comes crashing down.  However, 1/5 comma<br/>meantone is one of my favorite tunings, so I don&apos;t mind too much. 8-)&gt;</p><p>--pH (<a href="mailto:manynote@library.wustl.edu">manynote@library.wustl.edu</a> or <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a>)<br/>       O<br/>      /\             &quot;How about that?
