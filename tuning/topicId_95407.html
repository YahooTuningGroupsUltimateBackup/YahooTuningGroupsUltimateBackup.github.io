For three, we have (0,4,8) and (0,5,9) and for four<br/>we have (0,3,6,9) and (0,4,7,10) (Also harmonic divisions would just be the mirror inverse of the arithmetic ones). Now I thought it would<br/>be interesting to find the differences between these in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; which would be between steps 3 and 10 (for arithmetic/geometric) and between steps 2 and 9 (for geometric/harmonic). both represent comparing linear and logarithmic divisions of the octave.</p><p>Now, it&apos;s kind of interesting that you can take 12:13:14:...23:24 in both kinds of divisions --- and in the sweet spot you get these ratios<br/>when comparing them, always roughly a semitone:</p><p>1.0394<br/>1.0511<br/>1.0583<br/>1.0614<br/>1.0607<br/>1.0564<br/>1.0500<br/>1.0406</p><p>Kind of a bell curve, going up and down. Now cleaning up a bit by<br/>capitalizing on harmonic divisions we can throw out 3 and also add a 2 step, and for symmetry get</p><p>1.0406<br/>1.0500<br/>1.0564<br/>1.0607<br/>1.0614<br/>1.0607<br/>1.0564<br/>1.0500<br/>1.0406</p><p>Or going the other way</p><p>1.0226<br/>1.0394<br/>1.0511<br/>1.0583<br/>1.0614<br/>1.0583<br/>1.0511<br/>1.0394<br/>1.0226</p><p>which is not as good.</p><p>Now to just fill in 1 and 11, which can be done easily when comparing<br/>0,4,7,10 and 1,4,7,10 or 0,5,9 and 1,5,9 and 2,5,8,0 and 2,5,8,11 or<br/>3,7,0 and 3,7,11, where one can use 1.0583 or 1.0511, I prefer the first because it is so close to a semitone. Finally, obtain</p><p>1.0583<br/>1.0406<br/>1.0500<br/>1.0564<br/>1.0607<br/>1.0614<br/>1.0607<br/>1.0564<br/>1.0500<br/>1.0406<br/>1.0583</p><p>which I guess in some way shows that in 12-tET this ratio is pretty stable. This is 7-limit, so I guess taking only 5-limit steps (which would be steps 3,4,5,7,8,9 (leave out 6, which is 17) and find that<br/>the error all around is</p><p>1.0500<br/>1.0511 or 1.0564<br/>1.0583 or 1.0607</p><p>etc</p><p>which is always within .001, about 1 percent, roughly the error of the major third (5/4) in 12-tET. (14 cents)</p></div>
