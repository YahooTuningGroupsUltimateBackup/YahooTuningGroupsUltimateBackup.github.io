I like variety, and generally, the song dictates the<br/>scale. I enjoy 19 immensely; it&apos;s real deceptive and subtle, and great<br/>for extending the frontiers of jazz, blues, and a lot of pop music.<br/>&quot;African Stick...&quot; this uses a 7 note scale, built off of C, F, and G<br/>triads, with a raised 3rd in each triad...C-D-E#-F-G-A#-B#<br/>&quot;Birdwalk&quot;, &quot;667 Shuffle...&quot; these tunes use a modified blues scale,<br/>which comes out<br/>C-Eb-F-F#-Gb-G-A#-Bb...of course, you can also add the major 3rd, E, and<br/>the #2nd. 19 is great for blues...<br/>&quot;Swing 19...&quot; this uses a scale built off the main riff of the song...<br/>E#-F-A#-B-D#-G#-Bb-B#..some of the notes are in one octave, some in the<br/>next. I haven&apos;t developed this as much as I&apos;d like.<br/>Krantz scale...Richard Krantz, compadre of Starrett and myself, found a<br/>bunch of 11 note scales that are real hip...here&apos;s one...<br/>G-Ab-A#-B-C-Db-D-Eb-E-F-Gb...I am writing a couple of tunes that use<br/>this, and I&apos;ve worked out the scale tone chords as well..this one has a<br/>lot of potential, and there&apos;s a bunch more of them, too.<br/>&quot;The Spider...&quot; this uses a 19 tone row, shaped into several different<br/>riffs...I&apos;m too lazy to write down the sequence...every time I play it,<br/>I have to relearn it, cause it&apos;s about the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever<br/>played in my life. I have more scales in 19, but these will do.</p><p>34 tone scales...I haven&apos;t written as much in 34...&quot;34 Steps&quot; is simple,<br/>uses a whole tone scale (I guess that makes it a 17 eq scale), one motif<br/>based off of B, one off of G. &quot;From the West&quot; uses an 11 tone scale I<br/>made up; I can&apos;t find my notebook, so I can&apos;t remember the exact cents<br/>values of all the notes. It does have some marvelous intervals,<br/>including a small half step of about 70cents above the root; two minor<br/>3rds, one at 5/4 (2 cents #), and the other a fret lower ( about 2cents<br/>off the 20/17), a major 3rd, a major 7th, and a one fret # major 7th.<br/>Sorry for the memory gaps...I&apos;m getting old and crusty. Most of the<br/>notes in this scale are very close to pure, and it resonates very<br/>powerfully. My tune &quot;Other Worlds&quot; is a free improv in 34, and God alone<br/>knows how many notes are used...a lot. I have a tune on my next CD which<br/>uses a real free, atonal approach, in a 34 rock context...Zeppelin meets<br/>McLaughlin...nasty. Thanks for the interest, keep me posted...Hstick<br/>BTW, another tune on my upcoming disc, uses the notorious comma as the<br/>main chordal movement...a C major chord drops one fret to another C<br/>major chord, and there&apos;s also tw G majors as well...it&apos;s rather<br/>haunting...</p></div><h3><a id=27383 href="#27383">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2001 5:07:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well,i&apos;m sure you got your own reasons for what you&apos;re doing,but in this format they just don&apos;t say that much for me.Only about the scale from African Stick:if you add E and either G# or A,you get the 9-tone MOS i call <a href="http://pentaenharmonic.Like">pentaenharmonic.Like</a> this:</p><p>C D E E# F G G# A# B# C<br/>C D E E# F G A A# B# C</p><p>A very useful scale,there are 7 fifths and all kinds of 3 and 4-note chords in it.</p><p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/> MATS &#xFFFD;LJARE<br/> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare">http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare</a></p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></p></div>
