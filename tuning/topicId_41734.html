The difference I see is between those who react to music as sound, and those who react to it as score. (As performance is another quesion.)</p><p>To someone who sees music as sound, how many accidentals a score employs is not a consideration; praising a piece for using many or for using few is equally absurd. To someone who regards music as sound, the difference between JI and temperament vanishes if it becomes inaudible; to someone whose appreciation centers on the score, this misses the whole point; the knowledge that the score is JI can produce one kind of shiver, and the suggestion that it could just as easily not be another and less plesant kind.</p><p>I fail to understand the score point of view, but if someone manages to extract meaning from it then I say go for it. I hope, however, that they will understand that my comments are either from the sound point of view or simply fallout from looking at things mathematically.</p></div>
