The main point of surprise is that<br/>&gt; people&apos;s brains seemed to accept 11:16 as a perfectly good &apos;fifth&apos;,<br/>&gt; given sine-wave timbres and a good third in between. 11:16 is 1.4545..<br/>&gt; or 649 cents - but most blind guesses were 3:2!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you can&apos;t *distinguish* between 1.5 and 1.454 something is<br/>&gt; definitely wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course *identifying* any complex interval blind, without<br/>&gt; comparisons, and with sine waves - which is what I challenged people<br/>&gt; to do - is much more difficult.<br/>&gt; I could well believe that pure interval identification in this sense<br/>&gt; is subject to a big uncertainty, maybe tens of cents.<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes that is interesting. I&apos;m sure your experiment does show that there<br/>has to be a &apos;range&apos; of give around each interval (As I mentioned, I&apos;ve<br/>never ever done a gig where my guitar stayed exactly in tune<br/>electronically at the end of a set). But by the same token,you&apos;ll find<br/>that 512:609:768 isn&apos;t miles away at all (just because the numbers are<br/>large) because 609/512 = 1.1894...and IS a much better approx. to the<br/>tempered min 3 as 1.1892...than 6/5 = 1.2 or 19/16 = 1.1875. And as I<br/>also mentioned, 11:13:16 could possibly be more related to a minor<br/>triad from the fourth degree, so that the root note 11 here is close<br/>to the fourth , 16 being 8ve to the tonic 1.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=80243 href="#80243">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>1/23/2009 8:06:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; If you can&apos;t *distinguish* between 1.5 and 1.454 something is</p><p>&gt; definitely wrong.</p><p>To Carl, Charles, and others,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted, they ARE different and the point I am about to make is probably &quot;historically wrong&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, here&apos;s an interesting fact (at least to my ears).&nbsp; 1.4545, despite being an &quot;impure fifth&quot;, still sounds deceptively pure...enough so to substitute for a 5th in a musical/emotional context (which is ultimately kind of the point, right)?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it seems virtually all fractions which either result in.........<br/>A) repeating decimals like x.3333 or x.454545 or x.727272 sound great to my ears.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR<br/>B) decimals which cancel out perfectly after very little length such as 1.5, 1.125, 1.25...<br/>&nbsp;.........sound very very natural!!<br/>*****************************************************************************************<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, I doubt this is coincidence.&nbsp; In fact look at this<br/> 12-tone<br/> scale<br/>1/1<br/>1.055555<br/>1.2<br/>1.25<br/>1.3125<br/>1.375<br/>1.44<br/>1.5<br/>1.63636363<br/>1.72727272<br/>1.83333333<br/>1.91666666<br/>2/1</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the tones so close together that they beat sound quite harmonic, or at least to my ears.<br/>&nbsp; **************************************************************************************<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any thought or ideas...on either why this happens or if I am in fact correct, that the ear has an affinity for fractions in scales which reduce to simple and/or redundant decimals?</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=80257 href="#80257">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2009 6:47:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, djtrancendance@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you can&apos;t *distinguish* between 1.5 and 1.454 something is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; definitely wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To Carl, Charles, and others,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Granted, they ARE different and the point I am about to make is<br/>probably &quot;historically wrong&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    However, here&apos;s an interesting fact (at least to my ears).<br/>1.4545, despite being an &quot;impure fifth&quot;, still sounds deceptively<br/>pure...enough so to substitute for a 5th in a musical/emotional<br/>context (which is ultimately kind of the point, right)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In fact, it seems virtually all fractions which either result<br/>in.........<br/>&gt; A) repeating decimals like x.3333 or x.454545 or x.727272 sound<br/>great to my ears.<br/>&gt;     OR<br/>&gt; B) decimals which cancel out perfectly after very little length such<br/>as 1.5, 1.125, 1.25...<br/>&gt;  .........sound very very natural!!<br/>&gt;<br/>*****************************************************************************************<br/>&gt;    Somehow, I doubt this is coincidence.
