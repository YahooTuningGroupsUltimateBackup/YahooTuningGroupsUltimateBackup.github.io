The third step of Rast is<br/>often tuned either around 16/13 (359 cents) or around 5/4 (386 cents),<br/>Thus Turkish Rast often has a middle third at around 16/13, or a bit<br/>higher (e.g. 21/17 or 26/21), although at times this step approaches<br/>the region of 5/4. The 5/4-ish flavor is described by Safi al-Din<br/>al-Urmawi (later 13th century) and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (around<br/>1300), while Safi al-Din&apos;s &quot;medium sundered&quot; tetrachord<br/>(1/1-9/8-99/80-4/3 or 0-204-369-498 cents) nicely fits a &quot;largish<br/>neutral third&quot; version.</p><p>More specifically, 350 cents would evidently be too low for a stylish<br/>Turkish Rast, where a &quot;low&quot; but acceptable third might be around<br/>16/13; a common historical choice, 26/21 or so (which I often favor);<br/>and a &quot;high&quot; placement somewhere approaching 5/4, maybe 380 cents or<br/>so, or comparable to the near-5/4 of 19-EDO or 22-EDO.</p><p>The 53-comma model popular in Turkey and Syria would sum up this<br/>situation by saying that a Rast tetrachord may be 9 7 6 or 9 8 5.<br/>The Syrian theorist al-Sabbagh favors the first form, while the<br/>&quot;theoryVSpractice&quot; study has shown that Turkish musicians may lean<br/>toward 9 7 6 commas (e.g. 1/1-9/8-16/13-4/3 or 1/1-9/8-21/17-4/3) or<br/>the 5-limit-like 9-8-5 commas (e.g. 1/1-9/8-5/4-4/3).</p><p>When people are measured with 21st-century technology playing on the<br/>Turkish ney, for example, genera or ajnas much like those described by<br/>Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din seven centuries ago, or Ibn Sina a<br/>millennium ago, and distinct from 24-EDO, I tend to take these<br/>theorists quite seriously.</p><p>Compare, for example, the measured intervals in Niyazi&apos;s Sayin&apos;s<br/>Ushshak Ney Taksim (Ozan&apos;s thesis, p. 29) with either the original<br/>form or a permutation of a tuning by Ibn Sina in the early 11th<br/>century at 28:26:24:21 or 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3:</p><p>     Measured:    123.47       137.13      227.87</p><p>     Ibn Sina:     14:13        13:12        8:7<br/>                  128.30       138.57      231.17</p><p>Cameron: In approaching Maqam &grave;Iraq, my first general impression is<br/>that we&apos;ll start with a lower Sikah trichord having a smallish<br/>neutral second and third, maybe 1/1-13/12-11/9 in a &quot;moderate&quot;<br/>interpretation or 1/1-14/13-40/33 in a &quot;low&quot; one. I&apos;d expect the first<br/>interval to be substantially lower than 12/11 or 150 cents, although<br/>the third might be around 11/9, and thus not too far from 350 cents.</p><p>Here are a &quot;low&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; version of Maqam &grave;Iraq, the former<br/>using a nuance favored by at least one Syrian source where the fourth<br/>is about a comma narrow, with the tempered O3 tuning in cents, and<br/>then a JI interpretation:</p><p>Low &grave;Iraq (ascending)</p><p>       Sikah              Bayyati              Rast<br/>   |-------------|----------------------|-----------------|<br/>   0    127     334    472    623      831      1038     1200<br/>  1/1  14/13   40/33  21/16  56/39    21/13     51/28    2/1<br/>   0    128     333    471    626      830      1038     1200</p><p>Moderate &grave;Iraq (ascending)</p><p>         Sikah            Bayyati              Rast<br/>   |-------------|----------------------|-----------------|<br/>   0    138     346    497    635      843      1050     1200<br/>  1/1  13/12   11/9    4/3   13/9     13/8      11/6     2/1<br/>   0    139     347    497    637      841      1049     1200</p><p>A subtle point of the Syrian tuning with its near-21/16 step (at 21<br/>commas) is that in this way we can get a more idiomatic Bayyati<br/>tetrachord with the smaller middle or neutral second first. In Syrian<br/>theory, this would be 6 7 9 commas (about 136-158-204 cents), while<br/>here it is 138-150-208 cents or so, close to 1/1-13/12-13/11-4/3). The<br/>second version, while not wrong, gives a less &quot;stylish&quot; Bayyati<br/>tetrachord at 1/1-12/11-13/11-4/3, a common flavor of Turkish Ushshaq,<br/>for example (around 7 6 9 commas), but the reverse of the usual<br/>pattern for Arab Bayyati. Scott Marcus, reporting on the practice of<br/>traditional Egyptian musicians, notes a preference for tuning the<br/>first interval of Maqam Bayyati somewhere around 135-145 cents, but in<br/>any event as the smaller of the two middle or neutral seconds.</p><p>More exactly, the Syrian model is 6-9|6-7-9|9-7 commas or, in 53-EDO,<br/>0-136-340-475-634-838-1042-1200 cents, or 136-204|136-158-204|204-158<br/>cents. This may be compared with the tempered versions above, with<br/>the understanding that the 53-EDO values are a general guide rather than<br/>a precise specification for Syrian musicians of this tradition.</p><p>Michael: As Hormoz Farhat discusses, Persian music often distinguishes<br/>between small neutral steps around 125-140 cents (say from around<br/>14/13 to 13/12) and large ones around 150-165 cents (say from 12/11 to<br/>11/10 or so). While in Zalzal&apos;s tuning as described by al-Farabi this<br/>contrast is quite subtle, with steps of 151 cents (12/11) or 143 cents<br/>(88/81), the later interpretation of Ibn Sina with steps at 13/12 (139<br/>cents) or 128/117 (155 cents) could fit much modern Persian practice<br/>rather well. In 53-EDO, 6 and 7 commas (136 and 158 cents) can<br/>represent these smaller and larger neutral seconds. Of course, as Ozan<br/>often points out, there are infinitely fine shadings. Note that the<br/>main focus of these traditions is on melody, although the polyphonic<br/>use of various neutral intervals is certainly possible.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=93620 href="#93620">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2010 3:05:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Margo.

See &quot;Musical<br/>&gt; &gt; Mathematics,&quot; p. 677.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and on this list I have referred to this tetrachord and the<br/>&gt; octave species based on two such conjunct tetrachords plus an<br/>&gt; upper 9/8 tone as Mustaqim, which I understand to be Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; own name. More generally, I use &quot;Mustaqim&quot; to refer to a genre<br/>&gt; with a tone, smaller neutral second, and larger neutral second,<br/>&gt; in contrast to Rast, which has tone, larger neutral second, and<br/>&gt; smaller neutral second.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is curious that Ibn Sina uses the Arabic name Mustaqim for his<br/>&gt; arrangement, still I would say influential at least indirectly in<br/>&gt; Persian music; while Arab and Turkish musicians use the Persian<br/>&gt; term Rast for the converse arrangement with the larger neutral<br/>&gt; second coming before the smaller after the initial step of a<br/>&gt; tone. Either Mustaqim or Rast, as I understand, can mean the<br/>&gt; &quot;right, correct, or usual&quot; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 53-comma model, Rast is often expressed as 9 7 6; one<br/>&gt; modern Arab theorist speaks of &quot;Rast Jadid&quot; or &quot;New Rast&quot;<br/>&gt; as 9 6 7 or (in 53-EDO) 204-136-158 cents, which is not far from<br/>&gt; Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim at 204-139-155 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; While in Zalzal&apos;s tuning as described by al-Farabi this<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; contrast is quite subtle, with steps of 151 cents (12/11) or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 143 cents (88/81), the later interpretation of Ibn Sina with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; steps at 13/12 (139 cents) or 128/117 (155 cents) could fit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; much modern Persian practice rather well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Farhat approximates the &quot;small neutral second&quot; (n) at 135<br/>&gt; &gt; cents; and he approximates the &quot;large neutral step&quot; (N) at 160<br/>&gt; &gt; cents. Farhat does not give rational interval ratios. See<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Musical Mathematics,&quot; p. 686.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those are indeed his suggested average values, Hormoz Farhat,<br/>&gt; _The Dastgah Concept in Persian Music_ (Cambridge University<br/>&gt; Press, 1st paperback ed. 2004), p. 16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He also describes the ranges in terms that call for correction of<br/>&gt; my not-so-accurate paraphrase that you quote below. I should also<br/>&gt; thank you for your important point that indeed Farhat does not<br/>&gt; use JI ratios in explaining his suggested tunings, interval<br/>&gt; categories, and ranges in cents; these ratios belonged to my<br/>&gt; commentary, not his text!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After noting that neutral steps larger than a semitone but<br/>&gt; smaller than a tone are &quot;very flexible,&quot; he adds:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        &quot;Two separate neutral intervals can, however, be<br/>&gt;         identified. A smaller neutral tone can fluctuate<br/>&gt;         between 125 and 145 cents, the mean for which can<br/>&gt;         be taken as 135 cents. A larger neutral tone<br/>&gt;         fluctuates between 150 and 170 cents, the mean<br/>&gt;         being 160 cents.&quot; (Ibid. p. 16)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; As Hormoz Farhat discusses, Persian music often<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; distinguishes between small neutral steps around<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 125-140 cents (say from around 14/13 to 13/12)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and large ones around 150-165 cents (say from<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 12/11 to 11/10 or so).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, thank you for your welcome query giving my the opportunity<br/>&gt; to correct these ranges to 125-145 and 150-170 cents in line with<br/>&gt; the quote above, and to emphasize that the JI ratios mentioned<br/>&gt; above are mine, not Farhat&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Finally, to understand why Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning &quot;could fit much<br/>&gt; &gt; modern Persian practice rather well&quot; refer to &quot;Musical<br/>&gt; &gt; Mathematics,&quot; pp. 688-689, and pp. 692-696.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I look forward to reading your conclusions. In the meantime, I<br/>&gt; certainly agree with your statement in an article on this list<br/>&gt; (#66928 from 13 June 2006) that &quot;the works of Ibn Sina have<br/>&gt; everything to do with Persian music.&quot; And I happily agree with<br/>&gt; your comment in that post on the special importance of &quot;the<br/>&gt; strategic implementation of prime number 13.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My own tentative observation would be that the tetrachord<br/>&gt; structure of Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim, 9:8-13:12-128:117, or more<br/>&gt; generically in a 53-comma notation something like 9 6 7 (not a<br/>&gt; precise specification, but a guide to the placement of smaller<br/>&gt; and larger neutral seconds which could vary in size, as Farhat<br/>&gt; notes) can explain the structure of some of the dastgah-ha. (And<br/>&gt; I should add that Farhat himself doesn&apos;t apply the 53-comma<br/>&gt; system, but makes similar distinctions between smaller and larger<br/>&gt; neutral intervals which the 53-comma system expresses in a<br/>&gt; Turkish or Syrian context).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, many of the notes of some main gushe-ha of Shur<br/>&gt; Dastgah can be derived by combining conjunct and disjunct forms<br/>&gt; of Mustaqim and starting on the second step of the main<br/>&gt; tetrachord above the final; and likewise with Segah Dastgah if we<br/>&gt; start on the third step (as Segah, the &quot;third&quot; step, implies).<br/>&gt; However, this is only my own impression, and I haven&apos;t so far<br/>&gt; encountered any similar analysis from an Iranian source. I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; develop this possible line of analysis in another post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, Ibn Sina&apos;s diatonic with tetrachords sometimes given in the<br/>&gt; secondary sources I&apos;ve had access to as either 12:13:14:16 or<br/>&gt; 28:26:24:21 (I&apos;m not sure which ordering of the 13:12 and 14:13<br/>&gt; steps is his original version, and which a permutation), could<br/>&gt; fit some septimal or near-septimal flavors of modern Shur which<br/>&gt; Farhat doesn&apos;t address, but are described, for example, by<br/>&gt; Dariouche Safvate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And in the 13th century, Safi al-Din&apos;s Buzurg, given with some<br/>&gt; variations also by Qutb al-Din around 1300, for example<br/>&gt; 14:13-8:7-13:12 (another permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s septimal<br/>&gt; tetrachord above), seems similar to a flavor of Avaz-e Bayat-e<br/>&gt; Esfahan that Farhat specifies if we apply his notation (p. 76)<br/>&gt; using his suggested tar tuning (p. 17) in _The Dastgah Concept in<br/>&gt; Persian Music_. Following that notation and tuning, we get for<br/>&gt; the tetrachord leading up to the final of Esfahan:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                D    Ep      F&gt;   G<br/>&gt;                0   135     360  495<br/>&gt;                 135    225   135<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, while Farhat discusses and catalogues some<br/>&gt; categories and sizes of melodic steps, he doesn&apos;t mention the<br/>&gt; central step at around 225 cents, although he does discuss the<br/>&gt; &quot;plus-tone&quot; at around 270 cents typical of Chahargah Dastgah, for<br/>&gt; example (the modern Persian counterpart of Arab or Turkish<br/>&gt; Hijaz). A medieval Buzurg such as 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3 or<br/>&gt; 0-128-359-496 cents or 128-231-139 cents seems not too far from<br/>&gt; this, although I&apos;d emphasize that both this possible connection<br/>&gt; and the just ratios are my editorial comment, not Farhat&apos;s!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I should also add that Farhat&apos;s own interval category<br/>&gt; notation for this tetrachord below the final of Bayat-e Esfahan<br/>&gt; shows &quot;n M N,&quot; which would imply something like 135-205-160<br/>&gt; cents, with a small neutral second, tone, and large neutral<br/>&gt; second. This is available with his tar tuning if we move things<br/>&gt; up a fourth:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                G    Ap    Bp     C<br/>&gt;                0   135    340   500<br/>&gt;                 135    205   160<br/>&gt;                  n      M     N<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This form, sometimes known in modern theory as the &quot;Old Esfahan,&quot;<br/>&gt; might be derived from a permutation of a Mustaqim tetrachord,<br/>&gt; here 205-135-160 or 0-205-340-500 cents, not too far from Ibn<br/>&gt; Sina&apos;s 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3 or 0-204-342-498 cents (204-139-155<br/>&gt; cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It took me two years to research, translate, compile,<br/>&gt; &gt; illustrate, and write the materials in Musical Mathematics,<br/>&gt; &gt; Chapter 11, Part IV, called &quot;Arabian, Persian, and Turkish<br/>&gt; &gt; Music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This does not surprise me, given the vastness of the field over<br/>&gt; the last millennium and more!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best, with warmest congratulations on your book and many thanks<br/>&gt; for the helpful queries and corrections,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=93639 href="#93639">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2010 12:39:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Thanks for your reply.

What<br/>I&apos;m looking at are simply some of his genera -- _ajnas_ in Arabic<br/>(the plural of _jins_ or genus), or, as suggested by Tala&grave;i,<br/>_dang_-s in Farsi (I&apos;m tempted to say dang-ha, but would want to<br/>be sure that that plural is correct; his text has the Englished<br/>form of the plural, &quot;dang-s&quot;).</p><p>Similarly, if I say, &quot;Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s Medium Sundered<br/>tetrachord makes a wonderful Turkish Rast!&quot; (9:8-11:10-320:297),<br/>that observation doesn&apos;t depend on (at least for me) whether he<br/>ever used it for the &grave;oud or some other suggested instrumental<br/>tuning.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m looking at this from the perspective of playing a<br/>digital archicembalo or arciorgano of sorts with 24 notes per<br/>octave using a synthesizer tuning table, something radically<br/>different than building and playing actual acoustical instruments<br/>modelled on those medieval Near Eastern practice. Your project is<br/>in many ways more demanding, and likely more rewarding, than my<br/>curious high-tech neomedieval excursion.</p><p>From your message #66928, I know part of your answer to one<br/>question you raise: &quot;All the intervals described by Hormoz Farhat<br/>on the modern tar and setar can be played on Ibn Sina&apos;s ud. This<br/>also applies to many modern dastgah.&quot;</p><p>And what I&apos;d expect over a millennium of time is not a perfect<br/>match, but simply some correspondences in genera that suggest<br/>similar patterns: Near Eastern music is a living and changing<br/>art, with the modern dastgah system arising from the earlier<br/>maqam system maybe sometime around the 17th or 18th century.</p><p>However, my analysis is often cruder, even touristic in a sense:<br/>&quot;Wow, what a beautiful tetrachord, and how interesting that it<br/>seems quite close to that performance measured by Can Akkoc or<br/>Amine Beyhom!&quot;</p><p>&gt;  Even so, a further question arises: given the interval<br/>&gt;  patterns of Farhat&apos;s 12 modern Persian dastgaha, do the<br/>&gt;  distributions of these intervals on Ibn Sina&apos;s &grave;ud facilitate<br/>&gt;  playing these dastgaha as notated? For example, on Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt;  &grave;ud, can one play these dastgaha directly, or are<br/>&gt;  transpositions necessary?</p><p>An interesting question! How many notes per octave did his &grave;oud<br/>tuning have? For modern dastgah music, I tend to think of about<br/>17 as standard; on my 24-note arrangement using two 12-note<br/>keyboards, I still get into curious transpositions at times, much<br/>to the amusement, I suspect, of someone like Ozan Yarman who<br/>developed his 79-tone qanun to minimize such complications.</p><p>&gt;  Since Farhat only gives intervals in cents, and since Ibn Sina<br/>&gt;  only gives intervals as rational ratios, I wonder how were you<br/>&gt;  able to conclude that Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning &quot;could fit much modern<br/>&gt;  Persian practice rather well&quot;? How were you able to reason<br/>&gt;  &quot;reasoned practice&quot;?</p><p>Honestly, translating from ratios to cents is something that I<br/>take for granted every day, as well as tempered &quot;near-just&quot;<br/>intervals. My &quot;reasoned&quot; approach is that there are many degrees<br/>of almost exact equivalence, approximate equivalence, &quot;in the<br/>same general ballpark,&quot; and &quot;quite distinct from.&quot;</p><p>Near one end of this spectrum, I&apos;d say that a tempered<br/>126.6-138.3-230.9 cents in 1024-EDO is a &quot;near-just&quot; rendition of<br/>Ibn Sina&apos;s 14:13-13:12-8:7 (128.30-138.57-231.17 cents).</p><p>How about 132.25-132.25-230.90? It&apos;s still rather closely related,<br/>I would say, but different not only in that 14:13 and 13:12 are<br/>each a lot less accurate, but more fundamentally in that they&apos;re<br/>both represented by the same tempered interval. That is to me a<br/>rather more significant compromise of Ibn Sina&apos;s superparticular<br/>concept.</p><p>And what about Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate and their<br/>reported lower Shur tetrachord at 136-140-224 cents? We have the<br/>general idea of &quot;two smallish neutral seconds plus a large tone<br/>approaching 8:7,&quot; but not quite Ibn Sina&apos;s septimal tuning.</p><p>Let&apos;s compare Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim tetrachord we&apos;ve both been<br/>discussing at 9:8-13:12-128:117 or 204-139-155 cents (actually<br/>128:117 is slightly closer to 156 cents, but I&apos;m rounding down in<br/>order to have the fourth and upper minor third come out at 204<br/>and 294 cents), with Farhat&apos;s lower tetrachord for Avaz-e Afshari<br/>at 205-135-160 cents -- or, as a Turkish or Syrian theorist might<br/>say, 9-6-7 commas. Here I&apos;d say that we&apos;re dealing with<br/>variations in tuning the same basic &quot;type&quot; of tetrachord --<br/>although in fact there&apos;s an important difference that the ratios,<br/>cents, or commas don&apos;t reveal!</p><p>That difference is that a modern Afshari, at least as described<br/>by Farhat and exemplified by some of the pieces I&apos;ve seen, tends<br/>to place much less emphasis on the second note of the tetrachord<br/>or the interval of a usual ~9:8 tone leading up to it than I<br/>might guess could occur in Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim. In this context<br/>in the modern dastgah system, the descending small neutral third<br/>Ep-C (following Farhat&apos;s examples with Shur on D) may act more<br/>like a simple rather than composite melodic interval, so that we<br/>could include it as a category in its own right, although Farhat<br/>(p. 26) discusses it as a composite. Some of the gushe-ha of<br/>Dastgah-e Mahur do shift from a major to a small neutral third<br/>above C with all steps of the tetrachord C-D-Ep-F (~0-205-340-500<br/>cents) in use and lots of conjunct motion, so that might be a<br/>closer parallel to a possible melodic procedure for the medieval<br/>Mustaqim.</p><p>So I may be sort of weird in focusing on superparticular or other<br/>rational ratios and at the same time seeing things as a continuum<br/>amenable to measurement in cents, commas, or what have you.

Apparently, Farhat also took a great<br/>interest in the premise (i.e., in the logic) of how<br/>musicians tune their instruments, and how such<br/>tunings reflect the music (i.e., the modes) they play.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cris wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  In Farhat&apos;s book &quot;The Dastgah Concept of Persian<br/>&gt; &gt;  Music,&quot; pp. 15-16 and 25-26, he describes in cents not<br/>&gt; &gt;  only two intervals, but a grand total of nine<br/>&gt; &gt;  constituent intervals of modern Persian music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, Cris, and thank you for raising some important and often<br/>&gt; not so clearly articulated points.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, if we&apos;re talking here about the basic categories of<br/>&gt; melodic steps, there are a lot more than two, and from my reading<br/>&gt; of other sources such as Dariouche Safvate, Jean During, and<br/>&gt; Dariush Tala&grave;i, I&apos;d say that Farhat&apos;s catalogue of five basic<br/>&gt; categories as I read it is illustrative but by no means<br/>&gt; exhaustive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can get into all that, whether we end up with five categories<br/>&gt; or nine or some other number, but I think some of the questions<br/>&gt; you are raising may be much simpler than this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  If your claim hold true that Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning &quot;could fit much<br/>&gt; &gt;  modern Persian practice rather well&quot; then the question arises:<br/>&gt; &gt;  does Ibn Sina&apos;s &grave;ud tuning include accurate representations of<br/>&gt; &gt;  all nine constituent intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly that&apos;s not what I meant to say, and in fact I was<br/>&gt; thinking simply in terms of how well some of his genera seem to<br/>&gt; fit current practice, whether or not he combined the relevant<br/>&gt; ones or even used them at all in any instrumental tuning. What<br/>&gt; I&apos;m looking at are simply some of his genera -- _ajnas_ in Arabic<br/>&gt; (the plural of _jins_ or genus), or, as suggested by Tala&grave;i,<br/>&gt; _dang_-s in Farsi (I&apos;m tempted to say dang-ha, but would want to<br/>&gt; be sure that that plural is correct; his text has the Englished<br/>&gt; form of the plural, &quot;dang-s&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, if I say, &quot;Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s Medium Sundered<br/>&gt; tetrachord makes a wonderful Turkish Rast!&quot; (9:8-11:10-320:297),<br/>&gt; that observation doesn&apos;t depend on (at least for me) whether he<br/>&gt; ever used it for the &grave;oud or some other suggested instrumental<br/>&gt; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, I&apos;m looking at this from the perspective of playing a<br/>&gt; digital archicembalo or arciorgano of sorts with 24 notes per<br/>&gt; octave using a synthesizer tuning table, something radically<br/>&gt; different than building and playing actual acoustical instruments<br/>&gt; modelled on those medieval Near Eastern practice. Your project is<br/>&gt; in many ways more demanding, and likely more rewarding, than my<br/>&gt; curious high-tech neomedieval excursion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From your message #66928, I know part of your answer to one<br/>&gt; question you raise: &quot;All the intervals described by Hormoz Farhat<br/>&gt; on the modern tar and setar can be played on Ibn Sina&apos;s ud. This<br/>&gt; also applies to many modern dastgah.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what I&apos;d expect over a millennium of time is not a perfect<br/>&gt; match, but simply some correspondences in genera that suggest<br/>&gt; similar patterns: Near Eastern music is a living and changing<br/>&gt; art, with the modern dastgah system arising from the earlier<br/>&gt; maqam system maybe sometime around the 17th or 18th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, my analysis is often cruder, even touristic in a sense:<br/>&gt; &quot;Wow, what a beautiful tetrachord, and how interesting that it<br/>&gt; seems quite close to that performance measured by Can Akkoc or<br/>&gt; Amine Beyhom!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Even so, a further question arises: given the interval<br/>&gt; &gt;  patterns of Farhat&apos;s 12 modern Persian dastgaha, do the<br/>&gt; &gt;  distributions of these intervals on Ibn Sina&apos;s &grave;ud facilitate<br/>&gt; &gt;  playing these dastgaha as notated? For example, on Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;  &grave;ud, can one play these dastgaha directly, or are<br/>&gt; &gt;  transpositions necessary?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting question! How many notes per octave did his &grave;oud<br/>&gt; tuning have? For modern dastgah music, I tend to think of about<br/>&gt; 17 as standard; on my 24-note arrangement using two 12-note<br/>&gt; keyboards, I still get into curious transpositions at times, much<br/>&gt; to the amusement, I suspect, of someone like Ozan Yarman who<br/>&gt; developed his 79-tone qanun to minimize such complications.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Since Farhat only gives intervals in cents, and since Ibn Sina<br/>&gt; &gt;  only gives intervals as rational ratios, I wonder how were you<br/>&gt; &gt;  able to conclude that Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning &quot;could fit much modern<br/>&gt; &gt;  Persian practice rather well&quot;? How were you able to reason<br/>&gt; &gt;  &quot;reasoned practice&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Honestly, translating from ratios to cents is something that I<br/>&gt; take for granted every day, as well as tempered &quot;near-just&quot;<br/>&gt; intervals. My &quot;reasoned&quot; approach is that there are many degrees<br/>&gt; of almost exact equivalence, approximate equivalence, &quot;in the<br/>&gt; same general ballpark,&quot; and &quot;quite distinct from.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Near one end of this spectrum, I&apos;d say that a tempered<br/>&gt; 126.6-138.3-230.9 cents in 1024-EDO is a &quot;near-just&quot; rendition of<br/>&gt; Ibn Sina&apos;s 14:13-13:12-8:7 (128.30-138.57-231.17 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about 132.25-132.25-230.90? It&apos;s still rather closely related,<br/>&gt; I would say, but different not only in that 14:13 and 13:12 are<br/>&gt; each a lot less accurate, but more fundamentally in that they&apos;re<br/>&gt; both represented by the same tempered interval. That is to me a<br/>&gt; rather more significant compromise of Ibn Sina&apos;s superparticular<br/>&gt; concept.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what about Nelly Caron and Dariouche Safvate and their<br/>&gt; reported lower Shur tetrachord at 136-140-224 cents? We have the<br/>&gt; general idea of &quot;two smallish neutral seconds plus a large tone<br/>&gt; approaching 8:7,&quot; but not quite Ibn Sina&apos;s septimal tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s compare Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim tetrachord we&apos;ve both been<br/>&gt; discussing at 9:8-13:12-128:117 or 204-139-155 cents (actually<br/>&gt; 128:117 is slightly closer to 156 cents, but I&apos;m rounding down in<br/>&gt; order to have the fourth and upper minor third come out at 204<br/>&gt; and 294 cents), with Farhat&apos;s lower tetrachord for Avaz-e Afshari<br/>&gt; at 205-135-160 cents -- or, as a Turkish or Syrian theorist might<br/>&gt; say, 9-6-7 commas. Here I&apos;d say that we&apos;re dealing with<br/>&gt; variations in tuning the same basic &quot;type&quot; of tetrachord --<br/>&gt; although in fact there&apos;s an important difference that the ratios,<br/>&gt; cents, or commas don&apos;t reveal!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That difference is that a modern Afshari, at least as described<br/>&gt; by Farhat and exemplified by some of the pieces I&apos;ve seen, tends<br/>&gt; to place much less emphasis on the second note of the tetrachord<br/>&gt; or the interval of a usual ~9:8 tone leading up to it than I<br/>&gt; might guess could occur in Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim. In this context<br/>&gt; in the modern dastgah system, the descending small neutral third<br/>&gt; Ep-C (following Farhat&apos;s examples with Shur on D) may act more<br/>&gt; like a simple rather than composite melodic interval, so that we<br/>&gt; could include it as a category in its own right, although Farhat<br/>&gt; (p. 26) discusses it as a composite. Some of the gushe-ha of<br/>&gt; Dastgah-e Mahur do shift from a major to a small neutral third<br/>&gt; above C with all steps of the tetrachord C-D-Ep-F (~0-205-340-500<br/>&gt; cents) in use and lots of conjunct motion, so that might be a<br/>&gt; closer parallel to a possible melodic procedure for the medieval<br/>&gt; Mustaqim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I may be sort of weird in focusing on superparticular or other<br/>&gt; rational ratios and at the same time seeing things as a continuum<br/>&gt; amenable to measurement in cents, commas, or what have you.

These intervals are not perceptibly more<br/>&gt; consonant than their (irrational) neighbors, like the intervals 5/4,<br/>&gt; 7/6, 7/5 et al are.  Therefore maqam musicians would not intone them<br/>&gt; unless they deliberately tried to do so.  For instance, one would<br/>&gt; need bearing plans to tune them on, e.g. qawanin in advance.  Is<br/>&gt; there evidence such bearing plans are used?  It seems that if they<br/>&gt; were, the encroachment of 12-ET music would be not so much a<br/>&gt; threat...</p><p>Hi, Carl.</p><p>First, please let me acknowledge some things you&apos;ve explained by<br/>confirming my understanding that you&apos;re speaking not as a musician<br/>specifically focusing on maqam music, but as a performer and student<br/>of intonation bringing your own experience to bear on statements that<br/>you feel merit a query. And that&apos;s a fair invitation to dialogue, in<br/>which people may learn from each other.</p><p>In part, this may be a matter of general outlook and philosophy, which<br/>I&apos;ll briefly consider before getting to the practical issues you<br/>raise, with the very major caution, in the spirit of your own<br/>disclaimers, that someone who actually tunes and plays Near Eastern<br/>instruments might have a lot more to contribute than I do on questions<br/>of how these instruments are tuned!</p><p>Philosophically, I do tend to envision interval space as a continuum<br/>with rational ratios, small and large, as delightful landmarks. Much<br/>of the medieval Islamic theory involves quite complex ratios, and<br/>there&apos;s always the argument that in practice things are a lot less<br/>precise. Often when I speak of &quot;16/13&quot; or &quot;21/17&quot; or &quot;26/21&quot; I&apos;m<br/>thinking of a general region, or maybe even of overlapping regions,<br/>and I suspect that Ozan (although he must speak for himself!) might be<br/>taking a somewhat similar outlook when he lists the steps of his<br/>79-tone qanun, for example, and suggests some possible just<br/>interpretations.</p><p>Let me confirm that what I take to be an important point you raise,<br/>that certain JI distinctions are much smaller than the variations we<br/>expect in performance, certainly is valid! For example, in a<br/>synthesizer tuning, I happen to have large neutral thirds at around<br/>369.1 cents and 370.3 cents. Rather humorously, I might say that this<br/>temperament &quot;distinguishes 99/80 from 26/21&quot; -- both of which are<br/>rations coming up in medieval Near Eastern tunings --but it&apos;s<br/>obviously an academic point if we&apos;re talking about likely ensemble<br/>performances.</p><p>However, there are distinctions that I hear as significant, and<br/>suspect that a seasoned Near Eastern musician growing up with maqam or<br/>dastgah music may hear yet better and more significantly. Thus the<br/>region around 357-359 cents feels to me a bit different than 369-370<br/>cents, with the latter having a &quot;submajor&quot; quality. And distinctions<br/>of around a comma are in my view certainly significant. Others whom I<br/>respect, from the Near East and elsewhere, find such distinctions<br/>significant also.</p><p>Amine Beyhom, in a portion of his thesis available on the Web,<br/>discusses a survey to see how listeners would place the second note of<br/>Maqam Bayyati. He found that people liking a &quot;learned&quot; or &quot;academic&quot;<br/>style placed it at around 155 cents above the final or resting note of<br/>the maqam. People attuned to a &quot;popular&quot; interpretation, however,<br/>placed it at around 130 cents. That&apos;s a difference of a full comma. We might or might not wish to associate the first, higher, placement<br/>with something like &quot;128/117&quot; and the second with &quot;14/13&quot; or the like;<br/>I tend to do that because I consider the contemplation of such ratios<br/>ennobling in itself, but Beyhom himself simply gives the values in<br/>cents, and those are sufficient to suggest that, allowing for<br/>variations of +-5 cents or the like, comma differences are real and<br/>significant.</p><p>In Egypt, Scott Marcus found that traditional musicians understood,<br/>similarly, that the note sikah (an Arabic form of Persian or Turkish<br/>segah) must be tuned lower for Maqam Bayyati than for Maqam Rast, at<br/>about 135-145 cents above the step dukah. Note that is a bit higher<br/>than the 130 cents favored in the &quot;popular&quot; Lebanese tuning of<br/>Bayyati.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I explain a bit about the &quot;sikah is lower in Bayyati&quot;<br/>concept. Let&apos;s suppose we&apos;re tuning an Egyptian Rast. Unfortunately,<br/>Marcus, doesn&apos;t give values in cents (or ratios, for that matter).<br/>However, he does comment that the tuning of fretted instruments using<br/>many pure fifths or fourths does tend to favor a Pythagorean or<br/>similar intonation of lots of regular intervals such as minor thirds.<br/>If major second are around 204 cents, and minor thirds around 294<br/>cents, then the following tuning of Rast would be interestingly close<br/>to that of al-Farabi:</p><p>     0       204      354       498<br/>    rast    dukah    sikah   jaharkah<br/>        204      150      144</p><p>Here I picked an even 150 cents for the sake of simplicity; 12/11, of<br/>course, would be 150.637 cents, and I warmly agree with you that an<br/>&quot;11-limit&quot; concept is really likely irrelevant here in a monophonic or<br/>heterophonic context -- and also, I&apos;d add, in the kind of polyphonic<br/>texture I do enjoy composing or improvising which might have lots of<br/>&quot;ratios of 2-3-7-11-13,&quot; many of them quite complex, but very rarely<br/>something like 4-6-7-9-11, which even then wouldn&apos;t fit the &quot;11-limit&quot;<br/>concept of something like 4-5-6-7-9-11. That&apos;s an aside, just to<br/>acknowledge that either maqam music or my typical polyphonic style in<br/>this kind of context is part of a &quot;non-Partchian&quot; universe so that the<br/>&quot;limit&quot; concept may more confuse than illuminate.</p><p>Anyway, the significant thing here is that traditional Egyptian<br/>musicians feel that in tuning Bayyati, sikah needs to be somewhat<br/>lower, at around 135-145 cents above dukah. Here I&apos;ll show the lower<br/>tetrachord of Bayyati, along with the step rast below it:</p><p>dukah:        0       140      294      498 rast:     0       204     344      498      702<br/>         rast    dukah   sikah   jaharkah   nawa<br/>             204      140     154        204</p><p>Here I&apos;m taking 140 cents as a &quot;middle of the road&quot; value for Marcus&apos;s<br/>suggestion of 135-145 cents, and I&apos;ll restrain myself from the fun of<br/>suggesting kindred just ratios. The basic perspective shared by many<br/>traditional musicians can be stated as holding either that sikah needs<br/>to be lower (here about 10 cents) in Bayyati than in Rast, with the<br/>other &quot;Pythagorean&quot; steps remaining more stable (basically, in terms<br/>of rast, 1/1-9/8-4/3-3/2, or rast-dukah-jaharkah-nawa); or that, in<br/>Bayyati, the first ascending neutral second should be smaller than the<br/>second.</p><p>And there&apos;s another point noted by Marcus: many traditional performers<br/>have an additional understanding that while the neutral second step of<br/>Bayyati should be smallish, maybe 135-145 cents, a step occurred at a<br/>neutral third below the final, and sometimes a neutral sixth above,<br/>should be considerably _higher_. Marcus doesn&apos;t give values in cents,<br/>but if the neutral second is at 140 cents and the neutral sixth at<br/>around 855-860 cents -- or the neutral third below at about 340-345<br/>cents from the final -- then we&apos;d have a narrow fourth from the third<br/>below to the neutral second above at around 480-485 cents or so, and<br/>likewise a wide fifth from the neutral second to the neutral sixth<br/>above at around 715-720 cents. Thus there&apos;s an element of deliberate<br/>asymmetry involved.</p><p>These are, of course, precisely the kind of nuances which can be lost<br/>to incursions of 12-EDO/24-EDO. According to Ali Jihad Racy in his<br/>book _Making Music in the Arab World: The Culture and Artistry of<br/>Tarab_, the problem is that current qanuns often lack sufficient<br/>levers to make fine microtonal distinctions; and also that, rather<br/>than being set by an informed musician to fit the nature of a given<br/>maqam, they are often tuned to match keyboard instruments in 24-EDO.</p><p>&gt;&gt; More specifically, 350 cents would evidently be too low for a<br/>&gt;&gt; stylish Turkish Rast, where a &quot;low&quot; but acceptable third might be<br/>&gt;&gt; around 16/13; a common historical choice</p><p>&gt; 16/13 is only 9 cents different from 350 cents, in the middle of<br/>&gt; nowhere (no nearby consonance minima).  Intoned on instruments<br/>&gt; routinely employing vibrato and other effects ranging from 20 cents<br/>&gt; to several semitones.  Forgive me if I am dubious.  Even the best<br/>&gt; barbershop quartets, with the pull of strong consonances to guide<br/>&gt; them, and a vibratoless style, seldom do better than 5 cents<br/>&gt; accuracy, as I know from carrying out painstaking spectral analysis<br/>&gt; of barbershop recordings, as well as having been a barbershop singer<br/>&gt; myself.</p><p>Here I suspect that we may be talking in good part abuut the<br/>perception of fine differences in interval sizes, but not necessarily<br/>miniscule ones, e.g. 135 cents vs. 155 cents or the like.</p><p>I must admit that &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; isn&apos;t exactly my concept of<br/>the region around 16/13: I visualize al-Farabi&apos;s 27/22 (355 cents),<br/>Jacques Dudon&apos;s 59/48 (357 cents), 16/13 itself, 69/56 (361 cents),<br/>121/98 (365 cents), 21/17 (366 cents), 99/80 (369 cents), and 26/21<br/>(370 cents). Then again, for the past decade, I&apos;ve been tending to<br/>hang out with my synthesizer on &quot;plateaus&quot; like this, often descending<br/>to the valleys of 1/1, 4/3, 3/2, and 2/1, and also having a weakness<br/>for 7/6 and 7/4. Of course, when I play in a 16th-century style<br/>in meantone, that is often what could be called a &quot;5-limit&quot; context --<br/>but otherwise, limits may be pretty much inapplicable.</p><p>I do consider it worthwhile to say that however debatable my<br/>invocation of ratios may be, I&apos;ve resolved to avoid the &quot;limit&quot;<br/>concept where it may simply not apply, which in this kind of Near<br/>Eastern concept could be just about everywhere. And I&apos;m not familiar<br/>with any discussion of &quot;limit&quot; by Safi al-Din al-Urmawi, for example,<br/>unless we want to speak of a &quot;3-limit&quot; concept of the main concords<br/>(much like the Greek or medieval European concept of _symphoniae_).<br/>And, in my neomedieval polyphony (drawing on European or Near Eastern<br/>materials), that concept does generally have operational meaning, with<br/>conclusive cadences resolving to &quot;3-limit&quot; sonorities (just or<br/>tempered).</p><p>This is purely a guess, but I might hypothesize that performers in a<br/>monophonic or heterophonic context might focus keenly on small<br/>distinctions in melodic interval sizes, say on the order of a comma,<br/>or possibly of a yarman (2/159 octave or so, about 15 cents). Of<br/>course, that fact that I do it on a synthesizer keyboard with some<br/>comma distinctions available doesn&apos;t tell us if or how Near Eastern<br/>performances are doing it; but some of them tell us that such<br/>distinctions are practice, worthwhile, and important.</p><p>In a polyphonic context, I&apos;ve found that 13/8 can sound simple and<br/>notably resonant in comparison to 21/13, which is more complex and<br/>active, although in my stylistic context both seek resolution in much<br/>the same general types of progressions (e.g. expansion to an octave);<br/>or, more specifically, tempered forms at around 829.7 or 830.9 cents<br/>in comparison to 841.4 or 842.6 cents.</p><p>[from another message, which I&apos;m responding to in this single reply,<br/>since the discussion seems closely related]</p><p>&gt;&gt; [snip] while the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;theoryVSpractice&quot; study has shown that Turkish musicians<br/>&gt;&gt; may lean toward 9 7 6 commas [snip]</p><p>&gt; Which study are you referring to?</p><p>That&apos;s a fair question:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&quot;Weighing diverse theoretical models...&quot; -- evidentally the same one<br/>you&apos;ve been looking at also. One lesson is that if I had cited the<br/>title as well as a rather cryptic fragment of the file name, I might<br/>have been clearer!</p><p>&gt;&gt; When people are measured with 21st-century technology playing on<br/>&gt;&gt; the Turkish ney, for example, genera or ajnas much like those<br/>&gt;&gt; described by Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din seven centuries ago, or<br/>&gt;&gt; Ibn Sina a millennium ago, and distinct from 24-EDO, I tend to take<br/>&gt;&gt; these theorists quite seriously.</p><p>&gt; Again, which study(ies) are you referring to?</p><p>That&apos;s another very fair question. One example is the one from Ozan&apos;s<br/>thesis on which you quote me below. The other is a study by Amine<br/>Beyhom which should be available on the Web, &quot;Des criteres<br/>d&apos;authenticite dans les musiques metisses et de leur validation:<br/>exemple de la musique arabe&quot;:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf">http://www.beyhom.com/download/articles/Beyhom_2007_%20Des_criteres_d_authenticite_filigrane_n5.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Beyhom records an improvisation by the Turkish performer Kudsi Erguner<br/>on the ney in Maqam Hijaz with the sequence 0-131-368-501 cents, or<br/>131-237-133 cents. This seems to me quite similar to a medieval Buzurg<br/>genre, for example 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3 or 1/1-13/12-26/21-4/3 -- or,<br/>more precisely, the lower fourth of Buzurg, which is a 3:2 division.<br/>Even Beyhom&apos;s brief excerpt is a lot more complicated than this, but a<br/>&quot;Buzurg&quot; type of structure, at least at times, is an interesting<br/>reading.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Compare, for example, the measured intervals in Niyazi&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; Sayin&apos;s Ushshak Ney Taksim (Ozan&apos;s thesis, p. 29) with either<br/>&gt;&gt; the original form or a permutation of a tuning by Ibn Sina in<br/>&gt;&gt; the early 11th century at 28:26:24:21 or 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;       Measured:    123.47       137.13      227.87<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;       Ibn Sina:     14:13        13:12        8:7<br/>&gt;&gt;                    128.30       138.57      231.17</p><p>&gt; On pg. 25 it is stated,<br/>&gt; &quot;This research confirmed suspicions that the &apos;melodic intervals&apos;<br/>&gt; most haracteristic of the genre are expressible by such epimoric<br/>&gt; ratios&quot;</p><p>&gt; Cited are the paper &quot;Non-deterministic Scales...&quot; by Can Akkoc,<br/>&gt; which most certainly does NOT conclude anything of the kind, and a<br/>&gt; paper and website in Turkish by one M.K. Karaosmanoglu (who is<br/>&gt; Ozan&apos;s coauthor on the more recent &quot;Weighing Diverse...&quot;  already<br/>&gt; mentioned).  Here&apos;s the website:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.musiki.org/mkk_vekom_2004_sunum.htm">http://www.musiki.org/mkk_vekom_2004_sunum.htm</a></p><p>&gt; I see nothing here establishing this claim either, even with<br/>&gt; the help of Google Translate.  At any rate &quot;Weighing Diverse&quot;<br/>&gt; is more recent and in English and I will come back to it in<br/>&gt; a subsequent post (time permitting).</p><p>&quot;Weighing diverse theoretical models&quot; is the document with which I&apos;m<br/>familiar so far. I&apos;ll see if I can look into this other.</p><p>&gt; On pg.28 we see that the data are in fact being fitted to the<br/>&gt; ratios used.  But why are ratios appropriate?</p><p>Well, while I&apos;d want to be careful that ratio characterizations don&apos;t<br/>overshadow the actual values in cents or fractional commas, ratios can<br/>serve as useful signposts for certain regions, e.g. 16/13 or 26/21.<br/>A caution is that, especially with aggregate data, performers might be<br/>closely approximating a variety of ratios, which may &quot;average out&quot; to<br/>a value which happens to coincide also with some ratio, but not<br/>necessarily the most influential one. This caution, of course, also<br/>applies to averaging values in cents. Thus if a neutral sixth from a<br/>given location of interest on a number of Persian tar or setar tunings<br/>averages out at around 835 cents, that might leave open the<br/>possibility that some performances like a 21/13 flavor and others a<br/>13/8 flavor; that many of them are actually seeking a size right<br/>around 835 cents (say 34/21, or maybe Phi as a point of maximum<br/>complexity), etc.</p><p>Intuitively, I&apos;d say that Ozan&apos;s example in his thesis from a<br/>performance of Maqam Ushshaq on ney, 123.5-137.1-227.9 cents, is close<br/>enough to 14:13-13:12-8:7 to be worth noting the parallel. Of course,<br/>if it happened in a context with a drone, then 260.6 cents might be<br/>close enough to the &quot;7/6 valley&quot; to be vertically notable also.<br/>However, I think of the resemblance to Ibn Sina&apos;s tuning (or a<br/>permutation thereof), as well as the variations (e.g. the narrow<br/>fourth by comparison to 4/3), as something inherently fascinating.</p><p>But I&apos;d add that aggregate data in cents or fractional 53-EDO commas,<br/>whatever the relevance or otherwise of ratios, can point up some<br/>interesting things. For example, taking things very broadly, I at<br/>least get the idea that the neutral third step (segah) in a Turkish<br/>Rast will be rather higher than a demififth at around 351 cents, maybe<br/>360-370 cents or somewhere around &quot;16 commas&quot; (I&apos;ll spare you my<br/>rational glosses, especially since I&apos;ve already invoked most of them<br/>earlier in this message!), and sometimes around 380 cents, getting<br/>into the region of 5/4, so that we have a small major rather than<br/>large neutral or submajor third.</p><p>In contrast, certain melodic themes of gusheh-ha of the Persian<br/>Dastgah-e Mahur use a tetrachord around maybe 0-205-340-495 cents.<br/>Here I think we can recognize the distinction between a neutral third<br/>at around 335-345 cents, say, and 360-370 cents in Turkish Rast -- a<br/>difference of around a comma, as expressed by the Turkish or Syrian<br/>53-comma notations of 9-6-7 or 9-7-6.</p><p>We may have a situation a bit like in natural language, where the<br/>&quot;target regions&quot; for two phonemes may overlap, but a large number of<br/>measurements show that they are focused or centered on distinct<br/>regions.</p><p>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=93661 href="#93661">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2010 4:58:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p><p>&gt; Philosophically, I do tend to envision interval space as a<br/>&gt; continuum with rational ratios, small and large, as delightful<br/>&gt; landmarks. Much of the medieval Islamic theory involves quite<br/>&gt; complex ratios, and there&apos;s always the argument that in<br/>&gt; practice things are a lot less precise. Often when I speak of<br/>&gt; &quot;16/13&quot; or &quot;21/17&quot; or &quot;26/21&quot; I&apos;m thinking of a general region,<br/>&gt; or maybe even of overlapping regions,and I suspect that Ozan<br/>&gt; (although he must speak for himself!) might be taking a somewhat<br/>&gt; similar outlook when he lists the steps of his 79-tone qanun,<br/>&gt; for example, and suggests some possible just interpretations.</p><p>I suppose it&apos;s OK to use the rationals as a ruler, and I<br/>suspect that&apos;s what the theorists of antiquity were doing, not<br/>being familiar with logarithms.*  The advantage of the latter,<br/>of course, is that they can be easily doled out in perceptually<br/>equal units, as any good ruler contains.  If you say you have<br/>two pieces of wood for sale measuring 26/21 and 31/25 relative<br/>to a 12&quot; stick, I&apos;m going to reach for my pocket calculator.<br/>Such systems are cumbersome because each denominator is<br/>effectively an independent system of units.  And I definitely<br/>object to calling intervals so measured intervals of just<br/>intonation.  The word &quot;just&quot; makes a literal and practical<br/>contribution to the term, and the term has a long history of<br/>meaning &apos;intervals distinguishable by their concordance&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Let me confirm that what I take to be an important point you<br/>&gt; raise, that certain JI distinctions are much smaller than<br/>&gt; the variations we expect in performance, certainly is valid!</p><p>I would say, certain RI (rational intonation) distinctions are.</p><p>&gt; Thus the region around 357-359 cents feels to me a bit<br/>&gt; different than 369-370 cents, with the latter having a<br/>&gt; &quot;submajor&quot; quality.</p><p>Well, sure.  Under lab conditions the melodic JND is about<br/>4 cents and the harmonic JND about 1 cent.  In musical<br/>performance, they are some function of the average stable<br/>pitch duration (down to the lab-condition levels).</p><p>So I would not doubt it if you told me that when Nihavent<br/>vs Hijaz (to pick examples out of thin air) are tuned up or<br/>performed, one consistently winds up with an interval about<br/>10 cents larger than the other.  And that is precisely where<br/>I see the subtly of maqam music -- the variety of melodic<br/>structures employed.</p><p>What I have never heard is two intervals differing by 10<br/>cents intentionally juxtaposed in a piece.  If you know of<br/>a recording of such a thing, please share it.</p><p>&gt; I consider the contemplation of such ratios<br/>&gt; ennobling in itself, but Beyhom himself simply gives the values<br/>&gt; in cents, and those are sufficient to suggest that, allowing for<br/>&gt; variations of +-5 cents or the like, comma differences are real<br/>&gt; and significant.</p><p>Yes, of this I have no doubt.</p><p>&gt; Here I picked an even 150 cents for the sake of simplicity;<br/>&gt; 12/11, of course, would be 150.637 cents, and I warmly agree<br/>&gt; with you that an &quot;11-limit&quot; concept is really likely irrelevant<br/>&gt; here in a monophonic or heterophonic context</p><p>Whew.  :)</p><p>&gt; and also, I&apos;d add, in the kind of polyphonic<br/>&gt; texture I do enjoy composing or improvising which might have<br/>&gt; lots of &quot;ratios of 2-3-7-11-13,&quot; many of them quite complex,<br/>&gt; but very rarely something like 4-6-7-9-11, which even then<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t fit the &quot;11-limit&quot; concept of something like<br/>&gt; 4-5-6-7-9-11.</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s a bit of a terminology lack here.  I don&apos;t see<br/>a problem calling the first case 13-limit or the second<br/>11-limit, but as we leave out more identities things get a<br/>bit hairy.  Simply giving the identities as you did here may<br/>be best.</p><p>&gt; The basic perspective shared by many traditional musicians<br/>&gt; can be stated as holding either that sikah needs to be lower<br/>&gt; (here about 10 cents) in Bayyati than in Rast,</p><p>There you see, I should read ahead before replying (busted!).<br/>I wouldn&apos;t have had to fabricate an example.</p><p>&gt; These are, of course, precisely the kind of nuances which can<br/>&gt; be lost to incursions of 12-EDO/24-EDO.</p><p>No doubt.  However, I also hear some stuff that for whatever<br/>reason is about as nearly 24-EDO as can be.  I still enjoy it<br/>quite a bit, because our world is so starved for variety,<br/>though I wouldn&apos;t doubt it has replaced something still more interesting if you told me so.</p><p>&gt; I must admit that &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; isn&apos;t exactly my<br/>&gt; concept of the region around 16/13: I visualize al-Farabi&apos;s<br/>&gt; 27/22 (355 cents), Jacques Dudon&apos;s 59/48 (357 cents),<br/>&gt; 16/13 itself, 69/56 (361 cents), 121/98 (365 cents),<br/>&gt; 21/17 (366 cents), 99/80 (369 cents), and 26/21 (370 cents).<br/>&gt; Then again, for the past decade, I&apos;ve been tending to hang<br/>&gt; out with my synthesizer on &quot;plateaus&quot; like this [snip] but<br/>&gt; otherwise, limits may be pretty much inapplicable.</p><p>(I hope I elided well.)  I would say the rationals are pretty<br/>much inapplicable.  That these different intervals sound<br/>differently because of their size alone (and/or their proximity<br/>to JI intervals) and could be recognized after a specific<br/>program of arduous training, I would never doubt.  (I do doubt<br/>a monochord would be sufficient for such training, however.)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; [snip] while the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;theoryVSpractice&quot; study has shown that Turkish musicians<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; may lean toward 9 7 6 commas [snip]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Which study are you referring to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a fair question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf</a></p><p>Ah, that&apos;s Weighing diverse.</p><p>&gt; The other is a study by Amine Beyhom which should be available<br/>&gt; on the Web, &quot;Des criteres d&apos;authenticite dans les musiques<br/>&gt; metisses et de leur validation: exemple de la musique arabe&quot;:</p><p>That definitely looks worth reading.

Of course practicing maqam<br/>musicians don&apos;t use such rations any more today than they<br/>did back then and we sorely need to move to cents.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>* Logarithms were known of course, but not used widely.</p></div>
