I&apos;ve been using a keyboard mapping with 16 notes per octave, centered on D, but I haven&apos;t been very happy with that. It&apos;s too hard to find octaves, and too easy to run across mistuned fifths, among other things. So the other day I decided to try a 24-note keyboard mapping similar to the one suggested on Graham Breed&apos;s page for miracle temperament (<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/miracle/keyboard.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/miracle/keyboard.html</a>). The notes of the basic 10-note lemba scale are mapped to the black keys, and the &quot;sharps&quot; and &quot;flats&quot; to the white keys.</p><p>I&apos;ll use the letters D L T U N O P I J R to represent the 10-note basic scale, with two chains of generators a half-octave apart (P-J-D-T-N, L-U-O-I-R). This already has some good tetrads, and the 8-note subset which includes these tetrads is also interesting to use melodically.</p><p>Step sizes:<br/>D..L.T..U.N..O..P.I..J.R..D<br/> L  s L  s L  L  s L  s L</p><p>Diatonic scale for comparison:<br/>D...E..F...G...A...B..C...D<br/>  L  s   L   L   L  s   L</p><p>Basic harmonic structure: (--- 3/2, / 5/4, \ 6/5)<br/>          O         D<br/>         /         /<br/>    P---T     L---I<br/>   /L\N/     /P\R/<br/>  U---R     J---N<br/> /         /<br/>D         O</p><p>Notes beyond this 10-note scale are represented with the addition of Sagittal accidentals )||( and )!!(, which for convenience I&apos;ll represent with generic &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; symbols: ^ v.</p><p>I settled on a keyboard mapping with the pitch D mapped to the central F# on a 5-octave keyboard.
