Then you simply dance around inside<br/>&gt; the lattice to create your music.  The closer your hands (or<br/>&gt; feet) come to any individual lattice-point, the louder it<br/>&gt; becomes.

Patches were fixed on several spots of the dancer&apos;s<br/>bodies, so that their mouvements could be translated exactly into a<br/>three-dimensional program. During the live-performance these mouvements are<br/>projected as holograms and mix themselves fluently with the real dancers on<br/>stage. Cunningham uses this software to create his chroreographies since a<br/>few years. It&apos;s quite easy to imagine that the same program can combine<br/>itself with your three-dimensional lattices. I think the name of the<br/>software is &apos;Biped&apos;.</p><p>I remember also that Tod Machover has a composition, featuring guitarist<br/>David Starobin, in which the sound-production is directly related to the<br/>mouvements of the two hands. The person wears special gloves with all kinds<br/>of electronic sensitive interconnexions. The hands were develloped by the<br/>STEIM Foundation in Amsterdam.</p><p>At your service,</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
