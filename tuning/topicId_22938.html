I&apos;ve always had respect for the<br/>great theorists and musicians of past and there is great beauty in the<br/>simplicity of some of these historical tetrachordal structures.</p><p>The tetrachord, for those who haven&apos;t come across the term, is the span<br/>between the tonic, say, C or 1/1 and the perfect (or tempered) fourth or<br/>4/3. Then there is a step, 9/8, to the fifth , or G, 3/2. Then comes the<br/>second tetrachord which is often  the same as the first. This completes<br/>the octave. This is a very simple explanation but suffices to show the<br/>basic structure.</p><p>As my particular interest at the moment is in writing for acoustic<br/>instruments and voices I looked at what I could do with the resources of<br/>a 22 tone equal temperament (22-tet) guitar in relation to approximating<br/>Just tetrachords. This has proved to be beneficial first as a<br/>compositional and improvisational exercise per se and secondly has<br/>whetted my appetite for building simple wood, metal or string<br/>instruments that could be tuned to the Just versions of these scales.</p><p>I&apos;d like to look at two structures. The step size of 22-tet  is 54.55<br/>cents. So the easiest way to find tetrachords that can be approximated<br/>by 22 tet is to browse through the lists given in &quot;Divisions&quot; and to<br/>pick out those with cents between steps as close as possible to 55 cents<br/>or multiples thereof.</p><p>The first that popped out was Didymos&apos; Enharmonic, aka Archytas&apos;<br/>Enharmonic, ratios 32/31, 31/30 and 5/4.  The enharmonic is generally<br/>characterised by two small steps, quartertones, and a major third (or<br/>5/4) to the tetrachord. You don&apos;t get enharmonic structures in 12 tet<br/>which has been our loss in the West for many years.  Cents between steps<br/>are as follows:</p><p>Just                              55     57     386<br/>22 tet (rounded up)      55     55     382</p><p>Pretty close, given that the fourth in 22 tet is close to the limits of<br/>acceptability. This gives us the very exotic scale steps in 22 tet of  0<br/>1 2 9 13 14 15  22. And it sounds beautiful against the open drone on E.<br/>Given that the standard tuning has a bias towards adjacent strings in<br/>fifths/fourths finding your way around the fingering of this scale is<br/>straightforward. I&apos;ll put up some patterns soon. If I might digress, the<br/>tuning of any fretted instrument in fifths/fourths lends well to<br/>figuring out tetrachord fingering. Take DAGDAD (high to low) on the<br/>guitar. Lots of Ds and As so the first four notes on the D, the 1/1,<br/>will be at exactly the same fretting positions as the four notes from A,<br/>the 3/2, to the octave D. And you have a 4/3 open G available. I&apos;m sure<br/>this has all been said before but I&apos;m very excited about it all the<br/>same, so there :-)</p><p>The second one to catch my eyes and ears was a tetrachord attributed to<br/>the great Arabic theorist Al Farabi. This is referred to as a chromatic<br/>tetrachord, which in 12 tetspeak has two semitones and a minor third of<br/>some sort. The ratios are 16/15, 15/14 and 7/6, all superparticular<br/>(numerator one higher than denominator) like the previous. For a cents<br/>between step sizes comparison:-</p><p>Just                        112         119        267<br/>22 tet                      109         109        273</p><p>Again fairly good with the maximum deviation at 10 cents, though<br/>psychoacoustically I think these deviations are less important than the<br/>perception of the tetrachords as a whole with a distinctive mood. I&apos;d be<br/>interested to hear of any research in this area. The steps in 22 tet are<br/>0  2  4  9  13  15  17  22.</p><p>Several compositional methods suggest themselves. One is a form of modal<br/>modulation, moving between a scale that has, say, the root on E to one<br/>with the root on A . Additionally there are four modes of each<br/>tetrachord to explore. I am attracted to the idea of marking sections of<br/>a piece with a change from scale one to scale two. The changeover can be<br/>very intriguing. Morphing into the  Al Farabi scale can feel initially<br/>like a move to a major tonality despite the minor third. And of course<br/>there is the option of combining the two different tetrachords into a<br/>hybrid scale. At the moment I&apos;m improvising before settling on some<br/>compositional ideas and I hope to be able to share the fruits of these<br/>noodlings with you all later.</p><p>Still to come.

Needless to<br/>say, I&apos;m viewing 22-tET here from my own angle, only one way of<br/>approaching a most versatile scale.</p><p>Also, someone like John Chalmers (or Joe Monzo) is a much better<br/>source on Greek theory than I am, so my remarks should be taken with<br/>this caution.</p><p>                       -          -          -</p><p>This kind of tetrachord, described (among others) by the Greek<br/>theorist Archytas, and later made the basis of a scale by the medieval<br/>theorist al-Farabi, features whole-tones at 9:8 and 8:7, and semitones<br/>at 28:27.</p><p>Here&apos;s the tetrachord with pure 7-based ratios, if we place the 9:8<br/>whole-tone first and the 28:27 semitone last, with the intervals above<br/>the lowest note (here G in a G-C tetrachord) and the steps between<br/>notes shown as ratios and in rounded cents:</p><p>         G              A             B       C<br/>        1:1            9:8           9:7     4:3<br/>         0             204           435     498<br/>               9:8            8:7       28:27<br/>               204            231         63</p><p>It&apos;s easy to find this type of tetrachord in 22-tET -- although with<br/>an important modification as regards the two whole-tones -- if we<br/>arrange the scale in what Paul Erlich terms a &quot;Pythagorean pattern,&quot;<br/>my standard pattern for neo-Gothic music, by the way.</p><p>To get this pattern, we simply take four 22-tET steps as a whole-tone,<br/>and one step as a semitone -- giving us step sizes of around 218 cents<br/>and 55 cents (or more precisely about 218.18 cents and 54.55 cents).</p><p>If we start from C, for example, we get a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; diatonic scale<br/>like this:</p><p>       C         D       E   F       G       A       B    C<br/>       0         4       8   9       13      17      21   22<br/>            4        4     1     4       4       4      1</p><p>In this 22-tET tuning, our G-C tetrachord looks like this, with<br/>intervals given in 22-tET steps and rounded cents:</p><p>         G              A             B      C<br/>         0              4             8      9<br/>         0             218           436    491<br/>                 4              4        1<br/>                218            218       55</p><p>Here the interval between G and B, 8 steps, is about 436.46 cents,<br/>very close to the size of the 9:7 ratio between these steps in the<br/>original Archytas/al-Farabi tetrachord. The fourth is somewhat<br/>narrower, tempered from a pure 4:3 (about 498.04 cents) to about 7.14<br/>cents narrower, or 490.90 cents.</p><p>An important difference is that in the original tetrachord, our 9:7<br/>interval G-B was formed from two unequal whole-tones of 9:8 and 8:7.<br/>In 22-tET, however, our major third of almost the same size is formed<br/>from two _equal_ whole-tones at 4 steps or 218 cents, very close to<br/>the average or &quot;mean&quot; between 9:8 (204 cents) and 8:7 (231 cents).<br/>Actually the 22-tET whole-tone is very slightly larger than this mean,<br/>so that the 9:7 major third is about 1.28 cents wider than a pure 9:7<br/>at around 435.08 cents.</p><p>Also, the 22-tET diatonic semitone, here B-C, is a bit smaller than in<br/>the Archytas/al-Farabi tetrachord: it has a size of about 54.55 cents<br/>in comparison to the 28:27 semitone at around 62.96 cents.</p><p>In this respect, 22-tET might be said further to accentuate one of the<br/>characteristics of this tetrachord in a pleasing way: the contrast<br/>between the wide whole-tones and narrow semitones.</p><p>In fact, our usual semitone in the 22-tET version of this tetrachord<br/>is literally a &quot;quartertone&quot; -- exactly 1/4 the size of the<br/>whole-tone. Yet to my ears, and evidently to others, the effect is a<br/>very nice diatonic scale, and one with interesting proportions.</p><p>Another point this tetrachord illustrates: the 22-tET interval of one<br/>step, or 55 cents, can serve either as a diatonic semitone, or as some<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; kind of interval in a scale leaning toward larger<br/>semitones (e.g. a semitone of 2 steps, or around 109.09 cents, one of<br/>the basic sizes in Paul&apos;s decatonic scales).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=23080 href="#23080">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 9:49:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/16/01 5:31 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Alison, I&apos;m excited that you&apos;re exploring 22-tET guitar, and I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; wait to hear your music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>yeah yeah me too me too</p></div><h3><a id=23137 href="#23137">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/18/2001 3:12:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, the 22-tET diatonic semitone, here B-C, is a bit smaller than<br/>in<br/>&gt; the Archytas/al-Farabi tetrachord: it has a size of about 54.55<br/>cents<br/>&gt; in comparison to the 28:27 semitone at around 62.96 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this respect, 22-tET might be said further to accentuate one of<br/>the<br/>&gt; characteristics of this tetrachord in a pleasing way: the contrast<br/>&gt; between the wide whole-tones and narrow semitones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, our usual semitone in the 22-tET version of this tetrachord<br/>&gt; is literally a &quot;quartertone&quot; -- exactly 1/4 the size of the<br/>&gt; whole-tone.
