IOW,<br/>&gt; is there such a thing as a generic SYSEX device ID?</p><p>For one thing, I think that should be #0. For another thing, for some reason, the specification doesn&apos;t say anything about MIDI channels. So I wonder how you could possibly say which channels your message should be valid for. But don&apos;t tell me this information is not contained in an MTS message--even XG allows you to have different tunings on different channels, why should MTS not?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2009 9:53:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Forr&oacute; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There are Universal SysEx Headers: 7F for Real-time message, 7E for<br/>&gt; Non Real-time, and Universal Device ID, which is 7F.</p><p>Ahh, you&apos;re probably right, I&apos;ve missed that one.
