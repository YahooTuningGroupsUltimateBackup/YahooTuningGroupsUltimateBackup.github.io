To be honest, I&apos;d have a hard time getting too fired up<br/>about an isolated listen to *any* couple of chords or the like, though<br/>it does compliment the post nicely and work well enough in that<br/>respect, and as I said, I do appreciate you doing it. While I was on<br/>vacation I worked on (and actually for a change finished) a bunch of<br/>new material, including a couple of pieces in 20-tET using those<br/>11-tone scales. Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to get these dozen or so new<br/>pieces up at J.
