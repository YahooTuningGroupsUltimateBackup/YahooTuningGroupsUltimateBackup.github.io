For most in this &quot;academic setting&quot; a &quot;university=universe&quot; mind<br/>set is quite common.</p><p>Ibo: Would be nice if you would agree to those many parts, where it<br/>was simple (?) &quot;positivistic&quot; facts.</p><p>JR: Of course, I love when you have new information.  I even like it when you<br/>state baldly a particular point of view, making it plastic and potentially<br/>reusable.</p><p>Ibo: In our science, we often can&apos;t deliver just one result: It is<br/>often two possiblities, or a bunch of possiblities, or an &quot;area&quot;<br/>which can only be defined by narrowing in from the possible<br/>knowledge. And of course, it happens that scientists are wrong.<br/>We all do this or that mistake, sometimes sloppiness comes in<br/>too (and I&apos;m a good example for that).</p><p>JR: In the case of the 3/29/03 performance of Brandenburg Concerto #2, there<br/>are 2 performances for comparison.  We did a repeat as an encore.<br/>And yes, it will become available (as there is a third party).<br/>Ibo: How to deal with the question of &apos;running basses&apos; is adressed in<br/>sources on continuo-playing. And in-between-situations will<br/>occur of course and make the execution even more prone to<br/>deviations.</p><p>JR: We are not doing the deviations that your devious mind is divining. ;-)</p><p>&gt; So, your surmise doesn&apos;t match the music. This I have<br/>&gt; experienced repeatedly on &quot;free intonating&quot; wind<br/>&gt; instruments. There is a tuning and we are playing it.</p><p>Ibo: Claim! Proof? Will you publish an article with the exact<br/>measurements during a performance?</p><p>JR: I am writing it as a book.  I have just finished a book now looking for a<br/>publisher (&quot;The Ives Universe&quot;).  It went through many edits and corrections,<br/>and will surely endure more. To me it is cruel for you to beat up the guy<br/>that just did the concert and has put all the performances together at his<br/>own expense (though with a great team and the support of New York State<br/>Council on the Arts).</p><p>&gt; Ibo: early performance practices.<br/>can from that view be approached, when<br/>- using instruments the composer has used, or is<br/>at least likely to have used<br/>- using playing techniques, as close as we can<br/>come to<br/>- evaluating carefully and as much as possible archival<br/>and printed matter about the respective time, musical<br/>culture, thoughts</p><p>JR: We satisfied all three conditions.  We used alto recorder rather than a<br/>flute.  We used a harpsichord rather than a piano.  We used a double bass<br/>rather than an electric bass.  However, we did use a piccolo trumpet with<br/>pistons and a modern oboe.</p><p>You may be surprised that Bram (please allow me the chance not to spell his<br/>last name yet again) is an early music specialist and often plays baroque<br/>oboes in Nederland.  And besides the Gelders Orchestra being the third<br/>largest in the country, Bram has been substituting as principle oboe in the<br/>Concertgebouw Orchestra this past year.  (He&apos;s really good.)</p><p>Ibo: And since we have only a small part of evidence left from the<br/>past it is already difficult to judge from the performance (with<br/>all the possible prerequisites taken in account) what might be<br/>&quot;historical&quot; or what is &quot;modern&quot; it. We can&apos;t escape our<br/>present day - not by any means. And that is in my view the<br/>reason why &quot;historically informed performance practice&quot; is<br/>always a modern thing.</p><p>JR: I believe there is information available from other sources and you will<br/>have to be patient for me to outline it, or send it, or publish it, etc.</p><p>Ibo: Leaving out one of the three sketched points will reduce your<br/>available mosaiqe-pieces of the puzzle so much, that the<br/>historical reconstruction has way less probability. However, you<br/>might come to some correct conclusin by chance, but how would<br/>you judge? From your &quot;good taste&quot;, &quot;experience&quot;.</p><p>JR: I think you have hit this point hard enough by now, no?  Yes, you think I<br/>judge exclusively (or some degree close) to my &quot;good taste.&quot;  And I think you<br/>have seen yourself too much into my situation.</p><p>&gt; I can say now that if I can do<br/>&gt; something, it was doable, and imaginable by Bach.</p><p>Ibo: May be to the degree I sketched, if you work taking all<br/>available knowlegde and that is already a fiction for all of us.</p><p>JR: What is &quot;a fiction for all of us&quot;?  Are you speaking here for someone<br/>else?</p><p>Ibo: And what is &quot;imaginable by Bach&quot; we can&apos;t know, especially not<br/>if we think about him as a &quot;genius&quot;:</p><p>JR: You misunderstood.  I am saying that &quot;if&quot; I can hear something in Bach&apos;s<br/>music, than he surely heard it for himself.  And I am saying that he heard<br/>specific microtonal differences in melodic intervals which are identifiable<br/>in Werckmeister III.</p><p>For the moment, I say &quot;forget the title &apos;Werckmeister III&apos; as the name of the<br/>tuning we have performed.&quot;  What else can we call it so that it is not tied<br/>exclusively to one man.  I do believe it is a &quot;natural consequence&quot; of<br/>meantone.  By this I mean, it&apos;s derived from the very same process of<br/>flattening pure fifths, but in this manner only 4 fifths need to be tuned a<br/>quarter comma flat.  It is so logical that it is in actuality a &quot;pre-paper&quot;<br/>temperament.  Werckmeister admits to this himself.</p><p>Ibo: If you find out that something works on a modern oboe, it might<br/>not be playable on the baroque oboe, and vice versa.</p><p>JR: Double reeds are my specialty.  I am a virtuoso on the bassoon.  The<br/>principles I work with are ancient principles.  They are in some part<br/>transmitted through the centuries.  The open hole principles of these winds<br/>are the basis for the addition of keys.  Keys added to the oboe and bassoon<br/>are because of equal temperament.  Really, it&apos;s true!  The manipulation of<br/>the keys become quite clear when you move between the 2 tunings of<br/>meantone/just and ET.  Werckmeister III, or this &quot;natural consequence of<br/>meantone&quot; is built into the wooden instruments.  Really, it&apos;s true.  If fact,<br/>if I blow sharp on a bassoon reed with a thick spine, it goes into a pretty<br/>good Werckmeister III tuning.</p><p>Ibo: From tools (instruments) which are not representative for the<br/>music you are playing, you can&apos;t draw valid conclusions about a<br/>historical situation. And that invalidity includes, that your<br/>way of performing can (and I wish so) have an artistic value to<br/>us today.</p><p>JR: You are attempting to invalidate my way of experiencing music.  Shame on<br/>you.  Science is your religions, so be it.  But I&apos;m the guy that will bring<br/>you the best accuracy in tuning.  Why would you be so bullheaded that you<br/>know that I must be invalidated.</p><p>There is such a thing as &quot;musical intelligence&quot; which was formalized in<br/>Howard Gardner&apos;s &quot;Frames of Mind.&quot;  It is a different way &quot;some&quot; human beings<br/>gain intelligence from the world.  Through this &quot;musical intelligence,&quot; I<br/>gain knowledge of the world.  I recognize that you have your share of musical<br/>intelligence.  Not all scholars/historians/musicologists have musical<br/>intelligence.  And there is a vast chasm between the practice and its theory.<br/> It has always been so.  The musical intelligence of what we microtonally<br/>trained musicians can focus on a piece opens up new historical issues.  A<br/>recent example is the relationship between a tuning and its temp.<br/>Performance shows up that ET is played faster because there is nothing new to<br/>offer in sequences, a prominent element in Baroque writing.</p><p>&gt; If you have never heard my results, and I am right, where<br/>&gt; does that put my scepticism?</p><p>Ibo: The question is justified. I will answer it, as soon as you<br/>deliver inevitable proof, that your conclusions of the<br/>historical conditions as derived from your modern performances<br/>are &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>How exactly do you intend to find the missing information to<br/>integrate in your performances (maybe in the magnitude of 99%,<br/>since certainly most of historical sources on performannces and<br/>their circumstances are lost)?</p><p>JR: We are already incorporating a pool of early music people and virtuoso<br/>microtonalists to get pitch accurate performances.  Considering that a period<br/>person of the Baroque could not hear recordings, sharp and hard listening<br/>would be advisable.  Well, we do it.  But you say that it proves nothing of<br/>the past.  Except it does show what could be possible.</p><p>One more thing, I&apos;m not on trial.  Demanding evidence and chirping about<br/>evidence is at the least impatient of you.</p><p>Ibo: If I only think about much of the compositions from the 1960s,<br/>which included taped recordings. As soon as the plastic has<br/>corroded and the technology will not work anymore, the<br/>reconstruction work will begin. In one century from now,<br/>probably way earlier, you&apos;ll have the same situation for Kagel,<br/>Stockhausen, Berio and others. What will musicians make out<br/>their concepts, what material will musicologist still have to<br/>conclude from about such music.</p><p>It is fiction to think, that the composer&apos;s intention can be<br/>found back by performance.</p><p>JR: What about Jazz?  Modern Jazz players use the grooves of LP&apos;s still to<br/>get their first hand knowledge of Bebop.  Kagel, Stockhausen and Berio will<br/>do well to have great recordings of their music to go with their printed<br/>paper scores.</p><p>Ibo: What I questioned, how you could rely or check any of the<br/>sources or what others tell you about them, without being deeply<br/>rooted in German. How can you rely on translators, without<br/>double-checking? I definitely didn&apos;t want to insult, but I<br/>admit, that I didn&apos;t believe that you had any knowledge of<br/>German (and related languages), when I read your firm statements<br/>about alleged Dutch in Werckmeister and the too fast drawn<br/>conclusion from the wrong understanding of Mattheson&apos;s list of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s publications, plus the Walther-readings.</p><p>JR: Yes, there was Dutch in Werckmeister.  I saw it myself and it was not<br/>&quot;komma,&quot; etc.  And what should be more infuriating is that Werckmeister and<br/>Mattheson have not been translated and made available.  We should not feel<br/>obliged to trust secondary sources, even if these are scholars, or<br/>self-declared scientists.</p><p>&gt; Music has more power when it is performed in the<br/>&gt; intonation that is intended by the composer.</p><p>Ibo: I agree - to the degree of our possible knowledge.<br/>Unfortunately, this possible knowledge is way too scarce (for<br/>example regarding Bach).</p><p>JR: It&apos;s in Bach&apos;s paper intervals.  If one can accept, for a moment-without<br/>sarcasm-that Bach intended Werckmeister III for the Brandenburgs (and maybe<br/>most all of his compositions), then the intervalic distinctions of the tuning<br/>would be manifest in the writing.</p><p>My idea: I picked up a paperback copy of the Bach Werke Verzeichnis in<br/>Amsterdam with the intention to analyze the opening melodic interval of each<br/>prominent work by Bach.  All this to look for patterns in the usage of<br/>melodic intervals.</p><p>My rationale is that because Bach is horizontal or melodic music, the opening<br/>melodic interval would have more importance in musically laying out the<br/>sentiment of the melody.  With 39 distinct melodic intervals each 6 cents<br/>apart from its nearest neighbor, it is possible to determine which intervals<br/>are chosen and if there are patterns, based on the tablature nature of<br/>specifically notated intervals.  Werckmeister III really aids in helping the<br/>audience&apos;s ear distinguish lines from each other.</p><p>With Bach, the subject is stated with the opening interval setting the mood<br/>for the movement, independent of the key.  For example, I was able to<br/>discover that The Well-Tempered Clavier Book II has half of its Preludes and<br/>Fugues using opening melodic intervals that were not used to open up<br/>movements from WTC Book I.</p><p>Previously I mentioned, that yes, Bach only opens a movement with a LARGE<br/>semitone of 108 cents.  That is what opens the second movement of Brandenburg<br/>#2, an A up to Bb.  All the soloists play it in turn.  There are three other<br/>semitones, but Bach does not choose them.  In 4 different Brandenburgs there<br/>are 4 opening semitones, and each is-by virtue of the tablature (always<br/>starting the tuning on a C), the largest at 108 cents.  And absolutely yes I<br/>can hear this&mldr; and sing it aloud right now&mldr;and you could check it.  And all<br/>of Bach&apos;s perfect fifths are not so perfect at 696 cents.  Why?  Because it<br/>is more melodically satisfying most likely.</p><p>&gt; and mix tunings because you have rationalized<br/>&gt; that no one knows, can make the differences, or really<br/>&gt; has the depth of research and insight that you do.<br/>&gt; I have found things in the music that is performed in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III that sets it apart from paper tunings<br/>&gt; or later tunings.</p><p>Ibo: hmm - good argument!<br/>But correct me, if I&apos;m wrong: Wasn&apos;t Werckmeister III published<br/>in his time always on paper (and furtheron until the computer<br/>age)? Parchment wasn&apos;t used in his time anymore (may be one<br/>could find medieval &quot;parchment tunings&quot;!)</p><p>JR: Werckmeister claimed his chromatic tuning was already in practice.  This<br/>tuning works with the instruments that were written for.  A &quot;paper<br/>temperament&quot; might be something that looked good on paper but never received<br/>the necessary supporters.  Or worse, it would be so mathematically based and<br/>complex, that musicians could not make use of it.</p><p>Now, I know of your belief that keyboard temperament must not be confused<br/>with that of winds, but in Werckmeister III, it works!  Your gloom and doom<br/>predictions of our results are grey clouds.  Really, it&apos;s no different<br/>playing microtonally in Werckmeister III than it is in any other of the<br/>myriad of tunings that I have played in over three decades.</p><p>Ibo: Or, if you regard Werckmeister III, despite it&apos;s being rendered<br/>on paper, not as a paper tuning, what about the other<br/>Werckmeister temperaments, especially the one for &quot;regular<br/>modos&quot; in 1/3rd-p.c.<br/>And also Bendeler&apos;s temperaments? - Bendeler, who was a known<br/>friend and colleague of Werckmeister. Why are those paper<br/>temperaments, while Werckmeister III only should not?</p><p>JR: The diatonic Werckmeister tunings are worth a look, though they are not<br/>the &quot;natural consequence&quot; as much as the &quot;paper temperament&quot; idea, at least<br/>based on my experiences.  I look forward to checking out Bendeler, thanks to<br/>your lead.<br/>&Oslash; It is now late. I hope to present my idea</p><p>Ibo: &quot;my idea&quot;: that&apos;s a perfect and valid approach to which I agree,<br/>as you make clear that it is not to be claimed as Bach&apos;s idea,<br/>because we can&apos;t know it (and neither of us could speak for him).</p><p>And: Herbert Anton Kellner&apos;s life long experience lets him<br/>speak with greatest conviction that Bach&apos;s temperament is<br/>Kellner&apos;s 1/5-p.c.temperament, too.<br/>I wonder who of both of you will be finally able to prove that<br/>just his concept (or may be &quot;his just concept&quot;) is the one and<br/>only, and that Bach actually applied it.<br/>Anyway, I recommend to try and to use Kellner&apos;s temperament,<br/>too. It has, however, no historical record proving it to be<br/>Bach&apos;s temperament - like Werckmeister III.</p><p>JR: Herbert Anton Kellner is a friend of mine through the Internet.  He<br/>joined this list several years ago.  As it turned out we worked through<br/>everything together.  His tuning is really quite Werckmeister III except that<br/>the A is significantly higher.  There are other mathematical differences, but<br/>rather insignificant ones.  This was our mutual conclusion.  He was, of<br/>course, deep into Gemantria.</p><p>Ibo: &quot;Kellner-Bach&quot; is &quot;practical&quot;, sounds on many instruments well.<br/>and easy to adjust, also easy to change. One advantage is that<br/>tempered fifths are way better in &quot;Kellner&quot;, than<br/>Werckmeister-III-fifths (even worse than meantone fifths).</p><p>JR: I can send you a quote from him on this subject if you like.  Really<br/>there is little difference except one note between Kellner-Bach and<br/>Werckmeister III.</p><p>&gt; of Bach&apos;s use of particular intervals</p><p>Ibo: which also is on paper<br/>May be therefore we couldd use your terminology:<br/>&quot;Bach&apos;s paper intervals&quot; and &quot;Werckmeister&apos;s paper tunings&quot;</p><p>JR: You know, this is a good idea!   It could come in handy when<br/>differentiating more subtle shades of meaning.</p><p>&gt; as a source of Bach&apos;s expectation that certain interval<br/>&gt; distinctions would appear between particular keys of<br/>&gt; the keyboard.</p><p>Ibo: And who knows and proves what expectation Bach exactly had in<br/>mind, as Bach didn&apos;t leave the tiniest hint on this?</p><p>JR: It&apos;s in Bach&apos;s paper intervals.</p><p>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Kind regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music</p></div><h3><a id=43379 href="#43379">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2003 4:52:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Claim!

We tend to easily to forget, that F<br/>is not a special pitch if not related to a pitch-concept, but only a<br/>note name.  and I would like to take opportunity to mention that<br/>organs or other early keyboard instruments could be even in pitches a<br/>fourth aboev, or a fifth below the chamber and choir pitches. There<br/>seems however only one organ preserved, restored and partly<br/>reconstructed by Mads Kjersgaard: it is in the castle chapel of<br/>S&oslash;nderborg, Denmark, an instrument built in the 16th ct and rebuilt<br/>1626, and its  a&apos; is at 624 Hz&apos;. The organ has split keys (showing the<br/>probably most important factor in the development of the use of split<br/>keys)!<br/>The compass development down to C can of course be seen already rather<br/>early in historical keyboards, as the 1518  32&apos;-C (Subcontra C) in the<br/>pedal of L&uuml;beck St. Marien showed most impressive (it was probably the<br/>largest late gothic organ front built and fell victim to WWII in 1942)<br/>s. the foto of the front<br/><a href="http://space.tin.it/musica/fborsari/arretra/greats/lub02b.jpg">http://space.tin.it/musica/fborsari/arretra/greats/lub02b.jpg</a><br/>on the website<br/><a href="http://space.tin.it/musica/fborsari/arretra/greats/greats15.html">http://space.tin.it/musica/fborsari/arretra/greats/greats15.html</a><br/>The compass starting with CDEFGA-  might be in many cases &quot;extended&quot;<br/>F-compass.

I think that sort evidence has been covered more by me in<br/>this discussion - however contradicting your assumtions - and seems to<br/>be largely absent from your attempt to find (or to confirm your<br/>understanding of) Bach&apos;s practice.</p><p>And the prerequisite of using instruments is not fulfilled as much as<br/>your vague description allows to &quot;reconstruct:</p><p>&gt; We used alto recorder</p><p>There are many different:</p><p>type, historical model builder, relevance to Bach?</p><p>&gt; rather than a flute.</p><p>&gt; We used a harpsichord rather than a piano.</p><p>Of course, again</p><p>type of harpsichord (German, Flemish, flemish with ravalement ...),<br/>historical model builder, relevance to Bach?</p><p>&gt;  We used a double bass</p><p>In Bach&apos;s time violones were used (not double basses). 16&apos; or 8&apos; (8&apos;<br/>is may be more the older tradition)</p><p>&gt; rather than an electric bass.</p><p>&gt; However, we did use a piccolo trumpet with<br/>&gt; pistons</p><p>Why?<br/>Historical trumpets do not use pistons, instead the partial row is<br/>what the player has to use (see previous mails on pitch etc.)<br/>Also the timbre (and thus mainly partial structure) of the modern<br/>piston instruments is so different from what a baroque trumpet does,<br/>that I don&apos;t understand why you don&apos;t include this aspect in your<br/>exploring &quot;Bach&quot;.</p><p>So what is the relevance of using this modern instrument - and in the<br/>Brandenburg Concerto 2 it plays an important role in the balance for<br/>the concertino in both outer movements.</p><p>&gt; and a modern oboe.</p><p>Again, timbre etc. ?  And ...</p><p>&gt; You may be surprised that Bram (please allow me the chance not<br/>&gt; to spell his last name yet again) is an early music specialist<br/>&gt; and often plays baroque oboes in Nederland.</p><p> ...  as Mr. Kreeftmeijer is such an outstanding virtuoso on the<br/>baroque obe, why did you miss the chance of using his skills on an<br/>instrument especially important and left it out from your<br/>Bach-performance?</p><p>&gt; And besides the Gelders Orchestra being the third<br/>&gt; largest in the country,</p><p>Size doesn&apos;t count to me</p><p>&gt; Bram has been substituting as principle oboe in the<br/>&gt; Concertgebouw Orchestra this past year.  (He&apos;s really<br/>&gt; good.)</p><p>I don&apos;t doubt his excellence - but that had nothing to do with the<br/>arguments.</p><p>Summary up to here is:  you use at best a mix of instruments - modern,<br/>or partly modern, may be even a few historical models according to<br/>what is standard knowledge and use of the in HIP practice (to name a<br/>few: Parrott, Rifkin, McCreesh, Leonhardt, Goebel, Alessandrini,<br/>Kuijken etc.).<br/>In terms of instrumentation any possible relevance to Bach is<br/>therefore until know not sufficiently supported by your performances.<br/>And with the modern instruments you can&apos;t use historical playing<br/>techniques, sometimes already for reasons of mechanics: that<br/>prerequisite also is not fulfilled.</p><p>But again: I don&apos;t deny the artistic value as such in your approach.</p><p>...</p><p>&gt; JR: I believe there is information available from other sources</p><p>Why do you only believe that?<br/>Don&apos;t you have evidence for your point that you &quot;reconstruct&quot; Bach&apos;s<br/>temperament practice? You announced even in subject line that you have<br/>evidence.</p><p>&gt; and you will have to be patient for me to outline it, or<br/>&gt; send it, or publish it, etc.</p><p>I always can wait until evidence about the historical situation in<br/>BAch&apos;s time is published.  Archival and source based work needs time<br/>and effort.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Leaving out one of the three sketched points will reduce your<br/>&gt; available mosaiqe-pieces of the puzzle so much, that the<br/>&gt; historical reconstruction has way less probability. However, you<br/>&gt; might come to some correct conclusin by chance, but how would<br/>&gt; you judge? From your &quot;good taste&quot;, &quot;experience&quot;.</p><p>&gt; JR: I think you have hit this point hard enough by now, no?  Yes,<br/>&gt; you think</p><p>You can&apos;t even imagine, what I think - and neither do I imagine what<br/>you think.</p><p>&gt; I judge exclusively (or some degree close) to my &quot;good taste.&quot;<br/>&gt; And I think you have seen yourself too much into my situation.</p><p>No, certainly not, How could I (even if I wanted to)?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I can say now that if I can do something, it<br/>&gt;&gt; was doable, and imaginable by Bach.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: May be to the degree I sketched, if you work taking all<br/>&gt; available knowlegde and that is already a fiction for all of us.</p><p>&gt; JR: What is &quot;a fiction for all of us&quot;?  Are you speaking here for<br/>&gt; someone else?</p><p>Yes, to all those like me, who are more or less patiently waiting for<br/>the evidence, you announced.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: And what is &quot;imaginable by Bach&quot; we can&apos;t know, especially not<br/>&gt; if we think about him as a &quot;genius&quot;:</p><p>&gt; JR: You misunderstood.  I am saying that &quot;if&quot; I can hear<br/>&gt; something in Bach&apos;s music, than he surely heard it for<br/>&gt; himself.</p><p>No, he had no modern oboe or piston trumpet.<br/>But we might agree that, if Bach were alive today, he would be able to<br/>hear, what you hear, too, in your modern performance of his works. But<br/>whether he would agree to you or to me is not known at all.</p><p>He might have composed differntly if he had had a modern oboe, a<br/>steinway ... to explore the specific timbre of such modern<br/>instruments. How could anyone know. And mainly in his ensemble music,<br/>he was highly practical as numerous reworkings, transpositions,<br/>parodies etc. show.</p><p>&gt;  And I am saying that he heard specific microtonal<br/>&gt; differences in melodic intervals which are identifiable<br/>&gt; in Werckmeister III.</p><p>Sure, if he tuned his harpsichord, or unfretted Clavichord to W III<br/>(and then until the next day) and as practitioner, he would probably<br/>not touch up the instrument everyday<br/>The story of his tuning the instrument in 15 minutes is also not just<br/>taken literally. t doesn&apos;t say something about the event when tat is<br/>supposed to have happened, nothing about the quality of tuning, not<br/>even which type of temperament it could have been.<br/>The anecdote might even be an exaggeration, to call down Bach&apos;s<br/>authority in support of a later statement.</p><p>&gt; For the moment, I say &quot;forget the title &apos;Werckmeister III&apos;<br/>&gt; as the name of the tuning we have performed.&quot;  What<br/>&gt; else can we call it so that it is not tied<br/>&gt; exclusively to one man.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter - if we know and agree on what W III stands for we<br/>can use the name or abbreviation.</p><p>&gt; I do believe it is a &quot;natural consequence&quot; of meantone.  By<br/>&gt; this I mean, it&apos;s derived from the very same process of<br/>&gt; flattening pure fifths, but in this manner only 4 fifths<br/>&gt; need to be tuned a quarter comma flat.  It is so logical</p><p>to you</p><p>&gt; that it is in actuality a &quot;pre-paper&quot; temperament.<br/>&gt; Werckmeister admits to this himself.</p><p>What does he admit? what are you referring to?</p><p>&gt; Ibo: If you find out that something works on a modern oboe,<br/>&gt; it might not be playable on the baroque oboe, and vice versa.</p><p>&gt; JR: Double reeds are my specialty.  I am a virtuoso on the<br/>&gt; bassoon.  The principles I work with are ancient principles.<br/>&gt; They are in some part transmitted through the centuries.<br/>&gt; The open hole principles of these winds are the basis for<br/>&gt; the addition of keys.  Keys added to the oboe and bassoon<br/>&gt; are because of equal temperament.  Really, it&apos;s true!</p><p>Really? (The c#-Klappe was not invented for any temperament).</p><p>By the way, concerning traverse flutes:   if W III or some similar<br/>temperament would have been used by free intonating instruments, why<br/>did Quantz invent the d#-Klappe to have both a e-flat and d# available<br/>on the flute? Let us remember that he and Bach&apos;s son CPE cooperated<br/>for years in the same ensemble (!) ath the court in Berlin.</p><p>&gt;  The manipulation of the keys become quite clear when you<br/>&gt; move between the 2 tunings of meantone/just and ET.<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III, or this &quot;natural consequence of<br/>&gt; meantone&quot; is built into the wooden instruments.<br/>&gt; Really, it&apos;s true.</p><p>&gt;If fact, if I blow sharp on a bassoon reed with a thick spine, it<br/>&gt; goes into a pretty good Werckmeister III tuning.</p><p>Pretty good is not good enough: According to the standards you have<br/>claimed, it means that you must constantly produce degrees of<br/>exactidude of 0.5 cents.  How do you cope with the diffrences in<br/>temperature inside the tube, for example after a break of several<br/>minutes?  And do you always have an measuring tool at hand for all<br/>players?</p><p>&gt; Ibo: From tools (instruments) which are not representative for the<br/>&gt; music you are playing, you can&apos;t draw valid conclusions about a<br/>&gt; historical situation. And that invalidity includes, that your<br/>&gt; way of performing can (and I wish so) have an artistic value to<br/>&gt; us today.</p><p>&gt; JR: You are attempting to invalidate my way of experiencing music.</p><p>If you read my mails carefully you could find quite many places where<br/>I speak with respect about your modern approach for its artistic value.</p><p>&gt;  Shame on you.  Science is your religions,</p><p>At first I should state something that might have caused<br/>misunderstandings:  &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; - science - in German inludes all:<br/>natural sciences, humaniora.  soemone else pointed me to the dichotomy<br/>of terms in English: &quot;schientific&quot; or &quot;scholarly&quot; - in German both are<br/>&quot;wissenschaftlich&quot;.<br/>In this sense I write and mean all methods which establish and develop<br/>knowledge, by proving, checking, counter-checking etc. This contrary<br/>to religion, belief.  Religion, belief are personal matters and it is<br/>the task of science to  exclude such factors as much as possible. To<br/>tis aim scientifc methods are constantly developed and refined.<br/>Science is no religion. But, on the other hand you are constantly<br/>asking for belief in your unproven claims.</p><p>&gt; so be it.  But I&apos;m the guy that will bring you the best<br/>&gt; accuracy in tuning.</p><p>I can only repeat, that after so many years of tuning and tempering<br/>private, for concerts and records, I really look forward to get the<br/>professional lessons I always have missed.</p><p>&gt;  Why would you be so bullheaded<br/>&gt; that you know that I must be invalidated.</p><p>What exactly are you asking?</p><p>&gt; There is such a thing as &quot;musical intelligence&quot; which was<br/>&gt; formalized in Howard Gardner&apos;s &quot;Frames of Mind.&quot;  It is a<br/>&gt; different way &quot;some&quot; human beings gain intelligence from<br/>&gt; the world.  Through this &quot;musical intelligence,&quot; I<br/>&gt; gain knowledge of the world.  I recognize that you have your<br/>&gt; share of musical intelligence.  Not all scholars/historians/<br/>&gt; musicologists have musical intelligence.<br/>&gt;  And there is a vast chasm between the practice and its<br/>&gt; theory.<br/>&gt;  It has always been so.  The musical intelligence</p><p>To the benevolent reader:<br/>Please &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; in the previous 10 lines<br/>(starting with  &quot;There is such ...&quot;)  by &quot;belief&quot; and read it again.</p><p>This club is too well known to be taken serious:<br/>   &quot;scholars/historians/musicologists are only<br/>    sometimes &quot;musically intelligent&quot;.&quot;</p><p>Hmmm - I frequently hear musicians, whose &quot;musical intelligence&quot; I<br/>have reason to doubt...</p><p>&gt; of what<br/>&gt; we microtonally trained musicians can focus on a piece<br/>&gt; opens up new historical issues.</p><p>Yes agreed, like your honorable performance of Bachs Brandenburg<br/>Concerto 2 is already a part of preformance history, though still<br/>rather new.  Whether it might have to do with the history or<br/>historical situation of ca. 1720 is however always in question.</p><p>&gt;  A recent example is the<br/>&gt; relationship between a tuning and its temp.<br/>&gt; Performance shows up that ET is played faster because there<br/>&gt; is nothing new to offer in sequences, a prominent element<br/>&gt; in Baroque writing.</p><p>Again (see previous mail): why did Bach himself transpose organ pieces<br/>and harpsichord pieces if the sequence included where so important.</p><p>And historically your arguent is not correct at all, since the playing<br/>of Baroque music in the 20th century unti now shows that the tendency<br/>to faster tempi has strongly grown by HIP practiced, which applies<br/>keyboard temperaments (also often Werckmeister or of course other<br/>historical models, even ET) in the continuo instruments.<br/>It has probably not to do with temperament at all. As much as we can<br/>generalize,  tempi in Quantz&apos; time (and until long into the 19th<br/>century) tended to be way faster than in the  performance tradition of<br/>the 20th century. And as frequently stated, Quantz and oher important<br/>authors explain and ask for the as pure as possible intonation. (in<br/>many manuals you find explained the different ratios of natural<br/>intervals extensively)</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you have never heard my results, and I am right, where<br/>&gt; &gt; does that put my scepticism?</p><p>&gt; Ibo: The question is justified. I will answer it, as soon as you<br/>&gt; deliver inevitable proof, that your conclusions of the<br/>&gt; historical conditions as derived from your modern performances<br/>&gt; are &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>&gt; How exactly do you intend to find the missing information to<br/>&gt; integrate in your performances (maybe in the magnitude of 99%,<br/>&gt; since certainly most of historical sources on performannces and<br/>&gt; their circumstances are lost)?</p><p>&gt; JR: We are already incorporating a pool of early music people</p><p>Why not for example with th oboe and the trumpet, etc.?</p><p>&gt; and virtuoso microtonalists to get pitch accurate<br/>&gt; performances.  Considering that a period person of<br/>&gt; the Baroque could not hear recordings, sharp and hard<br/>&gt; listening would be advisable.  Well, we do it.  But<br/>&gt; you say that it proves nothing of<br/>&gt; the past.  Except it does show what could be possible.</p><p>Not with irrelevant modern instruments on which old playing techniques<br/>can&apos;t be explored.</p><p>&gt; One more thing, I&apos;m not on trial.  Demanding evidence<br/>&gt; and chirping about evidence is at the least impatient of you.</p><p>You wrote that subject line &quot;evidence&quot; in messages Nr.  43329 and 43330</p><p>&gt; Ibo: If I only think about much of the compositions from the 1960s,<br/>&gt; which included taped recordings. As soon as the plastic has<br/>&gt; corroded and the technology will not work anymore, the<br/>&gt; reconstruction work will begin. In one century from now,<br/>&gt; probably way earlier, you&apos;ll have the same situation for Kagel,<br/>&gt; Stockhausen, Berio and others. What will musicians make out<br/>&gt; their concepts, what material will musicologist still have to<br/>&gt; conclude from about such music.</p><p>&gt; It is fiction to think, that the composer&apos;s intention can be<br/>&gt; found back by performance.</p><p>&gt; JR: What about Jazz?  Modern Jazz players use the grooves of<br/>&gt; LP&apos;s still to get their first hand knowledge of Bebop.<br/>&gt; Kagel, Stockhausen and Berio will do well to have great<br/>&gt; recordings of their music to go with their printed<br/>&gt; paper scores.</p><p>I didn&apos;t speak of just recordings of performances, but composition.</p><p>I said &quot;compositions from the 1960s, which included taped<br/>recordings&quot; and that means tape recordings as part of the performance<br/>(pieces for &quot;Chor und Tonband&quot; etc.)</p><p>Also of course electronical music which needs certain technical<br/>equipment, will be subject to the same aging process, because some<br/>techniques might not be reconstructable in an appropriate way in some<br/>decades (In computers we see the monkey race all the time, updating<br/>etc. - who can still read floppy disks?)</p><p>&gt; Ibo: What I questioned, how you could rely or check any of the<br/>&gt; sources or what others tell you about them, without being deeply<br/>&gt; rooted in German. How can you rely on translators, without<br/>&gt; double-checking? I definitely didn&apos;t want to insult, but I<br/>&gt; admit, that I didn&apos;t believe that you had any knowledge of<br/>&gt; German (and related languages), when I read your firm statements<br/>&gt; about alleged Dutch in Werckmeister and the too fast drawn<br/>&gt; conclusion from the wrong understanding of Mattheson&apos;s list of<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s publications, plus the Walther-readings.</p><p>&gt; JR: Yes, there was Dutch in Werckmeister.  I saw it myself<br/>&gt; and it was not &quot;komma,&quot; etc.</p><p>Ok, which word used by Werckmeister was a Dutch word?  And not one<br/>being used in German in his time - since it might have come into Dutch<br/>later.</p><p>&gt; And what should be more infuriating is that Werckmeister and<br/>&gt; Mattheson have not been translated and made available.  We<br/>&gt; should not feel obliged to trust secondary sources, even if<br/>&gt; these are scholars, or self-declared scientists.</p><p>...and not trust judgements from performance with instruments Bach<br/>didn&apos;t use, to be what Bach wanted or might have wanted, even if that<br/>is self-declared by the performers (unregarding their appreciated<br/>&quot;musical intelligence&quot;)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Music has more power when it is performed in the<br/>&gt;&gt; intonation that is intended by the composer.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: I agree - to the degree of our possible knowledge.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, this possible knowledge is way too scarce (for<br/>&gt; example regarding Bach).</p><p>&gt; JR: It&apos;s in Bach&apos;s paper intervals.  If one can accept, for<br/>&gt; a moment-without sarcasm-that Bach intended Werckmeister III<br/>&gt; for the Brandenburgs (and maybe most all of his compositions),<br/>&gt; then the intervalic distinctions of the tuning would be<br/>&gt; manifest in the writing.</p><p>No, not even then it is not, since the intervals written do not<br/>represent a temperament.</p><p>&gt; My idea: I picked up a paperback copy of the Bach Werke<br/>&gt; Verzeichnis in Amsterdam with the intention to analyze the<br/>&gt; opening melodic interval</p><p>of which part or voice?<br/>If I think of the first movement of the Brandenb. Concerto 2, in which<br/>all instruments start at the same time, with four or five motives at<br/>the same time, all arund the F-major chord, what is &quot;the opening<br/>melodical interval&quot; in that?</p><p>And what about the intervals in the baroque trumpet (in F!) which you<br/>didn&apos;t have in your performance?</p><p>&gt; of each prominent work by Bach.  All this to look for patterns<br/>&gt; in the usage of melodic intervals.</p><p>For the Brandenburg Concerti that has been done (cf. also the recent<br/>study by Peter Schleuning)</p><p>&gt; My rationale is that because Bach is horizontal or melodic<br/>&gt; music,</p><p>Bach was already in his time adressed as  great harmonist, and his<br/>counterpoint is harmonically based.  Another reason to apply &quot;harmonic<br/>intonation&quot; (as sketched by the 18th century sources..) to Bach and<br/>not a keyboard temperament concept.</p><p>&gt; the opening melodic interval would have more importance<br/>&gt; in musically laying out the sentiment of<br/>&gt; the melody.  With 39 distinct melodic intervals each 6 cents<br/>&gt; apart from its nearest neighbor,</p><p>And still the question of transposition lurks in the back</p><p>&gt; it is possible to determine which intervals are chosen and<br/>&gt; if there are patterns, based on the tablature nature of<br/>&gt; specifically notated intervals.</p><p>Bach notated this in staff notation, and used tablature only seldom<br/>when running out of space.</p><p>&gt;  Werckmeister III really aids in helping the<br/>&gt; audience&apos;s ear distinguish lines from each other.</p><p>It is a matter of using the instruments of the time, has not to with<br/>temperament then.<br/>Since you use modern instruments in your performance you will get<br/>balance problems, and it may well be, that as much as you approach a<br/>rendering in Werckmeister III, it might help to overcome the balance<br/>problems. If creates good muic, why not.</p><p>&gt; With Bach, the subject is stated with the opening interval<br/>&gt; setting the mood for the movement, independent of the<br/>&gt; key.  For example, I was able to discover that The<br/>&gt; Well-Tempered Clavier Book II has half of its Preludes and<br/>&gt; Fugues using opening melodic intervals that were not used<br/>&gt; to open up  movements from WTC Book I.</p><p>How do explain, that bach used in both collections (not &quot;cycles&quot;) many<br/>older compositions, transposed, reworked etc.</p><p>&gt; Previously I mentioned, that yes, Bach only opens a movement<br/>&gt; with a LARGE semitone of 108 cents.</p><p>Some openings in WTC I which would have intervals smaller than 108<br/>cent (WIII)</p><p>PR-prelude<br/>FU-fugue</p><p>WTC I,<br/>c#-FU      c# - b#<br/>E-flat-PR  g - a-flat<br/>f-FU       c - d-flat<br/>A-flat PR  a-flat - g<br/>g#-FU      g# - f##<br/>B-PR/FU    b - a#</p><p>in WTC II it goes on wit ca. 5 or 6 prominent examples.</p><p>&gt; That is what opens the second movement of<br/>&gt; Brandenburg #2, an A up to Bb.  All the soloists play it<br/>&gt; in turn.  There are three other semitones, but Bach<br/>&gt; does not choose them.  In 4 different Brandenburgs there<br/>&gt; are 4 opening semitones, and each is-by virtue of the<br/>&gt; tablature (always starting the tuning on a C), the<br/>&gt; largest at 108 cents.  And absolutely yes I can hear<br/>&gt; this&acirc;Â€&brvbar; and sing it aloud right now&acirc;Â€&brvbar;and you could<br/>&gt; check it.</p><p>You can do the measuring, to bring proof.</p><p>&gt;  And all of Bach&apos;s perfect fifths are not so perfect<br/>&gt; at 696 cents.  Why?  Because it<br/>&gt; is more melodically satisfying most likely.</p><p>But the trumpet in BC 2, #3 opens with a fifth (sounding F-C) and<br/>according to your claim that Werckmeister III should not be transposed<br/>it should produce a Werckmeister C-G (as transposing instrument)</p><p>&gt; &gt; and mix tunings because you have rationalized<br/>&gt; &gt; that no one knows, can make the differences, or really<br/>&gt; &gt; has the depth of research and insight that you do.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have found things in the music that is performed in<br/>&gt; &gt; Werckmeister III that sets it apart from paper tunings<br/>&gt; &gt; or later tunings.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: hmm - good argument!<br/>&gt; But correct me, if I&apos;m wrong: Wasn&apos;t Werckmeister III published<br/>&gt; in his time always on paper (and furtheron until the computer<br/>&gt; age)? Parchment wasn&apos;t used in his time anymore (may be one<br/>&gt; could find medieval &quot;parchment tunings&quot;!)</p><p>&gt; JR: Werckmeister claimed his chromatic tuning was already<br/>&gt; in practice.</p><p>Amazing what people not do to sell their new products. But, on the<br/>contrary he complains and defends himself, ... Indon&apos;t need top repaet<br/>things over and over ...</p><p>&gt;  This<br/>&gt; tuning works with the instruments that were written for.</p><p>So, if that is so, why don&apos;t you use such instruments? Like for<br/>example Kreeftmeijers baroque oboe.</p><p>&gt; A &quot;paper temperament&quot; might be something that looked good<br/>&gt; on paper but never received the necessary supporters.</p><p>Ah, like W III in organ building -<br/>and Bach&apos;s famous Lorenz Mizler (in whose &quot;Soziet&auml;t&quot; Bach was a<br/>member) wrote that Werckmeister&apos;s temperament were a good try, but<br/>that Niedhardt improved the temperament greatly</p><p>&gt;  Or worse, it would be so mathematically based and<br/>&gt; complex, that musicians could not make use of it.</p><p>&gt; Now, I know of your belief that keyboard temperament must<br/>&gt; not be confused with that of winds,</p><p>No, you don&apos;t know my belief! This is only stated in the contemporary<br/>sources.</p><p>&gt; but in Werckmeister III, it works!  Your gloom and doom<br/>&gt; predictions of our results are grey clouds.</p><p>This shows only that you read selectively.<br/>I have politely spoken good about the possible high artistic value<br/>your performances. More I can&apos;t do since I didn&apos;t hear them.</p><p>&gt; Really, it&apos;s no different playing microtonally in<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III than it is in any other of the<br/>&gt; myriad of tunings that I have played in over three decades.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: Or, if you regard Werckmeister III, despite it&apos;s being rendered<br/>&gt; on paper, not as a paper tuning, what about the other<br/>&gt; Werckmeister temperaments, especially the one for &quot;regular<br/>&gt; modos&quot; in 1/3rd-p.c.<br/>&gt; And also Bendeler&apos;s temperaments? - Bendeler, who was a known<br/>&gt; friend and colleague of Werckmeister. Why are those paper<br/>&gt; temperaments, while Werckmeister III only should not?</p><p>&gt; JR: The diatonic Werckmeister tunings are worth a look, though<br/>&gt; they are not the &quot;natural consequence&quot; as much as the<br/>&gt; &quot;paper temperament&quot; idea, at least based on my experiences.<br/>&gt;  I look forward to checking out Bendeler, thanks to<br/>&gt; your lead.</p><p>...</p><p>&gt; JR: ...<br/>&gt; Really there is little difference except one note between<br/>&gt; Kellner-Bach and Werckmeister III.</p><p>Tuning a harpschord to the one or the other can make a important<br/>difference. Due to the different beats and beat rates the behave quite<br/>different</p><p>&gt; &gt; of Bach&apos;s use of particular intervals</p><p>&gt; Ibo: which also is on paper<br/>&gt; May be therefore we couldd use your terminology:<br/>&gt; &quot;Bach&apos;s paper intervals&quot; and &quot;Werckmeister&apos;s paper tunings&quot;</p><p>&gt; JR: You know, this is a good idea!   It could come in handy when<br/>&gt; differentiating more subtle shades of meaning.</p><p>Agreed, when do you start?</p><p>&gt; &gt; as a source of Bach&apos;s expectation that certain interval<br/>&gt; &gt; distinctions would appear between particular keys of<br/>&gt; &gt; the keyboard.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: And who knows and proves what expectation Bach exactly<br/>&gt; had in mind, as Bach didn&apos;t leave the tiniest hint on this?</p><p>&gt; JR: It&apos;s in Bach&apos;s paper intervals.</p><p>If you think that intervals &quot;express&quot; some meaning, ...<br/>(but, however, transposition by Bach himself ...)</p><p>Kind regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p></div><h3><a id=43426 href="#43426">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/19/2003 9:17:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; In a message dated 4/18/03 11:56:41 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; alternativetuning@y... writes:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I do not think Werckmeister should ever be transposed.</p><p>Ibo: Why not?</p><p>JR: The tuning of Werckmeister III already has a world of tuning in it.  If a<br/>composer (like Bach) transposes it is for a reason.  I cannot know every<br/>reason.  Maybe one player preferred playing a black keys.  Maybe, besides<br/>instrumentation, there were different sentiments that could be expressed<br/>without the need of writing any new music!  That&apos;s the most likely idea for<br/>the WTC changes from C to C# major.  It&apos;s another way to have a new piece for<br/>a certain situation&mldr;.and in Werckmeister III it may actually &quot;sound&quot; like a<br/>different piece to audiences (who likely never head the first versions of the<br/>piece).</p><p>There is no absolute pitch attached to Werckmeister III, but it must start on<br/>C so that the flatted fifths are in the designated places.  Otherwise, the<br/>plan is interrupted (sort of like a case of car sickness to me).  I believe<br/>there was a kind of Thuringian Perfect Pitch, in that one could tell one<br/>Werckmeister III from another purely by its melodic shape.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What to do when some of the instruments are at Kammerton and<br/>&gt;&gt; others at low pitch? Sometimes the organ&apos;s A was around a m3<br/>&gt;&gt; below Kammerton A. I&apos;m no expert, but I do know that there<br/>&gt;&gt; are cases where scores and parts are in different keys to make<br/>&gt;&gt; up for this difference.</p><p>Ibo: Yes, thanks abor for bringing this important topic! There are many<br/>scores from Bach which take account of that discrepancy.</p><p>JR: I agree this is an important topic.  When speaking at Indiana University<br/>several months ago, the director of the Graduate Choral Department, Jan<br/>Harrington, asked me specifically about this.  I had just put Ab major on the<br/>blackboard in cents so that I could help the conductors/vocalists how to sing<br/>the key correctly in Werckmeister III without a keyboard, or other aiding<br/>instrument.  (Much was based on 204 cents.)  As it turned out, they were<br/>preparing for a St. Matthew&apos;s Passion performance with the new organ, tuned<br/>to Werckmeister III.</p><p>And the opening has the 2 organs, one a whole step below.  I&apos;ve been thinking<br/>about this a lot.  The subject of chor and kammer pitch is confusing,<br/>especially since Kuhnau changed their relationships in Leipzig before Bach<br/>arrived there.  After some thought, I still think the score would be<br/>different than a part in this case.  The score must show all the<br/>relationships in tune, but the organist could transpose to the closest key.<br/>It might even add to the colorings.  But other than ET, I believe there is no<br/>way to match exactly every note to the transposed key (a whole step apart).</p><p>&gt; Strings can tune to make the difference. Wind players<br/>&gt; had instruments a whole tone apart for just these situations.</p><p>&gt; (This is why there are instruments in Bb today, as well<br/>&gt; as families of instruments based on the Bb.)</p><p>Ibo: The pitch of a&apos; ca. 415 Hz would be a modern instrument in B, not<br/>B-flat.  Seen from the &quot;(principal) chorton&quot; (a&apos; ca. 465 Hz) in which the<br/>organs where usually tuned in Bach&apos;s area, you would actually be<br/>right. (then we have also the organs at high chorton (a&apos; ca. 494 Hz)<br/>and the development in some organs by Silbermann which were</p><p>JR: Since the research of Mendel and Ellis, it has been recognized that there<br/>was no single Hz center for tuning organs in Thuringia.  Are you reversing<br/>this historical understanding?  I would be surprised.  An &quot;A&quot; could be<br/>pitched most anywhere in the Baroque period.  The sub-categories of chor,<br/>tief-chor, kammer, with a whole step separation is what makes for a Bb to C<br/>relationship.</p><p>Ibo: However, if we assume a Werckeister III-temperament in an organ -<br/>which Silbermann to our knowledge didn&apos;t use (he probably can&apos;t have<br/>had ears, or?) - which is in a&apos; ca. 465 Hz and the oboes play in C,<br/>then the organ has to accompany in D.</p><p>JR: Silbermann was not a Thuringian.  His tuition (from his relatives)<br/>required that he work a different German area than they did.  So, he took his<br/>non-Thuringian ears to the Saxons and put out the meantone he was most<br/>comfortable with, and for which there was still demand.</p><p>Ibo: Involving other instruments forms alos a tricky problem like natural<br/>trumpets in chorton-D (i.e. modern E-flat) to the organ and oboes.<br/>The trumpets play C-e (pure), accompanied by the D-f# of the organ and<br/>the oboes have to play E-g# - or if the play at lower french pitch (<br/>a&apos;- 392 Hz) they could play F-a. Now if they all play or are tuned in<br/>Werckmeister III - untransposed of course - then they arrive at three<br/>different major thirds at the same time.</p><p>JR: Lets talk about trumpets.  You don&apos;t tune the physical trumpet to<br/>Werckmeister III, you tune the trumpet player&apos;s mind to signal to his or her<br/>embouchure.  The modern trumpeter can play on average a minor third band<br/>width (a whole step below and a half-step above a given note).  The<br/>Thuringian versions were straight, quieter, but likely had the same large<br/>bandwidth for the embouchure.  There is no controversy here.</p><p>Ibo: Johnny, how do you explain this?<br/>You say that you use modern trumpets (from the other instrument types<br/>you mentioned, the description was so vague like alto recorder,</p><p>JR:  I use a Dolmetch alto recorder which retains ivory trims.  It was<br/>reputed to be among the last of the master instrument maker&apos;s last<br/>instruments before he died.  And it was the only one &quot;in tune&quot; in ET, a<br/>beautifully centered sound which spoke with great ease.  (It was from a<br/>Scotsman working a double reed festival in Rotterdam, and having taken the<br/>serial number, I purchased the instruments several years later.)  I did not<br/>inspect the trumpet, but I will check on it and on the harpsichord if you<br/>like.</p><p>Ibo: taht<br/>it was not possible to find out whether you uuse historical<br/>instruments, or not - and what kind of harpsichord, according to which<br/>historical model etc.)<br/>For the pitch-question Bruce Haynes&apos; dissertation from 1995 is basic<br/>reading. His article on pitch in the New New Grove gives an excellent<br/>summary (still to the pint and even as a summary exact)</p><p>JR: Thank you for this direction.  Haynes&apos; name is familiar to me but I have<br/>not seriously explored his ideas.</p><p>&gt; Continuo players were trained to transpose to different keys<br/>&gt; by Werckmeister&apos;s time (as says W.).</p><p>Ibo: Yes, they used to transpose for several reasons since a long time<br/>before W.</p><p>&gt; Sometimes Bach transposed because of a different instrumentation<br/>&gt; (like when going to F Major to have more resonance in a<br/>&gt; harpsichord solo).</p><p>Why would he then transpose harpsichord solo pieces from C to C#, if<br/>resonance would play a role in that?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure, Gabor, I know which cases you are speaking of.</p><p>Ibo: I don&apos;t kknow either - but please explain why he would transpose pieces</p><p>JR: I don&apos;t know for any particular piece either, but I have tried to outline<br/>some probabilities at the top of this post.</p><p>Ibo:&mldr;And quite many of Bach&apos;s harpsichord pieces are transposed - often by<br/>Bach himself (several cases documented for the WTC!). That is even more a<br/>question &quot;why?&quot;, because a harpsichord could be retuned easily.<br/><a href="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-in/wa?A2=ind9904&L=hpschd-l&P=R5426">http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-in/wa?A2=ind9904&L=hpschd-l&P=R5426</a></p><p>JR: etc.  Yes, a composer would transpose their music.  It is BECAUSE there<br/>is a difference that a composer transposes a piece.  Bach transposed Vivaldi<br/>early enough.  Most often violins to keyboards.  Bach would add more<br/>chromaticism and more virtuosity, along with shifting the keys.  Bach&apos;s<br/>tuning made a difference in a particular key.</p><p>Vivaldi was an extended meantone (how else to explain the E# in the E Minor<br/>Bassoon Concerto in the solo).  It makes all the sense in the world for Bach<br/>to borrow ideas from a 10-year older Vivaldi and shift them from Venice to<br/>Thuringia.  Each transposition likely has a specific story.  Historians, get<br/>thee to the stories themselves!  (But, not necessarily Ibo, who probably<br/>wants and deserves a vacation&mldr;.hey! I wouldn&apos;t mind.)</p><p>&gt; Johann Philipp Kirnberger, Bach&apos;s most accomplished theory<br/>&gt; student,</p><p>Ibo: If Kirnberger was so accomplished (and certainly he was!), why didn&apos;t he<br/>report faithfully if his master Bach tempered according to<br/>Werckmeister?</p><p>JR: At last: a trick question!  (If, and he was, hmmn&mldr;.)  (this is really<br/>great fun on a another warry day)</p><p>Kirnberger clearly lost some credibility when he wrote the 1776 &quot;Art of<br/>Strict Composition&quot; but his devotion to Bach is beyond question.  What<br/>appears to have happened is that music itself had changed.</p><p>Music was now thought of as primarily vertical.  Some had suggested that the<br/>world had been waiting for Bach to die since at least 1740, but out of<br/>respect waited until the proper time of 1750 for the counterpoint master to<br/>pass.</p><p>26 years later, at the same time as the U.S.A. was being founded, Kirnberger<br/>tried to push his own temperament ahead of all others, because MUSIC CHANGED.<br/> Now was the time to focus on the pure qualities of harmonies and Kirnberger<br/>was a big fan of just intonation (unlike Bach).  Kirnberger even used the<br/>harmonic 7/4 ratio in his flute sonata, using the notation of the letter &quot;i&quot;<br/>before a Bb.</p><p>I have done a study, however, comparing Kirberger II to Werckemeister III in<br/>order to see if the purer keys of one correspond to the other, and to see if<br/>they continue to variegate (a Kirnberger term) along a similar route to the<br/>more dissonant keys).  They do.  So when Kirnberger says one shouldn&apos;t<br/>transpose outside of the nearest quadrant of keys because of the change of<br/>meaning that it incurs, we should believe him.</p><p>Ibo: Why did he and others from the Bach-circle got involved into a<br/>Temperaturen-Streit and everyone failed to remark that W III was<br/>Bach&apos;s muscal temperament?</p><p>JR: It&apos;s more about people, and families, and pride.  Kirnberger could not<br/>mention it if Bach did not want to expose it baldly.  Bach would not write<br/>back to Mattheson in the same manner.  However, Bach did use the Werckmeister<br/>term &quot;Wohl-temperirt&quot; for his books of Preludes and Fugues.</p><p>There are a number of personal attacks that occur back then, some explained<br/>better than others.  Of particular interest to me is the one against J.G.<br/>Walther.  He phased out in Weimar under some kind of scandal, yet<br/>unexplained.  Marpurg bombed Kirnberger, even though Kirnberger got Marpurg<br/>his job at the Berlin lottery.  Even W.F. Bach tried to take Kirnberger&apos;s job<br/>from his at the end of their lives&mldr;because Friedemann was so desperate<br/>(alcoholic and impoverished).</p><p>Ibo: May be Bach wasn&apos;t that good a pedagogue?</p><p>&gt; spoke of quadrants of keys for which it was forbidden to<br/>&gt; transpose.</p><p>Quod licet Iovi non licet bovi</p><p>or what Kirnberger (and others past Bach) did, Bach can&apos;t be held<br/>responsible for.</p><p>JR: Exactly.</p><p>Ibo:  Transpositions C - &gt; C#, C - &gt; B-flat, F -&gt; A-flat<br/>What sentiments are so exactly defined and expressed in these keys?</p><p>JR: Much can be written here.  (I just noticed responses to e-mail from Paul<br/>I did not get.)  C-C# is a move to a huge difference in relationships, one<br/>that is bright and Christmassy to one that is Pythagorean in basis (great for<br/>the noble melody and with reams of tradition among central Europeans).</p><p>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Best</p><p>Ibo Ortgies</p></div><h3><a id=43427 href="#43427">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/19/2003 12:49:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi again,</p><p>&gt; JR: We satisfied all three conditions.</p><p>Ibo: To start with the last item: archival research and evaluation of<br/>contemporary source material has not been contributed until now from<br/>your side.

Besides, we were going for a<br/>sound that modern instrument could in fact give, and whose modern<br/>incarnations do not trip up what was possible with their ancestors.</p><p>Ibo: So what is the relevance of using this modern instrument - and in the<br/>Brandenburg Concerto 2 it plays an important role in the balance for<br/>the concertino in both outer movements.</p><p>&gt; and a modern oboe.</p><p>Ibo: Again, timbre etc. ? And ...</p><p>Actually, the balance was quite good with this trumpeter.  The oboist,<br/>likewise, had the right sense of appropriate balance as he is, himself, a<br/>specialist.

Many of the players last<br/>century had trouble playing in tune with their period replicas.  Leonhardt,<br/>for all the great things he has brought out, has some horrendous horn playing<br/>on some of the Cantatas that he approved for release.  Likewise, the<br/>trumpeter in Ton Koopman&apos;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto #2&quot; does not play in tune<br/>with the Werckmeister III tuning of the harpsichord of the well known<br/>Amsterdam recordings.</p><p>Ibo: In terms of instrumentation any possible relevance to Bach is<br/>therefore until know not sufficiently supported by your performances.<br/>And with the modern instruments you can&apos;t use historical playing<br/>techniques, sometimes already for reasons of mechanics: that<br/>prerequisite also is not fulfilled.</p><p>JR: Do you have any examples of this?  What is impossible for reasons of<br/>mechanics?  Which historical techniques couldn&apos;t I use?<br/>But again: I don&apos;t deny the artistic value as such in your approach.</p><p>...</p><p>&gt; JR: I believe there is information available from other sources</p><p>Ibo: Why do you only believe that?<br/>Don&apos;t you have evidence for your point that you &quot;reconstruct&quot; Bach&apos;s<br/>temperament practice? You announced even in subject line that you have<br/>evidence.</p><p>JR: The evidence of the choice of particular intervals for the opening<br/>subjects of famous pieces of music is evidence of Bach&apos;s consciousness of<br/>what he was doing.<br/>Of course, I can now match these up in WIII with all possible other WTs to<br/>see if the same intervals would be chosen.  In ET, this would be impossible<br/>as a pattern.</p><p>&gt; and you will have to be patient for me to outline it, or<br/>&gt; send it, or publish it, etc.</p><p>Ibo: I always can wait until evidence about the historical situation in<br/>BAch&apos;s time is published. Archival and source based work needs time<br/>and effort.</p><p>JR: I am curious, do you prefer the Bach &quot;Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D<br/>Minor&quot; in ET or Werckmeister III?  Have you ever heard the difference?  With<br/>Bach using the word &quot;chromatic&quot; only once in a title, this is evidence of<br/>interest by the composer in a chromatic circular tuning.  How could you<br/>possibly stuff up your ears to listen to this piece in ET when it is world&apos;s<br/>apart in WIII.<br/>Ibo: May be to the degree I sketched, if you work taking all<br/>&gt; available knowlegde and that is already a fiction for all of us.</p><p>&gt; JR: What is &quot;a fiction for all of us&quot;? Are you speaking here for<br/>&gt; someone else?</p><p>Ibo: Yes, to all those like me, who are more or less patiently waiting for<br/>the evidence, you announced.</p><p>JR:  There is no fiction, there is only the inability to see things in a<br/>different way.  It has to do with the strength of the imagination to believe<br/>that things might be done differently.  I admit it is an artistic ability,<br/>but it needn&apos;t be only pure speculation.  Missing the points that history<br/>might have provided makes a &quot;scientific&quot; history of the period less true than<br/>it might actually have been if the imagination could allow for input from new<br/>directions.  The use of opening intervals by Bach is significant evidence of<br/>Bach&apos;s choice of tunings and of his interests in transposition.  Performances<br/>offer different angles, more for checking things were possible than in<br/>determining what, in fact, was done.</p><p>&gt; And I am saying that he heard specific microtonal<br/>&gt; differences in melodic intervals which are identifiable<br/>&gt; in Werckmeister III.</p><p>Ibo: Sure, if he tuned his harpsichord, or unfretted Clavichord to W III<br/>(and then until the next day) and as practitioner, he would probably<br/>not touch up the instrument everyday<br/>The story of his tuning the instrument in 15 minutes is also not just<br/>taken literally. t doesn&apos;t say something about the event when tat is<br/>supposed to have happened, nothing about the quality of tuning, not<br/>even which type of temperament it could have been.<br/>The anecdote might even be an exaggeration, to call down Bach&apos;s<br/>authority in support of a later statement.</p><p>JR: Our harpsichordist does take 15 minutes to tune WIII for a concert.<br/>We&apos;ve seen it several times.  All the world over bowed to the Master&apos;s ear.<br/>&quot;No one could tune to his satisfaction&quot; crowed CPE Bach.  In fact, it is the<br/>natural consequence factor of WIII to meantone that allows for the speed.  8<br/>pure fifths are easiest to tune, and the 4 flatted fifths are the SAME<br/>flatted fifths (in terms of size) to the usual, traditional meantone fifths.<br/>Nothing is new to tune.</p><p>&gt; For the moment, I say &quot;forget the title &apos;Werckmeister III&apos;<br/>&gt; as the name of the tuning we have performed.&quot; What<br/>&gt; else can we call it so that it is not tied<br/>&gt; exclusively to one man.</p><p>Ibo: It doesn&apos;t matter - if we know and agree on what W III stands for we<br/>can use the name or abbreviation.</p><p>JR: I&apos;m not so sure.</p><p>&gt; I do believe it is a &quot;natural consequence&quot; of meantone. By<br/>&gt; this I mean, it&apos;s derived from the very same process of<br/>&gt; flattening pure fifths, but in this manner only 4 fifths<br/>&gt; need to be tuned a quarter comma flat. It is so logical</p><p>Ibo: to you</p><p>JR: Thank you.</p><p>&gt; that it is in actuality a &quot;pre-paper&quot; temperament.<br/>&gt; Werckmeister admits to this himself.</p><p>What does he admit? what are you referring to?</p><p>&gt; Ibo: If you find out that something works on a modern oboe,<br/>&gt; it might not be playable on the baroque oboe, and vice versa.</p><p>&gt; JR: Double reeds are my specialty. I am a virtuoso on the<br/>&gt; bassoon. The principles I work with are ancient principles.<br/>&gt; They are in some part transmitted through the centuries.<br/>&gt; The open hole principles of these winds are the basis for<br/>&gt; the addition of keys. Keys added to the oboe and bassoon<br/>&gt; are because of equal temperament. Really, it&apos;s true!</p><p>Ibo: Really? (The c#-Klappe was not invented for any temperament).</p><p>JR: The single key on an instrument, or even a second, are the exceptions<br/>that prove the rule of what I said.</p><p>Ibo: By the way, concerning traverse flutes: if W III or some similar<br/>temperament would have been used by free intonating instruments, why<br/>did Quantz invent the d#-Klappe to have both a e-flat and d# available<br/>on the flute? Let us remember that he and Bach&apos;s son CPE cooperated<br/>for years in the same ensemble (!) ath the court in Berlin.</p><p>JR: Quantz did not use Werckmeister III, regardless of who he knew and who<br/>his friends were.  It is clear enough from his writings.</p><p>&gt; The manipulation of the keys become quite clear when you<br/>&gt; move between the 2 tunings of meantone/just and ET.<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III, or this &quot;natural consequence of<br/>&gt; meantone&quot; is built into the wooden instruments.<br/>&gt; Really, it&apos;s true.</p><p>&gt;If fact, if I blow sharp on a bassoon reed with a thick spine, it<br/>&gt; goes into a pretty good Werckmeister III tuning.</p><p>Ibo: Pretty good is not good enough: According to the standards you have<br/>claimed, it means that you must constantly produce degrees of<br/>exactidude of 0.5 cents. How do you cope with the diffrences in<br/>temperature inside the tube, for example after a break of several<br/>minutes? And do you always have an measuring tool at hand for all<br/>players?</p><p>JR: Good enough to show the naturalness of WIII on bassoons!  Once the<br/>instrument is warmed up, it is essentially tuned to itself.  All the fine<br/>tunings on the instrument I do myself.  My embouchure can always accommodate<br/>whatever natural fluctuations chance puts before me in performance.  And<br/>there is also circular breathing for emergencies.  It is all relative, as I<br/>though you realized.  The bassoon has a &quot;resonance pocket&quot; for each musical<br/>tone, and this &quot;resonance pocket&quot; is free floating enough to position in<br/>pitch height, referenced to a tuning system.  Physical memory keeps the<br/>height relationships cogent, along with fingerings, and other detailed<br/>machinations.</p><p>&gt; of what<br/>&gt; we microtonally trained musicians can focus on a piece<br/>&gt; opens up new historical issues.</p><p>Ibo: Yes agreed, like your honorable performance of Bachs Brandenburg<br/>Concerto 2 is already a part of preformance history, though still<br/>rather new. Whether it might have to do with the history or<br/>historical situation of ca. 1720 is however always in question.</p><p>JR: This is true.  I am glad you finally came around to the above.</p><p>&gt; A recent example is the<br/>&gt; relationship between a tuning and its temp.<br/>&gt; Performance shows up that ET is played faster because there<br/>&gt; is nothing new to offer in sequences, a prominent element<br/>&gt; in Baroque writing.</p><p>Ibo: Again (see previous mail): why did Bach himself transpose organ pieces<br/>and harpsichord pieces if the sequence included where so important.</p><p>JR: Answered elsewhere, different post.</p><p>Ibo: And historically your arguent is not correct at all, since the playing<br/>of Baroque music in the 20th century unti now shows that the tendency<br/>to faster tempi has strongly grown by HIP practiced, which applies<br/>keyboard temperaments (also often Werckmeister or of course other<br/>historical models, even ET) in the continuo instruments.</p><p>JR: Historically only in the sense of the performances you just outlined.  I<br/>think they are wrong, HIP or no HIP.  When there are distinctions in the<br/>intervals the tempo might as well reflect it.  What is there to hide?  A<br/>dissonance is played harder, not lighter.  And the intonation is an after<br/>thought, not even mentioned directly in the liner notes.  It&apos;s more of an<br/>abstractions: hmn, the keyboard is in Werckmeister III&mldr;I wonder, do all the<br/>instruments do this, or only the harpsichord, or &mldr;?  Silly).</p><p>Ibo: It has probably not to do with temperament at all. As much as we can<br/>generalize, tempi in Quantz&apos; time (and until long into the 19th<br/>century) tended to be way faster than in the performance tradition of<br/>the 20th century. And as frequently stated, Quantz and oher important<br/>authors explain and ask for the as pure as possible intonation. (in<br/>many manuals you find explained the different ratios of natural<br/>intervals extensively)</p><p>JR: Tempo is an interesting topic here, though a bit a field.  Still, I read<br/>in Spitta somewhere about an organ auditioner for a job in Leipzig.  He was<br/>turned down for the &quot;dishonesty&quot; his speed engendered in the jury.  Any<br/>comments?</p><p>Re: Speed, there is always going to be, and always were, the macho players<br/>trying to impress.  Guys like Bach were above that for the most part.  It&apos;s<br/>like Miles Davis kickin&apos; a younger Wynton Marsallis off the stage.  Duels he<br/>flared up with swords between Handel and Mattheson&mldr;with Handel saved by a<br/>button!</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you have never heard my results, and I am right, where<br/>&gt; &gt; does that put my scepticism?</p><p>&gt; Ibo: The question is justified. I will answer it, as soon as you<br/>&gt; deliver inevitable proof, that your conclusions of the<br/>&gt; historical conditions as derived from your modern performances<br/>&gt; are &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>&gt; How exactly do you intend to find the missing information to<br/>&gt; integrate in your performances (maybe in the magnitude of 99%,<br/>&gt; since certainly most of historical sources on performannces and<br/>&gt; their circumstances are lost)?</p><p>&gt; JR: We are already incorporating a pool of early music people</p><p>Ibo: Why not for example with th oboe and the trumpet, etc.?</p><p>JR: I explained with the trumpet player: there is no current player who has<br/>mastered the tuning of WIII on a replica who was available to us.  The<br/>trumpet player already gets the high $300 for the performance.</p><p>You can ask Bram why he wanted to use the modern instrument.  I&apos;m sure you<br/>can find him.  Perhaps, once the trumpet was modern, the oboe might as well<br/>be.  For me an oboe is a conical bore treble instruments with holes in it for<br/>different pitches.</p><p>&gt; and virtuoso microtonalists to get pitch accurate<br/>&gt; performances. Considering that a period person of<br/>&gt; the Baroque could not hear recordings, sharp and hard<br/>&gt; listening would be advisable. Well, we do it. But<br/>&gt; you say that it proves nothing of<br/>&gt; the past. Except it does show what could be possible.</p><p>Ibo: Not with irrelevant modern instruments on which old playing techniques<br/>can&apos;t be explored.</p><p>JR: Where are your examples?  Which old playing techniques could not be<br/>explored?  Which?</p><p>&gt; Ibo: If I only think about much of the compositions from the 1960s,<br/>&gt; which included taped recordings. As soon as the plastic has<br/>&gt; corroded and the technology will not work anymore, the<br/>&gt; reconstruction work will begin. In one century from now,<br/>&gt; probably way earlier, you&apos;ll have the same situation for Kagel,<br/>&gt; Stockhausen, Berio and others. What will musicians make out<br/>&gt; their concepts, what material will musicologist still have to<br/>&gt; conclude from about such music.</p><p>&gt; It is fiction to think, that the composer&apos;s intention can be<br/>&gt; found back by performance.</p><p>&gt; JR: What about Jazz? Modern Jazz players use the grooves of<br/>&gt; LP&apos;s still to get their first hand knowledge of Bebop.<br/>&gt; Kagel, Stockhausen and Berio will do well to have great<br/>&gt; recordings of their music to go with their printed<br/>&gt; paper scores.</p><p>I didn&apos;t speak of just recordings of performances, but composition.</p><p>I said &quot;compositions from the 1960s, which included taped<br/>recordings&quot; and that means tape recordings as part of the performance<br/>(pieces for &quot;Chor und Tonband&quot; etc.)</p><p>Also of course electronical music which needs certain technical<br/>equipment, will be subject to the same aging process, because some<br/>techniques might not be reconstructable in an appropriate way in some<br/>decades (In computers we see the monkey race all the time, updating<br/>etc. - who can still read floppy disks?)</p><p>&gt; Ibo: What I questioned, how you could rely or check any of the<br/>&gt; sources or what others tell you about them, without being deeply<br/>&gt; rooted in German. How can you rely on translators, without<br/>&gt; double-checking? I definitely didn&apos;t want to insult, but I<br/>&gt; admit, that I didn&apos;t believe that you had any knowledge of<br/>&gt; German (and related languages), when I read your firm statements<br/>&gt; about alleged Dutch in Werckmeister and the too fast drawn<br/>&gt; conclusion from the wrong understanding of Mattheson&apos;s list of<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s publications, plus the Walther-readings.</p><p>&gt; JR: Yes, there was Dutch in Werckmeister. I saw it myself<br/>&gt; and it was not &quot;komma,&quot; etc.</p><p>Ibo:  Ok, which word used by Werckmeister was a Dutch word? And not one<br/>being used in German in his time - since it might have come into Dutch<br/>later.</p><p>JR: At the risk of embarrassment, it was something like &quot;schniptzel&quot;.  I will<br/>find it again, but not this week (4 concerts to produce this week, guitar and<br/>piano).</p><p>&gt; And what should be more infuriating is that Werckmeister and<br/>&gt; Mattheson have not been translated and made available. We<br/>&gt; should not feel obliged to trust secondary sources, even if<br/>&gt; these are scholars, or self-declared scientists.</p><p>Ibo: ...and not trust judgements from performance with instruments Bach<br/>didn&apos;t use, to be what Bach wanted or might have wanted, even if that<br/>is self-declared by the performers (unregarding their appreciated<br/>&quot;musical intelligence&quot;)</p><p>JR: What?  You are screwing this up.  The modern performance demonstrates<br/>what could have been possible in Bach&apos;s day.  What were we limited to by not<br/>having the museum pieces in our hands?<br/>]<br/>&gt;&gt; Music has more power when it is performed in the<br/>&gt;&gt; intonation that is intended by the composer.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: I agree - to the degree of our possible knowledge.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, this possible knowledge is way too scarce (for<br/>&gt; example regarding Bach).</p><p>&gt; JR: It&apos;s in Bach&apos;s paper intervals. If one can accept, for<br/>&gt; a moment-without sarcasm-that Bach intended Werckmeister III<br/>&gt; for the Brandenburgs (and maybe most all of his compositions),<br/>&gt; then the intervalic distinctions of the tuning would be<br/>&gt; manifest in the writing.</p><p>Ibo: No, not even then it is not, since the intervals written do not<br/>represent a temperament.</p><p>JR: I disagree.  The written intervals are indicative of a knowledge of a<br/>particular temperament&apos;s distinctiveness.</p><p>&gt; My idea: I picked up a paperback copy of the Bach Werke<br/>&gt; Verzeichnis in Amsterdam with the intention to analyze the<br/>&gt; opening melodic interval</p><p>Ibo: of which part or voice?<br/>If I think of the first movement of the Brandenb. Concerto 2, in which<br/>all instruments start at the same time, with four or five motives at<br/>the same time, all arund the F-major chord, what is &quot;the opening<br/>melodical interval&quot; in that?</p><p>JR: I see this as a falling perfect fourth of 498 cents, F-C, clear cut.</p><p>Ibo: And what about the intervals in the baroque trumpet (in F!) which you<br/>didn&apos;t have in your performance?</p><p>JR: This is a fiction.  You play Marpurg to my Kirnberger.</p><p>&gt; of each prominent work by Bach. All this to look for patterns<br/>&gt; in the usage of melodic intervals.</p><p>Ibo: For the Brandenburg Concerti that has been done (cf. also the recent<br/>study by Peter Schleuning)</p><p>JR: Let me guess, it was not done with a reference to Werckmeister III, but<br/>to something else, like ET?  Regardless, my interest is not in what is done,<br/>so I will be curious to see what Peter Schleuning has come up with.</p><p>&gt; My rationale is that because Bach is horizontal or melodic<br/>&gt; music,</p><p>Ibo: Bach was already in his time adressed as great harmonist, and his<br/>counterpoint is harmonically based. Another reason to apply &quot;harmonic<br/>intonation&quot; (as sketched by the 18th century sources..) to Bach and<br/>not a keyboard temperament concept.</p><p>JR: That is only true because of his circular temperament.  However, it is<br/>with his melodies that he begins his composition.  It is with his distinction<br/>of voices that he is renown.  It is with the independence of the voices that<br/>he is moving through a subject which is always melody first, harmony second.<br/>Bach is reputed to compose out of his head, not at an instrument.  He likely<br/>chose an opening interval even before he chose a key.  This is because there<br/>are several keys that one could choose to accommodate a particular interval,<br/>like say &quot;300 cents&quot; (which is a common interval to both WIII and ET).<br/>Bach&apos;s choice of opening melodic interval when seen from a microtonal<br/>perspective yields more knowledge about Bach&apos;s compositional process than<br/>here-to-fore discussed in the literature.</p><p>&gt; the opening melodic interval would have more importance<br/>&gt; in musically laying out the sentiment of<br/>&gt; the melody. With 39 distinct melodic intervals each 6 cents<br/>&gt; apart from its nearest neighbor,</p><p>Ibo: And still the question of transposition lurks in the back</p><p>JR: To alter the mood, to develop a sentiment, to change a personality&mldr;there<br/>are multiple reasons to transpose, including: technical concerns, personal<br/>favorites by players, enhancement of different instruments, a bid to create a<br/>new piece out of old, etc.</p><p>&gt; it is possible to determine which intervals are chosen and<br/>&gt; if there are patterns, based on the tablature nature of<br/>&gt; specifically notated intervals.</p><p>Ibo: Bach notated this in staff notation, and used tablature only seldom<br/>when running out of space.</p><p>JR: I mean tablature in the sense of putting one&apos;s fingers in a particular<br/>appointed place.  If we always tune from C and build WIII from here, then the<br/>opening interval of the first movement of Brandenburg Concerto #2 is always a<br/>falling perfect fourth of C to f.  How appropriate, is it not?  F Major is<br/>the most just of the keys of WIII.</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister III really aids in helping the<br/>&gt; audience&apos;s ear distinguish lines from each other.</p><p>Ibo: It is a matter of using the instruments of the time, has not to with<br/>temperament then.<br/>Since you use modern instruments in your performance you will get<br/>balance problems, and it may well be, that as much as you approach a<br/>rendering in Werckmeister III, it might help to overcome the balance<br/>problems. If creates good muic, why not.</p><p>JR: All who I know who have heard WIII closely hear the ability of the<br/>temperament to distinguish between the melodic lines that is the counterpoint<br/>of Bach.  Period instrument would help this further because of their likely<br/>pungent sounds.  Using modern instruments, it becomes even clearer that it is<br/>the temperament that does the heavy work in distinguishing the voices from<br/>each other.<br/>&Oslash; With Bach, the subject is stated with the opening interval<br/>&gt; setting the mood for the movement, independent of the<br/>&gt; key. For example, I was able to discover that The<br/>&gt; Well-Tempered Clavier Book II has half of its Preludes and<br/>&gt; Fugues using opening melodic intervals that were not used<br/>&gt; to open up movements from WTC Book I.</p><p>How do explain, that bach used in both collections (not &quot;cycles&quot;) many<br/>older compositions, transposed, reworked etc.</p><p>&gt; Previously I mentioned, that yes, Bach only opens a movement<br/>&gt; with a LARGE semitone of 108 cents.</p><p>Ibo: Some openings in WTC I which would have intervals smaller than 108<br/>cent (WIII)</p><p>PR-prelude<br/>FU-fugue</p><p>WTC I,<br/>c#-FU c# - b#<br/>E-flat-PR g - a-flat<br/>f-FU c - d-flat<br/>A-flat PR a-flat - g<br/>g#-FU g# - f##<br/>B-PR/FU b - a#</p><p>in WTC II it goes on wit ca. 5 or 6 prominent examples.</p><p>JR: You are right that there are different starting semitones in the WTC<br/>books one and two.  I was confused.  It is in the 6 Brandenburg Concerti that<br/>only 4 semitones are used in 4 different movement and that in each case it is<br/>the largest semitone of 108 cents.</p><p>&gt; That is what opens the second movement of<br/>&gt; Brandenburg #2, an A up to Bb. All the soloists play it<br/>&gt; in turn. There are three other semitones, but Bach<br/>&gt; does not choose them. In 4 different Brandenburgs there<br/>&gt; are 4 opening semitones, and each is-by virtue of the<br/>&gt; tablature (always starting the tuning on a C), the<br/>&gt; largest at 108 cents. And absolutely yes I can hear<br/>&gt; this&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; and sing it aloud right now&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;and you could<br/>&gt; check it.</p><p>Ibo: You can do the measuring, to bring proof.</p><p>JR: I already did the measuring in the concert.</p><p>&gt; And all of Bach&apos;s perfect fifths are not so perfect<br/>&gt; at 696 cents. Why? Because it<br/>&gt; is more melodically satisfying most likely.</p><p>Ibo: But the trumpet in BC 2, #3 opens with a fifth (sounding F-C) and<br/>according to your claim that Werckmeister III should not be transposed<br/>it should produce a Werckmeister C-G (as transposing instrument)</p><p>JR: An F trumpet will play the G in Werckmeister III tuning with the<br/>harpsichord and everyone else playing the same exact pitch.  Only in this way<br/>will everything really work.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and mix tunings because you have rationalized<br/>&gt; &gt; that no one knows, can make the differences, or really<br/>&gt; &gt; has the depth of research and insight that you do.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have found things in the music that is performed in<br/>&gt; &gt; Werckmeister III that sets it apart from paper tunings<br/>&gt; &gt; or later tunings.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: hmm - good argument!<br/>&gt; But correct me, if I&apos;m wrong: Wasn&apos;t Werckmeister III published<br/>&gt; in his time always on paper (and furtheron until the computer<br/>&gt; age)? Parchment wasn&apos;t used in his time anymore (may be one<br/>&gt; could find medieval &quot;parchment tunings&quot;!)</p><p>&gt; JR: Werckmeister claimed his chromatic tuning was already<br/>&gt; in practice.</p><p>Ibo: Amazing what people not do to sell their new products. But, on the<br/>contrary he complains and defends himself, ... Indon&apos;t need top repaet<br/>things over and over ...</p><p>JR: I think Werckmeister does this from humbleness.  Otherwise he would have<br/>given the tuning a definite name.</p><p>&gt; This<br/>&gt; tuning works with the instruments that were written for.</p><p>Ibo: So, if that is so, why don&apos;t you use such instruments? Like for<br/>example Kreeftmeijers baroque oboe.</p><p>JR: Please tell me, Ibo, what is so special about this baroque oboe?  Please<br/>fill me in.</p><p>&gt; A &quot;paper temperament&quot; might be something that looked good<br/>&gt; on paper but never received the necessary supporters.</p><p>Ibo: Ah, like W III in organ building -<br/>and Bach&apos;s famous Lorenz Mizler (in whose &quot;Soziet&auml;t&quot; Bach was a<br/>member) wrote that Werckmeister&apos;s temperament were a good try, but<br/>that Niedhardt improved the temperament greatly</p><p>JR: Mizler was generations away from Werckmeister.  Mizler&apos;s society was for<br/>the living.  Werckmeister as a person was an anachronism to him.  In his day,<br/>Werckmeiser was merely publishing for his own financial success (who can<br/>blame him) the tuning that was now plastered throughout Thuringia and the<br/>Harz region.  It was the Bachs who made the great music with it, after all.</p><p>&gt; Or worse, it would be so mathematically based and<br/>&gt; complex, that musicians could not make use of it.</p><p>&gt; Now, I know of your belief that keyboard temperament must<br/>&gt; not be confused with that of winds,</p><p>Ibo: No, you don&apos;t know my belief! This is only stated in the contemporary<br/>sources.</p><p>JR: Good.  Then I don&apos;t have to be concerned with your feelings when I say it<br/>is flat out wrong.  (sorry for the idiom)  The keyboards were intertwined<br/>with the winds and vice versa.  Decisions had to be made, like your organ<br/>decisions.  Even the harpsichordist doesn&apos;t want to retune the instrument all<br/>the time (it hurts the hand if done during a performance).</p><p>&gt; &gt; as a source of Bach&apos;s expectation that certain interval<br/>&gt; &gt; distinctions would appear between particular keys of<br/>&gt; &gt; the keyboard.</p><p>&gt; Ibo: And who knows and proves what expectation Bach exactly<br/>&gt; had in mind, as Bach didn&apos;t leave the tiniest hint on this?</p><p>&gt; JR: It&apos;s in Bach&apos;s paper intervals.</p><p>If you think that intervals &quot;express&quot; some meaning, ...<br/>(but, however, transposition by Bach himself ...)</p><p>JR: Yes.

Even today it is not difficult for most us to get a<br/>reading knowledge of Dutch - as well as the scandinavian languages -<br/>within a couple of months - if people only would do, to get to know<br/>each other better.  Anyway, getting to a passive reading knowledge of<br/>another language is usually much easier than to get an active<br/>knowledge - doesn&apos;t have to do with any travelling: I know many people<br/>who have learned another language without having had the possibilities<br/>of travelling (and of course vice versa: tourists who have no idea<br/>about the language, even less about culture of the countries they<br/>visit).   Low German, back then the standard every day language in<br/>most parts of Northern Germany (stretching from ca. Emden in the west<br/>  far east into the southern Baltic sea area) was still somewhat<br/>closer to Dutch, than it was today.</p><p>Dutch sources can&apos;t possibly have formed a problem for Werckmeister<br/>(also M.
