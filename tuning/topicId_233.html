Finale &gt; MIDI &gt; Csound with pitch values tweaked). The tuning crib would allow each<br/>singer to hear their own part played on a more nasal instrument and hear it simultaneously with<br/>the rest of the ensemble played on sine-tones. Its function was to teach them their cues and at<br/>the same time provide them with a working model of the desired pitches during rehearsals. I did<br/>this because I felt that an audio example is a more adequate way to convey my intentions than any<br/>new system of notation. I supplied each singer with their own tape but in future plan to provide<br/>a CD inside the back cover of the score.</p><p>The CD will also contain a pronunciation of the Sanskrit text which I&apos;ve used and which comes<br/>from a Catholic liturgy developed by a Benedictine monk Dom Bede Griffiths at an ashram in south<br/>India. I&apos;ve called the piece &apos;Vedic Mass&apos;. For Griffiths, truth was to be found in the meeting of<br/>opposites, the masculine and the feminine, the rational and the intuitive, the east and the west.<br/>The 7-limit tonality diamond with its meeting of chords major and minor became a musical<br/>manifestation of this idea.</p></div>
