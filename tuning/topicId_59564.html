That is needed to make more sense of the work.</p><p>I think the idea of the Earth Fragment before the Pulse of the Cosmos<br/>makes sense, but not simply because we are of the Earth, or this is a<br/>tutorial on how to listen to the symphony, although those are both<br/>valid explanations.  What I notice is at about one and a half minutes<br/>into wide valleys and clouds, there is an ascending scale in the<br/>piano, followed by the same scale descending in the piano.</p><p>This comes at pretty much near the exact midpoint of the 64:47.</p><p>I am also a great fan of the music of Alban Berg, and one thing noted,<br/>I believe, in the late Douglas Jarman&apos;s book is how Berg also puts<br/>some kind of palindromic element in his major pieces.  Either the<br/>palindrome is made out of the beginning and ending measures of the<br/>piece (as in the Violin Concerto), or occurs in the very center of the<br/>piece (as in Wozzeck, Chamber Concerto, Lyric Suite, Der Wein and<br/>Lulu).  In fact the very center of the interlude between the two<br/>scenes of the middle act of Lulu has a piano run that sounds exactly<br/>like the one in &quot;Universe.&quot;</p><p>Therefore, it strikes me there are at least several different<br/>organizational schemes going on in the piece simultaneously:</p><p>one from the Pulse of the Cosmos to Earth is of the Heavens, marked by<br/>a similar palindromic idea, the low bell at the beginning of one and<br/>the end of the other;</p><p>one from the Earth Fragment to the Earth is of the Heavens, not<br/>necessarily marked by any repeats of instrumentation or of themes, but<br/>purely of time alone; and</p><p>a third that&apos;s harder to define.</p><p>The third one relates to what Johnny said in the interview about the<br/>three orchestras occasionally coming together like an eclipse.  The<br/>Heavens, Cosmos and Earth (curiously, the same HCE used as a unifying<br/>element in Finnegans Wake; does it really stand for the same thing?)<br/>seem to not so much represent the sky, the atmosphere (or outer<br/>space), and the Earth, arranged in a straight line, but more like<br/>three planets or vectors arranged in a triangle.</p><p>We start off from Earth (movement I), then make a parabola shaped<br/>flight around the cosmos (with an apogee and perigee, as the pulse of<br/>the cosmos grows louder then recedes then grows louder then recedes)<br/>then to the heavens (with the same oval shaped orbit) in movement II.</p><p>In III, the parabola goes between Heaven and Earth.  The &quot;orbits&quot;<br/>become increasingly complex through IV, V, and VI.  Then in VII, the<br/>Earth and Heavens recede, the Cosmos draws closer, then recedes, as<br/>though we were being catapulted away from all three into deep space,<br/>represented by the silence after the last sound, a silence that<br/>technically is infinite in duration.</p><p>So we could say putting the Earth fragment beyond all else, represents<br/>a kind of complex one way flight, from the Earth, through the known<br/>universe (Heavens and Cosmos) to beyond.</p><p>I would disagree with the contention of Johnny&apos;s interviewer that this<br/>is music without harmony or any seeming melodic structure.  We<br/>obviously have gigantic sections recapitulated, such as the Heavens<br/>fragment and pulse of the cosmos, the recaps hidden under overlays of<br/>music from &quot;the other planets.&quot;  I also hear occasional traditional<br/>harmony.  I mentioned (and Johnny confirmed) the minor triad near the<br/>end of &quot;Birth of the Oceans&quot;; I&apos;m fairly sure I heard a IV-I cadence<br/>in brass in &quot;Earth is of the Heavens,&quot; as well as other simple<br/>harmonies in that section.</p><p>That section, to me, represents the understanding of order in the<br/>apparent chaos of what came before.  Once that is understood, we are<br/>ready to move to new worlds.</p><p>I understand Johnny&apos;s comparison of this with RBO (I recently found a<br/>nearly 30 year old cassette of mine of the Morton Gould version!).  In<br/>a less heterophonic way, we hear an independent percussion section in<br/>the Allegros against a dense counterpoint of virtually all the<br/>instruments (by the way, I always like the Faberman version, because<br/>it brings forward the clarinet in the Allegros, playing figures that<br/>sound very much like things from &quot;Universe&quot;).</p><p>Of course, Symphony #4 has to come in mind.  The Finale in some ways<br/>seems like (in the Bergian sense) a &quot;study&quot; for Universe, which the<br/>orchestra broken into three divisions quite similar to the three<br/>divisions of the Universe &quot;orchestra.&quot;</p><p>The last minute of the Finale sounds very much like a simpler version<br/>of the last minute of Universe: all the pitched instruments melt away,<br/>leaving the percussion moving in retrograde from how it began, with<br/>one last deep sound to the end piece.</p><p>Also, all the different melodic ideas going on simultaneously, taken<br/>individually, bear Ives&apos;s intervallic and rhythmic stamp of bits of<br/>pieces from everything from &quot;From the Steeples and the Mountains,&quot; to<br/>the woodwinds in &quot;Unanswered Question,&quot; to the layers of disjointed<br/>texture in &quot;Fourth of July&quot; and &quot;Hanover Square North.&quot;</p><p>To me, this sounds very much like the music of the man who composed<br/>Orchestral Set No. 1, and Symphony #4, and seems the logical third<br/>step in the progression from the first two.</p><p>Again, thank you, Johnny for your hard work as musicologist,<br/>conductor, and musician.</p><p>P.S. My cat listened attentively to this (last work he paid this much<br/>attention to was the Berg Violin Concerto), although he left during<br/>&quot;The Earth is of the Heavens.&quot;  I think he was hungry.  That&apos;s a cat<br/>for you.</p></div>
