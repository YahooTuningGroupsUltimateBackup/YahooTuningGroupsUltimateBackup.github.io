Your plaudits are greatly appreciated--especially when I&apos;m<br/>feeling a bit like I&apos;ve intruded into a domain where my concerns may not be<br/>widely shared.</p><p>&gt; It can be grueling and unpleasant<br/>&gt; for all who are reading, but such is to be expected in a difficult<br/>&gt; examination - over the Internet frontier.</p><p>Can you believe what is happening here? People from every corner of the<br/>globe are getting together nearly every day to discuss matters of mutual<br/>concern. Mind blowing!!!!!!</p><p>It is really interesting to me that the question I have raised here has<br/>become the &quot;Paul and Jerry Show.&quot; While Paul has at times appeared abrasive<br/>to some (including me, at times), he always accepts the criticism he<br/>provokes and goes on in a positive manner to discuss the issues as he sees<br/>them. I have learned to appreciate that trait and value his straightforward<br/>manner. While John Link is primarily responsible for my being here, and he<br/>and others have helped immensely to get me &quot;up to speed&quot; and into the<br/>conversation, it is Paul who has kept my own thinking from wandering into<br/>the fantasy of predetermined conclusions. Do you realize how valuable that<br/>is? I do, and I feel fortunate to be able to benefit from Paul&apos;s interest in<br/>exploring the &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Academia all too often ignores<br/>&gt; anything that might be a challenge to orthodoxy, and that has proved a<br/>&gt; serious problem to research and understanding.</p><p>Tell me about it! I get letters of praise and thankful appreciation<br/>regarding my book &quot;The Sounds of Music: Perception and Notation&quot; from the<br/>same college teachers who will not adopt it as a text because it is &quot;out of<br/>step&quot; with tradition. How frustrating!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I like about this list.  As we get to know each other, we<br/>&gt; recognize each other as people who are informed and who mean well, with<br/>&gt; faces!

This<br/>is not to say we won&apos;t continue to hammer out apparent differences or<br/>miscommunications. That&apos;s the way (if some haven&apos;t realized it yet) to<br/>_really_ get along. Just ask my wife of 46 years.</p><p>Johnny, your post is most timely and I&apos;m sure the members will take it to<br/>heart.
