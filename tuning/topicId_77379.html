Some of your fifths are 6 cents flat of a &quot;just&quot; third, and your thirds are either 16 cents sharp or 12 cents sharp, which will cause pronounced beating in any case. What exactly do you mean by &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;flawless&quot; harmony?<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt; When I was writing my book I detected several interesting frequency relations, besides the Natural Progression &gt;of Musical Cells containing 612 cells from C=1 to 2C=2.; one of its features is the following: If you take any cell &gt;and multiply it by 1,33333...... to produce a perfect fourth the product is another cell (twelve digits). Any other &gt;cell when multiplied by 1,5 to make a perfect fifth, the product is another cell. I can send you the six pages &gt;progression containing the cells 2(1/4), 2(1/2), 2(3/4) , (the fractions within parentheses are exponents); also &gt;contains all the tones of the heptatonic and extended scales of Pythagoras and Aristoxenus (21 tones per &gt;octave each extended set), but Tom Dent is of the opinion that it is not advisable to work with hundred of lines &gt;of data and probably most if not all of Yahoo tuning members are of the same opinion and I don&acute;t want to &gt;generate a compromise. However if one of the members suggest me to send the progression I will be pleased &gt;to do it.</p><p>&gt;The data contained in the progression allowed the detection of the K and P semitone factors, these being the &gt;most suitable for yielding aesthetic complex waves when the chord tone frequencies are computer-plotted and &gt;added to show perfect harmony. The data also allowed to develope the three variants of Piagui scales..</p><p>&gt;After examining the chord wave responses of major and minor Piagui and Tempered triads, the aesthetic and &gt;periodic views of Piagui graphs contrasted with the disordered and chaotic responses of all the Tempered &gt;printed responses so I called imperfect harmony to the combined or blended tone sounds of Tempered triads &gt;and &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;flawless harmony&quot;  to the ones produced by the Piagui scales (An expression that means that &gt;Piagui chords do not contain any level of failed harmony as showed by the printed graphs). I believe that this is &gt;happening. On the other hand, the tempered harmony is not a bad harmony but imperfect and sufficiently close &gt;to the Piagui harmony. That is why the Piagui tone frequencies are not far from the corresponding tempered &gt;ones.</p><p>Mike;</p><p>&gt;Your phrase: &quot;Some of your fifths are 6 cents flat of a &quot;just&quot; third, and your thirds are either 16 cents sharp or 12 &gt;cents sharp,&quot; I don&acute;t understand it sufficiently because I am Electronic Engineer that only got the basic knowledges &gt;on music; an old man (74).<br/>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Brad,</p><p>&gt;I will respond to your message in a matter of days. Before I need to be recovered; I had an accident in my &gt;apartment, meanwhile I tell you that I acknowledge that I misunderstood the terms in the article and really the &gt;correct understanding was not so easy to get directly. However, I already advanced with a deep analysis of it &gt;and found important errors that you will know promptly. The H row works with different parameters and wrong &gt;conditions. All the rows are incorrect and there is no match with any of the Piagui variants. Without doubt.</p><p>&gt;Regards</p><p>MARIO PIZARRO</p><p>ELECTRONIC ENGINEER</p><p>piagui@...</p></div><h3><a id=77383 href="#77383">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2008 12:46:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Mike;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Your phrase: &quot;Some of your fifths are 6 cents flat of a &quot;just&quot; third, and<br/>&gt;&gt; your thirds are either 16 cents sharp or 12 &gt;cents sharp,&quot; I don&acute;t<br/>&gt;&gt; understand it sufficiently because I am Electronic Engineer that only got<br/>&gt;&gt; the basic knowledges &gt;on music; an old man (74).</p><p>Well, a &quot;just&quot; third is made up of two frequencies in which one is 5/4<br/>of the other (1.25 * the other one).
