Did you see the corrected results? I<br/>presumed you did, because you mentioned that you were going to play with the<br/>10-tone scale . . .</p><p>&gt;&gt; Essentially, though, any small deviations from 12-tET, no matter how<br/>&gt;&gt;many notes are involved in the deviation, will increase discordance in<br/>&gt;&gt;some intervals more than they decrease discordance in other intervals.<br/>&gt;&gt;Not a big surprise if you&apos;ve ever tried to tune a piano.</p><p>&gt;Sorry, in this case I&apos;m afraid this is still a surprise to me!</p><p>Let&apos;s say fifths were all that mattered (not a bad approximation). Then<br/>you&apos;ve got 12 harmonic entropy curves, and for 12-tET, you&apos;re at a point<br/>about 2 cents to the left of the minimum on all 12 curves. Now in any other<br/>12-note tuning, you will move to the left on some and move to the right on<br/>others, the total amount of movement being zero. Since the curve is roughly<br/>parabolic around the 3:2, even all the way out to wolf-sized fifths, any<br/>movement to the left will increase your entropy more than the same amount of<br/>movement to the right decreases it. I can be more mathematical if you like.</p><p>Now if you don&apos;t ignore thirds, you might have a situation where, if you<br/>start out with an uneven scale, a coordinated deviation to the left of<br/>adjacent fifths gives you enough good thirds that you&apos;re in a local minimum<br/>of discordance. That may be what was happening with that well-temperament --<br/>though it&apos;s not stable enough to survive the theoretically innocuous<br/>operation of using different modes. I suspect what&apos;s happening is that the<br/>basin around that well-temperament is so small that the program, which is<br/>really just looking for _any_ local minimum, will, in its search, sometimes<br/>jump out of that basin and into the deeper 12-tET one. I&apos;ll see if I use<br/>other optimization methods to gain insight into this issue.</p><p>&gt;Yes, I understand this. If you have it handy and you don&apos;t mind, what<br/>&gt;would be the first multiply weighted, or rounded, nine and eleven?</p><p>OK -- here&apos;s what I get when I start with the other ETs:</p><p>9: 0 109 189 422 499 608 812 812 997  (8 notes)<br/>11: 0 124 213 298 417 610 609 712 917 917 1109   (9 notes)<br/>13: 0 102.5 198 306 390 506 596 698 698 894 1007 1007 1091 (11 notes)</p><p>There you go!</p></div><h3>Paul H.
