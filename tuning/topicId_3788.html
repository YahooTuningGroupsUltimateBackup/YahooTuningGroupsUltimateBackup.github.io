I&apos;ve been having fun learning about<br/>dieses I always wondered what they were good for. :-)</p><p>      E#  Cb<br/>    C#  G#<br/>  A   E<br/>    C   G<br/>  Ab  Eb<br/>E#  Cb</p><p>dBddBdddBd</p><p>So far I&apos;ve found that this 10-note 10-triad scale only exists in 19-tET,<br/>22-tET, 41-tET and other (much larger) N-tETs where N = 3B + 7d, d &gt; 0, 4d<br/>&lt;= B &lt;= 5d.</p><p>I&apos;ve &quot;discovered&quot; diesis-pump chord sequences, analogous to the comma-pump<br/>sequences we talked about earlier in regard to adaptive <a href="http://JI.In">JI.In</a> this case the<br/>root of one chord becomes the major third of the next or vice versa.</p><p>For example, I quite like this one: C, Ab, Fb, Dbb (all major triads). In<br/>12-tET this is just C, Ab, E, C but in 19-tET it is C, Ab, Fb(=E#), C#.<br/>i.e. it finishes a whole 63c semitone higher than it started, and can then<br/>resolve back to C. Lovely.</p><p>If you want to try it, here&apos;s a keyboard mapping with offsets in cents from<br/>12-tET:</p><p>19-tET<br/>Note  Where   Ideal   Usable<br/>name  on kbd  offset  offset<br/>----------------------------<br/>C     C       -40     -46<br/>C#    C#      -82     -64<br/>Eb    D       +82     +63<br/>E     D#      +40     +46<br/>E#    E        -1      +5<br/>F     F       -43     -49<br/>G     F#      +62     +56<br/>G#    G       +21     +27<br/>Ab    G#      -21     -27<br/>A     A       -62     -56<br/>B     A#      +43     +49<br/>Cb    B        +1      -5</p><p>The F and B (on the A# key) are not part of the decatonic scale but allow<br/>it to be modulated up or down by one major third. The &quot;ideal&quot; offsets are<br/>based on 41-tET where the fifths have about a 0.5c error and the thirds<br/>about 6c. The &quot;usable&quot; offsets let you acheive a tolerable approximation if<br/>you are using a tuning table that can only do a -64 to +63c offset (like I<br/>am).</p><p>With the above keyboard mapping, the above-mentioned diesis pump (plus<br/>reloution) can be rendered in four voices as:</p><p>F# G# G# G  F#<br/>D# D  E  E  D#<br/>C  C  B  C# C</p><p>C  G# E  C# C    root bass</p><p>Note: these are the keys you play, not the actual notes that sound.</p><p>I had to phone my brother, who can work out cord progressions by ear in a<br/>flash, and play him this one. :-) I told him it started and ended on a C<br/>chord since he doesn&apos;t have absolute pitch. After listening, he had me<br/>confirm that it ended on the same chord it started on. He then guessed it<br/>started C, G# and ended C#, C but the chord in the middle (call it X) had<br/>him stumped. Presumably because he could hear that there was a sustained<br/>note from the G# triad to X and another from X to the C# triad, but X was<br/>clearly a major triad. Impossible in 12-tET (and many others).</p><p>Remember that Moodie Blues album &quot;Search for the lost chord&quot;. :-)</p><p>I eventually put him out of his misery by telling him that X was &quot;half way<br/>between an E and an F chord&quot; and that the G# and C# were shifted a little<br/>too, to distribute the &quot;stretch&quot;. But really, this is closer to Just. It&apos;s<br/>12-tET that&apos;s &quot;compressed&quot;.</p><p>Surely someone&apos;s investigated these scales and these chord sequences before?</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
