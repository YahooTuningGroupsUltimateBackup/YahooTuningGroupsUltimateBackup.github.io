But I gather that there are two parts to the question:</p><p>1. How much tuning resolution can the synth address -- how much does it even attempt to produce?</p><p>2. How closely does the sound played actually match the note the synth is trying to play.</p><p>To answer the first part, you&apos;ve got to decide how you want to send the tuning information to the synth -- pitch bend or sysex?  Pitch bend works on all synths, and the resolution is potentially very great, but most synths ignore at least some of the pitch bend resolution.  I don&apos;t know which ones are good at this.  Usually, working with pitch bends is awkward -- to my knowledge, all the musicians who have successfully used pitch bends for tuning have controlled their synth from a PC, using software they wrote.</p><p>The far more popular and easier option is sysex.  To find out about the sysex tuning capability of a synth, I always consult the microtonal synthesis web site...</p><p><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a></p><p>The two most flexible designs are the Kurzweil K2000/K2500/K2600, and the Emu Audity 2000 / Proteus 2000.  The Kurzweil units accept tuning data in 1-cent increments, and the Emu units accept data in 1.56-cent increments.</p><p>Then there is Kyma, from Symbolic Sound.  It requires a PC, and costs about $3300 for an entry unit.  It allows arbitrary precision of tuning data.</p><p>Answering the second part is more tricky.  There was a discussion here a while back about wavetable synths delivering poor and inconsistent accuracy.  I wasn&apos;t involved in this discussion, so I can&apos;t tell you much about it.  But to my knowledge, the most accurate synth as far as producing what it&apos;s trying to produce (that&apos;s the second part), is again Kyma.  Supposedly, it&apos;s never off by more than 0.0026Hz.</p><p>&gt;And even more reluctant to get into &quot;log-accuracy.&quot; The phrase &quot;over<br/>&gt;my head&quot; comes to mind.</p><p>Well, cents are a logarithmic measure of frequency.  You know, to add two ratios (like 5/4 and 5/3) you multiply them (25/12).  But to add to intervals in cents (386 and 884), you add them (1270).  Deal is, if a synth is off by 1 cent, that could be 0.064 hertz at A=110, or it could be 1.017 hertz at A=1760.  So if you&apos;re mis-tuning a just ratio way down low in the frequency range by 1 cent, you&apos;ll have to listen much longer to hear a beat than you would mistuning by 1 cent in the upper range.  If a synth was off by a certain number of hertz, that would be many cents down low, but few cents up high.  Most synths are accurate in cents as far as what they&apos;re trying to do (first part), and in hertz as far as what they&apos;re actually doing (second part).  Follow?</p><p>&gt;May I assume that your input here, Carl, is to improve my faulty concept<br/>&gt;(which it does) of the limitations of MIDI and not to stifle my complaints<br/>&gt;about the inadequacy of 100 cent increments to match what the ear can hear?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure.  Keep in mind that 100-cent increments is 12tET.  I took you to mean 1-cent increments.  When tuning notes of the same timbre, in the most sensitive range of the ear, differences of less than a cent in a harmony can be heard, as piano tuners prove every day.  But to hear mistuning at this level requires a trained ear, and careful listening.  In a musical situation, such small mistunings come across as a _subtle_ change in timbre.  Nevertheless, it is one which piano lovers and audiophiles can hear -- it has been said that a good tuning &quot;brings the piano to life&quot;.  I would encourage you to discover exactly what the accuracy of the synth is question was, and to qualify your statements by answering questions like,</p><p>What type of music was I listening to?<br/>What limit was the harmony?<br/>What timbre was being used?<br/>How did the mis-tuning sound to me?<br/>Was this a blind test?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
