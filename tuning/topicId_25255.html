Midiconv puts the pitch bends at the<br/>beginning of each note, according to the values specified in the tuning<br/>file. The pitch bend is assumed to be set to plus or minus 2 semitones. So<br/>in effect, each semitone is divided into 4,096 steps of 0.0244 cents.<br/>That&apos;s fine enough resolution in theory, but individual MIDI devices such<br/>as PC sound cards may actually have much coarser resolution.</p></div><h3><a id=25279 href="#25279">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2001 10:12:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 17 Jun 2001 07:16:22 -0000, <a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;The warped canons are the best meantone comparo ever.

It&apos;s obviouly a<br/>&gt;powerful tool... you&apos;ll be quite busy around here if you&apos;re the<br/>&gt;only one who knows how to use it!</p><p>The easiest way is just to list the pitches of the notes as fractions of an<br/>octave. That&apos;s the way I usually use the tuning files. For example:</p><p>! 12 from Chopi 7-note xylophone scale<br/>notes 12<br/> 0  0.0<br/> 1  0.1516<br/> 2  0.1516<br/> 3  0.292<br/> 4  0.292<br/> 5  0.444<br/> 6  0.589<br/> 7  0.589<br/> 8  0.729<br/> 9  0.729<br/>10  0.87<br/>11  0.87<br/>12  1.005</p><p>The only reason I used 12 notes in that tuning file is that the input MIDI<br/>file is in 12-TET. The final note gives the size of the octave. I made an<br/>approximation of the Chopi xylophone scale that averaged out some of the<br/>differences between the octaves so that I could repeat it and extend it<br/>over the range of MIDI input.</p><p>For most of the canons, to save time, I used the &quot;coords&quot; feature to<br/>specify the size of three intervals (the octave, fifth, and third) and<br/>define each of the pitches in the scale based on these intervals. For<br/>example, the note D is an octave down and two fifths up, so its line reads<br/>&quot;-1 2 0&quot; (-1 octave, +2 fifths, +0 thirds). Here&apos;s a repeat of that 15TET<br/>tuning file I posted earlier:</p><p>! 12 from 15TET<br/>coords 3<br/>octave 1.0<br/>fifth  0.6<br/>third  0.333333333<br/>notes 12<br/> 0  0  0  0  !

One of the most curious things is that my<br/>Siamese cat, who generally ignores music altogether, seems to LOVE the Canon in 10 ED2!  When I play<br/>it, she comes from anywhere in the house to sit in my lap at the computer until it&apos;s done.  Then she<br/>goes back to the window sill, or whatever she was up to at the moment.

I have a few thoughts on the topic, especially as<br/>it relates to the rendering in 88CET.</p><p>First of all, that&apos;s a nice web page for comparing various tunings.  I think the best part is its<br/>comprehensiveness with respect to the large number of tunings it compares.  Good work, Herman!</p><p>I&apos;m not so sure about the usage of 88CET, though.  He took an intriguing approach, and the results<br/>are interesting, but I&apos;m not sure how successful to think it turned out.  Or more accurately, I<br/>think his solution to the concept of proportionally mapping traditional harmony and melody<br/>simultaneously to 88CET seems reasonable, but I have to wonder how realistic a concept that is in<br/>the first place.  As I understand it, Herman drew an analogy between 5:2 and the octave.  He then<br/>found chords spanning that 5:2 that are roughly proportionally spaced to the usual major chord.<br/>Later did roughly the same with 7:4.  Not surprisingly, the harmonies end up sounding very alien.</p><p>I certainly don&apos;t have anything against alien harmony, but I find that such alien harmonies need<br/>to be carefully selected, rather than being constrained by an existing score.  Also, when most of<br/>the links on that web page lead to comparatively subtle variations on a theme (literally and<br/>figuratively), the entirely alien harmony could turn some people off.  Now, I have found that that<br/>approach works for melody alone, but with harmony, the results can get rather horrendous very<br/>quickly.</p><p>There may be a more meaningful solution, although it would take more work.</p><p>Amazingly enough (it surprised me anyway), it is possible to render a fair approximation to<br/>traditional harmony in 88CET, provided that you can control the vertical voicing of each chord.<br/>That is perhaps outside of the intent of this web page, that intent probably being to hear how<br/>varying only the tuning system, without changing the music itself, affects the music.  Still, if<br/>we are allowed to choose the voicing of the chords, you can produce traditional triadic and<br/>seventh-chord harmonies in 88CET.  The trick being to take advantage of the 4:6:7:10 structure,<br/>and then let tendency tones resolve in the traditional manner.  You end up with a wandering tonic<br/>in many cases, and some of the chords using supramajor thirds instead of major, or subminor<br/>instead of minor.  Still, as strange as the results sound, they do pretty much present the same<br/>sensation to listeners as the traditional harmony.  I&apos;ve even managed to pull off chromatically<br/>altered chords, like Neapolitans.</p><p>The really wild part of this sort of harmonization is that it&apos;s entirely relative to previous<br/>harmony.  In traditional 12-toned harmony, if the melody you&apos;re trying to harmonize contains an E<br/>in the key of C major, you know that it&apos;s scale degree 3, and thus you immediately know what the<br/>possible traditional harmonizations are for it.  In this sort of traditional harmonization in<br/>88CET though, how that pitch is interpreted is entirely dependent upon the chords before it.<br/>Because of the wandering tonics, a given pitch could end up producing the sensation and function<br/>of scale degree 4 as easily as scale-degree 3.

He took an<br/>&gt; intriguing approach, and the results are interesting, but I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure how successful to think it turned out.  Or more accurately,<br/>&gt; I think his solution to the concept of proportionally mapping<br/>&gt; traditional harmony and melody simultaneously to 88CET seems<br/>&gt; reasonable, but I have to wonder how realistic a concept that<br/>&gt; is in the first place.  As I understand it, Herman drew an<br/>&gt; analogy between 5:2 and the octave.  He then found chords<br/>&gt; spanning that 5:2 that are roughly proportionally spaced to the<br/>&gt; usual major chord.  Later did roughly the same with 7:4.  Not<br/>&gt; surprisingly, the harmonies end up sounding very alien.</p><p>Herman specifies the tunings for the canons by tuning approximate<br/>4:5:6:8&apos;s in the score to something else.  In the first 88CET<br/>version, he chose a subharmonic 4:6:7:10 chord.  For the second<br/>version he used a harmonic 4:6:7:10 chord.  For the 7:4 version,<br/>the chord was 36:44:54:63.  Your summary is basically correct,<br/>except Herman didn&apos;t stretch and contract the triad proportionally<br/>with the octave, he just tried to find consonant intervals to<br/>map triads to.  With the tool he&apos;s using to make these midi files,<br/>I can&apos;t think of a better approach.</p><p>&gt; Amazingly enough (it surprised me anyway), it is possible to render<br/>&gt; a fair approximation to traditional harmony in 88CET, provided that<br/>&gt; you can control the vertical voicing of each chord.</p><p>This makes sense, but I don&apos;t think midiconv can do it.</p><p>&gt; The really wild part of this sort of harmonization is that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; entirely relative to previous harmony.  In traditional 12-toned<br/>&gt; harmony, if the melody you&apos;re trying to harmonize contains an E<br/>&gt; in the key of C major, you know that it&apos;s scale degree 3, and<br/>&gt; thus you immediately know what the possible traditional<br/>&gt; harmonizations are for it.  In this sort of traditional<br/>&gt; harmonization in 88CET though, how that pitch is interpreted is<br/>&gt; entirely dependent upon the chords before it.  Because of the<br/>&gt; wandering tonics, a given pitch could end up producing the<br/>&gt; sensation and function of scale degree 4 as easily as scale-degree<br/>&gt; 3.  You can&apos;t tell until you flesh out the harmony leading up to<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>Sounds like somebody would be able to produce a pretty rippin&apos;<br/>warped canon!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
