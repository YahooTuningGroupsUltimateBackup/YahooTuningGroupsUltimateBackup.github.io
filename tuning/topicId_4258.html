That the western music tradition &quot;allows&quot; these  variation is to its<br/>benefit. This expressiveness has produced some of the most varied music<br/>possible. In this case, the subconscious shifts built up over hundreds  of years<br/>makes 12 one of  the best ETs. Any other might lack this accumulated experience.<br/>The two 31 tone violinist in Holland might prove this wrong and  this<br/>&quot;experience&quot; might be easily transferred. In performance, despite the meantone<br/>2nds, they would adjust  to a 9/8 when the context called for it.<br/>    On the other hand this tolerance of variation has pushed others ears (even<br/>some famous string players whose name need not be named) to wander so far off<br/>that I for one lose track of where they are. This occurs frequently enough in<br/>the concert halls or recordings that it&apos;s acceptance, I find bewildering. Even<br/>in String Quartets,  this same type of confusion occurs, possibly in part due to<br/>an ambiguous nature in the passage itself.<br/>    Any string player who did not raise his leading tones would probably be<br/>fired.

So 1074 cents is not a<br/>leading tone?
