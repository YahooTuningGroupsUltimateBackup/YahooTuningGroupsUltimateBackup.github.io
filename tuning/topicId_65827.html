Don&apos;t tune to a pitchfork A or any other note above your range. Have them give you a pitch in the range where you are going to play (assuming it _is_ low), and because of the piano&apos;s stretched octaves all will be right.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2006 1:58:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Lilyana,</p><p>It seems to me that if it&apos;s really badly flat when it&apos;s pushed all the<br/>way in, maybe just a different mouthpiece (or reed? to make it easier<br/>to lip up?) could make a significant difference.  *But I&apos;m not an<br/>expert*.  I struggled with a bassett horn (tenor clarinet) for months,<br/>and mouthpieces made a lot of difference, both in intonation AND<br/>playability.
