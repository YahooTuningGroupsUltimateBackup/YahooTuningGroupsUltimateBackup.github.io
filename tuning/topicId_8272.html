Tests have shown that these<br/>&gt; categorical intervals are bounded at around 50&#xFFFD; above and below the 12-tET<br/>&gt; intervals, except for the unison-semitone boundary, which is about 25&#xFFFD; above<br/>&gt; and below the unison. In other words, the fact that you heard John&apos;s chord<br/>&gt; out of context means that your ear/brain most likely perceived the 435&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt; interval as falling into the &quot;major third&quot; category; meanwhile, Joe Monzo&apos;s<br/>&gt; example started with the 386&#xFFFD; interval, which you heard as a major third;<br/>&gt; then the upper voice of the major third ascended by small intervals, ending<br/>&gt; up 49&#xFFFD; higher -- enough higher so that, categorically speaking, it sounded<br/>&gt; like it had climbed a semitone -- hence the &quot;fourth&quot; perception.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe says he&apos;s created a MIDI file where a sus chord &quot;resolves&quot; down to a<br/>&gt; 14:18:21 -- maybe he can e-mail it to a few of us -- I&apos;m willing to bet that<br/>&gt; in this context, you&apos;ll hear the latter chord as a definite (but dissonant)<br/>&gt; major chord, though it&apos;s exactly the same chord you heard at the end of<br/>&gt; Joe&apos;s other MIDI file. It&apos;s much like the situation where, with two<br/>&gt; identical regions of exactly the same color, one surrounded by white and the<br/>&gt; other surrounded by black, the first appears much darker than the second.</p><p>After being seduced for a considerable time by the home page music on Joe&apos;s<br/>web site, I went for the attachment and heard the file. (Thanks, Joe. I&apos;m<br/>going to get back to your site and spend some time listening.)</p><p>I certainly do see (read: &quot;hear&quot;) your point, Paul. And I fully understand<br/>the human tendency to reshape experiences to fit existing concepts. Without<br/>this phenomenon we would need to store an incredible number of concepts for<br/>any simple more-or-less repeatable event. And it makes sense that when an<br/>experience borders on two interpretations, context will very likely play a<br/>part in pushing the perception one way or the other. Joe&apos;s illustration<br/>demonstrates that convincingly.</p><p>My point in this regard is only that John&apos;s guitar chord was played without<br/>establishing _any_ context. It was simply a chord. My instant take on it was<br/>that it was a well-tuned major triad. The fact that Joe&apos;s sliding &quot;third&quot;<br/>gave the impression of changing the perceptual concept to a sus chord by<br/>introducing a contrast (your &quot;black and white&quot; above) does not really apply.<br/>The impression (suggestion) of a sus chord occurred when Joe supplied a<br/>context--but not when the isolated chord was played by itself.</p><p>While this trip has been most interesting and informative, I&apos;m not sure<br/>where it lands us in regard to the central questions about what the &quot;high<br/>third&quot; is and why it is &quot;preferred&quot; under certain circumstances. I agree<br/>with you that the chord Joe &quot;arrived at&quot; in both contexts is not<br/>particularly agreeable.</p><p>Onward,</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8281 href="#8281">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

That&apos;s what I was trying to say!</p><p>&gt;I agree<br/>&gt;with you that the chord Joe &quot;arrived at&quot; in both contexts is not<br/>&gt;particularly agreeable.</p><p>[For those playing along, that was a reference to the last chord in the MIDI<br/>file Joe previously uploaded and a new version he sent us privately, in<br/>which a sus chord resolves to a 14:18:21 at the end].</p><p>Now, does that chord sound the same to you as the one Christopher Chapman<br/>posted? It should if it&apos;s a 14:18:21.</p></div><h3><a id=8293 href="#8293">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2000 10:24:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Jerry Eskelin, TD 518.7]<br/>&gt; The fact that Joe&apos;s sliding &quot;third&quot; gave the impression of<br/>&gt; changing the perceptual concept to a sus chord by introducing<br/>&gt; a contrast (your &quot;black and white&quot; above) does not really apply.</p><p>It may not apply in comparison to hearing John Link play *only*<br/>the 14:18:21 chord to you over the phone, but it certainly<br/>applies in comparison to your original description of your<br/>vocal experiment.</p><p>I crafted my MIDI-file precisely according to your description<br/>of singing a 4:5 &apos;major 3rd&apos; dyad, then adding the &apos;5th&apos; (to<br/>make it a 4:5:6 triad), and hearing the &apos;3rd&apos; slide upward in<br/>pitch until it reaches the unknown-quantity &apos;high 3rd&apos;.</p><p>To my ears, the ones that sound best are the ones that slide<br/>upward to the 2^(4/12) [i.e., 12-eq &apos;3rd&apos;] and the 19:24.</p><p>I think Paul&apos;s description of how one&apos;s perception of one<br/>particular color changes, depending on whether it is surrounded<br/>by black or white, is entirely apt in describing what happens<br/>when we hear the 7:9 &apos;high 3rd&apos; in context of upward or downward<br/>resolution.  As he and I have both said *many* times, context<br/>is everything.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; I agree with you [Paul] that the chord Joe &quot;arrived at&quot; in<br/>&gt; both contexts [14:18:21] is not particularly agreeable.</p><p>And I agree too - along with Paul, I&apos;ve never been really<br/>fond of the sound of this chord.  But this is the one with<br/>the infamous 7:9 that you thought was your &apos;high 3rd&apos;.</p><p>But don&apos;t forget that Paul has shown how this chord can<br/>sound fine in other contexts, and certainly there is music<br/>I&apos;ve heard which makes wonderful use of it - I&apos;m thinking<br/>particularly of pieces by La Monte Young, David Beardsley,<br/>Pat Pagano, Kraig Grady, and of course Harry Partch.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
