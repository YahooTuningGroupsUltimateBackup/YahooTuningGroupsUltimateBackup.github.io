Under the right coding<br/>procedure, the knots could be made to represent melodies. There is<br/>probably a way to code the orbits so that every possible melody line (up<br/>to rhythm) is represented. Perhaps also every possible harmonization<br/>(again mod rhythm) via a coding of the links.</p><p>I would think that this would not bode well for the usability<br/>of Chua&apos;s circuit in musical applications. After all, random numbers,<br/>the digits of pi, many things will give you &quot;all possible sequences&quot;<br/>(translate into &quot;all possible melodies&quot; at your own risk).<br/>The trouble is that only some sequences of tones make musical sense...</p><p>bill sethares</p></div>
