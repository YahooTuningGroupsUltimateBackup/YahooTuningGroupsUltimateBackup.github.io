For example, if the interval between<br/>&gt; two adjacent tones in a chord is on the order of,<br/>&gt; say, 3 to 4 octaves (especially in a two-note chord),<br/>&gt; the two pitches start to become so distant that they<br/>&gt; hardly interact with each other at all.  I would take<br/>&gt; that to default to sounding consonant, or at least not<br/>&gt; dissonant.</p><p>Interesting that you should say that, with the discussion<br/>of Schoenberg that&apos;s been going on.  Towards the end<br/>of his _Harmonielehre_, he justifies a chord which he<br/>used in his great monodrama &quot;Erwartung&quot;, which has 11<br/>different notes, by pointing out the wide spacing he<br/>used, which allowed him to emulate the the overtone series<br/>above a fundamental, putting some of the more dissonant<br/>tones where higher harmonics would go, and to soften<br/>the dissonance (his words).</p><p>- Monzo<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/1999 11:34:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; if the interval between<br/>&gt; &gt; two adjacent tones in a chord is on the order of,<br/>&gt; &gt; say, 3 to 4 octaves (especially in a two-note chord),<br/>&gt; &gt; the two pitches start to become so distant that they<br/>&gt; &gt; hardly interact with each other at all.<br/>&gt; Towards the end<br/>&gt; of his _Harmonielehre_, he justifies a chord which he<br/>&gt; used in his great monodrama &quot;Erwartung&quot;, which has 11<br/>&gt; different notes, by pointing out the wide spacing he<br/>&gt; used, which allowed him to emulate the the overtone series<br/>&gt; above a fundamental,</p><p>   Clearly of course no two adjacent pitches in the harmonic series are<br/>anything like 3-4 octaves apart, and also an 11-note chord is a different<br/>animal from a comparatively sparse two-note chord I mentioned as an extreme<br/>example.</p><p>&gt; putting some of the more dissonant<br/>&gt; tones where higher harmonics would go, and to soften<br/>&gt; the dissonance (his words).</p><p>   I suppose that more or less jives with what I suggested:  More dissonant<br/>harmonies can be made less freaky-sounding by weakening their interactions<br/>with other notes by placing them in widely-distant pitch ranges from one<br/>another.</p></div>
