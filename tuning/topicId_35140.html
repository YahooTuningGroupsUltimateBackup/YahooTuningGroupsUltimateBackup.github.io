This will make at least two other people in the world<br/>happy which makes me feel happy. I&apos;ll get the mp3 up soon and I&apos;ll<br/>notate it using the notation I use and the one that George Secor has<br/>proposed for comparison. I suppose then that discussion could ensue on<br/>the easiest to sightread which seems to me to be a good starting point.</p><p><a href="http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3/LateWinter.jpg">http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3/LateWinter.jpg</a></p><p>A luxury cruise for two in the South China Sea if you can guess when it<br/>was written.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
