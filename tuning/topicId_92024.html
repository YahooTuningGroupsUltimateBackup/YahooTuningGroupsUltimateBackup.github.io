To use your example, the<br/>meantone map vanishes 81/80 by making four 3:2s equal to<br/>one 5:4 (ignoring octaves for a moment).</p><p>Now, you can make that &quot;3:2&quot; be any size and the &quot;5:4&quot; will<br/>come out accordingly.  That&apos;s the tuning.  It only depends<br/>on your tolerance or desires.  You can call 320 cents the<br/>&quot;3:2&quot; and get a 1280-cent &quot;5:4&quot; if you want.  Probably we<br/>should have a rule to punish people who do things like this<br/>but I&apos;m not aware of anyone proposing such a rule.</p><p>One thing that has been proposed is that we should not carry<br/>on stacking generators if a better approximation to the<br/>target appears (other than the one the map tells you to use).<br/>In my last example, 320 cents is itself a better approximation<br/>to 5:4 than 1280 cents (or 80 cents if we have octaves) so we<br/>wouldn&apos;t be able to stack even a single generator without<br/>breaking the rule.</p><p>Herman Miller made this proposal and he may be able to tell<br/>you more about it.  The idea is, the larger the scale that<br/>can be constructed without &apos;invalidating&apos; the map, the better<br/>the map (in a sense).  Herman: did you compute this number<br/>for popular temperaments (I forget)?</p><p>&gt; Also, does every comma that could be made to vanish in a<br/>&gt; temperament imply a unique generator range?  For instance,<br/>&gt; could you vanish 81/80 without using a flattened 3/2 or<br/>&gt; a sharpened 4/3 as a generator?</p><p>Good question.  It depends on the number of primes being<br/>mapped and the rank of the temperament produced.  In meantone<br/>we are usually mapping the 5-limit down to a rank 2 (2-D)<br/>system.  The 5-limit is 3-D, so we&apos;re eliminating one<br/>dimension and that requires only one comma, and given a<br/>tuning error function (say squared cents error) this comma<br/>will always (for the right error function) give a single<br/>tuning for a pair of generators.  Except there&apos;s still the<br/>question of &apos;factoring&apos; the map, that is, whether to use a<br/>fifth and and octave or a fourth and an octave, etc.  To<br/>standardize that, Gene uses something called Hermite normal<br/>form.  I think.  Gene can tell you more.</p><p>So if you use the right error function and Hermite normal<br/>form, you do get a single tuning of the generators for a<br/>comma.... in the &quot;codimension 1&quot; case (where map subtracts<br/>one dimension).  However if you&apos;ve got the 11-limit and you<br/>want rank 2, you need three commas (codimension 3) and then<br/>things get more complicated.  Gene and Graham have developed<br/>ways to make sense of it, but it&apos;s not easy and it&apos;s still<br/>a bit of a work in progress.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 12:01:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,<br/>Wow, this is a lot more complicated than I expected.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Maps vanish commas, not tunings.

But then you say when we &quot;temper out&quot; 81/80, we do so according to a map where 3/2 and 5/4 can mean whatever we want.  It seems to me that there has to be some non-arbitrary limit, related to the commas being tempered out, for what intervals like 3/2 and 5/4 can mean.  Otherwise you could say every temperament tempers out every comma, and they&apos;d only be differentiable by error.  We could call, say, Mohajira something like &quot;16-comma meantone&quot;, and that would be absurd.  Is there really no non-arbitrary way around this?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also, does every comma that could be made to vanish in a<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament imply a unique generator range?

I know that for a specific &quot;error&quot; value, you will get a specific tuning of generators, but what I wanted to know is if the range of error values is arbitrary or if it&apos;s related to the comma.</p><p>I assumed all temperaments dealt with adding or subtracting some fraction of a comma (i.e. less than a whole comma) or commas to one of the intervals from which the comma is derived.  For instance, 81/80 is the difference between four 3/2s and one 5/4, so it would seem like if you wanted to temper it out, you just subtract some fragment of the comma from 3/2.  The error between 5/4 and 3/2 will remain constant, i.e. if you don&apos;t subtract any amount of 81/80 from 3/2, then 5/4 bears a whole comma&apos;s worth of error, but if you subtract 1/4 comma, then you get a pure 5/4 with the error distributed over the four 3/2s.  It would seem to me that when you subtract more than 1/4 comma, the 5/4 will start to pick up more error, so now you&apos;ve actually gone past an 81/80&apos;s-worth of error and it stops making sense to say you&apos;re tempering out 81/80.  Why does there have to be more to it than this?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 1:08:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What confuses me is on the one hand, we see 81/80 as the difference between four 3/2&apos;s and 5/4--to understand 81/80, we have to regard 3/2 and 5/4 as having absolute values.

It seems to me that if the 3/2 and 5/4 cease sounding like 3/2 and 5/4, then you&apos;ve gone beyond the bounds of acceptable tempering. That&apos;s why I put quote marks around &quot;temperaments&quot; like father or beep--they don&apos;t really have an acceptable range of values. If your 5/4 morphs into something more like 9/7, in my view you may have a temperament, but it isn&apos;t meantone.</p><p>Here&apos;s a fun game you can play with meantone retuning. Let&apos;s say you want to use 36edo as a meantone tuning. You decide 29/36 would make for a nifty generator, and call it a fifth. Four of these, down two octaves, gives 44/36 (11/9) octaves, and you call that a major third. You are happy with your new meantone tuning, since the 5-limit triads you tune in this way sound harmonious to you. Unfortunately, it isn&apos;t really meantone since your &quot;fifth&quot; is actually very close to 7/4, and your &quot;major third&quot; is even closer to 7/3. Your attempt at approximating 1-5/4-3/2 has lead you to 1-7/3-7/4, and your meantone piece, while nicely harmonious, sounds not at all like the piece you started with.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 1:22:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Igs,</p><p>I&apos;m going to riff on this best I can.

How do you find these approximations in the<br/>scale?  Usually you take the interval in the scale closest<br/>in size to 3/2 to be the 3/2 approximation, and so on.<br/>So that&apos;s a rule that lets you test if a scale is making<br/>81/80 vanish.</p><p>In the 81-limit, 81/80 is tempered out when 81/80<br/>approximates to zero steps.  You&apos;d check if there was a<br/>step closer in size to 22 cents than 0.  If the step size<br/>were 45 cents, 81/80 would vanish, because 0 is a better<br/>approximation.</p><p>If the scale tempered out 81/80 via the 5-limit map but<br/>not via direct approximation, or vice versa, it would be<br/>*81-limit inconsistent*.</p><p>That&apos;s the scale-based way of looking at things.</p><p>The temperament-based way works differently.  You start<br/>with a simple map -- a map that uses short stacks, like<br/>meantone with stacks of 4 units and 1 unit.  Maps with<br/>tall stacks aren&apos;t good because you&apos;d never get to use<br/>them unless you had a lot of notes in your scale.  Like<br/>with meantone, you only need a 4-note scale to encounter<br/>the comma.  So simple maps are good.</p><p>So you start with some good map and ask what the best<br/>tuning is.  To tell if one tuning is better than another<br/>you need a way to measure error.  Once you say what way<br/>you like you can answer the question.  And once you have<br/>this &quot;optimal&quot; tuning for the generators of your map, you<br/>can produce a scale by stacking them.  You know it will<br/>pass the test for scales we discussed above as far as<br/>making the comma from the map vanish.... unless you stack<br/>the generator so many times that a better approximation<br/>comes up than the one mapped.

The max error isn&apos;t bounded.  You can have as<br/>crappy a tuning as you want!  But you can&apos;t have no error.<br/>That&apos;d be JI and your comma wouldn&apos;t vanish.  So that&apos;s<br/>what the comma specifies -- a minimum amount of error that<br/>you must have.</p><p>&gt; Why does the question of factoring the map arise?</p><p>It arises because, as you noted, the smaller generator can<br/>always be subtracted from the larger -- it could be 5ths<br/>and octaves or 4ths and octaves.  For a rank 3 temperament<br/>there are three different generators, and you can imagine<br/>that means even more ways to &apos;factor&apos; the map.  Rather<br/>than deal with all that, Gene introduced wedgies.  There&apos;s<br/>only one wedgie for each temperament so you&apos;ll never count<br/>the same temperament twice by accident.</p><p>&gt; what I wanted to know is if the range of error values is<br/>&gt; arbitrary or if it&apos;s related to the comma.</p><p>See above.</p><p>&gt; For instance, 81/80 is the difference between four 3/2s<br/>&gt; and one 5/4, so it would seem like if you wanted to temper<br/>&gt; it out, you just subtract some fragment of the comma<br/>&gt; from 3/2.</p><p>Right, you can find the TOP tuning for a codimension 1<br/>temperament (e.g. 5-limit rank 2) by distributing the<br/>comma this way -- the algorithm is easy and is in Paul&apos;s<br/>Middle Path paper.

You have more error than you need is all.<br/>In the Baroque period, many well temperaments made use<br/>of sharp 5ths.  But in the 20th century Owen Jorgensen<br/>(I think it was) pointed out that this is more error than<br/>needed -- he called it &quot;harmonic waste&quot;.  If you split<br/>the Pythagorean comma over all 12 fifths they wind up<br/>narrow.  So if you make any of them wider than 3/2 you<br/>just have to make up for that somewhere else.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>* This is disputed by some in the early music sce</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 1:27:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; * This is disputed by some in the early music sce</p><p>Sorry, edit cruft.

That sounds tricky, because I guess it isn&apos;t absolutely related to size of generator.  For instance, between any two sizes of generator that give small EDOs--say between the fifth of 19-EDO and 26-EDO--there&apos;re going to be lots of fifths that give very BIG EDOs, where better approximations to 5/4 are almost sure to appear eventually.  Even one minor tweak to the size of a fifth, like 699 cents instead of 700, gives a major third much better than 400 cents if you go way the heck out on the spiral of fifths.  Seems like the only sure-fire way is to stick with values from the Stern-Brocot tree, find the largest EDO where 4 fifths is still the best approximation, and anything that&apos;s not an EDO lower than that one on the tree gets ruled out.  But then you&apos;d end up ruling out a whole lot of scales where 4 fifths is still a &quot;good enough&quot; approximation of 5/4 to function as a meantone.  I&apos;d love to hear how Herman approached this.  Hopefully he&apos;s reading?</p><p>&gt; Once you say how you intend to measure error (total cents<br/>&gt; error, mean squared error, Tenney-weighted, etc.) you can<br/>&gt; find one or more minimums -- tunings that give the least<br/>&gt; error.  The max error isn&apos;t bounded.  You can have as<br/>&gt; crappy a tuning as you want!  But you can&apos;t have no error.<br/>&gt; That&apos;d be JI and your comma wouldn&apos;t vanish.  So that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what the comma specifies -- a minimum amount of error that<br/>&gt; you must have.</p><p>Damn.  So the comma is the minimum error, but there is no max error.  I was afraid you were going to say that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For instance, 81/80 is the difference between four 3/2s<br/>&gt; &gt; and one 5/4, so it would seem like if you wanted to temper<br/>&gt; &gt; it out, you just subtract some fragment of the comma<br/>&gt; &gt; from 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, you can find the TOP tuning for a codimension 1<br/>&gt; temperament (e.g. 5-limit rank 2) by distributing the<br/>&gt; comma this way -- the algorithm is easy and is in Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt; Middle Path paper.  But when you get to codimension 2<br/>&gt; (e.g. 7-limit rank 2) this simple picture no longer<br/>&gt; applies, because the commas are mixing.</p><p>Yeah, that&apos;s the crazy part.  Mixing commas.  I suppose for something like a 7-limit meantone, you&apos;d want to temper out...what, the difference between 10 fifths and 7/4?  So 59049/57344?  Convenient that 1/10 of that comma is very close to 1/4 of 81/80, I&apos;m sure it gets much more complex in other temperaments.  Like if you wanted to make 2 fourths equal to 7/4 instead of 10 fifths, then you&apos;d get what, a comma of 64/63?  So then you&apos;d have to take 1/2 that comma, ~13.63 cents, out of the fourth, or add it to the fifth...and NOW I see where these error formulas come into play.  The two commas are pushing the generator in opposite directions.  I&apos;d be at a total loss to figure out an optimal generator.  And even more at a loss to tell if that generator --assuming it&apos;s not identifiable as exactly belonging to a lowish EDO--wouldn&apos;t produce approximations better than the desired mapping if extended far enough.</p><p>Man, temperament is a LOT more complicated than I thought!</p><p>&gt; &gt;The error between 5/4 and 3/2 will remain constant, i.e.<br/>&gt; &gt;if you don&apos;t subtract any amount of 81/80 from 3/2, then<br/>&gt; &gt;5/4 bears a whole comma&apos;s worth of error, but if you<br/>&gt; &gt;subtract 1/4 comma, then you get a pure 5/4 with the error<br/>&gt; &gt;distributed over the four 3/2s.  It would seem to me that<br/>&gt; &gt;when you subtract more than 1/4 comma, the 5/4 will start<br/>&gt; &gt;to pick up more error, so now you&apos;ve actually gone past<br/>&gt; &gt;an 81/80&apos;s-worth of error and it stops making sense to say<br/>&gt; &gt;you&apos;re tempering out 81/80.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No- 81/80 still vanishes because you still wind up on<br/>&gt; the same note!  You have more error than you need is all.</p><p>The same note as what?  I mean, say you use a fifth like 690 cents, where four of them gives a major third of 360 cents, but if you keep going till 11 fifths out, you get an interval of 390 cents, a better 5/4...so aren&apos;t you really tempering out the difference between 11 3/2s and a 5/4 at this point, or 177147/163840?  But then, maybe you could keep going even further, and find a better 5/4 made from 690-cent generators (I&apos;m too lazy/inept to pursue it any further myself), so then *really* you&apos;d be tempering out THAT comma.</p><p>I guess my point is that unless you nail the 5/4 exactly, or you&apos;re in an EDO where you know there is no better 5/4, there&apos;s gonna be a chance that a better approximation will pop up, and if a better approximation DOES pop up, doesn&apos;t that imply a different comma than 81/80?  Is this what Herman was working on?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 11:54:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Igs!</p><p>&gt; But theoretically, if you were of a mind to be &quot;difficult&quot;<br/>&gt; about it, you *could* take an interval that doesn&apos;t approximate<br/>&gt; 3/2 and &quot;say&quot; that it does, and call whatever interval four<br/>&gt; of them approximates a &quot;5/4&quot;...then you could say it vanishes<br/>&gt; 81/80, right?  You&apos;d just be a jerk for saying it.</p><p>Exactly.  Gene just answered, &apos;don&apos;t be a jerk&apos;.  Nobody&apos;s<br/>bothered to quantify it.  Since there&apos;s no reason to use more<br/>than the minimum I suppose you&apos;re a jerk if you use any more<br/>than that (since you were free to choose the error measure).<br/>But that makes many 17th-century tuners jerks, and the early<br/>music crowd doesn&apos;t like their heroes being called jerks.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If the scale tempered out 81/80 via the 5-limit map but<br/>&gt; &gt; not via direct approximation, or vice versa, it would be<br/>&gt; &gt; *81-limit inconsistent*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, so *that&apos;s* what consistency means.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt; Oh, NOW I get what he was trying to do.  That sounds<br/>&gt; tricky, because I guess it isn&apos;t absolutely related to size<br/>&gt; of generator.  For instance, between any two sizes of<br/>&gt; generator that give small EDOs--say between the fifth of<br/>&gt; 19-EDO and 26-EDO--there&apos;re going to be lots of fifths that<br/>&gt; give very BIG EDOs, where better approximations to 5/4 are<br/>&gt; almost sure to appear eventually.  Even one minor tweak to<br/>&gt; the size of a fifth, like 699 cents instead of 700, gives<br/>&gt; a major third much better than 400 cents if you go way the<br/>&gt; heck out on the spiral of fifths.  Seems like the only<br/>&gt; sure-fire way is to stick with values from the Stern-Brocot<br/>&gt; tree, find the largest EDO where 4 fifths is still the best<br/>&gt; approximation, and anything that&apos;s not an EDO lower than<br/>&gt; that one on the tree gets ruled out.  But then you&apos;d end up<br/>&gt; ruling out a whole lot of scales where 4 fifths is still a<br/>&gt; &quot;good enough&quot; approximation of 5/4 to function as a meantone.<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love to hear how Herman approached this.  Hopefully he&apos;s<br/>&gt; reading?</p><p>Herman wasn&apos;t thinking in terms of EDOs, but in terms of<br/>rank 2 temperaments.  There, you take the optimal generator<br/>and stack it.  Each time, you check if a better approx. has<br/>appeared.  As soon as it does, you stop and report the size<br/>of the stack.  But you&apos;re right that a small change in the<br/>generator size can change this number.</p><p>&gt; Yeah, that&apos;s the crazy part.  Mixing commas.  I suppose<br/>&gt; for something like a 7-limit meantone, you&apos;d want to temper<br/>&gt; out...what, the difference between 10 fifths and 7/4?</p><p>That&apos;s one way.  There are different ways to extend<br/>meantone.</p><p>&gt; Like if you wanted to make 2 fourths equal to 7/4 instead<br/>&gt; of 10 fifths, then you&apos;d get what, a comma of 64/63?</p><p>Yup, pajara does that (but it doesn&apos;t get rid of 81/80).</p><p>&gt; So then you&apos;d have to take 1/2 that comma, ~13.63 cents,<br/>&gt; out of the fourth, or add it to the fifth...and NOW I see<br/>&gt; where these error formulas come into play.</p><p>You should read Middle Path and work through the meantone<br/>tuning algorithm.  In TOP we temper all the prime factors<br/>of the comma, including the octave, to make it vanish.<br/>That spreads it out as widely and evenly as possible.  But<br/>the final insight is to dole out the error in proportion<br/>to the Tenney height -- because you&apos;ll notice it less on<br/>more discordant intervals.  And Tenney height adds up the<br/>same way primes multiply in just intonation.  So the error<br/>you doled out to the primes will be the same error doled<br/>out to ANY interval.  It&apos;s all in the paper!</p><p>&gt; The two commas are pushing the generator in opposite<br/>&gt; directions.  I&apos;d be at a total loss to figure out an<br/>&gt; optimal generator.</p><p>Yup, I don&apos;t know how to do it either.

It would seem to me that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;when you subtract more than 1/4 comma, the 5/4 will start<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;to pick up more error, so now you&apos;ve actually gone past<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;an 81/80&apos;s-worth of error and it stops making sense to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;say you&apos;re tempering out 81/80.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No- 81/80 still vanishes because you still wind up on<br/>&gt; &gt; the same note!

Herman: did you compute this number<br/>&gt; for popular temperaments (I forget)?</p><p>I made a set of charts for some common 5-limit temperaments and put them in the tuning-math files folder at <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Rank%202%20Consistency/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Rank%202%20Consistency/</a>.

It&apos;s quite possible that I would have got different results if I checked for better approximations of other intervals. For each tuning within the range of the chart, I looked for mappings that were more accurate than the mapping of the temperament. For instance, quarter comma meantone has a fifth of around 696.58 cents, so its approximation of 3/1 is 1896.58 cents. But you get a better approximation after 30 generators, at 1902.65 cents (only 0.69 cents sharp, vs. 5.38 cents flat). You can&apos;t get a better approximation of 2/1 or 5/1, since these are exactly just in quarter-comma meantone. TOP meantone with generators of around 504.13 and 1201.70 cents has a better consistency for 3/1: you need to go as far as (+75, -175) before you get a better approximation than (+2, -1). But it has a better approximation of 5/1 at (+17, -35). And since the octave is also tempered, eventually at (+87, -205) you reach a better approximation of 2/1.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 6:03:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>...</p><p>&gt;&gt; The two commas are pushing the generator in opposite<br/>&gt;&gt; directions.

The easiest, general way to get a determinant is to find an<br/>echelon form and mulitply the diagonals, but you can still hard code<br/>the solutions up to rank 3 easily enough.</p><p>You can also find the generators using determiniants, by somebodyorother&apos;s law.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2010 2:35:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 28 August 2010 14:21, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Graham calls it &quot;simple badness&quot;, but we used to call error times complexity<br/>&gt; &quot;relative error&quot;, and it seems to me the older term more precisely captures<br/>&gt; what it&apos;s all all about.

If you did, it&apos;s a shame<br/>you didn&apos;t say so at the time.  I remember something about error as a<br/>proportion of the step size of an equal temperament being relative<br/>error.  But if you apply that to the simple badness formula (what I<br/>call &quot;scalar badness&quot;) it doesn&apos;t imply TOP-RMS error.
