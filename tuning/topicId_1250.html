Could<br/>&gt; anyone suggest where I could get information about the construction of<br/>&gt; these particular tunings besides Barbour&apos;s &quot;Tuning and Temeperament&quot; ?</p><p>They&apos;re pretty popular tunings.  Owen Jorgensen covers them both in his<br/>Big Red Book, _Tuning_ (subtitled almost as lengthily as an 18th-century<br/>novel), and they turn up lots of other places as well.  Here&apos;s a short<br/>breakdown:</p><p>Prinz, more commonly known as Kirnberger III, is tuned as follows: the<br/>four fifths C-G-D-A-E are each tempered narrow by a quarter of a<br/>syntonic comma; the fifth B-F# tempered narrow by a schisma; all other<br/>fifths just.</p><p>Young goes like this: the six fifths C-G-D-A-E-B-F# each tempered narrow<br/>by a sixth of a Pythagorean comma, the other six just.  This is just<br/>Vallotti&apos;s temperament transposed up a fifth.  Vallotti&apos;s very easy to<br/>remember, in that all the fifths which are tempered are between two<br/>white keys.</p><p>HTH.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu">manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Well, so far, every time I break he runs out.<br/>  -\-\-- o    But he&apos;s gotta slip up sometime . . . &quot;</p><p>             NOTE: dehyphenate node to remove spamblock.          &lt;*&gt;</p></div>
