For abstract<br/>purposes and to match an ensemble of four I suggested Dark Brother, to<br/>connect with the Incident at Drakes Bay, and with Night of Sorrow wafting in.<br/> The American Festival of Microtonal Music Ensemble will consist of Joshua<br/>Pierce playing Henry Lowengard&apos;s Chromelodeon-influenced Proteus, Skip<br/>LaPlante and his traveling Kithara (which needs 2 full days just to rebuild,<br/>and one day to go in their travel cases), cellist David Eggar, and I will<br/>corporeally play Skip&apos;s tubed-bass marimba and utter.</p><p>Incident at Drakes Bay is an idea piece, definitively abstract.  With only<br/>Harry Partch&apos;s intervals and a gestalt of his sound we will improvise using<br/>Dark Brother themes, etc.  I have exploring the idea of the bassoon as my<br/>dark brother, perhaps blending in some of the Dark Brother themes.  Maybe,<br/>Dark Brother takes place in Drakes Bay?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director<br/>AFMM Ensemble</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>2/19/2001 12:20:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; The Barbican has asked us for a slot of 25 minutes to be filled...</p><p>and etc. Thanks, Johnny, for the info.

I guess I won&apos;t really know what will happen until I get<br/>there.  I do know that Ornette Coleman performs at the Barbican on the next<br/>night.</p><p>Best to the list, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
