I can recede 12-tET in my mind (and do all the time), but it sure<br/>&gt; as heck has a grip on most Western music out there.  Something way<br/>&gt; beyond &quot;standard&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s a case by case situation: I&apos;m thinking that there is nothing<br/>beyond &quot;standard&quot; because it is THE focus for comparison.  Now in my<br/>particular case,<br/>12-tET is not a standard other than for the physicalness of a particular<br/>instrument, the intellectual framing of cents, or when 12-tET is the actual<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; tuning that I am performing in.</p><p>This May 18th there will be a New Sounds broadcast on WNYC-FM radio, wherein<br/>John Schaefer and I discuss these very definitions.  We taped last Thursday.<br/>I spoke of these different definitions, and I admit it&apos;s getting frustrating.</p><p>For example, I mentioned that Bach in Werckmeister is not considered<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; in one definition because there is no interval smaller than a<br/>semitone used.  But to call this an alternate tuning is to disregard its<br/>primacy.  The first definition is...well, I will leave this alone for it<br/>seems more academic than musical.  The second definitions is....well, obvious<br/>as an extension of the first since the &quot;musical&quot; intervals are displaced from<br/>any absolute positions by &quot;micro&quot; intervals.  Once the second definition is<br/>in place, more accurately explaining the musical world we live in, it is<br/>possible to have faith in a third definition.  Perhaps this one is scary,<br/>unrealistic, or misguided to those who don&apos;t share it...and that is<br/>understandable.  But it is frustrating to have one&apos;s orientation questioned<br/>by those who where different shoes.</p><p>To put it a different way, if one can imagine any intervals and compose in a<br/>way that includes all tunings on the same mental page AND play it with<br/>authority, how can one question a credo that all music is microtonal?  For<br/>all practicality, 12-tET is as difficult to attain as any microtonal tuning.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=22188 href="#22188">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2001 4:15:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;But it is frustrating to have one&apos;s orientation questioned by those who<br/>&gt;where different shoes.</p><p>Quite true.
