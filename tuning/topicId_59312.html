I&apos;ll be sharing it with a few<br/>people I know - a philosopher and a group interested in creating<br/>a free learning community.  And it looks like I&apos;ll be tuning in to<br/>Kyle Gann&apos;s blog quite regularly, too ... much of interest there.</p><p>On the search for novelty:  I feel it can be a distraction from<br/>the main business, which is to say what one has to say, as directly<br/>and effectively as one knows how.  Sometimes this means reusing<br/>ideas and techniques which were old before civilisation began,<br/>and sometimes using those which one has to invent today.</p><p>We are so fortunate, in this first _ever_ age of instant<br/>communication, to be able to access the whole accumulated<br/>knowledge of humankind, and also to be (ideologically and<br/>politically) free to choose whatever kinds of musical resource<br/>we may find there, with which to express ourselves.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; Just a little aside: we&apos;ve had talk before on the list about seeking<br/>&gt; new things, and whether or not that was a valid creative path.
