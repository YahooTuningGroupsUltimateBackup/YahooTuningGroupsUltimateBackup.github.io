John Chalmers, Fokker attributed his tables of commas to you. Do you<br/>happen to remember (I know it was 32 years ago) what portion of the harmonic<br/>lattice was searched to find these commas?</p><p>2. I suspect the answer to (1) is some sort of symmetrical region in the<br/>Euler-Fokker (rectangular) lattice. I think we should instead use a<br/>symmetrical region in the triangular lattice, so that, for example, major<br/>sevenths are less direct than minor thirds.</p><p>3. It doesn&apos;t make much sense to define a periodicity block with three<br/>unison vectors if the block contains intervals smaller than one of the<br/>unison vectors. I&apos;m sure many of the inconsistent scales I was getting would<br/>not appear had this been enforced.</p><p>4. Although (2) and (3) may change this, it appears that 22-tone systems<br/>have a somewhat privileged status with respect to Fokker&apos;s idea.<br/>Particularly surprising is that using the 12 unison vectors no larger than<br/>225:224, 22-tone and 171-tone are the most commonly appearing systems by a<br/>wide margin. To what extent can we interpret this to mean that 22 notes is a<br/>natural amount for 7-limit harmony? (This is not a new idea -- Ben Johnston<br/>used a 22-tone scale for the 7-limit section of his String Quartet #4.)</p></div><h3>Paul H. Erlich &#x3C;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/1999 11:59:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve still received no comments about my ideas here, so let me explain why I<br/>think this is important.</p><p>A just intonation system will often, for practical reasons, have to have a<br/>finite number of notes. Erv Wilson, Kraig Grady, and of course Fokker have<br/>given many examples of logical ways of &quot;snipping&quot; the lattice. After<br/>snipping, one may or may not wish to use temperament to connect the ends<br/>back together. But rather than look for particulars, there are some very<br/>general questions that the Fokker formalism should allow us to answer.</p><p>The sensible place to &quot;snip&quot; the lattice is right before a new note is added<br/>that is so close to an old note, that it can function like the old note (a<br/>wide or narrow tolerance for deviations could be implied here, depending on<br/>the context). In the context of 7-limit harmony, three different types of<br/>&quot;snips&quot;, applied consistenly, lead to a finite set of JI pitches. A very<br/>wide variety of JI scales exist, but given three intervals that define your<br/>&quot;snips&quot;, all the possibilities will have the same number of notes. That<br/>number is what the Fokker determinant gives you. Although this number<br/>usually described in terms of the volume of a parallelopiped, the edges can<br/>be deformed into almost any shape one wishes (as long as in each of the<br/>three sets of four parallel edges, the four remain translationally<br/>congruent) and one gets a JI scale with the same number of notes.</p><p>Now in my earlier posts I described the results of trying out every possible<br/>triplet of &quot;snips&quot; out of a large set, but some restrictions should be<br/>placed on this process. Most evidently, it wouldn&apos;t make sense if the JI<br/>scale contained an interval smaller than any of the intervals defining a<br/>&quot;snip&quot;. In more mathematical terms, the periodicity block defined by three<br/>unison vectors should not contain within it any smaller (in cents) unison<br/>vectors, built upon any of the eight vertices. Any periodicity block will be<br/>a &quot;constant structures&quot; scale. But this is a more stringent criterion. I<br/>read about it in Mandelbaum and someone derived the sizes of 5-limit scales<br/>that satisfy it. Does anyone have this reference handy?</p><p>My question to the programmers on this list (Manuel, Paul H, . . .): Can we<br/>devise a simple algorithm to find all the solutions here? If we start with<br/>the simplest (defined by distance on the triangular lattice) unison vectors,<br/>and then replace the largest one with the next simplest, and repeat the<br/>process, I think we make some omissions and include some we don&apos;t want. For<br/>example, if we use odd limit instead of the Hahn-Erlich triangular metric,<br/>and Fokker&apos;s list of unison vectors under 35 cents, the results of doing<br/>that are</p><p>|-2  0 -1|        |-2  0 -1|<br/>| 0  2 -2| = 10;  | 0  2 -2| = 22<br/>|-3  0 -4|        | 3 -1  3|</p><p>|-2  0 -1|<br/>| 3 -1 -3| = 5<br/>|-3  0  4|</p><p>| 4 -1  0|<br/>| 3 -1 -3| = 5<br/>|-3  0 -4|</p><p>| 2 -3  1|        |-4  3 -2|        | 1 -3 -2|<br/>| 3 -1 -3| = 58;  | 3 -1 -3| = 53;  | 3 -1 -3| = 53<br/>|-3  0 -4|        |-3  0 -4|        |-3  0 -4|</p><p>| 2 -3  1|        |-4  3 -2|        | 1 -3 -2|<br/>| 3 -1 -3| = 27;  | 3 -1 -3| = 53;  | 3 -1 -3| = 31<br/>|-4  3 -2|        | 1 -3 -2|        | 2 -3  1|</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>| 3 -1 -3| = 0<br/>| 2  2 -1|</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>| 1  0  3| = 31<br/>| 2  2 -1|</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 31<br/>| 2  2 -1|</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 0<br/>| 0 -5  2|</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 99<br/>|-7  4  1|</p><p>| 8  1  0|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 171<br/>|-7  4  1|</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/1999 6:53:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 316.3]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve still received no comments about my ideas here, so let<br/>&gt; me explain why I think this is important.</p><p>Paul, thanks for further elaborating your previous post on<br/>this subject.

Erlich &#x3C;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/1999 1:23:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for your interest Joe. In Mandelbaum&apos;s dissertation there is<br/>mentioned a theorist (or several) who worked with the concept of &quot;generating<br/>intervals&quot; (=unison vectors) and &quot;constructing intervals&quot; (=step sizes). One<br/>theorist was said to prove that the only 5-limit JI scales where all<br/>generating intervals were smaller than all constructing intervals had<br/>cardinality 5, 7, 12, 19, 22, 31, 41, 53, 72 . . . (I may have this list<br/>wrong). So basically what I&apos;m asking is, in the context of Fokker<br/>periodicity blocks, can we determine something similar for 7-limit JI<br/>scales? Also, it is of interest to know how often each cardinality comes up<br/>. . . for example, within the range of reasonable unison vectors, it may<br/>seem that 12 is usually the &quot;natural&quot; cardinality for thinking about<br/>(composing in, notating) 5-limit JI . . . can we assess the situation for<br/>7-limit JI, and decide among 22, 27, 31, etc.?</p><p>This is an idea that&apos;s been floating around my head for about two years now.<br/>While the process of evaluating ETs in terms of how well they approximate JI<br/>occupied my thought for many years, leading to the notion of consistency and<br/>the first two figures in my paper, the newer idea is evaluting JI systems in<br/>terms of how well they approximate ETs. The reason the two questions are<br/>different is that in the first, the only JI intervals one cares about are<br/>the first-order ones, the consonances, the ones up to a certain odd limit.<br/>In the second, since one is constructing a JI system, one has these<br/>higher-order intervals (the unison vectors and constructing intervals) to<br/>worry about.</p><p>Fokker periodicity blocks are the natural result of deciding on a minimal<br/>set of unison vectors. But if a smaller interval occurs within the block<br/>than one of the unison vectors, the construction makes little intuitive<br/>sense. If a smaller interval does not occur, then what you have is a clear<br/>delineation of interval classes as in an ET. So what one needs is a<br/>geometrical calculation to assess whether a unison vector is contained<br/>anywhere within the periodicity block formed by three other unison vectors,<br/>at least one of which is larger than the first one. For if and only if it<br/>is, the block has a &quot;generating interval&quot; that is larger than a<br/>&quot;constructing interval&quot;, making it inadmissable by the above criterion.</p><p>What I&apos;m hoping for (and Paul Hahn is probably best equipped among us to<br/>help) is an algorithm that will start with a small portion of the lattice<br/>and rather large unison vectors, and work its way out to smaller unison<br/>vectors and a larger portion of the lattice, evaluating all possibilities,<br/>without skipping any. Or perhaps we can look to the work of the original<br/>theorist who looked at this in the 5-limit and think of some shortcuts that<br/>can be applied to the 7-limit. Either way, the results would go along way<br/>toward characterizing the seemingly endless possibilities in reasonable,<br/>finite JI systems.</p><p>In other words, Joe, this is all about finity! (Once again, a Partch<br/>tonality diamond is most certainly not an example of finity in this context,<br/>while Partch&apos;s 43-tone system could be seen as a variation on an 11-limit,<br/>41-tone periodicity block with two auxillary notes.)</p></div><h3>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/1999 2:03:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 17 Sep 1999, Paul H.

Indeed I did a<br/>search through the possible intervals keeping the smallest ones, taking the<br/>determinant for finding the number of tones in the set. I didn&apos;t know about<br/>the work of Fokker then, but I basically reinvented the principle of the<br/>periodicity blocks.</p><p>The problem algorithmically is to search in the right order, indeed to not<br/>have any smaller intervals inside the block.

The trick<br/>is to only search half the plane, in a triangle where both axes are positive<br/>and in a rectangle where the signs are opposite.

You have to search in four<br/>octants (? 3D quadrants) of the space.

It was too much trouble too search<br/>these with the right relative scaling (log3 log5 log7) as I had done in the<br/>5 limit case.
