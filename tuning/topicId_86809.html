I don&apos;t use Linux but I&apos;m now told that the windows versions of my software do work with Ubuntu Linux using the new version of WineHQ. A link to WineHQ is on the downloads page, linked below.</p><p>Also, any new Windows users who recently downloaded CSE or TPXE Windows versions for the first time and had installation problems, sorry about that; those were due to missing files that have been restored in this latest upload.</p><p>Get the software for free here: &lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AAH<br/>=====</p></div>
