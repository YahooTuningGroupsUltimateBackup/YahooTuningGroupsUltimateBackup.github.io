For example,<br/>my tune &quot;Mysteries&quot; (on &quot;Acoustic Stick&quot;) was composed in 1979, when I<br/>was studying 12 tone serialism. I came up with a 12 tone melodic line,<br/>than found chords to fit the line, totally by ear...I just messed around<br/>until it felt right. Then, years later, I put it into 19 tone eq...now<br/>it&apos;s finished. Another tune, &quot;Microseconds,&quot; in 34 eq, was a piece of<br/>cake...I got Larry Hanson&apos;s 34 tone Telecaster bass in the mail, opened<br/>it up and started playing it. Within 5 minutes, the bassline of the<br/>piece appeared...with a bit of shaping, it was all done, real quick. Of<br/>course, the guitar solo was another piece of work, but I improvised that<br/>at the recording session, with a bare minimum of practice.<br/>    My tune &quot;Breakfast Squids&quot; took 25 years to write...I had the title<br/>(there&apos;s a story) many years ago, and never forgot it...then, somehow,<br/>several years after I began playing 19, the rhythms and melody showed<br/>up, and I said &quot;that&apos;s it!&quot; because it was...the title suggested<br/>everything else. &quot;From the West&quot; began as a scale in 34...it took me<br/>about a month to put this scale together...after that, many months of<br/>practicing went into finding ways to develop the scale melodically.<br/>Ernie Crews and I recorded it live in El Paso, in 1996, and I have NEVER<br/>since played it as well...probably never will. My blues tunes &quot;Birdwalk&quot;<br/>and &quot;667 Shuffle&quot; came from simply stretching my blues chops a bit, to<br/>make them fit 19, and &quot;The Spider&quot; evolved over the years from a 12 tone<br/>piece into a 19 tone serial row. Once I had the row, I transposed it<br/>into various shapes, and there it was. Some of the lines in &quot;The Spider&quot;<br/>are mighty mighty difficult to play.<br/>   I could go on...usually, my intellect is present at the compositional<br/>process, but more as a respectful helper than as a main mover. My pieces<br/>seem to come to me from somewhere else...not just my pieces, either, but<br/>often album cover designs and general concepts as well, such as the<br/>decision to do an all acoustic album for my 2nd project. And, that&apos;s the<br/>wonderful, mysterious quality of art...it puts me (us?) in touch with<br/>something beyond this teensy self, and lets me peer into other worlds<br/>and places not of this Earth...it&apos;s a great ride, and I enjoy it<br/>immensely....Hstick</p></div>
