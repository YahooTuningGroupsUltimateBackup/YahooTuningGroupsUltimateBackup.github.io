Maybe because of<br/>the sounds you used, or because of the noisy soundcard in my PC at<br/>work (where it downloads fast).<br/>With the tuning resolution of 1.56 cents of the TZ81Z there can only<br/>be a slight difference between the 19-31 and meanquar_19 versions<br/>however.<br/>Perhaps you can also try the just scale I posted yesterday.<br/>By the way these extended meantone scales run from Gb to B#.<br/>Do &quot;set notation e31&quot; to see the names.</p><p>&gt;Is there just a &quot;regular&quot; 19-tET scale in Scala?? I&apos;m not seeing<br/>&gt;the file.  The scale step would be around 63, yes?? Or is that<br/>&gt;just easy to get using the commands??</p><p>Yes, octave divisions are easy to create, so there aren&apos;t files of<br/>them in general. Just type &quot;equal 19&quot;.</p><p>Maybe you haven&apos;t tried this command for the different just scales<br/>yet: &quot;lattice 3 5 7&quot;.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
