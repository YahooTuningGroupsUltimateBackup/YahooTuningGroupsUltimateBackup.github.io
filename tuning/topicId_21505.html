Usually the concerts lasted about an hour long each. Then there<br/>were about two &quot;normal&quot; concerts (starting at the normal time of 7 PM and<br/>lasting two or three hours) for two days before this crazy event and one<br/>concert after the event. Well, the &quot;normal&quot; concert, which happened after<br/>the two day marathon was one of the most interesting ones. It featured two<br/>Greek composers (father and son) - Mihalis Adamis and his son Giorgos<br/>Adamis, who presented extravagant electronic music, to which the son -<br/>Giorgos Adamis played a lot of extravagant wind and string instruments - the<br/>didjeridoo being the most &quot;standard&quot; and recognizeable of them all. So the<br/>music was meant to utilize the traditions of many musics and musical<br/>cultures of different remote peoples from around the world - and to<br/>incorporate them into a contemporary bohemian musical setting featuring<br/>electronic music. It was a really impressive show, both musically and<br/>visually, especially since at times it featured another Grek fellow (I am<br/>sorry that I don&apos;t have the program nearby, so I can&apos;t lok up his name)<br/>juggling with flamed torches, as well as playing more diverse instruments,<br/>and it helped the listeners penetrate into a wide domain of different<br/>musical cultures of the world. Needless to say that it featured a lot of<br/>unstandard musical temperaments, produced by these unstandard instruments. I<br/>am sorry that I can&apos;t analyze them on the spot for you, but I assure you<br/>that if you microtonal fans ever get to hear music of Mihalis and/or Giorgos<br/>Adamis, you are apt to find a paradise of unstandard musical temperaments<br/>and tunings - not to mention the assortment of innovative and imaginative<br/>sonorous effects and the great ethnomusicological experience of facing a<br/>wide variety of exotic musical traditions, so I highly recommend these two<br/>composers for listening to, if you ever get a chance to hear their music or<br/>meet them in person.</p></div><h3><a id=21521 href="#21521">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/24/2001 10:38:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Ant&quot; &lt;ant@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21505.html#21505">/tuning/topicId_21505.html#21505</a></p><p>It was a really impressive show, both musically and<br/>&gt; visually, especially since at times it featured another Greek<br/>fellow (I am sorry that I don&apos;t have the program nearby, so I can&apos;t<br/>look up his name) juggling with flamed torches, as well as playing<br/>more diverse instruments,</p><p>Hello Anton!</p><p>You hadn&apos;t mentioned the &quot;flaming torches&quot; before!

Of course, their usage was<br/>determined by the extravagant style of the music - which was the main<br/>substance of the show, obviously. If you have any extravagant multi-ethnic<br/>Down-town style piece on your program, which demands some extra-musical<br/>theatrical-visual element, sure you should think of Bengalic lights too - it<br/>would add greater zest to the microtonal temperaments of an extravagant type<br/>of music - which, in the case of the Greek composers&apos; music, it certainly<br/>was.</p><p>Anton Rovner</p></div><h3><a id=21724 href="#21724">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/27/2001 8:51:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Ant&quot; &lt;ant@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21505.html#21700">/tuning/topicId_21505.html#21700</a></p><p>&gt; Well, the &quot;flaming torches&quot; were obviously Bengalic lights, so they<br/>were not the ones that would set the stage on fire.</p><p>Hello Anton!</p><p>Well, I&apos;m familiar with the &quot;Northern Lights&quot; but not &quot;Bengalic&quot;<br/>ones...</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s the term... but I seem to be unfamilar with them...</p><p>What are they again??</p><p>________ ______ _ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21787 href="#21787">ðŸ”—</a>Ant &#x3C;ant@df.ru&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2001 3:30:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Well, the &quot;flaming torches&quot; were obviously Bengalic lights, so they<br/>were not the ones that would set the stage on fire.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Hello Anton!</p><p>Well, I&apos;m familiar with the &quot;Northern Lights&quot; but not &quot;Bengalic&quot;<br/>ones...</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s the term... but I seem to be unfamilar with them...</p><p>What are they again??</p><p>________ ______ _ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson&gt;&gt;</p><p>I can only say that they are similar to the kinds of firecrackers sold in<br/>Chinatown, not the ones that make the loud noise, but the ones that produce<br/>the &quot;cold&quot; type of flames on sticks, which are less dangerous (or maybe even<br/>not dangerous at all) in setting things up on fire. They also greatly<br/>enhance microtonal musical thinking and experimentation in music - as was<br/>shown in this concert.</p><p>I only wish I had the chance of peering into the scores of the pieces (if<br/>there were any scores at all) and seeing what kinds of temperraments did he<br/>use, since this Greek music sounded extremely interesting - unless all the<br/>pitches were &quot;relative&quot; and thus improvised by the composer-performer and<br/>the second musician - though this aleatory approach to musical notation also<br/>enhances microtonal thinking, in this case from the performers.</p></div>
