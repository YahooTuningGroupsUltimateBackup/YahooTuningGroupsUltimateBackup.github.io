It has a very simple harmonic progression which doesn&apos;t stray very far from the tonic of D major. Many of the important differences between well-temperaments only show up in remote keys. I&apos;ve thought about including a separate page of well-tempered versions of the canon for comparison, with additional versions in Db major and Eb major. I just keep forgetting to do it. :-)</p></div><h3>rumsong &#x3C;rumsong@telus.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2005 8:10:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Pachelbel&apos;s Canon isn&apos;t very good for comparing<br/>well-temperaments, for<br/>&gt; the same reason that I settled on using it for comparing these<br/>other<br/>&gt; sorts of scales and tunings.
