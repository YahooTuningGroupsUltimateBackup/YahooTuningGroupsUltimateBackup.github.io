What good is a book you never get when you order it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paolo<br/>&gt;</p><p>Mad David Beardsley:</p><p>&gt; At various microtonal concerts in NYC over the past few years<br/>&gt; I heard various accounts of checks never being deposited<br/>&gt; and so on. When I joined 6 or 7 years ago I got my<br/>&gt; copy barely within 6 weeks - fair trade laws in the US<br/>&gt; indicate that you have to fulfill an order within 6 weeks.<br/>&gt; But apparently JI Network service has fallen apart.<br/>&gt; Not much of a network.</p><p>Me:</p><p>I don&apos;t want to be put in the curious position of defending David Doty&apos;s<br/>untimeliness... but, frankly, it&apos;s amazing to me that this niche<br/>publication comes out at all...  I have been a member and have issues<br/>going back to 1988... It used to be more punctual than it is presently,<br/>but what of it??  He&apos;s still trying to do a VERY niche item and,<br/>probably, without much support.</p><p>I have never had trouble receiving materials from him upon order...<br/>admittedly that is just my own personal story.  To answer Paolo&apos;s<br/>question, however, I think the Doty primer on Just Intonation is one of<br/>the very best... in fact, it HAS to be the best, as there are no others,<br/>to my knowledge...</p><p>Why not e-mail him and find out what&apos;s wrong?  Maybe he&apos;s sick or<br/>something or got thrown out of his job??  Let&apos;s show a little<br/>flexibility and &quot;cohesion&quot; as a micro-community in a micro-community,<br/>yes??</p><p>Doty&apos;s e-mail address is:</p><p><a href="mailto:jinetwk@dnai.com">jinetwk@dnai.com</a></p><p>Oh, I should mention, he has done a nice job doing &quot;compilation<br/>cassettes&quot; of microtonal works.  One of my pieces was accepted, but my<br/>publisher, an &quot;anti-xenharmonicist&quot; put the kabosh on it, so it was<br/>never included....</p><p>____________ ____ ___ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
