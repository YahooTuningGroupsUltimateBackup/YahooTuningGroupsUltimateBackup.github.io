Just yesterday I was working<br/>on retuning the opening chord to my &apos;movie opening&apos;<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/worklist/tripcn.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/worklist/tripcn.mid</a></p><p>which has only 6 different notes, and even in that chord, until<br/>the retuning of any individual note became greater than 15 or so<br/>cents, the difference in sound was very subtle.</p><p>But, do keep in mind that Mahler symphonies are for *orchestra*,<br/>which is inifitely retunable!  He stopped composing on the piano<br/>after the 3rd symphony, so its fixed tuning was not necessarily<br/>in his mind as he wrote the 10th!</p><p>In fact, as his life progressed he was far more involved with<br/>orchestras and singers (in his job as Opera Director) than he was<br/>with pianos.  His virtuosity on piano was strictly a part of his<br/>youth.  So I would argue that the &apos;fixed-tuning mentality&apos; that<br/>goes along with using the piano would have receded in his mind<br/>as he got older.</p><p>I&apos;ve always thought that the first movement of the 10th would<br/>sound great in a jazz arrangement, and began working on one<br/>many years ago.  I gave the Adagio melody to a tenor sax with<br/>piano playing the rich chords, and bass and drums (with brushes).<br/>I&apos;ll see if I can find it, finish it, and put in online.</p><p>I was quite surprised last year to find out that Uri Caine released<br/>a CD of Mahler-based jazz.  (I&apos;ve never heard it.)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=12684 href="#12684">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2000 11:50:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12681">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12681</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...
