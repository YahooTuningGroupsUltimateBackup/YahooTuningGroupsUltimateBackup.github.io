Pitch analysis to less than &lt;1 Hz is tough to find, but the freeware<br/>&apos;Spectrogram&apos; program (<a href="http://www.monumental.com/rshorne/gram.html">www.monumental.com/rshorne/gram.html</a>) is useful to<br/>2.7 Hz. You might try the FFT portions of MATLAB or Mathematica which might<br/>be tweaked to higher accuracy.  Shareware programs like Detlev Folkmer&apos;s<br/>Tune!It or Greg Phillip&apos;s Wind Chime Designer are similar to portable<br/>tuning devices. (BTW, I have never gotten the latter to drive my sound<br/>card-- has anyone else tried it with any success?)</p><p>2. You should definitely have Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s _Scala_ program.
