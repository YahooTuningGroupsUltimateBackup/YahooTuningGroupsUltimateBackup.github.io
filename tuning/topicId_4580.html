In<br/>such a context, would anything other that CF&apos;s make sense? And again, isn&apos;t<br/>the outer loop Canright was referring to equivalent to CF&apos;s?</p><p>In the context of deriving multi-tone systems, you must be talking about<br/>approximating two or more just intervals at a time with a common smallest<br/>step size. In such a context, it makes sense that one might want to trade<br/>off an increase in the number of tones and a small worsening in one interval<br/>for a considerable improvement in the other intervals. That&apos;s where mixed<br/>expansions or Brun&apos;s algorithms can help. My guess is that in the standard<br/>multi-term CF approach or whatever, which must be what you&apos;re referring to<br/>above (since for the usual, single-term CF, &quot;convergents are the best for<br/>given sizes of terms&quot; is synonymous with &quot;scales with reasonable<br/>approximations to the just intervals in a reasonable number of tones&quot;), an<br/>ET with a higher number of notes comes in if and only if _all_ the<br/>approximations to the just intervals are improved over those of the last ET.</p><p>But with modern computer power, all these algorithms are a mere mathematical<br/>curiousity, because you can easily specify what kind of trade-off you want<br/>and then write a computer program to find the solution by brute force.</p></div>
