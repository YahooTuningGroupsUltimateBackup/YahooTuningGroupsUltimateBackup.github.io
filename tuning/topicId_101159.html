The <a href="http://avatar.com">avatar.com</a> link you gave hints at something interesting:</p><p>&gt; Now consider the same beating effect between two tones in terms of<br/>&gt; their separation in fractions of a critical bandwidth. As we have seen,<br/>&gt; at 500 Hertz the critical band is somewhere around 100 Hertz wide.<br/>&gt; Let us define 100 Hertz as &quot;unity&quot; and consider fractions of that band.</p><p>From that it would seem that the critical bandwidth varies with the tonic frequency. Otherwise experts would simply say the critical band is around 100 Hz wide without specifying a tonic at 500 Hz first. But how does the critical bandwidth vary with frequency? I&apos;ll guess logarithmically, like most things in the realm of pitch perception, but I wish I had more than a guess.</p><p>If my guess is correct then the dyadic sine-wave timbre dissonance discussed at the <a href="http://avatar.com">avatar.com</a> link is maximal at about 84 cents &amp; the width of the critical band is about 316 cents. Plausible, I suppose. Be that as it may....</p><p>Harmonic timbres, not sine waves, are where I want to go with this. Given a tonic note in some harmonic timbre I want to understand what&apos;s required for a non-tonic note to be perceived as beating against a tonic partial that&apos;s a just interval but not a simple overtone or undertone, a ratio like 6/5 or 15/11 with odd factors in both numerator &amp; denominator (OFND). My exploration suggests that a triad or tetrad must be sounded to make such beating perceptible.</p><p>You stated:</p><p>&gt; If the timbres are sine waves, the only thing that will matter is how<br/>&gt; close the two notes are to one another. If they&apos;re harmonic, you have<br/>&gt; to treat each harmonic of each timbre as its own &quot;note&quot; and figure out<br/>&gt; how close each of those are to one another as well.</p><p>This would suggest that OFND beating only seems to be against a tonic partial but is really against a partial of some non-tonic note in the chord that&apos;s required to make the beating perceptible. For instance, if beating against the tonic&apos;s 5/3 is audible in a chord with a non-tonic near 4/3, maybe what it&apos;s really beating against is the 5/4 overtone of that non-tonic.</p><p>That idea poses this challenge. I know how fast a non-tonic note would beat against 5/3 of the tonic if that were a tonic partial with a significant acoustic energy peak. Let&apos;s call that beating rate R. Now play another non-tonic note near 4/3 of the tonic, the timbre of all notes played being harmonic. When I run the numbers, I cannot satisfy myself whether the first non-tonic note should beat against 5/4 of the second non-tonic note at R or 2R.</p><p>In my explorations I&apos;m hearing R, but that could be true even at 2R if the chord includes another beat at rate R that reinforces alternating waves of the 2R beat.</p><p>Any insights?<br/>==<br/>MLV aka Manu Phonic</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, Aug 12, 2011 at 7:34 AM, manuphonic &lt;manuphonic@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On another thread Mike Battaglia said: &quot;The properties of what causes beating is a line of research that has been explored extensively in the psychoacoustics literature.
