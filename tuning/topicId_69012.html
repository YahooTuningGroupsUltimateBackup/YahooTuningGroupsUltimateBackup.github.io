I find it fascinating, and a bit amazing, that someone could get a very practical, useable well temp out of those squiggles if they were just random doodles...Egarr was convinced enough to do a whole CD using that system, I think that says a lot.<br/>   And, I really like Ross Duffin&apos;s new book &quot;How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony;&quot; one of the cool things he does in the book is to not focus so much on just keyboard tunings. He quotes famous violinists, flutists, and vocal teachers who talk, pretty consistently, about the whole step being divided into 9 commas (which, he says, implies 55 tones/octave, which Telemann mentioned)...old Leopold Mozart also mentions how flat notes and sharp notes (G#-Ab) are separated by a comma...it explains a lot of basic concepts really well to boot, I recommend it to my students who are interested in tunings.<br/>   And, lastly, a quote from the great Pablo Casals from the book: &quot;Do not be afraid to be out of tune with the piano. It is the piano that is out of tune. The piano with it&apos;s tempered scale is a compromise in intonation.&quot; Amen. Maybe other cultures who used fretless instruments (the oud for example), or axes with moveable tuners (the zheng, or the tar, with it&apos;s moveable frets) were onto something...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>   <a href="http://agenturadellarte.net">agenturadellarte.net</a>  <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=69013 href="#69013">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/15/2007 8:27:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>As your list of non-12 Bach points out, these Bach performances are not<br/>WIII.  My position is that Bach used WIII and that one needs to hear Bach  in<br/>WIIII to appreciate what I am addressing.  Wendy Carlos and I have  talked about<br/>this for years, quite positively I might add.</p><p>Pablo Casals did have that intuitive ability to anticipate intonationally<br/>where WIII would be: The D minor cello suite has a sharp minor third to ET while<br/> the C minor cello suite has a flat minor third to equal.  This mirrors<br/>beautifully what is contained in WIII and many other WTs.</p><p>You said you had heard Bach in WIII.  May I ask what you heard?   Here&apos;s the<br/>complete List of WIII on CD:<br/>Igor Kipnis, harpsichord and clavichord<br/>Ton Koopman, conductor, keyboard<br/>Rebecca Pechefsky, harpschord<br/>PITCH Early CD, Brandenberg&apos;s, WTC selections, Werckmeister Christmas<br/>Cantata, JM Bach Concerto</p><p>There was an attempt to say suggest the musical market is saturated with<br/>WIII.  I thought it might be so in Europe since it was Daniel who said  so.  Um,<br/>nothing comes up.  I really think I am talking in part about  an experiential<br/>thing.  No harm there.</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=69014 href="#69014">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2007 8:46:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Richard Egarr&apos;s recent recording of the Goldberg Variations<br/>&gt; uses the infamous Lehman &quot;squiggles&quot; tuning.

Of course, rather than bending a single sample, other things<br/>&gt; could be done, such as a sophisticated interpolation scheme.</p><p>It&apos;s a fairly complex thing, and not entirely predictable.</p><p>The very poor sampling instruments suffer the least, in a way- if<br/>the whole instrument is just a high pitched squawk mickey-moused<br/>down, it doesn&apos;t really matter much exactly where it&apos;s sampled to.<br/>That should and often does sound like crap, but even that needs a<br/>footnote, because there are some completely decent sampled sounds<br/>that are done just that way, when you peak under the hood.</p><p>When you get a modern instrument, which has samples ranging from at<br/>least every octave to multiple velocity layers on every single key,<br/>like a Gigasampler instrument, it can be just straight playback,<br/>assuming that the sounds have been carefully pitched beforehand and<br/>there&apos;s no difference between the pitch of the sample and its<br/>playback pitch. IE, when you play A-440, the sample at that key is<br/>pitched at a-440 and there&apos;s no resampling or other pitchshifting<br/>going on when you hit the key.</p><p>Which sounds great- if you want 12-EDO at A-440. As soon as you tune<br/>away from this, even with great interpolation, you&apos;re still moving<br/>the formants along with the sample. Even with formant filtering at<br/>the end of the chain, if it&apos;s a real acoustic instrument, the<br/>formant information is in the original sample, and it&apos;s never going<br/>to be right.</p><p>Throw in tunings with more than 12 pitches per octave, unless you go<br/>in yourself and assign samples to notes, and it can get seasick very<br/>quickly.</p><p>So the best way is to sample instruments at the pitch they&apos;ll be<br/>played back at, and if that&apos;s not possible, fine-tune each<br/>individual sample in a quality DAW.</p><p>Since that&apos;s not usually practical, especially if you&apos;re trying many<br/>tunings, what I do is try not to task the sampler too much. So place<br/>a sample and have its range go down a few keys, definitely a<br/>different sample for different registers, at least one for each<br/>string, limited ranges, etc. The classic tricks.</p><p>VSampler is around 150 dollars, has several interpolation settings,<br/>for realtime and superb rendering, reads and writes all kinds of<br/>formats, and takes Scala files.

Of course, rather than bending a single sample, other things<br/>&gt; could be done, such as a sophisticated interpolation scheme.</p><p>Of course, the obvious solution is to dispense with sample-based<br/>synthesis entirely for tuning comparisons. Additive synthesis is<br/>inherently indifferent to tuning systems, and can theoretically match<br/>the performance of any sample-based synth using any sample set. A<br/>project for someone on the list, perhaps? It&apos;s been on my to-do list<br/>for quite some time, but I haven&apos;t got around to it yet.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Patty</p></div>
