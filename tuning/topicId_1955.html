I have an<br/>issue<br/>&gt;that has been sitting around, complete<br/>&gt;except for one promised article,<br/>&gt;since the first of January.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And money has never been an issue<br/>&gt;--1/1 has always been paid for by<br/>&gt;memberships and store sales, since<br/>&gt;the second issue.</p><p>So this means that as editor and publisher,<br/>you don&apos;t take any responsibility for<br/>the getting more than one issue out a year.</p><p>And if late submissions are the problem,<br/>why is it that every year (for the past<br/>few years) you anounce in the Spring<br/>that the latest issue is off to the<br/>printer and we get it in the Fall?</p><p>Is the printer holding on to it because<br/>you can&apos;t come up with the cash?</p><p>A</p></div><h3><a id=1964 href="#1964">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/1999 7:25:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To the anonymous poster:</p><p>very much like the members and organizers of the Just Intonation Network,<br/>the contributors to this list share a serious passion for music.  They<br/>approach the understanding of music with seriousness, modesty, and<br/>generally with candor and civility.</p><p>The organizers of the Just Intonation Network have contributed their time<br/>without remuneration, and the office space and technical support is<br/>similarly given. The Journal subscriptions cover the cost of publication<br/>and the editors would happily print more frequently but the lack of<br/>submitted articles is chronic. In addition to his constant public pleas,<br/>Mr. Doty has more than once asked me directly for articles, and I regreat<br/>that I have not been able to oblige him more often.</p><p>A check through the list of subscribers to the Mills list revealed no<br/>anonymous posters. We are not discussing politics or religion here, and our<br/>controversies are aesthetic and scholarly. To my knowledge, there is no<br/>state on the planet that presently punishes one for the practice of music<br/>theory, so anonymity is really out of place.</p><p>Let me once publicly thank David B. Doty, Carola B. Anderson and Henry S.<br/>Rosenthal for continuing to make JIN and _1/1_ happen, and doing so with<br/>their own flair.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt, Germany</p></div><h3><a id=1988 href="#1988">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/1999 5:14:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I must agree and comment that 1/1 was essential to my understanding and love<br/>for Just Intonation and I proudly maintain all Back issues for the South East<br/>Just Intonation Society._-a generous gift from Guru Genovese.<br/>Resonate and Extenuate<br/>Pat Pagano<br/>SEJIS</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; If you like orange and blue, then you will love our new web site!<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; Onelist: Fostering connections and information exchange<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
