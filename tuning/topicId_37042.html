Unfortunately, I had misremembered the scale I mentioned in an<br/>earlier post (2057?) unless there is yet another one lurking in the back<br/>issues of the Journal of the Acoustic Society of America in the late<br/>40&apos;s and 50&apos;s. In any case, the reference to the scale I had in mind is<br/>T. E. Simonton. 1953. Integral Ratio Chromatic Temperament. JASA 25(6):<br/>1167. I&apos;m not quite sure of the date as my old index card is very faded<br/>-- it could be 1951 or even  1957. The scale is below and includes<br/>ratios of 5, being based on the sequence  (15:)16:17:18:19:20 as  1/1<br/>17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 17/12 3/2 19/12 5/3 16/9 17/9 2/1.</p><p> Replacing the 5/4 with 24/19 and the 5/3 with 32/19 produces Dan<br/>Stearn&apos;s scale in TD 2056. One can construct this scale by building the<br/>harmonic series 16:17:18:19 up from 1/1 and 4/3 and the corresponding<br/>subharmonc series down from 3/2 and 2/1. This procedure generates both<br/>of the tritone-flanking intervals 17/12 and 24/17, which differ by 6<br/>cents. Probably either could be used, or one might just as well use 600<br/>cents (square root of 2)  in place of  either for an error of only 3<br/>cents.</p><p>A somewhat similar scale is Wronski&apos;s, described on page 105 of Jocelyn<br/>Godwin&apos;s book &quot;Music and the Occult.&quot; Its ratios are 1/ 1 17/16  9/8<br/>85/72  5/4  4/3 17/12  51/32  27/16  85/48  17/9  2/1.</p><p>I discoverd that both of the above scales and 4 variants were in one of<br/>my JiCalc stacks (JCC) for  the Macs. Two 7-tone scales based on similar<br/>premises  have also been constructed by Dan and me and are in the stack<br/>as well.</p><p>--John</p></div>
