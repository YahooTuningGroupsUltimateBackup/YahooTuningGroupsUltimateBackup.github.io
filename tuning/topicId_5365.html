Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/1999 10:22:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to speak in favor of peace and tolerance on<br/>the Tuning List.</p><p>For debates on tuning to lead at time to personal conflict is not<br/>exactly new: consider, for example, Vicentino/Lusitano. However, I<br/>would like to urge that good will can at once cushion the dissonance<br/>of very substantial disagreements while encouraging more creative<br/>theorizing, composing, and music-making, rather than less auspicious<br/>tension at a personal level.</p><p>With musical issues, sometimes both &quot;sides&quot; have a point. As for<br/>Vicentino/Lusitano, I would give a split decision. With Lusitano (and<br/>Zarlino), I would agree that merely using the melodic interval or a<br/>minor or major third does not of itself shift a piece from the<br/>diatonic genus to the chromatic or enharmonic. With Vicentino, I would<br/>emphatically agree that the chromatic and enharmonic genera<br/>(distinguished by direct use of the small semitone and the diesis<br/>respectively -- speaking in a context of tertian just intonation or<br/>characteristic meantone) are musically compelling and most worthy of<br/>cultivation, in 1551 or 1999.</p><p>Of course, I can hardly be expected to reject mathematical discussions<br/>on the Tuning List, having engaged in them maybe more than enough. To<br/>borrow from Chaucer (and maybe Boccaccio also): if you don&apos;t like this<br/>tale, choose another.</p><p>Is it not possible to offer corrections to posts, by newcomers or<br/>others, in a spirit of friendship and helpfulness? While I may feel a<br/>bit embarrassed to have made an error, I much appreciate finding out<br/>about it -- and sometimes even an opponent can be one&apos;s best<br/>proofreader. Recently on Usenet, I defined a superparticular ratio as<br/>&quot;n+1:1&quot; -- meaning, of course, to write &quot;n+1:n&quot; (where n&gt;1). Someone<br/>helpfully corrected this, a real service both to readers and author.</p><p>Of course, in greeting a newcomer, we want to put our best foot<br/>forward and show that the contribution and contributor are warmly<br/>welcome, even if there are serious differences of view going beyond a<br/>typographical or mathematical slip of the keyboard. This seems to me a<br/>matter of tone as much as content. A seasonable correction can be<br/>taken as showing enough interest to read an article carefully and help<br/>in its improvement, even if one might be ready to debate basic<br/>premises.</p><p>When conducted civilly, impassioned debates can be very stimulating.<br/>Sometimes it can be especially exciting to see two disputants assist<br/>with each other&apos;s cases now and then even while maintaining their own<br/>viewpoints. The ideal of collegial disputations is something very<br/>attractive to me.</p><p>Finally, speaking only for myself, I&apos;d like to argue that the variety<br/>in English orthography is an attraction rather than flaw of this list.<br/>In the documents of the Elizabethan period, one often may see two or<br/>three spellings of the same word in the same document, so I have<br/>trouble getting too excited at this kind of variation now. While I lean<br/>myself toward conventionality in my own spelling, regretting what<br/>would be regarded as a mistake, I would also note the often informal<br/>and conversational nature of this list.</p><p>In short, I would like to advocate peace, diversity, friendliness in<br/>debate, and flexibility in dealing with the range of styles and idioms<br/>(musical and literary) encountered on this list.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=5367 href="#5367">ðŸ”—</a>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>10/8/1999 11:06:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/9/99 2:22:28 AM, <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;I would like to advocate peace, diversity, friendliness in<br/>&gt;debate, and flexibility in dealing with the range of styles and idioms<br/>&gt;(musical and literary) encountered on this list.</p><p>BIG DITTO &apos;ERE...</p></div>
