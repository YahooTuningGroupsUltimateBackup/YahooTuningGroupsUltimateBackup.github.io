Anyone here know who<br/>is responsible for Partches catalog? Many major artists have requested<br/>filtering since the judge ruled for this remedy. It seems to me that<br/>Partch needs to be filtered if they want to keep the CD sales going.<br/>&#x9;But then on the other hand, it would be good for sales, methinks, to<br/>allow trading of Partch that is not available on CD, as it would pique<br/>interest. &#x9;</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
