After a month and<br/>maybe more thinking about its global harmony I decided, for reasons you<br/>should be well awared of, to choose 72-TET (thanks Monzo ;o).  Quiet a<br/>problem for instrumentists though.  I seeking different than mine solutions.</p><p>Here what I propose seeing (for now) as the best solution even if I know<br/>that musicians won&apos;t be comfortable with it (anyway can they really be<br/>comfortable with 72-tet ?;o).</p><p>Most instrumentists (at my school) did well working over quarter tones. No<br/>problems up to here.  As I want my parts the easiest possible (damned will I<br/>be if not ;o) I decided that scordatura would be the best way to acheive my<br/>goal.  Agree?</p><p>Here how I plan doing it :</p><p>Group I : +16.7 cents over.<br/>Group II : 0.0 cents.<br/>Group III : -16.7 cents under.</p><p>So that as everyone are playing marvellously well quarter tones, I complete<br/>my tuning with [-16.7c + 50c =] +33.3c and so on.</p><p>I&apos;ll have three harpiscorde with two keyboards tuned 1/12th of tone of<br/>difference (that one is the easiest ;o) but long to tune, though !</p><p>The real problems are the six violins and the other strings grouped as I<br/>said above.  For the rests I&apos;ll have three oboes, sax and trombones...  The<br/>instrumentation isn&apos;t fixed yet.  I should have a positive (who is it called<br/>in english... a small organ tuned with factor 2 3 5 9 15 which will support<br/>the male choir)... and percussions...  Is there easy to have JI or 72-TET<br/>friendly percussions ??  Any ideas??   Ah!!! I was forgetting the 96-TET<br/>piano retuned in 72-TET !! ;o)</p><p>Anyway... I stop here.  If more experimented one can examine my setup... my<br/>theacher will do so, but I&apos;ll gladly accept others suggestions.</p><p>Thanks a lot!!!</p><p>Vincent-Olivier.</p><p>PS: my 96-TET piano piece should be recorded friday of this week !!!</p></div><h3><a id=24098 href="#24098">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 10:02:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Vog&quot; &lt;dunael@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here how I plan doing it :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Group I : +16.7 cents over.<br/>&gt; Group II : 0.0 cents.<br/>&gt; Group III : -16.7 cents under.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that as everyone are playing marvellously well quarter tones, I<br/>complete<br/>&gt; my tuning with [-16.7c + 50c =] +33.3c and so on.</p><p>Superb idea, Vincent-Olivier!

I was going to say the same thing<br/>to Vincent... I think this is a brilliant idea for making<br/>72-EDO practical  (I didn&apos;t know about Tenney doing this.)<br/>because he&apos;s right that, in general, most musicians can<br/>handle 1/4-tones without a problem.</p><p>Vincent, also you might keep in mind the terrific antiphonal<br/>possibilities of a set-up like this.  Think about the spatial<br/>arrangement of your variously-tuned groups, and how the<br/>different tunings could circulate around the physical locations.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=24110 href="#24110">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 2:41:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe, Paul, Vincent,</p><p>This is post from yesterday, did anyone see this?</p><p>I get this list over the net, and one of the big problems as I see it<br/>is that posts that don&apos;t ignite an immediate self-sustaining thread<br/>are almost immediately swallowed up into some dusty, far-flung corner<br/>of the archive -- goodnight, sleep tight, long gone, kaput!</p><p>Unfortunately, I doubt that there&apos;s really any way to combat this save<br/>reposting the same thing for an encore disappearing act.</p><p>This was why the Practical Microtonality list appealed to me, but that<br/>went up in a mushroom cloud of ridiculousness and I think it&apos;s going<br/>to be hard to get folks to line up behind another music-first type of<br/>splinter group now.</p><p>Anyway, here&apos;s the invisible post again, and PLEASE NOTE THAT THE<br/>FOLLOWING CONTAINS ACTUAL MUSIC IN 72 USING THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE<br/>RELEVANT TO THIS THREAD!</p><p>One of the other fortuitous realities of 72&apos;s relation to 12 is that<br/>composers can explore certain aspects of 72 on traditional instruments<br/>in standard notation so long as the instruments overall intonation can<br/>be shimmied up or down by increments (or tuning units) of 72.</p><p>For a monochromatic example of just this, and a good long soak in 72,<br/>go here:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/491/491153.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/491/491153.html</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/491/491182.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/491/491182.html</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/491/491202.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/491/491202.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Note -- In a private email correspondence with Seth Josel that I<br/>forwarded to the list several months ago he mistakenly cited the<br/>tuning alterations in this piece as tuning units of 36 and not 72 (he<br/>was on the road without any reference materials and it had been<br/>several years since he had played the piece).
