For example, the natural resonances of just intervals lead one most<br/>&gt;naturally to what kind of pentatonic scale? A just one? No.</p><p>I would say this grossly depends on how the pentatonic scale is going to be<br/>used.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2000 1:12:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; OK -- with the most informationless prior about how it&apos;s going<br/>&gt; to be used, one finds that tempering it is best.

Both lists start with two ratios of<br/>&gt;three. But then, my scale has one ratio of 3 for every ratio of 5 in your<br/>&gt;scale and one ratio of 5 for every ratio of 7 in your scale. Finally, both<br/>&gt;scales have 3 intervals that are dissonant in the 7-limit. So my scale<br/>&gt;clearly wins, and the small about of tempering required doesn&apos;t change that<br/>&gt;result.</p><p>Thanks- that&apos;s as I suspected.  I have no problem with averaging the<br/>inversions for _this_ result, but unless you specify that you intend the<br/>scale to convey different fundamentals with mode changes (per my original<br/>complaint), then my scale must have a lower overall harmonic entropy than<br/>yours, since it&apos;s simply a saturated 9-limit otonal chord.  I suggest this<br/>would be reflected by a true higher-adic harmonic entropy measure.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 12:36:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks- that&apos;s as I suspected.

I&apos;m big on saying<br/>so.  Surely, lots of interesting stuff can happen by subsetting a series<br/>over a fundamental.  I&apos;ve enjoyed this at various points in Carter<br/>Scholz&apos;s work.  Denny used to play the resonant filter on the ARP 2500.<br/>Ozric uses the effect in many synth gurgles.  If music is imitation-speech,<br/>then perhaps this is the most basic type of music, but hardly the least<br/>desirable.</p><p>&gt;&gt;(per my original complaint), then my scale must have a lower overall<br/>&gt;&gt;harmonic entropy than yours, since it&apos;s simply a saturated 9-limit otonal<br/>&gt;&gt;chord.
