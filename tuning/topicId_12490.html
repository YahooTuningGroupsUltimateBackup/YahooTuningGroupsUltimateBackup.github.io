An example is 1:3:5:15.<br/>For your scale the guide tone is a very high number. Because it&apos;s<br/>higher than 2^31, Scala doesn&apos;t compute it. Such a high number is<br/>meaningless.</p><p>Rothenberg&apos;s stability is defined as the portion of the intervals<br/>which are unique to one interval class, out of all possible intervals.<br/>For example the major scale in 12-tET has a stability of 20/21,<br/>because there are 2 occurrences of the 600 cents tritone, one for<br/>interval class 3 and one for 4 (do SHOW INTERVALS or SHOW/TOTAL<br/>INTERVALS to see this). There are 6*7 intervals so the stability is<br/>(42-2)/42.</p><p>The odd number limit listed in your post is wrong. It should be 841<br/>(O: 841 U: 713) for your scale. This bug will be fixed in the next<br/>release.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
