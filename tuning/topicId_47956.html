And retuned, by my piano tuner, to Thomas Young 1799.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I wonder if I&apos;ve got the only Disklavier<br/>&gt;&gt;tuned to well temperament, but maybe not.</p><p>&gt;Definitely not.</p><p>That&apos;s too tantalizing - who else is doing computerized acoustic piano with historical tunings? Any names?</p><p>&gt;Wow, there&apos;s a ton of great stuff here, that apparently<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t on your cd (you&apos;ve also mentioned the magic words,<br/>&gt;&quot;Thelonius Monk&quot; -- hey, what were you doing in<br/>&gt;Lewisburg?).</p><p>Thanks. I lived in Lewisburg, PA, for 14 years - adjunct teaching at Bucknell (where my wife also worked) and commuting to New York.</p><p>&gt;By the way, your choice of text and background colors<br/>&gt;makes your page hard to read.</p><p>It must depend on the screen, because you&apos;re only the second person to mention that. But I&apos;ve lightened up the background a little. Hope that&apos;s easier. My site&apos;s in a transitional phase. I need a virtual interior decorator.</p><p>&gt;Interestingly, I think it was your site that turned me<br/>&gt;on to Conlon Nancarrow&apos;s work, in 1996-7ish. Thanks<br/>&gt;for that!</p><p>Glad to hear it. You&apos;re welcome! And thanks for listening!</p><p>Aaron, loved the stuff you directed me to off-line, especially the modulations in the 19tet Juggler piece. I&apos;ll download them for my tunings class next semester.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2003 10:32:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Definitely not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;That&apos;s too tantalizing - who else is doing computerized acoustic<br/>&gt;&gt;piano with historical tunings?
