My &quot;mystery&quot;<br/>&gt; has to do with an apparent singer preference for the high third in either or<br/>&gt; both. I hope I didn&apos;t give the impression that I believe the 4:5:6 triad is<br/>&gt; not the &quot;real one.&quot; I simply would like to explore possible rationalizations<br/>&gt; regarding the other one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, IF the &quot;high third&quot; was 14/11, AND the minor seventh was 7/4, then<br/>you get an 11/8 between them... for some reason, I think I&apos;ll want some<br/>extra water with that.</p><p>Otherwise, numerical fiddling gets me into &quot;high sevenths&quot; to go along with<br/>the &quot;high third&quot;.</p><p>Do you also have low sevenths (7/4) and high sevenths (9/5 or 16/9 or<br/>some such???)</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
