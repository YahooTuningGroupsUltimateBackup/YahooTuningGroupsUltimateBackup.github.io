My question may sound dumb and obvious, let me clarify.</p><p>Do you think the timing and tuning of blues is in itself expressive in</p><p>a different way than other aural-based folk traditions, or is it</p><p>uniquely expressive only within its culture?</p><p>Let me clarify once more.  Does a Ukrainian folk singer, well versed</p><p>in subtle details of his aural tradition, find blues to have something</p><p>particularly unique compared to any other aural tradition that is</p><p>foreign to him?  Is the subtlety of expression in his tradition vs</p><p>blues comparable or no?  Would a Ukrainian and a blues guy each trying</p><p>each other&apos;s tradition feel equally uncertain of the other or judge</p><p>each other equally inauthentic?</p><p>I guess my point is this:</p><p>I think that there are absolute theoretical things within blues that</p><p>are totally valid to understand.  Use of 7th harmonics has a clearly</p><p>bluesy feeling.  But deviating from pure harmonies or from the simple</p><p>shell of the form is clearly part of the tradition as well.  My</p><p>feeling is that the things that are special to blues compared to other</p><p>aural traditions CAN be discussed theoretically.  I&apos;d assert that any</p><p>aspect of blues that cannot be easily discussed theoretically is</p><p>either common to aural traditions in general, or is arbitrary to the</p><p>culture (not important that it is one way or another, just that people</p><p>got used to it being one particular way).</p><p>I totally agree about the classical interpretations of blues -</p><p>nonsense awful junk.  However, the idea of &quot;authentic&quot; blues is harder</p><p>to pin down since it is an evolving aural tradition.  Everyone has</p><p>slightly different ideas about what does or doesn&apos;t exist in &quot;blues.&quot;</p><p> I am not a total blues guy, and my degree is classical guitar, but I</p><p>was raised on blues to some degree, have listened to a very wide range</p><p>of blues from pop to obscure, and am very influenced by guitarists who</p><p>themselves are blues influenced (such as my hero Frank Zappa).  I am</p><p>not a classical interpreter of blues by any means.  I do not think in</p><p>any sort of classical way about what I play when I&apos;m playing blues,</p><p>but I may think theoretically at times.</p><p>Anyway, blues being an American style, I&apos;d argue that the language</p><p>relationships (which are definitely there) are very influenced by</p><p>English in addition to the African language roots.  Most blues is</p><p>certainly sung in English.</p><p>As for theory, it seems to me that harmonic intervals - particularly</p><p>7th harmonic relatives - seem to be the foundational grid for a lot of</p><p>blues, and what you are saying about not applying theory is more about</p><p>not being strict to the grid.  Classical musicians are often not free</p><p>enough with interpretations.  The blues feel isn&apos;t just playing a</p><p>stiff 7th harmonic, but deviating around it expressively.  But I think</p><p>there are still focal points around which deviation happens, and both</p><p>those points as well as the forms of deviation can be discussed</p><p>theoretically.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Aaron Wolf</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, &lt;microstick@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;    Actually, I&apos;ve played blues for so long (over 40 years), that I</p><p>don&apos;t think much about the theory behind it...I just DO it. And, in</p><p>many years of reading interviews with great blues artists, I can&apos;t</p><p>recall ever seeing one of them discuss how they arrive at the pitches</p><p>they use. I am also a bit wary these days of overanalyzing a culture&apos;s</p><p>music (or anything else) when one is not part of that culture...sure,</p><p>we can learn a lot by reading, and that&apos;s often the only way to learn</p><p>about a subject. But, being a part of something is way different than</p><p>trying to analyze it from afar, for the most part.</p><p>&gt;    That being said, there are 2 really interesting books on blues</p><p>with valuable info...&quot;Africa and the Blues&quot; (Gerhard Kubik), and &quot;Deep</p><p>Blues,&quot; by Robert Palmer. Both make the observation that the &quot;blue&quot;</p><p>notes could be related to the African concept of language and music</p><p>being related; pitches are very fluid here, and the pitch of a spoken</p><p>word gives it different meanings (and of course this is found in other</p><p>cultures as well). The &quot;blue&quot; notes (and this is a term used by</p><p>writers and observers, not by the artists) are often flat to the</p><p>Western idea of where the pitch lies, and can really add depth and</p><p>meaning to blues phrases. And, where you put a pitch, even in the same</p><p>song, can change from performance to performance. ..it all depends on</p><p>the FEELING you are trying to convey.</p><p>&gt;    In the book &quot;Louis Armstrong&apos;s New Orleans,&quot; Louis talks about</p><p>hanging out with the rag pickers, and how they played cheap bugles to</p><p>draw the kids around. The pitches they played were not at all like</p><p>Western notes, for the most part. And, in the same book, it is</p><p>mentioned that certain people sounded like they were singing when they</p><p>talked. This makes big sense to me...but, I totally learned blues from</p><p>copying other players, and then from playing a great deal of blues in</p><p>live situations. And of course, this is how Arabic and Indian music</p><p>has been taught for a long time...listen and copy, then develop your</p><p>own thing.</p><p>&gt;    As far as &quot;neutral&quot; 3rds, flat 5ths and 7ths...I can put those</p><p>pitches where I want 100% of the time, but there&apos;s a lot more &quot;blue&quot;</p><p>notes than those, that&apos;s for sure. Most of my students are blues guys,</p><p>and for the most part, hitting those &quot;blue&quot; notes is VERY</p><p>difficult... it has to be done by feel, and any sort of intellectual</p><p>knowledge of ratios would be of no help whatsoever. And, I&apos;m not</p><p>against understanding the theory behind blues, it&apos;s good fun. And, you</p><p>can&apos;t fake blues...within seconds, it&apos;s obvious to tell if someone</p><p>knows what the hell they&apos;re doing...it isn&apos;t just the pitches, either;</p><p>it&apos;s the rhythms and timing, which are just as difficult as the</p><p>pitches. (hearing classically trained folks try to play blues or jazz</p><p>is a hoot). Anyway, a few thoughts...best. ..Hstick   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/">myspace.com/</a> microstick</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;</p></div>
