Possibly Otonality<br/>are also as I understand they are always a bit off from this ideal in nature. The important<br/>thing is that we have found these chords and scales extremely musical useful. In regard to the<br/>phenomenon of Utonal sonorities resolving to Otonality has been more of a nuisance to many of<br/>us. These Otonality  chords stop the movement by their &quot;sitting there&quot;. You are welcome to<br/>test all you like,  but like the tarot, I think more is gained by a daily acquaintance, than<br/>the statistical analysis of their Cabalistic numerical relations. The Utonality series is<br/>filled with mystery and it is no wonder it was found on the Aulos. Something my dear spiritual<br/>sister Kathleen Schlesinger discussed in detail, only to be dismissed on trivial grounds<br/>hiding the gender bias of the &quot;Scholars&quot;. There is the element of &quot;irrationality&quot; ( in the<br/>greek sense) in the subharmonic series, it works but can&apos;t really be explained or compared<br/>side by side to the chords of Apollo. Dionysus is too a god of music, that will take his<br/>vengeance upon the musical Penteus if they get in his way.<br/>                                                                        Banaphshu</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Paul and all...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I&apos;m understanding everything correctly from the posts, it seems as<br/>&gt; though several people... Paul Erlich, formost, but also Joe Monzo, don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really feel there is a solid acoustical basis for perceiving<br/>&gt; relationships of utonal chords through their &quot;higher&quot; ratios or from the<br/>&gt; &quot;guide tone.&quot;  I believe this is also what George Kahrimanis was trying<br/>&gt; to research.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, wrong?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The utonal chords are therefore totally a &quot;fabrication&quot; or construct...<br/>&gt; kind of like the serial 12-tone system.... a system which clearly can be<br/>&gt; learned for composition, but which is not inherently &quot;natural&quot; to the<br/>&gt; acoustical sound world... although some can &quot;stretch&quot; a justification to<br/>&gt; try to explain it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that the folks over at Anaphoria disagree with this<br/>&gt; assessment.<br/>&gt; ,................<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
