For b-b-b, I find:</p><p>b-b-bjcs5.mid: Bend range applied: -14.0707 to  14.0739<br/>b-b-bjes2.mid: Bend range applied: -16.7419 to  15.1923<br/>b-b-bjcs7.mid: Bend range applied: -18.6853 to  18.7531</p><p>Notice how much more deviation the &quot;no tuning file&quot; version has than<br/>the original 5-limit tuning!  This is due, no doubt, to what has to<br/>happen when two minor thirds, each targeting almost 16 cents more than<br/>12-tET, are stacked together.  The tritone thus formed targets an<br/>interval more than 31 cents wider than 12-tET, pushing the deviations<br/>accordingly.</p><p>I&apos;m coming to think that, in spite of the desirable purity of the minor<br/>thirds in the &quot;no tuning file&quot; versions, the original 5-limit tunings<br/>are superior because they have less horizontal motion.  If pure<br/>intervals are the main goal, I would submit that 7-limit is the best<br/>answer (at the obvious cost of the greatest amount of horizontal<br/>motion).</p><p>Of course, as always, individual taste must be the main criterion for<br/>choosing the best treatment.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=18671 href="#18671">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2001 12:29:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m coming to think that, in spite of the desirable purity of the<br/>&gt;&gt;minor thirds in the &quot;no tuning file&quot; versions, the original 5-limit<br/>&gt;&gt;tunings are superior because they have less horizontal motion.</p><p>[Paul E wrote:]<br/>&gt;John, don&apos;t confuse deviations from 12-tET with horizontal motion.
