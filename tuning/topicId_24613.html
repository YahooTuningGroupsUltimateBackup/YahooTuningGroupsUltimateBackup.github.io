For<br/>those that are still working on that &apos;home studio&apos;, or are new to the<br/>area of interest, is everyone aware that there is a pretty amazing<br/>*free* offer from Pro Tools?</p><p><a href="http://www.digidesign.com/ptfree/">http://www.digidesign.com/ptfree/</a></p><p>An industry standard piece of software. From their website:</p><p>&quot;Get Pro Tools FREE and experience the power and flexibility of Pro<br/>Tools&reg;. Using your computer&apos;s built-in sound capability, Pro Tools<br/>FREE offers up to 8 tracks of audio and 48 tracks of MIDI, real-time<br/>plug-ins, and many of the same editing and mixing features the pros<br/>use.&quot;</p><p>While you are at it, you could try out the demo version of the plug-<br/>in Pitch&apos;nTime, which (according to a colleague) is an astonishing<br/>new algorithm to alter time and/or pitch content of an audio track<br/>(not midi) with far less anomolies and artifacts then any previous<br/>stab at this.
