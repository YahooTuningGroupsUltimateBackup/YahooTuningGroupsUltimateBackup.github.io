Tonal Plexus keyboards feature 211 keys per octave, 32 user programmable tuning tables, and a default master tuning based on the limits of human pitch perception. The synthesizer option includes a powerful 22 watt stereo amplifier with speakers, and hardware control of synthesis waveform envelope attack, decay and release, as well as a 3-band equalizer, panning, volume, modulation, and key velocity. These smaller keyboards also feature octave transposing buttons, allowing realtime full navigation of 8 octaves of each tuning table with sustain pedal support. DIP switch settings allow for a global pitch-bend mode in which the modulation control affects the global pitch in the same way as a standard pitch bend control, allowing global control of gliding pitches. A velocity bandwidth feature allows the non-velocity sensing keys to produce natural sounding output by varying the key velocity with a choice of three bandwidths as specified by the user. Fully compatible with GM equipment, each Tonal Plexus keyboard can be used to control external synthesizers, for full pitch control of favorite synth sounds on existing gear.</p><p>More information on H-Pi products and email contact may be found at <a href="http://www.h-pi.com">www.h-pi.com</a></p><p>H-Pi Instruments is a legally registered business in the State of Illinois, founded in 2006, operating under the sole proprietorship of Aaron Andrew Hunt.</p><p>1010 10th Street, Charleston, IL 61920-2822</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2007 6:30:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Andrew Hunt &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; CHARLESTON, Illinois, USA (October 13, 2007)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; H-Pi Instruments begins shipping TPX/2/4/s Tonal Plexus microtonal<br/>&gt; keyboard synthesizers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tonal Plexus keyboards are now shipping...</p><p>This looked very intriguing, but your link is to your desktop and not<br/>a web resource.

There is instead<br/>as you say a user controlled velocity by way of fader<br/>control or pedal control, which works in conjunction with a<br/>selectable bandwidth of + / - 5, 10 or 15 MIDI values<br/>from immediate position, which produces quite natural<br/>sounding output. The playing technique is unique.<br/>Although the configuration has parrallels to halberstadt,<br/>since the keys are small, the playing technique is<br/>not the same. Velocity sensing quite honestly would<br/>not add so very much to the expressivity that is already<br/>available using the controls and features as described.<br/>Moreover, to have velocity sensing would require the cost<br/>to be at least 3, probably 4 times what you see now, which<br/>we do not find at all realistic for the market.</p><p>I should mention that it is possible to pass MIDI into the<br/>keyboard with some other velocity sensitive controller, so<br/>it is possible to move back and forth between TP and a<br/>normal keyboard plugged into MIDI IN.</p><p>There is also the option of using a standard MIDI keyboard<br/>with TBX1. It&apos;s a lot cheaper than the Tonal Plexus, and<br/>you get to keep velocity sensing.</p><p>&gt; I guess with your keyboard, Aaron, you have vertical movements for<br/>&gt; chromatic<br/>&gt; passages and probably some diagonal movements might provide interesting<br/>&gt; patterns which can probably extend 2 dimensions to 4 or 5 while still<br/>&gt; keeping the traditional and desired pattern of the piano.</p><p>Suffice it for now to say that pitch rises left to right and bottom<br/>to top. More videos are on the way.</p><p>&gt; Your tuning definition (0.01 cent) is also better than for example<br/>&gt; the Microzone (0.1?)</p><p>This specification refers to the internal synth. For external<br/>gear it depends on the pitch bend resolution of that gear.</p><p>&gt; 1) In general there are 16 channels with 128 notes each makes a total<br/>&gt; of 2048<br/>&gt; notes. Is this the maximum number of samples I could ever aim using<br/>&gt; the MIDI standards?</p><p>Different sample players have different limitations, so it depends.<br/>This is not determined by the Plexus.</p><p>&gt; Is it possible to use more than 16 channels live?</p><p>In general? Yes, with a multi-port MIDI interface.</p><p>&gt; 2) Will you have just the 1688 notes Midi keyboard available without<br/>&gt; the synth built in<br/>&gt; for December?</p><p>Yes, but December is the tentative date. It may have to<br/>change.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) Can I have a custom made with more than 1688 notes? ...if so what<br/>&gt; is the limit of notes (switches)?</p><p>Depends what you mean by custom. Using Plexus octaves the<br/>answer is NO. If you want an entirely new larger octave PCB<br/>with more switches on it, and you want to pay<br/>the thousands needed for designing and producing it,<br/>then yes it can be done, up to 256 keys per octave,<br/>2048 keys total.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4)Can I control 1688 samples at the time linked to Capybara with the<br/>&gt; 1688 notes keyboard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5)Can I control 1688 samples at the time linked to Logic Pro with the<br/>&gt; 1688 notes keyboard?</p><p>I won&apos;t comment on numbers of samples, etc., because this is not<br/>determined by the Tonal Plexus; it is determined by your computer,<br/>hardware, etc. - all external to the keyboard. But I can say that<br/>TP will send 1688 unique note messages to external hardware,<br/>either tuned with pitchbend or in raw note/channel values, to<br/>control samples and retune them without you ever having to<br/>mess with sample retuning, or by accessing samples you<br/>have already retuned.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6) If 4 and 5 OK, can I compose with the software and then use the<br/>&gt; MIDI files<br/>&gt; to play the music in Logic Pro and Capybara without having make<br/>&gt; changes to<br/>&gt; the MIDI file (Once I have set up an exs instrument the required way)?</p><p>Yes, again qualified as above.<br/>Check out one of the MIDI files from the downloads page to<br/>see what a MIDI file made with a Plexus might look like.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>There is also an H-Pi user forum you may want to join.<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=2">http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=2</a>&gt;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 2007/10/16, at 13:54, Aaron Andrew Hunt wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Tony.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are 2 and 4 octave keyboards shipping:<br/>&gt; &gt; http:///www.h-pi.com/TPX28intro.html<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Every key can be retuned.

The synthesizer option<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; includes a powerful 22 watt stereo amplifier with speakers, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hardware control of synthesis waveform envelope attack, decay and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; release, as well as a 3-band equalizer, panning, volume,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulation, and key velocity. These smaller keyboards also feature<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; octave transposing buttons, allowing realtime full navigation of 8<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; octaves of each tuning table with sustain pedal support. DIP<br/>&gt; &gt; switch<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; settings allow for a global pitch-bend mode in which the<br/>&gt; &gt; modulation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; control affects the global pitch in the same way as a standard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pitch bend control, allowing global control of gliding pitches. A<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity bandwidth feature allows the non-velocity sensing keys to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; produce natural sounding output by varying the key velocity with a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice of three bandwidths as specified by the user. Fully<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compatible with GM equipment, each Tonal Plexus keyboard can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to control external synthesizers, for full pitch control of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; favorite synth sounds on existing gear.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
