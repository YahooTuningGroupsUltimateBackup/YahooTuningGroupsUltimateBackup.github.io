Up to that point it seemed to be pretty much the same<br/>&gt;music repeated over and over and over and over.<br/>It changes significantly over its 5 or so hours. He developes small<br/>harmonic motifs throughout, only occasionally revisiting previous ones.<br/>The rhythmic and dynamic material is pretty similar, though. A friend of<br/>mine aptly compared it to a Wagner opera because of its epic proportion<br/>and its use of the small &quot;leitmotives&quot;.</p></div>
