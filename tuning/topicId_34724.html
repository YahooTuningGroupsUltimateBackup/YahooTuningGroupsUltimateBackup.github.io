It was a little surprising to see so<br/>many topics discussed that have been discussed recently, but I<br/>suppose it *shouldn&apos;t* be so surprising, as these are main issues<br/>that rather &quot;recycle...&quot; with different elaborations and viewpoints.<br/>It would be interesting if the *dates* of these discussions, or at<br/>least &quot;groups&quot; of discussions were included.  I didn&apos;t see any.</p><p>I assume from the above you mean that if the *entire* thing is open<br/>it will mean that, on the overall, there will be more presence of it<br/>on search engines.  I suppose that&apos;s preferable, then.</p><p>However, when people *do* find it, how would they know to contact<br/>*you?*</p><p>Maybe there should be some kind of &quot;explanation&quot; with your e-mail<br/>address or some such so that people would know to contact you if they<br/>wanted to &quot;opt in.&quot;</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the only place that the &quot;old&quot; Mills posts<br/>are publicly available...</p><p>Thanks for the resource!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=34771 href="#34771">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2002 5:09:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; That would be good--it starts out as the Bill&amp;Paul Show.

My archiving program could find all the e-mail addresses from the<br/>&quot;From&quot; fields (easy to do by looking for xxx@yyy.zzz), and send them all e-mails<br/>(it can do that too), which would be a possible way to try to get in touch, but<br/>I don&apos;t know how people would feel about that...</p><p>However the last archive went high in the Google searches, so if that happens<br/>again, it just needs someone to search for a microtonal term to become aware<br/>of it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=34900 href="#34900">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 12:09:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To my knowledge, this is the only place that the &quot;old&quot; Mills posts<br/>&gt; are publicly available...</p><p>except for the *very oldest ones*, a year or so worth, which are on<br/>the mills website.</p><p>with no censorship, mind you!</p></div>
