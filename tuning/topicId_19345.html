Please accept my<br/>response as representing earnest interest in discerning the truth for<br/>Gesualdo.  If passion takes hold, forgive me.  I very much look forward to<br/>Part II.</p><p>Blackwood make his points by measuring distinctions produced by tiny<br/>intervals, presumed to be based on an extended meantone keyboard design.<br/>Blackwood&apos;s example, quoted by Margo, shows a C, B, B# in the soprano and<br/>explains it intonationally as a B# tuned a &quot;quartertone&quot; (or fifthtone) above<br/>the B natural.  In contrast to a meantone/keyboard explanation for intoning<br/>Gesualdo, I find it more natural for musicians to calculate differently,<br/>using a different method of calculating pitch, one apparently practiced in<br/>the period according to material provided by Margo.</p><p>However, the performance technique that makes the most sense to me is to look<br/>to the alto of this example.  The alto E (root) will make a 6/5 minor third<br/>ascent to a G#.  The B# in the soprano will be built and based on the reality<br/>of the G#.  The B# will be sung a 5/4 above the G# which is the new root of a<br/>triad.</p><p>Speaking of triads, it is not the best tool for analyzing the contrapuntal<br/>music that features voice leading over function.  The voice leading that was<br/>paramount in the late renaissance through the baroque makes a discussion in<br/>terms of chords indelicate at best.  Blackwood&apos;s comparing different sizes of<br/>semitones as a way to indicate significance in musical change is a case of<br/>looking at minutiae.  It may be the pure triad that the Picardy third<br/>Italians really want and use to keep melodic lines together.</p><p>Temperament is recognized as a compromise for modulation, first for keyboards<br/>and then further.  Carlo Gesualdo is not one to compromise.  I feel it in my<br/>gut.  Writing for keyboard and writing for a cappella voices are very<br/>different things, and composing for them should, and I think does reflect<br/>that difference.  The fact that scientist and philosopher Benedetti wrote of<br/>comma differences, even offering an alternative with Vicentino&apos;s designs is<br/>insignificant in this light.  Yes, he measured it, one of the first, but<br/>apparently drift was wide spread and no one had before complained.  In fact,<br/>nothing in Margo&apos;s essay gave direct evidence that there was any &quot;vice versus<br/>virtue&quot; position taken.</p><p>In lieu of an accompanying keyboard, or a score knowledge of other parts in<br/>part singing, it was veritably the sureness, or lock of the major or minor<br/>chords that joined the Italian renaissance singers together in euphony.<br/>Additionally, the 5 pure vowels of the Italian language are ideal for the<br/>rich 5-limit harmonies in the voice&apos;s tone.  By keeping pure chords, as they<br/>still do in neighboring Sardinian folk music, they could navigate through<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s wider expanses expressed through chromatic notation.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/23/2001 4:03:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the performance technique that makes the most sense to me<br/>is to look<br/>&gt; to the alto of this example.
