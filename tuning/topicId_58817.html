Just Intonation Explained - Kyle Gann, 1997<br/>  b.. The Forms of Tonality - a preview - Paul Erlich, 2001<br/>  c.. A gentle introduction to Fokker periodicity blocks - Paul Erlich, 1999<br/>  d.. HEWM notation (in TonalSoft Encyclopedia of Tuning) - Joe Monzo, 2004<br/>  e.. The Noble Mediant &iuml;&iquest;&half; Complex ratios and metastable musical intervals -<br/>Margo Schulter and David Keenan, 2000<br/>  f.. The fretting of the Arab lute - Joe Monzo, 1998<br/>  g.. Optimising JI guitar designs using linear microtemperaments &iuml;&iquest;&half; Dave<br/>Keenan, 2003, revised May 2005<br/>but not the following (ran out of time) -<br/>  a.. Joe Monzo&apos;s book (minus diagrams) in PDF format<br/>  b.. Dave Benson&apos;s book on music and maths, in PDF format<br/>I also didn&apos;t try rereading various papers of Erv Wilson&apos;s, from the archive<br/>at Anaphoria, because I find them almost unreadable - very low contrast<br/>manuscript plays havoc with my eyesight!

His relationship to Kornerup is interesting in that if you carry Yassers series you end up with Kornerups fifth. The two argure who did it first. Even though the later parts of the book would not be useful to most, his conceptional thinking is still with us in many ways</p><p>Mandlebaums PH.D Thesis<br/>Multiple division of the octive and the tonal resources of 19 tone temperment 1961<br/>Despite Mandelbaum favoring 19 ET at the time. he is quite objective about all type of other subdivisions and has a firm grasp on the work of other before him. It is filled with multiple gems especially Viggo Brun Algorithm which is a great scale generating method that often produces scales other systems by pass on the way.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard had mentioned that this might appear on line- if not, i would be willing to put it up myself.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/2/2005 8:31:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/2/2005 9:53:44 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a> writes:<br/>Johnny Reinhard had mentioned that this might appear on line- if not, i<br/>would be willing to put it up myself.<br/>I have scanned some of the thesis and might be able to send as much as there<br/>is, but the project was discontinued.
