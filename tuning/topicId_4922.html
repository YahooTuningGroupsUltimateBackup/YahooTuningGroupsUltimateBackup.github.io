Darren, I doubt you&apos;ll wind up with sine tones, considering the<br/>parking-lot horns you&apos;ll be playing the thing thru, but even if you do,<br/>there isn&apos;t a shred of reason to believe the carillon couldn&apos;t be a<br/>wonderfully musical and satisfying instrument.  I can&apos;t imagine someone<br/>failing to notice it was alternately tuned.  As for being a poor<br/>demonstration of JI, well... so were most of Partch&apos;s instruments.  Utonal<br/>chords fun compositionally?  You bet.  Even without them, the otonal chords<br/>will enjoy the common-tone arrangement of the diamond.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=4924 href="#4924">ðŸ”—</a>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/1999 8:03:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma:<br/>&gt;This has got to take the non-sequitur cake for the last few issues of<br/>&gt;digest.

The<br/>parameter rapidly increases outside that range. Most musical instuments produce<br/>harmonic partials in this range, so the 1% can be assumed to apply across a wide<br/>range of frequencies. But for sine tones, one gets no help from harmonic partials,<br/>so the relevant parameter value will usually be quite a bit higher.</p><p>&gt;&gt;remember, pitch resolution is poor (I would say in the 50 cent ballpark)<br/>&gt;&gt;with sine waves (experiment: play a familiar melody (just one voice) in<br/>&gt;&gt;several different tunings using sine waves.
