He leaves something like 500 compositions, most of<br/>them large-scale --- not quite as astonishing, you might think, as the 700<br/>or so of the Dane Niels Viggo Bentzon, who died at the end of April, until<br/>you consider that in 1943 Hovhaness destroyed almost all of his earlier<br/>works, generally estimated to have numbered over a thousand.<br/> A composer with such a voluminous output is not going to be able to produce<br/>a succession of faultless masterpieces: there will be rough with the smooth.<br/>At worst, Hovhaness&Otilde; music seems to run on autopilot, to ramble on in an<br/>Ancient-Mariner manner without bothering to engage the attention of the<br/>listener. At best, it is transcendantly beautiful, spinning long, weightless<br/>lines that enchant the ear --- often simplicity itself, but touching<br/>something in the soul. And at all times, it sounds like no one else&Otilde;s: its<br/>synthesis of east and west is instantly recognisable.<br/>Hovhaness was born in Massachusetts in 1911, to an Armenian father, who had<br/>immigrated from Turkey, and a Scottish mother. He began to compose when he<br/>was a mere four years old and devised his own system of notation (on an<br/>eleven-line stave) when he was five. Forbidden to play his mother&Otilde;s<br/>harmonium, he turned to astronomy, but music re-asserted itself when he was<br/>seven. Although at eight he was allowed to take piano lessons, his parents<br/>disapproved of his composing: he had written two operas by the time he was<br/>thirteen, and yet, as he later admitted, &quot;I was a secret composer all<br/>through my teens&quot;. The subterfuge to which he was pushed took some<br/>unpredictable forms:</p><p>My family thought writing music was abnormal, so they would confiscate my<br/>music if they caught me in the act. I used to compose in the bathroom and<br/>hide the manuscripts under the bathtub.</p><p>Another ruse --- writing at night --- developed into a lifetime&Otilde;s habit: as<br/>an adult Hovhaness generally slept until early afternoon when he would rise<br/>and start to work, generally through the night.<br/>Hovhaness studied at Tufts University, Boston, where his father was a<br/>professor chemistry, from 1929 to 1932; his composition teacher there was<br/>Frederick Converse. In 1942 he took composition lessons with the migr<br/>Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu at Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston<br/>Symphony Orchestra. Although he held a handful of posts --- organist of the<br/>Armenian Church of St James in Boston in the 1940s, member of the faculty of<br/>the New England Conservatory from 1948 to 1951 --- his life was basically<br/>given over to the writing of music, and later appointments were more<br/>congenial: composer-in-residence at the University of Hawaii in 1962 and<br/>with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra in 1966. He settled in Seattle in 1972.<br/> The rejection of his early works in 1943 (influenced, Hovhaness guessed, by<br/>that earlier parental censure) was triggered by a deep study of early<br/>Armenian religious music, which permanently marked his style from then on.<br/>He adopted elements from other musical cultures --- Indian, Japanese,<br/>Chinese and Korean among them --- but it was the modal melos of Armenia that<br/>dominated. And though he stuck with the forms of the western tradition ---<br/>symphony, sonata, concerto --- he had little time for the developmental<br/>struggles of the sonata-form archetype of the Classical and Romantic<br/>periods; like the Renaissance composers he admired, Hovhaness preferred to<br/>unfold his music. It is not for listeners in a hurry.<br/> Hovhaness enjoyed some success in the 1950s, when Stokowski and Reiner took<br/>up his music, before the stylistic monopoly of modernism pushed it to the<br/>sidelines. He stuck to his guns; for him atonality was &quot;against nature&quot;:</p><p>There is a center in everything that exists. The planets have the Sun; the<br/>Moon, the Earth. The reason I like Oriental music is that everything has a<br/>firm center. All music with a center is tonal. Music without a center is<br/>fine for a minute or two, but it soon sounds all the same. I&Otilde;ve used all<br/>techniques, including the 12-tone technique, but I believe melody is the<br/>spring of music. The human voice was the first instrument, and I believe<br/>that all the different instruments are voices as well. So I want to give<br/>them melodies to sing. I think melodically, and without melody I don&Otilde;t have<br/>much interest in music.</p><p>Those melodies, though, were often expressed in exotic scales, and were<br/>combined with the canonic, imitative and fugal techniques of Baroque<br/>counterpoint; Hovhaness also brought in modernist devices, such as<br/>tone-clusters and aleatory --- indeed, one favourite trick was the gradual<br/>imposition of metre on a rhythmically free passage to create the impression<br/>of order emerging from chaos.<br/>From the 1980s onwards, as the serialist strangehold was loosened, Hovhaness<br/>had the satisfaction of seeing his music win widespread approval, his<br/>mystical vein touching the new-age aspirations of the day as the Estonian<br/>Arvo Prt and Pole Henryk Grecki did some years later. He was soon one of<br/>the best-known of all American composers.<br/> Hovhaness was a tall, gaunt figure, whose long fingers gave him<br/>considerable fluency at the keyboard; he often conducted his own music, too.<br/>In spite of his shyness, he was married six times, although his marital<br/>history became a source of embarrassment when he finally found happiness<br/>with the Japanese soprano Hinako Fujihara, whom he wedded in 1977. He could<br/>be voluble in private; the composer Arnold Rosner, who wrote his PhD thesis<br/>on Hovhaness&Otilde; music, found him obliging but distant:</p><p>When I needed a manuscript or recording from him, it was always there for<br/>me. When I compiled a chronological catalogue of works, his aid was there,<br/>too --- though his own sense of accuracy and dating was more a source of<br/>frustration and confusion than clarification.<br/>He was usually a man of few words, beginning almost any sentence with &quot;oh,<br/>yes&quot;, in a basic Boston-American tone that showed no trace of the Armenian<br/>ethnicity in his blood, or any of the other ethnicities he loved, studied<br/>and visited. His own comments on his music seemed strangely detached, often<br/>fixated largely or entirely on matters of phrase length and count.</p><p> The sheer volume of Hovhaness&Otilde; output takes some believing. When the<br/>English composer Havergal Brian died in 1972, with 32 numbered symphonies to<br/>his credit, he was then the most prolific symphonist since Haydn. Hovhaness<br/>caught up with Brian in 1977 and went on to compose no fewer than 67<br/>symphonies. He also wrote oratorios, operas, ballets, songs, scores for film<br/>and stage, and chamber, choral and instrumental music. His tally of opus<br/>numbers stops at 434, but since many of the works don&Otilde;t carry opus numbers,<br/>no one is yet sure what his total number of compositions might be ---<br/>estimates of the compositions for chamber orchestra alone range between 100<br/>and 200. Before a final figure can be known, some stubborn researcher will<br/>have to plough through the stacks of manuscripts piled up in his basement<br/>(his publishers couldn&Otilde;t keep up with him).<br/>Part of Hovhaness&Otilde; spiritual make-up involved a strong identification with<br/>nature. His home in Seattle faced the Cascade Mountains, and his night&Otilde;s<br/>work of composing would generally continue until he could watch the sunrise<br/>over the peaks. His orchestral piece And God Created Great Whales<br/>incorporates recordings of singing cetaceans. The titles of others of his<br/>works betray his pantheist leanings:  Mysterious Mountain, The Celestial<br/>Gate, Star Dawn, Visionary Landscapes. But for all the cosmic ambition<br/>suggested by these labels, his compositional outlook was very simple:</p><p>My purpose is to create music, not for snobs, but for all people, music<br/>which is beautiful and healing, to attempt what old Chinese painters called<br/>&quot;spiritual resonance&quot; in melody and sound.<br/>MARTIN ANDERSON</p><p>Alan Hovhaness (Alan Vaness Chakmakjian), composer, born Somerville,<br/>Massachusetts, 8 March 1911;  died Seattle, 21 June 2000.</p></div>
