I&apos;ve added a couple of points<br/>which your presentation suggested to me, and hope that my musical<br/>examples may add to the dialogue.</p><p>Especially, I would like to suggest that medieval Pythagorean<br/>practice, the meantone practice of the Renaissance, and the<br/>well-tempered practice of Bach&apos;s era may each have their own musical<br/>&quot;perfection.&quot; What is fitting for one era may be &quot;harsh,&quot; or at least<br/>unidiomatic, for another.</p><p>First, from my perspective, if we are using the term &quot;chord&quot; in a<br/>general way to suggest a combination of three or more notes or<br/>intervals, then I would consider the basic Gothic sonority as the<br/>_trina harmoniae perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot;<br/>described by Johannes de Grocheio in his treatise of around 1300.</p><p>The sonority manifesting this perfection, which Grocheio describes as<br/>a kind of feminine counterpart of the Trinity, has a mother octave<br/>(2:1), a daughter fifth (3:2), and an upper fourth (4:3) proceeding<br/>from both of these consonances. An example of this sonority, here<br/>heard as the resolution of a standard 13th-14th century cadence, would<br/>be F3-C4-F4, with C4 as middle C:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei004.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In English, I refer to Grocheio&apos;s sonority manifesting &quot;perfect<br/>harmony&quot; (which he also describes as _consonantia perfectissima_,<br/>requiring at least three voices) as a _trine_.[1]</p><p>Another theorist of the same epoch notes that the trine can be<br/>expressed by the &quot;natural&quot; series of numbers 2-3-4, with a 2:3 fifth<br/>placed below a 4:3 fourth in arranging the outer 2:1 octave. As it<br/>happens, this &quot;natural series&quot; suggests the series of harmonic<br/>partials 2:3:4, although partials seem to have been recognized in<br/>Western Europe theory only around the early 17th century, the era of<br/>Galileo, Mersenne, and Descartes.</p><p>In a system of music for three or four voices based on the stable<br/>Gothic trine, unstable combinations with complex Pythagorean thirds<br/>and sixths play a vital role in directed progressions as well as<br/>coloristic sonority. For example, consider our cadence above:</p><p>E4  F4<br/>B3  C4<br/>G3  F3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei004.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here the major third G3-B3 at 81:64 (~407.82 cents) very nicely<br/>expands to a fifth, while the major sixth G3-E3 at 27:16 (~905.87<br/>cents) expands to the outer octave of a complete trine. All three<br/>voices and intervals unite in this purposeful and compelling<br/>resolution.</p><p>As Carl Dahlhaus has written, in Gothic Pythagorean tuning there is an<br/>admirable concord between acoustical structure and musical language.</p><p>This is not to say that a standard Pythagorean tuning was the only<br/>possibility in Continental Europe during the 14th century. In England<br/>around 1300, for example, Walter Odington comments that the<br/>Pythagorean ratios for major and minor thirds are close to the simple<br/>ratios of 5:4 and 6:5, and that singers can maximize the concord of<br/>these intervals. A &quot;bending&quot; of intonation toward the simplest ratios<br/>seems to fit at least some dialects of English polyphony.</p><p>In contrast, around the same epoch, Marchettus of Padua (1318) seems<br/>to describe a system in which cadential major thirds and sixths are<br/>_larger_ than Pythagorean, and cadential semitones _narrower_ than the<br/>already compact Pythagorean diatonic semitone or _limma_ at 256:243<br/>(~90.22 cents).</p><p>While the interpretation of his system remains an uncertain and often<br/>debated topic, here is a short composition of mine, &quot;Salutation for<br/>Mary Beth Ackerley, envision&apos;d as Lysistrata,&quot; inspired by one<br/>possible interpretation with cadential dieses at around 48 cents:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/mary002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/mary002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Without excluding such variations, a conventional Pythagorean tuning<br/>seems to me very nicely to fit most 14th-century music. In a thread<br/>with much discussion of &quot;perfection,&quot; I might add that certain<br/>theorists describe a Pythagorean major third as &quot;perfected,&quot; meaning<br/>that it actively seeks to expand to the stable fifth.</p><p>The nature of musical style, however, is to change, and by around<br/>1400-1420, as you mention, Herbert Kellner, a type of interval present<br/>in a 12-note Pythagorean tuning of the kind common on 14th-century<br/>keyboards has captured the imaginations of musicians.</p><p>This is the &quot;schisma third,&quot; as it is now often called: actually a<br/>Pythagorean diminished fourth (e.g. C#-F or F#-Bb in a typical<br/>14th-century tuning of Eb-G#).</p><p>By the early 15th century, this interval with its curiously smooth<br/>qualities had apparently motivated many musicians to tune the written<br/>sharps of notated music as Pythagorean flats in a chain from Gb to B:</p><p>       (F#) (C#) (G#)<br/>        Gb - Db - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C - G - D - A - E - B</p><p>Thus major thirds involving written sharps will actually be realized<br/>in this tuning as Pythagorean diminished fourths very close to a pure<br/>ratio of 5:4 (~386.31 cents), e.g. D-Gb for written D-F#. Minor thirds<br/>involving sharps likewise will be realized as augmented seconds very<br/>close to 6:5, e.g. Gb-A for written F#-A. The precise ratios are<br/>8192:6561 (~384.36 cents) and 19683:16384 (~317.60 cents), differing<br/>from pure 5-based ratios by a schisma of 32805:32768 (~1.95 cents).</p><p>Thus in early 15th-century pieces such as those found in the older<br/>repertories of the Buxheim Organ Book, we find progressions like this:</p><p>E4  Gb4  G4<br/>Db4      D4<br/>A3       G3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py5ei001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py5ei001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>By around 1450, scholars such as Mark Lindley have interpreted the<br/>compositional style of Conrad Paumann to suggest a meantone<br/>temperament where all regular thirds are fairly close to 5:4 or 6:5,<br/>while by around 1482, the treatise of Bartoleme Ramos seems to imply<br/>such a temperament as a keyboard standard.</p><p>In 1496, Franchinus Gaffurius reports that the fifths are narrowed on<br/>organs by a &quot;small and hidden quantity,&quot; and in the early 16th century<br/>various writers give practical advice on how to go about it.[2]</p><p>My own experience is that just as a 14th-century Pythagorean tuning<br/>with the regular and active thirds and sixths fits the style of this<br/>era, or the modified Pythagorean tuning of the early 15th century fits<br/>the epoch of the young Dufay, so a meantone with pure or near-pure<br/>thirds fits the 16th century.</p><p>Mark Lindley suggests that maximum &quot;resonance&quot; for Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia<br/>perfetta_ of a fifth divided into major and minor third may occur in<br/>the general region of 1/4-comma (pure 5:4 major thirds) or 2/7-comma<br/>(major and minor thirds equally impure by 1/7 comma).</p><p>Certain later theorists, including Paul Erlich here, have suggested an<br/>optimal meantone somewhere between these two temperaments described by<br/>Zarlino, at around 7/26-comma -- also very close to Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>Meantone as advocated in the 1930&apos;s (where the ratio between the<br/>whole-tone and diatonic semitone is equal to the Golden Mean, ~1.618).</p><p>It seems to me that this kind of meantone fits Renaissance style,<br/>where the sweetness of the thirds tends largely to overshadow the<br/>impurity of the fifths. The large diatonic semitones seem to fit with<br/>the overall vertical ethos of the style, with a typically rather<br/>smooth flow between _harmonia perfetta_ sonorities, sometimes<br/>punctuated by the subtle dissonance form of the suspension.[2]</p><p>By 1680 and the Werckmeister era, however, we have entered into a<br/>tonal style based on the systematic and structural use of bold<br/>dissonances (such as tritonic seventh sonorities) to establish keys. A<br/>kind of tuning with somewhat narrower semitones, for example, might<br/>fit this kind of texture quite apart from issues of how much to<br/>compromise vertical fifths and thirds.</p><p>With the new well-temperaments, as with Renaissance meantones, I would<br/>see various shadings possible. Of course, if Bach had mathematical<br/>reasons for favoring a specific temperament consistent with the style<br/>of his music, then that factor could be decisive in his choice.</p><p>One helpful distinction to make in such discussions is between<br/>statements made by or attributed to a composer such as Bach, and<br/>inferences drawn from musical patterns or other factors.</p><p>What I would emphasize is that in my view the musical and intonational<br/>changes from Gothic to Renaissance and Manneristic to Late Baroque<br/>represent shifting fashions; each tuning might be considered optimal<br/>in its own stylistic setting.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Curiously, as late as 1650, Kircher uses the 17th-century term<br/>&quot;triad&quot; to refer to this traditional Gothic sonority, a term Johannes<br/>Lippius had introduced to refer to a different kind of three-voice<br/>sonority dividing the fifth into major and minor third.</p><p>2. For one view of tuning instructions in this era, see Mark Lindley,<br/>&quot;Early Sixteenth-century Keyboard Temperaments,&quot; _Musica Disciplina_<br/>28:129-151 (1974).</p><p>3. However, as the Monz has noted, the use of meantone or related<br/>tunings in the 16th century with major thirds somewhat wider than pure<br/>is also documented. Mark Lindley has suggested that the temperament of<br/>Arnold Schlick (1511) may have involved narrowing fifths between<br/>diatonic notes (F-C-G-D-A-E-B) by about 4 cents, and the fifths Eb-Bb,<br/>Bb-F, B-F#, and F#-C# by about 3 cents. He suggests that Ab-Eb may<br/>have been about 2 cents _wide_ of pure. Schlick&apos;s declared purpose is<br/>a 12-note tuning with Ab-Eb serviceable and E-G# marginally acceptable<br/>in an ornamented cadence. See his &quot;Early Sixteenth-century Keyboard<br/>Temperaments,&quot; n. 2 above.  While Lindley categorically regards C#-Ab<br/>(or C#-G#) as a &quot;Wolf fifth,&quot; and Schlick indeed suggests that it is<br/>best avoided, one could argue that this fifth might be at least<br/>&quot;semi-playable,&quot; making the scheme a kind of &quot;semi-well-temperament.&quot;<br/>Schlick&apos;s system suggests that in 1511, cadences in the Third and<br/>Fourth Modes (Phrygian/Hypophrygian) did not yet follow a preference<br/>that any closing third above the bass should be major.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=26219 href="#26219">ðŸ”—</a>ha.kellner@t-online.de</h3><span>7/15/2001 7:57:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear MARGO Schulter, (sorry for my bad spelling/typing)</p><p>Not to forget: Thanks for your musical examples!

The large diatonic semitones seem to fit with<br/>&gt; the overall vertical ethos of the style, with a typically rather<br/>&gt; smooth flow between _harmonia perfetta_ sonorities, sometimes<br/>&gt; punctuated by the subtle dissonance form of the suspension.[2]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By 1680 and the Werckmeister era, however, we have entered into a<br/>&gt; tonal style based on the systematic and structural use of bold<br/>&gt; dissonances (such as tritonic seventh sonorities) to establish keys.

Of course, if Bach had mathematical<br/>&gt; reasons for favoring a specific temperament consistent with the style<br/>&gt; of his music, then that factor could be decisive in his choice.</p><p>UNITAS between temperament and structure of compositions can be assured<br/>provided the structure utilizes numbers that pertain to the tuning.</p><p>The 4 Duets&apos; 369 bars have the ratio superparticularis of 370/369 that<br/>belongs to the tempered fifth in 1/5 P of Werckmeister/Bach &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;.<br/>369/370 is the first continued fraction approximation, as Monz remarked<br/>recently, a(370/371 the next superparticular approximation).</p><p>The midpoint of the Four Duets, upon inspection, pereferrably of the original<br/>prnt, or the HENLE edition, is clearly dsistinguished. Bach knew there were 369<br/>bars in total.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One helpful distinction to make in such discussions is between<br/>&gt; statements made by or attributed to a composer such as Bach, and<br/>&gt; inferences drawn from musical patterns or other factors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I would emphasize is that in my view the musical and intonational<br/>&gt; changes from Gothic to Renaissance and Manneristic to Late Baroque<br/>&gt; represent shifting fashions; each tuning might be considered optimal<br/>&gt; in its own stylistic setting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; Notes<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Curiously, as late as 1650, Kircher uses the 17th-century term<br/>&gt; &quot;triad&quot; to refer to this traditional Gothic sonority, a term Johannes<br/>&gt; Lippius had introduced to refer to a different kind of three-voice<br/>&gt; sonority dividing the fifth into major and minor third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. For one view of tuning instructions in this era, see Mark Lindley,<br/>&gt; &quot;Early Sixteenth-century Keyboard Temperaments,&quot; _Musica Disciplina_<br/>&gt; 28:129-151 (1974).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. However, as the Monz has noted, the use of meantone or related<br/>&gt; tunings in the 16th century with major thirds somewhat wider than pure<br/>&gt; is also documented. Mark Lindley has suggested that the temperament of<br/>&gt; Arnold Schlick (1511)</p><p>A question I have - to be critisized - not yet seriously considered: Is<br/>&quot;Bach&apos;s system wohltemperirt&quot; consistent with Schlick. Or else, is<br/>Schlick&apos;s system consistent with &quot;Bach&apos;s system wohltemperirt&quot; ????</p><p>may have involved narrowing fifths between<br/>&gt; diatonic notes (F-C-G-D-A-E-B) by about 4 cents, and the fifths Eb-Bb,<br/>&gt; Bb-F, B-F#, and F#-C# by about 3 cents. He suggests that Ab-Eb may<br/>&gt; have been about 2 cents _wide_ of pure. Schlick&apos;s declared purpose is<br/>&gt; a 12-note tuning with Ab-Eb serviceable and E-G# marginally acceptable<br/>&gt; in an ornamented cadence. See his &quot;Early Sixteenth-century Keyboard<br/>&gt; Temperaments,&quot; n. 2 above.  While Lindley categorically regards C#-Ab<br/>&gt; (or C#-G#) as a &quot;Wolf fifth,&quot; and Schlick indeed suggests that it is<br/>&gt; best avoided, one could argue that this fifth might be at least<br/>&gt; &quot;semi-playable,&quot; making the scheme a kind of &quot;semi-well-temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt; Schlick&apos;s system suggests that in 1511, cadences in the Third and<br/>&gt; Fourth Modes (Phrygian/Hypophrygian) did not yet follow a preference<br/>&gt; that any closing third above the bass should be major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
