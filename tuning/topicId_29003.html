The remark wasn&apos;t specifically about those sources I posted.  While some<br/>are much less interesting than others, I think all of the sources I listed<br/>are worthwhile (I tried not to list useless ones.)  Still, the least<br/>interesting from the previous list are in my opinion:</p><p>Musicolour, by Ronald Senator, Musicolor Ltd., 1977.</p><p>Musical Colour, by Danton Adams, Douglas &amp; Gilson (1922) LTD., first edition,<br/>1960.</p><p>Rainbow-Music; or The Philosophy of Harmony in Colour-Grouping, by Lady<br/>Archibald Campbell, Bernard Quaritch, London, 1886.</p><p>There are many German sources on the subject.  One which I listed is very<br/>enjoyable to read is also short and handsomely published in full color:</p><p>Farb-Musik: Leitfaden f&uuml;r eine kombinierte Farben- und Musiklehre, by Fritz<br/>Dobretzberger and Johannes Paul, 1993, Simon and Leutner Verlag, Berlin.</p><p>And again, I think the best general introduction is probably:</p><p>Coloured Light: An Art Medium, being the third edition enlarged of<br/>&ldquo;Colour-Music,&rdquo; by Adrian Bernard Klen, M.B.E., A.R.P.S., Technical Press<br/>Ltd., 1937.</p><p>I first read the second edition of this book and then skimmed the third,<br/>which I obtained later, and I think either one will do as an introduction.<br/>(I very much disagree with Klein&apos;s conclusions, however)</p><p>A big problem I found with most sources is that the authors rarely showed a<br/>grasp of both music theory and color theory.  Usually music theory was most<br/>lacking.  Klein (above) was not a competent music theorist by any stretch of<br/>the imagination, but he was admittedly better than most.  As one might<br/>expect, the level of musical discussion usually revolves around an assumed 12<br/>equal tempered tones, and where tuning theory was involved, it was almost<br/>always erroneous or completely misunderstood by the author(s), who many times<br/>invoke numbers and ratios as a smokescreen for lack of insight.</p><p>Again, the list I posted is by no means complete, but is a product of my own<br/>particular interests.  For instance, there was apparently an active Soviet<br/>institute of research on the topic of color in music, but I was only able to<br/>get one source from Russia and it was in extremely poor condition - pages<br/>missing and falling out - and the photos were in black and white.</p><p>Here are a few interesting passages from Newton&apos;s Opticks, which is in my<br/>opinion the earliest substantial source on the topic.</p><p>Aaron</p><p>P.S. Please send me email directly since I don&apos;t often catch up on the list.<br/>Thanks<br/>----</p><p>from OPTICKS, or A Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and<br/>Colors of Light, by Sir Isaac Newton, fourth edition 1730, available from<br/>Dover Publications, New York, 1952.

Different colours produce vibrations of different<br/>sizes and hence different sensations, as in sound- the most refrangible rays<br/>produce the shortest vibrations ... p. 345-346.&quot;</p><p>p. 345-346 &ldquo;Do not several sorts of Rays make Vibrations of several<br/>bignesses, which according to their bignesses excite Sensations of several<br/>Colours, much after the manner that the Vibrations of the Air, according to<br/>their several bignesses excite Sensations of several Sounds?  And<br/>particularly do not the most refrangible Rays excite the shortest Vibrations<br/>for making a Sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible the largest for<br/>making a Sensation of deep red, and the several intermediate sorts of Rays,<br/>Vibrations of several intermediate bignesses to make Sensations of the<br/>several intermediate Colours?&rdquo;</p><p>preface p. 110: &ldquo;Qu. 14. Harmony and discord of colours related to the ratio<br/>of vibrations, as in sound ... p. 346.&quot;</p><p>p. 346 &ldquo;May not the harmony and discord of Colours arise from the proportions<br/>of the Vibrations propagated through the Fibres of the optick Nerves into the<br/>Brain, as the harmony and discord of Sounds arise from the proportions of the<br/>Vibrations of the Air?  For some Colours, if they be view&rsquo;d together, are<br/>agreeable to one another, as those of Gold and Indigo, and others disagree.&rdquo;</p><p>p. 200 Newton found that the squares of the distances between rings of colors<br/>produced through lenses to be equal to the progressions of odd and even<br/>integers, 1 through 12, the odd numbers being colors and the even numbers<br/>being spaces between them.</p><p>p. 210 Newton found that a ratio 14/9 (between 3/2 and 13/8) seemed to govern<br/>the relation between the sizes of red rings in proportion to the sizes of<br/>violet rings made by a prism as it was moved about by an assistant.</p><p>p. 212 &ldquo;The thicknesses of the Air between the Glasses there, where the Rings<br/>are succesively made by the limits of the seven Colours, red, orange, yellow,<br/>green, blue, indigo, violet, in order, are to one another as the Cube Roots<br/>of the Squares of the eight lengths of a Chord, which found the Notes in an<br/>eighth, sol, la fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol; that is, as the Cube Roots of the<br/>Squares of the Numbers 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 9/16, 1/2.&rdquo; cf. p. 225,<br/>280, 284, 305</p><p>p. 292-295 other interesting whole number series of squares of distances 0,<br/>1, 2, 3, 4.</p><p>p. 325 experiments using a hair placed between 2 lenses, and observations of<br/>fringes produced around shadows cast by the hair as well as scratches and<br/>bubbles in the lenses: &ldquo;The breadths of the Fringes seem&rsquo;d to be in the<br/>progression of the Numbers 1, &Sqrt;1/3, &Sqrt;1/5, and their Intervals to be in the<br/>same progression with them; that is, the Fringes and their Intervals together<br/>to be in the continual progression of the Numbers 1, &Sqrt;1/2, &Sqrt;1/3, &Sqrt;1/4,<br/>&Sqrt;1/5, or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p><p>Newton established ROYGBIV and an analogy between a minor diatonic scale -<br/>1/1, 9/8, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 9/16, 2/1 - and 7 colors of the visible<br/>spectrum or the rainbow, later dismissed as a tautology by Helmholtz among<br/>others who pointed out that the spectrum is continuous and appears to have<br/>imprecise boundaries.</p></div><h3><a id=29120 href="#29120">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/13/2001 9:19:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/14/01 12:16:02 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:Pitchcolor@aol.com">Pitchcolor@aol.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; For instance, there was apparently an active Soviet<br/>&gt; institute of research on the topic of color in music, but I was only able<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; get one source from Russia and it was in extremely poor condition - pages<br/>&gt; missing and falling out - and the photos were in black and white.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>That would be Bulent&apos;s Prometheus Institute in Kazan, Russia.
