We<br/>can then adjust the defining intervals to taste.</p><p>There&apos;s fun in using a 7:5 to define a tuning that doesn&apos;t have that<br/>much to do with conventional 5-limit or 7-limit harmony, or in picking<br/>other ratios with an historical tradition behind them to come up with<br/>something maybe not quite that traditional.</p><p>This only speaks to part of RI, of course, and I find your &quot;mediants<br/>of simplicity,&quot; Jacky, fascinating (two complex ratios yielding a<br/>simple ratio as their mediant).</p><p>Maybe there&apos;s a certain parsimonious viewpoint that says, &quot;Unless this<br/>ratio is audibly discreet, it&apos;s just superfluous mathematics.&quot;<br/>However, the emblematic use of numbers in music is something that I<br/>treasure.</p><p>For example, the Pythagorean ratios of 81:64 and 32:27 for major and<br/>minor thirds are part of a centuries-old tradition which I revere, and<br/>these ratios are a part of my musical life. They may not have the same<br/>significance to others, and there&apos;s room on this list for lots of<br/>different approaches.</p><p>Some mathematical structures of beauty may have more than one musical<br/>application -- for example, Erv Wilson&apos;s Scale Tree, with branching<br/>mediants which can be read either as fractions of an octave or as<br/>rational interval ratios. Let us marvel at the structure and celebrate<br/>the diversity of interpretations, hopefully not only theoretical but<br/>musical.</p><p>Here is a 16-note &quot;fine-tuning&quot; designed for a two-manual keyboard,<br/>with one manual in the usual 12-note Eb-G# range, the other sharing<br/>the diatonic notes and Bb while including the other accidentals: Db,<br/>D#, Gb, Ab. Basically this is an RI variation on a 17-note system of<br/>early 15th-century Europe (Gb-A#), but without A#, so that both<br/>keyboards can share the more common Bb, making them easier to play<br/>together with contrasting timbres if this is desired.</p><p>In neo-Gothic terms, it&apos;s a kind of &quot;11-flavor&quot; fine-tuning, with<br/>minor thirds around 13:11 or 33:28, and major thirds around 14:11.<br/>Here I give a Scala file plus some Scala output showing values in<br/>cents, with Pythagorean-like note names added in brackets:</p><p>----------------- Scala file starts on next line of text ------------</p><p>! neogp16a.scl<br/>!<br/>Scale from mainly prime-to-prime ratios and octave complements (Gb-D#)<br/>16<br/>!<br/> 43/41<br/> 6439/5989<br/> 53/47<br/> 13/11<br/> 137/113<br/> 47/37<br/> 4/3<br/> 7/5<br/> 1781/1243<br/> 3/2<br/> 11/7<br/> 21/13<br/> 22/13<br/> 946/533<br/> 82/43<br/> 2/1</p><p>------------- Scala file ended on previous line of text --------</p><p>Scale from mainly prime-to-prime ratios and octave complements (Gb-D#)<br/>  0:          1/1            0.000000 unison, perfect prime [C]<br/>  1:         43/41           82.45533 [Db]<br/>  2:       6439/5989         125.4258 [C#]<br/>  3:         53/47           207.9980 [D]<br/>  4:         13/11           289.2098 [Eb]<br/>  5:        137/113          333.4238 [D#]<br/>  6:         47/37           414.1627 [E]<br/>  7:          4/3            498.0452 perfect fourth [F]<br/>  8:          7/5            582.5125 septimal tritone, BP fourth [Gb]<br/>  9:       1781/1243         622.6337 [F#]<br/> 10:          3/2            701.9553 perfect fifth [G]<br/> 11:         11/7            782.4924 undecimal augmented fifth [Ab]<br/> 12:         21/13           830.2536 [G#]<br/> 13:         22/13           910.7907 [A]<br/> 14:        946/533          993.2460 [Bb]<br/> 15:         82/43           1117.545 [B]<br/> 16:          2/1            1200.000 octave [C]</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file for a 24-note well-untemperament, not specifically<br/>neo-Gothic although it could be so used -- people might find other<br/>interesting applications.

But it should be noted that 64:81 and 27:32 arise naturally from<br/>chains of just intervals or their octave inversions while ratios of<br/>primes can never arise in this manner. Readers are bound to conclude<br/>(in the absence of accompanying words to the contrary) that the author<br/>who uses large prime ratios feels that they have some special<br/>psychoacoustic significance (i.e. &quot;audibly discrete&quot;, as you say). So<br/>far, I am not aware of any evidence of this.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
