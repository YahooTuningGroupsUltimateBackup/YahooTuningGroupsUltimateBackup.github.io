It can do the same tracks than the cubase<br/>(with 96MHz sampling rate), but going up to the 0.0026 Hz tuning resolution<br/>and a sampling rate of 100MHz.

Can you draw your own graphs?</p><p>Umm, yes.<br/>It is a fairly advanced system (under estimate), it has real time<br/>spectral analysis etc.. It is used in many fields of audio research.<br/>I can&apos;t really explain much, as I don&apos;t have one ;)<br/>It  is kind of like Reaktor type programs, except it is much more open<br/>and uses multiple DSP&apos;s instead of your host CPU.<br/>It&apos;s more of a programmers/hackers/educational box than a preset box,<br/>it does come with heaps of presets and modules though.</p><p>Just mail Symbolic Sound and ask for an info pack.<br/>They are very good at helping  interested parties.</p><p>The trade mark is/was &apos;Recombinant Sound&apos; ;)</p><p>&quot;Pipeline in the pipeline for piping&quot; ;)</p><p><a href="http://www.ampcast.com/guiseppimendoza">http://www.ampcast.com/guiseppimendoza</a><br/><a href="http://www.ampfea.org/sln/browse.php?num=3&a_id=132">http://www.ampfea.org/sln/browse.php?num=3&a_id=132</a></p></div><h3><a id=33949 href="#33949">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/10/2002 2:39:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Tony wrote:</p><p>&gt; By the way, many thanks!, so far I looked at the Capybarra and the Kyma<br/>&gt; software and is really amazing.

Oh, and it&apos;s spelt &quot;Capybara&quot;, I<br/>have one right here to check against.  You still need to worry about your<br/>PC&apos;s hard drive when you want to do recording.  I find Kyma isn&apos;t so hot<br/>for multitracking, so you might try using it alongside Cubase with a<br/>soundcard with digital inputs.</p><p>&gt; Do you have any idea about the frequency and amplitud dynamics of the<br/>&gt; Kyma<br/>&gt; software? Can you draw your own graphs?</p><p>How do you mean?  You know the sample rates, and it&apos;s 24-bit throughout.<br/>The audio inputs give you over 100dB, which isn&apos;t using all 24 bits, but<br/>enough for most of us.  You can play with the spectral analyses, things<br/>like blocking out whatever partials you don&apos;t like.  You can get an<br/>oscilloscope view as well.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
