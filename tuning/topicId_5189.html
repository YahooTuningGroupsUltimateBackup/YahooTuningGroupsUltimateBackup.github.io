Paul<br/>E. noticed that this produces structures with scaling symmetry on the<br/>lattice. Try a triad on the triangular lattice to see what I mean. I&apos;m not<br/>sure about more than one iteration. I think I tried a triad of triads and<br/>it didn&apos;t work...</p><p>Cross sets never have more than ((n^2)/2 + 1) notes, where n is the number<br/>of notes in the seed scale. This gets fairly economical at higher limits;<br/>the 15-limit cross set has only 33 notes. That means you can have harmonics<br/>8-16 as your scale (if you like harmonic scales as I do), and modulate to<br/>every key with only 33 pitches. Of course, you can&apos;t modulate to every key<br/>of every key, but it isn&apos;t too shabby with perfect 15-limit consonance and<br/>33 notes.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
