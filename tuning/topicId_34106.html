Well, that was simple<br/>&gt; enough.  My guess is that, since there are *rhythmic* qualifiers,<br/>&gt; like dots and double dots after notes, traditionally, the accidentals<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t go there...</p><p>yes, Joe, that&apos;s a very sensible observation!</p><p>&gt; It would be interesting to trace the notational history of all this,<br/>&gt; since there obviously *is* one.  That would also be a cool Monz web<br/>&gt; page...starting with the 4-line staff, neumes, etc., etc., etc. with,<br/>&gt; of course, the *tuning* implications...</p><p>yep . . . thanks for the suggestion.  someday there will be a<br/>definition of &quot;notation&quot; which lays out all the history.<br/>i&apos;ve been studying it for over 2 decades.</p><p>European musical notation started with neumes, which were<br/>squiggly lines above the words which were intended to sort of<br/>sketch out the shape of the melody on single syllables<br/>(might might have a lot of notes if sustained a long time).<br/>the neumes apparently developed from accent symbols that<br/>would be written over Greek/Byzantine text. they spread<br/>into Europe during the 800s-900s -- the Carolingian era<br/>when the Franks were the greatest European power.</p><p>but the ancient Greeks also had a musical notation, two<br/>different ones in fact, one called &quot;vocal&quot; and one called<br/>&quot;instrumental&quot;.  the &quot;vocal&quot; notation used letters of the<br/>Greek alphabet to indicate notes.  the &quot;instrumental&quot;<br/>notation used rotations of symbols, some of which are<br/>Greek letters but the others of which seem to me to be<br/>derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, which is<br/>where the Greeks got the idea for their alphabet anyway.</p><p>the Greek name for those people, &quot;Phonike&quot;, refers to the<br/>sounds of speech (modern English word &quot;phonics&quot;).  the<br/>Akkadian (i.e, Babylonian) name for these people was<br/>&quot;Kaininu&quot;, which is a Semitic word related to the Hebrew<br/>word which means &quot;Canaanites&quot;.  so they were apparently<br/>the people who invented the modern type of alphabet where<br/>each letter (symbol) represents approximately one phoneme.</p><p>older &quot;alphabets&quot; were really syllabaries, where one<br/>sound represented an entire syllable -- a more modern<br/>example is the Indian languages derived from Sanskrit,<br/>or the scripts of the Dravidian languages of southern India.</p><p>anyway, back to medieval Europe . . . the treatise<br/>_musica enchiriadis_, which has been dated variously<br/>from c 860 - 950 AD, but which i believe is an earlier<br/>work, has examples of &quot;diastematic&quot; notation, that is,<br/>a system of parallel horizontal lines which represent<br/>specific pitches, with T (for &quot;tone&quot;) and S (&quot;semitone&quot;)<br/>written in the margins next to the lines, and with the<br/>text written in the spaces.</p><p>(the _musica enchiriadis_ also presents, as its first<br/>main topic, the so-called &quot;daesian&quot; notation, which was<br/>an adaptation of Greek letters which would be rotated<br/>for different tetrachords.  i searched the web for an<br/>example of daesian notation, but couldn&apos;t find one.  but<br/>i believe that the daesian notation means something<br/>different from what everyone else believes.  another<br/>unpublished paper on which i&apos;ve worked for years is<br/>the one examining my interpretation of this fascinating<br/>treatise.)</p><p>the gamut of pitches was basically simply a holdover<br/>from the ancient Greek theory.  the Greek version had<br/>an ascending interval structure which we&apos;d represent<br/>today by A, B ... a, b-flat, b ... a&apos;, and which was<br/>tone-semitone-tone.</p><p>because of the nature of the chant, and the fact that<br/>D was viewed as the most important starting pitch,<br/>the Franks realigned the tetrachords and added a new<br/>note (&quot;gamma&quot;) at the bottom, so that the whole system<br/>was shifted a &quot;tone&quot; downward, G ... g&apos;, so that the<br/>intervallic structure between degreees of the tetrachords<br/>was different from the Greek: tone-tone-semitone. this<br/>additional lower note &quot;gamma&quot; is where the word &quot;gamut&quot;<br/>originated:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/gamut.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/gamut.htm</a></p><p>Hucbald (840-930 AD) was the theorist primarily responsible<br/>for this reorientation of the tetrachords.</p><p>the neumes up to this time are called &quot;campo aperto&quot;,<br/>which means &quot;open field&quot;, because the squiggly lines<br/>showed a relative movement of melody but without any<br/>reference pitch.  one simply had to learn a chant by<br/>rote, and the neumes were just there to help.</p><p>the type of vertical graphic thinking in the _musica<br/>enchiridis_ eventually resulted in a reference line being<br/>drawn across the &quot;campo aperto&quot; to represent a reference<br/>pitch.  it could be any note, but was generally C, F,<br/>or G.</p><p>eventually this practice proved very useful, and scribes<br/>began to use a line for all three notes, with letters at<br/>the beginning to indicate which was which.  this is the<br/>origin of our modern clefs: G became the treble clef,<br/>C became the C-clefs which are still moveable today<br/>(alto and tenor clefs), and F became the bass clef.<br/>it&apos;s impossible for me to show this evolution in an<br/>email . . . hopefully i&apos;ll put together a graphic soon<br/>that shows how it happened.</p><p>these lines were also often given different colors.  so<br/>you&apos;d have a score with three lines on it with a lot of<br/>space in between each line, since the intervals are:</p><p>        treble G<br/>&quot;5th&quot; &lt;<br/>        middle C<br/>&quot;5th&quot; &lt;<br/>        bass F</p><p>it was Guido d&apos;Arezzo, around 1050 or so, who hit on the<br/>idea of using the diastematic notation of the _musica<br/>enchiriadis_ for notating all the chants he needed to<br/>teach to his students, and he also developed the solfege<br/>syllables &quot;ut - re - mi - fa - so - la&quot; to represent the<br/>pitches in each hexachord, which was his new system of<br/>pitch organization:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hexachd.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hexachd.htm</a></p><p>Guido used a 4-line staff, which became the standard<br/>(and still is) for notating Greogorian chant.  Composers<br/>began adding other lines (i&apos;ve seen up to 12), but<br/>eventually settled on the 5-line staff as a standard.</p><p>even tho musicians thought in terms of hexachords,<br/>as i explain here<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/german-h.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/german-h.htm</a><br/>the basic gamut of pitches used at that time was<br/>2 octaves of the 7-tone diatonic scale plus the<br/>Bb below middle-C.</p><p>the hexachord system was based on those 3 references<br/>pitches (which is exactly why they became reference<br/>pitches), and thus hexachords came in 3 versions:</p><p>hard    G - A - B - C  - D - E<br/>natural C - D - E - F  - G - A<br/>soft    F - G - A - Bb - C - D</p><p>the process of moving between different types of<br/>hexachords by employing common-tones was called &quot;mutation&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/mutation.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/mutation.htm</a></p><p>there came to be two written symbols for the two<br/>different types of &quot;B&quot;: round- (or &quot;soft-&quot;) B and<br/>square- (or &quot;hard-&quot;) B.  the German words &quot;mol/molle&quot;<br/>(soft) and &quot;dur&quot; (hard) are still used today in many<br/>European languages to describe the difference between<br/>&quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot;.</p><p>musicians began to modulate more widely and thus<br/>employed the idea of mutation to travel to different<br/>tonal centers in addition to these 3.</p><p>essentially, mutation employed the &quot;soft-b&quot; to indicate<br/>a modulation into the &quot;soft&quot; hexachord, whatever its<br/>actual pitch might be.  so the &quot;soft-b&quot; at this time<br/>always indicated a   r e l a t i v e   and not an<br/>absolute pitch.</p><p>the &quot;soft-b&quot; gradually evolved into our modern &quot;flat&quot;<br/>symbol, and the &quot;hard-b&quot; evolved into both the &quot;sharp&quot;<br/>and, later, the &quot;natural&quot; symbols.</p><p>during the 1300s -- the &quot;manneristic&quot; era when music was<br/>composed with a rhythmic complexity that would not be<br/>seen again until the 1900s -- modulation became very<br/>popular, and by the end of the century the full chromatic<br/>scale had evolved as the flat and sharp signs were<br/>more and more often used to indicate absolute pitches.</p><p>around 1400, there was a sharp decline in chromaticism,<br/>and over the next couple of centuries the notation<br/>pretty much settled down into what we have today.</p><p>i&apos;ve only addressed the notation of pitch here.  of course,<br/>there&apos;s a whole other aspect of musical notation which<br/>is an entire study in itself: the notation of rhythm.<br/>i defer to Margo and others who know more about that.</p><p>those interested in this will also find these links useful:</p><p>me, monz<br/>&quot;Tutorial on ancient Greek tetrachord-theory&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm</a></p><p>John Opsopaus<br/>&quot;Greek Esoteric Music Theory Charts&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/PT/BA/GEM/index.html">http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/PT/BA/GEM/index.html</a></p><p>Gabriella F.
