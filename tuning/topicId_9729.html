Heinichen remarked (Der Generalbass in der<br/>Komposition, 1728) that because keys with two or three sharps or flats in<br/>their signature were so beautiful and expressive in well-tempered tunings,<br/>especially in the theatrical style, he would not favour the invention of the<br/>&apos;long-sought pure-diatonic&apos; keyboard even if it were to become practicable.&quot;</p><p>This morning I went through the guitarstudies Opus 31, book I, by Fernando<br/>Sor, inspired by Joe Pehrson&apos;s enthusiasm for the very first lesson. Keys<br/>are chosen in such a way that these twelve studies could be performed as a<br/>whole: C - a - D - b - G - e - E - A(a)A - C - D - F - d<br/>The harmonic progressions within each study are not complicated and<br/>&apos;retuning&apos; into JI would not give much problems, even if it&apos;s not possible<br/>to do the whole serie with only one fret-setting.
