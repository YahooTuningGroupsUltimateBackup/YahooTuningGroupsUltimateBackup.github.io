Kourosh studied classical music and received his BA in musical composition in 1998. He got numerous awards for his creative composing. He has been recognized as a pioneer because of his invention of a Chromatic Santour. The traditional Santour can only play diatonic intervals, which has excluded the instrument from Western classical orchestras. Kourosh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s chromatic Santour can now perform both altered notes and chromatic intervals over a two and a half octaves range. One of the last students of the renowned Santour master, Faramarze Payvar, Kourosh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s virtuosity permits him to play multiple melodies with each hand. Zolani was Concert Master for Iran&iuml;&iquest;&half;s first contemporary classical orchestra. He was also First Santour at the Art University Orchestra and conductor and composer for the Peaceful Planet Orchestra which he had established in Vahdat Hall. He has famous compositions for Santour and orchestra. During the last 12 years he has performed many concerts both as a soloist and also as a Santour player in different orchestras. Kourosh has come to America recently, and during this short time he has performed in many different festivals and venues. Kourosh CD, Peaceful Planet, was selected as winner of Spring&apos;s contest by jurors of 2003 Call to Arts Festival in two categories, Aesthetics and Harmony &amp; Best CD Cover Artwork.</p><p>**</p><p>*Santour:* The Santour is an ancient Iranian instrument with beautiful and mysterious sounds. It is a three octaves wooden trapezoid-shape instrument with seventy-two strings which are arranged in eighteen quadruple sets. 72 strings are in two sets of 9 moveable bridges on each side producing 27 diatonic notes. This string instrument is played by beating two delicate wooden hammers. It is believed that the santour is the dulcimer&apos;s ancestor; opinions might vary on this issue. The word &quot;Santour&quot; is very old; deriving from the Aramaic &quot;psantrin&quot; and Greek &quot;psalterion&quot;. The first time that Santour appeared in the ancient times was in Assyrian and Babylonian stone inscriptions in the year 699 before Christ. In some ancient texts the invention of Santour is attributed to Farabi, a famous ancient Persian scientist. Masoodi an ancient writer and historian has written the names of musical instruments being used during the Sassanian period (224-652 A.D.) that Santour is also listed. The earliest Persian miniatures (16th century A.D.) show the instrument. However, we don&iuml;&iquest;&half;t know an accurate history because Iran lost most of its documentaries, transcripts and hand written books during several national attacks to it around 700 years ago. Today more than ten types of Santours or dulcimers are played around the world. It should be pointed out that with current traditional tuning of the Persian Santour, it is only possible to perform the diatonic intervals, meaning that musicians could not use the Santour in classical orchestras. Kourosh has been recognized as a pioneer because of his creation of a new method of tuning the Santour, which has offered him the capacity to perform both altered notes and chromatic intervals over a two and a half octaves range. Kourosh Chromatic Santour has 9 notes more than original Santour.</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>John Schneider</p><p>Reviews</p><p>&quot;Lou Harrison&iuml;&iquest;&half;s tender /Suite No.2/ for microtonal guitars, skillfully played by John Schneider, made you forget all about the concept and listen to the music.

He holds a Ph.d. in Physics &amp; Music from the University of Wales, music degrees from the University of California and the Royal College of Music [London], and is past President of the Guitar Foundation of America. A specialist in contemporary music, Schneider&apos;s /The Contemporary Guitar /(University of California Press) has become the standard text in the field.</p><p>For the past two decades, the artist has performed almost exclusively on the /Well-Tempered Guitar /which uses different patterns of fretting according to the key or tuning system required. Recitals include Renaissance and Baroque repertoire in their original temperaments, as well as contemporary music in alternative tunings by such composers as Lou Harrison, Ben Johnston &amp; others. Since 1991, Schneider&apos;s concerts also include vocal works of the pioneer American composer Harry Partch (1901-1974), which he sings while accompanying himself on replicas of Partch&apos;s Adapted Guitars [steel stringed instruments refretted in just intonation] &amp; the Adapted Viola. The 1990&apos;s also saw the creation of his chamber group */Just Strings/*, a quartet of guitar/harp/cello/percussion devoted to the performance of music in alternative tunings. In 1995, they were invited by the Japanese Embassy to present a series of lectures and concerts throughout Japan under the auspices of the prestigious /Interlink/ Festival which annually selects one American ensemble to represent new trends in American Music.</p><p>Schneider has performed in Europe, Japan &amp; throughout North America, and been soloist on NPR&apos;s &quot;Performance Today&quot;and PRI&apos;s &quot;New Sounds&quot;. He has been featured by New Music America, New York&apos;s American Festival of Microtonal Music, Denver&apos;s Microstock, California&apos;s Mozart Festival, the DaCamera Society, Southwest Chamber Music, New American Music Festival, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and /The Outsider/, BBC&iuml;&iquest;&half;s documentary film on Harry Partch.
