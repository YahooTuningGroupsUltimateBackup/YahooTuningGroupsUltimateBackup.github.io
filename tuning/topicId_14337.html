And if you&apos;re really stuck on<br/>chords like C-G-A and C-G-D, you can add<br/>a third meantone chain, and Vicentino&apos;s<br/>method will still have no jumps of more than<br/>1/2 comma.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2000 10:47:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   2.
