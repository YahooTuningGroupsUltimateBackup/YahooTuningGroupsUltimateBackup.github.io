        <a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Notation for describing generic intervals, and also, interesting observation about L/s = 3/2 MOS</h1><h3><a id=104184 href="#104184">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2012 9:36:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>We have terms like 1\12 and 1\13 to describe steps out of EDOs. I&apos;m<br/>going to define the following notation:</p><p>1) 1\12~ describes the generic interval class that is one generic step<br/>out of a 12-note MOS or a 12-note scale in general. (The ~ means<br/>&quot;approximately.&quot;)<br/>2) For greater clarity, 1\7L5s describes the generic interval class<br/>that is one generic step out of the 7L5s MOS.<br/>3) For greater clarity and in a way that describes ratios,<br/>1\meantone[12] describes the generic interval class that is one<br/>generic step out of meantone[12]. (Note for mathematicians: be aware<br/>that this, in general, defines a lattice coset in interval space.)</p><p>This is intended to be a useful way to describe generic interval<br/>classes for any MOS. So as an example, in the meantone chromatic<br/>scale, 7\12~ refers to the generic interval class containing both the<br/>perfect fifth and the wolf fifth, and 1\12~ refers to the generic<br/>interval containing both the diatonic and chromatic semitones.</p><p>Now then, some interesting food for thought. If you play around with<br/>the &quot;interseptimal interval&quot; of ~950 cents in 19-EDO, you may notice<br/>that it sometimes flip flops between sounding like a &quot;major sixth&quot; vs<br/>a &quot;minor seventh.&quot; More precisely, you may note that you sometimes<br/>hear this interval as corresponding to 9\12 and sometimes as<br/>corresponding to 10\12.</p><p>This isn&apos;t just because you&apos;ve been abused into only listening to<br/>12-EDO your whole life. You&apos;re actually correct with this observation.<br/>In 19-EDO, that interval IS both 9\12~ and 10\12~. In diatonic<br/>terminology, it&apos;s both a &quot;diminished seventh,&quot; which is a member of<br/>9\12~, and an &quot;augmented sixth,&quot; which is a member of 10\12~.</p><p>This is basically just a higher-resolution example of the following<br/>observation: the augmented second, and the minor third, which differ<br/>by diesis, both correlate to 3\12~, despite that one is in 2\7~ and<br/>that the other is in 3\7~. It&apos;s also the same as noting that the<br/>diminished fifth, which is 4\7~ and the augmented fourth, which is<br/>3\7~ both correlate to 6\12~. In this case, the large 9\12~ and the<br/>large 10\12~ both correlate to 15\19~.</p><p>This is a general property of all MOS&apos;s of the form L/s = 3/2. We&apos;re<br/>all used to thinking about what happens if L/s = 2/1, and a scale<br/>which was strictly proper is now just &quot;proper,&quot; and there are<br/>&quot;ambiguous intervals.&quot; L/s = 3/2 brings its own form of ambiguity, but<br/>in a deeper, more complex way.</p><p>Has anyone given any thought to interesting musical things that you<br/>can do to exploit this property of these scales?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
