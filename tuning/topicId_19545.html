Occasionally notes in the two-stroke octave<br/>also were broken, but only eb&apos;&apos;/d#&apos;&apos; (more frequent) and g#&apos;&apos;/ab&apos;&apos; (less frequent).</p><p>Added keys or split keys in pythagorean tuning</p><p>There are hints provided by Christopher Stembridge and L. F. Tagliavini,<br/>that extra keys were already used in organs tuned in pythagorean tuning<br/>in the middle of the 15th century, but at the same time meantone<br/>temperament rose and lead to a greater interest in adding the &quot;tasti<br/>spezzati&quot; or &quot;subsemitonia&quot;.<br/>The pythagorean example given by Stembridge and Tagliavini is from an<br/>intarsia showing an extra key between E and F. This may be interpreted<br/>as the chain of pure perfect fifths from<br/>Cb- Gb- Db ... A - E</p><p>resulting practically in</p><p>  ex. 1                 B - F#- C#- G#-(Eb- Bb- F - C) ...<br/>                       / \ / \ / \ /<br/>  ... Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>or as a similar chain of pure perfect fifths Fb- Cb- Gb- ... D - A</p><p>  ex. 2                 E - B - F#- C#-(Ab- Eb- Bb- F) ...<br/>                       / \ / \ / \ /<br/>  ... Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A</p><p>In both examples the brackets indicate that the repeated notes are just<br/>continuing the chain.<br/>The upper rows, for example B - F#- C#- G# in ex. 1, turn out to be<br/>practically pure major thirds (384,4 cents), only a schisma (1,9<br/>ct) lower than pure major thirds (386,3 ct).</p><p>Especially in an organ the &quot;drawing together effect&quot; might render these<br/>pure to the listener. And it is not unlikely, that pythagorean tuning<br/>might have been derived from</p><p>The split key between E and F would add either the E above C (to ex. 1)</p><p>  ex. 3         E - B - F#- C#- G#<br/>               / \ / \ / \ / \ /<br/>  Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>or the pure fifth E to A</p><p>  ex. 4             E - B - F#- C#<br/>                   / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>  Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>Meantone extension</p><p>In an italian organ around 1500 (four such organs are known before),<br/>tuned in (some) meantone temperament, the first key to be split might be<br/>the a-flat, provided with the g# (as back key) - as can be seen in the<br/>(reconstructed) keyboards of the 2 famous organs in Bologna, Italy, S.<br/>Petronio, the older one from 1475, getting split keys during the rebuilt<br/>by G. B. Facchetti in 1528-1531 and the other organ from 1596 built by<br/>B. Malamini.<br/>Others started with doubling eb/d#.</p><p>Later it became usual to split consequently: eb/d#, g#/ab (g# being in<br/>front), bb/a# then c#/db (seldom). There are only two organs known which<br/>had all these 4 split sharps and in both cases all concentrated in one<br/>octave span:<br/>Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel, Germany, Hauptkirche BMV, 1620-1624 G. Fritzsche,  and<br/>Sciacca, Italy, S. Margherita, 1639 G. Sutera and V. Monteleone</p><p>Not one known organ with less than 19 notes per octave had *all split<br/>keys (or more) as subsemitones, like the &quot;enharmonic&quot; instruments.</p><p>The pattern with eb/d# and g#/ab (14 notes/pitches per octave) seems to<br/>have been frequent. It provides the following possibilities,<br/>symmetrically ordered around the fifth of the 1st mode D-A.</p><p>ex. 5   ... G#- D#<br/>         \ / \ / \<br/>      ... E - B - F#- C#- G#- D#...<br/>       \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>    ... C - G - D - A - E - B ...<br/>     \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>      Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G ...<br/>                   \ / \ / \<br/>                    Ab- Eb ...</p><p>    dashes and slashes indicate<br/>    -  meantone fifths<br/>    /  pure major thirds<br/>    \  minor thirds (as defined by the two previous)</p><p>dotted lines ... and slashes with &quot;open end&quot; indicate continuation in<br/>the next row below or above. Which is nothing else than<br/>Ab- Eb- Bb- F- C- G- D- A- E- B- F#- C# - G#- D#<br/>a chain of meantone-tuned perfect fifths, not indicating the third-relations</p><p>Short octave and split keys</p><p>d&apos; was also the middle, symmetrical key on the keyboards with short<br/>octave CDEFGA-c&apos;&apos;&apos;.</p><p>The keyboard in the bass would look like</p><p>       D   E   Bb<br/> C   F   G   A   B   c</p><p>The short octave might have originated from the previous<br/>FGAB-g&apos;&apos;,a&apos;&apos;-compass by adding the C to the left of the keyboard and the<br/>D and E at the indicated places. Some F-keyboards seem to have been<br/>actually based on D (same pattern, but without the C).</p><p>How important the symmetrical aspect might have been regarded is<br/>difficult to say. Amazing is in this respect that the keyboards until<br/>ca. 1700 were rather equipped with extra notes in the bass for F# and<br/>G#, built as split keys (but which are not &quot;subsemitones&quot;) as well:</p><p>      F#  G#<br/>      D   E   Bb<br/>C   F   G   A   B   c</p><p>There are a few keyboard designs, deviating from the above sketched<br/>patterns, apparently &quot;omitting&quot; certain keys, like doubling<br/>eb/d# and bb/a#, leaving out the frequent g#/ab), or providing<br/>g#/ab and c#/db , but not eb/d#<br/>whichs possible purpose is explained below.</p><p>Terminology</p><p>The &quot;lattice&quot; diagram above use as a &quot;informal&quot; way to show the symmetry<br/>of meantone and the central key d, resp. the fifth d-a is also the<br/>fundament of the most &quot;popular&quot; pythagorean tuning &quot;Gb&quot;-H ...<br/>Interesting that the organ builders kept until the 20th century the<br/>nomenclature of the pythagorean tuning, saying &quot;d#&quot; even when a &quot;real&quot;<br/>eb is tuned - and the tablature notation, for example the so-called &quot;new<br/>German organ-tablature&quot; in the 17th century, where notes were expressed<br/>by letters and signs for rhythms (s. J. G. Walthers &quot;Musicalisches<br/>Lexicon&quot;, table XXI) also stayed with this standard.<br/>A c-minor-chord would be notated &quot;c  ds  g&quot;.</p><p>The added split keys keys were marked in the Fritzsche- and<br/>Manderscheidt-tradition with an &quot;#&quot; on the pipes ( and in contracts:</p><p>name  sounding note<br/>ds    eb<br/>ds#   d#<br/>--------<br/>gs    g#<br/>gs#   ab</p><p>This can be found for example in the specification-draft from 1612 by<br/>Hans Leo Hassler for the future organ in the castle chapel of the<br/>electoral court in Dresden, completed by Gottfried Fritzsche probably<br/>end of 1612.  A facsimile of this important document is easily<br/>accessible in Gress 1993 (p. 76-77, transcription p. 102-103).</p><p>A report from Breslau/Wroclaw, that the organ in Stiftskirche St.<br/>Vincenz, built in the 1660ies by J.C.B. Waldhauser mentions &quot;dis&quot; (eb)<br/>and &quot;dass&quot; (d#).</p><p>Michael Praetorius (&quot;De organographia&quot;, 1619) wrote however (only here?)<br/>&quot;es&quot; and &quot;ds&quot;, &quot;gs&quot; and &quot;as&quot;.</p><p>A Very Short History</p><p>It seems to have been Italian organ builders of the mid-15th-C. who were<br/>the first to apply split keys in organ building. Not surprising Italy<br/>was the main center of this development for the first 150 years and<br/>nearly half of the instruments we know of today are to be found in this<br/>country. Until 1600 we leran about 19 organs. From Italy the idea might<br/>have spread to Spain (the picture within Spain still remains somewhat unclear).</p><p>In Italy the development seems to faded out after 1660, but shortly<br/>after 1600 however, Germany, which was dominated by musicians under<br/>Italian influence, took a central position. Split keys were promoted by<br/>the leader of the Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel court chapel, Michael Praetorius, and the<br/>Saxon court organ builder Gottfried Fritzsche. Other promoters were f.<br/>example Henrich Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tz (Dresden) and Jacob Praetorius (Hamburg), both<br/>knowing and cooperating with each other and with Fritzsche. Dresden was<br/>the first organ norther of the alps in which split keys were applied<br/>(Schlick 1511 reports a failed attempt at an unknown place by two<br/>unknown builders). The chapel organ was finished by G. Fritzsche in 1612<br/>after having planned it together with Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tz&apos; predecessor as chapel<br/>master of the electoral court, Hans Leo Hassler. It is hoped by the way<br/>that in the near future this organ will be reconstructed in the as well<br/>reconstructed Dresden castle.</p><p>The Manderscheidt-family originally working in and around N&iuml;&iquest;&half;rnberg<br/>(Nuremberg) has to be mentioned too, because they produced several<br/>positives, but also bigger church organs like the recently restored<br/>choir organ in Fribourg, Switzerland, St. Nicolas, built 1654-1657 by<br/>Sebald Manderscheidt.</p><p>From these geographical area the idea spread further to surrounding<br/>regions and countries:</p><p>- Denmark:         only one example known, probably an organ builder<br/>                   of Saxon origin (the courts of Denmark and saxony<br/>                   were dynastically linked)</p><p>- Sweden:          the only country were also local organ builders<br/>                   took the practice over.</p><p>- the Netherlands: the northwest-German organ builder family<br/>                   van Hagerbeer (1630ies/1640ies)</p><p>- Switzerland:     Manderscheidt-family (s. above) ca. 1650</p><p>- England:         2 organs known, by Bernard Smith (Bernhard Schmidt)<br/>                   in the 1680ies</p><p>In France this tradition did not prevail, there is no safe evidence for<br/>organs with split keys (even not the one example in Paris, St. Nicolas<br/>des Champs, 1632-1636, C. Carlier, is known whether it was realized) and<br/>the Gamba-player Jean-Jaques Rousseau confirmed in 1697 that this<br/>tradition was not to be found in France, contrary to Italy.</p><p>At the end of the 17th century there are still large organs built with 3<br/>manuals and pedal in Sweden and Germany, whcih contained 3 split<br/>keys/octave, namely eb/d#, g#/ab and bb/a#, sometimes even going down to<br/>the great octave (Bb/A# occurs), which usually did not happen (Italian<br/>early compasses down to FF, 12-foot, excluded).</p><p>With the rise of circulating temperaments the practice disappeared in<br/>organ building soon after 1700. The last organ was built by J. and V. F.<br/>Bossart in 1716-1721 in Luzern (Switzerland), St. Urban.<br/>The history of piano&apos;s with less than 19 keys/octave is not well known.<br/>Broadwood is reported to have built a piano in 1766 which had all upper<br/>keys split.<br/>About 70 organs with 13-16 keys per octave are known today to have been<br/>built during the time sketched above.</p><p>The historical informed performance practice movemend lead organ<br/>builders to build organs in meantone tuning again and so the split keys<br/>came back into modern organ building.</p><p>With the return of historical oriented organ building and the rise of<br/>historical temperaments and tunings in the practice of instrument<br/>building and performance practice split keys have become a more and more<br/>frequent feature again since the 1970ies, after an interlude of nearly<br/>300 years. Italy, the USA, Sweden and Switzerland might be today the<br/>countries with the highest concentration of existing organs with split<br/>keys, while the development in other traditional organ countries like<br/>the Netherlands or Germany has not yet led to a more frequent re-use again.</p><p>Use</p><p>Though split keys could be used in several ways, transposition seems to<br/>be the most important reason for their existence. Transposition to a<br/>variety of intervals was frequent and necessary:  The organist had to<br/>provide the proper tones in the liturgy, to play transcriptions<br/>(intabulations) in different applied pitches and to accompany ensembles.</p><p>Special designs were developped, for example by apparently &quot;omitting&quot;<br/>certain keys, to enable comfortable transposition by certain intervals<br/>(reflecting probably the relative low or high organ pitch in the<br/>respective region). Designs in other organs lead to the conclusion that<br/>their split keys were used mainly in continuo-playing (Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel, and<br/>maybe, Sciacca). Another organ (S&iuml;&iquest;&half;nderborg Slotskapel, 1626, rebuilt by<br/>B. (Zencker [?]) and restored recently by Mads Kjersgaard) even has two<br/>manuals, one of them with split keys, that shows some similarity to the<br/>concept of the so-called &iuml;&iquest;&half;transposing&quot; instruments by the German/Flemish<br/>harpsichord builders Ruckers.</p><p>Selected literature:<br/>--</p><p>-----------------------<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/homepage.htm">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/homepage.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/public.html">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/public.html</a></p><p>GOArt (G&iuml;&iquest;&half;teborg Organ Art center) G&iuml;&iquest;&half;teborgs universitet<br/><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/w-1.htm">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/w-1.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=19549 href="#19549">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/28/2001 7:19:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Ibo Ortgies &lt;ibo.ortgies@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19545.html#19545">/tuning/topicId_19545.html#19545</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; resulting practically in<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ex. 1                 B - F#- C#- G#-(Eb- Bb- F - C) ...<br/>&gt;                        / \ / \ / \ /<br/>&gt;   ...
