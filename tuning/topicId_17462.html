So Ls are made using k = 2, and first L is between 0 and 2.</p><p>Now, lets try adding a small increment h to alternate generators. (h measured<br/>in cents say, or any logarithmic notation).</p><p>This moves the odd numbered notes all up in pitch by h.</p><p>This will make the S intervals into two sizes<br/>5 0 gets smaller as the 5 is moved up.<br/>6 1 gets larger as the 1 is moved up.</p><p>The Ls all remain the same size as before. Why is this?</p><p>Since Ls are made using k =2, then any L is either formed from<br/>two even numbered notes (say, 2 and 4), in which case both remain the same, or<br/>it is formed from two odd numbered notes (say, 3 and 5), in which case, both move<br/>up in pitch by the same amount. Either way, the L remains the same<br/>size as before.</p><p>So doing this gives a scale with intervals of three sizes - the L, and two sizes for the<br/>S.</p><p>Lets write kS for the k that generates the S, and kL for the one that generates the L.</p><p>(S and L here would normally be written as subscripts, but can&apos;t do that in plain text, so<br/>I hope this is reasonably readable)</p><p>Then for this scale, kS = 5, and kL = 2</p><p>You can also get three sizes of step if the Ls are made using k odd, and the Ss using k<br/>even.</p><p>If so,  it would be the other way round - the Ss would remain the same as before,<br/>and the Ls would be of two sizes.</p><p>Trying several scales, it looks as though kS + kL = number of notes in the scale. If this<br/>is so, then the method will produce three step sizes for all scales with odd numbers of<br/>notes.</p><p>Let&apos;s try an example. What if we make note 1 into 14/9. This, and any other scales used<br/>here are just meant as an examples to help explain method, not particularly as ones to play in.</p><p>Instead of 1/1 3/2 9/4 (0 cents 702 cents 1404 cents), let&apos;s try the generator</p><p>1/1 14/9 9/4<br/>0 cents 764.9 cents 1404 cents</p><p>so h = (14/9)/(3/2) =  28/27 =  62.96 cents.</p><p>Scale is</p><p>1/1 9/8 81/64 729/512 14/9 7/4 63/32 2/1<br/>0 cents 203.9 cents 407.8 cents 611.7 cents 764.9 cents 968.8 cents 1173 cents 1200 cents</p><p>Steps<br/>9/8 9/8 9/8 7168/6561 9/8 9/8 64/63<br/>0 cents 203.9 cents 203.9 cents 203.9 cents 153.2 cents 203.9 cents 203.9 cents 27.26<br/>cents</p><p>As expected, the Ls are the same as before, and the Ss are now of<br/>two sizes, 7168/6561 and 64/63. (The first of which is now larger than<br/>the original L, which can happen - that&apos;s okay as you still have three<br/>step sizes)</p><p>As h increases, the smaller S gets smaller (e.g. with 11/7 it&apos;s 896/891)<br/>and then at a certain point, e.g. 8/5, the 5 goes to the other side of the 0:<br/>0 5 2 4 6 1 3 0</p><p>Increment here is 16/15 (111.7 cents) which is larger than the S at 256/243 (90.22 cents).</p><p>Result no longer has three step sizes.</p><p>For 1/1 8/5 9/4, steps are<br/> 81/80 10/9 9/8 9/8 4096/3645 9/8 10/9</p><p>However, if the increment is smaller than the original S, then resulting scale has three<br/>step sizes.</p><p>I think your method keeps to increments smaller than the original S (or the original L if<br/>it&apos;s the L that one is varying) - is that so?</p><p>Now, the conjecture is, that such a scale is always trivalent.

This is a bit<br/>more of a convoluted process. When I say [a,b], or [a,b,c], or [2,5],<br/>or [2,2,3] I&apos;m referring to a scale&apos;s index where the alphabetized<br/>variables are small to large stepsizes. So [a,b] and [a,b,c] are the<br/>generic generalized two and three stepsize indexes, and [2,5] and<br/>[2,2,3] are just a familiar example of each.
