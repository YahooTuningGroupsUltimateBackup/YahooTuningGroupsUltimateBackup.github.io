There tends not to be a<br/>difference between any of the songs with that approach. In fact, there are<br/>no songs. Just, blues in E, then a blues in A... ad infinatum</p><p>To me, blues is such a rich song form that goes deeply beyond a mere set of<br/>chord changes or riffs. To me, the really great blues songs are identifiable<br/>simply on the strength of their melodies, regardless of the chord changes.<br/>And I think that quality of song is found in every artist you mentioned,<br/>along with many others.</p><p>All this said, the same old twelve bar thing that can sound so mundane, is<br/>transformed into magic in the hands of the masters. And I aspire to that<br/>authenticity in my own playing. Time will tell if I attain this.</p><p>I guess another aspect of what I perceive as watered down-ness would be the<br/>tendency to clean up intervals into a more 12 ET sound, as opposed to the<br/>very microtonal nature of the great blues improvisors. I think some of the<br/>same things can be said of cleaning up the rhythym.</p><p>I hope this clarifies my thinking on my statement. It&apos;s very easy to<br/>say/write things only partially in an email, with my full contextual<br/>perspective in mind, and nobody reading my post would hear what I obviously<br/>didn&apos;t say out loud.</p><p>Seth<br/>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>&quot;Music is far, far older than our species. It is tens of millions of years<br/>old, and the fact that animals as wildly divergent as whales, humans and<br/>birds come out with similar laws for what they compose suggests to me that<br/>there are a finite number of musical sounds that will entertain the<br/>vertebrate brain.&quot;</p><p>              Roger Payne, president of Ocean Alliance, quoted in NY Times</p></div>
