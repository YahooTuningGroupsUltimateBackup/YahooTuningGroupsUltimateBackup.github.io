Zarlino, interestingly, made a similar observation<br/>in 1558: the ratio 3:4:5 best follows &quot;the order of the<br/>sonorous numbers&quot; 1-2-3-4-5-6, not yet recognized as the<br/>harmonic series, but equivalent to it. In this era there was<br/>considerable caution about a sonority with a fourth above<br/>the bass: Zarlino recognized this, but argued that really<br/>3:4:5 should be treated as fully concordant.</p><p>&gt; But that effect is very powerful and noticeable also when<br/>&gt; the third is the bottom note in the first inversion 5:6:8<br/>&gt; chord. The effect is by no means lost in the root position<br/>&gt; 4:5:6 chord, but I think where the third note is exposed<br/>&gt; at the top the effect is greater, and when it&apos;s at the<br/>&gt; bottom, I get a sensation of a kind of liberating<br/>&gt; relaxation when the third drops down from its equal<br/>&gt; tempered &quot;drawn up&quot; tense position to the more natural<br/>&gt; just position.</p><p>Zarlino takes 4:5:6 as the most usual position, but regards<br/>5:6:8 or 3:4:5 as also a &quot;natural&quot; arrangement following the<br/>ordering of ratios in the series of sonorous numbers<br/>(basically 1-6, plus 8 for some of these voicings). This is<br/>in contrast to 10:12:15, 12:15:20, or 15:20:24, all of which<br/>are &quot;artificial&quot; and less sonorous. So, in modern terms, the<br/>inversion of a &quot;natural&quot; sonority will also be natural,<br/>while that of an artificial sonority will also be<br/>artificial.</p><p>But in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, when flexible<br/>pitch performances were likely close to 5-limit and meantone<br/>was the rule for keyboards, there was a lot of discussion<br/>and debate about a fourth above the bass, or something like<br/>3:4:5. In practice, the ideal was something like 2:3:4:5,<br/>with Zarlino noting how a major tenth is more harmonious<br/>than a third.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve not accumulated quite as much listening experience<br/>&gt;  with inversions of three-note chords having some note<br/>&gt;  frequency ratios involving higher odd numbers than 5 -<br/>&gt;  have only just now thought more directly and analytically<br/>&gt;  about the effect of how &quot;exposed&quot; a note is within a<br/>&gt;  chord - but the way chord inversions affect &quot;exposure&quot; of<br/>&gt;  their notes and their prominence in the mind of the<br/>&gt;  hearer adds an additional dimension to the analytic<br/>&gt;  numerical perceptual study of chords and musical<br/>&gt;  harmonies and their tunings.</p><p>Well, you&apos;ve led me to try comparing some things that I<br/>might not have otherwise -- thank you! For example, I find<br/>that 6:7:9 is very harmonious, and often about the next most<br/>concordant sonority I use after 2:3:4 or 3:4:6. As Zarlino<br/>would say, 6:7:9 follows the order of the sonorous numbers<br/>-- or would, if he had included 7! With 7:9:12, there&apos;s a<br/>lot more energy and expansiveness, very effective for a<br/>cadence, but more &quot;JI-buzzy&quot; as 7:12:18, or 14:18:21:24.<br/>And something I really hadn&apos;t focused on before is 9:12:14,<br/>very sweet and pleasant.</p><p>There are also things like 8:11:13 and 13:11:8 -- this could<br/>be a very extensive discussion, and I&apos;m still reflecting on<br/>some of your valuable observations from back around<br/>1998-2000 or so, based on lots of hands-on experience with<br/>JI and meantone.</p><p>&gt;  On another topic, I thought Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>&gt;  improvisations sounded striking and different from any<br/>&gt;  musical phrases I&apos;d heard before - a bit like the &quot;ars<br/>&gt;  nova squared&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s something I&apos;ll take as a very happy compliment; one<br/>of my mottoes is _ars intonationis subtilior_ or &quot;a more<br/>subtle art of intonation.&quot;</p><p>And your questions about inversions and voicings may give<br/>lots of us some artful ideas.</p><p>&gt; Dave Hill, Borrego Springs, CA</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105838 href="#105838">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2013 12:03:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, when<br/>&gt; flexible pitch performances were likely close to 5-limit<br/>&gt; and meantone was the rule for keyboards, there was a lot<br/>&gt; of discussion and debate about a fourth above the bass,<br/>&gt; or something like 3:4:5.

For example:</p><p>        E5  D5     E4<br/>        C5     B4  C4<br/>        G4         G4<br/>        G3         C3</p><p>But if the &quot;consonant fourth&quot; were intended as stable,<br/>then your caution would apply! And its possible, as<br/>you suggest, that this might lead to a more general<br/>rule of being cautious about simple 3:4:5 as well as<br/>3:6:8:10.</p><p>Curiously, some of the original 14th-15th century<br/>arguments for treating the fourth as less than a<br/>full concord followed the logic that since 8:3 wasn&apos;t<br/>regarded by the Pythagoreans as concordant since it&apos;s<br/>not superparticular, then caution might be indicated<br/>for a simple 4:3 as well, even though it is, of course,<br/>superparticular! One article I saw in a journal called<br/>_In Theory Only_ during the early 1980&apos;s concluded that<br/>in fact 8/3 _is_ acoustically more tense than 4/3. which<br/>may also be in line with your suggestion.</p><p>Some of the 16th-century debate was more purely<br/>subjective. Thus Zarlino pointed to the free use<br/>of the fourth in the Greek Orthodox music heard in<br/>Venice, and to the aural reality that two strings<br/>at a pure fourth are fully concordant to the ear.<br/>Thomas Morley argued that the fourth was rightly<br/>treated as a dissonance because it mightily offended<br/>the ear. But it would be an interesting connection<br/>with some debates going back to ancient Greece if<br/>it were the question of 8/3, the eleventh, which<br/>played a role in the more cautious treatment of<br/>the fourth generally.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
