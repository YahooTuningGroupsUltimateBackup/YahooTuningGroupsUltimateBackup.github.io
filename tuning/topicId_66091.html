They actually used 6 chords in the song they<br/>did. (A minor: i, III, iv, V, VI, VII) So that gives them a rating of<br/>+2.</p><p>The average is 4 chords, usually I, IV, V and vi (if you consider the<br/>major I as tonic - or i, III, VI, VII if you count from the minor).<br/>That has a rating of 0.</p><p>I am giving 3-chord rock a -1 rating and two chord Rock/Reggae a -2.<br/>I&apos;ve only heard one chord rock once, it was really a kind of funk, so<br/>that would be -3.

If you worked for years on a meaningful lyric and<br/>developing a artistic, amazing vocal delivery, would you really want to<br/>add complex harmonic content that brings the listener&apos;s attention to<br/>the harmony?  No, you&apos;d want everythign to be subservient to the lyric,<br/>which is the point.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying most rock/pop is good music or lyrics or anything, but I<br/>am saying that bashing I-vi-IV-V progressions (or i-VII-VI-VII or whatever)<br/>is unfounded.  You might as well rate everyone on their use of 4 bar phrases<br/>or 4/4 time.  Really.  Just answer me this: how is it that different to sit<br/>through a rock song thinking &quot;here we go: I-vi-V-IV again...&quot; than it is<br/>to sit through the whole song thinking &quot;here we go again: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4<br/>same old 4 beats per measure over and over?&quot;</p><p>I, for one, don&apos;t like everything being the same and the same 4 chords and<br/>the same 4/4 all the time.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s good.  But I certainly am saying<br/>that anyone who sits through an expressive rock song, with their attention on<br/>the 4/4 beats is a fool.  Try listening to the vocal quality, or the specific groove<br/>of the rhythm section, or the lyric, or the dynamics.  You might still be bored<br/>and annoyed because some bands are just lousy.  But just remember that,<br/>in the case of a truly dedicated artistic band, every additional moment and<br/>bit of energy they could have put into more interesting chords would have been<br/>less they could have put into working on the groove or the lyric or whatever.<br/>It&apos;s just a question of priority.</p><p>Would you look at an interesting building and say: &quot;oh, it&apos;s the same old stuff:<br/>bricks, cement, paint...&quot; or would you look at the design of what was build with<br/>those materials?  Which of course may be anywhere from terrible to astounding.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=66104 href="#66104">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2006 7:21:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d say the real point is that not all music focuses on HARMONY as being<br/>&gt; the interesting factor.

And one more thing should be added to this: There were<br/>also many forces (especially in the 70ths, AFAIK) promoting complex harmonic<br/>or even contrapuntal phrases in Rock music together with powerful lyrics and<br/>they did very successfully, I think. I&apos;m thinking of those like Genesis,<br/>King Crimson, Yes, or even my favorite Queen whose pieces I still often<br/>play.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
