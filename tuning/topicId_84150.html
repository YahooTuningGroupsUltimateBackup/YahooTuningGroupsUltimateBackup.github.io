It&apos;s long been a favorite of mine, by the way, but<br/>you (hopefully) see my point.  A healthy improv scene has<br/>features like:</p><p>* It&apos;s participatory.  Everyone&apos;s involved</p><p>* It&apos;s not slowed down by perfectionism.  The S/N ratio<br/>suffers as a result, but S/N isn&apos;t a major problem in<br/>microtonal music today.

There are some very exciting improvising musicians centered in the San Diego area - very active, and translating that improvisation into a myriad of groups, recording projects, and tours. I tend to think of this umbrella:</p><p><a href="http://www.trummerflora.com/">http://www.trummerflora.com/</a></p><p>I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t devote too much time for a reply. Many of your points have merit, and I&apos;m not bringing this up to denigrate anyone. I&apos;ve always felt, however, that for all the talk, and all the occasional flurry, what we&apos;ve lacked is not the fun of noodling around (which is there in spades), but in concrete musical artists with bodies of work.</p><p>&gt; How many times do we<br/>&gt; really want to hear Schneider play Barstow?  I&apos;ve heard him<br/>&gt; do it FOUR times, without even trying.</p><p>That is a weak response. They do more than one concert a year, and in about a 10-year period he has built an ensemble of instruments that is more than half-way through the entire Partch instrumentarium. He can now perform all Partch works, on viable replica instruments, up to the composition &quot;The Bewitched&quot;. That takes a lot of time, effort, money, and drive. I have many quibbles with him on certain artistic levels, but as an example of someone who is getting things done, it&apos;s a good one.</p><p>&gt; The other issue is the lack of mature mircotonal genres.<br/>&gt; Composing individual pieces in a cloister and having them<br/>&gt; premiered at a concert is fine and well, but the resulting<br/>&gt; ecosystem is fragile.</p><p>Of course. You have to stick with it. Kind of like Kraig Grady did in Los Angeles for over 20 years.</p><p>&gt; * It&apos;s participatory.  Everyone&apos;s involved</p><p>Just like drum circles.</p><p>&gt; * It&apos;s not slowed down by perfectionism.  The S/N ratio<br/>&gt; suffers as a result, but S/N isn&apos;t a major problem in<br/>&gt; microtonal music today.  Quantity is.</p><p>As they say, my mileage varies.</p><p>&gt; * It encourages experimentation, and later, a mix of<br/>&gt; experiments that have worked well in the past, leading to<br/>&gt; (possibly) the development of new genres.</p><p>And probably just as often, it tends to be navel-gazing, post-hippy meanderings. I have yet to ever be blown away by a microtonal improvisatory ensemble.</p><p>&gt; I would even suggest that the genesis of jazz and of American<br/>&gt; music in general is a good place to look for inspiration for<br/>&gt; microtonal music in the 21st century.</p><p>Maybe so. It just seems that, 35 years after the death of someone like Harry Partch, there is an incredible void. I often think no one has the stomach for the hard work that the earlier generation of microtonal musicians were willing to put up with.</p><p>Meh.
