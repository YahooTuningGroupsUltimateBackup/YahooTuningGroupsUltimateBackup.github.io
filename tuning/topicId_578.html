Help !&quot;</p><p>Thank you all for keeping the info flowing into my inbox.</p><p>I&apos;ve been trying to decide whether all steel guitars belong in the same<br/>list<br/>of guitarists. Sure they are called &quot;guitars&quot;, but some of them resemble<br/>a<br/>work bench.</p><p>I figure that to be in a guitar and closely related list, it has to either<br/>be held in your lap, or strapped around your neck. Otherwise<br/>Paganini would be a guitarist and pianos would be called guitars and the<br/>oceans would rise, and the ozone would vanish. And then we&apos;d need Kevin<br/>Costner to save us from that evil guy (who&apos;s uglier ?).</p><p>Anyhoo, could all the microtonal steel-guitarists please stand up and be<br/>counted.<br/>Let me know what kind of instrument you use, so I know where on the site<br/>to<br/>put you.
