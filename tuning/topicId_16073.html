Then get somone to play the same<br/>things in both the original and modified scale. Each time flipping a<br/>coin to see which tuning they play it in first, and keeping a record<br/>of the flips. Then you listen and try to pick which is the original<br/>scale each time and keep a record. After you&apos;ve done it enough times<br/>or with enough different pieces, stop and see how well you did.

To accept that we hear primeness requires adding some<br/>mysticism to the equation - and to repudiate certain Enlightenment<br/>assumptions in the process.  Not necessarilly a bad idea in itself,<br/>but perhaps inappropriate to an academic-like forum such as this<br/>where irrefutable lines of logic and verifiable results are the order<br/>of the day.  We can scientifically know that we hear and perceive<br/>things like beating and roughness, consonance and dissonance, and<br/>span in intervals.  We may never be able to verify whether or not we<br/>can perceive the mathematical properties themselves in intervals.<br/>There was a time when I was certain we could.
