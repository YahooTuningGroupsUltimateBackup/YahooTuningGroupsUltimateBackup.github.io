I have hesitated to go MIDI<br/>with it because I was worried that option *B* would glitch the attacks of<br/>notes, and that option *A* would be expensive. Please tell of your experience<br/>with MIDI on your guitar controller.</p><p>&gt; But I also want a JI-style fingerboard, and am having<br/>&gt; trouble visualizing what to do.<br/>&gt; Theres the Catler guitar - which looks great -<br/>&gt; but is highly complicated, and I think Id prefer something<br/>&gt; a lot simpler.<br/>&gt;<br/>Concerning fret placing. . .<br/>String tension increases when you fret a note. This can make some notes sound<br/>quite a bit sharper than you intended when designing your neck. The worst<br/>affected notes are those *very* near the nut, and those beyond the octave fret<br/>where the action gets high.</p><p>Before I had my 19-tet five-string bass made, I took a DAT to the luthiers shop<br/>and recorded all 24 notes of the A-string (the middle string) of a bass he had<br/>already made. This bass was fretted to 12th root of two. Back home I<br/>transferred the recording to my digital audio workstation then used it to find<br/>the exact frequency of the 24 notes. I then calculated the error between the<br/>expected frequency (given the fret placing) and the actual frequency (due to<br/>increased string tension).</p><p>I first worked out a fret placement for my bass using 19th root of two, then<br/>applied alterations to each fret position to reduce the error found in my<br/>experiment. Obviously I had to interpolate my 24 fret findings to determine 38<br/>fret alterations.</p><p>THE POINT IS:  If a JI-style fingerboard is to be accurate in order to minimise<br/>beating intervals, I believe consideration should be given to compensating for<br/>string tension when determining fret placement. Maybe I was too fussy with my<br/>38 fret bass, it is after all a set of compromised notes anyway... so a bit of<br/>string tension error on top of that is probably no big deal. *However*, I<br/>wouldn&apos;t like the perfection of JI to be spoilt by it.</p><p>DARREN McDOUGALL</p></div>
