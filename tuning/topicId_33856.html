Even within the relatively small sampling, there is<br/>a pretty wide variety of both styles and ... abilities. If nothing<br/>else, the Tuning Punks site on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> (which is what I believe you<br/>are referring to) shows some of that variety.</p><p>You might also want to drop in to Making Microtonal Music -</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic</a></p><p>It&apos;s a splinter list of people who wanted to talk a little more about<br/>the post-theoretical aspects of tuning, i.e. trying to create some<br/>music with the resources. They can point you to some music that<br/>*isn&apos;t* represented on the Tuning Punks page, though a number of<br/>those people are in MMM as well.</p><p>&gt; Where are your ears, how far can you stretch them in sanity ;)</p><p>Hey, mine are on two sides of my head, just like you!
