Unless this is in the same vein as throwing a clay<br/>&gt;pot,  where it is easily seen how simple it is to do (:)}}.</p><p>Well, it can&apos;t be too simple, or more pianos wouldn&apos;t be in the shape<br/>they&apos;re in, but...  Norman Henry showed me some stuff in like two hours,<br/>and I&apos;ve been doing my piano ever since.  I&apos;m not any kind of pro, but<br/>there just aren&apos;t enough variables to make it rocket science.</p><p>In NYC, they make a great secret knowledge of it.  The boys at<br/>Faust-Harrison won&apos;t take apprentices or even talk about their methods.<br/>Years of practice?  Maybe, but probably more like hours of practice and<br/>years to work your way up thru the pecking order at the dreaded Steinway<br/>factory.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Stride was developed on uprights, because it took that long for the keys<br/>to &gt;&gt;pop back up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A properly regulated upright will repeat faster than any stride I ever<br/>&gt;heard.  But an upright is not as fast as a grand, and I don&apos;t think ever<br/>&gt;will be.</p><p>A bit of an exaggeration.  Lots of things went into stride, and even on a<br/>junker the keys would be up long before a beat would pass...  Still, the<br/>novelty stuff seems to arrive just around the time that grands were<br/>becoming available...</p><p>Carl</p></div>
