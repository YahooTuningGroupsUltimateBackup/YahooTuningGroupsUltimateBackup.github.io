It&apos;s marked up by the performers (actually, this may be my conductor&apos;s score, I think I conducted it).</p><p>2) Copies of published articles from Mathematical Systems Theory</p><p>&quot;A Model for Patter Perception with Musical Applications: Part II: The Information Content of Pitch Structures&quot; (1978)</p><p>&quot; .... Part III: The Graph Embedding of Pitch Structures (1978)&quot;</p><p>A cv, circa 1980, with a list of publications (it says that Part IV &quot;will appear in Mathematical Systems Theory&quot;)</p><p>3) Copies of articles which I&apos;m not sure were ever published:</p><p>&quot;A Topological Model for the Perception of Context-Embedded Timbres&quot;</p><p>&quot;A Non-Procedural Language for Musical Composition&quot;</p><p>(and some wonderful ephemera, letters, drawings, etc., which made it worth the hunt).

David was a very important early influence on me and my work, and greatly respected by many of us in the old days, so I&apos;m overjoyed that there is renewed interest in his work.
