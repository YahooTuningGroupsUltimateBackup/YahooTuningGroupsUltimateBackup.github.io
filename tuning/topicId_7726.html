In 8 dimensions, there&apos;s so<br/>&gt;much space between the spheres in this packing that you can insert a whole<br/>&gt;other copy of the packing into the spaces, creating what I believe is<br/>&gt;called the Leech lattice. Paul Hahn probably knows more.</p><p>Interesting!  Quoting the original version of the article...</p><p>&gt;I believe this is also unproven (tho it works in 2 and 3 dimensions).  In<br/>&gt;fact, I have read things that seem to suggest it is not true.</p><p>&gt;&gt;6. The one structure with the highest chord/note ratio at limit X?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[#6.]  I am not aware of a proof, but there can be no doubt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sorry, it ain&apos;t so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;5-limit diamond:<br/>&gt;6 consonant chords, 7 notes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Weird 12-tone scale:<br/>&gt;13 consonant chords, 12 notes</p><p>Thanks for pointing that out!  I was too hasty.  What I should have said is<br/>that they have the highest saturated-chord/note ratio of any scale with as<br/>many or fewer notes.  Hmm.  Maybe the rule even holds for scales of<br/>cardinality up to 2x, or something. . .</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
