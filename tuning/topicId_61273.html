I, myself interest in the<br/>possibility to expand tuning (meaning mostly for programmed<br/>synthesizers or musical sound synthesis software, but not necessary)<br/>to 2-dimensional, adding yet one parameter, in order to make sound<br/>more natural and to solve at least the problem of naturalness of sound<br/>(i. e. the &quot;natural&quot; sounding versus the &quot;synthetic&quot; one). (This<br/>problem has one very strange aspect: A musician, listening a &quot;natural&quot;<br/>recording through a phone, that cuts up all higher harmonics, still<br/>says the music is natural, but a programmer can&apos;t achieve the natural<br/>sounding via synthesis even having all harmonics, that present in the<br/>best recordings. The controversy was tried to solve, saying that it<br/>means, that naturalness originates in chaos. But I  disagree, that<br/>such regular sensation, that is naturalness of  musical sound {not of<br/>sound in general, which naturalness, e g. reverberations in a room,<br/>has already been synthesized successfully}, could be caused by totally<br/>irregular processes, especially that people identify this naturalness<br/>with harmony and perfection[!]). And I think, that  this problem lies<br/>more in theoretic than in practical synthesis, and any new ideas<br/>(including the throughly forgotten old) could be useful. What concerns<br/>the idea of multidimensional tuning concretely, I&apos;ve written an<br/>abstract &quot;The 2-dimensional tuning. A mathematical model&quot;, where I put<br/>my ideas on it in mathematical form(You may read it from<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> ). The abstract also<br/>contains preface with more detailed explaining, what I speak about.<br/>Now, if somebody interests in this idea (either in general, or in my<br/>version that&apos;s in the abstract), I think, we may start a discussion or<br/>simply to share information on it.<br/>Yet , if anybody is interested, but can&apos;t read my abstract from the<br/>address above, please write me, and I&apos;ll send You the file via e-mail,<br/>whenever I have known about.</p><p>Linas</p></div><h3><a id=61300 href="#61300">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2005 9:56:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Linas Plankis&quot; &lt;linasrim@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...

Perhaps we<br/>shouldn&apos;t pay attention to what ones say, but I&apos;ve<br/>heard the same estimation from people who were far<br/>from admiring classical music or disliking electronic<br/>devices. And this situation raises necessary question,<br/>why one couldn&apos;t synthesize sound, that was according<br/>with preferences and tastes of the people, that think<br/>the way, I described. And where&apos;s a problem, when both<br/>synthetic sound and the sound of &iuml;&iquest;&half;natural&iuml;&iquest;&half; recordings<br/>consists the same way of 44100 numbers per second? And<br/>how it concerns possibilities of tuning?<br/>2.When we make different tunings we need to classify<br/>them some way. I found, that nobody can say<br/>definitely, what parameters of a tuned scale (as<br/>number of sounds in the octave, deviation from well<br/>tempered scales and so on) are more essential for good<br/>classifying<br/>3.The similar problem is with a prognosis what a<br/>tuning will be like, when we know parameters of a<br/>scale, having not heard sound yet. Perhaps somebody<br/>knows more about it, but I didn&apos;t find how to know<br/>properties of a group of certain scales (when choosing<br/>the one necessary) without long hours of testing.<br/>4.And the so called ethnic tunings also are worth to<br/>think about. Why do the same pitch divisions cause<br/>such different musical effects (compare, for example,<br/>the Western European heptatonics with the Southern<br/>Asian one, or the Eastern Asian pentatonics with the<br/>North American one /meaning the pentatonics that&apos;s<br/>discussed up right now here/). How the same division<br/>can have such different consequences for music<br/>composition?</p><p>THE ABSTRACT</p><p>I didn&apos;t find good answers to these questions, and<br/>decided to create myself, what helped me to solve them<br/>at least partially. I don&apos;t know, if anybody else has<br/>similar ideas, that&apos;s why I wrote to the tuning group.<br/>Some of my ideas i put to the abstract &iuml;&iquest;&half;the<br/>two-dimensional tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>(<a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> )</p><p>Now, the main idea of what i wrote, was, that we<br/>(including the earlier myself) make a mistake,<br/>thinking, that process of tuning is a division of<br/>one-dimensional range of pitch. When it actually<br/>should be two-dimensional. This idea is very similar,<br/>but i couldn&apos;t choose anything instead of this,<br/>because all one-dimensional ideas have been already<br/>tried. Many of them were tried also by people, who<br/>participate in the group here.<br/>And what background ideas do we have, to say, that<br/>tuning should be two dimensional?:</p><p>1.The first background idea is , that our inner<br/>imagination of pitch isn&apos;t one-dimensional. What do i<br/>mean? We imagine a pitch, storing at last two<br/>parameters for each sound (that is, for pure pitch<br/>representing without yet other musical parameters) in<br/>our memory. Where we may know it from? It isn&apos;t a<br/>difficult thing. Tuning or singing, we divide<br/>continued line of frequencies into tones. But any such<br/>division , or discretization, needs yet one parameter<br/>to do it.<br/>2.The next idea is, that since earlier times, there<br/>were cues about two-dimensional character of tuning.<br/>The well known example of these cues is our musical<br/>notation system. It obviously could be simpler for<br/>one-dimensional representing (for example, having<br/>simply 12 steps for each octave), but the additional<br/>possibilities here are cues to two-dimensional<br/>character of tuning (these additional possibilities<br/>are skipped, for example, in the standard midi scale,<br/>thus reducing it to one-dimensional indeed). An<br/>example of these additional possibilities is the fact,<br/>that C-sharp and D-flat, for example, are supposed<br/>categorically different sounds in the system with no<br/>or minimal pitch difference, and nobody doubted, that<br/>such distinction is real, for long time.</p><p>Now, if i say, that tuning has two dimensions, i<br/>should say, how to find these two dimensions. Some<br/>things are said in my abstract<br/>(<a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> ),<br/>but i see now, that they aren&apos;t said sufficiently<br/>clearly. But the main idea is like this:<br/>I take acoustic frequency as the first dimension. And<br/>i take another parameter, let&apos;s say parameter x, as<br/>the second dimension. Say, we don&apos;t know, what the<br/>next dimension is like to. But we can try to find<br/>something, that is obvious or that is similarity of<br/>truth. Modeling this way, skipping less acceptable<br/>possibilities and assuming more acceptable, it&apos;s<br/>possible to achieve interesting results. The main of<br/>these is the rule (it&apos;s called the second law of the<br/>harmonic tuning in the abstract), that says, that for<br/>harmonic tuning value of the second dimension equals<br/>to deviation of the pitch frequencies ( that is, of<br/>the first dimension values) of a given scale (relative<br/>to an equal tempered scale) raised by a certain<br/>degree.<br/>Without other interesting possibilities this rule has<br/>the consequence, that deviation of the pitch<br/>frequencies of a given scale relative to an equally<br/>tempered scale is the main characteristic of a given<br/>scale (meaning, that tunings like 12-EDO are more sets<br/>of necessary scales than musical scales themselves).<br/>And it works. After making this conclusion we could<br/>even skip the dimension x and use the pitch frequency<br/>only, but already knowing the rule.<br/>But if anybody wants to try possibilities of the<br/>adding the x-parameter to real tuning, there is a<br/>restriction. Such experiments aren&apos;t possible, using<br/>using software that works exclusively with midi data,<br/>nor with any EMI-s or other devices, that have<br/>predefined one-dimensional tuning scale. Such<br/>experiments are possible with the synthesizing<br/>programs like csound or clm.</p><p>SO, i tried to answer Your question, but not knowing,<br/>if i did. I afraid that there could be other things<br/>that need explaining.

The term is<br/>conditional (at least by many aspects) and it doesn&apos;t mean directly<br/>the timbre hardness as one hears it. It&apos;s a process with frequency,<br/>that&apos;s called this way, and not vice versa, not the timbre hardness is<br/>suggested to have frequency here. I could call it differently than<br/>hardness, but almost all words have connotations with something known.<br/>So, hardness is simply a name for the 2nd dimension and it doesn&apos;t<br/>coincide with timbre hardness.</p><p>Montal&apos;s 1830s instructions about piano tuning rested upon words like<br/>hard and soft besides sharp and flat (it makes a nice allusion to hard<br/>and soft wires that sound like their names), but I think also there is<br/>an established translation about old tetrachord divisions called hard<br/>and soft.</p><p>Maybe that first is in some sense related, these kinds of second<br/>dimensions in tuning. It is familiar that the standard tuning for<br/>piano is in fact not exactly standard because of the behavior in each<br/>instrument. Although this is from timbre it is not so easily heard<br/>like in a bell, tuning sets so that the imagined temperament is<br/>modified by some varying amounts to sound better (either to the tuner<br/>or else to the musician, it is not decided!).  In fact there is a<br/>modern French piano tuning patenting such things so that the equal<br/>temperament has sharper fifths (perhaps also the same is the Steinway<br/>tuning, of course it will be different used on a Pleyel). If we are<br/>lucky this dimension that can be calculated with some accuracy is used<br/>constructing the instrument and afterwards tuning machines can<br/>interpolate a pattern using few measurements, although one newer<br/>device will measure notes dynamically because the sound changes with<br/>the pitch being tuned, otherwise guided hearing organized series of<br/>comparisons. But also the roughness from simultaneous notes tuned to<br/>the same difference changes with their pitches, if there is some<br/>timbre so that a tuner may like to adjust making intervals sound<br/>better in different registers. There are also studies about sine waves<br/>suggesting preference of sharpened octaves that sometimes might<br/>explain why it is common finding highest notes in pianos tuned  higher<br/>than where they sound strongest, in a way that they exceed adjustment<br/>from the mechanical inharmonicity (other times it might be from those<br/>studies directly, built into some tuning machines and maybe some<br/>schools).</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=61606 href="#61606">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2005 8:30:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi again Linas,</p><p>On Mon, 17 Oct 2005, you (Linas Plankis) wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- Yahya Abdal-Aziz &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Linas,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Thu, 13 Oct 2005, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...

Perhaps we<br/>&gt; shouldn&apos;t pay attention to what ones say, but I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard the same estimation from people who were far<br/>&gt; from admiring classical music or disliking electronic<br/>&gt; devices. And this situation raises necessary question,<br/>&gt; why one couldn&apos;t synthesize sound, that was according<br/>&gt; with preferences and tastes of the people, that think<br/>&gt; the way, I described. And where&apos;s a problem, when both<br/>&gt; synthetic sound and the sound of &iuml;&iquest;&half;natural&iuml;&iquest;&half; recordings<br/>&gt; consists the same way of 44100 numbers per second? And<br/>&gt; how it concerns possibilities of tuning?</p><p>So two reasons for your theory are: an attempt to<br/>understand why some people regard MIDI recordings<br/>as less satisfactory than other kinds of sound recording,<br/>including electronic music - and to begin to remedy that.</p><p>&gt; 2.When we make different tunings we need to classify<br/>&gt; them some way. I found, that nobody can say<br/>&gt; definitely, what parameters of a tuned scale (as<br/>&gt; number of sounds in the octave, deviation from well<br/>&gt; tempered scales and so on) are more essential for good<br/>&gt; classifying</p><p>A good classification, surely, is one that suits your needs<br/>and your purposes.  If this is true, then programs like<br/>Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala do go a long way towards<br/>giving us the information, based on which we can classify<br/>tunings and scales in very many different ways.  The<br/>problem, as I see it, is not a lack of information but<br/>simply a lack of direction.  We must ask ourselves:<br/>What do we want this tuning to do for us?</p><p>&gt; 3.The similar problem is with a prognosis what a<br/>&gt; tuning will be like, when we know parameters of a<br/>&gt; scale, having not heard sound yet. Perhaps somebody<br/>&gt; knows more about it, but I didn&apos;t find how to know<br/>&gt; properties of a group of certain scales (when choosing<br/>&gt; the one necessary) without long hours of testing.</p><p>You&apos;re impatient?  Look at how many centuries, millenia<br/>of accumulated musical experience is summarised in the<br/>knowledge made available by using resources such as<br/>Scala, or Joe Monzo&apos;s &quot;Tonalsoft Encyclopedia of<br/>Microtonal Music Theory&quot;.  Surely it&apos;s worth spending<br/>a few hours or days to review this material and see<br/>what use you can make of it?</p><p>&gt; 4.And the so called ethnic tunings also are worth to<br/>&gt; think about. Why do the same pitch divisions cause<br/>&gt; such different musical effects (compare, for example,<br/>&gt; the Western European heptatonics with the Southern<br/>&gt; Asian one, or the Eastern Asian pentatonics with the<br/>&gt; North American one /meaning the pentatonics that&apos;s<br/>&gt; discussed up right now here/). How the same division<br/>&gt; can have such different consequences for music<br/>&gt; composition?</p><p>I hope you&apos;re not overlooking the obvious - music is<br/>arguably just as much about time as about pitch - some<br/>say more.  For you can have a distinctly musical<br/>experience involving rhythmic drumming, without any<br/>clear pitch or scale being involved.  Contrariwise, few<br/>of us feel that it is music to play several pitches drawn<br/>from a scale randomly, with no regard to organising<br/>those pitches in time.</p><p>The less obvious point to make here is that - as we have<br/>recently seen in the discussion of blues tunings on this<br/>list - although two different musical cultures may use<br/>exactly the same scale as a formal basis, their micro-<br/>tonal interpretation of that scale may be very different.<br/>Indeed, some kinds of music, based largely on those<br/>instruments which can readily be played at fixed pitch,<br/>evolve styles in which purity of pitch and timbre become<br/>goals, whilst other cultures pursue a contrary goal of<br/>maximum expressiveness of intonation through varying<br/>pitch and timbre.  Contrast, for instance, the norms of<br/>European opera traditions with those of Chinese opera<br/>traditions; both of which rely heavily on the use of the<br/>(heptatonic) diatonic scale.  Or contrast the concert<br/>flute with the shakuhachi.  The point I&apos;m making here<br/>is that the &quot;official&quot; or theoretical scale is very often<br/>_not_ the scale as played in actual practice by the best<br/>musicians.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; THE ABSTRACT<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t find good answers to these questions, and<br/>&gt; decided to create myself, what helped me to solve them<br/>&gt; at least partially. I don&apos;t know, if anybody else has<br/>&gt; similar ideas, that&apos;s why I wrote to the tuning group.<br/>&gt; Some of my ideas i put to the abstract &iuml;&iquest;&half;the<br/>&gt; two-dimensional tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, the main idea of what i wrote, was, that we<br/>&gt; (including the earlier myself) make a mistake,<br/>&gt; thinking, that process of tuning is a division of<br/>&gt; one-dimensional range of pitch. When it actually<br/>&gt; should be two-dimensional.</p><p>What still strikes me as very strange at this point,<br/>is that although you say there should be two dimensions<br/>to tuning - yet you can&apos;t name or describe the second<br/>one.  To me this seems to be an idea you haven&apos;t yet got<br/>very clear in your own mind.  And why should there not<br/>be seven dimensions instead?</p><p>&gt; ... This idea is very similar,<br/>&gt; but i couldn&apos;t choose anything instead of this,<br/>&gt; because all one-dimensional ideas have been already<br/>&gt; tried. Many of them were tried also by people, who<br/>&gt; participate in the group here.<br/>&gt; And what background ideas do we have, to say, that<br/>&gt; tuning should be two dimensional?:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.The first background idea is , that our inner<br/>&gt; imagination of pitch isn&apos;t one-dimensional. What do i<br/>&gt; mean? We imagine a pitch, storing at last two<br/>&gt; parameters for each sound (that is, for pure pitch<br/>&gt; representing without yet other musical parameters) in<br/>&gt; our memory. Where we may know it from? It isn&apos;t a<br/>&gt; difficult thing. Tuning or singing, we divide<br/>&gt; continued line of frequencies into tones. But any such<br/>&gt; division , or discretization, needs yet one parameter<br/>&gt; to do it.</p><p>So you&apos;re saying we can divide the continuum of<br/>frequencies at any point, to choose the pitches of our<br/>tuning?  Yes, we do this.  But this involves a single<br/>dimension - more exactly, a specific measurable<br/>quantity, namely the fundamental frequency of the<br/>notes produced by our musical instruments.  There is<br/>no other dimension, no other measurable quantity,<br/>which we use when specifying a tuning.  If you say<br/>there SHOULD be, then what is that dimension?<br/>We measure frequency in Hertz; in what units can we<br/>measure your new dimension?</p><p>&gt; 2.The next idea is, that since earlier times, there<br/>&gt; were cues about two-dimensional character of tuning.<br/>&gt; The well known example of these cues is our musical<br/>&gt; notation system.</p><p>Which clearly represents, chiefly, pitch against time.<br/>Pitch is the dimension of tuning, whilst time is the<br/>dimension of meter and rhythm.  Meter is not a tuning<br/>phenomenon, nor is rhythm.  So our musical notation<br/>system represents pitch in one dimension only.</p><p>&gt; ... It obviously could be simpler for<br/>&gt; one-dimensional representing (for example, having<br/>&gt; simply 12 steps for each octave), but the additional<br/>&gt; possibilities here are cues to two-dimensional<br/>&gt; character of tuning (these additional possibilities<br/>&gt; are skipped, for example, in the standard midi scale,<br/>&gt; thus reducing it to one-dimensional indeed). An<br/>&gt; example of these additional possibilities is the fact,<br/>&gt; that C-sharp and D-flat, for example, are supposed<br/>&gt; categorically different sounds in the system with no<br/>&gt; or minimal pitch difference, and nobody doubted, that<br/>&gt; such distinction is real, for long time.</p><p>Only in specially constructed tuning systems, such as<br/>12-EDO, can we regard C# and Db as the same note<br/>for some - though not all - purposes.  In most historical<br/>tuning systems, they are indeed set at different<br/>pitches.   In such systems, there is a difference of<br/>value between the two notes on the single dimension of<br/>tuning - namely pitch.  You still haven&apos;t shown a need<br/>for a second dimension.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, if i say, that tuning has two dimensions, i<br/>&gt; should say, how to find these two dimensions. Some<br/>&gt; things are said in my abstract<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> ),</p><p>I&apos;ve tried repeatedly to look this up, but am having<br/>difficulties with my internet connection. I will try<br/>again if you think that would help me understand<br/>your meaning better.</p><p>&gt; ... but i see now, that they aren&apos;t said sufficiently<br/>&gt; clearly. But the main idea is like this:<br/>&gt; I take acoustic frequency as the first dimension. And<br/>&gt; i take another parameter, let&apos;s say parameter x, as<br/>&gt; the second dimension. Say, we don&apos;t know, what the<br/>&gt; next dimension is like to. But we can try to find<br/>&gt; something, that is obvious or that is similarity of<br/>&gt; truth. Modeling this way, skipping less acceptable<br/>&gt; possibilities and assuming more acceptable, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible to achieve interesting results. The main of<br/>&gt; these is the rule (it&apos;s called the second law of the<br/>&gt; harmonic tuning in the abstract), that says:</p><p>I would like to understand this &quot;law&quot;:<br/>&gt; ... that for<br/>&gt; harmonic tuning value of the second dimension equals<br/>&gt; to deviation of the pitch frequencies ( that is, of<br/>&gt; the first dimension values) of a given scale (relative<br/>&gt; to an equal tempered scale) raised by a certain<br/>&gt; degree.<br/>... but I find it doesn&apos;t actually make sense as a<br/>sentence of the English language.  Should there<br/>perhaps be a comma after &quot;harmonic tuning&quot;?  And may<br/>I try paraphrasing a little?  If so, your law might read -</p><p>&quot;For harmonic tuning, the value of the second dimension<br/>equals the deviation of the pitch frequencies (that is, of<br/>the first dimension values) of a given scale (from an<br/>equal tempered scale with the same number of notes)<br/>raised to a fixed degree.&quot;</p><p>So, we might have a 12-EDO scale consisting of:<br/>C      0   (cents)  0<br/>C#  100              0<br/>D     200             0<br/>D# 300              0<br/>E     400              0<br/>F     500              0<br/>F#  600              0<br/>G     700              0<br/>G#  800              0<br/>A     900              0<br/>A# 1000             0<br/>B     1100             0<br/>C&apos;    1200            0</p><p>and a 12-UDO scale consisting of:<br/>C      0   (cents)  0    (cents^2)<br/>C#  110              100<br/>D     200              0<br/>D# 320              400<br/>E     400              0<br/>F     500              0<br/>F#  630              900<br/>G     700              0<br/>G#  840              1600<br/>A     900              0<br/>A# 1050             2500<br/>B     1100             0<br/>C&apos;    1200            0</p><p>if we chose for our fixed power the number 2.</p><p>How could we use the second column of figures<br/>- the squared deviations from equal, in cents<br/>squared - to differentiate this tuning from<br/>another one?   Say, one in which the second<br/>dimension used the power 0.5?</p><p>Whatever value I give to that power, I&apos;m at a<br/>loss to understand how I could use that second<br/>column.  Particularly when you say it&apos;s &quot;for<br/>harmonic tuning&quot;.  As  iunderstand it, &quot;harmonic<br/>tuning&quot; ought to mean &quot;tuning so that some<br/>notes are harmonics ie overtones of other<br/>notes&quot;.  But your deviation-power law doesn&apos;t<br/>give harmonics or overtones, which are notes<br/>whose frequencies are simple integer multiples.</p><p>&gt; Without ...</p><p>[considering]?</p><p>&gt; ... other interesting possibilities this rule has<br/>&gt; the consequence, that deviation of the pitch<br/>&gt; frequencies of a given scale relative to an equally<br/>&gt; tempered scale is the main characteristic of a given<br/>&gt; scale (meaning, that tunings like 12-EDO are more sets<br/>&gt; of necessary scales than musical scales themselves).<br/>&gt; And it works.</p><p>??? How?</p><p>&gt; ... After making this conclusion we could<br/>&gt; even skip the dimension x and use the pitch frequency<br/>&gt; only, but already knowing the rule.</p><p>OK, suppose we skip the second dimension, and use only<br/>the fundamental frequency of a note.  (This is what the<br/>rest of us still do.)  What does &quot;knowing the rule&quot; mean?<br/>That somehow the (squared, say) deviations of the<br/>tuning from 12-EDO are useful harmonically?  I think I<br/>showed above that they are not.</p><p>&gt; But if anybody wants to try possibilities of the<br/>&gt; adding the x-parameter to real tuning, there is a<br/>&gt; restriction. Such experiments aren&apos;t possible, using<br/>&gt; using software that works exclusively with midi data,<br/>&gt; nor with any EMI-s or other devices, that have<br/>&gt; predefined one-dimensional tuning scale. Such<br/>&gt; experiments are possible with the synthesizing<br/>&gt; programs like csound or clm.</p><p>Suppose I use a MIDI-capable compositional tool,<br/>such as NoteWorthy Composer.  With this, I create<br/>MIDI files, which I then use to play my MIDI<br/>keyboard.  That keyboard incorporates a whole pile of<br/>sampled instruments in its hardware.  In the MIDI file,<br/>I include pitch-bends as well as standard MIDI note<br/>numbers, so that I can sweep through all frequencies<br/>from the lowest MIDI note to the highest.  Because<br/>the keyboard has a high degree of polyphony, I can<br/>layer many instruments simultaneously.</p><p>Now suppose I use a soft synth like csound, or even<br/>a hardware synth such as my old Moog.  I will grant<br/>you that these synths can create some fairly simple<br/>sounds that I can&apos;t get from the MIDI keyboard.<br/>But almost any of the more complex sounds they<br/>make can be approximated on the MIDI keyboard.<br/>This is as true of their pitch as of their timbre.</p><p>So why can&apos;t I do the same experiments with either<br/>setup?  Probably more important - how do you<br/>propose I should go about doing such experiments,<br/>say in csound, when you can&apos;t tell me what parameter<br/>I need to change?  What are the units of measure of<br/>this fictitious dimension?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; SO, i tried to answer Your question, but not knowing,<br/>&gt; if i did. I afraid that there could be other things<br/>&gt; that need explaining. And i&apos;ll be glad, if You give me<br/>&gt; some hint, what isn&apos;t clear more concretely.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve tried to show you why I still don&apos;t<br/>understand you.

The term is<br/>&gt; conditional (at least by many aspects) and it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t mean directly<br/>&gt; the timbre hardness as one hears it. It&apos;s a process<br/>&gt; with frequency,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s called this way, and not vice versa, not the<br/>&gt; timbre hardness is<br/>&gt; suggested to have frequency here. I could call it<br/>&gt; differently than<br/>&gt; hardness, but almost all words have connotations<br/>&gt; with something known.<br/>&gt; So, hardness is simply a name for the 2nd dimension<br/>&gt; and it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; coincide with timbre hardness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Montal&apos;s 1830s instructions about piano tuning<br/>&gt; rested upon words like<br/>&gt; hard and soft besides sharp and flat (it makes a<br/>&gt; nice allusion to hard<br/>&gt; and soft wires that sound like their names), but I<br/>&gt; think also there is<br/>&gt; an established translation about old tetrachord<br/>&gt; divisions called hard<br/>&gt; and soft.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe that first is in some sense related, these<br/>&gt; kinds of second<br/>&gt; dimensions in tuning. It is familiar that the<br/>&gt; standard tuning for<br/>&gt; piano is in fact not exactly standard because of the<br/>&gt; behavior in each<br/>&gt; instrument. Although this is from timbre it is not<br/>&gt; so easily heard<br/>&gt; like in a bell, tuning sets so that the imagined<br/>&gt; temperament is<br/>&gt; modified by some varying amounts to sound better<br/>&gt; (either to the tuner<br/>&gt; or else to the musician, it is not decided!).  In<br/>&gt; fact there is a<br/>&gt; modern French piano tuning patenting such things so<br/>&gt; that the equal<br/>&gt; temperament has sharper fifths (perhaps also the<br/>&gt; same is the Steinway<br/>&gt; tuning, of course it will be different used on a<br/>&gt; Pleyel). If we are<br/>&gt; lucky this dimension that can be calculated with<br/>&gt; some accuracy is used<br/>&gt; constructing the instrument and afterwards tuning<br/>&gt; machines can<br/>&gt; interpolate a pattern using few measurements,<br/>&gt; although one newer<br/>&gt; device will measure notes dynamically because the<br/>&gt; sound changes with<br/>&gt; the pitch being tuned, otherwise guided hearing<br/>&gt; organized series of<br/>&gt; comparisons. But also the roughness from<br/>&gt; simultaneous notes tuned to<br/>&gt; the same difference changes with their pitches, if<br/>&gt; there is some<br/>&gt; timbre so that a tuner may like to adjust making<br/>&gt; intervals sound<br/>&gt; better in different registers. There are also<br/>&gt; studies about sine waves<br/>&gt; suggesting preference of sharpened octaves that<br/>&gt; sometimes might<br/>&gt; explain why it is common finding highest notes in<br/>&gt; pianos tuned  higher<br/>&gt; than where they sound strongest, in a way that they<br/>&gt; exceed adjustment<br/>&gt; from the mechanical inharmonicity (other times it<br/>&gt; might be from those<br/>&gt; studies directly, built into some tuning machines<br/>&gt; and maybe some<br/>&gt; schools).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clark<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Hello, Clark.</p><p>Thanks for the useful examples, You gave.<br/>I, for example, myself, often think, that the human<br/>hearing of sound, namely the part of it, that is<br/>called &iuml;&iquest;&half;subjective&iuml;&iquest;&half; has some compensation mechanisms,<br/>that collate dynamics, microreverberations, certain<br/>elements of timbre and the fundamental frequency to<br/>one phenomenon, that we call pitch (in the<br/>psychoacoustic sense). But all this is in microlevel<br/>only, so we hear greater changes of timbre, dynamics,<br/>etc as timbre, dynamics, but smaller steps already<br/>affect compensation mechanisms, being collated to one<br/>pitch.<br/>But the recognition, that pitch of hearing is composed<br/>from different acoustic elements doesn&apos;t make a<br/>mathematical theory. So, i see my theory as an example<br/>or as an attempt, but this attempt seems not far from<br/>the truth. But the person, who will completely<br/>describe, what the dimension &iuml;&iquest;&half;x&iuml;&iquest;&half; completely means<br/>acoustically, and if we should be satisfied with 2<br/>dimensions only, that person will be a great<br/>discoverer. Such person should be also an excellent<br/>tuning master (meaning traditional tuning) and so on<br/>and also be keen in electronic acoustics.<br/>I only think, that the dimension &iuml;&iquest;&half;x&iuml;&iquest;&half; exists, and<br/>tuning shouldn&apos;t have more than 2 dimensions, because<br/>it would be very difficult to manage the structure in<br/>the case. But the x dimension can without many doubts<br/>be composed from few acoustic elements.</p><p>Linas</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Start your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page!<br/><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></p></div><h3><a id=61627 href="#61627">ðŸ”—</a>Linas Plankis &#x3C;linasrim@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2005 8:58:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Yahya.<br/>Thanks for Your questions. Your counterarguments are<br/>known for me. And i didn&apos;t call, what i said,<br/>arguments or proofs, saying only they are questions to<br/>think and cues. If I had a non controversial non<br/>refutable proof, I would put it in the initial section<br/>of all this.<br/>For example, speaking about ethnic music, You say,<br/>that<br/>&gt; hope you&apos;re not overlooking the obvious - music is<br/>&gt;arguably just as much about time as about pitch -<br/>some<br/>&gt;say more.  For you can have a distinctly musical<br/>&gt;experience involving rhythmic drumming, without any<br/>&gt;clear pitch or scale being involved.  Contrariwise,<br/>few<br/>&gt;of us feel that it is music to play several pitches<br/>drawn<br/>&gt;from a scale randomly, with no regard to organising<br/>&gt;those pitches in time.<br/>No, I actually am not overlooking this fact, and even<br/>could add, that not every compositional aspect, that<br/>involves pitch, is caused by character of tuning.<br/>There are other things, including both compositional<br/>theories and cultural background of a particular<br/>nation. But some facts prompt to think about different<br/>understanding of tuning, even having the same scale of<br/>fundamental frequencies.<br/>Now, i&apos;d prefer to reply to each Your argument, but<br/>one of them needs to be answered first. I assum, that<br/>others are still hanging in this case.<br/>You write:<br/>&gt;I would like to understand this &quot;law&quot;:<br/>&gt;&gt; ... that for<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic tuning value of the second dimension<br/>equals<br/>&gt;&gt; to deviation of the pitch frequencies ( that is, of<br/>&gt;&gt; the first dimension values) of a given scale<br/>(relative<br/>&gt;&gt; to an equal tempered scale) raised by a certain<br/>&gt;&gt; degree.<br/>&gt;... but I find it doesn&apos;t actually make sense as a<br/>&gt;sentence of the English language.  Should there<br/>&gt;perhaps be a comma after &quot;harmonic tuning&quot;?  And may<br/>&gt;I try paraphrasing a little?  If so, your law might<br/>read -</p><p>&gt;&quot;For harmonic tuning, the value of the second<br/>dimension<br/>&gt;equals the deviation of the pitch frequencies (that<br/>is, of<br/>&gt;the first dimension values) of a given scale (from an<br/>&gt;equal tempered scale with the same number of notes)<br/>&gt;raised to a fixed degree.&quot;</p><p>&gt;So, we might have a 12-EDO scale consisting of:<br/>&gt;C      0   (cents)  0<br/>&gt;C#  100              0<br/>&gt;D     200             0<br/>&gt;D# 300              0<br/>&gt;E     400              0<br/>&gt;F     500              0<br/>&gt;F#  600              0<br/>&gt;G     700              0<br/>&gt;G#  800              0<br/>&gt;A     900              0<br/>&gt;A# 1000             0<br/>&gt;B     1100             0<br/>&gt;C&apos;    1200            0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;and a 12-UDO scale consisting of:<br/>&gt;C      0   (cents)  0    (cents^2)<br/>&gt;C#  110              100<br/>&gt;D     200              0<br/>&gt;D# 320              400<br/>&gt;E     400              0<br/>&gt;F     500              0<br/>&gt;F#  630              900<br/>&gt;G     700              0<br/>&gt;G#  840              1600<br/>&gt;A     900              0<br/>&gt;A# 1050             2500<br/>&gt;B     1100             0<br/>&gt;C&apos;    1200            0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;if we chose for our fixed power the number 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How could we use the second column of figures<br/>&gt;- the squared deviations from equal, in cents<br/>&gt;squared - to differentiate this tuning from<br/>&gt;another one?   Say, one in which the second<br/>&gt;dimension used the power 0.5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Whatever value I give to that power, I&apos;m at a<br/>&gt;loss to understand how I could use that second<br/>&gt;column.  Particularly when you say it&apos;s &quot;for<br/>&gt;harmonic tuning&quot;.  As  iunderstand it, &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt;tuning&quot; ought to mean &quot;tuning so that some<br/>&gt;notes are harmonics ie overtones of other<br/>&gt;notes&quot;.  But your deviation-power law doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;give harmonics or overtones, which are notes<br/>&gt;whose frequencies are simple integer multiples.</p><p>Yes, the definition, that i gave here for the formula,<br/>is too weak in the sense of English (particularly &iuml;&iquest;&half;by<br/>degree&iuml;&iquest;&half;). It couldn&apos;t lead to any other thing than<br/>misunderstanding. We compare simply two scales here.<br/>If we compare pure frequencies we divide each value<br/>from a scale, that is under analysis, by its<br/>respective value from the EDO with the same number of<br/>sounds. If we compare logarithmic values, as values in<br/>cents, we should subtract instead of dividing. Also<br/>the scaler exists, which is an index of degree in the<br/>case with pure frequencies and is simple multiplier in<br/>the case with cents. But we can not use the scaler at<br/>all, when we get results for analysis of a scale only.<br/>It&apos;s necessary in the context of other parts of theory<br/>only. So, the formula will be<br/>X(n) = (P(n) &iuml;&iquest;&half; Pet(n))*a.<br/>(X(n) is the dimension X, the hardness as I&apos;ve call it<br/>in the abstract, P(n) is the n-th value of fundamental<br/>frequency of the searched scale and Pet(n) is the<br/>value of fundamental frequency of  the EDO with the<br/>same number of sounds, while a is the scaler)<br/>We may skip &apos;a&apos;, as i&apos;ve said, and change &apos;Pet(n)&apos; to<br/>&apos;1200*n/m&apos; (where m is a number of sounds in the<br/>searched scale), getting:<br/>X(n) = P(n) &iuml;&iquest;&half; 1200*n/m<br/>Now, having the formula, which representing should be<br/>more clear than my English, we can do the same what<br/>You tried. But there&apos;s one thing. I think, we should<br/>distinguish compositional scales and general scales<br/>here (I do this distinction in my theory). For it&apos;s<br/>not serious to talk about harmonic tuning of a general<br/>scale, which actually is a set of scales to choose.<br/>Harmonic or not harmonic can only be a scale, that is<br/>used for composing. So, i&apos;ll take the heptatonics and<br/>C-dur as a particular case of it, and the C-dur will<br/>be based on 12-EDO. If You prefer 12-tonics, we may<br/>calculate a respective example later.<br/>Now, The first column contains relative frequency<br/>values in cents:<br/>C      0   (cents)<br/>D    200<br/>E    400<br/>F    500<br/>G    700<br/>A    900<br/>B   1100<br/>C   1200</p><p>And values of frequency of the 7-EDO are these:<br/>0(C)     0   (cents)<br/>1(D)     171.4<br/>2(E)     342.9<br/>3(F)     514.3<br/>4(G)     685.7<br/>5(A)     857.1<br/>6(B)    1028.6<br/>7(C)    1200</p><p>The difference will be:<br/>C        0   (cents)<br/>D      28.6<br/>E      57.1<br/>F     -14.3<br/>G      14.3<br/>A      42.9<br/>B      71.4<br/>C        0</p><p>And this column gives  good background data for<br/>analysis of the scale. For example, you may draw a<br/>graph (with number in the x  and result in the y).<br/>Now, imagine, that we look at shape of the graph.<br/>Number of peaks, growing or descending of X(n) and<br/>other aspects of the distribution are significant,<br/>analyzing the scale. And i&apos;m almost ensured from my<br/>experiments, that, if we analyze a scale this way,<br/>similar shapes give always similar sounding and<br/>similar compositional effects. Obviously one may<br/>analyze any other scale this way. I myself yet group<br/>scales into pattern scales and not pattern, or<br/>secondary, scales. The pattern scales are those, that<br/>have similar range of X(n) values to the range of  the<br/>C-dur (actually i use always the same range, and<br/>different value of the scaler, but it&apos;s the same). The<br/>C-dur is chosen, because it&apos;s perhaps the best tested<br/>scale in the history of mankind, but it&apos;s conditional.</p><p>And yet. Perhaps the proposed procedure itself isn&apos;t<br/>new, but i tried to give not only the procedure , but<br/>a different approach too.<br/>The other answers to be continued, as i&apos;ve wrote.<br/>Linas.</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

In this way it<br/>does not differ at all from the device of placing notes<br/>at different heights on a staff.  We can readily see<br/>this must be so, because, when playing an instrument<br/>of fixed intonation, such as a piano or organ, if that<br/>instrument is tuned to 12-EDO, a player must play<br/>exactly the same note (strike exactly the same key)<br/>when the notation says Cx as when it says D or Ebb.</p><p>So &quot;sharpness&quot; is just another name for &quot;pitch&quot; - the<br/>single vertical dimension that staff notation sets off<br/>against time in the single horizontal dimension.</p><p>Not having access to the Mazzola, I am unable to<br/>refer to it for a further explanation of his meanings.<br/>Certainly you have not managed to convey to me just<br/>what his &quot;extra dimensions&quot; might be! :-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.12.4/143 - Release Date: 19/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61702 href="#61702">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2005 1:28:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all,</p><p>On Thu, 20 Oct 2005, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;hstraub64@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, 17 Oct 2005, you (Linas Plankis) wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.The next idea is, that since earlier times, there<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were cues about two-dimensional character of tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The well known example of these cues is our musical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notation system.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Which clearly represents, chiefly, pitch against time.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Pitch is the dimension of tuning, whilst time is the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dimension of meter and rhythm.

And this is how we hear Western music, according to some<br/>&gt; academics -- even if G# and Ab are tuned the same way, they fall in<br/>&gt; completely different places in this two-dimensional representation,<br/>&gt; and thus are *heard* as different pitches.

But some facts prompt to think about different<br/>&gt; understanding of tuning, even having the same scale of<br/>&gt; fundamental frequencies.</p><p>So what is _objectively_ the same tuning may have<br/>entirely different _subjective_ uses, depending on one&apos;s<br/>compositional theories and cultural background?

Should there<br/>&gt; &gt;perhaps be a comma after &quot;harmonic tuning&quot;?  And may<br/>&gt; &gt;I try paraphrasing a little?  If so, your law might<br/>&gt; read -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;For harmonic tuning, the value of the second<br/>&gt; dimension<br/>&gt; &gt;equals the deviation of the pitch frequencies (that<br/>&gt; is, of<br/>&gt; &gt;the first dimension values) of a given scale (from an<br/>&gt; &gt;equal tempered scale with the same number of notes)<br/>&gt; &gt;raised to a fixed degree.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So, we might have a 12-EDO scale consisting of:<br/>&gt; &gt;C      0   (cents)  0<br/>&gt; &gt;C#  100              0<br/>&gt; &gt;D     200             0<br/>&gt; &gt;D# 300              0<br/>&gt; &gt;E     400              0<br/>&gt; &gt;F     500              0<br/>&gt; &gt;F#  600              0<br/>&gt; &gt;G     700              0<br/>&gt; &gt;G#  800              0<br/>&gt; &gt;A     900              0<br/>&gt; &gt;A# 1000             0<br/>&gt; &gt;B     1100             0<br/>&gt; &gt;C&apos;    1200            0<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;and a 12-UDO scale consisting of:<br/>&gt; &gt;C      0   (cents)  0    (cents^2)<br/>&gt; &gt;C#  110              100<br/>&gt; &gt;D     200              0<br/>&gt; &gt;D# 320              400<br/>&gt; &gt;E     400              0<br/>&gt; &gt;F     500              0<br/>&gt; &gt;F#  630              900<br/>&gt; &gt;G     700              0<br/>&gt; &gt;G#  840              1600<br/>&gt; &gt;A     900              0<br/>&gt; &gt;A# 1050             2500<br/>&gt; &gt;B     1100             0<br/>&gt; &gt;C&apos;    1200            0<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;if we chose for our fixed power the number 2.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;How could we use the second column of figures<br/>&gt; &gt;- the squared deviations from equal, in cents<br/>&gt; &gt;squared - to differentiate this tuning from<br/>&gt; &gt;another one?   Say, one in which the second<br/>&gt; &gt;dimension used the power 0.5?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Whatever value I give to that power, I&apos;m at a<br/>&gt; &gt;loss to understand how I could use that second<br/>&gt; &gt;column.  Particularly when you say it&apos;s &quot;for<br/>&gt; &gt;harmonic tuning&quot;.  As  iunderstand it, &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning&quot; ought to mean &quot;tuning so that some<br/>&gt; &gt;notes are harmonics ie overtones of other<br/>&gt; &gt;notes&quot;.  But your deviation-power law doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;give harmonics or overtones, which are notes<br/>&gt; &gt;whose frequencies are simple integer multiples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the definition, that i gave here for the formula,<br/>&gt; is too weak in the sense of English (particularly &iuml;&iquest;&half;by<br/>&gt; degree&iuml;&iquest;&half;). It couldn&apos;t lead to any other thing than<br/>&gt; misunderstanding. We compare simply two scales here.<br/>&gt; If we compare pure frequencies we divide each value<br/>&gt; from a scale, that is under analysis, by its<br/>&gt; respective value from the EDO with the same number of<br/>&gt; sounds. If we compare logarithmic values, as values in<br/>&gt; cents, we should subtract instead of dividing. Also<br/>&gt; the scaler</p><p>A suggestion: perhaps you could use the expression<br/>&quot;scale multiplier&quot; here in place of your word &quot;scaler&quot;,<br/>which people would be apt to confuse with a &quot;scalar&quot;,<br/>that is, non-vector or single-dimensional vector.</p><p>&gt; exists, which is an index of degree in the<br/>&gt; case with pure frequencies and is simple multiplier in<br/>&gt; the case with cents. But we can not use the scaler at<br/>&gt; all, when we get results for analysis of a scale only.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s necessary in the context of other parts of theory<br/>&gt; only. So, the formula will be<br/>&gt; X(n) = (P(n) &iuml;&iquest;&half; Pet(n))*a.<br/>&gt; (X(n) is the dimension X, the hardness as I&apos;ve call it<br/>&gt; in the abstract, P(n) is the n-th value of fundamental<br/>&gt; frequency of the searched scale and Pet(n) is the<br/>&gt; value of fundamental frequency of  the EDO with the<br/>&gt; same number of sounds, while a is the scaler)<br/>&gt; We may skip &apos;a&apos;, as i&apos;ve said, and change &apos;Pet(n)&apos; to<br/>&gt; &apos;1200*n/m&apos; (where m is a number of sounds in the<br/>&gt; searched scale), getting:<br/>&gt; X(n) = P(n) &iuml;&iquest;&half; 1200*n/m<br/>&gt; Now, having the formula, which representing should be<br/>&gt; more clear than my English, we can do the same what<br/>&gt; You tried.</p><p>Good idea ...</p><p>&gt; ... But there&apos;s one thing. I think, we should<br/>&gt; distinguish compositional scales and general scales<br/>&gt; here (I do this distinction in my theory). For it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not serious to talk about harmonic tuning of a general<br/>&gt; scale, which actually is a set of scales to choose.</p><p>OK - I guess you&apos;re making a distinction between:<br/>1.  An abstract scale, which is a set of interval ratios,<br/>eg 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16, 15/8, 2/1<br/>and<br/>2.  An actual or particular scale, which is a set of pitches,<br/>given either as note names eg A B C# D E F# G# A, or<br/>more precisely as  fundamental frequencies eg<br/>220 247.5 275 293.33 330 371.25 412.5 440.</p><p>Is this what you mean?</p><p>&gt; Harmonic or not harmonic can only be a scale, that is<br/>&gt; used for composing. So, i&apos;ll take the heptatonics and<br/>&gt; C-dur as a particular case of it, and the C-dur will ...</p><p>Although the terms &quot;dur&quot; and &quot;moll(e)&quot; are mostly used in<br/>European languages, we use &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; almost<br/>exclusively in English.  So, let&apos;s say we&apos;re tallking about<br/>the C major scale here.</p><p>&gt; ... be based on 12-EDO. If You prefer 12-tonics, we may<br/>&gt; calculate a respective example later.<br/>&gt; Now, The first column contains relative frequency<br/>&gt; values in cents:<br/>&gt; C      0   (cents)<br/>&gt; D    200<br/>&gt; E    400<br/>&gt; F    500<br/>&gt; G    700<br/>&gt; A    900<br/>&gt; B   1100<br/>&gt; C   1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And values of frequency of the 7-EDO are these:<br/>&gt; 0(C)     0   (cents)<br/>&gt; 1(D)     171.4<br/>&gt; 2(E)     342.9<br/>&gt; 3(F)     514.3<br/>&gt; 4(G)     685.7<br/>&gt; 5(A)     857.1<br/>&gt; 6(B)    1028.6<br/>&gt; 7(C)    1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference will be:<br/>&gt; C        0   (cents)<br/>&gt; D      28.6<br/>&gt; E      57.1<br/>&gt; F     -14.3<br/>&gt; G      14.3<br/>&gt; A      42.9<br/>&gt; B      71.4<br/>&gt; C        0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this column gives  good background data for<br/>&gt; analysis of the scale. For example, you may draw a<br/>&gt; graph (with number in the x  and result in the y).<br/>&gt; Now, imagine, that we look at shape of the graph.<br/>&gt; Number of peaks, growing or descending of X(n) and<br/>&gt; other aspects of the distribution are significant,<br/>&gt; analyzing the scale. And i&apos;m almost ensured from my<br/>&gt; experiments, that, if we analyze a scale this way,<br/>&gt; similar shapes give always similar sounding and<br/>&gt; similar compositional effects.</p><p>I can believe that two heptatonic scales with _very_<br/>similar shapes in their deviations-from-7from12EDO<br/>curves would have both &quot;similar sounds&quot; and &quot;similar<br/>compositional effects&quot;.  But as the similarity weakens,<br/>I would expect the sounds to change, often quite<br/>dramatically, and certainly in nonlinear ways.  In fact,<br/>I&apos;d expect there to be a fairly small &quot;tolerance&quot; for<br/>deviations in shape, perhaps dependent on the<br/>sensitivity of the listener (as for Harmonic Entropy).<br/>So I do think you&apos;re overstating the case here for<br/>similarity of results.</p><p>&gt; ... Obviously one may<br/>&gt; analyze any other scale this way. I myself yet group<br/>&gt; scales into pattern scales and not pattern, or<br/>&gt; secondary, scales. The pattern scales are those, that<br/>&gt; have similar range of X(n) values to the range of  the<br/>&gt; C-dur (actually i use always the same range, and<br/>&gt; different value of the scaler, but it&apos;s the same). The<br/>&gt; C-dur is chosen, because it&apos;s perhaps the best tested<br/>&gt; scale in the history of mankind, but it&apos;s conditional.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yet. Perhaps the proposed procedure itself isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; new, but i tried to give not only the procedure , but<br/>&gt; a different approach too.<br/>&gt; The other answers to be continued, as i&apos;ve wrote.<br/>&gt; Linas.</p><p>I look forward to your other answers!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.12.4/143 - Release Date: 19/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61715 href="#61715">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2005 12:06:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Exactly!

John<br/>deLaubenfels did something similar with his<br/>adaptune project (he later measured squared<br/>deviation from COFT, his Calculated Optimal<br/>Fixed Tuning, rather than from 12-tET).

Some questions are more important than<br/>others. I also try to answer the questions firstly,<br/>that hint my accidental mistakes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I didn&apos;t find good answers to these questions, and<br/>&gt;&gt; decided to create myself, what helped me to solve<br/>them<br/>&gt;&gt; at least partially. I don&apos;t know, if anybody else<br/>has<br/>&gt;&gt; similar ideas, that&apos;s why I wrote to the tuning<br/>group.<br/>&gt;&gt; Some of my ideas i put to the abstract &iuml;&iquest;&half;the<br/>&gt;&gt; two-dimensional tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt;&gt; (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> )<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Now, the main idea of what i wrote, was, that we<br/>&gt;&gt; (including the earlier myself) make a mistake,<br/>&gt;&gt; thinking, that process of tuning is a division of<br/>&gt;&gt; one-dimensional range of pitch. When it actually<br/>&gt;&gt; should be two-dimensional.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What still strikes me as very strange at this point,<br/>&gt;is that although you say there should be two<br/>dimensions<br/>&gt;to tuning - yet you can&apos;t name or describe the second<br/>&gt;one.  To me this seems to be an idea you haven&apos;t yet<br/>got<br/>&gt;very clear in your own mind.  And why should there<br/>not<br/>&gt;be seven dimensions instead?</p><p>We have two a bit different things here. When I say,<br/>that our inner imagination of pitch is<br/>two-dimensional, it could be a matter for one<br/>discussion, but what concerns the theory, i offer<br/>here, it could be discussed in another discussion.<br/>It&apos;s possible to prove with high probability level,<br/>that the first is true. But what concerns the theory,<br/>it&apos;s connected not only with imaginative things, and<br/>it perhaps raises more questions. Actually the idea,<br/>that pitch is imagined in two dimensional way,<br/>inspired to write the abstract. And the abstract has<br/>ideas how it&apos;s possible, how it can be understood.<br/>But even if the abstract contains something wrong, it<br/>doesn&apos;t mean, that this inspirational idea is wrong.<br/>The two-dimensionality of perceptional pitch is a<br/>wider idea, than the theory itself.<br/>Theoretically it&apos;s based on the understanding, that we<br/>divide pitch and timbre very strictly in calculations,<br/>basing on the Fourier analysis. But who can ensure,<br/>that there&apos;s a Fourier analysis device in our brains.<br/>Yes, the formula is very similar to what we heard, but<br/>nobody can say that it&apos;s exactly the same. But it<br/>would mean, that some aspects, that formally are part<br/>of timbre, are heard as pitch. Now, let&apos;s take the<br/>fundamental frequency as a number one and the<br/>hypothetic rest of pitch, that is over the fundamental<br/>frequency, as a number two. It cues two-dimensions<br/>too.<br/>If you&apos;ve read my abstract more intently, you should<br/>notice, that i simply used this. I divided the rest<br/>from the fundamental frequency.<br/>Now, why the number of dimensions is 2. An adding one<br/>dimension may appear helpful, but if we added more, it<br/>would cause too complicated system , as I think.<br/>But i feel another question in this, for what purpose<br/>the theory can be useful. I think:<br/><a href="http://1.It">1.It</a> could serve as a pattern for those, who would<br/>like experiment with how micro-timber elements of<br/>sound affects pitch perception.<br/><a href="http://2.It">2.It</a> could be used for classifying as we&apos;ve discussed.</p><p>3.A theory could have no rational reason the same way<br/>as any piece of art :-) (but it&apos;s a joke).</p><p>&gt;&gt; 2.The next idea is, that since earlier times, there<br/>&gt;&gt; were cues about two-dimensional character of<br/>tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt; The well known example of these cues is our musical<br/>&gt;&gt; notation system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which clearly represents, chiefly, pitch against<br/>time.<br/>&gt;Pitch is the dimension of tuning, whilst time is the<br/>&gt;dimension of meter and rhythm.  Meter is not a tuning<br/>&gt;phenomenon, nor is rhythm.  So our musical notation<br/>&gt;system represents pitch in one dimension only.<br/>There are different points of view, why the notation<br/>system has additional marks instead of having simply<br/>12 positions for an octave. Ones may stress aspects of<br/>historical traditions or even of economy. Looking<br/>formally the system is two-dimensional, although the<br/>second dimension has 3 positions only. But i don&apos;t<br/>take it as an argument, it&apos;s a cue only.<br/>Short answers<br/>&gt;&gt; ... But there&apos;s one thing. I think, we should<br/>&gt;&gt; distinguish compositional scales and general scales<br/>&gt;&gt; here (I do this distinction in my theory). For it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; not serious to talk about harmonic tuning of a<br/>general<br/>&gt;&gt; scale, which actually is a set of scales to choose.</p><p>&gt;OK - I guess you&apos;re making a distinction between:<br/>&gt;1.  An abstract scale, which is a set of interval<br/>ratios,<br/>&gt;eg 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16, 15/8, 2/1<br/>&gt;and<br/>&gt;2.  An actual or particular scale, which is a set of<br/>pitches,<br/>&gt;given either as note names eg A B C# D E F# G# A, or<br/>&gt;more precisely as  fundamental frequencies eg<br/>&gt;220 247.5 275 293.33 330 371.25 412.5 440.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is this what you mean?<br/>No, I meant a simpler thing. There are scales to tune<br/>an instrument and there are scales, that are necessary<br/>to perform a composition. Scales of the first kind<br/>very often provide possibility to choose between few<br/>scales of the second kind. The most known example is<br/>12-EDO, when we use it not in the duodekatonics: it<br/>can be useful to play C major, D major etc etc. I<br/>simply want to say that just the second kind are<br/>those, what I speak about here. That&apos;s because a scale<br/>of the first kind is a bunch of scales indeed and it<br/>naturally can&apos;t be analyzed the way I wrote (it hasn&apos;t<br/>a single way of sounding!).</p><p>&gt;Although the terms &quot;dur&quot; and &quot;moll(e)&quot; are mostly<br/>used in<br/>&gt;European languages, we use &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; almost<br/>&gt;exclusively in English.  So, let&apos;s say we&apos;re tallking<br/>about<br/>&gt;the C major scale here.</p><p>Thanks for the note. I&apos;ll revise, where it has a<br/>sense.</p><p>A suggestion: perhaps you could use the _expression<br/>&quot;scale multiplier&quot; here in place of your word<br/>&quot;scaler&quot;,<br/>which people would be apt to confuse with a &quot;scalar&quot;,<br/>that is, non-vector or single-dimensional vector.</p><p>I agree.

The first<br/>thing, that I don&apos;t suppose a comparing of two<br/>different sounds here.

So<br/>one  shouldn&apos;t understand the formula of harmonic<br/>tuning like comparison, that raises a question of the<br/>horizontal tuning. The grain of your truth is, that<br/>the word &apos;harmony&apos; perhaps isn&apos;t the best term in this<br/>case. It should be understood in the general sense of<br/>the word, as fitting, sympathy etc., and it simply<br/>means fitting of two dimensions between themselves<br/>here.</p><p>Linas</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

I don&apos;t know, if anybody else<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; has<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; similar ideas, that&apos;s why I wrote to the tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; group.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Some of my ideas i put to the abstract &iuml;&iquest;&half;the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; two-dimensional tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf">http://www.geocities.com/linasrim/2-dtuning.pdf</a> )<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, the main idea of what i wrote, was, that we<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (including the earlier myself) make a mistake,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; thinking, that process of tuning is a division of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; one-dimensional range of pitch. When it actually<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; should be two-dimensional.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What still strikes me as very strange at this point,<br/>&gt; &gt;is that although you say there should be two<br/>&gt; &gt; dimensions<br/>&gt; &gt;to tuning - yet you can&apos;t name or describe the second<br/>&gt; &gt;one.  To me this seems to be an idea you haven&apos;t yet<br/>&gt; &gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt;very clear in your own mind.  And why should there<br/>&gt; &gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt;be seven dimensions instead?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have two a bit different things here. When I say,<br/>&gt; that our inner imagination of pitch is<br/>&gt; two-dimensional, it could be a matter for one<br/>&gt; discussion, but what concerns the theory, i offer<br/>&gt; here, it could be discussed in another discussion.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s possible to prove with high probability level,<br/>&gt; that the first is true.</p><p>I&apos;m not really interested in what it&apos;s &quot;possible to prove&quot;.<br/>Just call me a Doubting Thomas, and SHOW me! :-)</p><p>&gt; But what concerns the theory,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s connected not only with imaginative things, and<br/>&gt; it perhaps raises more questions. Actually the idea,<br/>&gt; that pitch is imagined in two dimensional way,<br/>&gt; inspired to write the abstract. And the abstract has<br/>&gt; ideas how it&apos;s possible, how it can be understood.<br/>&gt; But even if the abstract contains something wrong, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t mean, that this inspirational idea is wrong.<br/>&gt; The two-dimensionality of perceptional pitch is a<br/>&gt; wider idea, than the theory itself.</p><p>Indeed, inspirations may be metaphorical rather than<br/>literal.</p><p>&gt; Theoretically it&apos;s based on the understanding, that we<br/>&gt; divide pitch and timbre very strictly in calculations,<br/>&gt; basing on the Fourier analysis. But who can ensure,<br/>&gt; that there&apos;s a Fourier analysis device in our brains.<br/>&gt; Yes, the formula is very similar to what we heard, but<br/>&gt; nobody can say that it&apos;s exactly the same. But it<br/>&gt; would mean, that some aspects, that formally are part<br/>&gt; of timbre, are heard as pitch. Now, let&apos;s take the<br/>&gt; fundamental frequency as a number one and the<br/>&gt; hypothetic rest of pitch, that is over the fundamental<br/>&gt; frequency, as a number two. It cues two-dimensions<br/>&gt; too.</p><p>So you&apos;re saying you DO intend us to interpret the<br/>second dimension as timbre?  I find this hard to take<br/>literally.  Since a timbre is a whole collection of<br/>overtone frequencies at different amplitudes, it simply<br/>cannot be represented by one dimension.  There is no<br/>natural ordering of timbres; the nearest we can come<br/>to that is to create an arbitrary set of numbers to<br/>index those timbres - along the lines of the General<br/>MIDI patch numbers.  (Tho I can see a dedicated<br/>serialist might use exactly those numbers to create<br/>a &quot;timbre row&quot;, just as he uses scale degrees to create<br/>a tone row.)</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;ve read my abstract more intently,</p><p>Very intently indeed.  I though I understood that -<br/>at least in your extended example in the  abstract -<br/>you identifed the second dimension as the harmonic<br/>distance (measured in steps along the circle of fifths)<br/>between two scale degrees.</p><p>&gt; ... you should<br/>&gt; notice, that i simply used this. I divided the rest<br/>&gt; from the fundamental frequency.<br/>&gt; Now, why the number of dimensions is 2. An adding one<br/>&gt; dimension may appear helpful, but if we added more, it<br/>&gt; would cause too complicated system , as I think.</p><p>Not if that represented the nature of musical<br/>reality better.  Would our description of space-time<br/>be better if we used only, say, time and radial distance?<br/>Although that&apos;s perfectly adequate for some purposes<br/>(eg &quot;as the crow flies&quot;), it is almost useless when we<br/>need to describe the motions of, say, helicopters.<br/>Essential complexity is not a thing to be avoided.  If<br/>an adequate description of phenomena requires 17<br/>dimensions, then that&apos;s exactly how many we should<br/>use.  Otherwise, we will simply get the wrong results,<br/>or no results at all.</p><p>&gt; But i feel another question in this, for what purpose<br/>&gt; the theory can be useful. I think:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://1.It">1.It</a> could serve as a pattern for those, who would<br/>&gt; like experiment with how micro-timber elements of<br/>&gt; sound affects pitch perception.</p><p>Or with dynamics, or articulation, or spatial location<br/>and direction of the instrument, or ... many other things<br/>besides timbre; all affecting the kind of sound you<br/>produce, in broad or in subtle ways.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://2.It">2.It</a> could be used for classifying as we&apos;ve discussed.</p><p>I&apos;m not clear what you mean here.</p><p>&gt; 3.A theory could have no rational reason the same way<br/>&gt; as any piece of art :-) (but it&apos;s a joke).</p><p>Is it?</p><p>I think I&apos;ve made clear what I think: the best purpose<br/>for any theory of a system is to explain the realities<br/>of that system: how it works, how it arises, how it<br/>evolves, where its limits lie.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2.The next idea is, that since earlier times, there<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; were cues about two-dimensional character of<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The well known example of these cues is our musical<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; notation system.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Which clearly represents, chiefly, pitch against<br/>&gt; &gt; time.<br/>&gt; &gt;Pitch is the dimension of tuning, whilst time is the<br/>&gt; &gt;dimension of meter and rhythm.  Meter is not a tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;phenomenon, nor is rhythm.  So our musical notation<br/>&gt; &gt;system represents pitch in one dimension only.</p><p>&gt; There are different points of view, why the notation<br/>&gt; system has additional marks instead of having simply<br/>&gt; 12 positions for an octave. Ones may stress aspects of<br/>&gt; historical traditions or even of economy. Looking<br/>&gt; formally the system is two-dimensional, although the<br/>&gt; second dimension has 3 positions only. But i don&apos;t<br/>&gt; take it as an argument, it&apos;s a cue only.</p><p>One of the other list members implied recently that<br/>we experience inflection - that is, performance<br/>deviations from the basic scale, eg a JI diatonic scale -<br/>in a way that differs from our perceptions of the scale<br/>itself.  I think there may be something to this.  Whereas<br/>a pianist or organist can only inflect the scale degrees<br/>by semitones, a guitarist, fiddler or vocalist can bend or<br/>smear them by microtones, and those bends can follow<br/>any number of different curves.  In certain modal styles<br/>of music, those inflections become part of the musical<br/>vocabulary, the permitted ornaments, and a means of<br/>great expressive power.  To analyse these ornaments<br/>merely in terms of the nearest scale degrees is to miss<br/>a great deal.</p><p>&gt; Short answers<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ... But there&apos;s one thing. I think, we should<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; distinguish compositional scales and general scales<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; here (I do this distinction in my theory). For it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; not serious to talk about harmonic tuning of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; general<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; scale, which actually is a set of scales to choose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;OK - I guess you&apos;re making a distinction between:<br/>&gt; &gt;1.  An abstract scale, which is a set of interval<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios,<br/>&gt; &gt;eg 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 27/16, 15/8, 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt;and<br/>&gt; &gt;2.  An actual or particular scale, which is a set of<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches,<br/>&gt; &gt;given either as note names eg A B C# D E F# G# A, or<br/>&gt; &gt;more precisely as  fundamental frequencies eg<br/>&gt; &gt;220 247.5 275 293.33 330 371.25 412.5 440.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Is this what you mean?<br/>&gt; No, I meant a simpler thing.

When you tune the piano&apos;s 88 notes, you<br/>create a _gamut_ from which you can draw 2^88<br/>different musical _scales_ for purposes of composition,<br/>not all equally useful.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Although the terms &quot;dur&quot; and &quot;moll(e)&quot; are mostly<br/>&gt; &gt; used in<br/>&gt; &gt;European languages, we use &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; almost<br/>&gt; &gt;exclusively in English.

The second is meantone. Given that we<br/>&gt; are talking about common practice music, it seems clear to me that we<br/>&gt; are pretty well forced to assume that 12 and 7 means 12&amp;7, ie<br/>&gt; meantone, because the triad is an essential feature of common<br/>&gt; practice, which initially based itself on meantone, and then modified<br/>&gt; things a bit. But Agmon insists he wants to talk about this stuff<br/>&gt; divorced from any tuning considerations; that is, to understand common<br/>&gt; practice music in terms of a rank two tone group, but not to consider<br/>&gt; heretical, old-fashioned tunings of that tone group to be relevant,<br/>&gt; despite the history and the acoustical facts.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; It certainly makes sense to count the number of generators in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; regular tuning system, which introduces a dimensional factor.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; - one new dimension for each extra generator, including<br/>&gt; &gt; the octave 2/1, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But of course thinking in those terms in this century is considered<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; heretical, and minds can close with an almost audible clanging noise.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not on this list, surely! :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Academic theorists tend to blanch and run if the supremecy of 12edo is<br/>&gt; questioned.</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed a couple of academic email addresses here from<br/>time to time ...

How?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ... After making this conclusion we could<br/>&gt;&gt; even skip the dimension x and use the pitch<br/>frequency<br/>&gt;&gt; only, but already knowing the rule.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK, suppose we skip the second dimension, and use<br/>only<br/>&gt;the fundamental frequency of a note.  (This is what<br/>the<br/>&gt;rest of us still do.)  What does &quot;knowing the rule&quot;<br/>mean?<br/>&gt;That somehow the (squared, say) deviations of the<br/>&gt;tuning from 12-EDO are useful harmonically?  I think<br/>I<br/>&gt;showed above that they are not.</p><p>Perhaps you should draw a graph of deviations for<br/>better visuality, but no one may insist on it. You<br/>would see three moments, that are very obvious:<br/>1.Graph has a number of peaks.<br/>2.Steps of growing are different in size from steps of<br/>descending.<br/>3.And, without any doubt, the graph will have a<br/>certain number of points.<br/>These characteristics are essential for a scale. And<br/>some secondary characteristics, as eg number of points<br/>/ number of peaks, also could be successfully used.<br/>Classifying is easy then. For example, we can take<br/>scales, that have 17 points (are 17-tonics) and 3<br/>peaks, as a group.<br/>Also there&apos;s an interesting feature of scales. Some of<br/>them have growing steps smaller than descending steps,<br/>but others, in contrary, have growing steps bigger<br/>than descending ones (compare diatonic and enharmonic<br/>scales by Boetius / Aristoxenes). This feature is also<br/>useful classifying scales.<br/>How it works? Perhaps You should try: Create two<br/>scales with similar or, better, same, characteristics<br/>of the list above, except one. Perhaps it would be<br/>better argument than all my arguing here.</p><p>The short answers:</p><p>&gt;Indeed.  When you tune the piano&apos;s 88 notes, you<br/>&gt;create a _gamut_ from which you can draw 2^88<br/>&gt;different musical _scales_ for purposes of<br/>composition,<br/>&gt;not all equally useful.<br/>Looking at the common practice period, one can see,<br/>that the scale with 12 keys was used as a scale for<br/>the heptatonics. This understanding is possible,<br/>concerning not only the common practice period. I<br/>simply exclude this taking of a  super-scales for what<br/>we speak about.  And it&apos;s quite clear thing, so i take<br/>this your idea more as a joke.</p><p>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://2.It">2.It</a> could be used for classifying as we&apos;ve<br/>discussed.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not clear what you mean here.<br/>If  the answer above isn&apos;t sufficient, the answer<br/>still stands in the queue.</p><p>&gt;&gt; ... you should<br/>&gt;&gt; notice, that i simply used this. I divided the rest<br/>&gt;&gt; from the fundamental frequency.<br/>&gt;&gt; Now, why the number of dimensions is 2. An adding<br/>one<br/>&gt;&gt; dimension may appear helpful, but if we added more,<br/>it<br/>&gt;&gt; would cause too complicated system , as I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Not if that represented the nature of musical<br/>&gt;reality better.  Would our description of space-time<br/>&gt;be better if we used only, say, time and radial<br/>distance?<br/>&gt;Although that&apos;s perfectly adequate for some purposes<br/>&gt;(eg &quot;as the crow flies&quot;), it is almost useless when<br/>we<br/>&gt;need to describe the motions of, say, helicopters.<br/>&gt;Essential complexity is not a thing to be avoided.<br/>If<br/>&gt;an adequate description of phenomena requires 17<br/>&gt;dimensions, then that&apos;s exactly how many we should<br/>&gt;use.  Otherwise, we will simply get the wrong<br/>results,<br/>&gt;or no results at all.<br/>If we discussed how to synthesize sound in generally,<br/>i should agree with You. The same is about<br/>synthesizing timbres for electronic instruments. But<br/>when we speak about pitch, there are some limits. We<br/>have our notational system at most two-dimensional,<br/>and not 3- or more-dimensional, and it commits us to<br/>be careful, especially when starting.</p><p>&gt;Very intently indeed.  I though I understood that -<br/>&gt;at least in your extended example in the  abstract -<br/>&gt;you identifed the second dimension as the harmonic<br/>&gt;distance (measured in steps along the circle of<br/>fifths)<br/>&gt;between two scale degrees.<br/>The second dimension, as I understand it, isn&apos;t a<br/>purely mathematical thing. If it was a result from the<br/>formula only, what are we discussing about? I simply<br/>would have to say, that &iuml;&iquest;&half;There&apos;s a formula, that helps<br/>much in tuning. Let&apos;s try it&iuml;&iquest;&half;. But how the formula<br/>works, anybody may try explain differently from me<br/>too. E. g. like you say:<br/>&gt;One of the other list members implied recently that<br/>&gt;we experience inflection - that is, performance<br/>&gt;deviations from the basic scale, eg a JI diatonic<br/>scale -<br/>&gt;in a way that differs from our perceptions of the<br/>scale<br/>&gt;itself.  I think there may be something to this.<br/>However i don&apos;t think, that men hear deviations from<br/>an (ET in our case)  scale. I suppose, that the second<br/>dimension should be proportional (taking logarithmic<br/>values eg in cents) to the deviation, when we want to<br/>hear specifically musical sounds.</p><p>Linas</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

So these notes are not actually *heard*, so much<br/>as *imagined*.</p><p>So often we have read theorists in the past decrying the<br/>&quot;barbarism&quot; and &quot;crudity&quot; of 12-EDO tuning - Ravi Shankar<br/>springs to mind.  Perhaps, on the contrary, those of us<br/>(many millions, I might add) who can imagine that they are<br/>hearing the &quot;right&quot; sounds when presented with some poor<br/>approximation, are instead more sophisticated than we<br/>know ... ;-)</p><p>&gt; ... and say it&apos;s naive to think ...</p><p>That&apos;s me, I&apos;m a *very* na&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve thinker!</p><p>&gt; ... that we hear<br/>&gt; each note on the instrument as the same &quot;grammatical&quot; or &quot;syntactic&quot;<br/>&gt; entity in the music even when it&apos;s spelled differently -- just as we<br/>&gt; hear an augmented second as a very different interval from a minor<br/>&gt; third, even though *physically*, absent context and musical meaning,<br/>&gt; they are the same on a piano or organ.</p><p>Of course context makes all the difference!</p><p>I think (perhaps na&iuml;&iquest;&half;vely?) that we actually hear much less than<br/>we think we do; we imagine the rest.  Or that &quot;hearing&quot; is another<br/>of those words, like &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;reading&quot;, that seems, on the<br/>face of it, to concern itself with the act of sensing, whereas in<br/>reality sensing is just the tip of the iceberg; what the brain does<br/>with the sensory stimuli is many times more important AND more<br/>variable than the sensing itself.</p><p>Academic, philosophic &amp; psychological *tomes* have been written<br/>on the nature of perception, apperception and the like; the<br/>take-home message is that hearing, seeing etc are complex<br/>activities that we have to learn to do, and that everyone will learn<br/>to do differently.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.361 / Virus Database: 267.12.4/146 - Release Date: 21/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61863 href="#61863">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2005 1:18:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Linas,</p><p>On Tue, 25 Oct 2005 Linas Plankis wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, Yahya,<br/>&gt; i continue answering to your questions:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ... other interesting possibilities this rule has<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the consequence, that deviation of the pitch<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; frequencies of a given scale relative to an equally<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tempered scale is the main characteristic of a given<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; scale (meaning, that tunings like 12-EDO are more sets<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; of necessary scales than musical scales themselves).<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; And it works.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;??? How?</p><p>You don&apos;t have an answer for this?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; ... After making this conclusion we could<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; even skip the dimension x and use the pitch frequency<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; only, but already knowing the rule.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;OK, suppose we skip the second dimension, and use only<br/>&gt; &gt;the fundamental frequency of a note.  (This is what the<br/>&gt; &gt;rest of us still do.)  What does &quot;knowing the rule&quot; mean?<br/>&gt; &gt;That somehow the (squared, say) deviations of the<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning from 12-EDO are useful harmonically?  I think I<br/>&gt; &gt;showed above that they are not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps you should draw a graph of deviations for<br/>&gt; better visuality, but no one may insist on it. You<br/>&gt; would see three moments, that are very obvious:<br/>&gt; 1.Graph has a number of peaks.<br/>&gt; 2.Steps of growing are different in size from steps of<br/>&gt; descending.<br/>&gt; 3.And, without any doubt, the graph will have a<br/>&gt; certain number of points.</p><p>Easy enough to do; I draw graphs in my head!  Unless<br/>I need to take measurements from them.</p><p>&gt; These characteristics are essential for a scale. And<br/>&gt; some secondary characteristics, as eg number of points<br/>&gt; / number of peaks, also could be successfully used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Classifying is easy then. For example, we can take<br/>&gt; scales, that have 17 points (are 17-tonics) and 3<br/>&gt; peaks, as a group.</p><p>Sure, I get it: you can classify scales by any feature<br/>you like of the graphs of their deviations from some<br/>norm, whether that be 12-EDO, JI diatonic heptatonic,<br/>or whatever seems appropriate.  What&apos;s more, you are<br/>free to choose which features you want to compare<br/>and contrast.  This is a method you are proposing by<br/>which we can compare or classify tunings.  What I<br/>*still* don&apos;t get is why you believe these classifications<br/>have any *musical* significance.</p><p>&gt; Also there&apos;s an interesting feature of scales. Some of<br/>&gt; them have growing steps smaller than descending steps,<br/>&gt; but others, in contrary, have growing steps bigger<br/>&gt; than descending ones (compare diatonic and enharmonic<br/>&gt; scales by Boetius / Aristoxenes). This feature is also<br/>&gt; useful classifying scales.</p><p>Not entirely sure of your meaning here ... perhaps<br/>something was &quot;lost in translation&quot;?</p><p>&gt; How it works? Perhaps You should try: Create two<br/>&gt; scales with similar or, better, same, characteristics<br/>&gt; of the list above, except one. Perhaps it would be<br/>&gt; better argument than all my arguing here.</p><p>While I could do as you suggest, I have no guarantee<br/>that my results will take me in the kind of direction<br/>you intend.  Also, I don&apos;t have unlimited time for such<br/>blind experimenting.  Finally, I am asking you these<br/>questions in hopes of getting answers that other<br/>members of this list may find useful, not just me.</p><p>Perhaps it would be better if *you* were to create<br/>two such scales, then present us with two variants<br/>of a piece of music, using first one scale then the<br/>other.  This would give you the opportunity of showing<br/>us just how your proposed method will change the<br/>music we might make.  And then we could judge for<br/>ourselves whether or not the method was successful.</p><p>Consider this a challenge!  :-)</p><p>&gt; The short answers:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Indeed.  When you tune the piano&apos;s 88 notes, you<br/>&gt; &gt;create a _gamut_ from which you can draw 2^88<br/>&gt; &gt;different musical _scales_ for purposes of composition,<br/>&gt; &gt;not all equally useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looking at the common practice period, one can see,<br/>&gt; that the scale with 12 keys was used as a scale for<br/>&gt; the heptatonics. This understanding is possible,<br/>&gt; concerning not only the common practice period. I<br/>&gt; simply exclude this taking of a  super-scales for what<br/>&gt; we speak about.  And it&apos;s quite clear thing, so i take<br/>&gt; this your idea more as a joke.</p><p>Linas, when I make a joke, I insert the following<br/>smiley:  :-)</p><p>But I was not joking when I wrote the previous<br/>sentence!  Nor was I joking when I wrote about the<br/>2^88 scales on the piano.  If you choose to restrict<br/>your enquiries to octave-equivalent scales, then indeed<br/>you have a gamut of a mere 12 notes, from which you<br/>may draw 2^12 scales.  And if you restrict things even<br/>further, to scale classes, in which one major scale is as<br/>good as any other, then you have only 2^12/12 scale<br/>classes to worry about.  Or you could look at the<br/>&quot;common practice period&quot; and end up with perhaps<br/>just *three* scale classes.</p><p>However, if your intention is to offer methods that<br/>musicians may use to *expand* their musical resources,<br/>why would you ever want to restrict the field of play<br/>so utterly?  Beats me ...</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://2.It">2.It</a> could be used for classifying as we&apos;ve discussed.<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not clear what you mean here.<br/>&gt; If  the answer above isn&apos;t sufficient, the answer<br/>&gt; still stands in the queue.</p><p>Yes, I see what you mean by classifying.   But can you<br/>demonstrate that these classifications are useful?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; ... you should<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; notice, that i simply used this. I divided the rest<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; from the fundamental frequency.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, why the number of dimensions is 2. An adding one<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; dimension may appear helpful, but if we added more, it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; would cause too complicated system , as I think.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Not if that represented the nature of musical<br/>&gt; &gt;reality better.  Would our description of space-time<br/>&gt; &gt;be better if we used only, say, time and radial distance?<br/>&gt; &gt;Although that&apos;s perfectly adequate for some purposes<br/>&gt; &gt;(eg &quot;as the crow flies&quot;), it is almost useless when we<br/>&gt; &gt;need to describe the motions of, say, helicopters.<br/>&gt; &gt;Essential complexity is not a thing to be avoided.  If<br/>&gt; &gt;an adequate description of phenomena requires 17<br/>&gt; &gt;dimensions, then that&apos;s exactly how many we should<br/>&gt; &gt;use.  Otherwise, we will simply get the wrong results,<br/>&gt; &gt;or no results at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we discussed how to synthesize sound in generally,<br/>&gt; i should agree with You. The same is about<br/>&gt; synthesizing timbres for electronic instruments. But<br/>&gt; when we speak about pitch, there are some limits. We<br/>&gt; have our notational system at most two-dimensional,<br/>&gt; and not 3- or more-dimensional, and it commits us to<br/>&gt; be careful, especially when starting.</p><p>Take a deep breath, Linas! :-)</p><p>/*begin rant*/<br/>I&apos;ve been designing software and business systems for<br/>many years now, with some success.  A musical notation<br/>system is a business system for musicians to use, so I<br/>think my experience may have some relevance here.</p><p>What I know beyond a shadow of doubt is this truism,<br/>that&apos;s in all the textbooks on system and software<br/>design, but that everyone seems hell-bent on proving<br/>for themselves the hard way:<br/>  You&apos;ve got to get your analysis right<br/>  *before*<br/>  you start coding.</p><p>The short form of this rule is pretty much: GIGO<br/>(&quot;Garbage In, Garbage Out&quot;).</p><p>And yes, I do know about being careful.  A single<br/>mistake when starting out can cost you very much more<br/>time and trouble later on, or even make the system you<br/>build completely unworkable; useless.</p><p>So I exhort you to get ALL the dimensions you think<br/>exist down on paper - even if there ARE 17 of them!<br/>I know you&apos;ve been having a lot of trouble convincing<br/>me that there really is a second dimension to tuning,<br/>but if you can do that, then you can convince me of all<br/>the others too.</p><p>Leaving any out now will only make things harder later.<br/>Do you know, I think that you overrate the difficulty<br/>of designing a musical notation system to handle<br/>several dimensions - it&apos;s been done already with great<br/>success.  The &quot;common practice period&quot; notation could<br/>readily handle these independent dimensions with<br/>sufficient accuracy for the needs of the period:<br/>- time<br/>- pitch<br/>- dynamics<br/>- articulation</p><p>As modern composers continue to push boundaries, of<br/>course it will be a challenge to design a suitable notation<br/>system to meet their needs.  Some interesting and<br/>valuable experiments have already been made, for<br/>example the Sagittal and HEWM notations (George<br/>Secor, Dave Keenan, and Joe Monzo can tell you more).</p><p>But the most important step in designing a new notation<br/>system remains this: discovering exactly what it must<br/>notate.  Without this analysis, the result will fail to meet<br/>the needs it was supposed to.<br/>/*end rant*/</p><p>&gt; &gt;Very intently indeed.  I though[t] I understood that -<br/>&gt; &gt;at least in your extended example in the  abstract -<br/>&gt; &gt;you identifed the second dimension as the harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt;distance (measured in steps along the circle of fifths)<br/>&gt; &gt;between two scale degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second dimension, as I understand it, isn&apos;t a<br/>&gt; purely mathematical thing.</p><p>Well, I have a little difficulty with this concept.<br/>Without insisting (like Aristotle would have) that a thing<br/>either is mathematical or is not mathematical, I&apos;d like<br/>to say that you *are* presenting this idea of yours using<br/>the language of mathematical concepts - such as<br/>&quot;dimension&quot; and &quot;frequency&quot;.  Therefore it&apos;s rather hard<br/>to think that it&apos;s not mathematical!  Surely you are saying<br/>at least that some aspects of it are mathematical?  If this<br/>is true, what are they?</p><p>Or is it all pure allegory, in which you use the language of<br/>number to confuse and mystify us, like any fairground<br/>numerologist? :-)  No, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re deliberately<br/>confusing us - but you&apos;re still confusing me, for one.</p><p>&gt; If it was a result from the<br/>&gt; formula only, what are we discussing about? I simply<br/>&gt; would have to say, that &iuml;&iquest;&half;There&apos;s a formula, that helps<br/>&gt; much in tuning. Let&apos;s try it&iuml;&iquest;&half;. But how the formula<br/>&gt; works, anybody may try explain differently from me<br/>&gt; too.</p><p>Are you saying we can all interpret this any way we like?<br/>8-0</p><p>&gt; E. g. like you say:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;One of the other list members implied recently that<br/>&gt; &gt;we experience inflection - that is, performance<br/>&gt; &gt;deviations from the basic scale, eg a JI diatonic scale -<br/>&gt; &gt;in a way that differs from our perceptions of the scale<br/>&gt; &gt;itself.  I think there may be something to this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However i don&apos;t think, that men hear deviations from<br/>&gt; an (ET in our case)  scale. I suppose, that the second<br/>&gt; dimension should be proportional (taking logarithmic<br/>&gt; values eg in cents) to the deviation, when we want to<br/>&gt; hear specifically musical sounds.</p><p>Hmmm ... I think the inflections I hear are log deviations<br/>from a JI diatonic 7 note scale, and also their time<br/>envelopes.

Do you not find this?</p><p>There are two factors at play here.  One is the tuning,<br/>which we have stipulated as 12-EDO.  The other is the<br/>scale or melody class - of which a convenient<br/>representation for now will be the simple categories<br/>pentatonic, heptatonic and chromatic.  Does it use 5,<br/>7 or 12 notes from the gamut?</p><p>In this 12-EDO situation, if the music is essentially 7-note<br/>diatonic, and not especially chromatic, I think I hear any<br/>chromatic inflection as a &quot;colouring&quot; of one of those 7<br/>scale notes.  I&apos;m fairly sure I don&apos;t mentally compare the<br/>inflection to an internalised 12-EDO ideal.  As proof, when<br/>playing the violin unaccompanied, I would invariably move<br/>the inflection in the direction of its resolution, usually the<br/>following note.  For example, in playing the following figure<br/>in Aminor:</p><p> | B A G# A | A G# F# G#| A</p><p>the first G# would be sharper than written, while the<br/>second would be &quot;more equal&quot; - more like the written note.<br/>I don&apos;t know if this is unusual, but it certainly sounds<br/>more musical to me than playing strict 12-EDO.  I suspect<br/>(but have no proof) that much of the colour of small<br/>ensemble playing arises from this kind of pushing around<br/>of the intonation.</p><p>Similarly, if the music is essentially pentatonic, I find<br/>any note foreign to that pentatonic scale to be less<br/>critical in inflection than the scale notes.  Tho I can&apos;t<br/>recall playing much pentatonic stuff on the violin (and<br/>haven&apos;t had one for over 10 years), I suspect I would<br/>also push those foreign notes around a bit.</p><p>Hope this answers your question.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.361 / Virus Database: 267.12.4/146 - Release Date: 21/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61931 href="#61931">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2005 2:55:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think that the ratios 19:1, 19:2, and 19:4 may be pretty<br/>&gt; important in describing the way 12-equal-conditioned listeners hear<br/>&gt; the interval between the bass &quot;third&quot; and the treble &quot;root&quot;</p><p>Whoops . . .

Therefore it&apos;s rather<br/>hard<br/>&gt;to think that it&apos;s not mathematical!  Surely you are<br/>saying<br/>&gt;at least that some aspects of it are mathematical?<br/>If this<br/>&gt;is true, what are they?<br/>I use mathematical language, and it&apos;s so, but it<br/>doesn&apos;t mean, that all is math. I meant, that the<br/>second dimension isn&apos;t a purely mathematical<br/>consequence (got for instance from formulas as their<br/>result) of some calculations. If it were so, it was no<br/>need to introduce the second dimension at all. It&apos;s<br/>simply very difficult to imagine, that the thing, that<br/>we got used to imagine one-dimensional appears a bit<br/>wider. The most of us, as I think, simply use pitch as<br/>a line in a plane. Ones do with a more straight line,<br/>others with more curved; that&apos;s why an understanding<br/>of pitch has so many interpretations.<br/>Perhaps the rule of harmonic tuning appears more<br/>mathematical thing than others (the same way like the<br/>Pythagorean rule of multiple frequencies), but if the<br/>analysis of deviations isn&apos;t interesting for us, we<br/>simply could skip all mathematics, taking the formula<br/>of the result.<br/>&gt;Hmmm ... I think the inflections I hear are log<br/>deviations<br/>&gt;from a JI diatonic 7 note scale, and also their time<br/>&gt;envelopes.  I&apos;m pretty sure my hearing isn&apos;t subtle<br/>or quick<br/>&gt;enough to pick up deviations from a 12-EDO chromatic<br/>&gt;scale, at least at normal musical speeds.<br/>You can hear inflections from any scale, whose<br/>intervals aren&apos;t too small, if You are trained. But i<br/>doubt, if this hearing is automatic. That&apos;s what i<br/>mean. Although there is no doubt, that our inner meter<br/>measures these deviations in logarithmic measures.<br/>This fact inspires us to look further. It&apos;s because,<br/>if we can know, what kind of measures uses such<br/>subjective and unmeasurable processes, perhaps we can<br/>know more too?<br/>&gt;But I&apos;m increasingly convinced that Linas is using<br/>&gt;this &quot;second dimension&quot; concept more as an allegory<br/>&gt;than as maths.  For example, in our last exchange,<br/>&gt;he was emphasising how we might use the (log)<br/>&gt;deviations of notes from some standard scale as<br/>&gt;a means of classifying or categorising tunings into<br/>&gt;a whole number of discrete classes.  It seems that<br/>&gt;the class, or pattern made by these deviations, is<br/>&gt;more important to him than any more subtle or<br/>&gt;continuous measure based on them, eg the RMS<br/>&gt;deviation.  BTW, this notion of tuning class is not<br/>&gt;entirely foreign to historical usage - we have well<br/>&gt;temperaments, meantones, _temp&iuml;&iquest;&half;raments ordinaires_<br/>&gt;and so on.<br/>Not allegory, but the interpreting of the second<br/>dimension as of result of the deviations formula is<br/>wrong. If we have a proper  interval of x dimension, a<br/>sound may have, according the theory, any value from<br/>this interval, with no prescriptions. And in the case<br/>only, when we want to put a sound to a certain tuning<br/>scale, we give the values, that are got from the<br/>formula, for the x dimension. This formula is for a<br/>giving order to a tuning, not for a defining the<br/>second dimension.<br/>I can give an easy example. Say, we use C major,<br/>having tuned second dimension values for it. Let also<br/>fundamental frequencies of sounds in our tuning be<br/>from 12-ET for easier comparing. Now, let&apos;s have to<br/>change a tuning from C major to G major. In this case<br/>we should change fundamental frequency once (F --&gt;<br/>F#), but the second dimension is different thing. If<br/>we change a scale, we should retune each value of the<br/>previous scale, putting x dimension value of note C to<br/>note G , etc. etc. till F# gets the value, that<br/>depended to B before it.<br/>Linas</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

But the MIDI<br/>&gt;standard seems fairly extensible, if one were to<br/>write<br/>&gt;a custom synthesis system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Do you have any musical examples (audio or scores)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;d like to upload two mp3 files, but they&apos;ve appeared<br/>too big (2x3.5MB) for disk space of the yahoo group. I<br/>think I may send you these files personally?</p><p>&gt;&gt; But if anybody wants to try possibilities of the<br/>&gt;&gt; adding the x-parameter to real tuning, there is a<br/>&gt;&gt; restriction. Such experiments aren&apos;t possible,<br/>using<br/>&gt;&gt; using software that works exclusively with midi<br/>data,<br/>&gt;&gt; nor with any EMI-s or other devices, that have<br/>&gt;&gt; predefined one-dimensional tuning scale. Such<br/>&gt;&gt; experiments are possible with the synthesizing<br/>&gt;&gt; programs like csound or clm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Suppose I use a MIDI-capable compositional tool,<br/>&gt;such as NoteWorthy Composer.  With this, I create<br/>&gt;MIDI files, which I then use to play my MIDI<br/>&gt;keyboard.  That keyboard incorporates a whole pile of<br/>&gt;sampled instruments in its hardware.  In the MIDI<br/>file,<br/>&gt;I include pitch-bends as well as standard MIDI note<br/>&gt;numbers, so that I can sweep through all frequencies<br/>&gt;from the lowest MIDI note to the highest.  Because<br/>&gt;the keyboard has a high degree of polyphony, I can<br/>&gt;layer many instruments simultaneously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now suppose I use a soft synth like csound, or even<br/>&gt;a hardware synth such as my old Moog.  I will grant<br/>&gt;you that these synths can create some fairly simple<br/>&gt;sounds that I can&apos;t get from the MIDI keyboard.<br/>&gt;But almost any of the more complex sounds they<br/>&gt;make can be approximated on the MIDI keyboard.<br/>&gt;This is as true of their pitch as of their timbre.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure, that one may get everything from MIDI<br/>including both pitch and timbre. But it&apos;s true, that<br/>MIDI is very flexible thing. In the case, You are<br/>right, the only advantage of Csound and similar<br/>programs would be, that it doesn&apos;t predefines way of<br/>thinking. It&apos;s hard job to get anything more musical<br/>using them, but it&apos;s a free making of sound. A<br/>composer can feel himself like a painter, and this<br/>feeling is great, perhaps it&apos;s a sufficient<br/>compensation for few times bigger job, needed for this<br/>kind of software.</p><p>Linas</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Start your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page!<br/><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></p></div><h3><a id=61996 href="#61996">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2005 1:39:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Linas,</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d like to upload two mp3 files, but they&apos;ve appeared<br/>&gt; too big (2x3.5MB) for disk space of the yahoo group.

What means, that<br/>if one makes some inessential changes of the waveshape<br/>we deal with, we sometimes could hear it as change of<br/>pitch, even when looking strictly the change was of<br/>timbre. But the change should be lesser than ones,<br/>which we consider as clearly different thing than<br/>pitch (as tremolo, vibrato, reverberation etc.).<br/>That&apos;s why I used words *micro*timbre, *micro*vibrato.</p><p>But conception of Cowell concerns more proportionating<br/>pitch with rhythm and other parameters of music,<br/>what&apos;s up to a composer. My ideas in &iuml;&iquest;&half;the<br/>2-dimensional tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half; are more about tuning and they<br/>don&apos;t concern how a composer deals with rhythm,<br/>dynamics and such other parametric aspects of music.<br/>Or, speaking more  exactly, they concern all these<br/>things, but no more than a selection between one or<br/>another, say, violin affects an interpreting of a<br/>composition. So, I speak about still a timbre, still a<br/>vibrato, still a reverberation (and anyone could<br/>extend it to &iuml;&iquest;&half;still a rhythm&iuml;&iquest;&half;, if he wants), but only<br/>when a timbre, a vibrato ... have lost their<br/>stand-alone musical significance and have been soaked<br/>to the field of pitch. Actually nobody (or perhaps<br/>almost nobody, statistically nobody) even hears them<br/>as timbre, vibrato, ... although acoustically they<br/>remain to be in this quality even unheard.</p><p>All these problems of limits and boundaries are<br/>interesting both in mathematics and in music. They<br/>often give unexpected and interesting results. And I<br/>think, the things, what I speak about, more concern<br/>namely these ideas of boundaries than what You say<br/>about.

Again, perhaps not the same as you<br/>&gt; are doing, but maybe of interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks, Carl.<br/>I read the material by W. A. Sethares again intently<br/>and with great interest. I&apos;d been read it, if i<br/>remember well, but only passing, for it is, as You say<br/>rightly, not exactly the same as my idea.<br/>What concerns timbre, I should agree with You, but we<br/>should distinguish different cases here. Timbre is a<br/>very wide thing. Well, all of us know, that it has<br/>many frequential characteristics in it, even omitting<br/>other, less regular characteristics. So, my ideas<br/>cover mostly a part of timbre, that perhaps could be<br/>called not timbre at all in a popular sense. For<br/>instance, we have a definition of timbre in  the help<br/>glossary of the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Vienna 32&iuml;&iquest;&half; software</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Timbre differentiates a sound from another sound.<br/>For example, it tells us the difference between the<br/>sound of a violin and that of a tenor saxophone.<br/>Timbre can be seen as the shape of a waveform.  If the<br/>shapes of two waveforms are different, their sounds<br/>will differ. &iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>But we also should speak, additionally to it, yet<br/>about a &iuml;&iquest;&half;grey zone&iuml;&iquest;&half; between these clearly heard timbre<br/>changes and pitch (meaning fundamental frequency)<br/>changes; so that timbre changes in this zone are heard<br/>as spatial features of sound (micro-echo) or as a<br/>complimentary effects to pitch, if they are heard at<br/>all. So, my ideas concern mostly this &iuml;&iquest;&half;grey zone&iuml;&iquest;&half;, and<br/>I&apos;d like to avoid interference of tuning regularity to<br/>the other part of timbre, because it warps traditional<br/>sounding of instruments. But the warping of<br/>traditional sounding already means a new aesthetics. I<br/>think, that any new theory influences aesthetics in a<br/>new way, despite one wants it or not, but I&apos;d like to<br/>reduce these innovations, preferring a description of<br/>existing musical systems to a proclaiming of new<br/>aestetical values.<br/>What concerns Sethares , his compositions sound<br/>unexpectedly, somewhere even excellent, but he changes<br/>traditional sounding and the changes are connected<br/>also with characteristic part of timbre (i e the part<br/>of timbre, that allows us  to differ sound of one kind<br/>from sound of another). This position seems like a<br/>declaring of new musical tradition. But I don&apos;t think,<br/>that a new aesthetics is necessary to use capabilities<br/>of the electronic music. On the other hand, Sethares<br/>uses relations between timbre and pitch, and he is one<br/>of the first, who did it more knowingly. Also his idea<br/>to simulate consonances or dissonances is worth<br/>knowing and deeper analyzing.</p><p>By the way, his and similar ideas affected my choice,<br/>when I decided to speak about two-dimensionality of<br/>pitch, but not about pitch-timbre relations (as<br/>Sethares does). For we should speak about some<br/>expansion of our pitch perception to the timbre zone,<br/>but bot about necessary interrelating between the<br/>timbre in general and pitch. Such an interrelating can<br/>be used in order of experiment, but it isn&apos;t necessary<br/>to call a sounds sequence musical, when we consider<br/>characteristic timbre (not the one of the &iuml;&iquest;&half;grey<br/>zone&iuml;&iquest;&half;).</p><p>It would be interesting to hear from others, what they<br/>think about Sethares&apos; experiments, both about the<br/>aesthetic side of his compositions and about the ideas<br/>in general.</p><p>Linas</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

The sentence was not directly about<br/>Sethares, but that I&apos;d prefer another way and why.  It<br/>all cames from the nature of sounds. We know, that<br/>sound changes while traveling in the air. The most<br/>changes are phasal shifts, but different fences met by<br/>sound waves may result timbral changes too. So we are<br/>acquainted to perceive some kind of timbre as possible<br/>bias of space and not identify them with the source of<br/>sound necessarily. So, while one synthesizes timbral<br/>effects in this area, a listener could think, that<br/>perhaps something is with space but not with a sound<br/>source. When we overpass this area, listeners perceive<br/>it as separate effects, as something form &iuml;&iquest;&half;another<br/>stave&iuml;&iquest;&half;. By the way, some of the effects when timbre is<br/>regulated in tuning, may be compared with the<br/>situation when we have two or more co-tuned<br/>instruments playing them sometimes in unison, but<br/>often playing the higher notes according a<br/>mathematical rule with one of them (which simulates<br/>timbre in this case). But it&apos;s the same thing as if we<br/>invented a mathematical rule for making  chords, and<br/>all depends on what the rule is. Some new rules may<br/>cause some exotic sounding or introduce something like<br/>a new aesthetics, i think. On the other hand, Sethares<br/>also uses the nature of sounds to realize his idea, so<br/>any contradiction, if it were, could be in the sense<br/>of aesthetics only, but not in the sense of acoustics.</p><p>I think in this case, that perceived pitch isn&apos;t<br/>singularly sharpness. We simply hardly distinguish<br/>other properties of this perception in action,<br/>although taking all this formally they can be<br/>described as sharpness or height  and some spatial<br/>elements of sound perception. These spacial elements<br/>could be encoded by microvibrato  too. So, the<br/>question, if the microvibrato affects perception of<br/>pitch, should be answered by a question. What question<br/>is: How we perceive pitch? It&apos;s comparable with how we<br/>perceive coloured things. It&apos;s not easy to imagine any<br/>object without a colour (when we consider that the<br/>white is a colour too). The same way I&apos;ve came to<br/>conclusion, that the spatial elements of perception of<br/>sound are unavoidable in it. And the sine wave is a<br/>case like to the white colour among all colours. The<br/>spatial elements, i speak about,  have  their place in<br/>music without any doubt although they aren&apos;t perceived<br/>clearly and notably like the height &iuml;&iquest;&half; sharpness &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>fundamental frequency is.<br/>How it all should be tuned and if the rules i propose<br/>in &iuml;&iquest;&half;the 2-dimensional tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half; are adequate is a bit<br/>different question.

Then,<br/>&gt; there is white noise...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>Perhaps sometimes I fail with English syntax. If we<br/>use your way of thinking, the sentences have to be<br/>put this way:   The spatial elements of perception of<br/>sound are unavoidable in it. It&apos;s comparable with how<br/>one perceives coloured things.  It&apos;s not easy to<br/>imagine any object without a colour (the white is<br/>considered a colour too).  The same way the perceived<br/>sharpness (or, in other words, the height), which is<br/>the main side  of pitch, is indivisible from these<br/>spatial moments. (Or, in other words, we have the<br/>expansion of our pitch perception to the timbre zone,<br/>i spoke about). The most regular and the finest case,<br/>when a sine wave is taken, plays a role similar to one<br/>of  the white colour in the colour perception.  ___So,<br/>I think, your question doesn&apos;t consider the thing that<br/>i really wanted to say.  But a possible answer to it<br/>well suits with this allegory of colours.  For one may<br/>imagine something couloured (or white) without clear<br/>contours  easier than an explicit thing but absolutely<br/>without a colour.  This &iuml;&iquest;&half;something coloured (or white)<br/>without clear contours&iuml;&iquest;&half; stands for  cases when sounds<br/>don&apos;t have  an explicit pitch.  In these cases spatial<br/>sensation remains the only, and no musicians say, that<br/>these sounds not have any smallest vestige of pitch at<br/>all. Allusions between this &iuml;&iquest;&half;white&iuml;&iquest;&half; and &iuml;&iquest;&half;white&iuml;&iquest;&half; in<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;the white noise&iuml;&iquest;&half; perhaps are accidental, although i<br/>haven&apos;t  thought about this similarity yet.</p><p>What You say  about usage of &iuml;&iquest;&half;pitch&iuml;&iquest;&half; in<br/>psichoacoustics, it&apos;s true without any doubt, and we<br/>wouldn&apos;t have so many uncertainties in what we discuss<br/>about here, if that weren&apos;t true. But, while i think<br/>the sensations of sharpness and of micro-timbre are<br/>indivisible,    the explaining would be superformal<br/>and quite long, if i tried to distinguish all it in<br/>every even fiddly case.   I think, it&apos;s a  shorter way<br/>here in the group, when i&apos;m being  asked about what is<br/>unclear, rather than to write long texts, that<br/>possibly were unclear too re my not good English.</p><p>But You aren&apos;t very precise too :). I think, the fact,<br/>that drum sound is something like a very fast and<br/>quite irregular vibrato, should be added to the<br/>sentence about it. Otherwise it will seem like<br/>description of few partials, that also are &iuml;&iquest;&half;tones that<br/>contain several equally valid pitches&iuml;&iquest;&half; and &iuml;&iquest;&half;different<br/>listeners may choose the loudest, or the lowest of<br/>these as the pitch &iuml;&iquest;&half; (this is possible especially when<br/>few *inharmonic* partials sound simultaneously or<br/>listeners aren&apos;t musicians). __But  this seeming not<br/>preciseness is acceptable for me here, and i perhaps<br/>don&apos;t seem to be very precise too.</p><p>Linas</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

Are you sure they&apos;re different?</p><p> -Carl</p><p> is very natural.<br/>  Yes, the files are different, but they have very comparable values of encoding (a viewing using the hex mode in a file viewer shows it). They might be a case of  equally sounding, but different things, some psychoacoustic  isomorphisms, or how to call it, but actually the differences could be heard.<br/>  But it shows well the problem. The micro-timbral elements, i speak about, are heard very faintly, as some peripheral sensation, and it&apos;s not easy, to concentrate  attention to them. The common level of them is heard better.   Also an absence of  change of some parameters is heard as something, that  annoys with  monotonic sounding.  Perhaps only, the examples, i&apos;ve uploaded, are too short, to hear this common level better.  Naturally, that it&apos;s yet more difficult to hear differences among few pieces, that have sounding similar to equal.<br/>  I also have problem, that i don&apos;t realize, how much others can hear it more attentively, because my hearing is already trained on it  during my experiments.<br/>   But i uploaded (to the tuning_files2) a longer piece for listening, without any comparative experiments. It&apos;s The Fantasy D minor for violin and piano (although performed with one virtual instrument, re using 0 type midi file for making a  Csound score) K.397 by W. A. Mozart, the piece is performed with Csound, using a harp matrix from a sf2 file, with micro-timbral changes added (the variability of  them is heptatonic).
