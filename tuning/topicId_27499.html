Please let me<br/>note Jacky Ligon&apos;s very skilled and patient role in making my<br/>timbre-specific examples available in the last issue of TMA as one<br/>example of such help.]</p><p>Hello, there, Paul, and thanks for your enthusiasm about my 13-tET<br/>article. I&apos;m pleased to say that I now have a set of timbres, and am<br/>about ready to start taping some music.</p><p>It&apos;s a fascinating tuning, and I find that some standard 13th-14th<br/>century progressions, including a couple of favorite chromatic ones<br/>described and advocated by Marchettus of Padua (1318), map directly<br/>and very pleasantly to my keyboard.</p><p>Other progressions, especially when I try them on different steps in<br/>my keyboard arrangement, remind me that 13-tET is not a regular<br/>diatonic tuning -- part of the fun.</p><p>Once the 8-step interval around 738 cents is &quot;smoothed&quot; enough to have<br/>a &quot;3:2-like&quot; quality, 13-tET is a delightful neo-Gothic scale. I&apos;m not<br/>saying that 0-738-1200 rounded cents as a stable trine is identical to<br/>a just 0-702-1200 -- only that it can have the same musical meaning,<br/>more or less, as happens less dramatically in various temperaments.</p><p>One very appropriate term for the tuning/timbre adjustments would be<br/>Chowningization, in honor of John Chowning both as the inventor of the<br/>FM synthesizer and its algorithms, and as the composer of _Stria_<br/>(1981) based on a division of Phi into nine equal parts almost<br/>identical to 13-tET.</p><p>At some point, maybe, we might have an amusing discussion about what I<br/>might term &quot;categorical entropy&quot; -- a tendency maybe to interpret<br/>sonorities not only based on simple ratios, but on familiar interval<br/>categories in a given style (like the often complex thirds and sixths<br/>of Gothic or neo-Gothic music).</p><p>For example, the 10-step or 923-cent interval in 0-461-738-923 (or<br/>0-5-8-10 steps) seems to me have a certain consolidating power: it<br/>signals, in Gothic/neo-Gothic terms, &quot;major sixth sonority seeking<br/>expansion to trine,&quot; with the major sixth resolving to an octave.<br/>To me, it&apos;s a kind of musical synonym for 0-408-702-906 or maybe<br/>0-435-702-933 -- there&apos;s a kind of &quot;pattern recognition.&quot;</p><p>Please note here that I&apos;m using the neo-Gothic category of &quot;major<br/>sixth&quot; to explain my expectation, with 923 cents neatly fitting it,<br/>but would caution that the term &quot;10-step&quot; is generally better. Usual<br/>interval addition based on Pythagorean or meantone, etc., doesn&apos;t<br/>generally apply in 13-tET, so counting steps or cents is usually best.</p><p>Curiously, 461 cents can represent for me a stable &quot;4:3-like&quot; interval<br/>in 0-738-1200 (or also 0-461-1200), but can seem to take on the role<br/>of a large and active cadential interval expanding to an 8-step<br/>consonance -- in usual neo-Gothic terms, a &quot;large major third.&quot;<br/>Sometimes it seems to have something of this latter effect even as a<br/>simple interval or dyad, but in 0-5-10 (0-461-923) or 0-5-8-10 that<br/>10-step interval may favor such an interpretation of the 5-step as<br/>part of the overall pattern.</p><p>Anyway, 13-tET seems to me very special and charming, sometimes almost<br/>like Pythagorean and sometimes charmingly unpredictable in presenting<br/>new patterns and possibilities that I should learn more about as I<br/>become more experienced.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=27525 href="#27525">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2001 12:11:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; At some point, maybe, we might have an amusing discussion about<br/>what I<br/>&gt; might term &quot;categorical entropy&quot; -- a tendency maybe to interpret<br/>&gt; sonorities not only based on simple ratios, but on familiar interval<br/>&gt; categories in a given style (like the often complex thirds and<br/>sixths<br/>&gt; of Gothic or neo-Gothic music).</p><p>I&apos;ve brought up categorical perception many times before, even<br/>recently, since it&apos;s a very important effect. For most people, at<br/>least in Western culture, categorical perception operates within the<br/>12 categories of 12-tET. The boundaries are roughly at<br/>the &quot;quartertones&quot;; except for the unison and octave, which have<br/>narrower boundaries; and the intervals adjacent to them, which have<br/>correspondingly wider ones on that side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, the 10-step or 923-cent interval in 0-461-738-923 (or<br/>&gt; 0-5-8-10 steps) seems to me have a certain consolidating power: it<br/>&gt; signals, in Gothic/neo-Gothic terms, &quot;major sixth sonority seeking<br/>&gt; expansion to trine,&quot; with the major sixth resolving to an octave.<br/>&gt; To me, it&apos;s a kind of musical synonym for 0-408-702-906 or maybe<br/>&gt; 0-435-702-933 -- there&apos;s a kind of &quot;pattern recognition.&quot;</p><p>There may also be various difference tones effecting the &quot;solidity&quot;<br/>of this chord.</p></div>
