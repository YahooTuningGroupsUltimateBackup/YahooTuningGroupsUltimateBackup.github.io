However, to make<br/>&gt;the difference more noticeable to all, I would use timbres that don&apos;t die away so quickly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Examples 2&amp;3: I get an &quot;Unable to establish connection with the server&quot;<br/>&gt;error.</p><p>Hi Paul...</p><p>Thanks for listening.  Yes, as I mentioned, there is a difference with<br/>the dominant sevenths, although it is subtle.  There is definitely less<br/>beating in the 12-22t-ET version.</p><p>Examples #2 and #3 should be working now.  <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> is actually quite<br/>consistent, so it is the EXCEPTION when the files don&apos;t come through.<br/>I&apos;m sure if you try just once again, they will both play...</p><p>I found that example #2, with the &quot;half-diminished&quot; seventh had the most<br/>striking contrast between the 12t-ET and the 12-22t-ET.  However, I am<br/>not certain that the 12-22t-ET has less beating, at least not in this<br/>experiment.  It seemed as though it had more.</p><p>The example #3, with the roots on one color and all the other notes on<br/>another color I found the hardest to differentiate.  There is hardly any<br/>difference at all to my ears.  Maybe you hear it differently...</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/tuninglab">http://www.mp3.com/tuninglab</a></p><p>The problem with the patches is as follows:  I searched around for some<br/>time to find patches with no VIBRATO.  This is more difficult than it<br/>seems, since most of them on the TX81Z have plenty of it!  It really<br/>distorts the experiment.  I think I found about the best patch for it<br/>but, truly, the sustain is too short.</p><p>When I have time, what I think I will do, if I can&apos;t find a better<br/>patch, is play around with my patch editor, and either take out some<br/>vibrato from patches or create a longer sustain.</p><p>Thanks again for listening, and responses would be appreciated from<br/>others, as well.  And, also, don&apos;t forget that experiments can be put up<br/>now on the &quot;Tuning Lab&quot; if anyone is so inclined.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>_____________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
