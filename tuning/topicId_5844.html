It&apos;s urgent! Does anyone know how to obtain an<br/>&#x9;&gt; infinite chord<br/>&#x9;&gt; sustain? The score I&apos;m working on (Gavin Bryars&apos; Bi-Ped) asks for<br/>high<br/>&#x9;&gt; three-note chords coming out of nothing, lasting for about 30<br/>&#x9;&gt; seconds with<br/>&#x9;&gt; some crescendo in the middle and dying out at the end.</p><p>&#x9;Obviously you could get a compressor, and maximize the compression.<br/>Follow<br/>&#x9;it with a volume pedal.  You could use a bow, Jimmy Page style.  Or<br/>make a<br/>&#x9;magnetic feedback system on your guitar...</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.fernandesguitars.com/Misc/Index/index_Sus.html">http://www.fernandesguitars.com/Misc/Index/index_Sus.html</a></p><p>&#x9;As I understand it, you use an extra pickup, a small amplifier, and<br/>an<br/>&#x9;electromagnet (could be a pickup with the magnets removed, or a coil<br/>from a<br/>&#x9;speaker, etc).  The pickup captures the tone of the strings, then<br/>you<br/>&#x9;amplify it, but instead of sending to a speaker, send it to an<br/>electromagnet<br/>&#x9;underneath the strings thereby exciting the string with more of the<br/>original<br/>&#x9;vibration and sustaining it.  If you add volume and tone pots to the<br/>system,<br/>&#x9;you can control how much feedback there is (volume), and the ratio<br/>of<br/>&#x9;fundamental to overtone in the feedback(tone).  The pickup that goes<br/>to your<br/>&#x9;guitar amp can be totally separate from this system.  In the<br/>Fernandes<br/>&#x9;system, I think they use the same pickup.</p><p>&#x9;I bet this would give you the exact effect you are looking for,<br/>without<br/>&#x9;compromising tone, volume, dynamic range, or responsiveness of the<br/>&#x9;instrument.</p><p>&#x9;I just tried it using the tiny coil of a cheap old car stereo<br/>speaker.  It<br/>&#x9;sort of worked for the bass string when I cranked the amp up, but<br/>just when<br/>&#x9;the effect started getting noticeable, the coil started smoking.<br/>:-(  Also,<br/>&#x9;it was very easy to get piercing feedback magnetically through the<br/>pickups -<br/>&#x9;keep the coil away from the pickup!  I probably need some sort of<br/>pole piece<br/>&#x9;inside the coil to focus the magnetic field.  I tried using a hex<br/>nut that<br/>&#x9;fit in there, but it didn&apos;t make much difference.  The steel in the<br/>nut did<br/>&#x9;not seem very magnetic, maybe part aluminum.  Also hex nuts are<br/>torroidal,<br/>&#x9;probably the only shape that wouldn&apos;t work for this application.<br/>Any<br/>&#x9;suggestions would be welcome.  I think I have the right idea, but am<br/>&#x9;grasping at straws for the implementation.  Maybe a pickup with the<br/>magnet<br/>&#x9;removed?  Don&apos;t feel like smoking any pickups today.  I&apos;ll wait for<br/>&#x9;suggestions.</p><p>&#x9;So for the time being, buy a Fernandes.</p><p>&#x9;You will still need to use your volume knob, or a volume pedal to<br/>get the<br/>&#x9;&quot;coming out of nothing&quot; effect.</p><p>&#x9;---<br/>&#x9;Glen Peterson<br/>&#x9;Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>&#x9;30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>&#x9;(978) 975-1527<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p><p>&#x9;<br/>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>___<br/>&#x9;<br/>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>___</p><p>&#x9;Message: 5<br/>&#x9;   Date: Sun, 31 Oct 1999 21:11:21 -0800<br/>&#x9;   From: patrick pagano &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&#x9;Subject: Re: RE: Infinite sustain</p><p>&#x9;if you are talking guitar type stuff i say Ebows on three or four<br/>guitars</p><p>&#x9;<br/>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>___<br/>&#x9;<br/>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>___</p></div><h3><a id=5846 href="#5846">ðŸ”—</a>martin hatch &#x3C;mfh2@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/1999 7:24:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Tuning&quot; people,<br/>Can anyone tell me the location of an article on the tuning (including<br/>partials) of the original Hubei Marquis Yi bells? I specify &quot;original&quot;<br/>because the bells that toured the U.S. (and are recorded on the Fontana CD<br/>called &quot;The Imperial Bells of China&quot;) are facsimiles made in the 20th<br/>century.  In my quick spectral analysis of the tuning of a couple of the<br/>bells from the facsimiles, I think that the partials have been tuned as<br/>1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 (the lowest bell is 172.3, 344.7, 516.5, 689.4,<br/>and 861.2).

The second of these<br/>includes a bibliography of 88 publications on the bells, presumably mostly<br/>in Chinese.</p><p>As these authors seem to be only interested in identifying the so-called<br/>sui and ku pitches (presumably the most subjectively prominent partials),<br/>Kuttner does not give the complete spectral details. This is unfortunate<br/>because it prevents discussion on what constitutes the sui and ku pitches<br/>as well as the kind of overall tuning of partials that you seek.

The bells they use are reproductions<br/>(therefore already suspect).<br/>    But I like this CD anyway... as (modern Chinese) music.</p><p>    A contemporary use of the BianZhong bells in a modern composition is Tan<br/>Dun&apos;s _Symphony 1997 (Heaven Earth Mankind)_  [Sony].

This is not an easy game. But perhaps you<br/>are better at it than I am.</p><p>Sinyan Shen gives more figures in &quot;Chinese Music, Vol 10 (1987), No 1,<br/>10-19&quot;. The problem with these figures is that I have no way of knowing what<br/>is empirically derived and what is theoretically derived. You see, his<br/>reports are just not scientific by American or European standards. Too much<br/>information is missing, and too much just sounds good. The general problem<br/>with these bells is that European and American authors make them worse than<br/>they are (with most ridiculous methods) and Chinese authors make them better<br/>than they are.</p><p>Sinyan Shen&apos;s figures:<br/>- for a minor third bell:<br/>-- partial series across the two tones: 1 : 1.2 : 2.4 : 2.81 : 3<br/>--- A-tone: 1 : 3<br/>--- B-tone: 1.2 : 2.4 : 2.81</p><p>- for a major third bell:<br/>-- partial series across the two tones: 1 : 1.25 : 2.5 : 2.81 : 3<br/>--- A-tone: 1 : 3<br/>--- B-tone: 1.25 : 2.5 : 2.81</p><p>If these figures are real, that is, empirically derived, they are indeed<br/>interesting. They would reflect the following frequency ratios, within tones<br/>and across the 2 tones:<br/>- for a minor third bell: 6:5, 2:1, 7:6, 15:14, 12:5, 7:3, 5:4, 14:5, 5:2,<br/>and 3:1</p><p>- for a major third bell: 5:4, 2:1, 9:8, 15:14, 5:2, 9:4, 6:5, 14:5, 12:5,<br/>and 3:1</p><p>I am sure these ratios will tell you more than they tell me. Of course the<br/>more beautiful (that is, the &quot;exact&quot;) figure for the minor third bells would<br/>be &quot;2.8&quot; instead of &quot;2.81&quot;. Perhaps the author wanted to emphasize the<br/>similarity between the two bell types. But perhaps this &quot;deviation&quot; is small<br/>compared to the deviations between the maths and the real bells.

They further show that this<br/>replica has no multiple pitches. There are no sections of an approximately<br/>harmonic partial series that could evoke the perception of an additional<br/>pitch. This is a bell with two fundamentals plus partly harmonic noise.</p><p>The results also agrees with what I hear on the CD &quot;Imperial Bells of<br/>China&quot;, which is based on such replicas. You can hear that these replicas<br/>can produce good music. But acoustically they differ greatly from the<br/>originals (see below).

Thank you for making it available on the web.</p><p>I would like to make a number of comments and suggestions.</p><p>I find your use of the term &quot;equally tempered&quot; to describe the fifths between the notes CGDAE to be quite problematic in two ways.<br/>1. Some readers will assume you mean &quot;as in our common 12-note equal temperament&quot;.<br/>2. Even if they realise that you only mean &quot;tempered by the same amount&quot;, this is not true. You are using pitches averaged over all octaves of all sets, while failing to take into account the fact that the octaves are stretched on average by 13 cents.</p><p>The overall mean, and extreme deviations, for octaves (actually playable within one set) are:<br/>1213 -36 +63 cents</p><p>These stretched octaves also render invalid your claims about F being a &quot;norm tone&quot; or tuning standard. When you do not assume any intention to tune octaves to a precise 1:2 ratio and compare, between sets, only the same note in the same octave, you find that there is no clear winner for the title of &quot;norm tone&quot;. Of those pitches which occur in all three sets, G4 has the lowest variance.</p><p>Given the names inscribed on the bells, it seems likely to me that any standard tuning note (norm tone), if it exists, would be one we&apos;ve translated as C, G, D, or A since these are the names that do not consist of a suffix added to the name of another note.</p><p>I also looked for evidence of systematic shifts in frequency between the 3 sets, such as is found in gamelan. There is none.</p><p>By the way, you should have translated gong zeng, zhi zeng, shang zeng as Ab, Eb and Bb, not G# D# and A#, so that all the nominal(in chinese) thirds would also be spelled as such in western notation (i.e. as thirds, not diminished fourths).</p><p>When we look at the actual CGDAE fifths between the actual (not averaged) notes, and only between pitches in the same set, we find the following.</p><p>                     Deviations from mean<br/>Fifth Min  Max  Mean Min  Max  Range<br/>------------------------------------<br/>C:G   674  724  700  -26   24   50   Overall mean and extreme deviations<br/>G:D   682  725  705  -23   21   43   701 -50 to +64<br/>D:A   651  765  704  -53   62  114<br/>A:E   671  743  706  -35   37   72</p><p>When we look at the actual fourths we see the following.</p><p>                     Deviations from mean<br/>FourthMin  Max  Mean Min  Max  Range<br/>------------------------------------<br/>G:C   478  577  511  -33   66   99   Overall mean and extreme deviations<br/>D:G   491  514  503  -12   11   23   503 -64 to +74<br/>A:D   471  540  505  -34   36   69<br/>E:A   455  533  504  -49   29   78</p><p>I find no evidence there that fifths are narrowed, or fourths widened, to favour thirds.</p><p>At first I was astounded that, while you are essentially claiming that at least CGDAE are tuned in a meantone temperament, the word &quot;meantone&quot; didn&apos;t appear anywhere in your paper. Whether you thought the term was appropriate or not to describe the bell tuning itself, I thought you should at least have compared it with western meantone tunings. I got quite excited at first, thinking, &quot;The Chinese used meantone tuning 2,000 years before the west did&quot;. But I now realise this is not a valid conclusion from the data at all, and I now see there is indeed no need to mention meantone temperament.</p><p>How one can conclude anything from a nominally 12-note tuning where interval sizes vary +-50 cents, I&apos;m not sure. But if it can be said to approximate any kind of regular tuning, I&apos;d have to say it looks like a incredibly badly tuned 12 note equal division of a stretched octave.</p><p>You say &quot;it is obvious that the tuning focus was on pure thirds, not on pure fifths&quot;. But I&apos;d say it was treating thirds and fifths approximately as equals. However, given that the bells tend to have an approximate third among their partials, tuning these so that an individual bell sounds harmonious when both of its notes sound simultaneously will force them towards either a 4:5 or 5:6 ratio, and so even if the emphasis for the tuning _between_ bells is entirely on the fourths and fifths, you would end up with a tuning that appeared to favour minor and major thirds as much as fourths and fifths.</p><p>Your conclusion of a six note scale is also dubious. Pentatonics have been far more popular historically, the world over, than hexatonics. Given that every bell has two notes, you have to put _something_ in the sixth place, but there is no way to tell whether it was used as an integral member of the scale, or only as an accidental, or to allow the scale to modulate between two pentatonic keys, and if it did, whether those two keys were equally popular.</p><p>An alternative theory is that the primary scale was the pentatonic DEGACD or some other mode (rotation) of this such as GACDEG. F may have been as much an accidental as was B. One can argue that F only appeared as often as the other notes because it was a better choice than F# for what to put on the D bells, since it allowed modulation to the GACDFG pentatonic. Or it could be the other way &apos;round, with GACDFG being primary pentatonic and E being the accidental, as the best choice of what other note to put on the G bell.</p><p>In support of GACDFG being the primary pentatonic we have the fact that the sizes of the minor thirds DF and the tones FG have much lower variances than the tones DE and the minor thirds EG. One problem with this argument is that the tone GA, which occurs in both pentatonics, has even greater variance than DE. So both pentatonics seem equally likely to me at this stage.</p><p>Notice that the pentatonics can be played with pitch strictly increasing from right to left, whereas the hexatonic would require a counter-intuitive reversal of direction between E and F.</p><p>You wrote, &quot;and two [bells] have apparently mistuned [intervals] with 224 and 342 Cent&quot;.</p><p>Your data table does not show any bell with 224 cents between its two notes, but it does show one with 244 cents (the E6-G6 bell in set I). Perhaps the &quot;224&quot; was a typographical error?</p><p>Your data does show a bell with 342 cents between its two notes (the D5-F5 bell in set I) but interestingly, on your data tables page you do not suggest that either of its two notes are mistuned.</p><p>With regard to what is mistuned and what isn&apos;t. The only place that we agree that something is very wrong is in the low octave of set two, where we find only 14 cents separating Bb from B.</p><p>It is not possible to work out from your paper and data tables, which pairs of notes are on a single bell. One can figure out most but not all. Could you please provide this information, or better still, could you please post (or email) the raw data in both Hz and cents (even though they may disagree)? And the 1981 data as well as the 1982?

Therefore it seems appropriate to average across octaves.<br/>Further, octave stretching would not affect the size of the fifths in<br/>question.</p><p>&gt; The overall mean, and extreme deviations, for octaves (actually playable<br/>&gt; within one set) are:<br/>&gt; 1213 -36 +63 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These stretched octaves also render invalid your claims about F being a<br/>&gt; &quot;norm tone&quot; or tuning standard. When you do not assume any intention to<br/>&gt; tune octaves to a precise 1:2 ratio and compare, between sets, only the<br/>&gt; same note in the same octave, you find that there is no clear winner for<br/>&gt; the title of &quot;norm tone&quot;. Of those pitches which occur in all three sets,<br/>&gt; G4 has the lowest variance.</p><p>Well, I did assume the intention to tune 1:2 octaves, because they had large<br/>zithers, which yield very precise octaves.</p><p>&gt; Given the names inscribed on the bells, it seems likely to me that any<br/>&gt; standard tuning note (norm tone), if it exists, would be one we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; translated as C, G, D, or A since these are the names that do not consist<br/>&gt; of a suffix added to the name of another note.</p><p>Other scholars were convinced that C was the main tone of the system,<br/>relying on music theoretical fragments. It is very common, however, that<br/>names and theory differ from practice (just think of the &quot;western&quot; seven<br/>letters for 12 tones). I tried to write down musical practice as visible in<br/>the data.</p><p>&gt; I also looked for evidence of systematic shifts in frequency between the 3<br/>&gt; sets, such as is found in gamelan. There is none.</p><p>Such a shift is found in some Balinese instruments, but not on Java.</p><p>&gt; By the way, you should have translated gong zeng, zhi zeng, shang zeng as<br/>&gt; Ab, Eb and Bb, not G# D# and A#, so that all the nominal(in chinese)<br/>thirds<br/>&gt; would also be spelled as such in western notation (i.e. as thirds, not<br/>&gt; diminished fourths).</p><p>&quot;Diminished fourths&quot; only occur in the theory of the so-called &quot;tonal&quot; style<br/>of European music. In contexts of 12-tone descriptions it is now well<br/>established to use only the # for the five &quot;accidentals&quot;.</p><p>&gt; When we look at the actual CGDAE fifths between the actual (not averaged)<br/>&gt; notes, and only between pitches in the same set, we find the following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                       Deviations from mean<br/>&gt; Fifth Min  Max  Mean Min  Max  Range<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; C:G   674  724  700  -26   24   50   Overall mean and extreme deviations<br/>&gt; G:D   682  725  705  -23   21   43   701 -50 to +64<br/>&gt; D:A   651  765  704  -53   62  114<br/>&gt; A:E   671  743  706  -35   37   72<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we look at the actual fourths we see the following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                       Deviations from mean<br/>&gt; FourthMin  Max  Mean Min  Max  Range<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; G:C   478  577  511  -33   66   99   Overall mean and extreme deviations<br/>&gt; D:G   491  514  503  -12   11   23   503 -64 to +74<br/>&gt; A:D   471  540  505  -34   36   69<br/>&gt; E:A   455  533  504  -49   29   78<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find no evidence there that fifths are narrowed, or fourths widened, to<br/>&gt; favour thirds.</p><p>Well, the fourths according to your method are widened. I rejected your<br/>method, however. I knew it from Andr&iuml;&iquest;&half; Lehr in the Netherlands. The bells do<br/>not represent a system that is based on intervals that cross the octave<br/>borders, like our piano. They are for octave confined music, just like the<br/>gamelan instruments, because one player only has one octave in the reach of<br/>his hands. Here, as in Gamelan, we have within-octave intervals and<br/>across-octave chroma consistency. Circles of fifths and fourths, or parts of<br/>it, do not seem appropriate to describe these instruments and their music.</p><p>&gt; At first I was astounded that, while you are essentially claiming that at<br/>&gt; least CGDAE are tuned in a meantone temperament,</p><p>I never said anything like that. I said the means of these fifths are<br/>equally diminished.</p><p>&gt; the word &quot;meantone&quot; didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; appear anywhere in your paper. Whether you thought the term was<br/>appropriate<br/>&gt; or not to describe the bell tuning itself, I thought you should at least<br/>&gt; have compared it with western meantone tunings. I got quite excited at<br/>&gt; first, thinking, &quot;The Chinese used meantone tuning 2,000 years before the<br/>&gt; west did&quot;. But I now realise this is not a valid conclusion from the data<br/>&gt; at all, and I now see there is indeed no need to mention meantone<br/>temperament.</p><p>The term mean-tone tuning only makes sense in a 12-tone instrument. What the<br/>Chinese had 2000 years before the Europeans was a tuning focus on the thirds<br/>at the cost of the fifths. This reflects the same harmony-ranking principles<br/>as in mean-tone tuning, but not mean-tone tuning itself. [It is now known<br/>that these principles seem to have a physiological basis, as well, as shown<br/>on my website.]</p><p>&gt; How one can conclude anything from a nominally 12-note tuning where<br/>&gt; interval sizes vary +-50 cents, I&apos;m not sure. But if it can be said to<br/>&gt; approximate any kind of regular tuning, I&apos;d have to say it looks like a<br/>&gt; incredibly badly tuned 12 note equal division of a stretched octave.</p><p>They are &quot;incredibly badly tuned&quot;, if you apply this standards of<br/>multi-octave string instruments. If you apply the standards of<br/>metallophones, with their non-harmonic - but potentially very interesting -<br/>sound spectra, and the standards of musical practice of Gamelan instruments,<br/>the bells represent sufficiently balanced tuning compromises between scale<br/>precision and pleasant timbres.</p><p>&gt; You say &quot;it is obvious that the tuning focus was on pure thirds, not on<br/>&gt; pure fifths&quot;. But I&apos;d say it was treating thirds and fifths approximately<br/>&gt; as equals. However, given that the bells tend to have an approximate third<br/>&gt; among their partials, tuning these so that an individual bell sounds<br/>&gt; harmonious when both of its notes sound simultaneously will force them<br/>&gt; towards either a 4:5 or 5:6 ratio, and so even if the emphasis for the<br/>&gt; tuning _between_ bells is entirely on the fourths and fifths, you would<br/>end<br/>&gt; up with a tuning that appeared to favour minor and major thirds as much as<br/>&gt; fourths and fifths.</p><p>In octave confined music you simply have more thirds than fourths and<br/>fifths. The data reflect that the bell casters cared more about the thirds<br/>in the octave frame.</p><p>&gt; Your conclusion of a six note scale is also dubious. Pentatonics have been<br/>&gt; far more popular historically, the world over, than hexatonics. Given that<br/>&gt; every bell has two notes, you have to put _something_ in the sixth place,<br/>&gt; but there is no way to tell whether it was used as an integral member of<br/>&gt; the scale, or only as an accidental, or to allow the scale to modulate<br/>&gt; between two pentatonic keys, and if it did, whether those two keys were<br/>&gt; equally popular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An alternative theory is that the primary scale was the pentatonic DEGACD<br/>&gt; or some other mode (rotation) of this such as GACDEG. F may have been as<br/>&gt; much an accidental as was B. One can argue that F only appeared as often<br/>as<br/>&gt; the other notes because it was a better choice than F# for what to put on<br/>&gt; the D bells, since it allowed modulation to the GACDFG pentatonic. Or it<br/>&gt; could be the other way &apos;round, with GACDFG being primary pentatonic and E<br/>&gt; being the accidental, as the best choice of what other note to put on the<br/>G<br/>&gt; bell.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In support of GACDFG being the primary pentatonic we have the fact that<br/>the<br/>&gt; sizes of the minor thirds DF and the tones FG have much lower variances<br/>&gt; than the tones DE and the minor thirds EG. One problem with this argument<br/>&gt; is that the tone GA, which occurs in both pentatonics, has even greater<br/>&gt; variance than DE. So both pentatonics seem equally likely to me at this<br/>stage.</p><p>I think it should be clear from the context of the paper that we are dealing<br/>with a material 6-tone scale, not with a 6-tone scale in musical practice. I<br/>wrote about this at length in a reply to one of Kraig&apos;s posts. There is a<br/>possibly corresponding case in Gamelan pelog of Java, where the material<br/>scale always has seven tones in the octave, whereas the three modes that are<br/>used in pelog only select five of them, and different ones depending on<br/>mode.</p><p>&gt; Notice that the pentatonics can be played with pitch strictly increasing<br/>&gt; from right to left, whereas the hexatonic would require a<br/>counter-intuitive<br/>&gt; reversal of direction between E and F.</p><p>Good point. But for settings with one player per octave (mostly only 3<br/>bells), such a reversal would not have been much of a problem.</p><p>&gt; You wrote, &quot;and two [bells] have apparently mistuned [intervals] with 224<br/>&gt; and 342 Cent&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your data table does not show any bell with 224 cents between its two<br/>&gt; notes, but it does show one with 244 cents (the E6-G6 bell in set I).<br/>&gt; Perhaps the &quot;224&quot; was a typographical error?</p><p>Yes indeed. Thanks a lot!!! (apparently I doubled the 2 instead of the 4)</p><p>&gt; Your data does show a bell with 342 cents between its two notes (the D5-F5<br/>&gt; bell in set I) but interestingly, on your data tables page you do not<br/>&gt; suggest that either of its two notes are mistuned.</p><p>Good point. In the table only assumed mistuning re ensemble is marked, not<br/>bell-internal one. The bell possibly was accepted and not melted down and<br/>re-cast, because it still fitted into the chroma scale of the ensemble, as<br/>shown in data table A.</p><p>&gt; With regard to what is mistuned and what isn&apos;t. The only place that we<br/>&gt; agree that something is very wrong is in the low octave of set two, where<br/>&gt; we find only 14 cents separating Bb from B.</p><p>This supports the view that the six &quot;accidentals&quot; were second-class<br/>passengers in the ensemble.</p><p>I hope this clarifies some of the issues.

Perhaps they did not _want_<br/>1:2 octaves for the bells. Perhaps they found that the bells sound better<br/>if you  tune the octaves a little wider than the octaves obtained using<br/>string harmonics, as is the case with gamelan. Indonesians have stringed<br/>instruments too but choose to widen the octaves for their metallophones.</p><p>But as I pointed out, there is no need to assume any particular intended<br/>octave size, just don&apos;t octave reduce anything before looking at means and<br/>variances.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Given the names inscribed on the bells, it seems likely to me that any<br/>&gt; &gt; standard tuning note (norm tone), if it exists, would be one we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; translated as C, G, D, or A since these are the names that do not<br/>&gt;consist<br/>&gt; &gt; of a suffix added to the name of another note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Other scholars were convinced that C was the main tone of the system,<br/>&gt;relying on music theoretical fragments.</p><p>Now that you have sent me the scanned tables showing the Chinese characters<br/>for the notes, it is also reasonably obvious to me that C is the main tone.<br/>i.e. it is the most common tonic (or ending note). This doesn&apos;t necessarily<br/>make it the tuning standard. But that would seem most likely, if there<br/>_was_ a tuning standard. But I see no evidence for a tuning standard in the pitch data.</p><p>The Chinese pitch names are not as simple as you have indicated in your<br/>article. There are 3 other characters which apparently indicate the<br/>register or octave in terms of the physical size of the bell. Two of them<br/>mean &quot;small&quot; (the TF character) and &quot;smaller than small&quot; (the penguin<br/>skiing character) which seem to be used for progressively higher octaves (but not in the same pitch class), and the other apparently means<br/>&quot;opposite&quot; (the square root of X-bar character) and is less clear. These<br/>are used in conjunction with the single characters for CGDA. They are not<br/>used with F, or any other note name that already has two characters, with<br/>one exception. This is presumably because 3 characters would be<br/>unacceptable. 3 character note names do not occur anywhere in the scanned<br/>tables.</p><p>The exception is E. Even though the chinese name for E already has two<br/>characters, meaning &quot;major-third from C&quot;, in four cases the octave<br/>modifiers are added to it and the character referring to C is dropped. So<br/>they effectively read &quot;octave above major third&quot; and &quot;two-octvaes above<br/>major third&quot;. But an octave above a major third above what? I figure the<br/>&quot;C&quot; can only be omitted because it is the tonic.</p><p>The other thing is that the character for C literally translates as<br/>&quot;palace&quot;. The palace is the centre of the kingdom, it sets the standards<br/>(makes the laws), all roads lead there.</p><p>On that basis, I suspect the primary pentatonic mode was CDEGAC.</p><p>I&apos;m unsure about some of the other characters, because the printing or<br/>scanning is unclear. It would be good to have actual photos of the<br/>inscriptions. But I can&apos;t find anything among their possible literal<br/>meanings that is even remotely as suggestive of a tonic as is &quot;palace&quot;,<br/>except perhaps &quot;to weave or knit&quot; for G, although the zhi character with<br/>that meaning was not the best match. The one with the &quot;fine, delicate&quot;<br/>meaning looks closer.</p><p>I have found the following possibilities at<br/><a href="http://www.zhongwen.com/">http://www.zhongwen.com/</a></p><p>C gong   palace<br/>G zhi    to weave or knit, lance+sound, watchtower, fine, delicate<br/>D shang  discuss, trade, business, commerce, merchant<br/>A yu     feather, wing</p><p>&gt;  It is very common, however, that<br/>&gt;names and theory differ from practice (just think of the &quot;western&quot; seven<br/>&gt;letters for 12 tones).</p><p>I don&apos;t understand your point here. Clearly the main tone in western<br/>tunings _is_ one that is named with a single character with no modifiers<br/>(sharp or flat), as the Chinese name for F does not.</p><p>&gt;  I tried to write down musical practice as<br/>&gt;visible in<br/>&gt;the data.</p><p>This is a laudable aim. But I hope you understand now that you have made an<br/>unwarranted and unnecessary assumption and so your calculations are not valid.</p><p>&gt; &gt; By the way, you should have translated gong zeng, zhi zeng, shang<br/>&gt;zeng as<br/>&gt; &gt; Ab, Eb and Bb, not G# D# and A#, so that all the nominal(in chinese)<br/>&gt;thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; would also be spelled as such in western notation (i.e. as thirds, not<br/>&gt; &gt; diminished fourths).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Diminished fourths&quot; only occur in the theory of the so-called &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>&gt;style of European music.</p><p>This is not relevant.</p><p>&gt;  In contexts of 12-tone descriptions it is now well<br/>&gt;established to use only the # for the five &quot;accidentals&quot;.</p><p>This is only true of 12-tone _equal_tempered_ situations when there is no<br/>particular tonal centre and no consonant intervals being discussed. And<br/>even then it is also quite common to use EbBbFCGDAEBF#C#G# as the default<br/>rather than FCGDAEBF#C#G#D#A#. That is not the case here. Correct spelling<br/>of intervals is important.</p><p>For you to use G# D# and A# for what, in the Chinese, are clearly &quot;major<br/>third below&quot; (or &quot;minor sixth above&quot;) C G and D, is a travesty. It amounts<br/>to an unwarranted assumption of 12-tone-equal-temperament before you even<br/>start.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I find no evidence there that fifths are narrowed, or fourths<br/>&gt;widened, to<br/>&gt; &gt; favour thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, the fourths according to your method are widened.</p><p>The amount is not significant given the huge variance.</p><p>&gt;  I rejected your<br/>&gt;method, however. I knew it from Andr&eacute; Lehr in the Netherlands. The<br/>&gt;bells do<br/>&gt;not represent a system that is based on intervals that cross the octave<br/>&gt;borders, like our piano. They are for octave confined music, just like the<br/>&gt;gamelan instruments,</p><p>What evidence do you have for this? And if it is so, which octaves are we<br/>confined to, G to G, C to C, D to D? And how do you know.</p><p>&gt;because one player only has one octave in the reach of his hands.</p><p>What does it matter if it is played by one player or three, what has that<br/>got to do with the issue of how to calculate mean interval sizes?</p><p>If I am including intervals that cross these imagined octave boundaries,<br/>then so are you.</p><p>It seems from the photographs that a single player could easily span any<br/>fifth with two hands. But I do not see this as relevant anyway. Both notes<br/>of a fifth may never be played simultaneously and this would not affect my<br/>point about how to calculate their mean size.</p><p>&gt;  Here, as in Gamelan, we have within-octave intervals and<br/>&gt;across-octave chroma consistency. Circles of fifths and fourths, or<br/>&gt;parts of<br/>&gt;it, do not seem appropriate to describe these instruments and their music.</p><p>How do you know this? It certainly isn&apos;t in the data or photographs.</p><p>&gt;The term mean-tone tuning only makes sense in a 12-tone instrument.</p><p>Perhaps that is so for the literal meaning of &quot;mean tone&quot;, but not for the<br/>tempering principle that has come to be known as meantone temperament. This<br/>can be applied to a chain of only four fifths (5 notes) and is simply the<br/>principle of narrowing the fifths from 2:3 to bring the major and minor<br/>thirds closer to 4:5 and 5:6. This is what you are claiming the Zeng bells<br/>are doing for CGDAE.</p><p>&gt;What the<br/>&gt;Chinese had 2000 years before the Europeans was a tuning focus on the<br/>&gt;thirds at the cost of the fifths.</p><p>I disagree. I don&apos;t see any cost to the fifths, if anything the cost falls<br/>on the octaves and fourths. But the tuning errors are so huge it is<br/>ridiculous to draw any such conclusions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How one can conclude anything from a nominally 12-note tuning where<br/>&gt; &gt; interval sizes vary +-50 cents, I&apos;m not sure. But if it can be said to<br/>&gt; &gt; approximate any kind of regular tuning, I&apos;d have to say it looks like a<br/>&gt; &gt; incredibly badly tuned 12 note equal division of a stretched octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They are &quot;incredibly badly tuned&quot;, if you apply this standards of<br/>&gt;multi-octave string instruments. If you apply the standards of<br/>&gt;metallophones, with their non-harmonic - but potentially very<br/>&gt;interesting -<br/>&gt;sound spectra, and the standards of musical practice of Gamelan<br/>&gt;instruments,<br/>&gt;the bells represent sufficiently balanced tuning compromises between scale<br/>&gt;precision and pleasant timbres.</p><p>But aren&apos;t you claiming that when struck in the right place there is very<br/>little inharmonicity in the bell tones?</p><p>Even if the inharmonicity _is_ responsible, surely you&apos;re not seriously<br/>claiming that those +-50 cent errors are _meant_ to be there. I&apos;m afraid<br/>this just doesn&apos;t hold water. How do you explain the enormous variations<br/>between what are presumably bell cast from the same mold, in different sets?</p><p>I suggest that either their casting was very inaccurate and they had no way<br/>of tuning the bells after casting, or 2,400 years has taken its toll (pun<br/>intended).</p><p>Either way, I think the claims you are making cannot be supported by the<br/>data, because of the uncertainty caused by these huge variations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You say &quot;it is obvious that the tuning focus was on pure thirds, not on<br/>&gt; &gt; pure fifths&quot;. But I&apos;d say it was treating thirds and fifths<br/>&gt;approximately<br/>&gt; &gt; as equals. However, given that the bells tend to have an approximate<br/>&gt;third<br/>&gt; &gt; among their partials, tuning these so that an individual bell sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonious when both of its notes sound simultaneously will force them<br/>&gt; &gt; towards either a 4:5 or 5:6 ratio, and so even if the emphasis for the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning _between_ bells is entirely on the fourths and fifths, you would<br/>&gt;end<br/>&gt; &gt; up with a tuning that appeared to favour minor and major thirds as<br/>&gt;much as<br/>&gt; &gt; fourths and fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In octave confined music you simply have more thirds than fourths and<br/>&gt;fifths.

But I&apos;m glad you agree. However there<br/>is still the possibility that the F was not used any more often than say<br/>the B, and just happens to occur in every octave because you have to put<br/>_something_ on the D bell.</p><p>&gt;I wrote about this at length in a reply to one of Kraig&apos;s posts.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I missed that.</p><p>&gt;  There is a<br/>&gt;possibly corresponding case in Gamelan pelog of Java, where the material<br/>&gt;scale always has seven tones in the octave, whereas the three modes<br/>&gt;that are<br/>&gt;used in pelog only select five of them, and different ones depending on<br/>&gt;mode.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Notice that the pentatonics can be played with pitch strictly increasing<br/>&gt; &gt; from right to left, whereas the hexatonic would require a<br/>&gt;counter-intuitive<br/>&gt; &gt; reversal of direction between E and F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Good point.

These include directions for transposing among the scales of the<br/>principality of Zeng and the relation of these scales to those of the<br/>surrounding state of Chu, and, occasionally, to those of other states, with<br/>all or most of these jurisdictions having independent standards for tuning.&quot;</p><p>This is poetry. A musicological analysis of this presumed &quot;information&quot; has<br/>not been published, and I doubt that such &quot;information&quot; exists in the first<br/>place. Lothar von Falkenhausen wrote well over 1000 pages (in his Ph.D.<br/>thesis) about the bells and their various contexts.
