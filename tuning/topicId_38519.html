Nevertheless, I found<br/>the style akin to some Schoenberg, but unless my ear was mistaken there were<br/>several interesting sonorities of the traditional variety within the harmony<br/>- and b12 the last 1/8th through to b13 1st 1/4 there was a distinctly<br/>&apos;tonal&apos; sound to the voice leading.</p><p>was this intended?  I found the vibrato quite &apos;rich&apos; and gave the music a<br/>smeared sensation like you get listening to Berg&apos;s Quartet Op.3, only more<br/>so. Very intense, not dislikeable, but not strictly truly &apos;microtonal<br/>composing with the tones of the motif&apos;, either.</p><p>Mark</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: 8 Jul 2002 09:26:23 -0000<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 2143<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Despite the occasional hostilities and personal<br/>&gt;&gt; attacks, I am still extremely grateful for the thought that some of<br/>&gt; you are giving to  the ideas my essay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, I studied through it carefully twice, and would also like to<br/>&gt; add that the musical *examples* are now on the Perspectives of New<br/>&gt; Music Site!:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://perspectivesofnewmusic.org/soundexx.html">http://perspectivesofnewmusic.org/soundexx.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Don&apos;t worry about the XX at the end of this... whoops, sorry, Paul.<br/>&gt; Paul wants me to limit my &quot;sophomoric&quot; er.. &quot;humor...&quot;  :) )</p></div>
