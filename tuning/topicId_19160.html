Surely there is no need to slander quartertones per Ivor<br/>Darreg, et al.  Haven&apos;t we progressed passed that.  Isn&apos;t it irrefutable that<br/>there are wonderful compositions utilizing quartertones?</p><p>It could get very personal if we start attacking here and there...but the<br/>differences may be very real.  It reminds me that Schoenberg held that his<br/>music was pantonal, despite the reality that the media would insist it is<br/>atonal.</p><p>I still feel, in the center of my being, that microtonal intervals can also<br/>be larger intervals than intervals &quot;smaller than a semitone.&quot;  And yet I know<br/>others teach differently.  Maybe it&apos;s a better idea to simply point to<br/>different web sites that are clearer in their biases.  This list needs to<br/>remain tolerant of differences, IMHO.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2001 6:23:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think there is a lot of bias showing in the making of this FAQ and<br/>it makes<br/>&gt; me uncomfortable.</p><p>Of course it&apos;s biased so far!
