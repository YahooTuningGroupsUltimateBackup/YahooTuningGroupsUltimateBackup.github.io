Unfortunately, Joe, your email came in the digest, so I&apos;d like to suggest the following:</p><p>If anyone posts an email address that they really *shouldn&apos;t* have, could we ask that all of us use common courtesy and not spread that email address around? And can we all remember to think *very* carefully before posting material that we wish we hadn&apos;t, some few minutes later?</p><p>Someone goofed up, and the best we can do as a group is act like responsible people. I&apos;ll pretend I never saw that email address...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
