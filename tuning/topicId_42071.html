To rearrange<br/>the keys on an already-bult keyboard to do this would lengthen the octave.<br/>And one would need another keyboard to supply all the notes needed. And would<br/>need to paint some black ones white. If a keyboard were laid out and<br/>originally built with seven narrow keys, all the keys would be evenly spaced.</p><p>With such a keyboard Db I, IV and V would be played on all black keys.<br/>Lesser-used II would still have a white G key.</p><p>Pauline</p></div><h3><a id=42109 href="#42109">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E; &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2003 12:19:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi kalle,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; do you mean that you literally rearranged the keys on your keyboard<br/>&gt; in such a way? i&apos;ll assume you did . . .</p><p>Yes I did.
