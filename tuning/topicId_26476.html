As a result<br/>there a whole bunch of sister lists to choose from now that are<br/>trying to seperate things out to establish various tones and comfort<br/>levels... so ,if the volume is too much, or there is attack<br/>in the tone on this list, just try another, there are now a lot to<br/>choose from!</p><p>The moderated lists are usually trying to deal with the fact that what<br/>we are all talking about is music and that can be a very sensitive<br/>subject, and it would be nice to have a community that supports your<br/>search.</p><p>newjustintonation - (low volume for people who don&apos;t want to hear a<br/>                     lot about &quot;useful approximations&quot;)<br/>spiritualtuning - (moderated?
