Of course, this may be of special interest to those<br/>looking for slendro subsets in larger tuning systems, regular or<br/>otherwise.</p><p>As you discussed, Keenan, one familiar model of slendro is a kind<br/>of rather subtly irregular variation on 5-ED2 where each<br/>three-step interval -- or 3d5 as George Secor might say -- can<br/>serve as a &quot;~3/2&quot; for free transposibility. Many slendro tunings<br/>in Bali, and maybe especially in Java accounting to one source,<br/>do agree more or less with this kind of model.</p><p>Bill Alves, for example, in an outstanding article on JI gamelan<br/>variations from his perspective as a composer, notes that his<br/>septimal slendro with steps of 1/1-8/7-4/3-14/9-16/9-2/1 had a<br/>tone at 9/8, narrower than any step in one survey of slendro<br/>tunings he had seen (minimum 214 cents). And he noted that in<br/>these tunings, &quot;few steps were as large as a 7/6.&quot;</p><p>   &lt;<a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/pleng.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/pleng.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Alves found that an Indonesian gamelan maker named Suhirdjan took<br/>no special note of &quot;the greater variation in step size in my<br/>tuning&quot; with its 7/6 and 9/8 steps, but did find the tuning<br/>unusual in being _pleng_, i.e. with &quot;beatless octaves.&quot;</p><p>One term for the kind of slendro where variations are subtle<br/>might be &quot;equable pentatonic.&quot; However, a quick survey of<br/>Indonesian slendro tunings listed in the Scala archive shows that<br/>some of these tunings can be more equable than others.</p><p>In one Javanese book on gamelan music translated into English, I<br/>recall a statement indicating that the &quot;each three-step interval<br/>a ~3/2&quot; concept may be open to exceptions, or at least<br/>qualifications.</p><p>To put this discussion in more of a Balinese or Javanese<br/>perspective, we&apos;ll find a simple concept very helpful:<br/>_kempyung_.</p><p>The term _kempyung_ often refers to an interval of three scale<br/>steps or, as we might say, Secor&apos;s 3d5 -- counting inclusively,<br/>we could call it a &quot;pentatonic fourth.&quot; From the Indonesian book<br/>in translation I recall that _kempyung_ was defined as<br/>theoretically 3/2, but in practice often varying somewhat from<br/>this. And the structure of slendro was explained as in theory<br/>something like 5-ED2, but in practice again varying somewhat,<br/>with a helpful sampling of tunings in cents offered to give some<br/>sense of this variation. (At times, _kempyung_ can also refer to<br/>a consonance of 2d5, or, in European terms, a &quot;fourth.&quot;)</p><p>And in the often intricate counterpoint of gamelan, kempyung,<br/>along with the octave, is the principal consonance and point of<br/>repose, a meeting place for the often divergent melodic lines of<br/>the texture.</p><p>Now the comment that may be especially relevant here is that in<br/>practice, not every location necessarily has a good expression of<br/>kempyung -- that is, as we might say, not every three-step<br/>interval in slendro will be perceived as &quot;~3/2.&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s one Scala tuning to illustrate this point:</p><p>! slendro10.scl<br/>!<br/>Low gender from Singaraja (banjar Lod Peken), Bali, 1/1=172 Hz, McPhee, 1966<br/> 5<br/>!<br/> 261.10972<br/> 465.01972<br/> 698.59664<br/> 991.68081<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here on the ~3/2 step we have a &quot;kempyung&quot; at around 762.5 cents,<br/>close to 14/9, and likely perceived as something other than a<br/>&quot;3/2&quot; type. Also, if we take the reported 2/1 step as accurate,<br/>then we have an upper tone at 208.3 cents, or around 44/39. But<br/>additionally there&apos;s the 261-465 cent step, a just 9/8 of the<br/>kind that Bill Alves was concerned might not be so idiomatic!</p><p>Before sharing an emulation of this slendro that I found in the<br/>MET-24 tuning, I should note a traditional view that it is, at<br/>least, bad etiquette deliberately to copy the tuning of a<br/>specific gamelan -- indeed, once a prohibited practice in regard<br/>to court ensembles, for example. So I consider a bit of<br/>divergence a plus: the ideal is that each gamelan should have its<br/>own distinct sound.</p><p>! met24-slendro10-var_C.scl<br/>!<br/>Variation on slendro10.scl<br/> 5<br/>!<br/> 264.84375<br/> 472.26563<br/> 704.29688<br/> 992.57813<br/> 2/1</p><p>Note how this tuning system bends things a bit toward the kind of<br/>septimal JI that Alves and Lou Harrison, Jacques Dudon, and<br/>others have explored. The tuning is also very much like Erv<br/>Wilson&apos;s 1-3-7-9 hexany, except that we have a 39/22 or 16/9 in<br/>place of 7/4 (leaving out the 9/8 step of the hexany).</p><p>Here&apos;s another slendro tuning from the Scala archive which might<br/>be considered even more colorful in its contrasts:</p><p>! slendrob1.scl<br/>!<br/>Gamelan miring of Musadikrama, desa Katur, Bajanegara. 1/1=434 Hz<br/> 5<br/>!<br/> 279.363 cents<br/> 531.624 cents<br/> 777.408 cents<br/> 1039.179 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>The instances of kempyung vary in size over a range of more than<br/>100 cents, from 668.4 to 777.4 cents! And the intervals at 759.8<br/>and 777.4 cents might well illustrate that remark in the<br/>collection of translated Indonesian writings that nor every instance<br/>of kempyung will necessarily have what we might call a ~3/2<br/>quality.</p><p>Also, the step leading up to the octave is only around 161 cents,<br/>something we might more likely expect to find in an equable<br/>heptatonic tuning of the kind common in Thailand and also in<br/>Africa, for example in the famed music of the Chopi people, with<br/>the meta-Mavila and assorted Mavila temperament schemes an<br/>attempt to capture some of the flavor of the original tunings.<br/>The very wide 531.6-cent fourth is often characteristic of pelog.<br/>(Both pelog and equable heptatonic systems have wide fourths,<br/>which may lead to their confusion; as I learned myself on this<br/>list, pelog does not resemble 7-ED2, a point also made in the<br/>text of modenam.par, one of the files that comes with Scala.)</p><p>Of course, this may not be the most typical slendro, but it&apos;s one<br/>that caught my attention.

If I play around with this scale with my &quot;gamelan ears&quot; on, that empat interval definitely has a different &quot;flavor&quot; than the others, but it still sounds like the same kind of animal - a wide 3/2. Of course, if I ignore the context and play the 762.5-cent interval by itself, the trained microtonalist in me says &quot;that&apos;s clearly 14/9&quot;, but that&apos;s how usual gamelan listeners would perceive it.</p><p>There is also a serious problem with this Scala file, and the way you obtained that 762.5 cent figure. The first four pitches look like converted data from that McPhee paper (with too many significant figures, I note), but the last pitch, the period of the scale, is simply given as &quot;2/1&quot;, which obviously isn&apos;t a product of any empirical measurement. Depending on what the octaves of these instruments actually were, that empat interval could have been different by more than a few cents.</p><p>&gt; Before sharing an emulation of this slendro that I found in the<br/>&gt; MET-24 tuning, I should note a traditional view that it is, at<br/>&gt; least, bad etiquette deliberately to copy the tuning of a<br/>&gt; specific gamelan -- indeed, once a prohibited practice in regard<br/>&gt; to court ensembles, for example.

And the intervals at 759.8<br/>&gt; and 777.4 cents might well illustrate that remark in the<br/>&gt; collection of translated Indonesian writings that nor every instance<br/>&gt; of kempyung will necessarily have what we might call a ~3/2<br/>&gt; quality.</p><p>Okay, in this case I readily admit that (accepting the 2/1 octave as close enough) some of the empat intervals sound nothing like 3/2 at all. This is a pretty weird slendro, but I can&apos;t say I dislike it.</p><p>One interesting thing I note about this scale is that the notes 777.408, 2/1, 279.363, and 531.624, in that order, sound just like the jegog scale! The jegog scale is sometimes explained as deriving from pelog (though it&apos;s probably from an independent tradition), so it&apos;s pretty trippy to be able to add one note to it and have an acceptable slendro.</p><p>&gt; Also, the step leading up to the octave is only around 161 cents,<br/>&gt; something we might more likely expect to find in an equable<br/>&gt; heptatonic tuning of the kind common in Thailand and also in<br/>&gt; Africa, for example in the famed music of the Chopi people, with<br/>&gt; the meta-Mavila and assorted Mavila temperament schemes an<br/>&gt; attempt to capture some of the flavor of the original tunings.<br/>&gt; The very wide 531.6-cent fourth is often characteristic of pelog.<br/>&gt; (Both pelog and equable heptatonic systems have wide fourths,<br/>&gt; which may lead to their confusion; as I learned myself on this<br/>&gt; list, pelog does not resemble 7-ED2, a point also made in the<br/>&gt; text of modenam.par, one of the files that comes with Scala.)</p><p>Again, you&apos;re basing a lot of this on the 161 cent figure, which could only be obtained be subtracting 1039.179 cents from 1200 cents, the latter of which is not a measurement at all, but something arbitrarily put into a Scala file.</p><p>If the octave were 1240 cents (which *might* be unreasonably wide even for a gamelan tuning, but not completely out of the question), then the narrow interval you&apos;re talking about would in fact be more like 200 cents, and not so remarkable after all. It all depends on what the octaves of this tuning actually were, and this Scala file gives us no information about that.</p><p>Unusual as your slendro tunings are, I don&apos;t think any of them stand up to my favorite example of &quot;slendro&quot; - the genggong scale!</p><p>The genggong is a unique Balinese Jew&apos;s harp, and like all Jew&apos;s harps the sound is produced by using the vocal cavity to single out harmonic overtones of the vibrating tongue by resonance. Since they&apos;re *harmonic* overtones, we know *exactly* what the slendro pitches have to be!</p><p>! genggong.scl<br/>!<br/>Genggong polos scale, harmonics 5 through 9<br/>  5<br/>!<br/>  6/5<br/>  7/5<br/>  8/5<br/>  9/5<br/>  2/1</p><p>When some innovative Balinese person many centuries ago first carved a tongue out of a piece of palm rib and heard this, he thought to himself &quot;Cool! It plays slendro!&quot;. This just goes to show how flexible the concept of &quot;slendro&quot; is.</p><p>Actually, the way genggong is traditionally played is even more fascinating, because there are two instruments, polos and sangsih, which have different fundamentals. So different overtone numbers are used to play &quot;the same&quot; pitches. I&apos;m not 100% sure what the specific scheme is (different performers might even do it different ways), but I think it&apos;s something like this:</p><p>polos ... sangsih<br/>  5               low ding<br/>  6               dong<br/>  7    ~     8    deng<br/>  8    ~     9    dung<br/>  9    ~    10    dang<br/>            12    high ding</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101844 href="#101844">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2011 6:33:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Thanks for this interesting post, Margo.</p><p>And thank you, Keenan, for a most educational post with lots of<br/>performer&apos;s insights from which I and doubtless others can learn!</p><p>  &gt;&gt; Alves found that an Indonesian gamelan maker named Suhirdjan<br/>  &gt;&gt; took no special note of &quot;the greater variation in step size<br/>  &gt;&gt; in my tuning&quot; with its 7/6 and 9/8 steps, but did find the<br/>  &gt;&gt; tuning unusual in being _pleng_, i.e. with &quot;beatless<br/>  &gt;&gt; octaves.&quot;</p><p>  &gt; Yes, this definitely would be unusual.</p><p>And your warning about how Scala files or other data compiled by<br/>people who take a &quot;2/1&quot; step for granted can give misleading<br/>results on lots of other intervals is really important!</p><p>[on _kempyung_ as a term for a concord of 3d5, or in European<br/>terms a &quot;fifth&quot;]</p><p>&gt;  There must be an interesting linguistic issue here.

One source on<br/>the Web says that basically the Balinese use _empat_ for the<br/>&quot;4ths thing,&quot; while the Javanese use _kempyung_. It makes sense<br/>to me that people who normally speak of empat might use kempyung<br/>with a more special meaning. As you say, a &quot;linguistic issue.&quot;</p><p>  &gt;&gt; And in the often intricate counterpoint of gamelan, kempyung,<br/>  &gt;&gt; along with the octave, is the principal consonance and point of<br/>  &gt;&gt; repose, a meeting place for the often divergent melodic lines of<br/>  &gt;&gt; the texture.</p><p>&gt; Most definitely.</p><p>In this regard there&apos;s a certain parallelism with 12th-14th<br/>century European music -- and all kinds of differences, of course!</p><p>      &gt; Here&apos;s one Scala tuning to illustrate this point:<br/>   &gt;<br/>   &gt; ! slendro10.scl<br/>   &gt; !<br/>   &gt; Low gender from Singaraja (banjar Lod Peken), Bali, 1/1=172 Hz, McPhee, 1966<br/>   &gt; 5<br/>   &gt; !<br/>   &gt; 261.10972<br/>   &gt; 465.01972<br/>   &gt; 698.59664<br/>   &gt; 991.68081<br/>   &gt; 2/1<br/>   &gt;<br/>   &gt;<br/>   &gt; Here on the ~3/2 step we have a &quot;kempyung&quot; at around 762.5 cents,<br/>   &gt; close to 14/9, and likely perceived as something other than a<br/>   &gt; &quot;3/2&quot; type.</p><p>&gt;  Are you sure about this?

This is exactly to the point, and is an area where one<br/>pair of &quot;gamelan ears&quot; can be worth a thousand not-so-informed<br/>guesses. And this leads to an interesting train of thought.</p><p>Maybe slendro does generally have what we might call a<br/>&quot;circulating&quot; nature (e.g. step with an acceptable empat or<br/>kempyung, depending on the Indonesian terminology in use), but<br/>with a lot wider range for a recognizable &quot;4th&quot; (=European &quot;5th&quot;)<br/>than those of us not-so-experienced or when wearing a<br/>&quot;microtonalist&quot; hat might assume!</p><p>And a disclaimer: I haven&apos;t tried the experiment of how I might<br/>hear a near-14/9 (maybe in one of the septimal slendro tunings of<br/>Bill Alves) on an actual gamelan during a performance!

If the<br/>&gt;  octave were 1240 cents (which *might* be unreasonably wide<br/>&gt;  even for a gamelan tuning, but not completely out of the<br/>&gt;  question), then the narrow interval you&apos;re talking about would<br/>&gt;  in fact be more like 200 cents, and not so remarkable after<br/>&gt;  all. It all depends on what the octaves of this tuning<br/>&gt;  actually were, and this Scala file gives us no information<br/>&gt;  about that.</p><p>Yes, that default &quot;2/1&quot; can affect a lot of things. From one<br/>study I read, something getting close to 1240 cents would be<br/>likeliest in an ensemble seeking to be &quot;flashy&quot; or a bit<br/>ostentatious; but 1215-1225 seems common, and in my own<br/>not-so-informed attempts at gamelan-like music I might go up to<br/>around a septimal comma. And I agree that while the sample of<br/>tunings Alves saw had all the steps for slendro rather larger<br/>than 9:8, steps in that area wouldn&apos;t be so surprising.</p><p>An idea for Manuel, with the credit going to you: just as Scala&apos;s<br/>modenam.par now has a disclaimer that pelog is not close to<br/>7-ED2, how about a caution that &quot;2/1&quot; in gamelan tuning files<br/>should not be taken to imply that a traditional Javanese or<br/>Balinese ensemble is actually using pure or beatless octaves!<br/>And that ignoring this point means that the accuracy of other<br/>intervals may vary -- a lot!

So different<br/>&gt;  overtone numbers are used to play &quot;the same&quot; pitches.  I&apos;m not<br/>&gt;  100% sure what the specific scheme is (different performers<br/>&gt;  might even do it different ways), but I think it&apos;s something<br/>&gt;  like this: polos ... sangsih</p><p>&gt;  5 low ding<br/>&gt;  6 dong<br/>&gt;  7 ~ 8 deng<br/>&gt;  8 ~ 9 dung<br/>&gt;  9 ~ 10 dang<br/>&gt;  12 high ding</p><p>Thanks for a post which is really an education for a gamelan novice.</p><p>&gt;  Keenan</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=101846 href="#101846">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2011 11:51:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is very interesting, and suggests inclusive counting of<br/>&gt; intervals (i.e. empat as a &quot;pentatonic fourth&quot;)!

It&apos;s impossible to tune the different notes of a genggong individually, because they&apos;re harmonic overtones. All genggong instruments, therefore, play exactly the same scale (the harmonic series) out of physical necessity. Only the fundamental frequencies are different.</p><p>In fact, (and this comes from what Deirdre Morgan told me when she came to lead a genggong workshop for GSJ), the fundamentals are not even tuned as a normal part of genggong manufacture. When it&apos;s the right season for palm ribs, a genggong maker simply cuts a bunch of them, and about 10% eventually become playable instruments (the rest being discarded as failed attempts). Of those, the fundamental frequencies have some random distribution, and you can simply choose ones that form good polos-sangsih pairs (or unisons, for different kinds of genggong music).</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101847 href="#101847">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2011 11:55:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>BTW, if anyone wants to hear a good example of a traditional genggong duet, here&apos;s a Grooveshark link: <a href="http://grooveshark.com/artist/Genggong+Duet/823738">http://grooveshark.com/artist/Genggong+Duet/823738</a></p><p>Keenan</p></div>
