The other pieces sounded more like &quot;sound<br/>&gt; experiments&quot; to me.</p><p>Some of the pieces are from composition students, studying with, IIRC,<br/>Richard Boulanger at Berklee. I would not expect those to be long, finished<br/>pieces by mature composers :-). But you&apos;re certainly right about the<br/>non-student works; they are indeed sound experiments. Only a few of them are<br/>of significant length, for example, and they don&apos;t sound all that much<br/>different from pure electronic music composed using older studio<br/>processes -- musique concrete and analog synthesis.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m beginning to think that the difficulty in constructing sounds in<br/>&gt; CSOUND lends people more toward certain kinds of experimental effects<br/>&gt; than real pieces of music.  I know a little about this from my early<br/>&gt; work with &quot;Music 4,&quot; its predecessor.  It was hard to get that to do<br/>&gt; anything... but that was back in the &quot;dark ages...&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s so much the difficulty of using CSound -- one can always<br/>find a computer geek to handle that part of it for you. There are a number<br/>of factors at work here:</p><p>1. There are few role models for &quot;art music&quot; electronic composers. As I said<br/>before, &quot;name&quot; composers prefer conventional instruments and live<br/>performance. If I were looking for a composition teacher, I would be<br/>hard-pressed to find one who specialized in computer music.</p><p>2. There are few audiences for electronic &quot;art music.&quot; Even the hard-core<br/>new music ensemble here in Portland, Fear No Music, plays at most one<br/>electronic or partially electronic concert a year. Their Composer In<br/>Residence, Joseph Waters, does compose electronic pieces, but they are also<br/>heavily influenced by rock and very loud :-(.</p><p>3. It is *extremely* difficult to hold an audience&apos;s attention with pure<br/>electronic music. A composer from the early days told me that he had never<br/>heard a piece of computer music that he didn&apos;t give up on after four<br/>minutes! And *he* was a computer composer!</p><p>The biggest problem is the *sterility* of electronic music. Despite the rich<br/>timbres one can obtain, it just doesn&apos;t sound like it was made by living,<br/>breathing, emoting, musical people. There are *some* exceptional computer /<br/>electronic pieces. Wendy Carlos&apos; &quot;Sonic Seasonings&quot;, Charles Dodge&apos;s<br/>&quot;Earth&apos;s Magnetic Field&quot; and Henri Pousseur&apos;s &quot;Trois Visages Liege&quot; are<br/>three of my personal favorites. And there are a *few* current composers who<br/>have taken on the challenge of electronic composition. If you&apos;re interested,<br/>browse <a href="http://www.cdemusic.org">http://www.cdemusic.org</a>.</p><p>&gt; Seems that MIDI is a lot easier to use to me... maybe mixing that<br/>&gt; with a few of the terrific glissando effects and reverb effects that<br/>&gt; could be recorded more as &quot;sample length&quot; from CSOUND.  Just my<br/>&gt; thought at the moment.  Composer Kitty Brazelton, I believe, uses it<br/>&gt; that way...</p><p>I have not heard any of Kitty Brazelton&apos;s music. CSound controlled by MIDI<br/>is a reality, as is MPEG-4 Structured Audio controlled by MIDI. It&apos;s still<br/>not real-time, though, except on a fast PC. It is, unfortunately, still for<br/>the most part a studio medium.</p><p>&gt; CSOUNDERS, would you mind gently contradicting me??</p><p>Well, actually, I&apos;m gently agreeing with you :-).<br/>--<br/>M.

It must be realized that CSound<br/>is a completely blank sonic slate that could, theoretically, be filled with<br/>any sound(s) imaginable. CSound could be made to emulate any natural sound<br/>or construct any other &quot;artifical&quot; sound, if you knew how to do it. I would<br/>say CSound (or any comparable DSP software) has &gt;no&lt; limitations of its own,<br/>only the limitations of the programmer. But some of these &quot;limitations&quot; are,<br/>in a practical sense, enormous.</p><p>Hopefully without sounding too general, I would say that some of the depth<br/>of art comes from detail. The amount of detail in a performance of even the<br/>simplest music on an acoustic instrument is staggering. This includes all<br/>that may be termed inconsistency or variety in all the parameters of sound<br/>production and execution. This gives it a &quot;human&quot; feel which of course can<br/>also be emulated to a certain extent, but only with vast amounts of<br/>information in the programming.</p><p>I often marvel at the richness of harmonic detail and flexibility available<br/>with an overdriven electric guitar. Hendrix was the first to explore this,<br/>and to my mind he and someone like Stockhausen are kindred spirits. To<br/>achieve this kind of richness and detail with CSound over any extended<br/>amount of material would be daunting, to say the least. As someone who has<br/>dabbled with CSound over the years, I always end up feeling that its just<br/>easier to pick up the guitar, electric or acoustic, and begin immediately to<br/>have all that flexibility at one&apos;s fingertips (so to speak).</p><p>Most MIDI music suffers from the same drawbacks. Although alot easier to use<br/>and very handy for experimentation, ultimately it too suffers from lack of<br/>detail, unless you are willing to go into the controllers and play with<br/>&gt;all&lt; the parameters of each and every note. Even then, it will never sound<br/>as rich as acoustic or some analog sound.</p><p>Most of the best, or most interesting (to my ears) computer music has<br/>elements of music concrete, because in this way the depth of detail in live<br/>sound is brought into the computer as raw material and can be manipulated<br/>without losing the richness. As someone who suffers from periodic bouts of<br/>Pythagoreanitis, my forays into computer music were always based on additive<br/>synthesis, with the sinewave as the prima materia out of which a sonic<br/>universe could be constructed ex nihilo. I know deep down this could work,<br/>but in the end I don&apos;t have the patience to build a universe atom by atom.<br/>Varying the spot that one plucks a guitar string gives me more control than<br/>I could get with hundreds of lines of code, and life is just too short.</p><p>I&apos;ve never heard a computer piece that moved me to tears. I&apos;m not saying its<br/>not possible, and I&apos;d love to hear one that could, but I&apos;m still waiting.</p><p>Its like programming a virtual reality environment: of course its amazing<br/>that it can be done at all, but we are already immersed every day in a<br/>&quot;virtual reality&quot; of mind-boggling richness, and nothing that even the most<br/>sophisticated hardware and software can do can hold even the puniest candle<br/>to it. Hearty souls will forge ahead and maybe someday computer music will<br/>rival live sound in depth of detail, but not for a very, very long time. I&apos;m<br/>just glad somone invented guitars a long time ago.</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=17271 href="#17271">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2001 5:58:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;shreeswifty&quot; &lt;ppagano@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17260">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17260</a></p><p>&gt; Well<br/>&gt; i must agree a bunch of the pieces sound like sound experiments..<br/>&gt; but some gems are Kim Cascones &quot;Blue Cube&quot;<br/>&gt; I have a few pieces  that were realised entirely in Csound )no<br/>external mixing and they are on the tuning punks &quot;Upgrade&quot; and<br/>&quot;Presbyterian Surgery Dervishes II&quot; Both are in 7 limit Just<br/>Intonation on a 64hz Base @ 1/1</p><p>cheers<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;Thanks, Swifty.

This despite having much more experience with a guitar.  So<br/>why is this?  Some ideas:</p><p>1) The guitar sounds better.  I&apos;m still not sure why this is.  I use Kyma<br/>both for synthesis and guitar effects.  That means the two end up much the<br/>same.  It&apos;s not immediately apparent why the sawtooth-like waveforms<br/>coming out of the guitar should work so much better than the<br/>filtered-sawtooths being artificially generated.  This will have to be<br/>looked into more.  I could try taking raw samples from the guitar, and see<br/>what they sound like played through the keyboard with guitar effects.</p><p>2) The guitar gives me 19 notes to the octave.  (Plus a bonus fret that<br/>I&apos;m thinking of pulling out.)  Keyboards can work with anything, but they<br/>work best with 12 notes to the octave.  29 note octaves are logical, but<br/>too stretched out to be convenient.</p><p>3) Basic things about the layout of a guitar.  Like having the rhythm on<br/>one hand and pitch on the other.  And having a two-dimensional structure<br/>to allow both melody and two-octave chords.</p><p>4) It&apos;s easy to get different sounds from a guitar, by hitting the strings<br/>differently (I don&apos;t use a pick) or in different places.</p><p>(1) I&apos;m assuming can be fixed with a bit of experimenation.  It should be<br/>a case of getting the right timbres and envelopes, maybe emulating<br/>strumming.  Not that daunting.</p><p>(2) Would need a new keyboard layout to work properly.  There are plenty<br/>of ideas of course, but they all cost money.  Still, 12 notes at any one<br/>time isn&apos;t much of a restriction, and most musicians don&apos;t care.  You also<br/>get more freedom and precision in tuning the notes you have on a<br/>synthesizer compared to a guitar.</p><p>(3) I really am thinking is important.  A ZTar looks like the best<br/>work-around but, again, costs money.</p><p>(4) I should be able to copy with key velocity affecting something like<br/>FM.</p><p>Get those things done and, with something like CSound or Kyma that works<br/>in real time, you&apos;ll have very close to the same richness and detail that<br/>normal guitarists have (Hendrix may be an exception).  It shouldn&apos;t be<br/>that daunting.  Getting equally good results may be, but it&apos;s also<br/>non-trivial with a guitar.</p><p>&gt; Most MIDI music suffers from the same drawbacks. Although alot easier<br/>&gt; to use<br/>&gt; and very handy for experimentation, ultimately it too suffers from lack<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; detail, unless you are willing to go into the controllers and play with<br/>&gt; &gt;all&lt; the parameters of each and every note. Even then, it will never<br/>&gt; sound<br/>&gt; as rich as acoustic or some analog sound.</p><p>I don&apos;t think this &quot;lack of detail&quot; is really so important.  Some of the<br/>best synthesized music, like Kraftwerk, is remarkably undetailed.  The<br/>trick is to get it sounding right.  Key velocity and a filter pedal get<br/>you a long way for richness, if the sound works well with it.</p><p>A lot of the technique for an acoustic instrument is precisely to suppress<br/>its inconsistency, and hence variety, so you get the sound you want.<br/>Synthesizers make that a lot easier, and it can be a good thing.  I&apos;m<br/>still reeling from the Four Brothers&apos; performance on my local &quot;classical&quot;<br/>radio station last night.  They get an amazing guitar sound, but I&apos;m sure<br/>it would work well sampled, if I could only produce it without background<br/>noise once!</p><p>That &quot;or some analog&quot; doesn&apos;t make sense to me.  Maybe because I&apos;ve never<br/>used real analog synths:)  But they use the same interfaces as digital<br/>ones, usually simpler in not having key velocity.  So you get your sound,<br/>and then keep getting the same sound no matter how you hit the key.  Until<br/>it drifts out of tune.  I&apos;ve never heard samples of analog synthesis that<br/>I can&apos;t do as well (not the same) with Kyma.  Transistors aren&apos;t noted for<br/>their warm, human sound.  If they can be wired together to overcome this<br/>problem, you can do the same with digital programming.</p><p>&gt; Most of the best, or most interesting (to my ears) computer music has<br/>&gt; elements of music concrete, because in this way the depth of detail in<br/>&gt; live<br/>&gt; sound is brought into the computer as raw material and can be<br/>&gt; manipulated<br/>&gt; without losing the richness.</p><p>You mean it uses samples?  That can give good results, but synthesizers<br/>based on samples sound lifeless.  At least when they&apos;re restriced by<br/>memory -- I haven&apos;t tried Gigasampler.  So taking whole phrases rather<br/>than individual notes seems to work better.</p><p>&gt; As someone who suffers from periodic bouts<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; Pythagoreanitis, my forays into computer music were always based on<br/>&gt; additive<br/>&gt; synthesis, with the sinewave as the prima materia out of which a sonic<br/>&gt; universe could be constructed ex nihilo. I know deep down this could<br/>&gt; work,<br/>&gt; but in the end I don&apos;t have the patience to build a universe atom by<br/>&gt; atom.<br/>&gt; Varying the spot that one plucks a guitar string gives me more control<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt; I could get with hundreds of lines of code, and life is just too short.</p><p>I&apos;ve never done much with additive, partly because I expected to find what<br/>you found.  FM, on the other hand, is simpler but still gives you a lot of<br/>flexibility, as Darren McDougall said eloquently last week.  Changing the<br/>level of a modulator gives the same kind of effect as picking a string in<br/>different places.  Usually that gets tied in with key velocity (and<br/>hardware synths don&apos;t give you much choice).  In theory, you could get<br/>three dimensions of expression plus volume from four operator FM.  That<br/>would roughly correspond to:</p><p>1) how hard you pick the string<br/>2) where you pick it<br/>3) where you&apos;re stopping the string<br/>4) using finger/nail/pick</p><p>The trick is then to get a MIDI controller that can give you the same<br/>dimensions.  Unfortunately, I don&apos;t know of any.  Obviously, (1) would be<br/>the key velocity.  Then there&apos;s aftertouch, but that&apos;s really an extension<br/>of the same.  You could use a pedal, but you could with a guitar as well.<br/>I suppose (4) could be the second manual.</p><p>I haven&apos;t tried a ZTar, but I think it can handle (1) and (3).  (2) should<br/>be possible, but I don&apos;t think anybody&apos;s done it.  (4) will probably turn<br/>out to be a special case of (1).  Listening to the full envelope might do<br/>the trick.  It should also be possible to get a second timbre envelope.<br/>You&apos;d need 6 MIDI channels to emulate a guitar this way.</p><p>If you&apos;re using a normal keyboard, and you want an extra parameter, you<br/>could play monophonically and put your other hand on a knob.  Or use a<br/>sequencer and record the controller changes later.  You only need 3 of<br/>them.  Working them out as &quot;programming&quot; would be daunting, which is why<br/>real-time feedback is so important.</p><p>I also find that too many parameters in real time gets confusing, so 4 may<br/>be the magic number.  In which case, playing one handed with key velocity,<br/>twidding a knob and a couple of pedals is all you need.  Although it&apos;s not<br/>an easy way to play.</p><p>Say, how about a 2-D pedal, that controls an extra parameter by tilting<br/>left-right?  Now there&apos;s an idea ...</p><p>If you don&apos;t like FM, well, a filter gives you cutoff, resonance and Q.<br/>Analog-style tone generation gives you a choice between square and<br/>sawtooth waveforms.  Sampling means you can crossfade between whatever you<br/>want.  Overdrive can give you clipping and &quot;fatness&quot; (asymemtry between<br/>the positive and negative parts of the signal).  You could also crossfade<br/>between EQs.  And there&apos;s always vibrato, reverb, all that stuff.  I find<br/>overdrive to be the richest of these, because it&apos;s simple to implement but<br/>gives complex results.  It also gives different results depending on the<br/>loudness of the input, so it effectively gets controlled by key velocity.</p><p>I&apos;m sure all the above can be done with CSound, but maybe not in real<br/>time.  It can all be done in real time on a basic Kyma system, but you<br/>won&apos;t get much polyphony.  A lot of it can be done in real time with VAZ+.</p><p>Beyond all that, you can get a lot of depth by choosing the right tunings<br/>and chords.  From a traditional approach like that, and with good CSound<br/>instruments, you might be surprised at how little &quot;programming&quot; you have<br/>to do.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve never heard a computer piece that moved me to tears. I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; saying its<br/>&gt; not possible, and I&apos;d love to hear one that could, but I&apos;m still<br/>&gt; waiting.</p><p>If you were only to consider past achievements, you would obviously stay<br/>with a guitar.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17291 href="#17291">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
