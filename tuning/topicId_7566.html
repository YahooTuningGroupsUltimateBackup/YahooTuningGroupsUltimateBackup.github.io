But like the guy in a sitcom I saw<br/>the other day - half the time I don&apos;t know what time it is, and the the rest<br/>of the time I don&apos;t really care. But what the heck,<br/>A HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL OF YOU!</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>From Carl Lumma :<br/>&gt; Actually, I believe the issue was that a term besides tET is needed to<br/>&gt; refer to tunings that are equal divisions of the octave, but are not being<br/>&gt; used as a temperament -- that is, not being used to approximate JI (or some<br/>&gt; other set of special intervals).<br/>&gt;<br/>Not quite. The issue is that tET does not specifically refer *only* to<br/>tunings that are EDOs (equal divisions of the octave). To say 12tET could<br/>mean 12 equal divisions of *any* larger interval, for example 3/1.</p><p>A few days ago Carl also said :<br/>&gt; EDO?  So 14<br/>&gt; EDO is the 14th equal division of the octave?  Putting the troubles of<br/>&gt; &quot;octave&quot; aside, what is the 14th division?<br/>EDO : Dan originally defined it as : &quot;equidistant divisions of an octave&quot;<br/>Put more simply, 14EDO would be 14 equal divisions of an octave.<br/>The simple &quot;Equal Divisions of the Octave&quot; is also the way Monzo defines it<br/>in his dictionary.</p><p>&gt; EDO is one popular solution.  I suggested &quot;x-cent equal&quot; (as in 100-cent<br/>&gt; equal), or &quot;xth root of n tuning&quot; (as in 12th root of 2).<br/>x-cent equal, or simply CE can be viewed as CET minus the &quot;T&quot;. And would be<br/>specific to tunings that are designed/callibrated in cents. It&apos;s not an<br/>alternative to EDO.</p><p>&gt; Another idea is to simply substitute &quot;tuning&quot; for &quot;temperament&quot; in tET<br/>&gt; (12-tone equal tuning), or omit the last &quot;T&quot; completely (12-tone equal).<br/>There&apos;s no need to change what already works for it&apos;s specific purpose.<br/>Everyone knows what tET means. But &quot;tE&quot; is a good one.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m assuming all our &quot;common&quot; ones like 19-tET and 31-tET are tempered since<br/>&gt;&gt;they are vainly trying to approximate just intonation. Are there others that<br/>&gt;&gt;are clearly NOT to be considered attempting that aim?<br/>My own (very humble) view is that certain EDO&apos;s and the like are unique<br/>cases of temperaments, since they are not purposely designed to serve as<br/>such. They are but simplistic whole number divisions that we search through<br/>to find good approximations to JI. So, an ET, unlike meantone, well<br/>temperament, etc. is not in itself attempting to approximate JI. Manuel&apos;s<br/>Dinarra is a temperament *by design*, 53EDO is not.</p><p>Joseph probably said &quot;vainly&quot; in jest, but there is much to be said for the<br/>benefits of ETs - modulation, relative ease of performance, relative ease in<br/>instrument construction.</p><p>From Bill Alves :<br/>&gt; For this reason I see nothing wrong with<br/>&gt; continuing with the traditional (certainly not &quot;bizarre&quot; as one<br/>&gt; correspondent characterized it) definition of a tempered interval as one<br/>&gt; defined by an irrational ratio.<br/>That would be moi. Leaving aside my not buying this as the definition<br/>specifically for the reason you mention, the common definition, and logical<br/>deduction of what &quot;temperament&quot; appears to be something along the lines of<br/>what the OED says :<br/>&quot;an adjustment of intervals in tuning a piano, etc. so as to fit the scale<br/>for use in all keys.&quot;</p><p>And yes, such an interval would be characterized by an irrational ratio.<br/>But simply saying an irrational ratio is what a tempered interval is, is<br/>misleading. A tempered interval is an irrational ratio, but not all<br/>irrational rations are tempered intervals. You actually say the same thing<br/>in your explanation re. ET and EDO, as does Dan&apos;s post re. that.<br/>Why perpetuate a myth ?</p><p>Bill, that&apos;s very interesting info about your experience with &quot;microtonal&quot;.<br/>Your students are pretty smart cookies. Sometimes I get very nervous about<br/>posting to the list, being such a novice. It&apos;s at times like these when I<br/>can say, &quot;Hey Drew, you&apos;re not a complete idiot !:-)&quot;</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m surprised no one has mentioned Ken Wauchope&apos;s &quot;allotonal,&quot;<br/>That includes me, who completely forgot about it. However, I like Daniel&apos;s<br/>suggestion of labelling it simply the study of &quot;harmonics&quot;. Very scientific.</p><p>I still regard the terminology problem as an open one. EDO has been tossed<br/>about for about a year now, and is very neat. And quite by accident Starret<br/>suggested a few other terms that are actually simple logical extensions of<br/>EDO. It&apos;s pretty simple. We know &quot;E&quot; usually means &quot;equal&quot; and &quot;O&quot; is<br/>&quot;octave&quot;. &quot;D&quot; is for &quot;division&quot;. It&apos;s easy to build on this :</p><p>EDO - equal divisions of the octave<br/>UDO - unequal divisions of the octave</p><p>EDNO - equally divided non octave<br/>UDNO - unequally divided non octave</p><p>EDI  - equally divided interval<br/>UDI - unequally divided interval</p><p>I also threw in &quot;EDS&quot; for &quot;equal divisions in the spectrum&quot;.</p><p>Obviously all this needs much discussion &amp; will probably be agreed upon by<br/>not agreeing. Atleast for now.</p><p>From Johnny :<br/>&gt; As the professor, you produce the new concepts for your students.<br/>But not wrong ones.</p><p>&gt; If you<br/>&gt; persist in thinking of microtonal intervals as -_only_  tiny intervals,<br/>For crying out loud ! Everybody &amp; his younger sister that is not on this<br/>list knows exactly what a microtonal interval is. Which is why it is<br/>commonly described &amp; used the way Alves describes in his post. At the very<br/>least we all know the implications of &quot;micro&quot;.</p><p>&gt; you<br/>&gt; miss a bigger picture, and you deprive your students.  If the students do not<br/>&gt; know how to label a neutral third, it is because you have not taught them.<br/>Seems to me Bill&apos;s students are remarkably intelligent &amp; sensible.</p><p>&gt; The words microtone and microtonal and microtonality are fairly recent terms<br/>&gt; with limited communicability.<br/>I keep repeating what is common knowledge. The origins of this word &amp; the<br/>meaning. It may be recent, but it&apos;s old enough to have permeated the entire<br/>globe. The usual, universal rule of thumb is &quot;if in doubt, look it up&quot;. So,<br/>look it up every chance you get and you&apos;ll see refering to all non-12EDO<br/>music as &quot;microtonal&quot; is silly.</p><p>&gt; Each word is a concept and we certainly do not share these concepts.<br/>To a degree we have to, or I would not understand a word of what you wrote.<br/>Carl&apos;s anarchist babble about standards &amp; dictionaries is also quaint.</p><p>&gt; That is<br/>&gt; why you have lost interest in the discussion on precise nomenclature.  And in<br/>&gt; that, I agree with you.<br/>Whatever. But I got to say, this was never just about &quot;precise<br/>nomenclature&quot;. It&apos;s about conjuring up nomenclature that does not exist to<br/>help us better study &amp; understand harmonics. Anyhow there&apos;s a long way to go<br/>and a lot more folks will eventually join the party.</p><p>From Bill Alves :<br/>&gt; and the whole EDO, UDI, NDO, FBI, CIA, MOUSE has left me in confusion.</p><p>From Pat :<br/>&gt; I agree with Mr Alves<br/>&gt; You folks are barking up a stump<br/>&gt; how about LBJ or IRC??<br/>Perhaps if more of us got in on these discussions, with well thought out,<br/>constructive critiques &amp; contributions, we&apos;d get more done.<br/>In this particular case, about 1% of members of the Tuning List got<br/>involved, which seems to be the norm here. There&apos;s no denying this is a<br/>valid &amp; important subject. Everything is relative, but labelling &amp;<br/>classifying to the degree possible is an important part of any scientific<br/>study, or just keeping a handle on what you&apos;re doing.</p><p>Monzo&apos;s post of 31 Dec, TD469, including the quote from Starret says it much<br/>better than I could.</p><p>Cheers all &amp; keep it funky !<br/>Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!

I thought I<br/>would list some of The New York Times definitions of &quot;microtonal&quot; and it is<br/>the one that I share.  (Please refrain from all knee-jerk NYC bashing, thank<br/>you.)</p><p>John Rockwell 2/8/82: &quot;&apos;Microtonal music&apos; means any kind of music that<br/>ventures beyond the fixed 12 notes of the conventional chromatic scale.&quot;</p><p>Bernard Holland 11/4/86: &quot;Actually our current &quot;microtonalists,&quot; a curiously<br/>fuzzy term, seek much more--not simply a cleansing of today&apos;s muddy though<br/>practical tuning system but a proliferation of new and different scales<br/>beyond the traditional 12-note divisions classified by the ancient Greeks and<br/>still a powerful part of music.&quot;</p><p>Robert Palmer 7/5/87: &quot;Tuning is perhaps the subtlest of musical<br/>fundamentals, and the least understood, and our vocabulary for describing<br/>tuning differences is a limited one.  Most of the time, one has to choose<br/>between technical jargon (&quot;equal temperament,&quot; &quot;just-intonation&quot;) and mere<br/>descriptive adjectives (&quot;this tuning sounds different; it sounds weird&quot;).  It<br/>seems we are going to have to expand our musical vocabularies, for broad,<br/>sweeping changes, rooted in tuning, are profoundly affecting contemporary<br/>classical and New Age music, jazz and rock.&quot;</p><p>Allan Kozinn 3/21/92: &quot;As stylistic banners go, microtonality is broad enough<br/>to fly over many distinct, incompatible systems unified only by the fact that<br/>each divides the octave into more than the 12 tones of the traditional<br/>Western scale.&quot;</p><p>Anthony Tommasini 5/21/97: &quot;The term microtone simply refers to the notes<br/>that exist between the 12 pitches that somewhat arbitrarily divide  the<br/>standard octave.&quot;</p><p>What do y&apos;all think?  It seems that a microtone is by these definitions to<br/>include notes other than 12TET, allowing for 1188 new microtones to come into<br/>play.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times writer Josef Woodard was funny in his 4/21/98 review:<br/>&quot;Microtonalists tend to be regarded as quaint fringe dwellers who don&apos;t and<br/>won&apos;t quite fit into the status quo.  They refuse to accept the norm of<br/>equal-tempered tuning--with 12 notes to the octave--which has long gripped<br/>Western music, insisting that there are more expansive ways of thinking.  In<br/>some senses, it&apos;s true: Microtonalists could be the sane ones in a world of<br/>mad, brainwashed listeners.&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/>(since 1981)</p></div>
