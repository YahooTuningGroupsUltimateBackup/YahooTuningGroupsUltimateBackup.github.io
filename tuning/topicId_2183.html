Any other<br/>solution?</p><p>Actually, David, you have found the &quot;problem of the syntonic comma&quot; which<br/>explains why 5-limit just intonation never gained much importance in Western<br/>music. The syntonic comma is 81/80, about 21.5 cents, the difference (ratio)<br/>between 9/8 and 10/9. Historically, the solution to your dilemma, from about<br/>1500-1700 (and to some extent, through 1850), was meantone temperament.<br/>Meantone takes each perfect fifth in the chain of fifths and flattens it by<br/>a small fraction (typically a quarter) of a syntonic comma. The result is<br/>that the thirds are nearly pure; a major third, constructed from four<br/>perfect fifths, will typically be a full comma flat relative to a<br/>Pythagorean major third 81/64, thus having ratio 80/64 = 5/4. The fifths and<br/>minor thirds are only 5 or 6 cents flat, which is not too different from<br/>just intonation unless the music goes _very_ slowly. In meantone diatonic<br/>music, every notated pitch has only one actual frequency, but all thirds and<br/>sixths are consonant as well as fouths and fifths. Every diatonic key has<br/>three consonant major triads and three consonant minor triads, which is not<br/>possible in just intonation (unless you allow two alternative tunings for<br/>the second degree). The whole tones (major seconds), which are not consonant<br/>in common practice music and so do not themselves need to approximate simple<br/>ratios, are a compromise between 9/8 and 10/9 in meantone temperament (thus<br/>the name &quot;mean-tone&quot;). Modern 12-tone equal temperament is a variant of<br/>meantone temperament (each fifth is flattened by about one eleventh of a<br/>syntonic comma) which allows for unlimited modulation, but the thirds are<br/>closer to their dissonant Pythagorean proportions than to the consonant ones<br/>of older meantone temperaments. 19- and particularly 31-tone equal<br/>temperament are well within the range of typical meantone temperaments, and<br/>also allow unlimited modulation, but 12-tone won out in the 1700s for<br/>reasons of convenience.</p></div>
