One of my favorites of Blackwood&apos;s etudes is the one in 20-note equal tuning (i.e., 20-ET or 20-EDO). But there are many other nice tracks on both these CD&apos;s.</p><p>Ben Johnston&apos;s &quot;Suite for Microtonal Piano&quot; is another good one, particularly the first movement, &quot;Alarum&quot;, which features a harmonic series in C and some nice effective JI harmony. Something from Lou Harrison&apos;s &quot;Cinna&quot; would also be nice (say, the middle third movement; it&apos;s fairly short). Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;Study on Archytas&apos; Enharmonic&quot; has been recorded a number of times, and it&apos;s a nice example of a memorable tune with small melodic steps (smaller than a semitone).</p><p>If you can find a copy of the old tuning (at) <a href="http://eartha.mills.edu">eartha.mills.edu</a> CD, there are some good tracks on there; I especially like Ernie Crews&apos; &quot;Vilano&quot; in 19-ET, and Gary Morrison&apos;s &quot;New Awakening&quot; in 88-CET (88-cent per step equal temperament). Neil Haverstick also has a good track on that CD, but probably my favorite of his would be &quot;Mysteries&quot; from his &quot;Acoustic Stick&quot; CD.</p><p>Let&apos;s see... something from one of William Sethares&apos; CD&apos;s would also be essential to include... how about &quot;Isochronism&quot; from the &quot;Exomusicology&quot; CD. And as far as I know, Prent Rodgers doesn&apos;t have any CD&apos;s, but you can find his music at <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/prentrodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/prentrodgers</a>. Lots of cool stuff on that page; if I had to pick one, I&apos;ll pick &quot;Subduction Zone&quot;.</p><p>I guess that&apos;s 10. Well, that should be a good start; I can think of lots of other examples, but these are the first ones that came to mind.</p></div><h3><a id=62889 href="#62889">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2005 1:42:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Flavell&quot; &lt;bill_flavell@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I was wondering where to start with my<br/>&gt; alternative tunings musical listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Any suggestions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Please be more specific than a particular<br/>&gt; CD or record, and name the particular piece<br/>&gt; or subsection of a particular piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Bill Flavell</p><p>Microtonal music always sounds &quot;wrong&quot; at first if you&apos;ve been<br/>listening to 12-equal only for a while.
