And is it contrary to use yours and George&apos;s notation in a way where this notation  would be<br/>used for a 16 tone scale that was not Equal. Being a recurrent sequence, the idea of simple ratios<br/>would not apply. So do you two object to the idea of the notation being used asa tabliture when<br/>the tuning involves high number ratios.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a forthcoming paper on the sagittal notation system there are two<br/>&gt; notations proposed for 15-tET. One uses the scale&apos;s best approximation<br/>&gt; of a fifth (9/15 oct or 720 c) between the nominals CGDAE, and the<br/>&gt; 5-comma up and down accidentals for one degree either side of these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C C/ D\ D D/ E\ E E/ G\ G G/ A\ A A/ C\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2003 2:40:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Hello Dave!<br/>&gt;     I know we have been talking about 15 EDO but i was curious what<br/>the notation of 16 ET would<br/>&gt; be.</p><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>By the way, this -EDO versus -ET versus -tET stuff must be awful for<br/>newbies. I&apos;m not even sure which one to use myself! :-) Any newbies<br/>reading, you can safely assume they all mean the same thing (equal<br/>division of the octave) maybe until you get into some very fine<br/>points, or maybe forever.</p><p>Regarding 16-ET: Its best fifths are so far from just that there is no<br/>sensible &quot;native-fifth&quot; notation for it. But a notation based on the<br/>pelogic temperament (as generated by the 675 cent interval), could be<br/>devised for it, with 7 nominals. However I would not want to use the<br/>letters FCGDAEB for these since in that case the EF and BC intervals<br/>would be 50% _wider_ than the CD GA etc. intervals (225c versus 150c).</p><p>Instead we recommended that 16-ET be notated as every 3rd note of<br/>48-ET, which is of course a multiple of (or perhaps I should say, a<br/>further subdivision of) 12-ET into eighth-tones, which looks like this.</p><p>48-ET Sagittal mixed notation (ASCII shorthand)<br/>A to G, #, b as for 12-ET<br/>^ quarter-tone up   (11-M-diesis up)<br/>~ eighth-tone up    (23-comma up)<br/>z eighth-tone down  (23-comma down)<br/>v quarter-tone down (11-M-diesis down)</p><p>Here&apos;s 16-ET as every 3rd note of 48-ET (aligned with D natural to<br/>minimize accidentals).</p><p>Cz C^ C#~ D Ebz Ev E~ F F#z Gv G~ G#(or Ab) Az A^ Bb~ B</p><p>It isn&apos;t pretty, but it&apos;s simpler than, for example, the 72-ET-based<br/>notation for blackjack.</p><p>&gt; And is it contrary to use yours and George&apos;s notation in a way where<br/>this notation  would be<br/>&gt; used for a 16 tone scale that was not Equal.</p><p>Not necessarily. If it was nearly equal this would be fine.</p><p>&gt; Being a recurrent sequence, the idea of simple ratios<br/>&gt; would not apply.</p><p>Can you tell us what the scale is (cents or ratios), or what the<br/>generator(s) is/are? We may be able to come up with a better notation<br/>for your unequal 16 as an approximate subset of some larger ET other<br/>than 48-ET.</p><p>If it&apos;s a pelog superset, then maybe it&apos;s closer to being 16 out of<br/>23-ET or 39-ET.</p><p>The first question to ask when looking for a sagittal notation for<br/>some scale is, does it contain any chain(s) of fifths (between 4/7 and<br/>3/5 octave in size), and if so, what size are they?</p><p>&gt; So do you two object to the idea of the notation being used asa<br/>tabliture when<br/>&gt; the tuning involves high number ratios.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &quot;tablature&quot; here. I understand tablature<br/>to be notation that indicates in a fairly direct and pictorial manner<br/>where the performer should put their fingers. This does not involve<br/>directly represent pitches and so sagittal notation is not relevant here.</p><p>Perhaps you are using the term loosely, as I have noticed others<br/>doing, to also include scordatura notations? I understand scordatura<br/>to be indirectly telling the performer where to put their fingers by<br/>directly indicating the pitch that this _would_ produce _if_ the<br/>instrument were in its standard tuning. Standard tunings don&apos;t usually<br/>require accidentals other than # and b, so sagittal would usually not<br/>be relevant here either.</p><p>But I understand you want to let the performer think of the instrument<br/>as being in 16-ET and play it accordingly, even though it is really in<br/>an unequal 16 note per octave scale.</p><p>In general I&apos;d say yes, we would object to sagittal being used in this<br/>way. This is because the overiding principle of the whole sagittal<br/>system is that the accidentals represent specific commas, so no matter<br/>what the tuning, if you see, for example, C E\ you know that this is<br/>the tuning&apos;s best approximation of a just major third from C. i.e. You<br/>know roughly what it will _sound_ like. This is analogous to what<br/>happens in different human languages that use the same character set.</p><p>In general scordatura severely violates this connection between<br/>notation and sound, and would defeat sagittal&apos;s whole raison detre.</p><p>However, what you&apos;re proposing may actually be close enough in sound<br/>to 16-ET that it isn&apos;t really a scordatura. And if this is not the<br/>case, then we&apos;d certainly like to be given a chance to come up with a<br/>better direct-pitch sagittal notation for your scale before you resort<br/>to scordatura.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2003 5:58:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 21 Dec 2003 10:40:22 -0000, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@bigpond.net.au">d.keenan@bigpond.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;Regarding 16-ET: Its best fifths are so far from just that there is no<br/>&gt;sensible &quot;native-fifth&quot; notation for it.
