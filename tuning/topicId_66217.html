Rather than over-<br/>articulating, he says, he tries to &quot;over-hold&quot;, or<br/>create an &quot;over-legato&quot; sound.

Not bad, coming from the<br/>&gt; soon-to-be Music Director of the Academy of<br/>&gt; Ancient Music!</p><p>&apos;Convert&apos; indeed - you would indeed need unusual faith to fit it to<br/>Frescobaldi or Uncle Louis C.</p><p>For these composers it is suitable in the sense that 12-ET is<br/>suitable, that you don&apos;t hear anything noticeably pure or<br/>interestingly offensive. Whereas they use one or both extremes to<br/>great effect.</p><p>One might reasonably claim that doing all this different repertoire<br/>live requires a compromise tuning. That runs into 2 problems: why<br/>compromise in the direction of near-equal tuning? and why choose<br/>repertoire in such a way that the near-equal compromise is needed at all?</p><p>Funnily enough, basically all of the live programme could be<br/>accommodated in a much more unequal, and probably much more<br/>historical-for-everyone-except-Bach, &apos;temperament ordinaire&apos; with<br/>nearly pure diatonic thirds.</p><p>(Disclaimers: I do not mean the 1/6 PC based late Baroque tuning I<br/>suggested earlier for Telemann. I also do not say that the tuning used<br/>by Egarr is &apos;historical-for-Bach&apos; - just that it is less-unhistorical<br/>for Bach than for earlier composers.)</p><p>Gustav Leonhardt goes in this direction on his claviorganum disc, he<br/>has repertoire from the Renaissance up until JSB, and everything is in<br/>standard meantone or slight adjustments thereof: he even transposes a<br/>Bach family piece from Eb to C major for the meantone instrument.</p><p>I remember I read some advertising pitch about all the harpsichords of<br/>some London school of music being tuned to the new recipe. It&apos;s sad if<br/>this means some instruments or pieces being tuned *away* from meantone<br/>or ordinaire where they belong. Lehman&apos;s &apos;success&apos; (applied, to be<br/>sure, without Brad&apos;s explicit approval) is Frescobaldi&apos;s failure - or<br/>rather, lack of complete success.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2006 11:22:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; It is available through this week on the &quot;Listen to the latest<br/>&gt; &gt; programmes - Sunday&quot; link at this page:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m finding Egarr&apos;s - that is the<br/>&gt; Bach-Lehmann - intonation very active and lively.<br/>&gt; The proof of the pudding, etc.  Egarr makes a<br/>&gt; good case for this tuning.</p><p>A good case that it works, but not a comparitive case vs.<br/>other tunings, right?
