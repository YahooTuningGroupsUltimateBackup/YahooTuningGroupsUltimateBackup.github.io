It&apos;s not *12* that we want to get away from, but rather *12-equal*. Have we forgotten that there are plenty of *12-unequal* alternatives, many of which have been popular longer than 12-equal?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I read the following, I couldn&apos;t help noticing that it&apos;s all about alternatives to *12*, without any mention of alternatives to *equal*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haha. Well, I admit that I like 12-equal. And I like equal<br/>&gt; temperaments in general. I&apos;m actually pretty surprised that you&apos;re<br/>&gt; such a big fan of unequal ones, since I know you have AP, and as<br/>&gt; someone else with AP, the whole concept irritates me.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand why you would say that.  The only reason I can think of is that pitches in 12-unequal differ from 12-equal.  However, the pitches in 17-equal, 19-equal, 31-equal, etc. differ from 12-equal by even greater amounts, so you should then be even more irritated with non-12-equal than 12-unequal.  In order to cope, we must think of the pitch labels (F, C, G, etc.) as applying to a range of pitches (or pitch &quot;buckets&quot;) rather than single (fixed) frequencies.</p><p>But if that is not the issue, then what is?</p><p>&gt; Not that I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; get used to them, but I prefer being able to create any sonority over<br/>&gt; any chroma that I wish.</p><p>But in an ET you can&apos;t create *any sonority* over any chroma you wish.  You&apos;re stuck with the limited number of sonorities available in the ET.  In an un-ET there are many more sonorities from which to choose, and you choose them by your choice of tonic key.</p><p>There is a term, &quot;mood&quot; (coined by Ivor Darreg several decades ago), that applies to the differences that can be heard in one tuning vs. another (e.g., 19-ET vs. 12-ET).  (I don&apos;t know whether that&apos;s the best term for it, but it&apos;s distinctive and has been used for a good many years for that purpose.)  With an ET the mood does not change with transposition, but with an un-ET the mood does change, often dramatically.  At first I thought of these different moods within a single tuning as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; keys, but now I regard contrasting moods as a feature that can be exploited for dramatic effect (see an example below).</p><p>&gt; This is, admittedly, a part of microtonal<br/>&gt; music I have not explored so much, and perhaps my ideas will change<br/>&gt; when I mess around with them more.</p><p>Well, then, mess away!  You&apos;ll find Scala files for my favorite tried &amp; true unequal tunings here:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/scl/</a><br/>For 12:  Secor5_23TX.scl<br/>For 17:  Secor17wt.scl<br/>For 19:  Secor19wt.scl<br/>For 19 (with 11&apos;s added in 3 keys):  Secor19p3.scl<br/>For 34:  Secor34wt.scl</p><p>&gt; &gt; Not only is there 12-unequal, but also 17-unequal, 19-unequal, 29-unequal, and 34-unequal, which are mentioned far less often around here than JI. I&apos;m not talking about 12-, 17-, or 19-tone MOS&apos;s of regular temperaments, but rather circulating tempered tunings that are playable in all keys and optimized, i.e., tuned significantly &quot;better&quot; than equal (whatever that means), in a limited number of keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah yes, limiting the number of keys... :(</p><p>That&apos;s another half-truth.  Allow me to give an example, using the high-contrast Secor5_23TX.scl tuning for 12-unET:</p><p>True: In 12-unET you are limited in the number of keys with a mood similar to 12-ET to two (major triads: E and Eb).  However, this is good IMO, because I would rather not be stuck with only that one mood.  Once I heard how historical meantone triads sounded, I found (and still find) the heavy tempering of the 3rds of 12-ET rather irritating, and the equalness of the tuning affords me no escape.</p><p>False: In 12-ET you are limited in the number of keys in which you can have the historical meantone mood, which is zero, whereas in 12-unEQ, there are 6 (major triads: Bb, F, C, G, D, A) in which the major 3rds are tempered less than 8 cents.  In 12-ET you are also limited in the number of keys in which you can have a pythagorean or meta-pythagorean mood, again zero!  In 12-unEQ, OTOH, there are 4 (major triads: B, F#, C#, G#/Ab).</p><p>For an example of dramatic effect, try a V-i  (dominant to tonic) progression in the keys of E minor, B minor, or F# minor, where a relatively dissonant (heavily tempered) dominant triad resolves to a much more consonant (lightly tempered) tonic (minor) triad.</p><p>Another difference between 12-ET and this particular 12-unET is that the 24 major &amp; minor triads in the former have irrationally related beating, whereas in the latter all have proportional-beating.  (As to how audible is the difference is debatable, but there is a difference.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At some point in the future I&apos;d like to do an ET survey and write a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece in every tuning from 7 to 22 or something, and if I do, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to skip 12, just for symbolic reasons (and also because I think<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there&apos;s a lot of xenharmonic material to squeeze out of it too).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yep, I&apos;d say that just about all the xenharmonic material got squeezed out of 12-unequal when it finally succumbed to equalization in the latter half of the 19th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, don&apos;t forget that 12-equal has good approximations to 17/16 and<br/>&gt; 19/16 as well. So chords like E-F#-D-F sound something like 8:9:14:17.<br/>&gt; There are scales that can be constructed with these sonorities, one of<br/>&gt; which is a mode of the Magen Abot scale I posted on tuning a while<br/>&gt; ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s also the fact that a lot of the really, really hip modern<br/>&gt; stuff I listen to, I think, has amazing and beautiful sonorities that<br/>&gt; have emerged from a radically expanded approach to 12-equal and<br/>&gt; diatonic harmony, which I think hasn&apos;t fully crossed back over to<br/>&gt; classical music yet. So to take some of these ideas and put them back<br/>&gt; in a classical setting would be xenharmonic in its own right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, this piece: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMINC9EOZME">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMINC9EOZME</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Start listening at 4:10. At 4:58 onward, I get chills. If this isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; truly xenharmonic, it&apos;s at least pseudo-xenharmonic :) I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; worked it out yet, but I strongly suspect that what they&apos;re doing here<br/>&gt; is treating 12-equal like a tempered CPS, and modulating all over the<br/>&gt; place, but pedaling it over the Db. That is, they try to modulate<br/>&gt; continuously to a mode that shares a common dyad or two, and do it in<br/>&gt; a way that it keeps sounding unresolved and yet harmonic. Then they<br/>&gt; pedal it over the Eb.</p><p>Nicely creative and very tasteful.  It would be well worth your while to figure out exactly what&apos;s going on with the harmony (which can hold its own against the best of 20th-century &quot;classical&quot; music).  But in spite of the progressively thicker textures, I have no trouble telling that it&apos;s unmistakably within the 12-ET range of mood and not xenharmonic.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even this is besides the point, which is that even if you really HATE<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 12...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (But not as much as I hate EQUAL ...)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7-tet is way further out of tune with JI than 12, and on this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; album, it still sounds great.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 18:20:22:24:27:30:33<br/>&gt; &gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; 17:19:21:23:25:28:31<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is an interesting possibility. That would probably sound really good.</p><p>The chords would be smoother and more cohesive due to difference-tone stabilization.  One place where JI really shines is in approximating EDO&apos;s that do not (in turn) approximate low-harmonic-limit JI.  You&apos;ve probably read this already, (and my apologies if so, since I mentioned it recently, and it&apos;s also the wrong time of year), but in case not, here&apos;s the underlying principle:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/blarney.txt">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/blarney.txt</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; Gentlemen, it&apos;s been a pleasure to seize this opportunity to award your discussion a &quot;rave&quot; review. 8&gt;}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaaaaaaaaa HA!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, I sent you an offlist about 68-equal a little bit ago...<br/>&gt; did you by chance get it?</p><p>I may have, but I&apos;m not sure.
