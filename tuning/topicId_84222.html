It was a complex matter.</p><p>Now I will give you basic information regarding how the perfect link 3/2 works to get its higher perfect relations,(1.5 x tone frequency), like Cx 1.5, C#x 1.5, ....F#x 1.5, and why G x 1.5, Ab x 1.5, A x 1.5, Bb x 1.5 and B x 1.5 give wrong values in the second octave.</p><p>Nature has &quot;virtually&quot; inserted a second G&apos; in all the octaves to make a right coupling between any two consecutive octaves. The G/G&apos; ratio is a little bit higher than the schisma. I wonder the posibility of a tentative average of both G&apos;s. Need to study this point.</p><p>I am making a detailed list of the natural tones (C to 8C) where the second G&apos; works periodically in all octaves and explains how these links work.</p><p>Since I am wording about 30 pages on this subject to register it in the Peruvian Registration Office, what I can do is to give it to you and to the tuning list the global concept of the double G octaves which do not mean that the new scale is having two frequency values for G, it keeps the normal G = 1.5.</p><p>I am unable to give the information through my file, as moderator Carl Luma knows, my recent two files I tried to place in my file were rejected by unknown reasons. Another possibility is to place it in a folder, if so, I hope won&apos;t have any problem.</p><p>Once it is registered the pamphlet in about 30 days, I will send you  and to the list full information regarding this subject if you agree.</p><p>I suggest you to give me your private e-mail address and use this way in further messages.</p><p>Below I give you preliminar information:</p><p>--C = 1</p><p>x alpha = C#</p><p>x beta = D</p><p>x alpha = Eb</p><p>x alpha = E</p><p>x beta = F =(4/3)</p><p>x beta = F#</p><p>x alpha = G&apos; (Virtual G)</p><p>x A factor that is Slightly higher than the schisma = G = 1.5.</p><p>x beta ..... = Ab</p><p>x alpha .... = A</p><p>x ........ = Bb</p><p>x ........ = B</p><p>x ........ = 2C</p><p>The above tone frequencies let the obtainment of 2F = 2.666...= (8/3), 2G = 3, 4C = 4 plus the remaining tones which work in the second octave. The perfect link of 3/2 equally works in all the octaves.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p><a href="mailto:piagui@ec-red.com">piagui@ec-red.com</a></p><p>Lima, August 02, 2009</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Jul 30, 2009 at 11:38 PM, Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dear friends,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Five hours ago I successfully finished the design of a twelve tone scale.
