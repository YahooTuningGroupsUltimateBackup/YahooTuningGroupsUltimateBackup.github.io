By further extrapolating that others must equally hate the taste of<br/>coconut, one could falsely conclude that others must feel similarly.  In<br/>contradistinction, there has long been a history of people preferring just<br/>intonation intervals over equal tempered intervals.  I&apos;m not sure this kind<br/>of internal test is the kind to base a universal assumption.</p><p>As you find coconut tasty (which I do not) then please feel free to gorge on<br/>it (metaphorically speaking).  Maybe I&apos;m putting the topic into the realm of<br/>tolerance for difference.  Regarding just intervals, I do suggest that you<br/>use rich acoustic intervals to hear the best examples of just intervals, as<br/>opposed to sine waves.  The advice given by another (unnamed) writer to<br/>emerge yourself into Arabic music is an excellent one.  That is precisely<br/>what I did.  Go for Oum Kalthoum and try to pick out the quartertones.  They<br/>are so organically integral to the music that all notes are fully legitimate<br/>as scale (or maqam) tones.</p><p>Good luck in your research.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director, AFMM</p></div>
