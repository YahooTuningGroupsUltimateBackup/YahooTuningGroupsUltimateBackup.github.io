They do tend to be uneven, and in my opinion bug temperament seems to have a better approximation of pelog scales than mavila or 9-ET. It&apos;s true that &quot;pelogic&quot; was what we used to call mavila, and it does have something of the flavor of pelog, but I don&apos;t think it would be heard as &quot;the real thing&quot; if you were to tune a gamelan to it.</p><p>Bug does have a good pelog approximation within its 9-note MOS scale, but there probably isn&apos;t any one regular tuning that stands out as a good version of pelog. Also keep in mind that not all 7 notes of pelog are equal; typically 5 of the 7 notes will be used most frequently, and the other 2 notes only occasionally. So even if some tuning of the 7-note pelog is proper, the typical 5-note subset won&apos;t be.</p></div><h3><a id=95597 href="#95597">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2011 4:39:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Does anyone have the impression when listening to gamelan<br/>music that it approximates JI, such that regular mapping<br/>would be appropriate?

Interestingly enough, both of his versions used fourths of 522 cents but there was one great difference. The &quot;type A&quot; was a regular temperament which stacked 6 generators of 522 cents in the &quot;ordinary&quot; fashion, while the &quot;type B&quot; used generators of 261 cents and was essentially an 8-tone chain of &quot;semi-fourths&quot; with one left out (like using generator counts from -2 to 5 but excluding 4, for example).<br/>Now the question is how old Hornbostel&apos;s ideas were and what motivated him to do it this way.</p><p>&gt; - The &quot;minor thirds&quot; in 9-tet are almost perfect 7/6&apos;s. Is it perhaps<br/>&gt; that pelog:mavila::superpyth:meantone?</p><p>I&apos;m a bit doubtful here.</p><p>&gt; - In addition, the 9-tet mavila scale is proper, but not strictly<br/>&gt; proper. There is an ambiguity between the large second and the small<br/>&gt; third. Has this feature been exploited much in pelogian music? Even if<br/>&gt; the true pelogian scale doesn&apos;t work out to exactly 7 of 9-equal, I<br/>&gt; would assume that from a Rothenbergian standpoint, the resultant scale<br/>&gt; would be close enough to proper that mentally, the similarity between<br/>&gt; the intervals would be noted.</p><p>Together with the claim of unequal one-step intervals, this might be another idea suggesting something like bug rather than mavila. The obvious question then is, of course, what do we do when bug(7) results in a &quot;non-pelogian&quot; scale. And the quickest solution, undeniably, is to start with bug(8) and then remove one pitch.</p><p>BTW: Although it may sound strange and foolish, I&apos;ve also, run across a description of pelog like an enhanced version of slendro, which, making even less sense than 9-equal, started with 10-equal and went something like &quot;1 1 2 2 1 1 2&quot;. From the viewpoint of regular temperaments, this is something completely weird because the larger interval should not occur twice in a row if it occurs less times than the smaller one.</p><p>Anyway, some gamelan music (even in its &quot;traditional form&quot;) uses scales which are audibly not regular temperaments but get close to something like &quot;A-B-C-E-F-A&quot; or &quot;A-Bb-C-E-F-A&quot;. This would suggest a 3D understanding, which may also offer many &quot;non-gamelan&quot; options like making a 5-limit JI version or taking a mode of orwell allowing you to use the pitch exactly between B and Bb.</p><p>Whatever it is, I still like mavila more than all the other options. :-D</p><p>Petr</p></div>
