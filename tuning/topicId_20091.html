When I get home, I start putzing with it. I suppose if all I had<br/>was a piano, I would make do with that as well. But, I think I might be<br/>missing something here...it seems like you&apos;re trying to make a point,<br/>but what is it? Yes, I am a composer/performer, but sometimes I go for<br/>long periods without performing any of my original music...but, I still<br/>compose nonetheless. Here&apos;s a nice McLaughlin quote (from GP Jan 2001)<br/>that points in the right direction...&quot; I must go to a special place in<br/>my head to write. It&apos;s like a realm...analogous to where philosophers or<br/>scientists might go to pick up ideas that are drifting around. Do you<br/>know what I mean? I don&apos;t think anybody really invents anything.<br/>Everything has already been created...you just have to go get it. And to<br/>get it, you have to go to the right place. You get there, you hook in,<br/>and bingo...&quot;<br/>    Actually, it&apos;s really hard to describe the moment of creation...it<br/>doesn&apos;t translate to words as easily as one might like. I&apos;ll finish this<br/>post later, as duties call at this time...I&apos;ll chat a bit about the<br/>creation of one of my album covers, as it happened in a way that really<br/>blew my wittle mind...see you in a bit...Hstick  PS...creation, for me,<br/>is not necessarily about music, either...there&apos;s other artistic forms I<br/>enjoy working with, too...</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/11/2001 10:00:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Neil,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Jon...actually, over the years, I&apos;ve had quite a few ideas come<br/>&gt; to me without an instrument in my hand, usually while driving<br/>&gt; around in my car.</p><p>I suspected this would be the case.</p><p>&gt; But, I think I might be missing something here...it seems like<br/>&gt; you&apos;re trying to make a point, but what is it?</p><p>Aiiii! Seems like everyone read too much into my question! I hope<br/>you&apos;ve noticed my replies to Kraig and Johnny, but I want to say to<br/>*you* that I would never presume to suggest to you a *better* way to<br/>compose. Let me try to re-frame what I was saying:</p><p>You mentioned, at a bit of length, about how you approach composing,<br/>and in your case it is almost a &apos;channeling&apos; scenario, as you feel<br/>that you are a vessel that the music flows out of. This is all<br/>perfectly swell.</p><p>I&apos;ve also listened to (and enjoyed) your music, and what I was really<br/>getting at was this: as it stands, virtually all of your material is<br/>related to your guitar. I&apos;m wondering what you would come up with if<br/>you one day asked yourself &quot;What would Neil Haverstick music sound<br/>like, some new stuff, if there was a guitar to bring it into the<br/>world?&quot;</p><p>I just wonder if it wouldn&apos;t take you down a different path, one you<br/>might not have thought about walking down. Again, this is not<br/>suggesting you *should* do this, but I also think that there may be<br/>music for other musicians sitting somewhere inside of you. Maybe<br/>they&apos;ll never see it, but you seem to be very thoughtful about the<br/>mysteries of compelling music to bloom, and I was thinking of these<br/>quite different flowers.</p><p>That&apos;s all, nothing more. And certainly not wanting you to be<br/>something you aren&apos;t!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
