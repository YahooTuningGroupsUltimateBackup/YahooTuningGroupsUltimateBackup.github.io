That&apos;s very different, lots of 5-limit JI.</p><p>Similar kinds of close-voiced singing, like in the example posted, with deliberate beating are found in little isolated pockets in what was the ancient world. The Bulgarians call the beating &quot;making it ring like bells&quot;. Sardinia has a version with killer buzzing dis/concords. If I remember correctly, there&apos;s a similar kind of singing on the Istrian peninsula, near Krk- there&apos;s some strange stuff in that region, like the last people who speak some ancient kind of Romanian, of all things.</p><p>A composer from Dalmatia gave me a great recording of traditional Dalmatian microtonal singing a while ago, but I can&apos;t find it at the moment.  If I find it I can float you a copy, if you really dig it. Sadly, all these treasures seem to be little-known, even though there are good documentaries and people who maintain the traditions. And all this gets mixed up with nationalistic crap- for example Serbian TV was awesome during the war, amazing authentic folk performances, but it&apos;s been plastic ladies doing &quot;turbo-folk&quot; ever since.</p><p>Mostly this stuff is forgotten.</p></div>
