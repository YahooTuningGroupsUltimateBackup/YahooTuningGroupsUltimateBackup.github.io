Levy&apos;s article on Guillaume Costeley which I cite in the<br/>&gt;reply to Joe Monzo (maybe in this same Digest), at pp. 249-250. While I&apos;m<br/>&gt;not sure I mentioned Titelouze previously, he certainly deserves to be<br/>&gt;mentioned under the heading of 19-tet, based on Levy&apos;s short reference.</p><p>I think you did mention Titelouze before.
