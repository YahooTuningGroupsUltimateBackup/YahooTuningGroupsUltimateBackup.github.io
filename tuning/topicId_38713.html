The company simply could not find a guitarist willing<br/>to attend all of the rehearsals and do everything else that is required.  One<br/>of the youngest singers and actors has a guitar however, and is learning to<br/>play it.  He offered to do what he can.</p><p>He has an electronic tuner for it and a clamp on capo bar.  The first few<br/>times he played, I just listened to whatever sound he was getting.  He really<br/>is only playing during 2 numbers, the opening Flamenco style chant (some<br/>chords in Bb minor) and for the song, &quot;Little Bird, Little Bird&quot; in which I<br/>am the principal vocalist.  He really is exposed in this number, however<br/>because he will be the only instrumentalist heard.  There will be no other<br/>orchestra accompaniment.  Naturally, I have a vested interest in what kind of<br/>sound will be my accompaniment.</p><p>The G major chord he plays for the Little Bird song sounded pretty sour to<br/>me, even more than Equal Temperament is supposed to be.  I told him I knew of<br/>a special way to tune that would make it sound much sweeter.  He agreed to<br/>have me help him tune it for the next rehearsal.  I brought in my Sanderson<br/>Accu-Tuner in which I had set up the Vallotti style Well Tempered Tuning for<br/>guitar that I had designed under very similar circumstances 10 years ago.</p><p>I got the very same reaction I have witnessed every single time I have done<br/>this:  the jaw drops, the eyes open wide in amazement at the beautiful sound<br/>of the harmony produced by tuning the guitar this way.  I then had him clamp<br/>on the capo bar and play the Bb minor chord that goes with the Flamenco style<br/>chant:  another look of amazement at the beautifully clear but dark and<br/>disturbing sound of the minor chord in 5 flats in a true, Well Tempered<br/>Tuning.  The F Major dominant chord of that key also sounds beautifully clear<br/>and true.</p><p>Now, I have written about this before and had any number of people, all<br/>guitarists of high degrees of skill tell me rather specifically and often<br/>quite harshly that this *cannot* be done!  Needless to say, I have heard much<br/>the same kinds of hard headed opinions about the way I tune the piano but<br/>obviously, I have never believed in what anyone told me, I have only believed<br/>in what I hear as the results of my work.</p><p>Below are the actual figures programed into my Accu-Tuner.  They may not look<br/>&quot;right&quot; to you.  But ask yourself, has any set of figures for tuning the<br/>piano, regardless of temperament ever looked &quot;right&quot; or logical?  They don&apos;t<br/>because of the omnipotent presence of the factor known as Inharmonicity.  All<br/>of these values are read on Octave 4.  That means that the lowest two strings<br/>are read on the 4th partial, the middle three on the 2nd partial and the<br/>highest on its fundamental.</p><p>When Inharmonicity is taken into account, it skews everything, making the<br/>numbers appear irrational.  These figures were arrived at however, by aural<br/>tuning first, then reading the results with the Accu-Tuner.  The figures were<br/>rounded off to convenient whole numbers, much the way I round of my figures<br/>to the nearest 1/2 cent when creating a piano tuning program.  The figures<br/>can also be halved which creates a &quot;Victorianized&quot; version of the same idea.</p><p>IMPORTANT:  All Values are Read on Octave 4</p><p>Note    Vallotti   Victorian</p><p>E2     -4.0          -2.0</p><p>A2      0.0           0.0</p><p>D3      2.0           1.0</p><p>G3      4.0           2.0</p><p>B3      -2.0         -1.0</p><p>E4       0.0          0.0</p><p>My piano technology apprentice, Tyler Smith has been to a rehearsal of the<br/>show and heard how the piano tuned in Equal Beating Victorian Temperament<br/>(EBVT) (click on the link to my website for information on that) and saw how<br/>the guitar was tuned.  Although he is only 18 years old, he is quite well<br/>read and knowledgeable in many subjects.  He was born in 1984 but he has read<br/>George Orwell&apos;s novel by that same name as well as other books by the same<br/>author.</p><p>I found it interesting that he knows that author and interprets the stories<br/>much the same way I do. The Guild of American Luthiers has a web page which<br/>explains its views on how a guitar should be tuned.  My comment about that<br/>writing is that it looks like George Orwell himself had written it.  It<br/>basically says that you cannot do what I have done, don&apos;t even think about<br/>it.  Just do what Big Brother tells you is right and eventually, you&apos;ll learn<br/>to like it.</p><p>Here is the link to that web page:</p><p><a href="http://w3.ime.net/~cygnus/equal_temperament.html">http://w3.ime.net/~cygnus/equal_temperament.html</a></p><p>The web page is really meant to instruct guitarists on how not to make the<br/>same basic errors that piano technicians are prone to making by tuning 4ths &amp;<br/>5ths too purely.  If the open strings of the guitar are tuned to pure 4ths<br/>(and the A2-E4 octave and 5th made pure), the 3rd, G3-B3 and the 6th, D3-B3<br/>will be far too wide, having a &quot;sour&quot; sound to them and effectively be<br/>Pythagorean 3rds (22 cents wide).  The web page teaches the guitar tuner not<br/>to tune the intervals so purely but it also says that there is no other<br/>alternative.</p><p>All I do with both of my above arrangements is simply temper the 4ths &amp; 5ths<br/>a little more.  The Valotti style temperament has the 4ths and 5ths tempered<br/>exactly twice as much as Equal Temperament.  I have learned over the years to<br/>question and prove wrong such iron fisted statements as are made in the<br/>Luthiers Guild web page.</p><p>There has been much the same kind of teaching about piano tuning for the last<br/>hundred years but more and more, people are beginning to realize that there<br/>really are some alternatives to Equal Temperament which can and do work<br/>really well with all of the kinds of music the piano is expected to play.  I<br/>see no reason this can&apos;t be so with the guitar as well.  I did once see a<br/>guitarist of the highest caliber from New York who took a lot of time on<br/>stage carefully tuning his guitar in exactly the same way as I describe below.</p><p>Here are the aural tuning instructions for accomplishing the Vallotti style<br/>Well Tempered Tuning on a six string guitar.</p><p>1.  Tune A2 to A-440 fork or other aural pitch source.</p><p>2.  Tune E4 from A2 a pure octave and 5th first, then flatten E2 until the<br/>Octave and 5th has a lilting beat to it, about 1 beat per second.</p><p>3.  Tune E2 from A4 a pure 4th first, then flatten E2 until the 4th beats at<br/>2 beats per second.  This should create a slightly stretched double octave<br/>from E2-E4.  The double octave should have a very slow, roll to it of about<br/>1/2 beat per second.</p><p>4.  Tune D3 from A2 a pure 4th first, then sharpen D3 until the 4th beats at<br/>2 beats per second.</p><p>5.  Tune G3 from D3 a pure 4th first, then sharpen G3 until the 4th beats at<br/>2 beats per second.</p><p>6.  Tune B3 from E4 a pure 4th first, then flatten B3 until the 4th beats at<br/>2 betas per second.</p><p>The results of this should be that the 3rd, G3-B3 and the 6th, D3-B3 now also<br/>beat at the same slow, 2 beat per second rate.  When all of the 4ths and the<br/>3rd an 6th all beat at the same slow, gentle rate, the tuning is accomplished.</p><p>Bill Bremmer RPT<br/>Madison, Wisconsin<br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.billbremmer.com/">http://www.billbremmer.com/</a>&quot;&gt;Click here: -=w w w . b i l l b r e m m e r . c o m =-&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=38718 href="#38718">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>7/23/2002 6:56:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:50.eaf03be.2a6c9045@aol.com">50.eaf03be.2a6c9045@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>Bill Bremmer wrote:</p><p>&gt; I found it interesting that he knows that author and interprets the<br/>&gt; stories much the same way I do.
