Perhaps 20 algorithmic compositions will be performed.</p><p>HOW SHORT?<br/>We mean REALLY short: 15 seconds to about 3 minutes or so.<br/>WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALGORITHMIC?<br/>Our call is for musical compositions in which the set of &quot;instructions&quot;<br/>(algorithms) which the composer has undertaken (or given to the<br/>performers)<br/>is...<br/>&#x9;&#x9;...elegantly concise, perhaps elegantly elaborated...<br/>&#x9;&#x9;...integrated, whole, original...<br/>&#x9;&#x9;...intriguingly transparent in the musical sound...</p><p> We hope to receive compositions as different, one from another, as<br/>James Tenney&apos;s &quot;Chromatic Canon&quot;, Pauline Oliveros&apos; &quot;Sonic Meditations&quot;,<br/>Iannis Xenakis&apos; &quot;Atrees&quot;, and certain selections from Cage&apos;s &quot;Songbooks&quot;<br/>...only SHORTER!</p><p>SUBMIT WHAT?<br/>o   Score (and cassette tape if available), and/or<br/>o  a MIDI file designed to be realized on Yamaha Disklavier.<br/>o  Program notes and a SHORT Bio.  (Text-only files on MacIntosh Disk<br/>are preferred.)<br/>o  Optionally:  an image of a page from the score or any other<br/>abstraction<br/>representing the algorithm<br/>o  Information about how to contact you by phone/address/email if possible.</p><p>Instrumental parts must be available IMMEDIATELY in February if a work<br/>is<br/>selected for performance.</p><p>MAX patches designed specifically for Disklavier are welcome and will be<br/>implemented in MAX for the actual performance; but a standard MIDI file<br/>representing a sample realization of the patch must be submitted for<br/>consideration at this time.</p><p>DEADLINE?<br/>All materials must be received no later than FEBRUARY 1, 2001.  Please<br/>submit no more than two pieces. Selections will be made by FEBRUARY 15,<br/>2001<br/>by a jury of three composers.</p><p>COMPOSITION AT UCSC:  Composition Faculty at UCSC includes:<br/>David Evan Jones, Hi Kyung Kim, Gordon Mumma (emeritus),<br/>Karlton Hester, Paul Nauert, Peter Elsea, and David Cope.</p><p> TO:<br/>David Cope, 2001 Director APRIL IN SANTA CRUZ<br/>Chair, Music Department<br/>University of California, Santa Cruz<br/>Santa Cruz, CA 95064<br/>QUESTIONS:  <a href="mailto:howell@cats.ucsc.edu">howell@cats.ucsc.edu</a><br/>                --</p><p>                _____________________________________________________________________<br/>David Evan Jones<br/>Phone: 831-459-2804 (message)<br/>FAX:  831-459-5584<br/>Professor, Music Department<br/>University of California,<br/>Santa Cruz, CA 95064</p><p>(I had to reformat this announcement after acquiring it from the<br/>algo-comp web pages, but I don&apos;t think I omitted or changed any text.)</p></div>
