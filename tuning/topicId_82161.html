With a high gain and sloped EQ, you can achieve a pretty astonishing degree of fluidity and control....and ,fWiW (nothing), this kind of thing used to always bring guitarists shopping in the store flying around the corner to see what the hell was that being played on a guitar.....surprise ,surprise:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/dkv6bp">http://tinyurl.com/dkv6bp</a></p></div>
