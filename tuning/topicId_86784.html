Sorry to disappoint, but I don&apos;t do Facebook.  Working as a  public<br/>school teacher makes Facebook too great a risk.  Last year, the  union<br/>official told the faculty that we should not take such a risk.  As  much as I<br/>would love to be part of a greater community through Facebook, it  is too<br/>often used unfairly against people, and unfairly so.  From the  Department of<br/>Education&apos;s point of view, &quot;the teacher is always wrong.&quot;</p><p>Johnny</p></div>
