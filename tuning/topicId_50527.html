(I am certainly open to the possibility that I have missed some post, but compared to the active performers/composers on the various lists, yours is a pretty blank slate)</p><p>I think you are talking out of your hat, but maybe all you need do is be more clear in your writing. Either that, or start giving some documentation to all this performing, premiering, and composing that you are doing! Credibility is built on a base of trusted knowledge, and your cred in this regard is a thin veneer, at least as far as what appears on the lists.</p><p>Maybe what we need to do is have a composition competition, with 6 microtonal keyboard works selected, which you will present in recital in 3 weeks time, all with differing notations.

It seems to me though, that if you had indicated sense above each note, the<br/>players could have better learned their parts on their own.  Maybe that is an<br/>important difference.</p><p>If the notation was in ratios or required real time comparison&apos;s and<br/>listenings, the players had no nope in hell.  However, 3 hours is plenty of time for<br/>such a short piece as yours.  I think your group took a &quot;John Adams&quot; in that<br/>the players decided to chuck your intentions leaving it to everybody else to<br/>just deal with it (&quot;as if anyone could tell&quot;).  I am sorry for your results,<br/>though they played well as 12ers.</p><p>The key to rehearsal is to have the players know their parts before the first<br/>rehearsals.  Second, there is no available time for special tuning and it<br/>must be succumbed into the &quot;normal&quot; (which is less than needed) rehearsal time.<br/>Many performances get only 3 hours rehearsal total, but each hour is on a diffe<br/>rent day.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2003 9:42:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I doubt anything I&apos;ve ever written here was very transparent.</p><p>Might want to work on that, then.
