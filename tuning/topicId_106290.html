<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Yahoo has upped our file space to 2 GB, so files work again</h1><h3>battaglia01@...</h3><span>9/7/2013 9:05:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yahoo! has updated its groups interface. Some things have moved, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>look like anything has broken.<br/>One huge improvement made is that we now have 2 GB of file space, rather than<br/>the older absurdly small 100 MB limit,solving all of the problems we had before<br/>about file space.<br/>So, feel free to ditch this silly &quot;attachments&quot; thing and just upload your files<br/>to the Files section directly now, like you used to. I&apos;ve already moved<br/>everything back that I&apos;d previously tried to relocate to &quot;attachments,&quot; so all<br/>of the links that were broken when that happened should now be unbroken.<br/>Of course, 2 GB is still not a ton of space for a group this size, so let&apos;s try<br/>to be sensible - if you&apos;re going to upload something really massive, please host<br/>it elsewhere on the web instead. Chris Vaisvil in the past has offered hosting<br/>for microtonal stuff, so you may want to try asking him.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2013 9:27:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think you&apos;re looking at the message space.

I just tried uploading something that was 6<br/>MB large and it just craps out and says &quot;Sorry, an error occurred<br/>while loading the content.&quot; This new interface sucks.</p><p>So for now, I guess, keep doing the attachments thing. I&apos;ve moved the<br/>old attachments back to files, so I&apos;m going to leave them there for<br/>the purpose of &quot;sealing&quot; the files section of the site off. It&apos;s got<br/>to be attachments from here on out.</p><p>Mike</p></div>
