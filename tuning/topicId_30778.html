Everybody who knows me knows that I don&apos;t hesitate<br/>asking questions, regardless of how lame...</p><p>Here are some questions on the Keenan color keyboard charts.  They&apos;re<br/>quite beautiful, by the way...</p><p>1) I understand that the colors are the chains of secors.  However,<br/>what are the little black and white dots that also seem to go along<br/>about a chain of 10, but they differ from the colors.  That was never<br/>quite explained on the diagram... or if it was, I&apos;m not seeing it.</p><p>2) The various intervals below the keyboard indicate *samples* of<br/>various intervals, yes??  They are not all of them, right... since I<br/>know the smaller intervals, for instance, would include other colors<br/>than the ones shown if they were all there, yes?</p><p>3) Why is it that, while the two keyboards changed the base note,<br/>from B[ on Halberstadt A to B[ on Halberstadt Ab, and the colors<br/>change on the keyboard, all the colors of the illustrated intervals<br/>remain the same in both charts.  That seemed a little &quot;suspicious&quot; to<br/>me... Is that the way it&apos;s *supposed* to work out??</p><p>4) Even more importantly:  I understand the idea of coloring chains<br/>according to the string of secors, but does that make any sense from<br/>a *concordance* standpoint?  Generally, I have been coloring<br/>concordant tetrads with the same color stickers.  In this case,<br/>though, even some of the most common and concordant tetrads would<br/>have different colors, yes?  So, although interesting, how does this<br/>particular coloring help a person find the *concordances* in the<br/>system??</p><p>Well, I guess that&apos;s all the questions for *now*  :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2001 2:27:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Generally, I have been coloring<br/>&gt; concordant tetrads with the same color stickers.</p><p>Very few of them are there in their entirety, in your current scheme.<br/>I think you&apos;ll have much more to gain from Dave Keenan&apos;s coloring.<br/>I&apos;ll let him try to explain it to you, though I think I can answer<br/>all your questions straight away . . .</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>11/27/2001 2:34:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/30786">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/30786</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Generally, I have been coloring<br/>&gt; &gt; concordant tetrads with the same color stickers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very few of them are there in their entirety, in your current<br/>scheme.<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;ll have much more to gain from Dave Keenan&apos;s coloring.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll let him try to explain it to you, though I think I can answer<br/>&gt; all your questions straight away . . .</p><p>Well, that&apos;s cool...

No need to make folks wait, given the time zone differences etc.</p><p>&gt; Here are some questions on the Keenan color keyboard charts.<br/>They&apos;re<br/>&gt; quite beautiful, by the way...</p><p>Yes, but it would be a hell of a job to actually paint a keyboard like that, wouldn&apos;t it?</p><p>I&apos;ve updated the middle-C on middle-C 21 key per octave keyboard chart. It&apos;s now called<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/Miracle/BlackjackHalberstadt21C.doc">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/Miracle/BlackjackHalberstadt21C.doc</a></p><p>I&apos;ve enlarged it to 88 keys as requested. I&apos;ve added ratios for the 12-integer-limit intervals. I&apos;ve corrected the decimal names to correspond to Graham&apos;s latest system.</p><p>&gt; 1) I understand that the colors are the chains of secors.  However,<br/>&gt; what are the little black and white dots that also seem to go along<br/>&gt; about a chain of 10, but they differ from the colors.  That was<br/>never<br/>&gt; quite explained on the diagram... or if it was, I&apos;m not seeing it.</p><p>They correspond to what blackjack would look like on a generalised (or blackjack-specific) keyboard. Except they would all be squeezed much closer horizontally so that an octave was back to its usual 282 mm again.</p><p>Ignore the difference between black and white dots for the moment. Imagine them all red. Notice that each slanting line corresponds to a single key colour. If you were actually playing on the dots, this positional information would be superior to the key colours, since most people haven&apos;t internalised the order of colours in the rainbow. You would have to actually change your finger positions slightly (front-to-back) to play a 7:9 instead of a 4:5, while both span a perfect fifth on the Halberstadt.</p><p>If you are using coloured dots instead of painting the keys, you should arrange the dots in these slanting lines. Ignore whether they are black or white and instead make them the colour of the key they are shown on.</p><p>But why are they black and white? The white ones correspond to the naturals in the decimal notation.</p><p>&gt; 2) The various intervals below the keyboard indicate *samples* of<br/>&gt; various intervals, yes??  They are not all of them, right... since I<br/>&gt; know the smaller intervals, for instance, would include other colors<br/>&gt; than the ones shown if they were all there, yes?</p><p>That&apos;s correct. You can shift the colurs up or down the rainbow provided you shift the colour of every note by the same amount. e.g. a perfect fifth on the keyboard will give a 4:5 if it goes green:cyan as shown or if it goes orange:yellow or yellow:green or cyan:blue or blue:magenta. Any other perfect fifths will give you a 7:9.</p><p>&gt; 3) Why is it that, while the two keyboards changed the base note,<br/>&gt; from B[ on Halberstadt A to B[ on Halberstadt Ab, and the colors<br/>&gt; change on the keyboard, all the colors of the illustrated intervals<br/>&gt; remain the same in both charts.  That seemed a little &quot;suspicious&quot;<br/>to<br/>&gt; me... Is that the way it&apos;s *supposed* to work out??</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s the way it&apos;s supposed to work.</p><p>&gt; 4) Even more importantly:  I understand the idea of coloring chains<br/>&gt; according to the string of secors, but does that make any sense from<br/>&gt; a *concordance* standpoint?  Generally, I have been coloring<br/>&gt; concordant tetrads with the same color stickers.  In this case,<br/>&gt; though, even some of the most common and concordant tetrads would<br/>&gt; have different colors, yes?  So, although interesting, how does this<br/>&gt; particular coloring help a person find the *concordances* in the<br/>&gt; system??</p><p>Your method will only work while you&apos;re only dealing with a few chords. If you&apos;re going to have a different colour for every consonant (or otherwise interesting) chord, you&apos;re going to run out of colours pretty soon, and some keys are going to have a _lot_ of different colours on them. There are eight h7 chords (7-limit tetrads 4:5:6:7) to start with. My colouring scheme is not specific to h7 or any other chords. It is guaranteed to work for everything, including chords that haven&apos;t even been invented yet!</p><p>But to take h7 chords as our first example. If we put together the required intervals from the chart we find that a h7 chord looks like a stack of P5|P4|P4 keyboard intervals and goes green:cyan:green:cyan. This means it could also go yellow:green:yellow:green or cyan:blue:cyan:blue. But if you try to play the same pattern of P5|P4|P4 with cyan:green:cyan:green etc. you will not get a h7 chord you&apos;ll get a supermajor wide minor seventh chord (SMWm7), which is an interesting 9-limit ASS, but not what you wanted.</p><p>Hope that helps.
