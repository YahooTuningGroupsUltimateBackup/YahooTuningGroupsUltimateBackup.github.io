It is my chosen profession<br/>to perform early music in intonation that is informed.  And we do disagree on<br/>several points.  (Thanks, Kraig!)</p><p>TD: While the piece probably sounds fine in extended meantone, I highly<br/>doubt that that was what Telemann expected on the keyboard; also that<br/>it would be appropriate for the bassoon to match the harpsichord<br/>intonation of every note. Usually the melody instrument should play<br/>mostly pure intervals above the bass.</p><p>JR: This is fairly nonsensical to me.  Firstly, every Baroque piece has a<br/>harpsichord or other keyboard instrument (except the obvious exceptions).<br/>I disagree that a player should feel the ability to intentionally match pitch<br/>to each and every note of the requisite keyboard is undesirable.  It is par<br/>for the course for a flexible instrument to match pitch an inflexible one.</p><p>TD: The bass line should also be played by a viola da gamba or &apos;cello, to<br/>make up the standard basso continuo group. Telemann didn&apos;t write for<br/>bassoon &amp; harpsichord, he wrote for bassoon &amp; continuo.</p><p>JR: I guess challenging the &quot;standard&quot; is a recurrent theme for me.  But in this<br/>case, because of the lower tessitura of the solo instrument, it was felt that the<br/>balance would be off with a second bass instrument, and basically unnecessary.</p><p>TD: Telemann&apos;s 55-system was explained near the end of his life, and he<br/>called it a *new* system. We can hardly believe that most of his music<br/>had been written for a system which he had not yet invented and which<br/>no-one knew about yet.</p><p>JR: Telemann wrote of an extended sixth comma meantone that could both explain<br/>his music while charting a course for future composers (perhaps most notably, Mozart).<br/>I don&apos;t feel you respect Telemann enough or you would never believe that Telemann was<br/>merely writing for a future that he would not be a part.  The reasons he never mentioned<br/>the fully closed system of 55-tone ET is because he was practical enough to avoid the most<br/>obscure intervallic relations.</p><p>TD: Clearly it was also not a keyboard tuning -<br/>rather it was a system for singers and instrumentalists.</p><p>JR: This is silly.  Everything was involved with a keyboard in the Baroque, everything.<br/>One can&apos;t segregate the other instruments out.  The repertoire does not permit it.  And to<br/>rationalize an intentional playing out of tune to the keyboard is, or to consider it<br/>acceptable and expected, leads me to a simple question for you; does the music itself count<br/>for anything?  I think  you haven&apos;t availed yourself that the wisdom produced by<br/>performance yields.</p><p>TD:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/telemann.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/telemann.html</a></p><p>JR: Thanks for that.  Coincidentally, Manuel got his copy of the Telemann from me soon after I<br/>found a copy in old East Berlin.  We were together in Rotterdam and I simply pulled it out of a<br/>collection of old books.  Spooky, since we had just talked about it.</p><p>TD: A keyboard player would have found it most convenient to use a tuning<br/>which would work in *all* commonly used keys, not just one or two. A<br/>circular, modified 1/6 comma meantone (similar to temperament<br/>ordinaire) would fit the bill quite well for tonalities ranging from<br/>four flats to four sharps, and would also produce interesting<br/>differences in intonation between different keys.</p><p>JR: Again, sorry, to me, silly.  No way Jose would I disregard a composer&apos;s own<br/>intonation scheme - regardless at what time it was described in the composer&apos;s<br/>life - for a modern imposition that looks like it works.  It&apos;s just not possible<br/>for me.  When info exist of a primary nature, as it does with Telemann, go for it.<br/>Tom, it&apos;s not like the area of performance has been explored much.</p><p>TD: Werckmeister described a similar sort of tuning in his treatise on figured<br/>bass. Fminor would have a specially expressive character on the keyboard,because<br/>the Ab would be rather flat, though not as flat as G# in 1/6<br/>comma. Possibly the bassoon should take this into account and make Ab<br/>a little flatter than pure.</p><p>JR: Of course, we have discussed Werkmeister is some detail on the List.  However,<br/>I would not &quot;make&quot; Ab flat, it would simply be at the same pitch as that of the keyboard.</p><p>As it turns out, Saturday&apos;s AFMM concert also features W. F. Bach&apos;s &quot;Sonata for 2 harpsichords<br/>in F major&quot; and the harpsichordis with retune 2 pitches on the harpsichord during intermission.<br/>I have seen harpsichordist retune an entire harpsichord in Werckmeister III in 15 minutes, which<br/>is what is stated by Werckmeister himself, and is reputed of J.S. Bach.  2 pitches should be<br/>nothing at all.</p><p>TD: It might be interesting to see what notes actually come out of a<br/>Baroque bassoon (though of course there is a lot of leeway for taking<br/>them up and down by lip &amp; lung pressure) and whether Ab and G# usually<br/>had different fingerings.</p><p>JR: They did (Ab and G#) have different fingerings on the flutes made<br/>by Quantz for Frederick the Great.  On the bassoon, one can put get the<br/>Ab by using the low Eb key (#13) or the low D key (#9), which were<br/>available to Baroque players.  Actually, one can get any discrete pitch<br/>out of a bassoon, just like a trombone, or a cello.</p><p>TD: I can&apos;t see the 55-system making any sense at all as a keyboard tuning<br/>for Telemann&apos;s works - simply because he wrote in a large variety of<br/>keys which would make it extremely impractical to render each one in<br/>1/6 comma meantone. Suppose the harpsichordist was called upon to<br/>accompany a violin sonata in A major in the same program??</p><p>JR: See above.  Retuning a couple of notes is not difficult.  Especially<br/>in our concert because there is a second harpsichord already pretuned to<br/>the F major version, out of an extended sixth comma gamut of pitches.</p><p>TD: Retuning only makes practical sense if the number of strings to be<br/>retuned is very limited. Typically in the 17th century due to the<br/>limited range of modulation of most pieces only Eb/D# (possibly G#/Ab)<br/>would ever need to be touched. Of course if some kind of circular<br/>tuning is the norm there is no need to retune anything.</p><p>Sorry to throw cold water, but I think F minor *ought* to sound<br/>different from other keys.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>JR: I just wanted to give you feedback because it really is<br/>making a difference in a musician&apos;s understanding of how to play Telemann.</p><p>Some of us were remarking how Telemann doesn&apos;t seem to have a &quot;style&quot; set<br/>in the mind of the modern player (unlike JS Bach or Vivaldi or Handel).  Yet,<br/>Telemann was the champion composer of his time in popularity.<br/>However, when played in sixth comma meantone, likely the most popular<br/>German meantone of them all in the 18th century, there is genuine truth to tell,<br/>through the performance.</p><p>All best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=65721 href="#65721">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2006 12:45:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    Date: Wed, 22 Mar 2006 23:16:26 -0500<br/>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>&gt;Subject: Sixth Comma Meantone<br/>&gt;(...)<br/>&gt;I have seen harpsichordist retune an entire harpsichord in &gt;Werckmeister III in 15 minutes, which<br/>&gt;is what is stated by Werckmeister himself, and is reputed of J.S. &gt;Bach.  2 pitches should be<br/>&gt;nothing at all.</p><p>Let&apos;s clarify a few things on this.</p><p>- &quot;Werckmeister III&quot; is not a harpsichord temperament at all, but was rather specified by Werckmeister for organs.</p><p>- It&apos;s not reputed of JSB that he retuned an entire harpsichord in Werckmeister III in 15 minutes.  It&apos;s reputed that JSB tuned entire harpsichords in 15 minutes, with nothing said one way or the other about W-III *ever* in any of his practice.</p><p>- To tune an entire hpsi in 15 minutes is really not such a remarkable thing.  I do mine in under 10, as usual practice, and so do other harpsichordists of my acquaintance.  All by ear, starting from a single tuning fork.  One need only use a simple-enough system to set the basic bearing octave(s) in 3 or 4 minutes; and then copy unisons and octaves everywhere.  I can set up *any* of the systems I&apos;ve presented here<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/practical.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/practical.html</a><br/>in well under 15, and I don&apos;t consider that to be a terribly rare or noteworthy thing; just basic skill to be a serious harpsichordist.  Like any other crafty skill, it just takes training and practice and confidence to work up to that fluency.</p><p>- Some of my own practical remarks about 1/6 comma are here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/meantone.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/meantone.html</a></p><p>p.s.
