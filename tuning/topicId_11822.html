Of course, for such<br/>performers, _any_ precise mathematical model is just that, a guide<br/>rather than a literal and mechanical description of what is actually<br/>sung or played.</p><p>On a keyboard, my solution would be simple: meantone, for example<br/>1/4-comma, with as many notes per octave as necessary to include all<br/>the accidentals called for by a given piece.</p><p>Incidentally, Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone might be an attractive<br/>choice for some pieces in modes (Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian) featuring<br/>an arithmetic division of the fifth above the bass -- that is, with<br/>the minor third below and major third above. Lindley recommends it for<br/>some organ pieces by Andrea Gabrieli, and the same considerations<br/>might apply to comparable pieces by Giovanni Gabrieli also.</p><p>In analyzing a piece like _Sonata pian&apos; e forte_ -- and thanks,<br/>Patrick, for drawing my interest to this piece -- I might focus both<br/>on two-voice progressions and on multi-voice sonorities. While I don&apos;t<br/>seem specifically to associate bold seventh sonorities with this<br/>piece, I should take another look.</p><p>Apart from an interval such as the meantone augmented sixth (very<br/>close to 7:4), I would tend to take a minor seventh in this era as<br/>somewhere around 16:9 or 9:5.</p><p>Here I might just add that in determining &quot;consonance&quot; in the sense of<br/>aesthetic stability/instability or restfulness/tension, I find that<br/>categorical perception can often be more important than the abstract<br/>mathematical simplicity or complexity of an interval.</p><p>Thus in a 14th-century context (e.g. Machaut), either the usual 81:64<br/>or 5:4 is unstable because &quot;thirds are unstable intervals in this<br/>music&quot; -- and likewise either the usual meantone minor seventh midway<br/>between 16:9 and 9:5, or 7:4, in a 16th-century setting such as<br/>Gabrieli.</p><p>Interestingly, Vicentino finds the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; at ~11:9<br/>quite concordant, but either ~7:6 or ~7:4 on the dissonant side, the<br/>first leaning toward a major second and the latter toward a minor<br/>seventh, both regarded as clear dissonances in a 16th-century<br/>context.</p><p>Of course, I have my biases: I like _large_ integer ratios, for<br/>example, a commonplace in 3-limit or Pythagorean JI. This might<br/>influence my views on various issues, so maybe I&apos;m wise to put people<br/>on notice now and then of this proclivity.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
