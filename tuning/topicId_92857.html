I&apos;m actually really surprised, because I<br/>hear every single chord as &quot;minor&quot; as far as the usual definition of<br/>the word goes. I do hear the last ones as very otonal and fused, but I<br/>still hear them as retaining some kind of &quot;minor&quot; sound, presumably<br/>because of the minor third.</p><p>I have made one more example, but first I would like to clarify what I<br/>am asking in this case, as apparently I am prone to miscommunication<br/>with these examples :)</p><p>I am trying to study common practice harmony, specifically &quot;major&quot; and<br/>&quot;minor,&quot; to determine exactly what they are and how the (somewhat<br/>oversimplified) &quot;happy/sad&quot; feelings emerge from each triad. Although<br/>I recognize that there are plenty of other xenharmonic chords out<br/>there, for the purposes of this I&apos;d like to limit this example only to<br/>major/minor triads, a la common practice harmony. Although I recognize<br/>that major chords aren&apos;t really &quot;happy,&quot; and minor chords aren&apos;t<br/>really &quot;sad,&quot; for the purposes of this discussion I&apos;m going to use<br/>those words, because those are the only words that I know how to use<br/>in this case.</p><p>A dominant seventh chord, a major sixth chord, and a major seventh<br/>chord all have different moods and feelings, but they still sound like<br/>diverging members of the &quot;major&quot; family. What sounds radically<br/>different from these are minor seventh chords, minor sixth chords, and<br/>minor/major 7 chords. These sound like diverging members of the<br/>&quot;minor&quot; family. What they have in common is that they have a minor<br/>triad at the bottom with an extension on top further defining the<br/>sound, as do the major family ones with the major triad. And the minor<br/>triad ones all sound like different variations on the theme of<br/>&quot;sadness&quot; when played in isolation, although sometimes you can get<br/>them to sound differently (m7 chords especially).</p><p>Carl threw out the idea that the sadness of the minor chord inherently<br/>comes from its properties of being nontonal yet not rough, making it<br/>stable in one way but not in another, which somehow leads to sadness.<br/>So for these examples, to test this theory, I have played a 5-limit<br/>just minor triad and added some xenharmonic extensions on top, which<br/>are otonal extensions of 1/1. This makes the chord sound very tonal<br/>and rooted, but still to me sounding like a member of the &quot;minor&quot;<br/>family in the same way that minor 6, minor 7, and minor/maj7 chords<br/>are. In my world they all share the same characteristic &quot;minor&quot;<br/>feeling.</p><p>So here&apos;s the new example: I took the last two chords from the old<br/>example, which everyone said sounded the most &quot;otonal.&quot; I took them<br/>and replaced the 6/5 in each example with 5/4, which makes them sound<br/>more &quot;major&quot; to me in the sense that I defined it above. Then I flip<br/>back between 5/4 and 6/5 a few times, ending on 6/5.</p><p>Your job is to tell me if you hear the chords as flipping back and<br/>forth between &quot;major with some xenharmonic extensions&quot; and &quot;minor with<br/>some xenharmonic extensions,&quot; or if you hear them as major both times.<br/>Or, in the second case, if you hear them as flipping back and forth<br/>between &quot;one huge 15-limit otonality&quot; and &quot;one huge 15-limit otonality<br/>pointing to a minor chord&quot;, or something to that effect.</p><p>And now, the link:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/majminxenharmonic.mp3">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/majminxenharmonic.mp3</a></p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Wed, Sep 15, 2010 at 6:38 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello friends, countrymen,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I decided to one more listening test.

So there has to be some set of words I can<br/>use...</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to hear your impressions of my second example.</p><p>&gt; As an aside: regardless of how &quot;tonal&quot; a 4:5:6:7 chord is, I&apos;ve never been able to hear it as resolved, i.e. as the final chord in a cadence. Are there any non-blues/non-jazz musical examples out there that resolve to it? And definitely FWIW, a 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 chord does nothing for me emotionally. I hear it as just noise. It means nothing to my ears.</p><p>Does motown count?</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdvITn5cAVc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdvITn5cAVc</a></p><p>&gt; It is interesting that when it comes to &quot;major&quot; intervals, the Maj2&apos;s, Maj3&apos;s, and Maj6&apos;s all sound &quot;happy&quot; to me, i.e. distinctly &quot;majory&quot;, but Maj7&apos;s definitely have a sadness to them. I wonder from whence this phenomenon arises? Could it be because the Maj7 is the only Major interval with a higher H.E. than its Minor counterpart?</p><p>From whence, you say? I&apos;m not sure, but maj9#11 chords sound even<br/>happier and sadder, they&apos;re so happy that they&apos;re cathartically sad.<br/>This is the characteristic of the lydian mode.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 9:26:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Sep 16, 2010 at 12:24 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Thu, Sep 16, 2010 at 12:12 AM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:igliashon@sbcglobal.net">igliashon@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; As an aside: regardless of how &quot;tonal&quot; a 4:5:6:7 chord is, I&apos;ve never been able to hear it as resolved, i.e. as the final chord in a cadence.

Compared to 12-tet, the bottom<br/>two intervals sound a bit &quot;warmer&quot; or &quot;darker,&quot; similar to 19-tet&apos;s<br/>major thirds, but the top one is much &quot;brighter.&quot; I don&apos;t hear a<br/>major/minor distinction from it, but I do from 7:9:11 and its utonal<br/>inversion and from 9:11:13 and its utonal inversion, although I don&apos;t<br/>know how to tell that from placebo anymore...

But I think in light of this it needs to be<br/>modified; the presence of tonalness doesn&apos;t destroy minorness, but<br/>perhaps the creation of polytonalness can create it, or at least a<br/>generalized version of it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 10:40:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Much of my output for starters.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Can you link me to a few representative pieces?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 2:10:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As an aside: regardless of how &quot;tonal&quot; a 4:5:6:7 chord is, I&apos;ve never been able to hear it as resolved, i.e. as the final chord in a cadence.
