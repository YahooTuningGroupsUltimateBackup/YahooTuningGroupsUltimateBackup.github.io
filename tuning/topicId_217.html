At least as far as unmangling it. With<br/>&gt;regard to the Scalatron. You know.</p><p>I got out my copy of the poster, and the quote is not on it.  However, I do<br/>seem to remember a quote like the one Pat describes in connection with the<br/>poster, maybe on a seperate sheet.  It might have been the scalatron quote...</p><p>&gt;Did you get the VAIO?</p><p>No.  Went for the custom desktop, like you did.  Would now buy Portege<br/>instead of VAIO.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
