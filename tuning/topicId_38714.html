I have studied and played classical guitar for over 35<br/>&gt; years -- never even thought about tuning the guitar any differently than I<br/>&gt; learned way back when. And I&apos;m a piano tech!?!?!?!?!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to have a little fun experimenting with your ideas and will<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for responding.  I got the very same response when I talked about the<br/>tuning of an authentic Cajun accordion I bought from a Cajun French speaking<br/>maker in Louisiana.  I asked him how it was tuned which he explained he had<br/>learned was an &quot;old German system&quot; and had never questioned why, he just did<br/>it that way, afraid ever to try anything else.  Another RPT of that area and<br/>culture told me that he too, never questioned or even thought about the way<br/>his instrument was tuned.</p><p>According to the maker of my accordion, which is a button style, diatonic<br/>variety, the same as a harmonica, it only plays the 7 notes in a C major<br/>scale of which some are &quot;push&quot; (closing the bellows) and some are &quot;pull&quot;<br/>(opening the bellows).  There is absolutely no requirement or reason to<br/>temper anything.  All intervals could be made to be pure if desired.  The<br/>maker uses a Peterson Strobe Tuner and tunes each note to 0 deviation except<br/>the notes E and B which are tuned at -15 cents.  He says he also sometimes<br/>tunes the F at +15 cents.  He said he did understand that the reason for<br/>doing this was to make the 3rds be &quot;pure&quot;.</p><p>What this obviously does is not make the chord &quot;pure&quot;, the 5th is still<br/>tempered by 2 cents and the 3rd is actually narrow by 1.4 cents although that<br/>is too little tempering to create an audible beat.  I reasoned that I could<br/>make my 5ths pure and my 3rds really pure if I wanted to but I decided to<br/>take the idea even further.  I *widened* the 5ths by 2 cents and made the<br/>3rds 1.6 cents wide (still an imperceptible beat).</p><p>This gave the accordion a big, bold sound.  It still has the same basic<br/>character it is supposed to have but when compared to another identical<br/>accordion tuned in the maker&apos;s usual way, the latter sounds flat and out of<br/>tune.  Many people accept what they believe is inevitable, that such an<br/>accordion cannot really be tuned the way a piano cannot and for the same<br/>reason.  It just isn&apos;t so.</p><p>I got the maker to understand a little of why I had him tune my accordion<br/>this way.  He now tunes the E and B at -12 cents and the F at +12 but he<br/>never could understand what I did with the 5ths and really believes that you<br/>couldn&apos;t do anything but tune the rest of the notes to what the Strobe Tuner<br/>says is &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>Bill Bremmer RPT<br/>Madison, Wisconsin<br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.billbremmer.com/">http://www.billbremmer.com/</a>&quot;&gt;Click here: -=w w w . b i l l b r e m m e r . c o m =-&lt;/A&gt;</p></div>
