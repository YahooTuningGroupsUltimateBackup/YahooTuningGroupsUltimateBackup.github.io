Meanwhile, I&apos;ve stood up in the name of<br/>  defending free expression against accusations of &quot;nonsense&quot; or worse,<br/>  no matter what the ideological or philosophical bent, and angered<br/>  some of my best friends here in doing so, including very recently. So<br/>  excuse me if everything you&apos;re saying to me seems completely<br/>  backwards right now. I&apos;d like to get a better understanding of what<br/>  it is you&apos;re saying so that I can attempt to take remedial action<br/>  right away -- if I can make things better toward the ends we both<br/>  value, I&apos;d love to do so right away.</p></div>
