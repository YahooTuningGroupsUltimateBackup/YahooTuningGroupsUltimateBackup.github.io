But one only lives once, and my mom said<br/>to try to help people in trouble, so.......</p><p>Joseph Perhson said (in a desperate tone):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s get REALLY simplistic for a moment.  Therefore the chart would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F--C--G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IV--I--V<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, the &quot;secondary functions&quot; of an extended series of fifths would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F--C--G--D--A--E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IV--I--V--IV (implied) -- IV (implied) -- IV (implied)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It looks a little &quot;lopsided&quot; to me...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, what about all the fifths on the &quot;other side&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb, Eb, Ab, etc?? [I guess those fourthy subdomiant ones are pretty &quot;cool&quot;<br/>&gt; rock progressions...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do we get, many thanks to Pythagoras:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ab--Eb--Bb--F--C--G--D--A--E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IV (implied)--IV (implied)--IV(implied)--IV (the &quot;real one&quot;)--I (thank<br/>&gt; god)--V (whoopee)--IV (implied, you &quot;gotta believe&quot;)-- IV (implied) -- IV<br/>&gt; (implied)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Man, I&apos;m sure glad I&apos;m not a V.  I&apos;d get &quot;whalloped&quot; by all the &quot;betas...!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any case, if this is the Riemann system, I would rather opt for the<br/>&gt; Forte which, as we have shown is quite a bit different.  Just for<br/>&gt; reference, here it is again.  (I hope the server can store it...)</p><p>As I see it, there are two principles at work here. One is the tendency of a<br/>chord root to move to one a fifth below (probably stemming from the<br/>Pythagorean picture of a string of fifths). The other is the idea that the<br/>tonic root (and chord) is flanked on &quot;either side&quot; by a root (and chord) a<br/>fifth above (V) and another root (and chord) a fifth below (IV).</p><p>A practical simplified view of the latter (in major mode) is:</p><p>Tonic harmony: I, vi, and sometimes iii<br/>Dominant harmony: V, vii, and sometimes iii6<br/>Subdominant harmony: IV and ii</p><p>Think of ii, iii, and vi as little &quot;relative minors&quot; of IV, V and I<br/>(respectively). Going from a primary to a secondary is cool, but not the<br/>reverse. Any subdominant chord can be &quot;preparation&quot; for dominant but is not<br/>obliged to go there. Any dominant chord is obliged to go to a tonic chord,<br/>but does not go to a subdominant chord unless it returns to dominant before<br/>going to tonic.</p><p>Minor mode is similar but has some limitations because of weirdness in<br/>adjusted scale steps.</p><p>I know this is cursory, but I really don&apos;t want to sit here and rewrite my<br/>book. At the risk of appearing commercial, further clarifications are<br/>available in &quot;The Sounds of Music: Perception and Notation.&quot; If interested,<br/>try your local Borders or Barnes and Noble, or if you can wait for the mail,<br/>try <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://Bookzone.com">Bookzone.com</a>.
