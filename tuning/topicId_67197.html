This is one of the major points of the article.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s somewhat misleading because, if 5-limit triads are<br/>&gt;our consonances, and we&apos;re using octave-equivalence, the<br/>&gt;biggest interval we can cut is the 4th.

Voice leadings between tritone-related triads are found throughout the entire tonal corpus, for instance in the resolution of the Neapolitan sixth to the dominant.</p><p>Now you&apos;re quite right that triads are very special because all of them can be connected by very efficient voice leading.  By contrast clusters such as {C, C#, D} and {F, F#, G} cannot always be connected by efficient voice leading.  The whole point of my article is to explain which properties of the harmonies allow for the voice leading.</p><p>In the triads&apos; case, the fact that they divide the octave nearly evenly allows you to find efficient voice leadings between any two transpositionally-related chords.  In the case of the clusters, the fact that they divide the octave unevenly allows you to find efficient voice leadings between the chord and itself.</p><p>&gt;Furthermore, there&apos;s no psychoacoustic basis for &quot;inversion&quot;<br/>&gt;being audible without extensive training (even in its<br/>&gt;original context, applied to melodies).  Try it on chords<br/>&gt;bigger than a triad (an 11-limit hexad, for example) and see<br/>&gt;if it still produces &quot;fairly similar&quot; -sounding chords.</p><p>First of all, major and minor triads sound audibly more similar to each other than either does to, say, the fourth chord C-F-G or the augmented triad C-E-G#.  You can easily elicit such similarity judgments from listeners without extensive training.</p><p>Second of all, music theory does several things.  Modelling listeners&apos; perceptions is one of them.  Modelling composers&apos; conceptions is another.  The fact is, that in many musical styles, major and minor triads were thought to be similar -- they were the two consonant triads.
