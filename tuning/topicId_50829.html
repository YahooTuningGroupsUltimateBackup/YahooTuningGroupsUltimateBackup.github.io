In any case, since we give the same name to the related linear<br/>temperaments in various prime limits, and deal as needed with their<br/>bufurcation into more than one version as we go up limit, it seems to<br/>me we could call 225/224-planar 7-limit Marvel and keep the same name<br/>for 11-limit Marvel. When tempering out 225/224, it very often happens<br/>that tempering out 385/384 makes sense; 11-limit Marvel has the same<br/>generators (slightly flat fifths and thirds) as 7-limit Marvel and<br/>they do seem a lot like two versions of the same temperament. The<br/>other marvelous temperament of interest in the 11-limit would be<br/>{225/224, 441/440}-planar, which I called Portent; this could be<br/>considered another 11-limit version of Marvel, just as we have two<br/>good 11-limit versions of septimal meantone, etc.</p><p>The minimax tuning for 11-limit Marvel has the fifths and 11s flat by<br/>(4125/4096)^(1/9) and the major thirds flat by twice that amount; the<br/>9/5s, 11/5s, and 11/9s are pure. (The 7s are flat by<br/>(41503/41472)^(1/3).)</p><p>By way of comparison, here is dualhex in 11-limit Marvel:</p><p>! dhexmarv.scl<br/>Dualhex in 11-limit minimax Marvel ({225/224, 385/384}-planar)<br/>12<br/>!<br/>115.802647<br/>151.994179<br/>267.796826<br/>383.599473<br/>468.992587<br/>535.593652<br/>700.597880<br/>767.198946<br/>852.592059<br/>968.394706<br/>1084.197353<br/>1200.000000</p></div>
