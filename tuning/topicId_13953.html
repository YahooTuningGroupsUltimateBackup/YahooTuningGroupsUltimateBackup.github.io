I guess I ASSUMED that the port would open automatically...</p><p>Sorry about that!</p><p>&gt;That&apos;s why I could never hear the keyboard, and I didn&apos;t know that I<br/>&gt;could &quot;audition&quot; Scala files.</p><p>&gt;Well, you might want to make that an automatic function... because<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not entirely convinced that I&apos;m more confused than the average<br/>&gt;bear... although it&apos;s quite possible.</p><p>Thanks, that&apos;s a help.</p><p>You will prob. want to tick<br/>In | Options | Open for MIDI output when a MIDI in note is played</p><p>I&apos;ll make sure this is ticked by default for next beta, and also prob. give<br/>a message if one unticks it &quot;Confirm, untick ...&quot;.</p><p>Or maybe just remove it. Right now, I can&apos;t think why one would want to<br/>untick it...</p><p>It will only open MIDI out in response to actual notes played, ignores<br/>everything else including active sense messages.</p><p>Enjoyed my visit to the fractal Bach variations page.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
