But here goes .......</p><p>There are three concepts involved: concept of shruti, of &quot;rasa&quot;, and<br/>of experiencing.</p><p>1. SHRUTI: The number of shruti-s is infinite, but is 22<br/>mathematically. So, we are attempting to reduce the timeless to the<br/>time-bound. Indian musicians -- and other &quot;ethnic&quot; musicians --<br/>intuitionally use shruti-s constantly without intelectual recognition.<br/>Knowing this, we still can take the shruti concept to the lab. for<br/>objective study -- to an extent.</p><p>2. RASA: Rasa is the key concept of Classical Indian Aesthetics. It is<br/>variously translated as taste, flavor, pleasure, savor, relish,<br/>emotive aesthetics, &quot;contemplative enjoyment of &grave;universalized&apos;<br/>emotion&quot;, emotional flavor, sentiment, etc.</p><p>Rasa is not the psychological result that a musical performance<br/>induces in the listener, but it is, at once, rather, the inner source<br/>as well as the meaning of the aesthetic creation. It is not simply a<br/>&apos;subjective&apos; psychological response on the part of the experiencer of<br/>rasa, to the &apos;objective&apos; expression of a raga. Rasa is fundamental,<br/>universalized, aesthetically rapturous experience. Rasa can be<br/>experienced only when the experiencer is absent.</p><p>Even when referring to emotions (which are not &quot;rasa-s&quot;), music does<br/>not cover as wide a range of emotions as, say, the theater. For<br/>example, no musical features of a raga would invoke laughter (hasya),<br/>disgust (jugupsa) or fear (bhayanaka). On the other hand, every raga<br/>evokes its own aesthetically expressive experience. [These are the<br/>three of the nine emotions mentioned in dramaturgy.]</p><p>The classification of shruti-s into five classes needs to be examined<br/>in the light of all this. As far as I know, the Indian<br/>musicians/musicologists have yet to do that.</p><p>3. The EXPERIENCING: The rasa, the ecstacy, which literally means &quot;to<br/>be outside oneself&quot;, is universalized, though its interpretation is<br/>personalized. Also, it is often difficult to tell if and when the<br/>experience is purely musical or purely spiritual. Some of us may not<br/>even recognize that a musical experience can have anything to do with<br/>spirituality.</p><p>You also wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, could you confidently assign different inflections<br/>of Re, such as Re ati komal or Re tivra, to one or the other of these<br/>classes? Or perhaps I have misunderstood how to apply the<br/>classification ... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>My answer is Yes and No. Yes, assigning different inflections is<br/>possible. No, the notes csannot be classified in terms of the five<br/>categories mentioned earlier.</p><p>I am sorry for the confusion my response may cause, but I cannot do<br/>better than this.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=58483 href="#58483">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2005 1:31:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Haresh,</p><p>Thank you for your answer.

As intervals, they are not equal.<br/>(ii) Can shruti-s be notes? Yes, any shruti can be a note, depending<br/>upon which of the 22 shruti-s is the reference (Sa, the tonic, the key).</p><p>The concept of &grave;taal&apos; has no relevance here.</p><p>The Problem:</p><p>(1) We have been examining the context of shruti-s ONLY in terms of<br/>octave-doubling.</p><p>(2)I have often taken this up with Paul on as well as off the List.

The<br/>implications of this could certainly change our understanding of shruti-s.<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>I vaguely recall reading, during the late sixties, in Ravi Shankar&apos;s book,<br/>about the effects of using the lower and upper octaves, and how the<br/>amopunt of time spent in each octave was one of those things largely<br/>governed by the raga.  For example, raga X might never use the second<br/>octave, while raga Y would use the second octave, but only near the<br/>climax of the performance and this should not exceed one-quarter of<br/>the total performance length.  If it wasn&apos;t Shankar, it may have been<br/>another author available then.</p><p>At any rate, there was no recognition that the melodic relation between,<br/>say Sa and Ga in the lower octave differed _in kind_ from that between<br/>the same two sruti in the upper octave.  This I found rather puzzling, since<br/>what is objectively twice the frequency difference is always perceived by<br/>human ears as a somewhat _smaller_ frequency difference - despite the<br/>greater difficulty for human voices in achieving the higher leap.  I had<br/>thought that classical Indian practice and theory would be more sensitive<br/>to those differences than were classical Western practice and theory;<br/>but was disappointed.</p><p>At the same time, different &quot;colours&quot; were attributed to the sruti of<br/>the same name in the different octaves eg Sa and Sa&apos;.  How this could be<br/>so without affecting the quality of the melodic leap was (and is) beyond<br/>my understanding.</p><p>Still, I&apos;m not sure what your problem is.  Certainly Indian practice uses<br/>the different octaves expressively and in fairly predictable ways.  Could<br/>the absence of a word for the octave interval in the classical texts merely<br/>have been a way of reinforcing the essential unity perceived for, say, Sa<br/>and Sa&apos; ?  That is, another way of saying that there were only seven<br/>really distinct scale degrees, the gamut or saptaka?  (Seven notes in<br/>sampurna ragam, of course; otherwise fewer.)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.11.5 - Release Date: 4/5/05</p></div><h3><a id=58526 href="#58526">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2005 5:53:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Yahya, thanks for your response. In the folowing lines I have<br/>attempted to make my confusion a little clear.</p><p>The Problem:<br/>A peculiar uneasiness exists in my thinking regarding the fact that<br/>there were only very few notes in the Indian gamut in ancient times.<br/>Since this is known as a fact, there existed no need</p><p>for octave doubling<br/>for cents<br/>for 5-limit JI per se.</p><p>Also, ancient texts express distances of 9 sruti-s and 13 shruti-s as<br/>as consonant, but they cannot be spoken of as ratio 4/3 and  ratio<br/>3/2,respectively, unless octave doubling is explicitly accepted and<br/>expressed as 2:1 for 22-shruti distance in those texts.</p><p>Therefore, the only way to express the relationship among those three<br/>(or four or at the most five) notes was through shadja-pancham-bhaava<br/>(Sa-Pa or the fifth relationship.)</p><p>If octave doubling was not accepted then -- and so if we do not accept<br/>it now --, C4 does not need to have 1:2 relationship with C5 (for<br/>example.)</p><p>Another fact of great import is that Bharata (in his work in 2 A.D.)<br/>describes a demonstration on two vina-s, each equipped with seven<br/>strings, and tuned exactly alike. He requires the experimenter to<br/>incrementally lower the strings of the second vina, in relation to<br/>those of the first vina, very exactly, but by using his acute sense of<br/>correct pitch. It cannot be emphasized enough that this is an exercise<br/>in acuteness of judging the pitch.-- it is not an exercise to fix the<br/>length of the vibrating string for a particular shruti. This is a fact<br/>of great import, seldom mentioned.</p><p>Further, if the tuning involved only Sa-Pa (the fifth) relationship,<br/>then C5 would overshoot 2:1 with C4 by 23.5 &cent; (not that we could have<br/> used cents then!). But this would not matter, because the septave<br/>stopped at Ni (B). Thus, C4 to B4 formed the septave and C5 never<br/>entered the scene.</p><p>In the early history, consonance was additive: 9 shruti-s + 13<br/>shruti-s = 22 shruti-s. No ratios, no frequencies, no cents, no<br/>explicit recognition of octave doubling as 2:1. How can the current<br/>picture about shruti-s -- their nature, number, and distances -- be<br/>derived authentically?</p><p>If I sound confused, I am! But I have done some loud thinking with the<br/>hope of gleaning some clarification.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=58527 href="#58527">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2005 7:07:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Haresh,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt; The Problem:<br/>&gt; A peculiar uneasiness exists in my thinking regarding the fact that<br/>&gt; there were only very few notes in the Indian gamut in ancient times.<br/>&gt; Since this is known as a fact, there existed no need ... for octave<br/>&gt; doubling<br/>  ...<br/>&gt; In the early history, consonance was additive: 9 shruti-s + 13<br/>&gt; shruti-s = 22 shruti-s.

How can the current<br/>&gt; picture about shruti-s -- their nature, number, and distances -- be<br/>&gt; derived authentically?</p><p>The writings are very ancient indeed!  When Bharata wrote, 2000<br/>years ago, the system of 22 srutis was already established in practice.<br/>It is my view that Bharata prescribed nothing new, but recorded the<br/>actual practice of musicians.  That is, that he was a historian, and<br/>not, primarily, a theoretician.</p><p>The period in which there were fewer (mostly five) notes in the gamut<br/>would seem to be 500 or 600 years earlier than Bharata.  The ragas<br/>are now classified, very broadly, by how &quot;complete&quot; - sampurna - the<br/>gamut is.  Only newer ragas are complete, that is, heptatonic; older<br/>ones have either five or six notes only.  Interestingly, this development<br/>from a pentatonic to a heptatonic gamut was paralleled elsewhere,<br/>notably in China.  In all cases, it seems to have taken a long time.<br/>Many cultures have established pentatonic scales, but few have gone<br/>on to use a heptatonic gamut.</p><p>You ask:<br/>&gt; .... How can the current picture about shruti-s -- their<br/>&gt; nature, number, and distances -- be derived authentically?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure that it can, that is, by incontrovertible scientific<br/>methods, unless we discover appropriate physical proofs.  The best<br/>such evidence we have for ancient tunings is the remarkably ancient<br/>(11,000+ years BCE) bone flutes found in China.</p><p>Still, I place a lot more faith in the accuracy of oral tradition than<br/>do scientists.  Modern man is unfairly prejudiced against knowledge<br/>that is not written down.  Just because we can&apos;t remember what we<br/>said yesterday, unless we write it down, is no proof that others<br/>could not!  And in the past, and even in preliterate societies today,<br/>the r&iuml;&iquest;&half;le of memory as a store and transmitter of knowledge was,<br/>and is, paramount.</p><p>In the absence of suitably ancient instruments from India, the best<br/>guide we have to ancient practice is surely the living traditions of<br/>Indian music?</p><p>That people spoke of 9 + 13 srutis creating a gamut of 22, rather<br/>than of 4/3 x 3/2 being equivalent to 2/1, was not a failure of<br/>scientific method.  Rather, it was the result of creating a careful<br/>record of actual practice, as distinct from an attempt to explain<br/>that practice.  It wasn&apos;t wrong; it was an answer to a different<br/>question.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.11.6 - Release Date: 6/5/05</p></div>
