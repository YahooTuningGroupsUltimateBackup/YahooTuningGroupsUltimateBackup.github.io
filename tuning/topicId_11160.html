Ahem...  There&apos;s<br/>some &quot;room for improvement&quot; in the files, truly.</p><p>Actually, if you &quot;click back&quot; to the previous page after you get the<br/>page that states &quot;the file is not found&quot; and you click on the upload<br/>file path again, in MOST cases the file will load in and play properly.<br/>It takes a while, and, as I mentioned, it only works about half the<br/>time.</p><p>I admit this is not good enough.  I&apos;m going to try to convert the files<br/>to &quot;Realmedia&quot; and get some more info. from the web host in the<br/>meantime.</p><p>I&apos;ll keep you posted.  I suppose if everything fails, I can always just<br/>&quot;e-mail&quot; the files... but I don&apos;t want to declare defeat yet!!!</p><p>By the way, in my first attempts at figuring this out, I discovered<br/>&quot;Webmonkey.&quot;  No, don&apos;t laugh... this is a very useful tool and<br/>tutorial...  In fact, if you forget to haul around your HTML references,<br/>this is a good place to find them on-line... even the color charts!</p><p><a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/teachingtool/">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/teachingtool/</a></p><p>I figure since most eighth graders know HTML nowadays, it couldn&apos;t hurt<br/>to brush up a bit on it...</p><p>More if/when I get this solved!</p><p>______________ _____ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
