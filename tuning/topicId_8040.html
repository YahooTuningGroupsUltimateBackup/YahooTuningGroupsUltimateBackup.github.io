It&apos;s just that &quot;gsplay&quot; wasn&apos;t<br/>sending the sysex stuff to my TX81Z and the MIDI file method that Darren<br/>Burgess suggested DID work...</p><p>Regardless, as I&apos;m sure most (if not all) of you know -- this &quot;hookup&quot; with<br/>Scala and an synthesizer puts us in an entirely different compositional<br/>world.  It&apos;s a mini laboratory.  With performers these days so expensive<br/>and generally inaccurate in xenharmonics, I would think that many composers<br/>would turn (rather than resorting to minimalism or re-doing Prokofiev) to<br/>these new ways of tuning and making music.  What might be lost in sound<br/>quality with a synthesizer is certainly gained in accuracy -- and it&apos;s all<br/>CD-ready (!)</p><p>My greatest thanks to Mr. Op de Coul for making this all possible -- I<br/>think I&apos;m going to be living in this new world for quite some time!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
