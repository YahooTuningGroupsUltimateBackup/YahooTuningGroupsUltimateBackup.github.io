It was obvious there was some momentary &apos;spiciness&apos; in the Tallis I was listening to. It sounds a lot better with a choir than an mp3 piano. Harmony<br/>(whether consonant or dissonant) was a byproduct of melodies, leading tones came before Vmajor--&gt;I! So the &apos;augmented octaves&apos; is just a harmonic<br/>collision between the &apos;rising&apos; melody and the &apos;falling&apos; melody. The amount of spiciness may have a lot to do with how a choir tunes it. For a &quot;sharps are<br/>higher than flats&quot; kind of tuning, it will be a milder dissonance than a meantone.</p><p>Sorry if a signature gets attached to this, I&apos;ll try to work on that.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Intel Israel (74) Limited</p><p>This e-mail and any attachments may contain confidential material for<br/>the sole use of the intended recipient(s).
