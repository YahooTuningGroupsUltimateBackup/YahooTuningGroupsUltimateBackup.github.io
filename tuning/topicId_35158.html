I saw a msg there from me, but I didn&apos;t recall posting anything tonight. So, just so that you know, and we have a good understanding of the massive amounts of technology of this service...</p><p>...please note from the date on message 35157 that is was sent this past Monday, and is just now showing up, just shy of 5 days and 4 hours later.</p><p>Pretty damn impressive!
