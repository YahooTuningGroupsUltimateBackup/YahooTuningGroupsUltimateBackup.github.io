As far as I can tell, the only thing<br/>inherent in it, and the only reason it (or some approximation of it)<br/>remained in practice through the Medieval era, is that it can be built up<br/>from 4 fifths. When tuning 81/64 by itself, without reference to the<br/>intervening fifths, I can&apos;t discern any characteristics that distinguish it<br/>from its immediate neighbors. It was not considered a consonance in the<br/>Medieval era, so its tuning would have been determined by melodic factors,<br/>which would probably have kept it in the rough vicinity of 81/64, though<br/>Marchettus and others suggested that it was larger in certain progressions .<br/>. .</p><p>&gt;Consider, wouldn&apos;t there only be an octave and a half of range in the<br/>&gt;Pythagorean men&apos;s voices?</p><p>I&apos;ll let Margo answer that, but assuming you&apos;re right, major thirds at the<br/>top of the range would beat more than twice as fast as those in the bottom.</p><p>&gt;I suggest this.  So, if 16 beats per second make<br/>&gt;up thirds in a 3/2, then most other thirds (which will have smaller major<br/>&gt;thirds) will have less of a frequency than 16?</p><p>I&apos;m confused about your meaning. But a Pythagorean major third only beats 16<br/>times per second if the lower note is a modern middle C. That&apos;s near the top<br/>of my range. An octave lower, a Pythagorean major third beats 8 times per<br/>second. Wouldn&apos;t that fall into the category you described as &quot;egregious&quot;?<br/>Meanwhile, a 12-tET major third with the lower note at modern middle C beats<br/>10 times per second . . . and yet today everyone (people I&apos;ve talked to<br/>about it, Blackwood, me, etc.) seems to find the 12-tET major third more<br/>consonant than the Pythagorean major third, in any register . . . or shall<br/>we conduct more listening experiments?</p></div>
