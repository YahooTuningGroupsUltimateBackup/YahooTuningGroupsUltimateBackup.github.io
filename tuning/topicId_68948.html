After studying the question of Bach&apos;s tuning for about 30 years, it seems to be more of a psychological question.  There really is enough evidence, from my perspective, but we have different perspectives.</p><p>And please, take yourself off the hot seat, it is a general question, and it was asked of you because I wanted you to think about it.  All this talk about Bach is about thinking.  There is no smoking gun.  But I have picked up on some truisms, generalizations, some could even level the term prejudice, if not garden variety bias.</p><p>Neil, have you noticed any characterizations that are common to players of particular instruments.  As a contractor, one speaks differently in hiring, in explaining a gig, etc.  In high school we used to talk of having a &quot;horn for a head&quot; to describe a super hornist (now a famous pro).  When I wrote &quot;Phenomenology and Its Application to Microtonality&quot; it became clear that there were some psychological issues involved.</p><p>Some members of the List are bristling at these questions.  But they are real.  You had said you heard and played Bach exclusively in ET.  Have you ever heard any non-ET Bach?</p><p>best, Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
