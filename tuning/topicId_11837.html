Correct me if I&apos;m<br/>wrong: theoretically we could graph the total harmonic entropy measure<br/>against note values for a scale of cardinality n in n + 1 dimensions and<br/>have a smooth &quot;surface.&quot;  Then any value your algorithm arrives at must be<br/>a local minimum with repect to entropy.  Now my question would be: can we<br/>generalize about the positions of local minima or the general shape of the<br/>surface for cardinality n?  Your last set of imputs to the minimum-finding<br/>algorithm showed a large number of local minima in the region of 12-tET.<br/>If the graphs are this bumpy everywhere, then looking for minima tells us<br/>very little.  But maybe the graphs drop off in other regions, and we might<br/>find that, while in the region of 12t-ET, there are a number of minima,<br/>most other regions contain few minima, for instance.  Perhaps there is<br/>something to be seen by looking at the problem with a coarser resolution<br/>which would smooth out the smaller lumps in the graph.  I&apos;m thinking of<br/>something like having the algorithm consider the results of a step of 5<br/>cents in some direction, rather than of .01 (or whatever) cents.  Then you<br/>could see if any other regions of the graph are worth considering.  Also:<br/>can you find an absolute minimum given some number of tones?</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=11841 href="#11841">ðŸ”—</a>MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</h3><span>8/25/2000 8:35:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul&apos;s total diadic harmonic entropy minimizer is reminiscent of other<br/>methods in that it tries to maximise the number of consonant intervals<br/>in a scale:<br/>- Dave Keenan&apos;s comma distribution method. This method calculates<br/>precisely how big a part of a given comma needs to be added to which<br/>intervals in order to minimise the maximum deviation from a predefined<br/>set of consonant intervals.<br/>- Some time ago I wrote a new Scala routine which minimises the least<br/>squares deviation of scale intervals from a predefined set of consonant<br/>intervals. This routine first marks the intervals which are within a<br/>given distance from one of the consonant intervals and then calculates<br/>the optimal tempering for them. This has the advantage over Keenan&apos;s<br/>method that one doesn&apos;t need to tell which comma should be distributed<br/>(it can distribute more than one at the same time), but the result can<br/>be less precise and slightly less optimal than Keenan&apos;s method.<br/>The name of this routine is EGALIZE/MODEL, present in the next release.<br/>- Paul&apos;s entropy minimizer has the advantage that one doesn&apos;t need to<br/>specify the consonant intervals, since they are implied by the entropy<br/>curve. The disadvantage may be that it&apos;s likely to get stuck in local<br/>minima of what might be a very bumpy landscape.</p><p>By the way, when I feeded 12-tone equal temperament with one<br/>randomly changed tone to my least-squares method, it also produced a<br/>well-temperament.</p><p>Perhaps a combination of Paul&apos;s and my method would be useful. First<br/>run the entropy minimizer to get the basic scale structure, and after<br/>that run my method to fine-tune it.</p><p>Paul, the well-temperament that you found is close to Schlick (1511)<br/>and Lambert (1774).</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
