I came on harsh, and I&apos;m sorry.</p><p>That said, I AM a guitarist, like most, a poor sight reader. But I never latched on to tab. I can figure out a fingerring, (or a voicing), and I&apos;&apos;m a jazzer, I&apos;ll probably change them to suit me. But I need the information of the tune and the changes to start. I also need a reference for when I forget where I am (I no longer memorize as well as I once did). Unless I &quot;play as written&quot;, tab is no longer a useful reference.</p><p>My comment regarding scordatura is that I found in the past few weeks that tuning the guitar so that scales are 3/4 notes per string allowed<br/>me to play in positions (boxes) the same as playing in 12tet.</p><p>Example (I have 31 edo gtr, so it all goes there):</p><p>   31 edo - scale 55252552</p><p>Eb  60 62<br/>Ax  48 50 55<br/>F#  36 41 43<br/>Bbb 24 29 31<br/>Av  12 17 19<br/>E   0  5  10</p><p>Now this may make sense to me to figure out how to play the guitar, but it won&apos;t be a terribly useful reference for a pianist, or even for a guitarist with more, thinner fingers on their left hand.</p><p>Lead sheets used to have ukelele chord fingering diagrams on them. Imagine one wih those, and missing the changes. Band leader starts counting...</p><p>So all this discussion about how many lines, cents notation etc is<br/>very important. When I wrote a computer music program (12et), my notation was p#, p indicated a pitch and the appended number was a base 12 number (zero based of course, with 40 being middle C and 4b being the B above). It also had relative pitch indications like +p3,<br/>-p5 to indicate go up 3 12tet semitones, go down 5 12tet semi-tones.</p><p>Point is, even though the guitar IS a calculator, (next string is +p5 and down 2 frets is -p2, +p5-p2 = +p3, yep, a &quot;minor third&quot;), it is no more a universal musical calculator than slide position / lip pressure.</p><p>For performance, I can see the utility of cents, but I feel that is<br/>removing &apos;understanding&apos; from the performer, as &apos;col legno&apos; takes away<br/>what you might get if you just said &quot;wheezy staccato&quot;, and see what<br/>ANY instrumentalist will give you.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Bob,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your statement confuses me - it seems contradictory - can you expand?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot; Tablature falls very purely into &quot;how to do something&quot;.
