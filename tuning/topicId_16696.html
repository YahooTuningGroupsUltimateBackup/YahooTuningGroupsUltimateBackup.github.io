(Also known as the fruit stacking<br/>lattice).</p><p>I just realised that recently, and it became much clearer.</p><p>Suppose you&apos;ve just completed a layer, and want to add another orange.</p><p>You do that by placing it on top of three others, so it will complete a tetrahedron.<br/>Also once you&apos;ve added three oranges next to each other, they<br/>complete a tetrahedron with one of the previous oranges, this time<br/>with the point downwards.</p><p>So each new layer of oranges makes a series of tetrahedra.<br/>with the previous one, alternating between ones pointing<br/>upwards and ones pointing downwards:</p><p>Showing two layers (first layer shown with dashes):<br/>     1---------3---------9---------27<br/>    / \       / \       / \       /<br/>   /   \  7  /   \  21 /   \  63 /<br/>  /     \   /     \   /     \   /<br/> /       \ /       \ /       \ /<br/>5/3-------5--------15--------45<br/> \       / \       / \       /<br/>  \35/3 /   \  35 /   \ 105 /<br/>   \   /     \   /     \   /<br/>    \ /       \ /       \ /<br/>    25/3-------25-------125</p><p>(multiply by 3 horizontally, 5 diagonally down to right, and<br/>by 7 in the 1-&gt;7 direction, which is upwards out of the page)</p><p>Here, 1 3 5 7 is a tetrahedron pointing upwardds, and  7 35 35/3 5<br/>is one pointing downwards</p><p>However tetrahedra by themselves can&apos;t fill space, they need to alternate<br/>with octahedra, which fill the gaps between them. I.e. with hexanies.</p><p>We can see them here, for instance, 3 5 15 7 21 35 is our familiar<br/>3, 5, 7 hexany.</p><p>One can place each new layer of oranges in two ways.</p><p>However, one natural method to use is to place each new orange<br/>to fill the gap in the layer two layers below.</p><p>If you use that method, you end up with the 7-limit lattice.</p><p>Showing three layers:<br/>     1---------3---------9---------27<br/>    / \       / \       / \       /<br/>   /   \  7  /   \  21 /   \  63 /<br/>  /49/3 \   / 49  \   / 147 \   /<br/> /       \ /       \ /       \ /<br/>5/3-------5--------15--------45<br/> \       / \       / \       /<br/>  \35/3 /   \  35 /   \ 105 /<br/>   \   /245/3\   / 245 \   /<br/>    \ /       \ /       \ /<br/>    25/3-------25-------125</p><p>Here, 1, 7 and 49 lie on a straight line, so the idea is that the<br/>third layer is above the other two.</p><p>This way of arranging the oranges is known as the face centred<br/>cubic packing.</p><p><a href="http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/a1.html">http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/a1.html</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/17/2001 9:07:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18885">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18885</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if it may help to give a better picture of lattice diagrams<br/>&gt; to know that the 7-limit lattice is none other than the lattice<br/>green grocers use to stack oranges.

I was just getting momentarily confused<br/>about the 7-limit dimension with the spellings used...</p><p>It seems as though the VRML lattices are really the way to go!  I&apos;ve<br/>very much enjoyed your work with this so far!  The idea of rotating<br/>the lattices in VRML is really spectacular.</p><p>Maybe someday there should be a &quot;library&quot; of some &quot;common&quot; tuning<br/>lattices in VRML so that beginners and others trying to understand<br/>tuning could grasp them better.  I think it would be a valuable<br/>addition, and perhaps could link to Joe Monzo&apos;s or John Starrett&apos;s<br/>microtonal site.</p><p>Thanks again as ever!</p><p>_______ __ ______ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2001 12:58:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>Thanks Robert,</p><p>This is all true, but the convention for 7-limit tuning lattices is<br/>for a multiply by 5 to go _up_ to the right and a multiply by 7 to go<br/>_up_ to the right and out of the page.</p><p>Relative to this convention, you had up and down swapped in your<br/>examples.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2001 7:35:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Glad you&apos;ve enjoyed my VRML.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there will be more to come, and I&apos;m doing a few<br/>VRML experiments at the moment with the hope of eventually doing<br/>Christopher Bailey&apos;s trees, or something like them, in<br/>VRML.</p><p>This 7-limit fruit stacking lattice would be a nice one to do in VRML<br/>some time actually.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how comprehensive a library I&apos;d manage to do, but<br/>am interested to put a few of the models to date plus some new<br/>ones onto a web page some day, of course linking to the microtonal<br/>sites about lattices.</p><p>Probably a mixture of 2d gifs and image maps (like my<br/>2D octony projection) for the ones that can be done in 2D,<br/>then VRML for the ones that need to be done in 3D.</p><p>Meanwhile, main thing right now is to finish FTS 1.09,<br/>which is going pretty well.</p><p>Apologies for using up instead of down for those who are<br/>used to seeing the 7-limit lattice the other way up.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/17/2001 8:49:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18914">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18914</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure how comprehensive a library I&apos;d manage to do, but<br/>&gt; am interested to put a few of the models to date plus some new<br/>&gt; ones onto a web page some day, of course linking to the microtonal<br/>&gt; sites about lattices.</p><p>This would be a great asset for many of us trying to slowly learn<br/>this stuff!
