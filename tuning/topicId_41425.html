We saw repeatedly that people were having trouble downloading larger files (as most mp3s are) from the Yahoo! Groups file areas. I popped a few bucks for a cheap hosting service, designed a few basic pages, and allowed people to submit files.</p><p>The space is certainly not unlimited, so I keep track of how much is used and put files up in a FIFO order. That way if I have to make room for a new piece the oldest piece gets dumped.</p><p>Bear in mind that this is downloading only (which Joe P. doesn&apos;t like) - there is no streaming of mp3 files. I do believe that the only sites that can accomodate that are sites that have builtin mp3 streaming servers/software. I have not checked hosting services that offer this as an option to basic web hosting, but I imagine they exist. I also imagine that they are not free.</p><p>I&apos;m keeping the site for the members of that group, to share their work with fellow members of that group, and to discuss any of the work on the MMM list. If someone wants to do a similar site for the main tuning list, I&apos;ll be happy to give pointers. It is really not hard at all, especially compared to constructings lattices. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
