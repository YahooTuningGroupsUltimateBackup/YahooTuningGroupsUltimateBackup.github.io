The scale given above complies with the following relation:</p><p>[K^(10) R^(2) = 2</p><p>Since the Piagui scale variants work with K and P semitone factors, a similar relation is given below:</p><p>[K^(8) P^(4) = 2</p><p>The point is that (K^2) (R^2) = (P^4), hence:</p><p>  [K^(10) R^(2) = [K^(8) P^(4) = 2</p><p>Factors K and P were calculated in my book &quot;The Piagui Musical Scale: Perfecting Harmony&quot;, so what explained above proves that both K and P semitone factors are valid and useful musical constants.</p><p>Since a few weeks ago, about 11 files containing interesting information on the Piagui system were placed.<br/>I suggest you to take a look at them and see how the harmony of major and minor equal tempered and Piagui triads are shown as if they were photographed.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, August 04, 2009</p></div>
