Besides the 5 sharps and five flats there is also, if I<br/>recall correctly, a c-flat;  this would not fit on the keyboard she<br/>suggests, in meantone.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The piece can also work well in an unequal non-meantone<br/>temperament (with 12 keys to the octave) centered on G.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have also somewhere encountered speculation that it may have<br/>been conceived for viols.  The fact that it appeared copied onto 2<br/>staves in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book would not make this<br/>possibility at all improbable.</p><p>Actually, I wouldn&apos;t find the use of more than 12 pitch classes that<br/>unusual in either late medieval or Renaissance/Manneristic music, although<br/>it is true that many fit routinely within a &quot;standard&quot; range like<br/>Eb-G#;</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keyboard works of Byrd, Gibbons and other English composers<br/>regularly use a-flat and d-sharp as if these were nothing out of the<br/>ordinary.  If these notes are &apos;ordinary&apos;, might we speculate that<br/>the &apos;ordinary&apos; 12-note keyboards of the period could play them in a<br/>satisfactory tuning?</p><p>[...]<br/>Arnold Schlick (around 1511) thus is associated with some examples of<br/>organ music calling for both Ab and (in ornamented cadences) G#; these<br/>could be played on a &quot;semi-well-tempered&quot; instrument in Schlick&apos;s modified<br/>meantone, with some &quot;kludging&quot; of a single lever for a relatively<br/>tolerable Ab or a marginal G# -- or, of course, on an instrument with<br/>split keys.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as I know, no English instruments from the period of<br/>Byrd, Bull, Gibbons have been preserved with more than 12 keys /<br/>octave.  This does not make their existence at that time impossible,<br/>of course, only rather unlikely.</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Dale C. Carr</p></div><h3><a id=9835 href="#9835">ðŸ”—</a>Dale C.

The triad is<br/>complete, i.e. all 3 notes are present.  Later there&apos;s a complete<br/>a-flat major triad in 1st inversion.  The &apos;cadence&apos; of this entry is<br/>also an a-flat major chord, but without the e-flat.  The passgae<br/>also includes at least one d-flat major triad, a b-flat minor triad,<br/>an f-minor seventh triad (w/ e-flat).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Dale</p></div>
