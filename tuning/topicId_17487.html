I&apos;m hearing way too many folk recordings by modern groups<br/>&gt; whose interpretation is clean up folk music to western music standards. To<br/>&gt; my way of thinking, this tends to dumb down the music, the best folk music<br/>&gt; is not afraid to be edgy and raw.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is exactly my feeling when listenning to the great rural blues players<br/>and singers (Lightnin Hopkins, Robert Johnson, Big Bill Broonsy) and some<br/>of the more gritty urban blues artists (Howlin&apos; Wolf) compared to even the<br/>better of the contemporary players. The old cats didn&apos;t necessarily stay<br/>on a strict form, tune their instruments, agree on how much (or how little)<br/>swing on the eighth notes, and had systemic disagreements on what the chords<br/>were to certain sections (I mean systemic in that every time a certain point<br/>of the song comes up, the guitarist, and he alone, strums the IV chord in a<br/>sort of blurry polytonality).</p><p>But MAN does that stuff express. Music poured out of the soul.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, it&apos;s not that I think that<br/>&gt; every instrument playing this music needs to be tuned strictly JI, I love<br/>&gt; the tension created by the juxtaposition between JI thirds and sevenths in a<br/>&gt; voice, slide guitar or fiddle against the fixed 12 ET pitch of the guitar,<br/>&gt; banjo or piano.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes. In the musics I was mentioning you certainly have many simultaneous<br/>definitions for the thirds and sevenths. Maybe there is a groove or swing<br/>for tuning as there is for rhythm.</p><p>&gt; BTW, I offer my definition of folk to describe either traditional dance<br/>&gt; music and/or songs of a particular culture, as opposed to the common<br/>&gt; perception of folk these days as a singer/songwriter playing guitar.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking of &apos;World Music&apos; these days. I like the more traditional<br/>&apos;field recordings&apos;. Then I was listenning to a few recordings of U.S. bar<br/>bands and realized that these too were &apos;field recordings&apos;, with the field<br/>being the US. [The recordings were Jimmy Rivers and the Cherokees<br/>which was a great Honky-Tonk swing band in Texas, Danny Gatton live at a<br/>bar in D.C. and Eric Dolphy live at the 5 Spot, where absolute geniuses<br/>are playing for about twenty drinkning patrons].</p><p>&gt; Thanks for listening to my thoughts on this cold, windy day in New<br/>&gt; Hampshire.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, at least the weathers nice in Israel.</p><p>&gt; Seth<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bob</p></div>
