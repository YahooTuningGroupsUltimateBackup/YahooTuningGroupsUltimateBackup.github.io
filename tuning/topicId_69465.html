In common practice repertoire, both the dominant seventh and the various augmented sixth chord were dissonances which had to be resolved and, functionally, each resolved via a different voice leading. The seventh of the dominant seventh chord resolved downward, and the augmented sixth, in the augmented sixth chords, resolved upward.  Neither voice leading suggests a preference with regard to the tuning of the chord as a vertical sonority, whether more or less consonant, although dissonances in a given tuning environment are often the &quot;remainders&quot; or &quot;margins&quot; of that environment.  However, they may well suggest a preference for the melodic intonation of the leading tone, but that depends upon whether the aesthetic is one for larger (i.e. just or meantone) or smaller (i.e. pythagorean or circulating) leading tones. The historical evidence, as found within notated repertoire, does not uniformly support a JI interpretation of either sonority; indeed, treatment of the augmented sixth chord as a sustained, and thus presumably maximally consonant, sonority, must wait until mid-19th century repertoire (e.g. Liszt, Wagner) in which a 12tet intonational environment can usually be presumed (although Wagner, to his credit AFAIC, composed no important works for keyboard instruments).  With earlier, and presumably meantone, repertoire, we have the unfortunate case that the requirements shown in the notation and the more usual 12-note meantone schemes (Eb-G# or Ab to C#) rarely place the near 4:5:6:7 augmented sixth chord where one wants to have them.  Locating a consistent intonational treatment of either chord type is thus impossible.</p><p>Joe Monzo is right, I believe, to identify American vernacular, especially African-American, repertoire as one in which the seventh chord is treated as a basic, and consonant, sonority, and one not constrained by a voice leading resolution to a following chord.  One might also add that late 19th/early 20th century French repertoire and repertoire associated with the Skryiabinistes may well also be heard as treating the seventh chord and the augmented sixth chords as not functionally dissonant, that is, not requiring resolution.  But in all of these repertoires, we are confronted with the fact, that legitimate realizations were done in a 12tet environment.  I would here consider the possibility that we have a fundamental re-interpretation of the temperament, with the essential feature no longer being the tempering out of the syntonic comma, but rather the tempering out of the septimal comma. (It may be instructive that, precisely for this reason, a considerable amount of common practice music can be mapped to temperaments like 17, 19, 31, but 22, which like 12 tempers out the 64/63, might more usefully map some of this repertoire in  which the seventh chords are consonant).</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=69539 href="#69539">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 5:11:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lorenzo Frizzera&quot;<br/>&lt;lorenzo.frizzera@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think that a dominant chord is 4:5:6:7</p><p>I think it&apos;s better to call that a utonal tetrad.

One<br/>&gt; might also add that late 19th/early 20th century French<br/>&gt; repertoire and repertoire associated with the Skryiabinistes<br/>&gt; may well also be heard as treating the seventh chord and<br/>&gt; the augmented sixth chords as not functionally dissonant,<br/>&gt; that is, not requiring resolution.  But in all of these<br/>&gt; repertoires, we are confronted with the fact, that legitimate<br/>&gt; realizations were done in a 12tet environment.  I would<br/>&gt; here consider the possibility that we have a fundamental<br/>&gt; re-interpretation of the temperament, with the essential<br/>&gt; feature no longer being the tempering out of the syntonic<br/>&gt; comma, but rather the tempering out of the septimal comma.</p><p>Yes, you are absolutely correct in pointing out<br/>that some of the French repertoire since c.1885 also<br/>treats the 12-edo version of the &quot;dominant-7th&quot; chord<br/>as a consonance, something which i overlooked.</p><p>The earliest prominent examples of this which i know<br/>about are Chabrier&apos;s opera _Le roi malgr&eacute; lui_ (1887)<br/>and Satie&apos;s _Trois Sarabandes_ for piano, from the<br/>same year ... in fact the Satie pieces have strings of<br/>unresolved dominant-9th chords.</p><p>But as you reiterate, my point remains that this<br/>did not happen until 12-edo accepted as the context.<br/>In the 1/6-comma meantone context which i believe<br/>was the standard for Eurocentric orchestral playing,<br/>the dominant-7th chord always required resolution.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting to me, considering how closely<br/>the meantone augmented-6th chord resembles the JI<br/>4:5:7 sonority, is the way composers as early as<br/>Beethoven would &quot;sit&quot; on an unexpected augmented-6th<br/>chord at dramatic moments in their score, before<br/>resolving it.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=69556 href="#69556">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 10:59:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Billy Gard&quot; &lt;billygard@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In listening to all these &quot;official&quot; tunings, nothings beats the<br/>4:5:6:7,<br/>&gt; whether by this you are trying to depict the dominant 7th, German<br/>7th, Swiss<br/>&gt; 6th, Tritone substitution chord, or whatever.</p><p>You can substitute the otonal tetrad for a V7, but then you have this<br/>64/63 interval between 21/16 and 4/3 popping up.
