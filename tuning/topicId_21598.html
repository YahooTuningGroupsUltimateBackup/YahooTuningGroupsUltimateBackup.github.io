There<br/>are two such chains. Factors of 5, 7, 11, or 13 take you from one chain to<br/>the other.</p><p>In 68-tET (9-limit consistent), 17-tET acts as the Pythagorean chain. There<br/>are four such chains. Two equidistant ones give you 34-tET, which is 5-limit<br/>consistent, and factors of 7 give you the intervening two chains.</p></div>
