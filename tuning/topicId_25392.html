A high drone really does help.  For me,<br/>&gt; eliminating two of the notes, thereby making them pentatonic, helps<br/>&gt; even<br/>&gt; more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, does anybody know exactly who and what discredits<br/>&gt; Schlesinger&apos;s theory and where it can be found.  I&apos;m trying to set up<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; web site re her theory.  This topic has probably already been covered<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; this forum but I need a refresher.<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; Rick<br/>&gt;</p></div>
