Sterns does have an interesting<br/>point when he states that Ives intonational tuning might involve<br/>&quot;individual instances&quot; and not an &quot;overall paradigm.&quot;</p><p>In my earlier studies of Charles Ives, which I admit were a while ago and<br/>not certainly anywhere near as rigorous as yours are presently, Johnny R.,<br/>I do recall reading about these Ives tuning issues.</p><p>However, nowhere did Ives state that he was developing an &quot;overall<br/>paradigm&quot; or overall tuning system different from 12-tET.  Wouldn&apos;t one<br/>think that he would have more to say on an issue of such great importance<br/>as developing an entirely different system from the norm??  Just something<br/>to think about.</p><p>So, in other words, is Ives concerned about &quot;specific instances&quot; to improve<br/>his intonation or is he going for the &quot;overall?&quot;  Frankly, I&apos;m a bit<br/>unconvinced that Ives was trying to revolutionize overall tuning...</p><p>We need more evidence.  Shoot me now, Johnny!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p><p>[P.S. Congrats to Joe Monzo for trying to get to the bottom of some of the<br/>Ives scales in his most recent posts!]</p></div><h3><a id=6682 href="#6682">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/6/1999 7:17:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe, there is an &quot;acoustic plan&quot; announced by Ives and there is a lifetime of<br/>Charles Ives listening to unusual musical intervals.  Once again, let me<br/>state that Ives was a polymicrotonalist, so no one tuning is always active.</p><p>Ives scholar and former Society President, J. Peter Burkholder, wrote an<br/>essay emphasizing that there are 4 distinct styles for Ives, one of which is<br/>experimental.  These &quot;experimental&quot; works have been discussed specifically on<br/>the list, and it is to these particular works that Ives&apos;s prose on tuning<br/>applies.</p><p>There cannot, however, be a wishy-washing tuning model for Ives.  Peter<br/>Yates&apos;s interpretation begins to make more sense, wherein Ives evolved out of<br/>12TET in more ways than simply quartertones and eighthtones.</p><p>Why shouldn&apos;t Ives demand more of his music than anyone else could expect?<br/>Composers do indeed need to &quot;hear&quot; the notes that they are writing down.  By<br/>taking Ives at his word - and realizing it in performance - a new dimension<br/>opens up.  It is as if there are new dynamics rules, new ways for musical<br/>tones to rub up against each other, new structures to focus on.  What were<br/>dissonances on the piano are transformed by subtle tuning adjustments<br/>permitting now new, rich colors.</p><p>Ives was a bright man who regularly multi-tasked many things.  Why wouldn&apos;t<br/>he keep in his mind that people could barely understand him as it was?  It is<br/>completely unrealistic for Ives to do any more than he had to indicate his<br/>tuning preferences.</p><p>I do agree with Dan that it should be done on a case by case basis.  And of<br/>course, beginning with the so-called experimental pieces, newly recorded.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6685 href="#6685">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/1999 11:44:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt; There cannot, however, be a wishy-washing tuning model for Ives.</p><p>Not to be any more of a pain in the a-- than I already am, but I have<br/>to ask why not? If the confident navigation of ambiguity and wide<br/>ranging inclusiveness are hallmarks of Ives; rigor is not... and while<br/>&quot;wishy-washing&quot; wouldn&apos;t be what I&apos;d call his &quot;tuning model&quot; either,<br/>exactly (and rigorously) this, or exactly (and rigorously) that,<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to me to be the case either... I mean in the letter you<br/>posted about Babitz and Dahl&apos;s editing of the Third Violin Sonata he<br/>wrote (through Harmony):</p><p>&quot;it was mainly due to some acoustical plan--which he had in mind or<br/>was working out or trying to in those days&quot;</p><p>So I&apos;m curious why you say, &quot;there cannot.&quot;</p><p>&gt;It is completely unrealistic for Ives to do any more than he had to<br/>indicate his tuning preferences.</p><p>Again, I feel as though I have to ask why (is it completely<br/>unrealistic)? It is certainly not completely unrealistic to piece<br/>together an extended Pythagorean tuning scenario, but his own words<br/>say that &quot;which he had in mind or was working out or trying to&quot; (etc.,<br/>etc.). And this hardly seems (to me anyway) the sturdy stuff of a<br/>preferential tuning model, or (here in the present) the basis for<br/>building an unassailable analytical conviction... However, when you<br/>write stuff like: &quot;a new dimension opens up.  It is as if there are<br/>new dynamics rules, new ways for musical tones to rub up against each<br/>other, new structures to focus on.  What were dissonances on the piano<br/>are transformed by subtle tuning adjustments permitting now new, rich<br/>colors.&quot; I&apos;m 100% with you (for whatever that&apos;s worth), and frothing<br/>at the ear to hear it.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
