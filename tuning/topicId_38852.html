With a long enough chain of fifths, of course,<br/>we might find even closer approximations.</p><p>Interestingly, 1024-tET (very close to 1024-note Pythagorean tuning)<br/>provides a close model of the &quot;nanisma thirds.&quot;</p><p>A 7:6 minor third, for example, is approximated as 228/1024 octave,<br/>equal to 68 near-pure fourths (each 425/1024 octave) up less 28<br/>octaves.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;d like to thank you for raising these questions, and the<br/>Monz for calling my attention to what I describe as &quot;nanisma thirds&quot;<br/>and other intervals varying from ratios such as 7:6, 9:7, and 7:4 by<br/>only about 0.19 cents in a tuning with pure fifths and fourths.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38856 href="#38856">ðŸ”—</a>M.

I&apos;m fairly new at this<br/>game, and right now I&apos;m looking at using Arabic and Turkish tuning and how they<br/>might work out in Western music and jazz (and possibly an attempt at serial<br/>music later). Right now my big thing is 53-tone. I&apos;ve already come up with a<br/>5-limit just approximation of 53-tet, similar to Fokker periodicity. I haven&apos;t<br/>come up with an interval that could be called a &quot;wierisma&quot; yet.I had a 7-limit<br/>53-tone, but it gave me differences of a breedsma (2401/2400) between chromatic<br/>steps in two places. It was also an irregular system where I just used the<br/>smallest factors for each note. In larger scales, I would have cases where the<br/>next chromatic step up being a LOWER pitch in some <a href="http://cases.My">cases.My</a> approach is similar<br/>to a periodicity block, where a regular pattern schismatic (32805/32768 = -8<br/>fifths) and septimal schismatic (33554432/33480783 = -14 fifths) adjustments in<br/>a regular cycle of fifths, since I&apos;m aiming for what I originally called a<br/>&quot;justified equal temperament&quot;. I&apos;m still at work on this thing, and I&apos;ll let<br/>y&apos;all know when I come up with something.Of course, the tuning system probably<br/>had been invented or discovered by someone else 800 years ago....~Danny~</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: Click Here<br/>[<a href="http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c152">http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c152</a>??PI=44364]</p></div><h3><a id=38885 href="#38885">ðŸ”—</a>M.

[1,<br/>&gt; -8,39,113,-59,-15] For example. Thanks</p><p>It&apos;s a wedge invariant, as discussed on tuning-math. Since there is exactly<br/>one for each 7-limit linear temperament, one thing it accomplishes is to<br/>give a standard identifier for such temperaments. I often search the<br/>tuning-math achives using them. They have various other talents as well.</p><p>                    Yahoo!

Hope this doesn&apos;t sound stupid, but could you tell me the<br/>&gt; significance of each number in the &quot;wedge invariant&quot;?

There *are* commas of various kinds hidden in it, for which the numbers are exponents, and as we just saw, if the first number is &quot;1&quot; then 5 and 7 can be expressed in terms of 2 and 3; however it really comes from multilinear algebra, and is not such a good thing to discuss here.
