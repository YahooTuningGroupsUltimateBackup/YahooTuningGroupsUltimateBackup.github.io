I suppose this my be an indirect side-effect of &quot;over-using temperament to optimize harmony&quot;.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2010 1:54:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;The scale is<br/>1<br/>11/10&quot;</p><p>My bad...typo!<br/>When I said:</p><p>&quot;that the melodic nature of the scale seems to work again what he wanted them to do..&quot;<br/>I meant<br/>&quot;that the melodic nature of the scale seems to work AGAINST what he wanted them to do..&quot;</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
