So I&apos;ll keep at it a few<br/>&gt;more years, but definitely move on in time.</p><p>You&apos;re not me (thank god!).  But if you were you&apos;d move up to 41tET.  Say<br/>what you will, but it&apos;s close enough to 88CET, and octaves are a nice<br/>bonus.  You&apos;d get Kyma (just got an amazing upgrade and lower price) and<br/>design groovy additive patches with 41tET overtones.</p><p>&gt;Thanks again, Carl, for reviewing the CD.  By the way, tell us more<br/>&gt;about your concern that &quot;Snake Dance&quot; sounded &quot;interesting but<br/>&gt;unconvincing&quot;.</p><p>Close your eyes.  Imagine yourself dancing with snakes.  I don&apos;t think so.<br/>Seriously, this song put all its eggs in one basket.  It is either going to<br/>create an image or not.  If you&apos;re not dancing by the end, so to speak, it<br/>didn&apos;t work.  I was surprised, because I found Haverstick&apos;s world-inspired<br/>34tET stuff on Acoustic Stick very convincing.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=184 href="#184">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1999 3:38:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; You&apos;re not me (thank god!).
