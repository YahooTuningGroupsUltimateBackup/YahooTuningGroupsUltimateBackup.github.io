This would pretty interesting I think, and I<br/>would love to receive any WAV files of brain recordings.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>The only trouble with speeding thing up, is the fact that you shorten the<br/>damn things as well, and we get the old &quot;chipmunks&quot;-Alvin, Simon and<br/>Theodore, whilst Dave looks onward, agast. :o)</p><p>In other words, harmonic quality is lost.</p><p>Seriously, however, we can use a newer form of sonic alchemy, and<br/>&quot;silly-puttying&quot; around with sound called &quot;time stretch&quot;.</p><p>This involves the computer, cutting up the wavefrom into little &quot;carrot<br/>slices&quot;, and working out what goes in the middle, on average, with some, or<br/>little overlap.</p><p>I would dearly love to know how long this one has been around for.</p><p>With extreme time stretches, we generally get some &quot;assumed&quot; information, as<br/>any system operating so, HAS to, by the very nature of time stretch-we&apos;re<br/>inventing something that really wasn&apos;t there in the first place-the effect<br/>is, very much, in fact, an illusion.....</p><p>Thus, we would very probably need some VERY fine data resolution for<br/>gathering these brainwaves information, to get anything realistic.</p><p>Extreme time stretched can, however, be used for some pretty &quot;nifty&quot;<br/>effects, so it really becomes a play off between what&apos;s actually THERE, and<br/>what we WANT to hear.</p><p>Which do you prefer?</p><p>{SNIP}</p><p>If it is to be done in real time then I would still try to go for a 50<br/>to 100 speed up by simply moving all the frequencies up by that factor<br/>but in this case the piece would last 50 to 100 times longer.  There are<br/>several ways to do this, but using FFT to make a spectrum and then<br/>generating a waveform to play from the adjusted frequencies is the most<br/>accurate.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>Correct me if I am wrong, but did you mean to say &quot;shorter&quot;?<br/>We downscale time when we up scale frequency-they are inversely related.</p><p>I have, BTW, heard whale moanings sped up 15 times, and these sound very<br/>much like birds chirping.</p><p>I wounder if birds chirping slowed down sounds like whales?</p><p>In a physical model, there is more to the story than time stretching and up<br/>sampling-we are applying an oversimplification to an inherantly more complex<br/>model.</p><p>So, would a Jack Russel terrier dog, slowed down, and time compressed, sound<br/>anything likem a Rottweiller?</p><p>{SNIP}</p><p>I have been doing vipassana meditation for about a year and I think that<br/>I could now have some measure of control over what frequencies I make<br/>and maybe make single tones with a little bit of practice and would love<br/>to get involved in such a project.  I see that you are in NZ the same as<br/>me.  Where is your friend?  I am in Auckland, telephone (09) 419 0073.</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>I am in New Zealand, also, and my, how uncanny!</p><p>I have three other friends, both interested in microtonal music-Peter Brock,<br/>a very interesting guy, but a man who&apos;s handwriteing is so damn messy that<br/>it took me about 2 hours to dechipher his letter to me, and even then, this<br/>was with only about 65% comprehension.</p><p>The other two are Alan Wells, who writes for the Listner, and is absolutely<br/>BRILLIANT in English, and a man called Keith Austin, who can play about 6<br/>instruments, but is primarily a keyboard player-and a blooming good one, as<br/>well-I have seen him on the grand piano.</p><p>He&apos;s brilliant.</p><p>{SNIP}</p><p>Thinking of feedback, don&apos;t play the output too loud and too near the<br/>person or you might generate a feedback loop and make an almighty squeel<br/>in the person&apos;s brain   :-)</p><p>Sarn&apos;s reply:</p><p>This is, actually, not as crazy as it sounds.<br/>I was talking to my old, randy, but very wise Uncle in Paekakariki<br/>(Paekakariki in Maori=&quot;The pearch of the little green parrot&quot;), and we were<br/>talking about a series on T.V. called &quot;Sex, lies and videotape&quot;, about a man<br/>who tapes himself and watches himself making &quot;beautiful music&quot; with his<br/>girlfriends, of which there were many-he is a really goodlooking type, with<br/>all the phonie patter.</p><p>And then, a thought struck me, what if he taped himself watching himself,<br/>and iterated the procedure.</p><p>A sort of &quot;recursive pervert&quot;.</p><p>:o)</p><p>Finally, Ray, would you mind if I called you, at some stage?</p><p>I know we are all busy, but, we should all make an effort.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>I am in Wellington, (04) 2355-102.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Sarn Ursell.</p></div><h3><a id=3070 href="#3070">ðŸ”—</a>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/15/1999 10:41:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sarn:<br/>&gt;The only trouble with speeding thing up, is the fact that you shorten the<br/>&gt;damn things as well, and we get the old &quot;chipmunks&quot;-Alvin, Simon and<br/>&gt;Theodore, whilst Dave looks onward, agast. :o)</p><p>&gt;In other words, harmonic quality is lost.</p><p>No harmonic quality is lost by speeding things up, because the waveform<br/>is identical and so all harmonics are identically placed.  It won&apos;t<br/>sound like chipmunks because the original frequencies are all very low<br/>and the speeding up is required to bring it into human hearing range.</p><p>Obviously the action is over in a fraction of the time if it is sped up<br/>and so a decently long recording is required before it is sped up (but<br/>this can be done at 1000 samples per second or less if you want.</p><p>If the frequencies are to be multiplied by 50 to 100 and it is done in<br/>real time, then clearly the speed up factor cannot be applied (as it is<br/>real time) and so in effect each little moment is played 100 times<br/>before moving onto the next.  I say in effect because the phases of the<br/>waveforms must keep on developing correctly which is not trivial.  This<br/>requires understanding how to use FFT software and a fair bit of<br/>programming, although there may be alternative approaches.</p><p>&gt;Finally, Ray, would you mind if I called you, at some stage?<br/>&gt;I know we are all busy, but, we should all make an effort.</p><p>I am happy for you to do that.
