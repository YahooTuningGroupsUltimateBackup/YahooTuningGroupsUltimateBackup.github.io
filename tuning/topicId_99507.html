Is &quot;minor diatonic step&quot; 16/15, and<br/>&quot;major diatonic step&quot; 27/25 or something? Either way, the fact that<br/>magic equates 128/125 and 25/24 is definitely one of its strongest<br/>features, even more so in my opinion than the more usual and cliche<br/>setup whereby 5 5/4&apos;s equals 3/1.</p><p>Since we&apos;re now exploring this paradigm of what small intervals<br/>temperaments equate with one another - rather than the more usual<br/>paradigm of what the generator for a temperament is and how many<br/>generators it takes you to get to 3/1 or 5/1 or some other such<br/>milestone - it might be useful for me to come up with a list showing,<br/>for any 5-limit regular temperament, what intervals in the set {10/9,<br/>16/15, 25/24, 27/25, 81/80, 128/125} are equated with one another for<br/>a particular temperament. That might really be helpful for folks to<br/>really intuitively understand the logic behind each 5-limit<br/>temperament. For example, take negri - what does negri equivocate with<br/>25/24? What about 16/15? etc.</p><p>Lastly in my stream of consciousness post, the fact that 19-tet<br/>supports both magic and negri only bolsters its status in my mind as<br/>The Best Meantone Ever.</p><p>Again, notably absent from this list am I, for I have such an enormous<br/>amount of work to do.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2011 10:25:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By &quot;septimal minor chroma&quot; I was thinking 36/35, but now that you mention it, probably you&apos;re right that the term better suggests 28/27.<br/>Maybe &quot;quintaseptimal chroma&quot; would be better for 36/35, as it separates both the subminor septimal third or 7/6 from the quintal minor third of 6/5, and the septimal supramajor third of 9/7 from the quintal major third of 5/4.</p><p>In the case of septimal &quot;magic&quot; temperament tuned to 41 equal divisions of the octave, which is how this bit is done, the 875/864 comma between  36/35 and 25/24 (the interval between 6/5 and 5/4, for those following along) is tempered out*, equating the two intervals and that&apos;s an essential thing here: the septimal interals are easily reached by the same chromatic step size taken between the quintal thirds. Notice that the very first intervals appearing in the lower pentachord in the &quot;magic&quot; tuning scheme are the subminor third, quintal minor third and quintal major third, seperated from each other by this uniform tempered minor chroma.</p><p>I&apos;ll get those links into the wiki- there should also be a page on proportions betweens commas and between commas and stepsizes, as that is a very natural usage of the &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot;, and probably more easily grasped than comma pumps.</p><p>*not something I&apos;d intuitively expect, as the comma is nearly the size of a 41-edo step size, and it&apos;s impressive how such a large comma is spread out such that the rational approximations remain so audibly decent.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Namely, the diesis, minor chroma, and septimal minor chroma are all tempered to the same size, which in turn is twice the tempered syntonic comma and half the minor diatonic step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ratio of the minor chroma to the diesis is (25/24)/(128/125) = 3125/3072, and presuming by &quot;septimal minor chroma&quot; you mean 28/27 (seems like a good name, anyone have a better one?) then (25/24)/(28/27) = 225/224 and this is magic temperament.
