There is no MIDI connector on the back of the PC, but there<br/>&gt;is a USB connector.  I would like to be able to create alternate<br/>&gt;tunings on my PC and then send them to my CASIO keyboard through its<br/>&gt;MIDI interface in order to re-map the CASIO keyboard from 12 tone<br/>&gt;Equal to just intonation tunings, irrational tunings, etc.</p><p>You need a USB/MIDI interface of some kind.  Plenty to choose from.</p><p>Or, if your soundcard has a SoundBlaster-style joystick jack, that<br/>can be converted to MIDI with a special cable.</p><p>&gt;I stumbled on the homepage of the freeware program SCALA, which<br/>&gt;allows you to create any alternate tuning you want.  But from that<br/>&gt;web page it&apos;s not clear to me what I need to do in order to get what<br/>&gt;I want.  Also, is there some other software available more<br/>&gt;appropriate to the task?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So I have these questions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1. What&apos;s the best software to use?</p><p>Scala is about the best general solution.  And you can&apos;t<br/>complain about the price.</p><p>&gt;2. Could my current sound card be adequate to the task?  If so, how<br/>&gt;do I find out?</p><p>Try to find some documentation for your card.  Not always easy.</p><p>Check the microtonal-synthesis website...</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/</a></p><p>Try sending it generic retuning messages from Scala and see if<br/>it responds.</p><p>Another thing is, you can always use pitch-bend retuning.<br/>Almost every MIDI device on the market supports pitch bends, and<br/>Scala has tools to do alternate tunings with them.  Usually this<br/>method doesn&apos;t give entirely satisfactory results, but it&apos;s a<br/>great expedient to get going with alternate tunings.</p><p>&gt;3. If I need another sound card, what features does it need to have?</p><p>Sound cards are out in favor of software synthesis and external<br/>audio interfaces.  But you won&apos;t be doing a whole lot of software<br/>synthesis with a 600MHz. PC...</p><p>The Korg OASYS sound card was a really awesome card that had<br/>microtuning support, IIRC.  I don&apos;t know if they still make them.</p><p>&gt;4. Can I send the necessary MIDI code to the keyboard out through the<br/>&gt;USB port, or do I need a sound card with a MIDI port?<br/>&gt;5. What type of cable do I need, and where do I get it?<br/>&gt;6. Do I need an operating system upgrade (e.g. to Win 98 second<br/>&gt;edition)?</p><p>Your OS should be fine.  This isn&apos;t the place for very basic<br/>computer music questions, but a little google searching should<br/>bring up to speed very quickly.  Try &quot;usb midi&quot; for starters.<br/>Or go to your local book store and pick up a magazine such as<br/>Computer Music, Future Music, Keyboard, or Electronic Musician.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
