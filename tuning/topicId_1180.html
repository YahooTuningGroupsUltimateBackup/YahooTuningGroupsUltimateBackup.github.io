I have measured the spectrum of many genders<br/>(vibe-like instruments from Java, with resonators) and they usually exhibit both the<br/>spectrum of the bar (f, 2.7f, 5.4f, ...) along with the odd harmonics<br/>(f, 3f, 5f, ...). I think the air column is excited by the percussive hit on the<br/>key. The air column then resonates in its own prefered modes, and these<br/>are often quite loud, compared to the higher partials of the key.</p></div><h3><a id=1256 href="#1256">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Since the driving mechanism is not steady but dies out<br/>exponentially, the standard solution I was thinking of doesn&apos;t apply.<br/>Essentially the phenomena that are usually considered &quot;transient&quot; are<br/>the only ones that matter in this problem. In that case, the air column<br/>being excited by a percussive blow is as important as the bar being<br/>excited so.</p></div>
