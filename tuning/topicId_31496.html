Thank you, Haresh! Just because my choral ensemble specializes<br/>in the sacred music of the great composers, which automatically<br/>implies that we sing music from the European and therefore Christian<br/>tradition, does not mean that we are as narrow in our outlook as the<br/>Christian tradition has only too often proved itself to be.</p><p>I find the Indian ragas deeply and powerfully inspiring. To me the<br/>deepest purpose of music is that of inducing a profoundly intimate<br/>communion with the ultimate intelligence of the universe, which<br/>emanates from within the center of our own being if we allow<br/>ourselves to perceive it. Even the Christian scriptures quote God as<br/>saying, &quot;My spirit shall bear witness within you,&quot; and &quot;Be still and<br/>know that I am God.&quot;</p><p>I believe truly great music brings us into communion with the<br/>universality within all of us and that this is the true power music<br/>has to unify and generate outer peace, inner peace manifest on a<br/>social scale. This is something much more profound than simply a<br/>bunch of people enjoying the same thing together.</p><p>I sometimes feel this latter, superficial meaning when some musicians<br/>talk about the power of music to unite, as if it were simply a way to<br/>get people together and enjoy some kind of entertainment all at the<br/>same time, and that this kind of cool little musical party gives<br/>music its power. No! I&apos;m convinced it&apos;s the power of great music to<br/>model the deepest, most abstract but concretely beautiful levels of<br/>life&apos;s innermost structure, and not the uniting of people to enjoy<br/>just any old music together, that grants this power to music. This<br/>latter has it all backwards in my humble opinion.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;hbakshi1&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope the following ecstatic and enlightening exclamation of the<br/>&gt; sages of the vedic age will inspire you, as it did to me -- that is<br/>&gt; why I thought it proper to post this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Let the drum sound forth and let the lute resound, let the strings<br/>&gt; vibrate the exalted prayer to God.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rig Veda Samhita 8.69.9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=31506 href="#31506">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2001 3:50:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hbakshi1 wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope the following ecstatic and enlightening exclamation of the<br/>&gt; sages of the vedic age will inspire you, as it did to me -- that is<br/>&gt; why I thought it proper to post this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Let the drum sound forth and let the lute resound, let the strings<br/>&gt; vibrate the exalted prayer to God.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rig Veda Samhita 8.69.9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p><p>Not forgetting Psalm 150</p><p>Praise him<br/>with the sound of the trumpet : praise him with the psaltery and harp<br/>Praise him with the timbrel and dance : praise him with stringed instruments and organs<br/>Praise him upon the loud cymbals : praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.....</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
