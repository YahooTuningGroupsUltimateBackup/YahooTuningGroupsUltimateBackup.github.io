If you follow a cycle you<br/>&gt; come back to where you started. If you follow a chain you<br/>&gt; (generally) fall off the end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;etc. -- snip&gt;</p><p>I want to thank you for clarifiying for me the<br/>difference between &quot;chain&quot; and &quot;cycle&quot;.  Got it now.</p><p>Also -- that is, in addition to the as-yet uncorrected<br/>description of these meantones as &quot;cycles&quot; instead of<br/>&quot;chains&quot; -- I realize that I&apos;ve mistakenly characterized<br/>the actual lattice-plots of the linear meantone chains at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/meantone.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>In order even to qualify as &quot;chains&quot;, the meantones I plotted<br/>would all have to have several pitches in between the ones<br/>I plotted, i.e., 1/3-comma would have two pitches between<br/>each one that I plotted, 1/4-comma would have three, etc.</p><p>Also, I originally intended to draw the bounding limits of<br/>those meantone chains more meaningfully, ending each one at<br/>the points where pitches on either end of the cycle would<br/>become audibly indistinguishable, i.e., 19 for 1/3-comma,<br/>31 for 1/4-comma, 43 for 1/5-comma, 55 for 1/6-comma.</p><p>In order to portray what I describe in both of the above<br/>two paragraphs, I would have to strech the scales of both<br/>the 3- and 5-axes of my lattice.</p><p>So I&apos;m writing this post both to acknowledge your response<br/>to me before any more time passes, and to mention the changes<br/>that I hope to make to the &quot;meantone&quot; Dictionary page someday<br/>but probably won&apos;t any time soon (because it means quite a<br/>bit of work).</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
