I spent so many<br/>years finding bassoon fingerings with the Korg tuners--which also had an arrow to<br/>give feedback--that I haven&apos;t thought about this difficulty much.  I<br/>certainly have the problem with tuning the lowest of the piano strings.  More<br/>recently, I noticed a guitarist confidently tuning to a harmonic, but actually missing<br/>the pitch on another string.</p><p>Recently, I tuned a spinet for a friend of mine as a wedding present.  I used<br/>a tuner to check that I was in the right vicinity, but used my ears as the<br/>final arbiter.  A big challenge was to get between some of the strings because<br/>the spinet design makes it very difficult.  (I wanted to get bell-like tones.)<br/>I found I could use Bic pen caps to separate the strings, even better than<br/>the usual black rubber wedges (realized when I dropped the wedge into the spinet<br/>and couldn&apos;t recover it).  Instead of the felt (which I had with me) I used a<br/>long, thin, rounded rubber eraser...about a foot and a half long.  It was<br/>easy to maneuver.</p><p>I tuned pure octaves, refusing to accept blindly that the stretched octaves<br/>&quot;improve&quot; the sound.  And I didn&apos;t count beats.  It worked out quite well,<br/>though there was some immediate slippage that I kept at, mostly in the &quot;bell-tone&quot;<br/>that soured.  It was not my first piano and it has been about 15 years since<br/>I tuned pianos for AFMM concerts.  I enjoyed it as I do to tuning in general.<br/>In the next weeks I will be tuning Joshua Pierce&apos;s piano to Werckmeister III<br/>to try Bach on the modern piano.  (And Werckmeister was specific that the<br/>octaves MUST be just.)  Some time after that, we will try Kirnberger&apos;s tunings for<br/>Beethoven.  But I am starting to think, as per Stuart Isacoff, that Beethoven<br/>may have been one of the first ET composers.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=44021 href="#44021">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2003 6:32:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_43987.html#44007">/tuning/topicId_43987.html#44007</a></p><p>&gt; To Joseph, I am beginning to understand that there is a danger to<br/>pitch accuracy in the transference from one pitch source to another.</p><p>***It was our &quot;beloved&quot; expensive Korg microtuner that we &quot;share&quot;<br/>together (if we can find out where it currently is!).

If you are<br/>tuning the fundamental you better know to apply stretch.  On the other hand<br/>if you are tuning what you hear, maybe you are hearing the harmonics that<br/>are most important to the ear&apos;s sense of pitch.  Maybe additional training<br/>to explicitly recognize that always helps, but may not be essential for many<br/>who already have a &quot;good ear&quot;.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.

The point is that the harmonics, particularly on heavier<br/>(wound) strings are not &quot;true&quot; harmonics, i.e. not in exact ratios.  The<br/>problem gets worse on shorter pianos.  So if you get zero beat on the 3rd<br/>harmonic you won&apos;t get zero beat on the fundamental.  I don&apos;t know the exact<br/>details about what harmonics end up being important, but &quot;the ear&quot; (which<br/>may be an individual thing, but fortunately follows some general patters for<br/>most of us) will hear some harmonics more than others in the process of<br/>determing apparent pitch of a set of &quot;harmonics&quot; that are not exactly<br/>harmonic.  If you are tuning by beat perhaps this will come naturally - the<br/>ones you will tend to hear as you listen for zero-beat will be the ones you<br/>need to hear because those are the ones everyone will tend to hear in<br/>judging the pitch.  I am just guessing here a little - I have never heard<br/>anyone say it exactly this way, and I am not a piano tuner myself!<br/>(Apologies if I am speaking too far out of my expertise.)</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
