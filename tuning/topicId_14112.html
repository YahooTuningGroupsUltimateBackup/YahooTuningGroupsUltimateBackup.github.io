You&apos;ve probably seen those graphics that try to explain how<br/>it is that massive bodies warp spacetime, by showing a thin rubber sheet<br/>with bowling balls, billiard balls and other things sitting on it all<br/>creating bulges in the sheet. That&apos;s what this is - the sheet is warped,<br/>at any point, in inverse proportion to the square of the Euclidian<br/>distance between that point and each triad. To set the &quot;mass&quot; of each<br/>triad, I multiplied together the three ratio-products in their lowest<br/>terms, took the square root, and put the result in the denominator, i.e.:</p><p>1 / sqrt(  i*j / gcf(i,j)  *  i*k / gcf(i,k)  *  j*k / gcf(j,k) )</p><p>This way, a triad i:j:k gets the simple weight 1/(i*j*k) if each of i,j<br/>and k is relatively prime to each of the other two. Something like 5:6:8<br/>is then more &quot;massive&quot; than it would have been with a simple i*j*k rule,<br/>to compensate for the fact that the 6:8 is &quot;really&quot; a 3:4. I can try some<br/>other models later, like Paul&apos;s suggestion of the geometric average of the<br/>three terms - I think this wouldn&apos;t produce enough variance in the size of<br/>the pits though.</p><p>Unfortunately the inverse-square thing makes it difficult to comply with<br/>Monz&apos;s request for hills instead of wells - there&apos;s a singularity at the<br/>bottom of each pit (I offset the points being plotted so they just missed<br/>the places where the depth is 1/0, and the &quot;photo&quot; is taken from such an<br/>angle that you can&apos;t see how deep the wells really are - although it still<br/>made Dan feel a little queasy...). I&apos;ll experiment some more with various<br/>settings to see how I can make the countryside look a little more<br/>welcoming. Maybe green would help, to begin with, so it doesn&apos;t look<br/>Pluto, or like Monz&apos;s scarred desert version.  And I&apos;ll trace some marker<br/>lines across the surface, so you can see where you are.</p><p>The part of the landscape you saw is around the closed positions of the<br/>major and minor triads, showing all the triads that are expressible as<br/>proportions in numbers no bigger than 40. They&apos;re plotted in a<br/>Chalmers-style triangular plane, and I calculated the coordinates using<br/>the formula Paul posted yesterday or the day before. The idea was to have<br/>complex ratios, like, say, 21:26:31, appear as dimples in the slopes of<br/>the deep well around 4:5:6 - I&apos;ll try some adjustments when I get a<br/>chance.</p><p>I just made a jpeg version to upload, but I see someone beat me to it...<br/>Producing an encapsulated PostScript format would be the best solution<br/>(it&apos;s rescalable without loss of resolution), but lots of people might not<br/>have a viewer.</p><p>sorry for the long post --Jon</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2000 10:52:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1 / sqrt(  i*j / gcf(i,j)  *  i*k / gcf(i,k)  *  j*k / gcf(j,k) )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This way, a triad i:j:k gets the simple weight 1/(i*j*k) if each of<br/>i,j<br/>&gt; and k is relatively prime to each of the other two.

Am I correct that your algorithm above<br/>gives a 4:5:6 triad and a 10:12:15 triad the same size pit?
