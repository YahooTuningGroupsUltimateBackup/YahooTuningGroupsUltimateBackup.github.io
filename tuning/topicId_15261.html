I&apos;ve heard of some errata for these charts as well . . .

Even more than the fretless strings and trombone, I find ways to<br/>produce all forms of glissandi and intervals.  As for the fingerings in PITCH<br/>I:4, I do not have errata.  I believe a legend might have helped the oboe<br/>chart by Sullivan, but I don&apos;t know of any specific errors since it came out.<br/> However, please do let me know about them and I will have them corrected.</p><p>For the nonce, come hear some microtonal bassoon, as well as microtonal<br/>everything else at this year&apos;s MICROTHON 2000, Saturday Nov. 11 from 1:30--9<br/>PM at the Quaker Meeting House in NYC.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>Bassoonist/Director<br/>AFMM</p></div>
