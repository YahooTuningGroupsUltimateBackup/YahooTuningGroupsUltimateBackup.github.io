I thought it was naive as a<br/>thesis.  And I think the usage by PNM is paramount to what is gained by you.<br/>Truly, I have avoided theory all my life as a career.  After 4 postgraduate<br/>years at Columbia in ethnomusicology and theory, I was supposed to move<br/>exclusively to theory.  Ethno kicked me out, but theory was unsatisfying.<br/>Composition and Performance are my favorites.  Theory took the gut joy out of<br/>playing.  Composing is independent of theory.  Besides, theories that are<br/>based on style are ipso-facto biased.</p><p>I do understand, Julia, that you have concern about the interference that low<br/>number superparticular can cause to a compositional vision.  Of course, this<br/>would not be true for Minimalism as a musical style, for example.  And you<br/>are not speaking for rock, or for jazz for that matter.  But these are all<br/>inter-related, as both the Maneris have demonstrated in a lifetime of music<br/>making.</p><p>As close as I can gather, now that I have given your article away to Joseph<br/>Pehrson for study, I have also had to deal with these issues.  Joseph seemed<br/>to agree on the telephone last night.  It is sort of a natural consequence of<br/>the set theorists wanting to avoid the equal tempered perfect fifth (at 700<br/>cents) because of its &quot;tonal&quot; implications.  It went with the textbook of<br/>John Rahn in a grad class by Marc Zuckerman.  It seemed silly to me at the<br/>time because atonal music seemed a willful music in which one agrees to<br/>simply turn off all implications in the mind.</p><p>What you have supported is a raison d&apos;&ecirc;tre for 72 to be used without being<br/>sucked in to the tonal impediment of &quot;almost&quot; just intervals that are close<br/>to JI small superparticular intervals.  To me this is like all the<br/>synaesthesia books that came out in the earlier part of the century, each<br/>claiming different colors for different pitches.  Obviously, they hadn&apos;t<br/>consulted, or noticed the idiosyncrasy involved.</p><p>As a composer, I dealt with the issues of an overpowering theoretical usage<br/>of consonance.  Polymicrotonal music allows me to use anything I want, while<br/>excluding what I want, sort of like a pitch canvas.  Semi-religious arguments<br/>on any side that promotes a single way is obviously not of interest.  The<br/>difficult thing is to present something that is true intuitively to a larger<br/>body of population.</p><p>My preference for using JI is to make scales that use ratios that contain a<br/>single number.  For example, my piece Trespass uses a scale in which each<br/>ratio is a multiple of the 17th harmonic.  Audiences easy settle into the<br/>tuning and there is no risk for leaky minds.  Works in 13, etc.  Then there<br/>is more melodic angularity with obvious consonance, but not on the old<br/>standard model.  You might consider it.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=38521 href="#38521">ðŸ”—</a>jwerntz2002 &#x3C;juliawerntz@attbi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2002 1:54:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi again.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>However, I could not (and should not) be quoted third hand to the<br/>&gt; Internet.

(Some of you guys ought to like that!) My exact words:<br/>&quot;A concerted effort to *avoid*  emphasis of the traditional intervals is based, of<br/>course, not on some presumed criteria regarding the quality of certain<br/>relationships [no &quot;synaesthesia&quot; here], but rather upon the need simply to<br/>experience the new relationships, to become familiar with them and give them<br/>musical relevance.&quot; Isn&apos;t that pretty benign?</p><p>I never would have stated that I, or Joe, or Mat - I didn&apos;t even discuss Mat in the<br/>essay - compose or play without &quot;low number superparticular,&quot; as you put it.<br/>(Octaves, fifths, thirds.)

That would, of course,<br/>&gt; &gt; make sense, since you&apos;re lowering the 7 (let&apos;s say Bb) by a<br/>septimal<br/>&gt; &gt; comma...So, obviously, you&apos;re not avoiding *all* just intervals!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Quite frankly, it seems you are *more* concerned about avoiding<br/>&gt; &gt; traditional 12-equal than anything else and, possibly, more<br/>emphasis<br/>&gt; &gt; on that fact and less on the &quot;just stuff&quot; would have enhanced the<br/>&gt; &gt; article.  Just (literally) a thought...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is true. I never claimed to be avoiding any and all just<br/>intervals *in<br/>&gt; composition*. [I can hear you gasping.] That would truly be silly.<br/>My point  was<br/>&gt; about moving away from the familiar. Some of the intervals derived<br/>from JI are<br/>&gt; unfamiliar sounding, those that are farther in frequency from the<br/>traditional ET<br/>&gt; intervals. Why *not* use them, if they have a lovely sound? It&apos;s<br/>the dogma I was<br/>&gt; critical of, and the theoretical premise which seems flawed. Not<br/>the poor intervals!<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, in that case it&apos;s really unclear to me what the first<br/>section of the article has to do with the practical-oriented second!<br/>Maybe nothing, if you&apos;ll beg my pardon for the criticism...</p><p>&gt; I also think 12-note ET intervals are great, in the appropriate<br/>context. But to<br/>&gt; non-just composers seeking to distill new meanings from a new<br/>chromatic I<br/>&gt; recommend avoiding those &quot;old intervals,&quot; which can be<br/>overwhelming,<br/>&gt; overbearing influences from the old language, and are loaded with<br/>preestablished<br/>&gt; (through tradition) meanings. For me, a major third will have this<br/>effect whether it<br/>&gt; is 400 cents or 383 cents. Maybe even 367 cents or 417 cents,<br/>depending on the<br/>&gt; context.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Dunno.  I guess I&apos;m interested in writing a *far* different kind<br/>of music than interests you.  You will probably find my<br/>music &quot;naive...&quot; but that&apos;s OK.

It interests me that even Schoenberg,<br/>with all his prohibitions on the *most familiar* intervals, returned<br/>to use them later in his life with his Second Chamber Symphony and<br/>such like...[oh...
