But, what is of more interest to<br/>me, are dynamic and profound versions of his music, regardless of a few<br/>cents in tuning variation. As I have mentioned several times before,<br/>guitarist Kazuhito Yamashita&apos;s recorded performances of Bach&apos;s violin<br/>sonatas/partitas, are absolutely astonishing, both in terms of technical<br/>command, and emotional/spiritual depth. He is playing in 12 eq, as far<br/>as I can ascertain...I really don&apos;t think, in this case, that, if he had<br/>played in Werck 3, or whatever, that the slight difference in tuning<br/>would have added a whole lot more to the quality and depth of the<br/>performance...maybe, but I doubt it. Actually, I could care less in this<br/>case, as Yamashita, in my opinion, has set a very high standard of Bach<br/>interpretation, that is unlikely to be surpassed, by any performer, on<br/>any instrument, in any tuning, in any time period. I am sure that the<br/>old Maestro would have thought very highly of Yamashita, and I also<br/>think that Yamashita has probably come as close as humanly possible to<br/>playing Bach&apos;s music in the original spirit of Bach...which is to say,<br/>in a way that evokes awe and disbelief in most people that hear it. So,<br/>what&apos;s a few cents here and there when a 12 eq version is about as close<br/>to perfection as one is likely to ever get?    Hstick<br/>PS...also, as I mentioned once before, when Bach and the great lutenist<br/>Weiss jammed, was one in 12 eq, and the other in Werck? What did it<br/>sound like? Were the Maestros concerned about the tuning discrepancy?<br/>Did Bach tune to 12 eq for those sessions? Was it a big deal?</p></div>
