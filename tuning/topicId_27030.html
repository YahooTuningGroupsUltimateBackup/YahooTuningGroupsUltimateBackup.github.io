Given that, and given<br/>that the Blackjack scale is most definitely non-diatonic in nature<br/>anyway, I&apos;d hope a true microtonal explorer would be willing to take<br/>on the extra challenge of re-orienting oneself to the unfamiliar open<br/>string tuning.</p><p>An alternative would be to get frets that don&apos;t go straight across<br/>and give you the blackjack scale when you tune the open strings<br/>exactly in standard tuning (remember, 12-tET is a subset of 72-tET).<br/>But then many of the open strings wouldn&apos;t even be members of the<br/>blackjack scale!

Very valuable<br/>to a mere thorist such as myself. Seriously. And thanks Paul Erlich<br/>for your excellent responses.</p><p>Here&apos;s a set of string gauges that should have consistent tension<br/>.058w .048w .038w .034w .026w .021<br/>  Eb^   G&lt;    Bb^   D     F]    A</p><p>If you know what your current D string is now, you can scale<br/>accordingly.</p><p>Given that the blackjack guitar only has an octvae and a half between<br/>outer strings, instead of the usual two octaves, where do you real<br/>guitarists think this should be positioned. At the top of the standard<br/>guitar range, the bottom, or the middle, and why?</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2001 11:24:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Look at <a href="http://uq.net.au/Music/Miracle/BlackjackGuitar.gif">http://uq.net.au/Music/Miracle/BlackjackGuitar.gif</a></p><p>Doesn&apos;t work.</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2001 3:39:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 8/17/01 4:27 AM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU">D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Look at <a href="http://uq.net.au/Music/Miracle/BlackjackGuitar.gif">http://uq.net.au/Music/Miracle/BlackjackGuitar.gif</a><br/>&gt; and imagine an extra fret in each wide gap.
