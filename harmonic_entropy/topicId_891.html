May I re-phrase that?  From what I&quot;ve read at this list,<br/>there is the high-number ambiguity of chords (where the high number of<br/>the series approximates other chords&apos; numbers), and there is the low<br/>number quality of chords where the dyads are a stronger signal than<br/>the whole chord.  So, I was merely postulating that some chords (the<br/>ones I mentioned) may have the unique property of containing a measure<br/>of both qualities, and perhaps in a way which both forces are<br/>balanced!</p><p>Also, per our ealier discussion of that interesting min 9th chord e2-<br/>g3-f#4, where you pointed out how the difference tones need to be<br/>calculated from the high-number-in-the-series version of the chord,<br/>and not from the dyads.  I had pointed out how the difference of each<br/>individual interval was 7.  (12-5, 15-8, 9-2).  So, is the dyad<br/>element strong in this chord?  And if the individual dyads are<br/>prominant, does the ear then perform a difference tone calculation on<br/>the individual dyads?  Furthermore, could the equalness of the dyads&apos;<br/>difference values, in itself, increase the strenght of the dyad-ness<br/>of this chord, over it&apos;s higher number quality?</p><p>thanks for listening! - Kelly</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2005 2:23:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@h...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, per our ealier discussion of that interesting min 9th chord<br/>e2-<br/>&gt; g3-f#4,</p><p>10:24:45?</p><p>&gt; where you pointed out how the difference tones need to be<br/>&gt; calculated from the high-number-in-the-series version of the chord,<br/>&gt; and not from the dyads.
