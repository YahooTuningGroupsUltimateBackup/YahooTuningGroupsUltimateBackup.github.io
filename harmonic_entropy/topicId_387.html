In the 1-d case, it&apos;s well known that two fractions p/q<br/>and r/s in a Farey series are consecutive if and only if the<br/>determinant</p><p>|p q|<br/>|r s|</p><p>equals &pm;1. Similarly, three triads a:b:c, d:e:f, and g:h:i in the<br/>Farey plane form a &quot;regular triangle&quot; if and only if the determinant</p><p>|a b c|<br/>|d e f|<br/>|g h i|</p><p>equals &pm;1. Apparently, Minkowski proved that there are no triads<br/>of<br/>the Farey set inside, or on the borders of, a regular triangle.</p><p>Mediants in the Farey plane are defined, though these are still<br/>points rather than line segments. In the 1-D case, if the next-higher-<br/>order Farey series has a point between p/q and r/s, it&apos;s the mediant<br/>(p+r)/(q+s).</p><p>If, in the 2-D case, the next-higher-order Farey series provides a<br/>point in the regular triangle, that point will be the mediant of two<br/>of the vertices of the triangle: either<br/>(a+d):(b+e):(c+f)<br/>or<br/>(a+g):(b+h):(c+i)<br/>or<br/>(d+g):(e+h):(f+i).</p><p>Now the partition of the Farey series in the 1-D case into a set of<br/>exhaustive and mutually exclusive regions is trivial. But in the 2-D<br/>case, a partition into regular triangles (called a &quot;triangulation&quot;)<br/>is almost never unique. However, one can define compatible sequences<br/>of triangulations in which each triangulation is a refinement of the<br/>triangulation of the Farey set of next-lowest order...</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2001 6:30:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<a href="http://www.lim.univ-mrs.fr/~thiel/print/remy-thiel-iwcia00.pdf">http://www.lim.univ-mrs.fr/~thiel/print/remy-thiel-iwcia00.pdf</a></p><p>Great!
