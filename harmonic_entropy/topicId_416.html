My<br/>purpose is not to say that this has anything directly to do with it<br/>currently, but in hopes of inspiring a vision of a direction in which<br/>it might one day be refined.</p><p>Where H. E., as I understand it, asks something like, &quot;What<br/>low-limit rational interval is the ear most likely to interpret a<br/>given dyad as, when heard in isolation?&quot;, Dan asked himself something<br/>like, &quot;What interval class is a given melodic interval likely to be<br/>heard as, given a certain musical and cultural context.&quot;  The cultural<br/>part my be pushing things too far for harmonic entropy, but the<br/>musical context part might not be, and the addition of interval<br/>classes and melodic intervals to the equation, while complicating it a<br/>whole lot, might make the idea more appealing to composerly types.</p><p>Maybe too far out, but just a suggestion, and who knows?</p><p>Dan refers to a specific piece of music.  It&apos;s not necessary to hear<br/>it to follow what he says, though.</p><p>--BEGIN QUOTE--</p><p>One of the interesting things I was able to do with &quot;At a Day Job&quot; was<br/>play with (and off of) the many expectations that are set up with such<br/>familiar melodies and tune fragments.</p><p>As an example of this I&apos;d point to the truncated reworking of the<br/>&quot;America the Beautiful&quot; melody that the trumpet takes at the opening.<br/>This is a very familiar, almost archetypal &quot;tattoo&quot;. And it has been<br/>pretty thoroughly branded into many folks mind.</p><p>The tuning that I used combines two overtone series, 10-20 and 14-28,<br/>and I used these as a two octave keyboard mapping. For the opening<br/>&quot;America the Beautiful&quot; tattoo I used a descending 13/10 in the role<br/>of the expected minor third (and a 7/5 in place of the expected fourth<br/>that follows) because this established a workable recasting of the<br/>expected minor third proportion wise.</p><p>What do I mean by &quot;workable&quot;?</p><p>Well it&apos;s no surprise however that this is entirely context specific,<br/>and my reactions to an isolated 13/10 and to the &quot;O Beautiful&quot; 13/10<br/>tattoo in &quot;At a Day Job&quot; are very different indeed. Actual music sets<br/>in motion many things that simple tuning examples and microtonal ear<br/>training can never predict.</p><p>Along the lines of common expectations the 13/10 sort of sits on a<br/>fence between two separate interval classes (unlike an 11/9, or<br/>neutral third for instance, where it&apos;s guaranteed to strike most ears<br/>as some kind of third). And I&apos;d guess that the 13/10 is most often<br/>heard as either an out-of-tune fourth (usually when presented as an<br/>isolated, naked dyad), or as an extremely sharp third (usually when<br/>presented as an isolated melodic interval).</p><p>However, the little &quot;O Beautiful&quot; descending minor third motif is so<br/>familiar, the pull of its expectations so strong, that anything in its<br/>place resembling a major third (to my ears anyway) sounds 100%<br/>obstinately WRONG!</p><p>So what does the 13/10 sound most like in this context?</p><p>To my ears it sounds like an interval unto itself... definitely not a<br/>major third in the traditional or comparative sense, but not quite a<br/>fourth either.</p><p>Anyway, there&apos;s a lot of this business going on in that piece. (And<br/>even some &quot;math&quot; too...)</p><p>thanks for listening,</p><p>--Yankee Doodle Danny</p><p>--END QUOTE--</p><p>David Finnamore</p></div><h3><a id=419 href="#419">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I believe that the categorical perception of (especially melodic)<br/>interval classes is a very important psychoacoustical phenomenon.
