The reason, of course, is the fact that<br/>the mp3s are not there, but only the &quot;zip file&quot; is!</p><p>So, if anyone wants to use the html file, they can simply copy it to<br/>the same directory to which they have already extracted the mp3s on<br/>their own hard drive.  As long as it is in the same directory as the<br/>extracted mp3s it will work...</p><p>Thanks, David for the help!!</p><p>_________ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
