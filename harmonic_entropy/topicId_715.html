Remember the figure 100/(n*d) associated with<br/>&gt; &gt;Helmholtz?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t remember that, but of course it should agree with place,<br/>&gt; as I said below.</p><p>Above?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sure -- I have no problem with this. So the thing is, both<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;periodicity-based and place-based theories predict tolerance (a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;component of the *numerical* model), and harmonic entropy<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;care which of the theories is correct or how much explains what.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok.  Except &quot;tolerance&quot; was originally defined, I thought,<br/>as &apos;the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; predictions of harmonic entropy, wherever they disagree with<br/>n*d&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;No, it&apos;s called &quot;tolerance&quot; because it refers to the specific fact<br/>&gt; &gt;that the strongest consonances each have a certain &quot;tolerance&quot; for<br/>&gt; &gt;mistuning, thus bringing nearby ratios into their well regardless<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;those ratios&apos; complexities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this differs from what I said how?</p><p>It&apos;s very different. It relates to a purely numerical formulation in<br/>which &apos;COMPLEXITY&apos; is the first criterion. It doesn&apos;t relate to<br/>harmonic entropy at all, harmonic entropy could be all wrong,<br/>meaningless, irrelevant to consonance, or completely nonexistent as<br/>far as it&apos;s concerned.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Could<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; erratic behavior on the membrane ruin the fit of the<br/>associated<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; auditory-nerve periodicites<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Umm . . . if the stimuli inside the critical band are<br/>consecutive<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;harmonics, the beat rate would give the fundamental.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Which is a frequency not normally associated with that place on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the membrane.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Or with any place on the membrane at all, almost certainly not if<br/>&gt; &gt;the beating is audible.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Thus perhaps it is causing the same sort of confusion<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as the test tones discussed in the New Scientist article.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;No, for two reasons:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(1) A beat frequency is an *amplitude* modulation; a pitch<br/>frequency<br/>&gt; &gt;is a *pressure* modulation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re talking about a position (of the membrane) modulation here.</p><p>Right, but it&apos;s a very different kind of modulation at that position.<br/>Why do you think the ear would relate one kind to the other?</p><p>&gt; &gt;(2) The beat frequency almost certainly doesn&apos;t have a pitch<br/>&gt; &gt;frequency &quot;equivalent&quot; which corresponds any place whatsoever on<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;basilar membrane.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lost me here.</p><p>It&apos;s too low a frequency!</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2004 3:11:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t remember that, but of course it should agree with place,<br/>&gt;&gt; as I said below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Above?</p><p>In the original message.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Could erratic behavior on the membrane ruin the fit of the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;associated auditory-nerve periodicites<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Umm . . . if the stimuli inside the critical band are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consecutive harmonics, the beat rate would give the fundamental.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Which is a frequency not normally associated with that place on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the membrane.
