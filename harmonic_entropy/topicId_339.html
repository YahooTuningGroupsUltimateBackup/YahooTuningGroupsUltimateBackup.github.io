For example, the dyadic harmonic entropy curve,<br/>which required a million exponentiations to calculate, might be approximable<br/>in terms of a small number of Gaussians. Some mathematician might be able to<br/>work this out.</p><p>What I was initially thinking was that ignoring the &quot;tails&quot; of the bell<br/>curve should reduce the number of calculations by, say, a factor of a<br/>thousand -- but my preliminary experiments in the dyadic case indicate that<br/>ignoring the tails leads to disastrous results . . .</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Something that<br/>&gt;one would guess would be in the right ballpark anyway...</p><p>Well, it would be monotonically related to geometric mean for the simplest<br/>triads, which would be the local minima, and then it would be a smooth<br/>surface parachuting upward from, and connecting, those minima . . . the<br/>problem is determining how simple is simple. For example, in the dyadic<br/>case, it seems that a standard deviation assumption of 0.6% implied a<br/>geometric mean of about 10 as the dividing line between &quot;simple&quot; (local<br/>minima with entropy value monotonically related to geometric mean) and<br/>&quot;complex&quot; (falling on the smooth curve parachuting upward from, and<br/>connecting, those minima) . . . but I don&apos;t know how I would have determined<br/>that without going through the harmonic entropy calculation. Similarly, I&apos;m<br/>interested in a correct triadic computation so that I can see what certain<br/>assumptions about standard deviation imply about &quot;simplicity&quot; and<br/>&quot;complexity&quot; . . .</p></div>
