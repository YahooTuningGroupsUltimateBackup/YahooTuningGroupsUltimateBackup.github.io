You don&apos;t have to look very far to find a similar<br/>&gt;tetrad in the ordering, particularly for the first half of<br/>&gt;them...although there are a few anomalies...</p><p>More than a few, if you ask me.</p><p>&gt;Why??  Dunno.  Maybe the complexity of the chords makes them harder<br/>&gt;to rank clearly (??) Or maybe the otonal JI characteristics are not<br/>&gt;as evident in the more complex chords and the chords are not as<br/>&gt;immediately ranked by that factor...</p><p>In the dyadic case, the harmonic entropy model predicts that the geometric<br/>mean is only a good ranking for dyads where the geometric mean is less than<br/>8-10. I wouldn&apos;t be suprised if many of the geometric means for these chords<br/>are well above the &quot;limit&quot; according to the tetradic harmonic entropy model,<br/>once that&apos;s worked out.</p></div>
