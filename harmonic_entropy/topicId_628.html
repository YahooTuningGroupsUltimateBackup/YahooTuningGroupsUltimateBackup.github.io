If a three-tone cord is involved, the amplitude of<br/>products of the type f1 + f2 - f3 is twice as high (+ 6 dB) as that of the<br/>type 2f1 - f2 etc. This is at least the result of chord calculations with a<br/>little simulation program that I am using. The model on which it is based<br/>features a very modest nonlinearity.</p><p>Anyway, I use that criterion only for a &quot;quick &amp; dirty&quot; assessment of a<br/>chord. The full treatment only (taking into account the gamut of harmonics<br/>and combination tones) finally reveals what I believe is essential: the<br/>&quot;shape&quot; (gestalt) of a chord. Going back to the chords originally discussed,<br/>7:9:11 fares much better under that treatment than 14:18:21.
