I noticed that in the chord 5:6:9, both its simple and cubic<br/>difference tones are exactly the same (1,3,4).   I haven&apos;t found this<br/>feature in any other 5-limit closed-position chord. (A few others may<br/>have this feature -- I don&apos;t have my notes with me-- but only through<br/>octave equivalence.) I;ve always found this chord to be especially<br/>smooth sounding, and wonder if this has anything to with it.  (I&apos;ve<br/>always liked the fact that the numerators, 6/5, 3/2, are in a 2:1<br/>ratio.)</p><p>thanks, Kelly</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2005 4:04:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello.
