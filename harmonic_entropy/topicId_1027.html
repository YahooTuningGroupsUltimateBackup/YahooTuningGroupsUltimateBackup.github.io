For chords such as 3:7:10, and 4:6:10, where the difference<br/>tones land on the chord tones (ie, 10-7=3, 10-6-4; Helmholtz commented<br/>on these, and I like them too!)...I had a question.  This is probably<br/>axiomatic to the math adept (but an exciting mystery to me!):what math<br/>principle is it that accounts for the fact that if you take 3 adjacent<br/>numbers in a sequence (eg, 4,5,6...or 3,5,7) and double the middle one<br/>(to get 4,6,10...and 3,7,10), that you get 10-7=3, 10-6=4?  (Don&apos;t<br/>laugh...)</p><p>A similiar question, is: take the chord 12:15:20.  You have 5/4 x 3 =<br/>15:12, and 4/3 x 5 = 20/15.  Then, 15-12 equals the difference tone 3,<br/>and 20/15 equals the differnece tone 5.  It just seems neat that 5/4 x<br/>3 = 15/12 (the position of the interval in that particular chord), and<br/>that the difference between the two numbers (15 and 12) is the same<br/>number with which the lower fraction (5/4) was multiplied.  So why are<br/>the differnce tone and the &apos;interval height&apos; the same?</p><p>thanks, Kelly</p></div><h3>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2006 5:31:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello.
