It is<br/>surely hard to share my opinion about the modality notion -- a measure in<br/>the gradation minor/major -- if the terminology of chords is the reference.</p><p>The terms major and minor applied to the triad had a sense (linked to<br/>harmonics and subs) as a modality of relation for three elements. However,<br/>the terminology has evolved from the model of third superposition. In<br/>complex chord, major or minor is now only qualifying the first third rather<br/>than characterizing the type of relation of all the elements in the chord.</p><p>I don&apos;t use the modality notion in the theory itself but in periphery, for<br/>instance in the vectorial representation of the modes with lattices (where<br/>the lines are the steps).</p><p>I&apos;m not worry about musical terms.
