I<br/>wonder what we said then...</p><p>...the only hits for &quot;LCM&quot; in my tuning-math inbox are from the<br/>beginning of this year, when Gene was asking how similar Euler&apos;s<br/>LCM/GCD was to harmonic entropy.</p><p>Here&apos;s selections from tuning...</p><p>[Graham]<br/>Some people leave out multiples of 2 when calculating dissonances.<br/>Then 15/8 and 6/5 come out the same.  The LCM can be evaluated for<br/>a whole chord, where C-E-G-B comes out unduly consonant.  A way<br/>round this problem is to calculate Euclidian distances on a<br/>parallelogram lattice.</p><p>[Dave]<br/>...applied to dyads where the ratio n:d is already in lowest terms,<br/>the LCM is the same as the product n*d ... suffer from the possible<br/>defect pointed out by Paul Erlich where for example, 15/4 has the<br/>same complexity as 12/5, or 3/2 the same as 6/1. However the<br/>disagreement with perceived dissonance may be taken care of by<br/>TOLERANCE in the first case and SPAN in the second. So they may not<br/>amount to a defect in the COMPLEXITY measure.  Note also that the<br/>LCM of a chord corresponds to the &quot;guide tone&quot;...</p><p>[Graham]<br/>Harmonic entropy, which may or may not be related to dissonance, is<br/>in fact related to the frequency an LCM above the VF.  I believe<br/>this is known as the &quot;guide tone&quot; in the literature.  So, the lower<br/>the guide tone, the lower the entropy. ... I don&apos;t know how to<br/>generalise the harmonic entropy beyond dyads.  However, my intuition<br/>strongly suggests that it will still lead to the guide tone.</p><p>[Paul]<br/>The guide tone is lower and simpler for utonal chords than otonal<br/>chords. However, harmonic entropy will definitely be lower for<br/>otonal chords. ... I don&apos;t see how LCM figures into it. If we can<br/>somehow believe that for triads, the &quot;area&quot; is inversely<br/>proportional to the geometric mean of the three integers most<br/>simply expressing the chord (e.g., 4:5:6 or 10:12:15), then we<br/>have a way to compute harmonic entropy for triads. But if you look<br/>at a 2-d plot (such as a Dalitz plot) of all the triads, you&apos;ll see<br/>that this &quot;area&quot; may have a very strange shape and might not be<br/>possible to define with some generalization of mediants.
