So that says that the distance between the chord 0<br/>0 0 and the chord 0 250 500 is 500&cent;. Huh? Meanwhile, the distance between<br/>the origin and the upper corner of the triangle is 500*2/sqrt(3) = 577&cent;.<br/>That says that the distance between the chord 0 0 0 and the chord 0 0 500 is<br/>577&cent;. Wha???</p><p>So clearly, we should build a scaling factor of sqrt(3)/2 into our<br/>transformation so that the triadic distances are meaningful. So the FINAL<br/>formula for the Cartesian coordinates (x,y) for a chord with intervals x&apos;<br/>and y&apos; is:</p><p>x = x&apos;*sqrt(3)/2<br/>y = y&apos;+x&apos;/2</p><p>The distance function that this leads to has the property that if two chords<br/>differ only in the tuning of one note, the distance between them will be<br/>equal to the amount that that note moved (hence in the picture I made with<br/>the red (JI major triad) and blue (JI minor triad) points, each triad is<br/>closest to its &quot;partner&quot; in the same inversion, at a distance of 71&cent;). For<br/>chords that differ in two notes, it&apos;s less intuivite what a distance<br/>function would mean -- the example 0 0 0 and 0 250 500 would now have a<br/>distance of 433&cent; -- but at least it makes sense as a sort of &quot;weighted<br/>average&quot; of how the intervals change, and is of course the only option that<br/>seems consistent with a geometrical picture of triads -- in other words,<br/>it&apos;s the only possible _Euclidean_ distance function for triads.</p></div>
