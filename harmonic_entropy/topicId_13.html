Beardsley&apos;s convinced<br/>that the main list&apos;s quietened down.  Now I&apos;ll continue my quest to find out what<br/>it all means.</p><p>The basic idea is that a chord is rated according to the ambiguity in assigning a<br/>ratio to it.  So, could we divide pitch space into bins, calculate a load of<br/>ratios, and plot a histogram of the results.  The more ratios there were in a bin,<br/>the more complex chords that fall into the bin would be.</p><p>Is this what you&apos;re doing, then?  With a Gaussian to allow more than one bin to<br/>contribute to the complexity measure of a point in pitch space?</p><p>As for these Voronoi-cell type graphs.  I think I could draw one with each cell<br/>sized according to a complexity measure for the interval inside.  This would mean<br/>having a complexity field around each point, and drawing the lines where the field<br/>strength of the to strongest ratios are equal.  But I expect it would be easier to<br/>generate loads and loads of ratios, and go for the histogram.</p><p>It would be good to use hexagonal cells, although I suppose we could still draw 60<br/>degree lattices on square cells.  I&apos;ll have to work out hexagons anyway before I<br/>can write a generalized keyboard applet.  One problem would be that you need a lot<br/>of square pixels to draw one hexagon.</p><p>Well, what do people think?</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Paul H.

It&apos;s not just how many ratios in a bin or under a Gaussian,<br/>it&apos;s how they&apos;re distributed. If one is much wider than the others, the<br/>listener has a much easier time guessing how to interpret that interval. If<br/>they&apos;re all equally wide, then the listener is very confused. Entropy<br/>measures the degree of compressibility in a signal. If the signal has a much<br/>higher probability of taking on one value than any of the other values, it<br/>is very compressible, and the entropy is small. If all values are equally<br/>probable, it is incompressible, and the entropy is maximal. You might want<br/>to find an information theory book to learn more.</p><p>&gt;As for these Voronoi-cell type graphs.

With a hexagon, all adjacent hexagons will be equivalent, but with<br/>squares some share an edge, but some only a corner.  Hexagons can also<br/>tesselate for 60 degree axes.</p><p>For the Voronoi-type diagram, it may still be useful to store ratios in<br/>bins, so that a ratio&apos;s near neighbours will always be in the same or<br/>adjacent bins.  That should speed up the computatation, as fewer points<br/>will need to be considered to decide which pair are closest.  Hexagons may<br/>be an advantage again, and wouldn&apos;t affect the result.  Or they may be too<br/>much trouble.</p><p>         Graham</p></div><h3>Paul H.
