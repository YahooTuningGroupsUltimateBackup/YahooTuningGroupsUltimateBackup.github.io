I expect that a local maximum dissonance closer to 740<br/>&gt; &gt; cents would also result in a global maximum dissonance at an<br/>&gt; location<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhat different from 67 cents (but smaller or larger?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if we simply reduce s lower than its current value of .01, then i<br/>&gt; expect we could get the 740, but the 67 would probably drop to a<br/>&gt; lower value (holding the tenney seed limit constant).</p><p>I still have to listen to intervals approaching 3:2 and 4:3 from both<br/>directions (with some variation in register) to see if my previous<br/>observations regarding local maximums of dissonance can be<br/>confirmed.

We perceive dissonance as<br/>&gt; disturbances (i.e., beating or roughness) due to two things:<br/>partials<br/>&gt; and combinational tones.  (Do you know of any others?)</p><p>yes, i believe that the virtual pitch phenomenon (measurably distinct<br/>from combinational tone effects), which most recently seems to have<br/>acquired a neurological explanation in terms of a revived version of<br/>the old &quot;periodicity pitch&quot; paradigms, is one of the most important<br/>factors. take a look at the book _harmony: a psychoacoustical<br/>approach_ by richard parncutt for but one (not very good, but it<br/>makes the point) attempt to work out the implications of such a view,<br/>back when pattern-matching rather than neural timing was the<br/>predominant explanation for virtual pitch effects. for a more recent<br/>understanding, i&apos;d suggest striking up a conversation with hans<br/>straub over on the SpecMus list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you also have a calculation of harmonic entropy for chords?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; well, it&apos;s pretty much been mapped out on this list, but the<br/>&gt; &gt; calculation has never actually been done. i&apos;ve been waiting for<br/>&gt; &gt; someone to offer a computational shortcut. but my new computer is<br/>&gt; &gt; pretty fast; maybe i&apos;ll fire it up . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For starters, I would be interested in comparing the values you get<br/>&gt; for 4:5:6, 10:12:15, 6:7:9, and 14:18:21.</p><p>if you look over this list, you&apos;ll see that i&apos;ve always claimed that<br/>harmonic entropy is only one component of discordance, while<br/>roughness is another. so, while i&apos;m pretty sure the triadic harmonic<br/>entropy calculation would rank these triads simply in the order of<br/>the size of their numbers (specifically their product or geometric<br/>mean), a roughness calculation would show 4:5:6 and 10:12:15 as<br/>approximately tied for most consonant. how to combine the harmonic<br/>entropy piece and the roughness piece into an overall discordance<br/>measure is not a problem i can forsee a full or elegant or even<br/>universal solution to. we are fortunate that for dyads, harmonic<br/>entropy considerations and roughness considerations predict pretty<br/>much the same kinds of discordance curves, so in the dyadic case we<br/>can &quot;pretend&quot; that harmonic entropy *is* discordance.</p><p>for the tetrads we listened to, it seems harmonic entropy was a<br/>*stronger* determinant of the consonance/dissonance rankings than<br/>roughness. however, 9:11:13:15 was perceived as considerably more<br/>discordant than other tetrads with similar geometric mean, so it<br/>seemed roughness did have *some* importance to most listeners.<br/>however, you seem to feel that 9:11:13:15 is extremely concordant,<br/>which is why i made the remarks i did that are quoted way up at the<br/>top of this message. maybe you could look them over one more time so<br/>that we might each approach a better understanding of what the other<br/>is saying/thinking.</p><p>best,<br/>paul</p></div><h3><a id=626 href="#626">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2002 11:02:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In harmonic_entropy@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for the tetrads we listened to, it seems harmonic entropy was a<br/>&gt; *stronger* determinant of the consonance/dissonance rankings than<br/>&gt; roughness. however, 9:11:13:15 was perceived as considerably more<br/>&gt; discordant than other tetrads with similar geometric mean, so it<br/>&gt; seemed roughness did have *some* importance to most listeners.<br/>&gt; however, you seem to feel that 9:11:13:15 is extremely concordant,<br/>&gt; which is why i made the remarks i did that are quoted way up at the<br/>&gt; top of this message. maybe you could look them over one more time<br/>so<br/>&gt; that we might each approach a better understanding of what the<br/>other<br/>&gt; is saying/thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; best,<br/>&gt; paul</p><p>Could you tell me what some of those &quot;other tetrads&quot; were?</p><p>But whatever they were, I suspect that we are not in disagreement on<br/>this, because, after reflecting on this a bit, I now realize that I<br/>was thinking of 9:11:13:15 as more consonant than *other* (non-<br/>isoharmonic) chords containing lower primes, but which would have a<br/>higher geometric mean.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example in which I would consider the isoharmonic chord<br/>more consonant than another chord containing a lower prime --<br/>14:18:21 vs. 7:9:11 -- in which only the top tone differs.
