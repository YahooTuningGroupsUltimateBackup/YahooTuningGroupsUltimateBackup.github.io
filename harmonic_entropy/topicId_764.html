Harmonic entropy site&apos;s kind &apos;a deserted, so I thought<br/>&gt;I would post here...Does anyone know why the the main harmonic<br/>&gt;entropy graph does not include 15/8?</p><p>It does include 15/8 -- in fact it includes every interval between 0<br/>and 2400 cents. If you locate the point on the horizontal axis at<br/>about 1088 cents, and find the point on the curve directly above<br/>that, you&apos;ll see the harmonic entropy for 15/8.</p><p>I only explicitly labeled the ratios that fell at local minima of<br/>this graph. Other graphs, which you can find in the files folder of<br/>this group as well as the tuning group, do show local minima at 15/8<br/>and other ratios of such complexity. See, for example,</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/margo.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/margo.gif</a></p><p>&gt;(15/8 is a personal favorite of mine; leading tone<br/>&gt;and tonic combined in one chord!</p><p>In the context of these harmonic entropy graphs, it&apos;s no more leading<br/>tone and tonic than mediant and subdominant or any other random pair<br/>of notes a 15/8 apart. Tonal context is not part of harmonic entropy -<br/>- harmonic entropy only treats sounds in isolation, and the<br/>experience of dissonance has a whole lot to do with context (such as<br/>tonal context) too.</p><p>&gt;..., and, to my ear, and in my choice<br/>&gt;of chord construction, it serves as a &apos;near-octave....)</p><p>Well, this near-octaveness is one reason it doesn&apos;t usually show up<br/>as a local minima of harmonic entropy. The ratios 13/7, 15/8, 17/9,<br/>21/10, *and* 2/1 are all competing when you hear, say, a major<br/>seventh in 12-equal (which, I&apos;m guessing at this point, is the tuning<br/>you&apos;re actually using in practice).</p><p>thanks, Kelly</p></div>
