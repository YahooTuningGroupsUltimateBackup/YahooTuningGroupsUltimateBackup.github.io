The particles of the upper atmosphere disperse light<br/>of all wavelengths longer than (a greenish) blue.  Their energy is<br/>scattered and lost in multiple collisions with air particles.  But the<br/>blue - AND the indigo, violet and ultraviolet - do get through.</p><p>&gt; ...the eye acutally sees all the colors of the raimbow, but<br/>&gt; *decides* to &apos;call it blue&apos; since the wavelenth of that color is 200<br/>&gt; times more energetic than the other colors -- essentially ignoring<br/>&gt; them, even though it sees them.  (Then why isn&apos;t the sky purple?)</p><p>Because &quot;purple&quot; is any mixture of the colours at the blue end of the<br/>spectrum with the colours at the red end of the spectrum (it is<br/>inherently impure).  Since there&apos;s no red coming through, there can<br/>be no purple.</p><p>Perhaps you really meant &quot;violet&quot; and not &quot;purple&quot;?  Well, the colour<br/>receptors in our eyes that respond to red also have a smaller peak<br/>in sensitivity down towards violet.  Although the primary response of<br/>our eyes to violet is by the blue colour receptors, this adds an<br/>apparent reddish component, which is why we often perceive violet<br/>as a purplish blue.  Which in turn is why we can close the &quot;colour<br/>wheels&quot; used by artists and interior designers by gradating from<br/>blue through indigo and violet, through purples to red, thus<br/>effectively joining two ends of the spectrum.</p><p>If we had a white sun, instead of the orange-yellow Sol, we&apos;d surely<br/>get more light down the blue-indigo-violet end of the spectrum.<br/>Perhaps the increase in indigo and violet would alter the colour of<br/>the mixture we perceive, towards (the apparently more purplish)<br/>violet.</p><p>&gt; So that reminds me of how the ear, even though it hears the soft<br/>&gt; upper partials, ignores them, and presents the listener with just a<br/>&gt; low fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if that&apos;s a common mechanism, like how both vision and<br/>&gt; hearing record their stimuli logrythmically?</p><p>The same thing happens with colour perception.  Asked to name the<br/>colour of a car going past, you may immediately and unhesitatingly<br/>say &quot;yellow&quot;.  Yet you recognise an astounding variety of colours as<br/>different &quot;yellows&quot;, some of which you may have names for:<br/>&quot;buttercup&quot;, &quot;marigold&quot;, &quot;lemon&quot;, &quot;mustard&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, ... maybe even<br/>&quot;cream&quot;.  There are even more &quot;greens&quot; than there are &quot;yellows&quot;,<br/>&quot;reds&quot; or &quot;blues&quot;, since that&apos;s where our eyes are most responsive.<br/>Yet most of use will immediately classify a colour that&apos;s almost<br/>blue, and another that&apos;s almost yellow, as &quot;green&quot;.</p><p>Apart from the underlying physiology, the fascinating thing about<br/>colour perception categories is that they&apos;re very largely cultural<br/>artefacts.  A similar comment might apply to sound perception<br/>categories, don&apos;t you think?  Despite many years of hearing<br/>Indonesion gamelan and anklung music, my impressions of it are<br/>more timbral than tonal.  Yet the similarly complex timbres of the<br/>piano are usually, for me, just a colouring layered over a<br/>fundamentally tonal experience.  This surely reflects the ways in<br/>which both cultures traditionally organise their tonal &amp; timbral<br/>material.  (Despite my name, I grew up in Australia listening to<br/>a lot of piano music, some classics and a little pop or rock.)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 267.15.11/264 - Release Date: 17/2/06</p></div>
