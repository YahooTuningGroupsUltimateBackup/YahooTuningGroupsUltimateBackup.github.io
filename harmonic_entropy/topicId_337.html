I hope it will remain<br/>active until its work is finished.  Perhaps I&apos;ll have time<br/>to participate again in a few months, once I&apos;m settled in<br/>California.</p><p>I will un-subscribe on Sunday, Dec. 24th, at which time I<br/>will drink a hearty toast to a 21st-century theory of musical<br/>concordance!</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;&quot;Just a word about Stern-Brocot tree. It corresponds point-to-<br/>&gt;point to space of modular matrix 2 x 2 where determinant<br/>&gt;ad-bc = 1.  Summing columns give 2D vector (ratio) of Stern-<br/>&gt;Brocot tree. (And summing columns is like apply matrix to<br/>&gt;vector (1,1). Summing lines give 2D (contra)vector of Euclid<br/>&gt;tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Generalizing to nD implies n(n-1) components. In 2D, tree has<br/>&gt;2 branchs at each nodes, in 3D, tree has 6 branchs at each node,<br/>&gt;in 4D, tree has 12 branchs at each nodes, etc. Besides, elements<br/>&gt;are not always 2D vectors assimilable to ratios but nD vectors<br/>&gt;assimilable to chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I investigate few strategies to extend minimally Euclid<br/>&gt;algorithm (the problem seems complex) but I will look anew later<br/>&gt;for I found a new application of Stern-Brocot tree in lattices.</p></div>
