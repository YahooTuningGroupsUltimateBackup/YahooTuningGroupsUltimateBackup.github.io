But nothing in<br/>nature depends on your units of measurement. To see what I mean, take<br/>any two tones, determine what the &apos;multiplication tone&apos; would be in<br/>two different sets of units (say, cycles per second and cycles per<br/>minute), and then convert back into a common set of units. Your two<br/>results won&apos;t agree! This is a sign that such a phenomenon is<br/>impossible in the physical world. A scientist would immediately<br/>recognize this through &apos;dimensional analysis&apos;: If you have two<br/>frequencies P Hz and Q Hz, then their product will be P*Q Hz^2. This<br/>is not a frequency but a *square frequency* -- whatever that is, it<br/>sure isn&apos;t a number that can be interpreted to mean cycles per second.</p><p>&gt; I assume that the way intervals &apos;stack&apos; up in a multiplicative<br/>&gt; fashion to create chords (5/4 x 6/5 = 3/2) is unrelated to hearing<br/>&gt; mechanisms and brain processing, and is a simple result of the<br/>&gt; logarithmic nature of pitch?</p><p>It seems to be a simple result of arithmetic, actually, having<br/>nothing to do with the nature of pitch.</p></div>
