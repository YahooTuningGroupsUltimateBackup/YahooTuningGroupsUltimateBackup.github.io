You need a way for data from the<br/>&gt;&gt;combination-sensitive stuff to improve the spectral stuff coming<br/>&gt;&gt;off the cochlea.</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;There&apos;s less ambiguity as to the possible ratio-intepretations.</p><p>me:<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think it works that way.</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;It does. Devise a baby mathematical model for it and you&apos;ll see.</p><p>Did Goldstein ever do experiments on simultaneous tones?</p><p>me:<br/>&gt;&gt;The &quot;accuracy&quot; of the &quot;fundamental&quot; is improved as the spectral<br/>&gt;&gt;components get closer to just, as the harmonic entropy calc.<br/>&gt;&gt;itself correctly models. But to change s in this way is a fudge,<br/>&gt;&gt;in my opinion.</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;It would be nice to derive the change in s mathematically, and any<br/>&gt;baby model will do so. However, until the model is more fully<br/>&gt;developed, I&apos;m hesitant to put forward any exact formulas about how<br/>&gt;s changes.</p><p>Well, here&apos;s one person looking forward to when you are.</p><p>me:<br/>&gt;&gt;With harmonic timbres, h.e. on the fundamentals is a good<br/>&gt;&gt;approximation of things, but with inharmonic timbres, all spectral<br/>&gt;&gt;components need to be put in to the h.e. calculation. Jacking up<br/>&gt;&gt;s may approximate this, but it would be a fudge.</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;Again, if the inharmonicities are only about 50 cents, I thing it&apos;s<br/>&gt;a pretty darn good one.</p><p>Maybe so.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=572 href="#572">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
