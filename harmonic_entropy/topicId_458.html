In general, there are two ways in which sounds are differentiated<br/>by the ear.</p><p>a. Place theory:  The basilar membrane is shaped like a very long<br/>triangle.  Each region resonates at a different frequency.<br/>Consequently, the place on the basilar membrane that gets most<br/>excited in response to any incoming sound wave provides information<br/>about the frequency.</p><p>b. Frequency theory:  Individual neurons fire at the rate of the<br/>incoming sound.(Or groups, as per the volley theory.)</p><p>The place theory does not hold below about 500 Hz, and the frequency<br/>theory does not hold above about 4000Hz.  Between 500 and 4000 hz,<br/>both mechanisms play a role.</p><p>3.
