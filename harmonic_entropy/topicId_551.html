This represents an approximate 1.5:1<br/>&quot;compression ratio&quot; over an 60 dB &quot;input dynamic range&quot; (up to 100 Phons),<br/>resulting in approximately 20 db of non-linear &quot;loudness reduction&quot; occuring.</p><p>The resultant *perceived partials* generated by such non-linearity (at 500 Hz)<br/>are the 2nd harmonic (at 40 Phons), the 3rd harmonic (at 60 Phons), the 4th<br/>harmonic (at 70 Phons), and the 5th harmonic (at 80 Phons). At around 250 Hz,<br/>these &quot;compression thresholds&quot; begin about 10-20 dB lower levels (in Phons) than<br/>are listed above. At 1000 Hz (and higher in frequency), these &quot;compression<br/>thresholds&quot; begin about 10 dB higher levels (in Phons) than are listed above<br/>(&quot;Music, Physics, and Engineering&quot;, Second Edition, Olson, 1967, after Wegel and<br/>Lane, page 256).<br/>_______________________________________</p><p>JG: Paul, evidently referring to applying a (dyadic or tetradic) &quot;discordance&quot;<br/>algorithm which appears to have been generated by Bill Sethares (and referred to<br/>in a thread entitled &quot;Sethares algorithm) in &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #27:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/message/27">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/message/27</a><br/>[<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/message/27">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/message/27</a>]PE: &quot;... if I use a<br/>fixed waveform and simply adjust the volume up<br/>or down (by adding a constant to all the dBs), I get very different curves.<br/>Is that the way it&apos;s supposed to work, Bill?&quot;</p><p>___________________________________</p><p>Recalling the experience in:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23898">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23898</a><br/>[<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23898">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23898</a>]</p><p>PE: Again, Sethares, working with me, was unable to ascertain exactly how<br/>to use his formula.

The full model would also take into account combinational<br/>tones, and then the Sethares roughness and harmonic entropy taken into<br/>account. It&apos;s pretty clear that the Sethares model alone is inadequate to<br/>account for the dissonance of simple tetrads with fairly typical loudness<br/>and frequency (if you look at the experiments we did at the start of this<br/>list). And I think harmonic entropy provides a much better explanation than<br/>Sethares (who relies on rather contrived spectral comparisons) of why<br/>gamelan music sounds pleasant in the absence of small number ratios.</p><p>(b) The harmonic entropy model has one free parameter, s.
