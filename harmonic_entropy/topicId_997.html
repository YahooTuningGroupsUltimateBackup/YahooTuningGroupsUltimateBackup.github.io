The ratios of the difference tones of the<br/>fundamentals (1, 3, and 4) to each other, to<br/>the overtones and to the fundamentals.</p><p>4.  The ratios of the difference tones of the<br/>overtones (2, 6, 8, ...) to each other, to the<br/>overtones and to the fundamentals.</p><p>Which ones of these actually contribute to the<br/>final sound is pretty much a question of timbre,<br/>by which I mean the relative strengths of the<br/>partials, and of amplitude, since soft sounds may<br/>have inaudible interactions.  For synthetic<br/>instruments, the result may also depend on phase,<br/>but that&apos;s not usually so for acoustic instruments.</p><p>With all these different numbers in play, all of<br/>which arise from purely physical considerations<br/>there&apos;s no need to involve a *hypothetical*<br/>interval 6:3.  You really need to relate ALL the<br/>sounds of the chord to a common number, their<br/>GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).  For 5:6:9, this<br/>is 1.  Then relating this to a notional frequency,<br/>eg A 110 Hz, your chord is 550, 660, 990 Hz.<br/>These notes have overtones at integer multiples<br/>of those three frequencies, and difference tones<br/>at integer multiples of the GCD note, 110 Hz.<br/>(I&apos;m assuming harmonic timbres.)</p><p>However you realise your chord, it must be<br/>expressed as specific frequencies.  If you stick<br/>to exact integer ratios, those frequencies have a<br/>GCD which may well be in the audible range, as in<br/>my example using 110 Hz.  For higher integer limit<br/>chords, the GCD may be subsonic.  But even then,<br/>all of the components of the sound you hear will<br/>be integer multiples of that number.

So, with 4:5:9, the 3:2 &apos;slides up&apos; to a new postion (9:6).<br/>That&apos;s why I see the 6:3 of 4:5:9 as expressing, in a &apos;recombinant&apos;<br/>kind of way (like genes jumping around in a chromosone!), the<br/>harmonic series as represented by 4:5:6, and find it useful to<br/>compare how the the 3/2 interval &apos;interacts&apos; differently with it&apos;s<br/>sister intervals in different chords.</p><p>2) Also, is it possible that having multiple &apos;representations&apos; of<br/>three in the same chord (put that way, &apos;cause I still don&apos;t<br/>understand the difference between powers, logs, and doubling<br/>series!) could have an acoustical effect?  You have 3, 3x2, and 3x3,<br/>in the numerators of 5:6:9&apos;s intervals (6/5, 3/2, 9/5).  I know this<br/>could be facile numerology, but have you listened to the chord e4-g4-<br/>f#5 (20:24:45) lately*?  (Let&apos;s suppose we&apos;re hearing the same<br/>chord, regardless of tuning.) Aside from it&apos;s very open but rough<br/>quality, I fancy that the 9 (of 9/4) and the 6 (of 6/5), &apos;resonate<br/>in some manner&apos;, probably because of the 3/2 ratio (of 9/6).</p><p>I know I&apos;m out on a limb, but do you really believe that the unique<br/>qualities which certain chord types possess (such as triads, seventh<br/>chords, and their inversions), is fully described by tonalness,<br/>difference tones, beats, partials, and roughness?</p><p>(*By the way, the musical intro to the movie Citizen Kane, by<br/>Bernard Hermann, has a great minor ninth chord, in the scene with<br/>the monkeys and statues.
