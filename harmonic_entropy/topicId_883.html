I notice that for simple chords such as 4-5-6, 3-4-5, 5-<br/>6-8, and 4-5-7, that it&apos;s the utonal chord version which has a<br/>relatively low lowest common overtone, and not the otonal version.<br/>(Hmm, but it&apos;s the otonal chords which are supposed to be less<br/>discordant?)  In any case, I was wondering if this lowest common<br/>overtone, for example, in the minor triad, (where the 6th harmonic of<br/>the root, the 5th harmonic of the mediant, and the 4th harmonic of the<br/>5th, are the same note), if this lowest common overtone is a sort<br/>of &apos;upper fundamental&apos; of a subharmonic series.
