If you are not aware of the International Foundation for<br/>Music Research, I hope that you will visit their web site<br/>(<a href="http://www.music-research.org/">http://www.music-research.org/</a>) and consider submitting a proposal.<br/>IFMR will fund research for periods of one, two, or three years in<br/>amounts ranging from $20,000 to $100,000.  The organization was a<br/>sponsor for the 8th International Conference on Music Perception &amp;<br/>Cognition, hosted here at Northwestern University at the beginning of<br/>August.  As conference organizer for ICMPC8, I can tell you that<br/>their generous support was a crucial component in the success of the<br/>conference.</p><p>For your convenience, I have attached a copy of the Request for<br/>Proposals document.  If you have any general questions about IFMR or<br/>more specific questions about the proposal process, you can contact<br/>an IFMR representative at: IFMR@....</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Scott Lipscomb, ICMPC8 Conference Organizer<br/>Associate Professor, Music Education &amp; Music Technology<br/>Northwestern University</p><p>****************************************************************<br/>Dr. Scott D.
