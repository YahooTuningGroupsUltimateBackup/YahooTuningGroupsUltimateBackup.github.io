He has discovered the common ground<br/>   of mathematics and art upon which he has placed his own<br/>   creativity. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt; I refuse to be diminished by being described as just<br/>   a mathematician, by being described as just a sculptor<br/>   -- I persist in both &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="http://www.helasculpt.com/">http://www.helasculpt.com/</a></p><p>--------------------------<br/>Integer relation algorithm<br/>--------------------------</p><p>&lt;&lt; Let x = (x1, x2, ... , xn) be a vector of real numbers. x is<br/>   said to possess an integer relation if there exist integers<br/>   ai not all zero such that a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = 0. By<br/>   an integer relation algorithm, we mean an algorithm that is<br/>   guaranteed (provided the computer implementation has sufficient<br/>   numeric precision) to recover the vector of integers ai, if it<br/>   exists, or to produce bounds within which no integer relation<br/>   can exist &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt; The problem of finding integer relations among a set of<br/>   real numbers was first studied by Euclid, who gave an<br/>   iterative algorithm (the Euclidean algorithm), which when<br/>   applied to two real numbers, either terminates, yielding<br/>   an exact relation, or produces an infinite sequence of<br/>   approximate relations. The generalization of this problem<br/>   for n &gt; 2 has been attempted by Euler, Jacobi, Poincare,<br/>   Minkowski, Perron, Brun, Bernstein, among others. However,<br/>   none of their algorithms has been proven to work for n &gt; 3,<br/>   and numerous counterexamples have been found. The first<br/>   integer relation algorithm with the desired properties<br/>   mentioned above was discovered by Ferguson and Forcade in<br/>   1977. In the intervening years a number of other integer<br/>   relation algorithms have been discovered, including the<br/>   &quot;LLL&quot; algorithm, the &quot;HJLS&quot; algorithm, and the &quot;PSOS&quot;<br/>   algorithm. &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/bailey/paper/html/node2.html">http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/bailey/paper/html/node2.html</a></p><p>&lt;&lt; Brun&apos;s algorithm is a natural generalization of Euclid<br/>   anthyphairesis(*) from a pair of number to a list of numbers.<br/>   This generalization is rediscovered by almost everyone<br/>   working in this area. [..] Brun&apos;s algorithm can cycle and<br/>   does not always find relations. However, according to a<br/>   theorem of Forcade, Brun&apos;s algorithm find relations almost<br/>   everywhere. &gt;&gt;</p><p>(*) anthyphairesis means &lt;&lt; continually subtracted in turn from &gt;&gt;</p><p>Analysis of PSLQ, an Integer Relation Finding Algorithm<br/>Helaman R.P.
