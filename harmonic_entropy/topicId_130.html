My basic question for the ranking of each chord was, &quot;Would I want to<br/>hear a piece of tonal music end on this chord?&quot;  I&apos;m sure that focus influenced my<br/>ratings, as did my dislike for beating harmonies, no doubt.</p><p>If I understand Paul correctly, his ordering was not meant to show how the current<br/>state of harmonic entropy theory would rate these according to sensory consonance,<br/>and the purpose of making the files was not to have others offer their own ordering<br/>by sensory consonance.  Nevertheless, I don&apos;t know how else to go about demonstrating<br/>my response to a list of tetrads in the context of harmonic entropy.  Whatever the<br/>purpose was, it surely is helpful to be able to listen to the numbers!  Thank you<br/>both very much.</p><p> TL      My<br/>order | order | Intrvls cents | Name (mostly Paul&apos;s, some mine)</p><p>22-23    1    388  702   970  Just 7-limit M-m7th<br/>20-21    2    204  702  1020  2nd inv. just minor over its subdominant<br/>5        3    498  886  1384  Open-voiced just m7 (9:12:15:20)<br/>7-8      4    498  702   886  2nd inv. just major add 9<br/>1        5    386  702  1088  Just M7th<br/>3-4      6    388  702   886  Just major add 6th<br/>3-4      7    184  498   886  2nd Inv. just major add 6<br/>2        8    316  702  1018  Just m7<br/>9-10     9    386  884  1088  2nd inv. just major over its subdominant<br/>25-26   10    202  702   974  8:9:12:14<br/>14-15   11    186  576   888  Tempered M-m7<br/>16-17   12    388  888  1390  Jazz add6-add9<br/>16-17   13    502 1002  1390  Tempered Carol King chord<br/>24      14    388  886  1274  5-limit augmented octave tetrad<br/>20-21   15    318  816  1020  1st inv. just major add9<br/>22-23   16    268  582   970  Just half dim.

The reason I ranked them &quot;low&quot; is because they have a lot of emotional<br/>tension.</p><p>I have a feeling that my lower 10 or so could easily change order if a somewhat<br/>different (but still harmonic) timbre were used, or even if I listened to them in a<br/>different order, though I did quite a bit of back-and-forth comparisons up and down<br/>the list.  I expect that my top 10-20 would stay mostly in place.</p><p>You can thank Apple for my opportunity to do this so soon.  While I have been working<br/>12-15 hrs/day, seven days/week for the last two weeks right up through yesterday, the<br/>&quot;trusty&quot; Mac 8100 at my work crashed often enough that I had the chance to listen to<br/>and rate a few chords at a time on the (cable modem connected, 750 MHz) Windows<br/>machine while the Mac rebooted.  And I get paid for this? ;-)</p><p>--<br/>David J.

I did the experiment as blindly as possible.  My<br/>choices were noted on paper by writing down only the Lab order<br/>number, adding &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to the tied pairs, according to which was<br/>listed first on the Lab page.  I didn&apos;t even read the descriptions<br/>until after I had given my &quot;final answer.&quot;  I also went back through<br/>them by my order earlier today, making sure that each sounded at<br/>least as dissonant as the previous one.</p><p>Note to self: sleep first, post later. :-)</p><p>-David</p></div><h3><a id=301 href="#301">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I think it&apos;s<br/>great that it&apos;s on as commercial a service as <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, since maybe<br/>somebody with half a brain will land on it by &quot;mistake&quot; and learn<br/>something from it...  It&apos;s true that maybe &quot;streaming&quot; isn&apos;t the best<br/>method, but, in HI-FI mode it really isn&apos;t all that bad.  One still<br/>can get a sense of the concordance, I believe...</p><p>I&apos;ve been comparing the new Tenney ordering to the &quot;geometric mean&quot;<br/>ordering which, as you know, is my &quot;bible&quot;  (probably rather<br/>foolishly, but I *did* like the sound of that ordering...)</p><p>Some things, of course, as you yourself mentioned, come out more<br/>reasonably... like the 4:5:6:7 being now ranked #8-9.  I feel much<br/>better about that...  Regarding your OWN 22-tET stacked fourths,<br/>0___492___980___1472... I was wondering how it ever managed to jump<br/>up to #2 slot... since it was &apos;way down the line on the geometric<br/>mean ranking.  True, it was closer to the &quot;top&quot; on the original<br/>diadic<br/>sum rankings...</p><p>Still, there are some notable deviations from the geometric mean<br/>ranking, that STILL stay quite distinct from it.  0__318__816__1020<br/>is still at 20-21 on the new 6*pi ranking, where it is number 2 on<br/>the geometric mean...</p><p>Likewise, 0__202__702__974 is now at #25-26, whereas it is #4 on the<br/>geometric mean.  Since the geometric mean seemed to be my &quot;favorite,&quot;<br/>it is hard for me (yet) to agree with the new ordering...</p><p>My first impression is that the new ordering really just &quot;mixes up&quot;<br/>some of the things... with some chords that were originally ranked<br/>less concordant (like the 4:5:6:7) than they should be moving into<br/>more &quot;appropriate&quot; slots, BUT OTHERS, that were ranked less concordant<br/>(like the stacked fourths) as maybe they should be now becoming<br/>suddenly maybe erroneously concordant!</p><p>Please let me know if there is any more work to be done on the Tuning<br/>Lab page with reference to the new Tenney ordering!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=303 href="#303">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2000 6:31:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@egroups.com">harmonic_entropy@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot;<br/>&lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The ordering now reflects the new &quot;unbiased&quot; Tenney 6*pi<br/>&gt; exponential ranking was posted mid November...</p><p>Hmm . . . that might have been a bold step . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also took out the bit about the quartal 22-tET chords being in<br/>the<br/>&gt; wrong place, etc....</p><p>wrong place . . . remind me what that was about?
