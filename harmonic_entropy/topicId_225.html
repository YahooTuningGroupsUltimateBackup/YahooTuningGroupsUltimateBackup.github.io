For example, on the Tuning List we&apos;re used to seeing the 5-limit<br/>just major triad spelled 4:5:6.  On the discordance map you spelled it 6:5:4.  I<br/>assumed there was a good reason for that and followed your lead with my labels,<br/>although I haven&apos;t figured out what it is yet.  If it was an arbitrary decision,<br/>and if it&apos;s all the same to you, it would be less confusing for me to have them<br/>listed bottom up in the future.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

If you look at the entire<br/>pizza pie, though, every possible ordering comes up. For example, I labeled<br/>three of the six slices in<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/trimap.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/trimap.jpg</a>. 4:5:6 would show up<br/>in the slice on the lower-left.</p><p>This kind of representation is useful for calculating harmonic entropy, and<br/>also if the three voices in the chord have different, say, timbres.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3>David J.
