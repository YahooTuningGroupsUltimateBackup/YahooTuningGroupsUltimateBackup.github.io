Thank you.</p><p>hi there!</p><p>this is sort of an open-ended question . . . but your best bet is<br/>probably to begin by joining the tuning-math group,</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>and asking Gene Ward Smith, an accomplished mathematician with an<br/>excellent grasp of music theory. stick around here as well --<br/>interesting things may turn up, particularly if you dig through the<br/>archives and ask questions.</p><p>i&apos;m sure many interesting discussions will result . . .</p></div>
