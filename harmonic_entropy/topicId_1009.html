Exactly how<br/>to find them is another question.</p><p>As I recall, one problem was how to partition the 2-D plot of all<br/>triads according to JI.  The 1-D plot of JI dyads was partitioned<br/>with the Farey series and its mediants in the original dyadic h.e.<br/>implementation.  Paul tried voronoi cells on the 2-D plot, and you<br/>can see some those images in the files section here, I think.  I<br/>don&apos;t remember if a newer idea supercedes this.  IIRC, the Farey<br/>series has been replaced with a &apos;product limit&apos; in the dyadic case,<br/>and I think the idea was to extend this for chords, like,<br/>a*b*c for triad a:b:c.  Apparently, Paul knows what he wants to do,<br/>and is just waiting to get around do setting up his computer for<br/>some number-crunching.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
