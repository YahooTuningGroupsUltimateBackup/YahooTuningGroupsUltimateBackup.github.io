The &quot;stacked fourths&quot; chord<br/>0__492__980__1472 really does sound incredibly concordant.  The #2<br/>ranking on the new dyadic Tenney listing really reflects this.  It<br/>was unranked on the tetradic geometric mean list (not JI).</p><p>I thought tetrad #6-7: 0__502__1002__1390 should be more concordant<br/>than #6-7.  However, it was ranked #10 on the tetradic geometric<br/>mean, so *neither* list seemed to make it as concordant as I wanted<br/>it to be!</p><p>Tetrad #8-9: 0__388__702__970 should be near the most concordant in<br/>my listening experience.  As 4:5:6:7, it is ranked at the TOP of the<br/>tetradic geometric mean list, so that listing does a better job with<br/>it!</p><p>Tetrad #11-12: 0__498__702__886 should be ranked a *bit* more<br/>concordant.  It was #3 on the tetradic geometric mean list, so that<br/>list did a better job with it.</p><p>Tetrad #15-16:  0__302__502__1004 seemed like it should be ranked a<br/>*bit* more concordant.  This one is not JI, so it is &quot;unranked&quot; on<br/>the tetradic geometric mean list.</p><p>Tetrad #17-18:  0__204__702__1088 should be ranked as more<br/>concordant. It is #5 on the tetradic geometric mean list, which does<br/>a better job</p><p>Tetrad #20-21:  0__318__816__1020 should be ranked *MUCH* more<br/>concordant than this.  (It&apos;s the 5:6:8:9).  The tetradic geo list was<br/>*MUCH* better with this one it was #2.</p><p>Tetrad #27-28:  0__502__1002__1320 should be ranked more concordant.<br/>It&apos;s exactly the same on the tetradic geo list, #28, so *neither* is<br/>so satisfactory to me</p><p>Tetrad #31-32:  0__388__776__1090 should be ranked more concordant.<br/>It&apos;s #17 tetradic geo, so that list did a better job, to my ear.</p><p>Tetrad #33:  0__388__886__1274 should be ranked more concordant.<br/>It&apos;s #13 on the tetradic geo list, so the geo list did a better job on<br/>that one.</p><p>_____________ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Paul H.
