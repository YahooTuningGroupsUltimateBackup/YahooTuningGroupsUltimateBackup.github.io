Other than<br/>that, I have no idea what you could mean.</p><p>&gt; 2.

If you want to express the difference tones as ratios,<br/>you need to specify a reference pitch from which these ratios will be<br/>measured. The easiest way is to express the chord you mention as<br/>10:24:45 (which puts the fundamental 1 at Ab-2, 4 octaves below Ab2),<br/>and then calculate the difference tones: 24-10 = 14, 45-10 = 35, and 45-<br/>24 = 21. Relative to the chord in question, these notes would be a flat<br/>Gb2, a flat Bb3 (a wolf fifth up from the Eb), and a flat Db3.</p><p>&gt; 12-7, 15-8, and 9-2).   This seems a little bit unusual, and  I was<br/>&gt; wondering if there is any psychoacoustical effect you guys are aware<br/>&gt; of that results from a congruence of difference tones.</p><p>This chord doesn&apos;t have coinciding difference tones, but does have<br/>difference tones which are the second, third, and fifth harmonics of a<br/>flat Gb1. Hence, if the chord is played in true JI, due to<br/>psychoacoustic effects I might expect to hear a suggestion of a flat<br/>Gb1 pitch emerging when the chord is ramped up in amplitude. Very<br/>interesting! Of course, there are other difference tones that are often<br/>louder than these &apos;primary&apos; ones . . .</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2005 6:54:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kelly,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt; hello Entropy group (Paul, Carl, et al...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

This seems a little bit unusual, and  I was<br/>&gt; wondering if there is any psychoacoustical effect you guys are aware<br/>&gt; of that results from a congruence of difference tones.</p><p>I think Paul has given a good answer to the second question.  He has also<br/>answered the first one, but I have a slightly different answer - you&apos;re<br/>confused! :-)  Let me explain why I think so.</p><p>Look at &quot;the chord c-e-a, with the intervals 5/4, 4/3, and 5/3&quot;.  What<br/>does this really mean?  Let&apos;s draw up a table of the numbers involved -</p><p>   c  :  e  :  a<br/>=  4  :  5  :  x   &lt;-- interval 4:5 or 5/4<br/>=  y  :  3  :  4   &lt;-- interval 3:4 or 4/3<br/>= 12 : 15 : 20  &lt;-- see below<br/>=  3  :  z  :  5   &lt;-- interval 3:5 or 5/3</p><p>This is important:  All the lines in this table express the same ratios.<br/>So I&apos;ve written = signs to connect them all.</p><p>The major third c:e has the ratio 4:5.</p><p>The fourth e:a has the ratio 3:4.  Since we couldn&apos;t write it as a simple<br/>ratio 5: some integer, I just put down x for the time being in the first<br/>row.</p><p>Similarly, I put down y for the number such that y:3 is the major third<br/>4:5.  And z for the number such that 3:z is also the major third.</p><p>Now I could solve immediately for x, y and z, just by rearranging terms<br/>in the three independent equations 5:x = 3:4, y:3 = 4:5 and 3:z = 4:5.</p><p>But it&apos;s more _fun_ to write down the LCM (least common multiple) of<br/>the two numbers we know in the middle column - that&apos;s 15, then multiply<br/>the first two rows by 15/those two numbers in turn, that&apos;s by 15/5=3<br/>for the first row, and by 15/3=5 for the second row, but ignoring the<br/>unknowns.  This gives the numbers in the third row -<br/>4*3=12, 5*3=15; also 3*5=15, 4*5=20.</p><p>If we ignore the middle note e, the remaining two numbers are 12 and<br/>20, which have a common factor of 4, so are in the ratio 3:5.  So the<br/>fourth row expresses that, confirming that a major sixth is the ratio<br/>3:5, and leaving z for the corresponding number for e.</p><p>From a mathematical point of view, it&apos;s interesting that you can use a<br/>similar technique to find the interval ratio between any two notes which<br/>are separated by a set of known interval ratios, staying entirely within<br/>the realm of integers.  This is only really important if you are a<br/>mathematician of a particular logical persuasion - those who &quot;don&apos;t<br/>believe in&quot; fractions (rational numbers) or any other numbers except<br/>the natural counting numbers.  I was told such people exist - I forget<br/>the name for them (it might be Amish?).  However, for mere mortals who<br/>get confused at times by the arithmetic of fractions, it&apos;s a useful<br/>way of dealing mostly with whole numbers instead.</p><p>Now, where I think you might have been confused is where you said &quot;the<br/>center note e ... is represented by the number 3, as the lower note of<br/>4/3, and by the number 5, as the upper note of 5/4.&quot;  Please note that it<br/>can&apos;t be represented by both numbers _at the same time_.  Numbers<br/>don&apos;t work like that!  :-)</p><p>The note e is represented by 3, _only when_ the note a is represented<br/>by 4; that is, on the second row in the table.</p><p>And the note e is represented by 5, _only when_ the note c is<br/>represented by 4; that is, on the first row in the table.</p><p>If both these representations were true at the same time, then both c<br/>and a would be represented by the same number 4 - even though they<br/>are different notes!</p><p>Each row of the table is a different representation of the chord c:e:a.<br/>The most informative is the one with no unknowns in it and all in<br/>integers, that is 12:15:20.  In this row, the note e is represented by 15,<br/>and we can easily reduce the ratios 12:15 and 15:20 by removing<br/>common factors, to 4:5 and 3:4 respectively, confirming that we do<br/>indeed have a third below and a fourth above the note e.</p><p>We can get another representation - Paul&apos;s - by dividing this one<br/>through by their LCM, which is 60, getting 1/5:1/4:1/3.  (This represents<br/>the minor triad by the reciprocals of the numbers in the major triad<br/>g:c:e &apos;s representation as 3:4:5.)  As Paul rightly commented, the fifth<br/>harmonic of the lowest note c, the fourth harmonic of the middle note e,<br/>and the third harmonic of the highest note a, will all coincide at the<br/>same note, two octaves above the e of your chord.  This follows because<br/>the chord formed by these harmonics is 5*1/5:4*1/4:3*1/3, which<br/>equals 1:1:1, a unison chord.</p><p>Your question &quot;Does this mean, in some sense, that there is a sort of<br/>mixing of waveforms in that note (of the third and fifth harmonic)?&quot;<br/>can be answered by saying, &quot;Yes, the fifth harmonic _of the lowest<br/>chord tone_ and the third harmonic _of the highest chord tone_ will<br/>coincide with the fourth harmonic (the double octave) of the middle<br/>chord tone.  Further, if they happen to be in phase, they may reinforce<br/>each other, making the double octave of the middle chord tone more<br/>prominent; however, if they happen to be opposite in phase, they may<br/>cancel each other, making the double octave of the middle chord tone<br/>less prominent or even absent.&quot;</p><p>We really do need to qualify what the third and fifth harmonics are<br/>harmonics _of_, as in the answer above.  Suppose we had any<br/>fundamental tone, say the note R=100 Hz.  Its fiRst, Second, Third,<br/>foUrth and fifth harmonics are the notes R, S=200 Hz, T=300 Hz,<br/>U=400 Hz and V=500 Hz.  The chord T:U:V = 300:400:500 which in turn<br/> = 3:4:5.  So T:U is a fourth and U:V is a major third, and the chord is<br/>just the same as the C major triad in second inversion, G:C:E, only<br/>transposed into &quot;the key of U&quot;.  The note names don&apos;t matter, but the<br/>ratios do.  The fundamental tone - R in our example in the key of U - is<br/>implied by the 3:4:5 major triad, in the sense that it is the highest note<br/>of which all the chord notes are harmonics.</p><p>I wonder whether perhaps, when you asked your question, you were<br/>thinking of the third and fifth harmonics of the fundamental tone in<br/>a 3:4:5 major triad?  Because in the context of your example of the<br/>A minor triad in second inversion, C:E:A, you have a different set of<br/>ratios, namely 1/5:1/4:1/3, or in whole numbers, 12:15:20.  The<br/>fundamental tone implied by these three integers is the one of which<br/>the note C is the 12th harmonic, the note E is the 15th harmonic and the<br/>note A is the 20th harmonic.  That makes it three octaves and a fifth<br/>below the C, that is, the note F.  I don&apos;t at all suppose you were thinking<br/>of the third and fifth harmonics of that F.</p><p>---</p><p>What were the numbers x, y and z?</p><p>If you insist on representing the note e by 5, then you need to use the<br/>representation 4:5:x - the first row of the table, and find out what<br/>value of x makes 5:x the same ratio as 3:4.  That is, what x is when<br/>5/x=3/4.  The answer is that x=5*4/3=20/3.</p><p>But if you want to represent the note e by 3, then you need to use the<br/>representation y:3:4 - the second row of the table, and find out what<br/>value of y makes y:3 the same ratio as 4:5.  That is, what y is when<br/>y/3=4/5.  The answer is that y=3*4/5=12/5.</p><p>(Of course you can&apos;t use both these representations at the same time.)</p><p>From the last row, it turns out that z=3*5/4=15/4.  There&apos;s a curious<br/>pattern here - All three integers 3, 4 and 5 of your ratios appear once<br/>each in x, y and z, and they all have the form (3*4*5)/(n*n), where n is<br/>in turn each of 3, 4 and 5.  I guess this pattern would generalise to<br/>other sets of relatively prime integers, and perhaps to any 3 integers<br/>p, q, r if we replace the product (p*q*r) by their LCM, thus -<br/>LCM(p, q, r)/(n*n), where n is in turn each of p, q and r.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.10.17/84 - Release Date: 29/8/05</p></div><h3>traktus5 &#x3C;kj4321@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2005 12:11:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow!  what an amazing answer, Yahya!   There&apos;s a lot there for me to<br/>think about...and much that you opened up.   (Thanks to you, too,<br/>Paul.)  I get so &apos;microscopically&apos; into listening to the chords,<br/>trance-like, writing progressions with them, trying to imagine what<br/>the wave forms might look like, and what the numbers might have to<br/>do with it, that I guess I play amateur scientist here, which math<br/>laymen tend to do with number patterns.   So I feel rather foolish<br/>posting here.  (I do it because I have learned some things here.)<br/>But I can see you really made an attempt to make sense of where I<br/>was going, or not going!, which I appreciate.  (I can see you like<br/>number patters too! )</p><p>The pattern that most interested me with this lovely chord c-e-a<br/>(and then I&apos;ll drop it) is when you represent each note (in my<br/>fallacious fashion, but please hear me out) with a fraction, giving<br/>4/3, 5/3, and 5/4 (corresponding to c, e, and a, in the fashion<br/>discussed, with each fraction representing the overlap of the two<br/>intervals on that note.)   I looked at many many chords in that<br/>fashion, and I believe c-e-a is the only one that has it&apos;s &apos;harmonic<br/>numbers&apos; 3-4-5  represented in the fractions (starting with the<br/>demoninators, and moving up to the numerators, ie, 3,3,4,4,5,5.) I<br/>imagine there is an obvious reason for this, embedded in your<br/>answer, which I promise to study and respond to (--summer reading<br/>for my upcoming vaction!)...but can you think of any reason why the<br/>chord c-e-a would be the only chord which has that feature?  (ISn&apos;t<br/>this the only traditional type chrod which can be represented by<br/>numbers 5 and under?)  (I understand if you consider this to not<br/>even be significant feature to comment on, due to a flawed method!)</p><p>(The pattern also appealed to me because it reminded me of the<br/>ancient but highly accurate approximation of pi: 355/113, which, as<br/>Martin Gardner pointed out, has a simple number pattern (1,3,5) read<br/>from left to right, denominators to numerators.)</p><p>I will work on learning your method, and ...</p><p>cheers, Kelly</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/yahoogroups">@yahoogroups</a>.com, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Kelly,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; hello Entropy group (Paul, Carl, et al...)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1.

The note names don&apos;t matter, but<br/>the<br/>&gt; ratios do.  The fundamental tone - R in our example in the key of<br/>U - is<br/>&gt; implied by the 3:4:5 major triad, in the sense that it is the<br/>highest note<br/>&gt; of which all the chord notes are harmonics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder whether perhaps, when you asked your question, you were<br/>&gt; thinking of the third and fifth harmonics of the fundamental tone<br/>in<br/>&gt; a 3:4:5 major triad?  Because in the context of your example of the<br/>&gt; A minor triad in second inversion, C:E:A, you have a different set<br/>of<br/>&gt; ratios, namely 1/5:1/4:1/3, or in whole numbers, 12:15:20.  The<br/>&gt; fundamental tone implied by these three integers is the one of<br/>which<br/>&gt; the note C is the 12th harmonic, the note E is the 15th harmonic<br/>and the<br/>&gt; note A is the 20th harmonic.  That makes it three octaves and a<br/>fifth<br/>&gt; below the C, that is, the note F.  I don&apos;t at all suppose you were<br/>thinking<br/>&gt; of the third and fifth harmonics of that F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What were the numbers x, y and z?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you insist on representing the note e by 5, then you need to<br/>use the<br/>&gt; representation 4:5:x - the first row of the table, and find out<br/>what<br/>&gt; value of x makes 5:x the same ratio as 3:4.  That is, what x is<br/>when<br/>&gt; 5/x=3/4.  The answer is that x=5*4/3=20/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if you want to represent the note e by 3, then you need to use<br/>the<br/>&gt; representation y:3:4 - the second row of the table, and find out<br/>what<br/>&gt; value of y makes y:3 the same ratio as 4:5.  That is, what y is<br/>when<br/>&gt; y/3=4/5.  The answer is that y=3*4/5=12/5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Of course you can&apos;t use both these representations at the same<br/>time.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From the last row, it turns out that z=3*5/4=15/4.  There&apos;s a<br/>curious<br/>&gt; pattern here - All three integers 3, 4 and 5 of your ratios appear<br/>once<br/>&gt; each in x, y and z, and they all have the form (3*4*5)/(n*n),<br/>where n is<br/>&gt; in turn each of 3, 4 and 5.  I guess this pattern would generalise<br/>to<br/>&gt; other sets of relatively prime integers, and perhaps to any 3<br/>integers<br/>&gt; p, q, r if we replace the product (p*q*r) by their LCM, thus -<br/>&gt; LCM(p, q, r)/(n*n), where n is in turn each of p, q and r.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>&gt; Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>&gt; Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.10.17/84 - Release Date:<br/>29/8/05</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2005 6:42:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;</p><p>&gt; Your question &quot;Does this mean, in some sense, that there is a sort<br/>of<br/>&gt; mixing of waveforms in that note (of the third and fifth harmonic)?&quot;<br/>&gt; can be answered by saying, &quot;Yes, the fifth harmonic _of the lowest<br/>&gt; chord tone_ and the third harmonic _of the highest chord tone_ will<br/>&gt; coincide with the fourth harmonic (the double octave) of the middle<br/>&gt; chord tone.

(I can see you like<br/>&gt; number patters too! )</p><p>Right on both counts.</p><p>&gt; The pattern that most interested me with this lovely chord c-e-a<br/>&gt; (and then I&apos;ll drop it) is when you represent each note (in my<br/>&gt; fallacious fashion, but please hear me out) with a fraction, giving<br/>&gt; 4/3, 5/3, and 5/4 (corresponding to c, e, and a, in the fashion<br/>&gt; discussed, with each fraction representing the overlap of the two<br/>&gt; intervals on that note.)   ...</p><p>I&apos;d say, rather, with each fraction being the only interval in the<br/>chord that does not involve that note.</p><p>Let&apos;s make a chord by stacking two intervals, a:b and c:d, where<br/>a &lt; b and c &lt; d.  For concreteness, we play the chord on the bass note<br/>R=100 Hz.  So the second note is at 100*(b/a) Hz, and the third note<br/>is at 100*(b/a)*(d/c).  The interval from the first note to the third<br/>is therefore 100*(b/a)*(d/c)/100, or (b/a)*(d/c).  If we use any<br/>other bass note in place of R, the interval will still always be the same<br/>ratio (b/a)*(d/c).</p><p>In the case of the c:e:a chord, the intervals are 4:5, 3: 4 and 3:5.<br/>That is, the interval ratios are 5/4, 4/3 and (5/4)*(4/3)=5/3.  In<br/>this product, you see that the two middle terms cancel, since they<br/>have the same value, namely 4.  A similar thing would happen whenever<br/>the two middle terms in the product (b/a)*(d/c) for our general triad<br/>(comprising intervals a:b and c:d) are equal - that is, whenever a=d.<br/>We&apos;d have the three intervals a:b, c:a and c:b.  So this pattern quite<br/>neatly generalises your 3, 4, 5 chord - and works for any three<br/>integers c &lt; a &lt; b.  As you pointed out in a later message to Paul, you<br/>can also build a chord like this using 4, 5, 6.  But you could equally<br/>well choose to use any other triple of integers at all.  Try this triple:<br/>(5, 12, 13) - inspired by your Pythagorean example of (3, 4, 5)  :-)<br/>Or this: (1, 2, 3) - this gives you a very ancient consonance involving<br/>only an octave, a fifth and a twelfth - not a third in sight!  Or again,<br/>(2, 3, 4) - a fifth, a fourth and an octave.  Good Lord, we&apos;ve invented<br/>organum ...  But your first and simplest &quot;traditional&quot; (tertian) chord<br/>does arise from the triple (3, 4, 5) as you say below. If you like small<br/>numbers, this one&apos;s hard to beat.</p><p>&gt; ... I looked at many many chords in that<br/>&gt; fashion, and I believe c-e-a is the only one that has it&apos;s &apos;harmonic<br/>&gt; numbers&apos; 3-4-5  represented in the fractions (starting with the<br/>&gt; demoninators, and moving up to the numerators, ie, 3,3,4,4,5,5.) I<br/>&gt; imagine there is an obvious reason for this, embedded in your<br/>&gt; answer, which I promise to study and respond to (--summer reading<br/>&gt; for my upcoming vaction!)...but can you think of any reason why the<br/>&gt; chord c-e-a would be the only chord which has that feature?  (ISn&apos;t<br/>&gt; this the only traditional type chrod which can be represented by<br/>&gt; numbers 5 and under?)  ...</p><p>See above.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; (The pattern also appealed to me because it reminded me of the<br/>&gt; ancient but highly accurate approximation of pi: 355/113, which, as<br/>&gt; Martin Gardner pointed out, has a simple number pattern (1,3,5) read<br/>&gt; from left to right, denominators to numerators.)</p><p>I don&apos;t ascribe any particular significance to this digit pattern -<br/>what would it be if we counted in eights or twelves instead of tens?<br/>8-0</p><p>&gt; I will work on learning your method, and ...</p><p>Gosh, it was just a _pattern_ I saw ...:-)</p><p>&gt; cheers, Kelly</p><p>All the best<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.10.18/89 - Release Date: 2/9/05</p></div><h3>traktus5 &#x3C;kj4321@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2005 12:04:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Rarer?

And given that any triad has three<br/>such subsets, and any tetrad has six, gives the brain a wealth of<br/>potential roots to use.  No wonder that, very often, we simply can&apos;t<br/>make up our minds which is the &quot;real&quot; root of a chord.  And this very<br/>ambiguity provides the composer with an important tool, which,<br/>carefully used, can heighten or lessen the tensions and uncertainty<br/>we feel as a piece progresses, helping to shape the piece into a more<br/>satisfying experience.</p><p>As for two numbers representing the same note, my point was simply<br/>that they can&apos;t do so _at the same time_.  When we are uncertain<br/>exactly how to analyse the chord, our perceptions of that note may<br/>switch back-and-forth quite rapidly, even several times a second,<br/>between two or even more interpretations.  In one interpretation,<br/>we use one of the numbers, and in another, another.</p><p>If we take a chord superficially quite similar to your c-e-a, namely<br/>e-a-c#, we have a situtation where the fourth (3:4) from e to a,<br/>and the major third (4:5) from a to c#, use exactly the same<br/>number (4) to represent the middle note a.  The whole chord is<br/>3:4:5; taking any dyad from it, whether 3:4, 4:5, or 3:5, we find<br/>that each of them implies the same root (1), two octaves below our<br/>a.  This second inversion of the major triad thus gives a very firmly<br/>rooted impression; it&apos;s hard to think of it as anything _but_ an A<br/>major chord.  This is a very different effect from your c-e-a<br/>chord (or any other first inversion of a minor triad, which must<br/>have the same ratios).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.11.5/110 - Release Date: 22/9/05</p></div>
