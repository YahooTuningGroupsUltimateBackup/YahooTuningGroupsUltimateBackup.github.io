I wouldn&apos;t need to &quot;understand it&quot; in terms<br/>of knowing why one wants to use that formula, just need to<br/>know what the formula is that needs to be calculated.</p><p>Or as pseudo code if that is clearer.</p><p>Sorry, got a lot to think about at present, but may get to it<br/>eventually, most likely once I get to working on the chords<br/>section of FTS, as I might then be thinking about what counts<br/>as a consonant chord anyway, and want to read a bit about some<br/>of the various theories that have been developed for that.</p><p>That would be after first getting FTS 1.09 beta done and<br/>released, the messages archiver finished, the FAQ tree program<br/>done, and VRML trees released, and a few other things<br/>that take less time. (at least that is my plan and order of<br/>priorities at present)</p><p>However, if you can present an easy to read algorithm, and if<br/>I think it would take very little time to program, I could do<br/>it on one of my &quot;days off&quot; as it were. Maybe. I have other things<br/>of that nature I also want to do, and your algorithm doesn&apos;t<br/>directly relate to anything I&apos;m involved in doing right now.</p><p>I think though, also, if doing as distributed computing, one would<br/>like to take a bit of care and thought to make sure the program<br/>will work nicely, exit gracefully and immediately when needed,<br/>regularly saves to disk to avoid losing info, and so on.</p><p>Might take a little while, possibly more than one would think<br/>at first, these things do sometimes become rather open ended.</p><p>I wonder if there are any other programmers who would like to<br/>take up the challenge instead in the interim?</p><p>One could just write a program that takes a list of coords<br/>as data, and for each one calculates the values and outputs<br/>them, could be a console app. Something like that<br/>wouldn&apos;t take much programming. Then another program that<br/>just makes a series of data files for the first one:</p><p>data1.txt<br/>data2.txt<br/>data3.txt<br/>etc.</p><p>You send some of the data files to the recipients who are<br/>interested in running it in the background, console app<br/>goes through it&apos;s working directory looking for all files<br/>of type data*.txt, looks for any that lack a matching<br/>output*.txt, reads each in turn, and outputs to output*.txt</p><p>When it is actually working on data, every second or so,<br/>outputs to the console so you can see it is still<br/>doing something, even if it is just &quot;Still running&quot;.<br/>or &quot;Time so far for this session %d secs&quot; or whatever.</p><p>When none are left to do, you are finished, and to indicate<br/>that, program shows a message &quot;Finished&quot; and stops.</p><p>User then sends the data back to you, and you send them some<br/>more input files to process.</p><p>One wouldn&apos;t need to be a windows programmer to do that.</p><p>One needs to take account of possibility that the user shuts<br/>the computer down while program is in the middle<br/>of making one of the output files.</p><p>To cope with that, first save each one as output1~.txt,<br/>and only copy it to output1.txt when it is complete. So,<br/>if shut down unexpectedly while making output1~.txt, then next<br/>session, will look for output1.txt, not find it,<br/>and so start again. Not very sophisticated, but<br/>would work.</p><p>If I did do a fast job of it at some point, I suppose that<br/>is how I&apos;d do it, and could do it, but wouldn&apos;t want<br/>to promise anything at present.</p><p>But, maybe this is a useful idea, maybe I can help in that<br/>way by suggesting it?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
