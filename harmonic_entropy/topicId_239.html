It goes along with the graphic:</p><p>triangle_01dfinn_01.jpg</p><p>and the accompanying sound file:</p><p>ridgeglide1.mp3</p><p>Both these files reside in the directory:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/harmonic_entropy/Finnamore/">http://www.egroups.com/files/harmonic_entropy/Finnamore/</a></p><p>This is truly a GREAT multimedia harmonic entropy experience!</p><p>HOWEVER, &quot;Density 21.5&quot; (me) found the following explanation David<br/>wrote up to be quite useful:</p><p>1)  You&apos;re probably used to looking at harmonic<br/>lattices, and may be trying to interpret this one<br/>similarly, as I did at first.  But it actually has a<br/>completely different basis.  For one thing, a triad on<br/>a harmonic lattice forms a triangle between three<br/>points; on this triangular discordance map,<br/>ironically, each triad is located at a single point,<br/>_not_ between 3 points.  Each unique point on the map<br/>(there is a theoretically infinite number) is a unique<br/>triad whose outer interval is no more than 2:1, and<br/>all possible such triads are represented on the map.</p><p>2)  We&apos;re all used to seeing triads listed from the<br/>bottom up.  For some reason I have not been able to<br/>divine, Paul chose to list them top down on this map.<br/>So at a glance, 6:5:4 looks like the minor 5-limit<br/>triad but it&apos;s really the major 5-limit one.  It&apos;s the<br/>one that is normally displayed 4:5:6 on the Tuning<br/>List.  It would be less confusing for me if we did it<br/>that way.  I guess I should ask Paul about it.  He may<br/>have a good reason.</p><p>3)  The map can be split into otonal and utonal halves<br/>by drawing a line from the 1:1:1 to the center of the<br/>side that opposes the 1:1:1 corner, half-way between<br/>4:3:2 and 6:4:3.  Rotating the map so that 1:1:1 faces<br/>straight South, the left side is otonal and the right<br/>side is its utonal mirror image.  Once Paul is able to<br/>map actual triadic harmonic entropy, the utonal side<br/>will have lower hill tops than the otonal side.<br/>Tenney discordance ranks them equally.</p><p>4)  Everything is relative, which is why I was able to<br/>keep the bottom note the same for convenience (a<br/>convenience which was displeasing to Paul and Jon!<br/>8-).  Here&apos;s what I mean by that.  Let&apos;s call the 3<br/>numbers C:B:A (since they&apos;re listed &quot;backwards&quot;  to us<br/>and I&apos;m hoping Paul is willing to switch in the<br/>future).  Using the beginning of the ridgetop tour as<br/>an example, when we move from 3:2:2 to 12:9:8 (which<br/>is labeled on my version of the map), the outer tones,<br/>C and A, hold their pitches steady in a 3:2<br/>relationship and only the middle one, B, moves.  B<br/>starts in unison with A (2:2) and slides upward as we<br/>move Northwest along the ridge.  You might think that<br/>the next chord should be some form of 3:B:2.  So<br/>what&apos;s up with the 12 and 8?  Well, actually 12:8 is<br/>the same thing as 3:2, right?  Look across that whole<br/>line from 3:2:2 to 3:3:2 - notice that in all six<br/>chords labeled on my version, C:A is reducible to<br/>3:2.  In fact, no matter where you stop on that line,<br/>even where C:B and B:A are irrational, C:A maintains a<br/>3:2 relationship, even though it may be spelled 6:4,<br/>9:6, or 15:10; it could be spelled 8991:5994 - it&apos;s<br/>the same interval.  In this example we stop where B<br/>has climbed upward by 204 cents, from 2:2 (=1:1) to<br/>9:8 with respect to C.  Obviously, if C:B originally<br/>had a 3:2 relationship, and B climbed by 204 cents, it<br/>now has a 4:3 relationship.  So at this point on the<br/>map, C:A = 3:2, B:A = 9:8, and C:B = 4:3.  The<br/>smallest whole number relationship that represents all<br/>three of those intervals at once is 12:9:8.</p><p>Now notice that on all lines parallel to the 3:2:2 -<br/>3:3:2 line, C:A remains constant.  4:3:3 to 4:4:3 - so<br/>all points on that line represent triads in which C:A<br/>=  4:3 and B is somewhere in between.  In fact, all<br/>possible such triads lie on that line.  5:3:3 to 5:5:3<br/>- all points on this line have a 5:3 relationship<br/>between C and A, and B lies somewhere in between.<br/>Along the top line, C and A remain an octave apart and<br/>B slides from unison with A up to unison with C<br/>traveling from the East corner to the Northwest<br/>corner.</p><p>If you cross the map in any other direction than<br/>parallel to those lines, C:A will change relationship<br/>as you move.  Look at the Northeast running line from<br/>4:4:3 to 6:4:3 - what&apos;s the same there?  Right, and<br/>notice that in all triads on that line, B:A has a 4:3<br/>ratio.  Moving along that line or any line parallel to<br/>it, the C is the only tone in motion with respect to<br/>the other two.</p><p>Similarly, lines running straight North-South<br/>represent triads in which C:B remains constant and<br/>only the A moves with respect to the other two.  Since<br/>it&apos;s all relative, you can also keep A constant and<br/>move C and B together, keeping their relationship to<br/>each other constant but changing with respect to A.<br/>The latter is what happens in my &quot;tours&quot; to date.</p><p>Moving in any direction other than parallel to the<br/>sides, all three tones will change with respect to<br/>each other.  That happens only in the &quot;Short Tour.&quot;</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Since the equation on the graph<br/>includes the term &quot;Tenney,&quot;  I jumped to the conclusion that the<br/>graph represented concordance by his method of measure.  It seems<br/>like the term &quot;dyadic&quot; would be as opposed to &quot;triadic,&quot; and &quot;Tenney&quot;<br/>would be an alternative method to some other mathemetician&apos;s.  Is it<br/>possible to use Tenney&apos;s method to measure either dyadic or triadic<br/>concordance?
