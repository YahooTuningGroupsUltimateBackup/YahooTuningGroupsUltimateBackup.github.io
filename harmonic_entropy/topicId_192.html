Finnamore &#x3C;daeron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2000 8:25:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Now for a longer tour, if you&apos;re up for it.  This one feels more like an airplane ride -<br/>ascending for a while, cruising around a bit, then descending very gradually for a soft<br/>landing.  But it will be easier to describe it as a walk, or a glide, along the ridge tops.<br/>Cutting across the map without regard to ridges, as we did in the first tour, is easy.<br/>Surprisingly, it&apos;s a bit scary holding to the ridge tops.  If the short tour made you<br/>sea-sick, be sure to take your motion-sickness medicine now.</p><p>Looking at the graph &quot;triangle_01,&quot; find 3:2:2 around half way up the right side.  That&apos;s<br/>where we start.  We glide right along the top of the major ridge that heads Northwest, all<br/>the way to 3:3:2.  Making a hard right, we glide up the major ridge that leads to 4:3:2.  Up<br/>until now it&apos;s been all uphill - a 3:2 with the other tone ascending all the way from unison<br/>to octave.  Then we follow the edge down to 6:4:3.  From there we make a soft right and<br/>follow the third major ridge down to it&apos;s last big hilltop before the edge.  Another hard<br/>right, and we&apos;re following one of the minor ridges over to 20:15:12, up to the stack of<br/>fourths near top center (all downhill from here - a continuous 4:3 with other tone descending<br/>from 16:9 to unity), then make our first left hand turn of the day and follow the minor ridge<br/>Southwest, crossing our path at 9:8:6 and continuing on to 4:4:3 on the edge.  Now for the<br/>final turn, another hard left, to follow the lowest of the moderately large minor ridges<br/>across to our final destination of 4:3:3.</p><p>Along the way, we pause at most humps of any significance, as judged by their height compared<br/>to surrounding heights.  Each pause lasts 5 seconds, with 5 seconds of travel time in<br/>between.  Actually they&apos;re all slightly under 5 seconds.  That&apos;s because, at Paul&apos;s<br/>suggestion, I slightly mistuned each interval to prevent overtone phase lock.  These flangey<br/>triads are easier on the ear, but since each 5 second period starts with all partials in<br/>phase and ends in an arbitrary phase relationship, I had to edit out part of a cycle at each<br/>joint to prevent clicks and pops.  You&apos;ll still hear sudden timbre shifts at many joints;<br/>sometimes they even sound like sudden small pitch shifts but that&apos;s an aural illusion.  By<br/>the end we lose almost a second in edits.  It&apos;s still probably better than enduring phase<br/>lock.  At least you&apos;ll have little trouble discerning the boundary points!</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/harmonic_entropy/Finnamore/ridgeglide1.mp3">http://www.egroups.com/files/harmonic_entropy/Finnamore/ridgeglide1.mp3</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the itinerary.

Would it be easy to produce an alternative version, where<br/>depending on which direction you&apos;re going, different voices &quot;glide&quot;,<br/>instead of the bottom one always remaining at a fixed pitch? It seems this<br/>would go along with the symmetry of the Chalmers plot, which doesn&apos;t<br/>favour any one of the three intervals.</p><p>I can imagine two ways of doing this. First, if you move along the &quot;/&quot;<br/>side (as the triangle appears in<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/harmonic_entropy/Finnamore/triangle_01dfinn_01.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/harmonic_entropy/Finnamore/triangle_01dfinn_01.jpg</a><br/>, i.e.<br/>        2:2:1<br/>         |   \<br/>         |    \<br/>         |     \ 2:1:1<br/>         |     /<br/>         |    /<br/>         |   /<br/>        1:1:1</p><p>) then the interval between lower voices remains the same, so I would hold<br/>them constant and move the top voice. Any motion parallel to this within<br/>the triangle would also move only the top voice. Likewise, motion parallel<br/>to the \ side would move only the middle voice. Both of these already<br/>happen in your mp3 tours. But motion parallel to the | side would move the<br/>bottom voice, making it no more important than the other two, and then<br/>motion along any wavefront would only ever involve one voice moving. The<br/>disadvantage is that if you went around the edge of the triangle<br/>anticlockwise from 1:1:1 back to 1:1:1 you&apos;d end up an octave higher than<br/>you started... Making smaller closed tours within the triangle would<br/>result in smaller absolute shifts, up or down depending on direction. This<br/>could be an interesting effect, but if Paul ever makes his applet (I<br/>thought of something like it too, when I first made a terrain picture, but<br/>I looked into getting Java to order a soundcard driver around, and it<br/>wasn&apos;t pretty, at least not to me) then this feature would need a careful<br/>implementation.</p><p>The other way I can imagine is to consider that motion *perpendicular* to<br/>one side only affects two voices. Then, only if you moved directly due<br/>&apos;East&apos; on David&apos;s version of Paul&apos;s triangle (I can&apos;t remember if the<br/>original is oriented the same way), the bottom voice would stay constant.<br/>Similarly, motion perpendicular to the / side would hold the top note<br/>still and motion perpendicular to the \ side would hold the middle note<br/>still. For other directions these voice-leading rules would be combined,<br/>and since none of the ridges are perpendicular to any side of the<br/>triangle, ridge-running inside the triangle would result in no voice ever<br/>being held steady.</p><p>This was an interesting bit of the longer tour:</p><p>David Finnamore wrote:</p><p>&gt; 3:50    8: 7: 6<br/>&gt; 4:00   28:24:21  [or 1/6 : 1/7 : 1/8]</p><p>Does anyone else hear the utonal version as smoother than the otonal<br/>version, or is this an artifact of the slight detuning David introduced?</p><p>cheers --jon</p></div><h3>Paul H.
