I think the proposed new approach is more accurate and, what is very important, much more intuitive.</p><p>Let&apos;s begin with the Stern-Brocot tree instead of Farey series. Farey series is an ordered set of all fractions in lowest terms (at any given higher limit for denominator value). This series has a crucial property: given any set of three consecutive terms, the middle one equals the mediant between the third and the first (the mediant between a/b and c/d is (a+c)/(b+d)). Stern-Brocot tree takes the concept of mediant not as a consequence but as a constructing law; the generation of the set of fractions in lowest terms is then a consequence. Taken to infinity, both approaches are equivalent, but in limited terms are not. In Farey Series you introduce the fractions with denominator 1 first, then those with denominator 2, then those with denominator 3, and so on. In Stern-Brocot tree fractions with the same denominator are generated at different levels.</p><p>The main advantage of Stern-Brocot tree is that it introduces a rank of simplicity of fractions on objective terms, prior to any calculation of the &quot;room&quot; surrounding any of these. As for music, you find the unison first, then the octave, then the fifth, then the fourth, then the major third, and so on:</p><p>Level 0: 0/1, 1/0</p><p>Level 1: 1/1</p><p>Level 2: 1/2, 2/1</p><p>Level 3: 1/3, 2/3, 3/2, 3/1</p><p>Level 4: 1/4, 1/5, 3/5, 3/4, 4/3, 5/3, 5/2, 4/1</p><p>etc.</p><p>Calculations are simpler. When you are aware that 3/2 has been generated by 1/1 and 2/1, you find no difficulty in determine the nearest neighbours at next level, 4/3 and 5/3. And then you can interpole indefinitely next &quot;nearest neighbours&quot; at the higher levels: 7/5 and 8/5, 10/7 and 11/7, 13/9 and 14/9, and so on, without any need to develop the whole tree.</p><p>Let&apos;s now define the &quot;room of an interval at a level n&quot; by means of the following mathematical expression:</p><p>R(i,n)=[i(f)-i(p)](n-2)</p><p>where</p><p>i is any interval (mathematically, any fraction in lowest terms);</p><p>n is any level such that is superior to the level at which i has been generated;</p><p>R(i,n) is the room value of interval i at level n;</p><p>i(f) is the immediate following interval of i at level n;</p><p>i(p) is the immediate precedent interval of i at level n.</p><p>For any interval i, the set of room values at different levels is quickly convergent.
