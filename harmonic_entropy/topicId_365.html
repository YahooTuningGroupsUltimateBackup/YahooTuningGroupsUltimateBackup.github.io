I think our musical grammar<br/>has developed so that we recognize the minor sixth as consonant when it&apos;s<br/>the inversion of the major third; note that the augmented fifth is still<br/>perceived as dissonant, even though it&apos;s the exact same interval!</p><p>As for the fourth being dissonant in jazz, that is: (a) in the context of a<br/>larger chord -- here we&apos;re only talking about dyads; and (b) not really a<br/>fourth but a fourth plus several octaves, since the &quot;root&quot; appears in the<br/>bass and the &quot;dissonant fourth&quot; in the melody.</p></div>
