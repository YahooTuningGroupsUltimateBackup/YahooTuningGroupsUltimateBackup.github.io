She did it.  The last uploaded file, ridgetune.mp3, is<br/>the &quot;ridgewalk tour&quot;  processed similarly to the way the short one<br/>was.  The main difference is that the short one was time compressed<br/>200%, this one only 100% because it&apos;s pacing was quicker to start<br/>with.  That gives it approximately the same final pacing, and makes<br/>it quite a bit longer.  (I went ahead and had it put in my egroups<br/>folder instead of my personal space because it was a simpler process<br/>for my wife.)</p><p>David</p></div><h3><a id=261 href="#261">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2000 1:18:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@egroups.com">harmonic_entropy@egroups.com</a>, &quot;David Finnamore&quot; &lt;daeron@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/harmonic_entropy/260">http://www.egroups.com/message/harmonic_entropy/260</a></p><p>Hi David!</p><p>Congrats on your recent postings, and thank you so much for them.<br/>The new &quot;corrected&quot; tour is terrific as well as the &quot;ridgetune&quot; which<br/>is a nice variation!</p><p>I really enjoy hearing the files while following my &quot;green pizza&quot; and<br/>&quot;trip&quot; itinerary.</p><p>I will be playing this for &quot;visitors,&quot; too, since it will be a<br/>conversation piece in certain quarters  -- I wish I could project it<br/>on my wall and use a laser pointer...</p><p>Now, I have a question for you and Paul...</p><p>Of course, your recent &quot;tours&quot; are of the harmonic &quot;mountaintops,&quot;<br/>almost like those hiking trails that go on top of mountains, with<br/>picturesque summit views (!)</p><p>HOWEVER, is that the most dramatic way to hear the green pizza??</p><p>I was wondering if there was some logical (or otherwise) tour that<br/>would travel around harmonic entropy space and which would not always<br/>just hit the harmonic &quot;high points.&quot;</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t that make a more &quot;dramatic&quot; impression when an area of low<br/>entropy was reached??</p><p>Would there be any kind of reasonable path for such a tour??...<br/>mixing the more dissonant areas in with the consonant areas, or would<br/>such a sound file be too difficult to create??</p><p>Just wondering...</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=262 href="#262">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
