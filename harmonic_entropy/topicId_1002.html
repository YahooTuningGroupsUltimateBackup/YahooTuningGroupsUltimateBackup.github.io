No, honestly, I don&apos;t think it makes a<br/>whit of difference that you need to express these<br/>intervals using compound rather than prime numbers,<br/>since that need only arises from the need to show them<br/>all as integers in the wider context of a chord.</p><p>Here&apos;s another way of looking at this situation.<br/>Suppose we take the complexity of any exact ratio as<br/>simply the largest integer in it (*).  Then:</p><p>The *reduced* intervals of the second chord are (in<br/>order of complexity) 3/2, 7/5 and 21/10.</p><p>The *reduced* intervals of the first chord are (in<br/>order of complexity) 3/2, 10/7 and 15/7.</p><p>Ignoring the 3/2, the complexities of all these align as:<br/> ... 7/5 ... 10/7 ... 15/7 ... 21/10 ...<br/>The first chord has the two mid-most values, and the<br/>second chord has the two outermost values, of complexity.</p><p>Those complexity numbers would (3,) 7, 10, 15, 21.  Their<br/>sums would be 31 for the second chord and 28 for the<br/>first.  Again, the second seems more complex.  Or is that<br/>&quot;interesting&quot;? ;-)</p><p>(*) This is a very over-simplified measure of complexity<br/>or roughness.  I recall having some conversation with Paul<br/>Erlich on this and other measures (under what name I<br/>don&apos;t recall) on the tuning list in, I think, around October<br/>or Novemeber last year.</p><p>&gt; Another possible advantage of the second spelling is -- assuming for<br/>&gt; the sake of argument that the &apos;seven-ness&apos;, from the tritone, is an<br/>&gt; important part of this chord&apos;s character, regardless of how the<br/>&gt; chord is spelled, then the second spelling, if you factor the<br/>&gt; primary chord tones, is more &apos;loaded&apos; with sevens (7-10-15 factors<br/>&gt; to 7, 2x5, and 3x5, whereas 10-14-21 factors to 2x5, 2x7, and 3x7).</p><p>That 3x7 certainly acts together with the 2x7 to reinforce<br/>the hearing of a perceived root of 1x7 for the dyad 14-21;<br/>which also coincides with their difference tone.  Comparably,<br/>the first chord is more &quot;loaded&quot; with &quot;fiveness&quot;.  So the main<br/>difference between the two chords may well be that the first<br/>&quot;feels like fives (major thirds)&quot; whilst the second &quot;fells like<br/>sevens (harmonic sevenths)&quot;.  But to be sure of this,  I&apos;d want<br/>to tune up both chords *exactly* (not as 12-EDO approxima-<br/>tions!), and then play them a few times.</p><p>&gt; Finally, looking at the measures of dissonance and roughness you<br/>&gt; calculated, they are actaully quite close, aren&apos;t they?  The same<br/>&gt; species, but with slightly different values, perhaps?  Assuming<br/>&gt; that, then I believe the second spelling would also be considered<br/>&gt; more &apos;interesting&apos;, because it is basically just as low as the first<br/>&gt; spelling in roughness and dissonance, but, at the same time, reaches<br/>&gt; higher in the series (21 vs 15), with all the interesting<br/>&gt; consequences that has (such as, according to Paul, multiple<br/>&gt; allusions to similiarly spelled nearby chords) -- in addition to its<br/>&gt; greater affinity with the number 7.</p><p>More complex, certainly.  More interesting?
