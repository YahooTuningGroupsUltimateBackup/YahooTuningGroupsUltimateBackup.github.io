Very nice</p><p>Bob Helsloot<br/>Age 44 - Living in the Netherlands, Purmerend 20 km from Amsterdam.<br/>I do play piano as well as guitar, but both in completely different areas. Piano is my classical side and guitar is my rock/jazz/blues side. I&apos;m working as a singer in the popular music-industry. I&apos;m also composing in a post-Romantic style, something like Mahler, Faur&eacute;, Shostakovitch or an early Sch&ouml;nberg. Beside that I&apos;m doing a lot of productions in my studio. Also working on some theoretical essays and books. This all will sound very contradictionary, but I always had a broad interest and my working-situations always took me to very different directions.&gt;<br/>Recently I wrote an orchestral piece for ballet, that will be performed in june this year. At this moment I&apos;m conducting and producing the musical Hair, for which I have to do a lot of arranging and practicing. Besides that I&apos;m doing a lot of performing.</p><p>Bob<br/>bhelsloot@...<br/>BOB&apos;S MUSIC<br/><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/233/bobs_music.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/233/bobs_music.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=405 href="#405">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@...</h3><span>5/13/2001 12:47:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In harmonic_entropy@y..., &quot;Bob Helsloot&quot; &lt;bhelsloot@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been looking through the files and there&apos;s a lot to study.<br/>Very nice<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Helsloot<br/>&gt; Age 44 - Living in the Netherlands</p><p>Our friend Manuel Op de Coul, the world&apos;s premier microtonal scale<br/>curator and software engineer, also lives in the Netherlands.
