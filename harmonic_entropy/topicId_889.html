Regarding the chord 3-8-10-15 just mentioned, where you have<br/>two pairs of equivalent difference tones (10-3, 15-8 =7; 8-3, 15-10<br/>= 5), which I guess could also be seen as an overlay of two chords<br/>(3-10-15, and 3-8-15) having the same set of simple difference<br/>tones -- I found other chords with the same property (eg, 6-9-10-13,<br/>3-5-7-9, 5-6-8-9, etc).</p><p>Hopefully it&apos;s not just my bias for major seventh chords, but<br/>comparing 3-8-10-15 to the other chord examples, it has a perhaps<br/>unique feature.  The number of diatonic scale steps between harmonic<br/>numbers 3 and 10, and 8 and 15, are in a 2:1 ratio (12 and 6,<br/>respectively; measured in semitones, it&apos;s 21 and 11 -- almost 2/1).</p><p>Perhaps there&apos;s a balance in this chord between the arithmatical<br/>measure of it&apos;s intervals (the difference tone value) and the<br/>logarythmic value of the interval (the step length).  What do you<br/>think?</p><p>thanks, Kelly</p></div>
