That&apos;s all!

The reason I ask is because I have only very<br/>  &gt; faint colour associations with harmony, but do have a<br/>  &gt; stong and different kind of synaesthesia with music,<br/>  &gt; namely texture, as in the sense of touch.  I&apos;m talking<br/>  &gt; about smooth and rough, brittle, spiky, watery, muddy,<br/>  &gt; velvety, slub linen, fine cotton lawn, silk, honey and<br/>  &gt; molasses!</p><p>  I&apos;ve been thinking about this, recalling interviews with true<br/>  synaesthesics (?), and am not sure....</p><p>  I don&apos;t actually vividly see colors, but what I think happens is<br/>  that, when listening to and thinking about music, I force a<br/>  comparison to the behavior of light, and other natural phenomenon.<br/>  So, in that part of the brain which &apos;sees&apos; things internally, as<br/>  part of the thought-process, that&apos;s were I envision sound as light<br/>  waves.</p><p>  Do you agree that this is not true synaethsisia?  Maybe it could be<br/>  called &apos;Hinking&apos;!</p><p>  Kelly</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.16 - Release Date: 24/5/05</p></div><h3><a id=821 href="#821">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2005 12:45:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi again Kelly,</p><p>I read your reference right through.</p><p>Well, the first few paragraphs - up to the heading<br/>&quot;Applications?&quot; - seems sound enough, if basic,<br/>heterodyne theory.
