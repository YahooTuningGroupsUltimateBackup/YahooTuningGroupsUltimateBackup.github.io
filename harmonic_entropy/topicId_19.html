Anywho, I believe the so-called<br/>totient function is sometimes called Euler&apos;s function.  It gives the number<br/>of new members in consecutive orders of the Farey series, and was suggested<br/>as a possible complexity measure early in the complexity thread (by Kraig?).<br/>It makes a bad complexity measure, though; I used it in the example above<br/>because its value is all over the place.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
