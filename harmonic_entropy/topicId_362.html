Unfortunately,<br/>but not surprisingly, it failed -- the simpler the fraction, the more<br/>&quot;probability&quot; there is around it, since one has not only the 1/sqrt(n*d) for<br/>the fraction itself, but also 1/sqrt(2n*2d), 1/sqrt(3n*3d), and so on up<br/>until the limit is reached . . . hmm . . .</p><p>Last night I thought of a way of justifying the 1/sqrt(n*d) rule<br/>theoretically rather than empirically, but it would seem to apply to the<br/>unreduced-fraction case and not to the lowest-terms case -- oy! In any case,<br/>it would seem to imply 1/cuberoot(l*m*n) for the triad case, but I suppose<br/>the empirical validation would still appear necessary . . .</p><p>Oh well . . .</p></div>
