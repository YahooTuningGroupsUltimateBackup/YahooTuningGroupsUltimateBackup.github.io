This is no surprise since the<br/>3rd partial was present in all 4 pitches in the 8:9:10:11 chord and in the<br/>frequency-offset case, the partial are not exactly harmonic.

(Well less rich than<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many being<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limited to 9 harmonics.)  What we heard when I played a<br/>&gt; 8:9:10:11<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chord with<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that &quot;timbre&quot; when I offset the partials upwards was that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;resultant&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pitch went up too.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&apos;m confused. Can you explain what you did a little more fully?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wouldn&apos;t the main thing you hear when 8:9:10:11 is played with<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inharmonic timbres be that it starts to beat?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Still hoping for this clarification . . .<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would have recommended a different experiment -- construct a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *timbre* where the only partials are, say, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; offset<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them by a constant Hz offset; and observe the effect on the<br/>&gt; heard<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pitch.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, so you are just suggesting omitting partials 1 through 4?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Otherwise<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this sounds identical to what I did.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Really?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, I&apos;m quite sure of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So where does 8:9:10:11 come it? I&apos;m really confused.</p><p>That&apos;s the chord.  Each note in the chord has partials 1 through 9.  Still<br/>seems like that&apos;s just what were are describing (with partials 5 through 9).<br/>Once you set up the partials surely you weren&apos;t just going to play one note,<br/>were you?  Or maybe you were.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; The above seems to suggest you did something different,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; namely chords played using complex (non-sine-wave) timbres. I<br/>&gt; suppose<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; your clarification will sort this all out . . .<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well the above explanation refers to &quot;partials 1 through 9&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t use<br/>&gt;&gt; the word partial for something that isn&apos;t non-sine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The &quot;timbre&quot; was<br/>&gt;&gt; constructed from partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In the software, the frequency of each sine<br/>&gt;&gt; partial equals the fundamental times the partial number plus a<br/>&gt; frequency<br/>&gt;&gt; offset, with the multiplication being done before the addition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right. But clearly something&apos;s missing here. First you have partials<br/>&gt; 1 through 9, then you have 8:9:10:11 constructed from those partial 1-<br/>&gt; 9 timbres? That what you seemed to be saying above, but now you&apos;re<br/>&gt; insisting otherwise.</p><p>No, I insisted on the wrong thing.</p><p>&gt; Meanwhile, my experiment would only have one<br/>&gt; list of integers involved, while you clearly have two lists (1-9 and<br/>&gt; 8-11). Where have we lost each other?</p><p>Yup, two lists for me, one list for you.  The overall sound is what I think<br/>you would call the combination product of the list or partials and the list<br/>of notes.</p><p>The whole experiment relates back to what in retrospect is likely to have<br/>been a misinterpretation of what I heard you suggest.  I wanted to study a<br/>particular phenomenon and the experiment seemed to clarify what I was<br/>hearing.  The phenomenon I wanted to study in the first place was in fact<br/>involving complex harmonic timbres combined into a chord.  I wanted to know<br/>whether the resultant tone I was hearing was a clustering of difference<br/>tones or whether it was a virtual pitch.  By substituting a timbre over<br/>which I had full control (allowing me to make it inharmonic) I was then able<br/>to apply offsets.  Keep in mind I was adjusting a frequency offset applied<br/>to the entire list of partials across all notes in the chord.  So you could<br/>ignore the fact that two lists were involved, because the offset was not a<br/>function of the base frequency, but just an absolute value in Hz.  So you<br/>could think of it as a larger list rather than two lists, but the larger<br/>list is the combination product of the two lists.  The offset is applied to<br/>every element in the combination product.  This allowed the experiment to<br/>reflect something like the actual situation that I am used to hearing, and<br/>in fact allowed me to both confirm that the qualitative phenomenon was the<br/>same one I had been hearing, but also allowed me to tweak all the partials.<br/>The result proved it was not a difference tone phenomenon because the<br/>&quot;resultant&quot; pitch did not stay constant when I aplied the offset.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Well, I said some things badly and some things wrong there.  The<br/>&gt; ability to<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;identify&quot; is probably more to the point, and it is not just about<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;harmonics&quot; but about relative pitches that fall on or near certain<br/>&gt; ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Relative pitches? You mean intervals?</p><p>That&apos;s what I meant.</p><p>&gt;&gt; By &quot;individually-heard&quot; I was thinking in terms of notes in a<br/>&gt; chord, which<br/>&gt;&gt; tend to be individually identifiable even if there is some tendency<br/>&gt; for the<br/>&gt;&gt; chord to fuse into a single timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you said &quot;harmonics&quot;, did you mean &quot;notes of a chord&quot;?</p><p>When I said harmonics I wasn&apos;t thinking clearly.

Well, if you do this, you lose the effect I was trying to focus<br/>on, because the simple question of beating and/or roughness becomes<br/>so prominent in the discordance equation (not that such an equation<br/>has actually been written down, but you know what I mean).</p><p>&gt; The whole experiment relates back to what in retrospect is likely<br/>to have<br/>&gt; been a misinterpretation of what I heard you suggest.

And since all you had was a set of offset partials of a given<br/>fundamental, there were no beating effects to complicate things. So<br/>it really would be no different to consider it a single list of<br/>partials, with various amplitudes, and going up as high as the 99th<br/>partial. And you discovered that combinational tones (a general term<br/>for all orders of difference tones and sum tones) were not the sole<br/>source of your resultant pitch impression. So I&apos;d say that you&apos;ve<br/>successfully demonstrated the importance of virtual pitch, at least<br/>to your own auditory system. Well done!</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;ll try this anyway -- here is how I understand things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You have a harmonic entropy function.
