(1966). Repetition pitch: Monaural interaction of a sound with<br/>the repetition of the same, but phase shifted, sound. Acustica 17, 295-300</p><p>When a sound and the repetition of the same sound after a delay $\tau$ are<br/>presented together, monaurally, one perceives a &quot;coloration&quot;, accompanied by<br/>a pitch sensation. This pitch, RP (Repetition Pitch), appears to correspond<br/>to the reciprocal $1/\tau$ of the delay time $\tau$. However, when all the<br/>frequency components of the delayed sound are shifted in phase by<br/>$90^\circ$, $180^\circ$ and $270^\circ$ resp., the RP changes to<br/>$1.07/\tau$, $0.88/\tau$ (or $1.14/\tau$) and $0.94/\tau$ resp. (In our case<br/>the sound was white noise, delayed by a tape recorder.) The same pitches are<br/>perceived when listening to a random sequence of pulse pairs (pulse distance<br/>$\tau$), where the first of (and) the second pulse is shifted in phase.<br/>These results cannot be explained simply by means of autocorrelation or<br/>frequency analysis.</p><p>Yost, W.A., Hill, R., Perez-Falcon, T. (1978). Pitch and pitch<br/>discrimination of broadband signals with rippled power spectra. J. Acoust.<br/>Soc. Am. 64, 1166-1173</p><p>A random-interval pulse train or wide-band noise when delayed ($\tau$) and<br/>added back to itself (cos+) produces a stimulus with a cosinusoidally<br/>varying (or rippled) power spectrum. The spacing between the peaks in the<br/>spectrum is equal to the reciprocal of the delay ($1/\tau$). If the stimulus<br/>is delayed and added back at $180^\circ$ phase reversal (cos-), then a<br/>cosinusoidally varying power spectrum is generated whose spectral peaks are<br/>separated by $1/\tau$, but whose peaks are displaced by $1/2\tau$ relative<br/>to the power spectrum of the cos+ stimulus generated with the same delay,<br/>$\tau$. These stimuli yield a pich, such that the pitch of the cos+ stimulus<br/>is equal to approximately $1/\tau$ and the pitches of the cos- stimuli are<br/>equal to approximately $0.9/\tau$ and $1.1/\tau$. These pitch matching<br/>results were studied using a variety of matching stimuli and conditions.<br/>Following the identification of the pitches, a method of limits and a<br/>same-different procedure were used to study the pitch discriminability of<br/>both the cos+ and cos- stimuli. Delays ($\tau$) ranging from 1 to 10 ms were<br/>studied covering a pitch range of 90-1100 Hz. The pitch discrimination<br/>associated with the cos+ and cos- stimuli were essentially the same for both<br/>the random-interval pulse train and the wide-band stimuli. These<br/>pitch-discrimination results are compared to those associated with a<br/>periodic pulse train. The research is also discussed in terms of<br/>discriminations of delayed sounds in reverberant environments. These results<br/>are consistent with assumptions concerning the autocorrelation of the<br/>rippled stimuli within the dominant frequency region for pitch perception.</p></div>
