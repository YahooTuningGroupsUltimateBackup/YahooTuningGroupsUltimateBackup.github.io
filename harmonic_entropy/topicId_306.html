In some cases, the geometric mean<br/>otonal listings seemed to reflect what I was hearing, *BUT*,<br/>surprising to me, in OTHER instances the TENNEY listing seemed to do<br/>a better job!</p><p>In a few cases, *neither* ranked the tetrads as being as concordant<br/>as I thought they should be.  However, these instances, where<br/>*neither* listing gave an approximate concordance were, frankly,<br/>rare.</p><p>Here are the results.  My method was simple... I was mostly just<br/>looking for tetrads that seemed *more* concordant than the given<br/>Tenney listing...</p><p>12-11-00</p><p>I did another listening session of the new Tenney rankings.  I<br/>realize now that things are a little more &quot;complicated&quot; than I<br/>originally supposed.  While the otonal &quot;geometric mean&quot; rankings<br/>seemed better for some tetrads, the Tenney actually seemed better for<br/>others, so adhering to the &quot;geometric mean&quot; rankings exclusively<br/>seemed *NOT* the best policy.</p><p>I decided just to go with the audible sound and I tried to limit<br/>any &quot;preconceptions&quot; I had about any of the chords.  This was easy to<br/>do :).</p><p>My major concern was tetrads that seemed more *concordant* than they<br/>should be in the new Tenney rankings.</p><p>First off I have a retraction.  The &quot;stacked fourths&quot; chord<br/>0__492__980__1472 really does sound incredibly concordant.  The #2<br/>ranking on the new Tenney listing really is *MUCH* better than the<br/>previous #33 ranking on the geometric mean.  I wonder how it got that<br/>low using that method (??)  Indeed, the tetrad sounds exceedingly<br/>concordant.  The geometric mean ranking seems, for some reason,<br/>*wrong* on this one!  This was a surprise!</p><p>I thought tetrad #6-7: 0__502__1002__1390 should be more concordant<br/>than #6-7.  However, it was ranked #10 on the geometric mean, so<br/>*neither* list seemed to make it as concordant as I wanted it to be!</p><p>Tetrad #8-9: 0__388__702__970 should be near the most concordant in<br/>my listening experience.   It is way down to #30 on the geo listing.<br/>Weird (??)  I thought it sounded very concordant.</p><p>Tetrad #11-12: 0__498__702__886 should be ranked a *bit* more<br/>concordant.  It was #22 on the geo, so that list didn&apos;t represent it<br/>as well, to my ear.</p><p>Tetrad #15-16:  0__302__502__1004 seemed like it should be ranked a<br/>*bit* more concordant.  This one is #31 geo, so that ranking also<br/>didn&apos;t rank this one as well.</p><p>Tetrad #17-18:  0__204__702__1088 should be ranked as more<br/>concordant. It is #20 geo, so neither list has it as concordant as I<br/>feel it should be.</p><p>Tetrad #20-21:  0__318__816__1020 should be ranked *MUCH* more<br/>consonant than this.  (It&apos;s the 5:6:7:8).  The geo list was *MUCH*<br/>better with this one it was #2 geo.</p><p>Tetrad #27-28:  0__502__1002__1320 should be ranked more concordant.<br/>It&apos;s exactly the same on the geo list, #28, so *neither* is so<br/>satisfactory to me</p><p>Tetrad #31-32:  0__388__776__1090 should be ranked more concordant.<br/>It&apos;s #17 geo, so that list did a better job, to my ear.</p><p>Tetrad #33:  0__388__886__274 should be ranked more concordant.  It&apos;s<br/>#13 geo, so the geo list did a better job on that one.</p><p>These are the new results... now *why??*<br/>__________ ___ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Paul H.
