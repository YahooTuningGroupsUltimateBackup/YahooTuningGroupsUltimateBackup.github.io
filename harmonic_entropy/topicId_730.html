The 225:224-based approximations of the following 7-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit ratios<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occur asfollows:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 9:7 (actually  16: 25) appears 4 times<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6:7 (actually  32: 75) appears 3 times<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4:7 (actually 128:225) appears 2 times<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&apos;m sure you know that so this must be just some language<br/>thing.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me I use a fixed Duodene tuning in various &quot;keys&quot;.

One could say that a 128:225 appears in the key of F#, since<br/>F#<br/>&gt; &gt; major has both B and C# among its pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.  Implicit is that in constructing chords, intervals that are<br/>not good<br/>&gt; in a given key won&apos;t be used, and so I ignore them, and in that<br/>sense the<br/>&gt; 4:7 approx appears in C#.

There I<br/>explain this conventional thinking in terms of the &quot;characteristic<br/>dissonances&quot; the chord forms with the scale. The G major chord<br/>contains a B, which forms a &quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; against F in<br/>the scale, demanding resolution -- unless the F had already been<br/>clearly replaced with F#. The only &quot;resolved&quot; chords in the &quot;white<br/>notes&quot; scale, against which any melody in scale tones can be played<br/>without involving the characteristic dissonance, are C major and A<br/>minor.

In<br/>&gt; other words, if I&apos;ve calculated a function only at integer cents<br/>&gt; values, it can &apos;fill in the gaps&apos; of the function based on the<br/>&gt; already-calculated points -- and it&apos;s often a really good<br/>&gt; approximation that can be computationally more efficient than<br/>&gt; computing the function all over again at whatever fractional-cents<br/>&gt; point you need when searching.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene said &quot;however&quot; below because the function with abs-exponential<br/>&gt; minima, since it is not smooth to begin with, is not one where<br/>&gt; splining is going to give good approximations.

Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that&apos;s exatly<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what your original smoother function was, maybe not.  Part of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; idea here<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is to &quot;push&quot; the squaring down in to a deeper level of the HE<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; function in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any way that that might make sense.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Well there we go.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, still different from changing the distribution assumption,<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; not?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought it sounded like changing the distribution assumption,<br/>since<br/>&gt; &gt; that is at a deeper level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, even deeper than I intended to go!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, the pointy ones may be &quot;better&quot; because they will tend to<br/>favor<br/>&gt; &gt; JI scales, and that may be what you or someone is looking for.<br/>&gt; &gt; However, making them un-pointy will make them favor tempered<br/>scales,<br/>&gt; &gt; so this would appear to defeat the whole purpose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Optimization routines aren&apos;t going to work well on the pointy<br/>ones in<br/>&gt; &gt; the first place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What kind of algorithms are you using?</p><p>I have the Matlab Optimization Toolbox. It&apos;s got all the state-of-the-<br/>art algorithms.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It would take a different strategy to find<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;global optima&quot; of, say, 12-note scales such as to minimize<br/>total<br/>&gt; &gt; dyadic entropy according to the pointy ones. One strategy might<br/>be to<br/>&gt; &gt; plug in every 12-note scale in the Scala archive which has 2/1 as<br/>its<br/>&gt; &gt; interval of repetition. Then one might get a sense of the pattern<br/>&gt; &gt; of &quot;goodness/badness&quot; according to this measure, and perhaps<br/>discover<br/>&gt; &gt; something even &quot;gooder&quot; :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are saying this is a way of rating the rating function?</p><p>No, just the scales.</p><p>&gt; So you might<br/>&gt; try some random alterations to the function, say between pointiness<br/>and<br/>&gt; smoothness and see what degree of pointiness matches listening test<br/>&gt; judgements?</p><p>That would be an entirely different and separate issue.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; However, even the pointy ones could be represented by *segmented*<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; spline<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; functions, no?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, they appear to be fractal in nature, with local minima at<br/>&gt; &gt; *every* rational number.
