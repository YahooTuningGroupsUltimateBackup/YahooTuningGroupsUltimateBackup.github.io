But so is the point where one basin meets another. So a zero first derivative tells you the either you&apos;ve got a perfectly just tuning, or a perfectly ambiguous one.</p><p>The second derivative tells you if it&apos;s a maximum or a minimum.  So a JI point is minimum dissonance, and so should have a positive second derivative, right?</p><p>The sharper the point is, the faster the gradient has to change.  Hence the second derivative will tell you where the sharpest points are.</p><p>              Graham</p></div>
