By contrast,<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt; the ratios are relative to a fixed reference pitch, they can (and<br/>&gt; &gt; must) sometimes be upward, sometimes downward.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Totally different scenario.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this process of measuring intervals part of Partch utonality,</p><p>There, you measure the intervals of each pitch from the &quot;guide tone&quot;,<br/>always in an upward sense, and the numerators will all be powers of 2.</p><p>&gt; or<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy?</p><p>Well, you just have to input the data in some form the program will<br/>understand . . . did you have a specific scenario in mind?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m a little bit stuck on understanding this, maybe because I first<br/>&gt; have to deal with a perhaps related question which I&apos;m fixated on<br/>&gt; (related to my musings on an &apos;inversion effect&apos;):  considering just<br/>&gt; some simple intervals like 3/2, 5/3, and 5/4, is a measure of the<br/>&gt; higher harmonic entropy (or lesser tonalness) of their<br/>corresponding<br/>&gt; inversions (4/3, 6/5, and 8/5) a direct result (or caused by, in<br/>&gt; some manner) the inversion --(of having a lower limit number over a<br/>&gt; higher limit number)?</p><p>I&apos;d say it&apos;s simply a result of the numbers in the ratio being<br/>higher! No need to invoke &apos;limits&apos; -- and certainly not &quot;limits&quot; on<br/>the individual numbers in the ratio!</p><p>&gt; (I realize there are cases where the opposite<br/>&gt; is probably true: 9/8 is --am I correct?--less consonant than<br/>&gt;16/9).</p><p>If so, not by much. The chart on the home page says 9/8 has entropy<br/>4.774, while 16/9 is very slightly more consonant with entropy 4.765.<br/>A truly tiny difference. What happened is that the numbers in 9/8 and<br/>16/9 are already a bit too high for the &quot;lower numbers = lower<br/>entropy&quot; equation to hold true.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I was curious that, in TTSS, Sethares mentions<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s &apos;One<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Footed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bride&apos;, but not, I don&apos;t believe, the theory of Utonality.<br/>&gt; Do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that is because, as I saw in a post somewhere, he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Sethares),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not &apos;believe in&apos; the significance of subharmonics?<br/>&gt; thx,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kelly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, even without &apos;believing in&apos; the significance or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; existence<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of subharmonics, Sethares&apos; theory predicts that utonalities<br/>&gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about equally consonant as their corresponding otonalities!<br/>&gt; This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because the utonal and the otonal chord will have the exact<br/>&gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; set<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of intervals, and Sethares sums the dissonances of the<br/>&gt; individual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervals to get the dissonance of the chord. The fact that<br/>&gt; &gt; higher-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limit otonalities are much more consonant than their<br/>&gt; &gt; corresponding<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; utonalities shows that there&apos;s a serious problem with<br/>&gt; Sethares&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory, and he sort of mentions this in the second edition of<br/>&gt; his<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; book.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Did you have no response to this?

You can certainly hear the intervals in a<br/>&gt; &gt; chord . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess I took the analogy between fusion and tonalness too far,<br/>&gt; thinking that if the ear &apos;successfully&apos; places 3 notes in a series,<br/>&gt; that the low number (or some other) quality of the intervals is<br/>&gt; somehow lost, similar to the effect of fusion on otherwise audible<br/>&gt; overtones !</p><p>The low number quality isn&apos;t lost at all, since that&apos;s what makes<br/>this effect possible in the first place. But a certain independence<br/>between the voices is lost, so too much &quot;fusion&quot; can hamper<br/>counterpoint.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; (This chord 5-6-9 also, uniquely, I&apos;m pretty sure, has exactly-<br/>&gt; &gt; equal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cubic and simple difference tones!)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How so? I find 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 among the cubic<br/>difference<br/>&gt; &gt; tones, but only 1, 3, and 4 among the simple ones . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Based on what I saw in a textbook, I thought cubic difference tones<br/>&gt; (for 5:6:9) were like so: 10-6, 10-9, and 12-9.  (Sorry,  I should<br/>&gt; look it up.)</p><p>Yes, those are important ones, but there&apos;s also 15-5, 11-9, and 14-6,<br/>for a start.</p></div><h3><a id=980 href="#980">ðŸ”—</a>traktus5 &#x3C;kj4321@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2006 12:14:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In general, how high up in overtones should one check for<br/>&gt; dissonance &gt; &gt; that may be significant for the chord&apos;s character?</p><p>&gt; Do you mean the overtones of the notes themselves, or do you mean<br/>the &gt; overtones of an implied fundamental for which the notes of the<br/>chord &gt; may act as overtones?</p><p>The former.</p><p>(Hmm, for the latter case, where you have high numbers in chords<br/>such as 20-24-45, and 36-45-60-80, do the numbers still represent<br/>perceptible overtones?

What<br/>&gt; statement of mine are you referring to?</p><p>I can&apos;t readily find the message.  I recall I mentioned that it<br/>seemed paradoxical that major chords are considered more consonant<br/>than minor chords, when it is the minor chords which have the low<br/>common overtone, to which you responded (words to the effect) &apos;but<br/>have you looked at [the overtone clashes and concurrences in] the<br/>higher overtones of the minor chords&apos;, implying, I assumed, that<br/>they were much more clashing than with major chords. Perhaps I<br/>misunderstood.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you looked at the combinational tones in these chords? It<br/>&gt; may &gt; &gt; be &gt; more than just abstract number patterns . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes.  Like the nice sounding chord 3:8:10:15, and the matching<br/>&gt; &gt; difference tones for the &apos;subset chords&apos; 3:8:15 and 3:10:15.</p><p>&gt; So maybe you don&apos;t need recourse to numerological explanations?</p><p>Learning the science of psychoacoustics has really changed and<br/>enriched my enjoyment of the chords!  (The way I arrange them on the<br/>piano, for eg, can be accounted for by roughness and beating.)  But<br/>I still believe part of the beauty of an interval is because it<br/>approximates a ratio of whole numbers (like the energy states of an<br/>electron; there are no gradations between them), so the numbers are<br/>hard to ignore.  But I realize I go out on a limb looking for<br/>connections between the numbers and psychoacoustic phenemon.</p><p>(For example, there&apos;s a really nice chord, 3:7:10, dimished triad,<br/>on strings, in the tenor/bass register, in the menuet, mozart A maj<br/>symphony 29.  It really stood out when I heard it, even though I<br/>know there are plenty of other &apos;addative&apos; chords like that.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m just concentrating on the numerators of 6/5 and 3/2. If,<br/>&gt; despite &gt; &gt; the ear&apos;s attempt at fusion and tonalness, we do also<br/>hear the &gt; &gt; separate intervals, then couldn&apos;t we be hearing a 6 and<br/>a 3?  (2:1 &gt; &gt; ratio.)</p><p>&gt; That makes absolutely no sense, any way I think about it.</p><p>The ear attempts to place notes in a harmonic series<br/>(1,2,3,4,5...).  Is it not even *possible* that the ear could<br/>isolate, in some way, the ratio 6:3 (numerators of the bottom and<br/>top interval)?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There&apos;s something so cool sounding about the chord (even on<br/>my &gt; &gt; 12 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tet piano), that I believe it has something to do<br/>with the 2:1 &gt; &gt; &gt; ratio &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of 3/2 and 6/5 (top notes).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; See, this makes no sense to me. The ratio of the top two notes<br/>of &gt; &gt; &gt; 5:6:9 is 2:3. The ratio of 3/2 and 6/5 is 5:4.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (Excuse me...how do you get 5:4?)</p><p>&gt; Wow -- it&apos;s just the interval between 3/2 and 6/5. (3/2)/(6/5) =<br/>(3/2)&gt; *(5/6) = (1/2)*(5/2) = 5/4. Surely you already knew how to<br/>calculate &gt; the interval between two pitch ratios?</p><p>Of course... that&apos;s my tautology (6/5 x 3/2 = 9/5)!  And conversely<br/>(inversely?) I&apos;m accustomed to dividing the outer interval by one of<br/>the inner intervals, to get the other inner interval.  Why would one<br/>divide the two inner intervals by each other?  Aside from the<br/>implied interval g-b natural, in the chord e4-g4-d5, what perceptual<br/>signigicance does 5/4 have in this chord?  I believe that 6:3 is<br/>more significant in this chord than 5:4!</p><p>(Anyway, do we really know what math rules music follows?!  Consider<br/>how mysterious it&apos;s expressive effect can be!  Why can&apos;t its math be<br/>too!)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I know you guys tried to talk me out &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the notion<br/>that I can hear two intervals in a chord</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Huh?

So, refering here to &apos;difference tones&apos; as those between<br/>&gt; overtones (5-4, 8-5, etc) and not the amplitude &apos;wavering&apos; beating<br/>&gt; between nearly identical pitches, do difference tones themselves<br/>&gt; beat against a nearby partial or note?  Is that why you make the<br/>&gt; point about the difference tone not coinciding with the note?</p><p>Alexander Ellis reports, Art. 3. (d) Beat-Notes and<br/>Differential Tones of his Appendix XX, on p. 530 of his<br/>translation of Hermann Helmholtz&apos; &quot;On the Sensations<br/>of Tone&quot;, several experiments using tuning forks, which<br/>confirm those reported by him made by R.

Other beats, beat-notes and combinational tones<br/>appear not to exist externally to the ear.&quot;</p><p>&gt; What if the difference tones are not audible.  Do they still effect<br/>&gt; the chord sound?</p><p>See my first comment above about Ellis&apos; experiments.</p><p>&gt; And on audibility of difference tones, why do textbooks I&apos;ve seen<br/>&gt; usually say they are only audible under special circumstances, like<br/>&gt; high notes on the recorder?  (Wow, if you can&apos;t hear it, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; having an effect, I wonder what&apos;s going on?)</p><p>Ellis also uses a similar example, of very high notes on<br/>a flageolet, but only as an extreme case that he feels<br/>best demonstrates the existence of the difference<br/>tones.  Note * on page 153, op. cit., on combinational<br/>tones, reads:<br/>&quot;I have found that combinational tones can be made<br/>quite audible to a hundred people at once, by means<br/>of two flageolet fifes or whistles, blown as strongly<br/>as possible.  I choose very close dissonant intervals<br/>because the great depth of the low tone is much more<br/>striking, being very far below anything that can be<br/>touched by the instrument itself.&quot;</p><p>I conclude that Ellis finds that the difference notes<br/>are real enough for lower amplitude waves and that<br/>they arise between notes lower in pitch, exactly as<br/>Helmholtz describes.  For example, playing a 4:5 dyad<br/>as C4:E4 produces the difference tone C2; a 4:6 dyad<br/>as C4:G4 produces the difference tone C3; a 4:5:6<br/>triad as C4:E4:G4 produces both of these.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A small change in tuning can change the harmonicity<br/>&gt; &gt; of a difference tone by a fair amount.  Let&apos;s look<br/>&gt; &gt; at your 3:4:5:8 chord more closely.  Suppose you are<br/>&gt; &gt; playing that as G2:C3:E3:C4 on your 12-EDO piano.  Let&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; assume for simplicity of calculation that your G2 is 99 Hz<br/>&gt; &gt; - that&apos;s equivalent to tuning A4=445.5Hz, but more<br/>&gt; &gt; importantly, to tuning C1 to 33 Hz, so all our frequencies<br/>&gt; &gt; are multiples of 33 Hz.  Then your G2:C3:E3:C4 chord<br/>&gt; &gt; should have the fundamental frequencies 99, 132, 165, 264,<br/>&gt; &gt; plus their overtones, with the difference tones 33, 33, 66,<br/>&gt; &gt; 99, 132, 165.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AGain, is a &quot;reinforcing effect&quot; the absence of beating?</p><p>This doesn&apos;t follow logically.  You seem to be  saying:<br/>&apos;If it&apos;s not A, it must be B.&apos;  But couldn&apos;t it be something<br/>else?  For example, it&apos;s perfectly possible to play two notes<br/>with exactly the same timbre and at exactly the same pitch<br/>- so they don&apos;t beat at all - yet without reinforcement.  You<br/>have only to ensure that they are played with the opposite<br/>phase, one lagging 180&iuml;&iquest;&half; behind the other; then they will<br/>completely cancel each other out.</p><p>Helmholtz was convinced that the difference tones could<br/>themselves form differences with chord tones, thus making<br/>second-order difference tones, third-order ... .  Ellis was<br/>properly sceptical of this.</p><p>&gt; What if<br/>&gt; the difference tone is not audible -- which I don&apos;t believe they are<br/>&gt; to me -- is there still a reinforcing effect?  If so, how, given<br/>&gt; that it is not audible?!?!</p><p>There is a threshold below which you will not hear a note<br/>of a given timbre and fundamental pitch, even though it<br/>can be detected by physical apparatus, and above which<br/>you will hear it.  However, the total amplitude of the sum<br/>of a number of inaudible notes may well be large enough<br/>to exceed your threshold of hearing.  Suppose, for example,<br/>you can only hear notes of that timbre and pitch when the<br/>wave amplitude exceeds level 9X.  I now play that note at<br/>level 8X - you can&apos;t hear it.  But if I now also play its<br/>octave at level 5X, exactly in phase with the first note,<br/>the difference tone falls on the octave and has level 2X,<br/>say, and being exactly in phase with the first note, adds<br/>linearly to its amplitude to give a total level of 10X for<br/>that note - which you can now hear.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The last three of these coincide with chord<br/>&gt; &gt; tones, while the first two give a perceived fundamental of<br/>&gt; &gt; C1, reinforced by its octave at C2.</p><p>The degree of reinforcement may be less than perfect,<br/>depending on the relative phases of the two struck notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What you actually play is a chord on the piano with the<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental frequencies =<br/>&gt; &gt; 33 * {2^(19/12), 2^(24/12), 2^(28/12), 2^(36/12)}, plus<br/>&gt; &gt; overtones, with difference tones 33 * {their six<br/>&gt; &gt; differences}:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; G2C3: 33*(4 - 2*2^(7/12)) = 33*(4 - 2.99734) = 33.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; C3E3: 33*(4*2^(4/12) - 4) = 132*(2^(4/12) -1) = 34.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; G2E3: 33*(4*2^(4/12) - 2*2^(7/12)) = 33*(2.04306) = 67.42098<br/>&gt; &gt; E3C4: 33*(8 - 4*2^(4/12)) = 132*(2 - 2^(4/12)) = 97.6668<br/>&gt; &gt; C3C4: 33*(8 - 4) = 33*4 = 132<br/>&gt; &gt; G2C4: 33*(8 - 2*2^(7/12) = 33*5.00266 = 165.08778<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve used the approximation:<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(1/12) = 1.0595<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; whose powers are:<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(2/12) = 1.12254<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(3/12) = 1.18933<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(4/12) = 1.26010<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(5/12) = 1.33507<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(6/12) = 1.41451<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(7/12) = 1.49867<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(8/12) = 1.58784<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(9/12) = 1.68232<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(10/12) = 1.78242<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^(11/12) = 1.88847<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Compare the results with the desired:<br/>&gt; &gt; G2C3: 33.08778 ....... 33 ... 0.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; C3E3: 34.3332 .......... 33 ... 0.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; G2E3: 67.42098 ....... 66 ... 1.42098<br/>&gt; &gt; E3C4: 97.6668 .......... 99 ... 1.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; C3C4: 132 ................... 132 ... 0<br/>&gt; &gt; G2C4: 165.08778 ... 165 ... 0.91222<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The third column of figures above gives the mistuning in Hertz.<br/>&gt; &gt; There should be noticeable beating at around 1.3 Hz.

(Not to say that your tuning<br/>&gt; efforts are wasted!)</p><p>I don&apos;t know whether one can actually hear things<br/>that aren&apos;t there!  It often seems that way to me<br/>(I &quot;hear&quot; most of my music before I get to realise<br/>it, either by playing it or creating a MIDI file of it).<br/>As I wrote earlier, I tend to hear gamelan and<br/>angklung music as timbral rather than tonal, which<br/>could well be an effect of my learned interval<br/>categories filtering my perceptions.  Have you ever<br/>listened to any traditional Thai court music?  That<br/>is supposed to be tuned in 7-EDO, which would play<br/>merry hell with most of our JI interval categories ...</p><p>Also, I&apos;d like to consider the effect of the degree<br/>of mistuning.  Remembering that this group is about<br/>harmonic entropy (rather than colour theory or<br/>numerology ;-)), consider the shape of the HE curve.<br/>Isn&apos;t it a bit like a normal distribution &quot;bell-curve&quot;<br/>in the region of each JI ratio?  IOW, doesn&apos;t the<br/>HE have a flattened peak spread around the exact<br/>ratios?  If so, here&apos;s a question that has long<br/>puzzled me: what bearing does this have on how we<br/>actually hear a mistuned interval?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 267.15.12/265 - Release Date: 20/2/06</p></div><h3><a id=989 href="#989">ðŸ”—</a>traktus5 &#x3C;kj4321@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2006 11:27:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hi trak,</p><p>Hi Yahya.

Then your G2:C3:E3:C4 chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; should have the fundamental frequencies 99, 132, 165, 264,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; plus their overtones, with the difference tones 33, 33, 66,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 99, 132, 165.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; AGain, is a &quot;reinforcing effect&quot; the absence of beating?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This doesn&apos;t follow logically.  You seem to be  saying:<br/>&gt; &apos;If it&apos;s not A, it must be B.&apos;  But couldn&apos;t it be something<br/>&gt; else?  For example, it&apos;s perfectly possible to play two notes<br/>&gt; with exactly the same timbre and at exactly the same pitch<br/>&gt; - so they don&apos;t beat at all - yet without reinforcement.  You<br/>&gt; have only to ensure that they are played with the opposite<br/>&gt; phase, one lagging 180&deg; behind the other; then they will<br/>&gt; completely cancel each other out.</p><p>&gt; Helmholtz was convinced that the difference tones could<br/>&gt; themselves form differences with chord tones, thus making<br/>&gt; second-order difference tones, third-order ... .  Ellis was<br/>&gt; properly sceptical of this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What if&gt; &gt; the difference tone is not audible -- which I don&apos;t<br/>believe they are&gt; &gt; to me -- is there still a reinforcing effect?<br/>If so, how, given&gt; &gt; that it is not audible?!?!</p><p>&gt; There is a threshold below which you will not hear a note<br/>&gt; of a given timbre and fundamental pitch, even though it<br/>&gt; can be detected by physical apparatus, and above which<br/>&gt; you will hear it.  However, the total amplitude of the sum<br/>&gt; of a number of inaudible notes may well be large enough<br/>&gt; to exceed your threshold of hearing.  Suppose, for example,<br/>&gt; you can only hear notes of that timbre and pitch when the<br/>&gt; wave amplitude exceeds level 9X.  I now play that note at<br/>&gt; level 8X - you can&apos;t hear it.  But if I now also play its<br/>&gt; octave at level 5X, exactly in phase with the first note,<br/>&gt; the difference tone falls on the octave and has level 2X,<br/>&gt; say, and being exactly in phase with the first note, adds<br/>&gt; linearly to its amplitude to give a total level of 10X for<br/>&gt; that note - which you can now hear.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;The last three of these coincide with chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tones, while the first two give a perceived fundamental of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C1, reinforced by its octave at C2.</p><p>I see.  &quot;Coincide&quot;, &quot;reinforce&quot;, means &apos;in tune&apos;.  But playing in,<br/>or out of phase, do instrumentalists have any control over the phase<br/>of individual notes?  Or is that just in the laboratory, or midi<br/>instrument?</p><p>&gt; The degree of reinforcement may be less than perfect,<br/>&gt; depending on the relative phases of the two struck notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; What you actually play is a chord on the piano with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental frequencies =<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 33 * {2^(19/12), 2^(24/12), 2^(28/12), 2^(36/12)}, plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; overtones, with difference tones 33 * {their six<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; differences}:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G2C3: 33*(4 - 2*2^(7/12)) = 33*(4 - 2.99734) = 33.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C3E3: 33*(4*2^(4/12) - 4) = 132*(2^(4/12) -1) = 34.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G2E3: 33*(4*2^(4/12) - 2*2^(7/12)) = 33*(2.04306) = 67.42098<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; E3C4: 33*(8 - 4*2^(4/12)) = 132*(2 - 2^(4/12)) = 97.6668<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C3C4: 33*(8 - 4) = 33*4 = 132<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G2C4: 33*(8 - 2*2^(7/12) = 33*5.00266 = 165.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve used the approximation:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(1/12) = 1.0595<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whose powers are:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(2/12) = 1.12254<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(3/12) = 1.18933<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(4/12) = 1.26010<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(5/12) = 1.33507<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(6/12) = 1.41451<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(7/12) = 1.49867<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(8/12) = 1.58784<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(9/12) = 1.68232<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(10/12) = 1.78242<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(11/12) = 1.88847<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Compare the results with the desired:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G2C3: 33.08778 ....... 33 ... 0.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C3E3: 34.3332 .......... 33 ... 0.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G2E3: 67.42098 ....... 66 ... 1.42098<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; E3C4: 97.6668 .......... 99 ... 1.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C3C4: 132 ................... 132 ... 0<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G2C4: 165.08778 ... 165 ... 0.91222<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The third column of figures above gives the mistuning in Hertz.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There should be noticeable beating at around 1.3 Hz.</p><p>Why 1.3 Hz?  What about the mistunings of the other intervals?  Is<br/>it an average?</p><p>So (again; sorry...) maybe the effect I hear in a chord like<br/>5:8:12:15 (as mentioned above) is the beating which occurs around<br/>the chord tones.

It often seems that way to me<br/>&gt; (I &quot;hear&quot; most of my music before I get to realise<br/>&gt; it, either by playing it or creating a MIDI file of it).<br/>&gt; As I wrote earlier, I tend to hear gamelan and<br/>&gt; angklung music as timbral rather than tonal</p><p>tonal as in western harmony, or as in the Rameau-Erlich chord root?</p><p>, which<br/>&gt; could well be an effect of my learned interval<br/>&gt; categories filtering my perceptions.  Have you ever<br/>&gt; listened to any traditional Thai court music?</p><p>I recall Sethares had a chapter on it.</p><p>&gt;That&gt; is supposed to be tuned in 7-EDO, which would play<br/>&gt; merry hell with most of our JI interval categories ...</p><p>&gt; Also, I&apos;d like to consider the effect of the degree<br/>&gt; of mistuning.  Remembering that this group is about<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy (rather than colour theory or<br/>&gt; numerology ;-)), consider the shape of the HE curve.<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t it a bit like a normal distribution &quot;bell-curve&quot;<br/>&gt; in the region of each JI ratio?  IOW, doesn&apos;t the<br/>&gt; HE have a flattened peak spread around the exact<br/>&gt; ratios?  If so, here&apos;s a question that has long<br/>&gt; puzzled me: what bearing does this have on how we<br/>&gt; actually hear a mistuned interval?</p><p>That sounds like a good question for Paul!  My conviction --not<br/>based on any real psychoacoustics, everyone tells me  -- is that it<br/>would &apos;default&apos;, somehow, to the exact just ratio.</p><p>See ya mate!</p><p>Kelly</p></div><h3><a id=990 href="#990">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2006 1:56:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kelly,</p><p>On Wed, 22 Feb 2006, &quot;traktus5&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi trak,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Yahya.

So, refering here to &apos;difference tones&apos; as those between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; overtones (5-4, 8-5, etc) and not the amplitude &apos;wavering&apos;<br/>&gt; beating&gt; &gt; between nearly identical pitches, do difference tones<br/>&gt; themselves&gt; &gt; beat against a nearby partial or note?

(d) Beat-Notes and<br/>&gt; &gt; Differential Tones of his Appendix XX, on p. 530 of his<br/>&gt; &gt; translation of Hermann Helmholtz&apos; &quot;On the Sensations<br/>&gt; &gt; of Tone&quot;, several experiments using tuning forks, which<br/>&gt; &gt; confirm those reported by him made by R. Koenig, in<br/>&gt; &gt; which Ellis detects an *inaudible* difference tone (7)<br/>&gt; &gt; between the notes of a mistuned minor tenth (5:12), by<br/>&gt; &gt; its beating at 4.2 [Hertz] with an auxiliary tuning fork.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The specific numbers Ellis cites are for two cases:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mistuned minor tenth:<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; Lower generating fork . . . : 223.77<br/>&gt; &gt; Upper generating fork . . . : 539.18<br/>&gt; &gt; Difference tone . . . . . . . . . : 315.41<br/>&gt; &gt; Auxiliary fork . . . . . . . . . . . : 319.59<br/>&gt; &gt; Theoretical difference . . .:   4.18<br/>&gt; &gt; Observed beat frequency :    4.2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mistuned octave:<br/>&gt; &gt; -------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; Lower generating fork . . . : 223.77<br/>&gt; &gt; Upper generating fork . . . : 451.14<br/>&gt; &gt; Difference tone . . . . . . . . . : 227.37<br/>&gt; &gt; Auxiliary fork . . . . . . . . . . . : 223.77 (*)<br/>&gt; &gt; Theoretical difference . . .:    3.6<br/>&gt; &gt; Observed beat frequency :    3.6<br/>&gt; &gt; (*) No auxiliary fork was necessary, the lower fork<br/>&gt; &gt; serving.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ellis also states that he has repeated this experiment<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;several times&quot; with similar results.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, yes, difference tones *do* themselves beat against<br/>&gt; &gt; a nearby partial or note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe that&apos;s what&apos;s going on my 12 edo piano with a chord like<br/>&gt; 5:8:12:15...with the somewhat unusual manner in which the difference<br/>&gt; tones &apos;land&apos; on the chord tones, doubly nested, like I<br/>&gt; described...that would cause quite a high degree of beating between<br/>&gt; the difference tones and the chord tones, yes?  Since the piano is<br/>&gt; so unjust to begin with, and slighty &apos;mistuned&apos;...I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know...maybe there is a connection.</p><p>I&apos;d guess that the strongest beats would be those<br/>between the strongest partial tones in the chord.<br/>So if any difference does coincide with, or &quot;land<br/>on&quot;, a partial, that should (in most cases, depending<br/>on phase) increase the strength of that partial and<br/>therefore of its beats.</p><p>There was an issue of Scientific American I kept<br/>for many years featuring the inharmonicity of the<br/>overtones (upper partials) of piano notes.  From<br/>memory, the &quot;unjustness&quot; of the piano manifests<br/>mostly in the higher partials; at any rate, it was<br/>not enough for single notes to be &quot;very unjust&quot;,<br/>only &quot;interestingly coloured&quot;.  Certainly, tuning the<br/>piano in 12-EDO will result in very unjust thirds and<br/>sixths, and no good representation of the seventh<br/>harmonic; so that any common-practice triad or<br/>tetrad will be significantly different than just.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Does the fact that both beating and difference tones are a<br/>&gt; product&gt; &gt; of the hearing system, and not actually physically<br/>&gt; present in the&gt; &gt; sounding object, have anything to do with this?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not so fast!  Again according to Ellis, Art. 4. (a) Objective<br/>&gt; &gt; beats, p. 531 op. cit.:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Beats of a disturbed unison exist objectively as<br/>&gt; &gt; disturbances in the air before it reaches the ear.  They<br/>&gt; &gt; are reinforced by resonators, they disturb sand, &amp;c.<br/>&gt; &gt; In the case of the beats of harmonium reeds in Appunn&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; tonometer, they strongly shook the box containing the<br/>&gt; &gt; reeds.  Other beats, beat-notes and combinational tones<br/>&gt; &gt; appear not to exist externally to the ear.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah!  I&apos;ve never seen that described before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And on audibility of difference tones, why do textbooks I&apos;ve seen<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; usually say they are only audible under special circumstances,<br/>&gt; like&gt; &gt; high notes on the recorder?  (Wow, if you can&apos;t hear it, but<br/>&gt; it&apos;s&gt; &gt; having an effect, I wonder what&apos;s going on?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ellis also uses a similar example, of very high notes on<br/>&gt; &gt; a flageolet, but only as an extreme case that he feels<br/>&gt; &gt; best demonstrates the existence of the difference<br/>&gt; &gt; tones.  Note * on page 153, op. cit., on combinational<br/>&gt; &gt; tones, reads:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;I have found that combinational tones can be made<br/>&gt; &gt; quite audible to a hundred people at once, by means<br/>&gt; &gt; of two flageolet fifes or whistles, blown as strongly<br/>&gt; &gt; as possible.  I choose very close dissonant intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; because the great depth of the low tone is much more<br/>&gt; &gt; striking, being very far below anything that can be<br/>&gt; &gt; touched by the instrument itself.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (For the first time I just heard a good demo, &quot;Titchener Difference<br/>&gt; Tone Training&quot;, at <a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu">www.faculty.ucr.edu</a>)</p><p>Tried that link, but couldn&apos;t find it that site. :-(<br/>But I found the whole thing publicly accessible at:<br/><a href="http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/articles/schwitzgebel/">http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/articles/schwitzgebel/</a><br/>Very interesting stuff!  What was your experience<br/>of the training?  Did you try the pre-test?</p><p>[snip]<br/>&gt; I see.  &quot;Coincide&quot;, &quot;reinforce&quot;, means &apos;in tune&apos;.  ...</p><p>More than that, &quot;reinforce&quot; means &quot;increase the amplitude&quot;<br/>and hence &quot;increase the apparent loudness&quot;.</p><p>&gt; ... But playing in,<br/>&gt; or out of phase, do instrumentalists have any control over the phase<br/>&gt; of individual notes?  Or is that just in the laboratory, or midi<br/>&gt; instrument?</p><p>I think you&apos;re right.</p><p>Players of acoustical instruments have no effective<br/>control over phase.  Consider the following thought-<br/>experiment:  Under ideal conditions, a player strikes<br/>or produces a given note repeatedly, in exactly the<br/>same manner and with exactly the same force.  His<br/>or her instrument is capable of producing sound at<br/>frequencies in the range 20 to 40 Hertz.  Being a<br/>very competent orchestral performer on a responsive<br/>instrument, this player is able to deliver thirtysecond-<br/>notes (demisemiquavers) precisely on time in a presto<br/>tempo of 240 MM (bpm).  That amounts to 4 (metrical)<br/>beats per second, or 32 notes per second.  To say that<br/>these notes are precisely on time means that the player<br/>can deliver them with a maximum error of much less<br/>than half their duration, 1/64 second.  (Maybe she plays<br/>marimba, or maybe he&apos;s a drummer.)  As far as I can<br/>tell, the only way a performer can influence the phase<br/>of the note is by timing its attack.  (Conceivably a string<br/>player might be able to do this for each of the many<br/>tiny attacks caused by bowing, but I doubt it.)  For this<br/>paragon to control the phase of a note with frequency<br/>32 Hz, even to the crude extent of being in a particular<br/>quarter of the waveform&apos;s cycle, he or she must be able<br/>to deliver the attack accurate to the nearest 1/128<br/>second, with an error much less than half that, ie less<br/>than 1/256 second.  This is four times the accuracy we<br/>can reasonably expect from our expert performer.  Even<br/>if the player is twice as good as I&apos;ve suggested, it is still<br/>impractical to control the phase thru timing the attack.<br/>As for being able to control both the timing and the phase<br/>of individual notes independently, I fear that&apos;s impossible.</p><p>Your MIDI device - given the same player accuracy - would<br/>not do any better, I think, unless triggered by a MIDI file.<br/>In that case we have considerably more precision in timing<br/>the note attacks and thus their phases.  It might be<br/>instructive to write a piece with hemidemisemiquavers and<br/>very low notes to see whether we could achieve, say, phase<br/>cancellation.</p><p>In practice, this inability to control phase has the<br/>interesting consequence that whenever you play a<br/>justly tuned chord, the combination tones may vary<br/>all the way from total reinforcement of overtones<br/>already existing in the chord notes to their total<br/>cancellation!  You could hardly ever play the same<br/>chord twice - as one can only ever step once into<br/>the same river.  Maybe this is one reason why those<br/>musicians who like to have total control over the<br/>effects of the sounds produced by their music have<br/>gravitated towards 12-EDO - the beats of the<br/>differences with chord partials are more predictable,<br/>producing much the same sound each time a chord is<br/>struck?  Just an hypothesis - wouldn&apos;t be hard to<br/>test with the right equipment.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The degree of reinforcement may be less than perfect,<br/>&gt; &gt; depending on the relative phases of the two struck notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you actually play is a chord on the piano with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental frequencies =<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 33 * {2^(19/12), 2^(24/12), 2^(28/12), 2^(36/12)}, plus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overtones, with difference tones 33 * {their six<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differences}:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G2C3: 33*(4 - 2*2^(7/12)) = 33*(4 - 2.99734) = 33.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C3E3: 33*(4*2^(4/12) - 4) = 132*(2^(4/12) -1) = 34.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G2E3: 33*(4*2^(4/12) - 2*2^(7/12)) = 33*(2.04306) = 67.42098<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E3C4: 33*(8 - 4*2^(4/12)) = 132*(2 - 2^(4/12)) = 97.6668<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C3C4: 33*(8 - 4) = 33*4 = 132<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G2C4: 33*(8 - 2*2^(7/12) = 33*5.00266 = 165.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve used the approximation:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(1/12) = 1.0595<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose powers are:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(2/12) = 1.12254<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(3/12) = 1.18933<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(4/12) = 1.26010<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(5/12) = 1.33507<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(6/12) = 1.41451<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(7/12) = 1.49867<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(8/12) = 1.58784<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(9/12) = 1.68232<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(10/12) = 1.78242<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2^(11/12) = 1.88847<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Compare the results with the desired:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G2C3: 33.08778 ....... 33 ... 0.08778<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C3E3: 34.3332 .......... 33 ... 0.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G2E3: 67.42098 ....... 66 ... 1.42098<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E3C4: 97.6668 .......... 99 ... 1.3332<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C3C4: 132 ................... 132 ... 0<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G2C4: 165.08778 ... 165 ... 0.91222<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The third column of figures above gives the mistuning in Hertz.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There should be noticeable beating at around 1.3 Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why 1.3 Hz?

Remembering that this group is about<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic entropy (rather than colour theory or<br/>&gt; &gt; numerology ;-)), consider the shape of the HE curve.<br/>&gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t it a bit like a normal distribution &quot;bell-curve&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; in the region of each JI ratio?

I wish I had the<br/>&gt; equipment to amplify the decay and fool around with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Friend of mine tells the following<br/>&gt; &gt; parable:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; &gt; ... the<br/>&gt; &gt; more we know, the more we realise we don&apos;t know ...!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s great.
