(Sorry, but I keep forgetting that we&apos;re looking at this from<br/>opposite directions.)</p><p>&gt; i can tune 17:13 by ear, but i don&apos;t think that makes it consonant,<br/>&gt; or even necessarily locally consonant.</p><p>If you can hear the partials and eliminate the beats, then I would<br/>consider that a reason for calling 17:13 a local consonance -- not<br/>very consonant, mind you, but slightly more consonant than for its<br/>mistunings over a very, very small distance.</p><p>However, in my own experiments involving tones less rich in harmonics<br/>than unfiltered sawtooth waves, I didn&apos;t identify this as a local<br/>maximum consonance, but rather as a point of local maximum<br/>dissonance.  So perhaps we are in agreement about this particular one.</p><p>&gt; i do have an alternate set of<br/>&gt; curves (equally simple to compute) that show many, if not all,<br/>&gt; rational numbers at a local minimum of dissonance, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/margo2.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/margo2.gif</a></p><p>That looks more like what I had in mind.  (More comments below.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Still, this would indicate that it is not quite as<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant as the product of the integers would lead us to believe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; exactly. back to my original, default, &quot;smooth&quot; harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; curve formulation, these graphs point that fact out in vivid detail:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/stearns.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/stearns.jpg</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/stearns2.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/stearns2.jpg</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/stearns4.jpg">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/stearns4.jpg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/default.gi">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/default.gi</a><br/>f<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Something that I am suspicious about in your graph is that it<br/>doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; shown enough local points of maximum consonance.  Between 5:4 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 4:3, for example, I see a local minimum consonance at 448 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; without any indication that 9:7 is more consonant than a<br/>mistuning,<br/>&gt; &gt; something about which I had no doubt in my observations.  (The<br/>same<br/>&gt; &gt; could be said for 10:7.)  Now when it comes to an interval such<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; 11:9 (or even 11:8), the difference between it and a mistuning is<br/>&gt; &gt; very subtle -- my graph exaggerates the difference (reflecting<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; fact that you can hear a lot more under laboratory conditions<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt; you can in a musical performance) -- and I was completely unable<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; hear 16:13 or 17:14 as such -- but rather as points of local<br/>minimum<br/>&gt; &gt; consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps there is not enough resolution in the vertical direction<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; your graph -- 7:6 and 9:5 barely show up as consonances -- and a<br/>&gt; &gt; higher resolution might make a difference for 8:7 and 9:7.  (A<br/>bump<br/>&gt; &gt; in the road isn&apos;t going to show up on a topographical map, but I<br/>sure<br/>&gt; &gt; feel it when I drive my car over it.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it sounds like you&apos;d probably prefer the &quot;pointy&quot; formulation as in<br/>&gt; margo2.gif above -- let me know.</p><p>Yes, this is very much what I was looking for.</p><p>&gt; there&apos;s also the s (resolution)<br/>&gt; parameter which can always be tweaked to give more or less<br/>importance<br/>&gt; to more complex ratios (the better your hearing resolution, the<br/>more<br/>&gt; easily you can identify the complex ratios &quot;as such&quot;, because the<br/>&gt; complex ratios are in more &quot;crowded&quot; areas amongst all the ratios).</p><p>For that we can refer to my graph:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/consonce.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/consonce.gif</a></p><p>It appears that the point at which I no longer heard n:d as a local<br/>consonance is when n*d reached a value around 150 (with 16:9 and<br/>17:10).  So margo2.gif would have a little more sensitivity than what<br/>I observed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recently did some experiments with chord progressions<br/>involving<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suspensions in which two tones a small &quot;semitone&quot; apart<br/>resolve to a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minor or subminor third.  After trying different sizes of<br/>semitones<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in various keys, I came to the conclusion that 70 cents<br/>(~24:25) is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very close (closer than, say, 63 cents, ~27:28) to the most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmonically dissonant semitone.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&apos;t this *highly* dependent on register and timbre, though?<br/>maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on loudness as well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With my most recent experiments involving suspensions (to find<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; most dissonant semitone) I varied the timbres and registers<br/>somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; in reaching my conclusion.  I found that there is more to<br/>dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt; that just the beat rate -- there is also a psychological<br/>perception<br/>&gt; &gt; conveyed by a semitone of a given size that conveys an impression<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance that seems to be less influenced by (if not<br/>independent<br/>&gt; &gt; of) the register in which it is heard.  In connection with this,<br/>&gt; &gt; consider our perception in comparing two major thirds, for<br/>example,<br/>&gt; &gt; mistuned by the same number of cents, one wide and the other<br/>narrow.<br/>&gt; &gt; There is a somewhat different psychological perception associated<br/>&gt; &gt; with each that is a function of size (but independent of beating)<br/>&gt; &gt; that will influence our perception of dissonance.  (Might this be<br/>&gt; &gt; that an interval&apos;s melodic properties also come into play when<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; interval is heard harmonically?)  I believe that something of<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; sort played a part in my conclusion that the 70-cent semitone is<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; most dissonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, can you give a sense of *how much*, if at all, this<br/>conclusion<br/>&gt; is dependent on timbre and register?</p><p>In running my experiments I avoided the unusual and the extremes of<br/>timbre and register, inasmuch as I thought that these would be of<br/>less value than the usual and customary.</p><p>My timbres contained both odd and even harmonics, and I varied the<br/>amount of filtering of the upper partials.  This didn&apos;t seem to make<br/>much of a difference in judging the most dissonant semitone, since<br/>the source of the most obvious beating is between the fundamentals of<br/>the two tones.</p><p>I avoided extremes in register, staying within the two octaves or so<br/>centered around the F above middle C.  This is where we customarily<br/>hear chords in closed position.</p><p>As I said in another place, my experimentation was not so exhaustive<br/>as to try to pin down an exact value, say 70 as opposed to 68 cents,<br/>but it was enough to establish that value in preference to 63 cents.</p><p>I have recently had an extensive discussion with Margo Schulter (for<br/>whom I would presume margo2.gif was made) about what is the most<br/>effective size of semitone for melody, in addition to the most<br/>dissonant (and therefore effective) for harmony.  She is in general<br/>agreement with me in advocating a value of 70+-10 cents for both of<br/>these.  (And she insisted that this optimal range should include<br/>28:27, ~63 cents.)</p><p>I trust that this should give the chef enough information to work<br/>with to prepare the main course.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=603 href="#603">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2002 4:16:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In harmonic_entropy@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have recently had an extensive discussion with Margo Schulter<br/>(for<br/>&gt; whom I would presume margo2.gif was made)</p><p>yes, but i specifically offered it to her not because of the position<br/>of the global maximum of discordance (which i wasn&apos;t even looking at<br/>at the time), but because it shows ratios such as 17:14 as local<br/>minima of discordance -- margo likes to target such ratios in her<br/>tunings and the fact that the original, smooth formulations of<br/>harmonic entropy did not show local minima at such ratios led her<br/>to &quot;declare her independence&quot; from harmonic entropy -- so i offered<br/>this graph to her as a reconciliatory gesture. the newer, &quot;pointy&quot;<br/>formulation of harmonic entropy did not originate from margo&apos;s<br/>objections, though, but rather from the research of joos vos -- you<br/>should search for &quot;vos&quot; on the tuning list and see my 4-part summary<br/>of the beginning of one of his articles -- i&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be<br/>fascinated . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps there is not enough resolution in the vertical<br/>direction<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; your graph -- 7:6 and 9:5 barely show up as consonances -- and<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; higher resolution might make a difference for 8:7 and 9:7.
