Among the chords I use, I haven&apos;t found any other 4<br/>note chord, relatively high in the series, where every interval -- but<br/>for the outer interval -- is already  reduced.  I believe this is a<br/>result of the chord being only relatively high in the series (ie,<br/>above 16), with the chord tones 21 and 25 being only &apos;first order&apos;,<br/>and not multiples of those numbers, such as a chord whose harmonic<br/>series numbers are in the forties or fifties or beyond).  If height in<br/>the series is a factor in dissonance, couldn&apos;t this be relavent?</p><p>Regards, Kelly</p></div>
