From the<br/>writings of Paul Erlich of the late 90&apos;s on Tonalness (eg, the<br/>interview with Monz), mention was made of how the component dyads of a<br/>triad can have a higher tonalness than the overall triad.

The way the theory was presented seemed to imply<br/>that the ear only tries to hear a single root, or series, and any<br/>deviation from this (examle, dyads more tonal than the tetrad they&apos;re<br/>part of) is only an abberation.  Or, that ambiguity and multiplicity<br/>in root suggestiveness (eg, like which you get from the triad 12-15-<br/>20) is just a deviation from tonalness.  I agree it&apos;s a deviation from<br/>tonalness as the theory stands, but wonder why there is no<br/>psychoacoustical theory to account for what seem to be much more<br/>interesting chords (eg, 12-15-20 compared to 4-5-6.)
