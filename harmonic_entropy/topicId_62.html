This was based on curves where s=1%. Upon<br/>closer inspection, it seems like exp(entropy/2.3) is a better formula. I&apos;ll<br/>announce a couple of graphs showing this. Could this be because 2.3 ~=<br/>log(10), and 10=sqrt(1/1%)? I have no idea. Anyone have any heuristic<br/>arguments? Anyway, I guess I should try some with s=0.6% . . . .</p></div>
