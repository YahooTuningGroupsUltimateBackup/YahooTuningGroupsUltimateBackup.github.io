Reading Helmholtz, and reviewing where<br/>the semitone clashes occur in the partials of various intervals, does<br/>anyone know if the dissonance is affected by whether the beating<br/>semitone is diatonic (example, e-f, as the 5th and 4th partials of a<br/>perfect 4th) or chromatic (eg, B flat - B natural, as the 7th and 5th<br/>partial of the perfect fifth.)  Or maybe its&apos; a moot point,<br/>overshadowed, instead, by which semitone clash is composed of lower<br/>pitch numbers?  thanks, Kelly</p></div>
