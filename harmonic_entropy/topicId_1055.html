So what if the hearing system was on a different log scale, or<br/>not logarithmic at all (just additive), what would be the shape of the<br/>harmonic series?  (hee hee...trippy!!  what is the reality beyond our<br/>senses!)</p><p>And Does any one know....is the log scale of our hearing systme<br/>specifically log2?</p></div>
