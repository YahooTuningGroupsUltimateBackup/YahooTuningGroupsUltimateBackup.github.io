Just to whet your appetite for a bit, though,<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve been thinking that we should redo the dyadic ranking of the<br/>&gt;tetrads according to the maximum discordance, or at least the sum of<br/>&gt;squares of exponential entropies, rather than just summing the<br/>&gt;exponential entropies as we have been . . . but of course that&apos;s a<br/>&gt;topic for the other list, should you care to inquire further . . .</p><p>Yes, of course, this should wait until after the Microthon... I&apos;m<br/>expecting to sit there &quot;glued to my seat&quot; all day for the entire<br/>experience...</p><p>Well, this new ranking method sounds interesting... we can discuss it<br/>on the HE(man) list next week...</p><p>_________ ___ __ _ _<br/>Joseph</p></div>
