I thought 9:11 was the simplest example that falls in &apos;the<br/>&gt;ambiguous zone&apos; that is both sweet and distinct, i.e., not an &quot;out of<br/>&gt;tune&quot; 5:6 or a 4:5, and yet has a comparatively (and problematically)<br/>&gt;high product.</p><p>Yet the harmonic entropy model claims that, for this level of s, you have a<br/>rather low probability of hearing 9:11 as the 9th and 11th harmonics of a<br/>fundamental -- the reason that it&apos;s comparitavely concordant seems to be<br/>that the confusion is mainly restricted to a confusion between two ratios,<br/>5:6 and 4:5, while, for example, 7:9 involves confusion with 4:5, 3:4, and<br/>11:14; and 8:11 involves confusion with 3:4, 5:7, and 11:15.</p><p>&gt;BTW, why do you have the harmonic entropy archive &quot;private&quot;? It&apos;s a<br/>&gt;pain in the ass to have to sign in to access it every time...</p><p>Well I never consciously decided to make it private . . . I&apos;ll see if I can<br/>change that . . .</p></div>
