The outer interval is taken<br/>into consideration, but there is a downward slop on the Farey-based curve,<br/>making wider intervals look more consonant than narrow intervals with equal<br/>ratio-complexity. Thus, since the 9:12:16 has wider intervals than 3:4:5 but<br/>the three intervals are comparable in complexity, 9:12:16 gets at least as<br/>low a total dyadic entropy value as 3:4:5.</p><p>I should redo this using (a) the Tenney-based rather than Farey-based dyadic<br/>h.e., and (b) the triagular rather than square plot.</p><p>Paul.</p></div>
