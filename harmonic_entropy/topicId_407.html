I always get<br/>&gt; &gt; something like 194_ as best.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>I did some more investigation over the weekend.</p><p>The most successful experiment I did was to insert a<br/>complexity cap. This has the effect of constraining<br/>the precision of the &apos;ears&apos; by making some of the more<br/>remote consonances fall above the cap. What this does is<br/>decrease the number of local minima in the complexity<br/>graph. As I varied the cap, the &apos;best&apos; scale moved from<br/>204c to 194c.</p><p>Here is the RI interpretation of the Pythagorean major<br/>with three different caps. In the first case, 194c, with<br/>the same RI interpretation was the minimum. In the other<br/>two cases, 194 was a local minimum, but 204c was the<br/>minimum. 194 was also interpreted as 19/17 with the<br/>higher caps.</p><p>cap     RI                                          comment<br/>100    &apos;1/1 &apos;9/8 &apos;5/4   &apos;4/3 &apos;3/2 &apos;5/3   &apos;15/8      not minimum<br/>250    &apos;1/1 &apos;9/8 &apos;14/11 &apos;4/3 &apos;3/2 &apos;27/16 &apos;19/10     minimum<br/>500    &apos;1/1 &apos;9/8 &apos;19/15 &apos;4/3 &apos;3/2 &apos;27/16 &apos;19/10     minimum</p><p>So, the program is behaving pretty much as intended. If<br/>you assume that the &apos;ears&apos; are sharp enough to find those<br/>exotic thirds, then that plus all those 3/2&apos;s may well be<br/>a best tuning.</p><p>Other experiments that didn&apos;t pan out.</p><p>Summing instead of taking minimum produced a big mess,<br/>so I&apos;m doing something wrong. Unless someone tells me<br/>the formula for an HE point at a given value in cents,<br/>or the algorithm that produces it, I&apos;ll be investigating<br/>things using whatever method produces what I<br/>think may be &apos;similar&apos;.</p><p>Logs, prime factors, distance measures on the lattice<br/>etc tended to produce mostly the same results or noisier<br/>results (more rather than fewer local minima, with some<br/>of them at very bizarre points).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Oh, an IMPORTANT point (probably THE most important) is the<br/>&gt; &gt;data culling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not really understanding but it all sounds overly complicated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m just producing a list of perhaps a few hundred<br/>scales and wish to sort them into &quot;candidates to investigate&quot; and<br/>&quot;candidates not to investigate at the current time&quot;. Those to<br/> investigate should be local minima in a graph of &apos;B&apos; vs<br/>&apos;complexity&apos; or whatever measure is used.</p><p>With the &apos;really good ears&apos;, there are lots of local minima, whether<br/>analyzed by intervallic complexity or some combination of<br/>complexity and accuracy.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The point here is that harmonic entropy mixes complexity of<br/>&gt; &gt;the intervals being heard and the accuracy that they are being<br/>&gt; &gt;produced at. Until I feel that I am mixing them in a sensible<br/>&gt; &gt;manner, I&apos;ll get more trustworthy results by seperating them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, OK. I&apos;m here to help you with the mixing. I don&apos;t think the<br/>&gt; two can be &gt; separated, actually -- in harmonic entropy they&apos;re<br/>&gt; pretty much one and the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might want to look over the discussion of octave-equivalent<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy models and graphs.</p><p>Yeah, I should probably just go back to the archives. On the other<br/>hand, I can blindly move forward and perhaps find something<br/>interesting.</p><p>thanks,</p><p>bob</p></div>
