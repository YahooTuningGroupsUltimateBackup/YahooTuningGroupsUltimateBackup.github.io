I just posted on that to the tuning list. Actually,<br/>that&apos;s quite a coincidence -- continued fractions are to the MOSs of<br/>the Scale Tree as the Ferguson-Forcade algorithm is to the 3-step-<br/>size scales I brought up in the &quot;hyper-MOS&quot; thread over on the tuning<br/>list -- which no one has attempted to tackle yet (perhaps we should<br/>send the questions to Erv?)</p><p>&gt; What exactly was Carl&apos;s question or the musical application?</p><p>It has to do with harmonic entropy, of course! In the dyad case, the<br/>mediants partition the interval axis into non-overlapping, exhaustive<br/>pieces, one for each ratio in the Farey, Mann, or Tenney series of a<br/>given order, in a way that seems most &quot;natural&quot; in that the ratios of<br/>the next higher-order series always fall exactly on the borders --<br/>the mediants. This partition is then used as the probability function<br/>in the harmonic entropy calculation. The question is, how do we<br/>generalize this to triads?</p><p>I think we can live without the solution for now, since:</p><p>a) in the dyadic Tenney case I found that one could approximate the<br/>partition sizes rather accurately with the inverse geometric mean of<br/>the numbers in the ratio -- I verified that the weighted sum of these<br/>remains essentially constant as one moves one&apos;s Gaussian window along<br/>the interval axis -- and renormalize these to define one&apos;s<br/>probability function, and get essentially the same results as using<br/>the mediant-defined partition. In the triadic case, we don&apos;t know the<br/>partition sizes but if we can verify that the weighted sum of the<br/>inverse geometric means remains constant as one moves one&apos;s Gaussian<br/>window around the triadic plane, we can probably live with that<br/>approximate solution and never have to worry about the &quot;real&quot; one.</p><p>b) I recently brought up the idea of using this inverse geometric<br/>mean idea with _all_ ratios, not just those in lowest terms. Clearly<br/>the probability function no longer corresponds to a non-overlapping<br/>partition of the interval axis, but continuing to use the inverse<br/>geometric mean of each &quot;ratio&quot; as its probability (up to<br/>normalization) yields a harmonic entropy function that looks like the<br/>_exponential_ of the one obtained from just the lowest-terms ratios.<br/>This is very interesting to me as it reflects the acoustical reality<br/>that virtual fundamentals can sometimes correspond to ratio-<br/>interpretations that are not in lowest terms, though the rule for<br/>probabilities remains unjustified in this case . . .</p></div>
