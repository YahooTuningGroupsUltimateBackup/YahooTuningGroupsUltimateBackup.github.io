UK contributors, of which I am one, might find large downloads to<br/>be expensive as we generally pay our phone companies in pounds of flesh. I<br/>am often unsure as to which files I should be downloading to refer to the<br/>&apos;subjective&apos; discussions that take place on ranking and so on.</p><p>Perhaps something in the form of  an individual tuning lab project set out<br/>in a single post to the list would be helpful. Lots of intensive listening<br/>seems to take place, followed by heated debate, then the whole discussion<br/>evaporates. I think that a summary of results would be worth the effort.</p><p>If this is unfeasible then I&apos;ll try a bit harder to put all the pieces<br/>together myself. Keep up the excellent work.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Keep up the excellent work.</p><p>With all due respect there are only about 300 messages in the archives so<br/>far, so I think you could try to go over them and try to tie together<br/>whatever loose ends you may have. We certainly are far from tying up all the<br/>loose ends ourselves and at some point I hope we begin to go about this more<br/>systematically, beginning with dyads, and proceeding to triads from there,<br/>with tetrads an almost unthinkably distant goal.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
