The first one seems to cause the<br/>partials &gt;to<br/>&gt;mostly line up with each other, while the second one causes them to beat<br/>&gt;against each<br/>&gt;other.<br/>&gt;Or it may be that they both beat, but the second one beats at a rate that<br/>&gt;makes it more obvious.  I&apos;ve noticed that this phenomenon is fairly<br/>frequent &gt;among<br/>&gt;otonal/utonal pairs in general.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;#33:  [0_184__388___886]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Warbling? I&apos;ll get back to you tomorrow. I<br/>&gt;&gt; hope you aren&apos;t using &quot;Lo-Fi Play&quot;!</p><p>&gt;Nooooo.  D-loaded Joseph&apos;s zip file.  I&apos;ve listened on two different<br/>systems, &gt;a pair<br/>&gt;of pretty nice, if soft sounding, speakers at work, and Altec cubes with<br/>sub-&gt;woofer<br/>&gt;at home.  When I say &quot;warbling&quot; I mean beating.</p><p>Are you sure? See below.</p><p>  This tetrad beats harder than &gt;any<br/>&gt;other in the list, to my ears.  It&apos;s the only one to which I had a negative<br/>&gt;reaction.  When I listen to it and it&apos;s &quot;partner&quot; back to back, they don&apos;t<br/>&gt;even seem<br/>&gt;to be in the same ballpark in terms of the concordance/discordance<br/>continuum.  &gt;I may<br/>&gt;be confusing pure concordance somewhat with my acculturated sense of<br/>tonality, &gt;do you<br/>&gt;think?</p><p>When I listen to the tetrads (0_184_388_886 and its partner 0_498_702_886),<br/>I could almost call both of them &quot;beatless&quot;, and what beating I do hear is<br/>pretty much the same in both chords. The high guide tone of the<br/>0_184_388_886, which is two octaves above the 388, beats about 3 times per<br/>second -- in the 0_498_702_886 I hear a beat at about 4 times per second two<br/>octaves above the 702, and a lower beating about 2 times per second. So in<br/>that sense I disagree with you, but I do know what you mean by &quot;warbling&quot;.<br/>It is much like Joseph Pehrson&apos;s remark on September 1st about another<br/>utonal chord:</p><p>&gt;the utonal 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4... which doesn&apos;t really BEAT in a timable<br/>&gt;fashion, but which has a certain &quot;wobble&quot; to it that is different<br/>&gt;from the otonal perception.</p><p>What is this sensation? I might even call it a &quot;gurgle&quot; rather than a<br/>&quot;wobble&quot; or &quot;warble&quot;. It&apos;s definitely not a beating you can count, that<br/>happens at a regular rate, the way beating is supposed to. It almost seems<br/>as if different notes in the chord are fighting for prominence, and the<br/>power shifts rapidly among them, rather than achieving a nice equilibrium<br/>the way it does in the otonal chord. Does this description make sense to<br/>you, David and Joseph?</p><p>I think this sensation may very well be the &quot;confusion&quot; of harmonic entropy<br/>-- tetradic harmonic entropy, that is, which the geometric mean ranking<br/>gives a good ranking for, for the simpler chords. In the 0_498_702_886, the<br/>498 is clearly heard as the root -- in fact, it&apos;s almost hard to hear the 0<br/>as the bass note. The whole chord, despite some slight cricket-chirping due<br/>to the slightly detuned intervals, sounds integrated in its projection of<br/>the harmony. The 0_184_388_886 chord, though certainly what I would describe<br/>as a very &quot;smooth&quot; chord, seems to be unbalanced and almost vertiginous in a<br/>sea-sickness-inducing kind of way. I believe that this may be due, in part,<br/>to the central pitch processor&apos;s inability to find a sure &quot;root&quot; for this<br/>chord (the numbers in 36:40:45:60 may just be too high -- too many other<br/>interpretations confuse you) -- in other words, harmonic entropy.</p><p>Another explanation is that the roughness is in fact greater for the<br/>0_184_388_886 than for the 0_498_702_886, not because of beating upper<br/>partials, but because of beating fundamentals -- and masking. Both chords<br/>have a pair of fundamentals which are 184 cents apart. That corresponds, in<br/>the 0_184_388_886 chord, to a beat rate of 33 beats per second (precisely<br/>where Helmholtz put his dissonance maximum), and in the 0_498_702_886 chord,<br/>to a beat rate of 50 beats per second. Both so fast they should really be<br/>called &quot;roughness&quot; and not &quot;beating&quot;. The difference is due to masking --<br/>the phenomenon by which any frequency suppresses the apparant volume of<br/>frequencies above it, but not those below it. So the lowest note of each<br/>tetrads is always heard as loudest. Since, in the 0_184_388_886 chord, the<br/>lowest note is within another note&apos;s critical band, producing prominent<br/>roughness, while in the 0_498_702_886 chord, it isn&apos;t, the first chord sound<br/>rougher than the second.</p><p>Neither explanation would give the 0_184_388_886 a prominent, countable rate<br/>of beating, as opposed to 0_498_702_886. Nor do I hear one. So David, are<br/>you sure about the statement:</p><p>&gt;When I say &quot;warbling&quot; I mean beating.</p><p>? If you are, please say so, and try to time how fast this beating is taking<br/>place. There may yet be another explanation . . .</p></div><h3><a id=163 href="#163">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

Does this description make sense to<br/>&gt; you, David and Joseph?</p><p>Yes, though I hadn&apos;t thought about it that way before.  Hmm.  Yes, I find it a very apt<br/>description, and one that should be generally applicable, beyond the confines of Western<br/>Common Practice theory.</p><p>&gt; I think this sensation may very well be the &quot;confusion&quot; of harmonic entropy</p><p>You mean we&apos;re not just banging our heads against the wall?  Oh, good. :-)</p><p>&gt; In the 0_498_702_886, the<br/>&gt; 498 is clearly heard as the root -- in fact, it&apos;s almost hard to hear the 0<br/>&gt; as the bass note. The whole chord, despite some slight cricket-chirping due<br/>&gt; to the slightly detuned intervals, sounds integrated in its projection of<br/>&gt; the harmony.</p><p>Agreed.  The crickets are sweet.  I like the term &quot;integrated.&quot;</p><p>&gt; The 0_184_388_886 chord, though certainly what I would describe<br/>&gt; as a very &quot;smooth&quot; chord, seems to be unbalanced and almost vertiginous in a<br/>&gt; sea-sickness-inducing kind of way.</p><p>Bingo!  Smooth but vertiginous.</p><p>&gt; I believe that this may be due, in part,<br/>&gt; to the central pitch processor&apos;s inability to find a sure &quot;root&quot; for this<br/>&gt; chord (the numbers in 36:40:45:60 may just be too high -- too many other<br/>&gt; interpretations confuse you) -- in other words, harmonic entropy.</p><p>A ha!  I love it when a plan comes together.  So utonal chords really can have higher<br/>harmonic entropy than their otonal Siamese twins?</p><p>Thanks so much for the clarification of the difference between beating and roughness, and<br/>for the reminder about how masking factors in.  Very helpful.</p><p>&gt; Neither explanation would give the 0_184_388_886 a prominent, countable rate<br/>&gt; of beating, as opposed to 0_498_702_886. Nor do I hear one. So David, are<br/>&gt; you sure about the statement:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;When I say &quot;warbling&quot; I mean beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ? If you are, please say so, and try to time how fast this beating is taking<br/>&gt; place. There may yet be another explanation . . .</p><p>I hear several distinct rates at once.  Most are slow, in the &quot;chorusing effect&quot; range,<br/>like it&apos;s sibling has.  The offender seems to beat somewhere in the upper teens per<br/>second.  It&apos;s too fast to get a firm count, and every time I think I&apos;ve got a track on<br/>it, it seems to mysteriously change rates.  This could be related to the<br/>vertiginousness.  In general, it feels like driving on a washboarded dirt road.  There&apos;s<br/>a neutral third that seems to get implied somehow.  The fiercest clash is between the<br/>actual major third fundamental and the ghostly implied neutral third.</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right that the chord is relatively sweet.  All 36 are.  We&apos;re splitting<br/>some pretty fine hairs here, and for good reason.  I find that when I listen to 0 184 388<br/>886 &quot;out of the blue,&quot; it sounds pleasant.  When I listen to most others in the Lab<br/>first, it suddenly grates on my nerves by comparison.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
