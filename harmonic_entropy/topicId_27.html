If I can hard-code all the amplitudes to 1 it will make my code a<br/>&gt;*lot* simpler.</p><p>Hi Ed.</p><p>Bill e-mailed me off-list to tell me that the &quot;amplitudes&quot; are in dB and not<br/>really amplitudes at all. The conversion from amplitude to dB is dB =<br/>10*log(amp)/log(10) + c, where c is a level-setting constant.</p><p>Now there&apos;s something about the results that worries me . . . for example,<br/>if I run the program for a triangle wave (where the &quot;amplitude&quot; of the<br/>harmonics decreases at 6 dB/octave) with a certain fundamental dB and then<br/>for a square wave (where the &quot;amplitude&quot; of the harmonics decreases at 3<br/>dB/octave) with half the fundamental dB, I get identical curves, other than<br/>scaling. However, if I use a fixed waveform and simply adjust the volume up<br/>or down (by adding a constant to all the dBs), I get very different curves.<br/>Is that the way it&apos;s supposed to work, Bill?</p></div><h3><a id=28 href="#28">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

They&apos;re present in any waveform, their extent depending on your<br/>arbitrary choice of a zero-dB point, but they contribute perversely to the<br/>normalization above (the dB numbers could easily sum to zero, or to a<br/>negative number) . . . and you don&apos;t really mean &quot;energy&quot; above, since<br/>energy goes as the square of the amplitude, while dBs measure log-amplitude<br/>-- correct?</p><p>&gt;Im a little surprised at this, because a square wave only has odd partials,<br/>&gt;while a triangle has both odd and even.</p><p>Nope, a triangle wave(/\/\/\/\/\) has only odd partials.

Meanwhile, your model ranks 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4<br/>as much more concordant than either 8:10:12:15 or 12:15:18:20, both of which<br/>Joseph thought should be near the top of the list (feel free to jump in<br/>here, Joseph)!</p></div><h3><a id=33 href="#33">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2000 12:54:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@egroups.com">harmonic_entropy@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

Maybe I&apos;m using the term &quot;roughness&quot; too broadly.  I mean mainly how much<br/>beating there is between the tones, and how &quot;hard&quot; it beats.

The first one seems to cause the partials to<br/>mostly line up with each other, while the second one causes them to beat against each<br/>other.  Or it may be that they both beat, but the second one beats at a rate that<br/>makes it more obvious.  I&apos;ve noticed that this phenomenon is fairly frequent among<br/>otonal/utonal pairs in general.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;#24: [0_]498__702__1086<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a common chord in Mozart, where it<br/>&gt; resolves to a chord such as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -1200_386_702_1200.</p><p>Where it does what?  ;-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;#26:  [0_]312__702___888<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also known as a minor sixth chord, it is a<br/>&gt; very common ending chord in Salsa and<br/>&gt; other latin styles (well, at least the 12-tET<br/>&gt; version is).</p><p>Ah, context.  Having been reminded, I&apos;ve heard latin jazz pieces end that way.  I<br/>thought it peculiar - guess that reveals my bias.  As to the 12-equal version, it<br/>seems to distribute the beating in such a way as to kind of mask it, or to beat at a<br/>rate that draws less attention to it.  This tuning of it still sounds more tense to<br/>me than any of those I placed above it, even thinking of it in a latin jazz cadential<br/>context.  Perhaps it&apos;s a mistake to equate tenseness with discordance?  I&apos;m open to<br/>that.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And there&apos;s a 576 cent interval between the second<br/>&gt; &gt; and forth notes - that&apos;s probably a pretty strong color in anybody&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; book.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 576 cents sounds a lot like 7:5, only 7 cents<br/>&gt; flat. Perhaps I need to use a larger s value so<br/>&gt; that 7:5 and its vicinity does not get such a<br/>&gt; concordant rating.</p><p>On your HE charts, 7:5 sits in a shallow dip between two pretty tall peaks.  In fact,<br/>it&apos;s valley dips only about as low as the top of the peak between 6:5 and 5:4.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;#32:  [0_]388__776__1090<br/>&gt; [snip] I wonder why the<br/>&gt; &gt; program chose to sharpen the second and fourth tones, while leaving<br/>&gt; &gt; the third one true?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is the third one &quot;true&quot;?</p><p>Whoops.  Miscalculated.  It&apos;s about 3 cents sharp to 25:16.  You know, this one ties<br/>for 27-28 on the T Lab page.

I&apos;ve listened on two different systems, a pair<br/>of pretty nice, if soft sounding, speakers at work, and Altec cubes with sub-woofer<br/>at home.  When I say &quot;warbling&quot; I mean beating.  This tetrad beats harder than any<br/>other in the list, to my ears.  It&apos;s the only one to which I had a negative<br/>reaction.  When I listen to it and it&apos;s &quot;partner&quot; back to back, they don&apos;t even seem<br/>to be in the same ballpark in terms of the concordance/discordance continuum.

Of<br/>course, this tetrad carries special tonal meaning that may have made Mozart<br/>more likely to use it than some other chords of similar discordance . . .<br/>and may have made you less inclined to accept this as a &quot;closing sonority&quot;<br/>than other chords of similar concordance.</p></div><h3><a id=162 href="#162">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
