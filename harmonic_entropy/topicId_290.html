According to Pierre&apos;s quote from<br/>&gt;the now-censored Wolfram site, Brun&apos;s and all other algorithms known<br/>&gt;before 1991 failed in certain cases to act as a generalization of the<br/>&gt;continued fraction algorithm for two-term ratios, with all relevant<br/>&gt;properties thereof. While the point is moot for the problem of simply<br/>&gt;approximating a certain proportion with a given restriction on the<br/>&gt;integers involved, since a brute-force computer search is fast enough<br/>&gt;these days, for the much larger problem of partitioning the 2-d plane<br/>&gt;according to a generalized mediant function.</p><p>&gt;Note the emphasis on the _iterative_ nature of the procedure -- that<br/>&gt;property seems essential to its applicability to the generalized-<br/>&gt;mediant problem. Or maybe we&apos;re barking up the wrong tree . . .</p><p>Why don&apos;t we focus on the link between the Euclidean algorithm and<br/>the mediant process.  We won&apos;t know what properties we need to generalize<br/>before we understand the 1-D case.</p><p>I&apos;ll be traveling to California tomorrow, to return on Sunday.
