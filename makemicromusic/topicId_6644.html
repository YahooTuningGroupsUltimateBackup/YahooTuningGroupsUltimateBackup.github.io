I.e. the earlier portable<br/>computers. Multi-tasking would have been useful<br/>then as now. They had it on mainframes before then<br/>when they were set up with many terminals each connected to the<br/>same computer, each user single tasking, but the computer multi-tasking,<br/>so you would think that if the value of it had been understood,<br/>it could have been done on personal computers too,<br/>not in such a versatile way as in Windows, Macs and<br/>modern Linux, maybe in the same way as your<br/>reference to unix describes it. I know that Windows<br/>was late in the game as far as multi-tasking on a<br/>single user machine was concerened.</p><p>But I don&apos;t know much about that part of the history<br/>- I was out of the loop during the transition<br/>from mainframe to personal computers as my academic<br/>research at the time didn&apos;t need computers at all<br/>except for word processing.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
