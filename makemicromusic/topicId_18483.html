Moreover, the flag I put there was incorrect, being not of the Netherlands but rather of the Netherlands Antilles islands off the coast of Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea! Ugh. My apologies to anyone else who was offended.</p><p>Any other native speakers of Spanish, Italian, German, French, or Portuguese, please tell me if the translation is so offensive that it should be removed. My idea is to reach out, not to offend. Maybe all the &quot;translations&quot; should be removed?</p><p>Please let me know by email. Thank you!</p><p>But this message does have tuning content. Calculate the Intonation Quality of an ET, get a pitch name from a frequency in Hz, and an interval name from a decimal or ratio using the Hunt system online calculators. Give them a try and see what you think.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/theory/huntsystemcalc.html">http://www.h-pi.com/theory/huntsystemcalc.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3>iranief &#x3C;carlo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2008 10:55:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I checked the Italian one. it&apos;s not offensive but funny for sure.<br/>:-)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Andrew Hunt<br/>&lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any other native speakers of Spanish, Italian, German, French, or<br/>&gt; Portuguese, please tell me if the translation is so offensive that<br/>it should be removed.</p></div>
