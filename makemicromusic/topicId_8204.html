The impossible shapes artwork is a lot of fun, and I<br/>think the Klingon language &quot;Rojqoq&quot; may be the first Klingon song<br/>ever written by an Earthling ;)</p><p>I also don&apos;t know anyone else as fond of 10-ET other than Gary<br/>Morrison. I think you should promote this as &quot;Metric Music&quot;, and see<br/>if some international standards organizations will accept this as<br/>the official international tuning standard. And perhaps 100 10-tone<br/>instruments could form a HectOrchestra --and all vocal music in this<br/>tuning would have to be in Esperanto of course, at least here on<br/>Earth ;) And the metric instrumentalists of course would have to<br/>play on instruments producing 10-ET &apos;sethartic&apos; partials.</p><p>(The rest of us, especially from this list, might have to form anti-<br/>metric music leagues, should this catch on too well ;)</p><p>Your timbral philosophy also has resonance with my experience. For<br/>example, my Mom, who loves common practice classical music &amp; detests<br/>most 20th+ century classical music, had a hard time hearing me<br/>practice Prokofiev&apos;s 5th piano sonata (&apos;radical&apos; Prokofiev for the<br/>uninitiated, not so mild as &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;), while even<br/>enjoying choral music with the same harmonies.</p><p>Especially lovely was &quot;Over Venus&quot; with its E. Indian sitar-ish<br/>expressive melody--very moving.</p><p>For your next exomusicological release, you might have fun<br/>experimenting with free vocal synthesizers like Flinger<br/><a href="http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/flinger/fldoc.html">http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/flinger/fldoc.html</a></p><p>or MBrola<br/><a href="http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html">http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html</a></p><p>Yours from a small corner of planet Earth, in the early 21st century,<br/>Harold</p></div>
