Let me know what you think. I would<br/>really like to do more, and have a queue of other pieces to do from<br/>these composers and more.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to be part of the first wave of the Tsunami of listeners<br/>who are dying to hear more microtonal music, send me an email and give<br/>me the location, permission, and a short paragraph on what it is. I&apos;m<br/>posting info on the service to all the Podcast directories I can find.</p><p>Podcast site: <a href="http://podcast1024.blogspot.com">http://podcast1024.blogspot.com</a><br/>RSS feed to subscribe to: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024">http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024</a></p><p>Prent</p></div><h3><a id=8004 href="#8004">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

If I didn&apos;t have the platform<br/>and broadband, I would probably give up too. At the moment it&apos;s mostly<br/>geeks talking to geeks about geeky things on the Podcasts. My hope is<br/>that their desire for music to become a part of their nacent broadcast<br/>efforts will drag along some of my podcasts as filler, intro&apos;s, etc.</p><p>At least until the tools are ready for prime time. They aren&apos;t right now.</p><p>Prent</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

Though a 24mb download just to install another app seems a bit whack. :)</p><p>Anyhow, I&apos;ll probably make more use of this once the cable guy comes, but I like your format, and you make a pretty damn good dj!
