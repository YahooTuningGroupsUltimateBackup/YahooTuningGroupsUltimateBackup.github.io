Of<br/>&gt; course, sometimes you want that reverberant effect, so fire away.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s a whole science behind this as far as I know (and use). Depending on the music style, sustain pedal is used for:</p><p>- emphasizing volume and color of the sound (by using sympathetic resonance)</p><p>- connecting arpeggiated chords together, keep the bass note</p><p>- make a impressionistic fog, reverb</p><p>- make special effects - quarter pedal, half pedal, resonating sound after silent pressing the chords, pianoverb with some other instrument playing into the piano etc.</p><p>Did I forget something?</p><p>Many music styles don&apos;t need pedal at all or not much (all music before let&apos;s say Beethoven, lot of contemporary music, lot of jazz, rock)...

So yes, you&apos;re<br/>missing something.  :P</p><p>&gt;&gt; Almost everyone uses the sustain pedal frequently (if gingerly).<br/>&gt;&gt; Gould is a notable exception. There are also plenty of artists<br/>&gt;&gt; who just leave it down, to good effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s a hallmark of pianistic technique that you use the pedal only<br/>&gt;when you need it, rather than as a crutch.</p><p>That&apos;s a standard line, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s very informative.<br/>For counterpoint, you shouldn&apos;t use it much at all.  Other styles<br/>(not necessarily ones they teach in schools) may &quot;need&quot; it all<br/>the time.  Personally, I started out using lots of pedal in the<br/>&apos;90s, went through a phase where I never used sustain but used the<br/>soft pedal 100% of the time (2002-2006), and now I&apos;m coming to a<br/>synthesis of these (or think I am, if I had ever any damn time to<br/>play between the job and two kids).</p><p>&gt;&gt; There&apos;s no way to do it and maintain mechanical linkage.<br/>&gt;&gt; You&apos;re talking about solenoid-actuated hammers at this point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If that&apos;s the only way to go, then I hope it&apos;s possible to get that<br/>&gt;to feel organic enough.</p><p>That&apos;s the trick.  With physical modeling and the right kind<br/>of transducer, I could make you believe my box was an acoustic<br/>harpsichord, clavichord, or piano (check out the Roland V-Piano<br/>if ye doubt) IIFF the action was responsive.  Unfortunately,<br/>NO digital action has EVER been made that&apos;s responsive (except<br/>perhaps a Mark IV Disklavier or Bose CEUS, and that&apos;s cheating<br/>because it&apos;s still a piano).  I never thought I&apos;d hear myself<br/>say this, because I&apos;m a huge fan of acoustic music, and I hate<br/>sampled instruments and knew they&apos;d never produce a truly<br/>realistic result (the &apos;90s were hell, but finally we&apos;re getting<br/>some physical modeling that&apos;s really kicking butt).</p><p>&gt;The problem there is that the tangents would have to be<br/>&gt;logarithmically closer together as the pitch got higher.</p><p>But you never have to go too much higher before you can use a<br/>different string.
