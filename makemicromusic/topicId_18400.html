<a href="/makemicromusic">back to list</a><h1>leaving list discussions; invitation to join H-Pi forum</h1><h3>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2008 2:51:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have decided to limit my involvement in TL and MMM to announcements only. I have found that taking part in list discussions places an unnecessary burden on me as the sole representative of my business to be a savvy public relations individual (which I am not), and I believe it may place others in a slightly uncomfortable position in their interactions with me as well, which seems to me not quite in the intended spirit of a public forum. I am trying to set limits for myself, to simplify and organize in order to keep on top of things, both business and family related. I enjoy the lively discussions and wonderful music I become aware of through these lists, as well as the positive connections I make with other list members (which I hope will continue). It should be noted that up to this point on TL and MMM I have posted to correct points of fact and to attempt to clarify possible misperceptions about H-Pi products; I will no longer do this. Though announcements may be posted from time to time, they will not be intended to start discussion threads, and it should not be assumed that I am reading any other discussions, though I do hope to be able to drop in and see what&apos;s happening now and then. I welcome anyone in need of clarification of anything related to H-Pi products to contact me directly through email or through the business website, and I encourage anyone who wants to discuss H-Pi products in an environment where I am involved to join the H-Pi Instruments Community:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/index.php">http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/index.php</a>&gt;</p><p>A footer notice in each announcement will reiterate this information. The forum is not in any way intended to mirror or replace the TL or MMM forums. It is to be focused on the things I am inventing, developing, programming, building and selling, so that they can become better through your input. This includes things already made and being sold, as well as things not yet made, which can be anything imaginable. I will actively post announcements there and contribute to the Prototypes discussions, but will not be very visible in the other areas. I do appreciate your support in all these endeavors, of course I wish all of you the very best in all of your adventures, and I hope to see you involved with the improvement of existing and the development of new H-Pi products.</p><p>Yours Sincerely,<br/>Aaron Andrew Hunt<br/>H-Pi instruments<br/><a href="http://www.h-pi.com">http://www.h-pi.com</a></p></div>
