At the moment, I would consider only Lime, Finale, and Harmony Assistant worthwhile. Sibelius and Turandot continue to promise more, but those promises are still vapor, and I would really like a decent program from the open source world, but haven&apos;t encountered it yet.</p><p>Lime can do the microtones directly, but is limited to its own fonts, and a tuning table with only 35 places (giving pitch bend values for seven nominals plus 28 accidentally-altered nominals. I don&apos;t know if you can use more than one table in a single notation file -- but it&apos;d be worth finding out).  The notated output is decent, but you&apos;re pretty much stuck with Lime&apos;s style book. On the plus side, the program is inexpensive.</p><p>I have written before that I think Harmony Assistant represents one of the ways notation and production packages will look in the future and it is very flexible.  However, because the whole environment is radically different to other notation packages, I have not yet found my own working rhythm in HA. It achieves its flexiblity from writing &quot;rules&quot; which is a great idea, but I really do not want to do much programming at this point in my life, so it remains pretty much a toy.</p><p>So Finale is my workhorse. Many people are enthusiastic about Sibelius that I really would like to like it more, but the philosophy still seems to be that there is only one optimal way of doing anything and that&apos;s the Sibelius way, and you have to do it the way Sibelius wants you to do it.  That means a very nice house style, but very little room to personalize it.  That means a nice interface, but basically only one interface. In contrast Finale continues to try to serve every need, and is flexible in the extreme, if at the cost of being (or appearing to be) somewhat cumbersome to use, although some of the third party plug-ins make this much less so (TG Tools is the essential plug-in package).  I like the fact that Finale lets me input via command-line text, midi keyboard, mouse clicks, or computer keyboard, working with fonts is easy, and I can do microtones in a number of ways. Mostly, I just set up a non-standard key signature (in Finale there is no fixed number of nominal or accidentals, but the accidentals have to have constant +/- scale step values), and do playback during my composing on my sound card&apos;s synth controlling the pitch bend with InTun, which has very low latency. If I need to render an audio file, I export a midi file, and render it directly with WAVMaker, or add pitchbend in Scala and render it elsewhere.</p><p>(In the long-term, the advantage of HA over Finale will be that the environment allows for the production of microtonal audio files directly from HA, rather than exporting midi files and rendering them in a separate program.)</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=13408 href="#13408">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2006 12:30:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Daniel Wolf has recently recommended Harmony Assistant, I believe...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I keep trying out every notation program that comes out, looking for an<br/>&gt;optimal flexible, professional-quality notation program with microtonal<br/>&gt;notation AND immediate playback.</p><p>Have you seen Notion?</p><p>&gt;Lime can do the microtones directly, but is limited to its own fonts,</p><p>Lime does interactive playback?
