That should be all that<br/>one needs to do.</p><p>I&apos;ll think over best way to do it.</p><p>Making a single archive does seem an interesting idea, for those<br/>who want to use both programs, depending on the practicalities.</p><p>If one were to try to keep it up to date all the time,<br/>I&apos;m not sure how well it could actually work with number of<br/>uploads of FTS beta, SCALA, and the SCALA scales and modes archives.</p><p>Here is one idea though - on next release of FTS (prob. next year the way it is<br/>going...), could do an extra edition of the installer with SCALA in it as<br/>well if that were thought a good idea (JM too if there were a version of<br/>it ready for release by then). Both would almost instantly<br/>become out of date I expect, but would help those coming new to microtonal<br/>music, who could then download the later versions later once they&apos;ve<br/>tried it out for a while and &quot;got their feet wet&quot; as it were.<br/>In terms of size, the whole bundle wouldn&apos;t be that large for those<br/>with fast connections.</p><p>Practicalities again intervene here - as with Manuel, I don&apos;t think I have anything<br/>like enough space for this either, at least not in my ntlworld site<br/>that I plan to use for programs downloads presently. Maybe another tripod site,<br/>one can have as many of those as one likes, but some people have trouble downloading<br/>files from tripod. Could investigate other possibilities, maybe try some of<br/>the program download sites that keep their own copies of a program, and<br/>if that were suitable, do a link to it from the download pages of FTS<br/>and SCALA. Ones I know of are simtel - they only do zips, not installers,<br/>and Shareware Music Machine, which likes to have an installer.<br/><a href="http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/FractalTuneSmithy/">http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/FractalTuneSmithy/</a></p><p>If it was an installer, one could get it to do the SCALA desktop shortcut<br/>as well - that many people end up making themselves, and dragging SCALA itself onto the<br/>desktop instead of makaing a shortcut there. (Easy to do - on checking it<br/>once I found a number of programs on the desktop that I&apos;d thought were<br/>shortcuts :-))</p><p>Would have to list the combined installer as shareware in the<br/>description - that may be a problem as SCALA is free - could say<br/>something about that though in the description next to it.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
