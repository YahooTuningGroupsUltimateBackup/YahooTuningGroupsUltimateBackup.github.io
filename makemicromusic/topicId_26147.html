And we find the 5/4 major third.<br/>We play a 1/1 5/4 3/2 major triad and go &quot;yes! that sounds good and in tune, much better than the 81/64&quot;.<br/>So people have logically said that 5/4 is the &quot;justly intoned&quot; major third.<br/>However.. 3 major thirds of 5/4 don&apos;t make an octave. You can&apos;t multiply 5/4 by itself and get to 2/1.<br/>And that IS a problem for practical music making.<br/>And there are many many more problems the 5/4 causes like wolf fifths and drifting chord progressions etc.<br/>But after tasting the sweet 5/4 major third we can no longer accept the 81/64 major third as in tune.<br/>Coupled with a lot of evidence that choirs and trombone quartets etc naturally sing/play a major third as 5/4, the 5/4 has become THE just intoned major third.<br/>Similarly, in classic 5-limit JI 6/5 has become THE minor third.</p><p>Now what I&apos;m saying, is that this whole concept of 5/4 or 6/5 being THE major and minor thirds is wrong.<br/>Not only does it not work mathematically in actual music, but it sounds wrong too - even in specific situations when there&apos;s nothing wrong with it mathematically.</p><p>Here 3 examples:</p><p>1/1 3/2 2/1 12/5 -&gt; 3/2 15/8 9/4<br/>If you play this chord progression with a stable electronic sound with enough overtones where you can hear the pitch well (listen carefully, it can be very subtle depending on your ears and speakers as well), you&apos;ll find that it doesn&apos;t sound right.<br/>Now why wouldn&apos;t it? There&apos;s no mathematical impossibility here. It&apos;s a simple 1/1 6/5 3/2 minor followed by a 1/1 5/4 3/2 chord a fifth higher.<br/>Also try it as 1/1 6/5 3/2 &lt;-&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 back and forth. Sounds terrible too.<br/>Now play 1/1 3/2 2/1 64/27 -&gt; 3/2 15/8 9/4. Yes that one does sound right. And so does 1/1 32/27 3/2 &lt;-&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2.<br/>And play 1/1 3/2 2/1 12/5 -&gt; 3/2 256/135 9/4 -&gt; 1/1 3/2 2/1 12/5. That one sounds right too.<br/>And 5/4 3/2 15/8 -&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 2/1 sounds right too.<br/>So it&apos;s not the 1/1 6/5 3/2 in itself that sounds bad, nor the 1/1 5/4 3/2.<br/>But certain combinations of 1/1 6/5 3/2 and 1/1 5/4 3/2 that sound bad and clearly call for other ratios.</p><p>Another example:<br/>1/1 3/2 9/4 27/8 4/1 5/1 -&gt; 27/16 5/2 27/8 4/1 5/1 (and hold the 5/1 during the progression)<br/>Doesn&apos;t sound good does it.<br/>1/1 3/2 9/4 27/8 4/1 81/16 -&gt; 27/16 81/32 27/8 4/1 81/16 (hold the 81/16 during the progression)<br/>This one does sound good.</p><p>Try the I-vi-ii-V7-I circle progression in the following scales:<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>The ii gets a wolf here. Doesn&apos;t sound good (but I long thought this was the best answer possible, how blind was I to the simple solution that comes next)<br/>1/1 9/8 81/64 4/3 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1 (for the final I chord in this progression one can make the 81/64 a 5/4)<br/>This one sounds good.</p><p>So nothing is really impossible mathematically.<br/>It&apos;s just that the original assumption that the major third should always be 5/4 and the minor always 6/5 was clearly wrong.<br/>(and going to higher harmonic limits only makes the problems worse, I&apos;ve explored that road fully)</p><p>Further experimentation/research eventually lead me to western music moving in a chain of fifths with one other chain of fifths a 5/4 parallel to it.<br/>Fifths are always 3/2, octaves are always 2/1. To break these rules is to break &quot;musical coherence&quot; or &quot;musical continuity&quot; (there may be an exception for wolf fifths on passing notes, still experimenting with this, though likely the outcome will be that this is also not allowed)<br/>Other rules I&apos;ve found is that there are to be no comma shifts in held notes. And I&apos;ve found rules on stepsizes.<br/>Also found that (don&apos;t know how to really call it though) these rules collapse the 2 chains of fifths into these notes per octave available at any one time (it can shift from chord to chord)<br/>1/1 135/128 9/8 32/27 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 405/256 5/3 16/9 15/8 2/1<br/>(note, this is NOT a fixed scale for a key or something like that, this thing shifts around like crazy along the chain of fifths when one plays music.)<br/>don&apos;t confuse the 1/1 point of the above &quot;scale like thing&quot; with the tonic. Any 1/1 5/4 3/2 or 1/1 6/5 3/2 in it can be the lowest resting point.</p><p>More to tell but that&apos;ll come on my website later.<br/>I hope you get somewhat of an idea of how it works mathematically. Or of how it can work.<br/>At it&apos;s basis lies a different concept of what&apos;s &quot;in tune&quot;, one that actually sounds good :)<br/>And in tune as it turns out is not captured at one one fixed time, but is relative to what came before and what comes after.</p><p>-Marcel</p><p>From: Mark Stephens<br/>Sent: Sunday, February 27, 2011 10:51 PM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [MMM] &quot;perfect JI&quot;</p><p>But then I joined this group and started reading posts about &quot;perfect JI&quot;<br/>working equally well in &quot;all keys&quot; for &quot;all songs&quot; and kept &quot;hitting a wall&quot;...<br/>I just have a fundamental lack of understanding how that can work.</p><p>Michael basically summed up my JI question very well when he wrote:</p><p>&lt;Isn&apos;t it fair enough to say temperaments can be explained as rounding between<br/>fundamentals of JI IE...you are getting &quot;more ratios near perfectly<br/>Just...instead of less ratios that are exactly/perfectly Just?

And now you&apos;re saying how shitty the<br/>&gt; Untwelve entries were because they all sound out of tune, which you<br/>&gt; obviously did to get a rise out of people. This is the very definition<br/>&gt; of what &quot;trolling&quot; means.</p><p>No I never did anything to troll.<br/>The closest I&apos;ve come to trolling was to do things like use the name &quot;Marcel&apos;s JI&quot;, or recently call compositions &quot;songs&quot; because I think it&apos;s such nonsense that people find it reason to behave so negatively to Michael and wish to show him some support and at the same time sort of give the finger to all those whiners.<br/>But it&apos;s more of a silent resistance things than trolling because I do not hope in any way that it provokes another response.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; At some point, you actually had a decent line of research to work out,<br/>&gt; which was to figure out some kind of optimal way to retune meantone to<br/>&gt; JI. But that line of inquiry, which is a fairly interesting thing to<br/>&gt; work out, has been completely buried by your penchant for<br/>&gt; self-aggrandizement, which frankly comes off as arrogant and<br/>&gt; repugnantly so. You have never posted an apology for any of the things<br/>&gt; you have said, nor have you tried to make amends with anyone. And you</p><p>Yes I have apologised several times, and I just about allways try to make ammends with people.<br/>I usually start out with polite on topic posts, often trying to be helpfull.

None of this matters because it&apos;s not what you&apos;re known for in the community and it&apos;s not really what your goal is. If your goal was just to do some research to find the most pleasing way to expand meantone harmonies out into JI, then you wouldn&apos;t have received a thousandth of the negative reaction that you have.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A real problem on this list now as I see it, is people telling each other what their supposed &quot;goals&quot; are and then framing them for it...EVEN after they make apparent deliberate efforts to change their way.<br/>&nbsp; Not to say Mike B/&quot;you&quot; intended it that way, but it sure sounds like it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcel finally &quot;turned around&quot; and started giving practical examples that basically the entire list had been begging him for (IE &quot;either prove it or be quiet&quot;).&nbsp; However instead of saying &quot;ok, now we&apos;re getting somewhere, thank you...but I still see some problems with your theory which are...&quot;, you, Carl, and several others apparently are more interested in holding grudges against Marcel.&nbsp; The only person on this entire thread I think has given an informative response to Marcel far as his theories (completely with criticism, but framed constructively)...is Igs.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Instead, you exploded onto the scene and boldly proclaimed that you had the One True Tuning system, and said that everything else besides your JI system du jour sounded like shit....Possibly the most cardinal sin of all is that when you actually posted your results for people to see, and people didn&apos;t like them, you humorously said that it&apos;s because they needed to &quot;learn how your system was superior&quot; and to get used to it&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the one truly nasty thing I agree Marcel did and keeps doing.&nbsp; But that doesn&apos;t automatically cancel his efforts either.&nbsp; At the least, I suggest replying to him &quot;I see some value in these efforts and that you&apos;re headed in a positive direction, but that certainly does not make your answer THE only answer or perfect&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You dismissed all of the tuning theory that had ever been developed before you (have you actually read anything by Erv Wilson, ever?),&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; Between this thread and the &quot;Beatles&quot; thread...I really wish this is one thing people would just drop.<br/>&nbsp; Just because someone is well known in music should not mean that you either have to agree with their artistry or be labeled an ignorant idiot.&nbsp; Personally I haven&apos;t found any of Wilson&apos;s MOS&apos;s over 6 tones satisfactory to my ears...despite the mathematical elegance of his theories.&nbsp; Same goes for Harry Partch and o-tonality and u-tonality...both of which I understand but neither of which I fully agree with (and o-tonality of which I agree with much more)..&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&quot;But that line of inquiry, which is a fairly interesting thing to work out, has been completely buried by your penchant for self-aggrandizement&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Igs said it best:<br/> essentially (as I understand it) that Marcel is coming up with a system of when to use more strict JI style chords and when to use pythagorean-style chords in order to introduce tension and resolve in places composers in common practice music use them most.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I figure we can either take paths of<br/>A) Starting arguments based on pre-conceptions of each other&apos;s personalities (especially with reference to &quot;deserved&quot; personalities IE people famous in the world of microtonality)<br/>B) Work on actual theories and not care who said them or try to guess why.&nbsp; Granted, if there is a PROBLEM you see with a theory, go and point it out.&nbsp; But do so saying something like &quot;I need an example before I believe this, can you give me a specific example?&quot; or &quot;There is a problem with this theory I see in that it uses such high-numbered fractions despite being called JI...this needs to be explained if I am to take the theory<br/> seriously.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ATTACKS (on theories, not people) ARE WELCOME AND AT TIMES NEEDED FOR PROGRESS, BUT LET&apos;S AT LEAST FOCUS ON CRITICIZING THE THEORIES RATHER THAN THE PEOPLE...I figure that would make things around here a whole lot more productive, not to mention more civilized.</p></div><h3><a id=26168 href="#26168">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2011 8:11:29 PM</span><button style="float: right;

step size making it &quot;Hyper MOS&quot; can also sound distinctively diatonic.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; How to say this as simply as possible...<br/>A) People seem to prefer scales with as few very small steps as possible and, where they exist, for them to be maximally seperated.ALA the diatonic scale<br/>B) People seem to prefer scales where rotations in chord progressions (and not just the intervals involved in making the chords themselves) are pure or at least near-pure fifths.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you can make like I do and go a bit off the deep end and use weird intervals like 12/11 as &quot;semitones&quot; and the occasional resulting 22/15-like ratios as fifths...but, at least as I&apos;ve found through listening practice,&nbsp; people are still going to notice.</p><p>&nbsp; Even my &quot;flagship&quot; hybrid scale, which has both 2 maximally spaced apart semitones and 2 maximally spaced apart &quot;bad&quot; 22/15 fifths (making in many way a diatonic-like formation)...a fair percentage of people who commented on the scale (I&apos;d say, something around 20%) said the 22/15 still bit them the wrong way despite their &quot;diatonic&quot; positioning.<br/>&nbsp; And that contrasts to my &quot;Arab&quot; mode of the scale where the 2 22/15 &quot;bad&quot; fifths are not maximally spaced and more like half of people said &quot;this sounds too weird&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lesson learned...people seem to insist on pure fifths and diatonic patterns in scales...which typically seems to point straight toward common practice music...even more so than my attempts to &quot;blend between diatonic scales under Meantone and Mohajira scales&quot;.&nbsp;
