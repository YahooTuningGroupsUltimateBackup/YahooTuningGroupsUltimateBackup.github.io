It works like this for me:</p><p>1) see some gear<br/>2) wonder how I could utilise it more fully, possibly as an instument in<br/>itself<br/>3) experiment, understand, incorporate<br/>4) from here, move on to coneptualizing an idea, back to original path</p><p>Recently, I have been trying to see if I can &quot;play&quot; my digital recorder.<br/>This has been interesting to do things it was never really meant to do,<br/>but I can&apos;t record on it while I do them. So I have to record onto<br/>something else while I play. It feels funny to tell your wife that you<br/>can&apos;t record the cool song you just made because you had to play the<br/>recorder to get it. Then again, it is good justification to get another!<br/>*laughs, knowing this is NOT happening*</p><p>DaveX</p></div><h3><a id=349 href="#349">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2001 3:33:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Young un:</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/cm_main.html">http://www.corporeal.com/cm_main.html</a><br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Dave X</p><p>  Jon--</p><p>  First off, who is Harry Partch?
