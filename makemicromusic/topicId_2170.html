IOW, there could be many people, esp from the composer/live performer area, that are not more than passingly knowledgeable about these items, and usually only that the word &quot;reverb&quot; is recognized. Bottom line is that the preset for the various signal processors listed as &quot;general purpose&quot; (or the one &quot;general purpose with reverb&quot;) made a marked improvement over his dry recording, yielding depth and air. For a slam dunk situation, where a newbie might be sending out a demo, could we ask for more?</p><p>I&apos;m not suggesting it will replace racks of Lexicons and a good audio desk, but who would have thought, a few years ago, that one could do this in their bedroom with a computer and *no* additional hardware?</p><p>Specific items:</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;How good is top quality?  Reverb&apos;s one of those things that&apos;s very &gt;difficult to get perfect.  Did they?</p><p>Right, I understand. For 10 minutes work, it sounds fine. Consider how few hours, nay, *minutes*, of studio time in a well-stocked studio, with a good engineer, you would get for $200. You want better, you either start building up a studio, buy one of the dedicated reverb programs, or be happy with the charms of something better than what you have now.</p><p>&gt;Is there any way of widening the field for headphones, to emulate speakers?</p><p>Interestingly enough, they mention headphones in their &quot;Mastering...&quot; document that I spoke of. And they spoke of the caveats. Frankly, I don&apos;t think anyone would want to do a mix that would be specifically for headphone listening (unless it is a binaural recording to start with). The image widening can certainly take it beyond... the norm.</p><p>As for headphone listening and appropriate soundstage, I think it is more incumbent on the listener to work with this, as I wouldn&apos;t expect a live recording of an orchestra in a hall to be then mixed for headphones. As such, I use a gizmo called the &quot;HeadRoom Little&quot; - <a href="http://www.headroom.com/">http://www.headroom.com/</a> - as a dedicated headphone amp. It is built around a processing circuitry that subtly cross-feeds signal with some damping (don&apos;t quote me) to eliminate the dead spot in the middle of your skull (this is only an audio application - the dead spot that produces my daily stupidities is still fully functional).</p><p>Frankly, I love it, and try to not use headphones without it when possible (headphones of choice: Grado SR-60, which are ugly as sin but only about $60 and worth 3 times that...)</p><p>&gt;Unique???</p><p>In that there is a diagram of the 6 processor modules, and you can alter the order in which they affect the signal stream. I would have to guess &quot;unique&quot; is some marketing flack speaking, but maybe they do it better or easier than other plugins...</p><p>&gt; &gt; - Compare your mixes with a powerful spectrum analyzer that offers real<br/>&gt; &gt; time and average modes, snapshots, and more<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Haven&apos;t we had this before?</p><p>Sure. But here it is, and integrated part of the tool. They talk in the Mastering document about how to use it to set the para EQ to balance the recording system with your monitoring system. Again, if there are people who haven&apos;t ever done this before, it&apos;s a boon.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s only $200 which is remarkably good value if it works well.  And if it<br/>&gt;can do all that in real time in software it must be pretty darn good.  I<br/>&gt;can&apos;t spot anything that it&apos;s missing.</p><p>I *was* running it in realtime, and you can turn the preview on and off to mute the effect. I&apos;m on a P4 1.2ghz with 512 ram, so lighter systems might balk, but the insane part is that these plugins utilize other DirectX libraries (graphics mostly, I would imagine) so the software itself is incredibly small.</p><p>&gt;How do you get DirectX plugins working?  I downloaded the demo of &gt;Cakewalk&apos;s amplifier and tape emulation plug-in, but don&apos;t have anything &gt;to run it in.  A full version of their sequencer should do the trick.</p><p>I would suggest checking out the 90 free trial of Samplitude, which is *certainly* about the nicest virtual mixing studios I&apos;ve seen. Works like a charm integated right into the mixing desk. So you can work with it in a DAW program like this or ProTools, or you can use it simply to process a single stereo wave file in an audio editor like Sound Forge or CoolEdit.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s a WinAmp plugin as well as the DX one, so you can apply it to &gt;anything you download.  In fact, that has a semi-serious use, because I&apos;ve &gt;found (with Blade, I haven&apos;t tried with Lame) that wide band noise &gt;compresses very badly to MP3.  So this is a perfect tool for correcting that.</p><p>No, it&apos;s an item to *add* noise!
