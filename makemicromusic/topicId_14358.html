The biggest problem to my ears is the accuracy<br/>of the 9:8.  But for many purposes it&apos;s quite satisfactory.  41-tET,<br/>though not a meantone, is better if you can afford 10 more notes.<br/>Of course, if you&apos;re satisfied with the diamond by itself, it has<br/>only 29 notes in pure JI.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=14382 href="#14382">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2006 11:34:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>the Eikosany has 20 tones to the diamond s31</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Erv Wilson&apos;s stellated CPS scales are similar in that they&apos;re a<br/>&gt; bunch of otonal and utonal chords connected by common dyads, but<br/>&gt; they share no single pitch (consequently, they have more notes/octave<br/>&gt; in a given odd limit than Partch&apos;s diamonds).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=14383 href="#14383">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2006 12:03:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You&apos;ll notice I said *stellated*.

Can&apos;t wait to hear the 300-tET version.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know any name for this type of chord progression (maybe<br/>&gt; somebody else does) other than it sounds like a bit of pedal<br/>&gt; point...<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_point">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_point</a><br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl</p><p>That is a sort of pedal point.</p><p>I should point out that there are _functional_ tonal passages (T-S-D7) that I am not sure if they are intended or not. That functionality is the subject of the following comments.</p><p>[I am calling &grave;&grave;block&apos;&apos; each one of the chords sequences on a single pedal tone.]</p><p>The initial chord of each block is (by its structure) a dominant seventh chord; the immediate continuation seems to neutralize its tonal effect, although the memory, helped by the pedal tone, can recall (or even hold) the original function (V7).</p><p>After various chords, in each block, the before-the-last chord is a major chord with major seventh, which sounds like a rest point, after some suspensive/tense sonorities, and the bass coincides with the fundamental of the chord. It resembles, by its structure, a _tonic chord_ (after all, the pedal is its fundamental). To me, it is like a sudden _jump_ to the _dominant_ region (remember that the initial sonority has the structure of a dominant chord, and the same fundamental tone hold as pedal). In other words: the initial dominant chord is adorned is several ways until be retaken, but suddenly changed into a major seventh chord, becoming this way a tonic chord, function that is then _confirmed_ by the following two chords.</p><p>The next chord is 4/6 on the same bass, which functional interpretation is: _subdominant_ (second inversion) on a tonic pedal.</p><p>Then, the whole block is tranposed fourth down (or fifth up, for the bass), arriving to the dominant seventh chord, now in a context in which it is really a dominant (V7), due to the previous chords (I-IV).</p><p>Then the sequence continues, again jumping suddenly to the dominant of the dominant (and presumably so on). It is fully tonal, though there are no complete cadences or modulations.</p><p>The passages between the blocks sound hard to me, due to the skips of the bass from a 4-6 chord to another note, exactly in the moment in that the traditional tonal relations become explicit. I think those skips might work with different harmonic relations.</p><p>I am writting these comments only to ask you if you have really the intention to use such traditional tonal _progressions_ (I-IV-V7) in your piece, since you wrote before:</p><p> &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>So I start with a simple melody, in this case just a circle of<br/>alternating 7s up, 5s down. From each of these root notes, *any*<br/>consonant or unstable triad in any key can be built as long as it<br/>contains the root note. *There&apos;s no functionality going on here* , except that a phrase has to begin and end on a consonance.<br/> &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>I should note still that when one put the axis pitch in the bass, starting and ending as fundamental of the chords, the whole sequence results subject to that fundamental, and a strong centricity arises. That centricity -- according to the actual sequences of chords -- may be   functional (tonal) or not (kind of modal). If the axis pitch were in a _middle or top voice_ , it would be easier to build *non-functional sequences* (instead of functional _progressions_), since the *fundamentals* could indeed change inside a single block.</p><p>That is a suggestion you can try with: put the axis in a middle or top voice, and try (if you wish) avoid simple tonal chord progressions.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Hudson</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ O Yahoo! est&#xFFFD; de cara nova.
