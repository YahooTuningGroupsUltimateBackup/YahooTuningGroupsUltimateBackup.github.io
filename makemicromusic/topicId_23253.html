I am fascinated. I will reply in more detail later, but first I have one piece of advice: If you have an instrument with only 2 frets, you can have seperate bridge position adjustment for each string (as is standard for electric guitars) and seperate nut position adjustment for each sting (or a fixed compensating nut and fixed compensating bridge which some might prefer on an acoustic instrument). Together, these 2 adjustments allow you to fine tune every single fretted note perfectly. (aswell as your design this also applies to the Dune Encyclopedia version of the Baliset, which has 7 strings tuned C F B E A D G in 7 edo that can be fretted to provide the 7 edo notes in between, together with 2 bass drones of adjustable tuning.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ixlramp&quot; &lt;ixlramp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a design idea for a xenharmonic electric harp guitar.

Not wanting to be limited to 12 an octave is one of the things (but nowhere near the only thing) that puts me off synthesisers, since I think I would find it much harder to make or buy and non 12 midi controller than to make a mechanical instrument. My theoretical solution has been to have one string for each note in the scale and have the strings tuned by length, not tension or mass per unit length. This allows for tunings with different numbers of notes in an octave. To change from one tuning to another quickly on the same instrument, I think I could use boards that impose set strings lengths without altering tension. Each note on each board could be adjusted, but you swap one board for another to change many notes simultaneously (similarly you can have movable frets on interchangable fingerboards for melody strings on sitar like instruments). Also, if each string also had a part that was free to vibrate but the same length for all strings, this would make for quick tuning.

Not wanting to be limited to 12 an octave is one of the things (but nowhere near the only thing) that puts me off synthesisers, since I think I would find it much harder to make or buy and non 12 midi controller than to make a mechanical instrument. My theoretical solution has been to have one string for each note in the scale and have the strings tuned by length, not tension or mass per unit length. This allows for tunings with different numbers of notes in an octave. To change from one tuning to another quickly on the same instrument, I think I could use boards that impose set strings lengths without altering tension. Each note on each board could be adjusted, but you swap one board for another to change many notes simultaneously (similarly you can have movable frets on interchangable fingerboards for melody strings on sitar like instruments). Also, if each string also had a part that was free to vibrate but the same length for all strings, this would make for quick tuning.

I have made some progress with one of my own designs. It would take too long to describe how it works. I will describe the workings when I have successfully built and tested it.  The design resembles a harp or santoor. You have a different instrument for tunings with a different number of notes in an octave. The instrument has a range of 3 or 4 octaves. You tune it using sliders. Each slider controls not just one note, but the all the notes that are a whole number of octaves from that note. Each note can be retuned over a range of about 2 octaves. Hopefully you will also be able to move the sliders during play for dynamic tuning, portamento and vibrato. The way the instrument is played is a separate issue from the way it is tuned. I am thinking of harp style, hammered dulcimer style or a style I have invented myself which combines making chord shapes on a keyboard with the left hand to operate dampers to block notes you don&apos;t want with plucking with a pick held in the right hand (almost like an auto harp)</p></div><h3><a id=23339 href="#23339">ðŸ”—</a>Mark &#x3C;mark.barnes3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2010 6:02:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m using my phone so I can&apos;t check through all the posts. If I have made this point before then I am sorry for repeating myself. One of the things that interests me about your design is that it strongly resembles one of the traditional ways to play lyre. Some lyres have 6 or 7 strings tuned to one octave of a hexatonic or heptatonic scale and allow the use of harmonics to get notes an octave above the notes the strings are tuned to. This interests me for quite a few reasons. One is that the instrument I play most often is the &quot;lyre-guitar&quot; inwhich the force of guitar strings is taken by a lyre-like frame allowing a variety of microtonic fretboards to be removed and swapped one for another without having to loosen the strings. Another reason I am interested in the lyre is that lyres and harps are thought to be the instruments used by Celtic, Norse and British bards, who&apos;s tradition I aspire to.

This allows quick retuning to almost any xenharmonic scale just by using the guitar tuners.</p><p>Hi Kraig :) What I mean is I am identifying 7EDO as the average of all the heptatonic scales that will be used.</p><p>Since a guitar string has a usable retuning range of perhaps +/- 3 semitones from a medium-light tension it&apos;s essential to choose the correct string gauges so that almost all most heptatonic scales can be tuned to without each string either getting too tight or too loose.</p><p>To choose gauges one needs to know what the average pitch of each string will be, and then choose a gauge so that the string has medium-light tension at that pitch.</p><p>So the &apos;standby&apos; open tuning is 7EDO at absolute pitches, the average tuning of all future heptatonic tunings. This tuning therefore also has the average total tension. So the instrument is set-up (truss rod adjustment, intonation for each string, bridge saddle heights for each string) while in the &apos;standby&apos; tuning.</p><p>This design idea has many disadvantages and is fairly crazy. That&apos;s because I initially developed it as one way of cheaply and reversibly converting a standard fretted guitar or bass into a xenharmonic instrument, just by buying a custom set of single strings.</p><p>My other idea which is a little more promising is &apos;bichromatic tuning&apos;, explained in great detail here: <a href="http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=527">http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=527</a></p><p>Mat Cooper</p></div><h3><a id=23374 href="#23374">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2010 2:10:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mat,</p><p>Your computer&apos;s clock is set back a week or so...  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=23375 href="#23375">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2010 2:11:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hi Mat,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Your computer&apos;s clock is set back a week or so...</p><p>...or are these more delayed Yahoo deliveries?  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=23381 href="#23381">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2010 12:27:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry about my duplicated posts. To explain, roughly a week ago I sent 3 posts which didn&apos;t show up in the messages list. So the next day I re-wrote and sent similar messages again, this time successfully. The original unsuccessful posts have now all appeared, to my amusement and slight embarrassment.
