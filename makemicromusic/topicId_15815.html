Thanks.</p><p>Hi Dan,</p><p>It&apos;s quite attractive, thoroughly musical, and such dissonance as it<br/>evinces is probably mostly in the mind ... I believe your choice of<br/>an inharmonic bell timbre provides enough vertical dissonances among<br/>partials of each note to swamp any vertical dissonances between notes.</p><p>I was wondering why it felt slightly Javanese, then realised<br/>belatedly that it&apos;s sort of in three sets of 5-EDO.  (Need sleep.)</p><p>Supposing you want to MAKE a really dissonant piece, why not perform<br/>the same piece with a strongly *harmonic* timbre instead?  Or use<br/>bells (with strong inharmonic partials) tuned with their prime notes<br/>in a small subset of low-prime JI?</p><p>One comment on your blog suggested you might highlight the &quot;melody&quot;<br/>by a different or variant timbre.  I don&apos;t feel that&apos;s at all<br/>necessary for this piece to work well; I will replay this quite<br/>happily *exactly* as I first heard it.  Thanks for the music!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=15856 href="#15856">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 7:48:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;microtonaldan&quot;<br/>&lt;microtonaldan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think of this as a little study in dissonance.

I don&apos;t know if that was there the first time, but I was having trouble with it the other day. (At least the player on the blogspot page works, but the esnips page doesn&apos;t have a &quot;play&quot; option that I can see anywhere.)</p><p>This has a nice scale with a bit of a pelog flavor to it, which fits well with the timbre of the bells. But I think the dissonance of the bell timbre obscures whatever dissonance there may be in the music. I agree with X. J. Scott&apos;s comment on the page that it could use some variation in timbre.</p><p>In any case, it&apos;s always good to hear someone getting some good use out of 15-ET; it seems that everyone does something a little different with it.</p></div><h3><a id=15906 href="#15906">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2007 10:02:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did get it to work this time by clicking on the play button.

Now it works for me,<br/>too.<br/>Funny piece - reminds me a little bit the Harry Potters movie. And does<br/>not sound that dissonant at all to me...<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
