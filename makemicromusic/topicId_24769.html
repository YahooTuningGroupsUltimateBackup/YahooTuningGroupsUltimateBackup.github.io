What is FSOL?&quot;</p><p>    Future Sound of London....very experimental ambient electronica group which<br/>makes towering existentialist-sounding collages...  They don&apos;t use pianos a<br/>lot...but the mood sounds familiar to some of their music, particularly on their<br/>album &quot;Dead Cities&quot;...  Side note: Solo (back on Traxinspace) was/is a huge fan<br/>of theirs...and you can hear some of that mood/flavor in his tracks as well.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
