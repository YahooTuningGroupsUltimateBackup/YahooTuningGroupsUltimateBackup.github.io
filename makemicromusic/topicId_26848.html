Even so,&nbsp;many of them will tend to interpret a designation<br/>of &quot;pop&quot; as a little bit of an insult of as an intentional&nbsp;&quot;slap in the face&quot;.</p><p>The magic key to&nbsp;reducing the tension would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;agree to make a simple<br/>distinction between a smaller and more specific&nbsp;genre of music called &quot;pop<br/>music&quot; and a much, much larger, panoramic designation&nbsp;called &quot;popular music&quot;.</p><p>As we consider whether we are willing to do so, it isn&apos;t just a matter of<br/>bending over backwards to avoid stepping on Michael&apos;s toes.&nbsp; In general, I have<br/>found that contemporary music fans of the rock era who have grown up without<br/>instruction in classical music tend to speak about &quot;pop music&quot;&nbsp;very differently<br/>than people who spend most of their time - or who formed their musical world<br/>view - within the&nbsp;realms&nbsp;of classical music.&nbsp; The classical world tends to speak<br/>about &quot;pop&quot; music with a wide panoramic viewpoint that the general populace does<br/>not.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the general contemporary music enthusiast&nbsp;considers &quot;pop music&quot; to be&nbsp;a<br/>subset of popular music, they tend to perceive certain statements as dissmissive<br/>or as insults when they are not intended to be (as well as other times when they<br/>are intended to be...)</p><p>Since&nbsp;Wiki is the ultimate authority on everything... ;-)&nbsp; The&nbsp;article you cited<br/>said that &quot;pop&quot;&nbsp;is a special kind of &quot;popular music&quot;.</p><p>&gt;...special kind of popular music, featuring short, simple songs often oriented<br/>&gt;to the young and inclusive of at least some rock or soft rock and roll.&quot;&lt;</p><p>This actually does hit very close to the public distinction between the specific<br/>designation of &quot;pop&quot;&nbsp;versuse the wider description of&nbsp;&quot;popular music&quot;.</p><p>In the extreme, for &quot;pop&quot;, think of Miley Cirus, The Jonas Brothers, Justin<br/>Bieber, The Spice Girls, Britney Spears, etc.</p><p>Ever since I can remember, most contemporary&nbsp;musicians have viewed themselves&nbsp;as<br/>distinct&nbsp;from (often even a snooty step&nbsp;&apos;better&apos; than)&nbsp;pre-fab cookie-cutter<br/>flavor of the month pop stars.&nbsp; In general, they feel that they *believe* in<br/>their *music* on some deeper level than the &quot;song and dance&quot; stars who rely more<br/>on image and glamour than upon music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Did you know that there are &quot;fans&quot; of the singer&nbsp;&quot;Beyonce&apos;&quot; who almost never<br/>listen to her music!!&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this be?&nbsp; Well, these &quot;fans&quot;&nbsp;keep up with what<br/>dress she wore to whatever event the other night, and they just tried out the<br/>latest &quot;Beyonce diet&quot; this month and did you hear what Beyonce said about the<br/>person she was dating last year?&nbsp; Oh yeah, and they 30 seconds of a music video<br/>on a Hollywood TV show every once in a while too... ;-)</p><p>To see how deeply ingrained this distinction&nbsp;from &quot;pop&quot; has been&nbsp;within the<br/>psyche of &quot;popular music&quot;, check out a little of the history behind &quot;The<br/>Monkees&quot;.&nbsp; Those guys were so desperate to achieve recognition as&nbsp; legitimate<br/>&quot;rock artists&quot;.&nbsp; The &quot;pop&quot; tag haunted them like a spectre.&nbsp; (Whether you think<br/>they were &quot;pop&quot; or whether they actually managed to elevate themselves to the<br/>level of legitimate &quot;rock artist&quot; is a different discussion - but it was a very<br/>*real* and deep-rooted&nbsp;distinction which they agonized over... way too<br/>much&nbsp;perhaps... but it can provide a good &quot;case study&quot; for someone who doubts<br/>whether any&nbsp;such&nbsp;distinction was&nbsp; ingrained in the rock aesthetic.<br/>Mark Stephens<br/>ProgPositivity - The Best Prog and Fusion - Positively!<br/><a href="http://www.progpositivity.com">http://www.progpositivity.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=26850 href="#26850">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2011 10:23:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

and a much, much larger, panoramic designation&nbsp;called &quot;popular music&quot;. &quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True...pop is a specific, rather limited style...while popular music is anything that generally strikes a chord with the public regardless of the style.</p><p>&nbsp; When I think of groups considered classics in their &quot;fields&quot; IE The Beatles somewhat or (especially) groups like The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers , Metallica, or Bjork...what they did really did in many to most ways did not fit into the whole pop style at all...it just happened to be fairly popular.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In the extreme, for &quot;pop&quot;, think of Miley Cirus, The Jonas Brothers, Justin  Bieber, The Spice Girls, Britney Spears, etc.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly I think of pop (the style)...thinks like &quot;Barbie Girl&quot; by Aqua and &quot;Hit me baby one more time&quot; by Britney Spears come up...hence the problem with &quot;pop&quot; being equated with &quot;simple fad music&quot;.&nbsp;</p><p>  Here that &quot;POP = SIMPLE FAD MUSIC&quot;...that&apos;s the definition people like me and Mark&apos;s example of &quot;The Monkees&quot; were/are not trying to or wanting to become associated with.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The classical world tends to speak about &quot;pop&quot; music with a wide panoramic viewpoint that the general populace does not.&quot;</p><p>   Very good point...as I understand what you are saying, classical musicians say &quot;pop&quot; to mean &quot;popular music&quot;...while others say &quot;pop&quot; only to mean a specific genre.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Did you know that there are &quot;fans&quot; of the singer &quot;Beyonce&apos;&quot; who almost never listen to her music!!  How can this be?  Well, these &quot;fans&quot; keep up with what dress she wore...&quot;</p><p>  Hillarious and relevant: &quot;pop&quot; includes a huge social phenomenon that has nothing to do with music.  Lots of people like Beyonce just because they&apos;d like to see her, well....and now Kim Kardashian (sp.?) is singing for albums...hey, at least it looks better for her PR (not to mention her &quot;musical fans&quot;) than having her stripping for a living.  Justin Beiber also lost hundreds of thousands of Facebook friends when he decided to cut his hair to something different than his token hair cut...yet claimed &quot;they will stick around: after all, it&apos;s about the music&quot;...hehehe...not quite! :-D</p></div>
