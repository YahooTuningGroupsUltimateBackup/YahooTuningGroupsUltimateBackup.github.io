I like a man who&apos;s not afraid of ostinato. You didn&apos;t bore<br/>me for one minute--the lines were nice and sinuous. Beautiful<br/>seductive melody.</p><p>I&apos;m curious what your setup is...what do enter notes with, etc.<br/>My one complaint would perhaps be I miss the human expressive<br/>live-player element, and the piano part is particularly<br/>mono-chromatic, but your music is good enough to overcome this---<br/>i.e. I can imagine it being great to hear by live players. Hats off!&quot;</p><p>This piece was composed with, and performed by, Harmony Assistant. Notes<br/>are entered into a score either by mouse (my method), keypad or midi<br/>keyboard. And I agree -- I&apos;d rather hear this performed live!</p><p>&quot;BTW, I found as I was listening to this that I heard a certain tinge<br/>of Philip Glass (the *better* Glass, i.e.--I find him uneven),<br/>particularly in his movie scores...and believe it or not, a sort of<br/>vague Spanish flavor, which is a very good thing, IMO---I can picture<br/>Spanish gypsy fiddlers doing this one--I&apos;m also dying to hear what<br/>this would sound like with an almost flamenco-like festive percussion<br/>part.</p><p>I&apos;d be willing to give that a whirl if you&apos;d lend me the MIDI file (if<br/>you didn&apos;t want to do it yourself)</p><p>All best,<br/>Aaron.&quot;</p><p>Thanks for the kind comments! When I finished Rustic Dance and<br/>re-listened to the whole thing front-to-back, I thought: &quot;Gee, that<br/>kinda sounds like Gypsy music...&quot;  I was going to call it Gypsy Melody<br/>but thought better of it -- genuine Gypsies might take offense at having<br/>their music being so maligned!</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to send you the midi file to play with, but please be a bit<br/>patient -- I&apos;m in the midst of completing several projects concurrently.<br/>I&apos;ll get it to you directly.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>jls</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
