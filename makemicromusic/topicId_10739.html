These are the pitches<br/>and intervals in the system, their cents values and frequency ratios<br/>are this, and the music is based on these structures. This structure<br/>is generally considered happy, this one sad. Etcetera.</p><p>What you&apos;re doing there is describing a musical culture, a way of<br/>listening to, composing, and performing a kind of music that doesn&apos;t<br/>exist.

Sadly, the program would not &quot;do&quot;<br/>microtones, anything other than 12tET, but its creator took an<br/>approach to the definition of timing issues (including but not<br/>limited to &apos;metrical divisions&apos;) that facilitated all kinds of<br/>interesting experimentation. As I recall, one could define an atomic<br/>pulse as a given fraction of a second and then specify how many<br/>pulses one wanted to assign as the duration of a tone or of a<br/>silence between tones (on a given MIDI track).</p><p>I created some &quot;jazz&quot; and music that was unlike any known genre that<br/>exploited some very odd groupings of pulses. The jazzy music came<br/>off sounding like syncopation plus metrical sloppiness that somehow<br/>worked musically.</p><p>Another thing with which I experimented was ... not sure what the<br/>technical term for it is, although I feel there must be one ...<br/>juxtaposing two fundamentally different rhythmic cycles that<br/>periodically coincide. An example that humans can play and have<br/>played is a melody in 7 measures of 5 beats per measure combined<br/>with a melody in 5 measures of 7 beats per measure. This is<br/>interesting enough, but software opens up all sorts of possibilities<br/>because one is not constrained by the possible or actual limitations<br/>of human players.</p><p>So, for example, one might take a cycle of 13 beats and layer it<br/>with a cycle of 17 beats. The progressive offsetting of the melodies<br/>played in the two cycles would &quot;resynch&quot; or return to its initial<br/>state every 13x17=221 beats. While one might not be able to readily<br/>identify what method lies behind this madness, it undeniably<br/>produces an effect. Whether or not that effect is very musical or<br/>meaningful is for the decision of the composer and audience, I<br/>suppose, but as with people&apos;s ability to distinguish frequency<br/>ratios, there is undoubtedly a natural limit to humans&apos; ability to<br/>mentally track such temporal complexities. In any event, it&apos;s an<br/>interesting sort of thing to play with.</p><p>Regards,<br/>George</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you to everyone who gave their answers to my question.<br/>&gt; The consensus of the group appears to be that no music has a<br/>&gt; definite universal meaning.

Sadly, the program would not &quot;do&quot;<br/>&gt; microtones, anything other than 12tET, but its creator took an<br/>&gt; approach to the definition of timing issues (including but not<br/>&gt; limited to &apos;metrical divisions&apos;) that facilitated all kinds of<br/>&gt; interesting experimentation. As I recall, one could define an atomic<br/>&gt; pulse as a given fraction of a second and then specify how many<br/>&gt; pulses one wanted to assign as the duration of a tone or of a<br/>&gt; silence between tones (on a given MIDI track).</p><p>Nice!  Do you know whether this program still exists, or any other<br/>current program with similar timing abilities?</p><p>&gt; I created some &quot;jazz&quot; and music that was unlike any known genre that<br/>&gt; exploited some very odd groupings of pulses. The jazzy music came<br/>&gt; off sounding like syncopation plus metrical sloppiness that somehow<br/>&gt; worked musically.</p><p>Love to hear some of it, if you could post any.</p><p>&gt; Another thing with which I experimented was ... not sure what the<br/>&gt; technical term for it is, although I feel there must be one ...<br/>&gt; juxtaposing two fundamentally different rhythmic cycles that<br/>&gt; periodically coincide. ...</p><p>Try the nouns (&amp; adjectives): poly-rhythm (poly-rhythmic)<br/>or poly-metre (poly-metrical).  Polymetre refers specifically<br/>to crossing time signatures; whilst polyrhythm refers to any<br/>kinds of crossed rhythms at all: it can include such simple<br/>things as playing triplets in a duple metre, duplets (if that&apos;s<br/>the name?) in a triple metre, and more complex things such<br/>as your 35 beat super-metre grouped variously as fives and<br/>sevens.  I&apos;ve tried various experiments in both polymetre<br/>and polyrhythm over the years; some even sound interesting!<br/>The most ambitious effort is &quot;Tzolkin&quot; (1999) - a realisation<br/>of the Mayan calendar, with its interlocking cycles of 13, 20<br/>and 73.  Some background details -</p><p> &apos;The Mayan sacred year, the tzolkin, consisted of a cycle of<br/> 260 days, the product of a cycle of day-numbers from 1 to<br/> 13 with a cycle of 20 day-names.</p><p> Their solar year, the haab, contained 365 days, organised as<br/> 18 months each of 20 days, and a short 19th month of 5 days.</p><p> The two years combined in a grand cycle of 18,980 days, the<br/> lcm (least common multiple) of 260 and 365, = 5 x 52 x 73.<br/> The combination of day-number, day-name, day-of-month and<br/> month would recur after exactly 73 tzolkin, or 52 haab.</p><p> I&apos;ve given the 4 factors respectively to the tenor, counter-<br/> tenor,  baritone and bass in this quartet.&apos;</p><p>This is, in my view, only an experiment with little musical value.<br/>I&apos;ve only ever had it performed by machine ... But despite the<br/>strange numbers used, the regularity of the result is still quite<br/>striking.  It runs for over 65 minutes ... at which point,<br/>everything coincides again, but it becomes &apos;predictable&apos; long<br/>before that.</p><p>&gt; ... An example that humans can play and have<br/>&gt; played is a melody in 7 measures of 5 beats per measure combined<br/>&gt; with a melody in 5 measures of 7 beats per measure. This is<br/>&gt; interesting enough, but software opens up all sorts of possibilities<br/>&gt; because one is not constrained by the possible or actual limitations<br/>&gt; of human players.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, for example, one might take a cycle of 13 beats and layer it<br/>&gt; with a cycle of 17 beats. The progressive offsetting of the melodies<br/>&gt; played in the two cycles would &quot;resynch&quot; or return to its initial<br/>&gt; state every 13x17=221 beats. While one might not be able to readily<br/>&gt; identify what method lies behind this madness, it undeniably<br/>&gt; produces an effect. ...</p><p>I found both these statements true of &apos;Tzolkin&apos;.</p><p>&gt; ... Whether or not that effect is very musical or<br/>&gt; meaningful is for the decision of the composer and audience, I<br/>&gt; suppose, but as with people&apos;s ability to distinguish frequency<br/>&gt; ratios, there is undoubtedly a natural limit to humans&apos; ability to<br/>&gt; mentally track such temporal complexities. In any event, it&apos;s an<br/>&gt; interesting sort of thing to play with.</p><p>I suspect that limit may be much higher than you think.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.362 / Virus Database: 267.12.8/162 - Release Date: 5/11/05</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2005 5:52:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Tristan wrote:<br/>&gt; I played with that for a while, using very simple ratios (2/3/5/7 and<br/>&gt; subsets, mostly) but it never worked especially well.

I am familiar with the terms relative to African music<br/>&gt; and Partch&apos;s &apos;Castor and Pollux&apos; - examples which spring to mind<br/>&gt; from my listening experience and of course there are others. What I<br/>&gt; had in mind was along the lines of specifically overlaying cycles<br/>&gt; rather than metrical &quot;measures&quot; per the Western notion. SO yes, poly-<br/>&gt; rhythm being the more general term, I s&apos;pose that would apply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I suppose, but as with people&apos;s ability to distinguish frequency<br/>&gt; ratios, there is undoubtedly a natural limit to humans&apos; ability to<br/>&gt; mentally track such temporal complexities. In any event, it&apos;s an<br/>&gt; interesting sort of thing to play with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suspect that limit may be much higher than you think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, probably.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I did while toying with A Musical Generator was that, when<br/>&gt; I got results that I deemed worthy of proeservation, I wrote out a<br/>&gt; text description of the noteworthy elements of the piece and the<br/>&gt; methodology I used to construct it. This document was lost with the<br/>&gt; music itself, but I thought it might be useful to track my progress<br/>&gt; (or at least changes in my approach) over time, might be fun to go<br/>&gt; back to and pick up old ideas from for renewed exploration, and (not<br/>&gt; least) might be helpful to listeners who would otherwise be stuck<br/>&gt; with trying to figure out WHAT was going on.</p><p>That would have been useful!  Pity it&apos;s gone :-(</p><p>&gt; ... I should say that my<br/>&gt; descriptions were quite detailed and specific, to the point that if<br/>&gt; someone who knew how to operate the program picked them up and tried<br/>&gt; to produce results similar to mine, they would probably in many<br/>&gt; cases succeed.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.362 / Virus Database: 267.12.8/166 - Release Date: 10/11/05</p></div><h3>George Henry &#x3C;cruithnelaluna@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2005 11:01:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Yahya,</p><p>I shall answer selected quotes from your post below.

Was I still left with only &quot;curious noise?&quot; In<br/>many cases, I think that&apos;s true, but there were a few pieces that I<br/>liked enough to listen to them occasionally, and not just because<br/>they were my own handiwork.</p><p>One can tweak parameters in a variety of ways. The array editor is<br/>the most general and you can get very detailed with it; however, I<br/>felt that it should have offered at least 3-4 times the number of<br/>math functions and a much easier-to-use interface. I was also<br/>frustrated because the mapping of generated (or input) numbers to<br/>the selected scale was not completely controllable. I am a not<br/>completely clear on this now, but as I recall I came up with a<br/>(theoretical) solution that involved creating a &quot;mapping template&quot;<br/>and then matching the actual numbers as closely as possible to the<br/>template, interpolating where necessary. I&apos;m sorry that isn&apos;t<br/>entirely clear, but maybe if you play with the program a bit you<br/>will get an idea of what I am talking about. When I say the solution<br/>was theoretical, I mean it could not be implemented using AMG.</p><p>I found that by using the array editor and some other functions, one<br/>could do many of the functions offered by sequencers, although<br/>creativity was required and as you say there is no straightforward,<br/>obvious way to do such things - no analog to a sequencer interface.</p><p>I found the graphical views of the fractals to be interesting,<br/>curious and flashy but hardly useful in musical terms. What I did<br/>find very useful was the piano roll view, in that I could easily and<br/>directly map between the visual view of the music (er, curious noise<br/>or whatever) and what I was hearing.</p><p>If you develop enough interest in that little program and spend<br/>enough time with it, you will find that it&apos;s possible to create<br/>music covering the spectrum from &quot;a selection of algorithmically-<br/>generated &apos;found sounds&apos; that the user happens to like&quot; all the way<br/>to completely-composed music comparable to results obtained using a<br/>sequencer. (The latter is not what the program is primarily designed<br/>to do, and is more difficult to achieve.)</p><p>One of the pieces that I favored resulted from layering five<br/>algorithmically-generated piano tracks. The music gradually waxed<br/>and waned (with little punctuations of the opposite of whatever<br/>character was dominant at the time) between very sparse and very<br/>dense. It reminded me of human activity in and around a city in a 24-<br/>hour period, and I think I named the piece accordingly. Too bad that<br/>a description can&apos;t compare to an actual example.</p><p>If I can find the time, perhaps I will download the program again<br/>and see if I can come up with a &quot;composition,&quot; but please,<br/>everyone, &quot;don&apos;t hold your breath&quot; in anticipation. It&apos;s most likely<br/>that this will not happen.</p><p>Regards,<br/>George</p></div>
