First, it&apos;s a total non issue to me...people should write/play whatever they want. The real issue to me, as always, is the music. It&apos;s pretty simple...eq temps were developed to play chordally based music; so, generally, if one wants to play classical, jazz, American folk, blues, country, reggae, flamenco, rock, R&amp;B, etc, you&apos;re going to be dealing with a temperament. Of course, these styles developed using 12 tone tuning, but I&apos;ve composed tunes in these styles using other temperaments, and will continue to do so (and so have numerous others). When I hear folks say they would never use any sort of temperaments, it seems to me they are also saying they are not going to be playing in styles that DO use temperaments...not a problem, but to me, that&apos;s the issue, the music, not the tunings.</p><p>   And, art is all about creativity and self expression...if you figure out a way to play truck drivin&apos; music using JI, I&apos;d love to hear it, and would probably think it&apos;s a hoot. Haven&apos;t heard it yet...And, I like pure tunings for modally based music that doesn&apos;t change keys. On my new CD, there are two fretless pieces tuned to the Harmonic Series, and both pieces do not modulate...so, pure tunings are perfect for that sort of music. Wouldn&apos;t want to try Charlie Parker style stuff in JI, but it sure works great in 19 (and other temps as well).</p><p>   And, I do get tired of the frequent sniping and bickering that goes on here...there&apos;s absolutely no need for it, and it occasionally makes me a bit wary of posting, cause I&apos;m wondering who&apos;s gonna try to take a potshot if they&apos;re in a funky mood. I think there&apos;s an etiquette that people need for participating in group interactions...sure, everybody has a bad day, especially as we get a bit older...but, needling people for no good reason, which is what happens here a lot, is uncalled for and unnecessary, and only serves to create bad feeling between people. Hate to say it, but I&apos;ve rarely recommended the lists to my numerous friends/students who are interested in tunings...I would be a bit embarrassed for them to get caught up in the nonsense. That being said, the tuning lists have somehow managed to last with the same cast of characters for some time, we seem to be able to put up with each other for the most part, and I&apos;m glad, cause there are some interesting ideas that appear here.

So, in that traditional &apos;classical&apos; sense, I use EDOs. When<br/>I&apos;m looking to do something more-drone like, neo-ethnic, spacious, or<br/>perhaps abstract then JI fits the bill. Also, for &apos;abstract&apos;,<br/>non-harmonic EDOs work well too (as all the work in 11- and 13- around<br/>here of late indicates)</p><p>I also think it&apos;s extremely valid and useful to bridge both worlds, and<br/>write for really high EDOs that approximate JI ever-closer (72, 99, 171,<br/>441, etc.) with the convenience of a finite set and modulation. This is Gene&apos;s approach, and I don&apos;t see why there are those who would attack<br/>him for it, or why choose not to do this should be attacked. Yes, it&apos;s<br/>generally more applicable in MIDI or electronic music.</p><p>Then there&apos;s saying &apos;forget octaves&apos;, which I&apos;ve not been particularly<br/>interested in myself, b/c I really strongly relate to the pitch class<br/>idea as an &apos;identity&apos;, but why not?</p><p>In summary---YEAH JI!!!!

Haven&apos;t you played with<br/>Jon Catler?  Isn&apos;t he like, the most prominent exception in the world<br/>to this above generalization?  He rocks the bejillickers out of his JI<br/>guitars, and plays some mean jazz to boot.  And don&apos;t forget Dante<br/>Rosati, who plays amazing JI classical guitar music.  Oh, and Pete<br/>McRae has some fine bluesy JI stuff as well, based I think on some<br/>sort of eikosany or something.  And let&apos;s not forget Harry Partch&apos;s<br/>unique JI guitar music as well (no idea what you&apos;d call his style<br/>though).  Come to think of it, most of the microtonal guitar music I&apos;m<br/>familiar with is JI, with yourself (and, humbly, myself as well) being<br/>the few exceptions.  Which, given the difficulty at fretting up a JI<br/>guitar, frankly boggles my mind.</p><p>I&apos;m probably one of the more vocal people here about my disdain for JI<br/>theory. But I must stress that it is only the theory behind JI that<br/>bores me; I&apos;ve heard so much amazing JI music that I could not for a<br/>second dismiss the concept.  Come to think of it, of all the<br/>microtonal music that I really like and find myself returning to time<br/>and time again, most of it is JI stuff.  But on the other hand,<br/>theories connected with EDOs (MOS scales serving as alternatives to<br/>diatonic tonalities and such) fascinate me, even if I find a lot of<br/>the music written in alternate EDOs to be less than exciting.<br/>However, the gap is definitely narrowing.</p></div><h3><a id=17308 href="#17308">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2007 6:26:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmmmm... equal temperaments and equal divisions of the octave<br/>certainly make transposition not only easier, but literal<br/>transposition in all keys possible. Because I don&apos;t consider a literal<br/>transposition a true modulation, I&apos;d say that equal divisions make<br/>modulation more difficult, or at least weaken its effects. Inequality<br/>of interval sizes is a necessity of modulation at its strongest, which<br/>can even transcend the idea of scale steps: for example, it is<br/>possible to audibly modulate from C major to C major if, for example,<br/>one CMj is based on the tetrachord 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, and the other<br/>CMj on 1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 4/3.</p><p>Now someone will point out that the example above could be done in x-<br/>EDO, where x is some huge number, to which I say that the giant EDOs<br/>which contain a mass of intervals indistinguishable from &quot;JI&quot;<br/>intervals, when driven full throttle, are something that is both and<br/>neither JI/ET. And like everything else that of a both/neither nature,<br/>they actually should be understood as a new thing. Which is a good<br/>thing, seems to me.</p><p>The way I work with extended rational intonation would not only<br/>require astronomical EDOs, but the easy and hopefully elegant logic<br/>of the approach as far as notating/programming and visualizing would<br/>be completely obscured, so the &quot;debate&quot; thankfully doesn&apos;t concern me.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
