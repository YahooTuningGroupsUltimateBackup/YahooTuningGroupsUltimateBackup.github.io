I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; somewhat &quot;in the middle&quot; on that issue, sometimes &quot;enjoying&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; minimalism, depending on the timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then there is the other extreme. Too much change to the point of<br/>&gt; alienation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tried them both. Music that repeats, and music that never<br/>&gt; repeats. Music that has polyrhythmic dense layers where meters change<br/>&gt; constantly, and on the other extreme, single voice music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can enjoy either of them if done well, and amuse myself privately<br/>&gt; with allot of stuff I&apos;ll likely never share in these forums.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems possible that Paul has some kind of ideal inner image of<br/>&gt; music which only he will be able to make manifest in the real world.<br/>&gt; He mentioned his &quot;inner music&quot; once, and made me eager to hear it.<br/>&gt; Hopefully I will one day. It&apos;s much easier to assume the judgement<br/>&gt; seat, than it&apos;ll ever be to dive into the challenges and treasures<br/>&gt; that microtonality presents to us. History remembers the Music and<br/>&gt; rarely the Critic (read Slonimsky&apos;s &quot;Lexicon of Musical Invective&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All I can affirm is I&apos;ve personally never read a single post, paper<br/>&gt; or article that moves my soul like a good piece of microtonal music<br/>&gt; does, and probably never will. That&apos;s just me though - hard to work<br/>&gt; up the goose-pimples over text for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tuning is about Music, Music is about Emotions, and Emotions are<br/>&gt; about People. Hopefully we can harness the efforts of many in this<br/>&gt; Emotional Journey.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]-------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More music files from MMM are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music/">http://www.microtonal.org/music/</a><br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
