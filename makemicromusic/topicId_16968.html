Even 9-ET with its comma-sized error in the fifths can be marginally acceptable, although that&apos;s really stretching it.</p></div><h3><a id=16989 href="#16989">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2007 2:32:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=376205">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=376205</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just uploaded 5 new songs to my microtonal music page at the above<br/>&gt; address.

What do you think?</p><p>Ha!! Very interesting. I got to listen more closely then. Hmm, from<br/>first hearing, I didn&apos;t even notice much - apart from the rhythm being<br/>slightly irregular, it sounded quite natural. I guess it would be much<br/>too optimistic to take this as a sign that the rhythm suits the tuning<br/>very well.. It would be interesting to compare pieces in the same<br/>tuning, but with different rhythms.</p><p>In the 15 piece, I keep hearing 8 and 7, not 15. It seems that<br/>divisions in this range are getting difficult to perceive as unity - I<br/>made a similar experience when I wrote my piece in 17. The relevance<br/>of the hypothesis, if there is any, obviously comes to its limit here.</p><p>In any case, I like the rhythm of the 15-piece - and I definitely like<br/>the guitar solo in the 11 piece. Want more of that guitar! And quite<br/>interesting, as to Magnus, the 11EDO tuning does not sound that bad to<br/>me, too.<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=16992 href="#16992">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2007 9:54:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I *love* it.
