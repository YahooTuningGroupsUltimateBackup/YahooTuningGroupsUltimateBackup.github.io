High praise I doubt I can live up to, but thanks!</p><p>&gt; Clear evidence of the musical power of the tools we have right now. Damn<br/>&gt; you for making nice music on a harpsichord! :) :)</p><p>Ironically, I was arguing about the emotional power of the piano over the<br/>harpsichord a while back in this group. Obviously, I like &apos;sichord enough to<br/>write for it, it&apos;s just that I think I can listen to more hours of piano<br/>music in one sitting than harpsichord. That may change, who knows.</p><p>I will say some tunings really are great for the harpsichord (the meantone<br/>variety in particular), and 7-limit JI (even 11-limit) sound fine to me on<br/>it. Other tunings (7-equal, etc.) sound downright disgusting on harpsichord<br/>to me (unless it&apos;s maybe a lute or muted stop), whereas they work beautifully<br/>on the piano, due to the inharmonicity of the latter.</p><p>Thanks for listening, Jon!</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p></div>
