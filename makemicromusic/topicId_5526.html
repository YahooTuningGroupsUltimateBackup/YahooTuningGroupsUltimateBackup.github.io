I understand the frustration of knowing<br/>that FTS can probably do what you want if you knew how!</p><p>It can already find pitches in a recording and you can try this out:<br/>View | Analyes recording or Midi Voice | Open Audio File<br/>Then Find Seed (that is because I did it originally for fractal tune<br/>generation) then Find Notes.</p><p>Click on Show Recording, or Recording (temp...)<br/>to see if it has found all the notes, or found more or less than it should.<br/>You can use the Find &amp; -&gt; Seed option to get it to play back the frequencies it<br/>found.</p><p>If you are lucky it may just find them straight away, and you will see<br/>a list of the frequencies it found.</p><p>If you go to Options for -&gt;Seed and you will see a small list of preset frequency<br/>detection settings at the bottom and you can try them all and perhaps try<br/>tweaking some of them - be sure to ask if you want help there.</p><p>If the results there look workable then you will see if it is worth persisting<br/>with it in its present form.</p><p>Yes, I know what you mean about the intuitive approach to scale making.<br/>I play tunes and improvise microtonal scales on my recorder and have no idea what they<br/>are either. Just that they sound good. Some time I&apos;ll have a go at analysing<br/>them too. I don&apos;t listen very analytically myself either when improvising,<br/>much more an emotional intuitive response to the music. I&apos;d need to use<br/>FTS myself to find out what the frequencies are that I play. But<br/>some here are much more analyticial in their listening and can readily<br/>identify intervals that they hear and play.</p><p>Do upload some of your recordings - I&apos;m interested to hear them.</p><p>Yes, FTS can retune any note to any other note. The things that affect that<br/>are:</p><p>The pitch window just shifts it up and down.<br/>The Arpeggio drop list selects notes from a scale. So if you want particular<br/>twelve tone notes to be played from say the white keys, choose a twelve<br/>tone scale to play in, then just put the numbers of the notes to play<br/>as scale degrees (for twelve tone scales, numbers of semitones above the 1/1)<br/>in the arpeggio window (repeating if necessary to get up to 7 of them).<br/>The black keys then play any in between notes in the scale that are in the<br/>appropriate positions.</p><p>Or if you want to specify a complete mapping of all the twelve keys, then<br/>set it to play from &quot;All keys&quot; and then in the arpeggio window you need<br/>to give it twelve numbers for the notes to play.</p><p>Always end with 12 for the octave in order to get an octave repeating arpeggio.<br/>But the scale degrees there can be in any order, they don&apos;t need to be in<br/>ascending order.</p><p>If you want to do a map for two or more octaves, use the same procedure<br/>but end at 24 or 36.</p><p>You can also explore using other keyboard mappings from In | Options | Keyboard config<br/>but this will take care of most situations I think. Be sure to ask with<br/>questions! (either here or directly).</p><p>I&apos;m planning to start up an FTS forum soonish in order to let FTS users<br/>talk with each other about ways of using FTS - and of course I&apos;d<br/>join in to answer tough questions.</p><p>I&apos;ll also be doing more work on the help for FTS. Soon also I plan<br/>to add a better search facility to it which may help (it has<br/>one on the Overview page which searches an on-line copy of the help).</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
