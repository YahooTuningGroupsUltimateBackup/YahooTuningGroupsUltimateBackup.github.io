Unfortunately I feel I have to warn them &quot;be prepared to have even the most humble claims of intelligence or effort to learn micro-tonallity critically judged, along with your &apos;slacker intentions&apos;, before you find/learn much good information&quot;.  And many musicians I know simply refuse to tell their friends about the list at all much b/c of this.<br/>    Many people seem to almost demand this list and the tuning list be a &quot;no-fun zone&quot; that feels like an insanely hard college course with a self-absorbed professor who is using/abusing his tenure to complicate things &amp; shout rather than to accommodate and help people enjoy learning.</p><p>    There are some interesting pieces of music and notes on why people love composing with what new tunings (AKA actually talking about their art with optimism) on here now and then...but they become tricky to find within the flood of ego battling.  Would it be too much to ask some sort of a warning system for those who insist on insulting others and saying how nearly everyone&apos;s ideas are wrong yet poses few alternatives or optimism toward the art of micro-tonallity?   Because, as of now, this almost sounds like a &quot;why microtonallity is dead&quot; board where people make sure other people&apos;s theories get knocked to pieces until everyone (along with their ideas) looks like an idiot and people who come here at first glance would think we were all arguing over dead/wrong theories (and perhaps, that the only &quot;right&quot; theory left after everything gets thrown out IS 12TET (LOL)).</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2010 2:21:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I disagree to a point.</p><p>People here on this list are generally helpful.</p><p>I&apos;ve turned off the list for the fighting on occasion and some of the<br/>comments concerning 12 EDO music in relation to the contest I ran were very<br/>arrogant.</p><p>But on the whole this list and the tuning list has been helpful and that<br/>help has come from every single regular poster on here and tuning.</p><p>I do not think microtonalists by nature are timid people.
