I guess one might &gt; call this &quot;directions for ensemble improvisation&quot;?<br/>&gt;   very much so! and it would be for such an ensemble or group of people who like to perform such things.<br/>although the idea is that my ensemble in this tuning would be the core if not exclusive performing medium, but see no reason to restrict it as such<br/>&gt; How does such a thing work?  Clearly, you&apos;d want to be specific &gt; enough to have some control over the possible outcomes (otherwise &gt; it&apos;s going to be random and chaotic, little different from &quot;found &gt; sound&quot;).  I think quite a lot is already determined. the scale and the basic duration of the notes.<br/>this will give the piece a very distinctive quality<br/>such thing can be abused but if we allow some people to say walk down on the sidewalkthey will get into fights or hit or shoot others, this doesn&apos;t mean the solution is to  restrict the walking on sidewalks.<br/>&gt; OTOH, to give scope to the performers&apos; sensibilities, &gt; you&apos;d need to avoid over-determining the flow of the work.  So the &gt; instructions you write would need to strike a balance between these &gt; two poles.  Still, if the piece is actively &quot;conducted&quot;, one would &gt; expect entirely different realisations from the same ensemble and &gt; conductor depending on their states of mind on the day.<br/>&gt;   oh i sure hope so, if i want something complete defined, this is not the best way to do so.<br/> The piece grew out of playing such things and is in part a informed by a resent performance that happen here with about 20 people.<br/>My approach in performing such is say quite different than someone who has little experience with it and often people become what i see as overly passive in performing such things. i wanted to turn up the heat so to speak , but not by giving them more concrete instructions but by changing the way they are thinking about it for say when told to follow what they might interpret as impersonal instructions.<br/>playing it like an office worker performs the task of filing papers cause he is told to.<br/>&gt; I guess the most fascinating thing about these directions is that &gt; they don&apos;t *necessarily* incorporate any kind of narrative.  The narrative I assume is what unfolds in the moment of the performance.</p><p>&gt; This &gt; seems uncommonly abstract coming from you! ;-)  probably true as there is no micro element that defines it from the outright like most of my stuff.<br/>though i can not think of a single piece where some element of spontaneous decision making does not take place.<br/>i just can&apos;t tell people what to do and nothing else but.<br/>It isn&apos;t my style , at least as a composer</p><p>my goal is always to tll the performer as little as possible supplementing wit hverbal instructions or insights  only if needed<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love to hear a &gt; performance you did.<br/>&gt;    haven&apos;t done one yet but might include this as part of other works in a couple of months<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; The piece is named after a composer Adam Overton who uses bodily &gt;&gt;     &gt; rhythms as a determining factor in his performances.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; I seem to keep tinkering with it bit , but this is so close to its &gt;&gt;     &gt; final form it seemed okto post<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; GENDHING OVERTON-META SLENDRO TUNING)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For as many players in as large of area possible within sounding &gt;&gt; distance. Players are free to move to explore interaction. Outside &gt;&gt; somewhat reverberant spaces preferred.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This notes in this tuning* fall into groups of 2 and three note  &gt;&gt;     &gt; concentration of pitches that cause beating. Pitch is to be as &gt; precise as possible. Each of these groups will now be considered a &gt; living tone.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; When asked to perform a tone, ...<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Do you conduct this?<br/>&gt;    no the players play when they feel they should or desire to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; ... one or all of the elements (notes) can be emphasized or not, &gt;&gt;     &gt; simultaneously or in succession, and the player is free to move from &gt; one state to another. There are two factors informing that act upon &gt; what one plays<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; 1) To hold onto a state until one has absorbed it<br/>&gt;&gt; 2) That nothing, much less the living ... &gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Do you mean &quot;living tone&quot;, perhaps?<br/>&gt;    yes this applies to the idea of tone, i will try to make that clearer<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; ... is still in the universe. ...<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; Does this mean there will be long silences?<br/>&gt;    no , i the instructsion for  rests are in the duration  between two and 5 breaths.<br/>it refers to that a a held tone should not to be deathy still for instance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; ... The interaction with others will commonly produce movement in &gt;&gt;     &gt; ones tone, making individual movement unnecessary<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How does this tie in with the &quot;bodily movement&quot; idea?<br/>&gt;     for instance an actor on stage can be expressive and change their expression by just being in a different relative position to other actors without changing their own position. take someone in achair facing a door that a person is at. everthing is fine, but if the person at the door moves somewhere else say, even in back of them and this person does not turn around  and face them, you know something is up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Each player chooses one tone at a time according to what they feel &gt;&gt;     &gt; most intuitive drawn, or hear. The latter possibly increasing as the &gt; piece progresses. One should not choose tones &quot;randomly&quot; in a &gt; mechanical robotic fashion but retain one&apos;s natural imagination.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Duration also is informed by a number of factors that pull in &gt;&gt;     &gt; different directions.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; 1) The duration of a tone is between 3-7 breaths. Resting between &gt;&gt;     &gt; 2-5 breaths. Once experienced one should dispel with counting, &gt; thinking of the duration and rest of a tone as a single breath which &gt; one repeats<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, here&apos;s a fundamental bodily rhythm!  The result at this pace &gt; should be quite entrancing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; 2) One should not feel compelled to impose in an ongoing &gt;&gt;     &gt; interaction nor feel required to stop one. The ear is to have a &gt; priority over these instructions being informed by uniqueness that &gt; presents itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah!  The ensemble performer as musician, rather than as a cog in a &gt; machine.<br/>&gt;    that is it and something i wanted to address in this piece<br/>&gt;  &gt;   &gt;&gt; The duration of the overall piece is likewise informed by a number &gt;&gt;     &gt; of factors<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; 1) This can vary from what feels like a few hundred breaths as in &gt;&gt;     &gt; 223 or 418, to maybe 1,556.<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; 2) One should not feel compelled to stop or continue beyond what &gt;&gt;     &gt; the unique factors of the performance dictate. While often this will &gt; be dictated by clock restrictions from the outside, this should be  &gt; considered unfortunate but sometime inevitable<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed, this process hould prove very absorbing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; *The original set of pitches being the 12-tone version of Wilson&apos;s &gt;&gt;     &gt; Meta Slendro as generated by Mt Meru.
