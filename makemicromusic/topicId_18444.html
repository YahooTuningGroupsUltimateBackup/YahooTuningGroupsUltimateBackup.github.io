This alteration can be done more freely. One can  also use 4 of more intervals (based on limits  the most common way) and these can be brought in at will.  I have spent hours playing with this, working a scale down and then as an example deciding it might be nice to add 7s now, or seeing what a reseeding will give me. All in all, I find it an extremely &quot;artistic&quot; tool where ones taste can (and is) used at each and every step. The disadvantage of Brun is that it is not clear how which side  to insert the new intervals . Here a knowledge of MOS gives one good background in knowing how to best possibly do this.</p><p>Brun is just one of the gems we find in Mandlebaum&apos;s book</p><p>John Chalmers wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Erv&apos;s technique is mathematically equivalent to Viggo Brun&apos;s subtractive<br/>&gt; version of the Euclidean Algorithm and to a simple continued fraction.<br/>&gt; The number of times one zigs or zags corresponds to the terms of the<br/>&gt; continued fraction approximation of the number and to the number of<br/>&gt; times a given subtractor is used in the Brun algorithm.
