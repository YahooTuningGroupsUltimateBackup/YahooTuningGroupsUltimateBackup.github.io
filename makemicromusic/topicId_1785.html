It is a touchy subject, but one can see that<br/>this is fueled by the popular media. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve been on a<br/>boycott of it since age 18.<br/>This affirmed to me how so many folks are hopelessly brainwashed and<br/>desensitized by the popular media.<br/>Something to reflect about.</p><p>14/&apos;92 for online access (spent all summer working to buy a used 14.4 modem; it<br/>was like having DSL now) -- my descent/dissent began...<br/>16/&apos;94 point of no return truly began here... err, now I&apos;m just playing catch<br/>up.. ;)</p><p>Here is an interesting sign of the times among my peers. I hope this list<br/>finds it as amusing as I did (hope it is not too off topic):<br/>When the movie Fight Club premiered I enjoyed it, but was not shocked by the<br/>content (not because I am desensitized; I haven&apos;t owned a TV or plugged into<br/>that reality for over 3 years now). Many of my peers (almost all) and those<br/>younger than myself were moved by this movie. I discussed this with many people<br/>in the San Luis Obispo area (central coast of CA) and for most it was the first<br/>time they were confronted with a message about living outside<br/>commercial/consumer society. I thought this was a fluke; it must be San Luis<br/>Obispo, a non-metropolitan area that relies on popular media to &quot;get in touch&quot;<br/>with the rest of the world. Well, when I attended the microfest I stayed with a<br/>group of senior students on the Harvey Mudd campus; seemingly bright people.<br/>The discussion of this movie was raised and again the same reaction as the kids<br/>in SLO; shock and amazement about possibly living outside consumer<br/>culture. This amazed me; that and the lifestyle at Harvey Mudd resembled<br/>Disneyland compared to my university experience (I guess an extra $120k buys<br/>you that). Well, off I go to Europe where I stayed in hostels (Paris and<br/>London) and held conversations with people from all over the world. I received<br/>the same reaction by almost everyone my age or younger: shock at the<br/>possibility of living outside consumer society. I actually was presented with a<br/>perfect situation for my anthropological pondering in London (last stop on my<br/>trip) where Fight Club was shown in the hostel and there was a diverse group<br/>of kids watching it that never saw it before. After the movie I initiated a<br/>discussion and guess what? Same reaction by those who had not seen the movie.<br/>Funny thing is that there was a fellow there in the TV lounge who was studying<br/>for a masters in anthropology from UCLA. We went out for beers and had a great<br/>discussion. ;)</p><p>Now, I have lived outside a metropolitan area for about 6 years now and my time<br/>in Europe was the longest I have been back to metropolitan areas. Besides<br/>having a great time I noticed that all of those in my peer group despite<br/>race/background/nationality were very similar; similar actions, similar<br/>thoughts, similar hopes for the future. It was rather uncanny.</p><p>Try not to be so hard on the younger more pop/consumer culture inclined;<br/>consider it something like the movie Matrix and build a bigger door; and<br/>perhaps a bridge over the powers that be that enforce the hegemony. Liked this<br/>article... <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/statement.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/statement.html</a>  Go Kyle! His<br/>recent Village Voice/Billy Joel article was great too...</p><p>&quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@...&gt;<br/>At 01:58 AM 1/16/2002 +0000, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Someone was mentioning the rather &quot;dry&quot; sound of my electronic<br/>&gt;efforts... and, to a degree, some of this is intentional.<br/>&gt;Even with _Sound Forge_ the reverb, even when light,<br/>&gt;sounds &quot;hokey...&quot; like something extraneous to the piece.<br/>&gt;to &quot;reverb&quot; sounds, but it all seems like something I would just as<br/>&gt;soon leave out, when I go for &quot;precision listening...&quot;</p><p>Here are a couple ways I think about reverb. The traditional/obvious: placing<br/>sound within a simulated environment. The second is to color/shape the sound<br/>object. You can do this by setting minimal early reflections and a short reverb<br/>time (under 250ms). These settings in combination with predelay and the mix<br/>level of the reverb can change the sound without  placing it deep in a<br/>simulated environment with a &quot;perceptible&quot; reverb tail. I am sure you can<br/>achieve these results with many reverb units or plugins, but I didn&apos;t realize<br/>this until I came across the Waves plugins. The Waves plugins give you a great<br/>graphical aid to visualize what you are hearing. You are given a nice red line<br/>that indicates the position of the predelay and the mix level controls<br/>amplitude of this line. By placing it at the apex of the time response graph<br/>you can create some interesting results. You can also apply multiple reverbs as<br/>Jacky mentioned. Instead of different reverbs on different instruments here is<br/>what I like to do: put one coloring/shaping the sound object followed by one<br/>that places it in an environment. My favorite combination now is to color/shape<br/>the sound object, place it with a binaural plugin (check <a href="http://www.spinaudio.com">www.spinaudio.com</a>;<br/>they have easy to use _cost effective_ solutions and several bundles just right<br/>for the price; If any thing I highly recommend the 3D Motion Panner plugin for<br/>$80), then place it within a simulated environment with a traditional use of<br/>reverb.</p><p>I would like to hear if there are other ways people are using reverb.<br/>As an example of this check out that dance track, ::shudder::. The hihat in<br/>particular along with the synths are using option 2. Option 2 is real effective<br/>as it you have other things in the mix that have a larger reverb signature then<br/>mask out the coloring/shaping you did on other parts. In the case of the dance<br/>track the component that does this is the &quot;analog tweaky&quot; sound, otherwise<br/>known by some as that &quot;Aphex Twiney&quot; sound. ;)</p><p>&gt;Use EQ with caution too. This can wreck your final mix. Many times<br/>&gt;what works best is to normalize your tracks to about -.3 dBs then add<br/>&gt;some subtle limiting (like compression, but different), to maximize<br/>&gt;the overall level of the music. Limit with caution, try to have about<br/>&gt;a -.3 to -6peak to average (for example), so as to not flatten out<br/>&gt;your dynamics.</p><p>EQ is a really wonderful tool, especially if you have the big toys (analog EQ!<br/>I have yet to try a high end digital EQ). I was able to use the Manley Massive<br/>Passive EQ on that dance track and I must say I was floored at the expressive<br/>and _subtle_ way it could alter/color the sound. I processed everything<br/>through the Manley. I just wished there was a version of the Manley that had<br/>midi control so you could use it dynamically. It made that hihat just cut<br/>through like a surgical knife compared to what I had before the pass. The<br/>Manley is in the $4k range.. : .(  &lt;- that is a tear above my frown and not a<br/>mole...</p><p>I would recommend against normalization if you can avoid using it. It is better<br/>to record (if you are multitracking) each audio source at full resolution then<br/>adjust the levels down in the mix so that you don&apos;t clip your environment as<br/>adding multiple tracks together in a mixer will become larger in total<br/>resolution.</p><p>I truly want to hear more and better recordings from this area of music. Here<br/>is my current trick to mastering with the toolset that I own, and I do not<br/>believe it is documented with Nuendo or other native mixing environments.  I<br/>learned this by trial and error and empirical investigation. My only warning is<br/>that this is a destructive and irreversible process, so once you do this don&apos;t<br/>get it mastered again. With this process as long as you keep a saved copy of<br/>your session you can do what you please later with a remaster, etc.</p><p>For the record normalization is destructive as well,<br/>but not in a &quot;musical&quot; direction.</p><p>Nuendo and I assume Sonar and other native environments have an internal<br/>resolution of 32 bit float (large amount of headroom above 24/bit resolution of<br/>most A/D converters.) Besides, all the cheap A/D, IE under $1k currently don&apos;t<br/>have the resolution that a pro unit does. My Aardvark Q10 and others in its<br/>category, IE the Maudio Delta series, etc. have a dynamic range of about 100db,<br/>full CD resolution is 96db, you do the math are you really getting that extra 8<br/>bits worth, I think not! I am really anticipating the Mytek stereo A/D unit<br/>(A/D only) that is going to be available Q2 this year at $1k; its dynamic range<br/>is 120db; top converters from say dbTechnologies get 127db, they also cost $6k;<br/>but these units are what the pro mixers/mastering engineers are using to get<br/>results; the Cranesong Hedd-192 is also highly recommended; $3k) clipping<br/>occurs at the output gain stage; which in Nuendo is located in the master<br/>effects section. There are 6 slots for plugins before the master gain and 2<br/>afterwards. This means that you _can_ &quot;virtually clip&quot; every channel in the VST<br/>mixer. This also means that it is possible to record all your audio tracks at<br/>full resolution and either combine them at that level or mix up (virtually clip<br/>the channel) or down slightly to create the sound stage that you are trying to<br/>achieve. Volume in a mix is effective as a way of placing something closer or<br/>further away (see mixing article below).</p><p>So, you are now going above the 24 bit level of the mix by virtually clipping<br/>channels on the mixer; you _are_ going to clip the output at the master gain<br/>stage unless you do something to get the level below 0db. On the master bus<br/>before the master gain place a limiter. The Waves L1 is recommended as it is<br/>the best software one I have come across. Here are recommended settings I use<br/>in this situation all the time. Keep the threshold at 0db, output level at<br/>-.06; never more than -.03 but this depends on your material. and the release<br/>at .03 to .06. Here is an explanation for all of this. When you virtually clip<br/>you are mixing above 0db. The L1 is effective for 0 to 3.5db of gain reduction<br/>(more than 3.5db and you risk squashed audio, distortion, etc.) to 6db. sitting<br/>at 3.5 is appropriate (for electronic material this is fine; this might not fair<br/>so well for everything). This means that you can virtually clip your mix<br/>&quot;safely&quot; up to +3.5db. The limiter will catch _most_ of the overs and reduce<br/>the gain to .06, but keep the apparent loudness. The reason for having the output<br/>level at .06 is that the limiter will not catch all of the peaks and some will<br/>come through and you don&apos;t want those going over 0db; my Aardvark Q10 has a<br/>nice interface that shows when I am clipping. The release is important too as<br/>you want a fast release in this situation otherwise you will color the sound<br/>(more like a compressor; a limiter is an extreme compressor after all). A<br/>larger release than .06 will start coloring the sound. Jacky mentioned some<br/>stats to look at after limiting to see if you pushed it too far. The<br/>one I check is average RMS (which in Nuendo is found in Audio-&gt;Statistics: I<br/>try to sit a mix at around -14db average RMS. If you hit -10db average RMS you<br/>are really squashing the material; anything above that is probably distorting<br/>badly or you are running some new top secret prototype of the Waves L3; heaven<br/>help us all!)</p><p>Here is the cool thing about native apps like Nuendo even over Pro Tools<br/>(currently; though they should be releasing some big stuff soon; I gather). You<br/>are unable to virtually clip the Pro Tools mixer; your mix between all its<br/>components must not exceed the 24bit resolution of the mixer itself. Also, even<br/>though there is the software L2 for Pro Tools which can get up to 7db of<br/>reduction &quot;safely&quot; since the resolution in Nuendo is 32bit float over 24 bit in<br/>Pro Tools you get that added benefit and processing is better natively. Digi<br/>might have a thing or two to prove with its next roll out and I am curious to<br/>see what they do... 48 bit fixed? 64? That will probably require a change in<br/>the hardware/software and necessitate that all the software is rewritten (who<br/>knows about backward compatibility...)</p><p>Another trick with what I have described is to have some sort of monitor before<br/>the L1 on the master bus. Although you will see the gain reduction meter on the<br/>L1 it does not hold maximum levels and is not exact. Try the super stereo<br/>plugin that is available free (shareware) from the fellow below. It will give<br/>you an accurate meter over 0db and also show other useful information such as<br/>phase and give you a visual picture of the sound stage. For a learning<br/>experience put another instance of super stereo after the limiter and watch<br/>what it does to the visual image with and without the limiter engaged and<br/>different output levels on the limiter.</p><p>For Cplugs.<br/><a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/NickWhitehurst/">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/NickWhitehurst/</a></p><p>Here is a great little post from an anonymous, but famous pop mixer in regard<br/>to sound stage.<br/><a href="http://www.prosoundweb.com/recpit/viewtopic.php?t=497">http://www.prosoundweb.com/recpit/viewtopic.php?t=497</a><br/>Fun little forum too where anything goes....</p><p>Jacky said:<br/>&gt;Liked your tune, even though I&apos;m not that much of a fan of the &quot;4-On-<br/>&gt;The-Floor&quot; drumming style. Great sounds and recording!</p><p>Thanks.. I learned an enormous amount on recording with this outing; that is<br/>what I am happy about. In regard to not liking &quot;4 on the floor&quot; style; well it<br/>makes a lot of sense for DJing. It may not sound exciting in a passive<br/>listening environment, but in an active environment it comes to life (and I am<br/>not talking about just making a smooth mix). The form of the parts is simple<br/>and passive, but this leads to a very active and dynamic functional use<br/>mediated by the right hands. It is possible to &quot;go under&quot; and engage oneself in<br/>a stream of consciousness state while DJing especially on a large sound system<br/>and with a crowd who is into it on a separate level. I guess I could explain<br/>this more as I think people often overlook the possibilities with DJing (then<br/>again there are not that many virtuoso DJs out there; and a lot of the culture<br/>is not mature and is starting to really be affected by the mainstream pop<br/>culture syndrome).</p><p>&gt;There are people who have spent as much time becoming recording engineers as<br/>you have spent becoming a composer.<br/>I am still in my labor-of-love phase, but I would be glad to work with any of<br/>you on your projects as it gives me a challenge and I will learn a lot by<br/>working to your unique spec. Recently I had the opportunity to master a choral<br/>concert and it was a wonderful challenge and learning experience.</p><p>&gt;Use a good pair of loud speakers, and if you want to get really serious about<br/>your mixing, go ahead and spring for a good<br/>set of &quot;near field&quot; monitors. Getting these was one of the best<br/>investments I&apos;ve made.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes... My current El Dorado in this direction will be attaining The<br/>Tannoy System 800a monitors; at some point that is...</p><p>A good pair of headphones never hurts either; I love the Sennheiser line; the<br/>pair I have are circumaural so you can have them on and still hear the monitors<br/>through the headphones.</p><p>Well, unfortunately my university engagements are getting ahead of me now, so I<br/>must pull on the reins then beat them with a stick. I am actually a gluten for<br/>punishment. I think I am going to stay for 2 quarters beyond my commitment and<br/>take 2 differential equations classes, a digital filters, and DSP course in<br/>the EE department.</p><p>I&apos;ll pop by around June with something a little more interesting on the<br/>composition/technical angle.</p><p>Oh I almost forgot... Check out Guiseppi Mendoza&apos;s Scale Browser at:<br/><a href="http://www.mendozadil.freeserve.co.uk/">http://www.mendozadil.freeserve.co.uk/</a><br/>It displays the contents of the SCALA database neatly. It also converts the DB<br/>to formats readable by some soft synths (Pro-52 and Vaz). If you have a tuning<br/>file format (Infinity/Reaktor, etc.) and would like support added send him the<br/>file and he will probably update the program that day. Reaktor does have a 128<br/>step retuning via the Event Table. From my understanding it is not directly a<br/>tuning specific file, but is a table that is converted to represent a tuning<br/>file when loaded in a certain context. This is all I know. If anyone uses this<br/>drop Guiseppi a note. I don&apos;t know if he has been around these parts, but he is<br/>into the microtonal world.</p><p>Best regards,<br/>--Mike</p><p>PS. here is an interesting little sound file I created while dabbling recently.<br/>In this instance there is a chain of 5 plugins (2 do the most work the others<br/>are icing). The first is set to extreme values and is creating sound from<br/>&quot;no-input&quot;. IE I can put this combo in any VST host and create the same sounds<br/>with the sequencer/environment in &quot;stop&quot; mode. I am linearly changing<br/>parameters with the mouse for about 3 minutes. It is not a track, but it amuses<br/>me and I am going to create something larger from this resource. At times it<br/>gives sounds similar to pulsar synthesis/Pulsar Generator of Roads fame.<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/no-input-playing-around.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/no-input-playing-around.mp3</a></p></div>
