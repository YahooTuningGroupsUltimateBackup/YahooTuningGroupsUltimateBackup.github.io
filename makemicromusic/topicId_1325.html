Ennealimmal<br/>is a microtemperament, which means you can use in in just intonation<br/>(just pretend 2401/2400 and 4375/4374 are unisons) or retune things<br/>very slightly so they actually are.

I<br/>&gt; realize you do a lot of harmonization, but many people find the<br/>&gt; composition/performance of multiple-pitch tunings to be difficult with a<br/>&gt; traditional kbd layout, and I had no idea this is the tack you were following.</p><p>I&apos;m with Jon here. This is a very interesting and unique way of<br/>working.

I believe that Lou was acutely aware of this and used very strict formal methods as, effectively, a substitute for the deep cultural background that he could not bring to new materials. If you are committed to your project as an improvisational one, I can not immage any reason why improvisation should not be compatible with such formal controls, indeed, I suspect it might give you more opportunity to attend to the surface (ornaments, articulation) of your improvisation.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for sharing, this was a real pleasure, even if the JI version<br/>&gt; is only available on the commercial recording . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>The websites are completely confused about which performance is JI and which is not.

The percussionist and I<br/>happened to be invited, without warning, into a recording studio, and<br/>the inspiration that leads to memorable (or maybe just remembering)<br/>melodic figures, or spontaneously tight formal structures, was<br/>clearly lacking that day.

Another treasure at Frog Peak is Clarence Barlow&apos;s _Bus Journey to Parametron_  (actually 3 volumes of the journal &quot;Feedback Papers&quot;), which is crazy to look at (imagine an Ivor Darreg tome laid out on a PDP-11), controversial on many points, but a great insight into how a composer works (including how a composer arrives at a particular tuning system) and a work of some comic literary genius, full of puns, suggestive misspellings and grammar in freefall.
