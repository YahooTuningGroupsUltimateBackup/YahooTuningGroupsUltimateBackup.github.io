I&apos;m leaning to an actual hardware box for now, as I can put it in my mobile rack for when I need to cobble sounds for the orchestra or opera (tuned gongs, large church bells, sound effects) without fussing with the laptop.</p><p>One thing I&apos;m considering is what *was* near-top of the line, say, two years ago. This way I&apos;ll be fairly current, compatability-wise, and I don&apos;t have _huge_ demands to make of the box, but won&apos;t have to pay for the absolute cutting edge. Also, I&apos;ll probably plan on preparing the samples in the digital realm on the computer, rather then relying on the sampler for too much editing.</p><p>Any suggestions *gratefully* appreciated...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=890 href="#890">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/3/2001 3:03:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>K2500 with KDFX (the effects card).</p><p>Don&apos;t know their current price but with the introduction of the K2600<br/>its dropped considerably.</p><p>Gorgeous sound and easily microtuned.</p><p>The only disadvantage is that samples specifically for the Kurzweill<br/>use their own proprietary format which none of the new software<br/>samplers can use.  So your sample library is useless say in Giga<br/>Sampler or Unity.</p><p>Having used GigaSampler for more than a month now I have become very<br/>spoiled.  It is so easy to switch samples, make things multitimbral<br/>easily adjust midi channels etc.  But if you are sure you want to go<br/>the hardware route make sure you check out the K2500.</p><p>Oh and I know you were just teasing with me.  And I&apos;m usually not so<br/>transparent with my methods, but it was useful for me, at least, to<br/>remember &quot;I create &quot;  So easy to forget and go into victimhood...</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=901 href="#901">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/3/2001 4:40:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My Akai drives me insane. There&apos;s got to be something better than<br/>&gt; this.</p><p>Agreed.  Same with the Kurzweill in transferring samples from the<br/>computer to it, either through SCsI or midi.  Even wwhen everything<br/>is lined up correctly with all the various identifiers, it still<br/>takes forever.  And if the power goes off you lose everything (kind<br/>of like russian roullete) And to save samples you have modified in<br/>the sampler itself you get to do the whole drill backwards.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m going to upgrade the PC this year and go software. Looking<br/>&gt; at the Unity DS-1 or Giga-Sampler (like Sister Mary).</p><p>One very cool thing with GigaSampler is that it is very easy to<br/>assign the same sample to 16 channels, something you need to do if<br/>you are working with FTS which sends the pitch bend information on<br/>different channels.  On the Kurzweill it is rather tedious to have to<br/>set all 16 channels to the same sample.  Another cool thing is that<br/>it can read wav files and make a quick sample map of them.</p><p>That means all your acid CD&apos;s are now part of your sample library,<br/>among other things.</p><p>BTW I haven&apos;t had very good experiences with Unity on the MAc -<br/>constantly crashes and didn&apos;t sound very good to my ears, when all<br/>was said and done.</p><p> &gt;Mary - can Giga<br/>&gt; do true Mono-Legato Mode? Where you can hold down one note and<br/>trill<br/>&gt; another above and below without retriggering the attack???</p><p>I tried this and I didn&apos;t hear any retriggering, so I think it can.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Any suggestions *gratefully* appreciated...<br/>&gt;<br/>Jacky I wonder if sharing the music is making us more telepathic, or<br/>at least on the same wavelength!  Just saw you latest question to<br/>Paul and I had exactly the same question.  I had taken out Excel and<br/>actually tried subsituting different numerators, and wasn&apos;t getting<br/>the same results, and was about to pose it myself.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=910 href="#910">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>10/4/2001 2:21:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;9pg7le+gc79@...&gt;<br/>Mary wrote:</p><p>&gt; One very cool thing with GigaSampler is that it is very easy to<br/>&gt; assign the same sample to 16 channels, something you need to do if<br/>&gt; you are working with FTS which sends the pitch bend information on<br/>&gt; different channels.

See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bitheadz.com/">http://www.bitheadz.com/</a>&gt;.  We know this does support full keyboard<br/>tuning tables, and they even advertise it, so it would be my first choice<br/>as a software sampler, if I decide Kyma isn&apos;t right for the job.</p><p>I suppose I could use the demo to test Windows stability, but in what way<br/>doesn&apos;t the sound quality compare?</p><p>&gt;  &gt;Mary - can Giga<br/>&gt; &gt; do true Mono-Legato Mode?

I&apos;ve never<br/>&gt; noiticed it interfering with timing, for instance.</p><p>It means you have to run 2 extra programs: FTS and MidiYoke.  And I don&apos;t<br/>know if you can relay from a sequencer with multiple channels yet.  Also,<br/>the sequencer has to talk to MidiYoke instead of the synthesizer, and the<br/>relaying program has to release the keyboard input channel.  It makes<br/>everything simpler not to have to do all this.</p><p>&gt; Most likely the latter.

The former isn&apos;t really a problem so far, and for<br/>the latter I can use my AWE64&apos;s hardware synth (with digital output) if I<br/>can be bothered to use pitch bend tuning and edit the SoundFonts.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So get one :)  Or keep waiting for the obvious hardware upgrade<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; on-board hard disk.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I need space to add it, and a free computer slots.  Hopefully my new<br/>&gt; studio will be finished by spring and then it will be one of my first<br/>&gt; purchases.</p><p>Indeed, you will need a PCI slot.  I use an external modem which helps for<br/>that.  The Capybara can be rackmounted, which keeps it out of the way, but<br/>if you want it any distance from the PC remember to ask for a long cable.</p><p>&gt; BTW if you search KYMA on the DUC it tends to get very high praise.</p><p>It is a good system, but with some silly weaknesses like not having a Mono<br/>mode, which I might ask them about over the weekend.  I&apos;m also finding it<br/>doesn&apos;t work with hard disk multitracking.  I don&apos;t know what the problem<br/>is there.  If you aren&apos;t trying to run your entire studio with it, I<br/>expect you&apos;ll find it very powerful and efficient.</p><p>While I&apos;m on the subject, how are people getting on with audio sequencing?<br/> What kind of system do you need to get 4 or 8 stereo tracks?</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
