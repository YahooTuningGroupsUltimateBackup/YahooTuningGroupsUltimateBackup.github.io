Other venues exist simply on their own. Either way, they<br/>show individual profiles in their arts offerings.</p><p>Some of the wackiest and most cutting-edge events can be found at<br/>REDCAT (the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater), housed in the same<br/>complex as Walt Disney Concert Hall. There will be a tribute to<br/>contemporary microtonal composer Ben Johnston on May 17, and the<br/>ensemble Partch will continue an ongoing multimedia survey of the<br/>chamber music of maverick composer Harry Partch on May 30.&quot;</p><p>More at <a href="http://redcat.org/season/0506/mus/johnston.php">http://redcat.org/season/0506/mus/johnston.php</a><br/>and <a href="http://redcat.org/season/0506/mus/partch.php">http://redcat.org/season/0506/mus/partch.php</a></p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
