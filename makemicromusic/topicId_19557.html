I want to try... :-D</p><p>Thanks, and I don&apos;t mind at all, though I&apos;ll have to give you the short version here; I don&apos;t even remember all of the rules right now.</p><p>Basically, you want octaves to be 72 commas (1/72-octave steps), fifths 24 and fourths 30 - those are the perfect consonances. Major thirds are almost always 23 steps, i.e. four ET semitones lowered by a comma (16.667 cents). Diatonic semitones are usually, but not always, 7 steps. After that, it gets complicated - major seconds can be 11 or 12 commas, minor thirds usually 19 but sometimes 18, the augmented fourth tritone 35 but the diminished fifth 37, chromatic semitones 4 or 5, neutral thirds 21, neutral seconds 9 or less commonly 10, and so on ad nauseam. The diesis, or the difference between two enharmonic tones and also a half sharp or flat, can either be 2 or 3 commas; the latter case would be the quarter tone.</p><p>The voicing of the minor seventh depends on the chord. A resolving seventh chord (e.g. the V7-I progression) is 0 23 42 60, the resolved (harmonic) seventh is 0 23 42 58, and the minor seventh chord is usually 0 19 42 61, but occasionally a rougher-sounding 0 18 42 60. You often have to watch out for the &quot;comma pump&quot; problem in certain chord progressions.</p><p>In scales containing sesquitones (augmented seconds), including the harmonic minor and maqam Hijaz, the step size is generally 16. The minor second is raised by a comma and the major third is lowered by a comma, producing the tetrachord 7 16 7 (cumulative: 7 23 30).</p><p>I also group the 72 pitches in the octave into 41 groups, and again into 31. I&apos;m still working on that document that explains how I do this. Just visualize building a replica of your favorite architectural wonder using LEGO (TM) blocks - you get not-quite-precise approximations of Pythagorean and meantone. I&apos;ll have to stop here for now, but read about Miracle temperament in the meantime, if you haven&apos;t already.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2008 9:02:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There&apos;s no rush, and it&apos;s okay if you don&apos;t get the piano one done.
