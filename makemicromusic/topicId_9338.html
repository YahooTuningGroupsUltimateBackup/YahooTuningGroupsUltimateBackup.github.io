All without bouncing.</p><p>No explanation is required, as I am making no exotic claims here, just reporting my experiences.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that this may be the platform that you are invested in, &gt; but<br/>&gt; Sonar + any of a number of soft insts completely fills the bill, &gt; without<br/>&gt; any of the workarounds and limitations you mention.</p><p>Tell us more: please particularly, with reference to microtuning, with different DAW&apos;s: (Sonar, Reason, Edirol ?? .......) and platforms: (M$, Linux, OSX  ?? ...................)</p><p>I wish to avoid the old M$ versus *nix, battle, as I know which side I am on;</p><p>but someone out in microtunland might still be interested in using JI or M$. ;-)</p><p>&gt; Does Logic not have the<br/>&gt; ability to use VST instruments?</p><p>Logic Pro 7 can use most VST instruments, but you have to convert them for use within Logic to AU format plug-ins;</p><p>There&apos;s a program called VSTAuConfigure by Fxansion to do this,</p><p><a href="http://www.fxpansion.com/">http://www.fxpansion.com/</a></p><p>and the latest version seems to work for the VST&apos;s that I have experimented with.</p><p>They are AU plug-ins for most of the VST plug-in functions, (all that I have recently needed  are included in Logic Pro 7); although I have converted many VST to experiment with them.<br/>Many other programs are now also available in OSX e.g. Melodyne, Cameleon, and others.<br/>There are a few other interesting AU plug-in virtual synths and percussion programs already supplied in Logic Pro 7. including Sculpture, and Ultrabeat.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Jonathan M.

I didn&apos;t automatically read into it &quot;the way that is working best for me&quot;. As you say later, the options are flying fast and furious these days, hard to keep up.</p><p>&gt;Tell us more: please particularly, with reference to microtuning, with &gt;different DAW&apos;s: (Sonar, Reason, Edirol ?? .......) and platforms: (M$, &gt;Linux, OSX  ?? ...................)</p><p>Hey, I can only report how it is going for me: my main recording/midi platform is Sonar 4.0.2 with an LX6 Pro audio/midi interface; additional audio programs: Sound Forge 7.0 with iZotope Ozone mastering plugin, misc other audio tools; additional midi programs: well, I have fun sometimes with KeyKit. Software includes BigTick Rhino 2.0, Virsyn Tera 2.0, LinPlug CronoX 2.0, rgc:audio z3ta+ (all of these completely tuneable via .scl or .tun files). I have been trying VSampler3, but their microtuning support isn&apos;t working correctly, and they don&apos;t seem like a real solid developer - CronoX3 will be out soon and looks to be a monster combination of sampling and synthesis.</p><p>I know, what a bunch of gear-speak. But, hey, they all work, and solidly. One of the interesting things is that right now it seems like a good number of the micro-capable soft instruments also happen to be either popular with a certain crowd or have caught the ear of good sound designers, because there are a large number of free or low-cost libraries of patches to add on.</p><p>&gt;but someone out in microtunland might still be interested in using JI or &gt;M$. ;-)</p><p>Yeah, I don&apos;t care *what* platform they use, as long as it does what they need to facilitate making new music.</p><p>&gt;They are AU plug-ins for most of the VST plug-in functions, (all that I &gt;have recently needed  are included in Logic Pro 7); although I have &gt;converted many VST to experiment with them.Many other programs are now &gt;also available in OSX e.g. Melodyne, Cameleon, and others. There are a few &gt;other interesting AU plug-in virtual synths and percussion programs &gt;already supplied in Logic Pro 7. including<br/>&gt;Sculpture, and Ultrabeat.</p><p>I&apos;ve also tried to only report here on the ones that can be tuned completely, as opposed to those that need tuning with pitch bends; if nothing else, supplying just *how* an instrument fits into the microtonal usage helps clarify the issue for people investigating or just starting out.</p><p>As enamored as I am with the Mac OS (and I&apos;ve never owned one), it is unfortunate that the current bulk of development in VST instruments skews to PC. Of the one&apos;s I use, the LinPlug instruments are available as native AU instruments.</p><p>&gt;It would be great to read other people&apos;s recent experience on other platforms.</p><p>I&apos;ve given mine above, and I believe Aaron Johnson has detailed (at least partially) his work in Linux. I one time pushed to have a page where each person submitted their current studio/DAW/whatever setup; unfortunately, contributions were essentially nil.</p><p>&gt;This technology is moving so fast that it is no longer practical for me &gt;and many others to keep constant track of developments.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;I wonder how Sonar + others gets around the problem of wanting to use say &gt;(thinking in meantone terms, and playing a 12tET midi file) G# in Bar 4, &gt;and Ab in Bar 5. Can a different tunings be used and sounded in each track &gt;simultaneously?</p><p>To the last question, yes. Each synth can carry it&apos;s own tuning, so you can have multiple, simultaneous tuning schemes at work. We need to remember, on the former, that Sonar (and I imagine all the other apps similar) are still working under the 12tet paradigm, so as far as notation and &apos;thinking&apos; in meantone terms, one would have to do that conceptually (by keyboard layouts or simply knowing in your head what keys generate which pitches).</p><p>&gt;This seems to be the obvious way to do it, although yet to be available in &gt;Logic Pro 7.</p><p>That&apos;s too bad. If nothing else, it is an interesting place to experiment, when you can set up two or more tracks with differing tunings and see how they can co-exist.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9341 href="#9341">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2005 12:32:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Charles,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;makemicro@l...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I wonder how Sonar + others gets around the problem of<br/>&gt; wanting to use say (thinking in meantone terms, and playing<br/>&gt; a 12tET midi file) G# in Bar 4, and Ab in Bar 5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can a different tunings be used and sounded in each track<br/>&gt; simultaneously?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems to be the obvious way to do it, although yet<br/>&gt; to be available in Logic Pro 7.</p><p>a question like this came up on the tuning list recently,<br/>and i&apos;ll repeat here basically what i wrote there ...</p><p>our Tonalsoft Musica (release 1.0 scheduled for this summer)<br/>does not have any default tuning, and requires the user<br/>to set up tunings before composing anything.</p><p>it&apos;s no problem to set up a meantone which contains both<br/>G# and Ab ... it can be a closed EDO meantone like 19, 31,<br/>or 55, or it can be open-ended like 1/4-comma or LucyTuning.<br/>the lattices of the EDOs are toruses, and the others are<br/>helixes.</p><p>you can see some screenshots of helical lattices in the<br/>Encyclopedia &quot;meantone&quot; entry, about 3/4 of the way down<br/>the page:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/meantone.htm#helix">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/meantone.htm#helix</a></p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=9342 href="#9342">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2005 1:01:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have used logic , at least on my friend machine to run a sampler that could take any number of pitches we wanted. i keep hoping to do more with my copy here, but time and more immediate musical demands usually keep this on the back burner.
