I&apos;d have to absolutely know for<br/>&gt; sure before<br/>&gt; I spend my hard earned dough on Reaktor if it can do full<br/>&gt; arbitrary<br/>&gt; retuning.</p><p>Reaktor came out of Generator mainly by combinig it with the<br/>sample oriented Dynamo package, so I tend to believe the<br/>features it had are still all there... Something on the<br/>practical aspects:</p><p>My slider thing worked like this: slider 1 selects an<br/>unchanging note (say, midi# 60), the patch figures out the<br/>difference to the note number played (say # 61; a difference<br/>of 1.000), and then slider number 2 multiplies this<br/>difference (say, by .41... for 29-ET, or - making a patch<br/>for every single event as serious electronic musicians<br/>should -  by 498 for making a single pitch glissando into a<br/>chord of fourths [playing a cluster on the keyboard] ...).<br/>The sliders are midi sliders, i.e. they have 128<br/>subdivisions, and you can customize them by setting a lower<br/>and upper limit and/or by entering the step size you want<br/>(in semitones, 1c = 0.01). A composer friend of mine used<br/>this to decide on small, melodically feasible step sizes for<br/>a quartet piece with beats (acoustical).</p><p>Things I haven&apos;t tried:<br/>There are a number of step sequencers of &quot;different&quot; sizes<br/>(4, 8, and 16 or such like), so if you enter a fine enough<br/>tuning for whatever you want and it is impossible to play<br/>because the intervals are too wide, you can still have it<br/>played by the program itself and write your music to disk<br/>bit by bit.<br/>You can also filter for note numbers and assign a different<br/>&quot;decimal note number&quot; to each one (60-&gt;60, 62-&gt;6.08,<br/>64-&gt;63.86 ...). Enjoy! (They say the computer will only be<br/>burdened with active signal paths, so presumably this<br/>doesn&apos;t take away any resources from the sound processing -<br/>still a lot to code, but again, you should be able to turn<br/>every tuning into a macro that you can insert into the path<br/>of every sound generator or sample mangler you have.)</p></div>
