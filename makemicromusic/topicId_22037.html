In fact, in Native American tribal cultures, there was no system of monetary exchange, and I seriously think that was the way to live. The idea of exchanging paper for real items isn&apos;t working so well right now, because it&apos;s an illusion of meaning...the sooner we can get back to a tribal based way of life, the better. I&apos;d gladly play for free as long as I have shelter and food for free...best...Hstick<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Hotmail: Trusted email with powerful SPAM protection.<br/><a href="http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/210850553/direct/01/">http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/210850553/direct/01/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
