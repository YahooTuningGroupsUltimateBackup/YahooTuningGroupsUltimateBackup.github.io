I suppose the timbres are generally<br/>&gt; harmonic - right, wrong?</p><p>OK. All the timbres (&quot;bass&quot; and &quot;synths&quot;) are primarily harmonic.<br/>I kind of cheated a bit by assigning all voices to the<br/>&quot;same&quot; timbre, which was (in the program) harmonic with<br/>7 partials, and a decay of 0.95 for successive partials.<br/>Thus I did the adaptation before assigning the voices,<br/>and so they dont match up *exactly*... On the other hand,<br/>this way I could listen to the adapted (pitch bent) performance<br/>and assign voices by ear (I probably auditioned 8 or 10 basses<br/>before I found the &quot;right&quot; one, and dozens of synth sounds.)</p><p>&gt; Neat bass!</p><p>Guess I chose the right one!</p><p>Im hoping to have a version of the adaptation program<br/>available sometime in the not-too-distant future.<br/>In my early adapted pieces I was using Matlab to do the<br/>processing - this is cumbersome, non-real-time, and<br/>user hostile. In Wing Donevier (and in Local Anomaly, if<br/>you remember that one) Ive been using an implementation in<br/>Max that is (almost) real time.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=2887 href="#2887">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2002 10:48:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill!</p><p>I&apos;m away from home with the laptop, so I&apos;ll have to listen to the music later, but...</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., sethares@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; Im hoping to have a version of the adaptation program<br/>&gt; available sometime in the not-too-distant future.<br/>&gt; In my early adapted pieces I was using Matlab to do the<br/>&gt; processing - this is cumbersome, non-real-time, and<br/>&gt; user hostile.</p><p>Great term: &quot;user hostile&quot;!</p><p>&gt; In Wing Donevier (and in Local Anomaly, if<br/>&gt; you remember that one) Ive been using an implementation in<br/>&gt; Max that is (almost) real time.</p><p>Cool - do you know if they are any closer to a PC version of Max? One of my close colleagues here in SD is married to Peter Otto, who (at UCSD) is doing ground-breaking work with spacialization and related mixing work with Max. She remarked at a concert the other night that Peter was home &quot;working on some new flocking algorithm&quot;, and I&apos;ve heard some of his real-time spacialization work - it is *awesome*.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
