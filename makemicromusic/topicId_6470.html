It&apos;s *great* !!!&apos;, a valid and concise description of<br/>the experience of hearing this CD.</p><p>There are even more tracks (19) than there were on the &apos;Xentonality&apos; Cd, and<br/>this 2nd CD (from 2002) shows what five more years of musical and technical<br/>experience has given Bill&apos;s work. I find the &apos;exomusicology&apos; disk a much more<br/>evenly high level listening experience, and sonically richer. As well, there<br/>is a tighter rhythmic feel.</p><p>&apos;Apprehension of Time&apos; and &apos;Persistence of Time&apos; reveal Bill in what I call<br/>his &apos;percussive mode&apos;, where &apos;spectral drumming&apos; is dominant (although in<br/>&apos;Persistence of Time&apos; there are quite a few othere synth lines going on as<br/>well). These are quite enjoyably &apos;cro-magnon&apos; tracks, and as a composer, I<br/>finish hearing them refreshed and inspired to explore some of the directions<br/>Bill opens up.</p><p>A very funky humourous track is &apos;Local Anomaly&apos;, where a guitar-like timbre<br/>Bill calls a &apos;triangulaika&apos; (a play on Balalaika) is composed to do adaptive<br/>real-time JI adjustments to the next simultaneous pitches.</p><p>There are several extremely unique and special tracks to be found on this<br/>disk. Notable is &apos;Over Venus&apos; for its beautifully alien take on overtones and<br/>drones. An instrument the liner notes calls a &apos;Klein trumpet&apos; has a strange<br/>disembodied sound to it that is quite striking. &apos;When everything was<br/>simultaneous&apos; and &apos;Temporal Consciousness&apos; use speech elements in a uniquely<br/>strange and spectral way. This listener has heard nothing quite like it.</p><p>&apos;Intersecting Spheres&apos; is notable for its use of a gorgeous stereo field where<br/>all sorts of very optimistic sounding &apos;Close encounters&apos; type sounds groove<br/>over an afro-cuban type rhythm. It&apos;s sure to put a smile on your face.</p><p>&apos;Pulsing Silences&apos; and &apos;Nexus&apos; are different yet similar tour-de-force studies<br/>of how much can be done with a single note (overtone series music) is there<br/>is sufficient spectral variation. Wonderful &apos;ambient electronica&apos; tracks.<br/>Bill could, and should, come out with a whole album of this style alone, and<br/>it would get gobbled up greedily by the Brian Eno crowd.</p><p>We enter the realm of the tongue-and-cheek &apos;Star Trek&apos; geek crown with<br/>&apos;Sonork&apos; and &apos;Rojqoq&apos;, which both have a nice heavy aggresiveness to them.<br/>There are great llittle subtle layers of &apos;Star Trek&apos; ship sounds placed into<br/>the mix of the latter ! These tracks are a lot of fun, and show Bill at his<br/>humourous best.</p><p>There are 2 &apos;cosmic 7-tet gamelan&apos; tracks. &apos;Pagan&apos;s revenge&apos;, a stellar,<br/>energetic track which is structurally a giant melodic palindrome, has a<br/>wonderfully knotty line that grabs your attention and doesn&apos;t let it go.<br/>And &apos;Nothing Broken in Seven&apos; builds its gorgeously kaleidescopic texture with<br/>techniques of delay that are reminiscent of Steve Reich. I don&apos;t know if my<br/>disk was flawed, but this track, the last track of the disk, ends abrubptly<br/>at 3:25 as if the cosmic arts council ran out of yttrium recording media!!!</p><p>A very enjoyable disk, folks, definately a must-own if one wants to have some<br/>current and essential microtonal repertoire!!!</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div>
