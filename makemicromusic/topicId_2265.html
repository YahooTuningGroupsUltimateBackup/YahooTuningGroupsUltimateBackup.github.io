The<br/>&gt;&gt; most powerful aural experiences I had had with JI were when I could<br/>&gt;really<br/>&gt;&gt; hear the caressing &quot;buzz&quot; of partials locking in together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.E:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;i think it&apos;s really the &apos;locking&apos; of the combinational tones and the<br/>&gt;virtual pitch, produced by the fundamentals and the partials, not<br/>&gt;the &apos;locking&apos; of the partials themselves. for if it were, a utonal<br/>&gt;chord like 1/(16:17:20) would lock just as well -- it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>Yeah agreed, I think I meant &quot;composed out partials&quot; or &quot;partials with<br/>o-series of their own&quot;.</p></div>
