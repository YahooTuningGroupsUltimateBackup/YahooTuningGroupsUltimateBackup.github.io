Directly in contrast to your claim that<br/>&gt; &quot;emancipation of dissonance&quot; wasn&apos;t about being as dissonant as possible.<br/>&gt; So, it&apos;s you vs. Schoenberg about how to understand Schoenberg. I gave you<br/>&gt; all the relevant quotes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean, I gave about 3 or 4 direct source quotes from the man himself. Now<br/>&gt; you are saying I was claiming and arguing things that I wasn&apos;t even talking<br/>&gt; about. I already agreed with you about the overtone series, but pointed out<br/>&gt; that it was moot. Now you&apos;re all over the map, dude. You&apos;re not arguing any<br/>&gt; one thing anymore, but having an argument with yourself, claiming I said<br/>&gt; things I didn&apos;t even say, or more to the point, didn&apos;t even care about for<br/>&gt; this whole conversation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not even trying to discredit Schoenberg as you claim, either his<br/>&gt; writings or his theories, although the sense that Carl has that he&apos;s a bit<br/>&gt; of a hack when it comes to musical cognition and acoustics is probably not<br/>&gt; far from the truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s what happened:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) I claimed 11 or 13 edo would be a good way to do neo-Schoenbergian<br/>&gt; serialism. I mentioned &quot;emancipation of the dissonance&quot;<br/>&gt; 2) You said &quot;emancipation of the dissonance&quot; is not about &quot;being as<br/>&gt; dissonant as possible&quot;<br/>&gt; 3) I said it didn&apos;t matter since Schoenberg didn&apos;t worry about consonance<br/>&gt; and dissonance in the traditional sense, only about row structure and<br/>&gt; identity.<br/>&gt; 4) You then started claiming that I missed the point, and that it was about<br/>&gt; overtones. Which was and is completely moot.<br/>&gt; 5) I then gave you a series of direct quotes which backed up my points about<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s conception of serialism, including a quote which suggested that<br/>&gt; he did favor &quot;being as dissonant as possible&quot; by favoring dissonant<br/>&gt; harmonies in simultaneous tones.<br/>&gt; 6) You then again claimed I was missing the point, and that it was about<br/>&gt; overtones. Again, not listening to what I was saying, what Schoenberg<br/>&gt; himself was saying, or even what you were saying, and now having a<br/>&gt; completely orthogonal conversation.<br/>&gt; 7) Exasperated, I re-quoted Schoenberg.<br/>&gt; 8) Exasperated, you said it was about higher overtones.<br/>&gt; 9) Here we are, and you still haven&apos;t realized that Schoenberg didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; consider harmony when he wrote serial row music. And that he favored<br/>&gt; dissonances to show &quot;that the voices didn&apos;t care&quot; (direct quote), etc. You<br/>&gt; are still pointing out 13/8, 11/8, etc. Why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In short, I don&apos;t see what your point is. I was only trying to point out<br/>&gt; that 11-edo and 13-edo are perfect for abolishing, in the Schoenbergian<br/>&gt; sense, traditional associations. Period. And that idea still stands, and in<br/>&gt; essence, I don&apos;t see why you are huffing and puffing about anything, since<br/>&gt; you seem to agree with me about this basic point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can chase your tail all you want talking about other moot things, but I<br/>&gt; will simply re-post all these points, which are *Schoenberg&apos;s own words*,<br/>&gt; until you see what I&apos;ve (he has) been saying....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I stand corrected---you did mention &quot;Probleme der Harmonie&quot; in the<br/>&gt; first episode way back, before this thread really got going. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also said you were ignoring my direct Schoenberg quotes...you now say:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Not ignoring your quotes. Trying to explain to you the nature of what<br/>&gt; Schoenberg meant by dissonance.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m baffled why you think I&apos;d take your words over his own words, especially<br/>&gt; when they are in direct contradiction at times. I agree with you what he<br/>&gt; meant by dissonance---higher partials. But so what? How are they used? This<br/>&gt; is where you say it would be meaningless to consider a tuning that had no<br/>&gt; consonances. I&apos;m showing you it wouldn&apos;t be meaningless, because Schoenberg<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t find the distinction between consonance and dissonance important to<br/>&gt; his process, and furthermore, he favored dissonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; AKJ<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Mar 17, 2011 at 11:00 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Lobawad,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; On Thu, Mar 17, 2011 at 10:54 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Man kann nun sagen, und kann diesen Satz ziemlich weitgehend erproben<br/>&gt;&gt; und<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; beweisen, dass alle musikalischen Geschehnisse sich auf die<br/>&gt;&gt; Obertonreihe<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; zurueckfuehren lassen, so dass alles sich darstellt als Ausnuetzung<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; eifacherer un komplizierterer Verhaeltnisse dieser Reihe.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Followed by a &quot;13-limit JI&quot; structure, you can make a JI diagram from<br/>&gt;&gt; it.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I already said where to find this stuff- Probleme der Harmonie, 1927.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; This is the first time in this thread you mentioned &quot;Probleme der<br/>&gt;&gt; Harmonie&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; No it is not.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/26889">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/26889</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; But more to the point--you are ignoring my quotes which are direct<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;evidence<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; that Schoenberg considered consciously used dissonance &quot;to show how<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;little<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; the lines are worried&quot;.....<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; And, I think you could have at least translated to English for<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;me...this<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; passage doesn&apos;t really tell us anything.

Each step is 163.63636 cents, and you don&apos;t line up<br/>&gt; particularly well on any traditional 2, 3, or 5-limit consonance that<br/>&gt; I can see. The notes will &quot;show how little they are concerned&quot;....</p><p>Actually, that scale is just 3-out-of-22-EDO with the &quot;octave wrap&quot; removed, or in other words 22 equal divisions of 8/1.  There are going to be lots and lots of 3, 5, and 7-limit consonances that pop up in the higher registers.  Even in the first &quot;octave&quot; of the scale, you get a decent 6/5, 4/3, 8/5, and 7/4.  Might be harder to use this way, but there are still going to be consonances (and thus &quot;tonality&quot;).  Eliminating the octave doesn&apos;t really make for scales/tunings that are less consonant.  If anything, it means that there&apos;s a chance for consonant intervals to &quot;sneak in&quot; in higher registers.</p><p>Nothing personal, Jake (I know you&apos;re still new to this stuff), but I hate that most psychoacoustic theorists consider the octave a &quot;consonance&quot;.  That&apos;s like saying water has a delicious flavor.  2/1 to me has a nil value in terms of consonance or dissonance--it&apos;s &quot;tasteless&quot;.  And by this way of thinking, 1/1 is &quot;even more consonant&quot; than 2/1, so if we really want to escape consonant harmonies, we need to get away from the 1-limit!!!!</p><p>Anyone want to point me to a scale with no pure 1/1&apos;s?</p><p>;-p</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2011 2:50:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>untempered JI?

But the idea that the &quot;most consonant&quot;--i.e. &quot;most pleasant-sounding&quot; interval is 1/1, followed by 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, and 5/1, and THEN 3/2, etc.--seems ass-backwards to me.  To say that 1/1 sounds *better* than 2/1 and so on seems like nonsense.  Even more so the idea that 2/1 sounds better than 3/2.  In truth, the whole idea of quantifying musical intervals on a one-dimensional continuum seems nonsensical.  Does salt taste *better* than fish sauce?
