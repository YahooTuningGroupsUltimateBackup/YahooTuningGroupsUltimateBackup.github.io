One thing though (I&apos;m running 10.2.8 on an iMac): for<br/>the six &quot;Midi Channels/Strings&quot; the sliders are invisible.  They work, but they&apos;re<br/>invisible.</p><p>I&apos;m a bit confused as to how someone can take advantage of the tunings contained in<br/>&quot;open tuning.&quot;  It appears that you would need six separate input devices, or use<br/>something else to route regions of a keyboard to different channels.</p><p>The transposition feature just on one channel could be very useful for many-notes-<br/>per-octave tunings for people with small keyboards (like myself at the moment).</p><p>I look forward to a microtuning feature in the future!  One thing the OSX platform is<br/>still lacking is solid midi-relay retuning software (wellll maybe except XJ Scott&apos;s<br/>LMSO...I dunno).</p><p>Great job so far!</p><p>Jacob</p></div><h3>Philip &#x3C;philippe.gruchet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2004 8:22:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jacob,</p><p>&gt; the six &quot;Midi Channels/Strings&quot; sliders are invisible.</p><p>Strange.
