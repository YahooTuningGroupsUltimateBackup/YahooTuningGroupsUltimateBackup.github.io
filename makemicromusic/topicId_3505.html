They had never heard of the Scala file<br/>format and archive before, which is understandable because<br/>of the absence on the Mac until recently.<br/>A few years ago a user, that&apos;s Andrew Souter probably,<br/>sent a few hundred scales to Eric Wenger. He then put<br/>together a quick hack (his words) to enable Metasynth to<br/>read the scales sent to him. They never had complaints<br/>about file compatibility before. Wenger was told the scale<br/>files were public domain.</p><p>I pointed out they should use the recent version of the<br/>archive and not that old one, that I&apos;d like to be<br/>acknowledged, etc.<br/>I haven&apos;t heard yet what they are going to do now.</p><p>Jeff wrote:<br/>&gt;Hey Manuel, what is your policy on use of the Scala archive?</p><p>Well I don&apos;t claim copyright or anything like that, the<br/>scales are coming from a lot of different sources. But<br/>if anyone uses the archive as a whole then of course I&apos;d like<br/>a pointer to Scala or be acknowledged for the work I&apos;ve put in.</p><p>&gt;I inadvertantly included 11 Scala files I had been using for<br/>&gt;testing in a folder called &quot;Scala Files&quot; on a couple early<br/>&gt;copies of LMSO, but then removed them when I noticed as I<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t want to offend you or anything.</p><p>Oh, you&apos;re entirely free to do that.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
