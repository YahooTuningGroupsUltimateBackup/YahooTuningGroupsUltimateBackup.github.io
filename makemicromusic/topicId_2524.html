I haven&apos;t yet fully explored the harmonic resources of all the<br/>tetrachords taken together. Before I splatter the page with all these<br/>ratios, I&apos;d like to ask first if anyone has expanded Partch&apos;s successful<br/>11 limit system through 13,17 and 19, and used the system in actual<br/>melodic and harmonic music with acoustic instruments. Once I know this I<br/>can get on to my next questions.</p><p>I notice in &quot;The Just Intonation Primer&quot; that the author is sceptical or<br/>unsure as to the efficacy of ratios involving 17 and 19. I interpret<br/>this as relating to harmonic music. I personally have no doubt as to<br/>their usefulness in melodic music. Again I&apos;d be interested to hear<br/>from/of musicians who have used the higher primes successfully.</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3>kalleaho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2002 3:34:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Before I splatter the page with all these<br/>&gt; ratios, I&apos;d like to ask first if anyone has expanded Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; successful 11 limit system through 13,17 and 19, and used the<br/>&gt; system in actual melodic and harmonic music with acoustic<br/>&gt; instruments.

Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2002 10:58:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Alison, and please let me try to answer your question<br/>about JI in large part from experience, first giving just a bit of<br/>background on Partch and also Kathleen Schlesinger.</p><p>An important caution, which I add after reading your question again, is<br/>that my experience is with synthesized sound rather than acoustical<br/>instruments -- a very big distinction that should be pointed out early and<br/>often. However, Kathleen Schlesinger built flutes using her arithmetic<br/>series, as well as tuning some of the ratios on piano, while Partch&apos;s<br/>interest in a 17-limit system was connected with his experiences with<br/>custom instruments and tunings also.</p><p>Here I find it important to mention that while Harry Partch often<br/>focused on an 11-limit system of 43 notes, he also produced some<br/>beautiful diagrams for a 17-limit system which I saw in a recent<br/>collection from his manuscripts and correspondence.</p><p>Kathleen Schlesinger, in her _The Greek Aulos_ (1939), describes<br/>arithmetic divisions using many ratios with these higher factors, and<br/>people like Erv Wilson and Jacky Ligon have developed these ideas<br/>further.</p><p>Turning now to my own musical experience, an appropriate main focus<br/>for MMM, I can say that just ratios such as 14:17:21 or 46:56:69<br/>(23:28 below, 56:69 above) are beautiful and very musically effective<br/>in the kind of style I often favor. Also, I love melodic steps such as<br/>14:13 (~128.30 cents) for a large semitone or &quot;2/3-tone,&quot; nicely<br/>contrasting with small semitones or thirdtones such as 28:27 (~62.96<br/>cents).</p><p>In my view, the &quot;debate&quot; here is mostly theoretical: is there<br/>something &quot;special&quot; about a large minor or small neutral third at<br/>precisely 17:14 (~336.13 cents), in contrast for example to 63:52<br/>(~332.21 cents) or to 28:23 (~340.55 cents)? Or are they all examples<br/>of a general kind of interval around 330-341 cents, say, without any<br/>special significance for the exact integer ratios.</p><p>Either way, they can be used to make some beautiful music, so I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be too concerned about this kind of theoretical question --<br/>maybe I&apos;d consider it while making and enjoying the music, a curious<br/>kind of contemplation.</p><p>Please note that in using these just ratios, I tune a subset of them<br/>rather than a complete system of the kind that Partch describes for<br/>ratios of 11 or 17.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m often looking at certain categories of ratios from either a<br/>melodic or harmonic point of view. Thus something like 14:17:21<br/>suggests to me a three-voice sonority often resolving to a stable<br/>fifth, while 14:13 suggests a melodic step, although it might also be<br/>used as a vertical interval, as I use 13:7 (~1071.70 cents).</p><p>Anyway, Alison, please let me lend you lots of encouragement in<br/>exploring these higher just ratios.</p><p>For my own music, I already have a certain historical paradigm in<br/>13th-14th century European music -- but one subject to lots of<br/>revisions and additions. Devising a music with these ratios involving<br/>fewer stylistic preconceptions -- if that&apos;s possible -- could be a<br/>very interesting direction, with Erv Wilson&apos;s CPS kind of approach as<br/>one example.</p><p>Also, in reference to Harry Partch&apos;s system, I would caution that<br/>Partch&apos;s music is far more than just ratios or JI theory -- it&apos;s music<br/>with its own custom instruments as well as the presence of the<br/>performers and often the element of the text, and so forth.</p><p>In other words, if the question is whether one can and should make<br/>beautiful music with just ratios having factors such as 13, 17, 19,<br/>23, and so forth, I would say &quot;Yes!&quot;</p><p>Exactly how or why this music can be so beautiful, I leave to a more<br/>theoretical discussion, emphasizing that theoretical explanations are<br/>at best partial and imperfect.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>3/7/2002 9:50:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;a67tsg+83c1@...&gt;<br/>jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was able to show/play him several tunings made up of only<br/>&gt; superparticular step sizes, and while doing this the topic of MOS<br/>&gt; scales came up, and I tuned up a few MOS scales too. An interesting<br/>&gt; consensus between us, was that the MOS tunings were a melodic let-<br/>&gt; down when played side-by-side with the just tunings, having many<br/>&gt; different step sizes.</p><p>What size MOS were you using?  Meaning both the number of notes, and the<br/>ETs they subset/approximate.</p><p>&gt; When we heard them one after the other, we both agreed that there was<br/>&gt; something bland about the MOS, where the harmonic fragment tunings<br/>&gt; sustained our interest and made us just want to keep on improvising.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now - don&apos;t get me wrong. I really do like MOS subsets (from ETs),<br/>&gt; and consider them to be one of the three most important properties of<br/>&gt; ETs, yet for melodic based music, JI shines in ways that MOS might<br/>&gt; not.</p><p>That&apos;s a strange caveat.  If JI shines for *melodic* music, when MOS is a<br/>melodic property, it can&apos;t be so important after all.  Are you getting<br/>carried away by the &quot;there are no bad scales&quot; dogma?</p><p>I&apos;m also interested that you consider it a property of ETs.  I use MOS<br/>tunings that aren&apos;t ET subsets, and I think the melody works better that<br/>way.</p><p>&gt; I realize that all the above is somewhat subjective, but there was<br/>&gt; one other person in the room, who felt the shock and aural let-down<br/>&gt; of when we shifted our single note melodic instruments to MOS. (Even<br/>&gt; though - I still find them useful for harmony.)</p><p>Of course it&apos;s subjective!

Meaning both the number of notes,<br/>&gt; and the<br/>&gt; &gt; ETs they subset/approximate.</p><p>Jacky:<br/>&gt; Can&apos;t recall them all, as it wasn&apos;t really an experiment, but just a<br/>&gt; couple of friends trying out scales. I do recall that the first one<br/>&gt; was the 7 tone MOS from 17 ET, based on the Neu-3rd generator. And<br/>&gt; this was quite surprising to me too - since this is one of my<br/>&gt; favorite ETs and MOS patterns.</p><p>That&apos;s a small number of notes from a small ET, as I suspected.  I find<br/>small ETs do sound bland, so the solution is to use subsets of larger ETs.</p><p>Neutral third scales are a strange case, because I find the sameness of<br/>the intervals to be an advantage.  You get the familiar sound of a 7 note<br/>octave, but it&apos;s bleached out which is perfect for expressing alienation<br/>and emotional disengagement.  Exactly what I wanted when I originally<br/>found these scales.  The harmonic terrain of good fifths with bad thirds<br/>adds to the effect.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m also interested that you consider it a property of ETs.  I use<br/>&gt; MOS tunings that aren&apos;t ET subsets, and I think the melody works<br/>&gt; better that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh yes. I also do what you are talking about quite frequently as<br/>&gt; well, and I realize there can be any IEO that one desires. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; basic stuff.</p><p>Yes, but it does relate to the issue here.  An MOS should get spicier if<br/>it isn&apos;t a subset of a small ET.  And you can also take non-MOS subsets of<br/>an MOS keyboard mapping.  I&apos;m interested in linear temperaments precisely<br/>as a way of putting a keyboard out of equal tuning without losing<br/>predictable chord patterns.  I don&apos;t find I lose anything compared to JI.<br/>As I&apos;m currently using temperaments close to JI, I usually can&apos;t tell the<br/>difference for melody anyway.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course it&apos;s subjective!  All the most important things are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham - yes it&apos;s all subjective, and read nothing much into what I<br/>&gt; say here. This kind of reaction is bound to happen when one is<br/>&gt; exposed to a bunch of different tunings in one setting, whilst<br/>&gt; enjoying a good Merlot. Every now and then I feel compelled to remind<br/>&gt; my dear friends, that I like myriad of kinds of scales. So far I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; found few that I can&apos;t make some kind of music with. Even the ones<br/>&gt; that folks want to throw on the microtonal junk heap, I&apos;ll try out.<br/>&gt; Like that freaky 9 tone MOS from 22 ET - I like to take something<br/>&gt; like that to see what kind of music can be made from it.</p><p>You seem to have a much lower opinion of subjectivity to me.  As you&apos;re a<br/>talented musician, I read a lot into your subjective reactions.  As I&apos;m<br/>me, I completely rely on my own.</p><p>One thing about this simple scales -&gt; bland phenomenon is that it seems to<br/>all but vanish when you start with a good melody.  Obviously there have<br/>been some great tunes written in 12-equal.  Although they usually work<br/>fine in various well temperaments, they don&apos;t improve much either compared<br/>to electronically precise equality.  The more interesting a tune is, the<br/>less you listen to the tuning.  If you&apos;re noodling, a lot of what you hear<br/>is the tuning.  I don&apos;t know if the inequality becomes a problem with<br/>striking melodies (because it distracts from the melody itself) or the<br/>bonus interest is always a good thing.  I&apos;ll guess the latter, provided it<br/>doesn&apos;t conflict with your modulations.</p><p>Gene&apos;s identified this 9/22 as Orwell.  That&apos;s actually a cross between<br/>22- and 31-equal, so not such an obscure choice.  It also invites an<br/>intermediate temperament, or a mixture of 22, 31 an everything in between.<br/> And it leads to a new slogan -- &quot;all tunings are equal, but some tunings<br/>are more equal than others&quot;.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
