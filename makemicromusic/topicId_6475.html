Just for information, not at &gt;all as advertisements!  :-)</p><p>Yes, I think so, but maybe if all of us keep some of the following in mind:</p><p>&gt;Something like &quot;the next version of xyz will support microtuning by &gt;loading a certain tuning file format.&quot;</p><p>I am finding this not so helpful - in the last couple of years we see some people that say they will offer microtuning, but it is either not done or done in such an awkward manner as to be unusable in a realistic way. However...</p><p>&gt;Or, &quot;the last avalaible version of xyz is now handling microtuning via a &gt;specific internal setting: blah blah blah&quot;.</p><p>This is much better, which I will elaborate on below.</p><p>&gt;Or also, &quot;could you help me in my microtuning crusade to convince such &gt;software editor to include an alternate tuning feature&quot; etc, etc.</p><p>I have seen these kind of items get posted, but one must remember: this is a *very* small community. At best, we could hope that a couple of individuals could write up well thought-out reasons for a developer to support it, especially if they can supply them with an overview of current tuning file formats, etc. There is _no_way_ we could ever convince them that they will recoup a lot of effort through sales; this group currently numbers around 200, and there are forums dedicated to single softsynths that have over ten times that many members! We are a quite small group.</p><p>But by slowly amassing a body of good music, that shows what can be done, we might be able to convince both the developers AND the musicians that it is an avenue worthy of pursuit; this is happening more recently. But unless I personally am convinced that a significant number of people might actually purchase a particular micro app, I&apos;m not going to try and lead a group effort to convince the developer to put in a lot of work - they need to do it because it seems like the right or interesting thing to do. As it stands now, that feature will hardly pay for itself.</p><p>BUT! If you come across instruments or environments that allow microtuning, do it well, and *especially* if you&apos;ve used it and can show some examples, then it very much IS a good and positive thing to post about.

Often I prefer<br/>arrangements with 24 notes per octave where both keyboards have the<br/>same pattern of steps and intervals and are placed at some convenient<br/>distance apart. A general diagram, with an asterisk (*) representing<br/>the distance between the keyboards in a given system, might look like<br/>this:</p><p>        C#*     Eb*             F#*     G#*    Bb*<br/>  C*         D         E    F       G       A        B    C<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>        C#      Eb              F#      G#     Bb<br/>  C          D         E    F       G       A        B    C</p><p>For example, this scheme could use two 12-note Pythagorean tunings at<br/>a 64:63 or 7:6 apart, to get some pure ratios like 7:6, 9:7, and 7:4.<br/>Another example is two 12-note sets in some shade of meantone<br/>temperament, for example 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma, at a distance of what<br/>is called an &quot;enharmonic diesis&quot; -- the difference in a given<br/>temperament, for example, between G# and Ab. One favorite illustration<br/>of mine is Peppermint, with two 12-note sets of a regular temperament<br/>with fifths at around 704.10 cents (about 2.14 cents wide) placed at a<br/>distance of about 58.680 cents.</p><p>With a tuning set of 13-17 notes per octave, I use an arrangement<br/>somewhat analogous to 15th-18th century European keyboards with &quot;split<br/>key accidentals&quot; -- that is, with a black key divided into two parts,<br/>so that the front portion produces G# and the back portion Ab, for<br/>example. A &quot;conventional&quot; -- for me -- example, is my standard layout<br/>for a 17-note system dividing each whole-tone into three diatonic<br/>semitones or thirdtones, which I&apos;ve used for 17-equal or 17-tET,<br/>unequal well-temperaments, and also a just system called JOT-17:</p><p>                Db       D#       Gb     Ab      A#<br/>              C      D      E   F      G      A     B   C<br/>              -------------------------------------------<br/>                  C#   Eb           F#     G#   Bb<br/>              C      D      E   F      G      A     B   C</p><p>These models can also be adapted to what I might call, for me,<br/>somewhat less &quot;conventional&quot; tunings, where you can&apos;t form a 2:1<br/>octave from five identical whole-tones plus two identical semitones.<br/>For example, here&apos;s a mapping for 20-equal, based on two keyboards<br/>with identical patterns at 2 scale steps apart:</p><p>        5     7         13    15     18<br/>   2       6     9  10     14     17      21  22<br/> -------------------------------------------------<br/>        3     5         11    13     16<br/>   0       4     7  8      12     15      19  20</p><p>Here&apos;s an arrangement for 14-equal where only two of the accidental<br/>keys vary between the two keyboards, with the other notes the same on<br/>both:</p><p>     1    4       7   9    12<br/>  0    2    5  6    8    11   13  14<br/>-------------------------------------<br/>     1   3        7    10  12<br/>  0    2    5  6    8    11   13  14</p><p>Please let me emphasize that a choice of layouts can reflect the<br/>interval preferences or stylistic leanings of the person doing the<br/>layout, and also that these solutions might be considered rather crude<br/>compared to a generalized keyboard, for example, with up to 53 or more<br/>notes per octave.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6577 href="#6577">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2004 7:55:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter<br/>&lt;mschulter@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; One approach, which I follow, is to map such a tuning to two<br/>standard<br/>&gt; 12-note MIDI keyboards, with up to 24 notes per octave.
