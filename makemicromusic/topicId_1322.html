The major timbres<br/>in this are guitar-like, (and hence primarily harmonic), but<br/>the use of the adaptation is quite different from the<br/>earlier string quartet. Besides the obvious rhythmic drive of<br/>the piece, the notes come rapidly - rarely is a note held<br/>much longer than the time it takes it to converge to the<br/>&quot;corrected&quot; nearby consonant interval.</p><p>By careful composition in the previous piece, I kept<br/>the tonal center relatively stable, whereas here I just<br/>let the pitches fall where they may - and you can clearly<br/>hear the wriggling about of the tonal center - if indeed<br/>this piece has one... perhaps its better to think of<br/>it as having an &quot;average&quot; tonality that happens to have<br/>a pretty large variance...</p><p>Comments appreciated,</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=1323 href="#1323">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2001 11:26:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill,</p><p>What a *cool* piece! I really enjoyed how you varied the &apos;setting&apos; of<br/>the parts, from very short, pizz-like envelopes to longer, sustained<br/>ones, cut off only by the attack of the next. A lot of variety in the<br/>arrangement.

The funky and somewhat dark drumming,<br/>along with (from what I heard, see below) basically minor cast of the<br/>piece gives it a great, &quot;East Bay Grease&quot;-style feel to it.</p><p>Thanks for your ventures in this area!</p><p>As an aside, I&apos;ll try and go back to your university site (I&apos;m sure I<br/>can ressurect the link) because Yahoo! is still being crappy about<br/>decent downloads - I only got about half the file. Would you mind<br/>posting a link to the directory where your music is stored at your<br/>site? I don&apos;t know if you have this piece there, but maybe you could<br/>post them there as well in case people have trouble dl&apos;ing here.</p><p>I can&apos;t tolerate this situation too much longer, so the new year may<br/>see some action from List Mom so this group can have a stable,<br/>reliable place to share the music...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
