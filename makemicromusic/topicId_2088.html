However, not having the means to listen to MIDI files or<br/>audio<br/>&gt; files on the Web -- although I can create the former, and with the<br/>&gt; help of generous people such as Jacky Ligon and a number of others<br/>who<br/>&gt; have most generously offered their assistance also the latter -- I<br/>had<br/>&gt; until recently experienced only his words, but not his music itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That music is indeed copious and diverse, showing a love of many<br/>world<br/>&gt; traditions and the ability, also featured by xenharmonicists such as<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon and Mary Beth Ackerley, to bring them together in a<br/>&gt; special kind of synthesis. My initial impressions of the CD he sent<br/>me<br/>&gt; as a kind of Christmas and New Year&apos;s gift can only hint at the<br/>beauty<br/>&gt; of his achievements, which, happily, many of you can hear in forums<br/>&gt; such as this, or on his Web site:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The opening piece on the CD I received is in a tuning called<br/>&gt; Sesquisexta, one in which two 12-note Pythagorean chains of fifths<br/>are<br/>&gt; placed at a pure 7:6 apart. Robert&apos;s piece in this scale is a chant,<br/>a<br/>&gt; statement of pure melody, and one most eloquent. Having seen his<br/>&gt; discussion of this piece, maybe in this forum, I recalled that there<br/>&gt; was a 64:63 comma shift -- but found myself simply taking in the<br/>&gt; eloquent flow of the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe this ties in with Jon Szanto&apos;s observation that one can listen<br/>&gt; for &quot;microtonality&quot; or simply for music, and that the latter<br/>approach<br/>&gt; has its own virtues. One thing I can say is that it&apos;s a delight to<br/>see<br/>&gt; and hear the Sesquisexta tuning being used in ways that only other<br/>&gt; musicians can come up with, and to reminded that pure melody has its<br/>&gt; own possibilities. Robert&apos;s piece, like a Gregorian chant or an<br/>&gt; English folk melody of the kind that Ralph Vaughan Williams might<br/>set,<br/>&gt; is a welcome reminder of this point for those of us often enamoured<br/>of<br/>&gt; polyphony and counterpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next piece, &quot;2001: A MOS Odyssey&quot; is subtitlted &quot;One of Jacky<br/>&gt; Ligon&apos;s scales,&quot; and the music seems nicely to fit the title, with a<br/>&gt; bit of _Switched-on Bach_ feeling. Since Wendy Carlos was producing<br/>&gt; the original _Switched on Bach_ around the same epoch that produced<br/>&gt; the movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_, this association was a pleasant<br/>&gt; one. Carlos herself has become an advocate through music as well as<br/>&gt; words of the movement to liberate not only synthesized sound, but<br/>the<br/>&gt; tuning systems in which it can operate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The third piece, an excursion in David Canfield&apos;s 13-limit tuning<br/>with<br/>&gt; 12 notes, brought various images and associations: a snatch of<br/>&gt; pentatonic, maybe a bit of Schoenberg, and then a wonderful melody<br/>&gt; which seemed to me either &quot;raga-like&quot; or &quot;Arabic.&quot; Robert shows that<br/>&gt; &quot;JI&quot; music can mean many things, with the structure of the scale<br/>&gt; itself as a starting point rather than a definition of style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we come to something really exquisite, an improvisation or<br/>&gt; improvisation-like piece in a Chopi scale which sounded to me as if<br/>it<br/>&gt; could have been taken from a recording of a traditional<br/>performance --<br/>&gt; in my view, the highest compliment. There are beautiful fifths and<br/>&gt; fourths, with a xylophone-like timbre: this is world-class music,<br/>&gt; which makes me intensely interested in the Chopi tradition. I hope<br/>&gt; that this piece will take an honored place in our global village,<br/>&gt; serving as a bridge of understanding and encouraging a greater<br/>&gt; awareness in our xenharmonic community and elsewhere of the<br/>pluralism<br/>&gt; of world musics and the need to appreciate and cherish this variety.<br/>&gt; Here Robert&apos;s Web site includes some links to lots of information<br/>about<br/>&gt; the Chopi people of Southern Mozambique and their music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next piece is a delightful journey from medieval to Baroque, at<br/>&gt; least as I hear it, in Dan Stearn&apos;s diatonic scale in 20-EDO. Here<br/>we<br/>&gt; can savor the ability of a strikingly &quot;new&quot; tuning to evoke some<br/>&gt; European history -- not its only ability, as Dan Stearn reminds us<br/>in<br/>&gt; observing that 20-EDO also contains within itself 5-EDO, a rough<br/>&gt; approximation of the slendro scale of gamelan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A piece in Graham Breed&apos;s blues scale has lots of delicious fifths<br/>and<br/>&gt; fourths, and a pentatonic feeling -- a kind of music that catches my<br/>&gt; ear both on this CD, and also in live performances such as one at a<br/>&gt; bookstore I was browsing at maybe a couple of years ago. The<br/>ensemble<br/>&gt; there was playing some kind of jazz or the like, which I rather<br/>&gt; passively accepted as &quot;background&quot; -- but when they started playing<br/>&gt; those fifths and fourths, I took enrapt notice. Robert&apos;s piece,<br/>also,<br/>&gt; deserves this kind of notice: I&apos;m not sure that Graham Breed&apos;s music<br/>&gt; in the same scale would sound anything like this, and that&apos;s the<br/>point<br/>&gt; of having not only many scales, but many musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The eighth piece is another exquisite improvisation in the Chopi<br/>&gt; scale, one happily extended as a traditional musicmaking session<br/>might<br/>&gt; be. Some of the figures are a bit like Chinese music, or the music<br/>of<br/>&gt; Southeast Asia I often listened to about 30 years ago. Such a piece<br/>&gt; suggests to me an ongoing project: to produce CD&apos;s or other<br/>recordings<br/>&gt; showcasing both traditional world musics and some music using<br/>&gt; nontraditional sound generation to arrive at similar scales and<br/>&gt; styles. Maybe &quot;Xenharmonics Old and New&quot; could be one theme, if<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; the right statement: intonational diversity is a global reality, and<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a need to honor its many traditions, which have themselves<br/>&gt; evolved and maintained their integrity despite sometimes most<br/>daunting<br/>&gt; crises both for the traditions and the cultures which have created<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ninth piece, &quot;Octany Lullaby,&quot; is a bit like a music box, maybe<br/>a<br/>&gt; curious metaphor for the Combination Product Set (CPS) of Erv<br/>Wilson;<br/>&gt; my notes say: &quot;Kind of like 18th-19th century, but different.&quot; What<br/>I<br/>&gt; heard as an allusion to the Classic-Romantic eras in Europe isn&apos;t<br/>the<br/>&gt; only item on this agenda, however: I also heard what sounded like a<br/>&gt; 6:8:9 sonority, common in many world musics ranging from Georgia and<br/>&gt; medieval France to Malaysia (which might be described in one way as<br/>&gt; the fifth and fourth above the lowest note).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tenth, &quot;Twilight Bells,&quot; has a different mood which I described<br/>in<br/>&gt; my notes as &quot;Setharean,&quot; recalling the customized timbres of William<br/>&gt; Sethares often tailored to a specific scale, or vice versa; the<br/>timbre<br/>&gt; is realized in a piece with neat rhythms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The eleventh, &quot;Andante in Quarter-Comma Meantone,&quot; uses a tuning I<br/>&gt; often favor for 16th-century European styles in a somewhat later<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of genre, &quot;rather like Bach or Scarlatti?&quot; according to my notes,<br/>when<br/>&gt; meantone was still the norm for much organ music, for example. Like<br/>&gt; much Baroque music, the texture is filled with active melodic<br/>themes,<br/>&gt; and this electronic rendition includes some neat &quot;winds&quot; in its<br/>&gt; virtual ensemble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next four items (12-15) are the four movements of a &quot;7-tet trio&quot;<br/>&gt; (or 7-EDO, in the Monzian style). The opening portion includes some<br/>&gt; fifths, and pleasant stringlike timbres with a &quot;fiddle&quot; sound, and<br/>&gt; what I describe in my notes as a &quot;glissando kind effect almost.&quot;<br/>&gt; The music builds to what I noted as &quot;more discrete patterns,&quot; with<br/>an<br/>&gt; engaging rhythmic counterpoint in the final movement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 16, &quot;17-tet hurdy-gurdy player,&quot; is gorgeous in its somewhat<br/>&gt; pentatonic style; while the CD includes only part of the piece<br/>because<br/>&gt; of a technical complication, that was enough to let me know that<br/>this<br/>&gt; masterpiece and the Chopi scale pieces are my favorites. Again, as<br/>an<br/>&gt; enthusiastic for 17-tET/EDO and unequal 17-note well-temperaments or<br/>&gt; &quot;circles&quot; of various kinds, I am delighted to hear Robert making the<br/>&gt; most vigorous advocacy possible: music that says it all, in a way<br/>that<br/>&gt; reflects his special musicianship and imagination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 17, an improvisation in 13-tET/EDO with diminished sevenths, is<br/>&gt; quite different -- but maybe, like some other pieces on this CD, a<br/>bit<br/>&gt; Baroque -- or could it be Near-Eastern? This is another side to<br/>&gt; 13-EDO, which along with the music of xenharmonicists such as<br/>William<br/>&gt; Sethares shows the musical beauty to be found in this often<br/>&gt; undervalued and too often unknown tuning. As someone who has<br/>&gt; improvised neo-Gothic music in this same scale, I can say from the<br/>&gt; experience both of playing and of listening to Robert&apos;s piece that<br/>&gt; these scales open the way to creativity, inviting odysseys that may<br/>&gt; take divergent paths each lending its own allure to a system such as<br/>&gt; 13-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 18, in &quot;Jacky Ligon&apos;s golden meantone non-octave scale,&quot;<br/>sounded<br/>&gt; &quot;Bluesy&quot; to me, with some percussion. There&apos;s been a great deal of<br/>&gt; interest in nonoctave (or sometimes stretched/compressed octave)<br/>&gt; scales in our tuning forums, and also in Jacky Ligon&apos;s electronic<br/>&gt; journal TMA available on the Internet; Robert shows that such scales<br/>&gt; can be used for music at once not too unfamiliar, and yet new. I&apos;d<br/>be<br/>&gt; ver interested to hear what he might come up with in something like<br/>&gt; the Bohlen-Pierce scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 19 lives up to its name, &quot;Jacob Van Eyck&apos;s Boffons with zany<br/>&gt; percussion arrangement.&quot; This has a catchingly jazzy flavor, and<br/>&gt; indeed is a 21st-century reprise of a kind of 17th-century<br/>Netherlands<br/>&gt; jazz (if I have my chronology of Van Eyck right): theme and<br/>&gt; variations, an artform also expressed in much Spanish and English<br/>&gt; music, for example, of the 16th and early 17th centuries. This could<br/>&gt; be a Carlos album, _Switched-On Van Eyck_, and although this era is<br/>a<br/>&gt; bit &quot;modern&quot; for me &lt;grin&gt;, I delight in the &quot;modernism&quot; of<br/>Monteverdi<br/>&gt; and Frescobaldi, and would love to hear more of this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 20, &quot;Golden ratio &apos;cello fractal tune&quot; is slightly truncated,<br/>but<br/>&gt; the portion on the CD includes an engaging string-like timbre and a<br/>&gt; musical moment which seemed a bit &quot;Japanese&quot; to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 21, &quot;Improvisation in Werckmeister III,&quot; has fifths and fourths<br/>&gt; in what I described in my notes as a &quot;multicultural&quot; style,<br/>reminding<br/>&gt; us again that an 18th-century European tuning isn&apos;t limited to<br/>&gt; 18th-century European styles. The many pure fifths of Werckmeister<br/>III<br/>&gt; make it, in my view, from one perspective a partly &quot;just&quot; tuning<br/>&gt; despite its place also as representing the essence of temperament in<br/>&gt; one historical manifestation, and I&apos;d like to hear more global<br/>&gt; excursions of this kind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 22, &quot;African-style complex rhythms,&quot; is a study in percussion,<br/>&gt; focusing on meter as the opening piece focuses on melody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Item 23, &quot;Atmospheric polyrhythms,&quot; came with a very thoughtful<br/>&gt; advisory from Robert, taking note of my sensitivity to loud sounds:<br/>he<br/>&gt; cautioned me that this has some high volume levels. Accordingly,<br/>&gt; following the rules of audio safety, I turned my amplifier to the<br/>&gt; lowest volume for this piece -- avoiding any problem, and finding<br/>that<br/>&gt; he had offered lots of sounds and patterns. Others might want to<br/>&gt; adjust the volume to taste with due caution; I&apos;d add that there are<br/>&gt; some great pieces of William Sethares, also, where percussive<br/>timbres<br/>&gt; made me a bit cautious about volume.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, Robert, you&apos;ve shown that our community has already produced<br/>&gt; some fine music deserving notice as music, however interested or<br/>&gt; otherwise people may be in the fine details of &quot;microtonality&quot; --<br/>and<br/>&gt; reminded us that many cultures have been doing so for uncounted<br/>ages.<br/>&gt; Thank you for this special gift, which has also given me the<br/>&gt; opportunity better to appreciate what you&apos;ve made available on this<br/>&gt; forum and elsewhere via the Internet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively, in peace and love,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
