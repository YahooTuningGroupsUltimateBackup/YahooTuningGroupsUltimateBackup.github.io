I posted a<br/>message a while ago about this:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_14872.html#14889">/makemicromusic/topicId_14872.html#14889</a></p><p>Most of the composers treated 17 in a way that I had difficulty<br/>understanding (and in ways very different than I would have done), so<br/>I felt that I ought to be charitable and give them the benefit of the<br/>doubt.  (Margo Schulter is clearly an exception; I immediately<br/>understood and liked her composition, since she had discussed her neo-<br/>medieval approach with me several years before.)</p><p>I admit that 17 is not an easy division to write for.  It took me 15<br/>years to figure it out, another 23 years to write about it, and<br/>another 5 years for that to be published.  I think you&apos;ve seen the<br/>paper, but for those who haven&apos;t, here&apos;s the link:<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a><br/>AFAIK, with the exception of Margo, none of the 17-tone composers had<br/>seen this paper till after I mentioned it in the above posting, so it<br/>was not too surprising that it didn&apos;t seem to me that any of them had<br/>used 17 in any of the ways that I wrote about in the paper.</p><p>In that paper I made the point that 17 is much better for melody than<br/>any meantone-class temperament.  (Consonant harmony, of course, is a<br/>challenge, but it&apos;s possible.)  I also made the point that 17 is more<br/>economical than most other circulating non-12 tunings, and certainly<br/>more economical than any with a decent fifth.</p><p>Since you said that 17 doesn&apos;t sound good, no matter what you do to<br/>it, let me offer several examples to the contrary.</p><p>After reading my paper, Hudson Lacerda did a very nice improvisation<br/>that drew a response from you that indicated a possible change in<br/>your opinion of 17:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_14872.html#14993">/makemicromusic/topicId_14872.html#14993</a><br/>Unfortunately, the sound file is no longer available, so I hope you<br/>remember what you heard.  (I do have the file, impro.ogg, and I could<br/>send it to you off-list, if you like.)</p><p>Margo has many neo-medieval compositions (in 17) that show how well<br/>suited that division is for that style of writing.
