I&apos;m estimating that it will at least get us past the current bind, and that was my main intent - I need a (another) full-time website to host (other than Corporeal Meadows) like a hole in the head! More below...</p><p>&gt;On Monday, <a href="http://microtonal.co.uk">microtonal.co.uk</a> should be moving to hosting4less.

What I would suggest is to let me run with this original option and we&apos;ll see if we need to spread out more. I think that, above all else, it should be as close to &quot;one stop shopping&quot; as possible, because the more confusion about where things lie the worse it will be. And again, more below...</p><p>&gt;I can definitely get a majordomo mailing list at <a href="http://microtonal.co.uk">microtonal.co.uk</a>.  They &gt;say very little about the standard mailing list option, but it might have &gt;a web front end.  Then again, it might only be a distribution list.  I&apos;ll &gt;look into this sometime, once the rest of the move is finished and I&apos;ve &gt;written some nice CGI scripts and maybe even some music.</p><p>Do the latter - we have millions of programmers and fewer (by far) microtonal musicians! I know that I can install cgi scripts, but it will just have to wait until the spring. I don&apos;t want to start up a new mailing list until/unless we *really* have to. And I have already had an offer, through the Meadows, of someone with a long history in running online forums to host one for me, so if we were to end up going that way, it can be done. I tend to think that most people prefer the mail direction, as it can come to you rather than you going to it.</p><p>&gt;Have you checked the list of hosts-that-might-work-with-mailing-lists that &gt;I posted before?</p><p>I must be honest: this was almost an impulse move! I have gotten sick of trying to resolve the file problems with Yahoo, and while I didn&apos;t want to through lots of cash at the situation I wanted something to happen that wasn&apos;t a huge committee-like solution. When I read the reviews of these low (almost free!) cost services, I figured at worst it was a beginning to better days.</p><p>But I&apos;ve been wrong before! :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2002 6:13:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

I had no idea it had been registered before, especially since there wasn&apos;t a site. I simply started doing a search of the global &apos;whois&apos; database (which is how you find if a name is registered) on the simplest terms - i.e. if you had to type it out, how simple can it be and be relevant.</p><p>2. As 1. above states, I didn&apos;t appropriate it, it was unused. I simply registered a domain that was open to all, and if I had seen a website using it before I probably would have asked if they meant to keep it active.</p><p>&gt;Jon, Johnny wishes you the best with it.
