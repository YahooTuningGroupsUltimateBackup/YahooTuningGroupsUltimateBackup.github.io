Also there are Kathleen Schlesinger&apos;s harmoniai, so I&apos;d try several candidate tunings on a synth or scala first.</p><p>There is also the Tanbur of Baghdad in Ellis&apos;s appendices to Helmholtz, whose fingerboard is divided into 40 parts and the strings tuned an 8/7 apart.</p><p>--john</p></div>
