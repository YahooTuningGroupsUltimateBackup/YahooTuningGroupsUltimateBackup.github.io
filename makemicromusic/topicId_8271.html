Welcome to the forum.</p><p>In the interest of helping you get some microtonal stuff up (so you<br/>can show these folks what you can do), allow me to offer some tips to<br/>uploading music:</p><p>Tip #1: you need a site to upload to.  I would suggest<br/><a href="http://soundclick.com">soundclick.com</a>, <a href="http://audiostreet.net">audiostreet.net</a>, or <a href="http://musicianmp3.com">musicianmp3.com</a> (in order of my<br/>personal preference).  All of these are free.</p><p>Tip #2: have your audio files in the correct format.  All the sites I<br/>listed accept mp3&apos;s compressed at 128kbps (the default).  Make sure<br/>whatever program you are using to get your music onto your computer<br/>(iTunes or MediaPlayer, etc.) is ripping the tracks as these kind of<br/>mp3&apos;s.</p><p>Tip #3: once you have your songs ripped and a site set-up, just<br/>follow the directions on your website to upload the tunes.  If you<br/>use soundclick, just go into the mp3 edit area, click &quot;add new song&quot;<br/>and then click the &quot;browse...&quot; button to select the song on your<br/>computer that you wish to upload.</p><p>Tip #4: well, this isn&apos;t really a tip, more of a suggestion:<br/>upload &quot;Hair Eaters&quot; first.  I think people here will really dig that<br/>one.</p><p>Happy uploading!</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>P.S. (there is always a P.S.): This is the place to ask about making<br/>MIDI controllers...and did I mention I have an idea for a good 22-tet<br/>keyboard design?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;codroid&quot; &lt;codroid@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hallo, peoples with ears!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My name is Stevie, and I am a 20 year old musician.
