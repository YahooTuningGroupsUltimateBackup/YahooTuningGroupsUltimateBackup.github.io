Play in &quot;Delusion&quot;? How could one forget *that*?! As a sidelight, the recording sessions for Columbia (CBS) followed immediately on the heels of the production (the only one ever), and if actual details are desired of the sessions I&apos;ll just go ask Danlee - he was musical director for the entire project.</p><p>&gt;It seems to me this recording is a &quot;reissue&quot; of the &quot;big&quot; Columbia &gt;Masterworks issue.  Was that the big recording that &quot;put Partch on the &gt;map&quot; so to speak?</p><p>Yes, sort of. &quot;The World of Harry Partch&quot; preceded it, and had gained notoriety, but &quot;Delusion&quot; caused the biggest press splash because it got picked up in hi-fi/stereo publications, and also that the piece was done at the height of some of our most colorful cultural times, known to some as the &apos;hippy&apos; era. It *is* a reissue, something I had fought for for a long time (through the Partch Foundation) and wasn&apos;t easy to make happen!</p><p>&gt;But what happened to the copyright on the recording?  Why did Columbia not &gt;keep it (economics?) and how did the American Composers Forum get it?</p><p>Of the entire Partch recording legacy, the *only* two master tapes he did *not* have control of were the two Columbia recordings. They retained contractual rights, which passed to Sony when the latter purchased CBS and all their recordings.</p><p>&gt;Additionally, how did the American Composers Forum get Sony to release &gt;this, and, why not their *own* label?</p><p>The only way Sony would even agree to release it was on their &apos;special&apos; line, in &apos;conjunction&apos; with Innova (the ACF label). And it cost money to get them to release it. They did *not* do it out of the kindness of their corporate hearts, and even less so with any concern to having let one of the masterworks of the 20th century lay fallow (out-of-print) for over 20 years!</p><p>&gt;(My guess is again, as usual, economics... they probably convinced Sony &gt;into distributing this since they probably though it could be a &quot;big &gt;seller&quot; which it probably is...)</p><p>No, it just took endless discussions to convince Sony it was even worth their bother! They didn&apos;t, and don&apos;t, have a clue to its value, and I doubt it is a &quot;big seller&quot;. They also, in spite of being a corporate giant with big pocketbooks, managed to squeeze everything out of it they could. How do I know? Because I did some of the digital editing, in collaboration with one of Sony&apos;s engineers in New York, to correct some of the problems of the original issue!</p><p>&gt;And my impressions of the *music??*  Well, it&apos;s tremendous, of course, but &gt;I would like to listen a few more times before more specific comments.</p><p>I know you&apos;ve discussed your less interest in &apos;dramatic&apos; music and more interest in &apos;abstract&apos; or instrumental music, I can&apos;t imagine you could find a finer example of this then the opening 10 minute &quot;Exordium&quot;. Functional as a semi-overture, it is exactly the sweeping harmonies of the Harmonic Canons near the beginning of this piece that I was thinking of, in light of the opening sections of Blect. Some day, some day...</p><p>And, by the way, being a part of that original &quot;Delusion&quot; production didn&apos;t mean that Partch necessarily rubbed off on the participants. Many of the &apos;players&apos; went back into very straight music making after that, never again to be corporeal entities.

And, I never *knew* it, so &gt;it was easy to forget... :)</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that Delusion, being the largest ensemble he wrote for, contained a fair number of player for which Delusion was the *only* Partch experience. *Some* of the ensemble of that time were also on the &quot;World of&quot; recording, which came out of a concert at the Whitney, but that entire group was only with Harry for about 4 years or so on an infrequent basis.

Yes, the &gt;opening of _Blect_ surely does pale by comparision.</p><p>Oh, Joe, I didn&apos;t mean that *at all*! I wasn&apos;t comparing your piece, especially in a negative light. What I meant referred to the use of common-tone bridges in chord progressions, which I believe occurs in Blect in the organ, and certainly was some of your Bj progressions that you posted earlier. One of the very coolest things on Partch&apos;s last canons was dual courses of strings, where one course will keep a constant pitch, and the other course has a ramp and a glass slide underneath the strings, so you can change pitch on half the strings. This is how he can swing back and forth between two harmonies with a common tone, and is one of (what I consider) one of his hallmark sounds. The other place where this happens is in &quot;Dreamer That Remains&quot;, and also a beautiful section in the last version of &quot;U.S. Highball&quot;.</p><p>So no disparagement intended on the organ stuff, only that those kind of harmonic common-tone ideas can also have correlations in instrumental resources, which I&apos;m sure your ear will lead you to discover over time.</p><p>Yours stands on its own quite well, thank you!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2117 href="#2117">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2002 12:49:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
