Sometimes the timbres come before the<br/>&gt; scale, depending upon what I&apos;m trying to achieve. If<br/>&gt; I wish to create a scale based on the spectra of a<br/>&gt; set of the chosen timbres, I may do an FFT analysis<br/>&gt; to try to discover what may be a good pitch set for<br/>&gt; the timbres.</p><p>Interesting (about whether you choose the scales or<br/>timbres first). Some undoubtedly stupid questions, if<br/>you would oblige:<br/>&#x9;1 - What do you mean by the spectrum of a timbre? Are<br/>you referring to the overtones present? Or wre you<br/>referring to something more?<br/>&#x9;2 - I&apos;m not sure what you mean about the FFT. From my<br/>understanding of it, if you designed the timbre,<br/>wouldn&apos;t you already know everything the FFT would<br/>give you? Are you making timbres out of samples or<br/>something?</p><p>&gt; The above piano example is an important one. What<br/>&gt; may sound good, or bad on one single timbre, may<br/>&gt; sound like gold, or horrible when transposed onto a<br/>&gt; mixed set of timbres. Things get really interesting<br/>&gt; when one begins to combine harmonic and inharmonic<br/>&gt; timbres.</p><p>(little light bulb turns on). That makes a whole lot<br/>of sense. Thanks for pointing it out...</p><p>&gt; while abstract analysis of tunings may reveal some<br/>&gt; things of interest, it is when we play them, and<br/>&gt; transpose them onto complex musical situations,<br/>&gt; where spatial, timbral and rhythmic interplay<br/>&gt; considerations come into play, that we find out what<br/>&gt; attributes any given tuning may have to offer.</p><p>Basing this solely on my view of the way I would like<br/>the world to be, and nothing more, I agree<br/>wholeheartedly ;-) Anyway thanks for the tips, and by<br/>the way, I just checked out your website, and you,<br/>sir, kick a whole lot of ass.</p><p>&gt; Good luck to you, and I hope you&apos;ll be sharing<br/>&gt; your music with us here.</p><p>Just as soon as I&apos;ve implemented non-sine wave timbres<br/>that don&apos;t sound like crap in the program I&apos;m using to<br/>play around with this stuff, and my new keyboard comes<br/>in, I will ;-)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Brian</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Send your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/><a href="http://greetings.yahoo.com">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
