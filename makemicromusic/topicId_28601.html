Why has there been such a drought of new instrumentsÂ—especially in rock and pop, which thrive on novelty?</p><p>Inventor Aaron Andrew Hunt blames it in part on the &quot;music industrial complex.&quot; He created the Tonal Plexus in 1996 and has since sold, by his count, &quot;not many.&quot; With 1,266 keys, the instrument is designed especially for microtonal composition, so it would be a tough sell at just about any time. But Hunt said the deck is particularly stacked against new instruments now that a standard repertoire has been locked in, as has the popular idea of what a proper instrument is.</p><p>&quot;The biggest barrier is the institutionalization of Western music and the mass marketing of all the instruments,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem is that no one can break though this marketing barrier and this education barrier because it&apos;s become this machine.&quot;</p><p>Read the whole thing...</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
