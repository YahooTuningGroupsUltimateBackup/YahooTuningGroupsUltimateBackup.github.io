It&apos;s fixed in the latest 0.2.1 zipfile at<br/><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rationale">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rationale</a></p><p>I&apos;ve been trying to set up executables for Mac and Windows, so users won&apos;t have to separately install the dependencies, and it&apos;s a PITA so far... it don&apos;t work so good!
