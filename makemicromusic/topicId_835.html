For example, we quoted from</p><p>Chesnut, John Hind. 1977.<br/>&quot;Mozart&apos;s teaching of intonation&quot;,<br/>Journal of the American Musicological Society<br/>vol. 30 no. 2 [summer], pp. 254-271.</p><p>&quot;Leopold Mozart refers to Tosi in general terms as an authoritative<br/>source in a letter to Wolfgang from Salzburg dated June 11, 1778.<br/>Tosi, in 1723, considered the correct tuning system to be what we<br/>would today call a form of regular meantone temperament ... according<br/>to Tosi, the large diatonic half step is theoretically equal to five<br/>ninths of a whole step, and the small chromatic half step is<br/>theoretically four-ninths of a whole step. Tosi thereby divides the<br/>octave into fifty-five equal parts. This is equivalent to tempering<br/>the perfect fifth by approximately one-sixth of a &apos;comma,&apos; ...<br/>Leopold Mozart, in his violin method of 1756 -- which happens to be<br/>the year of Wolfgang&apos;s birth -- also describes what we have<br/>called &apos;extended regular meantone temperament&apos; as the correct<br/>intonation for the violin; he tells us that keyboard instruments of<br/>his time were played with some form of tempered [i.e., well-tempered]<br/>tuning, but that in the &quot;right ratio&quot; [i.e., meantone] tuning that he<br/>recommends for the violin, flats are higher by a comma than<br/>enharmonically equivalent sharps. It can be shown that for whichever<br/>of the standard commas we choose, the perfect fifths in Leopold<br/>Mozart&apos;s system were theoretically flattened by about one-sixth of<br/>that comma . . . Leopold Mozart wrote down a couple of scales<br/>specifically intended for practice in intonation, one leading through<br/>the flats, the other through the sharps. In practicing these scales,<br/>the student is supposed to learn to distinguish between the large<br/>diatonic half steps and the small chromatic half steps. It is<br/>important to emphasize that these scales are not abstractions but<br/>exercises to be mastered . . . &quot;</p><p>It is for this correspondence with a flavor of meantone temperament<br/>that 55-tET was advocated by Telemann, etc. etc.</p><p>Anyway, back to making microtonal music.</p></div><h3><a id=952 href="#952">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2001 6:53:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Thanks for the comments.</p><p>This is what I&apos;m planning to say now:</p><p>55-tet twelve tone scale is a close approximation to sixth comma<br/>meantone.

This makes a twelve tone<br/>scale consisiting of two sizes of semitone, one of five, and one<br/>of four approximate syntonic commas. Leopold Mozart (Wolfgang Mozart&apos;s<br/>father) was in favour of this system and wrote a couple of scales to be used<br/>as excerices for it.

Going up two octaves<br/>is 110 steps. So the difference between the two is 18 steps, which<br/>is the same as the major third of 55-tet.</p><p>So, if one were improvising in 55-tet, then one no longer has a syntonic<br/>comma to worry about!</p><p>Interesting...</p><p>I&apos;ve just tried it out in the 55-tone major - one can go up four<br/>fifths from the 1/1, all of them identical in size (698.18 cents),<br/>and one gets to the 55-tet major third at 392.73 cents.</p><p>It sounds quite interesting actually, going up four sligthly<br/>unstable fifths, then dropping down a major third that is<br/>relatively pure compared to the ones we are used to hearing<br/>in 12-et, as a kind of resolution. Could be the beginnings<br/>of a piece.</p><p>So what happens to the other major third in the circle of fifths<br/>- the one that crosses the break in the circle? (down 8 fifths)</p><p>Say, F# to Bb. One gets a sharper third at 414.55 cents.</p><p>While in PYthagorean, the one going up four fifths is the one<br/>that&apos;s sharp at 81/64 = 407.82, and the one going down 8 fifths is flatter,<br/>and near to the just intonation 5/4 at 8192/6561 = 384.36 cents.</p><p>This is relevant to actual making of microtonal music by the way<br/>as I&apos;m thinking about an idea for a piece in 55-tet or an improvisation<br/>- I&apos;ve just posted a thought about it to crazy_music.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
