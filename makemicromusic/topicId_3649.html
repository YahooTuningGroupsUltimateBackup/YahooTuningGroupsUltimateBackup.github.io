It lets you re-partition the hard disk in many cases without even re-booting - it<br/>usually works within Windows. You could just continue working and let it re-partition in the background as you do so though that<br/>would be risky in case another program caused a crash - so I prefer to leave it to do its thing and go away and come back when it is<br/>finished. Never had any problems with it. You can also cancel when it is in the middle of re-partitioning. Sometimes it needs a<br/>re-boot for some types of changes.</p><p>I do always back up just before re-partitioning though - because if you got a power cut in the middle of it you could end up with an<br/>unusable hard disk and need to re-format. Not sure if that would happen with Partition Magic.</p><p>I used another program before then however, and it was awful, because it actually messed up the partition with my Windows OS on it,<br/>with no way to recover from it that I could find, so that I had to re-format it and re-install windows. So one surely has to take<br/>care with it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3658 href="#3658">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2002 5:09:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>In Windows a good tip is to have a separate partition for the swap file.</p><p>Partition magic doesn&apos;t erase anything and in normal use you don&apos;t need<br/>to re-install windows or put your files back onto the disk or anything<br/>like that which is quite useful at times.</p><p>However as Jeff has recommended, of course you must back up anything of<br/>any importance before re-partitioning - which one should be doing anyway<br/>as a regular thing.</p><p>If you get a power cut or the fuse goes in your plug or something mid<br/>partitioning, then I expect you would need to re-format your hard disk and<br/>re-install as what it is doing is pretty low level. But you don&apos;t<br/>need to do that in normal use so it is quite a time saver if one<br/>is planning to re-partition anyway.</p><p>Don&apos;t know if anyone here is planning to do this on Windows.<br/>It can help to improve perforamance - especially the<br/>matter of having a separate partition for the swap file.<br/>That means that your swap file can never get fragmented<br/>as it always has a partition to itself and so as much<br/>consecutive free space as desired.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
