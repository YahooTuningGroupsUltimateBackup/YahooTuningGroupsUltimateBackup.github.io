(I wish I knew if that was a NY-ism, or just a TV-ism as attributed to NY) I&apos;ve personally enjoyed Kyle&apos;s perspective on music, put forward with formidable chops both in compositional expertise and literary acumen; I&apos;d recommend his book &quot;American Music in the Twentieth Century&quot; (at <a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a> = <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2emob">http://tinyurl.com/2emob</a> )</p><p>As for &quot;under-explored worthy corners&quot;, I just finished watching &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, and was struck by one moment in the scoring (the film is done with all pop music - and I won&apos;t insult anyone by trying to nail it any more than pop-electronic styles). At one point Charlotte goes to a park, where she comes upon and wedding procession, and continues walking, ending in a place where slips of paper (prayers? wishes?) are tied on branches. All through this scene is a deceptively simple &apos;song&apos;, but while it isn&apos;t microtonal, there is a very, very definite fuzz added to the sound by the fact that most of the synth stuff is out of tune.</p><p>By that, I mean that it sound like the good old days of drifting oscillators on analog equipment, and it becomes a sonic analog (if you will) for the soft focus of some of the shots in the scene. It isn&apos;t someone purposely playing in 59tet, but it renders such a differing mood that the &apos;tuning&apos; becomes an important part of the sound field.</p><p>FWIW.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
