It will support<br/>microtonal scales through tuning table downloads:<br/><a href="http://www.synthtech.com/new_stuff.html">http://www.synthtech.com/new_stuff.html</a>.  It has 16 bit accuracy.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of any others that can scale directly to support 19 equal.  You<br/>can always scale for equal temperament scales past the MIDI-CV converter by<br/>attenuating the CV signal, but you&apos;ll want to make sure the output of the<br/>scaling device is very low impedance (much less than 1 Kohm) to guarantee<br/>tracking across the full keyboard range.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com</a><br/>The Wavemakers Synthesizer Web Site<br/><a href="http://www.wavemakers-synth.com">http://www.wavemakers-synth.com</a></p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: fforbesuk [mailto:fforbesuk@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 19, 2003 6:16 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [MMM] Midi-Cv equ-tet conversion experience<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to enquire if anybody has knowledge about Midi-CV<br/>&gt; converters?<br/>&gt; Specifically the sampling bit-depth of various models available?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve just obtained an Arp Odyssey(why did i bother with all those<br/>&gt; years of digital synths?)and i&apos;m itching to hear it play 19-tet.<br/>&gt; Apart from diving into the innards and changing the current<br/>&gt; source for the keyboard resistor chain,i&apos;d like to drive the CV<br/>&gt; input from a Midi-CV convertor since i&apos;m not a keyboardist .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looking at the many models available there seems a recent<br/>&gt; trend among the 16-bit accurate convertors to derive their<br/>&gt; frequency by software which is predictably locked to 12-tet.<br/>&gt; The cheaper lower bit rate convertors are i suspect not ideal for<br/>&gt; shifting to many other equal-temp scales due to the less<br/>&gt; accurate settings one can achieve with their trimmer <a href="http://pots.In">pots.In</a> a lot<br/>&gt; of cases the bit depth isn&apos;t even advertised.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anybody used an older,trimmer set 16-bit convertor which i<br/>&gt; might find s/hand or on ebay?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I appreciate this is a midi technical question but i would suspect<br/>&gt; it wouldn&apos;t make much sense on a technical group.I take it there<br/>&gt; are some of you using analog synthesis in other equal-tets who<br/>&gt; might have fought around this little difficulty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
