The latter has .008&quot; key travel (if memory<br/>serves), while the former has .250&quot; key travel.  Starr won&apos;t<br/>say how his action works, but I strongly suspect it&apos;s piezoelectric.<br/>Horvath uses hall effect sensors that continuously measure key<br/>position to get really good (in principle) velocity numbers.  And<br/>one can set the trigger point anywhere along the keystroke, so<br/>that instead of being at the bottom-out point (like most MIDI<br/>keyboards) it could be at, say (like a piano) the 3/4-way point.<br/>I think both &apos;boards have replaceable keycaps.  Horvath&apos;s<br/>keyboard also uses torsion springs (instead of compression<br/>springs), so the breakaway force isn&apos;t much greater than the<br/>force required through the keystroke (as it is on most MIDI<br/>controllers out there).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;Alexmoog@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2005 12:18:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The prices mentioned previously, 7000$ and 4000$ are in Canadian dollars I hope?</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2005 10:43:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Alexandros Papadopoulos<br/>&lt;Alexmoog@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The prices mentioned previously, 7000$ and 4000$ are in Canadian<br/>&gt; dollars I hope?</p><p>***Hello Alexandros,</p><p>Yes, as mentioned in the email, these are Canadian $&apos;s, so it&apos;s a<br/>little less in the American...</p><p>We&apos;re still hoping for the $2,000 slot, but that, of course, depends<br/>upond 100 purchasers.</p><p>So far, there are no purchase numbers to support any of this, but<br/>hopefully this will change when the product is ready for production<br/>and advertised...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
