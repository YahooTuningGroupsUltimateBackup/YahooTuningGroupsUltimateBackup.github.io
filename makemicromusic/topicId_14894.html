Jim deeply understood something<br/>many<br/>of us have trouble with -- that there are things &quot;out there&quot; that<br/>deserve our serious attention. Music, ideas, beautiful work,<br/>friendship,<br/>even the fate of the human race and the current status of the<br/>cosmos --<br/>these things equally concerned and impassioned him. And when Jim<br/>gave<br/>something serious attention, he was, well, serious about it. He<br/>cared<br/>and thought deeply about what we always hope there will be time to<br/>care<br/>and think deeply about. He appeared to do that each day of his life,<br/>every hour of every day. This was his nature.<br/>2.<br/>In my opinion, Jim Tenney was the most important and brilliant<br/>composer/theorist of the second half of the twentieth century. I<br/>usually<br/>avoid statements like that: they&apos;re by definition fatuous, and it&apos;s<br/>not<br/>a competition. But for Jim I&apos;ll make an exception. After Cage, no<br/>other<br/>composer so elegantly and beautifully integrated ideas and music. No<br/>one<br/>else&apos;s work, as a whole, is as profound, experimental, wide-ranging,<br/>accomplished, or revolutionary.</p><p>Jim wrote more text than most people realize. Starting with Meta +<br/>Hodos<br/>and the computer music articles of the early 1960s; through his work<br/>on<br/>&quot;timbre,&quot; pitch, and other composers in the late 1960s and early<br/>1970s;<br/>his theoretical articles of the late 1970s (like the few but<br/>brilliant<br/>essays in Perspectives... and the Journal of Music Theory); and<br/>culminating with his wide-ranging work on pitch-space, intonation,<br/>and<br/>perception in the last 25 years, he left an almost immeasurably<br/>broad<br/>and important theoretical, aesthetic, intellectual and musical<br/>corpus.<br/>His writing is poorly acknowledged, not widely read, and almost<br/>completely misunderstood. In addition, it&apos;s mostly unavailable -- he<br/>intentionally placed much of it in small, non-academic publications.</p><p>His ideas delineate and explore the most important musical ideas of<br/>the<br/>past 50 years: form, perception, timbre, harmony, and the nature of<br/>the<br/>compositional process. When I teach courses in advanced musical<br/>theory,<br/>I sometimes have to force myself to use writings by other theorists -<br/>-<br/>not much other work seems quite as interesting, relevant or<br/>important as<br/>Jim&apos;s. He wrote and thought about elementals: form, pitch, cognition<br/>and<br/>perception (among other things).</p><p>He meant things in a way that few others do, and we should take a<br/>lesson<br/>from him in this. He cared little (in fact, not at all) for academic<br/>or<br/>intellectual fashion. He was singularly focused on getting it right.<br/>He<br/>wanted to know how the ear, the brain, and music worked (and might<br/>work). He was among the first (if not the first) theorist (and<br/>composer)<br/>to focus on ideas like the examination of deep musical processes<br/>irrespective of style, the use of cognition and perception as the<br/>basis<br/>for music theory, and a phenomenological understanding of our<br/>musical<br/>perception. His investigations began at a much deeper level than<br/>what<br/>passes for music theory (even today). I think we should revise our<br/>definition: whatever Jim Tenney did, and however he did it, is music<br/>theory.</p><p>Jim never advanced an idea until he was convinced he could win an<br/>argument about it with himself. His discussions were deep, brutal,<br/>and<br/>lengthy, with the most exacting person he could find (himself).<br/>Sometimes he checked in with a few others lucky enough to have<br/>earned a<br/>bit of his confidence, but by then it was unlikely that anyone else<br/>could help much. He did so much homework, and thought so hard, that<br/>there was rarely a new idea, technique, or avenue he hadn&apos;t already<br/>considered and probably discarded.</p><p>3.<br/>All his life, Jim taught. As a teacher, he avoided the remedial. He<br/>had<br/>little interest in, time (nor, I think, aptitude) for that kind of<br/>pedagogy. As a theorist and composer, he had things to say and<br/>investigate. He pursued ideas at a depth that was usually<br/>intimidating,<br/>often a bit scary, always exciting. His teaching sprang from these<br/>investigations, and he taught at a very high level, not some<br/>imagined<br/>least common denominator. Jim believed, and acted upon the<br/>assumption<br/>that the academy was a place of ideas, of search -- an intellectual<br/>and<br/>artistic eden where everyone was more or less like him!</p><p>Jim was a throwback: an artist and thinker whose love for teaching<br/>emanated directly and completely from a love for ideas. He was<br/>happiest<br/>when describing some new insight he&apos;d had about harmonic space,<br/>gestalt<br/>segregation, fundamental perception, the octave, Webern, cacti. His<br/>love<br/>of art, the world and ideas was unfettered. I&apos;ve encountered a very<br/>few<br/>people like that in my life, and one of the saddest things about his<br/>passing is that now there&apos;s one fewer.</p><p>4.<br/>I always suspected that some deranged gods had granted Jim the gift<br/>of<br/>eight extra clandestine hours a day to work, during which he calmly<br/>entered an alternate dimension, read twenty books and articles<br/>(maybe in<br/>Latin or German, languages he taught himself as he was doing<br/>research),<br/>filled up several of his ubiquitous graph-paper pads, and returned<br/>to<br/>the corporeal plane with what he needed.</p><p>5.<br/>Reverent of history, Jim enjoyed it immensely, and was in it. He<br/>taught<br/>(maybe &quot;taught&quot; is the wrong word: he inspired) his students to<br/>share<br/>his respect and fascination for so many traditions, and to consider<br/>them<br/>alive. He showed us that history was fluid, incomplete, not over:<br/>there<br/>was work to be done. Schoenberg, Ruggles, Partch, Satie, Var&egrave;se,<br/>Nancarrow, Cage, and Crawford Seeger (even, at various times in his<br/>life, Wagner!) were his colleagues.</p><p>Jim&apos;s immediate musical family consisted of composers of the past,<br/>present, and future. He understood, collaborated, and conversed with<br/>all<br/>at great length, built on their ideas the way a scientist does. He<br/>never, ever disrespected them. They dwelled in his musical house<br/>along<br/>with the rest of us. One learned from Jim how precisely and<br/>seriously to<br/>cherish other composers, and all other artists, because he was so<br/>careful, sincere, and active about it. He gave great credence to the<br/>making of art and the life of the idea -- everyone who at was at<br/>least<br/>nominally a fellow traveler got the benefit of the doubt, often more<br/>than we perhaps deserved.</p><p>6.<br/>In Meta + Hodos, and his later writings, Jim redesigned the<br/>architecture<br/>of twentieth century music theory. In the Bell Labs pieces (like<br/>Phases,<br/>Ergodos, Noise Study), he invented fundamental techniques for using<br/>computers as compositional tools (creating the idea of a<br/>compositional<br/>subroutine for synthesis environments). He freely moved<br/>between &quot;art&quot;<br/>and &quot;science,&quot; applying his engineering acuity and musical vision to<br/>some of the philosophical insights he gained from his close<br/>association<br/>with Cage (and Var&egrave;se).</p><p>He sought connections, and had no patience for arbitrary<br/>distinctions. I<br/>don&apos;t think it ever occurred to Jim that emotion, intellect,<br/>spirituality, science, harmony, creativity, knowledge, curiosity<br/>were<br/>all that different. Nor should they be parsimoniously doled out in<br/>support of some strategic artistic agenda. They were all part of<br/>being<br/>human, and an artist. His epiphanies often emerged as marriages of<br/>ideas, what he called &quot;bridges.&quot; He sought and found the profound<br/>connections between the work of Hiller, Partch, Cage, Var&egrave;se and<br/>others.<br/>He created new species from these breeding pairs -- not hybrids, but<br/>fertile new organisms that reproduced again and again, evolving with<br/>each generation.</p><p>Jim&apos;s ideas were startling in their originality and scope, but<br/>because<br/>they were great ideas, they had precursors. Each piece led and could<br/>be<br/>traced to other pieces, and always to some fundamental idea.<br/>Somewhere,<br/>somehow, Harry Partch led to Quintexts which led to Diapason and<br/>eventually to his final string quartet, Arbor Vitae (which the young<br/>composer Michael Winter helped him finish near the end of his life).</p><p>Jim was intensely curious, but not restless. He asked, &quot;What&apos;s<br/>next?&quot;<br/>not because he was bored, but because he was hard-wired for forward<br/>motion. He remained in perpetual morphogenesis (to borrow a term<br/>roughly<br/>meaning &quot;evolving and changing in shape,&quot; from one of his favorite<br/>writers, D&apos;Arcy Thompson) until the end. The morphogenesis of his<br/>ideas<br/>won&apos;t stop because he did: it will increase in strength like some<br/>kind<br/>of electro-magnetic resonance -- steadily and exponentially.</p><p>7.<br/>Over the years, one of my greatest pleasures was listening to Jim<br/>describe seemingly fantastic theoretical speculations, some a little<br/>too<br/>strange to talk about publicly, semi-cosmic ideas reserved for close<br/>friends, late at night. Yet even the wackiest of these (his word,<br/>not<br/>mine) seemed somehow believable. They were modulated by his<br/>intelligence<br/>and refined in the crucible of his impatience with &quot;just making<br/>stuff<br/>up!&quot; I always expect to pick up the New York Times Science section<br/>some<br/>Tuesday morning and read the headline: &quot;James Tenney&apos;s conjecture<br/>about<br/>the cosmos verified by experimental result!&quot;</p><p>8.<br/>The homes that Jim and Lauren Pratt made over the past 20 years --<br/>whether in New York City, California, Toronto, or Berlin -- were<br/>always<br/>full. They were places where art and ideas were welcome, there was<br/>no<br/>need for pretense, and there was all the time in the world.<br/>Careerism,<br/>gossip, gig-talk, pettiness and the like seemed inappropriate. His<br/>home<br/>was a haven for art -- a safe and necessary respite from the<br/>quotidian.<br/>Anyone and everyone was welcomed: his and Lauren&apos;s idea of the &quot;open<br/>house&quot; (in Toronto) was among the most brilliant ideas he was ever<br/>involved in.</p><p>He listened with a singular intensity, imbued personal relationships<br/>with deep gravity. You always felt that he considered you essential,<br/>somehow, to the well being of the planet. You walked in to his and<br/>Lauren&apos;s home, a beer appeared in your hand, and all of a sudden<br/>your<br/>life, at least for the next few hours, was really about music.</p><p>9.<br/>Like Cage, Partch, Var&egrave;se, Hiller, Harrison, Ruggles, and some of<br/>the<br/>other composers of his genus, Jim dealt with large ideas, systems of<br/>thought, &quot;embodiments of mind&quot; (a phrase from another of his<br/>favorite<br/>authors, Warren McCullough, whose work he was revisiting the last<br/>time I<br/>spoke to him). His writings provide the foundation for a remarkable<br/>edifice that we will spend a long time completing.</p><p>For me, though, much of the joy in remembering Jim emanates from<br/>small,<br/>often very practical notions, which seemed to arise almost<br/>incidentally,<br/>like wildflowers. These musical and theoretical &quot;volunteers&quot;<br/>delighted<br/>him as much as anything in his life, but he rarely talked about<br/>them,<br/>except among friends. I think he thought of this stuff as part and<br/>parcel of being a composer. When he&apos;d casually show you something<br/>like<br/>this, his tremendous glee in solving some &quot;smaller&quot; compositional or<br/>theoretical dilemma was evident. He&apos;d get a particular kind of grin<br/>on<br/>his face, like he&apos;d just solved a riddle rather than proved a<br/>theorem.</p><p>All of this is in the music, sometimes deeply embedded, sometimes<br/>immediately apparent. I remember the moment the compositional idea<br/>of<br/>Chorales for Orchestra clarified itself to me: the vertical was the<br/>horizontal; each was the primes of the harmonic series in a<br/>crypto-palindromic-Jim-homage to the music of Ives, Stravinsky and<br/>Ruggles -- and who knows what else!? Understanding Jim&apos;s techniques<br/>reduced you to a kind of dumb, teenage-inflected &quot;how cool is that?&quot;<br/>grin, wishing you&apos;d thought of it yourself.</p><p>He seldom published or formally described these intermediate<br/>compositional ideas. Nor were they premeditated: he created them as<br/>he<br/>went along; necessary pieces to some larger, cosmic-musical puzzle<br/>he<br/>was forever trying to solve. It was as if while busy inventing the<br/>wheel: at some point he realized he needed to come up with the idea<br/>of a<br/>spoke, but didn&apos;t think it important enough to mention! It reminded<br/>me<br/>of the way brilliant mathematicians sometimes invent entirely new<br/>branches of mathematics en route to solving a theorem. Jim<br/>contributed<br/>new concepts with nearly every piece.</p><p>These ideas give a sense of Jim&apos;s playfulness and deep commitment to<br/>compositional craft, something I think that is often overlooked when<br/>his<br/>work is discussed. I believe that craft was the most important thing<br/>to<br/>him, but his conception of it was unique. He loved music too much to<br/>exploit it, enslave it to his own ends. His mode of expression was<br/>not<br/>the liberation of himself but of other things -- ideas and sound --<br/>which he neither hamstrung to ordinary expectation, nor indentured<br/>to<br/>&quot;success.&quot;</p><p>In a world increasingly obsessed with the super-saturation of the<br/>immediate, Jim took a different approach. In the early 1960s he was<br/>close to the great experimental psychologist Roger Shepard, who<br/>pioneered a powerful technique called multi-dimensional scaling<br/>(MDS)<br/>which allows a set of complex multi-variable differences between<br/>even<br/>unrelated objects or concepts to be viewed in a simpler space, like<br/>the<br/>plane. An MDS plot of the way a group of listeners perceive<br/>differences<br/>between sonic events can illustrate what the most<br/>important &quot;dimensions<br/>of similarity&quot; might be. One of the most fascinating concepts<br/>associated<br/>with MDS is the idea of stress. If the mathematical reduction of the<br/>complexity of some perceptual space produces too great a stress, it<br/>means that the picture we&apos;re looking at isn&apos;t reliable, that there<br/>are<br/>too many important dimensions: the fit is very bad. In this case,<br/>the<br/>MDS algorithm automatically adds a dimension (from line to plane to<br/>3-space, etc.) so that the sets of differences will fit more<br/>comfortably, be more meaningful. Jim consciously integrated this<br/>idea<br/>into several pieces (like Changes), in which the prime<br/>dimensionality of<br/>harmonic space was increased when things got too &quot;ambiguous&quot; at the<br/>&quot;next lower dimension.&quot;</p><p>But I think this is a deeper metaphor for Jim&apos;s work. I often feel<br/>that<br/>more and more, composers (and regrettably the rest of society) have<br/>become like what mathematicians call fractals, functions which are<br/>extremely complicated, but in a low dimensionality. We have so much<br/>information readily at hand, things move so quickly, decisions are<br/>made<br/>with such immediacy, that depth, ambiguity, taking time to explore<br/>ideas<br/>is not generally tolerated, much less encouraged. Music is judged<br/>quickly, often after being heard just once! Jim&apos;s music inhabits a<br/>very<br/>different world. His ideas are of sufficient richness to be forced<br/>into<br/>higher dimensions, and require more complex perceptual and aesthetic<br/>geometries.</p><p>10.<br/>In recent years Jim&apos;s work received far more attention than it had<br/>over<br/>the previous thirty years. But this was not his goal. As a point of<br/>honor, a measure of integrity, he sought far less attention than he<br/>deserved. He made sure, though, that when someone did pay attention,<br/>they would be rewarded by what was heard. Maybe Jim thought that it<br/>was,<br/>in some literal way, good to leave the world in one&apos;s debt, and not<br/>vice<br/>versa. He did.</p><p>11.<br/>Many of our conversations over the years had little to do with<br/>music. In<br/>Toronto, late at night, Jim would pull out a graph-paper pad on<br/>which<br/>he&apos;d been working out some odd idea. One night, I think, he showed<br/>me a<br/>kind of universal theory of matter that he was considering. He was<br/>trying, in his own way, and by the sheer power of his own deduction<br/>and<br/>instinct, to explain &quot;everything,&quot; at least to himself. I remember<br/>nothing of the content of that graph-paper pad, but what I clearly<br/>recall was that somewhere near the end, he said to me, with great<br/>seriousness, that he&apos;d very much like to be remembered as<br/>a &quot;composer<br/>and amateur cosmologist.&quot; That is, in fact, how I remember him.</p><p>(Coda)<br/>A few days before Jim died, in the hours after which he finally lost<br/>consciousness, something odd happened at home here in New Hampshire,<br/>three thousand miles away.</p><p>Early that morning we came outside to find a Great Blue Heron<br/>perched on<br/>top of our red minivan. I stood with neighbors for nearly an hour,<br/>watching as the large bird made itself at home. The theory was that<br/>construction on a small bridge over the Mink Brook, just a few yards<br/>away from our house, had disturbed his nest.</p><p>When I learned the chronology of his final days from Lauren, I<br/>realized<br/>the coincidence and thought: &quot;That&apos;s just the kind of thing Jim<br/>would<br/>do!,&quot; and was glad that my old friend stopped in to say goodbye.</p><p>But maybe Jim didn&apos;t pull off that stunt entirely on his own.<br/>Perhaps<br/>the cosmos, being so firmly in his debt, was paying him back a<br/>little.</p></div><h3><a id=14895 href="#14895">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2006 11:08:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I know most people here are on the distribution list for Frog Peak, but just in case somebody missed this, I include it here:</p><p>I wrote Larry this morning when I received it to see if he minded a wider distribution.

Jim believed, and acted<br/>&gt; upon the<br/>&gt; assumption<br/>&gt; that the academy was a place of ideas, of search --<br/>&gt; an intellectual<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; artistic eden where everyone was more or less like<br/>&gt; him!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jim was a throwback: an artist and thinker whose<br/>&gt; love for teaching<br/>&gt; emanated directly and completely from a love for<br/>&gt; ideas. He was<br/>&gt; happiest<br/>&gt; when describing some new insight he&apos;d had about<br/>&gt; harmonic space,<br/>&gt; gestalt<br/>&gt; segregation, fundamental perception, the octave,<br/>&gt; Webern, cacti. His<br/>&gt; love<br/>&gt; of art, the world and ideas was unfettered.
