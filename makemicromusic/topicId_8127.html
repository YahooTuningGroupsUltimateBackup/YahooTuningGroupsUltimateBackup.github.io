Tonight at Walter Reade Theater in New York City I&apos;ll be<br/>receiving my ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for the station, along with Robin<br/>Cox of Iridian Radio. I told ASCAP that the station was Robin&apos;s idea and<br/>I stole it from him, and that he should get the award alone, but they<br/>split it between us. It confirms what I&apos;ve said all my life: you don&apos;t<br/>get the things you deserve, but you get other things you don&apos;t deserve<br/>instead, so it evens out. In college I got C&apos;s in the courses I deserved<br/>A&apos;s in, and A&apos;s when I deserved C&apos;s. Something similar keeps happening.<br/>My mother always called it Emerson&apos;s Law of Compensation.</p><p>posted by kgann @ Wednesday<br/>&quot;<br/>--</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p><p>Music that&apos;s &quot;Fake but Accurate&quot;!<br/>Web page: <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net</a><br/>Blog: <a href="http://www.xanga.com/music1024">http://www.xanga.com/music1024</a><br/>Podcast: <a href="http://podcast1024.blogspot.com">http://podcast1024.blogspot.com</a><br/>RSS: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024">http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024</a><br/>Music: <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers</a></p><p>--</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p><p>Music that&apos;s &quot;Fake but Accurate&quot;!<br/>Web page: <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net</a><br/>Blog: <a href="http://www.xanga.com/music1024">http://www.xanga.com/music1024</a><br/>Podcast: <a href="http://podcast1024.blogspot.com">http://podcast1024.blogspot.com</a><br/>RSS: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024">http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024</a><br/>Music: <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers</a></p></div><h3><a id=8129 href="#8129">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2004 10:08:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Prent Rodgers wrote:</p><p>&gt;I read in Kyle&apos;s weblog today &gt;(<a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/archives20041201.shtml#92255">http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/archives20041201.shtml#92255</a>) &gt;that ASCAP gave him an award for his<br/>&gt;PostClassic internet radio program, over at <a href="http://live360.com">live360.com</a>.

What I want is my deserved recognition.  Not be a part of<br/>any group handing out awards.  That&apos;s lame.  Music matters.<br/>Achievement matters.  Giving Kyle an award for Internet work, on a<br/>show that&apos;s been up for 3 broadcasts is a joke.

But again,<br/>giving an Internet award for 3 shows is a joke!  That&apos;s all I&apos;m<br/>saying.  You guys go on and pile it on for Kyle, if and when he ever<br/>comes back here I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll appreciate it.  Cool.  But let&apos;s get<br/>real here.  Take a step back from the brown nosing and look at an<br/>Internet award honestly.</p><p>Three shows doth not an ASCAP Internet award merit.

I said during my acceptance speech for the<br/>ASCAP award that I really didn&apos;t deserve it, and that the whole thing<br/>should have gone to Robin Cox, who started the first internet<br/>new-music station, whom I imitated, and who nevertheless only shared<br/>the award with me. Postclassic Radio<br/>(<a href="http://www.live365.com/stations/kylegann">http://www.live365.com/stations/kylegann</a>) has been running<br/>continuously since Sept. 4 - I don&apos;t know what this &quot;only 3<br/>broadcasts&quot; thing is about. I agree I haven&apos;t done anything very<br/>special, but I&apos;ve been getting a lot of good feedback, and have aired<br/>some microtonal music by Kraig Grady, Warren Burt, Prent Rogers, Neil<br/>Haverstick, and others. Every year ASCAP has plenty of great books and<br/>articles to choose from, but has a hell of a hard time finding<br/>television programs, as well as web sites for their relatively new<br/>internet award. They search around and choose something anyway,<br/>because they feel they should encourage whatever they can in each<br/>medium. (Kalvos and Damian won what I believe was the first internet<br/>award, which I recommended them for.) I&apos;ve told everyone who would<br/>listen that the internet awards are still currently chosen from a very<br/>small pool, and that it doesn&apos;t mean much. But I appreciate ASCAP&apos;s<br/>attempt to encourage whatever they can find, and don&apos;t see why anyone<br/>would charge them with cronyism for the award just because there<br/>aren&apos;t a lot of sites to choose from yet. They hope, by giving the<br/>award, to help change that. Fran Richard, who administrates the whole<br/>thing, is as idealistic and honorable a person as I know of in the<br/>music business.</p><p>While we&apos;re setting records straight, I once had a beer or two with<br/>Jeff Harrington, not the &quot;many a beer&quot; he quotes, and he&apos;s got a big<br/>pull-quote from me on the top of his page at<br/><a href="http://jeffharrington.org">http://jeffharrington.org</a>.
