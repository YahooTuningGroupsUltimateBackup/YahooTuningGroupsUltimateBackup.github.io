In keemun, you approach 7-limit chords from a<br/>kleismic<br/>&gt; point of view, when you stack six 6/5s to get a 3, and 5 6/5s to<br/>get a<br/>&gt; 5/2, you also stack 3 6/5s to get a 7/4 (which is also a 12/7 in<br/>this<br/>&gt; system.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pajara is Paul Erlich&apos;s favorite on 22-et, but it should sound a lot<br/>&gt; different in 34, with its improved octaves, and a sharp 7/4 of<br/>&gt; 988 cents. This amounts to using a dominant seventh chord as your<br/>&gt; 7-limit otonal tetrad, and while it is quite sharp, it isn&apos;t nearly<br/>as<br/>&gt; sharp as the 1000 cent 12-limit version. ...</p><p>The wide 4:7 of 988 cents sounds much better, IMO, than the 953-cent<br/>interval that occurs in 34-tone Keemun.  I would also note that 34&apos;s<br/>best approximations of 5:7, 6:7, and 7:9 are three good reasons for<br/>preferring its second-best 4:7 over its &apos;best&apos;.</p><p>Another nicety of 34 is that 4:5 is slightly wide, which I think most<br/>will prefer melodically to the narrow 4:5 of 22.
