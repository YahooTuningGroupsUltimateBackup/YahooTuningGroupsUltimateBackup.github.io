CONGRATS on<br/>taking the plunge into instrument building!  That&apos;s really<br/>adventurous...  I would consider Alison Monteith&apos;s tuning instrument<br/>recommendation very seriously, since I know she has had a lot of<br/>experience with these matters...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>Stan Hoffman &#x3C;stanhoffman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2003 6:25:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks everyone for your recommendations regarding tuners. Peterson has a<br/>new tuner--successor to the VS-1--called the VSAM. It extends the VS-1&apos;s<br/>capabilities in a number of ways, including allowing you to store (I<br/>believe) custom tunings. It also generates tones (A is for Audio) and has a<br/>metronome (M). The only trouble is it hasn&apos;t shipped yet. Due this month. I<br/>think I will wait and make due with my cheap old chromatic tuner and ear for<br/>the next few weeks.</p><p>Stan</p></div>
