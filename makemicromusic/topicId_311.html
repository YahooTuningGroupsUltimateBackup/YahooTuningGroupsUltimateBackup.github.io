Sometimes, another artists simply<br/>says something better than you ever can, or sometimes, it is interesting to<br/>use an old phrase in a new way. People do this in conversation all the<br/>time.

Mainly because you are<br/>right: the very people you are talking about probably have zero<br/>chance of being sampled in a major way. And, if you read a little bit<br/>of what they&apos;ve written, I think you&apos;ll find it is deeper than<br/>just &quot;ticked off&quot;, but that it means something to them and they&apos;ve<br/>thought about it.</p><p>&gt; What I am hearing is the reason that academia turns people<br/>&gt; off. &quot;It&apos;s my way or the highway&quot; stuff like that... how many times<br/>&gt; in history have we seen the stuffy professor proved wrong?</p><p>Or the young stud with the shiny new technology, only to find (ten<br/>years down the road) that they are... not cool anymore?</p><p>I don&apos;t think all sampling is wrong (which I think comes close to how<br/>Joe P feels); I also don&apos;t think that any and all sampling is OK<br/>(which sort of sounds like you). Both of those sound like highways to<br/>me, and I like back roads.</p><p>I think I&apos;m there with Dan: what is the context, how is it used, and<br/>how does the end-product change peoples lives?</p><p>&gt; Sure, sampling can be abused, but then again, so can ordinary<br/>&gt; musical conceits, like theory. Or technical ability. Or... well,<br/>&gt; you get the point.</p><p>Not really, because you&apos;re stretching the metaphor quite a lot. What<br/>I will agree on: all new things aren&apos;t automatically good, all old<br/>things aren&apos;t automatically bad, and all tools and techniques can be<br/>used both wisely and maliciously.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see the point of making music solely out of samples any<br/>&gt; more than I understand ignoring their use completely.</p><p>Bingo!
