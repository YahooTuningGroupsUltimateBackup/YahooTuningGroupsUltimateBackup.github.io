The 9:7 interval is particularly in-tune and<br/>particularly xenharmonic. You can hear a lot of this on the MAD DUXX<br/>CDs. The chord, since it&apos;s close to a harmonic series, sounds huge<br/>with distortion -- much better than the 12-tET equivalent -- and in<br/>fact quite similar to what Jon Catler does with the JI guitar.</p><p>On the 31-tET guitar, there&apos;s a bit of a dilemma. Using roughly<br/>conventional fingering, you get a &quot;diatonic&quot; 9th chord -- a bit more<br/>dissonant than 12-tET, but very compatible with conventional diatonic<br/>soloing. But there is also a &quot;harmonic&quot; 9th chord -- even closer to a<br/>harmonic series than the 22-tET version -- that is very difficult to<br/>finger -- and difficult to solo over.</p><p>Another example: The Jimi Hendrix chord (seventh with &quot;sharp 9&quot;)</p><p>On the 22-tET guitar, this chord sounds fantastic to me, since it<br/>approximates the JI chord 1/1 5/4 7/4 7/3, without being that<br/>different from 12-tET. Works really well with the native &quot;minor<br/>pentatonic&quot; scale of 22-tET.</p><p>On the 31-tET guitar, there is again a dilemma. If you play the<br/>chord &quot;diatonically&quot;, you get that extra-narrow diminshed second (77<br/>cents) between the major third and minor third -- rather dissonant,<br/>but quite compatible with conventional blues/diatonic thinking for<br/>soloing. But if you try to play the even-closer-than-22 approximation<br/>to 1/1 5/4 7/4 7/3, you&apos;ll have a hard time fingering it, and soloing<br/>over it is difficult too, because you have to negotiate the<br/>21:16 &quot;wolf&quot; (it&apos;s even a wolf melodically) between the 4/3 and the<br/>7/4.</p><p>Blues scales</p><p>On the 22-tET guitar, there are several interesting approaches to<br/>playing blues scales, some of which might not sound good to me on any<br/>given day, but great on another (never trust your ears unless you<br/>give them lots of time)! I&apos;ve discussed this a bit before so now I&apos;ll<br/>simply add that it&apos;s really fun, especially if the harmony is wide-<br/>open enough, to &quot;mutate&quot; between slightly different blues scales --<br/>kind of like side-slipping in 12-tET but much more subtle and<br/>hallucinogenic!</p><p>On the 31-tET guitar you can pretty much think conventionally . . .<br/>you also have those neutral thirds and neutral sevenths (&quot;blue&quot;<br/>thirds and &quot;blue&quot; sevenths) which somehow don&apos;t sound bluesy, but<br/>rather &quot;oriental&quot;, when you hit them directly as opposed to bending<br/>up to them as a normal 12-tET blues guitarist would. So this takes<br/>one outside the &quot;funky&quot; realm . . . anyway I need new batteries for<br/>the active pickups in the 31-tET guitar . . . the distortion is<br/>overwhelming right now . . .</p><p>Although I&apos;ve spent comparatively little time playing bass, I think<br/>it&apos;s the instrument on which I have the most natural talent. I&apos;ve<br/>asked Jon Catler for a fretless bass marked for both 22-tET and 31-<br/>tET. If he ever gets back to me on that, and the instrument arrives,<br/>I plan to create some funky microtonal multi-track recordings.</p><p>&gt; Do you tune your open strings to an E based tuning? Or other?</p><p>The tunings are pretty much as standard as they get given the ETs in<br/>question (other than the fact that the 22-tET guitar is a 7-string<br/>with a &quot;low B&quot;). I played 12-tET 7-string guitar tuned in all fourths<br/>for three years, since that makes all modes in all positions exactly<br/>the same fingering (up to a rotation). Going back to standard 12-tET<br/>tuning, I just have to always remember to adjust one fret when moving<br/>between the G and B strings. This adjustment remains one fret on the<br/>22-tET (though the one-fret shift is only about half the distance),<br/>but it becomes three frets in 31-tET (since the diatonic semitone is<br/>three degrees of 31-tET). On the 31-tET guitar the interval between<br/>the G and B strings is 1 cent off a pure 5:4, while on the 22-tET<br/>guitar, it&apos;s 1 cent off a pure 7:9. As for absolute pitch, it&apos;s<br/>generally in the ballpark of where the strings are conventionally<br/>tuned (so that the tension feels right), but beyond that, I don&apos;t<br/>care.</p><p>My next microtonal guitar is going to be an acoustic &quot;shrutar&quot; for<br/>playing raga-style music. It will normally be tuned to an open tuning<br/>with only 1/1s and 3/2s. Dave Keenan and I have been discussing it<br/>quite a bit. The fretting will be an unequal 22, with many of the<br/>pitches forming just ratios against the open strings. I&apos;m getting<br/>quite bored of trying to play this style on the 12-tET guitar (not to<br/>mention it doesn&apos;t sound right)!</p></div>
