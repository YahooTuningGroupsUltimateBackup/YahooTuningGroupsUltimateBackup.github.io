There could be a number of reasons why<br/>people did not respond.  One time I posted an announcement for a<br/>musical piece that I had posted on my SoundClick page.  To the best of<br/>my recollection, no one responded to that message here on the forum.<br/>I noticed, however, that the traffic to that song I mentioned had<br/>increased noticeably for the next few days thereafter.  So, I know<br/>that people did at least take the time to listen to it, even if there<br/>wasn&apos;t a specific written response of any kind.  My song even got a<br/>fairly significant ranking in its genre for a while because of the<br/>traffic so at least enough people listened to it and marked enough<br/>&quot;stars&quot; on it to work it up the ranks.</p><p>Have fun and I hope you stick around.</p><p>One of those MMM lurkers -<br/>Jay Rinkel</p><p>Quoting anomolos23 &lt;anomolos23@...&gt;:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I gather from the extended Silence to my first Post, that I am<br/>&gt; un-welcome at this Forum.
