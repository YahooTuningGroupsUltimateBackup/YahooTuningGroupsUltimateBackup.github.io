Dan submitted the following to me:</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>&quot;Study No. 1&quot;<br/>For the Alesis HR-16:B drum machine<br/>Voice 39, pitches -16 through 0</p><p>Sometimes inspiration and the process of composing show a startling indifference to the real-world events and stimuli that surround them. Certainly this was the case when I wrote the bulk of this piece while honeymooning in Maine during the late summer of 1990--this piece had its own momentum and its own agenda, and neither late summer reverie nor post-marital glow could temper their course.</p><p>At some point in the months that preceded the wedding and the Maine vacation I noticed that the drum machine I recently acquired was utilizing a tuning schematic based on something other than 12-tone equal temperament. Initially I was more curious than obsessed, so I contacted the manufacture to inquire how, and perhaps why, this machine was tuned as it was. Surprisingly, no one I contacted in the Alesis tech department--employees of the very company that makes the machine--had any idea; and when I asked them if they could point me in the direction of someone who did, they said no! So, having exhausted that avenue and at a loss of where else to turn, I set out on my own.</p><p>The Alesis HR-16:B is designed so that the pitch of a given sample can be altered by way of a slider that traverses a number line from -16 through +15. In this composition I used voice 39; what they call a &quot;pipe&quot;. I used this particular sample because its ponk had a desirable amount of hang time and this allowed my ear to get a better read on its pitch content. Voice 39 is tuned to harmonics 16 through 47 as follows:</p><p>-16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</p><p>16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46:47</p><p>The first line represents the HR-16:B&apos;s slider and its -16 through +15 number line, and the second line represents the corresponding harmonics. This arrangement gives eight complete octaves (and a ninth that abruptly stops at 24:47):</p><p>-16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0<br/>-15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2<br/>-14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4<br/>-13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>-12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br/>-11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>-10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12<br/>-9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14<br/>(-8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)</p><p>16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32<br/>17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34<br/>18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36<br/>19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38<br/>20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40<br/>21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42<br/>22:23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44<br/>23:24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46<br/>(24:25:26:27:28:29:30:31:32:33:34:35:36:37:38:39:40:41:42:43:44:45:46:47)</p><p>So while I still didn&apos;t--and still don&apos;t--know why this was, from that time on I knew what it was. And it wasn&apos;t long before vague but powerful images of Conlon Nancarrow and Lou Harrison began dancing in my head and I started to daydream in earnest about a series of studies for the HR-16 and its secretive just intonation component.</p><p>Study No. 1 uses a single 16-32 overtone octave, and the bulk of this piece was composed on the aforementioned vacation from head to paper and later step-written into the machine in a tortuously slow-going process that nearly exceeded my capacity to endure! Composing in this queer and restrictive fashion gives the results a certain character and dimension beyond the notes and the rhythms, as I believe this piece shows, but it also goes against my grain and eventually I abandoned the JI drum machine studies for other projects that better suited my temperament. Recently though, after receiving a generous gift of the complete Nancarrow player piano series, I was inspired to pull this piece out of storage and finish integrating the middle, two-tiered counterpoint section into the main body of the piece. So, fourteen long years after 99% of it was composed one weekend one late summer in Maine, I&apos;d like to dedicate this odd little piece to Jon Szanto who coined the MMM moniker not as a hammer but as a light...<br/>Make Microtonal Music!</p><p>4/23/04,<br/>Dan Stearns<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>You can take a listen to the piece, as well as viewing a few measures from the score (which Dan had to devise his own notation) by going to:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>danieljameswolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2004 3:56:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

Like Nancarrow&apos;s player piano pieces, part of the charm<br/>for me was making this pop culture machine do things it&apos;s designers<br/>never could&apos;ve imagined--or in this case, even seemed to know about!<br/>The other samples were tuned differently, and voice 39 was really the<br/>only one I took the time to get a good read on. Taken as a timbre in<br/>its own right it&apos;s very poor, but--again, like the Nancarrow pieces--<br/>taken as a component of the whole enterprise I actually quite liked<br/>it; and if you listen hard you can hear sonic artifacts of it<br/>fighting the things I&apos;m making it do (weird snipping and clipped<br/>electronic junk in the signal). The Lou Harrison reference was meant<br/>as one of style:I wanted to use the just tunings in a lighter style<br/>than I usually compose with while still focusing on melody and<br/>harmony as opposed to timbre and drone.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
