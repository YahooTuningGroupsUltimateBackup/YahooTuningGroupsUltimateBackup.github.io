This is what i had in mind:</p><p>When one looks across a water surface, you often see a delicate and<br/>complex interaction of waves that would be ideal to transfer directly<br/>into sound, however it is physically impossible to capture one<br/>&quot;moment&quot; of each point of an entire surface, in a straight line from<br/>one point to each other.</p><p>But the same effect could be gotten by somehow measuring ONE STATIC<br/>POINT on the surface over time, as waves pass by it and thus expose<br/>their entire shape to the one point measured by some sort of<br/>electronics. The ideal way to achieve this would be through some sort<br/>of laser light with measured reflection, somewhat similar to a CD<br/>player, placed below the surface and avoiding to disturb the natural<br/>motions of the surface in any way.</p><p>I really would not recommend using some kind of moving floater, as<br/>they interfere with the waves too much and also don&apos;t follow them<br/>entirely-though this could of course be used intentionally. The same<br/>with using a vertical transparent screen with some sort of optical<br/>measuring, as water crashing against the wall would have a particular<br/>behaviour that would usually not be sought after.</p><p>The result, of course, would be a complex harmony or intermodulation<br/>of very slow motions ranging from 0.1 to about 4 or 5 hertz, plus<br/>overtones. Very small streams and vibrations in small buckets etc.<br/>could possibly be up to 20 hertz in fundamental frequency.</p><p>This would simply be sped up about 20 to 1000 times to be fully<br/>audible. Of course this also means that the time is very compressed,<br/>but that is part of the whole idea.</p><p>There would be great differences from placing the &quot;measurement&quot; at<br/>different points, and closer to the edge of the body of water used. It<br/>would be of great interest to run several recorders at different spots<br/>in parallel at the same time, to compare how they respond to the events.</p><p>The whole point is that there is very unique and varied responses to<br/>the water by the change of winds over time, and possibly very few<br/>other interferences such as having a large floating bridge nearby<br/>which would probably produce a nearly fixed-pitch sine wave.</p><p>There is also potential for using non-natural bodies of water-barrels,<br/>buckets or bathtubs, to pick up wind in a different way. The motions<br/>of rivers and streams could of course also be recorded, though they<br/>would be a lot more regular than a &quot;still&quot; body activated only by wind.</p><p>And walls and floating objects nearby could also be placed to act as<br/>intentional &quot;filters&quot; for diferent frequencies, also draining channels<br/>into-or from-the body of water recorded would be permanent, probably<br/>noise-like sound sources.</p><p>Of course other objects, light enough to move in the wind, could be<br/>&quot;motion recorded&quot; in the same way. But they have very strong and fixed<br/>resonant frequencies which makes them less interesting, as they are<br/>more like instruments activated by wind. A water surface is peculiar<br/>because it has no fixed resonant frequencies at all, the shape and<br/>speed of the waves is only created by the wind itself. Thus it will be<br/>much more complex and varied.</p><p>What i wonder now is if there is any history of this kind of &quot;surface<br/>motion recording&quot; being done or attempted before.</p></div><h3><a id=10309 href="#10309">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2005 11:08:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 09:35 AM 9/1/2005, you wrote:<br/>&gt;I wonder if anyone know of any previous attempts at recording the<br/>&gt;shape of water waves as a sound source.
