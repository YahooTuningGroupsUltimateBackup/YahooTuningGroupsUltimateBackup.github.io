Point me to some posts about this here tuning - sounds<br/>&gt; interesting. You know I loves some Pelog and Slendros.</p><p>Well, rather than force you to trudge through some rather technical<br/>tuning-math posts, let me summarize the result in this way:</p><p>(NOTE: LARGE AMOUNT OF THEORY BELOW. PLEASE FORGIVE ME BUT I WOULD<br/>REALLY LIKE TO COMMUNICATE THIS TO JACKY AND PERHAPS OTHERS WILL BE<br/>INTERESTED)</p><p>Tuning in Western tonal music basically all comes down to eliminating<br/>the interval 81:80. This alone unambiguously _defines_ meantone<br/>tuning, implies the diatonic scale and Western notation. Similarly,<br/>Pelog can be seen as being unambiguously defined by the elimination<br/>of the 135:128. Just as Woolhouse in 1835 found that the optimal<br/>meantone tuning has a generator of about 696 cents, similarly it can<br/>be shown that the &quot;optimal Pelog tuning&quot; has a generator of about 677<br/>cents. (If the octave is included in the optimization, an overall<br/>stretch of 15 cents per octave can be implicated.) Retuning a<br/>keyboard to a chain of 677 cent, instead of 700 cent, fifths, using<br/>an open inharmonic timbre with a clear sense of pitch, and a non-<br/>sustaining envelope, one can evoke a rather authentic Balinese<br/>atmosphere by playing several simultaneous melodies in what look like<br/>normal pentatonic scales like C-D-E-G-A and perhaps a few simple<br/>modulations by fifths.</p><p>What happens when you generate a scale with 677 cent fifths?<br/>Basically, you get &quot;minor thirds&quot; everywhere you expect to get &quot;major<br/>thirds&quot;, and vice versa! It sort of takes the usual Western<br/>intervallic relationships and turns them upside-down.</p><p>It seems pretty clear to me that the details of the inharmonic timbre<br/>are far less important for evoking the authentic Pelog effect. If a<br/>timbre is used with too much energy in the lower overtones, though,<br/>the 677-cent fifths will sound quite dissonant, unless the timbre is<br/>made to match the tuning. But this does not result in an authentic-<br/>sounding Balinese texture, by any means. The authentic Balinese sound<br/>seems to cultivate beating, rather than trying to eliminate it. As<br/>long as the timbres evoke a clear pitch without too much energy in<br/>the lower overtones, my harmonic entropy model would seem to dictate<br/>that 677 cents will be perceived as a 3:2 ratio, and thus act as a<br/>strong interval in the music.</p><p>One may object that actual observed Pelog tunings seem to be chains<br/>of fifths ranging from as low as 650 cents to as high as 700 cents,<br/>rather than uniformly using fifths of 677 cents. Since the timbres<br/>are rather &quot;pastelized&quot;, as Margo puts it, such changes do not make<br/>nearly as noticeable a difference as changes of this order of<br/>magnitude would make with typical Western harmonic timbres. The<br/>salient point though is, as long as the fifths _average_ about 677<br/>cents, you will get &quot;minor thirds&quot; everywhere a Westerner expects to<br/>get &quot;major thirds&quot;, and vice versa. This feature is equivalent to the<br/>statement that the elimination of the 135:128 _defines_ Pelog tuning,<br/>just as the elimination of the 81:80 defines Western diatonic scales,<br/>which are also found in varying (albeit with their lesser degree of<br/>latitude due to the timbres) tunings historically and geographically.</p><p>The first person I know of to have observed that Pelog tuning seems<br/>to be defined by the elimination of 135:128, just as Western tuning<br/>has been defined by the elimination of 81:80, is Herman Miller. He<br/>has made a great deal of very enjoyable music drawing inspiration<br/>from various ethnic musics from around the world. It was most<br/>heartening that, in our comprehensive investigation on tuning-math of<br/>commas and the tunings they define, we found that the simplest 5-<br/>limit tunings without exceedingly large errors were those defined by<br/>the commas 81:80 and 135:128, respectively. When I saw that the<br/>generator implied by the commatization of 135:128 was about 677<br/>cents, I was immediately reminded of Herman Miller and his<br/>Pelog &quot;discovery&quot;.</p><p>Slendro may be understood as a temperament involving the primes 2, 3<br/>and 7, instead of 2, 3 and 5. The defining comma could be said to be<br/>1029:1024. As this interval is listed in Manuel&apos;s table as<br/>the &quot;Gamelan residue&quot;, this insight may at least partly be a rather<br/>old one in the tuning literature. However, the tuning so defined has<br/>rather small errors compared with JI, as opposed to Pelog&apos;s rather<br/>large errors. Also I have much less listening experience with<br/>authentic Slendro examples than with Pelog examples. Hence the<br/>identification of Slendro with the 1029:1024-based temperament seems<br/>much more speculative to me at this point, and I would not rule out<br/>other explanations, such as a 3-limit tuning with 256:243 eliminated,<br/>at this point.</p></div><h3><a id=1674 href="#1674">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2002 12:37:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looks neat! Don&apos;t get what you are saying about the 1215 cents wide<br/>&gt; octave though.</p><p>Well, this is sort of &quot;optional&quot; . . . everything else in my post<br/>sort of assumed just octaves (what the Indonesians call &quot;pleng&quot;).

Is he still around in the<br/>&gt; internet tuning world? Haven&apos;t heard a thing out of him for a<br/>while.<br/>&gt; Know if he&apos;s got any new tunes? Let&apos;s hear&apos;em Herman - if you are<br/>out<br/>&gt; there in internet land!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone written any music with this here tuning yet? Lay it on<br/>me!</p><p>Perhaps Herman has. I&apos;ve done a lot of keyboard improvisation with<br/>it, but my keyboard chops are positively rusty right now, and the<br/>Ensoniq timbres are generally a little less than presentable. I set<br/>the tuning up for my keyboardist collaborator Ara Sarkissian, using<br/>Graham&apos;s MIDI Relay (just change the meantone fifth to 677 cents),<br/>described to him the basic stylistic and scalar strategy, and pretty<br/>soon a mind-bending modulatory masterwork was emerging. He&apos;s leaving<br/>tomorrow for a few weeks in Lebanon (for a friend&apos;s wedding), but<br/>when he returns, I&apos;ll make it a top priority to get something<br/>recorded . . . there&apos;s a bit of a problem now with the decays of the<br/>notes &quot;bending&quot; slightly . . . it seems Ara&apos;s Soundblaster card isn&apos;t<br/>exactly liking what MIDI Relay is doing . . .</p></div>
