There have<br/>been 274 songs so far,  I&apos;ve only got 92 more to go to reach 366.  I<br/>chose 366 because 2006  will be a leap year, and I don&apos;t want to<br/>cheat anyone out of a full year of music.</p><p>-John</p><p>Cinema Volta: Daily Ambience<br/>Fresh Ambient Music Composed Daily<br/>a new tune every day, free of charge<br/>at: <a href="http://www.cinemavolta.com/daily">http://www.cinemavolta.com/daily</a></p><p>About Cinema Volta: Daily Ambience:</p><p>As an exploration of ambient music and the limits of my own<br/>creativity, I have been composing and releasing a new song every day.</p><p>Sometimes these songs are sketches, sometimes full-blown<br/>compositions, it all depends on my inspiration and my available time.</p><p>About Cinema Volta:</p><p>Cinema Volta consists of John Maxwell Hobbs, a stack of electronic<br/>equipment, musical instruments in various states of disrepair and<br/>occasional collaborators.</p><p>John Maxwell Hobbs is an electronic musician based in Stockholm<br/>Sweden who has been working with computer multimedia and<br/>telecommunications for more than eighteen years. His contributions to<br/>the early days of music on the web have been documented in the book<br/>&quot;Virtual Music&quot; by William Duckworth.</p><p> From the book:</p><p>&quot;In a review of his interactive online instrument, Web Phases, Kyle<br/>Gann of the Village Voice described it as being &apos;on a noticeably<br/>higher artistic level&apos; than the earliest tape-music and computer-<br/>music pieces, concluding that &apos;the potential for social reorientation<br/>is even more incredible,&apos; and predicting &apos;we&apos;ll look back and say<br/>1998 was the year our relationship to music entered a new era.&apos;&quot;</p><p>For much of the &apos;90s he was the Producing Director of The Kitchen in<br/>New York where he was involved in producing the performances by<br/>Philip Glass, DJ Spooky, David Hykes and many others.</p><p>He is the Vice President of the board of directors of Vanguard<br/>Visions, an organization dedicated to fostering the work of artists<br/>experimenting with technology and also served on the Digital Arts<br/>subcommittee of the Mayor&apos;s Council on New Media in New York City.<br/>His interactive composition Web Phases was one of the winners of<br/>ASCI&apos;s Digital &apos;98 competition.
