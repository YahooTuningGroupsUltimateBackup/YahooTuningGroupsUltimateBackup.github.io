When you<br/>search, you have to only search a small slice of it&apos;s history.</p><p>For example, I wanted to research Gene&apos;s &apos;Baked Alaska&apos; variant on Carl<br/>Lumma&apos;s &apos;Alaska&apos;, without using extra list bandwidth to bother Gene or anyone<br/>else to try to remember and/or manually figure out where/when the hell it was<br/>posted about.</p><p>BTW, I&apos;d be into switching to usenet through Google for that reason alone !!!</p><p>So tommorrow, I&apos;m planning on whipping up a Python script, using the wonderful<br/><a href="http://urllib2.py">urllib2.py</a> html library that comes with that most amazing of languages, that<br/>will automate the search process of the Yahoo! portal by taking two command<br/>line arguments: the first being the desired mailing list, the second being<br/>the search term(s) one would normally type into the &apos;search archive&apos; web<br/>portal.</p><p>The idea is that it will intelligently iterate through the archive, going<br/>backwards from the present, and doing multiple slices consectutively and<br/>automatically, sending to the console a status message as it goes of what it<br/>has or has not found. For a hard copy, one could simply redirect stdout to a<br/>text file, for example:</p><p>pymailsearch &apos;tuning&apos; &apos;lumma alaska&apos; &gt; alaska_hits.txt</p><p>A hit would be indicated by the post number (ex. 54008) from the archive. One<br/>could then manually type in the post numbers from a browser, or maybe a<br/>second script could be written which could then retrieve all of the relevant<br/>hits for &apos;lumma alaska&apos; intelligently using the &apos;alaska_hits.txt&apos; file,<br/>concatenating them to a summary of message body file (which I guess could get<br/>large, perhaps a command line switch could manually limit them), for example:</p><p>mailsummary alaska_hits.txt &gt; alaska_reference.txt</p><p>I plan that the &apos;alaska_hits.txt&apos; file would have a header, making the need to<br/>respecify the mailing list unneccessary.....</p><p>This, I think, would be a great resource tool for all tuning research done<br/>using the vast repository of the tuning list(s) wisdom, no?</p><p>What do you all think?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=7124 href="#7124">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
