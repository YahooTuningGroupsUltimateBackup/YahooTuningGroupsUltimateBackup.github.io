Characteristically, it<br/>extends beyond the scope of a single octave, with its lower component<br/>forming a tetratonic pattern. From bottom to top the scale goes like this:<br/>0 cents / 386 cents / 702 cents /969 cents / 1200 cents / 1404 cents. This<br/>scale, if sung in descending order, sounds stunningly blues-like, though<br/>this is hardly the whole storey&quot;.<br/>Gerhard Kubik.</p><p>(I&apos;ve slightly edited the above.

It&apos;s about actually *composing* and also involves the<br/>discussion of hardware and software to do this.</p><p>&quot;Metatuning&quot; is for any issues *not* specifically related to Tuning<br/>but which are obsessing the Tuning Posters.... Since we pretty much<br/>know one another after all these posts on the lists...</p><p>There is one more:  tuning-math @ <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/messages</a></p><p>which is even *more* mathematical than the general *Tuning* list.</p><p>That list is mostly for specialists, but you might care to look at it<br/>as well...</p><p>&gt; 2. I&apos;ve always been interested in the relationship between music and<br/>&gt; mathamatics, beyond this the issues that I would like to discuss on<br/>the<br/>&gt; appropriate lists are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i).

Joseph and Jeff gave very good replies, and<br/>I have little to add, so it&apos;s just a clarifying (since I&apos;m the guy<br/>that started up this list [with some help] I thought I&apos;d weigh in).</p><p>I&apos;ll second the general descriptions; so that you know, tuning@ was<br/>the original tuning list, going back to about 1994-5. It has a<br/>longish history, and while first starting out the posts touched on<br/>many topics, it has *gradually* steered to a theory-centric path.<br/>This is not to say music hasn&apos;t been posted there, or that<br/>discussions haven&apos;t gone in other directions. But it did develop a<br/>trend, and there came a time when other lists spun off. Of these, I<br/>think you&apos;ll most be interested in:</p><p>1. MakeMicroMusic, which is us: you&apos;ll find direct answers from<br/>people who either use computers/synths to make their music, or build<br/>instruments (or adapt existing ones), and a blending of the two. This<br/>is a fine collection of people who know how to use existing tools to<br/>turn the theory of non-12tet music into actual pieces, and I&apos;ve<br/>always been amazed at the depth of experience, from gear to<br/>intonational understanding. If you want to make it, this is it.</p><p>2. tuning-math: this is hard-core stuff, but if you really hard an in-<br/>depth question or proposal at the intersection of math and music,<br/>these people know their stuff. Not many actively post, but those that<br/>do are prodigious and worthy.</p><p>Also, if it is math/music of a more general nature, go ahead and post<br/>to tuning itself: you&apos;ll reach the most people, and if someone thinks<br/>you&apos;ll get a better answer at tuning-math, they&apos;ll let you know.</p><p>3. Finally, I don&apos;t think you need to worry about meta-tuning right<br/>now - it&apos;s mainly there as a &quot;hey, why don&apos;t you two take it outside<br/>already!&quot; kind of place! :)</p><p>So you know, tuning has 500+ members, while the other lists are all<br/>less than 70. Broad reach at tuning, focus groups at the others.</p><p>&gt; My apologies to those who recieve multiple copies of this mail, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; posting it to all 3 of the above lists.</p><p>How else would we know? One last thing: the &apos;files&apos; section here on<br/>Yahoo was, at best, crappy, so I opened up a domain/site with the<br/>express purpose for facilitating sharing of music files. It is only<br/>about a week old, but there are a few things up there:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/">http://www.microtonal.org/</a></p><p>And be very sure to check out our own Jacky Ligon&apos;s &quot;The Microtonal<br/>Activist&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://tma.asgarddesign.net/">http://tma.asgarddesign.net/</a></p><p>Welcome to all the other pitches that exist!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (listMom)</p></div>
