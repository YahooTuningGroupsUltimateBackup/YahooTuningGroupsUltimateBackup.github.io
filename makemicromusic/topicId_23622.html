I&apos;m using a PC with Firefox, so if<br/>this is my problem would someone smarter give me a heads-up?</p><p>As to the topic of tuning math, I can freely admit to being pretty<br/>ignorant. I never got beyond college algebra (my daughter is taking<br/>courses in trig, which astounds me no end) so lots of the math just<br/>flies over my flat skull; I eventually left that list because I couldn&apos;t<br/>keep up with most of the discussions there, nor as a composer (you can<br/>laugh here, &apos;cause I do) extract much in the way of understanding the<br/>viability of tunings/theories proposed. This is NOT a rant against<br/>theories or math, only an explanation: that my lack of understanding<br/>stems from my own particular intellectual failings.</p><p>[ I used to give Gene Ward Smith a friendly chain-yank about math now &amp;<br/>then; I miss him and wish him well, whatever he is doing now.]</p><p>Thus, my best recourse is to *hear* any given tuning in the flesh, as it<br/>were. Cases in point: I am working on pieces in 7 ET, 19 ET, 9-out-of-26<br/>ET, and a diatonic just-tuning with neutral seconds. Some here recall<br/>that I used Orion Pro frequently, which is a pattern-based sequencer<br/>(more or less); so I input a bass or chord sequence and simply work<br/>onward from there. I *listen* for pitch combinations that make musical<br/>sense &amp; are aesthetically satisfying, based upon -- but not restricted<br/>to -- my own prejudiced leanings toward 5-limit diatonic harmony.</p><p>It&apos;s taking a bit longer to finish these pieces &amp; post them, due to<br/>recent work schedule changes (and other things), but I&apos;ll alert everyone<br/>when I *do* complete them -- for those with a morbid curiosity about<br/>such things...</p><p>Best,<br/>jls</p></div>
