Infact you won&apos;t be able to play but a few.</p><p>Now thesame thing goes for modulations.<br/>A simple 12 tone scale will give only very few correct modulations in very<br/>few situations.<br/>In fact modulation and harmony are one and thesame.<br/>And again you need many many more notes than 12.</p><p>To give you a very simple example I gave before in another thread (where it<br/>wasn&apos;t paid deserved attention to):<br/>In a harmony of 3 or more tones, these tones do not only vibrate together<br/>with the groundtone, but also vibrate together amongst eachother.<br/>For instance in 1/1 5/4 3/2 the tones 5/4 and 3/2 vibrate together in the<br/>ratio 6/5. This is important and very audible.<br/>If you take for instance 1/1 4/3 9/5 or 1/1 4/3 7/4 you think hey these are<br/>the lowest ratios this must be the correct way to play this harmony.<br/>But in the case of 1/1 4/3 9/5: 4/3 and 9/5 vibrate together in the ratio<br/>27/20, very close to 4/3 and audibly out of tune and wrong in almost all<br/>situations.<br/>And in the case of 1/1 4/3 7/4: 4/3 and 7/4 vibrate together in the ratio<br/>21/16, again very close to 4/3 and audibly out of tune and wrong in almost<br/>all situations.<br/>Almost allways the correct way to tune this harmony is 1/1 4/3 16/9.<br/>But you do use 7/4 often when dividing 4/3 for instance 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 (but<br/>not allways)<br/>And 9/5 in for instance 1/1 6/5 9/5 9/2.<br/>I could give thousands of more examples where the lowest ratios to the<br/>groundtones are not the ones to make correct harmonies.<br/>I&apos;ve strugled with the problem myself and realised I had to come up with a<br/>way to construct and &quot;rate&quot; harmonies from simple to more complex, not based<br/>on some sort of &apos;consonance&apos; in the way i had been using to describe it<br/>before.<br/>Before i mainly rated a harmony based on how fast the groundtone had to<br/>vibrate to be in harmony with all the other tones of the harmony (there&apos;s<br/>got to be a word for this but i don&apos;t know it :)<br/>In other words 1/1 6/5 9/5 9/4 = 20:24:36:45 and 1/1 4/3 16/9 = 9:12:16 etc<br/>This wasn&apos;t satisfactory for me as an explanation of harmony or as a way to<br/>contruct harmony or rate harmony (many problems with this in many ways<br/>including higher prime harmonics but i won&apos;t bore you with this long story)<br/>and after long thinking i found a new way to look at harmony. (which btw i&apos;m<br/>going to call de velde theory of harmony :) but will take me atleast another<br/>half year to finish, maybe longer)</p><p>Take the harmonic series. 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1 7/1 8/1 etc<br/>And the intervals the tones have in the harmonic series: 2/1 3/2 4/3 5/4 6/5<br/>7/6 8/7 etc<br/>To see the harmonic series and the intervals / structure it gives as the<br/>building blocks of harmony. (why i think this is so is a long story again)<br/>Now you can place several limits for instance to construct and rate harmony.<br/>Harmonic limit - how far up the harmonic scale you go.<br/>Prime limit - for instance include no higher primes than 7.<br/>&apos;inversion&apos; limit - for instance inversion limit 6 won&apos;t allow to invert the<br/>7th. (more complex than this but again long story)<br/>and i have several other things thought up to order this system.<br/>most simple harmony is 1/1 2/1<br/>then 1/1 2/1 3/1 or 1/1 2/1 4/1 depending on how you limit / order / rate.<br/>then for instance 1/1 3/2 3/1, then 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1, 1/1 3/2 3/1 4/1, 1/1<br/>2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1, 1/1 3/2 3/1 4/1 5/1, 1/1 2/1 3/1 15/8 5/1, etc etc<br/>I&apos;ve calculated that for instance if you use harmonic 9 limit and prime 5<br/>limit and no other limits you get the following intervals:<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 27/20 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 27/16 16/9 9/5 15/8 2/1 81/40<br/>135/64 32/15 20/9 9/4 12/5 5/2 81/32 8/3 27/10 45/16 3/1 16/5 10/3 27/8 32/9<br/>18/5 15/4 4/1 81/20 135/32 64/15 40/9 9/2 24/5 5/1 81/16 16/3 27/5 45/8 6/1<br/>32/5 20/3 27/4 36/5 15/2 8/1 9/1<br/>brought to one octave this is the following scale:<br/>1/1 81/80 135/128 16/15 10/9 9/8 6/5 5/4 81/64 4/3 27/20 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3<br/>27/16 16/9 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>(note that i simply brought back things to one octave but that you can&apos;t<br/>just shift pitches in a harmony by octaves, 9/4 is not thesame as 9/8! and<br/>32/15 is not thesame as 16/15! same goes for many other intervals)<br/>Above example gives only the most basic harmonies and the most basic<br/>modulation structure.<br/>Even if you were not to agree with my method to construct / rate harmony (of<br/>which this is just the smallest tip of the iceberg), i can&apos;t see anybody<br/>disagreeing with the correct tuning of any of the harmonies the above<br/>example describes.</p><p>To give a bit more complex example (but still largely simple) of intervals<br/>given with this system.<br/>Here are the intervals of harmonic 10 limit without any other limits<br/>(although inversion limit would be practical here but too long to explain so<br/>not limiting here)<br/> 1/1 10/9 9/8 8/7 7/6 6/5 5/4 80/63 9/7 35/27 21/16 4/3 27/20 48/35 25/18<br/>7/5 45/32 10/7 35/24 40/27 3/2 32/21<br/> 54/35 14/9 25/16 63/40 100/63 8/5 45/28 175/108 105/64 5/3 27/16 320/189<br/>12/7 140/81 7/4 16/9 25/14 9/5 175/96<br/> 64/35 50/27 28/15 15/8 40/21 27/14 35/18 63/32 160/81 2/1 81/40 128/63<br/>72/35 56/27 25/12 21/10 135/64 400/189<br/> 32/15 15/7 175/81 35/16 20/9 9/4 16/7 81/35 7/3 75/32 189/80 64/27 50/21<br/>12/5 135/56 175/72 315/128 200/81 5/2<br/> 81/32 160/63 18/7 70/27 21/8 8/3 75/28 27/10 175/64 96/35 25/9 14/5 45/16<br/>20/7 81/28 35/12 189/64 80/27 3/1<br/> 64/21 108/35 28/9 25/8 63/20 200/63 16/5 45/14 175/54 105/32 10/3 27/8<br/>640/189 24/7 280/81 7/2 32/9 25/7 18/5<br/> 175/48 128/35 100/27 56/15 15/4 80/21 27/7 35/9 63/16 320/81 4/1 81/20<br/>256/63 144/35 112/27 25/6 21/5 135/32<br/> 800/189 64/15 30/7 350/81 35/8 40/9 9/2 32/7 162/35 14/3 75/16 189/40<br/>128/27 100/21 24/5 135/28 175/36 315/64<br/> 400/81 5/1 81/16 320/63 36/7 140/27 21/4 16/3 75/14 27/5 175/32 192/35 50/9<br/>28/5 45/8 40/7 81/14 35/6 189/32<br/> 160/27 6/1 128/21 216/35 56/9 25/4 63/10 400/63 32/5 45/7 175/27 105/16<br/>20/3 27/4 48/7 7/1 64/9 50/7 36/5<br/> 175/24 200/27 15/2 160/21 54/7 70/9 63/8 8/1 25/3 60/7 35/4 80/9 9/1 10/1<br/>above brought to one octave:<br/> 1/1 81/80 64/63 36/35 28/27 25/24 21/20 135/128 200/189 16/15 15/14 175/162<br/>35/32 10/9 9/8 8/7 81/70 7/6 75/64<br/> 189/160 32/27 25/21 6/5 135/112 175/144 315/256 100/81 5/4 81/64 80/63 9/7<br/>35/27 21/16 4/3 75/56 27/20 175/128<br/> 48/35 25/18 7/5 45/32 10/7 81/56 35/24 189/128 40/27 3/2 32/21 54/35 14/9<br/>25/16 63/40 100/63 8/5 45/28 175/108<br/> 105/64 5/3 27/16 320/189 12/7 140/81 7/4 16/9 25/14 9/5 175/96 64/35 50/27<br/>28/15 15/8 40/21 27/14 35/18 63/32<br/> 160/81 2/1</p><p>people who compose music in just intonation will either have to use a scale<br/>similar to the ones above, or write the intervals as they write the notes<br/>and make a custom scale for each composition.<br/>the small &apos;harmonic&apos; or just intonation 12 tone scales i see everywhere are<br/>useless.</p><p>To end my story:<br/>This dynamic modulation you talk about is based on misunderstanding of the<br/>complexity and structure of harmony and modulation.<br/>To use it will result in out of tune music.

Unfortunately, we&apos;re not on<br/>&gt; the same wavelength yet...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But in the case of 1/1 4/3 9/5: 4/3 and 9/5 vibrate together in the ratio<br/>&gt; &gt;27/20, very close to 4/3 and audibly out of tune and wrong in almost all<br/>&gt; &gt;situations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure. What does it have to do with dynamic modulation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And in the case of 1/1 4/3 7/4: 4/3 and 7/4 vibrate together in the ratio<br/>&gt; &gt;21/16, again very close to 4/3 and audibly out of tune and wrong in almost<br/>&gt; &gt;all situations.<br/>&gt; &gt;Almost allways the correct way to tune this harmony is 1/1 4/3 16/9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s the most consonant version of this chord in JI. But you<br/>&gt; may find it interesting that this chord is at least as consonant, if<br/>&gt; not more consonant, in pajara temperament (e.g. 22-ET). Try it and<br/>&gt; tell us what you think!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I could give thousands of more examples where the lowest ratios to the<br/>&gt; &gt;groundtones are not the ones to make correct harmonies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far you haven&apos;t given any. Written as harmonic series segments,<br/>&gt; 1/1 4/3 7/4 is 12:16:21 and 1/1 4/3 9/5 is 15:20:27, while 1/1 4/3 16/9<br/>&gt; is 9:12:16. And I would guess you agree with me that these three chords<br/>&gt; are ranked from most to least consonant according to the magnitude of<br/>&gt; their roots here. Yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (In order to be able to compare chords that are not the same approximate<br/>&gt; width, I look not just at the magnitude of the root, but instead at the<br/>&gt; geometric mean of the product of all the terms in the chord. For<br/>&gt; example, the cube root of 12*16*21 = 15.9.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;To end my story:<br/>&gt; &gt;This dynamic modulation you talk about is based on misunderstanding of the<br/>&gt; &gt;complexity and structure of harmony and modulation.<br/>&gt; &gt;To use it will result in out of tune music. You may be better off using<br/>&gt; &gt;equal temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I recommend you think through such claims a bit more carefully.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=20221 href="#20221">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2008 1:41:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel wrote:<br/>&gt;Hi Carl :)<br/>&gt;The main point i was making was the following.<br/>&gt;With a mere 12 tones per octave you can&apos;t make many in tune harmonies.</p><p>Of course.

But most listeners we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; tested on these lists, and most listeners in psychoacoustic laboratory<br/>&gt; experiments, find the 7-limit consonant when hearing bare chords.<br/>&gt; It actually is documented that there&apos;s sometimes a problem with<br/>&gt; trained musicians, who tend to hear anything out of the usual as out<br/>&gt; of tune, because they&apos;ve trained very hard to zero in on 5-limit<br/>&gt; harmony and the diatonic scale come hell or high water.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=20230 href="#20230">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2008 2:42:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah found them :)Overlooked them the first time.<br/>Thanks!</p><p>On Sat, Dec 13, 2008 at 6:08 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   I wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you have the midi of the music or notes I will tune it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; correctly for you and we can debate it if you want.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ll take you up on that.

It doesn&apos;t tell you much about the structure of a chord or<br/>&gt;what it&apos;s purpose is and things like that.</p><p>Nope, it certainly doesn&apos;t.  It just tells you consonance.  And<br/>even consonance is a complicated thing!  It just gives you a 1-D<br/>measure of it, so it can&apos;t be even close to perfect.  But that<br/>doesn&apos;t mean a 1-D measure can&apos;t capture an awful lot about<br/>consonance.  I like to compare it to IQ.  Human intelligence is<br/>a many-faceted thing.  There&apos;s so much that any 1-D measure like<br/>IQ cannot tell us.  But on the other hand, it is precisely in<br/>light of this fact that it is so amazing that IQ does indeed tell<br/>us a great deal about human intelligence.  There must be some<br/>general mechanism for intelligence in the brain, that 75% of it<br/>could be captured by a single number.  The same is true of<br/>consonance -- we can capture maybe 75% on a good day.  That&apos;s a<br/>triumph.  But as with intelligence, the last 25% is a doosie.<br/>It&apos;s extremely difficult to capture this last 25%.</p><p>&gt;And it sais that for instance 9:15:16 is a more consonant chord than<br/>&gt;15:20:24? I don&apos;t think so.</p><p>The formula ignores &quot;critical band effects&quot; (beating, roughness,<br/>and the like).  If a chord contains small intervals, or if the<br/>numbers in the chord are large (e.g. 401:501:601) it doesn&apos;t work.<br/>It&apos;s just a rule of thumb.  A very good rule of thumb.</p><p>&gt;And these are both 5-limit.</p><p>16/15 is a 15-odd-limit interval.  Prime limit is not applicable<br/>to the consonance of dyads.  It&apos;s also a narrow interval, which<br/>means more of its partials will beat, which distracts from<br/>consonance judgements.</p><p>&gt;With the magnitude of root / harmonic mean thing<br/>&gt;you can just throw in high primes like 11 and 13 which sound very<br/>&gt;dissonant yet still make those harmonies rate lower than 15:20:24?</p><p>Good work.  Please remember I did not explain the rule of thumb<br/>in full.  It has 3 main limitations:</p><p>* It doesn&apos;t work when the numbers get large.  It starts to stop<br/>working when the geomean gets to be around 10.</p><p>* It assumes harmonic timbres (won&apos;t work for metallophones and<br/>many bells).</p><p>* It ignores SPAN, the fact that very wide intervals are neither<br/>consonance or dissonant.  So you can not compare 5/4, sqrt(20)= 4.5,<br/>and 15/1, sqrt(15) = 3.9.</p><p>We have other methods when more precision is needed than this rule<br/>can provide.  Including something called &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;, which<br/>works when the numbers get large (e.g. 401 501 601), and indeed can<br/>even compare irrational intervals (as in a temperament) to rational<br/>ones.  Harmonic entropy cannot be calculated with google, however.<br/>:)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=20232 href="#20232">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2008 3:16:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 02:32 PM 12/15/2008, Marcel wrote:<br/>&gt;Hi Carl,<br/>&gt;Thanks for your reply and this interesting conversation :)</p><p>Likewise.</p><p>&gt;Google sais I&apos;m right though about the harmonic mean of 1/1 5/4 45/32 beeing<br/>&gt;higher than 1/1 5/4 7/5<br/>&gt;cube root(20 * 25 * 28) = 24.1014226<br/>&gt;cube root(32 * 40 * 45) = 38.6195754<br/>&gt;but now you say that it should indeed be played as 1/1 5/4 7/5?</p><p>I said I thought 1/1 5/4 7/5 was more consonant, when played in<br/>isolation in the alto or soprano range.
