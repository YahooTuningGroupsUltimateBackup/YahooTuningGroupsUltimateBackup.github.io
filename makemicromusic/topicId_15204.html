I&apos;m copying this to the main tuning list,<br/>&gt;where these more technical discussions are more appropriate (are<br/>&gt;you aware of it? <a href="/tuning">/tuning</a> ). If<br/>&gt;you like, just reply there.<br/>  Thanks, I&apos;ll reply in short here and in more depth a bit later today there.</p><p>&gt;On demand I may also make an optional Windows version with a complete,<br/>&gt;simple graphical interface that will in a way document itself, would<br/>&gt;you (or anyone else) find that useful?</p><p>&gt;I would, yes.<br/>  Cool, hopefully it will be out in a couple of months (I will likely start a VB front-end on it soon as I finish the foundation/(fast math/c++) side of it, or even at the same time if I get enough requests). :-)</p><p>&gt; Far as I&apos;ve learned it has many similarities but is not as<br/>&gt;complex. From what I understand Bill&apos;s work on tune, timber, and<br/>&gt;scale (huge oversimplification I know) involves re-tuning each<br/>&gt;instrument including overtones to a scale to minimize clashing<br/>&gt;overtones (or scale to instrument) that would bump up disonance<br/>&gt;between sounds so the new instrument matches the feel of the scale<br/>&gt;(with disonance only in places that make emotional sense).<br/>&gt; My interpretation simply fits existing overtones to a frequency<br/>&gt;schema that creates a minimum overall dissonance curve between all<br/>&gt;frequencies.</p><p>&gt;Sethares is probably most famous for take a scale as given, then<br/>&gt;cooking timbres to minimize tonotopic dissonance for dyads in it<br/>&gt;(as I understand it), then composing music with the scale and<br/>&gt;timbres. (I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s any more or less complex than what<br/>&gt;you&apos;re doing but...) He reads this list from time to time and<br/>&gt;maybe he&apos;ll try your software and chime in.<br/>  Hopefully so.</p><p>&gt;&gt;My only concern is resynthesis errors -- or are you just pitch-<br/>&gt;&gt;shifting bands of audio or something?<br/>&gt; It is a form of pitch-shifting only the most valid peak bands....</p><p>&gt;Cool. Bill has done tunes with more local effects (like Three Ears)<br/>&gt;than I described above but none using this exact approach that I<br/>&gt;know of.<br/>     A while (maybe 3-4 months) ago I talked to him and showed him an early version and he&apos;d done something similar with snapping to a 5tet (macrotonal) schema but not with microtonal or specialized schema and fitting methods (like what I&apos;m aiming for) far as I know.  If he wanted to I&apos;m sure he&apos;d have no problem adding tons of improvements.</p><p>&gt; When electronic musicians of producers pan two different notes<br/>&gt;to the far left and far right and it sounds clearer they take<br/>&gt;advantage similar properties.</p><p>&gt;So you move potentially beating peaks to different ears, yes?<br/>  &gt;Let me just go back to this for a sec:<br/>  More or less, I&apos;ll elaborate in detail on the other list.</p><p>&gt;The &quot;basic&quot; reason it works is it categorizes each instrument part&apos;s<br/>&gt;base harmonic and overtones</p><p>&gt;Do you mean *fundamental* and overtones,<br/>  My bad, wrong terminology, when I said &quot;base&quot; I meant &quot;fundamental&quot;<br/>  &gt;and if so, how do you know what&apos;s what for a polyphonic instrument like a piano?<br/>      I&apos;ll elaborate more later, but, basically, it assumes polyphonic bases relative to the schema rather then trying to guess/create a schema from the fundamentals (as WAV2MIDI type programs often do).</p><p>&gt;and retunes the overtones</p><p>&gt;...but not the fundamental?<br/>     Actually both, but the overtones, most often, get more tuned/shifted more than fundamentals as they are more out of tune.</p><p>&gt;to match a fairly flexible structure based on tonotopic theory (as<br/>&gt;opposed to &quot;auto-tuning&quot;, which forces base harmonics, and not<br/>&gt;overtones, to match an unflexible, often emotionally compromised scale).<br/>&gt;I guess I don&apos;t know how auto-tuning works -- They have to pitch<br/>&gt;shift everything, right (not just the fundamental), but then just<br/>&gt;apply a resonance at the formant peaks from the original??<br/>  I&apos;ll elaborate later: far as I know they shift every tone related to the instrument by constant and my code uses several independent dynamic &quot;shifters&quot;.</p><p>  BTW, if you or anyone else is using the version of the software available today and it sounds a bit dim (lacking harmonic brightness/curvature), I&apos;m releasing a version in a few days (beta 0.87) which sounds much brighter, more like the strength/brightness 0.70 production mode (which is brighter than 0.80 and 0.85) but with less disonance.</p><p>      Recent Activity</p><p>      1<br/>  New Members</p><p>Visit Your Group<br/>  SPONSORED LINKS</p><p>   Wedding musician<br/>   Musician resource<br/>   Jazz musicians<br/>   Local musician<br/>   Musician referral</p><p>      Yahoo!
