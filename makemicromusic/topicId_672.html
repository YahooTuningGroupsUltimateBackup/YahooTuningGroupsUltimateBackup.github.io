Very interestingly, I have noted that many others have<br/>&gt; these same perceptions. Paul Erlich has his 22 tET fifth @ 709.091<br/>&gt; cents,</p><p>I do like that fifth, though it can become a little<br/>troublesome (beats become a bit imposing) in the<br/>higher registers of the guitar. On the other hand,<br/>with some synth timbres, even the 667-cent fifth of<br/>9-tET can participate in some wonderful 9-tET<br/>harmonies (and note that that&apos;s a very _narrow_<br/>fifth).</p><p> Dan Stearns has spoken about the 20 tET with its<br/>fifth @ 720<br/>&gt; cents, to name a few. I would say that there is something perhaps<br/>&gt; universally alluring about the sound of a stretched fifth which is a<br/>&gt; treasure to the ears of many. To me there is a &quot;Gamelan something&quot;<br/>&gt; about it, and I feel the same way about the stretched 2/1.]</p><p>In Gamelan, one finds both stretched and<br/>compressed 2:1s and 3:2s, and they each have their<br/>charm -- not independent of the timbres used,<br/>which usually interact with the tunings to create a<br/>very specific, strong beating -- very unlike the<br/>interaction between tuning and timbre in Sethares&apos;<br/>thought . . . the point being, try everything out<br/>(and give each tuning/timbre combination plenty of<br/>time, to give it a chance to shape your brain in its<br/>own image).</p><p>I&apos;d _love_ to hear your 7-tET composition.<br/>Pentatonic scales in 7-tET sound so _real_ --<br/>they&apos;re Thai, they&apos;re blues, they&apos;re Clem Fortuna --<br/>and those _narrow_ fifths are great, aren&apos;t they?</p></div>
