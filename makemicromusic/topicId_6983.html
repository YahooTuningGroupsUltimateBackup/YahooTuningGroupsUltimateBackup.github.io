Also what an interesting idea<br/>to have a bit of a live setting like that<br/>for it.

You had so many notes of 22 tuned up that each step was &gt;the same, but Blackjack is too many??</p><p>I&apos;m probably not being clear.</p><p>When I&apos;ve tried to work with 22, I would simply load a Scala-generated 22 scale with 22 notes. I would work with it, looking (i.e. &quot;listening&quot;) to scales, and also trying to find harmonic resources as well. I didn&apos;t LIKE to have that many notes spread out in front of me, no sir. But I did want to access the full resources that 22 divisions of an octave would give me.</p><p>Am I not correct that Blackjack uses _more_ than 22 notes? I really think that anything getting to around 2 octaves or so *without* a repeating symmetry in some fashion (like maybe 18 or 24, or less notes per octave) really isn&apos;t something I&apos;m going to try and just _play_, but rather _study_ and then get going. And if I&apos;m going to have to _study_ something and compose in the old fashioned way, I&apos;m probably going to put in a nice JI fabric of some sort. Cause I&apos;m built that way, I suppose. :)</p><p>BTW, as to the comments on my &apos;oud playing&apos;, both you and Carl were _very_ clear in your comments, and I really blushed.
