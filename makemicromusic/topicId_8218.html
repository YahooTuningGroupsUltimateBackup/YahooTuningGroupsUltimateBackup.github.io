For anyone who might be interested, I uploaded a<br/>little solo excerpt. This one came from an old lesson with one of my<br/>former students, Al Clark from the mid 80s. It has a horrid sound<br/>quality and a dubious guitar tone, but I think it&apos;s a good example of<br/>what we were working on... and for lack of a better term I&apos;d call<br/>it &quot;ecstasy&quot;. The idea being what players like Hendrix and Coltrane<br/>(though I personally prefer Ayler over Coltrane myself in this sense)<br/>were going for at their most &quot;yearning&quot; and &quot;spiritualistic&quot;. Trying<br/>to teach this kind of thing is obviously folly, so what I tried to do<br/>was show by example how I liked to use microtonality and atonality in<br/>a TONAL context to achieve a sort of portal which you can try to pass<br/>through into something organic and free.</p><p>ecstasy soloing excerpt_1<br/><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p></div>
