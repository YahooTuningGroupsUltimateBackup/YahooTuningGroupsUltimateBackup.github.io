I couldn&apos;t help noticing that&apos;s almost an anagram of Tonal Hermes. But then again, maybe _you_ are Lorne Themes.</p><p>Yes those two pictures of the cabin were my doing. I&apos;ve always been the one to illustrate these stories. Of course I didn&apos;t create them, I only found them. The artists names are shown when you mouse over them and you can click them to see them in their original context. As you can see, they were entries in a &quot;photoshopping&quot; competition.

And now that it&apos;s become apparent<br/>that<br/>&gt; you are impersonating someone who is also on the list and was<br/>apparently<br/>&gt; surprised to find someone else using his name isn&apos;t it time to drop<br/>the<br/>&gt; pretense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Rick</p><p>My reply (off list, with copy to Dave Keenan), tells all in brief:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Hi Rick,</p><p>Please, don&apos;t breathe a word of this to anyone else.

The<br/>plot of the mythology, which is a gentle and entertaining tutorial<br/>for the notation, requires me to confront myself, in order to &quot;prove&quot;<br/>that the behind-the-scenes story of the Sagittal notation<br/>is &quot;absolutely true&quot;.  If you haven&apos;t read the mythology, then you<br/>really won&apos;t be able to appreciate it and will probably continue to<br/>be a bit confused.</p><p>But OTOH, we don&apos;t want you to be annoyed with us, so I&apos;m letting you<br/>in on it.

Since the mythology has the &quot;real&quot;<br/>George having as little to do as possible with computers and the<br/>Internet, he would have to go to the library to get on the Internet<br/>(and post at appropriate times), and he wouldn&apos;t be savvy enough to<br/>know, for example, what LOL means.

Methane_george would admit that he had<br/>told those at Midwest Microfest that it was a joke, but that was<br/>merely to make it less confusing and more fun for them (besides<br/>making it easier to get them to cooperate).  In fact, it really<br/>wasn&apos;t a joke, because the &quot;real&quot; George really was a newbie on MMM.<br/>The &quot;friend&quot; who had passed the word along about Midwest Microfest<br/>was none other than yours truly, the &quot;fake&quot; George, who got<br/>the &quot;real&quot; one to go along with the plan ahead of time.

(I hope your head isn&apos;t spinning too badly after all those<br/>twists and turns.)</p><p>To get the right answers, you must ask the right questions.

Fortunately, no one suggested what might have been the second<br/>most plausible explanation: that I might be suffering from a multiple<br/>personality disorder -- but Dave came close!  :-(</p><p>We had a couple of funny lines that never got used, e.g., Dave<br/>stepping in as referee in a flame war between the two Georges,<br/>cautioning the &quot;real&quot; one that &quot;people who live in gas houses<br/>shouldn&apos;t throw flames.&quot;  (As things progressed, a flame war didn&apos;t<br/>seem like a good idea.)</p><p>Anyway, thanks for being such good sports through all of this.  We<br/>expect to append an edited version of what happened here into the<br/>final episode of the mythology, or perhaps somewhere in the epilogue.</p><p>And puhleeeze do read future episodes of the mythology, as they<br/>become available.
