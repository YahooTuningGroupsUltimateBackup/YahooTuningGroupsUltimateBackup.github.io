Note: the 00417F part is all that changes. Numbers are<br/>all in hexadecimal. 00 to 0F denotes channel 1 to 16; 41 to 4C points<br/>to all Cs all C#s and so on, ending with 4C  for all the Bs; next is<br/>the pitch adjustment: 00 = -63 cents 40 = 0 cents 7F=+63 cents. If<br/>one could set up a table like a spread sheet to help remember the<br/>relationships that would be great.  Scala does something like a table<br/>but I can&apos;t figure out how.  I&apos;ve tried:  SET SYNTH  107 and SET<br/>SYNTH 1<br/>SEND  F043104C0800417FF7  without much success.  Would someone please<br/>help?</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Jim Nagy</p></div>
