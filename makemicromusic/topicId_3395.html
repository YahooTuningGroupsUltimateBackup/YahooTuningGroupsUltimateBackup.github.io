I made a 2 minute section of it, converted to mp3, and<br/>uploaded. If you hear any pops or clicks, it will probably only be<br/>when you reach the end of the 2 min, upon which your mp3 play should<br/>be set to loop.</p><p>Kraig, Paul, or anyone else can comment as they see fit...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
