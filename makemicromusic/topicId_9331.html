All without bouncing.</p><p>I understand that this may be the platform that you are invested in, but Sonar + any of a number of soft insts completely fills the bill, without any of the workarounds and limitations you mention. Does Logic not have the ability to use VST instruments?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I was mainly replying to the concept of what the &quot;best current way&quot; to make microtonal might be. And there are probably a few &quot;best&quot; ways!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Justin White &#x3C;JUSTINTONATION@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2005 9:33:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Charles thanks for your response.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;makemicro@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are wanting to produce professional/commercial microtonal music,<br/>&gt; Logic is certainly the best current way to do it, from my experience<br/>&gt; There are some kracks out there for the last M$ version 5, but to make<br/>&gt; the microtuning really easy you need to go for Logic 7, which requires<br/>&gt; a Mac G3 or higher running OSX (best on G5 dual with extra RAM) and a<br/>&gt; legit. dongle.</p><p>Okay I have a G4 400 mhz machine.</p><p>&gt; There is some info. + downloads about how to do the tuning here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>I&apos;ll check out the link.</p><p>&gt; The limitation is that you can only use a max of 12 notes per octave at<br/>&gt; any one time via the tuning settings for your virtual instruments and<br/>&gt; pitch correction etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The workaround is to bounce to audio for one tuning assignment, change<br/>&gt; the tuning settings, bounce other tracks for second/third/etc tuning<br/>&gt; assignments, then mix the various audio tracks.</p><p>Okay I was just planning to use a third party virtual synth like the Cantor thing from<br/>virsyn.</p><p>But it is good to know that you you can retune Logics synths.</p><p>&gt; The stated resolution is to nearest tenth of a cent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am currently running Logic 7.0.1, which has a few bugs still,  but<br/>&gt; there are workarounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The main current limitation is that you can only run one sound card at<br/>&gt; a time as AU audio is set up at present, but it does surround sound<br/>&gt; perfectly, and is great for video/film sync using QuickTime video.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But beware it has a STEEP learning curve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The many logic user groups are very responsive and helpful.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m have Logic installed on one G5 dual 2.0 MHz 4Gig Ram 250GB HD +<br/>&gt; 500GB outboard HD and two G4 400 MHz, which are all linked on a LAN +<br/>&gt; WiFi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can sample, then throw away, all your old synths, samplers, efx<br/>&gt; boxes, filters etc. Logic makes them all obsolete.</p><p>What type of audio/midi interface/s are you using?</p><p>&gt; To produce pro music, hardware required is a Mac G5 +  good six or more<br/>&gt; channel sound card or similar + a midi in through a decent keyboard +<br/>&gt; useful item is a six or more channel mixer + microphones and electric<br/>&gt; and acoustic instruments + build/collect yourself a good sample<br/>&gt; library.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope this is helpful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It will even (horrors of horrors) microtune JI (if that&apos;s your bag) -;)</p><p>;-) I saw a drama about longitude Harrison.
