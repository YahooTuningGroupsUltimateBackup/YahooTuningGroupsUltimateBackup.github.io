I&apos;ve posted another version of the piece, with a<br/>different set of random choices at my Soundclick site here:<br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/prentrodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/prentrodgers</a></p><p>I like the balloon drums too, but they tend to obscure the harmonies<br/>if I turn them up too much. I&apos;ll do more with them in the future. The<br/>oboe sonorities are fascinating. The version on SoundClick sounds more<br/>like a bagpipe than an oboe. You are correct that I extend the<br/>tonality diamond to the 15 limit in this piece. The arpeggio you<br/>mentioned is 4:5:6:7:9:11:13:15:16. The first four are eighth notes,<br/>the next four sixteenth, and last note held through the next measure.</p><p>Thanks for the comments.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 1.
