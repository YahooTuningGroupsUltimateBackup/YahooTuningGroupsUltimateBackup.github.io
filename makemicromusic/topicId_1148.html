They are:</p><p>   Jay07.mp3:  The Forest Medieval<br/>   Jay08a.mp3: Renaissance Fair (112k bits/sec or Yahoo sez it&apos;s too<br/>               big; the cutoff is 5120k bytes, they say...)</p><p>Together with the piece previously uploaded (Jay09.mp3, The Mishandled<br/>Blacksmith), these comprise The Music History Suite.</p><p>Again I have tuned the piano part to adaptive 7-limit, but with a twist:<br/>Jay sent them to me way back in fall 1999, when my leisure retuning<br/>program was _way_ more primitive than it is now (I hadn&apos;t yet dreamed up<br/>the spring matrix, much less programmed it).  So far he hasn&apos;t taken me<br/>up on my offer to redo these, and I&apos;m not complaining: I think the music<br/>is wonderful and the tuning vivid.  There are, however, a few places<br/>where even my very bent ear kind of puckers up.  Intervals are precise<br/>JI and drift control is sometimes...  well, you&apos;ll hear!</p><p>As before, Jay is playing acoustic trombone with piano accompaniment.<br/>Enjoy!</p><p>   <a href="/tuning-challenges/files/">/tuning-challenges/files/</a></p><p>JdL</p></div>
