I like 5 tet<br/>because the fingering is really easy (just 1,3 1,3 all the way up), it sounds good and there<br/>are some nice sounding chords as well. We&apos;re going to make the amps too, and some<br/>electric percussion with piezo transducers.<br/><a href="http://www.runoffgroove.com/ruby.html">http://www.runoffgroove.com/ruby.html</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ubertar/amp">www.geocities.com/ubertar/amp</a></p><p>I&apos;m really psyched to hear what these kids will come up with. I&apos;m hoping to have<br/>them record a cd by the end of the school year.</p><p>I made a series of electric guitars recently that are each tuned to a different<br/>equal tuning. I&apos;m planning on recording a cd featuring them but have to finish another cd<br/>first as well as other projects, but hopefully I&apos;ll get to that soon.</p><p>I made my first microtonal guitar in 1992, with movable &quot;gut&quot; frets, but later made it<br/>fretless. I put a steel fingerboard on it and intended to make magnetic frets, but got<br/>caught up in other projects and never got around to it.</p></div>
