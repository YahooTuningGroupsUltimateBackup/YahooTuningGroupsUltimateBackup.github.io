What I&apos;m<br/>looking for is something that will really give me numbers of the partials<br/>and their relative amplitudes.</p><p>CoolEdit has a real-time facility for showing FFT, but it doesn&apos;t give<br/>this kind of exact breakdown, and it&apos;s impossible to get partial numbers<br/>out of it... I&apos;m looking for something that gives a nice discrete graph<br/>like above, not with actual frequencies, but as a list of partials. (Oh,<br/>this is for Windows, not Mac or Unix.)</p><p>Thanks,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=4580 href="#4580">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2003 1:10:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if anyone out there has a tool, or knows a tool, preferrably  &gt; free or shareware, that can do that for a piece of a WAV file.
