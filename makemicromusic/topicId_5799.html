After doing that, I did it again with<br/>intruments changed so as not to be pure sine waves. Things were<br/>looking well, but then I found that after experimenting with other<br/>settings, I could never after get it to produce a wav file which<br/>played, and which WaveGain would not say had an error.</p><p>I got so frustrated I downloaded a different version of Csound and<br/>tried to use that. No luck! I can&apos;t find it, but somewhere or other<br/>it has stored some information inimical to the process of rendering a<br/>file, and refuses to let go of it.</p><p>The sad thing is, this is typical of Csound, one of the most user-<br/>unfriendly programs you will ever find.</p><p>If I can ever get it to work again, I think Herman&apos;s midi files might<br/>be interesting to do with Setherized partials. If I can make it all<br/>work, and Herman agrees (Herman?) I might put up some ogg files for<br/>the results.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2004 6:47:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; If I can ever get it to work again, I think Herman&apos;s midi files might &gt; be interesting to do with Setherized partials.

I&apos;ve had some good results with using Cool Edit to filter out individual partials from samples and retune them to fit 15-ET and 16-ET tunings: my final version of the Mizarian Porcupine Overture used this technique.</p><p>ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/hmiller/music/porcupine-overture.mp3</p><p>I used to have a page on my web site to the effect that anything on there is free to use for any reasonable non-commercial purposes. I&apos;m not sure what happened to that page, but it&apos;s still applicable: I won&apos;t have any objections if anyone wants to retune my MIDI files.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2004 7:02:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p> I can&apos;t find it, but somewhere or other<br/>&gt; it has stored some information inimical to the process of rendering<br/>a<br/>&gt; file, and refuses to let go of it.</p><p>It turns out that the real problem is that the output device got<br/>reset.
