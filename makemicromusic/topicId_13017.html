And, one of the reasons is that, for the most part, they really aren&apos;t in the same place every time...they are very flexible, and that&apos;s because blues is done totally from a feeling state...so, depending on a player&apos;s mood at the moment, the blue notes may wind up in various positions. Actually, I was just working on this yesterday with a student...and to my way of thinking, the space between two notes is vast, and you can do a lot with bending/sliding. And often, a player/singer will hit a note a bit flat to the fretted note, and this is where the deep tension and feeling of the blues resides.<br/>   What&apos;s really fascinating is how the blues scale (C Eb F Gb G Bb) pits a minor third and flat 5 against a dominant 7th chord, which has a natural 3rd and 5th...and because of the great rock and blues guitarists (and others of course) that we&apos;ve all heard many times, we&apos;re used to this sound. But, in terms of traditional European based &quot;classical&quot; music, it&apos;s a really whacked concept...and, if you examine traditional European based music, you won&apos;t find the blues/minor pentatonic type sound anywhere. It&apos;s definitely African based, with a strong dose of Arabic influence, especially in the vocals.<br/>   If you asked me to show you, on guitar, some bends, I can put a note exactly where I want it every time...but, I don&apos;t know, intellectually, the ratios I&apos;m hitting...and, I don&apos;t care much, either...it&apos;s the doing of it that&apos;s important. I&apos;m reading a very interesting book on blues, by Gerhard Kubik, &quot;Africa and the Blues,&quot; which not only delves into the African (and Arabic) roots of blues, but has a lot of info on how African musicians perceive pitch, and it&apos;s way different from European based music.<br/>   In all the years (35) that I&apos;ve been playing blues, and after reading hundreds of interviews with manymany blues musicians, I&apos;ve yet to see one of them talk about pitch, or where they put notes, in ratio terms. Oops, one exception was Mike Bloomfield, who, although he didn&apos;t mention ratios, did talk about string bending (referring to Ravi Shankar and Hendrix), and how there were numerous microtones between the frets, and a good player could hit those teensy notes...it was many years ago that I read this, but Bloomfield was super hip, and could talk in great depth about complex subjects, I learned a lot from him as a kid getting started.<br/>   Perhaps the greatest string benders on guitar were Albert King and Roy Buchanan...get Albert&apos;s &quot;Live at the Fillmore,&quot; and Roy&apos;s 1st CD for some hair raising string bending. It&apos;s a great topic, glad you brought it up...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>  <a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
