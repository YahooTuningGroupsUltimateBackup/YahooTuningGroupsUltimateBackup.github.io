Well,<br/>earlier today I exchanging e-mail with Peter Frazer, the author of<br/>Midicode... so this evening I ran the same piece of music through Midicode<br/>with patches that I designed. Here it is:</p><p><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/Midicode-Prelude-2003-02-25.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/Midicode-Prelude-2003-02-25.mp3</a></p><p>Details: This was made with Midicode standalone, without post-processing<br/>or external effects. I ran the output of Finale through Midi Yoke to<br/>Midicode, then recorded the output with CoolEdit. The ensemble here is a<br/>little different, and has a somewhat more intitimate flavor.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
