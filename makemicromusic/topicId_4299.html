I managed to<br/>&gt; &gt; change the order of the keys so that I now have 22-tone keyboard<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; 44 keys in Steve Reszutek&apos;s layout. The only thing I needed was a<br/>&gt; &gt; screwdriver! After removing the keys (which was easy) I reassembled<br/>&gt; &gt; them in this order:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C/F, black, C/F, black, G, black, A, Black, B/E, Black, B/E<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This was repeated four times until I ran out of suitable keys. No<br/>&gt; &gt; filing of the keys was required. I covered the remaining five empty<br/>&gt; &gt; keyslots with anti-static plastic which came from a plastic bag for<br/>&gt; &gt; computer components. I&apos;m very satisfied with the result. It looks<br/>&gt; &gt; pretty decent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; all i can say is, wow. some people thought steve was insane for doing<br/>&gt; this, kudos to you for doing it to. what i think would be very<br/>&gt; helpful to others would be a *photograph* of your finished product --<br/>&gt; as a sort of &quot;proof of concept&quot;. could i beg you to take such a<br/>&gt; photograph and upload it here? i might be the next to go &quot;insane&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=4301 href="#4301">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2003 1:42:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one was really into the 9 vs 13 thing in 22<br/>&gt;  you could have ....<br/>&gt; (w = white<br/>&gt; b=black)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  w w b w b w w b w b w w b w b  w w b w b w b</p><p>there are many fine scales in 22 . . . another is herman miller&apos;s<br/>porcupine scale, which i had used in my piece &quot;glassic&quot; -- on the<br/>black keys there are four 5-limit triads and an 8:9:10:11:12, nice<br/>chromatic links through the 7-limit:</p><p>w w w b w w b w w b w w b w w b w w b w w b</p><p>also graham breed&apos;s magic scale is pretty loaded with good<br/>stuff . . . magic works in 19, 41, 60, etc. as well as 22. this has<br/>the major third (7/22 oct.) as generator -- see if you can work out<br/>what b/w arrangements this implies.</p><p>but one is probably going to rearrange the keys on one&apos;s keyboard<br/>only once, or at most once for each tuning system . . . but hell, i<br/>don&apos;t want any screwdriver-happy musicians to be discouraged from<br/>daily rearrangements of their keys!</p></div>
