Please, I think you are more savvy than that. And, for that matter, *this* list is for people who actually *want* to be practical, who actually want to *make* music, not write about making music. It is not superior, it is different, and it is very valid.</p><p>&gt;If this continues, I will quit every list where I see it occuring...</p><p>That would be a loss to the community, as the variety and number of voices are what gives it the richness. Maybe better would be to step back for a minute, and in a relaxed manner have us all examine what the [perceived] problem is. You and I work at the task of &apos;composing&apos; in very different ways, and yet you and I are more alike then you and many of the others on this list, as well as how different *I* am from others on this list.</p><p>Feel free to discuss this stuff, because you should feel comfortable on a list dedicated to **making** music since you are a composer.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/15/2001 6:42:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
