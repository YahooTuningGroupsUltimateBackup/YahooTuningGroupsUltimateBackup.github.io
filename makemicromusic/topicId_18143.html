But I&apos;ve also used (at work) some top-notch<br/>&gt; software and I can attest that &quot;there is a difference&quot;.</p><p>Hey Carl, I&apos;m just busting your chops a little for your blanket<br/>comment....</p><p>Anyway, I think I can say that the most important thing is not<br/>necessarily the tools but how they are used...the proof is how we<br/>often make technical improvements, and then often desire &apos;retro&apos;<br/>sounds for aesthetic &apos;cache&apos; reasons. I think cool music can be often<br/>made with cheap-o equipment, including legacy crappy soundcards. Of<br/>course the music must match the aesthetic...I wouldn&apos;t want Bach this<br/>way, but some cool microtonal self-consciously cheezy robot techno<br/>could be great this way!</p><p>With soundfonts, I think the real limitation is often that the<br/>distributed fonts are of low quality and realism due to trying to make<br/>everything loop in a really short time...the highest quality fonts I<br/>have heard have no looping or really large loops, and at the very<br/>least, if short, painstakingly chosen short loops. Of course this<br/>usually means that most GM fonts are out of the question--to do<br/>anything of quality, I think one should collect together some large<br/>custom fonts for each instrument desired, each made up of long<br/>samples, and if necessary b/c of memory limitations, one can overdub.<br/>I think this tend to be the difference between most sf2 files and<br/>.giga files---raw size...so I think it&apos;s not as much a flaw of sf2 as<br/>much as the culture of how they tend to be employed.</p><p>I&apos;m experimenting for instance with a horn font that uses the Iowa<br/>university anechoic samples...it&apos;s interesting how realistic one can<br/>get with care...and there&apos;s no comparing the sounds I&apos;m getting with<br/>your average GM horn sound, because the GM sets, in order to pack 128<br/>presets, save memory by looping really soon into each sample, and you<br/>get this awfully cheap &apos;wavetable sound&apos; so often...the most realism<br/>comes with the large scale variability and &apos;chaos&apos; of the performer&apos;s<br/>air pressure, and this is usually only captured with a large loop. It<br/>would take an ace font artist to conjure this effect with a small loop.</p><p>re: convolution impulses--what format uses them? I usually do reverb<br/>through a plugin or &apos;post-production&apos; in an editor, so I&apos;m less<br/>concerned about that--I tend to be quite modular with tools. DLS, by<br/>the way, is the MIDI manufacturers new standard, but it for whatever<br/>reason, hasn&apos;t got the mindshare that sf2 or even sfz have.</p><p>Having said all this, you areright that the newer formats and engines<br/>are adding new innovative features that blow sf2 out of the<br/>water---like I mentioned, the phase transitioning of Garritan&apos;s new<br/>cello product. But this does not mean we can&apos;t still sqeeze more juice<br/>from sf2...</p><p>On other thing I noticed deserves mention: the problem with a lot of<br/>these commercial products is poor or nonexistant support for<br/>microtuning. So you have great sound, but you have to jump through<br/>hoops...</p><p>-AKJ.</p></div><h3><a id=18160 href="#18160">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2007 9:14:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;re: convolution impulses--what format uses them?
