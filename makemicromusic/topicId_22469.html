And, to my ears at least (using a clarinet as a test instrument), there is no doubt my scale sounds significantly more stable, but I&apos;m obviously aesthetically biased toward my scale.<br/>--------<br/>   Anyhow Here&apos;s the challenge: compose a 6-chord progression + bass-line + lead melody + background melody in BP...basically &quot;just&quot; a full verse.<br/>  Then turn around and try to fit it to my scale (not necessarily hit around the same frequencies, but rather do whatever modifications on the original you need to make the version in my scale hit the intended mood of the version in the BP scale).</p><p>  I would like to see the results of how far others can get so far as making my BP-imitation scale sound competitive with BP...and if it doesn&apos;t even get close then (well)...guess I just don&apos;t have a good mind for composing in BP and need much more practice (or have odd aesthetic preferences against BP).<br/>&apos;-----------------------<br/>   Here are the tones in my &quot;Inverse BP&quot; scale (note it only has 8-tones and not BP&apos;s 9 tones):</p><p>1/1<br/>8/7<br/>11/9<br/>7/5<br/>5/3<br/>21/11<br/>15/7<br/>27/11<br/>3/1 (tri-tave)</p><p>Have fun, Mike</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2010 8:22:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am confused.</p><p>Which BP are you referring to with 9 steps?</p><p>&quot;Bohlen originally expressed the BP scale in both just intonation and<br/>equal temperament.
