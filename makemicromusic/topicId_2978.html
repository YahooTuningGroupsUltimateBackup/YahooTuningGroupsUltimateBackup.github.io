I&apos;m not aware of any microtuning capability in Absynth.<br/>&gt;I was likewise impressed with Midicode&apos;s built in tuning support. It is<br/>&gt;very well done.</p><p>I&apos;ve recently been using Bitheadz Unity Session. It allows arbitrary<br/>retunings via a (text editable) tuning table. Its not the most elegant<br/>solution, but it does seem to work. Session&apos;s integration is well done<br/>as well - after a few false starts I was able to run Performer<br/>(a sequencer) into Max, and then into Session, and then route the sound<br/>back into Performer - all at once.</p><p>The downside is that this seriously stresses a G3/500 mac and<br/>only works for a few voices at once. The workaround is to record<br/>a few voices, make some new ones, record them, etc...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=2986 href="#2986">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/16/2002 4:34:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; Seriously though - this is the way I usually have to work with these<br/>&gt; things, and my CPU is well over twice this. There&apos;s just no way (yet)<br/>&gt; to use these softsynths in the manner that one would sequence<br/>&gt; hardware synths to have a whole arrangement going at once. I can<br/>&gt; sequence 32 tracks of midi on my 2 port card, but my machine would<br/>&gt; collapse trying to do it with softsynths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there&apos;s anyone doing full arrangements without having to render<br/>&gt; the tracks as audio, I&apos;d like to know what kind of monster machine<br/>&gt; they are using. I think eventually we&apos;ll get there though, but until<br/>&gt; then, I&apos;m ecstatic (Hey Mike!!!) to be working with all this.</p><p>A base Kyma system can do around 40 voices of no-frills sampling.  I can get 32 voices from a guitar<br/>sample with guitar effects.  One of the synths I&apos;ve been working on tonight with an audio-speed envelope<br/>and vibrato can only manage 5 voices at 48 kHz along with a filter and fairly good reverb covering all<br/>voices.  Extrapolating that up to 32 voices would mean around 8 expansion cards.  Less if you keep the<br/>reverb global, more if you want to do other clever stuff.</p><p>The mono legato problem&apos;s been half solved as well.  You can always have the highest or lowest note<br/>sounding, but not the most recent.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=3015 href="#3015">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/20/2002 10:20:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;acb6p5+t5ic@...&gt;<br/>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; A base Kyma system can do around 40 voices of no-frills sampling.<br/>&gt; I can get 32 voices from a guitar<br/>&gt; &gt; sample with guitar effects.</p><p>Jacky:<br/>&gt; Sounds like a great tool. With that, one could seemingly do a pretty<br/>&gt; full arrangement. Now in this scenario, how complex would the timbres<br/>&gt; be?</p><p>Sampling is any timbre you like, but always the same one with linear<br/>interpretation.  The guitar sample with guitar effects is the melody line<br/>on my magic demo, see &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/music/">http://x31eq.com/music/</a>&gt; if you&apos;ve<br/>forgotten.</p><p>The numbers aren&apos;t that great.  Note, though that Symbolic Sound claim 60<br/>voices for a basic system</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.symbolicsound.com/FAQ.html#anchor1689563">http://www.symbolicsound.com/FAQ.html#anchor1689563</a>&gt;</p><p>whereas I can actually get 40 working.  It&apos;s less than the claim made<br/>about Reaktor with a standard PC.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; One of the synths I&apos;ve been working on tonight with an audio-speed<br/>&gt; envelope<br/>&gt; &gt; and vibrato can only manage 5 voices at 48 kHz along with a filter<br/>&gt; and fairly good reverb covering all<br/>&gt; &gt; voices.</p><p>Jacky:<br/>&gt; What are the chances that you might be able to let us hear this? I&apos;d<br/>&gt; love to check it out.</p><p>It&apos;ll escape sometime.  The synthesis algorithm is the one used in my<br/>IOCDrum piece, and in the decimal counterpoint examples.  That&apos;s without<br/>vibrato or reverb and does 20 voices.</p><p>Jacky:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll bet 8 expansion cards would make one go bank-broke though -<br/>&gt; right?</p><p>It depends on what you have in your bank.  If you&apos;re John Paul Jones, you<br/>can carry two fully loaded systems on tour with you.  The figures are:</p><p>$3300 for a basic system<br/>$595 per expansion card<br/>about $100 for delivery within the US</p><p>That makes, phew, $8160.  For the difference it makes, you may as well<br/>have the $270 firewire interface to make it $8330.</p><p>The prices haven&apos;t changed over the past four years (although firewire is<br/>new) so it is behind commodity hardware of equivalent power.  Good luck on<br/>finding software to match.</p><p>&gt; Oh - this is good, and useful. So it&apos;ll allow you to use portamento<br/>&gt; on your mono-voices to get woodwind-like gestures?</p><p>You can do portamento, yes.</p><p>&gt; What do you have to do to tune it up? How complicated is it?</p><p>It&apos;s all done with Smalltalk expressions.  I give a fairly complex example<br/>at &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/miracle/keyboard.html#kyma">http://x31eq.com/miracle/keyboard.html#kyma</a>&gt;.  For a static<br/>tuning table, something like</p><p>!Pitch is: (<br/>  &grave;MIDIKeyNumber -60 //12 * 15<br/>  + (<br/>    (&grave;MIDIKeyNumber - 60 mod: 12)<br/>    of: { #(-1 0 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 12 13)}<br/>  )<br/>  &quot;corrected to give pure 24-note octaves&quot;<br/>  + (&grave;MIDIKeyNumber -60 //24)<br/>* 12/31) nn + 4c nn + (!PitchBend*2) nn.</p><p>which is also more complex than it need be because there was a bug<br/>stopping 24 element arrays working when I originally wrote it.</p><p>I can&apos;t remember how portamento works, but you can do it.  Probably add<br/>smoothing to the pitch parameter.  Basic legato is an option on the<br/>envelope.  The trick for getting the highest note to re-sound when you<br/>lift up a lower key is complex.  It was given in a recent example.<br/>Hopefully, if enough of us ask for it, it can be built into the<br/>MidiMapper.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=3031 href="#3031">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/21/2002 2:32:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;acbisp+b9te@...&gt;<br/>jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ah - so it is able to do a kind of &apos;resynthesis&apos;? So this would mean<br/>&gt; that one cannot assign samples freely to keygroups in the manner of a<br/>&gt; hardware sampler?</p><p>You can do that.  I don&apos;t usually because I don&apos;t like abrupt changes in<br/>timbre when you change keygroups.  So I don&apos;t know how it affects the<br/>polyphony.  There are a whole load of other sampling algorithms that take<br/>up a lot more of the processor.  You can record a high note and a low note<br/>and morph between them.  Or you can hold the formant envelope constant<br/>while changing the pitch -- this works well with live vocals.  It also<br/>does granular resynthesis with a lot of variations, which really needs a<br/>better system than mine.</p><p>&gt; How does the resampling sound as you play up in the higher ranges?</p><p>The notes get shorter if you&apos;ve only got one sample.  I&apos;ve never seen this<br/>as a problem.</p><p>&gt; Not a possibility. Try not to buy gear that cost more than the car I<br/>&gt; drive!</p><p>I couldn&apos;t have afforded the base system *and* a car, but I obviously have<br/>different priorities to you.</p><p>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Interesting. So when you do this, are you interfacing your computer<br/>&gt; to the Kyma, or other?</p><p>There&apos;s software running on the computer that lets you edit the presets.<br/>Then it compiles to DSP machine code and loads it into the Capybara.  If<br/>you don&apos;t want to change presets, you can shut down the PC software so it<br/>gets out of the way of other things you have running.  So long as you<br/>aren&apos;t streaming from the hard disk or anything like that.  The firewire<br/>box is supposed to remember the preset so you don&apos;t need a laptop for live<br/>work, although I&apos;m not sure of the details and may have misunderstood.</p><p>Any parameters you want to change in real time can be wired up to MIDI<br/>faders.</p><p>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; This is a fascinating issue. Robert Walker and I had some discussion<br/>&gt; a while back about the trouble with doing this with GM synths. If one<br/>&gt; can&apos;t hold down one key, and trill above or below the held down note<br/>&gt; without retriggering the attack of the sample, then it is not doing<br/>&gt; real mono-legato. In an acoustic instrument analogy, imagine how bad<br/>&gt; it would sound to do trills on real a trumpet or flute, and have the<br/>&gt; attack sound at the beginning of every note. My old analogs do it<br/>&gt; naturally, as do the TX series synths, but most GM modules are simply<br/>&gt; incapable of mono-legato, making them for all practical purposes<br/>&gt; useless for either emulating the sound of early analog synths, or<br/>&gt; monophonic wind instruments. Not only is this important for these<br/>&gt; things, but overall, it is a very important musical effect or<br/>&gt; gesture. Of course, there is some utility in the &apos;note-on-note-<br/>&gt; off/retrigger the attack on every note&apos; type synths. One may need to<br/>&gt; mix them with other and more capable modules to keep things<br/>&gt; interesting though.</p><p>Kyma does have this &quot;legato&quot; option in the standard envelope to stop<br/>retriggering.  But the trigger doesn&apos;t have to be on a key down anyway.<br/>You can trigger on a sustain pedal and only use the key presses for pitch<br/>information if you like.  Or use a pedal to turn legato mode on and off.</p><p>Remembering the other keys held down is harder, because the onboard<br/>Smalltalk compiler doesn&apos;t have any kind of queue structure.  I&apos;m hoping<br/>when my ZTar arrives (whenever that&apos;ll be) I&apos;ll find it resends note-ons<br/>and I don&apos;t have to worry about it.  I&apos;m guessing the problem would<br/>similarly disappear with a wind controller.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
