Cris had just written me as you posted the above message, and I urge anyone on the list involved in acoustic instruments (heck, *anyone*) to take a look. I know Cris&apos; work first-hand, having worked with him a number of years ago. Many people have made microtonal instruments; few, if any, have made them better or more beautifully. They really are remarkable!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3610 href="#3610">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2002 12:56:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Chalmers wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Cris Forster, who designs and builds beautifully crafted acoustic<br/>&gt; instruments tuned to 13-limit JI, etc. has placed pictures of his<br/>&gt; remarkable instruments, his theoretical writings, etc. on the web at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a>.<br/>&gt; Take a look..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --John</p><p>Oh well - back to the drawing board...............</p></div><h3><a id=3614 href="#3614">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
