One reason is just the quality<br/>of the samples and amount of multisampling (and work) is just higher<br/>in EastWest, and another is that in high-end programs like VSL they<br/>have extra 100-millisecond long samples that they tack on to represent<br/>the subtle nuances in tone that real orchestral instruments will give<br/>when playing legato lines. So if I&apos;m on a flute and I go from C to D,<br/>they&apos;ll have a tiny sample play between the two to connect the line<br/>better. I believe EastWest does the same thing, but I don&apos;t think as<br/>well as VSL.</p><p>All I know is, if I use EWQL, things usually sound good right off the<br/>bat, and if I use my Motif they don&apos;t. If I use my Motif, I&apos;ll be<br/>layering a horn line with a saxophone and a sawtooth wave to try and<br/>get a &quot;real&quot; trumpet sound or something. EWQL&apos;s usually sound pretty<br/>decent right away.

The difference is Always plain to the ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You just can&apos;t output a midi file to an orchestral sample orchestra,<br/>&gt; whether it is Garritan, East/West, LSO, or any of the others, and<br/>&gt; expect the silver bullet to pierce your score.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IMHO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2008 12:24:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot;<br/>&lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s all well and good in theory, but in theory, theory and practice<br/>&gt; are the same, and in practice, they&apos;re different.</p><p>But you didn&apos;t say anything that would convince me otherwise: the<br/>sound of the samples is not the issue.
