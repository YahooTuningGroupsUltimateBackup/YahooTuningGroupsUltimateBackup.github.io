For me, the tuning theory is very interesting, and it&apos;s a study I will pursue the rest of my life. But music, and the feelings connected with making it, comes first to me, and how I got to the final result is not that important, in the long run. Getting into other tunings can help me discover new worlds in my playing/composing, and that&apos;s why I do it.<br/>   But, I am aware that it&apos;s a big world, and there&apos;s many reasons why people do what they do. I&apos;m sure the theory/math involved with tunings is a deep pursuit for many of the people here, and that&apos;s fine by me. The making of real music is not as important to some people as it is to others, no big deal. I never confuse tuning theory with sound/music, because they actually have nothing to do with each other, in the sense that a brilliant theorist may be a not so brilliant musician/composer, and a great musician may not know squat about theory, on an intellectual level.<br/>   I just finished a biography of Django Reinhardt, a genius if there ever was one, and he was illiterate (he finally learned enough to write a couple of letters late in his life). Yet, he played some of the greatest guitar music in history, and didn&apos;t have a clue, intellectually, about keys and music theory...he heard it inside, and could play it rather well. He continually flabbergasted all who heard or played with him, and rarely found a musician who was his equal (maybe Dizzy Gillespie was one of the few, along with Ellington). Wes Montgomery, from what I&apos;ve heard, couldn&apos;t even follow chord charts, and yet was another genius of music.<br/>   I understand Dan&apos;s mild frustration about 32 posts that didn&apos;t even comment on the actual music...but, after all the years I&apos;ve been on these tuning forums, I have to say that I&apos;m not surprised, and again, it&apos;s not a big deal. I don&apos;t think that sound/music is what they are about, overall, and I don&apos;t expect them to be. But, I enjoy a lot of the posts, and will, as always, continue to learn about the ever more subtle world of tunings from those here...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>  <a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
