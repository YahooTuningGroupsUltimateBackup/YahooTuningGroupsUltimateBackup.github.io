For some great non-equal viol consort performances,<br/>check out</p><p><a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/phantasm">http://magnatune.com/artists/phantasm</a></p><p>Their Jenkins album is nice, as is their &quot;Four Temperaments&quot;<br/>album.  And who doesn&apos;t love Gibbons?</p><p>For those of you unfamiliar with magnatune (a Berkeley company<br/>founded by an acquaintance of mine), you can choose what to pay<br/>for music, with 50% going to the artist, you can download<br/>high-quality mp3, ogg, flac, or wav in most cases, and often<br/>times download album art, scores, and other goodies.  The files<br/>have creative commons licenses, and you can share them with up<br/>to 3 of your friends.  Furthermore, you can listen in 128kbps<br/>mp3 for free all day long.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
