Once purchased, you<br/>can do what you like with it including<br/>hacking it if you want, and<br/>users post hacks on their forums.<br/>It is only a one off payment.</p><p>It is used by the agents who<br/>manage the sales of my programs<br/>for me - for their own discussion<br/>forums - so I know it works<br/>well and is reliable.</p><p>Perhaps it might even be possible<br/>to hack it ourselves to make it<br/>so it will do digests though<br/>I haven&apos;t learnt enough Perl<br/>yet to want to attempt that myself.</p><p>I can see some disadvantages in going<br/>for a completely free solution -<br/>if the hosting too is to be free<br/>particularly - you may have<br/>very little in the way of contact<br/>with those who host the forum,<br/>and little feedback if anything<br/>should go wrong at all.</p><p>Also Google groups is ad supported,<br/>even if text based which is less obtrusive<br/>i agree.

Can we possibly take meta-discussion of board formats to another<br/>&gt; forum, or off-list? I would like to keep only discussions of tuning stuff,<br/>&gt; and the future home of *this* forum here...</p><p>Ok, sorry. We&apos;ve been discussing it in metatuning if anyone wants<br/>to follow it up there. I was meaning to address the matter of this<br/>forum and sorry for wandering off topic in my post.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
