Why.......lot&apos;s of reasons I&apos;m<br/>sure, and to small a sample size to conclude anything remotely<br/>rigorous either. But those are the facts. Fretless guitar is big, and<br/>unlike the inroads the fretless bass made into the mainstream family<br/>of instruments and our everyday language , a lot of the guys plugging<br/>these defretted cousins in are doing so with massively microwilted<br/>intensions--or at least results! Personally I don&apos;t fuss much over<br/>these kinds of distinctions....sounds good is good but everything<br/>that sounds good isn&apos;t necessarily so good and everything that sounds<br/>bad isn&apos;t necessarily so <a href="http://bad.You">bad.You</a> decide, I already have.</p><p>Anyway, back in the mighty day of the cassette underground the<br/>unspoken motto was &quot;anything goes&quot;. Well the spirit of the Cassette<br/>Mythos is still alive and well, and put micro tools in the hands of<br/>the people and the people will make micro music.....well I suppose a<br/>lot of people do that, right? Right. But I guess after all these<br/>years I&apos;d still have to say that as a general rule I&apos;m more<br/>interested with people who&apos;s first inclination is to make music and<br/>second inclination is to make it regardless of the fact that it&apos;s<br/>microtonal or that there are microtonalist. Ignorance isn&apos;t<br/>necessarily bliss, but it&apos;s a good first step!</p><p>Ok .This is Brad. He plays fretless. Has fun and makes lots of music.<br/>He is what I guess they call a &quot;primitive&quot;, hmm even I call him that.<br/>Primitive or not, I usually like everything he does to some extent<br/>and I&apos;m always thrilled to hear the way he keeps progressively adding<br/>more and more megatonage of microtonage as the fretless spends more<br/>and more time under his hands.</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/1/newbiebradmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/1/newbiebradmusic.htm</a></p><p>Every once in a while, depending a bit on the depravity and<br/>overstimulated state of your ears I guess, you might hear something<br/>that really blurs the lines between &quot;novice&quot; and &quot;genius&quot;. Well some<br/>week day last month in a space between punching in in the morning and<br/>punching out at night I went to the library when I was supposed to go<br/>to lunch and streamed Pengy and had a fairly recent every-once-in a-<br/>while .</p></div><h3><a id=9714 href="#9714">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2005 1:47:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:</p><p>&gt;Another forum I participate in is one for experimental guitarists. &gt;And ,as you might expect, microtonality is a frequent topic...and on &gt;the way to the promised land I&apos;ve noticed a couple interesting &gt;things.

Anyway, I don&apos;t think this is<br/>quite the same with these guys...they&apos;re all pretty &quot;out there&quot; and<br/>hardly too timid or too proud to look inept &lt;insert smile thing<br/>here&gt;. And a few them GOT refretted guitars too...but even these guys<br/>found themselves more attracted to their fretlesses than their<br/>refrets .
