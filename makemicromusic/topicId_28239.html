And I would be careful to call such piece &quot;composition&quot;, I didn&apos;t see any compositional work. It&apos;s just a boring compositional study, probably based on improvisation. I miss form, work with motifs, work with information density, maybe some contrast or surprise... He shot all trumps in the first bars and then nothing new came. There&apos;s unbalance between music material and total length. It would need more sculpting.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On Sep 30, 2011, at 4:24 AM, prentrodgers wrote:</p><p>&gt; Check this one out: <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2011/09/">http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2011/09/</a>&gt; warp-speed.html<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Delightful!

The initial melodic phrases and the following section do come back but always somewhat varied and developed.  The fact that the piece is ostinato based, and based on a vernacular improvised style, does not, in my opinion, make it less &quot;compositional&quot;; the same thing could be said of various forms of instrumental music in baroque music.<br/>And let&apos;s not forget that Kyle&apos;s piece is  part of a larger whole: it&apos;s the second, shorter movement of a two-movement piano piece (sonata?).</p><p>Juhani</p><p>There&apos;s unbalance between music material and total<br/>&gt; length.
