Quicktime&apos;s midi implementation simply ignores pitchbend &gt;&gt;instructions.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, um, OK, whatever. Wasn&apos;t talking about midi, I was merely responding &gt; to the plea of a Mac owner for an option on his machine for the playback of &gt; an audio file. And besides - what good piece of music will stand in a midi &gt; implementation alone?<br/>&gt; &gt; I understand your evangelism or campaigning, but I want to first find a &gt; solution for Kyle&apos;s dilemma, then we can address other issues. So, Mac &gt; users, what&apos;s a good .ogg player?<br/>&gt; Jon --</p><p>I can&apos;t help with the Mac question, but Midi _is_ an important format for a broad range of uses, and if any Mac (or PC, for that matter) owner only has Quicktime, then she or he is facing a legitimate deficit that ought to be pointed out.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2005 1:50:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t help with the Mac question, but Midi _is_ an important format for &gt;a broad range of uses, and if any Mac (or PC, for that matter) owner only &gt;has Quicktime, then she or he is facing a legitimate deficit that ought to &gt;be pointed out.</p><p>I certainly agree, but I also figure if someone is using midi importantly they will have good apps to utilize it, not relying on one default all-purpose audio/video app. Maybe a separate thread for Quicktime microtonal midi would be in order, including pointing out good Mac-centric midi alternatives.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
