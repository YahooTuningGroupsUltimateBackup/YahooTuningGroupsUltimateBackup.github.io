You could probably take what birds are<br/>singing and come up with a 31-tet or a 53-tet or a 72-tet<br/>approximation as well that&apos;s a bit more accurate.</p><p>I would imagine that birds don&apos;t confine themselves to a precise<br/>tuning but use the whole spectral continuum in intuitive ways. So they<br/>might use JI for particular ratios, try to hit notes right between<br/>different JI intervals to get a different effect (like neutral thirds,<br/>for example), and make use of slides, portamento, etc.</p><p>Of course, I have no idea what the hell birds are thinking, so this is<br/>just conjecture.
