I bought this instrument, and I like it a lot, but as I just posted on their KVR forum yesterday, the microtuning is seriously broken: I haven&apos;t done exhaustive testing but many of the tunings simply don&apos;t work correctly, and it may be more of that &quot;if it is more or less than 12 notes per octave it doesn&apos;t calculate correctly&quot; syndrome. I told WilliamK, the dev, that I would document it better and send him info after I finish my current composing/recording project.</p><p>I imagine it *can* be fixed, but I&apos;m not sure. This is the second or third instrument that has come about this way, and there may be a .tun format / microtuning block of source code that people are using without really understanding  microtonal implementations. I&apos;ll try and help them get it sorted out, and when/if it starts working correctly I&apos;ll report back. Until then, it is still a very interesting instrument, and the current purchase gives you tons of sounds and presets, and it is pretty light on the CPU cycles.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=10143 href="#10143">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2005 9:43:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,  you wrote:</p><p>&gt; the microtuning is  seriously broken [...]<br/>&gt; and it may be more of that &quot;if it is more or less than<br/>&gt; 12 notes per octave it doesn&apos;t calculate correctly&quot; syndrome.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen that syndrome in other synths; e.g. a pre-alpha version of one<br/>synth I was testing gave different timbres from the same settings,<br/>depending on the tuning...

Successfully fixed, of course.</p><p>Glad it got sussed out. At first I thought it was more prone in instruments that were sample-based (for instance, VSampler is still unusable, and *that* dev doesn&apos;t even know the meaning of tech support), but the recent CronoX3 synth continues good implementation of sample usage with .tun compatability.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure.

Probably some hard-coded goop that just &gt;needs to be weeded out.</p><p>Hope so. I&apos;m going to offer a handful of .tun files, mention which work and which don&apos;t, and burn some mp3s of both the broken tunings as well as correct tunings rendered with other instruments (in case they don&apos;t know what, say, 19tet should sound like!). I&apos;m kind of bummed, as I was going to do my current dance project in a tuning or two, but some of the sounds came from non-micro sources. However, this is a work-in-progress, and by the next performance I may be able to get things back into intonations I&apos;d like to mess with.</p><p>As to the synth in question - Wusikstation - the developer seems *very* responsive, so there is a good chance. I always figure that carping about microtonal support is coming from such a small niche that one can&apos;t _assume_ it will be prioritized, but you never know these days...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
