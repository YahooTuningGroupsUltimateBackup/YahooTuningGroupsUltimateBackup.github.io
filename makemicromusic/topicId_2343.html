I really enjoy the way each<br/>piece develops, as well as the very expressive pitch<br/>bends and timbral inflections from vina-like<br/>synthesized tones. Furthermore, your orchestration and<br/>sound processing is very professional. As you state,<br/>you have listened to a wide variety of non-Western<br/>music; but unlike most, you have truly internalized<br/>aspects of them to make a style of your own.</p><p>Keep it up!<br/>Harold Fortuin<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin">www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin</a></p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!

(heck, how could you answer that?) I only recently received all of Nancarrow&apos;s player piano music as a gift, and your own self-description certainly piques my interest! If you *do* have music somewhere online, would you post a link to it? And, if not, would you care to share info on how to purchase a CD?</p><p>Always enjoy a new composer...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
