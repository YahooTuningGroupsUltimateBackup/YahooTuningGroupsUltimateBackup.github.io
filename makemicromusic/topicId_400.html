Music was not period but very well done, and the rest of the production (in a beautiful outdoor setting) was sublime. I hope you have a good production as well.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=418 href="#418">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/7/2001 1:38:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
