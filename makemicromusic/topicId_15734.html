I doubtless qualify (tonality is like pornography; &quot;I know it when I see it&quot;.) and it might be of some advantage, but I&apos;m a little suspicious about special-pleading  for tonal music qua tonal music. People tend to justify their music because it&apos;s tonal (or for that matter, microtonal) when it&apos;s just bad. And writing freshly in a tonal style is more of a challenge since so many of the possibilities have been explored, and stale tonal music seems more obviously stale than stale atonal music.<br/>--<br/>Jeffrey Quick<br/><a href="http://www.en.com/users/jaquick">www.en.com/users/jaquick</a><br/><a href="http://blog.case.edu/jeffrey.quick/">http://blog.case.edu/jeffrey.quick/</a><br/>If your Renaissance band has a dumbek, the terrorists have won.</p></div><h3>aum &#x3C;aum@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2007 9:29:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeffrey Quick wrote:<br/>&gt; (tonality is like pornography; &quot;I know it when I see it&quot;.)
