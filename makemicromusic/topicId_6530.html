The pitch bend notation is the<br/>same there, but I have not used it extensively.  I have noticed, though, that Sibelius<br/>has a plugin for &quot;quartertone playback&quot; that looks for quartertone accidentals (which<br/>sibelius supports but does not automatically play back) and sticks in the necessary<br/>pitch bend.  I was thinking, couldn&apos;t someone (dangit I&apos;m probably volunteering<br/>again) write plugins that would implement pitch bends in other tunings? 17, 19 and<br/>even 31 would be easy; you could even do unequal tunings as long as the notation<br/>you want is limited to the normal plus quartertone accidentals. Anything else and I<br/>think there would be trouble.</p><p>The programming language is Sibelius&apos; own, they&apos;re apparently open to including<br/>plugins if they like what you send, and they say they&apos;ll even pay money for good ones!<br/>(Maybe I don&apos;t need a summer job...) And what better way to infiltrate mainstream<br/>music making than with &quot;Let&apos;s see what your piece sounds like in 19 equal...&quot;  (okay<br/>I&apos;ll admit there are better ways but whatever it takes to get people thinking...)</p></div><h3><a id=6533 href="#6533">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2004 12:24:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;microtonalist&quot;<br/>&lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; where nn is in the range -128 to 127.
