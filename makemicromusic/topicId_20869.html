Any idea how many there will be in total?</p><p>I&apos;ve always liked your stuff, but I recently found a new<br/>way to enjoy it.  I hardly ever listen to music while working<br/>because I get distracted by what it&apos;s doing.  But lately,<br/>with my desk crammed into the same space with a washer, dryer,<br/>dishwasher and two kids, I&apos;ve found myself using in-ear<br/>headphones just to cut the din.  But what to play?  Going<br/>through my library, I found your stuff is the best for working.<br/>There are no lyrics, which is sort of a prerequisite, but also,<br/>the slowly varying contribution of all the parts (algorithmic<br/>dixieland?) sets up a nonboring but nondistracting environment,<br/>while the smooth JI harmony lowers my blood pressure.  It&apos;s<br/>true with high-limit JI, one almost feels better physically<br/>after listening.</p><p>(I don&apos;t mean to say that one can&apos;t listen more deeply and<br/>enjoy it on that level, too.)</p><p>With these amazing (Klipsch) in-ear headphones, I&apos;ve also<br/>noticed your stuff has become incredibly hi-fi lately.<br/>I guess there&apos;s no beating pure Csound there!  It&apos;s quite<br/>impressive how you&apos;ve managed to steadily refine the<br/>subtlety of your stuff over many years.</p><p>Thanks again,</p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 09:39 PM 8/4/2009, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Carl,<br/>&gt;Here are links to 7-9.
