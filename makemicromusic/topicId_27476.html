I&apos;ve thought of a similar design the the one you&apos;re describing, that is, two hand tapping applied to a horizontal fretboard whose strings are tuned to make it, effectively, a wicki layout. (I hadn&apos;t thought of shortening the distance to the bridge to temper the whole tones of existing guitars though, which is cool. Does the math really work out?)

Using large gauges and/or high tensions to make the layout regular (and to make the instrument more compact) would compromise this goal.</p><p>Using varying gauges and having the rows of string ends close together doesn&apos;t necessarily mean stiff, inharmonic strings, if you design carefully. Given a fixed size of instrument, having (for example) Cb2 and Cb3 almost as long as Cb1, means they can be thinner strings, and therefore more harmonic.</p><p>A regular layout would limit how high the highest string is though. You wouldn&apos;t be able to play as high as the top note on a guitar (E4), but an octave below would work. It all depends on the pitch range of the instrument.

This would divide the number of strings (and the tension) by 3, but reduce polyphony. The layout of the string ends would be the same as in you image.</p><p>WOW. That is a darn good idea, and a bit of a &quot;Duh&quot; moment for me. Though you&apos;re right that it would limit polyphony to one per pitch class, I would have to build a bench to hold so many strings for the original design.</p><p>Here&apos;s an even more sloppily drawn representation of the new concept:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/John%20Moriarty/AcousticWickiV2.jpg">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/John%20Moriarty/AcousticWickiV2.jpg</a></p><p>Thanks for your ideas, I think this might be the right way to go. Range will probably be decided when I start to scale it and see what range makes for the easiest combination of gauges and lengths.</p><p>Now I need to look into what technology I&apos;ll need to make this work. Securing each string individually towards the bottom of the instrument is probably an odd thing to ask of traditional tech, right? Even finding a bridge solution for the top for 19 strings would be hard I&apos;m guessing. Maybe I should contact Marcodi about buying harpejji parts off of them? At least they have their own 24 and 16 string bridges already designed.</p><p>John M</p></div>
