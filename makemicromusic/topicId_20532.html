It has major and minor triads that are closer to just intonation than in twelve tone equal temperament. It is generally regarded as a more consonant tuning than standard twelve tone equal temperament...<br/>Here is my Rondo in minor modes for two pianos in nineteen tone equal temperament.</p><p>See also my Nocturne for two pianos in seventeen tone equal temperament.&quot;</p><p>Go and listen!</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
