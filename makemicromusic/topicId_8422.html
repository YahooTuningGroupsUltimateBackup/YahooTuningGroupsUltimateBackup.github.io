It likely would&apos;ve remained an<br/>abstraction had I not ended up at the Institute of Sonology in &apos;93-4<br/>in The Hague, Netherlands.</p><p>Anyway, I think its important that we not only conceive of tunings,<br/>but, as one&apos;s own vision requires, to BUILD the devices (mechanical<br/>&amp; virtual) to play in &apos;em. And to document what we do in audio &amp;<br/>video recordings.<br/>And even if you don&apos;t feel the need to build instrument(s), to<br/>create music with the tunings that interest you, if you have the<br/>creative urge.<br/>So go for it, Igliashon!</p><p>And when we theorize about music, it&apos;s important that we stay close<br/>enough to the listening experience,<br/>and not get too seduced by the beautiful formulas and diagrams we<br/>can make, which can even<br/>obscure some important aspects of the listening experience. For<br/>example, I personally find a strict<br/>&quot;n-limit&quot; way of thinking about intervals and tunings to be too<br/>detached from listening realities.<br/>For these reasons I haven&apos;t found it useful to become more than a<br/>casual observer of<br/>most tuning mathematics.</p><p>Well, I guess I&apos;ve also managed to summarize why I&apos;m on this list,<br/>and not say on tuning-math.<br/>But I&apos;m glad we live in a web-verse where the various viewpoints can<br/>inform each other.</p><p>Constructively yours,<br/>Harold</p></div>
