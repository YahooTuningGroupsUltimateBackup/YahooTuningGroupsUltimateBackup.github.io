Here I&apos;m<br/>going to focus on some ideas for a sagittal notation file for<br/>Peppermint 24, which I guess could be named -ipepper24.txt or the<br/>like.</p><p>[Please note that in the next couple of days I hope that I might be<br/>closer to understanding the implementation problem, since your helpful<br/>posts and e-mails have filled me in on some helpful procedures and the<br/>new release may provide opportunities for experimentation. Here I&apos;m<br/>mainly explaining the musical context of Peppermint and some of the<br/>equivalent sagittal spellings that I describe. I give a basic<br/>keyboard diagram with a few basic symbols, and then some examples<br/>where equivalents might be helpful. I&apos;m trying to catch on the<br/>material you&apos;ve so helpfully posted and e-mailed in the last couple of<br/>days.]</p><p>Here&apos;s a table of symbols with some information about Peppermint<br/>interval sizes with reference to C.0 or midi note 60. It&apos;s not code,<br/>but a kind of &quot;pseudocode&quot; that might help in approaching some actual<br/>code for abc utilities including the microabc release and related<br/>programs.</p><p>One of my problems is that at this point I&apos;m not sure which notation<br/>or abc-related programs would be best to use -- for example, whether<br/>cat is still required (one thing I saw suggested otherwise now) or<br/>abcpp. I&apos;ve included both ASCII sagittal notation and decimal codes in<br/>the following table of symbols for Peppermint 24, under the<br/>understanding that either style of coding could be helpful depending<br/>on the chosen approach.</p><p>Note that Peppermint mainly approximates integer ratios based on odd<br/>factors of 2-3-7-9-11-13, but here and there has approximations of<br/>other factors such as 5 and 17.</p><p>index  ASCII Sag name(s)  Decimal codes    cents   JI approximations<br/>0       C        .        ^/144C   .       0.000         1/1<br/>1      C/|\    D!!!)      ^/168C _/80D    58.680  28/27 33/32 1053/1024<br/>2      C/||\     .        ^/196C   .     128.669        14/13<br/>3      C/|||\   D!)       ^/220C _/132D  187.349  10/9 392/351 19/17<br/>4       D        .        ^/144D   .     208.191   9/8  44/39 273/242<br/>5      D/|\    E!!!)      ^/168D _/80E   266.871         7/6 (just)<br/>6      E\||/     .        _/92E    .     287.713     13/11 33/28<br/>7      E(!)

We<br/>decided on 121-EDO as a basic model, with a bit of modification.</p><p>For Peppermint 24, the relevant signs (which might occur in either<br/>direction depending on the chosen midi note as &quot;1/1&quot;) are as follows:</p><p>....................................................................<br/>Symbol 121-ET steps Pep24 cents   Sagittal name     ratio   /  cents<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  !)       2          20.842        7-comma         64:63     27.264<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> /|\       6          58.680        11-diesis       33:32     53.273<br/>                                   (13-diesis)    1053:1024   48.348<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> (!)       7          69.990       11&apos;-diesis      729:704    60.412<br/>                                  (13&apos;-diesis)      27:26     65.337<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>/||\      13         128.669        apotome       2187:2048  113.685<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>)|||      14         138.202      ?

C    D   E(!)  F     G<br/>  0    208   346   496  702  842  992  1200</p><p>Here the spellings G-B(!) and C-E(!), for example, nicely suggest the<br/>idea of a neutral third, here around 11:9, while G-E(!) is around 13:8.</p><p>However, there are situations where a step like B(!), or about 7 steps<br/>below C, might be respelled as A)!!!, or about 14 steps above A, a<br/>variation on the usual A/||\ or A#. The respelling has appeal when we<br/>have a 13th-14th century European variety of progression where this<br/>step acts in effect as a substitute for a regular A/||\ (not present<br/>in Peppermint 24), resolving to B by a compact semitone of 7 steps, or<br/>one step smaller than usual diatonic semitone of 8 steps.</p><p>           E(!)   E         D)|||   E<br/>           B(!)   B         A)|||   B<br/>           F/||\  E    or   F/||\   E</p><p>The first notation might be more &quot;keyboardistic,&quot; since it tells us<br/>that we are for the first sonority to play a sharp on the lower manual<br/>and two flats on the upper manual (the latter at 7 steps below E and B<br/>on the lower keyboard). The second spelling, however, with its<br/>accentuated sharps (14 steps above D and A), suggests a &quot;striving&quot;<br/>toward the resolution of lower 426-cent major third to fifth and outer<br/>922-cent major sixth to octave, the sagittal signs psychologically<br/>reinforcing the expected upward motion of the higher two voices by<br/>70-cent semitones or thirdtones A)|||-B and D)|||-E. This spelling<br/>also suggests that B(!) and E(!) are in this context serving as<br/>substitutes for the regular steps A/||\ and D/||\, which are not<br/>present in Peppermint 24.</p><p>In this example the complementary pair of signs are (!) at -7 steps<br/>and )||| at +14 steps, with absolute values adding up to 21 steps or a<br/>usual whole tone. The !) and /|||\ pairs at -2 and +19 steps form<br/>another such pair.</p><p>For example, let us consider these two spellings of a common<br/>resolution in Peppermint with a septimal flavor:</p><p>  E       F/||\          E    F/||\<br/>  B       C/||\          B    C/||\<br/>  F/|||\  F/||\    or    G!)  F/||\</p><p>The first spelling expresses a familiar keyboard pattern: septimal<br/>progressions often combine voices moving by regular whole tones on a<br/>single keyboard (B-C/||\ and E-F/||\) with others moving by the<br/>59-cent interval between the two keyboards (F/|||\-F/||\). The opening<br/>sonority of 0-437-933 cents, close to 7:9:12, thus resolves to a<br/>near-2:3:4.</p><p>The second spelling emphasizes that the step F/|||\ -- or indeed G!)<br/>-- is acting as a form of G lowered by 21 cents, an adjustment serving<br/>as a septimal comma so that G!)-B is a near-9:7 and G!)-E a pure 12:7.<br/>This notation more generally tells us both that G!) is available as a<br/>substitute for a regular G\!!/ (not present in Peppermint 24), and<br/>that its use may involve a septimal comma shift.</p><p>A similar situation arises with this common resolution:</p><p>  G     G/|\          G      A!!!)<br/>  D/|\  C/|\          E!!!)  D!!!)<br/>  C     C/|\    or    C      D!!!)</p><p>The first, more conventional spelling reflects the usual keyboard<br/>pattern that a major second plus the distance between the two<br/>keyboards (about 21 + 6 or 27 steps of 121-ET) yields a pure 7:6 minor<br/>third, here in a near-6:7:9 sonority. The outer voices ascend by<br/>very efficient 6-step intervals, C-C/|\ and G-G/|\, while the middle<br/>voice descends by a regular tone, D/|\-C/|\.</p><p>The second spelling may emphasize that C/|\ is acting in effect as a<br/>lowered (and thus accentuated) D\!!/ a septimal comma closer to C than<br/>the regular step (again not present in Peppermint 24) would be, and<br/>likewise G/|\ as a septimal A\!!/.</p><p>Alternative spellings using septimal comma symbols might sometimes be<br/>especially attractive when two versions of a progression are<br/>available, one with regular steps available on a single manual, and<br/>the other with septimally-flavored steps and intervals.</p><p>    regular                 septimal -- two spellings</p><p>     B   C                B       B/|\          B    C!)<br/>     G   F                F/|||\  E/|\          G!)  F!)<br/>     E   F                E       E/|\    or    E    F!)</p><p>The regular version has a minor third E-G at 288 cents, near 13:11,<br/>and a major third G-B at 416 cents, near 14:11, with usual diatonic<br/>semitones E-F and B-C at 80 cents, near 22:21 (about 8 steps in<br/>121-EDO). The altered version has smaller 6-step semitones or<br/>thirdtones near 28:27, and thirds at 7:6 and a near-9:7, as in the<br/>previous example. While the first spelling shows the characteristic<br/>keyboard motions E-E/|\ and B-B/|\ for the &quot;accentuated&quot; 6-step<br/>semitones, the second more expressly treats these as septimal<br/>variations on the usual E-F and B-C motions of 8 steps, made smaller<br/>by the 2-step comma !), thus E-F!) and B-C!). This version implies<br/>that the notes F!) and F, or C!) and C, might represent two &quot;versions&quot;<br/>of the same basic note. Both versions might be used in a piece,<br/>possibly involving some interesting comma shifts.</p><p>My purpose here is to explain some musical reasons for preferring a<br/>symbol set with certain sagittal equivalents for the same pitches, and<br/>also to give some idea of the &quot;neo-medieval&quot; qualities of the tuning<br/>as applied to European or Near Eastern music of that era.</p><p>Of course the object is to seek out some methods for realizing the<br/>notation in microabc or related utilities.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=14053 href="#14053">ðŸ”—</a>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2006 3:44:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo and everyone.</p><p>I managed to do an example of Pepermint with microabc.</p><p>Sources, score and midi files zipped in:<br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/pepermint.zip">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/pepermint.zip</a></p><p>The cadence examples are from previuos message by Margo Schulter in this thread.
