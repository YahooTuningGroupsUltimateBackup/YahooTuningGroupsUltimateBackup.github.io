On one side we have such media like internet to spread our ideas, thoughts, art etc... On the other side people are more isolated and lose lot of time with pure crap (like Facebook, writing or reading blogs or so). In my bad dreams I have seen everybody sitting at the computer, making his/her own music works, blogs, novels, poems, graphic art, etc., publishing it on the net, but nobody is interested, because everybody has enough work with his/her own business and life... No time, space and energy to accept and enjoy works of  the other. No dialogue and socializing, just millions of monologues which nobody is reacting on. No more reason for connecting computers together - we&apos;ll get the same result with independent computers without a net. Maybe such times are here. Call it saturation, or final agony of this world... which is so fragile - imagine just that something will happen with electricity... So I still keep some acoustic instruments for all cases :-), you never know...</p><p>As for me - in everyday fight for my daily bread there&apos;s no time for listening much music, being it master works or some compositional attempts, or even to comment it and give advices. My time here is limited and the more older I am, hours runs somehow faster and faster, so I try to keep control to which I invest my precious time. I still haven&apos;t heard lot of high quality music of real masters of the past and try to do it right now, always being surprised by some newly found personalities (recently Dowland, Purcell, Mateis, Bonporti, Rameau - just to name few of Baroque composers). Besides I have lot of my own work to do as multistyle composer, arranger, performer and concert artist, improviser, recording artist, music and languages teacher, music writer, musicologist,  linguist, translator... - always behind schedule and numerous plans. Count in two little children, who have their needs of father&apos;s time (and I really enjoy to be with them being in my 50ies), necessity to learn quite new life and language (I&apos;m expat who started from zero after moving to Japan in 2003)...</p><p>More times I did humble attempts to offer my works here or elsewhere to listening and comments, no reaction. But I&apos;m not surprised or dissapointed. That&apos;s reality of contemporary world, no reason to complain. Frankly said I&apos;m not so much interested in opinions from common people, or music hobbyist. Their &quot;I like it/I don&apos;t like it&quot; can&apos;t help me to make my music better. Only opinion of the person with the same or better level of education and experience could help, or such of the person who I personally admire and evaluate highly. And lot of people also lost the ability to judge what&apos;s really good or wrong in the art, and also ability to be deeply touched and surprised by art (lack of art and emotional education).  So I continue to live in my own isle, working mainly for myself, and trying to improve what I can improve in myself and the world near me.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 22 Dec 2010, at 12:32 AM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt; Excellent work!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder why so few people now comment on music posted here or the &gt; tuning<br/>&gt; list.
