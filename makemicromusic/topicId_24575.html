I am, indeed, working on ideas for my 10th CD, and here&apos;s a few...I have a fretless banjo, so I&apos;m starting to mess around with that a bit, looking for something traditional sounding, but with a twist. I&apos;ve played a lot of country music over the years, so let&apos;s see what comes of this...and of course, banjos were fretless once upon a time. Starting to play my 36 tone axe...it has great 7 limit intervals on it, and for me, that&apos;s suggesting a different take on blues...but those frets are mighty teensy indeed. I have a 22 tone JI Strat; all the intervals from the 16th/32nd Harmonics, plus 6 more...I am hearing several ideas here...one is a pentatonic major scale, maybe maqam influenced; and a melodic idea using the 11th and 13th Harmonics has appeared as well. Interesting...if you use those strange Harmonics and avoid the root, they sound completely different than if the tonic is involved...but boy, learning that neck is difficult. And...I have a fretless Flying V with a Roland GR 300 guitar synth hookup...the Roland was the first polyphonic guitar synth, still a classic...Metheny still uses his on recordings. The synth has it&apos;s own sound, very lush tones are possible...I took a Harmonic Major scale idea, and started it from the 7th...so I&apos;ve got a nice mode, this piece looks to be sort of fusion/shred oriented, we&apos;ll see where it goes...best from Denver...Hstick   (and BTW...on the fretless axes, there are, of course, various options for where to place an interval...I&apos;m letting my ear be the guide here, we&apos;ll find what sounds best to get the piece across)<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24578 href="#24578">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2011 1:00:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fretless on a guitar synth is indeed an interesting idea.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, Jan 12, 2011 at 1:39 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok...I like the idea of a CD in a month, but probably won&apos;t get that done.<br/>&gt; I am, indeed, working on ideas for my 10th CD, and here&apos;s a few...I have a<br/>&gt; fretless banjo, so I&apos;m starting to mess around with that a bit, looking for<br/>&gt; something traditional sounding, but with a twist.
