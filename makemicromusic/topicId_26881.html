Since we are having company today I am short on time and decided to render my Sonata 1 in pianoteq using his Piagui tuning. (details of the tuning below)</p><p>The story behind the piece  this piece has the kitchen sink and more in it because this was the result of for the first time getting my hands on a midi editor that used the grand staff  so I poured some 20 years of ideas out into the composition. It is not always coherent and at times not playable by a two handed person. But nonetheless I kind of like it because of the musical ideas I included like quartal and quintal harmony, clusters, several simultaneous dynamic levels defining polyphonic voices and so on.</p><p>Chris</p><p>!
