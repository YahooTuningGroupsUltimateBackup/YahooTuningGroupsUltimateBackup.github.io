They<br/>just sing to the best of their (and the director&apos;s) ability and often<br/>produce wonderful music. I know that the Hilliard&apos;s are noused up on<br/>tuning because I heard them doing Machaut&apos;s Mass with some serious<br/>Pythagorean thirds and I have read an article by one director which<br/>discussed how he treats commatic shift. As for string quartets, Kronos<br/>come immediately to mind.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; i would guess &quot;very aware&quot;.  being basically a keyboard/piano player,<br/>&gt; the whole notion of resonance, just intonation, commas, and so on,<br/>&gt; was very alien.  piano players rarely tune their own pianos, and<br/>&gt; can&apos;t range their pitch.  it&apos;s taken me years to even start to wrap<br/>&gt; my ears around it all.</p><p>And so it is for all of us. We plough a lonely furrow.</p><p>Awareness of the technical details of the music is often completely<br/>absent in performers. As a young teenager I could play virtually the<br/>whole Bach repertoire on guitar but got a bit confused when my teacher<br/>started waffling about dominant sevenths and counter subjects. So the<br/>good news is that a good ear and some determination are quite<br/>sufficient. Have you read W.A. Mathieu&apos;s book &quot;Harmonic Experience&quot;. I<br/>would strongly recommend the singing/ear training procedures there to<br/>anyone who wishes to sensitise themselves to Just Intonation (Daniel<br/>might want to take a peep as well : )</p><p>Kind Regards<br/>a.m.</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=4021 href="#4021">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Poor choice of wording on my part. What I *meant* to convey is that in the *virtual* world of software/hardware synthesis, we&apos;ve reached a point where - albeit with quite a bit of work - one can get pretty specific in terms of microtonal composition and actually hear it _as intended_.</p><p>In the &apos;real&apos; (non-virtual) world of composers --&gt; compositions --&gt; performers, one can spend a lot of time working on intricate microtonal material and still be very much at the mercy of the human animal. This isn&apos;t always a bad thing! :) But frequently the &apos;disconnect&apos; I&apos;ve seen is when people speculate on &quot;this&quot; being playable/hearable, or &quot;that&quot; being the way that performers &apos;must&apos; be thinking/hearing when they are playing, or &quot;the other&quot; must have been how people performed &apos;back then&apos;.</p><p>And, quite often, these people have little or no experience in the process of getting an ensemble of performers to tackle the difficulties of a newly tuned music. Just ask Alison Monteith; just ask Joe Pehrson; and etc.</p><p>I&apos;m not diatribing, mind you. I&apos;ve put all that behind me a long time ago when the frustration was getting the better of me. But if one focuses, as you are, on the emulation/creation of music using computational tools, you won&apos;t experience the frustration of the process of getting your work to sound as intended. Or the various positive elements that would come out of a non-virtual experience.</p><p>Hope that&apos;s clearer. Real vs. non-real wasn&apos;t intended as a slight!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
