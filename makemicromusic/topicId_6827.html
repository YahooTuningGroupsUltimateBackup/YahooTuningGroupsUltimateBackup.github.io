It is called Duo for Duodene, and you<br/>can find it at my SoundClick site:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm</a></p><p>It is the result of a collaboration between myself and a fellow<br/>microtonalist.  We each created material to use (four small original<br/>synthesizer audio clips) and separately recombined the material to formulate<br/>a piece.  Duo for Duodene represents my microtonal partner&apos;s mix.  My own is<br/>not finished yet.</p><p>You&apos;ll find it is very different from the other work on my SoundClick site<br/>because the bulk of the work was not done by me (I only provided some<br/>material), and it uses sounds outside of the FM7.  I think you&apos;ll enjoy it.</p><p>For a tuning, we used Ellis&apos;s Duodene:</p><p>0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>1:         16/15            111.731 minor diatonic semitone<br/>2:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone<br/>3:          6/5             315.641 minor third<br/>4:          5/4             386.314 major third<br/>5:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/>6:         45/32            590.224 diatonic tritone<br/>7:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>8:          8/5             813.686 minor sixth<br/>9:          5/3             884.359 major sixth, BP sixth<br/>10:          9/5            1017.596 just minor seventh, BP seventh<br/>11:         15/8            1088.269 classic major seventh<br/>12:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>I&apos;d be interested in your responses.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>-Andrew</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Friends.

In this respect, JI tunings may not (I emphasize *may*) jump out at you as being gigantically different. People can correct me here, but JI has strong roots in its harmonic sense, and melodies grow from that ground.

I can take a very small fraction of the credit for<br/>this piece, as I merely supplied some short audio files.  My collaborist,<br/>Jacky Ligon, did most of the work.</p><p>&gt; &gt;It is the result of a collaboration between myself and a fellow<br/>&gt; &gt;microtonalist.

I sent Jacky the audio by email, and he assembled the piece from<br/>that and from his own materials.  He then snail-mailed me a CD-R of the<br/>piece, along with his own audio fragments.  I ripped these files to my hard<br/>disk and uploaded it to SoundClick from there.  Now that I&apos;ve received his<br/>audio fragments, I&apos;ll be able to create my own conconction... but not until<br/>I find the time.</p><p>If we attempt another collaboration, I hope that more of it can be done over<br/>the internet.  At any rate, it was fun and interesting.</p><p>Best,<br/>Andrew</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Friends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo!
