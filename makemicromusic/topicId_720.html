The TX81Z has no<br/>&gt; filters, but can do very filtery sounding thing when you route<br/>&gt; velocity or aftertouch to the operator volumes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some modulation is good, but don&apos;t overuse pitch mod, because it<br/>will<br/>&gt; obscure yer tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Study the way some of you favorite patches are made - especially<br/>how<br/>&gt; the operators are detuned, and the algos being used in the TX. Make<br/>&gt; small changes to see how they effect the timbre. FM is hard to<br/>learn<br/>&gt; but worth it in the end - it is totally different that having<br/>filters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I would recommend is that during your sound design<br/>&gt; sessions, to use your sequencer to record and loop play some midi<br/>&gt; into the synth while you twiddle the settings. I find it especially<br/>&gt; valuable to use this method with something I have played with my<br/>&gt; hands, just a simple melody - or whatever. One important thing to<br/>&gt; remember with patch design, is to think about what kind of music<br/>&gt; gesture will be intended for the patch. Will it be a &quot;pad&quot; with a<br/>&gt; slow fade in (go to the evelope section if so, and slow the<br/>attack),<br/>&gt; will it be for a virtuoso/solistic performance? Think about wide<br/>&gt; expression in your creative routing to things that will make you<br/>&gt; sound respond to velocity - like the brightness of the timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky</p><p>Thanks, Jacky, for your response on this!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
