Basically: go to the keyboard, start playing, try<br/>some familiar progressions, find out what sounds similar, or maybe<br/>different, and see how both the similarlities and differences might<br/>lead in new directions -- or give a new kind of color to some favorite<br/>old ones.</p><p>To illustrate one humorous kind of relationship between practice and<br/>theory, I&apos;ll tell a story that really happened today.</p><p>In exploring 13-tET with the TX-802 &quot;Piccolo&quot; timbre (A27) that I<br/>already knew could make 738 cents sound like a stable fifth -- from<br/>the meantone experiment in this issue of TMA -- I quickly found all<br/>kinds of consonances and pleasant progressions.</p><p>One of my favorite consonances is something like G3-C4-D4-G4 (C4 here<br/>shows middle C), with a fourth, fifth, and octave above the lowest<br/>note. When I played it in 13-tET, it sounded concordant and beautiful,<br/>just as in Pythagorean or some other accustomed tuning.</p><p>Then I looked at the numbers, and counted the steps -- and concluded<br/>that what is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a major second in the middle (C4-D4)<br/>must actually be a 13-tET minor third of 3 steps. In this scale, a<br/>usual fourth plus a minor third makes a fifth (5 + 3 = 8). This led me<br/>to conclude that I had been playing 0-5-8-13, or 0-462-738-1200 cents.</p><p>Well, I said to myself, that&apos;s fine: 13 just &quot;adds up&quot; a bit<br/>differently, and that&apos;s one of the charms of this scale.</p><p>&quot;If it sounds nice, don&apos;t argue with it.&quot;</p><p>Well, at least I&apos;ll stand by that last conclusion. However, on<br/>reconsidering my arithmetic, I realized that that &quot;major second&quot; was<br/>actually a major second of two steps, something like 184.6 cents --<br/>which meant that something else had to be different. It turned out<br/>that I was playing -- if I got the figures right this time -- a<br/>sonority of 0-5-7-13, or 0-462-646-1200 cents with the &quot;fifth&quot; G3-D4<br/>at around 646 cents instead of the usual 738 cents.</p><p>Whatever I played, it sounded like my beloved 6:8:9:12, as I&apos;d say in<br/>JI lingo: here I would sum up, &quot;Enjoy the practice, the theory will<br/>follow even if the math needs a bit of proofreading&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Another reason to rely on practice, even if there&apos;s already a lot of<br/>great theory out there, is that the people who&apos;ve written that theory<br/>aren&apos;t necessarily coming from _your_ musical viewpoint, and that<br/>viewpoint can make just as much difference as interval sizes or<br/>tuning/timbre interactions.</p><p>That means that if you _really_ want to find out about a tuning, you<br/>need to try it -- not to invalidate everything that others have done,<br/>but to contribute a new viewpoint to all that they&apos;ve accomplished.</p><p>For example, I&apos;ve learned today that 13-tET, in the right timbre,<br/>offers beautiful versions of some &quot;textbook&quot; Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>progressions -- and also certain Renaissance or Xeno-Renaissance<br/>progressions! -- with some creative &quot;warps&quot; and surprises.</p><p>It can be really neat for some slow, note-against-note progressions,<br/>and also for a modal melody against a drone. I can take a drone on D,<br/>improvise above it in Dorian, and feel much as if I were in<br/>Pythagorean. Then a bit of theoretical reflection reveals that the<br/>&quot;fourth&quot; D-G happens actually to be 554 cents insteaad of 462 cents --<br/>so what else is new?</p><p>By the way, here&apos;s how I arrange my keyboards, with two versions of<br/>&quot;F#,&quot; one mapped to each keyboard, and the other notes the same:</p><p>   92     276          646       831     1015<br/>    1      3            7         9       11<br/>   C#3    Eb3         F#3(2)     G#3      Bb3<br/>C3     D3     E3   F3        G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       2      4    5         8       10       12   13<br/>0      185    369  462       738      923     1108 1200<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/>   92     276          554       831     1015<br/>    1      3            6         9       11<br/>   C#3    Eb3         F#3(1)     G#3      Bb3<br/>C3     D3     E3   F3        G3       A3       B3   C4<br/>0       2      4    5         8       10       12   13<br/>0      185    369  462       738      923     1108 1200</p><p>Maybe especially for Dan Stearns, here&apos;s a look at the pattern of<br/>scale steps in this kind of &quot;diatonic&quot; 13-tET arrangement for a mode,<br/>let&apos;s take that D Dorian I mentioned, counting steps or cents from the<br/>final or note of repose D:</p><p>   2    1    3      2     2    1   2<br/>D     E   F      G     A     B   C    D<br/>0     2   3      6     8     10  11   13<br/>0    185 276    554   738    923 1015 1200</p><p>It&apos;s curious that the F-G step, really a &quot;minor third,&quot; can sound more<br/>or less like a &quot;whole-step&quot; -- and sometimes the structure makes the<br/>usual resolution of a sonority sound quite strange or &quot;nondiatonic,&quot; a<br/>bit like 20-tET. At other times, it seems quite routine, with the<br/>progressions flowing much as in Pythagorean or 29-tET or whatever --<br/>in it&apos;s own way.</p><p>Mary, it reminds me of you when I reflect on the nice approximation of<br/>Phi in this scale, actually very close to 21:13 (two numbers in the<br/>Fibonacci series), at around 831 cents. It&apos;s funny that the &quot;thirds&quot;<br/>and &quot;sixths&quot; in this scale are all types that I&apos;m familiar with from<br/>other neo-Gothic tunings, but they fit together a bit differently.</p><p>Anyway, my two conclusions at the moment are yes, one can make<br/>neo-Gothic music in 13-tET -- and yes, practice has something very<br/>special to offer, not least to theory.</p><p>Thanks for _Galunlati_, which I should be reviewing here soon, and for<br/>all your encouragement in friendship and by example.</p><p>With peace and love to all,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=665 href="#665">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/17/2001 8:11:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Everyone</p><p>I&apos;ve been playing with Wilson&apos;s Scale Tree, Horagram 11, which is 1<br/>phi +0/3 phi +1).

One term that Dave Keenan has come up with for<br/>the first type of interval is &quot;superfourth,&quot; and 20-tET for example<br/>has a routine diminished fifth the way I arrange it (e.g. B-F) at 540<br/>cents.</p><p>You can hear this 540-cent interval in the opening passage for the<br/>&quot;Stern-Brocot Treehouse&quot; piece I started and still need to finish:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/20tgz002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/20tgz002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Now for the term &quot;Wolf&quot;: historically, it means an interval that<br/>resembles a regular consonance, but in a given set of styles and<br/>timbres is different enough that it can&apos;t be treated as if it were<br/>that consonance.</p><p>For example, a standard 12-note Pythagorean tuning based on a chain of<br/>pure 3:2 fifths at around 702 cents will have a diminished sixth or<br/>&quot;Wolf fifth&quot; (e.g. G#-Eb) at around 678 cents, far enough from 3:2 so<br/>that in a typical Gothic harmonic timbre, that narrow &quot;fifth&quot; will<br/>beat very prominently, and sound quite different from a usual one.</p><p>Similarly, moving to the Renaissance, in a 12-note version of<br/>1/4-comma meantone we have regular fifths at around 697 cents --<br/>tempered slightly narrow of 3:2 -- and a diminished sixth at around<br/>738 cents. Again, that odd &quot;fifth&quot; such as G#-Eb -- this time wide<br/>rather than narrow -- will sound very different in most timbres from a<br/>usual fifth.</p><p>A story tells us that the very prominent beating of either type of<br/>&quot;odd fifth&quot; reminded people of the &quot;howling of Wolves,&quot; and thus the<br/>term &quot;Wolf.&quot;</p><p>By analogy, someone oriented to this kind of style, for example, could<br/>say that 663 cents is a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; because it&apos;s about 39 cents from<br/>3:2, close enough to somewhat resemble a fifth, but far enough that<br/>it&apos;s likely to sound radically different than a 3:2 in typical timbres<br/>for traditional Western European compositions.</p><p>In other stylistic settings, however, an interval of 663 cents may<br/>have very different meanings: to call it a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; suggests, at<br/>least to me, that you want to hear it as a stable &quot;fifth&quot; but can&apos;t,<br/>at least in a given timbre. However, what if you&apos;re using it<br/>intentionally as another kind of interval?</p><p>In 20-tET, for example, 660 cents would be for me an ordinary<br/>&quot;augmented fourth&quot; or &quot;tritone,&quot; e.g. F-B, and would typically<br/>progress in parallel motion to a 480-cent &quot;perfect fourth.&quot;</p><p>Also, in just the right timbre, an interval such as 738 cents can<br/>actually sound like the stable concord it&apos;s a bit too far from to<br/>substitute for in usual historical practice. Then we can have a<br/>&quot;meantone well-timbrement&quot; where either 697 cents or 738 cents is a<br/>concordant &quot;fifth.&quot;</p><p>How about 13-tET, for example, a very different tuning in many ways<br/>from either medieval Pythagorean or Renaissance meantone, where an<br/>interval of 8/13 octave or 738 cents (almost exactly the size of the<br/>meantone &quot;Wolf&quot;) happens to be the closest approximation of a &quot;fifth&quot;<br/>at or near 3:2?</p><p>Here there are two approaches. In lots of timbres, we might take the<br/>attitude that 13-tET doesn&apos;t have anything very close to a usual<br/>&quot;fifth,&quot; and compose or improvise based on other categories and<br/>patterns. Here 738 cents could have various musical meanings,<br/>different from those of a &quot;fifth&quot; in historical Western European<br/>styles of composition.</p><p>Another approach is to choose a timbre where 738 cents can resemble a<br/>&quot;usual&quot; stable fifth closely enough that we tend to hear it as<br/>belonging to the same category, and then using it as a fifth in a<br/>style like neo-Gothic, for example.</p><p>In the first case, it isn&apos;t a &quot;Wolf,&quot; in my opinion, because we&apos;re not<br/>trying to make it fill the place of a usual &quot;fifth,&quot; only to find that<br/>it doesn&apos;t fit.</p><p>In the second case, it isn&apos;t a &quot;Wolf&quot; because in the right timbre, the<br/>interval actually fits as a stable &quot;fifth,&quot; at least in the ear of a<br/>given listener.</p><p>One practical way to sum this up is to say that a &quot;Wolf&quot; is the right<br/>interval in the wrong style and timbre -- and even in a musical<br/>setting where an interval is generally considered a Wolf, it can<br/>sometimes be used deliberately as a very telling special effect.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=677 href="#677">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2001 11:15:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., nanom3@h... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I finally got GigaStudio working, and I think you will be as amazed<br/>&gt; as I am to hear how realistic the pianos sound.
