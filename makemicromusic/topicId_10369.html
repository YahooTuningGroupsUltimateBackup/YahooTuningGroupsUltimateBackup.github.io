Do you have this happen?</p><p>It happens with me pretty regularly, and it can be disconcerting. Since I&apos;ve written music for a number of different &apos;purposes&apos;, and not solely for my own enjoyment, there have been times where I&apos;ve had to step out of my skin and write in styles I might not normally choose. When people give quite positive comments on those, and then pieces that I feel more closely aligned with meet with tepid response, it is very hard to ignore, and to not start questioning your own instinctual motivations.</p><p>While it is OK to feel good about the success of a commission, unless it is done in a manner that feels akin to your own aesthetic it can present some (long-term) problems. But it is what it is.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
