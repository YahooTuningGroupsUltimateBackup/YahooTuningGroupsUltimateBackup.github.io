Or perhaps a coffee house with<br/>a small meeting room, perhaps with audio &amp; video<br/>playback? These kinds of venues have worked well in<br/>the past. An evening or weekend time would suit me<br/>best.</p><p>I&apos;ll poll a few other area musicians &amp; keep y&apos;all<br/>posted on the when &amp; where. And I&apos;ll let ya know my El<br/>Paso day &amp; time when I find out too.</p><p>Soundly yours,<br/>Harold</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Make international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
