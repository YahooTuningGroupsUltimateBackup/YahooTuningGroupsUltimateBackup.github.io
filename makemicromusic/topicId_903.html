One way is to put samples in the Redrum section and tune according to taste.  Then it is also simple to make some pretty complex patterns by laying them down in the xox section, and also it is able to change the sample start times.  I did have an Akai S5000 and would have kept it, except for the unbelievable amount of money it takes to upgrade one.  I like reason because it is easy to get set up, and can do some pretty amazing things.</p><p>erik</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
