Suffice to say it will happen, and I&apos;m gladdened for the<br/>&gt; activity. In less than 24 hours I&apos;ll have time to devote to the larger<br/>&gt; world again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But for now, if anyone is in striking distance of San Diego tonight,<br/>&gt; Saturday, April 27th, you can treat yourself to a fun concert. I&apos;ve had the<br/>&gt; pleasure of &apos;co-producing&apos; a program with the San Diego Symphony with guest<br/>&gt; artist Steve Schick. Called &quot;Heartbeats of the World&quot;, it is an orchestral<br/>&gt; and otherwise survey of pulse, rhythm, and all the groove that moves; of<br/>&gt; sound from percussion that makes one more in tune with the underlying<br/>&gt; movement that abounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Details are: San Diego Symphony with Steve Schick, Copley Symphony Hall,<br/>&gt; 7th and B, San Diego, 8:00 pm. One night only...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Opening with a percussion quartet improvisation that plays off a heartbeat,<br/>&gt; the concert continues with a wide array of musics: Chavez&apos;s evocative<br/>&gt; &quot;Sinfonia India&quot;, &quot;Temezcal&quot; for a pair of maracas and taped<br/>&gt; accompaniement, a world premiere by Ward-Steinman, and more orchestral fare.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the fun starts: after a video featuring Steve, myself, and Jung-Ho Pak<br/>&gt; (SDS Artistic Director) shot at Home Depot on a search for sounds, Steve<br/>&gt; and I will perform on instruments I have built from found materials.<br/>&gt; Seriously microtonal, I&apos;ll be uploading audio and photos later on so you<br/>&gt; can see that Mom doesn&apos;t offer only lip service to microtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The culmination of the evening is Tan Dun&apos;s extraordinary &quot;Concerto for<br/>&gt; Water Percussion and Orchestra&quot;, featuring one soloist and two<br/>&gt; semi-soloists playing an array of percussion instruments in and out of<br/>&gt; water! We&apos;ve built special basins for performing: clear basins filled with<br/>&gt; water, lit from inside so that all movements are glowing and illuminated,<br/>&gt; and mic&apos;ed. Many sections, including Steve&apos;s evocative cadenza, involve<br/>&gt; simple *playing* the water, rhythmically and elsewise. It is a deeply<br/>&gt; satisfying experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve spent weeks on this project, compiling, rehearsing, collaborating, and<br/>&gt; I have to say that up to this point is has been one of the most involving<br/>&gt; and moving collaborations of my musical life. If any of you can attend, you<br/>&gt; will feel my joy and humility in the act of causing music to spring to live<br/>&gt; and love.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wish you all the best, and will be more in attendance once the weekend is<br/>&gt; over.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Onward and up,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
