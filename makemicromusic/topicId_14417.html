As it happened, when Bill and<br/>Jacky shared it by posting it on a free download site, I ran into the<br/>complication that the site seemed to use some kind of link or button<br/>which was &quot;invisible&quot; to my text-based browsers -- even a version of<br/>links which has some support for javascript. Very fortunately, Jacky<br/>and Jon Szanto quickly arranged for me to access and download the file<br/>at a site where I could get it with one my browsers -- many thanks!</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>1. A meeting of two world musicians<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>As someone having immense respect for both Bill and Jacky, I was<br/>indeed curious as to what they might create together. Each has his own<br/>genius, although their musical endeavors share certain themes and<br/>focuses.</p><p>A passion for exploring a range of world musics and instruments, and a<br/>fascination for the subtle interactions of timbre and tuning, are<br/>indeed common themes uniting these musicians. Both have explored just<br/>intonation and equal temperaments of various sorts, as well as scales<br/>which don&apos;t fit these categories.</p><p>If I were going to attempt drawing a contrast -- and one based on a<br/>partial sampling of these two musicians in more sense than one<br/>(partial meaning both &quot;incomplete&quot; and &quot;inevitably biased&quot;) -- I might<br/>say that Jacky&apos;s music is often contemplative in quality, developing a<br/>scale in a way unostentatiously awesome for an attuned listener, while<br/>Bill&apos;s has a certain affability that is at once sincere and &quot;cool&quot; in<br/>a kind of jazzlike way.</p><p>This side of Bill&apos;s music comes us in some of the pieces on his<br/>_Xentonality_ CD, and for me notably in the settings based on Gary<br/>Morrison&apos;s 88-cET, a scale based on equal 88-cent steps. In Bill&apos;s<br/>hands, we get a kind of very friendly jazz or pop music, tastefully<br/>arranged, and making the most of the scale through timbral<br/>adjustments. (I got a kind of preview of this when Gary sent me a<br/>cassette presentation including some customized bagpipe timbres or the<br/>like by Bill that neatly fit the 88-cET intervals of 1144 and 1232<br/>cents.)</p><p>Anyway, in _A Moment Transformed_, Bill and Jacky nicely combine their<br/>artistic outlooks in a piece full of musical space, depth, and fun.</p><p>The piece opens with some formative sounds that I tend to have a bit<br/>of trouble following well, because I lean on the side of keeping the<br/>volume down to a level I&apos;m confident is safe for the louder parts --<br/>although I would say that the contrasts aren&apos;t too immoderate. Anyway,<br/>at around 0:56 we hear a theme that to me seems at once typical of<br/>Jacky&apos;s longer-range forms, a melody and harmonic framework that allow<br/>a lot of room for variation, a kind of ambient space into which the<br/>listener can flow -- and also of Bill&apos;s instincts for appealing themes<br/>that might introduce a dramatic series, for example.</p><p>The music is based on septimal JI, and features lots of harmonic<br/>fifths and fourths, very pleasing to me. There are what I hear as<br/>shimmering touches to the timbres, and as Jacky commented to me lots<br/>of electronic layering, so that we get a kind of music nice simply to<br/>flow with; the percussion adds to the interest.</p><p>At certain points (for example, around 2:20), a faster and more<br/>&quot;restless&quot; theme comes in, and this seems to me vintage Sethares. The<br/>contrast between more relaxed or contemplative, and more &quot;driven,&quot;<br/>plays off nicely, and provides a certain formal structure for the<br/>piece. At times I might associate a texture loosely with 13th-century<br/>century European polyphony, or gamelan, or even some kind of jazz or<br/>pop theme played on an automobile&apos;s radio near a beach in California,<br/>USA during the 1960&apos;s.</p><p>I&apos;d call it a very successful collaboration, and ask in which<br/>directions these two artists might develop the material further. As it<br/>is, the piece might neatly grace Bill&apos;s next _Xentonality_-like CD. I<br/>could also see Jacky taking some of the melody and harmony and<br/>producing a longer &quot;ambient&quot; development, maybe a bit like the famous<br/>_Music from the Hearts of Space_ could present meditative<br/>transformations of already winning music, familiar or not so<br/>familiar.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>2. A note on intonation and timbre<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Since both Bill and Jacky have done pieces based on JI with relatively<br/>low prime numbers, they were able together harmoniously to join their<br/>creative resources in an intonational setting that might be considered<br/>&quot;relatively conventional&quot; in comparison to some of the their favorite<br/>tunings, for example scales such as 8-EDO or 11-EDO.</p><p>However, I suspect that their musical experience with matching tuning<br/>and timbre in &quot;xentonal&quot; environments may more generally help them in<br/>interesting registrations for a JI system like this one. They&apos;ve<br/>certainly brought things off very nicely.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=14439 href="#14439">ðŸ”—</a>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2006 12:41:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello &quot;Ligon and Sethares,&quot;</p><p>I finally got to listen, this was very enjoyable.
