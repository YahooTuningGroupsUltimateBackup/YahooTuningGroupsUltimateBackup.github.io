It might be, e.g.,<br/>&gt; that the &quot;flat&quot; instrument part must contain only flats and the<br/>&gt; &quot;sharp&quot; instrument part only sharps - OTOH, it does not really matter<br/>&gt; for pianos, so notation could be according to liking or logical<br/>&gt; appearance.</p><p>If it is definitely for two players, one at each piano, it is better<br/>to spell chords in the most commonly read ways, so long as it is clear<br/>which piano is which...</p><p>thank you for your enthusiasm,<br/>jacob</p></div>
