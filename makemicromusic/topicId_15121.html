But<br/>&gt; sometimes it is,<br/>&gt; &gt; like in the case of your music.  And by letting me<br/>&gt; listen to pieces<br/>&gt; &gt; like the Juggler, you created a customer for your<br/>&gt; DivideByPi<br/>&gt; &gt; CDs (then you gave me the CDs too! go figure :).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I worked for Keyboard, I got about 6 CDs in<br/>&gt; the mail every day,<br/>&gt; &gt; from real record labels.  They paid to mail them<br/>&gt; to me on the off<br/>&gt; &gt; chance I&apos;d write about them in the magazine.  But<br/>&gt; every listener is<br/>&gt; &gt; in fact a critic, and word of mouth is incredibly<br/>&gt; valuable.  So<br/>&gt; &gt; why not send every listener some music for free?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &apos;download vs. CD purchase&apos; thinking also<br/>&gt; discounts other ways<br/>&gt; &gt; of monetizing popularity.  The ultimate capital of<br/>&gt; musicians is<br/>&gt; &gt; popularity.  To say the CD or the LP is their<br/>&gt; ultimate capital is,<br/>&gt; &gt; well, wrong.  Popularity can always be monetized.<br/>&gt; If DivideByPi<br/>&gt; &gt; ever plays live, your downloaders will be there,<br/>&gt; and they&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt; probably bring friends.  At the very worse you can<br/>&gt; do product<br/>&gt; &gt; endorsements.  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve (DBP) done a few live shows, maybe 4 total, in<br/>&gt; Chicago over our<br/>&gt; existence. We made a bunce of sales of &apos;Ice Ritual&apos;<br/>&gt; at our last show,<br/>&gt; which was a while ago, and a couple of months ago,<br/>&gt; Andy moved to<br/>&gt; Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh. He&apos;s in the &quot;sticks&quot;,<br/>&gt; but his job has<br/>&gt; good health benefits. Our future is uncertain at<br/>&gt; this point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s ok, because right now I&apos;m focussing on being a<br/>&gt; Dad, and when I<br/>&gt; have the time, writing my own stuff here and there,<br/>&gt; and for the<br/>&gt; theatre (I want to break into the Dance company<br/>&gt; scene---more exposure<br/>&gt; in an obvious way). Andy is going to be a Dad in<br/>&gt; December, too...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Parenthood takes a lot of energy and time away from<br/>&gt; music--and<br/>&gt; everything else for that matter--but it has its own<br/>&gt; rewards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, you may be right FAIK, Carl, about all this<br/>&gt; music distribution<br/>&gt; evolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
