The first fruit of my labour, employing the professional<br/>&gt; sounds of this hot audio production kit, can be heard at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/musics.html">http://www.ozanyarman.com/musics.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Click the first song on the Flash player titled: &quot;Son Bir Kez&quot;. It<br/>&gt; is an mp3 file in 44.1 Khz Stereo 160kbps format.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a H&uuml;zzam Sharqi by me, in that rapturous maqam cherished by<br/>&gt; Turks, in a scale I specifically formulated for this Logic8+Ethno2<br/>&gt; project, whose final mix includes my boomy singing voice with due<br/>&gt; embellishments and ornamentations characteristic of my thespian<br/>&gt; manneristic interpretation of the forlorn melody AND my own<br/>&gt; (reworked) lyrics in Turkish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A translation of the lyrics will be attempted for those who wonder<br/>&gt; the meanings of the words! For the moment, let me say it&apos;s a cheeky<br/>&gt; poem about a romance gone wrong and heart-tearing libidinous longing<br/>&gt; for someone even though the feeling is not reciprocated anymore.<br/>&gt; Just ask me for the translation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This electrifying recording you hear has turned into a grandiose re-<br/>&gt; arrangment, or dare I say, &quot;soaring&quot;, over the preliminary<br/>&gt; lackadaisical version that featured arbitrarily/haphazardly hand-<br/>&gt; traced MIDI pitch-bends to emulate the intonation of the maqam:<br/>&gt; Offsets from 12-tET pitches by slides and slews of the PC mouse,<br/>&gt; undertaken during my neophyte years in studying Maqam music, before<br/>&gt; I even so much as knew the basics of tuning scholarship and<br/>&gt; professional audio production.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having discarded the preliminary pitch-bend data grotesquely<br/>&gt; resembling Huzzam in the aforesaid novice version recorded years<br/>&gt; ago, I used this 12-tone &quot;Sonbirkez scale&quot; in my fresh entry for the<br/>&gt; Ethno2 competition:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sonbirkez Huzzam scale<br/>&gt; 12<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 8/5<br/>&gt; 121/108<br/>&gt; 847/720<br/>&gt; 57/46<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; 81/50<br/>&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; 64/39<br/>&gt; 121/72<br/>&gt; 847/480<br/>&gt; 171/92<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are three types of &quot;perde hisar&quot; (or &quot;perde huzzam&quot; if you<br/>&gt; will) at 8/5 (814 cents), 81/50 (835 cents) and 64/39 (857 cents),<br/>&gt; cleverly placed in the scale so as to complete the 12-tones to the<br/>&gt; octave picture... a picture that I find myself constantly returning<br/>&gt; to in my lethargic progress toward xentonality havens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note, that the notes C#, F# and Ab are assigned to aforesaid three<br/>&gt; inflexions of perde hisar. All I needed to do in my project was to<br/>&gt; move a pitch over to one of these notes for the correct, i.e. sassy,<br/>&gt; intonation required by the ecstatic and doleful H&uuml;zzam melody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I took as reference Jacques&apos;s Egyptian Rast scale in the Ethno2<br/>&gt; tuning library when starting to formulate my scale. It appears I was<br/>&gt; left with only 121/72 and the octave in common at the end. Such is<br/>&gt; the incorrigibility of the Turkish H&uuml;zzam!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The length of the piece is 4:45 minutes. I realise that this a bit<br/>&gt; more than ordinarily expected. That is because of the &quot;naqarat&quot;<br/>&gt; section, or reprises for the consequent strophes of the lyrics. If<br/>&gt; need be, I can prepare an alternative mix that fits the 3 minute<br/>&gt; constraint. But I truly wish the piece is preserved the way it is:<br/>&gt; Complete as it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The instruments used in the mix were, Maghrib Violin+Strings,<br/>&gt; Sustained+Tremolo Ouds, Tambourine, Oriental Tambourine, Bendir,<br/>&gt; Daire, Darbuka and my very own singing voice. Countless hours of<br/>&gt; digital mastering in my home studio unaccounted for!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My eyes searched for a Romanian clarinet in Ethno2, but I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; find any. The only reed-wind I found suitable for the piece<br/>&gt; imitative of clarinet, the Bamboo Sax, was too limited in pitch<br/>&gt; register. Motu needs URGENTLY to incorporate Turkish sounds in its<br/>&gt; future Ethno bundle!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tackled and finished the production of &quot;Son Bir Kez&quot; (&quot;One Last<br/>&gt; Time&quot;) in a period of utter exasperation with the Ethno2 mix of my<br/>&gt; Nishabureyn Peshrev and intense summer heat in Istanbul. The Peshrev<br/>&gt; uses too many pitches and Ethno2 is a resource-gulper when setting<br/>&gt; it up in such a way as to facilitate switching easily between same<br/>&gt; instruments tuned to different tunings. I hope Jacques and his team<br/>&gt; will understand and show leniency to me as I grapple to finish the<br/>&gt; Ethno2 rendition of the Peshrev and also a surprise piece, hopefully<br/>&gt; in time!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, there it is... Son Bir Kez for your ears.
