In each section, at least one but no more than three examples of what to download, and how to set it up on the platform. A basic template would be the names of the software and links to downloads; followed by a description of how to install, and use, those pieces of software to get a simple piece of microtonal music recorded.</p><p>I want to start, if possible, with a freeware solution for each platform. If consensus is that there simply isn&apos;t a good way to do that, then we go to shareware, donation-ware, or low cost commercial products. By the time we put something up that newcomers can refer to, we should have two sections: free, and low-cost. That way we can show there is no barrier (save the hardware) to making music (that is, if we do indeed find free resources for all 3 platforms) as well as show the benefits to creativity, quality, work-flow, etc., with the expenditure of just a little bit of money.</p><p>I&apos;d even entertain a Wild Card page/sub-section of standalone things that make something microtonal on their own (I happen to be thinking of Robert Walker&apos;s &quot;Fractal Tune Smithy&quot;). But only after the main goal is achieved.</p><p>Final Important Note [FIN]: I would like anyone who submits a particular scenario to have ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IT! It won&apos;t do us any good to just surf and say &quot;this looks good&quot;. I want you to have created a straight-forward solution on your own, and know in fact that it works [with the usual caveats that tweaking may be needed in terms of sound card, i/o if you want to do midi, etc... but you get the picture].</p><p>Isn&apos;t this really a doable thing? Wouldn&apos;t it be great, when we have someone who is asking about sitting down and finding out about microtonality, to be able to point to that one page and say &quot;Here are a number of solutions - give it a go!&quot;?</p><p>I think so. I welcome commentary on this, and then after a bit of discussion we&apos;ll plunge forward, set a deadline, and see what we come up with...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>ListMom</p></div>
