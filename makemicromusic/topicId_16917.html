I played synthesizer in his  piece,<br/>while he played the faster melodic lines on a separate instrument.   I&apos;ll know<br/>better when I see the video.  Since his was the only electric  piece I would<br/>like very much to see the recording.  The Day Revisited by  Kyle Gann is planned<br/>for a new CD release, but I&apos;m not sure of the actual  details.  Kyle?</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s free at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a>.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>5/5/2007 11:57:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe -- it appears I anticipated by some days.
