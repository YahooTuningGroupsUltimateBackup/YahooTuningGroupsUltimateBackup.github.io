Did it do anything for me?  nothing at all.<br/>Even a credit on the i found offensive in that it implied that i<br/>approved of what was being done , or was there contributing. Still if i<br/>take a copy of their software , I am a thief.<br/>tonight I was at a club and some one approach me to Rent my instruments<br/>so he could sample them. What could i possibly gained by being sampled?</p><p>BTW that somehow this stance has anything to do with academia is<br/>misplaced. Academia is all for sampling as far as i can tell. i am not<br/>associated with any schools nor do i read their products. In fact some<br/>schools it has been the complete focus. I know of not one university<br/>where acoustic instrument building is dealt with in any fashion.</p><p>&gt; Just like everything else, plunderphonia can be used well or it can be<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; used poorly... it can also be used invisibly, and here there can be no<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; opposition other than an ideological or a political one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shouldn&apos;t we be listening with our heads and our hearts and not our<br/>&gt; politics... maybe not?</p><p>The mere fact that one&apos;s bring up plunderphonics is a political act and<br/>statement. The term is a political one. It is the proponents that<br/>defined the language for it discussion as political. There is nothing in<br/>this work that has anything to do with heart and soul. It is not me who<br/>defined how it would be discussed, but people like John Oswald. That<br/>which happened historically before was not called plunderphonics and was<br/>not a political in essence. That the term is being applied in retrospect<br/>to what those processes were is manipulative for political means.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;We don&apos;t live in the same world as Ives , we can no longer end up at<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the rail station at the end of the day and all sing the same hymn. It<br/>&gt; will never happen again.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I couldn&apos;t help but think that Ives idealized that occurrence above<br/>&gt; and beyond reality anyway, but so what?</p><p> you don&apos;t think it happened. I never doubted it but perhaps i am naive</p><p>&gt; Is it impossible to believe<br/>&gt; that maybe the fundamental longings expressed here have not been jaded<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; right out of every last living thing!</p><p>This fundamental longing is the one thing i believe each and every one<br/>of us is where we would all agree. The common experience is our longing<br/>for this common experience, the search for the current that runs through<br/>us all.</p><p>I have found nothing in the dialog of plunderphonics to approach the<br/>question of this fundamental longing.<br/>    From Ives I don&apos;t get this as much as the spiritual conflict and/ or<br/>civil war going on in this country ( maybe the world is more appropriate<br/>now) that is not going to ever be resolved. it is completely frightening<br/>and is a statement on the political situation of us. Which is different<br/>than a political statement. This was the first country not based on a<br/>particular religion and the result is a spiritual havoc. His use of<br/>themes represents less to me a common experiences as the outlooks of<br/>the different groups that make up this mixture. He saw no solution to<br/>how it would all work out and despite TV making us all see things the<br/>same we have never been further apart.</p><p>an aside...............</p><p>    BTW my friend Roger Mexico has been documenting the various Charles<br/>Ives sightings and i hope to be putting up some in the near future,<br/>although over the years , some have been sent to Lou Harrison.</p><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;The reason the visual arts no longer use these methods is because<br/>&gt; it, like surrealism, is the language now the property of advertising.<br/>&gt; It is incapable of drumming up a common experience unless that<br/>&gt; experience is buying together or the same thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s a preposterously wide range of things that could (or do) fall<br/>&gt; somewhere near the plunder tree... and I honestly don&apos;t get<br/>&gt; overemphasizing the whole consumer-advertising thing.</p><p>    I emphasize advertising because here you have a field which draws on<br/>everything and everything is apart of its language and in one way is<br/>owns everything because it can buy anything.<br/>What does hearing &quot;Come Together&quot; in a commercial do.
