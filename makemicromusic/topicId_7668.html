Check out &quot;absolute mode&quot; on the P5 group.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; what will need to be used. Don&apos;t use the Essential Reality  SDK for<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute mode, though. It says it works in the SDK docs but  it<br/>&gt;&gt; really doesn&apos;t. Only relative mode works (similar to mouse  input).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Rightio, thanks. Though I&apos;m not sure I understand the  distinction between<br/>&gt;relative and absolute mode here yet. With the mouse,  you can lift the mouse<br/>&gt;off the pad and place it back again somewhere  else, so you lose<br/>&gt;the record of where it was before, so it has to be  relative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But I don&apos;t yet understand how you can you lose the  absolute position of<br/>&gt;the glove as it seems there is nowhere else to move  it to. Must be<br/>&gt;missing something there.</p><p>The glove transmits absolute coords to the computer but Essential Reality<br/>setup the driver in relative mode (like the mouse) &apos;cuz they thought that would<br/>be what users want (they were wrong).  The folks on the P5 yahoo group have<br/>written absolute mode in but only on the joystick emulation side of it (if  I<br/>understand correctly).  So it can be done but just wasn&apos;t originally for  some<br/>reason unbeknownst to everyone that uses it.  It&apos;s probably why the  thing<br/>didn&apos;t sell well when it was released.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
