Sorry to &gt;be so unhelpful;-)</p><p>I think we&apos;re all kind of guessing at what Monz wanted. *My* guess is that he wants a playback-only application (and apparently one that is simply a freeware media player) that can address midi information from *multiple* ports, allowing one to expand pitch-bend microtuning strategies to break out beyond 16 channels.</p><p>Many of the attempts to create microtonal midi music utilize some form of round-robin assignment, where a midi stream is broken up into single notes going successively to one of 16 midi channels. Naturally, this breaks down with either large degrees of polyphony or multiple individual instrumental parts, basically any time you are going to get more than 16 notes. It also completely breaks if you have sustaining sounds against moving sounds, as you can get pitch bend artifacts showing up in the sustained notes if too many moving notes occur.</p><p>One possible way out is multiple midi ports. I happen to use a Midiman 4x4 (hardware) midi box (when I&apos;m using hardware, which is rare these days), which would mean that after using up channel 16 on the first port, I could then address channel 1 on port 2; this would, effectively, allow me to muck around with up to 48 notes simultaneously. It would be more prudent to develop an algorithm to round-robin the ports as well, starting with channel 1, port 1, then c1 p2, etc; this would slow down the buildup of notes in each port, thereby delaying the pitch bend artifact problem.</p><p>Anyhow, that&apos;s my guess. But if I&apos;m correct, Joe hasn&apos;t begun to tackle the next part: are the soundcards that he is targeting going to be able to accept information going to multiple midi ports? I don&apos;t think so...</p><p>And, to finish, I don&apos;t know of any such media players.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9944 href="#9944">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2005 4:36:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Jon and Charles,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Charles,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a strange question, which I may not have<br/>&gt; &gt; understood. ...

It might be possible<br/>to create a rudamentary Csound instrument that took your note<br/>positions and generated a .wav file of the composition. Here&apos;s the<br/>basic outline of what Csound would need:</p><p>;   start time -  duration  - frequency<br/>i1  0            .5432       264.7865<br/>i1  .5432        .5432       330.9831<br/>i1  1.0864      2.1728       397.1798</p><p>Then you wrap that with a Csound instrument as in the example below<br/>and route it to Csound for processing.</p><p>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;</p><p>&lt;CsOptions&gt;<br/>-W -m2 -+y -G -o test.wav<br/>&lt;/CsOptions&gt;</p><p>&lt;CsInstruments&gt;<br/> sr = 44100 ; typical sample rate<br/> ksmps = 10 ; set to 1 for better resolution<br/> nchnls = 1 ; set to 2 for stereo</p><p> instr 1 ; let csound create more if it needs them<br/> istart = p2 ; the second parameter is the note start time<br/> idur = p3 ; the third parameter is the note duration<br/> ifreq = p4 ; the frequency in Hz<br/> print ifreq, istart, idur ; list the inputs as the processing goes<br/> a1   pluck     10000, ifreq, ifreq, 0, 6 ; guitar like sound<br/> out  a1 ; send it to the output file<br/> endin ; you&apos;re done!<br/>&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;</p><p>&lt;CsScore&gt;<br/>;   start time -  duration  - frequency<br/>i1  0            .5432       264.7865<br/>i1  .5432        .5432       330.9831<br/>i1  1.0864      2.1728       397.1798<br/>&lt;/CsScore&gt;<br/>&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;</p><p>This is a simple instrument with a guitar like sound. Csound will<br/>automatically generate a new instrument if more than one note sounds<br/>at a time, and there is no real limit to the number of instruments<br/>playing simultaneously. For more interesting sounds, you can replace<br/>the &quot;pluck&quot; instrument with a sample based instrument, and add<br/>interesting envelopes, volume information, and other parameters.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think we&apos;re all kind of guessing at what Monz wanted.<br/>&gt; &gt; *My* guess is that he wants a playback-only application<br/>&gt; &gt; (and apparently one that is simply a freeware media player)<br/>&gt; &gt; that can address midi information from *multiple*<br/>&gt; &gt; ports, allowing one to expand pitch-bend microtuning<br/>&gt; &gt; strategies to break out beyond 16 channels.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, to finish, I don&apos;t know of any such media players.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, Jon, you got it right.
