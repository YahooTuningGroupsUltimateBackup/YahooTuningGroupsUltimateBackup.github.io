Not an easy task to speak about another&apos;s music in such a detailed and objective (yet personal) manner. Glad you are here to do just that. I&apos;ll add just a couple of thoughts for Gene as well, as I dl&apos;d it and gave it two listens (one somewhat in the background).</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;for me, the opening texture is very promising and interesting, but for 8+<br/>&gt;minutes, it gets a bit much (for me anyway it did). [snip] For me, the &gt;restlessness started to sound like white noise after 2 minutes, and it lost me.</p><p>Very much agreed. I decided I wouldn&apos;t remark on this feature any more (as I have in the past) after Gene explained his compositional process. But Gene, I hope you take a portion of Aaron&apos;s thoughts to heart, because I second the notion that you will find few audience members willing to listen to extended stretches of this manner of composition with nary a break in texture, motion, density, etc. It doesn&apos;t come off minimal enough for me to go into &quot;Reich-mode&quot; and settle in for long-term development. One would hope that, if we consider that there are a lot of things going on, you could find a way to isolate some of them and dwell in those areas a little more.</p><p>It is a strong signal that when a fine musician like Aaron has difficulty avoiding tuning out in a short span, it may mean something.</p><p>I like the sound of this piece, however - there is a more organic nature to all of it, not really mimicing other instruments nor settling firmly in a completely electronic world. The constant &apos;tutti&apos; nature of the scoring reminds me a lot of Frank Zappa&apos;s work with (first) the Synclavier, and later his orchestrations of some of those works. While they aren&apos;t microtonal, you might find it illuminating to contrast an electronic rendition of his with a later-orchestrated one (&quot;The Girl in the Magnesium Dress&quot; would be one good example).</p><p>&gt;All the instruments were pretty much playing all the time, and this added &gt;to the monotony for me: at 5&apos;24&quot; there was a nice break were you kept the &gt;reeds going, but it was broken again within 3 seconds, so I was frustrated &gt;at how brief that *delightful* repose was !!! If you look at the &gt;orchestration of *any* masterwork, there are plenty of contrasting colors &gt;and densities.</p><p>Again, parallel to some of my comments to you in the past, but maybe unavoidable in your current manner of working. Maybe, just maybe, one or more of these works will highlight an area of a composition that pushes you into working in a slightly different compositional framework (i.e. working on individual lines, rather than letting Maple fill in the blanks), and allow you to craft more musical nuances into the already interesting intonational canvas.</p><p>&gt;In short, what you do on the surface is delightful, now what is needed is &gt;a large-scale direction/momentum/argument/architecture/thesis-antithesis. &gt;Or, a better way of not obscuring what form I can glean is there (I did &gt;recognize ceertain motives, which were not clearly *articulated* by any &gt;other parameters such as phrasing, silence, orchestration, etc....</p><p>As you noted in your reply, there are motives; as Aaron notes, they are not easily discernable, something that can be remedied with further attention to the parameters mentioned above.</p><p>As always, illuminating to see how each of us approaches making this music in very different (and valid!) ways...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6754 href="#6754">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2004 10:15:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
