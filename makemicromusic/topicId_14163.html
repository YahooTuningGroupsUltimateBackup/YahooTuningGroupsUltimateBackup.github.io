On a 2x3<br/>&gt;&gt; lattice, the distance C4-&gt;G4 would be 1, while the distance C4-&gt;D4<br/>&gt;&gt; would be 3 (up two perfect fifths, and down one octave).  So anyone<br/>&gt;&gt; minimizing lattice distance would prefer lots of voices moving by<br/>&gt;&gt; perfect fifth to voices moving by step.  This might be useful for<br/>&gt;&gt; some purposes, but not voice leading, where steps are smaller than<br/>&gt;&gt; fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hate to argue on both sides of this, but SATB voice leading<br/>&gt; rules favor fourths, fifths, and whole tones (in that order) over<br/>&gt; semitones, at least in the bass.</p><p>True only of the bass, and as Margo can tell you, not true for earlier<br/>styles, which favor stepwise progressions in all voices.</p><p>-A.</p><p>----- End forwarded message -----</p></div>
