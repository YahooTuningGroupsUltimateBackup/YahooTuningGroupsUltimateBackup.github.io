What happened?</p><p>Oh dear! (blush)</p><p>I did ask Jacky about his name; if it was true or if<br/>you was pulling our legs.</p><p>&gt; For the record: I am kidding. It was tongue, firmly in cheek.</p><p>Gotcha!</p><p>&gt; The key hint is probably the word Froblenscheiss.</p><p>Frah-blehn-scheyez? But what does it mean? The only<br/>thing I know about German is that sometimes if you<br/>speak it out lound it makes more sense than if you are<br/>just looking at it but that didn&apos;t help me here.<br/>Although I once was watching a show on TV about horses<br/>in German and for a brief moment, I started to get &apos;in<br/>the zone&apos; and understand what they were saying but then<br/>I wondered if maybe they were just speaking English<br/>briefly. Speaking of which, my wife recently had a<br/>dream in which a horse was in a battle tent speaking to<br/>her in Spanish but she did not understand enough<br/>Spanish to comprehend what the horse was saying<br/>unfortunately though she could tell that the horse was<br/>quite fluent and spoke proper Spanish.</p><p>Thanks George!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
