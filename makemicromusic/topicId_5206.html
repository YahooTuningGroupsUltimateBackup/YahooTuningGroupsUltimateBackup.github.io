From what I see on the boards, not only are you in a niche (Mac &lt;&gt; PC) but OSX users seem to be an even smaller subset, at least when it comes to software availability.</p><p>Of the softies I&apos;ve auditioned, only one appears to support the OSX platform, CronoX:</p><p><a href="http://www.linplug.com/Products/CronoX/cronox.htm">http://www.linplug.com/Products/CronoX/cronox.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;ve just started using it, and I think it is going to be a lot of fun, a good tandem with the z3ta+ softie. One real bonus is the CronoX directly supports the .tun file standard, which allows you to supply a base note as well as the alternate tunings (the z3 uses .scl files, and I&apos;ll have to tweak octave settings, etc.)</p><p>I&apos;m not saying there aren&apos;t others out there. I *love* the sounds of NI&apos;s Absynth2, but here&apos;s the rub: the demo is 1.2, and while it &apos;supports&apos; microtuning it is as small included set. Now 2.0 is supposed to have an internal editor (and already we can see it is more work than just importing Scala information), but they have not built a demo of 2.0, so I can&apos;t test out that function. I also need to go back and check out the Orion system and a. see how well it works and b. see if it supports Mac/OSX.</p><p>It is a real growth period for microtuning capabilities. I hope enough people will get one or more of these and use them to create compelling music; if no one does, then the current interest in supporting microtonal programming will go away. These manufacturers will *not* respond to theoretical treatise, only the music that they can hear that their products have made!</p><p>&gt;I looked into NI Reaktor 4.0, but it looks like you have to do a lot &gt;of  programming to tune with it, which isn&apos;t my game.</p><p>That is my impression as well.</p><p>Let&apos;s keep at it - I&apos;d like to find a real-time solution for you!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5211 href="#5211">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2003 4:01:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Has anyone here looked at the ZR-3 soft synth?</p><p><a href="http://zr-3.sourceforge.net/">http://zr-3.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>It&apos;s open-source...

If we have any programmers here, it might be easy &gt;enough for someone to drop in the Anamark tuning source...</p><p>Speaking of which, I got around to loading the Anamark synth. It has fairly nice sounds, but one of the features that is turned off in the demo is tuning. I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out why someone would do that! Based on the sounds alone, in 12tet, it doesn&apos;t really have much to offer compared to the couple others I&apos;m using, but if you&apos;ve had any experience with it in microtuning, please let us know how it was.</p><p>I&apos;m happy so far with the implementations of CronoX and z3ta+, but I may very well go ahead and get Rhino. Depends on whether or not Absynth2 comes through with a good, flexible tuning support, and/or I can find a sampler that easily implements microtuning.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5219 href="#5219">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2003 8:56:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
