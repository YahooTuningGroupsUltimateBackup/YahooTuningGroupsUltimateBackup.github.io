I&apos;ll comment on others after<br/>hearing them....</p><p>What didn&apos;t work for me above all was the &apos;form&apos;--there was little to grab me<br/>about the interplay of form and content to keep me wanting to hold on until<br/>the end--an &apos;arc&apos;. A bit too &apos;noodle-ey&apos; perhaps, or perhaps a better word<br/>might be &apos;meandering&apos;, in that the vision of the piece/improvisation was<br/>still inchoate. Perhaps your vision might work better thinking about it<br/>&apos;top-down&apos; (form first) instead of &apos;bottom-up&apos;. See the shape of the forest,<br/>then paint the trees. I&apos;m not imply one should fill a rigid mould, but to<br/>start out with, I never think that that idea hurts. Flexibility and freedom<br/>with form comes only after disciplined mastery, anyhow. I know that great<br/>things happen &apos;bottom-up&apos; too, but I would suggest that when the itch to hit<br/>fast forward on the mp3 player is in evidence, the large-scale and small<br/>scale structures are not cohesive. Form.</p><p>Two ideas to explore: 1st; as you listen to any music, your own especially,<br/>observe your own emotional and physical reaction. Do you lean in with<br/>interest? Or does your mind wander? Do you want to jump up and down with<br/>pride and excitement over what you have done? Or do you want to hit fast<br/>forward? Most important--was it compelling enough that I want to hear it<br/>again? (that last one really is a mark of great-ness in my book)</p><p>2nd idea---I think different individuals look for different sensations in<br/>music, but, in my years of experience listening to and talking about music<br/>with fellow musicians and music lovers, it&apos;s remarkable how many times we all<br/>have orgasms over the same moments, be they rhythmic, harmonic, timbral,<br/>whatever. So I&apos;m convinced that what moves me in some way will move another<br/>in a similar way, even if they might *reject* being moved in that way for<br/>taste reasons. Composers I know also notice that their most trusted teachers<br/>notice the same weaknesses in their pieces that they did, but hoped the<br/>teacher would let it slide! Nope....so my 2nd idea would be to listen to<br/>something you consider a masterpiece that you would want to more-or-less<br/>imitate in some fashion of your choosing, and write a list of the things that<br/>moved you about it and why. Be clear and as specific as possible. Instead of<br/>&apos;I like the harmony&apos;, write &apos;I liked the disjunct resolutions of the minor<br/>seventh chords&apos;. Even write about what you don&apos;t like in certain music. A<br/>list like this help one to have clarity about where one wants to go as a<br/>composer, and where one want to avoid. The key word here is &apos;clarity&apos;. I<br/>think when you have self-directed clarity, the answers to any compositional<br/>or inspirational problem are within.</p><p>I hope this helps, and I&apos;m only sharing this with you as a fellow traveler,<br/>not to talk down. Just what works/has worked for me.</p><p>Now, a great Rilke quote about public criticism, I hope it inspires:</p><p>&quot;...For I still didn&apos;t understand fame, that public demolition of someone who<br/>is in the process of becoming, whose building-site the mob breaks into,<br/>knocking down his stones.<br/>    Young man anywhere, in whom something is welling up that makes you shiver,<br/>be grateful tha no one knows you. And if those who think you are worthless<br/>contradicts you, and if those whom you cal your friends abandon you, and if<br/>they want to destroy you because of your precious ideas: what is this obvious<br/>danger, which concentrates you inside yourself, compared to the cunning<br/>enmity of fame, later, which makes you innocuous by scattering you all<br/>around?<br/>   Don&apos;t ask anyone to speak about you, not even contemptuously. And when time<br/>passes and you notice that your name is circulating among men, don&apos;t take<br/>this more seriously than anything else you might find in their mouths. Think<br/>rather that it has become cheapened, and throw it away. Take another name,<br/>any other, so that God can call you in the night.

It wasn&apos;t my goal in mentioning these particular mp3s on this<br/>list, especially because I&apos;m feeling pretty successful with the quirky<br/>mandolin songs I&apos;ve been performing recently.

I&apos;ll comment on others<br/>&gt; after<br/>&gt; hearing them....</p><p>I think there are some stronger ones than &quot;Yard of Vines&quot; that you may enjoy<br/>more, but it&apos;s also sort of &quot;more of the same&quot;.  My system was this: I<br/>prepared three things in advance: tuning, timbre, and title, and then I<br/>improvised completely.  I had mixed results.  There are some that definitely<br/>won&apos;t make it to the internet, and it&apos;s better that way.</p><p>&gt; What didn&apos;t work for me above all was the &apos;form&apos;--there was little to grab<br/>&gt; me<br/>&gt; about the interplay of form and content to keep me wanting to hold on<br/>&gt; until<br/>&gt; the end--an &apos;arc&apos;.

There&apos;s something to be said for making<br/>something up on the spot, but there&apos;s a lot more to be said for planning.<br/>In some of these pieces, I stumbled into something like a &quot;goal,&quot; but I<br/>often just started, played, and stopped.  I can understand why that would<br/>make it less pleasing to listen to.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps your vision might work better thinking about it<br/>&gt; &apos;top-down&apos; (form first) instead of &apos;bottom-up&apos;. See the shape of the<br/>&gt; forest,<br/>&gt; then paint the trees. I&apos;m not imply one should fill a rigid mould, but to<br/>&gt; start out with, I never think that that idea hurts.

I know that great<br/>&gt; things happen &apos;bottom-up&apos; too, but I would suggest that when the itch to<br/>&gt; hit<br/>&gt; fast forward on the mp3 player is in evidence, the large-scale and small<br/>&gt; scale structures are not cohesive. Form.</p><p>I tend to go bottom up at first, and then when I revise, I look at the form<br/>that is emerging and change things around to strenthen it.  This is what I<br/>do with the mandolin, at least.  Because of the nature of this project,<br/>there was no revision.  Just play something and move on.</p><p>&gt; Two ideas to explore: 1st; as you listen to any music, your own<br/>&gt; especially,<br/>&gt; observe your own emotional and physical reaction. Do you lean in with<br/>&gt; interest? Or does your mind wander? Do you want to jump up and down with<br/>&gt; pride and excitement over what you have done? Or do you want to hit fast<br/>&gt; forward? Most important--was it compelling enough that I want to hear it<br/>&gt; again? (that last one really is a mark of great-ness in my book)</p><p>This varies with the music, of course.  Not all music is best to listen to<br/>closely and with interest.  Some trancy, minimalist, etc. kinds of stuff are<br/>best to not focus on and allow to move you unconsciously.  I like that.<br/>That wasn&apos;t what I was going for with these pieces, or with most stuff in<br/>general.  I tend to be interested in what I do, but it&apos;s not easy to look at<br/>one&apos;s own music objectively.  I should try that, though.  I bet I&apos;d learn a<br/>lot.</p><p>&gt; 2nd idea---I think different individuals look for different sensations in<br/>&gt; music, but, in my years of experience listening to and talking about music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with fellow musicians and music lovers, it&apos;s remarkable how many times we<br/>&gt; all<br/>&gt; have orgasms over the same moments, be they rhythmic, harmonic, timbral,<br/>&gt; whatever.

It&apos;s important to me.  Too much analysis<br/>of something, for me, tends to stifle and smother.  Perhaps I could strike a<br/>stronger balance between intuition and reason, though.  Getting out of my<br/>own little universe and thinking about music in general again couldn&apos;t hurt<br/>me.</p><p>&gt; I hope this helps, and I&apos;m only sharing this with you as a fellow<br/>&gt; traveler,<br/>&gt; not to talk down. Just what works/has worked for me.</p><p>It didn&apos;t come across like talking down at all!  Thanks so much for your<br/>comments!  I&apos;m taking them seriously.  It&apos;s important to know your own<br/>strong points and weaknesses.  The next time I do something at the keyboard,<br/>I think I&apos;ll challenge myself to come into it differently.</p><p>&gt; Now, a great Rilke quote about public criticism, I hope it inspires:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;...For I still didn&apos;t understand fame, that public demolition of someone<br/>&gt; who<br/>&gt; is in the process of becoming, whose building-site the mob breaks into,<br/>&gt; knocking down his stones.<br/>&gt;     Young man anywhere, in whom something is welling up that makes you<br/>&gt; shiver,<br/>&gt; be grateful tha no one knows you.

When I first started performing solo,<br/>it was on mandolin, and I had a pseudonym I used, perhaps to avoid being<br/>responsible for what came out of me, to divorce myself from it so I can be<br/>impervious to ridicule, or whatever.  I was less secure with myself.  Today,<br/>I still use the name when I play mandolin songs (Nodal Nim), because I like<br/>it and think it&apos;s fun and works with what I do.  I&apos;m much more comfortable<br/>being personally associated with it now, perhaps because a lot of people<br/>seem to really enjoy it.  I&apos;m like, &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Nodal Nim,&quot; at the beginning,<br/>and after a while, especially if it&apos;s going well, I&apos;ll say something like,<br/>&quot;Thanks, I&apos;m Nodal Nim, but my real name is Andrew.

In<br/>&gt; fact, Aaron, what you have said is really important to me, and I&apos;m going to<br/>&gt; consider it seriously before eking anything new out of my keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- &quot;Aaron K.

Before<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; begin, I just want to say good for you for bravely sticking your nose out<br/>&gt; &gt; there and asking for what I&apos;m sure we all want as artistic<br/>&gt; &gt; personalities--attention (good mostly, but as long as they are talking<br/>&gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; you, well that&apos;s better than nothing, right? ;)--more on the other side<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this below in the Rilke quote) Anyway, I felt the urge to respond right<br/>&gt; &gt; away<br/>&gt; &gt; because I understand how it feels putting things out there and not<br/>&gt; &gt; getting<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the response you would want, let alone *any* response. Let&apos;s face it--we<br/>&gt; &gt; want<br/>&gt; &gt; people to like our stuff. We want ego strokes !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is true.  It wasn&apos;t my goal in mentioning these particular mp3s on<br/>&gt; this list, especially because I&apos;m feeling pretty successful with the quirky<br/>&gt; mandolin songs I&apos;ve been performing recently.  My ego is ok.  I didn&apos;t want<br/>&gt; these to slip through the cracks of commentary, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now, onto the business.... What worked for me first: The title. The mood<br/>&gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; were after. The imagination you have. What I can glean of your aesthetic<br/>&gt; &gt; drive/motivation. Everything I&apos;ve heard from you indicates that with a<br/>&gt; &gt; bit of<br/>&gt; &gt; thought and technique and sweat, you have what it takes to be a very<br/>&gt; &gt; compelling composer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bear in mind, I&apos;ve only heard &apos;Yard of Vines&apos;. I&apos;ll comment on others<br/>&gt; &gt; after<br/>&gt; &gt; hearing them....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think there are some stronger ones than &quot;Yard of Vines&quot; that you may<br/>&gt; enjoy more, but it&apos;s also sort of &quot;more of the same&quot;.  My system was this:<br/>&gt; I prepared three things in advance: tuning, timbre, and title, and then I<br/>&gt; improvised completely.  I had mixed results.  There are some that<br/>&gt; definitely won&apos;t make it to the internet, and it&apos;s better that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What didn&apos;t work for me above all was the &apos;form&apos;--there was little to<br/>&gt; &gt; grab me<br/>&gt; &gt; about the interplay of form and content to keep me wanting to hold on<br/>&gt; &gt; until<br/>&gt; &gt; the end--an &apos;arc&apos;. A bit too &apos;noodle-ey&apos; perhaps, or perhaps a better<br/>&gt; &gt; word<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; might be &apos;meandering&apos;, in that the vision of the piece/improvisation was<br/>&gt; &gt; still inchoate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can absolutely see where you&apos;re coming from with that, Aaron, and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; glad you brought my attention to it.  There&apos;s something to be said for<br/>&gt; making something up on the spot, but there&apos;s a lot more to be said for<br/>&gt; planning. In some of these pieces, I stumbled into something like a &quot;goal,&quot;<br/>&gt; but I often just started, played, and stopped.  I can understand why that<br/>&gt; would make it less pleasing to listen to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Perhaps your vision might work better thinking about it<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;top-down&apos; (form first) instead of &apos;bottom-up&apos;. See the shape of the<br/>&gt; &gt; forest,<br/>&gt; &gt; then paint the trees. I&apos;m not imply one should fill a rigid mould, but to<br/>&gt; &gt; start out with, I never think that that idea hurts. Flexibility and<br/>&gt; &gt; freedom<br/>&gt; &gt; with form comes only after disciplined mastery, anyhow. I know that great<br/>&gt; &gt; things happen &apos;bottom-up&apos; too, but I would suggest that when the itch to<br/>&gt; &gt; hit<br/>&gt; &gt; fast forward on the mp3 player is in evidence, the large-scale and small<br/>&gt; &gt; scale structures are not cohesive. Form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tend to go bottom up at first, and then when I revise, I look at the form<br/>&gt; that is emerging and change things around to strenthen it.  This is what I<br/>&gt; do with the mandolin, at least.  Because of the nature of this project,<br/>&gt; there was no revision.  Just play something and move on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Two ideas to explore: 1st; as you listen to any music, your own<br/>&gt; &gt; especially,<br/>&gt; &gt; observe your own emotional and physical reaction. Do you lean in with<br/>&gt; &gt; interest? Or does your mind wander? Do you want to jump up and down with<br/>&gt; &gt; pride and excitement over what you have done? Or do you want to hit fast<br/>&gt; &gt; forward? Most important--was it compelling enough that I want to hear it<br/>&gt; &gt; again? (that last one really is a mark of great-ness in my book)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This varies with the music, of course.  Not all music is best to listen to<br/>&gt; closely and with interest.  Some trancy, minimalist, etc. kinds of stuff<br/>&gt; are best to not focus on and allow to move you unconsciously.  I like that.<br/>&gt; That wasn&apos;t what I was going for with these pieces, or with most stuff in<br/>&gt; general.  I tend to be interested in what I do, but it&apos;s not easy to look<br/>&gt; at one&apos;s own music objectively.  I should try that, though.  I bet I&apos;d<br/>&gt; learn a lot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2nd idea---I think different individuals look for different sensations in<br/>&gt; &gt; music, but, in my years of experience listening to and talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; music<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; with fellow musicians and music lovers, it&apos;s remarkable how many times we<br/>&gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; have orgasms over the same moments, be they rhythmic, harmonic, timbral,<br/>&gt; &gt; whatever. So I&apos;m convinced that what moves me in some way will move<br/>&gt; &gt; another<br/>&gt; &gt; in a similar way, even if they might *reject* being moved in that way for<br/>&gt; &gt; taste reasons. Composers I know also notice that their most trusted<br/>&gt; &gt; teachers<br/>&gt; &gt; notice the same weaknesses in their pieces that they did, but hoped the<br/>&gt; &gt; teacher would let it slide! Nope....so my 2nd idea would be to listen to<br/>&gt; &gt; something you consider a masterpiece that you would want to more-or-less<br/>&gt; &gt; imitate in some fashion of your choosing, and write a list of the things<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; moved you about it and why. Be clear and as specific as possible. Instead<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;I like the harmony&apos;, write &apos;I liked the disjunct resolutions of the<br/>&gt; &gt; minor<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; seventh chords&apos;. Even write about what you don&apos;t like in certain music. A<br/>&gt; &gt; list like this help one to have clarity about where one wants to go as a<br/>&gt; &gt; composer, and where one want to avoid. The key word here is &apos;clarity&apos;. I<br/>&gt; &gt; think when you have self-directed clarity, the answers to any<br/>&gt; &gt; compositional<br/>&gt; &gt; or inspirational problem are within.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tend to work pretty intuitively.  It&apos;s important to me.  Too much<br/>&gt; analysis of something, for me, tends to stifle and smother.  Perhaps I<br/>&gt; could strike a stronger balance between intuition and reason, though.<br/>&gt; Getting out of my own little universe and thinking about music in general<br/>&gt; again couldn&apos;t hurt me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hope this helps, and I&apos;m only sharing this with you as a fellow<br/>&gt; &gt; traveler,<br/>&gt; &gt; not to talk down. Just what works/has worked for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It didn&apos;t come across like talking down at all!  Thanks so much for your<br/>&gt; comments!  I&apos;m taking them seriously.  It&apos;s important to know your own<br/>&gt; strong points and weaknesses.  The next time I do something at the<br/>&gt; keyboard, I think I&apos;ll challenge myself to come into it differently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now, a great Rilke quote about public criticism, I hope it inspires:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;...For I still didn&apos;t understand fame, that public demolition of someone<br/>&gt; &gt; who<br/>&gt; &gt; is in the process of becoming, whose building-site the mob breaks into,<br/>&gt; &gt; knocking down his stones.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Young man anywhere, in whom something is welling up that makes you<br/>&gt; &gt; shiver,<br/>&gt; &gt; be grateful tha no one knows you. And if those who think you are<br/>&gt; &gt; worthless<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; contradicts you, and if those whom you cal your friends abandon you, and<br/>&gt; &gt; if<br/>&gt; &gt; they want to destroy you because of your precious ideas: what is this<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious<br/>&gt; &gt; danger, which concentrates you inside yourself, compared to the cunning<br/>&gt; &gt; enmity of fame, later, which makes you innocuous by scattering you all<br/>&gt; &gt; around?<br/>&gt; &gt;    Don&apos;t ask anyone to speak about you, not even contemptuously. And when<br/>&gt; &gt; time<br/>&gt; &gt; passes and you notice that your name is circulating among men, don&apos;t take<br/>&gt; &gt; this more seriously than anything else you might find in their mouths.<br/>&gt; &gt; Think<br/>&gt; &gt; rather that it has become cheapened, and throw it away. Take another<br/>&gt; &gt; name,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; any other, so that God can call you in the night. And hide it from<br/>&gt; &gt; everyone.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Rainer Maria Rilke, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Best,<br/>&gt; &gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting, the stuff about names.  When I first started performing solo,<br/>&gt; it was on mandolin, and I had a pseudonym I used, perhaps to avoid being<br/>&gt; responsible for what came out of me, to divorce myself from it so I can be<br/>&gt; impervious to ridicule, or whatever.  I was less secure with myself.<br/>&gt; Today, I still use the name when I play mandolin songs (Nodal Nim), because<br/>&gt; I like it and think it&apos;s fun and works with what I do.  I&apos;m much more<br/>&gt; comfortable being personally associated with it now, perhaps because a lot<br/>&gt; of people seem to really enjoy it.  I&apos;m like, &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Nodal Nim,&quot; at the<br/>&gt; beginning, and after a while, especially if it&apos;s going well, I&apos;ll say<br/>&gt; something like, &quot;Thanks, I&apos;m Nodal Nim, but my real name is Andrew.  I hope<br/>&gt; you&apos;re enjoying my songs.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just use my real name with my xenharmonic keyboard stuff.  I&apos;m not afraid<br/>&gt; to be associated with it.  It&apos;s not all brilliant, but I&apos;m proud of it, and<br/>&gt; I&apos;m more secure in myself than I used to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, that&apos;s enough spilling my guts.   :&lt;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks again for your thoughtfulness, Aaron!
