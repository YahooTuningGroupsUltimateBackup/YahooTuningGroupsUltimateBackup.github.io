But the first question I&apos;d ask is a theoretical one--are you<br/>planning on treating any interval as a fifth, and if so, is it to be<br/>3/5 of an octave or 14/25 of an octave? The latter choice may involve<br/>you in the hexidecimal temperament, with 36/35 and 135/128 as commas;<br/>the former choice has 256/243 in place of 135/128, and may involve you<br/>with the blackwood temperament, with commas 28/27 and 49/48, and<br/>instead of 16 you might be comparing to 15. For this, you might want<br/>to flatten octaves; for the other, sharpen them.</p><p>The point being that theory is not irrelevant to this project, or to<br/>music making in general.</p></div><h3><a id=6427 href="#6427">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2004 3:14:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;M Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; A little while back I posted a link to an amusing item in 10 EDO.<br/>&gt; It was connected with decimilisation.

The alphorn is a famous<br/>swiss folk instrument, which can only play tones of a natural<br/>overtone series, and that&apos;s the tuning I am using (it&apos;s not<br/>_exactly_ folk, though...). The privilege of virtual alphorns is, of<br/>course, the possibility to modulate to other overtone series!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub<br/><a href="http://home.datacomm.ch/straub">http://home.datacomm.ch/straub</a></p></div><h3><a id=6428 href="#6428">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2004 3:22:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@t...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;M Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; A little while back I posted a link to an amusing item in 10 EDO.<br/>&gt; &gt; It was connected with decimilisation.
