I see sharing of<br/>music, and even cooler, I see people helping each other out to<br/>realize musical dreams.</p><p>Sometimes, life is good.</p><p>You honor this place by your sharing, by your creativity, and by your<br/>honest desire to find the musics that each of you embodies. I look<br/>forward to many more whirlwinds of activity, if they are all as warm<br/>and seeking as these have been.</p><p>In the middle of a long week,<br/>after a somewhat numbing concert with &quot;Yes&quot; tonight,<br/>and an early rehearsal tomorrow,<br/>I remain,</p><p>Your grateful List-Mom</p></div>
