It is a problem that comes up again and<br/>again and again. The truth is the major synth manufacturers do<br/>not have are interests in mind when they are designing<br/>machines.</p><p>I just had the idea that the microtonal community should fund<br/>and design their own hardware/software system that does what<br/>we want it to do. We are the only ones that care about this.</p><p>They is enough talent and technical expertise in the microtonal<br/>community to create a commercial line of electronic synthesizers<br/>that would sell well enough in the market place and be exactly<br/>what we want.</p><p>The best way to do this is to have pre-orders that fund the<br/>machine. This is the same as the restaurant that gets funded by<br/>sales of meal tickets before the place is built.</p><p>There is also the possibility of making the macnine both a black<br/>box and the inside of a keyboard.  Starrlabs microzone does not<br/>currently have an internal voice circuit. Here is an opportunity to<br/>provide one!</p><p>It would be nice to see the many different talents here working<br/>together on a such a project.</p><p>Justin</p></div><h3><a id=3030 href="#3030">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/21/2002 2:32:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;200205210601.CAA12187@...&gt;<br/>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt; A better bet than &quot;blind funding&quot; could be attempting to approach one<br/>&gt; of  the good softsynth makers who already have SOME tuning capability,<br/>&gt; and  trying to get MORE of the same by approaching as a community<br/>&gt; instead of  just an individual.

Kyma&apos;s only 3<br/>times the cost of that, its hardware is semi-autonomous so you can<br/>still rely on it for live work, and it also does studio quality morphing,<br/>all the standard effects, spectral analysis, 192 partial additive<br/>synthesis and flexible, extremely accurate tuning support.</p><p>&gt; Apparently it&apos;s worth it, though.

Drone and the Elements<br/>Suite were completely done in Kyma (the latter using a sample) in real<br/>time.  The two guitar pieces were recorded live with all the effects in<br/>Kyma (compare with the Tuning Punks piece that uses the same guitar with<br/>cheaper effects) and the magic demo was recorded real time with a Korg<br/>providing the drums and a TX81Z the bass, both plugged directly into the<br/>Capybara.</p><p>But that only shows you what I&apos;ve had time to throw together.

But the fact of the matter is that we *do* have inexpensive alternatives for getting started in making microtonal music(s), and if some of the other options are more expensive, then maybe they need to be looked at by those who consider it &quot;an investment&quot;.</p><p>Not to mention that my Prophet-5, which was the first commercial (and easily available) microtunable polyphonic synth cost me, in 19-late-70&apos;s dollars, $2750. I considered it a good instrument and used it for years. I didn&apos;t complain, I just saved up for it.</p><p>I&apos;ve got other problems with Kyma and related products, but I&apos;ll save that for another time, along with general topics of other natures.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3039 href="#3039">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante.interport@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2002 10:08:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In reference to the high prices of some software:</p><p>Not that I would ever do such a thing, but I heard from a friend of a friend<br/>who talked to his step-sister&apos;s hairdresser, who overheard two old ladies on<br/>a bus:</p><p>that you can go on the filesharing networks with Limewire etc, and get fully<br/>functional versions of Emagic Logic 5, Cubase, Wavelab, more Directx and VST<br/>plugins than you can shake a stick at, software samplers, etc.</p><p>Can you believe some people would acually do such a thing? whats the world<br/>comming to?</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=3043 href="#3043">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

One of the rules of open source software<br/>(which did<br/>&gt; &gt;get mentioned in the thread) is that you don&apos;t complain about<br/>it if you<br/>&gt; &gt;aren&apos;t prepared to work<br/>&gt; &gt;on it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, yes, I know that, but try to keep in mind that in a diverse<br/>group<br/>&gt; such as this, you can&apos;t *expect* that everyone will have those<br/>kind of<br/>&gt; skills, or even the aptitude for them. My wife is a spectacular<br/>musician,<br/>&gt; but she is also spectacularly ill-suited for programming, a very<br/>conceptual<br/>&gt; thing. People should not whine, but it shouldn&apos;t be the case<br/>that everyone<br/>&gt; needs to abandon one discipline for another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if you are proposing C code put together by weekend<br/>amateurs, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; rather they stick with their instruments, thank you! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes, making music is the most important thing, and it&apos;s what<br/>we&apos;re all<br/>&gt; &gt;here to do.  We&apos;re already well provided for given how few of<br/>us there are.</p><p>That is true, but all special interests groups get noticed alot<br/>more if they are organised and work together.</p><p>&gt; Funny, that is close to my impression as well. But having spent<br/>the last 6<br/>&gt; months experimenting around with what is available, the work<br/>environment<br/>&gt; for microtonal music can still stand a lot of improvement...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3084 href="#3084">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/24/2002 4:16:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;ackhh8+924m@...&gt;<br/>justintonation wrote:</p><p>&gt; What we need to do is come up with a wishlist.
