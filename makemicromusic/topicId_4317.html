Gene? I know he prepares pieces in midi first and (often, or always) then renders a recording using Timidity (right?) which takes a midi file and creates a wav file using samples for the instruments.</p><p>In any event, if he has raw midi files of his stuff there are a lot of differing tunings, and if you could set it up for multi-timbral work, he has some &apos;orchestration&apos; going on as well.</p><p>&gt;Also, is it my imagination or something, but are manufacturers releasing<br/>&gt;their synths with poor quality patches only in an attempt to get you to<br/>&gt;buy their &quot;real&quot; sets of sounds?</p><p>I tend to agree, with one caveat. I&apos;ve taken a look/listen at most of the soft synths people have mentioned on this list, at least if they have demo modes, and almost uniformly been underwhelmed. But the caveat is that (I think) the majority of the makers of the soft synths are somewhat new at synthesis unlike Roland, Korg, Yamaha, etc, who are building on years of architecture. The more soft synths get worked on, the deeper the sound creation capabilities will be.</p><p>OTOH, be sure to take a look at what makes up the synth - the more depth there is in programmability, the more opportunity you may have to get something out of it yourself. Development/marketing curves for software are notoriously short and fast, and I&apos;m not surprised if they have an app ready to go before much work has been done actually creating sounds. And, yes, since they are designed to work on computers it isn&apos;t surprising that techno, electronica, and house (and whatever other current stylism) are predominant, because that *is* their market - for now.</p><p>Also, you&apos;ll have a lot better chance to influence or see changes in evolution with these manufacturers, through correpondence, then you ever would with hardware. We&apos;ve seen people on this list influence developers and get tuning widgets implemented. A lot easier in software than in firmware/hardware, so don&apos;t give up.</p><p>I&apos;m not satisfied yet, but that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t see promise!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4436 href="#4436">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2003 8:24:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael McGonagle</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_4317.html#4317">/makemicromusic/topicId_4317.html#4317</a></p><p>&lt;fndsnd@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my throws of trying out various synths, I am really getting<br/>tired of<br/>&gt; hearing &quot;house&quot;, &quot;techno&quot;, or &quot;trance&quot; things as examples.
