I don&apos;t know if this is having an effect or not.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2003 3:52:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

Got perc sounds. Tonight after I come home from a concert I&apos;ll fire up my real music computer system and rack of synths and see how a Roland JV-1080 interprets it in GM patch mode.</p><p>As for rendering, I don&apos;t have a program that is currently set up to render in generic GM sound sets.</p><p>&gt;I always do that, and don&apos;t worry, that was Manuel&apos;s reaction too.</p><p>Well, this is sounding like bug-land or something.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It would be a slam dunk to remove those events, but I have a hunch<br/>&gt;that it<br/>&gt; &gt; would be removing notes that - even though currently playing<br/>&gt;percussion -<br/>&gt; &gt; are part of the score.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How do I accomplish the slam dunking?</p><p>Welll, you&apos;d need an editor that can show you the midi events in a list format, and simple delete all the channel 10 event. BUT - if those are events that should be notes played in the score, I don&apos;t know if you could simply remap them to another channel; if this truly is a bug in the midi retuning function of Scala, you may be interrupting the cycling of channels to implement the pitch bends.</p><p>I&apos;ll also truncate the file (for expediency) and see about using MF2T, a generic text editor, and T2MF to see what happens. Depends on how late I get in tonight...</p><p>In any event, if hand editing is needed you&apos;re probably going to need a midi editor that you can easily see the events in a list.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
