Lots of good input and a lot of heart-warming personal msgs to me. Profoundly thank all the people that have expressed their thoughts on this forum, past, present, and future.</p><p>So.</p><p>I need to separate myself, and I also wanted a clear break from what *was*. But I mistakenly thought it really wasn&apos;t a big deal. I don&apos;t see many people post, I certainly haven&apos;t gotten a lot of feedback on past requests for projects, etc. Nonetheless, you&apos;re out there, and you know what you want.</p><p>So MMM isn&apos;t going into deep-freeze.</p><p>At some point in the very near future, Ownership of the list (these are Yahoo! terms, not grandiose entitlements) is going to be transferring to Prent Rodgers, and Moderator status will be given to Rick McGowan. It will be up to them to add other moderators if they wish.</p><p>Prent and Rick have been around since the beginning, and I have the utmost respect for them, both in terms of music-making as well as their level demeanors and technical skills in internet matters. The list will be in good hands.</p><p>When I have a couple extra moments, I&apos;ll write up a little post-script and send it to the list when we change ownership and a few details. To those of you that choose to stay, you&apos;ll still have the resources of the list as microtonal music moves further into this millenium. For those who might leave, all I hope is that you leave to make more music somewhere, anywhere else.</p><p>Until the stagehands drop the curtain,<br/>Creating new scales,<br/>Soon to be ex-ListMom,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7221 href="#7221">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2004 6:34:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

I could go on and on, but...</p><p>You know, it was really striking when Carl said my actions were &quot;selfish&quot;. I mean, that really hurt. Yes, this is done because I&apos;ve simply had it, but I don&apos;t think setting up this forum and all the work I&apos;ve done deserves that kind of determination of character, but I bet that is what it says in the dictionary.</p><p>So MMM will stay.

I&apos;d just like people to give due thought to how to interact, what is appropriate, and more than anything else, how to be _supportive_ of each other. Margo touched on a number of these issues quite elegantly in her post, and I publicly confess that she and I have had a number of very wonderful phone conversations in the last few weeks regarding these changes. I will always be indebted to Madame Schulter!</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m usually pretty careful about this, so all of this most probably should &gt;be on a &quot;case by case&quot; and &quot;member by member&quot; basis...</p><p>No. That is exactly the &quot;me first&quot; attitude that rankles: as long as it isn&apos;t *me* causing the problem, as long as the issue doesn&apos;t involve *me* I needn&apos;t speak out, etc. You just HAVE to have value in the group as a whole, to care about how what one person does that might affect someone else, even if it might not be pointed at you.</p><p>But that is just how I&apos;d like a list. In the next few days it will be YOUR list, every one of you, and you can decide how you want it to go, along with Prent and Rick. Who, I am sure, won&apos;t be quite the drama queens that I am! :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7227 href="#7227">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2004 8:47:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
