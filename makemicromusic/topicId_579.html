Go! Go! Go!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Go-go music aside, I actually did try to upload, twice, but was<br/>&gt; unsuccessful. I don&apos;t like the interfaces where you have *no* idea what is<br/>&gt; happening, just waiting; I prefer to upload/download with an ftp client,<br/>&gt; but can&apos;t with Yahoo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried putting up a temp site at Tripod last night, based on a good review<br/>&gt; from CNet, but even there it is *slow*. I can ftp, but it was going to take<br/>&gt; over an hour for my 11.8 meg file to upload, and I don&apos;t know if that is<br/>&gt; really the way to go. I&apos;ll try late tonight when I don&apos;t have to do other<br/>&gt; stuff. Boy, I sure wish I had DSL or cable...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll keep you posted. For now I&apos;ve got that gamelan piece up, and maybe<br/>&gt; will just do snippets of pieces for the near-future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon (who will still try some pieces at t-challenge...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
