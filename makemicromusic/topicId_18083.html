We have documented our work at: <a href="http://www.microtonaltrumpet.com">www.microtonaltrumpet.com</a></p><p>In summary, the project has led to the construction of 2 valve mechanisms which allow me to convert my standard C and B flat concert trumpets to 4-valve microtonal trumpets.  I have converted the C trumpet to a quarter-tone instrument (on which I have also played pieces in eighth-tones) and the B flat to a 19-div instrument.</p><p>Donald and I have now presented our project, as a research forum, lecture recital and workshop to 9 UK music departments as well as special presentations at UK MicroFest and in Germany.  I am also using the microtonal instruments regularly with duo Contour, my partnership with American percussionist Lee Ferguson: <a href="http://www.duocontour.com">www.duocontour.com</a></p><p>I would like to make contact with a wide range of composers/theorists interested in microtonality in relation to some/all of the following projects:<br/>1) Invitations to play a microtonal trumpet recital, either solo (possibly plus electronics and video) or with duo Contour (possibly plus electronics and video)<br/>2) Invitations to talk about the instruments and the project as a whole with Donald Bousted (preferably connected to the above)<br/>3) New Compositions for microtonal trumpets: solo or for duo Contour, possibly with electronics and/or video<br/>4) New Compositions for my &apos;Yasser Collection&apos;.  These are solo pieces (some with electronics) for the 19-div instrument, restricted to 2 pages in length.  There will be 19 eventually (at the present time 10 have been written).</p><p>Please have a look at the website and give us your feedback.  Any thoughts on the above very welcome!</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Steve Altoft</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=18089 href="#18089">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2007 2:50:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stephen Altoft&quot;<br/>&lt;stevealtoft@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Donald and I have now presented our project, as a research forum,<br/>lecture recital and workshop to 9 UK music departments as well as<br/>special presentations at UK MicroFest and in Germany.
