The intonation/tuning<br/>on that<br/>&gt;one, certainly before the percussion comes in, is a perfect example of a<br/>&gt;tuning phenomenon where I feel like the hairs are standing up on end,<br/>&gt;either in my ears, or at least on the back of my neck!</p><p>&gt;There must be some reason - is it the tuning, or the timbres in<br/>combination<br/>&gt;with the tuning, or... ?</p><p>I think the effect here is caused by all the (almost inaudibly) high<br/>frequency stuff. Here&apos;s a rundown on the creation of the sounds used<br/>in &quot;Intersecting Spheres&quot;.</p><p>The basic timbre is harmonic, restricted to all<br/>multiples of 50 Hz. So, for instance, some notes contain<br/>all multiples of 100 Hz, and others contain all multiples<br/>of 150 Hz, etc. The tuning is an additive &quot;overtone&quot; scale<br/>consisting of all multiples of 50 Hz - though only a small<br/>subset of the all the possibilities are actually used.</p><p>When I started crafting the timbres for this piece, I was<br/>basically doing additive-style synthesis (using &quot;metasynth&quot;),<br/>and then passing the result through various nonlinearities<br/>(in metasynth and Matlab). When you pass a signal through<br/>nonlinearities, you get all sorts new overtones, and these<br/>typically are at ever higher frequencies... until you<br/>hit the Nyquist rate (22050 for normal CD recording),<br/>at which point they &quot;fold over&quot; and start descending again.</p><p>Here&apos;s the interesting part: because 22050 is divisible by<br/>50, when the partials fold back, they still lie on the same<br/>50 Hz lattice - they just augment (or decrease) the amplitude<br/>of the partials. So no matter how many nonlinearities you apply,<br/>you still have the same basic &quot;harmonic&quot; template, but with<br/>differing amplitudes. Of course, many of these didnt sound good,<br/>and I later went back and removed (with a low pass filter) many<br/>of the highest frequency things from others.</p><p>So, I think much of the character (the &quot;hair-raising on end&quot;)<br/>of the timbres is due to this unorthodox method of making<br/>the sounds, and in particular, to having so much high frequency<br/>energy...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
