I think others here have commented on the<br/>&gt; scale-within-the-scale concept as well.  What is most Western music, if<br/>&gt; not mostly 7 out of 12? Many (though perhaps not all) traditional musics<br/>&gt; with an extended gamut tend to use various intervallic subsets to build<br/>&gt; melodies and modes. It is a very effective method of organizing coherent<br/>&gt; music from microtonal chaos. Shaahin, Yahya or Ozan could speak far more<br/>&gt; competently on this than I.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would say that  Schoenberg&apos;s use of the row strikes me as a<br/>&gt; particularly dastgah-like approach to using all the tones of 12-edo --<br/>&gt; the pitches arranged to form a &quot;mode&quot; from which the rest of the<br/>&gt; composition evolves. Even more so the works of Josef Hauer, who<br/>&gt; organized 12-edo into two 6-tone &quot;modes&quot;. In my serial experiments, I<br/>&gt; frequently constructed and treated my rows as rags or<br/>&gt; ascending-descending melodic patterns:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C - Db - E - F - G# - A - B - A# - G - F# - Eb - D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
