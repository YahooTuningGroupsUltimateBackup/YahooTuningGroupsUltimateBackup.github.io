An FFT analysis of the composite was performed, and the tuning<br/>&gt; was derived from there. This process also included resythesis of the<br/>&gt; combined waveform to aurally check to see if the program got it<br/>&gt; right.</p><p>I suppose taking the most prominent partials from an FFT of each timbre<br/>and putting them all together would have the same effect?  Another<br/>approach would be to find the most consonant interval for each pair of<br/>timbres by ear, and combine them all to make a scale.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s the resulting tuning/mode used in the piece and formed from<br/>&gt; the prominent partials found in the FFT and verified by hearing the<br/>&gt; resynthesized waveform:</p><p>And when you say &quot;formed from&quot; do you mean you put them all relative to<br/>the tonic?</p><p>&gt; The savvy reader will surely realize that because the composite<br/>&gt; timbre had several octaves of mixed inharmonic timbres, that the FFT<br/>&gt; should reveal octaves in the tuning - and yes this is true. Even<br/>&gt; though the partial structures of the individual timbres may not have<br/>&gt; contained exact octaves at 2/1, because they were combined, the<br/>&gt; octave was prominent in the FFT.</p><p>Um, what?  You mean that because there are so many intervals, some of them<br/>must be close to an octave?</p><p>&gt; Here we are dealing with percussion sounds, but I propose that this<br/>&gt; would be highly interesting to explore with electronic timbres as<br/>&gt; well. Of course as Bill Sethares has thoroughly explored, resynthesis<br/>&gt; provides a way to create timbres with common partial structures - but<br/>&gt; what about if one doesn&apos;t wish to resynthesize the timbres, as in the<br/>&gt; case of the totally acoustic timbres used in Talismandala? Again, the<br/>&gt; *big question* is how to find a good tuning for disparate selections<br/>&gt; of timbres with radically different partial structures.</p><p>With real percussion instruments, the timbre doesn&apos;t scale with pitch,<br/>which is something else you could take into account.  In your example, the<br/>low gong could be treated like a drone, and other instruments tuned<br/>relative to it.  You can do a full Setharian calculation like this, have<br/>the drone constant and vary two other timbres.  Which would mean the whole<br/>scale transposing every time the drone changes.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1027 href="#1027">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>10/11/2001 9:33:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;9q4a4r+2ujc@...&gt;<br/>Jacky wrote:</p><p>&gt; An important aside: Are the timbres we consider to be harmonic, truly<br/>&gt; and *purely harmonic*, when we consider that resonators contribute<br/>&gt; formant - static frequencies, in sounds like the human voice and the<br/>&gt; violin?</p><p>There are two points here.</p><p>Are real world timbres purely harmonic?

Isn&apos;t that around C?</p><p>I think so, mathematically.  I don&apos;t have anything approaching perfect<br/>pitch.</p><p>&gt; A very good point. When I do resynthesis with Wavanal - just one<br/>&gt; program I use for this - it is not able to recreate the noise<br/>&gt; components, but one can tell by its resynthesis that it is getting<br/>&gt; the partials correct (in the sustain stage). I know that this app<br/>&gt; will let you re-enter different values to create another spectrum, so<br/>&gt; it might be cool to try to paste some attack transients onto the<br/>&gt; beginning of the sustain stage rendered by it, to create new sounds -<br/>&gt; but I&apos;ve not tried it yet. One would have to create a new decay stage<br/>&gt; for this though - easy to do really.</p><p>One good thing about Kyma&apos;s spectrum editor is that you can hear the<br/>timbre at any time as a sustained note, and drag the pointer backwards and<br/>forwards.  This does give some interesting results.  Also hear each<br/>partial in isolation, or any combination thereof.  So I might be able to<br/>grab a good drum spectrum and use it for another purpose.</p><p>&gt; This is what I like to do, is create a velocity cross-fade sample<br/>&gt; instrument. Typically, I&apos;ll do something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Midi Velocities<br/>&gt; 0-90<br/>&gt; 91-100<br/>&gt; 101-110<br/>&gt; 111-127<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the four layers of the Akai, which seems to respond well to my<br/>&gt; keyboard and playing force (this is the one used on Talismandala).<br/>&gt; Sometimes I may roll this down 10 though, depending on the samples<br/>&gt; used. Somtimes I like to overlap them as well.</p><p>Yes, I might try that with these &quot;tak&quot; samples, as it looks like they can<br/>be treated as a single pitch.  Also combine similar sounding mono samples<br/>to get a stereo one.  I remember you saying you recorded the whole drum<br/>part twice to do this kind of thing.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
