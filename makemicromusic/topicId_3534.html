If *at all possible*, one does NOT want differing formats that, on the surface, could be easily confused. I am hoping (as I indicated maybe Manuel would be able to, or through &apos;testimonials&apos; from Scala users, that a convincing argument could be made that there is already an established standard *and* user base) that the Metasynth people might see the advantages of &apos;buying into&apos; that body of users/files already out there.</p><p>Sigh. Were that the world was really synchronous in it&apos;s developments...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3535 href="#3535">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@...</h3><span>6/28/2002 1:25:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes I share the same concern.
