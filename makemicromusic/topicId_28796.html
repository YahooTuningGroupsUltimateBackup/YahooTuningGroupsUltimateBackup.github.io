They are probably not useful to you, but if you&apos;re working on some of the same kinds of problems I am, they could change your life.</p><p>I offer these for free, and &quot;as is&quot;.  Some have documentation, some don&apos;t.  They all work fine, but they all have a few subtle minor bugs.  None will crash your computer or give you a disease.</p><p>The idea is to share.  But I don&apos;t have a lot of time for back-and-forth, unless someone happens to find something useful for their work.  There might be a few people who see this list for whom that would be the case.  If someone really uses one of these apps for their work, I&apos;ll be happy to explain or write a tutorial.</p><p>In most of the apps, we&apos;ve made the extra effort to allow for microtonal tuning by making the tuning modulus user-definable.   You&apos;re not locked into a 12-tone series in a 12-tone tuning.</p><p>Link:</p><p><a href="https://www.box.com/shared/tjp21be0om">https://www.box.com/shared/tjp21be0om</a></p><p>Short description of the apps:</p><p>PermROT -- little app for making tables of permutations, any kind of symbols.  Saves lots of time over making tables by hand.  Useful for seeing, for example, what the &quot;every third note&quot; permutation is, instantly.  Every-other perms is default, but any pattern is possible. You can flip the table around to any orientation.  Might be useful for things other than music. Has directions.</p><p>HandAlg -- generates self-similar number series.  User defines general pattern.  Program tests and prints any successful solutions.  Any modulus or length of series, within time limits.  No filters -- just define and print.  Has directions.</p><p>LinchoY -- makes arrays with a given series, and a lot more.  Assumes 12-tone tuning, but allows series shorter than 12, repeated notes, etc.   I use this almost every day.  Latest version has important bug fixes.    Extensive, sophisticated, and user-awful.  Command-line.  I&apos;ve been using this since the 80&apos;s.  Documentation is old.</p><p>DiscreteLogCalc -- finds &quot;index series&quot; of discrete logarithms, which make partially self-similar series.  This has been mostly supplanted by HandAlg and FamRes.jar, which are both more useful.  But if you want to know what the indices of 5 ^ n mod 19 are, this is your baby.  Has directions.</p><p>Contour.jar -- Generates and tests series that are based on a user-defined contour.  The idea is to explore &quot;expansions&quot; of a given musical shape -- expansions on the vertical axis.  *Any tuning modulus, any length series*.  Contour can be filled in with as many undefined x&apos;s as the user wishes.  Extensive filters.  I use it all the time.  No doc, yet.  Ask, if you&apos;re serious.  A generalized contour is perceivable in ways that a specific interval-series is not.</p><p>FamResF.jar -- Generates and tests self-similar series, with filters for harmony, intervals, etc.<br/>This is the newest app.  Allows any tuning modulus, any length series (but long series will take forever to generate and test).  Useful for the pre-composition phase where you design your series.  This app allows you to find self-similar series that are not quite &quot;perfect&quot;.  Because there is only one class of four series that are &quot;perfect&quot;, (in 12-tone, the indices of 12 ^ n mod 13)  I&apos;m interested in finding series that are as musically useful as the &quot;perfect&quot; case -- or more so, but with user-defined wiggle-room, or error-tolerance, so to speak.   Similar shapes are as musically useful as identical shapes.  Family resemblance is as useful as &quot;invariance&quot;, possibly more so.  (Think of the song Do, A Deer.)   No doc, yet.  Ask if serious about using it.</p></div><h3><a id=28797 href="#28797">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2012 8:34:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for sharing it.
