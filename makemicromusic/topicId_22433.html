Before<br/>I got into non 12 edo music I heard a 12 edo semitone interval as a<br/>pleasing concord (and still do). I also find a major chord with an<br/>augmented fourth added a pleasing concord aswell as singing a major<br/>seventh on top of a minor chord. Possibly because of this, I sometimes<br/>compose love songs that sound menacing to some people.&quot;<br/>   I&apos;m interested to know if others on here agree with the above statements...do any of the rest of you agree with &quot;Mark&quot;?</p><p>    I find all of the above quite discordant &quot;even&quot; with a very pure guitar instrument as the timbre.  I also hear the major 7th on top of a minor chord arrangement as &quot;even&quot; more discordant than a fairly clustered 10:11:12 chord.  Note I&apos;m not using &quot;standard practice theory&quot; nor critical band dissonance or JI to analyze the chords, just my ears.<br/>  I also wonder how many of you &quot;used&quot; to think of chords like the above as discordant, but have somehow trained your brains via micro-tonal listening to think of them as otherwise.</p><p>   Personally I used to think 22TET, BP, and 7TET sounded very odd...now they sound nearly as natural to me as 12TET and, if I temper certain intervals slightly, sometimes more concordant.  Correct me if you think I&apos;m wrong...but do many of you think ease of micro-tonal listening is a gradual learned process that starts as requiring focus but becomes fairly automatic...much like the sub-conscious counter-steering you use to balance a bicycle?</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22437 href="#22437">ðŸ”—</a>markallanbarnes &#x3C;mark.barnes3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2010 5:09:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m fairly sure my tastes change over time and this is a form of learning. I was interested when someone described narrow interval chords such as 25/24 as &quot;sour&quot; because when I was a child I loved sour flavours and would eat slices of lemon and eat tartaric acid crystals straight from the bag. I only stopped because I thought it would destroy my teeth. In those days I had a taste for natural minor scales, which I found more beautiful than major scales. Encountering minor seconds and diminished and augmented triads (in 12 edo), I at first found them ugly, though I now find them beautiful. For some reason I think of scales inwhich the steps are of similar sizes as being &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;rounded&quot; and think of scales inwhich there are steps of very different sizes as being &quot;spiky&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;. This is obviously confusing since flat and sharp usually have very different meanings in music. To me, something like thata bhairaw (1, 16/15, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 15/8, 2) is very spiky, ascending harmonic minor is less spiky, natural major is rounded, and 7 edo is more rounded still. I think 5 edo somehow manages to sound rounder than 7 edo, but a chromatic scale in 12 edo somehow manages to sound  a bit spiky to me. I particularly noticed 16/15 sounding like a harmony in an Imrat Khan performance of Raga Madhuvanti which begins with repeated alternation between the chikari (1 and 2/1) and ni shudha on the main melody string (15/16). This was not the first time I heard the interval as a harmony, but it is a recording of an established musician using what might be classed as a dischord in a way that I find hard to imagine sounding dischordant.</p></div><h3><a id=22439 href="#22439">ðŸ”—</a>markallanbarnes &#x3C;mark.barnes3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2010 7:45:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am curious, Michael (djtrancendance), as to why you put my name in inverted commas.
