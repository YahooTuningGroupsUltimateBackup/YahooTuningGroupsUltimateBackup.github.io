In addition to the<br/>&gt; standard of the western world, equal temperament, four other<br/>&gt; tuning systems are available.</p><p>I assume that means there are four &apos;presets&apos;, others you would have<br/>to load yourself.</p><p>Interesting question for members of this forum, if you had four 12-<br/>tone tunings to choose from, which four would you think?</p><p>From where I&apos;m coming from, I would think Quarter-comma meantone,<br/>plus some irregular circulating temperament such as Werckmeister III,<br/>the other two would have to be non-western. And the truth is, it<br/>occurs to me, there is not a single non-western tuning I know how to<br/>tune.

Although once they started using the<br/>accidentals (which they most likely didn&apos;t on the 8-string Greek<br/>instruments, I would think), say in the 14th century or so, they came<br/>up with refinements. Tune pure fifths B flat -- F -- C -- G -- D -- A<br/>-- E, then temper B so the third G-B beats the same as, or a little<br/>more than, the fifth B-E, then tune the sharps in pure fifths from B.</p><p>It&apos;s sometimes called &apos;Boulliau Temperament&apos;, it&apos;s quite nice for a<br/>lot of keyboard music written in the church modes. Is that what<br/>you&apos;re referring to, the B as a sort-of mean between G and E? Bit of<br/>a stretch.
