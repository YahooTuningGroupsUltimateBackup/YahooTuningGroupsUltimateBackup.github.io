Version 2, which I have now, will<br/>require over 300,000 manually entered computer commands just to get<br/>the string section retuned to 53-equal (which I&apos;m beginning to<br/>pursue). They&apos;re working on version 3.0, which I hope will allow for<br/>custom tuning macros or even built-in templates. I was told the more<br/>demand for this there is the better my chances of getting my request.<br/>Thank you, those of you who wrote to them and asked about this. They<br/>have written back and said they are considering it! So I&apos;m asking<br/>again, if you haven&apos;t already done so, to tell them what kind of<br/>tuning system interests you (the more different kinds the better, and<br/>they don&apos;t even have to understand exactly which tuning systems you<br/>want to use), and tell them you might be interested in Gigastudio if<br/>they have microtonal-friendly features, at least a macro so that any<br/>tuning template you create can be reused for other samples in the<br/>sound library.<br/>By the way, their sample sound library is awesome. It&apos;s so good, you<br/>can only tell the difference between their samples and a real<br/>instrument in an intimate solo setting. The orchestral and ensemble<br/>sounds of any kind are so well-sampled you could make a commercial CD<br/>from them (and a lot of movie score writers are). Too bad they only<br/>work well with 12-equal so far.<br/>Their e-mail addresses are gigateam@... and<br/>custser@.... I&apos;d love it if you could write them very soon.<br/>THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!!!<br/>Chris Mohr</p></div><h3><a id=3683 href="#3683">ðŸ”—</a>Stan Hoffman &#x3C;stanhoffman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2002 8:26:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very good news about GigaStudio--I&apos;ve sent them an email encouraging them to<br/>make it easy for the less technical among us.</p><p>Can you recommend a sample library for solo orchestral instruments?

I&apos;m still new to Gigastudio myself, especially since I<br/>couldn&apos;t get it to work micrtonally. However, Garritan Strings (about<br/>$1000) are fantastic, as is Gigaharp. That leaves lost of unknown<br/>territory in the winds and brass, I know. I think there&apos;s a Garritan<br/>Strings lite for $300, but I&apos;m only guessing that it woiuld be just<br/>as good but with fewer obscure bowings.<br/>Chris Mohr</p></div><h3><a id=3688 href="#3688">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2002 12:19:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>Probably you know this already, and of course tuning table like support<br/>is much better if one can get it, but just in case it is new to you<br/>it may be worth mentioning you can do microtonal work<br/>in Giga using pitch bends.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a few examples up on my <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> web site.<br/><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/330/robert_inventor.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/330/robert_inventor.html</a><br/>- the improvisation in Margo&apos;s sesquisexta, and the<br/>17-et improvisations at the end of the page, and the<br/>octony lullaby, and improvisation in 55-et.

I think so, but if not, I have to say I&apos;m<br/>new to Gigastudio and these samples. The Garritan Strings are<br/>absolutely fabulous, and so is Garritan harp. I&apos;m not wild about the<br/>brass and winds out there for soloistic use, tho they sound pretty<br/>good in a full orchestral texture. Gary Garritan says he is working<br/>on winds and brass, so I will hold out until he gets his on the<br/>market.<br/>East West Sounds has audio CDs full of examples of how these sampled<br/>sounds can sounhd in the context of complete pieces.<br/>Hope this helps.<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Stan Hoffman &lt;stanhoffman@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Very good news about GigaStudio--I&apos;ve sent them an email<br/>encouraging them to<br/>&gt; make it easy for the less technical among us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you recommend a sample library for solo orchestral instruments?<br/>I have a<br/>&gt; big project to do quickly and the Xsample solo instruments I have,<br/>although<br/>&gt; very good, are not useable &quot;out of the box&quot;--they require a great<br/>deal of<br/>&gt; monkeying with to get them to sound right.

I&apos;m very new to Gigastudio, so this is<br/>ALL new to me. I&apos;m taking one last summer vacation and when I get<br/>back, I&apos;ll be putting myself through the paces to learn Gigastudio<br/>and add this to the mix. The big question is whether I would be able<br/>to set up a &quot;template&quot; of pitch bended notes that I can use over and<br/>over, or will every single note I play have to be manually pitch<br/>bended? Ina ny event, several microtonalists have now answered my<br/>plea, which is also good news for my prospects for getting Gigastudio<br/>intpo the microtonal realms in the Version 3.0. I&apos;m very encouraged.<br/>Woreking on this alone, coming into it cold, has been very isolating,<br/>and finding a few like-minded souls on the internet is very<br/>heartwarming!<br/>Chris Mohr&gt;</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/330/robert_inventor.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/330/robert_inventor.html</a><br/>&gt; - the improvisation in Margo&apos;s sesquisexta, and the<br/>&gt; 17-et improvisations at the end of the page, and the<br/>&gt; octony lullaby, and improvisation in 55-et.
