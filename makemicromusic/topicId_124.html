That larger<br/>&gt; number explains my reaction for sure!  It&apos;s strongest, to my ear, in the<br/>&gt; transition between measures 20 and 21 (around 26 seconds in the<br/>&gt; sequence).  Here, C*5 falls to C&apos;5, and E*4 falls to E&apos;4, very<br/>&gt; noticeable and something I need to get used to.  Again, as the piece<br/>&gt; concludes, between measures 25 and 27 E*4 falls to E&apos;4, and I hear that<br/>&gt; as a bit of a &quot;strained&quot; sound (to my unaccustomed ear).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This can be startling to listeners in the 16th century or 21st<br/>&gt; &gt; century, definitely &quot;xenharmonic,&quot; and something that got Vicentino<br/>&gt; &gt; very mixed reviews.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Har!  Those were hot times in Old Italy, no?  I&apos;m reluctant to side<br/>&gt; against Vicentino, however, at least without giving my ear a chance to<br/>&gt; get used to the effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/JdL/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/JdL/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then download your choice(s):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    invoc4a.mid    Margo&apos;s Invocatio in Margo&apos;s own tuning<br/>&gt;    invoc4a12.mid  Margo&apos;s Invocatio in 12-tET<br/>&gt;    invoc4aer3.mid Margo&apos;s Invocatio in JdL&apos;s 5-limit adaptive tuning</p><p>Hi John,</p><p>As always, I like your adaptive-JI retuning of this piece.<br/>However, I&apos;m one of those people who aren&apos;t bothered by<br/>commatic (and other) shifts, and the first time I heard<br/>Margo&apos;s piece in *her* tuning, that diesis-shift section<br/>at m. 20-21 jumped right out and grabbed me by the ears!<br/>I *love* it!!</p><p>So, the moral... give your ears a chance, they might<br/>surprise your brain.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/1/2001 8:20:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi</p><p>Like Monz it takes a lot to really sound sour to my ears, and the<br/>first time I played Margo&apos;s piece on this computer with a<br/>SoundBlaster Live card it sounded gorgeous and alive.  However I<br/>played it the other day for a classically trained tenor and he<br/>visibly winced when those &quot;dieses&quot; were played.  I would have passed<br/>it off to musical habits except  that he is someone who has been<br/>listening to my music for a while and is quite enthusiastic about it.</p><p>Anyway we went into the studio and I started playing the same file<br/>through a K2500 orchestral card.  It sounded much better to my<br/>friend, even with the trumpets.  It sounded a lot better to him when<br/>we fiddled with the instrument used, with cello, frenchhorn and flute<br/>working well for his ears.</p><p>Anyway my conclusions (just as a starting point for discussion).  The<br/>sound card playing back the midi file really does make a difference.<br/>Although Soundblaster is supposed to have a resolution of 1 cent it<br/>doesn&apos;t sound nearly as full and rich and detailed (obviously) as the<br/>K2500 which also has a resolution of 1 cent but is 24 bit. In<br/>particular I am thinking of Pauls comment about beating and wondering<br/>how much that had to do with his soundcard.
