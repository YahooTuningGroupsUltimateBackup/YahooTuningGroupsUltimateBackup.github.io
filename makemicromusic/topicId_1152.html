No way...</p><p>&gt;I use Matlab for just about<br/>&gt;everything, but haven&apos;t used it to make music yet (aside from<br/>&gt;isolated chords). Can you describe your procedure more fully?</p><p>The part that I use Matlab for is the spectral mapping stuff.<br/>Basically, I begin with a sound I like, turn it into a wav file,<br/>which can then be read into Matlab via the &quot;wavread&quot; command.<br/>What matlab does nicely is to take FFTs and lets me manipulate<br/>the sounds in the frequency domain - since its a programming<br/>language, it&apos;ll do anything you ask (albeit non-real time and<br/>somewhat awkwardly... please dont take me for an advocate of<br/>Matlab, its just a daily fact of life in my department.)</p><p>After suitable manipulation (in this case, moving the various<br/>partials of the sound around a bit), I translate it back into<br/>a time signal and then into a wav file.</p><p>Usually the sounds I start with are from an ASR-10 sampler, so I then<br/>take the spectrally mapped versions and put them back into<br/>the sampler - rebuilding the &quot;instruments&quot; (collections of<br/>samples that get played together) more or less as they were.<br/>So then I sequence and/or play the pieces from the sampler.</p><p>&gt;P.S. I posted some words about your 19-tET piece on the Tuning List --<br/>&gt; you might want to check in over there for people&apos;s reactions.</p><p>Thanks... I&apos;ll look over there...</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=1153 href="#1153">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2001 3:58:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill, no one can seem to download the musical examples on your<br/>website.

Now 4:7:9 is actually very accurate in 11-tET,<br/>but of course the &quot;6&quot; isn&apos;t represented at all. Did you map this down<br/>to 654 cents, or up to 763 cents? I&apos;m guessing the former, but<br/>actually I&apos;m not quite sure. I have a very good ear, but evidently<br/>when you screw with the timbres, you&apos;re removing its usual points of<br/>reference!</p><p>Scratching my head,<br/>Paul</p></div>
