I meet all your criteria for being non-spam, but get it back in my face. You should probably take a closer look at your spam filter setup; if my very benign post bounced, you might not be receiving other benign mail, probably of a more important nature than mine (and the other list members).</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
