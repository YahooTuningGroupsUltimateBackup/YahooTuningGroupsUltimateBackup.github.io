There&apos;s an<br/>option to show the card with no background<br/>sound which should cope with ones that<br/>don&apos;t let you stop it any other way.</p><p>Also has a play link which one can use if<br/>the browser doesn&apos;t support background sound,<br/>or if one has stopped play and wants to<br/>listen to it again.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/index.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/index.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
