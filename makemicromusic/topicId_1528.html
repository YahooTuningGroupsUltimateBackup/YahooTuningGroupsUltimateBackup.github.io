A partner of mine and I ran our<br/>own creative underground cassette label between 1985-95, which had<br/>over 70 releases of music with a wildly wide range of styles<br/>represented. There was microtonality, comedy, rock, dance music,<br/>jazz, electro-acoustic &quot;classical&quot; styled, free-form improvisation<br/>etc.</p><p>All this was going on during a time in which the technology to record<br/>our own CDs was still out of reach, so being unable to do this, we<br/>harnessed the power of the venerable cassette to network with other<br/>artists and &quot;zines&quot;. The exciting vibe about the flourishing taper<br/>scene, was that of total unchained creativity, and it showed me that<br/>what we see/hear coming through the popular media hardly represents<br/>the true ground of creative work that one likely would never become<br/>aware of through the usual popular means.</p><p>The underground cassette review &quot;Zine&quot; was a vital part of this Home<br/>Taper Scene, and this is where one would hope to get their music<br/>reviewed, and would offer ways to network with others doing<br/>interesting creative work. This is where I first became aware of the<br/>fantastic music of Dan Stearns. Truly some of the best that was going<br/>on. What a delight it was to come to this internet community to find<br/>Dan here - and also learn that his deep creativity extended into the<br/>field of microtonality.</p><p>Now with the power of the internet and mp3, things happen much more<br/>quickly than for the Home Tapers. One can create music, and the same<br/>day deliver it to those who wish to hear it. It is like a dream come<br/>true really, to be able to network this way. No more snail mail -<br/>just instant gratification. And with the ability to publish to the<br/>web, what are the online equivalent of the Zines, the opportunities<br/>for the microtonally inclined are also greatly increased. Not to<br/>mention exciting forums like Make Micro Music, where we all have the<br/>wonderful opportunity to come together to share our diverse<br/>approaches to this beautiful art form.</p><p>While all of this may be taken for granted if it&apos;s all one has ever<br/>known, when one has had to work with much less, then it is easily<br/>apparent how things have changed for the better.</p><p>While on the one hand I hold in highest regard the effort to create<br/>microtonal CD works, I&apos;m still even more at heart an advocate of just<br/>playing for the pure joy of it. I feel that it is not always<br/>necessary for us to have to be making some kind of imagined &quot;high<br/>brow art&quot; in order to just have fun and great pleasure from what<br/>microtonality offers us. This simple pleasure of &quot;just playing&quot; for<br/>enjoyment, is what keeps me going through the years, and not<br/>ironically, casual playing has taught me more about microtonality<br/>than all I&apos;ve been able to &quot;read&quot; about it. The emotional impact and<br/>power of musically exploring the rich palette that microtonality<br/>brings to the curious composer/musician is in large part ineffable.<br/>Basically this is because sound/tuning has a somewhat symbolic<br/>emotional impact, and as one might guess, the words we use to<br/>describe &quot;things&quot; are not the things themselves - in this regard,<br/>there is an *understanding* coming through the music that defies our<br/>ability to always and in every case define it. Musical experience of<br/>and with microtonaltiy is the way to really begin to grasp its<br/>powerful nature in music. When one sits down to their chosen<br/>instrument and begins to play and explore the new sound patterns, and<br/>directly experience the emotional impact of new tunings outside of 12<br/>tET, this is where the ineffable &quot;magic&quot; is discovered.</p><p>Back during the Home Taper days, I got to hear many different kinds<br/>of new music - some rough - some brilliantly polished, and I always<br/>made an effort to deeply listen and appreciate what the musician was<br/>trying to say, no matter how roughly recorded the music was. It was<br/>just the excitement of being able to network and share music in this<br/>creative scene that kept me interested in what other creative people<br/>were doing for the better part of 10 years.</p><p>This is the same hand and set of ears that I like to apply to what I<br/>encounter in this forum. While it&apos;s easy for some to say things<br/>like &quot;I don&apos;t care for much microtonal music that I hear being made&quot;,<br/>it takes Courage to Encourage, and even more Courage to Create. To<br/>me, there is no &quot;lesser vision&quot;. I&apos;m excited about new listening<br/>experiences - I&apos;m constantly wishing to hear new creative work,<br/>especially if I know the artist(s) who are doing the creative work.<br/>Everyone&apos;s unique take in this art form is where my direct interest<br/>lies.</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m extending to the members of this vibrantly creative<br/>group. I will listen attentively to every single piece of music that<br/>anyone at all posts here, and make an effort to comment. It matters<br/>not to me if it&apos;s played on a single keyboard timbre, or a symphony<br/>orchestra - it matters not if it&apos;s got noise, clicks and pops - it<br/>matters not to me if it sounds like 8 bit audio played through a<br/>Victrola. I&apos;ll listen to anything and be interested, because it is<br/>here in this forum, where individuals have gathered to finally turn<br/>the theories into realities, that I&apos;ve found an environment that I<br/>like to call &quot;home&quot;.  Tuning alone does not good music make, and it<br/>is a honor to be in a place where others are up to the ultimate and<br/>larger challenge of making it live in music.</p><p>May 2002 bring abundance to all, in music, joy and life.</p><p>In Peace,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2002 7:25:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1528">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1528</a></p><p>&gt; The Courage to Encourage<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .........................<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like Dan Stearns was active for about a 10 year period in what<br/>was<br/>&gt; then called the &quot;Home Taper&apos;s Scene&quot;.

You have to understand that I&apos;m working on several<br/>different artistic levels at once, and that not everything<br/>is &quot;presentable&quot; as of yet -- even some of the stuff that I&apos;ve<br/>presented! I like to take ideas that inspire my musical imagination,<br/>but that I am not yet ready to incorporate into the kind of live<br/>performer/audience interplay that is by far the most important kind<br/>of musical experience for me, and _talk_ about them, so that others<br/>may find their own musical inspiration from them as well. Meanwhile,<br/>the various planes I am working on are slowly, on a lifetimespan,<br/>expanding and coming closer to one another in a full artistic vision.<br/>I am sorry that I feel uninspired by much microtonal music --<br/>hopefully you can see that I am even more critical of myself than I<br/>am of others, and hopefully you will appreciate my reasons for not<br/>indulging your direct interest at this moment. Most likely, within<br/>this year of 2002 I will be able to do much more to indulge it -- and<br/>do keep up the encouragement toward all parties -- you do a mighty<br/>fine job of it (as opposed to a certain supposed &quot;encourager&quot; who<br/>operates through lies, deception, ad hominem attacks, manipulation of<br/>out-of-context quotes, and logical fallacy).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll listen to anything and be interested, because it is<br/>&gt; here in this forum, where individuals have gathered to finally turn<br/>&gt; the theories into realities, that I&apos;ve found an environment that I<br/>&gt; like to call &quot;home&quot;.  Tuning alone does not good music make, and it<br/>&gt; is a honor to be in a place where others are up to the ultimate and<br/>&gt; larger challenge of making it live in music.</p><p>I hope to present a &quot;tuning-math Pelog&quot; musical example for you<br/>relatively soon.</p></div>
