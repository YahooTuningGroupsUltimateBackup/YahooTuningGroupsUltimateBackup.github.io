You<br/>won&apos;t know what this is until you get there but it&apos;s a<br/>special moment when this noticable brain shift happens<br/>and it actually releases endorphins! It&apos;s way-cool!</p><p>Hm, maybe that&apos;s why some of us are into this crazy<br/>stuff - we&apos;re addicted to it! Sniff! Sniff! What&apos;s that<br/>new scale? Whew! Hoo boy!</p><p>This is also why many of us encourage those who do not<br/>have any music to share to stop yakking about this and<br/>that and get down to business! We are genuinely sad to<br/>see so much potential talent squandered searching for<br/>some holy perfect scale or grand universal tuning when<br/>life contunually beckons offline. It&apos;s a lifetime&apos;s<br/>worth of joyful exploration and discovery and the<br/>sooner one unplugs the telephone from the wall&apos; the<br/>sooner one can start living!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
