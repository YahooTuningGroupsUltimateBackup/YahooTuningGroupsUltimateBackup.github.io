I&apos;ll post something later tonight to get the resources page started.</p><p>Just a quicky: Manuel, I had installed the latest version of Scala, and while running it I noticed a real icky problem with the file dialogues - there were times when going to load a new scale it took more than 20-30 seconds for the dialogue box to come up. I thought the program had actually locked up. Is the latest release, as far as you know, pretty much bug-free? I&apos;m using a system with Win98SE, 1.4 Pentium 4...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
