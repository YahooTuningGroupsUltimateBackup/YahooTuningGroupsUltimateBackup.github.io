What I meant is that not every note from 12-<br/>equal can be harmonized in every possible 13-limit way.  For instance<br/>only 5 or 6 notes can have a 16/13 neutral third, likewise only a<br/>certain number can get 11/6 neutral sevenths...for each type of 11 or<br/>13-limit interval, there are only certain notes from 12-equal that<br/>can be used since there are only 5 11- and 13-limit frets.  So if<br/>your piece used, say, a G# with an 11/9 neutral third, you couldn&apos;t<br/>play it on the Ultra Plus.  If it was an A with an 11/9 though, then<br/>you&apos;d be fine.</p><p>If you&apos;d like, you can even post the chords used in your piece and I<br/>can tell you which ones would be playable and which wouldn&apos;t.</p></div>
