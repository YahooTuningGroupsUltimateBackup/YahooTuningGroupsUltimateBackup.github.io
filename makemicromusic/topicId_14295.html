This is an<br/>evolving art.</p><p>By the way, you can see two different approaches for Sagittal notation<br/>of certain scales or pieces which use mainly notes from the upper<br/>12-note keyboard of the Peppermint 24 temperament by comparing the<br/>notation in <a href="http://BlackLaundry.zip">BlackLaundry.zip</a> to that in a file to which I posted a URL<br/>earlier today:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Shur17.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Shur17.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>In the zip archive, things are notated with reference to C on the lower<br/>keyboard, meaning _lots_ of /|\ signs, here representing both the<br/>33:32 or &quot;11-diesis&quot; (as in JI), and also the Archytas or septimal<br/>thirdtone at 28:27, with the Peppermint step of 59 cents serving both<br/>purposes. In the Shur17.pdf version, however, C/|\ on the upper<br/>keyboard becomes simply &quot;C&quot; -- and intervals and Sagittal symbols are<br/>measured from it.</p><p>Comparing the two versions of the three-voice piece _Black Laundry_<br/>may suggest how the latter notation can be simpler when a piece uses<br/>mostly notes on the upper keyboard. Also, the latter version uses the<br/>spelling A-C|||)-F|||) for a cadential sonority spelled A/|\-D-G in<br/>the first version. The two are synonymous in Peppermint, but in a JI<br/>reading, the new version raises C and F precisely by 243:224, giving<br/>the just 7:9:12 which Peppermint very closely approximates. The<br/>earlier version in a JI reading raised A by a 33:32, giving a major<br/>third and sixth almost 10 cents larger each than 9:7 and 12:7. This<br/>can be a neat variation, and the Sagittal system and microabc are<br/>flexible enough to let one express nuances like this.</p><p>Hudson, you&apos;ve lent immense support through this effort, and had an<br/>opportunity to get lots of evidence for a presentation showing that<br/>not everyone who uses Linux is an expert system administrator.</p><p>My special greeting to you, George, and thanks for the encouraging<br/>note. I know a bit about what you and Dave and others have been<br/>through to perfect the Sagittal system, and microabc was a neat<br/>incentive to make Sagittal my notation system of choice. Of course,<br/>your wonderful 17-tone well-temperament provided the occasion for a<br/>most precious opportunity for me to benefit from your mentorship --<br/>and above all from your humor, patience, and precious friendship.</p><p>Also, George, I&apos;m finding something with Sagittal that makes me also<br/>thank another friend, Shaahin Mohaajeri: the notation makes it<br/>possible to different signs all of which can represent the Persian<br/>type of interval known as a koron or sori (respectively about a<br/>thirdtone down or up), but also indicate in a system such as<br/>Peppermint the size of this interval (59, 70, or 80 cents). This can<br/>be helpful in distinguishing different types or shadings of neutral<br/>thirds or sixths, for example.</p><p>My best to all of you, and I hope that you enjoy this archive showing<br/>the joys of Sagittal and of its implementation in microabc.</p><p>Also, Jon, thank you for reminding me of the anniversary!</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
