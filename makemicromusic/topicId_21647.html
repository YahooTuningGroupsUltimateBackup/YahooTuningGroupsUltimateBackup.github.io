Is this your invention?<br/>I&apos;m wondering two things in particular. (1) Is there no simple way to do this already? It almost seems to me it would actually be simpler to code a middle-man app that takes JI ratios (maybe through OSC) as input and outputs such messages. I&apos;ve also kept Rationale pretty pure so far, in terms of JI. (2) If there isn&apos;t already a simple way to do this, how many people will want to use it? I&apos;m not above doing it based on one request, of course; it seems to make sense, and other people would probably try it.</p><p>People have requested MIDI output, though, and they didn&apos;t mention this method. If I set up something like this and it doesn&apos;t satisfy people, I still gotta go back and add something else.<br/>That said, it sounds like the calculations would be really simple. Funny thing about user interface programming, it would probably be simpler to compute those offsets automatically based on whichever ET is chosen than to let the user specify his own correlations. Rationale already has a ratio-bank dialog that has no upper prime limit, and the only restriction on ratios is whole numbers.</p><p>-Chuckk</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great news, Chuckk.

I think if you have fields for primes up to<br/>19 that should satisfy (I&apos;ll never go beyond 17).  Or you could have<br/>one of those + buttons to add fields one at a time for people who<br/>are into high-prime stuff.</p><p>&gt;The user adds a Lumma-style MIDI line to the output page, and<br/>&gt;selects a range of port/channel combinations, as well<br/>&gt;as some kind of base frequency/note number correlation. Next to that<br/>&gt;are the fields you mentioned, one for the ET and the others for primes<br/>&gt;up to 13 or so, with others that can be added and removed, and all of<br/>&gt;them populating with suggested vals based on the chosen ET.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s naturally up to the user to make sure the synths that take input<br/>&gt;from those port/channel combinations are set up in the right order. I<br/>&gt;think that&apos;ll require a separate Help menu item.</p><p>Sounds perfect.</p><p>Please keep in mind that pitch bends are just 196608-ET (according<br/>to Monzo) so they could use the same underlying interface.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
