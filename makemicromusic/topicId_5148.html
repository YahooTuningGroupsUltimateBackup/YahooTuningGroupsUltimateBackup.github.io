Thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards<br/>&gt; a.m.</p><p>I just was contacted by the developer of Vsampler(Maz) that the next<br/>version (3.1) will have Microtunability and SCALA compatibility.<br/>I had requested this feature months ago, and it seems that it will<br/>now become a reality!  He is currently asking which SCALA scales<br/>he should have as Default scales since he doesn&apos;t want over 3000<br/>default SCALA scales.<br/>So, please post your recommendations here and at <a href="http://www.vsampler.com">www.vsampler.com</a> !!</p></div>
