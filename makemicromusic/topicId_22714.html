It&apos;s good to hear from you. :-)</p><p>Of course you may compose something for the next album.<br/>Currently there are no plans for another album. But I will probably begin planning the next album in a few months.<br/>So there&apos;s no deadline yet. When I have some news, I will alert the MakeMicroMusic group and the tuning list.<br/>The conditions for the last album were: the music should be in any style of popular music. And the music should definitely be microtonal.</p><p>Thanks Shaahin, all the best,</p><p>Sean</p><p>&gt; Dear sevish<br/>&gt; Hi<br/>&gt; Thank u for ur comment on my music uploaded in youtube.<br/>&gt; And what about me? May i compose something for the next album?<br/>&gt; And can u tell me more about its deadline and how to send it and other conditions related to music?<br/>&gt; Many thanks to u<br/>&gt; Shaahin</p></div>
