I must be behind the times, because it&apos;s &gt; lame imitations of acoustic instruments that put me off.  I&apos;d quite like &gt; more techno!  Perhaps they are putting more work into the add-on sounds.</p><p>I agree about the preset sounds, but my point was that out of the almost 1000 sound in the presets, there were maybe 10 that I even found acceptable, and those were sounds like &quot;fender/electric&quot; piano, or a traditional &quot;moog-like&quot; lead (which actually did sound a bit thin, or is that digital?). I guess I just don&apos;t know marketing, but those sounds just did not inspire me to  want to explore it further. The knobs were cool, thou!</p><p>Mike</p></div>
