I haven&apos;t been composing enough in non-twelve scales to really be seeing anything through untwelvish eyes.</p><p>That said, one of the interesting things about reaching beyond 12-TET recently has been the way it has broken some of the older ideas I had *about* 12-TET.</p><p>For instance, thinking about notes as more-or-less consonant ratios, and then trying to figure out how to command them inside a piece of music, leads to unusual sounds in 17-EDO, 19-EDO, and a whole bunch of other non-EDO scales. (I&apos;ve only played with about six scales, and most of what I&apos;ve produced isn&apos;t worth talking about.) Since I don&apos;t have untwelve instruments, and it&apos;s hard to find the time to actually compose on my laptop, my three main instruments are still guitar (which I was once okay at), mandolin (which I can really just play chords on), and piano (which I don&apos;t play so much as wander around on) -- all in 12-EDO, of course.</p><p>But if I stop thinking about 12-EDO as the standard Western scale, and instead think of it as a temperament of a bunch of more-or-less consonant notes, I stop worrying so much about things like major and minor. If my attitude isn&apos;t bluesy, a minor third is no more or less bluesy than a major third is, and I can use both of them in a melody, riff, or ornament while only worrying about the key so much as the character of the chords or intervals involved. The key I&apos;m in, my tonal center, derives at least as much from the octaves, fifths, and fourths I&apos;m using than from the thirds I&apos;m using. Heck, I don&apos;t even need thirds if I don&apos;t feel like it: There&apos;s a lot of tonal color in seconds, fourths, and sevenths. I find that as I goof off I can use a lot more notes than I previously had without making things sound harsh, ugly, or weird. They sounds I&apos;m making are more &quot;chromatic&quot; in the sense of having more color, but not in the sense of heavy, harsh, dark, or those other words that frequently get associated with chromaticism.</p><p>Additionally, I&apos;ve found ways to think about the whole-tone scale that I didn&apos;t consider before. I never really played with it before because I don&apos;t like its triads, and I don&apos;t particularly care for Debussy when he uses it, either. So to heck with triads! I&apos;m now noodling around in 6-EDO (it&apos;s easier to change my thinking if I don&apos;t call it the &quot;whole-tone scale&quot; -- words matter) in ways that aren&apos;t based on my usual ways of thinking. I&apos;ve actually found a few &quot;chord progressions&quot; (mostly dyads, really, using the major third) that are really interesting and, dare I say it, likable.</p><p>Naturally, I don&apos;t expect MMM to focus on 12-EDO or 6-EDO compositions; however, I like the idea that there are compositions that I would consider posting here because they could be microtonal in character without being inaccessible from traditional 12-EDO instruments.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 8:55:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake&gt;&quot;So to heck with triads!

I think that&apos;s pretty amazing. Similarly, I was playing around in<br/>the Locrian mode (white notes starting on B, so no perfect fifth and not<br/>very stable tonality), completely avoiding playing the C for several<br/>minutes (because that has the potential to knock the tonality back into<br/>C Major), and all of a sudden I used C -- and it sounded *weird*. I did<br/>the same thing and ended on a full C Major chord, and it sounded like<br/>aliens were landing on the planet. When you&apos;re playing all white keys<br/>and C Major sounds weird, that&apos;s pretty cool.</p><p> &gt; I think you&apos;re right though...6EDO really seems to force you to think<br/>microtonally...<br/> &gt; many if not most of the little musical &quot;crutches&quot; used in the<br/>diatonic scale are<br/> &gt; simply not there and replaced with more exotic options.</p><p>That&apos;s it.
