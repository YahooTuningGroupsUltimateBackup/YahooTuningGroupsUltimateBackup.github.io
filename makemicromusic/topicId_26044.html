Why would anyone call drum and bass tracks<br/>&quot;quartets&quot;?&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; They wouldn&apos;t.&nbsp; Which is why it seems rather twisted that people seem to come at me angrily for not knowing certain specifics behind terms that have nothing to do with genre&apos;s I tend to focus on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Counter-example: As a musician interested in the rock genre, I wouldn&apos;t expect a classical musician to know the difference between a &quot;hammer on&quot; and &quot;tapping&quot; or even &quot;fast picking&quot; in rock.&nbsp; I also wouldn&apos;t come out angrily saying &quot;you ignorant...you don&apos;t know the difference?!&quot;<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Granted, I might say &quot;actually, just to note, there is a difference: tapping alternates higher and lower notes as a fast arpeggio without using the pick against the string while hammer-ons involve quickly hitting only increasing pitch notes without using the pick and fast-picking involves using the pick for several quickly played notes.&nbsp; All of them are fast, but they are not the same (acknowledging that there is a similarity that may have confused the person using the terms incorrectly despite his/her intteligent effort to use the term correctly)...</p><p>&gt;&quot; It&apos;s you who insists on using the term &quot;song&quot;<br/>Says who?&nbsp; I used it incorrectly ONCE....and once you sent me the links I GOT I PERFECTLY and NEVER USED SONG IN THAT CONTEXT AGAIN!!!</p><p>&gt;&quot;when speaking<br/>of pieces in genres where that word n e v e r means anything other than<br/>a short piece of music sung by a singer.&quot;&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, I&apos;m not frustrated with the definition (as said many times before I understand this...in fact, after you gave me links to the definition, I was the first on-list to say what the definition was, thus proving I did read and take seriously your links, you are STILL flaming up at me.&nbsp; So why on earth are you angry at me?&nbsp; I listened, I learned I followed through...</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;m a big fan of electronica, too.
