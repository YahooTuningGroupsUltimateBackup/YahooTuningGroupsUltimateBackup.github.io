They were not thinking<br/>microtonal necessarily (how much of a market is that?) but with the right<br/>software you can map it pretty much anyway you want.

Maybe that would give me just the flexibility I need. I don&apos;t understand MIDI or really much electronic music technology at all. I just use CSound and do everything with software. But with a USB connector, surely I can write a program somehow to read those MIDI signals and then create the pitches I want.</p><p>On sale, too?!</p></div>
