I don&apos;t have Reaktor), I<br/>should have noted the products in question. I was hoping to collect ideas in<br/>regard to the limited 12-note retuning capability in the Pro-52 and FM7 and<br/>possible future NI soft-synth/samplers (NI has one coming soon, Kontakt) that<br/>might have limited tuning capabilities. I would like to forward these ideas<br/>onto the synthesis director at NI who is implementing this functionality.</p><p>For the FM7, Pro-52 and future NI softsynths is a no-frills (IE non graphic<br/>display) text loading interface with 128-note<br/>retuning adequate (&quot;better&quot;) if a conversion utility supporting SCALA is<br/>available? I am interested in how composers on this list store their original<br/>tuning data. Is SCALA a standard? If stored in a tabular format a conversion<br/>utility could be made (by/for the individual; Perl to the rescue!) to transfer<br/>them to a format readable for import into future version of NI softsynths.<br/>Are there other ideas or concerns?</p><p>Here is a link to a SCALA conversion utility with 12-note limited coverage for<br/>the NI Pro-52 and a few other softsynths (some unlimited).<br/><a href="http://www.mendozadil.freeserve.co.uk/Scale.html">http://www.mendozadil.freeserve.co.uk/Scale.html</a><br/>This can be extended to covert the SCALA DB to the Reaktor event tables as you<br/>mentioned if someone sends the author of Scale Browser an example Reaktor<br/>tuning file. Likewise for Infinity or any other softsynth supporting tuning<br/>file import.</p><p>Best..<br/>--Mike</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@...</h3><span>2/1/2002 4:40:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Mike,</p><p>What&apos;s the format of this text file?

Something like<br/>the Korg OASIS format?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t exist yet. I would like to propose to NI a solution that will meet<br/>the needs of the working microtonal community. Right now from my brief<br/>communication with NI it seems that they have not heard enough &quot;use cases&quot; to<br/>determine a standard implementation across all NI products. The support between<br/>the Pro-52 microtonal features and the FM7 is very different; it shows that NI<br/>is trying a few ideas. Retuning in the FM7 is much &quot;easier&quot; to use from the<br/>standpoint of someone who is not familiar with scale construction or the theory<br/>of tuning (or lack of resources from a DB like SCALA). So, I see a definite<br/>trade off in usability over the issue of representing retuning in an &quot;elegant&quot;<br/>manner. What I would like to propose to NI is that an &quot;elegant&quot; solution for<br/>the majority of microtonal community (those that will most likely take<br/>advantage of retuning) is functionality over a nice visual display that would<br/>be difficult to implement for full 128-note retuning support and accurate<br/>microtonal scale representation. I might also note that the FM7 only allows 32<br/>scales to be stored at once. It is much more &quot;usable&quot; for scales to be loaded<br/>from file when thousands exist.</p><p>&gt;Rather than having a separate conversion utility for Scala scale files, I<br/>might add it to Scala itself. A direct conversion is not always a good idea,<br/>since then there is no way to have different mappings from note numbers to<br/>scale degrees.</p><p>This is good news!</p><p>What would the most appropriate mapping format be to support Scala? I assume<br/>that if 128-note retuning were supported you would indicate the midi note<br/>number as the key paired with a value.<br/>I must admit that I am still in my learning/exploring phase with microtonality,<br/>so I am not aware of the problem you are mentioning with scale degrees. Could<br/>you write more on this? If you had to implement text file import of retuning<br/>data into softsynths how would you do it, so that it keeps the most flexibility<br/>and integrity in regarding to supporting the microtonal/Scala side?</p><p>---</p><p>Other people that have contacted NI in regard to 128-note retuning include Jim<br/>Aikin (senior editor of Keyboard magazine). I held a brief email conversation<br/>with Aikin and he is sure keen on the issue. You might also want to check out<br/>his music technology page:<br/><a href="http://www.musicwords.net/musictech/musictechindex.htm">http://www.musicwords.net/musictech/musictechindex.htm</a><br/>Jim seems like a very good ally for microtonality. I don&apos;t know how much has<br/>been covered in Keyboard magazine as I never have been a reader, but perhaps<br/>someone from this list can approach him about writing an article (for the<br/>masses) to be included in Keyboard magazine?</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p></div><h3>X.

So you<br/>have to distribute 22 scale degrees over 24 keys. The choices<br/>you have, for example which key to start the scale on, are<br/>described in a keyboard mapping file.

For fixed tuning too, if they<br/>choose this I don&apos;t need to do anything since it&apos;s already<br/>supported by Scala (and instruments mainly of Emu and Ensoniq).</p><p>A text file like for the Korg OASIS is a possibility too, but<br/>soft synths should support a higher resolution than the one<br/>cent of Korg.

My brainstorm indicated that it should be proper to store individual and independent tuning files. It would be easy to integrate file loading using the MTS standard for the file content (they are already loading other sysex data for the programs in the FM7, etc.). Of course it would be great if the synths would support real time MTS sysex input that certainly should be lobbied for, but in the meantime a good middle ground is an implemented file loading procedure supporting MTS.</p><p>My question about a stand alone editor for MTS &quot;files&quot; is that once an MTS file exists it would be nice to have a graphical display where sections of the notes could be copy/pasted/edited/dragged/dropped around a virtual 128 note keyboard. Also this would allow visual creation of new scales or the facility to integrate two or more scales at once by dragging them to different regions. The creation of a cross platform tool like this would solve NIs doubts.
