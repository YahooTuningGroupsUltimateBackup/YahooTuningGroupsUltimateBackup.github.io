Turned out it is still valid<br/>until 30th Sept 01 :-).</p><p>So only thing to do is to get the ticket, don&apos;t know how far<br/>in advance one needs to do that. I tend to leave things late.<br/>I expect I&apos;ll go by boat - like the fresh sea air and being on<br/>board a boat. Esp. so since I have a kind of hay fever like<br/>reaction to cigarette smoke, which makes fresh air useful -<br/>that may be worth mentioning in case any of you smoke - it gives<br/>me a bad headache and I&apos;m not easily able to give full attention to<br/>discussion etc. after that.</p><p>Maybe an idea also to say in advance that I&apos;m not much inspired by the<br/>idea of a &quot;microtonal microsoft&quot;, being much more interested in<br/>idea of diversity of programs that all call each other, as FTS<br/>and SCALA call each other.</p><p>It would be nice to be able to call up JM from FTS by passing a<br/>scale to it to show as a lattice, just as I can pass a scale<br/>to SCALA to show there and work with in SCALA.</p><p>Then it is up to the programmers of JM to make it a nice program<br/>that users will want to linger in and explore once they have looked<br/>at the lattice. I imagine it will be if it is anything like the<br/>C++ version. That was near first release stage when I tried it.</p><p>Hopefully you&apos;ll get a few FTS users sent your way, who download JM<br/>in order to enable the &quot;show lattice in JM&quot; button.</p><p>I like to keep things small and diverse, and like idea of<br/>lots of programs calling each other.</p><p>I think the web is much richer for its diversity, and one can think<br/>of programs as somewhat analagous to web pages. ONe comes across<br/>&quot;universal&quot; type web sites, and very useful they are too, but they<br/>are part of the diversity too!</p><p>If anyone else starts up a microtonal scales exploring<br/>fractal tune generating midi relaying FFT program like FTS - that&apos;s<br/>great too. ;-)</p><p>Not sure quite how much I&apos;ll have to contribute - if you recall<br/>I haven&apos;t been involved in JM discussions at all this year, though<br/>posted quite a few things last year.</p><p>Actually, my JM membership needs to be renewed as the old yahoo<br/>id doesn&apos;t work any more.</p><p>It&apos;s the result of experiments with Archiving program new repost<br/>option triggering an auto-response cut off at Yahoo that I didn&apos;t<br/>know about - protects them from the &quot;I am on vacation&quot; type auto response<br/>messages that can completely make a newsgroup unusable if<br/>relayed round and round in repeating loop. Partly my doing<br/>as I think a second e-mail to yahoo about it would be in order<br/>to tell them that they haven&apos;t yet got me back online<br/>for that address. However, I&apos;m happy enough with present<br/>system and have already transferred nearly all my old<br/>yahoo groups to the new id, I think JM would complete<br/>the list, apart from maybe some yahoo groups done as experiments<br/>that I can&apos;t delete and will just sit there until I do<br/>something about it.</p><p>Anyway will be great to meet up with everyone, and sometimes<br/>the things that one least expects are the ones that are most<br/>valuable.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=379 href="#379">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 3:36:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>&gt; I was going to respond to you privately, but I suppose<br/>&gt; that you sent it to the list so that others might join<br/>&gt; in on our get-together if they&apos;re interested, and that&apos;s<br/>&gt; certainly OK with me!  (Also, there&apos;s info here that others<br/>&gt; might find profitable.)</p><p>Well, not really anything in mind at all, just following<br/>your lead in posting to the list, but you&apos;ve come up with<br/>a good reason for it :-)</p><p>&gt; Graham Breed has already told me that he has an aversion to<br/>&gt; flying, mainly because of his environmental stance regarding<br/>&gt; jet-fuel pollution.  (And I agree with him, but I&apos;m being<br/>&gt; forced, by time and financial reasons, to be a hypocrite.)<br/>&gt; Perhaps the two of you might want to coordinate your travel<br/>&gt; plans from UK to Netherlands.</p><p>Apparently it is v. easy to go from London to Amsterdam;<br/>you just get a return coach to Amsterdam, and everything is<br/>done for you, no connections or anything. The coach goes<br/>on the ferry. Takes about 12 hours; a lot less than it takes me to<br/>get to my relatives in the Scottish islands. Could be nice if<br/>we were on the same ferry. You don&apos;t even need to book long<br/>in advance, though one may need to book. (Unless it is<br/>a shuttle type service where you buy your ticket on the coach,<br/>which I have to check up on).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you do decide to fly, you won&apos;t beat the fares from Ryanair<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.ryanair.com">www.ryanair.com</a>&gt;.  They fly from UK to Brussels at incredibly<br/>&gt; low rates.  I&apos;ll be using Brussels as my gateway to Italy, and<br/>&gt; so will have to do some ground transportation between Brussels,<br/>&gt; Amsterdam, and Paris.  I expect to be arriving back in Brussels<br/>&gt; from Italy on September 17, and have to be back in Paris on the<br/>&gt; 21st.  So that gives us roughly 3 days together in the Netherlands.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I saw your e-mail, and seems it might almost be cheaper by<br/>air than by sea. However I like the sea, so will surely go that way<br/>even if a bit slower. No particular aversion to flying, in fact<br/>my grandfather on my mothers side was a pilot for some of his life,<br/>and though I was too young to remember him, I do have a kind of liking<br/>of the idea of learning to fly an airplane some time maybe, especially<br/>a small one (or one of the old biplanes :-) Apparently there is a flying<br/>school in Cambridge that still uses one of those), or a glider, even if I have<br/>never done it. Nearest I&apos;ve got is playing about with flight simulator on<br/>p.c. (Was supposed to be a battle, but I&apos;d just go up in the air and fly<br/>around the island and practice landings, and keep away from any action,<br/>being pacifist by inclination / temperament).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Maybe an idea also to say in advance that I&apos;m not much inspired<br/>&gt; &gt; by the idea of a &quot;microtonal microsoft&quot;, being much more interested<br/>&gt; &gt; in idea of diversity of programs that all call each other, as FTS<br/>&gt; &gt; and SCALA call each other.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would be nice to be able to call up JM from FTS by passing a<br/>&gt; &gt; scale to it to show as a lattice, just as I can pass a scale<br/>&gt; &gt; to SCALA to show there and work with in SCALA.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then it is up to the programmers of JM to make it a nice program<br/>&gt; &gt; that users will want to linger in and explore once they have looked<br/>&gt; &gt; at the lattice.

The programs that you, Graham, and<br/>&gt; Manuel have already released can already do *so* much that I wanted<br/>&gt; JustMusic to do, that this approach really makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Glad there&apos;s convergence of ideas going on. Basic midi relaying is pretty<br/>easy to add if you want to add it to JM at some point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway will be great to meet up with everyone, and sometimes<br/>&gt; &gt; the things that one least expects are the ones that are most<br/>&gt; &gt; valuable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certain that this trip, particularly the Netherlands segment<br/>&gt; of it, is going to be one of the highpoints of my life.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Great!
