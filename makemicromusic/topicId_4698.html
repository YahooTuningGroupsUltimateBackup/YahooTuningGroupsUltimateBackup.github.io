Don&apos;t we use the scores &gt;as written originally? I thought their sharps and flats were just tuned &gt;differently not added on later.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ll give it a stab: didn&apos;t you want to hear stuff in 7ET, which we *usually* consider to mean dividing an octave into seven equal parts. If one does this, how would you propose to take music that has divided - and notated - music into 12 equal parts?</p><p>Some of what has been done in the last day or two is to move the sharps/flats in one direction or another by a half-step, clearing the sharp/flat. One is then left with a diatonic (&quot;white note&quot;) scale, and each of those 7 keys/notes will correspond to one of the 7 equal pitches in the octave.</p><p>That is what I *believe* Gene has done, with regard to midi files. A midi file, in it&apos;s most simple implementation, has assigned a number to each key, and records a note-on and a note-off. Therefore, it is remarkably like a piano roll (and that analogy has been used in some sequencers); of course, midi files can contain other information, including the amount of pitch bend applied to a given note, but that is not what is being discussed right now.</p><p>&gt;Are we engaged in a restoration process or a mastication process?</p><p>I have no idea. What would *you* call taking a file representing one tuning and altering it (in some form) to use another tuning?</p><p>&gt;There are enough amature musician already.  We should not  make apple &gt;sause out of<br/>&gt;classical music.</p><p>I&apos;m a professional musician; I quite often prefer to hang out with amateurs. I also happen to like applesauce! :)</p><p>I hope this has shed a little light, Jim. I still have the feeling that you&apos;ve dived in the deep end, and you might want to focus on one task or area at a time and find what works for you, be it doing some midi sequencing, or finding a way on a standard keyboard to play non-12tet tunings, or some similar scenario. Maybe if you could, as clearly and succinctly as possible, write out what you&apos;d *like* to do, we can find a clear and easy way to help you do that!</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4722 href="#4722">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2003 4:51:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I didn&apos;t start from a notated score, but a midi file.

No one has been claiming the above.</p><p>Well, sorry. I&apos;ve tried to follow the thread which - I thought - began with tuning midi files, after throwing out sharps and flats, to 7eq. Mix in the fact that the subject this has continued under as &quot;Improvisation in seven equal&quot; and I apparently have gotten completely off on the wrong understanding. I hope you can appreciate my (sincere) confusion.</p><p>I&apos;ll bow out, as I&apos;m just adding noise to the signal.</p><p>&gt;Consider meantone to be a martini, with 12-equal being the gin and 7-equal &gt;being the vermouth.</p><p>For tonight, I&apos;m just going to consider the martini, have one, and call it a day!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.

I  too like armature musicians and<br/>hope to qualify for the honor of being one.  My meaning was rather<br/>different.  I didn&apos;t want to demote Bach et all to a lower level of<br/>perfection.  I still don&apos;t understand the propriety of<br/>algorithmically transforming their works.  I gather you have<br/>reservations also.  My question is how did all those sharps and flats<br/>get there if not by the composer?  I don&apos;t want to be like the boy-<br/>scout who helped an old lady across the street, only to find out she<br/>didn&apos;t want to go.</p><p>I am as curious as the next person and took my turn at making &quot;apple<br/>sauce&quot; from Bach&apos;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, 3rd movement.  I down<br/>loaded a coda notation file from</p><p><a href="http://www.arts.arizona.edu/midi/openingscrmusfiles.html">http://www.arts.arizona.edu/midi/openingscrmusfiles.html</a></p><p>(using the search option I was able select from many works).  With<br/>Allegro 2001 I remove the sharps and flats.  I don&apos;t know how to<br/>automate the process yet.  At one point deleting an accidental caused<br/>a &quot;spelling&quot; error so be careful.  I retuned with Scala and uploaded<br/>the results to the E7 folder.  Yum.

Even if it is &quot;out of tune&quot; it is still a certain pitch or steop within that framework. After the traditional regimen of music theory and ear training that one gets in most batchlor programs, and years of taking off tunes for this gig and that gig, that&apos;s just the way my ears work. When listening to non 12TET, I almost experieince a vertigo like sensation trying to conceptualize what my ears hear into traditional pidgeon holes.</p><p>Does this explain how it works with me, currently? This is why I am forcing my ears to get more familar with non 12 TET systems. Fortunately, my ears are not exact perfect pitch,  which could drive someone nuts if something isn&apos;t pefectly in tune, my ears are able to adjust some to accommodate something that is recorded sharp or flat even though it is not exactly referenced to A=440, but still the ears are in analysis mode trying to analyse,catagorize the chord progressions melody and bass lines.</p><p>I didn&apos;t intend to imply that relative pitch and 12TET are necessarily closely related, necessarily, but in my case, when music is played, my mind does these analysis things. It is to the point that I can only listen to music when concentrating on it specifically, otherwise I put talk radio on which can become blah, blah, blah when I need to concentrate on something else, but when listening to other than 12 TET, my ears are attempting to analyse it to the nearest semitone mentally.</p><p>Bonnie *:&gt;</p><p>Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>Bonnie wrote...</p><p>&gt; Having very good relative pitch, I&apos;m somewhat locked into 12TET</p><p>Just curious, why does having relative pitch lock you into 12TET?</p><p>      Rick</p><p>Yahoo!
