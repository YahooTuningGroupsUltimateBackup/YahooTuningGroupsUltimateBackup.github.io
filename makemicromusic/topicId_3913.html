So what&apos;s new:  a trio for violin,<br/>guitar and viola using the Sims accidentals and 72-tET.  An organ<br/>piece which is in 1/11th comma meantone :), a piece for electric<br/>guitar and cello, uses some nice glissandos, :) and working on a<br/>piece for flute and guitar.  Lots of guitar stuff these days.</p><p>All these pieces are in Sibelius and are still awaiting their<br/>premieres, so I haven&apos;t posted them as yet as mp3s or such like.  A<br/>couple are in .wav format where the recipient didn&apos;t have Sibelius<br/>and I had to cut a CD.

I can only speak for myself, but seeing as I started the list one would wonder why I&apos;ve been so seemingly non-productive.</p><p>I can assure you that once I can find the spare time, I *will* be making more music. I was walking to work with a colleague, with whom I&apos;ve had many recording ventures over the years. He asked what I had written lately, and I told him nothing, but that the gear and ideas are at the ready, simply waiting for the time to do it.</p><p>This *is* my busiest time of the year, as my symphony schedule was at it&apos;s most gruelling in the fall, lots of big pieces and conductors vieing for a music director position. And just this week I&apos;ve slid over to the Old Globe Theatre to start the run of a holiday musical that last until Dec. 31 with 10 performances a week.</p><p>Add family matters and the time - at the present - don&apos;t allow for the solitary (and, for me, semi-selfish) pleasure of composition and recording.</p><p>Besides, the music is in my head and heart. I&apos;m not worried about losing it... the music that is.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
