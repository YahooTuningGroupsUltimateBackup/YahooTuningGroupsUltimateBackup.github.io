So what&apos;s new:  a trio for violin,<br/>guitar and viola using the Sims accidentals and 72-tET.  An organ<br/>piece which is in 1/11th comma meantone :), a piece for electric<br/>guitar and cello, uses some nice glissandos, :) and working on a<br/>piece for flute and guitar.  Lots of guitar stuff these days.</p><p>All these pieces are in Sibelius and are still awaiting their<br/>premieres, so I haven&apos;t posted them as yet as mp3s or such like.  A<br/>couple are in .wav format where the recipient didn&apos;t have Sibelius<br/>and I had to cut a CD.  And a couple aren&apos;t really microtonal by the<br/>strictly heald definition of this list.</p><p>That&apos;s the scoop, poops.</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2002 3:32:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff,</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;X.

I was walking to work with a colleague, with whom I&apos;ve had many recording ventures over the years.

And just this week I&apos;ve slid over to the Old Globe Theatre to start the run of a holiday musical that last until Dec. 31 with 10 performances a week.</p><p>Add family matters and the time - at the present - don&apos;t allow for the solitary (and, for me, semi-selfish) pleasure of composition and recording.</p><p>Besides, the music is in my head and heart. I&apos;m not worried about losing it... the music that is.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
