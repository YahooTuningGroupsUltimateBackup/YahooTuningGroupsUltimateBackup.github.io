This is not a negative comment, but one thing I have noticed and have always wanted more of from your tracks is a larger impact (compressed/processed, up &quot;louder&quot; in the mix) with the rhythm. Say to match the level of the synth that comes in at 2:05 and elsewhere. Are you using the Twine (IDM) Acid sample CD or processing the loops yourself? Very cool though! Certainly what you are creating merits a trip to a larger studio to process your audio as you have things together on the creative end. Running your drum tracks through an Empirical Labs Distressor (<a href="http://www.empiricallabs.com/distress.htm">http://www.empiricallabs.com/distress.htm</a>) would beef them up for sure. That unit is certainly on my medium range list of stuff to get.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you are saving all of your multitrack projects!</p><p>At 03:33 PM 2/27/2002 +0000, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Mike of &quot;Catharsis,&quot; a participant on this list, processed my stuff<br/>&gt;and it is, indeed, amazing:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/jpehrson/">http://catharsis.egregious.net/jpehrson/</a></p><p>Thanks for the compliment. It took me about an hour to get everything set (and 10 minutes for the &quot;creative&quot; version; 7 of those bouncing the file... ;)  ). If there was more material to process that was recorded in the same way it would take progressively less time to process the tracks.</p><p>&gt;I can&apos;t believe it.  This guy has a *lot* of gear.</p><p>I used just the Waves plugins and a little &quot;trickery&quot; (but I described most of it in previous emails)... ;)</p><p>&gt;Frankly, I prefer the &quot;straight&quot; version to the Catharsis &quot;creative&quot;<br/>&gt;one, but only because it adheres more to the piece.</p><p>Err. Yes.. I just added ambience by two different delays a little wider in the stereo field.</p><p>&gt;So, I told Mike, he&apos;s the man:  he can do my sound editing whenever<br/>&gt;he wants to!</p><p>I would be glad to do anyones given the time as it gives me practice and a chance at a little creativity once in a while with my current uni schedule.</p><p>When I create I like to hole myself up for at least 3-4 days to a week and work on nothing else but the creative task at hand. Currently I have been unable to do this, but can always fit in time to &quot;master&quot; and work with basic ideas, but not to completion... ;.(   I hate to not complete something immediately otherwise by the time I take breaks and come back to it multiple times I will have learned something new that will make me view it in a different way (at least so far this has been the case). Un/fortunately: the horizon is only exponential from here! Time for a change in aesthetics!</p><p>&gt;****That makes sense, and maybe I need to manipulate the reverb<br/>more. What I was getting that I didn&apos;t like was a *very* synthetic-<br/>sounding &quot;ring, ring, ring, ring&quot; on the solo drum section. I mean,<br/>I was willing to *live* with it, but Catharsis (Mike) managed to make<br/>the reverb sound *much* better in these sections.</p><p>Yes, since I was working with the complete track and had to add reverb I noticed the same thing even with the minimal amount that I added. What I did was set up the reverb as an aux send. The reverb was set to full 100% and I automated it in the mix. When the drum part is soloed I pulled back the reverb, but brought it back in when the synths appeared again. The synths masked the &quot;ring&quot; of the lower drum part (also see reverb EQ). What I was not too happy about was catching the &quot;clicky&quot; rhythm with the reverb (best heard at 4:45). Not much you could do here without having separated audio tracks.</p><p>Cool thing with the Waves reverb is that you are given an EQ built into it and can target specifically the higher frequencies (which is usually what I do) instead of the whole range. Reverb below 500hz is not usually pleasant or wanted (muddy range). You still catch the higher partials/frequencies of the bass drum, but not the whole thing. I also ducked out a little part with an EQ around 300-500hz to tame the organ sound and to make the fast attack components sit a little more over it.</p><p>I also want to comment on the quality of the 128 encoded new MP3; it sounds bad. You can hear artifacts all over the place with the fast attack components of the track. Especially with the &quot;clicky&quot; rhythm at 4:45. That is why I included the 320 encoded version which really improves things, but there is still some silliness at the 4:45 part that does not occur with the 77 meg version here. Also since the original source was your 128 encoded MP3 a lot was already lost to begin with... Can&apos;t wait for future projects to roll forth from the list...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2002 12:05:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Catharsis &lt;catharsis@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2387">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2387</a></p><p>Can&apos;t wait for future projects<br/>&gt; to roll forth from the list...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; --Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Mike!</p><p>Thanks so very much again!  John Starrett is accepting the &quot;revised&quot;<br/>version, so we&apos;ll have something nice up at Tuning Punks.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind, I would like to collaborate with you on *all* my<br/>electronic efforts in the future.  That way, I can concentrate on the<br/>*composing* end of things...  I really hope you&apos;ll have time to do<br/>more.</p><p>I can&apos;t believe this all happened from the MakeMicroMusic list.</p><p>Jon Szanto, you&apos;d better put this in your Press Release and<br/>promotional materials for this list.... :)</p><p>jp</p></div>
