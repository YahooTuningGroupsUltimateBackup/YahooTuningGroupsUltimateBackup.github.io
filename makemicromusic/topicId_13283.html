Actually, I like 193.5 cents<br/>&gt; better melodically in the diatonic scale (both major and minor),<br/>&gt; but harmonically it&apos;s a huge difference.</p><p>Hi, there, Kraig and Carl, and to keep the spotlight of the<br/>&apos;Clash by Night&apos; thread on Aaron&apos;s music, I&apos;ve decided to take<br/>these asides as an excuse for a new thread in which I might<br/>mention one solution to the &quot;9:8 vs. meantone&quot; dilemma: unequal<br/>temperament, as illustrated by this piece.</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This is actually in a modified meantone which has become one<br/>of my favorite temperaments. First let&apos;s look at the specific<br/>modality of this piece, Bb Dorian, with the minor sixth Gb<br/>above the final sometimes used as an inflection (especially in<br/>descending) like Bb in untransposed D Dorian. Here I&apos;ll use<br/>rounded cents:</p><p>                        779<br/>                        Gb<br/>Bb    C   Db    Eb    F    G  Ab    Bb<br/>0    204  274   492  708  900 983  1200<br/>  204   71   217   217  192  83  217</p><p>Note that there are three kinds of whole tones. The 217-cent<br/>step often featured here is close to half of a 9:7 major<br/>third, as can be seen at Db-Eb-F, where a 434-cent third is<br/>built from two such steps.</p><p>The regular 192-cent tone of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma temperament occurs<br/>at F-G, and is close to half of 5:4; in nearer transpositions,<br/>this is, of course, the usual tone, two of them forming Zarlino&apos;s<br/>meantone major third at 383 cents.</p><p>However, there&apos;s also another variety of whole tone, around 204<br/>cents, and almost identical to a just 9:8 -- occurring at two<br/>locations, Bb-C and Gb-Ab.</p><p>The Bb-C interval plays a very important role in this piece as<br/>the second or ninth above the final, one I use a lot in this<br/>kind of style given my love for 6:8:9 or 4:6:9 as a vertical<br/>sonority.</p><p>Note that this modality also features the best septimal<br/>approximations of the temperament, a feature it has in common<br/>with both 22-EDO and 31-EDO, although not quite as accurate as<br/>the former and rather less accurate than the latter.</p><p>The basic idea is to tune eight fifths, F-C#, as in Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma (about 6.145 cents narrow), and the others equally<br/>wide (about 6.424 cents larger than pure), thus &quot;balancing out&quot;<br/>the circle, and getting a 12-note circulating system which<br/>supports a meantone style in the nearer modalities and a<br/>Pythagorean-to-septimal style in more remote modalities.</p><p>In a sonority like Bb-F-C, what happens is that the differences<br/>from 3:2 of Bb-F (about 6 cents wide) and F-C (about 6 cents<br/>narrow) &quot;cancel out,&quot; making Bb-C almost identical to a just 9:4.<br/>I put &quot;cancel out&quot; in quotes, because the fifths themselves<br/>remain decidedly impure, of course.</p><p>While the above piece illustrates a Pythagorean-to-septimal<br/>color, here&apos;s a piece mainly focusing on the nearer meantone<br/>part of the circle:</p><p>   &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>By the way, although the idea of eight fifths in Zarlino&apos;s<br/>temperament and the rest equally wide was my theoretical<br/>model for this tuning, what happens on a synthesizer in<br/>1024-EDO very closely approximates a slightly different<br/>and more complex model based on fractions of a Pythagorean<br/>comma.</p><p>In 1024-EDO, a step is almost exactly 1/20 of a Pythagorean<br/>comma. Here is my actual synthesizer tuning, with the<br/>tempering of the fifths shown both in 1024-EDO steps and in<br/>fractions of a Pythagorean comma (with negative numbers<br/>showing narrow fifths, and positive numbers showing wide ones):</p><p>   +6     +5    -5    -5   -6    -5   -5    -5   -6    -5   +5   +6<br/>Eb     Bb    F     C     G     D    A     E    B     F#   C#   G#   D#<br/>  +.30   .25  -.25  -.25  -.30  -.25 -.25  -.25 -.30  -.25 +.25 +.30</p><p>Anyway, in 1024-EDO the 9:8 approximations are virtually just, and<br/>they would be precisely just in the version based on fractions of<br/>a Pythagorean comma.</p><p>While sharing my enthusiasm for this 12-note temperament, I must<br/>also share two prudent cautions. First, while it&apos;s a fine 12-note<br/>circulating temperament for me, it might not be so compelling for<br/>others who want either meantone or septimal types of intervals in<br/>more locations, or who aren&apos;t as excited as I am about intervals<br/>such as major thirds at around 421 cents (actually 421.875 cents<br/>in the 1024-EDO version), prominently featured in my first piece<br/>in one standard cadence to Bb where a major third contracts to a<br/>unison:</p><p>     C    Bb<br/>     Ab   Bb</p><p>From my stylistic viewpoint, Ab-C at 421 or 422 cents makes a great<br/>&quot;usual&quot; major third in this kind of modality, and also a great meantone<br/>diminished fourth (spelled G#-C) in a 16th-century style. However,<br/>someone looking for major/minor keys rather than modalities might<br/>find this third size not exactly what they intended.</p><p>A second caution is simply to note what&apos;s not included, especially<br/>neutral steps and intervals, as well as steps smaller than 70 cents.<br/>However, arranged, 12 circulating notes can only do so much, and<br/>Aaron&apos;s music has lots of good reasons why often &quot;12 is not enough.&quot;</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=13285 href="#13285">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2006 7:42:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Quite compelling little gem here with some quite nice tonal shifts of focus on different tonal areas.

Annika is quite an inspiration, isn&apos;t she -- as well as a budding<br/>musician of distinction, we might suspect.</p><p>&gt; I would love to hear what you would do with this style and some<br/>&gt; percussion underneath!</p><p>That&apos;s a very creative question. For example, in 14th-century Europe,<br/>there was evidently a tradition of pieces called _Istampitas_ which<br/>could be taken as a form of dance music evolving toward a more<br/>&quot;abstract&quot; or meditative nature, with things such as accidental shifts<br/>that might suggest Near Eastern influences -- and different groups<br/>have handled the percussion in different ways. Studying some of those<br/>recordings -- or more recent ones on CD -- might give some ideas.</p><p>Carl:</p><p>&gt; The synth actually seems to bend down at the end, as if you<br/>&gt; let go of a real bellows.  Does it use a physical model?</p><p>Having now learned through Google what a &quot;physical model&quot; is, I can<br/>answer that this is something different -- FM synthesis (Yamaha<br/>TX-802). Since the envelope pattern for the instrument I used here is<br/>defined in a preset voice (A17, &quot;EleCello A&quot;), your comment reinforces<br/>my own impression that John Chowning or whoever programmed this did<br/>very nicely! I really like this timbre, to which I made only a few<br/>small modifications to get more pitch stability (or less randomness).</p><p>&gt;&gt; The basic idea is to tune eight fifths, F-C#, as in Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; 2/7-comma (about 6.145 cents narrow), and the others equally<br/>&gt;&gt; wide (about 6.424 cents larger than pure),</p><p>&gt; Why is the second number .3 cents bigger?</p><p>To explain very quickly, in a 12-note tuning circle, the _average_<br/>size of the 12 fifths must be 700 cents, or 1/12 Pythagorean comma<br/>narrow, so that they add up to an even 8400 cents, or seven 2:1<br/>octaves. (This assumes a 2:1 octave, of course.)</p><p>The eight narrow meantone fifths taken from Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>temperament are each about 695.81 cents, or 4.19 cents smaller than<br/>the 700-cent average, so that each of the four remaining equally wide<br/>fifths must be larger than 700 cents by twice this amount, or 8.38<br/>cents -- 708.38 cents. Then everything balances out. As it happens,<br/>the wide fifths have a slightly greater impurity than the narrow ones,<br/>the difference of about 0.3 cents that you have noted.</p><p>If the eight meantone fifths were tempered by precisely 1/4<br/>Pythagorean comma, or about 5.87 cents, then the four wide fifths<br/>would be larger than 3:2 by this exact same amount. Here the small<br/>fifths at about 696.09 cents would be around 3.91 cents smaller than<br/>700 cents, and the wide ones at about 707.82 cents around 7.82 cents<br/>larger, again balancing out nicely. This is an interesting case of an<br/>unequal 12-note temperament where all 12 fifths are impure to an<br/>identical degree -- albeit in opposite directions!</p><p>This is only one road to &quot;why,&quot; maybe one of the shortest and simplest<br/>ones.</p><p>&gt; In my notes, I this as being in &quot;8/4 well temperament&quot;.  Is that<br/>&gt; what you call it?</p><p>For my purposes, that&apos;s a nice description -- but &quot;modified meantone&quot;<br/>might be better because the term &quot;well-temperament&quot; is often taken to<br/>imply a tuning that will support some acceptable form of major/minor<br/>tonality in any key, thus with major thirds not larger than around<br/>Pythagorean.</p><p>The term I use, and Aaron has quoted, is &quot;temperament extraordinaire,&quot;<br/>a play on the French _temperament ordinaire_, a 17th-18th century<br/>genre which typically does have some fifths wider than pure and major<br/>thirds larger than Pythagorean. Maybe the feature that makes this<br/>tuning based on Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma &quot;extraordinaire,&quot; rather than<br/>merely &quot;ordinaire,&quot; is the use of regular meantone major thirds a bit<br/>smaller than a pure 5:4, something I haven&apos;t seen documented for an<br/>historical European 12-note circulating temperament.</p><p>&gt; Something like this?</p><p>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter&apos;s &quot;8/4&quot; well temperament.<br/>&gt; 12<br/>&gt;!<br/>&gt;  70.67<br/>&gt; 191.62<br/>&gt; 287.43<br/>&gt; 383.24<br/>&gt; 504.19<br/>&gt; 574.86<br/>&gt; 695.81<br/>&gt; 779.05<br/>&gt; 887.43<br/>&gt; 995.81<br/>&gt; 1079.05<br/>&gt; 2</p><p>That&apos;s right, and my &quot;official&quot; version simply has more<br/>(in)significant decimal plaes &lt;grin&gt;.

Here the small<br/>&gt;fifths at about 696.09 cents would be around 3.91 cents smaller than<br/>&gt;700 cents, and the wide ones at about 707.82 cents around 7.82 cents<br/>&gt;larger, again balancing out nicely. This is an interesting case of an<br/>&gt;unequal 12-note temperament where all 12 fifths are impure to an<br/>&gt;identical degree -- albeit in opposite directions!</p><p>Something like this, I believe</p><p>!<br/> Margo Schulter&apos;s 1/4-Pythagorean-comma temperament extraordinaire.<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 72.63<br/> 192.18<br/> 276.54<br/> 384.36<br/> 492.18<br/> 576.54<br/> 696.09<br/> 768.72<br/> 888.27<br/> 984.36<br/> 1080.45<br/> 2<br/>!</p><p>It&apos;s a shame the approximate 9/7 doesn&apos;t occur in a mode with<br/>the good 7/4 in these tunings...  with a 7 present, I much less<br/>trouble using the 9/7.</p><p>&gt;The term I use, and Aaron has quoted, is &quot;temperament extraordinaire,&quot;<br/>&gt;a play on the French _temperament ordinaire_, a 17th-18th century<br/>&gt;genre which typically does have some fifths wider than pure and major<br/>&gt;thirds larger than Pythagorean. Maybe the feature that makes this<br/>&gt;tuning based on Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma &quot;extraordinaire,&quot; rather than<br/>&gt;merely &quot;ordinaire,&quot; is the use of regular meantone major thirds a bit<br/>&gt;smaller than a pure 5:4, something I haven&apos;t seen documented for an<br/>&gt;historical European 12-note circulating temperament.</p><p>I believe George Secor uses that term too.
