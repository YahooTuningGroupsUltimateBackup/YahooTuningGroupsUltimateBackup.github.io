I hope it still rocks if/when I&apos;m finished with it.</p><p>&gt; I still don&apos;t like the piano sound on Waterloo much, and I still think<br/>&gt; it&apos;s too fast, but it&apos;s still a fantastic piece.</p><p>I&apos;m torn on the piano sound. The Roland isn&apos;t as bright as I want,<br/>freepats is too bright. Also, freepats has no stereo separation, which<br/>I&apos;d much rather have. But I&apos;m planning on revising &quot;Waterloo&quot;, where the<br/>tempo changes a little so it won&apos;t sound so robotic. There are a few<br/>heavy parts that need to be a wee bit slower, as in half = 100 instead<br/>of 108.</p><p>I did try the software piano you recommended, Carl, and I liked it,<br/>except it doesn&apos;t play notes lower than A0. I&apos;m still looking for a<br/>cross between a Bosendorfer (range to C0 included) and a Yamaha (who<br/>owns Bosendorfer now, incidentally).</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3><a id=20250 href="#20250">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2008 7:36:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 2008-12-18 at 18:19 -0500, Chris Vaisvil wrote:<br/>&gt; This is quite good.
