This is what is used on the piano and can withstand quite a bit of tension. i am surprised to hear about the bronze as i know on my hammer dulcimer, these are always the first strings to break. it does have a richer tone than the aforementioned stainless steel which might make it speak the harmonics easier. I can only guess but good to know. Hope you have better luck recording it next time and have you tried having the water activate the string?</p><p>Benjamin Shirley-Quirk wrote:</p><p>&gt;Jon, Everyone else,<br/>&gt;      I was excited to see Ellen Fullman will be performing in April; I &gt;may just be in the area at that time; i hope i&apos;ll find a way finally to &gt;see her perform.
