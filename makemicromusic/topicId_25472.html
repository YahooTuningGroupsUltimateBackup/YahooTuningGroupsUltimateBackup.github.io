I<br/>don&apos;t love working out the actual math problems, though, and am<br/>perfectly happy to have someone else do that. In other words, I like<br/>understanding equations more than working them.</p><p>I&apos;m not a musician. I played some classical guitar when I was a teen,<br/>but now I just play chords to Irish drinking songs for my kids. I<br/>learned some music theory in high school (traditional harmony and Bach<br/>chorale kinds of things) and stuck with composition enough to create<br/>some little ditties. You can see the vast majority of my meager output<br/>here: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/music.html">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/music.html</a></p><p>My tastes are considered eclectic, but they&apos;re probably less so than<br/>many on this list: Rush, Peter Gabriel, and Ultravox in popular music;<br/>Romantic and Modern classical music, including Mahler, Ives,<br/>Stravinsky, and (sometimes) Schoenberg; bebop; old blues; and even<br/>country that&apos;s not too pop-inflected. I can only rarely tolerate Top<br/>40.</p><p>I&apos;ve understood basic concepts of harmonics for a long time, but only<br/>recently did I realize that there&apos;s a discrepancy between 12-EDO and<br/>perfectly just tuning. Learning this led me to the Tuning list, the<br/>Xenharmonic wiki, and a ton of other resources that I&apos;m barely<br/>starting to grasp. Although I&apos;m better educated about music than many<br/>non-musicians, and although I&apos;m reading and listening a lot these<br/>days, I&apos;m a complete novice at this stuff.</p><p>It was in this context that I received John O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s _The<br/>Mathematics of Music_.</p><p>==========</p><p>What it is<br/>----------<br/>A story of John O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s quest to create a better scale than the<br/>12-equal-division-of-the-octave (12-EDO) scale that is the mainstay of<br/>modern Western music.</p><p>Who would like it<br/>-----------------<br/>* Tinkerers, who would try out his methods<br/>* Composers who want to see what his goals were, whether his scales<br/>met those goals, and whether those goals turn out to be useful in<br/>real-world composition<br/>* Mathematically inclined non-composers ONLY IF they want to hear a<br/>story about developing a scale.</p><p>Length<br/>------<br/>71 pages + front matter &amp; back matter</p><p>Availability<br/>------------<br/><a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Music-Temperament-Explained-Alternative/dp/0956649203">http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Music-Temperament-Explained-Alternative/dp/0956649203</a></p><p>John&apos;s Website<br/>--------------<br/><a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">http://www.johnsmusic7.com</a></p><p>==========</p><p>Let me start by saying that reading John&apos;s book has made me respect<br/>him a great deal. His book details his efforts to improve on the<br/>12-EDO scale, which has reigned for several hundred years as the basis<br/>of most Western music, and he makes his goals, methods, and results<br/>admirably clear. I will use the word &quot;amateur&quot; quite a bit in this<br/>review, but that&apos;s not a pejorative -- it was an amateur who proved<br/>the &quot;professionals&quot; wrong and proved that the Troy of the Iliad<br/>actually existed, after all.</p><p>I should say up front, though, that this isn&apos;t anything like a text<br/>book. It&apos;s the story of a dedicated amateur&apos;s quest to create better<br/>scales. (The scales that result are called &quot;Blue Just&quot; and &quot;Blue<br/>Temperament&quot;.) Tinkerers will like it and will want to try out his<br/>processes for themselves. Composers may want to see what his goals<br/>were, and to try out his scales to see if he met them and if his goals<br/>match their compositional goals. Mathematically inclined non-composers<br/>who just want to know how music is structured will only like it if<br/>they&apos;re interested in how he gets to his scales. (That describes me,<br/>and I liked the book.)</p><p>As I understand it, people historically developed scales<br/>experimentally, almost viscerally. They stretched wires or blew<br/>through tubes or banged on surfaces, and tuned them by tightening or<br/>cutting or boring or otherwise physically manipulating their systems.<br/>They relied only on their ears -- what else was there? -- to make<br/>these materials resonate in ways that seemed more-or-less harmonious,<br/>and over time developed an understanding of some of the mathematical<br/>relations in the scale. The 9/8 step didn&apos;t come from abstract math;<br/>it&apos;s the gap that naturally comes from tuning fifths up from a unison<br/>and down from an octave.</p><p>John&apos;s book feels similarly experimental and visceral, but comes at<br/>things from the opposite direction. He pushes around frequencies and<br/>oscillations instead of wires and tubes. He starts with ratios and<br/>ends with frets and guitar strings.</p><p>To his credit, John shows that he&apos;s making educated guesses. He<br/>describes the guesses he made, prior guesses that he discarded, and<br/>where he thinks refinements are probably necessary.</p><p>Because he&apos;s telling you the story of his quest, he sometimes gives<br/>details that seem out of place. For instance, early on he says, &quot;For<br/>years I wrote musical ratios in the form x/y where x was less than or<br/>equal to y (e.g., 2/3). This goes against the norm and musical ratios,<br/>also called intervals, are usually written with x equal to or greater<br/>than y (e.g., 3/2). I have since adopted this approach.&quot; I really<br/>didn&apos;t need to know that: More important to me is the convention that<br/>most people use.</p><p>As an amateur, he tells us what he&apos;s interested in rather than<br/>surveying the scope of relevant literature. He doesn&apos;t discuss MOSs,<br/>non-12 equal temperaments (though he mentions them once), dwarves or<br/>hobbits or kleismic scales, the creation of scales by stacking ratios<br/>(a la La Monte Young&apos;s _Well-Tuned Piano_), or many other things that<br/>xenharmonicists seem to talk about. He doesn&apos;t discuss the difference<br/>between regular temperaments and others. He never mentions the word<br/>&quot;comma&quot;. He also limits himself to 12-note scales. There&apos;s nothing<br/>wrong with any of this -- he gives his reasons for limiting himself to<br/>12-note scales, for instance -- but as someone who was starting to<br/>look at lots of microtonal information, I know that there&apos;s a lot more<br/>to scale development than what he covered.</p><p>His writing style is pretty straightforward. For instance, on the<br/>bottom of page one he says, &quot;For example the 4/5 interval is 13.7<br/>cents out of tune.&quot; I already knew what cents were, but I thought that<br/>someone who didn&apos;t know might be confused; however, at the top of page<br/>two he says, &quot;A cent is one hundredth of a standard semitone [etc.]&quot;.<br/>When you need information or definitions, he usually has it just in<br/>the nick of time.</p><p>What follows is a walk through the book. I won&apos;t try to touch on<br/>everything John does, but I&apos;ll hit the highlights roughly in the order<br/>you&apos;d see them if you read it.</p><p>In the introduction, John says he wants to &quot;develop a better tuning<br/>system&quot;, but doesn&apos;t explicitly say the ways in which it would be<br/>better. For people who know something about tuning, it&apos;s clear that<br/>he&apos;s looking for a Just Intonation system; people who don&apos;t know what<br/>that means would be unlikely to know that JI is only one type of<br/>tuning system, with its own pros and cons. By the time I hit the Blue<br/>Temperament chapter, I really came to think that that&apos;s the most<br/>important issue in the book. More on that later.</p><p>He also says, &quot;I suspect that if my system is correct, it will make<br/>redundant many of the rules of standard music theory.&quot; This was a<br/>warning flag, making me believe that John&apos;s view was too narrow.<br/>Regardless of the scales he produced, there would still need to be<br/>concepts of chord progressions, voice leading, and so on. He might<br/>replace or modify some rules of music theory, or provide a surer basis<br/>for them, but make them redundant? Not likely.</p><p>When he gives historical background he shows, I think, the narrowness<br/>of the amateur. I think it would have been useful to talk about how<br/>tuning systems evolved; with terms like &quot;Pythagorean&quot; being bandied<br/>about on the Web (though not in his book), it would be nice to know<br/>what Pythagoras had to do with anything. Also, this would be a good<br/>place to tip the hat to non-Western tunings; those tunings don&apos;t<br/>necessarily agree with his principles, and in some ways they compete<br/>with 12-EDO the same way Blue Just and Blue Temperament do. (John<br/>noted in a private email exchange that he&apos;s not specifically looking<br/>at Western music, but is just following the paths down which his math<br/>takes him.)</p><p>In the second chapter, he makes a few guesses at a mathematical<br/>formula for consonance and promises to get back to his reasons for the<br/>correct one (for interval x/y, where x and y are frequencies, he<br/>claims it&apos;s 1/x + 1/y), promising to tell us in chapter 5 why that<br/>seems to fit. He does: In essence, it&apos;s because it&apos;s simple and<br/>because it seems to work for melodic movement.</p><p>When discussing the harmonic series, he gives a straightforward<br/>description of a vibrating string, and then relates it to how<br/>different notes sound. As I said earlier, this is an empirical book;<br/>while I more-or-less trust John&apos;s ear (partly because I like the scale<br/>it produced), when he talks about &quot;resolution&quot; and &quot;similarity&quot; and<br/>&quot;sweetness&quot; I get the feeling that I&apos;d have to walk through all of the<br/>same experiments he did before I could understand what he meant. This<br/>is one of those points where I think this book is the perfect gift for<br/>a musical tinkerer. I also wonder if there isn&apos;t room for bias and<br/>cultural conditioning in his method: Mightn&apos;t people who are used to<br/>other scales find certain intervals to be sweet just because they are<br/>used to them?</p><p>He brings up &quot;periodicity&quot;, which he defines as finding &quot;repeat<br/>points&quot; where the all wave components have zero crossings at the same<br/>point. He doesn&apos;t say what a periodicity value should be, though, or<br/>what its importance is. It seems important, but remains mostly<br/>unexplained.</p><p>Also, he points out that he is using a &quot;Sine Lead voice&quot; on his<br/>synthesizer to do the testing, noting that using &quot;a voice with a full<br/>harmonic series&quot;, which I would call a more complex timbre, &quot;makes<br/>testing the notes harder.&quot; It seems to me that timbre is critical in<br/>understanding how things will sound together. For example, a perfect<br/>fifth sounds hollow on a classical guitar, but rich and full on a<br/>distorted electric guitar. For all that John is very pragmatic and<br/>empirical in his approach, if his method doesn&apos;t take into account<br/>different timbres then I wonder how practical the result will be. He<br/>does address it in Chapter 6, but in a way that I don&apos;t agree with:<br/>Timbres are different because they are composed of different<br/>overtones, but John just breaks the world into &quot;sine waves&quot; and<br/>&quot;complete harmonic series&quot;. But whether this matters is a question for<br/>composers and arrangers to deal with; I&apos;m struggling to make any music<br/>with any timbres, so for now I&apos;ll note the issue and leave it alone.</p><p>Sometimes, as John is casting about for the right equations, I feel<br/>like he goes down paths he doesn&apos;t need to go. I&apos;m most interested in<br/>the relationships between the notes: For instance, as consonance goes<br/>up, his formula for consonance should go up. I&apos;m less worried about<br/>what threshold it crosses as the formula reaches 1 -- there&apos;s enough<br/>guesswork going on that I&apos;ll assume that everything could be<br/>multiplied by a constant to get the &quot;right&quot; measure for a particular<br/>purpose.</p><p>One thing to note is that John describes &quot;Major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; as being<br/>related to the strengths (as calculated by his formulae) of various<br/>interval pairings instead of the character of the sound. I don&apos;t know<br/>whether these calculations relate to the character of the sound or<br/>not.</p><p>In chapter seven, John details his Blue Just Tuning. Everything else<br/>has essentially been groundwork leading up to this point. Based on all<br/>the math he has laid out before, he chooses the intervals that should<br/>sound sweetest.</p><p>It&apos;s important to realize that this is a somewhat circular<br/>mathematical description of what he hears: His math was made based on<br/>what his ear told him was &quot;sweetest&quot;, and now his math tells him which<br/>intervals should sound sweet.</p><p>His Blue Just tuning is a familiar set of intervals: 15/14, 9/8, 6/5,<br/>5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, and 2/1.</p><p>It&apos;s a pretty good scale. Since I&apos;m still trying to figure out how to<br/>control non-12-EDO scales, I won&apos;t offer any of my compositions on it,<br/>but Chris Vaisvil has composed a few items with it:<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=317">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=317</a><br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=376">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=376</a><br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=443">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=443</a></p><p>Now, from what I&apos;ve seen, you could probably give Chris a fish and a<br/>hand grenade and he&apos;d make them sound musical. But I don&apos;t think he&apos;s<br/>performing any special wizardry here; I think these clearly show that<br/>Blue Just is a viable tuning for mainstream compositions at least, and<br/>that it achieves John&apos;s goals of providing a sweet sound.</p><p>John briefly touches on the fact that this is a seven-limit tuning and<br/>explains what that means, but doesn&apos;t much go into why that&apos;s<br/>important, or if it has anything to do with the &quot;periodicity&quot; he had<br/>mentioned before.</p><p>Upon seeing the scale, I recalled his comment about making much<br/>traditional music theory redundant. I also recalled the fact that the<br/>traditional ii-V-I cadence that I learned in high school isn&apos;t nearly<br/>as simple as it looks, since it involves the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth (D-A) in<br/>early ill-tempered systems. Sure enough, in Blue Just tuning, the<br/>second scale degree has the following steps available for harmony:<br/>112, 182, 294, 379, 498, 610, 680, 814, 884, 996, 1116, 1200. The<br/>minor third there would be about 20 cents flat, and the 680-cent<br/>&quot;fifth&quot; would be really flat. (The V-I cadence would sound perfect, of<br/>course.) Thus this tuning has some of the same benefits and drawbacks<br/>of untempered systems or &quot;non-well&quot; temperaments.</p><p>The next chapter essentially shows how much he&apos;s willing to temper a<br/>note -- 256/255, or 6.775877 cents -- and shows us how he tempered the<br/>Blue Just tuning. The reason for the 256/255 ratio is apparently<br/>mystical, since he says, &quot;powers of 2 such as 64, 128, 256, etc. are<br/>magic numbers for me&quot;. (His programming experience probably affects<br/>his view of magic -- mine does for me. :) ) The 6.8-cent limit doesn&apos;t<br/>seem out of line, though, so I&apos;ll accept it. Microtonal composer Kyle<br/>Gann uses five cents, I think. John ultimately gives us a temperament<br/>that seems pretty good to my amateur eyes: In cents, Blue Temperament<br/>is 121.6, 200.7, 313.5, 388.4, 501.2, 580.4, 702.0, 816.9, 889.4,<br/>1012.5, 1085.1, and 1200.</p><p>Again, I&apos;ll lean on Chris Vaisvil to provide an example of the scale in use:<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=411">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=411</a></p><p>When John finishes this section, he says, &quot;Blue Temperament may or may<br/>not be the best possible 12 key _temperament_ but it&apos;s pretty good,<br/>viable, and to me is a clear improvement on 12 Tone Equal<br/>Temperament.&quot; And clearly, composers who are looking for a<br/>predominantly five-limit, 12-note scale could do much worse, IF<br/>they&apos;re willing to give up the simplicity of 12-EDO.</p><p>And it was in thinking about these ideas -- Blue Temperament being a<br/>&quot;clear improvement&quot; on 12-EDO, and the idea of people giving up 12-EDO<br/>-- that I came to believe &quot;Improvement in what sense?&quot; is the most<br/>important question of the entire endeavor.</p><p>It&apos;s important to remember that 12-EDO isn&apos;t exactly &quot;flawed&quot;. It&apos;s<br/>not like aliens came down to Earth and imposed it on us, and we have<br/>to liberate ourselves from the 12-EDO hegemons. It&apos;s something that<br/>evolved out of prior tunings and temperaments. And its flaws never<br/>stopped, say, Mahler&apos;s symphonies from being sublime and beautiful.<br/>For a new tuning to be &quot;better&quot; than 12-EDO -- in the sense that it&apos;s<br/>something people would want to tune pianos to, create clarinets for,<br/>play guitars with, and learn to control compositionally -- it would<br/>have to be &quot;better&quot; than meantone, Werckmeister, Prinz, and other<br/>temperaments that existed before the 12-EDO system was widely adopted.</p><p>Moreover, those who are most likely to adopt a new tuning systems are<br/>the same people who are more likely to seek out something different<br/>from their scales: more 7-limit, 11-limit, or 13-limit harmony;<br/>smaller steps between notes; non-octave scales; ethnic and unusual<br/>harmonies.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, there are things within Blue Temperament that<br/>could be spicy and unusual, too. For example, if you choose the mode<br/>starting on the third note of Blue Temperament, you have a pretty good<br/>approximation of 7/6, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3, and 13/7. But that<br/>wasn&apos;t how the scale was devised, and it seems likely that if I wanted<br/>13-limit harmony then I could choose other scales that would be<br/>better. In short, it seems unlikely that most non-microtonal composers<br/>will retune their pianos to Blue Temperament anytime soon.</p><p>Near the end of the book, revisiting some of the principles from prior<br/>chapters, John works out a variety of intervals that should make good<br/>chords. While I don&apos;t disagree with his method for figuring out<br/>chords, I don&apos;t understand his approach to chord *progressions*. He<br/>makes it look like two chords should progress effectively if his math<br/>works out, regardless of direction, but whenever I work out chord<br/>progressions the one that comes first makes a difference; e.g., C<br/>Major moving to E minor is a pretty weak progression, while E minor to<br/>C Major is pretty strong.</p><p>Some nitpicks:<br/>* I think it would be useful to call intervals by their traditional<br/>names -- just major third, just minor third, harmonic seventh,<br/>whatever. I&apos;m not yet at the point that I think in ratios, so &quot;just<br/>major third&quot; means a lot more to me than &quot;5/4&quot; or &quot;386 cents&quot;.</p><p>* Sometimes John chooses his examples a bit arbitrarily. One of his<br/>examples starts, &quot;A has a frequency of 110Hz.&quot; Well, yes, and because<br/>I know that the A below Middle C is 440 Hz, I know that he&apos;s talking<br/>about the A two octaves below middle C, but why did he pick that A?<br/>Also, because I know that the range of human hearing is about<br/>20-20,000 Hz, I know that when he says, &quot;if the frequencies of the<br/>chosen notes are, say, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22 and 24,&quot; he&apos;s<br/>talking about notes I mostly can&apos;t hear. The math would work just as<br/>cleanly if they were 1200, 1300, 1500, 1600, 1800, 1900, 2200, and<br/>2400 -- so why use such unrealistic frequencies at all?</p><p>* John has his quirks, and one of them is carrying things out to<br/>unnecessary levels of precision. If he thinks a difference of 6.775877<br/>cents is essentially unnoticeable, why would 0.075877 cents (the<br/>difference between 6.775877 cents and 6.7 cents) be noticeable? He<br/>could have rounded this number to 6.8 cents or 7 cents, or even<br/>truncated it to 6 cents, just as easily.</p><p>In short, I think it&apos;s a good book for people who are interested in<br/>developing scales, and perhaps for composers who are interested in<br/>getting a maximally sweet 12-note non-EDO scale. It is not suitable<br/>for people who are trying to dig into the widely varying opinions that<br/>involve MOS, different EDOs, commas, and so on.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,<br/>Jake Freivald</p></div>
