It&apos;s been a feature<br/>&gt;&gt; since Finale 97, I think.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Then again, maybe that&apos;s what Rick meant.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Possibly Finale still has better microtonal support than Sibelius ?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; - Joel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***I think that *is* possible, since I believe it was posted that<br/>&gt; microtonal accidentals or symbols can be *defined* in Finale with<br/>&gt; certain pitch bends.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This option is *not* available in Sibelius.  But, you can enter pitch<br/>&gt; bends in *manually* and some users have automated this process.<br/>&gt; There is a &quot;temperaments plug-in&quot; created by Pete Walton, that I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been &quot;messing around&quot; with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All this, though, involves *pitch bends* and I believe Rick was<br/>&gt; talking about using tuning tables within his synths and just driving<br/>&gt; them with 12-tET, not worrying about the exact notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That was what *I* read in it, anyway, but like many mortals, I could<br/>&gt; be wrong...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J. Pehrson<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hope this will be useful &amp; my apologies for the length if it&apos;s not. It&apos;s a McLaren post from 1995 that explains the depth of Finale&apos;s microtonal support (way beyond pitch-bends). Cheers, Joel</p><p>*** begin old but still useful McLaren post ***</p><p>Date: Mon, 23 Oct 95 7:53:24 PDT<br/>From: &quot;John H. Chalmers&quot;<br/>To: tuning</p><p>From: mclaren<br/>Subject: xenharmonic notation in Finale<br/>---<br/>The estimable Paul Rapoport has created a<br/>microtonal music font for use with Finale.<br/>This was a significant advance, hampered by<br/>Finale&apos;s generally 12-centric mode of operation.<br/>Well, times have changed.  The latest version<br/>of Finale--rev 3.5--just arrived, and it has<br/>features to delight the heart of the most<br/>hardened microtonalist.</p><p>Most notably, the NONSTANDARD KEY SIGNATURE<br/>DIALOGUE BOX now contains an enhanced KEY STEP<br/>MAP DIALOG BOX.  What, pray tell, does this signify?<br/>Buckle up, chromedomes--time for a trip into<br/>the bowel of Finale&apos;s infinite set of dialog boxes...<br/>First, click on the KEY SIGNATURE TOOL.  (It&apos;s easy<br/>to tell; this is the icon that looks like a rodent<br/>having sex with a VCR.  As opposed to the icon<br/>that looks like a cyclotron swallowing a squid--<br/>that&apos;s the Speedy Note Entry tool.)</p><p>When the Key Signature dialog box appears,<br/>choose NONSTANDARD from the dop-down menu.<br/>Click NEXT twice, then click the KeyMap icon.<br/>Okay.</p><p>Now you&apos;re into a dialog box which allows you to<br/>define a microtonal key signature.<br/>First, you need to decide whether you want what<br/>Finale mystifyingly calls a &quot;Linear Key Format&quot;<br/>or &quot;Nonlinear Key Signature.&quot;  At this point permit<br/>me to quote from the Finale Reference (Vol. 3,<br/>ver. 3.0, which also applies to Finale ver. 3.5):<br/>&quot;In this dialog box, you specify how many notes<br/>will constitute an &quot;octave&quot; (it&apos;s twelve notes in the<br/>traditional system).  You also sepcify how many of<br/>these are &quot;diatonic&quot; (seven in the traditional system),<br/>and where the &quot;chromatic&quot; steps occur in the scale. (In<br/>the traditional system, the chromatic steps occur between<br/>every pair of diatonic steps except steps 3 and 4 and steps<br/>7 and 8.</p><p>&quot;If you&apos;re creating a linear key format, note that your work<br/>in the Key Step Map dialog box must follow certain rules in<br/>order to meep the definition of a lienar key format.  The<br/>total diatonic steps, for example, must be an odd number.<br/>Furthermore, the bottom and top halves of the scale must<br/>contain the identical arrangement of diatonic and<br/>chromatic steps.  These principles ensure that there is a<br/>progression of keys, although it may not be a circle of fifths<br/>as there is in traditional key structures. (Finale will<br/>correctly interpret, transcribe, and play back music in<br/>a format that hasn&apos;t been constructed accordin go these<br/>rules.  Theformat, however, won&apos;t be technically and<br/>musically correct; you may get unexpected results when<br/>you transpose--or add chord symbols to--music in such a<br/>key system).</p><p>&quot;You may wonder what the relationship is between your MIDI<br/>keyboard and the unusual key maps you can construct in this<br/>dialog box.  The principle is simple: each key on your keyboard<br/>*always* corresponds to a note in your key map.  If you&apos;ve<br/>established a quarter-tone key system, for example, you&apos;d<br/>have to drastically alter your playing style in order to input<br/>a simple C scale, because Finale now thinks that the first<br/>four notes on your keyboard are C, C-quarter-sharp, C-sharp,<br/>and C-three-quarter-sharp.  You&apos;d have to play C, E and G#<br/>&quot;keys&quot; on your keyboard to *notate* the C, D and E on the<br/>screen.&quot;</p><p>Well, there it is, kiddies.  Just what we&apos;ve needed lo these<br/>many years.  With this upgrade, Finale appears to support<br/>most of what&apos;s required for notating rationally a wild<br/>microtonal piece performed on the MIDI keyboard.<br/>The dialog box labelled KEY STEP MAP is fairly straightforward.<br/>It includes a control for TOTAL STEPS (the total number of<br/>steps in the scale) and DIATONIC STEPS.  The remainder left<br/>over by subtracting diatonic steps from total steps is,<br/>obviously enough, the number of chromatic steps.<br/>This begs the question of what to do in a JI scale when<br/>faced with, say, the 11/9, or the 11/8...are these<br/>diatonic or chromatic steps?  The question doesn&apos;t<br/>appear to have much meaning to me, but those of you<br/>who&apos;ve delved into Finale for the purposes of notating<br/>high-limit JI may have a different opinion.  Be interested<br/>to hear from those of you who&apos;ve done this!</p><p>By creating a nonlinear key signature you can generate<br/>a notation for a tuning with no circle of fifths, and<br/>no sequence of keys.  This is useful both for equal temperaments<br/>with no fifths (6,8,9,11,13,16,18,23 equal tones per octave)<br/>and for non-just non-equal-tempered scales like the free-free<br/>metal bar scale, scales formed from ratios of infinite continued<br/>fractions, etc.</p><p>The ticket to getting Paul Rapoport&apos;s nonstandard accidentals<br/>to appear next to the correct notes is the ATTRIBUTE dialog<br/>box.</p><p>To quote the Finale manual again (Volume 3, page 300):<br/>&quot;For any such key system you create, you can specify a number of<br/>special attributes, such as the symbols you want to use in the key<br/>signature (instead of the b and # symbols).<br/>*Harmonic Reference.  This number identifies the note that all other<br/>dialog boxes in Finale&apos;s key system will consider to be the C, or<br/>fundamental root tone.  Enter zero for C, 1 for D, 2 for E, and so on.<br/>There&apos;s little ever to change the default setting in this box (zero,<br/>or C.). [Note: Unless you&apos;re notating Harry Partch&apos;s music, with his<br/>1/1 of G!]</p><p>*Middle Key Number.  This number specific the MIDI key number<br/>that corresponds to the Harmonic Reference Number.<br/>(..)  You can use this parameter to good advantage if you want<br/>to transform your synthesizer into a transposing synthesizer (as<br/>far as Finale is concerned). For example, if you set the middle<br/>Key Number to 48 (C below middlel C), Finale will interpret<br/>every note you play as a note an octave higher (...)</p><p>*Symbol Font.  This number corresonds to the font from which<br/>the symbols you want to use for accidentals are drawn.  To<br/>choose a new font, click Symbol Font; Finale displays&apos;<br/>the Font dialog box, form which you can choose the new font.</p><p>*Symbol List ID. This number identifies a symbol list you&apos;ve created--an<br/>array of accidental AMounts (where one sharp has an Amount of 1,<br/>one flat has an Amount of -1, and so on) and corresonding chracters you<br/>want to appear in the key signature to represent them.  To create a<br/>symbol list, click Symbol List ID; the Symbol List gialog box appears,<br/>in which you can define the character you want to appear in<br/>place of the usual sharp, flat, double-sharp, or other standard symbol.<br/>(See SYMBOL LIST DIALOG BOX).</p><p>*Go to Key Unit.  Enter a number in this text box to specify the<br/>number of scale steps Finale should consider to be between<br/>each pair of keys on your MIDI keyboard.  In other words, if you&apos;ve<br/>specified a quarter-tone scale, tell Finale that the Key Unit is 2--<br/>there are two scale tones, not one, between one synthesizer key and<br/>the next.  (If your synthesizer *can* produce quarter tones, however,<br/>leave the key unit at 1, so that Finale will correctly play back your<br/>quarter-tone score.</p><p>&quot;If you&apos;ve specified the correct Key Unit value, Finale will transcribe<br/>and play any music perofrmed in the usual way correctly.  If you<br/>created  quarter-tone scale without changing the Key Unit, by contrast,<br/>you&apos;d have to drastically modify your playing sytle, because Finale would<br/>treat your keyboard as show here.&quot; [Note--the diagram in the<br/>manual shows a quarter-tone keyboard replete with microtonal<br/>accidentals]&quot;<br/>Hot rats, boys!</p><p>This is a real breakthrough.  It&apos;s what we&apos;ve needed for years.<br/>It&apos;s what Lippold Haken&apos;s LIME *should* have included, but didn&apos;t.<br/>One final point: for those you whose wee widdle hearts go pit-a-pat<br/>at the thought of a musical staff with more than 5 lines, Finale<br/>also allows this.  You can completely redefine the staff, with<br/>as many lines (within practical limits) as you like.  Folks like<br/>Leo de Vries whose twinline 31-tone notation used more than 5<br/>staff lines will jump for joy at this feature in Finale 3.5<br/>Yes, Finale is still not quite as simple as quantum<br/>electrodynamics.  Those dialog boxes are not easy to find,<br/>or easy to use correctly.  But they&apos;re there.  And for the first<br/>time, they make possible transcription of xenharmonic music<br/>via  computer.</p><p>--mclaren</p><p>*** end old but still useful McLaren post ***</p></div><h3><a id=3275 href="#3275">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2002 8:39:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;joelrodrigues@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_3258.html#3258">/makemicromusic/topicId_3258.html#3258</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope this will be useful &amp; my apologies for the length if it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not.

Cheers,<br/>&gt; Joel<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks for this important post, which I&apos;m *so* glad you dug out of<br/>someplace!  Yes, you are right.  The microtonal support of Finale<br/>does seem *far* superior to that of Sibelius.</p><p>Personally, I purchased Sibelius due to the recommendation of a<br/>friend who is an premiere engraver and who knows *all* the notation<br/>programs well, but he does not deal specifically with microtonality.<br/>Of course, aside from being a microtonalist, I&apos;m actually a<br/>*composer* first and foremost, so the ease of features in Sibelius<br/>still has a significant meaning for me.</p><p>However, I&apos;m going to take the liberty of posting this information to<br/>the Sibelius website, since I think the idea of &quot;alternate key<br/>signatures&quot; or temperment set-ups would be a wonderful addition to<br/>the product.</p><p>Actually, there *is* a plug-in created by one Pete Walton, that comes<br/>close to this same technique.  HOWEVER, it doesn&apos;t provide for the<br/>addition of microtonal symbols as this one does and, instead, works<br/>with pitch bends and the current accidental set of Sibelius, so it&apos;s<br/>not as good.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
