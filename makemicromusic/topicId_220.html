It first appeared<br/>&gt;&gt; in 1778, evolving from an earlier _an&apos;t_, which arose almost a century<br/>&gt;&gt; earlier as a contraction of _are not_ and _am not_. In fact, _ain&apos;t_<br/>arose<br/>&gt;&gt; at the tail end of an era that saw the introduction of a number of<br/>&gt;&gt; our most common contractions, including _don&apos;t_ and _won&apos;t_. But while<br/>&gt;&gt; _don&apos;t_ and _won&apos;t_ eventually became accepted at all levels of speech<br/>&gt;&gt; and writing, _ain&apos;t_ was to receive a barrage of criticism in the<br/>&gt;&gt; 19th century for having no set sequence of words from which it can<br/>&gt;&gt; be contracted and for being a &quot;vulgarism,&quot; that is, a term used by<br/>&gt;&gt; the lower classes, although _an&apos;t_ at least had been originally used<br/>&gt;&gt; by the upper classes as well. At the same time _ain&apos;t_&apos;s uses were<br/>&gt;&gt; multiplying to include _has not_, _have not_, and _is not_, by influence<br/>&gt;&gt; of forms like _ha&apos;n&apos;t_ and _i&apos;n&apos;t_. It may be that these extended uses<br/>&gt;&gt; helped fuel the negative reaction. Whatever the case, criticism of<br/>&gt;&gt; _ain&apos;t_ by usage commentators and teachers has not subsided, and the<br/>&gt;&gt; use of ain&apos;t is often regarded as a sign of ignorance. &iuml;&iquest;&half;But despite<br/>&gt;&gt; all the attempts to ban it, _ain&apos;t_ continues to enjoy extensive use<br/>&gt;&gt; in speech. Even educated and upper-class speakers see no substitute<br/>&gt;&gt; in folksy expressions such as _Say it ain&apos;t so_ and _You ain&apos;t seen<br/>&gt;&gt; nothin&apos; yet_. &iuml;&iquest;&half;The stigmatization of _ain&apos;t_ leaves us with no happy<br/>&gt;&gt; alternative for use in first-person questions. The widely used<br/>&gt;&gt; _aren&apos;t I?_ though illogical, was found acceptable for use in speech<br/>&gt;&gt; by a majority of the Usage Panel in an earlier survey, but in writing<br/>&gt;&gt; there is no acceptable substitute for the stilted _am I not?_.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-&quot;professor Monzo&quot; (as Dan Stearns recently called me, for correcting his<br/>typo)<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
