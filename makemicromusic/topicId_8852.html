Without further ado -</p><p>1. TX802 - VG condition, with manuals and 3rd party books: $150<br/>2. TX81Z - like new, with manual: $100</p><p>I&apos;d consider selling both together for $200. Only other thing is to tack on UPS, which shouldn&apos;t be too much. If any of you are interested, write me off-list.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
