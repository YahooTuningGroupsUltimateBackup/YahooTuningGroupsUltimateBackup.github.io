Rick, maybe for something like this you could find a few excerpts, and do a small demo file with x-fades? In any event, it certainly shows the possibilities of Rhino, because you&apos;ve done a very nice job of &apos;orchestration&apos;, allowing for a lot of variety in the sounds.</p><p>One of the problematic areas of the softsynths is finding a true &apos;character&apos; for each, so that the mix of instruments in a piece doesn&apos;t just become flat. In a way, a couple of different instruments helps, if only because they might take different approaches to sound generation.</p><p>Would you expand just a little on your percussion use? You mentioned sampling around the house (it sounded lo-tech yet appropriate!), and I thought you said something about FXpansion?</p><p>In any event, it is really nice to hear some music for a change, with a lot of thought put into that aspect - beyond tuning.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=5266 href="#5266">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2003 10:57:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

I agree that the sounds are superior, for the most<br/>part, to the TX81Z FM sounds.  What were the details of the<br/>hardware/software setup again?</p><p>The only sounds I found a little questionable were the &quot;rattly&quot; high<br/>ones.  That sounded a bit like I had a rattle in my cans, a problem<br/>that I actually *did* have at one point.</p><p>I would also recommend, Rick, and this you can take with a grain of<br/>salt or disregard entirely, is more rhythmic variety in your<br/>compositions as a whole.  Everything is in 4/4!  Of course, you can<br/>reply that Harry Partch used regular rhythms.  This he did, however<br/>his use of tempi and registration were so ideosyncratic that he<br/>could &quot;get away with it&quot; and still always come up with something<br/>new.  You don&apos;t want to end up sounding like an electronic<br/>Hindemith... :) (not that there is anything particularly wrong with<br/>Hindemith, but we&apos;ve &quot;been there, done that...&quot;)</p><p>Maybe just adding an &quot;overlay&quot; of another layer of sounds at a<br/>different rhythm would help the piece immensely.  What I *don&apos;t*<br/>think you want is, plod, plod, plod, like we&apos;re walking through a<br/>long and rather tedious woods...</p><p>But you may entirely disregard the above if you feel it doesn&apos;t apply.</p><p>Nice job and best wishes!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p><p>P.S. Was this piece posted someplace else before??  If so, I guess I<br/>missed it the &quot;first time around...&quot;</p></div>
