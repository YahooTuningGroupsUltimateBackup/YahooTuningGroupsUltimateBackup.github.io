It took almost two weeks for them to approve Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>1a. If we are vigilant and remove old files, there should be no big<br/>problem. If we want access to all the old stuff, a good solution may<br/>be for each participant to get his own <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site and simultaneously<br/>post sound files here and there. Then after they are removed from the<br/>files here they will still be available there.

Setting up a site is pretty straightforward, but I do<br/>recommend using an alternate email address. Otherwise you will be<br/>flooded with promotions from other artists. I set up an email on<br/><a href="http://hushmail.com">hushmail.com</a>, and never see any spam. Unfortunately, when I check<br/>there from time to time, there are legitimate inquiries from people<br/>who were interested in my music.</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2001 11:42:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>BTW, when you put up a web site, you&apos;re not obligated to provide an e-mail<br/>address.  And if you do want to put up your address, you can always put<br/>something like:<br/>&#x9;rick at unicode dot org</p><p>and people will tend to get it, while the bottom-feeding spammers probably<br/>won&apos;t get it with their auto-address-sucking web-crawling software.

A kind of &quot;Tuning<br/>&gt; Punks&quot; but for this particular forum.</p><p>That&apos;s a great idea. If it&apos;s not possible to do that, I&apos;d been wondering if<br/>there&apos;s any way to post realaudio clips to the files area as well. I know<br/>the quality is even worse than mp3s, but often I don&apos;t have the time to<br/>download a piece in mp3 format, and so I unfortunately miss hearing music<br/>I&apos;d like to hear. I do have time to at least listen to the real audio clips,<br/>even though it&apos;s lower bandwidth, like George, I often choose that mode as<br/>well. There&apos;s three people in my household with computers, all vying for<br/>internet time on one phone line, which also needs to be a phone.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div>
