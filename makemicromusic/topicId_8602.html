Drummers, and their rigs, too.  Hee!</p><p>I don&apos;t really have the processing power to run the sampler, I guess, but I managed to get it to sputter at lo-fi setting, and then, when I cranked it up to &apos;hi-fi&apos; to bounce to audio, voila!  Or close enough for rock &apos;n&apos; roll, huh?  (At lo-fi, the articulations were awful, and the latency was still barely bearable...but it turned out mostly how I played it, finally.  ...Any technical observations here would be treasured, indeed!  I&#xFFFD;ve got 256 MB of RAM with a Pentium 4 2GHz...  But it&#xFFFD;s the drivers that seem to be all over the place, I think?...Sonar 3, w/Echo Mia.  Also, I guess maybe the most important thing would be to find find out where more of the piano experts are, and figure out what I need to do to get steady-running on some good soundfonts or whatever...I haven&apos;t downloaded the ones posted recently because I&apos;m not confident I know where to put them so they&apos;ll play...and they&apos;re at least as big as the VSampler&apos;s, mostly.</p><p>So, anyhow, I made up this little ditty in the wee hours lately:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/5/petemcraymusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/5/petemcraymusic.htm</a>  ===&gt;Whassup Wassily?</p><p>It&apos;s the VSampler&apos;s big, beautiful (?) grand piano tuned to &quot;Elsie Hamilton&apos;s gamut&quot; (which is from Schlesinger&apos;s Dorian, I gather...) and I don&apos;t want to go back!  I&apos;ve got to have a &#xFFFD;good&#xFFFD; piano that I can PLAY in a microtuning, now.  (God, in her infinite wisdom, saw fit to deprive me of my acoustic piano  ;-)</p><p>I won&apos;t say what I think it sounds like in the hopes that one of y&apos;all will check it out and not have your perceptions skewed by my pithy wisecrack, just yet.  Any comments would be most welcome!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Pete</p><p>ps I listened rather cursorily (!) to most of the new things posted, nice!  I hope you&#xFFFD;ll forgive me &#xFFFD;for now-- saving most of my flattery for later, or offlist... but, I think Chris Bryan&#xFFFD;s stuff is extremely promising, and muy simpatico.  Bravo!</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Gordon Rumson &#x3C;rumsong@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2005 7:59:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greetings,</p><p>Just heard about this from another list.

If the  Vsampler works how I think it does, then it&apos;s your RAM<br/>that&apos;s slowin&apos; ya down.  Upgrade to at least 512 MB (though 768 or<br/>1024 would be even better)  and you should see a noticeable<br/>improvement.  Unless of course Vsampler runs like GIGAsampler and<br/>uses your hard drive as &quot;virtual RAM&quot; to cache the samples, in which<br/>case how large/fast is your hard drive?  Also, what version of<br/>Windows are you running?  Have you made sure your computer is clean<br/>of adware, spyware, and other useless resource hogs?  I noticed my<br/>own setup was getting quite sluggish, so I reformatted and installed<br/>XP professional and the difference is unbelievable.</p><p>&gt;But it&apos;s the drivers that seem to be all over the place, I<br/>&gt;think?...Sonar 3, w/Echo Mia.</p><p>That&apos;s some good-quality stuff there, but have you made sure that<br/>Sonar is using the ASIO drivers for the Mia card and not the drivers<br/>that come bundled with it?  I know Cubase SL (what I use) defaults to<br/>its own &quot;Multimedia&quot; driver, unless I tell it to use my sound card&apos;s<br/>ASIO driver instead.  When Cubase is running on its own driver, it&apos;s<br/>totally worthless...latency is unbelievably high!  But then I switch<br/>to the correct driver, and it&apos;s just fine.</p><p>&gt; So, anyhow, I made up this little ditty in the wee hours lately:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/5/petemcraymusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/5/petemcraymusic.htm</a>  ===&gt;Whassup Wassily?</p><p>Oooh, that&apos;s a tasty one!  Prent&apos;s right, those xenharmonic intervals<br/>really do sneak up on ya...I really like that shimmering beating<br/>chord at about 1:20, and that short chromatic passage that comes just<br/>a bit later.  The theme at the end gives me a very strong image of<br/>sea cliffs on a cloudy day, with someone committing suicide(?) Don&apos;t<br/>know why, that&apos;s just what popped in to my head.  What intervals are<br/>in Elsie Hamilton&apos;s gamut?
