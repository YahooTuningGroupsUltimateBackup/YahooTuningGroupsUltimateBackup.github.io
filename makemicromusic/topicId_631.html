It&apos;s only $69 bucks.<br/>24/ 48 sound, with 48 tracks audio, 64 midi.</p><p>Full VST plug-in capability (thanks Jackal), and much much more. Loses some<br/>score function, and other stuff i don&apos;t need. Upgrade path available, so i<br/>can eventually get Cubase VST 5.0 (thanks Alison) full-blown for about the<br/>same price.</p><p>Echo Mia soundcard. <a href="http://www.audiomidi.com">www.audiomidi.com</a> (thanks Mary) salesperson said for my<br/>needs, this is the right card. $200 bucks.</p><p>So, i spend under $300 and am now playing with the big boys.</p><p>I&apos;m having built in the backyard a brand new brick wall for slamming my head<br/>against as i learn all this new crap.</p><p>Thanks everybody!</p><p>GeoZ</p><p>PS: would anybody mind if i posted a short story that is basically<br/>off-topic, but has Harry Partch mentioned absurdly in it?</p></div>
