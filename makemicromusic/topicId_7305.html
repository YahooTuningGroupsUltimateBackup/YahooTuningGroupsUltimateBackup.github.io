Pardon me, I strenuously object to the<br/>title of this thread. *I* did not pose any moral equivalence between<br/>serialists and Mengele, nor have I ever done anything similar. I<br/>quoted in its entirety an article by someone I don&apos;t know, and I<br/>thought on the whole her article was excellent, though I agree that<br/>that particular passage was in poor taste. I have no idea what she<br/>went through as a victim of that particular ideology; her experience<br/>may have been worse than mine, which was bad enough. But I would never<br/>have said such a thing myself, and I will not have this statement<br/>attributed to me. I quoted her, as I quote many people who write in,<br/>but I also linked to disagreeing respondents.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2004 8:24:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kylegann1955&quot; &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p> I have no idea what she<br/>&gt; went through as a victim of that particular ideology; her experience<br/>&gt; may have been worse than mine, which was bad enough.</p><p>I&apos;ve changed the offending subject line; sorry I mislead Prent into<br/>attributing all that to you. Serialism itself has passed its heyday,<br/>but that doesn&apos;t seem to have lead to a warm embrace for either<br/>microtonality or just intonation. How bad would you say the ideolgical<br/>situation is for you now?</p></div>
