It&apos;s based on a Martin Luther tune, harmonized by Bach. There&apos;s a description here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ylmnqjj">http://tinyurl.com/ylmnqjj</a></p><p>The basic idea of this transformation is to stay on each chord for a while before moving to the next one. It&apos;s very simple, but these harmonies are so sweet that I just couldn&apos;t stand to rush through.</p><p>I&apos;m casting about for the next one to try. I been listening to Ben Johnston&apos;s Amazing Grace (String Quartet Number Four) by the Kronos Quartet. Truly amazing. His approach was thematic, and mine is very mechanical. I&apos;ve thought about using some more challenging tunings, but I can&apos;t get them to sound right.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
