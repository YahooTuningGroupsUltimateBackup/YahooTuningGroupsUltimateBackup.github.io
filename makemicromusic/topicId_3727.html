But that&apos;s because it&apos;s not for &quot;performance&quot;.  The<br/>name is a bit of a misnomer:  it&apos;s not a traditional &quot;synth.&quot;</p><p>Have you ever heard of Xenakis&apos; UPIC system?  The one where you can draw<br/>shapes on a page, and it converts them into wonderful (or annoying,<br/>depending on your POV) glissandos and sudden blasts of sound, etc?  Well<br/>that&apos;s basically what it does.</p><p>Or you can scan in photos of your doggie and have it somehow interpret<br/>them as sound, etc, etc.</p><p>Like any tool there are two sides:  first,  the  &quot;most obvious&quot; stuff that<br/>one can do.  Lots of glisses in this case.  It&apos;s  easy to dismiss<br/>Metasynth from this angle.</p><p>But if you get into it (I haven&apos;t really gotten deep into it), I think you<br/>can do some cool stuff, including microtonal things.  Some of the demos<br/>that come with it show its versatility.   All kinds of beautiful play with<br/>timbre can happen.</p><p>But it&apos;s definitely not for a live performance paradigm.</p><p>Perhaps the name &quot;metasynth&quot; comes from the fact that you could use it to<br/>construct scales that you could load in as sample banks in another<br/>synthesizer.  Hence it can be a Synth of Synths, so to speak.</p><p>cb</p></div>
