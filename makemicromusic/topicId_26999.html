It holds up to 20 pounds of tools. Amazon has a<br/>24&quot; version at the same price which holds 50 pounds of tools.  I almost<br/>bought 2 this morning - but the downside is that this a quite heavy piece of<br/>equipment. 2 of them (as in the original design in my mind) would have been<br/>a bear to play for any length of time. However, I think I have a design that<br/>may be workable though it would need some precision work to pull it off.<br/>Essentially the rack goes in the middle with wood glued on either side with<br/>a suitably rough surface on the wood to prevent easy movement of whatever is<br/>being used for frets. The main requirement is that everything at the playing<br/>surface needs to be flush.   I&apos;m still working out the best way to do this<br/>in my mind.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sat, Mar 26, 2011 at 10:32 PM, ixlramp &lt;ixlramp@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I fear velcro will be too squishy ... a fret needs to be firmly supported<br/>&gt; upon the neck of an instrument for good tone.
