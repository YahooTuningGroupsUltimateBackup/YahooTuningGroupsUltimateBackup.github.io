I suppose I failed at my goal, which was to write something with a<br/>&gt;dance-like energy, new age like softness, jazz-style solos, and ambient-like<br/>&gt;textures that really can&apos;t be pigeonholed in a genre.&nbsp; Maybe I should have gone<br/>&gt;even further and thrown in some surprise harsh sounds to make it more obvious<br/>&gt;it&apos;s not easy listening?.. ..</p><p>I think you did quite well if you were trying for &quot;dance-like energy, new age<br/>like softness, jazz-style solos&quot;. Since there are hundreds of genres of popular<br/>music I couldn&apos;t possibly say it wasn&apos;t like any of them, however. I&apos;m pretty<br/>certain that my entry didn&apos;t fall into any recognizable genre, but if Hans<br/>thinks it does I would, like you, be interested to hear what pigeon he thinks<br/>inhabits that particular hole.</p><p>&nbsp;Mark Stephens<br/>ProgPositivity - The Best Prog and Fusion - Positively!<br/><a href="http://www.progpositivity.com">http://www.progpositivity.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
