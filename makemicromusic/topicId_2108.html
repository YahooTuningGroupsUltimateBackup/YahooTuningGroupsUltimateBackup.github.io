There&apos;s a tick box in Nero to do this but it auto<br/>unselects itself whenever I try to write the cd for some reason.<br/>Does anyone else by chance happen to use this software<br/>and know why it does this?</p><p>My cd-writer does have a program for designing labels for cds<br/>but I haven&apos;t tried it yet.</p><p>I&apos;m very new to all this.

I think Bart Hopkins<br/>really did it right with all his EMI ventures. To my mind<br/>microtonality has never been able to duplicate this sort of a<br/>thing--this may have to do with the fact that new instruments are<br/>intrinsically more interesting than new tunings?</p><p>The problem with a quality control of this sort is who decides--sure,<br/>self regulation would be ideal, but it&apos;s still so subjective and tough<br/>a call! My interests would be in striking music, as striking music<br/>wipes away most any quibble about sound quality and refined<br/>presentation. But again, what I find striking my neighbor would just<br/>as likely grace his trash can with!</p><p>To maintain the standards you seem to be advocating, I think you<br/>either need one person saying good, or I wish you&apos;d try and contribute<br/>something different. That&apos;s an evil job, but apparently somebody&apos;s got<br/>to do it!</p><p>Or not. There&apos;s also the ever-open approach nicely advocated by Jacky<br/>Ligon and personified in the old Sonic Options Network home taper<br/>scene of which we both were a part--anything goes, your mileage may<br/>vary!</p><p>The important thing there was the warm sense of community... make no<br/>mistake, there was good music going on there, but by and large it was<br/>the community and the cause over musicianship and quality control.</p><p>Where we stand seems to me very much predicated on what it is that we<br/>want to accomplish... the sense of community is nice here, call it a<br/>clique, whatever. Would we want to risk putting forward a project<br/>where someone might have to be in the position of ruffling some<br/>feathers and stepping on some toes... it&apos;s a tough call.</p><p>My personal view is no. I prefer mature, striking music to tuning<br/>experimentations, and I&apos;m very hard on myself when it comes to<br/>musicianship and esthetics, but I also prefer a cool community to one<br/>that might be compromised if someone&apos;s got to make these types of<br/>decisions--especially when the eventual outcome may not be any<br/>different either way!</p><p>In our community, as it presently stands, my vote goes to the approach<br/>that&apos;s fueled by heartfelt enthusiasm over one that&apos;s emphasizes<br/>quality control--with the hopefully obvious caveat that quality<br/>control is not necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Jonathan M.

It normally takes me<br/>longer to get around loading this stuff up so my response is always after the<br/>others but no less enthusiastic!</p><p>    I hope i don&apos;t step on any toes, but i can say i have never enjoyed any<br/>compilation (that involved more than a single artist). this in no way is any<br/>judgment on the fine work it can include. I think in the future, when<br/>confronted with such an object i will know better (after umpteenth years) that<br/>i will be wise enough to listen only one piece at a time with hours or a day<br/>in-between. I doubt most will do likewise though</p><p>I think what might work is two or three people on a single CD that had work<br/>that complimented each other could work.

I know<br/>situations by other non-profit groups where money is &quot;donated&quot; to a group<br/>which uses that money to pay for something such as a CD or such and it becomes<br/>paid for and the person donating the money has a tax deduction. Usually a<br/>small fee is involved, but i have seen situations where possibly a number of<br/>the CDs are given to the non profit to sale.</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.
