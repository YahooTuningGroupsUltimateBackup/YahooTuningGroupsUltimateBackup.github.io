Then, when you&apos;re hearing<br/>&gt; melodies in your head based on this pattern in your mind, do you ever<br/>&gt; hear a pitch that is _not_ present on the keyboard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Answer that before you read the rest of this message.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would expect this to happen sometimes with an improper scale like<br/>&gt; Blackjack, while in 12-tET, it might _never_ happen because all the<br/>&gt; intervals in the scale (and thus in your mental &quot;template&quot; or<br/>&gt; whatever), when transposed to other starting pitches, lead to ending<br/>&gt; pitches which are always in the same scale.

This is a major attraction of ETs to me --<br/>and on guitar, non-ETs pose certain difficulties. On the other hand,<br/>as Gary Morrison likes to point out, often the best compositions come<br/>from &quot;limits&quot; that one imposes on oneself . . . so rather than follow<br/>every desire to add alterations, you may want to try, once in a<br/>while, thinking to yourself, &quot;what twist can I throw into this<br/>composition now to make things interesting, without going outside the<br/>basic pitch set and leading down the slippery slope toward ET?&quot;</p></div>
