And so we come to the final results. I propose before the money is paid out to wait one week, in that week people can put in their protest if I still missed a few errors in double checking the votes. Of course, the votes as they stand in my database file cannot be changed anymore, I only take on protest if I made a miscalculation or missed a vote for somebody in my file.</p><p>With that said the standing is as follows:</p><p>THE WINNER OF THE SOON $35 COMPO IS:</p><p>With 33 points, the $20 is for:</p><p>#19 Behind the sun, by Solo</p><p>With 31 points the $10 is for:</p><p>#17 Saba Storm, by Ozman Yarman</p><p>With 24 points the $5 is for:</p><p>#14 Nahkranoth-INT-1d10, by Nahkranoth</p><p>With that the money has been decided, but of course, we may never forget the other contestants</p><p>4th place: 14 points<br/>#05 Erm Bubbles, by Screaming Egg Notion</p><p>5th place: 12 points<br/>#09 Inside Xerxes, by Ceekayed</p><p>6th place: 10 points<br/>#03 The Crazy Jazzbox of Funk, by Jikoo</p><p>7th place: 8 points (won tie-break by being first one to get 5 points)<br/>#15 Loops of Lawn, by Daniel Jackson</p><p>8th place: 8 points<br/>#02 Somewhere in 3009, by Louigi Verona</p><p>9th place: 6 points (won tie-break by getting 5 points most)<br/>#04 Used all of the $35, by Eat Me</p><p>10th place: 6 points<br/>#18 Step on it, by Din</p><p>11th place: 5 points<br/>#08 Yume, by Phaze Zero</p><p>12th place: 4 points<br/>#10 Freaks we are, by DJ Alces</p><p>13th place: 3 points<br/>#11 A la source by Paul Legovitch</p><p>14th place: 2 points<br/>#12 Dark Magic Mind, by Black Tiger</p><p>15th place: 1 point<br/>#16 Hexentanz by IV65536</p><p>And then there are 4 entries who didn&apos;t get any points at all.<br/>I still want them to have a warm applause, as even though they didn&apos;t get any votes, they took the trouble to participate with good entries, so they too deserve the honor.</p><p>#01 7-klapper, by: Jonas the Plugexpert<br/>#07 I&apos;ll be there soon, by Likuid (TiS)<br/>#06 Breaking the Broken, by Zan (TiS)<br/>#13 Hot Sim Module by DJ Kujata (TiS)</p><p>I&apos;ll soon post a screenshot of my database, so you can see if I counted all votes correctly</p><p>Thanks to everyone who entered this compo, and to all who voted.<br/>Too bad 4 votes have been rejected due to an invalid format and 14 because of fraud. That&apos;s too bad, but still we got a clear ranking.</p><p>If you see your own vote missing in my database, then it means the vote never reached me (or that is was removed/rejected in the reason stated above), and can not be counted. As said the votes as I have them are final, I only accept protest for counting/calculation errors.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Jeroen Broks a.k.a.

It is quite unfortunate that he feels this way<br/>about the majority of the microtonal community and particularly myself<br/>despite the good will I have extended towards him.</p><p>It is quite inconceivable that a person with a healthy state of mind<br/>would react so harshly towards earnest concerns voiced out for the<br/>betterment of possible future endeavours in the musical arena. What<br/>Mr. Vaisvil defines as &quot;my incessant arguing&quot; was me sharing my<br/>consternation with the voting process in case Mr. Vaisvil would<br/>consider sponsoring a similar event in the future. The increasing tone<br/>of my concerns reflected my distress after Mr. Chris Vaisvil implied<br/>that the Turkish vote did not listen to the songs, therefore<br/>insinuated that &quot;The Saba Storm&quot; won first place with fraud, and that I should drop the subject.</p><p>It was disconcerting enough that Mr. Vaisvil, after all this,<br/>complained that even I was not satisfied with the results. Now he says<br/>that the results are legitimate. I only wish he made this point very<br/>clear from the beginning in his announcement. But Instead of easing<br/>the worries, I fear he has exacerbated them. His latest attitude does<br/>not in the least help lessen the tension.</p><p>Frankly, I do not believe I deserve any of Mr. Vaisvil&apos;s reactions. I<br/>do not believe Graham or Prent or Michael deserves this outburst. And<br/>the latest inadvertent portrayal of my person as a greedy, covetous<br/>scoundral demanding payment for deeds implied as undeserved, even for<br/>such trifling a sum as 20 USD, is blood-curdling. In my mind, I only<br/>had the intention to facilitate the payment process for Mr. Vaisvil<br/>after he requested my paypal account information. I never used Paypal<br/>before to receive a transaction, and in requesting payment from Mr.<br/>Chris Vaisvil for what he said he owed me, I was the one paying for<br/>the transaction charges. Besides, I did not keep the money, not one<br/>dime, for I have donated it to charity after witnessing Mr. Vaisvil&apos;s<br/>most perplexing demeanor.</p><p>Again, I wish to express my sadness about all that happened.</p><p>I hope I have elucidated my position and vindicated my fairness.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Nov 12, 2009, at 5:15 PM, christopherv wrote:</p><p>&gt; I seriously doubt I will offer entry to any future SoOn contest to<br/>&gt; the microtonal people.

Frankly I find your use of slides contrite<br/>&gt;and just a way to obfuscate the microtonality which isn&apos;t working.</p><p>FWIW, in my opinion Prent&apos;s music is already better than any of<br/>the Soon entries.  I think the microtonality works well, and I think<br/>his music would still be good in 12.  I think this is true of his<br/>music from the late &apos;90s, before he started using slides, and I like<br/>the slides.  Too much electronic music is born of a keyboard or<br/>keyboard mentality (the only instrument with discrete notes).<br/>Either that, or pitch control is thrown out the window altogether.<br/>Prent&apos;s slides aren&apos;t a huge leap away from keyboardism, but they<br/>work OK for me.  And generally his stuff has lightyears more going<br/>on in it than tracker-based stuff.</p><p>One criticism of Prent&apos;s stuff is that it all kinda sounds the same.<br/>Still, I&apos;ve been very impressed by his ability to continually make<br/>subtle refinements over the years.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say the Soon entries were bad - I don&apos;t mean that<br/>at all.</p><p>I thought Ozan&apos;s piece was nice, though I found the thunder and<br/>lightning a bit tacky (OK, it does fit the theme).  Importantly,<br/>while I welcome Dr Oz, I hope he doesn&apos;t completely abandon the<br/>qanun, or the piano or Western orchestra.  In fact I know I&apos;m not<br/>the only hoping to hear more of the 79-tone qanun.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=21480 href="#21480">ðŸ”—</a>dan &#x3C;dasdasdva@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2009 1:51:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Not that anyone asked my opinion, or that it even means much of anything whatsoever.....
