In order, the scales I used are:</p><p>3343334, 5225252, 3335333, and 5151515.  The first is a form of Mavila temperament, but it&apos;s very different in character from 16-EDO.  I like this version better, actually...it feels more consonant.  The second is sort of a cross-breed of Dicot and Father, where the generator is a very flat major 3rd and two of them form a very sharp fifth.  It&apos;s improper and that leads to some pretty interesting consequences, like a minor 3rd being a 9/8 while the major 2nd is a 7/6.  The third is superficially reminiscent of Porcupine[7] but the harmonies are very different--two generators is still a 6/5, but four is either a 10/7 or a 13/9 (depending on your mood) instead of a 16/11, five is an 11/7 instead of 8/5, and 6 is a 12/7 instead of a 7/4.  The fourth scale is maybe Myna temperament, maybe not (depending on whether you&apos;re listening to Graham Breed or Paul Erlich).  The generator is a 6/5 and two of them gets you a 10/7, but the approximations to the 3rd and 5th harmonics are, uh, &quot;questionable&quot;.  I don&apos;t know why anyone would use it for full 7-limit harmony but it&apos;s pretty solid as a 2.5/3.7/3 subgroup.  The scale itself is pretty out-there, though...it sounds kind of like two diminished chords tuned a quarter-tone apart, but I kind of love the shimmering &quot;double minor&quot; effect of playing a 6/5 and a 7/6 simultaneously.</p><p>Well, enjoy!
