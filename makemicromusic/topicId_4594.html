What is  left of my question I suppose,<br/>is: &quot;if we  want 17 or 24 tones per octave how  does that alter the<br/>purposed design?&quot;  I don&apos;t know what tenths have to do with Arabic<br/>music (my current area of study)for example.  If we dropped  some<br/>requirements and added  others might  we find that a three  or four<br/>tiered board would do?  Six tiers just looks intimidating.</p><p>Thanks  for your help,<br/>Jim Nagy</p></div><h3><a id=4598 href="#4598">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2003 11:45:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;What a great responce.
