Composers at the Delians are generally (but not always)<br/>&gt;      a bit<br/>&gt;      conservative, and work in styles and harmonies from the 16th to<br/>&gt;      20th<br/>&gt;      centuries (Prokovief et al). This is over-simplifying to say<br/>&gt;      the least,<br/>&gt;      but gives a general idea of where they&apos;re coming from.<br/>&gt;</p><p>From a composer&apos;s point of view, serialism is a technique, not a style. It is perfectly possible, and indeed, great fun and a worthy artistic endeavour to compose tonal serial music.</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
