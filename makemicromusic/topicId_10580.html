I looked for 12- and 24-note scales since obviously they map easily to conventional keyboards and are small enough to be actually playable.</p><p>I put up some scala files for those who want to try them out in practice.</p><p><a href="http://magnus.smartelectronix.com/scales/">http://magnus.smartelectronix.com/scales/</a></p><p>Here is the list of scales I found:</p><p>12 notes/oct:</p><p>[1,3] x [1,3,5,7,9,11,13]<br/>[1,3,5] x [1,3,5] x ~[1,3,5]<br/>[1,3,5] x [1,3,5,7,11]<br/>[1,3,5,7,9] x ~[1,3,5]<br/>[1,3,5,7] x [1,3,5,9]<br/>[1,3] x [1,3] x [1,3,5] x [1,3,5]</p><p>24 notes/oct:</p><p>[1,3] x [1,3] x [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]<br/>[1,3,5] x [1,3,5,7] x [1,3,5,7,9]<br/>[1,3,5,7,9,11] x ~[1,3,5,7,9]<br/>[1,3,5,7,9,11] x [1,3,5,7,9,11,15]</p><p>This list is not exhaustive and I&apos;m sure there are other nice structures too.
