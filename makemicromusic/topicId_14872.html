So I would call my personal ideal &apos;constructive criticism&apos;<br/>instead.(This of course assumes we want the community to be peaceful<br/>and cohesive). Negativity as I described it is just plain uncool and<br/>toxic. It might in fact be called &apos;destructive criticism&apos; since it<br/>discourages good feelings and mutual exploration and encouragement,<br/>and causes upset and hurt feelings all around.

I didn&apos;t listen to any of these until this<br/>past weekend, but I did listen to everything (twice).  Even though<br/>I&apos;m familiar with the intervals in 17, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s enough<br/>exposure for me to make constructive comments, since it&apos;s quite a bit<br/>to digest, and I would no doubt pick up things on additional hearings<br/>that I missed previously.</p><p>Anyway, I thought it might be helpful if I shared a few high points<br/>concerning my own 17-tone odyssey.</p><p>One of the roughest things I found about 17 is figuring how to go<br/>about writing for it.  At first (in 1963) I didn&apos;t even think it was<br/>worth bothering with, and it took 15 years for me to reach the<br/>conclusion that I was wrong.  At that time I devised a 17-tone well-<br/>temperament, which appeared in the first issue of _Interval_.  About<br/>23 years after that, Margo Schulter tried my 17-WT and wrote me about<br/>how much she liked it for her neo-medieval music.  I found this a bit<br/>puzzing, and our correspondence over the next few months resulted in<br/>some startling new discoveries about 17, at which point I finally put<br/>my thoughts (both old and new) into a paper (26 pages), completed in<br/>December 2001 for the &quot;upcoming&quot; issue of Xenharmonikon 18.  Needless<br/>to say, It took nearly 5 years before it got published and mailed out<br/>(this past week, along with Margo&apos;s companion article) at a very<br/>appropriate time, I might add: on the heels of Jacob&apos;s 17-tone piano<br/>project 2.</p><p>I gather that nobody here with any interest in 17 (other than Margo)<br/>has seen it yet, since nobody else has mentioned it. :-(  Perhaps I<br/>should find some place to put it online.</p><p>Aaron, I take an approach to 17 that&apos;s similar to the way you studied<br/>19 before composing &quot;The Juggler&quot;.  Since the intervals in 17 are,<br/>generally speaking, less consonant than those in 19, I made it a<br/>point to identify the most consonant chords, which I then used to<br/>construct several types of scales (some of which are MOS).  My<br/>objective is to use as many tried-and-true principles of composition<br/>as possible, e.g., good voice-leading, proper utilization of harmonic<br/>vs. non-harmonic tones, and resolution of dissonant chords to more<br/>consonant ones.  One particularly delightful discovery about 17 that<br/>I cover in my paper is the possibility of neatly resolving an<br/>apparent conflict between the requirements for the most effective<br/>melodic vs. harmonic intervals.</p><p>So where&apos;s the music?  Good news: around 3 years ago I started<br/>writing a piece in 17-WT, which is based on an idea that I tried in a<br/>1978 improvisation using a 9-tone MOS scale described in the paper.<br/>Bad news: due to too many other things competing for my time and<br/>attention, I&apos;ve completed only 24 measures so far.  Good news: that<br/>should be enough to give you a taste of what 13-limit non-5 harmony<br/>(consisting largely of both block &amp; broken chords) sounds like,<br/>performed by a 17-WT virtual jazz ensemble.  Only two notes in the<br/>example (very-short-duration passing tones) are foreign to the MOS<br/>scale:</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/17WTjazz.mp3</p><p>Bad news: sorry, but tuning-math was the only place I could find with<br/>enough room left (filesize of 763K) in the files section, so if<br/>someone else would like to volunteer to put it somewhere temporarily<br/>for tuning-math non-members, I would appreciate it.

Also it is a very melodic tuning I think, one which somehow<br/>lets melody lines really soar. Like, you can have maybe a bit of a chord<br/>structure, light accompaniment, then let the melody line soar<br/>above it into the clouds. Or with just a sparse arrangement of three<br/>voices or so like Margo&apos;s piece.  I mean just as one take on it, I&apos;m not<br/>trying to prescribe to anyone how to compose in 17-et!</p><p>It does well in sparse textures just because the chords are so<br/>rough, so with few notes you get much richer sounding chords<br/>than you do with many more notes in 12 equal, and it is<br/>a good tuning for saying a lot with a few notes as well.</p><p>Maybe in the future some composer could do a 17-et<br/>equivalent of Vaughn William&apos;s Lark Ascending (I mean a new<br/>piece with same soaring quality, not a 17-et transcription).</p><p>I enjoyed the concert a lot. I thought also the performers did a good job<br/>and it really brings life to the pieces to hear them and indeed it is nice<br/>to be able to watch the concert on video too for that matter, and somehow<br/>feel one is taking part as audience from the distance.</p><p>My particular favourites, for what it is worth, were Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>Sub arbore and Dan Stearn&apos;s Cirrus and Pileus. Margo&apos;s one<br/>brought out the kind of yearning beauty of the tuning so,<br/>and Dan Stearn&apos;s was so kind of joyful and fun :-).<br/>Also Dan&apos;s one had a brilliant fun ending!</p><p>BTW everyone - I&apos;ve been very pre-occupied with finishing FTS 3.0<br/>release, however it is finally finally getting close to being ready<br/>hopefully -  for those interested - it should be ready fairly soon now<br/>hopefully...

Or with just a sparse arrangement of three<br/>&gt; voices or so like Margo&apos;s piece.</p><p>With 17-WT sparse voicing isn&apos;t essential.  I have mostly 4-voice<br/>examples in my paper, in which, BTW, Margo and her music play a very<br/>prominent role.  The supporting cast includes Ivor Darreg, Marchettus<br/>of Padua, and Archytas of Tarentum.</p><p>&gt; I mean just as one take on it, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; trying to prescribe to anyone how to compose in 17-et!</p><p>For 17, suggestions are always welcome!</p><p>&gt; It does well in sparse textures just because the chords are so<br/>&gt; rough, so with few notes you get much richer sounding chords<br/>&gt; than you do with many more notes in 12 equal, and it is<br/>&gt; a good tuning for saying a lot with a few notes as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe in the future some composer could do a 17-et<br/>&gt; equivalent of Vaughn William&apos;s Lark Ascending (I mean a new<br/>&gt; piece with same soaring quality, not a 17-et transcription).</p><p>Perhaps one could use a simple chain-of-fifths pentatonic scale as a<br/>starting point; this could also be opened up into a 5-note broken<br/>chord texture (as stacked 4ths, taking every other note of the scale)<br/>to accompany a melody.  That could then be varied by substituting<br/>other tones into the scale to include some neutral (11 and 13)<br/>intervals into the mix (or by adding a couple more notes to the scale<br/>for the melodic part, making it heptatonic), finally ending with the<br/>original pentatonic scale/chord.  (Golly, in 2 sentences of text I&apos;ve<br/>practically written the piece for you!)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=14902 href="#14902">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

You feel that diatonic melody is superior with fifths sharp<br/>around this size, but also that diatonic harmony is nonexistent. The<br/>most direct answer is Pajara/Diaschismic[14], 14 tones of two<br/>parallel chains of fifths. Or if you can wean yourself away from<br/>those chains of fifths, Pajara[10] or Pajara[12] a la Paul Erlich.<br/>Both the harmonic and melodic resources are rich enough to began<br/>with, and of course if you&apos;ve gone ahead and actually tuned an<br/>instrument to 34 notes, as some people have managed sucessfully, you<br/>have complete harmonic freedom--no well temperaments need apply.</p><p>I note also you mention 41 but not 46 in your paper; 41 is a<br/>schismatic system, but 46 has fifths in the range you regard as<br/>melodically ideal. Of course, for many purposes both have too darn<br/>many notes.</p><p>Have you or Margo ever toyed with 46? You&apos;ve mentioned you like it<br/>better than 31, and it seems pretty well up your and Margo&apos;s line.<br/>Smallish leading tones of 78 and 52 cents are of course available.<br/>The leapday temperament, using 27 degrees of 46 (the fifth) as a<br/>generator, has MOS of 12, 17 and 29 steps. The Pythagorean thirds are<br/>much, much closer--nearly pure--to 14/11 than in the case of 17. The<br/>17 MOS therefore has some of the advantages of a well-temperament,<br/>whereas the 29 MOS has a variety of harmony including the good 5-<br/>limit harmony of 46, but with all kinds of exotic possibilities. Of<br/>course if you get away from fifths as generators other possibilities<br/>open up, some involving rather small scales.</p></div><h3><a id=14948 href="#14948">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

George,<br/>congratulations also on generously making available your article<br/>here.</p><p>The concert, as the mp3 files show, represents both the devoted<br/>efforts of many composers and the incredible diversity of styles and<br/>approached which even a single tuning system can make possible. It&apos;s<br/>curious to ask how the same pieces might have fared if Jacob&apos;s two<br/>pianos (and flexible-pitch instruments) had been oriented instead to<br/>George&apos;s 17-WT; as you nicely explain in your article, George, the<br/>situation is indeed somewhat analogous to 12-EDO vs. various 12-WT<br/>schemes.</p><p>Jacob, I&apos;d like to congratulate you especially for your flexibility of<br/>concept. While the ground rules of the event suggested compositions<br/>meant for performance on the two pianos, I submitted something really<br/>outside this agenda: a composition more inclined to performance by<br/>three instruments, one to a melodic line, for example. Your very<br/>creative and fitting solution was to propose a performance for string<br/>ensemble, which I would say wonderfully fits my intentions as composer<br/>and the nature of the music. In finding this solution you showed real<br/>graciousness as well as musical sensitivity!</p><p>On the topic of 17-EDO/WT generally, I might offer a few comments from<br/>the viewpoint of solo keyboard performance, which you, George, can<br/>doubtless augment or qualify. As we both discuss in our Xenharmonikon<br/>articles, a main characteristic of circulating 17-note tunings is that<br/>the septimal or Archytan comma at 64:63 gets tempered out, so that one<br/>can play the best approximations of septimal (2-3-7 prime) harmony<br/>with usual notes and spellings. This makes life simpler, albeit with a<br/>bit less accuracy for these ratios. Of course, with 17-WT, the rich<br/>variety of just approximations with the interval sizes strategically<br/>placed for combinations like 7:9:11:13 compensates for these necessary<br/>compromises -- especially when we consider that there are only 17<br/>notes!</p><p>At the keyboard, I can feel the difference between 17-WT or the like<br/>and something like the Peppermint temperament, where the 64:63 is<br/>observed and there&apos;s a constant, if often only implicit, element of<br/>choice: &quot;do I want a 13:11 or 7:6 minor third, a 14:11 or 9:7 major<br/>third?&quot; etc. In the kinds of styles I typically play, the tuning of<br/>these imperfect consonances is rather flexible, so I sometimes freely<br/>alternate depending on mood. However, if consistently septimal harmony<br/>is desired, then something like 17-WT has its advantages.</p><p>Gene, your comments about the advantages of 46-EDO and related tunings<br/>suggest that different people can sometimes arrive at similar reasons<br/>for intriguingly distinct reasons. In 1978, George, you designed 17-WT<br/>with the eight more remote fifths at 704.377 cents, thus producing<br/>some pure 14:11 major thirds. Then, in 2000, not yet knowing of this<br/>classic system, I devised a tuning with 11 fifths of this same size (a<br/>&quot;14:11 eventone&quot; analogous to a meantone, as I would now describe it),<br/>plus six wider ones to complete the circle and produce two pure 9:7<br/>major thirds in the remote portion of the tuning. My 11 nearer fifths<br/>would be almost identical to the 12-of-46-EDO tuning kown as<br/>&quot;leapday,&quot; with the remote portion of the circle rather like 22-EDO.</p><p>From a stylistic perspective, 17 may be the smallest circulating<br/>system which can reasonably well represent intervals such as neutral<br/>thirds and sixths, a great resource in either an equally or unequally<br/>realization. Indeed, as Shaahin&apos;s music illustrates, these intervals<br/>are basic to many world traditions.</p><p>I would like join with those urging that criticism posted in MMM<br/>remain constructive and also preferably focus on the aspects of a<br/>piece which the composer strove to create and which might help to<br/>explain a listener&apos;s reaction. For example, if someone offered their<br/>best effort in a 12-note well-temperament of some variety, I would not<br/>consider it so helpful to respond:</p><p>        &quot;Another piece in a tuning without neutral thirds (sigh).&quot;</p><p>Rather I might do better to save my sigh for a madrigal setting which<br/>it could inspire some apt musical effect,</p><p>A final item for now: the discussion of 17 has led to questions of<br/>larger circulating tunings which could make available additional or<br/>more accurate just approximations. One possibility, which you might<br/>well be able to improve further, George, is a variation on your HTT-29<br/>where all 29 fifths are within 1/4 of an Archytas&apos; comma of just:</p><p>! htct29b.scl<br/>!<br/>Circulating variation on George Secor&apos;s HTT-29<br/> 29<br/>!<br/> 58.08982<br/> 97.04980<br/> 135.05910<br/> 179.15633<br/> 207.15739<br/> 265.24721<br/> 296.73555<br/> 347.35374<br/> 5/4<br/> 414.31478<br/> 472.40460<br/> 496.42131<br/> 554.51113<br/> 593.47110<br/> 56/39<br/> 679.56199<br/> 703.57869<br/> 761.66852<br/> 800.62849<br/> 843.77505<br/> 882.73502<br/> 910.73608<br/> 7/4<br/> 992.84261<br/> 1050.93244<br/> 1089.89241<br/> 1117.89347<br/> 1175.98329<br/> 2/1</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=14962 href="#14962">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

One possibility, which you might<br/>&gt; well be able to improve further, George, is a variation on your HTT-<br/>29<br/>&gt; where all 29 fifths are within 1/4 of an Archytas&apos; comma of just:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! htct29b.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Circulating variation on George Secor&apos;s HTT-29<br/>&gt;  29<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  58.08982<br/>&gt;  97.04980<br/>&gt;  135.05910<br/>&gt;  179.15633<br/>&gt;  207.15739<br/>&gt;  265.24721<br/>&gt;  296.73555<br/>&gt;  347.35374<br/>&gt;  5/4<br/>&gt;  414.31478<br/>&gt;  472.40460<br/>&gt;  496.42131<br/>&gt;  554.51113<br/>&gt;  593.47110<br/>&gt;  56/39<br/>&gt;  679.56199<br/>&gt;  703.57869<br/>&gt;  761.66852<br/>&gt;  800.62849<br/>&gt;  843.77505<br/>&gt;  882.73502<br/>&gt;  910.73608<br/>&gt;  7/4<br/>&gt;  992.84261<br/>&gt;  1050.93244<br/>&gt;  1089.89241<br/>&gt;  1117.89347<br/>&gt;  1175.98329<br/>&gt;  2/1</p><p>Well, that&apos;s workable, and you&apos;re certainly welcome to use it.</p><p>Personally, I&apos;d prefer not to change the pitch of D(!) from what I<br/>originally had, since it results in 5.137-cent and 10.274-cent<br/>maximum errors in the F and Bb (i.e., 2 out of a total of 6) ogdoads,<br/>respectively, which is excessive error IMO for a near-JI<br/>temperament.  I would instead prefer to leave the B-to-quasi-F# as a<br/>dissonant fifth (with +13.5-cent error) that can be resolved to<br/>something else.  Since HTT is intended to mimic JI, it should be<br/>expected to have many of the same properties, including the<br/>occurrence of various complex intervals that only roughly approximate<br/>simpler ones by happenstance (rather than by design).</p><p>Another consideration is that the first (or main) 17-tone &quot;triple-<br/>delight&quot; subset of the complete 41-tone HTT also contains D(!), and<br/>that tuning would suffer damage (without any benefit) from such a<br/>modification.  I did previously lower the pitch of G(!) in the 29-<br/>tone set (from its value in the 41-tone superset, by a lesser amount<br/>that you specify above) to make an exact 13:8 with Bb, since it<br/>doesn&apos;t cause the error of any interval in the Bb otonal ogdoad to<br/>exceed the 3.25-cent maximum allowed (and also since that tone<br/>doesn&apos;t occur in any of the 17-tone subsets, which results in only a<br/>single variance between HTT sets).</p><p>BTW, those who have read the article might wonder about the<br/>unidentified tuning mentioned in this passage (on page 69):</p><p>&lt;&lt;  I have tried a number of the progressions that we have discovered<br/>in 17 WT in other tuning systems, and there is a near-just 13-limit<br/>system (that includes ratios of 5) into which virtually everything<br/>that we have tried can be transferred; the progressions not only<br/>work, but they sound even better than in 17 WT!  &gt;&gt;</p><p>The mystery tuning is, in fact, the 29-tone HTT.

I&apos;m planning on PostScript and PDF, and have noted a<br/>few corrections I should make -- although I had four years before<br/>publication to catch them, and they were totally my goofs.</p><p>Please let me take this opportunity to say how wonderful our dialogue<br/>was, some of which (a small part) appears in our XH18 articles.<br/>Really, you are a great friend, mentor, and musician.</p><p>Anyway, in the meantime, here are a PDF score for _Sub arbore_, and<br/>also a keyboard performance which might be interesting to compare to<br/>the flexible-pitch performance by the string ensemble at the concert:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/SubArbore.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/SubArbore.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/SubArbore.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/SubArbore.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>The PDF file is actually in Sagittal notation for Peppermint 24 (in<br/>turn largely based on a 121-EDO symbol set which you and Dave Keenan<br/>devised), but can easily be read in 17 (equal or unequal) since the<br/>only accidentals are B-half-flat (or Bd in our articles) and<br/>E-half-flat or Ed. In a conventional 17 spelling, these would map to<br/>D# and A#.</p><p>One of the &quot;nice things&quot; we might both have in mind, I suspect, are<br/>what we decided to term &quot;equable&quot; cadences where a major sixth expands<br/>to an octave, for example, with both voices moving by neutral seconds.<br/>The portion of your article headed &quot;Starting at the End&quot; (pp. 71-72<br/>in the XH18 numbering) is a fine introduction to this concept which<br/>also captures the excitement of those first weeks of our dialogue.<br/>There&apos;s more from both of us in my article -- when it gets online.</p><p>By the way, apart from advocating neomedieval or other styles in 17,<br/>or in other tuning systems for ratios of 2-3-7-9-11-13, I&apos;d see our<br/>articles as a brief for unequal temperaments, with 17-WT as a shining<br/>example of what creative temperament can do for a circulating system.</p><p>[On my statement about 17 as the smallest circulating system for<br/>&quot;neutral thirds and sixths&quot;]</p><p>&gt; What about 7-EDO?  I think you meant to say that it&apos;s the smallest<br/>&gt; division of the octave, having a 5th that&apos;s not excessively<br/>&gt; tempered, that can also represent the neutral 3rds and 6ths<br/>&gt; adequately.</p><p>Of course. Maybe I could say, &quot;the smallest division of the octave<br/>making available a regular diatonic tuning with a full complement of<br/>major, minor, and neutral intervals&quot; -- or, some might prefer,<br/>subminor and supermajor.</p><p>On my curious proposal for a circulating 29-tone system, I agree for the<br/>reasons you eloquently state that this or similar schemes should be<br/>clearly distinguished from the HTT family -- how about CT-29, simply<br/>&quot;Circulating Temperament&quot;?</p><p>Since this is MMM, I&apos;ll offer two brief comments. The first is that indeed<br/>it should be emphasized that in HTT-29 -- or Peppermint 24, for that<br/>matter -- the kind of &quot;semi-Wolf&quot; fifth or fourth we&apos;re discussing is a<br/>feature of the temperament rather than a &quot;flaw.&quot; In Peppermint, G#-Eb* or<br/>G/||\-E(!) is around 11.7 cents wide, and can be useful as a kind of<br/>&quot;semi-resolution&quot; to a progression.</p><p>However, all the discussion about circulating temperaments has caused me<br/>to consider the matter and conclude that some kind of CT-29 might be an<br/>ideal solution for certain musical concerns -- the regular HTT-29 fifths<br/>in my HTT-24 variation have me convinced with this, along with other<br/>features of 29. Thus rather than simply trying a crude kludge of HTT-29<br/>to make it more fully circulating, I might better try... a more original<br/>and possibly sophisticated kludge, so to speak, reflecting some<br/>consideration of my specific musical objectives, so that at least the<br/>process may be a bit more complex than &quot;George designs the tuning, and I<br/>do the damage&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Seriously, let me conclude with the hope that our articles will be<br/>understood as not merely advocating a given variety of tuning system, but<br/>rather as expressing a certain aesthetic stance that can apply to various<br/>tunings and styles. The passage headed &quot;The Resolution of the Problem of<br/>the Resolution&quot; in your article, pp. 73-75 in the XH pagination, is a<br/>beauttiful example.</p><p>Peace and love, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=14967 href="#14967">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2006 12:59:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

My reasoning is that if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re looking at 17, you must think 34 is too big because you get<br/>the<br/>&gt; same things with better harmony.  And if you don&apos;t want 34, 31 is<br/>&gt; probably too big as well.  And once 31 gets excluded it&apos;s a bit<br/>silly<br/>&gt; to let 29 get in there.</p><p>Thanks for your message, Graham, but I think that you might have<br/>saved yourself some time &amp; effort if you had read the entire paper<br/>before replying.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t thinking that 31 or 34 are too big, or trying to figure out<br/>what division will do such-and-such the best.  I take the reverse<br/>approach by *starting* with 17 and then trying to figure out what to<br/>do with it.  I observe that 17 has good 5ths and semitones with a<br/>very nice melodic effect, but it&apos;s a challenge to figure out how to<br/>get some decent harmony out of it.  In the paper I explain that this<br/>can be accomplished more effectively using a *well-temperament*<br/>rather than the ET.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Any talk about the methodology should go to tuning-math and I&apos;ll try<br/>&gt; to get a post together there.</p><p>Okay, I&apos;ll watch for it.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=15022 href="#15022">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
