I brought him a few lattices to look at. Afterwards, I sent him the link above. Here are his comments:</p><p>&quot;I had a great time last night.  It was great to finally meet you in person<br/>after so many years of email correspondence.  Our conversation really pushed<br/>my concepts of tuning, consonance, and scale and instrument design into a<br/>new dimension (literally, not in the trite sense).  I wonder what kind of<br/>possibilities for instrument design there are for incorporating the<br/>3-dimensional lattice you showed me last night?</p><p>StereoDekany rocks!  This is quite possibly the most enthusiastic I&apos;ve ever<br/>felt about a piece of computer music.

Taking the<br/>builder/composer route is a lonely one and at times encouragement is<br/>needed. The lists are so vital in providing this. But sometimes it would<br/>be so much simpler to sit down and write a nice movement for strings.<br/>You have to do so much that most composers wouldn&apos;t dream of doing. The<br/>reward is that you feel much more the artist, up to your neck in the raw<br/>material, certainly more dynamic, and, dare I say it, totally in<br/>control. (large grin). You earn the right to wear strange hats. And with<br/>patience and enthusiasm you attract the right people eventually. The<br/>downside is that every time a new notational system comes along it&apos;s<br/>like watching the wheel being reinvented before the goods have been got<br/>off to market!</p><p>Last weekend I exhibited and demonstrated some of my instruments. It was<br/>most gratifying to answer questions from teenagers from the rock<br/>rehearsals, from music teachers, jazz sax players, traditional fiddle<br/>tutors, arts project funders and a local politician trying to fight cuts<br/>in education budgets. There was even a film crew recording the<br/>proceedings. The whole place stopped still when I played a few long<br/>mournful tones on one of the psalteries. Nobody has ever heard this<br/>timbre before. As a result of the genuine interest we&apos;re looking into a<br/>setting up a course in instrument building, from mainly trash and found<br/>materials, for youngsters from socially deprived backgrounds. Scotland<br/>has nothing like this anywhere.</p><p>And I&apos;m having dinner soon with one of our best traditional fiddlers<br/>(his brother, fiddler Alistair Fraser, has a band called Skyedance and<br/>lives in California) who is interested in my project. He teaches at the<br/>Royal Academy in Glasgow, has a posse of young players at his disposal<br/>and so  another door opens. He could also come in most useful for the<br/>bowed psaltery parts.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like the laws of thermodynamics. You put in some energy and<br/>it all comes back out somehow.</p><p>At the moment I divide my time between Blackjack and 22 tet. Although I<br/>appreciate the theoretical efforts that others have put in to finding<br/>harmonic structures in Blackjack there&apos;s no substitute for listening.<br/>I&apos;m working with two hexanies &quot;joined at the hip&quot; with a G-D fifth. It&apos;s<br/>taken me many hours of listening to sort out the musically useful (to my<br/>ears) cadences between the various triads of these hexanies. Then within<br/>the restrictions of the ranges of my instruments I have to find the best<br/>voicings and voice leading. Harmony, counterpoint and orchestration all<br/>from scratch. I hope to post sometime with details of my findings. All<br/>this before the task of finding gullible musicians with a taste for the<br/>bizarre.</p><p>So, enough of me - thanks to everyone for the inspiration to continue<br/>ploughing this lonely furrow.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3><a id=1950 href="#1950">ðŸ”—</a>Dominique Larr&#xE9; &#x3C;Dominique.Larre@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2002 3:42:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Message d&apos;origine -----<br/>De : Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@...&gt;<br/>&lt;. . . . . . .&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting thread and one close to my heart.

Daunting and exciting, all at the same time!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been doing a lot of Partch research for this weekend, and<br/>going<br/>&gt; &gt; over a<br/>&gt; &gt; lot of Harry&apos;s unpublished writings and talking/interviews.<br/>&gt; &gt; Hair-raising,<br/>&gt; &gt; and also gives one hope for the ability, as you are showing, to<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; give up<br/>&gt; &gt; the cause.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; &gt; Jon<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting thread and one close to my heart. Taking the<br/>&gt; builder/composer route is a lonely one and at times encouragement is<br/>&gt; needed. The lists are so vital in providing this. But sometimes it<br/>would<br/>&gt; be so much simpler to sit down and write a nice movement for<br/>strings.<br/>&gt; You have to do so much that most composers wouldn&apos;t dream of doing.<br/>The<br/>&gt; reward is that you feel much more the artist, up to your neck in the<br/>raw<br/>&gt; material, certainly more dynamic, and, dare I say it, totally in<br/>&gt; control. (large grin). You earn the right to wear strange hats. And<br/>with<br/>&gt; patience and enthusiasm you attract the right people eventually. The<br/>&gt; downside is that every time a new notational system comes along it&apos;s<br/>&gt; like watching the wheel being reinvented before the goods have been<br/>got<br/>&gt; off to market!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last weekend I exhibited and demonstrated some of my instruments. It<br/>was<br/>&gt; most gratifying to answer questions from teenagers from the rock<br/>&gt; rehearsals, from music teachers, jazz sax players, traditional<br/>fiddle<br/>&gt; tutors, arts project funders and a local politician trying to fight<br/>cuts<br/>&gt; in education budgets. There was even a film crew recording the<br/>&gt; proceedings. The whole place stopped still when I played a few long<br/>&gt; mournful tones on one of the psalteries. Nobody has ever heard this<br/>&gt; timbre before. As a result of the genuine interest we&apos;re looking<br/>into a<br/>&gt; setting up a course in instrument building, from mainly trash and<br/>found<br/>&gt; materials, for youngsters from socially deprived backgrounds.<br/>Scotland<br/>&gt; has nothing like this anywhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;m having dinner soon with one of our best traditional fiddlers<br/>&gt; (his brother, fiddler Alistair Fraser, has a band called Skyedance<br/>and<br/>&gt; lives in California) who is interested in my project. He teaches at<br/>the<br/>&gt; Royal Academy in Glasgow, has a posse of young players at his<br/>disposal<br/>&gt; and so  another door opens. He could also come in most useful for<br/>the<br/>&gt; bowed psaltery parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a bit like the laws of thermodynamics. You put in some energy<br/>and<br/>&gt; it all comes back out somehow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the moment I divide my time between Blackjack and 22 tet.<br/>Although I<br/>&gt; appreciate the theoretical efforts that others have put in to<br/>finding<br/>&gt; harmonic structures in Blackjack there&apos;s no substitute for<br/>listening.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m working with two hexanies &quot;joined at the hip&quot; with a G-D fifth.<br/>It&apos;s<br/>&gt; taken me many hours of listening to sort out the musically useful<br/>(to my<br/>&gt; ears) cadences between the various triads of these hexanies. Then<br/>within<br/>&gt; the restrictions of the ranges of my instruments I have to find the<br/>best<br/>&gt; voicings and voice leading. Harmony, counterpoint and orchestration<br/>all<br/>&gt; from scratch. I hope to post sometime with details of my findings.<br/>All<br/>&gt; this before the task of finding gullible musicians with a taste for<br/>the<br/>&gt; bizarre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, enough of me - thanks to everyone for the inspiration to<br/>continue<br/>&gt; ploughing this lonely furrow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kind Regards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
