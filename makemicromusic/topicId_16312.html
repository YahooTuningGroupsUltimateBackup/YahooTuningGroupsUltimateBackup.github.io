I don&apos;t think they<br/>have any special microtuning piano rolls.  Maybe you can use Tonescape,<br/>if your video card supports &apos;vertex shaders&apos;.</p><p>Joe</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;saumsia&quot; &lt;saumsia@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good day.

So if you have unevenly-spaced intervals<br/>in your tuning, you will have unevenly-sized bars in<br/>your &quot;piano-roll&quot;. Also, if you use an equivalence-interval<br/>(typically the &quot;octave&quot;), then the &quot;piano-roll&quot; will have<br/>however many steps your tuning has in that interval.</p><p>Tonescape supports just-intonation in up to 7 dimensions<br/>(for example, you could use 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19<br/>as your generators, along with 2 as the equivalence-interval),<br/>it lets you use non-prime generators if that&apos;s what you want,<br/>it lets you temper a just-intonation tonespace in any way<br/>you want (to create, say, a &quot;linear temperament&quot; such as a<br/>fraction-of-a-comma meantone), and it supports equal-temperaments<br/>from 5 to 799 tones per octave. 53-edo is totally supported.</p><p>Yes, the vertex shaders are only needed for the Lattice View,<br/>which in fact is the main feature of Tonescape&apos;s user interface.<br/>However, if your video card does not support vertex shaders,<br/>Tonescape is supposed to use software emulation of them.<br/>There apparently are a few problems with this, as some<br/>people who have attempted to install or use Tonescape have<br/>run into trouble with it, and we&apos;re working on fixing that.<br/>Basically, if you have are using Windows XP for your<br/>operating system and you have a fairly recent and decent<br/>video-card, it should work OK.</p><p>Please note that you should install all the Windows updates<br/>that you can before installing Tonescape. Also note that<br/>in some cases, when it doesn&apos;t work at first, it will work<br/>later -- i had a little bit of trouble getting it to work<br/>correctly on my XP system, but since fixing something with<br/>my system&apos;s audio software (now i don&apos;t remember what it was),<br/>it has been running fine ever since, with only one minor<br/>bug concerning the Lattice View which pops infrequently.</p><p>The current &quot;Den Haag&quot; version of Tonescape does not seem<br/>to run under Windows 2000, altho older versions did.<br/>We have not yet tested it on Vista.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=16332 href="#16332">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2007 7:43:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;saumsia&quot; &lt;saumsia@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I mostly work in the piano roll view in a Sequencer.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The part of Tonescape you&apos;d be interested in is called<br/>&gt; &quot;Pitch-Height View&quot;, and yes, it is like &quot;piano-roll&quot;<br/>&gt; except that the look of it mirrors the intervallic structure<br/>&gt; of your tuning.
