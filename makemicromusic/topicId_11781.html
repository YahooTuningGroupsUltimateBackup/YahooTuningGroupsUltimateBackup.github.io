Here are some audio and score<br/>&gt; &gt; files, the later in PostScript, PDF, and abc notation formats:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Margo and thanks, this is very interesting. Three questions for you:<br/>&gt; where is the Hoyle Carpenter publication about the fifthtones? Where does<br/>&gt; Morley talk about the diesis notation (surely not in A Plaine and Easie<br/>&gt; Introduction...)? And, about the tuning: why are some of the G-D fifths<br/>&gt; noticeably more impure than other fifths?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dear Jon,</p><p>Please let me explain that I saw your message only after returning from<br/>holidays in Los Angeles, but will attempt a brief reply, since the<br/>questions are most interesting.</p><p>In one tuning bibliography, the Carpenter article is cited only as a<br/>manuscript. Johnny Reinhard may have the publication information; I seem<br/>to recall a publication called something like _Acta Musicologica_, and<br/>have tried to locate the article in one university library collection of<br/>that periodical, but so far without success (possibly the issue isn&apos;t in<br/>their collection).</p><p>The explanation by Morley on the diesis and the enharmonic genus indeed<br/>appears in _A Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music_, in the<br/>Annotations to the First Part (the section on the basics of solmisation<br/>and rhythm, etc., which precedes the treatment of counterpoint or discant<br/>and composition), p. 102 in the Alec Harman edition in paperback published<br/>by Norton in 1973. That&apos;s ISBN 0-393-00682-4.</p><p>As for the beating of some G-D fifths, possible hypotheses would include<br/>a coding error by me when I wrote the ASCII score file for processing by<br/>Aaron Johnson&apos;s et_compose. The notation I used is 1200000-et (thousands<br/>of cents as units), so 696578 would be G in a given octave, and 193157<br/>would be D. Here&apos;s a link to this source code:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.etc">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.etc</a>&gt;</p><p>Other hypotheses might focus on software (including soundfont) issues in<br/>translating this source file into a MIDI file, and from there through<br/>Timidity into an mp3 or ogg file. My guess would be that the MIDI file<br/>produced by Aaron&apos;s software is accurate, and that soundfont factors could<br/>produce the beat rates you query. Again, a first guess -- but one<br/>suggested to me by some other technical discussions.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
