I meet all your criteria for being non-spam, but get it back in my face. You should probably take a closer look at your spam filter setup; if my very benign post bounced, you might not be receiving other benign mail, probably of a more important nature than mine (and the other list members).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>I think I fixed this---if not, let me know....sorry for the inconvenience to all. I&apos;m fighting a huge take no prisoners war on spam, which is one of the greatest annoyances ever devised by any human.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div>
