I like the plain and direct nature of your vocal, as well, and I think your &apos;setting&apos; only needs a little tweaking. These kind of tunings always seem very emotional to me.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 7:37:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chris Bryan&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/7w6rz">http://tinyurl.com/7w6rz</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a setting of Psalm 42.

Yes, the accompaniment is all sines, although I&apos;m<br/>contemplating  adding some harmonics to the tones... maybe something<br/>resembling western overtone singing.</p><p>&gt; What hardware/software does it use? I want to perform it!</p><p>Well, that would be awesome!  The only thing you need is pd, which is<br/>free and runs on practically any OS.  I can easily e-mail you the<br/>environment and the harp samples.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s very<br/>computationally expensive... I&apos;m running it on a 2.4 Sempron with no<br/>problems.  You would also either need a midi controller or software to<br/>make midi from your qwerty (&quot;vkeybd&quot; is my choice).  You could either<br/>learn the melody by ear, or I could e-mail you a score.</p><p>Where were you thinking of performing it?  I&apos;m so excited!</p><p>Also, what&apos;s your story?  Are you writing, performing?  I don&apos;t think<br/>you&apos;ve posted much here...</p><p>You should probably respond off-list, my e-mail is melandchris@...</p><p>-Chris</p></div>
