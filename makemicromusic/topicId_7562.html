How do you rate it as a potential<br/>for playing a virtual instrument?</p><p>I&apos;ve been looking for a way to play a virtual instrument - just a 2D<br/>instrument on the screen, but to let one play it with polyphony<br/>and velocity sensitive - say a rectangular keyboard of square<br/>cells or whatever.</p><p>One idea is to ask the user to calibrate it roughly by touching opposite<br/>corners of the board before they start to play.</p><p>Then the program could faintly display the position of all their finger<br/>tips as they move them over the board,  whenever they are closer<br/>than a certain distance, show them more boldly as they get<br/>closer - sort of like a shadow - then when they touch the<br/>screen to within some minimum distance, depending on the resolution<br/>of the glove, it would play the note, with the volume of the note<br/>depending on the speed with which the finger hit the note.</p><p>So, the 3D part of it would be exploited to show the fingers<br/>&quot;shadows&quot; and to make the virtual instrument velocity sensitive,<br/>or indeed if one has time varying distance data, one<br/>could surely make it acceleration sensitive too<br/>or maybe to detect further finger movements after the ntoe<br/>is already pressed down  (e.g. to vibrate the fingers<br/>sideways with the note held down to vary the amplitude<br/>or pitch or to apply polyphonic aftertouch<br/>or something).</p><p>Any thoughts about whether it might be suitable for<br/>something like this. (If so I&apos;ll put it in my<br/>enormously long list of things I&apos;d like to program<br/>some day - but if it seems like it would be<br/>not to hard to program and that it would<br/>also work reasonably well it would move towards<br/>the head of the list as it could be so useful<br/>to have!).</p><p>After all once you are able to make the design<br/>completely virutal like tat you are free<br/>to explore any kind of layout you like.<br/>Even explore ideas for physical instruments<br/>and tuning of them prior to making them<br/>too perhaps for those who are into building<br/>instruments.</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;...recently bought a Essential Reality P5  glove,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;<a href="http://www.essentialreality.com/p5_glove.asp">http://www.essentialreality.com/p5_glove.asp</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  awesome!   ...free SDK too!  ..doesn&apos;t get much better   than that.<br/>&gt; &gt;Thx for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the link.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yo...  <a href="http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=P5">http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=P5</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;$12.50!

It&apos;s a bit of a pain to get it to do what you want musically,<br/>&gt; &gt;but I  found Nicholas Fournel&apos;s MIDI controller app to be  pretty<br/>&gt; &gt;interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Already got it at <a href="http://Overstock.com">Overstock.com</a> for twice as much [oh well].  Still a  great<br/>&gt; deal compared with orig retail of $99.

Check out &quot;absolute mode&quot; on the P5 group.  That&apos;s<br/>what will need to be used.  Don&apos;t use the Essential Reality SDK for<br/>absolute mode, though.  It says it works in the SDK docs but it<br/>really doesn&apos;t.  Only relative mode works (similar to mouse input).</p><p>As I&apos;m thinking more on this, you probably wouldn&apos;t want to limit it<br/>to just a single flat surface.  You could stack virtual surfaces and<br/>just play in the air since it&apos;s all on screen.  That would be cool!</p><p>As far as languages go, I use C++ due to it&apos;s massive use in the SDKs<br/>I&apos;m linked to.  I like the purity of C but love the reusability /<br/>encapsulation of C++!  It fits my programming style really well, too,<br/>but that might be because it&apos;s what I&apos;ve groaned used to.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Andy F.</p></div>
