The effect can be one of a &quot;misty&quot; and<br/>impressionistic consonance, or of tense dissonance; the timbre I&apos;m<br/>using leans toward the first kind of effect.</p><p>Anyway, as you suggest, we Phi-lovers may form a special category in<br/>the xenharmonic community. Two of my favorite 24-note tunings based on<br/>Pythagorean have intervals quite close to Phi, and the 13-tET<br/>approximation of 9/13 octave is very close to a JI ratio of 21:13.<br/>At least in a reasonably gentle timbre, Phi has a kind of mysterious<br/>or foggy kind of relative concord -- a bit Debussyan, I might say.</p><p>Now for your MIDI question, to which my answer might seem a bit<br/>&quot;medievalistic,&quot; especially for someone like you who&apos;s doing<br/>state-of-the-art audio production:</p><p>&gt; Also thank you for diagramming out how you are using two keyboards.<br/>&gt; Do you play them together, or sequence them separately and then<br/>&gt; combine into one file?</p><p>Here I should explain that I have the two keyboards connected to the<br/>synthesizer through a &quot;MIDI merger&quot; box, and typically play them<br/>together, much like a conventional two-manual organ. However, they<br/>aren&apos;t connected to any device or interface for recording or playing<br/>MIDI files.</p><p>Your question suggests to me that there might be different approaches<br/>for recording MIDI files using two or more keyboards, each with its<br/>own advantages, and this could be a really interesting topic.</p><p>For example, I&apos;ve heard about a 72-tET setup with six 12-note<br/>keyboards for the complete tuning, and I&apos;m not sure if people have<br/>recorded MIDI files with this type of arrangement.</p><p>Maybe I should explain how I go about composing something and sharing<br/>a MIDI file of it here.</p><p>First, typically, I try ideas out at the keyboard, come up with<br/>something I like, and write it down in some notation -- basically,<br/>maybe not too different from composing at a traditional organ or<br/>harpsichord.</p><p>Then, at the computer keyboard, I use a text editor to write a Scala<br/>MIDI example file with instructions defining the tuning to use, the<br/>notes and durations in each part, and the General MIDI timbre. It&apos;s<br/>rather like programming in some very user-friendly computer language.<br/>Then I use Scala to translate this text file into a MIDI file with<br/>pitchbend messages for the given tuning.</p><p>One of the problems of this approach for something like 13-tET is that<br/>the effects are very highly timbre-sensitive. A piece using the<br/>interval of 8/13 octave or about 738 cents as a consonant fifth in the<br/>right synthesizer timbre might sound quite &quot;strange&quot; in a typical<br/>General MIDI timbre.</p><p>Recently the tuning/timbre equation has been a big theme in TMA, and<br/>I&apos;m really impressed with the possibilities here, not least in your<br/>music.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
