What&apos;s easy to do in MAX/MSP,  is to create a continuous sound that you can then vary in real time with all sorts of controllers and interfaces.</p><p>You can do the latter in Csound, . . .but again, it&apos;s tricky.</p><p>These are generalizations, of course, (and I&apos;ve done a lot of note-based stuff in MAX/MSP lately) but,  perhaps it&apos;s not so useful to make a statement like &quot;you can do anything with _________&quot;.  It&apos;s pretty much true of any software tool these days.  I could probably write symphonies with FileMaker Pro , given a few plugins.</p><p>More interesting is to talk about what&apos;s best facilitated by certain software packages, the &quot;paradigm suggestion&quot; that is embedded in them.</p><p>Of course,  some of the most interesting music comes from people using software (or hardware) in ways that &lt;aren&apos;t&gt; immediately obvious.</p><p>C</p></div><h3>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2006 1:31:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I could probably write symphonies<br/>&gt; with FileMaker Pro , given a few plugins.</p><p>LOL!</p><p>-chris</p></div>
