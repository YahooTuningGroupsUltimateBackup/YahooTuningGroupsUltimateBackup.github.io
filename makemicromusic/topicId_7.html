It uses a scale of 12 notes derived from the &quot;hexany,&quot; an<br/>arithmetic process to create pitches. The pitches for this piece, in<br/>ratios are: 1/1, 35/32, 9/8, 5/4, 21/16, 45/32, 3/2, 105/64, 27/16,<br/>7/4, 15/8, 63/32, 2/1. This piece was premiered in Moscow with Vera<br/>Gubenkova, viola. This recording was in the electronic music studio<br/>of the famous Moscow Conservatory. Score and parts available through<br/>Composers Concordance.

Each fret on<br/>each string can be placed SEPARATELY anywhere on the instrument! Wim<br/>Hoogewerf designed the particular tuning system for this piece, which<br/>is in his own &quot;flavor&quot; of just intonation...</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/1049/1049481.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/1049/1049481.html</a></p><p>(1987) This is a piece for solo French horn in just intonation. It&apos;s<br/>pretty easy to write in just intonation for horn... all the pitches<br/>are easily there, the performer just has to be willing to play them!<br/>Here the piece is performed superbly by virtuoso performer Francis<br/>Orval, who was also independently interested in just intonation.<br/>Score available through music dealers or Seesaw Music Corp., 2067<br/>Broadway, NYC 10023.

It was<br/>my first attempt in writing in this alternate tuning at the<br/>suggestion of Francis Orval, who was very interested in it. He<br/>performs here with his wife Ruby. The Orval&apos;s took this piece on a<br/>tour of Western states in 1987. Although not as involved or<br/>accomplished as my HARMONIC ETUDE for SOLO horn in Just Intonation,<br/>written subsequently, it certainly does feature the harmonic series.<br/>It was also the first piece of mine to be picked up as<br/>a &quot;circulating&quot; score by the New York Public Library. There are now<br/>also several others. Score available at music dealers or through<br/>Seesaw Music Corp., 2067 Broadway, NYC 10023 (212) 874-1200.</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/590/590557.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/590/590557.html</a></p><p>NOW ON TO THE COMMENTARY:</p><p>I have to confess that one of the problems I have with people&apos;s<br/>responses to my music is that they are too exceedingly &quot;polite.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t learning anything that way.  Everybody nods their heads, yes,<br/>yes, yes, like the end of Ulysses... and no feelings are hurt.</p><p>But, my music doesn&apos;t get any better that way.</p><p>As a contrary example... a friend of mine recently commented on one<br/>of my electronic works: &quot;You know, you should really try to stay away<br/>from that cheesy MIDI clarinet....&quot;</p><p>Frankly, when I wrote the piece, I wasn&apos;t thinking of that sound *at<br/>all* as being a clarinet... It was just an electronic sound that I<br/>happened to be using.  Since it really didn&apos;t *sound* like a real<br/>clarinet, I wasn&apos;t thinking of it that way.</p><p>HOWEVER, it is *more* than possible that other people would think of<br/>it in that way... and so, for that reason, after this honest and<br/>critical evaluation of my friend, I have endeavored to stay away from<br/>MIDI sounds that emulate *any* &quot;real&quot; instruments, whenever possible.</p><p>On another topic... I am quite well aware that my equipment is<br/>limited.  For that reason, I am perfectly aware that I don&apos;t use as<br/>much &quot;post sequencing&quot; processing as somebody like the MIDI-master<br/>Jacky Ligon.  However, I hope, to a certain extent, my music is<br/>strong enough to override the equipment limitations.</p><p>I *am* aware of those, however.  People are welcome to comment on<br/>*that* aspect but, in short, there&apos;s not a whole lot I can do about<br/>that at this point... however, I have been learning SOUND FORGE which<br/>may be a software solution that will help a bit.</p><p>At a recent American Composers Forum meeting I asked for explicitly<br/>candid criticism.  Several of the people there had only limited<br/>experience or interest in microtonal music.  However, I got some good<br/>commentary.  There was an &quot;old fogey&quot; who could only say &quot;I don&apos;t<br/>like it...&quot; and &quot;I don&apos;t like electronic sounds...&quot;  That wasn&apos;t too<br/>helpful, but otherwise the commentary was fruitful, even when<br/>negative.</p><p>So please, blast away.  I *welcome* negative feedback.</p><p>I mean, I will *accept* positive, too, if someone insists on it...</p><p>__________ _______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>David J.

(He was<br/>perhaps the most influential producer in the early days of country<br/>music - hundreds of gold and platinum records, classic hits up the<br/>wazoo.)  This was 1995.  I was recording demos for Michelle Tumes, who<br/>has a sort of Euro sound, in a studio he owned.  He happened by that<br/>day, took one listen and said, &quot;Are those them damn loops?&quot;  I said,<br/>&quot;Um..., no sir, it&apos;s mostly samples played with MIDI but all recorded<br/>in real time.&quot;  &quot;Hmph,&quot; he muttered, &quot;I hate them damn loops.&quot;<br/>Cheerful fellow.
