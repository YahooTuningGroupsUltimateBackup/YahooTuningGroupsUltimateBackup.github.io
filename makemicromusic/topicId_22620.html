Squires usually have great necks, and stay in tune well, good choice...cheap too, I always buy a good Squire when I see it. As far as what system...jeez, so many to choose from. I started with 19, but that was because John Starrett built it and gave it to me. I like chords that sound pretty well in tune, so that&apos;s a big factor for me as a composer...and 19 is similar to 12, but also very different in many ways. It&apos;s a good transitional tuning to get started with. I think you&apos;ll just have to trust your intuitions on the first one, especially if you&apos;ve never had one before. I like having a lot of choices in a tuning, so one with poor 5ths, for instance, might not work for me..but, would need to actually hear/play it first. And little frets are not an issue for me, cause I&apos;ve always practiced to have precise technique, so the 30&apos;s tunings (I have 31, 34, 36) are not a problem. Anyway, keep us posted...I also have a great luthier here in Denver, he&apos;s done my 36, 22, and fretless axes, he&apos;s got it together...best...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Hotmail has tools for the New Busy.

My other choice was<br/>to purchase a new Indiana guitar.<br/><a href="http://www.indianaguitar.com/index.php">http://www.indianaguitar.com/index.php</a></p><p>They are inexpensive but seem quality built. The price differential was $40<br/>(Indiana strats are $100 at a local store).</p><p>I don&apos;t think small frets - ala mandolin would bother me as well - since I<br/>do have a mandolin I occasionally play. However, the way I play is by<br/>mentally mapping the current set of notes I want to use visually as I play<br/>(I actually &quot;see&quot; the notes I want to hit). I&apos;m thinking too many frets will<br/>cause that to break down.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, Jun 9, 2010 at 12:02 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris, super cool what you&apos;re doing...I actually have 2 Squire refrets, a<br/>&gt; 36 tone and a 22 tone JI axe.
