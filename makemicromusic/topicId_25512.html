I think it&apos;s<br/>worthwhile to talk about circles of other intervals too.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;It&apos;s not about tuning error so much as complexity. If you&apos;re in 15-tet, there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;more to blackwood than just &quot;oh, the fifths are sharp.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, but again...I&apos;d stay away from things like trying to phrase<br/>&gt; everything in terms of fifths or anything that can&apos;t quickly be applied to<br/>&gt; something to musician could play. There&apos;s no emotional consensus to whether<br/>&gt; people, say, always like/hate sharp fifths or what the math means far as<br/>&gt; emotion...so a sound example comparing the fifth, fourth...in Blackwood vs.<br/>&gt; 12TET would likely give the composer a quick general overview of the feel of<br/>&gt; Blackwood in 15TET,</p><p>It doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the emotional impact of the fifths<br/>being sharp. Blackwood is set up so that if you modulate upward by<br/>five fifths, as in C-G-D-A-E-B, the fifths are all stretched out so<br/>that the B at the end is actually tempered to be equivalent to a C<br/>again. That&apos;s the whole point of blackwood, and it is an awesome<br/>musical feature! I wouldn&apos;t talk about Blackwood without mentioning<br/>this.</p><p>Or, if you&apos;re having trouble imagining this, it means that 256/243<br/>vanishes, which means we&apos;re in 5-equal. Then you create a second<br/>5-equal chain that&apos;s a 5/4 away, so now you end up with this<br/>&quot;symmetrical&quot; diatonic-sounding scale in which there are major triads<br/>everywhere and you can always modulate by fifth.</p><p>Put another way, if you move by fifth to C-G-D-A-E - that E on top is<br/>now, actually, an F, in the sense that it&apos;s a 4/3 up from the root (in<br/>an octave-equivalent sense). And that C-A is now closer to a 7/4.</p><p>That&apos;s important to know! If you don&apos;t exploit that feature every<br/>chance you can get then you&apos;re missing out on the whole point of<br/>blackwood.</p><p>&gt; But, if anything, I&apos;d first try to focus on the chords in Blackwood and<br/>&gt; their closest 12TET equivalents even...rather then go directly into a fair<br/>&gt; amount of detail about how each of the dyads compares. At &quot;worst&quot; I&apos;d say<br/>&gt; things like &quot;x dyad is between a 6th and 7th and can function as either....and<br/>&gt; preferably give a sound sample of the 6th, 7th, and the &quot;new&quot; neutral in between<br/>&gt; from 15TET as well.</p><p>Again, if you want to try and relate blackwood to the diatonic scale,<br/>the whole point of it is really that it&apos;s a symmetrical diatonic<br/>scale. You can keep stacking alternating major and minor thirds and<br/>construct these huge linked 5-limit harmonies without ever hitting a<br/>wall. I think that would be both more intuitive for new musicians to<br/>understand, and more musically relevant, than talking about dyadic<br/>error.

It&apos;s also a great way to evaluate scales.  The work of many people on the tuning list has given us ways to evaluate both the damage to the intervals we&apos;re targeting, and a measure of the complexity of the scales that result from different temperaments in terms of how many generators it takes to get to target intervals.  Complexity, as I&apos;ve recently come to understand, is also a measure of how many notes we need to have in a scale in order to achieve the target harmonies.  What this means is that, using these metrics, we can trim down the infinity of possible temperaments to the few that have the lowest damage and/or the lowest complexity.  This makes it VASTLY easier to explore the infinity of tunings, *presuming we know what kind of harmonies we want*.</p><p>So if we have a particular triad, tetrad, pentad, etc. that we want to have as many of as possible in our scale, and we want them as in-tune as possible, the temperament paradigm can tell us unequivocally what scale will yield the best results.  If that&apos;s not awesome and useful, I don&apos;t know what is.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MikeB&gt;&quot;In all honesty, Michael, and just as a suggestion, why not spend some<br/>&gt; time yourself delving into the math here?

This is called &quot;dynamic retuning&quot;, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can barely convey how happy this makes me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All you have to do is call up the sampler instrument in Logic (called the<br/>&gt; EXS24). This is a big collection of instruments, all ready to go -- or tweakable<br/>&gt; if you like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, you resave each EXS24 instrument under a new name, and save a copy of your<br/>&gt; scale that you created with LMSO with that instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One impressive thing about the result is that the EXS24 somehow seems to put the<br/>&gt; samples in approximately the same registers that they were in. If the original<br/>&gt; instrument was multisampled such that there were different samples for all the<br/>&gt; registers, somehow -- despite the radically different tuning -- the samples end<br/>&gt; up sounding &quot;right&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (This wasn&apos;t true of older sample-based sound-modules like the EMU Proteus<br/>&gt; series: If you specified a user tuning with substantially more pitches than 12<br/>&gt; per octave, the upper register tended to be too dull, and the lower register<br/>&gt; tended to be too bright, or buzzy. Which could be interesting, but was often<br/>&gt; just weird.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This means that you don&apos;t have to build up my library of sampled instruments<br/>&gt; completely from scratch, retuning each key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All that you have to do is make a &quot;band&quot; with EXS24 instruments with this slight<br/>&gt; modification -- or any other tweaks you desire.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This means, for me, that my more than ten years of practicing a 36-note per<br/>&gt; octave JI scale won&apos;t be wasted. I can use that scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It means that the power of Logic isn&apos;t wasted if you want to do microtonality<br/>&gt; &quot;your way&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, rich combinations of instruments somewhat make up for the inferiority*<br/>&gt; of electronic sounds. Achieving this richness is much, much easier, now that I<br/>&gt; understand this technique.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What a difference a day makes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, one plug for Jeff at LMSO goat barn. He&apos;s been very helpful and clear. The<br/>&gt; manual that comes with LMSO is also very clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Caleb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *debatable, but *you* know what I mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________<br/>&gt; From: Caleb Morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Sent: Wed, February 9, 2011 12:49:57 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [MMM] Komplete (7) Any users?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey Caleb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before you go buyin&apos; a whole &apos;nother system like Komplete, try following the<br/>&gt; instructions given with Lil&apos; Miss Scale Oven for retuning the EX24 sampler<br/>&gt; instruments in Logic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It works, and solves the &quot;12-pitches-only&quot; problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t figured out yet how to implement something like a keymap, but I just<br/>&gt; followed the instructions and set up a (43-note) tuning on an instrument of<br/>&gt; mine. Quite easy, once you figure out where things are in your folders.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any EX24 instrument, any arbitrary tuning. Easy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I might have just saved you $600.
