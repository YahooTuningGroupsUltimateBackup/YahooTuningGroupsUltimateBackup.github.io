I&apos;ve been playing around with the Z1 I&apos;ve borrowed<br/>and you can sort of get things by:</p><p>1. altering the oscillator slopes to a value of less than 1 (multiply the<br/>slope by 100 to get cent increments between adjacent keys)<br/>2  setting up a full range pb scale to correct the errors, which if you set<br/>the centre of the oscillator slopes correctly never goes too far astray for<br/>19 and 31, and possibly 53 (latter 2 not tried - 19&apos;s quite close even<br/>without fiddling about)</p><p>It&apos;s a pest to set up.</p><p>Also looked into multitimbres and you can have six voices only, so you can<br/>fudge it (harmonic partial sequences) by setting the lower osc to a bigger<br/>slope than the upper, and adjusting the pitchbends on the generalised scale<br/>to reasonably right values.</p><p>Also a big pest to set up.</p><p>Are there any other Z1 users out there? I&apos;ve not used the mac Z1 editor<br/>/yet/, anyone with experience of this. Easier than front panel work.</p><p>But the instrument&apos;s sounds as a whole are amazing - and weird. Barely<br/>scratched the surface of all the other (non micro) stuff. Noticed that there<br/>is something that can make the pitch bend move up/down harmonic series. Will<br/>report when read and undestood.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=4340 href="#4340">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Gould &#x3C;mark.gould@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2003 1:13:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for spotting that one.

One modulation source is the keyboard notes.<br/>&gt; You could use this as a &quot;rough&quot; tuning of notes per octave for the<br/>&gt; oscillators and filters, then use the full keyboard microtuning scale to<br/>&gt; add the appropriate offsets.  This would only be useful if you always<br/>&gt; used the same number of notes per octave, otherwise you&apos;ll need a unique<br/>&gt; voice programmed per scale.</p></div><h3><a id=4341 href="#4341">ðŸ”—</a>John Loffink &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2003 1:23:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The web site is already fixed.

It isn&apos;t the keyboard that does the tuning.   The Korg Oasys PCI soundcard seems to have the same synthesis engine as the Z1.  It supports full keyboard tuning through text files and has come down a lot in price.</p><p>The user&apos;s guide is online, and here&apos;s the relevant quote:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>Tuning can be specified separately for each of the 128 MIDI notes. Each note must<br/>be on a separate line; blank lines are OK.<br/>Each re-tuned note needs to have at least three entries: the incoming MIDI note, the<br/>resulting pitch (a note name), and fine tuning (+/- 100 cents). Entries must be<br/>separated by either spaces or tabs. Anything after the fine tuning is ignored, so you<br/>can put comments at the ends of the lines.<br/>For instance, below is a valid entry, including a comment, which causes a MIDI<br/>note of D2 to be remapped to F3 (E3 plus 100 cents, a full half-step):<br/>d2 E3 +100 D2 becomes F3.<br/>There doesn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t need to be a line for every MIDI input note. If no re-tuning is<br/>specified, that note will simply be sent straight through to its normal pitch, A1 to<br/>A1, C#3 to C#3, etc. If you want to have an entry for every note, you can also just<br/>map input straight to output, as shown below:<br/>F4 F4 0 Also could simply not use an &iuml;&iquest;&half;F4&iuml;&iquest;&half; entry.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4344 href="#4344">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
