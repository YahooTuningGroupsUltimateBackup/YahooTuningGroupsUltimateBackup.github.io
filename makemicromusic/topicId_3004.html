These are<br/>extreme but very organic as well (as they&apos;re interactive and never<br/>predictably patternistic). The trick is to do it so as to create the<br/>illusion of say a car moving next to you at a stop light when you<br/>think it&apos;s standing still thereby disturbing your equilibrium while at<br/>the same time keeping the *rhythmic* phasing and related delay effects<br/>cool--i.e, not goofy!</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;ll put up a copy of the track I sent Jacky before he<br/>finished it somewhere to better show what I mean... or maybe I&apos;ll put<br/>up the Turntable Quartet which was partially composed to better study<br/>this phenomena.</p><p>Anyway, I used this a lot, but generally with other live instruments<br/>and a boatload of other stuff too, so it&apos;s often difficult to tell<br/>exactly what&apos;s going on (I know).</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Catharsis&quot; &lt;catharsis@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, May 19, 2002 11:41 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Wow, ok...</p><p>&gt; At 01:40 PM 5/19/2002 +0000, you wrote:<br/>&gt; Dan:<br/>&gt; &gt;Years later this mix turned<br/>&gt; &gt;up on an unlabeled cassette--at first I didn&apos;t know *who* it even<br/>was,<br/>&gt; &gt;it had been that long and was that much of a surprise!<br/>&gt; &gt;Anyway, the difficult thing for Jacky was that I gave him a nearly<br/>&gt; &gt;complete, dense tune with no hope of separating anything out, this<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt;a less than gracious way to work--and that&apos;s an understatement!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m on the digest, so I didn&apos;t see this before writing my previous<br/>post...<br/>&gt; This bit of info certainly does cast a new spin on critiquing the<br/>remix.
