It uses the same tuning tables as<br/>Angelina and the VAZ line of soft synths, so it has 1 cent tuning<br/>resolution across the entire MIDI range. And Scala can directly output<br/>tuning tables for it.</p><p>Rainbow is similar to the TX81Z, but with a bit more flexibility, since it<br/>doesn&apos;t have a &quot;fixed&quot; set of FM algorithms. Rainbow 3.0, the next<br/>version, is supposed to have 6 operator FM with the same envelope control<br/>as Angelina. This is getting to be pretty hot FM synthesis! Rumor has it<br/>that registered users of Rainbow 2.X will get a free upgrade to 3.0.</p><p>Check it out, if you haven&apos;t already, and catch the 2.5 update!</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=3364 href="#3364">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 1:03:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick,</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Holy Sine Waves, Batman!

Thanks for keeping us posted on this, I&apos;ve bookmarked the pages and will demo the apps and synths. Question: what are *you* using to drive the VST synths? I don&apos;t use any of the bigger sequencers (right now) that support the VST format, but I took a look at FruityLoops (and, yes, it does feel funny saying that) which appears to be reasonable. Let me know (or anyone else can chime in) if you have info/yeas/nays on FLoops.</p><p>These are all moderate cost apps, and I&apos;m willing to be with a decent host (FruityLoops), one or two soft synths with microtuning, and Scala, you could have an awful lot of people starting to explore outside of 12tET! What a cool thing it would be if some forward-looking music department could get a volume discount on a package of these apps (together) and setup, for nominal cost, a number of workstations for students to start working in microtonal composition.</p><p>Is that a light at the end of the tunnel, or is it the Xenon headlights of a new MiniCooper?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3366 href="#3366">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 8:41:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon S asked,</p><p>&gt; Question: what are *you* using to drive the VST synths?</p><p>Well, I bought both VAZ 2010 and VAZ Modular. VAZ Modular is only VST 1.0,<br/>so it can&apos;t use the VST instruments, only effects. But VAZ 2010 is a VST<br/>2.0 compatible host. You can &quot;insert&quot; a soft synth into an empty channel<br/>and drive it. If you go here:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.kvr-vst.com/index.php">http://www.kvr-vst.com/index.php</a></p><p>you can find a number of free and/or open-source hosts, like Psycle:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/portal.php">http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/portal.php</a></p><p>I haven&apos;t used Psycle, but the Rainbow author pointed it out. With Psycle<br/>(free) and Rainbow 2.5 ($60) you can have a pretty nice microtonal setup<br/>for under a hundred bucks.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
