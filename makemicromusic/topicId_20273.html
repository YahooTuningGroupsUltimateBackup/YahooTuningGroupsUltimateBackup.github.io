More information is<br/>here: <a href="http://www.rpmchallenge.com/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/">http://www.rpmchallenge.com/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/</a></p><p>The idea is simple: Start February 1, record ten songs, or 35 minutes<br/>of music, committed to a CD, and mail a copy to the organizers.<br/>Details are on their web site. A summary is posted below. I did it<br/>last year, and hope to get it done again this time. Make some music!</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a little like National Novel Writing Month, (<a href="http://NaNoWriMo.org">NaNoWriMo.org</a>)<br/>where writers challenge each other to write 1,700 words a day for 30<br/>days, or the great folks over at February Album Writing Month<br/>(<a href="http://fawm.org">fawm.org</a>), who encourage artists to write 14 new songs in February.<br/>Maybe they don&apos;t have &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot; at the end of<br/>the month, or maybe they doÂ—but that&apos;s not the point. The point is<br/>they get busy and stop waiting around for the muse to appear. Get the<br/>gears moving. Do something. You can&apos;t write 1,700 words a day and not<br/>get better.</p><p>Don&apos;t wait for inspiration - taking action puts you in a position to<br/>get inspired. You&apos;ll stumble across ideas you would have never come up<br/>with otherwise, and maybe only because you were trying to meet a day&apos;s<br/>quota of (song)writing. Show up and get something done, and invest in<br/>yourself and each other.</p><p>Anyone can come up with an excuse to say &quot;no,&quot; so don&apos;t. Many of you<br/>are thinking &quot;But, I can&apos;t do that! I don&apos;t have any songs/recording<br/>gear/money/blah blah blah...&quot; But this doesn&apos;t have to be the album,<br/>it&apos;s just an album. Remember, this is an artistic exercise. Just do<br/>your best using what you have in order to get it done. If you have a<br/>four-track, become a four-track badass! A mini disc, a pro-tools rig,<br/>a Walkman, an 80&apos;s tape recorder Â– use it. Do your best. Use the<br/>limitations of time and gear as an opportunity to explore things you<br/>might not try otherwise. If you can afford studio time in a &quot;real&quot;<br/>studio, fine, but let&apos;s be completely free of any lingering idea that<br/>&quot;good&quot; records can only be made in a studio. If that were so, then all<br/>the old scratchy blues records or Alan Lomax field recordings that<br/>have changed our culture Â– the world&apos;s culture Â– wouldn&apos;t still<br/>resonate with us today as they do. Springsteen&apos;s haunting classic<br/>&quot;Nebraska&quot; was a demo he did at home on a crappy machine. That album<br/>is fricking awesome. What label would put those recordings out now?<br/>(See: who cares) There are a million examples of this kind of stuff,<br/>but the fact will always be: Well written, honest music is compelling<br/>and undeniable no matter what it was recorded on. So put it to tape.</p><p>February will come and go whether you&apos;ve joined in or not, but do you<br/>really want to be left out?</p><p>To recap:</p><p>Â• This will be fun!</p><p>Â• Ten songs or 35 minutes of recorded material, on a CD, postmarked or<br/>hand-delivered by noon on March 1 to:</p><p>RPM HQ<br/>10 Vaughan Mall, Suite 1<br/>Portsmouth, NH 03801<br/>USA</p><p>Â• Recording can only be done in the month of February Â– no prerecorded<br/>songs.</p><p>Â• All material must be previously unreleased, and we encourage you to<br/>write the material during February too.</p><p>Â• Participating bands get their own page on the site, which you can<br/>blog to as much as you want. You also get access to the band-only<br/>discussion board, where you can swap ideas, resources, etc., and the<br/>ability to e-mail and private message with the other participants.</p><p>Â• All the completed albums may be put up in the jukebox on the<br/>website, if you so choose, so people can check it out; conversely, if<br/>you&apos;d rather not share your work with the public, then no one needs to<br/>hear it but us.</p><p>Write some instrumentals, split up the songwriting duties amongst band<br/>members, form an RPM side project, write songs on the piano or<br/>clarinet instead of your primary instrument, make that metal album<br/>you&apos;ve always wanted to - buy a ukulele! Just do your best to make the<br/>best album you can. Be unafraid.</p><p>What if every musician you knew put their music first for 28 days?</p><p>What if you recorded the best song of your life?</p><p>What if the world was never the same?</p><p>What&apos;s stopping us? Nothing. February is Record Production Month. You<br/>have no reason to say no, and nothing to lose.&quot;</p></div>
