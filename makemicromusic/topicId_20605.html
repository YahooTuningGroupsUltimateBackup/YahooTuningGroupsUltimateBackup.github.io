Very cool how -- despite the limitations imposed by the challenge -- your style and character comes through as clearly as any of your other works.  It&apos;s funny, the sine-based timbres sound kind of &quot;old fashioned&quot; to me (as in the earlier era of electronic music).  I was even reminded a bit of Raymond Scott!</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Prent Rodgers wrote:<br/>&gt; I like a good challenge, and Tobiah on the Csound mailing list posted one recently.

Nice.<br/>Thanks Prent.<br/>Milan</p></div>
