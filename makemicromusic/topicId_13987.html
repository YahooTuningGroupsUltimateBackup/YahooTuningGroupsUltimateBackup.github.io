Tricky!  It&apos;s much easier to start with a female voice because there&apos;s less information in low pitched sounds.  Also, there&apos;s more to the difference between male and female voices than pitch and formants.</p><p>&gt; I have a decent vocal range of about 2 1/2 octaves or so, depending on how &gt; warmed up I am (~e,, to ~b with falsetto), the very top of my falsetto &gt; however I wouldn&apos;t want to record because it will sound too thin and tight; &gt; it would be nice to artificially extend it with recording technology to 3 or &gt; even slightly more....</p><p>What you want, then, is to hold the formants constant when you change the pitch.  Don&apos;t worry about speeding up.  I know Kyma can do this, and I&apos;m sure Csound can, although maybe not in real time.  I can go through the documentation if you think that&apos;s a promising route.  I think analysis/resynthesis is what to search for.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14003 href="#14003">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2006 10:16:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Melodyne.  -C.</p><p>At 11:31 AM 7/7/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does anyone know how one would go about changing the formants of a recorded<br/>&gt;voice from male to female, so that when it is sped up, it won&apos;t sound like<br/>&gt;Alvin and the chipmunks?

There&apos;s an app called Composer&apos;s Desktop Project (CDP) which has spectral and pitch function suites which would do the specific job of dealing with formants in detail. Takes some time to get familiar but there is support.
