AFAIK Bartok proofed clearly Asian (Chinese) pentatonic character of old original Hungarian folk music. So in my opinion if there are really some maqam or Near East elements in Hungarian music (from my experience not so much) they came from Turkey (later import from Osman Empire - Hungary was hundreds years part of it), or from Gipsies (diatonic 7tone scales similar to Indian raga).</p><p>As for Uyghur it&apos;s similar. Maqam elements were probably imported into their music together with islam through Silk Road.</p><p>If we do thorough analysis we can find maqam elements even more to the north in Europe, in Slovakian, Moravian and even Polish folk music (try Chopin&apos;s Mazurka op.7/1, bars 46-52 centered on Gb, it&apos;s surprising!). Again - late influence of Hungarian, Gipsy or Jewish music.</p><p>So easy it is.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 1 Jan 2011, at 3:50 AM, Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Guitarist Sandor Szabo is doing some interesting work, &gt; researching Hungarian maqam music...www.hunmaqam.hu   It&apos;s &gt; something I had not heard of before, you might wanna check it &gt; out...best...Hstick</p></div>
