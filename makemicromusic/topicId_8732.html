Of course, the nice thing is that one<br/>can admire the whole Perotin-Ciconia era, and that&apos;s my own stance,<br/>with it serving as a kind of &quot;classic&quot; foundation for my own music.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d appreciate suggestions as to historically appropriate tuning(s)<br/>&gt; for these, including the Willaert.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I give some quick answers here on a generic period basis,<br/>and say more about specific pieces in the post I&apos;ve promised above?<br/>(Right now I&apos;m wearing very effective foam earplugs as a precaution<br/>after a minor audio mishap earlier in the week, not ideal for even<br/>frequency response in listening to music.)</p><p>For Continental European music of around 1200-1410, or<br/>Perotin-Ciconia, and including the Ars Subtilior as the latest part of<br/>this period, I&apos;d generally recommend a regular Pythagorean tuning with<br/>as many notes per octave as are required to play all accidentals as<br/>written, for example Eb-G#. Sometimes a different 12-note range might<br/>be required (e.g. Ab-C#), or more than 12 notes per octave (e.g. Gb-G#<br/>for Solage&apos;s _Fumeux fume_).</p><p>On the TX802, the preset microtuning table P05 (Pythagorean) with a<br/>&quot;tuning key&quot; of C gives Eb-G#; a &quot;key&quot; of F gives Ab-C#, for example.<br/>For the Solage piece I mentioned, I&apos;d use P05 with a &quot;key&quot; of Eb for<br/>the lower manual (Gb-B) and a &quot;key&quot; of C for the upper manual (Eb-G#),<br/>thus getting the requisite 15-note range.</p><p>For music of the period 1420-1450, and somewhat earlier in certain<br/>parts of Italy, a modified Pythagorean tuning like Gb-B (TX802 P05,<br/>&quot;key&quot; of Eb) or Db-F# (&quot;key&quot; of Bb) seems typical: thirds involving<br/>sharps are often rendered on keyboard as Pythagorean diminished<br/>fourths or augmented seconds very close to 5-limit ratios (5:4, 6:5).<br/>The contrast between these altered thirds and regular Pythagorean ones<br/>not involving sharps is one of the alluring features of this epoch.<br/>Thus Mark Lindley suggests that the vocal music of the young Dufay,<br/>for example (c. 1420-1440), might have been influenced by this kind of<br/>keyboard tuning.</p><p>For the era of around 1450-1680, some variety of meantone seems the<br/>norm, with temperaments of this kind evidently catching on around<br/>1450-1480. Anything from 1/3-comma to 1/6-comma might be idiomatic:<br/>typically I use 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma, which Mark Lindley regards as<br/>the region of maximum euphony for a 16th-century style, but temperings<br/>with major thirds a bit wider than pure are also reported in this<br/>period. One might guess that if playing Willaert&apos;s music on a keyboard,<br/>Vicentino (treatises of 1555, 1561) might have used something at or around<br/>1/4-comma, and Zarlino (who considers Willaert the very paradigm of good<br/>modern style) 2/7-comma, his temperament described in 1558, although in<br/>1571 he suggests that 1/4-comma is also agreeable and not too difficult to<br/>tune.</p><p>On the TX802, P04 gives 1/4-comma, with Eb-G# if the &quot;key&quot; is C. Some<br/>pieces might call for ranges of Ab-C# (&quot;key&quot; F) or Bb-D# (&quot;key&quot; G).<br/>The idea is to be able to play all accidentals as written; I can<br/>emulate Renaissance &quot;split-key&quot; instruments by having the lower manual<br/>in Ab-C#, for example, and the upper in Bb-D#: this gives a choose of<br/>Ab/G# and Eb/D# (a 14-note range of Ab-D#).</p><p>If one is seeking a conventional period keyboard rendition of most<br/>&quot;standard&quot; music, this quick summary might give some ideas.</p><p>I should add that medieval English music (say 1200-1450) is a special<br/>question, since both a theorist (Walter Odington, c. 1300) and some<br/>styles of writing suggest tendencies to a certain points to sing<br/>thirds at or close to 5-limit rather than Pythagorean ratios.<br/>Christopher Page suggests that thirds within phrase may often approach<br/>these simpler ratios, while cadential major thirds or sixths should be<br/>Pythagorean or larger. An English organ treatise of 1373 suggests one<br/>period solution: having tuned a basic diatonic set of notes in<br/>Pythagorean, tune the note for an accidental by averaging the<br/>length of the two adjacent organ pipes forming a usual 9:8 Pythagorean<br/>tune (e.g. if the pipes for C and D are at 90 centimeters and 80<br/>centimeters, measure the C# pipe at 85 centimeters). This produces an<br/>18:17:16 division which does yield some &quot;mollified&quot; thirds, to borrow<br/>Page&apos;s term. Anyway, it&apos;s one authentically documented period<br/>approach, and I could do Scala files for some interpretations of this,<br/>depending on whether you consider Bb as a basic note (a 3:2 or 4:3<br/>from F) or an added accidental (18:17 above A and 17:16 below B).</p><p>When we get into keyboard emulations of flexible-pitch instruments<br/>such as notably the human voice, or Renaissance viols (fretted but<br/>&quot;nuanceable&quot;), things get more intricate; but for conventional<br/>keyboard intonation, this might serve as a very basic guide.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=8844 href="#8844">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2005 7:16:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt;An English organ treatise of 1373 suggests one period<br/>&gt;solution: having tuned a basic diatonic set of notes in<br/>&gt;Pythagorean, tune the note for an accidental by averaging<br/>&gt;the length of the two adjacent organ pipes forming a<br/>&gt;usual 9:8 Pythagorean tune (e.g. if the pipes for C and<br/>&gt;D are at 90 centimeters and 80 centimeters, measure the<br/>&gt;C# pipe at 85 centimeters).
