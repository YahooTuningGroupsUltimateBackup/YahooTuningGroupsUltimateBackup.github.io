The<br/>fault might also lie partially with me for having composed the whole<br/>thing in short of two weeks and grudgingly undertaken right after to<br/>prepare the instrument parts on my own. At the time, the Annan Plan was<br/>either put to vote in Cyprus, or was about to be. My support had then<br/>been for the embracement of the Annan Plan and still is; hence, this<br/>concerto is a monumental offering for the longing of peace between<br/>Cypriots who have been sent to regrettable clashes at the goading of<br/>fascistic manipulations from both their overbearers.</p><p> From the final movement, I have extracted, again in 2004, the &quot;Cyprus<br/>March&quot;, composed for a united, unified island nation. This march can be<br/>sung in both Turkish and English, and possibly Greek as well (if<br/>somebody would care to translate it).
