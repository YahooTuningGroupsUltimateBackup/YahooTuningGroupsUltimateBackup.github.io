I bought it at full price and still think its great :)</p><p>The one feature i think is missing which would make it better for microtonal work is that you cant fix a particular tuning and then change the preset. The tuning is carried with the preset. A bit unfortunate but not a disaster.</p><p>&gt; Excuse my ignorance, but does .tun support mean microtonal capacity?   Yes, you can generate .tun files from scala. Its not as straightforward as it could be, but it works. I think there is also a big pack of .tun files you can get from camel audio. A .tun file just contains a mapping from input midi note numbers into fractional midi note numbers, also all the .tun files I have seen have 2 parts where the second is the same mapping but with higher precision.</p><p>martin.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2007 4:27:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gordon/Martin,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Yes, you can generate .tun files from scala.

Manuel also showed me a swell batch command - type one command on a directory that is all .scl files, and it will convert each and everyone to .tun in one fell swoop. Or one swell foop, I can&apos;t remember which it is.</p><p>If you ever need that last batch command, let me know, I have it written down _somewhere_...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2007 4:43:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; It&apos;s in the docs somewhere, basically you do a &quot;set synth ##&quot;<br/>&gt; to something (can&apos;t remember the number - Rick McG?) and then<br/>&gt; export the scale in that format</p><p>In the Edit menu...</p><p>Edit -&gt; Options...</p><p>Go to the User Options panel.
