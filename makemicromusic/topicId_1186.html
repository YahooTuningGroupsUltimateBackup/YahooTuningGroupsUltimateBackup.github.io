Not on recorder or &apos;cello of<br/>the Sb Live!, but great on the Glockenspiel and the Celeste.</p><p>Made a little fractal tune experiment using those observations,<br/>which sounded sweet on my SB live! soundcard, and rather raucous<br/>on the Yamaha Softsynth. So you&apos;ve got me started on 13-tet<br/>- I haven&apos;t really explored it before now.</p><p>I look forward to reading about the pieces and your technical<br/>notes.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
