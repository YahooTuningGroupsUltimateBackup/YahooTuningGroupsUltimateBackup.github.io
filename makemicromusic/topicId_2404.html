I<br/>recognize the rather &quot;odd&quot; mood of the scale in there, but the<br/>overall feel of the piece has that inimitable Jacky personality.<br/>Great and inspiring stuff!</p><p>kp</p></div><h3><a id=2530 href="#2530">ðŸ”—</a>kpeck77 &#x3C;kris.peck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2002 9:46:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Oh - so you know this MOS?!
