Real music is music that is able to compete in the musical marketplace (dare I mention &quot;pop&quot; music?), because it&apos;s capable of being appreciated, to at least some degree, by a general audience.  Of course, study will always increase the depth of one&apos;s comprehension of the composer&apos;s techniques, but that&apos;s true of any music or art, and it&apos;s certainly not essential for the listener to be able to discern that a piece has &quot;something to say&quot; and/or evokes specific emotions.  And it never hurts that a piece might have a catchy melody, exotic harmonies, and a clearly identifiable meter (duh! does anyone remember Music 101: the elements of music are melody, harmony, &amp; rhythm :-)), and perhaps is sculpted according to one of those tried-and-true musical forms we learned about in a theory class -- and perhaps playable on real (acoustic) instruments.</p><p>Let&apos;s face it: &quot;serious&quot; music has long had serious problems, and the solution is not in writing music that&apos;s overly convoluted in order to establish one&apos;s creditials as &quot;serious&quot; in order to be accepted by an academic establishment.  Microtonality solves the problem of the exhausted resources of the conventional 12-equal major-minor harmonic system, and it takes us a giant step beyond ordinary &quot;pop&quot; music and, if one chooses, to pick up from where the romantic period and non-atonal 20th-century composers left off.

I&apos;m going<br/>to go with Herman.  Too much reverb, and a bit aimless in<br/>structure.

There are a ton of excellent, hard-working musicians<br/>who have loyal audiences, from whom the proceeds of CDs and live<br/>performances constitute a living wage.  The other week on the<br/>phone with AKJ I brought up Charlie Hunter.  Just one of a<br/>thousand examples that could be named.

The CD revolution<br/>&gt; of the 1990s and mp3 revolution of the present decade made music<br/>&gt; connoisseurs in every genre.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     One thing I have noticed indeed, is that more genres and styles<br/>&gt; have reached the public ear and, thanks to the internet, fans of<br/>&gt; fringe genres can finally find plenty of music to satisfy their needs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The tricky thing I have noticed though, is how few fans I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; seen of micro-tonal even compared to genre&apos;s as odd as the Gabber<br/>&gt; and/or Noise genres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    True, micro-tonalists in niche styles can make a living, but can<br/>&gt; you walk into a group of even 30 people and be able to talk or<br/>&gt; gossip with one socially about micro-tonal music?  Sadly, the<br/>&gt; chances are very slim...and that annoys me a bit.<br/>&gt; *******************************************************************<br/>&gt; ...&quot;(my favorite eletronic artists are Marcus Hobbs and the<br/>&gt; aforementioned Astroid Power-Up).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     +1000 for Marcus Hobbs AKA Marcus Satellite.  He&apos;s big on<br/>&gt; Wilson&apos;s 6-note tunings, which are, IMVHO, as or more consonant than<br/>&gt; 12TET while adding extra sparkle.  Carl, I know you said &quot;niche<br/>&gt; audiences have grown so that one no longer needs the catchy stuff to<br/>&gt; earn a living&quot;...but, even better I believe, is the reality of micro-<br/>&gt; tonalists who can combine catchy-ness and consonance with niche-like<br/>&gt; deviance.   You can tell a song is his incredibly quickly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Also, unlike many micro-tonalists, Marcus does not skimp on the<br/>&gt; imagination or complexity of his beats or arrangement...doing full-<br/>&gt; on layered break-beats, arpeggios, pulsating custom-made pads,<br/>&gt; fluffy smooth filters, tantalizing female vocals, and all sorts of<br/>&gt; other tricks you&apos;d expect from a world-class dance musician (right<br/>&gt; up there with groups like Way Out West and BT)...and lets them<br/>&gt; emotionally decorate music in the same way, say, saxophone vibrato<br/>&gt; decorates jazz music expression.<br/>&gt;    This makes for epic music in every sense of the word.  Another<br/>&gt; note, the music flows...and so well you can very easily dance to it:<br/>&gt; a huge plus because DJs (myself included) can actually get away with<br/>&gt; playing it without getting a &quot;what the heck&quot; response from the<br/>&gt; audience.<br/>&gt; ****************************************************************<br/>&gt;    Another side of the &quot;general audience&quot; issue, I believe, is the<br/>&gt; issue of creating a good list of scales that can compete directly<br/>&gt; with 12TET consonance-wise while sounding different enough to strike<br/>&gt; listeners as new territory.  Here are some of my favorites<br/>&gt; A) Wilson&apos;s &quot;Hexany&quot; scale (I believe that&apos;s the name, but it&apos;s a 6-<br/>&gt; tone scale Marcus uses a lot)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B)  Ozan&apos;s Maqam-like scale used in &quot;Saba Storm&quot; (Ozan, please do us<br/>&gt; a favor and post this scale!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C) Wendy Carlos&apos;s Alpha scale as often used by Sean Archibald (who,<br/>&gt; IMVHO, isn&apos;t far behind Marcus Satellite)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D) Marcel&apos;s latest &quot;Harmonic-JI&quot; scale...which takes advantage of<br/>&gt; u-tonal relationships and will likely fit the bill for very well those<br/>&gt; who like the sound of extensive minor chords and inversions.  This is<br/>&gt; (finally) one scale he&apos;s made where the average (though not peak)<br/>&gt; consonance and flexibility does seem significantly better than in<br/>&gt; 12TET<br/>&gt; (note: I rejected a few of his earlier scale as almost<br/>&gt; indistinguishable and/or worse than 12TET based ones: I haven&apos;t always<br/>&gt; supported his work this much).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E) Subsets of 22TET (Decatonic scales)...at least for jazz-like<br/>&gt; music (some loss of consonance, but not too bad)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F) Sethares&apos; use of spectral-alignment (of timbre ) in 10TET.<br/>&gt; Again, it&apos;s still more dissonant than 12TET (even with the spectral<br/>&gt; mapping fix), but close enough that I can imagine many jazz music<br/>&gt; virtuosos IE Pat Metheny taking huge advantage of it (someone really<br/>&gt; needs to invent a stomp box for guitars that does spectral-<br/>&gt; alignment). :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G) My own 14-tone scale listed on<br/>&gt;     <a href="http://xenharmonic.ning.com/group/microtonalwithabeat/forum/topics/scales-built-for-use-in-future">http://xenharmonic.ning.com/group/microtonalwithabeat/forum/topics/scales-built-for-use-in-future</a><br/>&gt;     .....which attempts to maximize the distance between root notes<br/>&gt; (on average) while maintaining the kind of strong o-tonal<br/>&gt; relationships typical of JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Do any of you have any more scales and/or musician you believe<br/>&gt; could help break micro-tonal through to the general public?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
