I<br/>frankly don&apos;t believe that musical ideas are something we create any<br/>more than mathamatical formulas are something we create.  Music,<br/>IMHO, is really just a very emotional/intuitive type of math--it&apos;s<br/>all numbers.  There is a large (but not necessarily infinite)<br/>totality of all musical possibility that exists beyond the realm of<br/>human consciousness, and when someone gets a musical idea I think<br/>they&apos;re just pulling from that realm.

Every aspect of a<br/>musical performance that could be relevantly discussed in a court of<br/>law can be assigned a number.  Harmony, melody, meter, tempo, timbre,<br/>duration, envelope...it&apos;s all numeric.  We musicians are just<br/>arrangers of numbers when you get down to the very basics.  Any<br/>musical idea is nothing more than a particular set of values for a<br/>particular set of parameters.  Slowly, musicians are uncovering more<br/>and more permutations of these numeric arrangements.  For practical<br/>purposes, machines could do just as well if they were sufficiently<br/>sophisticated (i.e. included fractal or chaotic algorithms to account<br/>for human &quot;nuance&quot;/&quot;feeling&quot;).  If you can transcribe it, a machine<br/>could produce it.  I find it totally vain to claim &quot;authorship&quot; of a<br/>musical idea.  Actual recorded performances are a different thing, of<br/>course: they are physical, tangible, existential.  But musical ideas<br/>do not exist; they are essence only.  They are conceived as specific<br/>values of the quasi-infinite set of musical parameters.</p><p>Or, if you prefer a less cold/detached way of putting it: musical<br/>ideas are not *made* the way a house (or a car, or a bench, or a<br/>piano) is made.  They just *appear*, they drift out of the ether in<br/>to human consciousness.  A composition is not a creation, it is an<br/>expression of an idea.</p><p>How can you claim authorship of an idea?  Can you be sure that no one<br/>else has had &quot;your&quot; idea before?  Can you be sure that the same idea<br/>might not occur independently to someone else at some point in time?<br/>Do you have the right to deprive anyone else of the right to express<br/>that idea in their own way?  These aren&apos;t rhetorical questions by the<br/>way.</p><p>This may seem different from the original prospect of someone taking<br/>someone else&apos;s &quot;tune&quot;, putting their spin on it, and calling it their<br/>own.  But consider this: what if our would-be plagiarist actually<br/>*didn&apos;t* intentionally copy someone else.  Suppose he wrote a piece<br/>totally independently that just happend to sound *exactly* like a<br/>microtonal translation of an old 12-tET song?  Would all the rules<br/>still apply?</p><p>*sigh* maybe I shouldn&apos;t be mixing music with philosophy...</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; It would be nice if this were so, but Einstein could barely play<br/>music.<br/>&gt; No art is something that is way beyond science and math and that is<br/>why<br/>&gt; they hate it so much .

I claim what is mine as mine. I have had enough people come up to me say they have never heard any music like that from anyone ( in regard to my solo vibraphone music ) . this comment usually from musicians.<br/>music produces an idea in the mind but can come about by without any thought at all in this sense music has more to do with psychology than philosophy</p><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:</p><p>&gt;Well, I&apos;m not saying the creative process is necessarily mathematical &gt;(though it can be), but the end result *is*.  Every aspect of a &gt;musical performance that could be relevantly discussed in a court of &gt;law can be assigned a number.  Harmony, melody, meter, tempo, timbre, &gt;duration, envelope...it&apos;s all numeric.  We musicians are just &gt;arrangers of numbers when you get down to the very basics.  Any &gt;musical idea is nothing more than a particular set of values for a &gt;particular set of parameters.  Slowly, musicians are uncovering more &gt;and more permutations of these numeric arrangements.  For practical &gt;purposes, machines could do just as well if they were sufficiently &gt;sophisticated (i.e. included fractal or chaotic algorithms to account &gt;for human &quot;nuance&quot;/&quot;feeling&quot;).  If you can transcribe it, a machine &gt;could produce it.  I find it totally vain to claim &quot;authorship&quot; of a &gt;musical idea.  Actual recorded performances are a different thing, of &gt;course: they are physical, tangible, existential.  But musical ideas &gt;do not exist; they are essence only.  They are conceived as specific &gt;values of the quasi-infinite set of musical parameters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Or, if you prefer a less cold/detached way of putting it: musical &gt;ideas are not *made* the way a house (or a car, or a bench, or a &gt;piano) is made.  They just *appear*, they drift out of the ether in &gt;to human consciousness.  A composition is not a creation, it is an &gt;expression of an idea.  &gt;<br/>&gt;How can you claim authorship of an idea?  Can you be sure that no one &gt;else has had &quot;your&quot; idea before?  Can you be sure that the same idea &gt;might not occur independently to someone else at some point in time?  &gt;Do you have the right to deprive anyone else of the right to express &gt;that idea in their own way?  These aren&apos;t rhetorical questions by the &gt;way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This may seem different from the original prospect of someone taking &gt;someone else&apos;s &quot;tune&quot;, putting their spin on it, and calling it their &gt;own.

I think<br/>it&apos;s a great tuning, and one of many possible tuning choices.

Just now I am<br/>&gt; taking another stab at this area of knowledge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a subject I&apos;ve wanted to want to learn about (we all do what we<br/>&gt; Really want, ay?), and that is shifting to more, I want to learn about<br/>&gt; &quot;micro&quot; tuning which sounds kule and Just Intonation is simply a wae<br/>&gt; kule sounding phrase calling up images of fair words in a reassuring voice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mostly Love Percussion and building instruments to support that fix.<br/>&gt; The past several years I&apos;ve been getting into what I call &quot;tuned<br/>&gt; percussion&quot; hence my subscription here on [MMM] and the [tuning] channel<br/>&gt; also at yahoo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am contemplating and planning a marimba soon, the fellow that is going<br/>&gt; to mentor me through it I met on the drumming lists and he recently<br/>&gt; moved here. He asked me what range and tuning I wanted. I chose a Bass<br/>&gt; and because I already have a 12tET soprano marimba and a Senegalese<br/>&gt; balafon that is I believe pentatonic. He is telling me that diatonic is<br/>&gt; the way to go to have a Bass marimba that will &quot;play well&quot; with the<br/>&gt; keyboards I already have. I really don&apos;t grasp this at all, yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m thinking if you want me to post more, I need a shoe-horn to get my<br/>&gt; foot in the door, &apos;cause this is all still Greek or unGrok or something<br/>&gt; along those don&apos;t have a clue lines for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I accept that I am a dilettante trying to overcome my shallowness in a<br/>&gt; rather superficial way. Can any of you remarkably astute folks steer me<br/>&gt; to some (free/online) entry level tutorial so&apos;s maybe I can contribute<br/>&gt; something other than other folks words, sometime before Armageddon sets in?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you Help?<br/>&gt; Thanks for Everything!<br/>&gt; One Love, R<br/>&gt; ++++++<br/>&gt; &ldquo;To know the road ahead, ask those coming back.&rdquo;<br/>&gt; - Chinese Proverb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do bands have bass players?<br/>&gt; To translate for the drummer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &ldquo;Music is essentially useless, as life is.&rdquo;<br/>&gt; - George Santayana (1863-1952)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &ldquo;Life is like music; it must be composed by ear, feeling, and instinct,<br/>&gt; not by rule.&rdquo;<br/>&gt; - Samuel Butler<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &ldquo;These go to eleven.&rdquo;<br/>&gt; - Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel in &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; Embassy<br/>&gt; Pictures, 1984<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &ldquo;The new humanity will be universal, And it will have the artist&apos;s<br/>&gt; attitude, that of the musician; That is, it will recognize that the<br/>&gt; immense value and beauty of the human being lies precisely in the fact<br/>&gt; that each individual belongs to two realms, simultaneously, that of<br/>&gt; nature and that of the spirit.&rdquo;<br/>&gt; - Thomas Mann<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &ldquo;While making music together, people surpass invisible frontiers- as<br/>&gt; music is the only language which reaches from heart to heart without<br/>&gt; words or aggression.&rdquo;<br/>&gt; - Yacoub &apos;Bruno&apos; Camara of Fatala<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &ldquo;Percussion music is revolution.
