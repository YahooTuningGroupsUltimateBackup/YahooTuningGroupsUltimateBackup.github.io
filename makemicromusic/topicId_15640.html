In this case, it was<br/>&apos;whysynth&apos;, a DSSI-softsynth for Linux.</p><p>After looking at the source code, I was able to glean where in the<br/>code the pitch factor arrays were filled, and I was able to for<br/>instance change the &apos;12.0f&apos; in this code, to the number &apos;17.0f&apos; to get<br/>17-edo: (the &apos;f&apos; in the C language indicates a floating-point number,<br/>in case you wonder)</p><p>/* MIDI note to pitch */<br/>    for (i = 0; i &lt;= 128; ++i) {<br/>        pexp = (float)(i - 69) / 12.0f;<br/>        y_pitch[i] = powf(2.0f, pexp);<br/>    }</p><p>In this case, the &apos;y_pitch&apos; variable is an array, being filled element<br/>by element (the &apos;[i]&apos; is the array index) with pitch factors that<br/>correspond to MIDI note numbers. The &apos;69&apos; is A above middle-C, so this<br/>table is A440-centric, clearly.</p><p>One could even, for non-edos, write a script in Python (or pick your<br/>scripting language of choice) and fill this source code with someting<br/>like this</p><p>float y_pitch[127] = {<br/>  0.0000, 0.whatever, 0.whatever......<br/>}</p><p>Which could hard-codewise predefine a JI, a well-temperament, or<br/>whatever, that one could calculate pitch factors for, from MIDI-note 0<br/>to MIDI-note 127. Then you recompile, and boom, you have some<br/>subverted software for our particular fetish...</p><p>This is I know a rool-up-your-sleeves-and-get-dirty approach to<br/>getting more MMM software, but it&apos;s better than nothing, or waiting<br/>for a developer to do your bidding, and it shows an certain advantage<br/>of the open source software paradigm, at least for those<br/>do-it-yourselfers who have no fear to learn a little code and want to<br/>enable more cool instruments to do our work!</p><p>At least, it&apos;s no more or less challenging than doing a homemade<br/>decent acoustic instrument...</p><p>-A.</p></div>
