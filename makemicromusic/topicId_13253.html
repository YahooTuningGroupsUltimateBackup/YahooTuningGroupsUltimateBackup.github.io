Both your message and<br/>the reviews give a nice context for enjoying this music -- although<br/>not as nice, I&apos;d guess, as actually seeing the production.</p><p>The prelude in 31-edo has an opening reminding me a bit of Miles Davis<br/>(Kinda Blue) with its gliding feeling. There&apos;s also some quartal<br/>harmony that fit with a mood at once spacious and drifting. An<br/>interesting question is whether 31-edo might especially well fit the<br/>often complex harmony of jazz with its intimation of higher<br/>harmonics. The vibes timbre indeed seems to me the quintessence of<br/>&quot;cool.&quot;</p><p>The boogie in 22-edo has a &quot;jazzy&quot; quality fitting the overall<br/>ambiance, and I&apos;d be curious as to the sizes of thirds used (my own<br/>experience is that certain timbres can make tuning distinctions less<br/>critical).</p><p>The hangover transition piece in 22-edo has some &quot;blurring&quot; like a<br/>musical hangover; here I&apos;d guess that the step of 1/22 octave (about<br/>54.55 cents) is being used for a kind of chromatic or &quot;mini-chromatic&quot;<br/>effect). If so, might this be analogous to the use of an interval of<br/>4/19 octave (about 252.63 cents) in _The Juggler_. Anyway, this is a<br/>great example of music expressing a mood.</p><p>The _Avalon_ setting in 31-edo is really beautiful, and at the same<br/>time fits in with the original Al Jolson version: maybe I&apos;d compare it<br/>to some kind of instrumental variations on a chanson or madrigal of<br/>the kind done in 16th-century Spain, for example.</p><p>The waiting for Jerry piece in 31-edo struck me as a kind of<br/>contrapuntal variation, &quot;more contemplative than sad&quot; in my impression<br/>of the music alone -- but this was my first response in a setting<br/>where I was not watching the drama which could provide a mood for the<br/>music, as well as vice versa.</p><p>The shuffle piece is very sophisticated, fast and animated. My<br/>comments in my notes echo the opinion of at least one reviewer: this<br/>piece captures the &quot;real _zeitgeist_&quot; of the play, ironically one of<br/>energy and potential in a time often characterized by depression both<br/>economic and psychological.</p><p>Would anyone who hears the music without any information about the<br/>tunings or special experience with them or similar ones say &quot;This is<br/>microtonal&quot; -- or simply &quot;This is beautiful music that adds to the<br/>production values and evokes the world of the play itself&quot;?</p><p>Here we can appreciate both the overall musical artistry and the<br/>contributing role of the tuning systems used -- Aaron,<br/>congratulations!</p><p>Congratulations also, of course, to Annika Katharine, Lorna, and<br/>yourself for the most successful personal drama that you&apos;ve been<br/>involved with over the last week!</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=13265 href="#13265">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2006 10:50:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,<br/>This is great stuff!
