Certainly if I devised a tuning system like<br/>Gene&apos;s ennealimmal -- a really clever name -- I&apos;d want to use that<br/>name and celebrate it when discussing progressions or pieces using<br/>it. By the way, Gene has designed another tuning with a really neat<br/>name that I&apos;ll describe when I write a piece in it, a good incentive.</p><p>My general leaning _on MMM_ might be toward theory that more or less<br/>immediately relates to an actual piece or example, sometimes in an<br/>alphabetical or numerical notation (the former used in certain<br/>medieval European treatises), but preferably in some audio format,<br/>like the files of my 14-tET examples which Aaron Johnson has so<br/>helpfully and graciously prepared.</p><p>In contrast, I might wisely exercise special caution about generalized<br/>discussions that debate the merits of different tunings or categories<br/>of tuning systems; such comparisons can easily and quickly become<br/>invidious, at least to one or more parties involved. The result can be<br/>threads at once rather remote from composition or improvisation or<br/>performance, and highly contentious -- a bit different from the kind<br/>of musicmaking focus envisioned in our guidelines.</p><p>Here are some examples of things I might seek to do or avoid in MMM,<br/>keeping in view its specific character.</p><p>                      ------------------------<br/>                      Things I might do in MMM<br/>                      ------------------------</p><p>1. Telling how I came to use a tuning system such as Peppermint 24 or<br/>20-tET, and briefly explaining what an unfamiliar or less familiar<br/>name means (e.g. Sesquisexta, simply the Latin term for &quot;7:6,&quot; since<br/>this tuning has two 12-note Pythagorean chains of pure fifths at a 7:6<br/>apart).</p><p>2. Writing some running commentary about my adventures in a given<br/>tuning, or an amusing goof I made in counting scale steps, or a<br/>curious historical comparison that occurred to me when playing or<br/>improvising a given passage -- but including the passage in some form<br/>of notation or ideally audio rendition, and exercising some moderation<br/>as to length, in contrast to my habits in certain other forums &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>3. Explaining some basic rules of counterpoint or interval progression<br/>that I take for granted, but that lots of readers might not. For<br/>example, I might note that an &quot;intensive&quot; progression involves<br/>ascending semitonal motion, and a &quot;remissive&quot; progression descending<br/>semitonal motion.</p><p>4. Communicating a bit about my interval preferences, possibly one<br/>subtopic of &quot;microtonal aesthetics.&quot; In understanding the allure for<br/>me of a tuning like 14-tET, readers find it interesting to know that I<br/>consider 429 cents &quot;a superb major third&quot; (or supermajor, to apply a<br/>common term), and 942 cents a very wonderful size for an interval<br/>(here I wasn&apos;t disappointed, as noted in one recent post).</p><p>5. Discussing timbral practices and assumptions: for example, that in<br/>discussing 14-tET, I&apos;m basing my comments on synthesizer registrations<br/>chosen or designed to tone down the beating of 686-cent fifths and<br/>514-cent fourths.</p><p>6. Offering and gratefully receiving information that might clarify<br/>categories of tunings or performance practices discussed here, such as<br/>Daniel Wolf&apos;s very helpful comments that my &quot;pelog&quot; tunings in 14-tET<br/>of 0-1-6-8-9-14 and 0-1-3-8-9-14 might better fit the Sundanese<br/>categories of sorog and degung. I want to get these things right, and<br/>such information also encourages me (and possibly others) to learn<br/>more about musical and intonational traditions, enriching our own<br/>practices.</p><p>7. Including some humor, especially about myself.</p><p>8. Acknowledging and celebrating some of the ideas and examples I&apos;ve<br/>gotten from sister/brother list members and others.</p><p>9. Sometimes introducing &quot;practical comparisons&quot; of how, for example,<br/>I might play the same basic type of progression in different tuning<br/>systems.</p><p>10. Giving information of a kind that might help someone else use a<br/>tuning (e.g. a Scala file), or understand the sizes of the intervals<br/>that I&apos;m using and discussing (e.g. cents, integer ratios, or scale<br/>steps in an equal temperament or well-temperament).</p><p>                      ----------------------------<br/>                      Things I might not do in MMM<br/>                      ----------------------------</p><p>1. Getting into a long technical discussion about the fine points of<br/>scale design and optimization of a given tuning system, especially the<br/>kind of exposition at some length that might make a fine essay for<br/>some other forum.</p><p>2. Taking a given interval or progression in a tuning system I&apos;m<br/>enjoying as the starting point for a comprehensive essay on a topic<br/>like different interpretations of the division of the whole-tone into<br/>&quot;five parts&quot; proposed by Marchettus of Padua in 1318, or the scholarly<br/>literature as to proposed values in cents for the two 36-note per<br/>octave tunings described by Nicola Vicentino for his archicembalo or<br/>&quot;superharpsichord&quot; in 1555.</p><p>3. Presenting an elaborate discussion on 14th-century or 16th-century<br/>European contrapuntal theory.</p><p>4. Posting an involved theoretical discussion of at least 400 lines on<br/>medieval European consonance/dissonance theory as it relates to my<br/>taste in tunings -- again, something fun for other forums, but which I<br/>might better do here in a paragraph or so, surrounded by musical<br/>examples.</p><p>5. Setting forth on a rather abstruse discussion on timbre/tuning<br/>interactions and consonance/dissonance models -- something that might<br/>be very relevant here if done more concisely, and linked to specific<br/>musical examples (e.g. some of the &quot;xentonal&quot; music of Bill Sethares,<br/>or a performance in 22-tET by Paul Erlich where he applied his model<br/>of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;).</p><p>6. Getting into lengthly explications of fine points concerning<br/>medieval or Renaissance genres or theoretical controversies -- yes,<br/>for me this can be a curious form of entertainment -- which might<br/>serve more to distract from than to spice up the musicmaking that is<br/>our main focus. (An amusing historical anecdote, in 25 lines or less,<br/>might be more like a touch of spice.)</p><p>7. Posting remarks where I might feel a need to be assertive that my<br/>musical viewpoint is a bit different from some &quot;norm,&quot; but which might<br/>be made more _gently_ assertive, and so avoid the risk of needlessly<br/>putting another participant on the defensive, especially when there<br/>might not actually be any disagreement. I mention this because I once<br/>made a comment on another list that I really regret, fortunately<br/>received with a most noble friendliness and grace by the other person<br/>that I would like to emulate more often.</p><p>8. Getting involved in debates about the general merits of a given<br/>tuning system or musical style, even in &quot;self-defense.&quot; Of course, I<br/>might respond more obliquely by presenting a musical example that<br/>addresses a given point, but preferably with a focus on the music,<br/>letting people draw their own conclusions.</p><p>9. Theorizing about tunings with which I&apos;m unfamiliar -- with two<br/>qualifications. First, if a tuning someone else is using or inquiring<br/>about is _almost_ identical to one I&apos;ve used (e.g. 31-tET vs. 1/4-comma<br/>meantone), I might note this fact and go from there. Secondly, for<br/>example, if someone asks, &quot;How can I make the 720-cent and 480-cent<br/>fifths and fourths in 15-tET more concordant?&quot; then I might address<br/>this _specific_ question based on my experience with the same<br/>intervals in 20-tET.</p><p>10. Posting a full analysis, for example, of all of the intervals<br/>found or just ratios approximated in one of my 24-note tunings.</p><p>These are things often easier said than done -- or not done -- but<br/>possibly sharing a bit of how I&apos;d like to participate might give<br/>another view in this dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6438 href="#6438">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
