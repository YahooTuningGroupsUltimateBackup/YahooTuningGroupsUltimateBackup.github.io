FWIW, i think it&apos;s THE important and vital part of a<br/>list like this. And while not everybody listens to and likes<br/>everybody or even participates in posting music, most everybody who<br/>posts enough music and has some ability to communicate &quot;something&quot;<br/>finds their sympathetic listeners/co-posters/ fellow music makers.<br/>And that ,to my mind anyway, is what it&apos;s all about.</p><p>Anyway, I got a pile of new stuff up here</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/music/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/music/</a></p><p>but there is one piece i thought i&apos;d point out (should anyone be<br/>interested) as it&apos;s never been up before and was a big piece for me<br/>back when i was trying to decide what it was that i wanted to do with<br/>music after getting out of high school . The piece itself was a kind<br/>of pantheist mass, and is the last piece on the page:</p><p>Pantheist Mass</p><p>I know a 26.17Mb lump of thing probably isn&apos;t what anybody is looking<br/>for, but I post it because it was a real period of demarcation for me<br/>where i was trying to decide if i was going to try to persue music as<br/>a vocation or an education or something else entirely...and, like it<br/>or not, i think this kind of thing is important. It took almost three<br/>weeks of nonstop recording to finish this piece, and it was quite a<br/>big job at the time; logistically, emotionally, and structurally. I<br/>was 20 years old, and although i&apos;d been playing since i was 13 this<br/>was the first time i knew i wanted to do something &quot;else&quot; with<br/>music....maybe not even music, and for me nothing was quite the same<br/>after that. Anyway, if nothing else was ambitious and sincere in the<br/>sense that i really was pushing myself into a different place and<br/>learning what i could and couldn&apos;t do musically.</p></div><h3>plopper6 &#x3C;billwestfall@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2006 1:40:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/music/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/music/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Pantheist Mass<br/>&gt; ...</p><p>Here&apos;s my second try at a post (Yahoo ate the first):</p><p>I like this piece of music, especially the 11-23 minute section which<br/>is a descent into total audio madness.<br/>Wondering what were your musical influences at this point?
