This one would have really benefited from some kind of hand drum, IMO, such as a dumbek.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/1/cityoftheasleepmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/1/cityoftheasleepmusic.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Check out &quot;I stand hopeless before the gray sea&quot;.

Your musicianship<br/>and creativity shines through the gloom, and I can&apos;t wait to hear<br/>more music of this caliber -- particularly longer, more structured<br/>pieces. But this piece would be absolutely perfect as is behind an<br/>appropriate film scene. For tuning mavens, the mode Igliashon used<br/>here has step sizes of</p><p>4-3-4-3-4-3-4-3-3</p><p>in 31-equal, giving the notes</p><p>0-4-7-11-14-18-21-25-28(-31)</p><p>I particularly enjoyed this piece because I play guitar -- including<br/>31-equal guitar -- but I hear simple, beautiful little ideas that are<br/>very different from my fingers&apos; own habits, and probably wouldn&apos;t<br/>have come up with myself. Now I&apos;ll have to copy you :) Very<br/>refreshing!</p><p>Gene wrote a piece in the Orwell-9 scale, but I can&apos;t recall which<br/>one . . . was it Trio?</p></div>
