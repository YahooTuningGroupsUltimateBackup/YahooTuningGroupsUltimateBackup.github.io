However,<br/>the fourier series, as you said, are also used to<br/>analyse sounds into their partials - when you<br/>use a program that finds the partials of a timbre,<br/>then that is likely to be the method that it uses<br/>to do it.</p><p>One can use fourier series to convert any kind of<br/>a curve that isn&apos;t too wildly discontinuous<br/>into a sequence of frequencies that adds up to<br/>the same shape over a finite region.</p><p>The reasons may not be well understood, but<br/>when one finds the frequencies that add up to<br/>make a musical note, the frequencies one gets<br/>correspond to the partials that the ear actually<br/>hears when listening to that note, if you listen<br/>to it carefully. At least, one can train to<br/>hear the partials in a musical timbre;<br/>it&apos;s something the ear is able to do.</p><p>If you make a note out of those partials then<br/>the result sounds pretty much like the original<br/>in a general kind of way, however it isn&apos;t exact<br/>because of the time varying component of it<br/>- in real life partials of a sound start, stop,<br/>and change in pitch as the note progresses.</p><p>The fourier series if done exactly would capture<br/>all that too, by adding in suitable low frequency<br/>components, because it can exactly reconstitute the original<br/>wave shape, so long as one also preserves the<br/>phase information too. However, in practice<br/>that doesn&apos;t really work too well and<br/>combined approaches are needed.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s not so surprising that if one adds<br/>up the partials one gets a note that sounds<br/>somewhat like the original timbre. It is<br/>a little surprising that the ear is able to<br/>hear those constituent partials of a timbre<br/>- if you look at it on an oscilloscope you<br/>see the basic shape as a repeating pattern,<br/>but you don&apos;t see the partials at all.<br/>E.g. a saw tooth waveform could just as<br/>easily be perceived as a simple shape in<br/>its own right. Also a square wave ditto.</p><p>I suppose the question is,<br/>why do we hear sounds as made up of sine<br/>waves, rather than, say, square waves<br/>(which is anohter way of analysing it).</p><p>Also, do we hear in terms of exact sine<br/>waves, or is that just a first approximation<br/>to the way we hear the partials of a sound?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2248 href="#2248">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 2:30:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I suppose the question is,<br/>&gt; why do we hear sounds as made up of sine<br/>&gt; waves, rather than, say, square waves<br/>&gt; (which is anohter way of analysing it).</p><p>simple: study the physics of the cochlea (or of any resonator).<br/>square waves may work mathematically, but they don&apos;t make sense<br/>*physically*. a resonant body will be excited anytime there&apos;s a *sine<br/>wave component* present that agrees with its resonant frequency.<br/>pretty simple differential equations behind this. the cochlea is<br/>essentially a system of a large number of resonators, overlapping so<br/>as to be sensitive to the full range of frequencies 20-20,000 Hz (at<br/>best).</p><p>&gt; Also, do we hear in terms of exact sine<br/>&gt; waves, or is that just a first approximation<br/>&gt; to the way we hear the partials of a sound?</p><p>well, i suppose it&apos;s a first approximation in the sense that what we<br/>hear is actually time-varying . . . but in the sense that some other<br/>periodic waveform would be more correct, no -- i remember wondering<br/>about this pretty intensely as an undergraduate and ended up<br/>discovering that the sine/cosine function is really unique in this<br/>regard.</p><p>this should probably continue elsewhere, either metatuning or<br/>tuning . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2318 href="#2318">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 10:39:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/26/02 5:30 PM, &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I suppose the question is, why do we hear sounds as made up of sine waves,<br/>&gt;&gt; rather than, say, square waves (which is anohter way of analysing it).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; simple: study the physics of the cochlea (or of any resonator). square waves<br/>&gt; may work mathematically, but they don&apos;t make sense *physically*. a resonant<br/>&gt; body will be excited anytime there&apos;s a *sine wave component* present that<br/>&gt; agrees with its resonant frequency. pretty simple differential equations<br/>&gt; behind this. the cochlea is essentially a system of a large number of<br/>&gt; resonators, overlapping so as to be sensitive to the full range of frequencies<br/>&gt; 20-20,000 Hz (at best).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I never noticed that but it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Also, do we hear in terms of exact sine waves, or is that just a first<br/>&gt;&gt; approximation to the way we hear the partials of a sound?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; well, i suppose it&apos;s a first approximation in the sense that what we hear is<br/>&gt; actually time-varying . . . but in the sense that some other periodic waveform<br/>&gt; would be more correct, no -- i remember wondering about this pretty intensely<br/>&gt; as an undergraduate and ended up discovering that the sine/cosine function is<br/>&gt; really unique in this regard.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This could prove to be a powerful observation.
