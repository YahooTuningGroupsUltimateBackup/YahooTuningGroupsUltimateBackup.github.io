As our name suggests, our special focus is on the creation of new music, with mutual encouragement and enthusiasm as we share passages, pieces, and bits of supportive criticism or lively dialog.</p><p>Two keynotes of our group are concreteness and civility: keeping discussions closely related to the actual creation of new music, and keeping them friendly.</p><p>Other forums provide for general discussions of philosophy, theory, and music history in various cultures; we strive to keep similar remarks reasonably related to actual new passages, pieces, or planned works. We also favor short, on-topic posts, in contrast to the longer or more &quot;academic-style&quot; articles welcomed in other forums.</p><p>Keeping it friendly doesn&apos;t exclude frank criticism, especially when sought, or even a free clash of ideas, so long as mutual respect between people is maintained (see our Forum Guidelines for more information). To sum up our general approach:</p><p>Respect people<br/>Share music and enthusiasm<br/>Exchange ideas<br/>Create!&quot;</p><p>*****</p><p>It is worth the time for everyone to think about what this forum should be focused on, because I think it has drifted, and in doing so, lessened the value of the place.

Only a small<br/>percentage of posts here seem to be directly related to posted music.&quot;</p><p>   Hats off to this!  Getting on-topic or even non-in-flamatory responses to posted music is, sadly, very tough to do here as of late.</p><p>  When I started being really active here about 5 months ago, I migrated here much as I had seen the Tuning list go sour.  People there seemed more interesting in correcting each other on academic terms, if not flat out flaming each other over them for &quot;getting them wrong&quot;.  Often you&apos;d have 3-4 experts fighting at once, calling each other ignorant.</p><p>  The idea of MMM as a forum where I could post music and look for tips/reviews on music without having &quot;Holy Armies&quot; sent against me seemed refreshing.</p><p>   So, early on in this list, I posted some songs with little response.  And then I noticed, a lot of the  people I&apos;d conflicted with on the tuning list followed me.<br/>  And the mere mention of what scales I used (IE mine, the ones I mentioned on the tuning list) apparently got people very interested in picking on me for &quot;pretending to be a great scale creator while not being &apos;academically correct&apos; &quot;.<br/>  Then all h--l broke loose...  Ozan attacked me for not making music after I&apos;d posted 4+ songs to this list...I posted a new song and he complained even more saying it had &quot;no emotion whatsoever&quot; and then forced me to either defend my songs as &quot;scientifically sound&quot; or not release them.</p><p>  There was no peace to be had in posting music here...so I by and large stopped doing it.  Every time I did post music, I was forced in a corner to defend theories instead of being able to discuss my music and reviews.  One obvious example, I complimented Mike B on his post on Debussy PIECES only to receive a huge tirade about how wrong I was to call them &quot;songs&quot; (and so what if I was wrong...is it really worth completely knocking my music-review thread off to force me to defend an honest and not ill-intended-at-all mistake)?  Someone just could have sent me a personal message &quot;just for future notice...those Debussy pieces are not technically songs as they have no singing...please call them &apos;pieces&apos; not &apos;songs&apos;&quot;...instead of flogging me in public and I would have listened.</p><p>   I comment on a fair share Chris&apos;s and Igs&apos;s pieces...but have very little input on my own that doesn&apos;t chain back to &quot;your scale is wrong&quot; or &quot;there is no variation at all&quot; or some inflammatory thing like that.  And I&apos;ve noticed Chris gets little input on his songs as well before those threads spin off-topic to something academic like &quot;what chords are in x tuning and how do the tuning&apos;s generators work&quot;.<br/>  The only person I&apos;ve seen get consistent on-topic and respectful responses on a thread regarding their music is Igs...and granted he&apos;s excellent...but you shouldn&apos;t have to be freaking &quot;Mozart&quot; to earn honest on-topic reviews and suggestions of posted music here.</p></div><h3><a id=26581 href="#26581">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2011 7:40:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake,</p><p>I would be happy to talk about what equipment I used and how I used it to<br/>create a piece.<br/>Or discuss why I did this or that in a composition instead of the other<br/>three alternatives.</p><p>When my composition is a pure sound recording improvisation it might get<br/>tough to dig details out - but even then I remember what I did to a degree.</p><p>I think this is probably true of every other composer who still posts here.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sun, Mar 6, 2011 at 10:33 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; as one of the few people who regularly post music here I have to say<br/>&gt; it is<br/>&gt; &gt; very disappointing to get either no reply - or find my thread was<br/>&gt; hijacked<br/>&gt; &gt; for totally different subjects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find myself not wanting to get too chatty about posted music because<br/>&gt; people seem to want to talk about other things.

If you think they don&apos;t, then why not just ignore them?</p><p>Anyway, on other notes... I haven&apos;t had a lot of time for *doing* music myself lately, like the last couple of years, because of involvement in some other non-musical epic projects, but... I do read the list here, and listen to some music here, even if I don&apos;t comment on it. Sorry. I know it&apos;s a bummer to post a piece of music and then get no response, but my impression is that people -- everybody -- are just waaaaaaay too busy and way too stressed.
