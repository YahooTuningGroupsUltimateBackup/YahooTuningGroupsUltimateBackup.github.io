As Manueal has<br/>just mentioned, the pitch information in Scala is in the keyboard<br/>mapping. This gives most flexibility because you can change scale<br/>and keyboard mapping independently.</p><p>The synth programmers could do well to add support for loading them too.</p><p>Actually I just had the idea today, maybe this is the ideal format<br/>for the interchangeable microtonal text file that I need in order<br/>to start work to explore what a truly microtonal notation program<br/>might look like.</p><p>One could just use the same format as midi - with controllers<br/>and everything - and retune it using Scala scales and<br/>keyboard mappings.</p><p>Could just look like this:</p><p>scl<br/>... Scala scale<br/>-scl</p><p>kbm<br/>... Keyboard mapping<br/>-kbm</p><p>C 10 0 ! midi controller 10:  pan to 0 postion - hard left<br/>N 1 60 127 !note on in channel 1 midi number 60 volume 127<br/>T 1 ! wait one second<br/>N 1 60 0 ! switch the note off again</p><p>and so on. Or something like that.</p><p>It seems to me that what would be really nice would be if one<br/>could also have a standard for including SCALA scales data<br/>in midi files and to send them as midi messages too. Same<br/>for keyboard mappings. We can do MTS tuning programs already,<br/>and the various types of tuning dumps,<br/>but a SCALA scale sysex would be much more user friendly<br/>for microtonal musicians, and indeed probably for programmers too<br/>- ditto for keyboard mappings.</p><p>A sysex is the natural choice there, but we need one that is<br/>suitable to use to send text data like this. In a midi<br/>file you could use a text event.</p><p>Once one is able to send a text event, one can put anything we like in it<br/>e.g.<br/>&quot;/scl ...<br/>(scala scale definition)</p><p>&quot;/kbm ...<br/>(scala keyboard mapping)</p><p>which would be easy enough for a receiving program to deal with.</p><p>This is a technique sometimes used to extend a file format without<br/>breaking the existing one - so long as it has a way to add text<br/>comments to it, then one can devise syntaxes for htose and they<br/>will get ignored by all applications that regard them as<br/>comments. For a very well known example - that is how all<br/>the javascript on web pages is done - it is all in html<br/>comments so any browser that doesn&apos;t understand javascript<br/>will treat it all as comments to be ignored.</p><p>The same technique is used in robots.txt.</p><p>So anyway, I wondered what anyone thinks about htis idea.<br/>Also, is there any sysex that gets used for sending text data<br/>via midi already, anyone know?</p><p>The other possibility is to make a new sysex - but only manufacturers<br/>can do that. One of the major midi manufacturers would need to be persuaded to make<br/>a new SCALA sysex for anyone to use. Or the alternative is to<br/>introduce a new Universal real time sysex - don&apos;t know how<br/>one sets about that - there are only a few of those so maybe they<br/>are hard to introduce.</p><p>I can&apos;t think of anything else. Anyone got any ideas.<br/>Seems to me that it would be highly desirable to<br/>develop some way of embedding scala scales and<br/>keyboard mappings into midi data streams if it<br/>can be done.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
