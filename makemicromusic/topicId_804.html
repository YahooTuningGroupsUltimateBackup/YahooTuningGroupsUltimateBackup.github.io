I remember hearing that the kit worked rather well for nylon-string guitar, but I&apos;m looking for opinions on the sound of high-quality steel-string acoustic guitars with the interchangeable fingerboards.</p><p>Though I find nylon-string guitars easier to play, chords such as higher-limit Utonal chords sound much better to me on the steel-string acoustic guitar than on any other instrument. Probably sympathetic vibrations among the higher harmonics have something to do with that.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paul</p></div>
