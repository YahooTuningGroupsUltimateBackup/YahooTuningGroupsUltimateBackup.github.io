I think the theoretical<br/>&gt; stuff is logically organized, but I&apos;m not sure the practical stuff<br/>&gt; even touches on the right ideas -- but then again, that&apos;s why there<br/>&gt; needs to be a book!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Jake<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 2/8/11, jonszanto&lt;jszanto@...&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Regarding the future/impending &quot;Great Book of Xenology&quot;, bear in mind that<br/>&gt;&gt; getting the information right, deciding on the scope, getting all the<br/>&gt;&gt; examples lined up, all this is just part of the picture.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The more important part is that the person writing this book must not just<br/>&gt;&gt; be a good writer, but a very good communicator. If not *the* Achille&apos;s heel<br/>&gt;&gt; of the microtonal community, at least (arguably) the largest impediment, is<br/>&gt;&gt; the problem that a lot of knowledgeable individuals haven&apos;t developed the<br/>&gt;&gt; skills to communicate that knowledge outside of the inner circle. Maybe they<br/>&gt;&gt; haven&apos;t *needed* to, but this project cries out for something far less<br/>&gt;&gt; opaque than we are used to dealing with in these parts...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
