And, man, if there&apos;s one thing I wish micro folks would do, it&apos;s compose, gogogo. I think we need a large body of non 12 music, as much as possible, and the only way to improve as a composer is to do it. I have been playing for 40 years now, and I&apos;m still constantly studying, learning what other people are up to, and stealing what I can from wherever I can, and trying to deepen my art. I&apos;ll never stop.<br/>  And as far as consonance/dissonance goes, those terms are totally tied to whatever it is that a composer is trying to accomplish...sometimes consonance can be very flat, and dissonance can be very profound. For example, Dan Stearns just sent me his latest CD demo, and it&apos;s some of the best music I&apos;ve heard in ages; I just had a student listen to some of it, and he said it well: &quot;It doesn&apos;t go where I think it&apos;s going to go.&quot; And boy, that&apos;s JUST the kind of music I like to hear, something that surprises me, and Dan&apos;s music takes me places in my imagination I&apos;ve never been. And, he uses 20, 14, 13, and 12 tone tunings, plus fretless guitar, in a way that makes any sort of categories fairly meaningless...the music is so perfectly realized, that consonance/dissonance are obsolete terms. Not so easy to achieve, and it makes me want to just try harder to do the best i can with my own compositions. And, that&apos;s what everybody should try to do anytime they compose, go deep and say something meaningful....best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2006 7:41:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hey neil, thanks for the kind words ,i really appreciate it<br/>especially coming from you! For me, music, in its most vital means of<br/>interface, has very little to do with musicianship and even less to<br/>do with tuning and the like...yet these are the very things that most<br/>practitioners are destined to overemphasize. I can enjoy great<br/>musicianship, and i can enjoy subtle manipulation of tuning (et al),<br/>but that in itself is never enough to make the hairs on my neck stand<br/>up fill my imagination with half imaginable dreams and to me that&apos;s<br/>what it&apos;s all about .</p><p>thanks again,daniel</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot;<br/>&lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Hey Herman...good comment on all the crappy 12 tone music, of<br/>course<br/>&gt; you&apos;re right.
