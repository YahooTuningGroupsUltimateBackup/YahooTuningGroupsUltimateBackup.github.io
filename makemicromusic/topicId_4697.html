I was in rare form<br/>in getting midi-ox installed.   My windows installer was too old.  So<br/>after I paid $29 for winzip8.  I found it was a micro-soft utility<br/>that needed updated.  I opted for a kit solution.  To get the kit I<br/>wanted I first needed a core kit.  To get the core kit I needed  an<br/>updated windows (you&apos;re way ahead of me) installer.  Fortunately they<br/>pointed one out and that being acquired I went back to installing<br/>midi-ox.  My son got my speaker cable properly attached.  And in a<br/>perfect world I would effortlessly be exploring my new set-up.</p><p>Next I had to reinstall midi-yoke to keep the total of midi devises<br/>within ten.</p><p>Before I ask for more help,  I want to voice my appreciation.  I must<br/>admit you (group) are opening up a whole new world to me.  I didn&apos;t<br/>plan on using an oscilloscope or sampling sounds initially.  Now I am<br/>learning and want to know more.  I&apos;m good for now.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jim Nagy</p></div>
