I guess I was mostly saying that<br/>&gt; *personally* I don&apos;t care for quotation, and it seems Kraig doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, I wasn&apos;t thinking *at all* of Ives.  Certainly he&apos;s<br/>&gt; a &quot;different&quot; case and I would also strongly disagree with Carter in<br/>&gt; this matter...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George Crumb and George Rochberg are two *other* composers who have<br/>&gt; also used quotation to extremely creative effect....</p><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>I&apos;ve been reading the stuff about Ives&apos;s use of quotation, and<br/>all thru this discussion have been thinking of Mahler in the<br/>same regard.  This is yet another aspect of their compositional<br/>styles that links these two great composers.  (It never stops<br/>amazing me how many similarities can be found between Mahler<br/>and Ives... at least, concerning their respective music and the<br/>way they thought about it.)</p><p>Also, again speaking of rap, I wanted to note that Public Enemy<br/>(my all-time fave #1 rap group... ha -- another pun) made *terrific*<br/>and *wildly creative* use of samples/quotations, mainly from<br/>James Brown, but also from lots of other places.</p><p>I&apos;ve only dabbled in this sort of thing myself, the most obvious<br/>example being a bite I took out of the opening of Mahler&apos;s 6th,<br/>last movement, for the start of the funky wedding march I wrote<br/>for my own wedding back in &apos;92, and I tossed in a favorite lick<br/>from Eric Clapton&apos;s _Layla_ on the violin part in the last section.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/worklist/wedfunk.mp3">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/worklist/wedfunk.mp3</a><br/>(sorry about the low fidelity...
