Even<br/>if you have two clock like polyrhtyhms,<br/>the variety of pulse you get from the two<br/>gives the result a lot of life I feel.</p><p>FTS has polyrhtyhms and fibonacci rhythms.<br/>The fibonacci rhythms are based on an idea<br/>by David Canright.The interesting thing about<br/>those is that though they have a lot of structure<br/>to them, they never ever repeat exactly.</p><p>Larger and larger fragments of the rhythm<br/>repeat but the whole rhythm never does<br/>(at least ideally if you have arbitrarily<br/>many layers - in FTS you have 30 layers<br/>maximum so they do eventually repeat<br/>but only after many beats, e.g. days or<br/>whatever).</p><p>However, I think what I find hard to<br/>take in the clock like 4/4 is also<br/>exactly what many people actually like<br/>about it - the way the rhythm is so<br/>regular it almost becomes not a rhythm<br/>any more, just a tick tick tick.<br/>Sometimes I can appreciate that<br/>a bit, usually if there is something<br/>else going on, or it fades in / out<br/>or something like that.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
