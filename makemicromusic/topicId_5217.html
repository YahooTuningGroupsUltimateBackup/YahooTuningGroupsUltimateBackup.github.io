Yes, there are certain things that may have to be adjusted, such as where the &apos;center&apos; pitch might reside.

The economics of the situation are that Mac is a<br/>&gt; minority platform and microtonalists are a minority breed. Combine the two<br/>&gt; and if you&apos;re a developer, you have a really small market. The biggest<br/>&gt; microtonal market is likely to be on Windows; and that&apos;s also where the<br/>&gt; largest developer community is; therefore, you&apos;ll find more choices in that<br/>&gt; area.</p><p>If I used my Roland HP-2800G as the controller w/ CronoX as the softsynth, what VST<br/>host would I need to use to make microtonal music with that setup? -Justin</p></div><h3><a id=5232 href="#5232">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2003 1:39:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
