But when I compare<br/>Jacob&apos;s piece with what we know he can do in 19 it&apos;s depressing. I<br/>think the &quot;17 revolution&quot; is not very satisfying. I&apos;d like to<br/>contribute to a project like this, but 17-et locks me out in that I<br/>can&apos;t see how to work with it in a way I would be satisfied with.</p></div>
