I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d be dying to hear it...even if most of you probably agree the whole &quot;Emily Bear = the next Mozart&quot; publicity gig is a gross overestimation.&nbsp; Not to mention to more complex (and hopefully just as heartfelt/foundational) compositions we&apos;re likely to hear from her in the next 10 years...&nbsp; I also wonder what would happen if we tried to microtune MIDI files from her compositions....</p></div>
