He is so incredibly fast that it reminds one of Nancarrow&apos;s<br/>&gt; player piano studies, but done with human hands. He is a wonder to<br/>&gt; behold, but not for everyone&apos;s tastes.</p><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>Cecil Taylor is truly amazing, I heard/saw/experienced a solo piano concert<br/>he did in Washington DC during the mid 1980s. He beautifully incorporated<br/>ritual into the performance, first dancing around the instrument as if<br/>encountering the piano for the first time, circling it, looking at it,<br/>touching it, inquisitively stroking strings and tapping percussively on the<br/>case, and finally sitting down to the keyboard for almost two hours of<br/>non-stop improvisation, the likes of which I&apos;ve never heard since.</p><p>I also heard Dollar Brand on the same concert series that year. Another<br/>favorite pianist!</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div>
