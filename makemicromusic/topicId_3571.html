The<br/>&gt;only Neidhard tmeperament I have directions for is a very balnd<br/>&gt;slight variation on ET</p><p>That&apos;s the one I believe, 2 cents below ET for the odd numbered<br/>tones. The scale archive says 1732 for this temperament but that<br/>might be wrong. I&apos;ve never heard of an Aaron-Neidhardt tuning.<br/>I&apos;m still hoping that the book Rudolf Rasch had planned to write<br/>about Neidhardt is going to be published some time.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
