I can always be reached at microstick@...  My sites are <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a>  and</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/microstick">www.myspace.com/microstick</a>  I appreciate being mentioned here...I actually have 8 CD&apos;s out, with my latest, &quot;Spider,&quot; coming out next week. It will feature the tune &quot;Spider,&quot; for 19 tone electric guitar with the Colorado Chamber Orchestra, as well as more 19 and some fretless pieces.</p><p>   There&apos;s few works for electric guitar with orchestra, and fewer yet for micro guitar. I think the string players did a great job with 19, it&apos;s pretty unique and has a lot of heart. I will be playing in Chicago March 28th, at Arron K Johnson&apos;s invite, and I am greatly looking forward to it...contact Aaron for more info (it will be at the Cornelia Arts bldg, 1800 Cornelia St). And, John Schneider also has several excellent CD&apos;s available, but don&apos;t know his site...I think he&apos;s on Bridge Records.</p><p>Best from Colorado...Hstick</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
