Here are some audio and score<br/>files, the later in PostScript, PDF, and abc notation formats:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.ogg">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.ps">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.ps</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.pdf">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.abc">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.abc</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone tuning, which I find very likely, a fifthtone is<br/>often equal to the enharmonic diesis of 128:125 or about 41.06 cents --<br/>with some smaller fifthtones equal to about 34.99 cents, these two<br/>slightly unequal fifthtones making up a chromatic semitone of about 76.05<br/>cents. In a mathematically precise 31-EDO, first described by Lemme Rossi<br/>(1666) and Christian Huygens (e.g.  1691), each diesis or fifthtone is<br/>equal to precisely 1/31 octave, or about 38.71 cents.</p><p>A problem, then and now, is how to notate these small fifthtone steps.<br/>Both Vicentino and the anonymous composer or scribe in the Coimbra<br/>manuscript use a symbol that raises a note by a fifthtone or diesis: a dot<br/>above the note for Vicentino, and a sign something like a small &quot;x&quot; for<br/>the Coimbra notator (and also interestingly, as Carpenter remarks, in a<br/>discussion by Thomas Morley in 1597 about the enharmonic diesis). Colonna<br/>has a kind of &quot;half-sharp&quot; sign for the diesis somewhat related to Coimbra<br/>(and Morley).</p><p>In ASCII notation, Vicentino&apos;s dot (or the Coimbra &quot;x&quot;) can be represented<br/>easily as an asterisk (*). Thus the whole tone C-D can be divided into<br/>five fifthtone steps in a complete 31-tone meantone: C-C*-C#-Db-Db*-D<br/>(Vicentino-style), or C-C*-C#-C#*-Db*-D (one solution in Coimbra style).<br/>The main difference is that Vicentino prefers to write C#-Db, and the<br/>Coimbra manuscript to write C#-C#*, essentially equivalent notations for<br/>C# and the note a fifthtone or diesis higher.</p><p>In seeking to make a score for the Coimbra fifthtone piece using abcm2ps,<br/>a Linux utility available in many variations for a range of platforms, I<br/>resolved the problem of representing fifthtone steps by using a staccato<br/>mark as Vicentino&apos;s dot showing that a note is raised by a fifthtone --<br/>with the distinction that Vicentino places the dot above the note, while<br/>here it might go either above or below. Apart from this minor distinction,<br/>and my use of the Coimbra style of spelling (e.g. C#* rather than Db),<br/>abcm2ps can thus realize Vicentino&apos;s notation, applicable either to a<br/>31-note cycle (or subset) of 1/4-comma meantone, or to a precise 31-EDO.</p><p>Another solution, by the way, would be to use double flats and sharps, as<br/>I&apos;ve seen done in some modern transcriptions: thus C-Dbb-C#-Db-Cx-D -- the<br/>&quot;x&quot; here meaning a double sharp rather than the Coimbra fifthtone symbol.<br/>In a style where the staccato dot might be in demand for its usual<br/>meaning, this could be the best solution. I&apos;m indebted to a member of this<br/>group for an offline conversation pointing out to me this amenability of<br/>31-note meantone (1/4-comma or 31-EDO) to conventional notation.</p><p>Let me add, as you can hear, that this is a very beautiful piece. While<br/>Carpenter suggests a date around the third quarter of the 16th century,<br/>the same general epoch as Vicentino&apos;s publications, the style of<br/>dissonance treatment suggests to me something more around 1600, the epoch<br/>of Colonna. In fact, one of Colonna&apos;s idioms for which he gives a musical<br/>example, a &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; in fifthtones, occurs in this piece --<br/>sometimes with fifthtone shifts producing fifths or fourths altered by a<br/>diesis. Vicentino generally prefers that simultaneous fifths or fourths<br/>remain perfect, although he states that any dissonance might be justified<br/>in order aptly to express a text: here such altered intervals appear as<br/>part of a colorful instrumental style.</p><p>On some small points my reading here varies from Carpenter: a &quot;B#&quot; in his<br/>transcription at measure 27 (highest part) is here taken as B-natural<br/>(my hunch, with the excuse that in more conventional 16th-century contexts<br/>the sharp and natural symbols are sometimes interchangeable); at measure<br/>39, Hoyle credibly suggests that the B-natural at the end of the bar in<br/>the second to lowest voice might be only a placeholding symbol for the<br/>following B* (postulating a convention that a note with a fifthtone<br/>alteration must first be shown without such an alteration, e.g. B-B*).</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m pleased to present this keyboard piece in the<br/>medieval/Renaissance Phrygian mode (E-E octave), noteworthy for its bold<br/>beauty, with fifthtone steps only one aspect.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=11079 href="#11079">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2005 5:31:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks for posting this , especially with score as i always like looking while listening.<br/>The cadence sounds like a half cadence at the end even knowing it starts with a mode on e, a strange ending to your ear too? or do you think/know there is more that follows movement wise so a strongest cadence would not be desired</p><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;An intriguing keyboard piece possibly from around 1600 appears in a<br/>&gt;Portuguese manuscript (Coimbra Ms. Mus. 48) with symbols which Hoyle<br/>&gt;Carpenter has persuasive interpreted as marks raising a note by a meantone<br/>&gt;diesis or fifthtone of the kind described and embraced by Nicola Vicentino<br/>&gt;(1555, 1561) and Fabio Colonna (1618).

I can say that I<br/>routinely use it as a final cadence myself, and try to explain the musical<br/>cues I tend to follow, some of them which might be rather specific to a<br/>middle to late 16th-century style (or an early 17th-century style, since<br/>this piece might be from the era right around 1600).</p><p>First of all, as your comments suggest, there _is_ a potential and<br/>often creative ambiguity in the modal system, since A is the<br/>&quot;confinal&quot; or alternative focus of lots of phrases and cadences in an<br/>E mode (specifically the plagal form of the mode or Hypo-Phrygrian,<br/>with a typical range of B-E-B, with the final or resting note E in the<br/>middle of the octave range). At the same time, E is the confinal for<br/>an A or Aeolian mode (more specifically the authentic form with an<br/>octave built above the final, A-E-A).</p><p>Thus we have the question: is E pulling toward a final of A, or A toward a<br/>final of E? In this piece, I&apos;m satisfied with the latter answer. One cue<br/>is the use of major or minor thirds above the bass in vertical sonorities,<br/>the former more conclusive in Renaissance/Manneristic music evidently<br/>starting sometime around 1520-1530 (e.g. Pietro Aaron).</p><p>Thus in a final cadence from E to A in the bass, we&apos;d expect the<br/>concluding A sonority to have a major third (at or close to 4:5:6 in<br/>either JI or, as here, in meantone). I use C4 as middle C:</p><p>G#4 A4<br/>E4  E4<br/>B3  C#4<br/>E3  A2</p><p>(By the way, note the near-ideal spacing from Zarlino&apos;s point of view,<br/>who says that we should seek to follow the order of the &quot;sonorous<br/>numbers,&quot; with the major third ideally spaced as a 17th at 5:1, and<br/>next most harmoniously as a 5:2 tenth rather than a 5:4 third.)</p><p>Anyway, the final cadence from A to E generally has the first third<br/>above the bass minor, and the second major, lending more finality to<br/>the E.</p><p>A4  G#4<br/>E4  E4<br/>C4  B3<br/>A2  E3</p><p>In some ways, these two final cadences look almost &quot;time-reversed&quot;<br/>versions of each other, but the minor third above A in the second<br/>example is the notable asymmetry.</p><p>However, to say that I find this kind of E cadence satisfyingly final<br/>doesn&apos;t mean that it couldn&apos;t -- and isn&apos;t -- often used as an<br/>internal cadence in a piece on A; or vice versa, since the cadence on<br/>A is very common in pieces concluding on E. There is a certain poised<br/>balance: it could go either way.</p><p>Thank you for raising an intriguing musical issue, and your question<br/>raises another issue: given E-A and A-E as co-equal options, what<br/>clues in this piece or others might point toward one or the other<br/>expectation? This is a neat invitation to consider the piece more<br/>carefully, and others, in search of possible insights.</p><p>I&apos;m leaving for Los Angeles in a few hours, but wanted first to post a<br/>quick response. It&apos;s curious to recall after all these years that your<br/>reaction is the same as that of another accomplished keyboardist -- and to<br/>reflect that back then (c. 1977) I little idea what terms such as<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; meant, although discerning harpsichordists knew better.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=11087 href="#11087">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2005 10:45:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; An intriguing keyboard piece possibly from around 1600 appears in a<br/>&gt; Portuguese manuscript (Coimbra Ms. Mus. 48) with symbols which Hoyle<br/>&gt; Carpenter has persuasive interpreted as marks raising a note by a<br/>meantone<br/>&gt; diesis or fifthtone of the kind described and embraced by Nicola<br/>Vicentino<br/>&gt; (1555, 1561) and Fabio Colonna (1618).</p><p>Would you mind my using this information in a Wikipedia article?<br/>Someone needs to write one on 31 equal temperament, (and another on<br/>1/4 comma meantone), and if no one else does I will.</p><p>Links to the Coimbra files would also be nice.</p></div><h3><a id=11089 href="#11089">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2005 11:26:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 6 Dec 2005, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; An intriguing keyboard piece possibly from around 1600 appears in a<br/>&gt; Portuguese manuscript (Coimbra Ms. Mus. 48) with symbols which Hoyle<br/>&gt; Carpenter has persuasive interpreted as marks raising a note by a meantone<br/>&gt; diesis or fifthtone of the kind described and embraced by Nicola Vicentino<br/>&gt; (1555, 1561) and Fabio Colonna (1618).
