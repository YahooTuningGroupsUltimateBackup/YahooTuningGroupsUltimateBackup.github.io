The 2496 has support for ASIO<br/>drivers which, I&apos;m hearning, is necessary for use with the new<br/>softsynths...</p><p>Aside from Sibelius 3, one of the main aims of my use of this new<br/>machine will be exploration of microtonal softsynths, so I would like<br/>to make sure I&apos;m getting a card that will work with these...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>J.

That must have been a review for an early model Audiophile 2496 as the stats from the link Rick posted were poor.</p><p>One of the most important stats to examine when buying a sound card is its dynamic range.  This stat is a big determining factor on the quality of the card (and your recordings).

It is remarkably better than the Delta or Aardvark cards I previously used; to improve on it I&apos;d need to spend at least $2k for outboard converters;  The Benchmark DAC1 and ADC1 being high candidates there.  The nice thing about the LynxStudio card is that it also provides AES ins/outs that are necessary to connect external converters.</p><p>LynxStudio does offer the LS-22 which is a 2in/2out version, but that is still a little pricey (~$600), but so worth it if you don&apos;t need a lot of ins/outs.</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p></div><h3><a id=6147 href="#6147">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
