It sounded like an amateur attempting their first audio recording. If you want people to compare you to the pinnacle of movie making, you need to step up to the demands of the craft. Improve the quality and perhaps people will take you seriously.</p><p>Voice audio quality diminishes with the square of the distance between the speaker and the microphone. You put the microphone about 10 feet or more from you mouth, and as a result, it sounds terrible. Put it within 12 inches, closer if you can mask the pops and breath sounds.</p><p>&gt;&gt;#1.  I&apos;m trying to do a kind of Godardian thing.. In rethinking film and<br/>&gt;&gt;video syntax..  Traditionally if you where scoring a film.. you&apos;d want the score<br/>&gt;&gt; to never be self conscious...  Or to compete with other elements. In an early<br/>&gt;&gt; sequence in my video podcast I&apos;m talking about something.. While the music<br/>&gt;&gt; starts to build beneath..  not yet in any way masking what I&apos;m saying.. but it<br/>&gt;&gt; does, clearly.. start to compete for your attention..</p><p>Further, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; I want the cast to have a consumption pattern where you would listen to it<br/>&gt;&gt; multiple times.. In order to &quot;get everything&quot; and inside of that context..</p><p>I have no desire to listen to it again. Once was too many times. The quality is a real turn-off. What&apos;s with the guitar player licks? He looks like he is showing off. When he plays a particularly fast run, he looks at the camera as if to say, &quot;see how fast I can play?&quot;. Was he looking for approval here? His playing was self indulgent, and he couldn&apos;t keep up with the tempo of the audio in the background. Did he practice? Maybe a few more times would have been worth while.</p><p>Later:<br/>&gt;&gt; But I&apos;m afraid I tend<br/>&gt;&gt; to get easily married to the higher production value..</p><p>That&apos;s a joke, right? What high production value? This was recorded in a few minutes in a cluttered room. Is the listener supposed to consider that a production value?</p><p>I suggest you look at work of other video podcasters. Check the production values of Rocketboom. They started out with about $500 worth of equipment, and produced a high quality video show that people flocked to. Check out the sound stage: A $5.00 map in back of a desk.</p><p>Keep it up. Do more. But do shorter shows. The maximum people will download is less than 94mb. Try 20-30mb. Some can command more, but it is rare. I&apos;ve subscribed to your feed, and I continue to watch over time.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--<br/>Music that&apos;s &quot;Fake but Accurate&quot;!<br/>Web page: <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net</a><br/>Podcast: <a href="http://podcast1024.libsyn.com">http://podcast1024.libsyn.com</a><br/>Another Podcast: <a href="http://BumperMusic.blogspot.com">http://BumperMusic.blogspot.com</a><br/>Music: <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers</a></p></div>
