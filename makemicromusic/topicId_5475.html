I&apos;d love to report on the tuning implementation/editor, but the NI demo is only version 1.2, which doesn&apos;t have micro support. I&apos;ll keep bugging them to get a 2.0 demo so someone can try it.</p><p>Native Instrument&apos;s Absynth 2.0 is an amazing synth, but not one if you are wanting to have it sound like pianos, banjos, clarinets, etc. But if you want it to sound like... something else...</p><p>All that said, here is a paragraph from a recent review on <a href="http://audiomidi.com">audiomidi.com</a>:</p><p>&quot;Microtuning<br/>------------<br/>Absynth might well be a microtonalist&apos;s dream! While earlier versions showed a glimmer of promise, tuning was restricted to a collection of preset factory tunings. The new version is fully tuneable. This means that every one of the 128 possible MIDI notes can be individually tuned, with a theoretical precision of at least one thousandth of a cent! (The user interface actually goes down to a millionth, but I was unable to verify that.) Repeating, equal tempered scales can also be easily programmed. To understand how simple but revolutionary this tuning system is, consider that the majority of other instruments (both hardware and software) limit their microtuning to repeating octaves. Even those with &quot;full keyboard&quot; tuning often constrain the detuning of each note to 50 or 100 cents from its nominal pitch. The final frustration is that many of these instruments have tuning precision coarser than one cent. Not so Absynth! I&apos;m recommending it to my microtonalist friends, even the fussy ones.&quot;</p><p>Intriguing, eh?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2003 11:02:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On the oddmusic group, a member there says he uses Absynth now for<br/>microtonal work.  I guess he must be talking about the latest<br/>version.  His post was in response to my post about the relatively<br/>sparse selection of microtonal soft synths for the Mac OS X<br/>platform.  He also suggested I look into using something like CSound<br/>to generate tuned samples for use with a sampler (hardware or<br/>software) that can map individual samples per note.  I have the<br/>Emagic EXSP-24 sample player so I may look into that.</p><p>I&apos;m also holding out a bit for Glenn Olander to add microtuning<br/>capability to Crystal, a free soft synth that appears to have much of<br/>the same functionality as Absynth (a $300 retail product) - semi-<br/>modular architecture, granular synthesis, etc.  CronoX-plus-VST-to-AU<br/>wrapper remains a consideration as well.  It&apos;s just I&apos;ve been so busy<br/>practicing viola lately, having recently joined a church orchestra...</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
