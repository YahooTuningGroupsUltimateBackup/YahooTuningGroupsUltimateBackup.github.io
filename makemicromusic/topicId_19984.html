All composers - All videographers - a new call for works</p><p>Vox Novus is the brain child of Robert Voisey. He assembles CD&apos;s and<br/>concerts of 60 second compositions by 60 different composers, called<br/>60x60. Recently he worked with some dancers to accompany a 60x60<br/>concert with 60 dances by 60 choreographers at theWinter Garden of the<br/>World Financial Center in NYC. A review in the NY Times was quite<br/>complementary.</p><p>Robert writes with a new call for works:</p><p>Did I forget to mention that there is another call for 60x60? Yes!<br/>With all the excitement I forgot to mention that there is a new call<br/>for 60 second works on recorded media. Here is the link:<br/><a href="http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/Call.htm">http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/Call.htm</a></p><p>BUT WAIT! There&apos;s more!</p><p>In conjunction with New Media New Music New England We are lookiing<br/>for video too! Visit the following for details:<br/><a href="http://www.nmnmne.org/what_if.html">http://www.nmnmne.org/what_if.html</a></p><p>I contributed one piece that was accepted in a Pacific Rim 60x60 mix,<br/>and highly recommend others do the same. 60 seconds can really focus<br/>the mind. And to hear your work played next to someone else&apos;s is<br/>fascinating.</p><p>More here:<br/><a href="http://bumpermusic.blogspot.com/2008/11/60x60-call-for-works.html">http://bumpermusic.blogspot.com/2008/11/60x60-call-for-works.html</a></p></div>
