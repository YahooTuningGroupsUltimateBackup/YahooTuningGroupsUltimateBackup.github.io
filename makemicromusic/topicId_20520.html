The tuning here is a combined 10-20 and 14-28 overtone series segments notated across two octaves.</p><p>Over the Rivers---------&gt;<br/><a href="https://download.yousendit.com/TTZscHBEb0JGR0ZFQlE9PQ">https://download.yousendit.com/TTZscHBEb0JGR0ZFQlE9PQ</a><br/>A direct homage dedicated to Ives using his language a bit more obliquely (well at least compared to the last piece), but still slavishly and overtly--but hopefully ,respectfully. Anyway, the tuning here is the fearsome and dreaded 11-tone equal temperament taken mostly as a 6-out-of-11 scale.</p><p>Daniel</p></div>
