Heard of the iPod? And if *anyone* wondered just how solidly the mp3 format has taken hold, one only need read one of today&apos;s new items, whereby Sony - who for years and years has supported *only* their own proprietary encoding format, ATRAC - is now actively considering support for mp3 files on their next generation Walkman devices, most assuredly trying to tap into the iPod market.

And, in the case of<br/>patents, so should legal and philosophical issues. And the utter beauty and<br/>subversion of open source. I say stick it to patent weenie assholes.</p><p>I think ogg sounds better at the same quality settings than mp3 does. Compare<br/>them at the Ogg Vorbis web page if you don&apos;t believe me. Also, I resent, as a<br/>Linux user, the kind of mentality that goes around saying, &apos;this page is best<br/>viewed in IE&apos;. Linux is coming from behind to be a bigger threat to MS than<br/>Apple, precisely because it&apos;s dedicated users didn&apos;t cave to the BS of the<br/>&apos;ubiquitousness argument&apos;. Britney Spears is ubiquitous. Big fucking deal.</p><p>Things that are ubiquitous are rarely the best things, and are also so mostly<br/>because people are too lazy to care to change, install new software,<br/>whatever. If enough people start using ogg for its virtues, then more people<br/>will consider it a viable alternative.</p><p>Anyway, I feel that I do might small part encouraging an open-source solution<br/>to an audio/ethical problem by posting ogg files.</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s just me, but I think this corporate culture of<br/>Microsoft/Halliburton  takes all just plain sucks, and yes, I believe in<br/>doing my small part to support the openness and beauty of the open source<br/>model. I like subversive ideas, and a patent-free audio format that sounds<br/>better than a corporate alternative will get my support.</p><p>I&apos;m with Gene with this one, although to be fair, using mp3 has points in its<br/>favor. It&apos;s a personal choice. But please, how hard is it to download ogg<br/>extensions to a player, or an ogg player? C&apos;mon....jumping all over Gene for<br/>that doesn&apos;t make sense. I have to download different shit all the time for<br/>the multiple video/audio formats all the time. It takes literally 5 minutes<br/>at most. How lazy can we get?</p><p>Could we perhaps stop the back and forth nastiness, though?</p><p>My 2 cents.</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>P.S. Having said that, I reserve the right to post whatever I want--.mp3<br/>or .ogg, as I see fit. In balance, I do want listeners. At least there are<br/>free mp3 encoders.

I don&apos;t think portable players are a big deal to the sort of<br/>people who are likely to be interested in downloading my stuff, but if<br/>they want to take their music jogging, there are portables which play<br/>ogg wma aac etc as well as mp3. You seem to think ogg is something<br/>like mpc, which isn&apos;t yet well supported. Ogg files are really not a<br/>problem, even if you insist on using a hardware device you can find<br/>one. And of course, anyone is free to convert an ogg to a wav if they<br/>choose.</p><p>I&apos;ve asked what is the big deal.

One of the things that has been consistent in the underlying general topic - proprietary vs. open source - is the assumption that someone like me (from my postings earlier) either doesn&apos;t like open source, prefers $$$-ware, or has some other agenda. Nothing could be further from the truth, because I am speaking to one issue and one issue only: how one chooses to encode music for download by listeners.</p><p>I use a lot of open source applications and tools, and try to get as many people to do so as well. I publicly thank Carl Lumma for twisting my arm on .ogg, which I use a lot since that time, and archive a fair amount of music with it, though I still do even more in mp3 because that is the format supported by my mp3 player (hardware), and that piece of gear has been worth it&apos;s weight in gold for music pleasure/study.</p><p>As for quality issues, the difference between similar encodings of mp3 and ogg are an awful lot closer than the best encoding vs. non-encoded music. If you really care about all the fidelity, all the invisible nuances that aren&apos;t just in the music but in the surrounding air of the mix, then nothing is a substitute for full-spectrum, uncompressed audio.</p><p>The only point I see in all of this is What Path Will Lead Your Music To The Most Listeners. If you want to mount a crusade, fine. But as someone who has administered websites that have had (by virtue of their mission) broad and deep audiences, I must stick with the point of view that you do the best service to your audience by reaching as many of them as possible, with as little effort on their part as possible. Are there better audio formats? Without a doubt. Is it rather unbelievable that people don&apos;t want to load yet another app, or install another plugin?

I would never argue with someone who asserts that their music suffers so much as to require a differing format, you, Gene, or anyone else. You *are* left with the situation of educating your audience and dealing with those that aren&apos;t set up for your given format - how this is handled is critical to their receptivity to your work.
