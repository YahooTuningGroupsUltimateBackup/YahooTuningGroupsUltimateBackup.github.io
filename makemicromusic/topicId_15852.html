You can go to &quot;File | Reference Pitch&quot; to<br/>change that ... but BE SURE TO TYPE THE KEYBOARD<br/>&apos;ENTER&apos; KEY WHILE THE MOUSE IS POSITIONED OVER<br/>THE SLIDER! in order to have Tonescape accept the change.</p><p>You can download Tonescape from my website homepage.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
