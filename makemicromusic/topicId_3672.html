Now<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering around on this groups looking for help....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got a korg N5, now I don&apos;t know much about how scala sends the<br/>&gt; scales to the synths, I set the synth to MIDI Standard Tuning and<br/>&gt; nothing happened. I&apos;m not a MIDI genius and I still didn&apos;t figure out<br/>&gt; completely how the sysex messages work on this process of sending and<br/>&gt; importing the scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do I have to know all about sysex and program my own messages so I<br/>&gt; can re-tune my keyboard, can you help with any information or<br/>&gt; redirect me somewhere so I can find out if I have limits on N5, or if<br/>&gt; I have to do something special so it can work with Scala?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks a bunch<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; decuritiba@...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Alex, John L. is right. You&apos;re going to have to send SysEx using your sequencer (or some other softwrae app). It&apos;s not that difficult to learn. Though the SysEx chart in the manual can seem very cryptic. In essence you have to send one SysEx message string per note, for each of the 12 notes. At least my NS5R only has 12-note scale tuning, which I think is probably what the N5 has. The range is 00..40..7F (-64..00..+63 cent using a range from 0..64..127 in hexadecimal, base-16 numbers). This is per channel, so you could have as many 12-note scales tuned simultaneously as you have channels - the NS5R has 32.</p><p>The message format for the NS5R is:<br/>F0 42 3n 42 12 a1 a2 a3 d...F7</p><p>n = SysEx transmit channel, a = address, d = value</p><p>So to tune the &apos;C#&apos; note on channel 1, +10 cents, I use this:</p><p>F0 42 30 42 12 01 00 33 4A F7</p><p>30 is channel 1 on which the SysEx is being transmitted (the 16 channels are numbered 30 through 3F in hexadecimal), 01 00 33 is the C# (with the 00 being channel 1, on which I want the note to be changed), and 4A is the number 74, which is what I want since 64 is the 0, neutral position.</p><p>The information is listed under &lt;Part Parameters&gt;, the notes are listed C through B, 01 nn 32 through 01 nn 3D, where nn is the channel on which you want the tuning change.</p><p>I cannot fathom the stupidity of not making *all* functions accessible from the front panel !</p><p>Manuel is right too, at least the NS5R recognises native NS5R, XG, and GS scale tuning messages, which ofcourse helps with Scala. And, I think there could be another method to send the change as well, using NRPNs or something, though I haven&apos;t looked into it.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this is of help. Good luck !</p><p>- Joel</p></div><h3><a id=3673 href="#3673">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
