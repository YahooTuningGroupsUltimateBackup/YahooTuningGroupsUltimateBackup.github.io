IIRC, after pages of tables of permuted<br/>&gt; tetrachords,<br/>&gt; S said that only those approximated by the 17-tone cycle of fifths scale<br/>&gt; were in use in<br/>&gt; his day.</p><p>&gt; In general, the Greeks put the smallest intervals at the bottom of the<br/>&gt; tetrachord and the<br/>&gt; largest on top, though there are are exceptions  such as Archytas&apos;s<br/>&gt; 28/27 x 8/7 x 9/8, 28/27 x 36/35 x 5/4, and Didymos&apos;s 16/15 x 25/24 x<br/>&gt; 6/5. In these cases, the choice of the first interval<br/>&gt; may have depended upon the interval it made with a note a 9/8 below the<br/>&gt; first note of the tetrachord (mese for the diezeugmenon tetrachord,<br/>&gt; proslambanomenos for hypaton, and an extra note, diatonic lichanos<br/>&gt; hypaton or hyperhypate, for the meson). The use of this composite<br/>&gt; interval appears to have been a standard stylistic feature of music in<br/>&gt; the enharmonic and chromatic genera.</p><p>&gt; There is good reason to believe that the so-called &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning<br/>&gt; of the diatonic<br/>&gt; genus was the oldest scale in Greek art music (see Franklin&apos;s<br/>&gt; dissertation) and that the enharmonic derived from 5-toned folk scales<br/>&gt; of the semitone-Major third (ditone) type.<br/>&gt; This scale is derivable from the diatonic by gapping, of course. The<br/>&gt; chromatic genus developed<br/>&gt; from the enharmonic, which became heptatonic only around the end of the<br/>&gt; 4th century BCE and<br/>&gt; the beginning of the 3rd. Stopping half-way between the enharmonic and<br/>&gt; chromatic produces<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos&apos;s hemiolic chromatic (75 + 75 + 350 cents), giving another<br/>&gt; example of the neutral third.</p><p>&gt; I suggest that the neutral diatonic type of scale such as Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>&gt; Equable or Even Diatonic, Al-Farabi&apos;s reduplicated 3/4-tone genera, etc.<br/>&gt; are not Greek, but possibly of African or Arabian origin. I think<br/>&gt; Ptolemy heard them in Alexandria, which was the most cosmopolitan city<br/>&gt; in the eastern Mediterranean area in the 2nd century CE. In addition to<br/>&gt; large Greek and  Egyptian population, there were Romans, Jews, Arabs,<br/>&gt; Ethiopians, Persians, etc., and even Buddhist missionaries from India<br/>&gt; living and trading there.</p><p>&gt; --John</p></div>
