AND it&apos;s about the microtonal languages of *our* time.</p><p>Very important point: of *our* time. If we ape the past, if we emulate the academic or prosaic precursors, we will fail to connect.</p><p>&gt;If this art form is going to ever reach many more people in the 12 tET &gt;world of sound, then some seriously beautiful music has got to get made. I &gt;like to fancy that perhaps the core of 65 folks we&apos;ve got assembled here &gt;may represent some kind of new step in that kind of direction.</p><p>When I started this forum, I did it with the counsel of my two valued colleagues, Jacky and Margo Schulter; I&apos;ve said it before, and I&apos;ll say it again: their wise thoughts have guided me on more than one occasion in the couple of months since inception.</p><p>And I started Creating/Making Microtonal Music because I saw need to open a space for those that were truly interested in active, fervent playing/composing/creating. In other places, it was not the primary function, but a secondary exposition of effort. Valid elsewhere, not a modus operandi here. So, in a few minutes there will be a short &quot;Part 2&quot; post - explaining about <a href="http://www.microtonal.org">www.microtonal.org</a> - but you&apos;ll see that in a couple of messages in the future.</p><p>I&apos;m rambling, and it&apos;s approaching late, but I want you all to know that we can do something here. Or you can do *something* out *there*.</p><p>But we exist to do something.</p><p>Soon,<br/>Mom</p></div>
