It affects<br/>the timbre you get when you play without the pedal held down.</p><p>The amount of acceleration or deceleration as you press the key affects<br/>the quality of the note.</p><p>The reason is that as you press the key, often there are two pointe<br/>where things happen like this</p><p>time line:</p><p>Start pressing key ... Hammer enters free motion ... damper lifts</p><p>Once the hammer enters free motion you can&apos;t affect its velocity<br/>But you can delay the lifting of the damper. If you decelerate<br/>then the damper can stay on the string for just long enough to<br/>dampen the attack, giving a soft cantabile sound. If you<br/>accelerate then it lifts promptly so that the attack doesn&apos;t get<br/>dampened at all and you get a bright attack.</p><p>With some pianos it is possible to find a position between<br/>those two stages and when you press the key, abruptly stop<br/>at that point. The result is that the note still sounds<br/>but is totally damped as the damper never lifts from the<br/>string - quite an interesteing effect. You can play<br/>melodies entirely in that fashion, and they don&apos;t need to<br/>be played quietly, it&apos;s quite possible to play forte and totally<br/>damped (maybe I was lucky in the piano I was experimenting<br/>with?).</p><p>You could use this to some effect I&apos;m sure as long as the<br/>dampers are not completely raised from the string.<br/>I think this may be something to do with why some players feel<br/>they can vary the touch so much on a piano with notes<br/>at the same velocity.</p><p>Some pianos seem to have it the other way round:</p><p>Start pressing key ... damper lifts ... Hammer enters free motion</p><p>in which case you can&apos;t do this. Those pianos have a more<br/>uniform kind of a feel to them, you have more of the same<br/>tone quality all the time (maybe a nice cantabile or whatever<br/>but you can&apos;t vary it in quite the same way).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
