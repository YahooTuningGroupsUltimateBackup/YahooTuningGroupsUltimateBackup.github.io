It is open source. <a href="http://www.modplug.com">www.modplug.com</a> should get you there.</p><p>A side note; I think all tracker software supports playing on a pc keyboard.  Modplug is just the only one I know that supports alternate tunings.</p><p>Chris<br/>*</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt;<br/>Sender: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:06:08<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:makemicromusic@yahoogroups.com">makemicromusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [MMM] Playing music with a computer keyboard?</p><p>I feel like this has been asked before, but I&apos;m not seeing it: Is<br/>there a program that allows me to try different tunings using keys on<br/>my computer keyboard?

I use Scala all the time, and use it to provide the .tbl files needed to render via Timidity (for which I&apos;m grateful to Gene), but I haven&apos;t seen how to map my PC keyboard to it as if it were a controller. I will definitely check that out.<br/>Thanks, Dr Oz!</p><p>Sent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt;<br/>Sender: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Fri, 21 Sep 2012 00:09:25<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Playing music with a computer keyboard?</p><p>Scala by Manuel op de Coul can do it if you tinker it enough, with any kind of keyboard mapping you may assign your PC keyboard as a settings file to be loaded next to any tuning.
