There is extreme<br/>value this time around - not sure why but who cares. You get more tools and<br/>new ways of making music like the Matrix view. There are many usability<br/>features in handling VST VSTi and audio - for instance you don&apos;t have to<br/>restart anymore when you muck with your audio settings.</p><p>I&apos;m running 8.5 on both quad and  dual core machines and it simply rocks.</p><p>I went from 7 to 8.5 and I&apos;m simply blown away.</p><p>Reaper seems to be a nice product - but it is something that wants to be<br/>what Sonar is IMHO. Since you are on the upgrade path your cost is<br/>competitive verses the value you will receive, again, imho.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sun, Feb 7, 2010 at 10:28 PM, jonszanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl mentioned Reaper.
