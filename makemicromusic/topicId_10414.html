Opened to the<br/>public in 1989, it is a performance space, art gallery, craft studio, caf&eacute;-bar and garden<br/>with on-site parking. It is<br/>close to Walton town centre and within a short walk of the Thames path and a number of<br/>attractive riverside pubs.<br/>There is bed and breakfast accommodation, very reasonably priced, nearby. Walton is<br/>around 30 mins from<br/>London Waterloo and river riverhouse house is close to the M25. river riverhouse house is<br/>approximately 20 mins walk from Walton<br/>station; taxis to river riverhouse house normally cost less than &pound;5.<br/>What is microtonal music?<br/>The most concise definition of microtonal music is music which uses pitches other than<br/>the 12 equally spaced pitches<br/>normally heard in western music or their very close relations (like the ones used in the<br/>temperaments of Baroque<br/>music such as Meantone Temperament Temperament). ). Such music is not particularly<br/>rare. We know that the ancient Greeks used<br/>structured intervals as small as a quarter-tone, so do many folk musics from around the<br/>world and Indian classical<br/>music.<br/>Quarter-tones are by far the most commonly used of these smaller intervals. A quarter-<br/>tone is exactly half the size of<br/>a semitone, an interval which therefore doesn&apos;t exist on the piano but which can be played<br/>on all the orchestral<br/>instruments with practice. Quarter-tones can also be played on specially adapted<br/>instruments such as guitars or<br/>brasses with an added fourth, quarter-tone valve.<br/>The expanded palette of sounds which becomes available through microtones is being<br/>sought more and more by<br/>composers and as well as quarter-tones, in UK MicroFest 1 you can hear many other<br/>possibilities realised by<br/>performers of exceptional ability.<br/>Microtonal music is not concerned with any particular style of music, or any particular<br/>musical culture. Indeed, many<br/>of the most interesting microtonalists in the 20th century were maverick figures who<br/>operated outside the normal<br/>music hierarchy. We hope you will come and join us ...<br/>sponsored and promoted by Microtonal Projects Ltd <a href="http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk">www.microtonalprojects.co.uk</a><br/>Financial assistance from The RVW Trust and The Hinrichsen Foundation</p><p>Friday 14 October, 2005<br/>river riverhouse house will be open for lunch from 11.45am<br/>Day Session 1: 1.00pm-5.15pm<br/>Â• 1.00pm-1.40pm<br/>Composing for Quarter-Tone Alto Flute*<br/>Carla Rees and David Burnand introduce the Kingma quarter-tone alto flute: performances<br/>of Night Scene by<br/>David Burnand and Apparition and Release by Michael Oliva performed by rarescale (Carla<br/>Rees and Michael<br/>Oliva)<br/>Â• 1.45pm-2.15pm<br/>The Rosegarden Codicil: Rehearsal Strategies in 19-ET*<br/>Prof. Graham Hair, composer; Dr Nicholas J.
