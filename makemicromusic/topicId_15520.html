RIFF WAVE files don&apos;t have to be 16 bits and 44100<br/>samples per second. The number of bits per sample can be any 16-bit<br/>number (so the maximum is 65535 bits per sample) and the sampling rate<br/>can be any 32-bit number (so the maximum sampling rate is 4.29<br/>gigahertz).

It means you can apply a digital filter and down-sample to get the true 48kHz signal.</p><p>Beats can get lost with low sample rates, so this may be important for some uses of alternative tunings.</p><p>Csound uses floating point numbers for audio, which is even better for mastering because you don&apos;t have to worry about maximizing the levels. You can record audio files in floating point format.  There are optional 64-bit builds as well.  If you can hear the difference over 32 bits (some claim to) it&apos;s probably because of bugs in the system.
