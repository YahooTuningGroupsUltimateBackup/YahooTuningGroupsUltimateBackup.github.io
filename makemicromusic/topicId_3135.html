However I didn&apos;t use it here, but<br/>just used the pitches exactly as FTS found them in the<br/>recording, in the order played. So it is a non ascending<br/>scale. Since the first and last notes are 186 cents apart,<br/>it means the scale repeats at an interval of 186 cents<br/>for the non octave repeat.</p><p>Scroll to the bottom of the page to find it.<br/><a href="http://robertinventor.com/fractal_melody_sound_clips/index.htm">http://robertinventor.com/fractal_melody_sound_clips/index.htm</a></p><p>I haven&apos;t uploaded it yet - a bit to do. This was done<br/>using the wave counting method, with a new idea - the tricky<br/>thing about the wave counting is to decide which of the<br/>zero crossings are for the beginning of the wave form<br/>and which are just secondary wavelets in the middle of<br/>it. So the new idea was to search for waves similar in<br/>shape - if you look at a recording ,often each wave<br/>is very similar in shape to the next, even though<br/>the shape can be quite complex - and the shape changes<br/>slowly, but each individual wave is very like the very<br/>next one.</p><p>Anyway, it works well enough to make quite a difference<br/>though certainly more can be done on it.</p><p>The FFT approach has an option to look for harmonic series<br/>partials, which works well with e.g. string timbres.<br/>However I have a little work to do on that too.</p><p>This is the last main section that I needed to complete<br/>for the release, after which there are few loose ends<br/>apart from need for a bit more in the help, which I&apos;ll<br/>do after the release,</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
