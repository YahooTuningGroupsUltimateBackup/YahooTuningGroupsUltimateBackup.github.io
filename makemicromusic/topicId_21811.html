I seem to sense incremental growth in almost every piece of yours, either through the sophistication of the tuning moves, or the better sounding &apos;mixes&apos;, etc.</p><p>With your latest iteration of mallet ensembles, you know what I&apos;d love to hear? I don&apos;t know enough about the Csound processing of the scores, but it would be killer if there could be one final pass before the score gets transformed into actual sound where a &apos;humanize&apos; algorithm could be applied.</p><p>The thing that I hear is that in all this rhythmic motion, all the simultaneous attacks that fall together Really Do Fall Together - in a way that no &apos;natural&apos; ensemble could do. I&apos;m willing to bet if you could have just a few notes ghosting a hair before or after the beat (or unison stroke/attack), it would go a long way into the final breath of virtual performance. As it is, the rubato you have in this piece is really very well done. If we could only lose just a fraction of the totally quantized feel, it would be smashing.</p><p>But, you know, just IMHO. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=21816 href="#21816">ðŸ”—</a>prentrodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2010 9:16:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,<br/>Thanks for listening.
