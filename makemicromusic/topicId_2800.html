The earlier music<br/>&gt; used a template of the first 6 partials, mapped to 11 EDO, but the<br/>&gt; piece and the fifths example above uses a timbre mapped to 11 EDO,<br/>&gt; using only the odd partials.</p><p>I think the second one makes the first sound better.  Probably because I<br/>much prefer the first few seconds with the new timbre.  And it sounds less<br/>like a real gamelan.</p><p>&gt; Let me know what you think, as your input would be held in highest<br/>&gt; regard. Especially comments about the perceived smoothness of the<br/>&gt; fifths examples. (They are quite small to download, so effortless to<br/>&gt; hear)</p><p>New fifths are smoother, yes.  Also, they alternate rough/smooth in that<br/>example.  Is it an illusion, or are they tuned differently?</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2804 href="#2804">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/3/2002 5:42:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;aatt0s+bkup@...&gt;<br/>jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; It was probably a really poor choice for the label on the file to<br/>&gt; call it Gamelan. About as bad as calling it raga I&apos;d guess. Wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really trying to sound exactly like Gamelan, but somehow it reminded<br/>&gt; me remotely of it. I&apos;ll reflect more deeply about titles in the<br/>&gt; future, considering that they may project a meaning not actually<br/>&gt; intended.</p><p>Probably it would have sounded like a gamelan whatever you called it.  But<br/>the new timbres make it sound more individual.</p><p>&gt; 1.  Even though I reduced the decay time for the fifths examples, so<br/>&gt; to avoid the sound overlapping on itself as I changed from chord to<br/>&gt; chord, still there was a little overlap.</p><p>I think the first two are like that.  Perhaps it skewed my perception of<br/>the rest.</p><p>&gt; 2. The TX802 has amplitude scaling for each operator, which affects<br/>&gt; the timbre as one plays across the keyboard. Here this is set to a<br/>&gt; very subtle curve, but it could cause this.</p><p>It might be something to do with the resolution of the tuning tables.  Or<br/>even aliasing.</p><p>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t you have a Kurzweil additive synth?</p><p>No, not me.  I have Kyma.  It does additive synthesis, but it&apos;s quite<br/>processor hungry so I usually use other algorithms.  I have set up some<br/>phi timbres and posted some examples somewhere.  And didn&apos;t I duplicate<br/>one of your timbres once?</p><p>&gt; Does it allow you to set the partials to any desired non-integer<br/>&gt; multiples of the fundamental?</p><p>Kyma, yes.  You can even set them as Smalltalk expressions.</p><p>&gt; I wish I had some kind of synth that would give me at least 32 sine<br/>&gt; waves that could be tuned any way one desired. This would be a<br/>&gt; fantastic tool for this kind of thing. Working with FM can be tricky.<br/>&gt; So many variables play into the resulting spectra - especially in the<br/>&gt; case of the TX802, where there are 6 ops, and 32 possible algos. It<br/>&gt; can be exceedingly difficult to predict the resulting wave form for<br/>&gt; each and all of the algo configurations. Life would be made much<br/>&gt; easier with an instrument which had a bank of arbitrarily tunable<br/>&gt; sine waves to use for this kind of spectral tuning.</p><p>FM&apos;s great if you go with the flow, and don&apos;t worry if your predictions<br/>turn out wrong.  If you want additive timbres, CSound can do it.  Maybe<br/>not in real time, but you should be able to generate files for use with a<br/>soft sampler.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2815 href="#2815">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2002 9:29:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It was probably a really poor choice for the label on the file to<br/>&gt; call it Gamelan.
