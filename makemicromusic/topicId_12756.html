Or two, depending on how much I get.<br/>&gt; &gt; Chuckk Hubbard biggiantharp.mp3 - Grabs you from the first 10 seconds<br/>&gt; and never lets go<br/>&gt; &gt; FMscape1.mp3 - I can&apos;t remember where I found this, but it&apos;s great<br/>&gt; stuff - I&apos;ll play the first 3 minutes of it unless I hear otherwise.<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene Ward Smith dreyfus new font.mp3 - I plan to take the first 5<br/>&gt; minutes. Sit back and be ready to get bathed in microtonality.<br/>&gt; &gt; Jacob Barton funwithxenharmonicity+hyperimprovisationtasty.mp3 - I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t had a chance to listen at real time speed to this, but I like<br/>&gt; the 2x. Have to cut it at 4:30 or so to allow more in. And what<br/>&gt; follows is even better...<br/>&gt; &gt; Untravelled Path sweetheresy-sampler.mp3 - nice acoustic bass finger<br/>&gt; piano work - came in through Jeff Harrington&apos;s reblog &gt; <a href="http://hollowtreestudios.blogspot.com/2006/03/review-sweet-heresy-by-untravelled.html">http://hollowtreestudios.blogspot.com/2006/03/review-sweet-heresy-by-untravelled.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; one of these: Bill Sethares clariphonicsgroup2.mp3 -<br/>&gt; &#x9;Bill Sethares clariphonicsgroup2b.mp3<br/>&gt; &#x9;Bill Sethares clariphonicsgroup4.mp3 - help me choose.<br/>&gt; &gt; Arthur B.
