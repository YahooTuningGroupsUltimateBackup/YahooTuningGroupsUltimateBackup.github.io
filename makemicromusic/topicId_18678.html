The<br/>evening was momentous in a way in that it consisted of the first full<br/>performance of Plectra and Percussion Dances, an hour long work of<br/>music for dance and other potential collaborations, since it was<br/>originally premiered during a live radio broadcast in 1953. In fact,<br/>the performance included the recorded elements of the original<br/>broadcast such as Partch&apos;s own introduction to the three segments of<br/>the work. The piece deals with a variety of themes based on mythology<br/>but has a much broader agenda and sense of humor about topics of life<br/>and death on the whole.</p><p>Read the whole thing.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
