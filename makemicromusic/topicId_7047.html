Maybe it&apos;s best taken off-list.</p><p>The first decision to make is to decide whether you<br/>want a desktop or a laptop.  You&apos;ll get a lot more<br/>bang for your buck out of a desktop, but you get<br/>obvious flexibility out of a laptop.  I got my first<br/>laptop 4 years ago -- the IBM Thinkpad X20 I&apos;m typing<br/>this on today.  It&apos;s been great, and I&apos;ll never go<br/>back to desktops, but it isn&apos;t all roses.</p><p>The next decision is platform: Apple, PC, or Mac?<br/>In the music industry, Apple is king.  But PCs are<br/>faster per dollar, and faster in the limit.  Also<br/>there&apos;s much more pirated software available for<br/>PCs than Macs, if that&apos;s a consideration (you think<br/>the hardware is expensive!).</p><p>The Linux alternative is nice, but there aren&apos;t a<br/>lot of pro-level audio apps out there.  However,<br/>you won&apos;t have the guilt of piracy on your shoulders,<br/>and there are some great little tools that can be<br/>used to get professional results.</p><p>Another thing is to think what you&apos;ll use it for.<br/>Software synthesis?  Score entry?  MIDI sequencing?<br/>Audio sequencing?  All of the above?  Will you want<br/>to use it live on stage?</p><p>In PCs, good brands are Dell, IBM, Toshiba, and<br/>Sony.  If you get a laptop, your best bet is a<br/>&quot;Pentium M 775&quot; system.  With Apple, be sure to<br/>get something with at least one G5 in it.  No matter<br/>what you buy, your best spent dollars are on RAM,<br/>up to a gigabyte at least.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7054 href="#7054">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2004 5:24:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote...</p><p>&gt; The Linux alternative is nice, but there aren&apos;t a<br/>&gt; lot of pro-level audio apps out there.

In a recent thread on PC laptop recommendations, the<br/>eMachine brand was recommended over and over again.

What would you all recommend? Making music is pretty &gt;much the only thing I want to use it for.</p><p>My laptop is a couple years old now, and I built a mini-pc (still portable, just not a laptop) custom for music. But I can offer the following:</p><p>The Audiophile 24/96 Firewire audio card continues to get good marks, both for sound quality and excellent performance.</p><p>As far as the computer itself, I suggest writing Alison Monteith directly, as she had a laptop custom-configured for musis (I believe she uses the above sound card) and has been working with it now for at least a year. Nothing like someone who is doing exactly what you want to do to be of help.</p><p>The only other thing is whether or not you want to get an Apple. I&apos;ve never owned one, but I have recently given serious thought to one. The only downside is the smaller amount of music software, but what is there is quality, and outside of micro stuff you&apos;ll find all very solid applications. A composer/sound designer from NY that I worked with here in San Diego for the Old Globe Theatre had *everything* on it: Pro Tools, all his samples, etc. When what went down at a recording studio in 8 hours got thrown out by the director, he created an entire score on the laptop, including using the perc I recorded at the session.</p><p>And take your time and make sure you get what you want.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7074 href="#7074">ðŸ”—</a>Catharsis &#x3C;catharsis@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2004 11:00:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 04:59 AM 7/9/2004, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m thinking laptop.

For an audio interface I&apos;m looking at the new RME Firewire 800...  Hot stuff...  Granted the above will carry a $$ tag and won&apos;t hit the mainstream market until next May or so...</p><p>As far as acquiring said laptop... I&apos;m going to be looking at getting it directly from the manufacturer.. IE companies like Clevo, etc.</p><p>Can&apos;t recall if I mentioned that I&apos;ll be speaking out at ICMC.. If anyone is going from here I&apos;d be glad to share a room due to expense of travel.</p><p>Just spoke at Sun&apos;s JavaOne and rocked it..

Of course, powerful graphics aren&apos;t important for<br/>music, and can eat battery like crazy.</p><p>The other thing to wait for in the fall is Intel&apos;s new (and maybe<br/>even useable!) onboard sound for laptops...</p><p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/16/intel_hd_audio/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/16/intel_hd_audio/</a></p><p>...but wait, it&apos;s part of Alviso, which has been pushed back<br/>to &apos;05...</p><p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/16/intel_centrino_2_delay/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/16/intel_centrino_2_delay/</a></p><p>...such is the way of things.

It&apos;s microphones<br/>and instruments that should be doing the A/D conversion!</p><p>I was going to mention that IBM Thinkpads are my choice for<br/>laptops.  They&apos;re expensive, but you get what you pay for.<br/>But one drawback is, they don&apos;t have FireWire.  The good news<br/>is, USB 2 audio interfaces should be hitting the market in<br/>earnest later this year.
