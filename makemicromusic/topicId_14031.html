More to the point, I just got it<br/>to make microtonal music with very little effort:</p><p>1) using not the (excellent) command-line interface but the<br/>&quot;context-sensitive, on-the-fly programming environ/mentality&quot;<br/>miniAudion (only for osx at the moment)</p><p>2) using simple example code<br/>(<a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/examples/midi/polyfony.ck">http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/examples/midi/polyfony.ck</a>) I was<br/>easily able to interface chucK through OSX&apos;s inter-application<br/>communication MIDI bus</p><p>3) opened up the average midi sequencer (Metro SE) and fooled around<br/>with the note-input tool, you know, running up and down chromatically,<br/>hearing the results with imperceptible-to-me latency (although it<br/>starts losing notes if I squiggle too fast)</p><p>4) found the line in the code that converts midi note number into<br/>frequency and realized that I could change it as easily as I can<br/>change my pants.  So currently it&apos;s in 12-tone-equal PLUS 47 HERTZ!!!<br/> (What the heck kind of scale is that anyway?)</p><p>5) realized that I hold in my hands what I&apos;ve wanted for over 3 years,<br/>an composing environment I&apos;m used to (sequencer) with the unbridled<br/>synthesizing power and freedom greater than my capability to imagine<br/>it (I hope).</p><p>Without a keyboard controller for a month, I will find this useful in<br/>composing 1) the hoogie boogie, in 16 tones; 2) something for the<br/>quartertone robot instruments at Logos (<a href="http://www.logosfoundation.org">www.logosfoundation.org</a>)</p><p>Now the real work begins,<br/>JacobB</p></div>
