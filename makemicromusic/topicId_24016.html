My favorite musical genres are Blues and Rock and this music is usually made using Fourths and Fifths which are the strongest intervals that occur between the tonic and octave. Based on this I suspect that the best EDOs are those that contain a Fourth and Fifth within 6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy. The 6.776 cents threshold is my own best guess at maximum deviation from pure and I do not claim that it should be set in stone.</p><p>I looked at all EDOs from 1EDO to 48EDO and below is a complete list of all EDOs (from 1 to 48) which contain a Fourth and Fifth within 6.776 cents accuracy.</p><p>With 12EDO there are 4 good (within +/-6.776 cents accuracy) intervals (see below) an octave or less wide: 9/8, 4/3, 3/2 and 2/1.</p><p>With 31EDO there are 14 good (within +/-6.776 cents accuracy) intervals (see below) an octave or less wide: 8/7, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 12/7, 7/4, 11/6, 2/1.</p><p>12EDO, 4 good<br/>0.0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200</p><p>17EDO, 4 good<br/>0.0, 70.5882, 141.176, 211.765, 282.353, 352.941, 423.529, 494.118, 564.706, 635.294, 705.882, 776.471, 847.059, 917.647, 988.235, 1058.82, 1129.41, 1200</p><p>24EDO, 6 good<br/>0.0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200</p><p>29EDO, 8 good<br/>0.0, 41.3793, 82.7586, 124.138, 165.517, 206.897, 248.276, 289.655, 331.034, 372.414, 413.793, 455.172, 496.552, 537.931, 579.31, 620.69, 662.069, 703.448, 744.828, 786.207, 827.586, 868.966, 910.345, 951.724, 993.103, 1034.48, 1075.86, 1117.24, 1158.62, 1200</p><p>31EDO, 14 good<br/>0.0, 38.7097, 77.4194, 116.129, 154.839, 193.548, 232.258, 270.968, 309.677, 348.387, 387.097, 425.806, 464.516, 503.226, 541.935, 580.645, 619.355, 658.065, 696.774, 735.484, 774.194, 812.903, 851.613, 890.323, 929.032, 967.742, 1006.45, 1045.16, 1083.87, 1122.58, 1161.29, 1200</p><p>34EDO, 9 good<br/>0.0, 35.2941, 70.5882, 105.882, 141.176, 176.471, 211.765, 247.059, 282.353, 317.647, 352.941, 388.235, 423.529, 458.824, 494.118, 529.412, 564.706, 600, 635.294, 670.588, 705.882, 741.176, 776.471, 811.765, 847.059, 882.353, 917.647, 952.941, 988.235, 1023.53, 1058.82, 1094.12, 1129.41, 1164.71, 1200</p><p>36EDO, 10 good<br/>0.0, 33.3333, 66.6667, 100, 133.333, 166.667, 200, 233.333, 266.667, 300, 333.333, 366.667, 400, 433.333, 466.667, 500, 533.333, 566.667, 600, 633.333, 666.667, 700, 733.333, 766.667, 800, 833.333, 866.667, 900, 933.333, 966.667, 1000, 1033.33, 1066.67, 1100, 1133.33, 1166.67, 1200</p><p>39EDO, 10 good<br/>0.0, 30.7692, 61.5385, 92.3077, 123.077, 153.846, 184.615, 215.385, 246.154, 276.923, 307.692, 338.462, 369.231, 400, 430.769, 461.538, 492.308, 523.077, 553.846, 584.615, 615.385, 646.154, 676.923, 707.692, 738.462, 769.231, 800, 830.769, 861.538, 892.308, 923.077, 953.846, 984.615, 1015.38, 1046.15, 1076.92, 1107.69, 1138.46, 1169.23, 1200</p><p>41EDO, 17 good<br/>0.0, 29.2683, 58.5366, 87.8049, 117.073, 146.341, 175.61, 204.878, 234.146, 263.415, 292.683, 321.951, 351.22, 380.488, 409.756, 439.024, 468.293, 497.561, 526.829, 556.098, 585.366, 614.634, 643.902, 673.171, 702.439, 731.707, 760.976, 790.244, 819.512, 848.78, 878.049, 907.317, 936.585, 965.854, 995.122, 1024.39, 1053.66, 1082.93, 1112.2, 1141.46, 1170.73, 1200<br/>41 = 17 Ratio= 0.414634</p><p>43EDO, 8 good<br/>0.0, 27.907, 55.814, 83.7209, 111.628, 139.535, 167.442, 195.349, 223.256, 251.163, 279.07, 306.977, 334.884, 362.791, 390.698, 418.605, 446.512, 474.419, 502.326, 530.233, 558.14, 586.047, 613.953, 641.86, 669.767, 697.674, 725.581, 753.488, 781.395, 809.302, 837.209, 865.116, 893.023, 920.93, 948.837, 976.744, 1004.65, 1032.56, 1060.47, 1088.37, 1116.28, 1144.19, 1172.09, 1200</p><p>46EDO, 17 good<br/>0.0, 26.087, 52.1739, 78.2609, 104.348, 130.435, 156.522, 182.609, 208.696, 234.783, 260.87, 286.957, 313.043, 339.13, 365.217, 391.304, 417.391, 443.478, 469.565, 495.652, 521.739, 547.826, 573.913, 600, 626.087, 652.174, 678.261, 704.348, 730.435, 756.522, 782.609, 808.696, 834.783, 860.87, 886.957, 913.043, 939.13, 965.217, 991.304, 1017.39, 1043.48, 1069.57, 1095.65, 1121.74, 1147.83, 1173.91, 1200</p><p>48EDO, 9 good<br/>0.0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 525, 550, 575, 600, 625, 650, 675, 700, 725, 750, 775, 800, 825, 850, 875, 900, 925, 950, 975, 1000, 1025, 1050, 1075, 1100, 1125, 1150, 1175, 1200</p><p>Here is the list of all intervals an octave or less wide that I consider good (in harmony)...<br/>9/8, 8/7, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 9/7, 4/3, 11/8, 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 11/7, 8/5, 5/3, 12/7, 7/4, 9/5, 11/6, 13/7, 2/1.</p><p>John.</p></div><h3><a id=24017 href="#24017">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2010 5:24:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Curious why you leave out many of the inversions of these intervals.

I&apos;d broaden it to at least 8 cents, to include 19-EDO and 22-EDO, as these both produce triads of superior consonance to 12-EDO.  Of course, on a guitar (where intonation fluctuates wildly and tuning is seldom accurate to more than a 2-cent margin of error), I&apos;ve found fifths as wide as 720 cents and as narrow as 685 cents to be more than reasonable for rock music.  Interestingly, fifths on the narrower side (flat of pure) seem to sound better than those on the wider side (sharp of pure) given a constant value of deviation from Just--i.e. a 10-cent flat fifth sounds better than a 10-cent sharp fifth.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been looking at EDOs and it seems to me that 12EDO works so well because it contains both a Perfect Fourth (4/3) and a Perfect Fifth (3/2) within 2.0 cents accuracy in all keys.

I&apos;d broaden it to at least 8 cents, to include 19-EDO and 22-EDO, as these both produce triads of superior consonance to 12-EDO.  Of course, on a guitar (where intonation fluctuates wildly and tuning is seldom accurate to more than a 2-cent margin of error), I&apos;ve found fifths as wide as 720 cents and as narrow as 685 cents to be more than reasonable for rock music.  Interestingly, fifths on the narrower side (flat of pure) seem to sound better than those on the wider side (sharp of pure) given a constant value of deviation from Just--i.e. a 10-cent flat fifth sounds better than a 10-cent sharp fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@...m, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been looking at EDOs and it seems to me that 12EDO works so well because it contains both a Perfect Fourth (4/3) and a Perfect Fifth (3/2) within 2.0 cents accuracy in all keys. My favorite musical genres are Blues and Rock and this music is usually made using Fourths and Fifths which are the strongest intervals that occur between the tonic and octave. Based on this I suspect that the best EDOs are those that contain a Fourth and Fifth within 6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy.

So if you get the fifth accurate<br/>by about 6 cents, you also get the fourth accurate by the same amount.</p><p>   I have an admittedly odd approach to this...which is try to handle the most<br/>error-effected (and often more dissonant) intervals first...and then check the<br/>intervals that allow more error (including the fifth and fourth) last.<br/>*****************<br/>Here is my order of analysis.........</p><p>A) Worry about the minor third (6/5) and the sixth (5/3) since these are very<br/>intolerant to error (IE 1.65 sounds a world different than 5/3 and 1.21 sounds a<br/>world different than 6/5)</p><p>B) Next think about the augmented fourth around 7/5.

Note that, IMVHO, 11/6 and 9/5 can be used as alternatives to<br/>15/8...but there&apos;s a bad area around 1.818 that sounds terrible you should avoid<br/>at all costs...which makes accuracy a bit tricky at times.  You can also<br/>occasionally use 11/9 as an alternative minor second.</p><p>D)  Next handle the augmented sixth around 7/4 and 12/7.  Note there is a dead<br/>spot between 7/4 and 12/7.

Note<br/>&gt; that the octave 2 over (3/2) AKA 2/(3/2)= 4/3. So if you get &gt; the fifth accurate<br/>&gt; by about 6 cents, you also get the fourth accurate by the same &gt; amount.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have an admittedly odd approach to this...which is try to &gt; handle the most<br/>&gt; error-effected (and often more dissonant) intervals &gt; first...and then check the<br/>&gt; intervals that allow more error (including the fifth and &gt; fourth) last.<br/>&gt; *****************<br/>&gt; Here is my order of analysis.........<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A) Worry about the minor third (6/5) and the sixth (5/3) since &gt; these are very<br/>&gt; intolerant to error (IE 1.65 sounds a world different than 5/3 &gt; and 1.21 sounds a<br/>&gt; world different than 6/5)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B) Next think about the augmented fourth around 7/5. It is &gt; fairly sensitive to<br/>&gt; error but, IMVHO, not as sensitive as the minor third. There &gt; is a dead zone<br/>&gt; (very dissonant) between 7/5 and 11/8 where it begins to sound &gt; awful...between<br/>&gt; 7/5 and 10/7 it seems much more tolerant of error..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C) Next consider the minor second (and major seventh...since &gt; they are also<br/>&gt; &quot;reversed around the octave&quot;) should be dealt with first as &gt; they are the most<br/>&gt; dissonant. Note that, IMVHO, 11/6 and 9/5 can be used as &gt; alternatives to<br/>&gt; 15/8...but there&apos;s a bad area around 1.818 that sounds &gt; terrible you should avoid<br/>&gt; at all costs...which makes accuracy a bit tricky at times. You &gt; can also<br/>&gt; occasionally use 11/9 as an alternative minor second.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D) Next handle the augmented sixth around 7/4 and 12/7. Note &gt; there is a dead<br/>&gt; spot between 7/4 and 12/7. Note around 16/9 (1.7777) can also &gt; be used as an<br/>&gt; alternative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E) Then the the fifth (and fourth) should be dealt with.

And you can stack two sharp fourths and get an approximate 9/5 in any meantone. 26 is something to try, or 19; they have pretty sharp fourths. But I just finished a piece in 87. That&apos;s my idea of a good equal division.

There are plenty of scales that sound nothing<br/>like 12-tet, and the fact that shades of diatonic harmony can be heard<br/>in 7-tet shouldn&apos;t really be that big of a deal.

Only my mind still<br/>trips a bit over that as implemented in 7TET.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think that there are some psychoacoustic reasons why shades of &quot;minorness&quot;<br/>&gt;and &quot;majorness&quot; can be heard in this tuning, and that it&apos;s something to be<br/>&gt;embraced and explored, rather than assuming that it<br/>shouldn&apos;t be that way.&quot;</p><p>   Agreed.<br/>  This works well for the 18/11 and 11/9-ish intervals in 7TET.  Those appear to<br/>be two of the gems in that tuning, and two intervals I use a whole lot in my own<br/>scales.</p><p>    However the 7th interval, to me, sounds horrid (right smack between the<br/>IMVHO far less distorted-sounding intervals of 9/5 and 11/6) and the high 4th in<br/>7TET sounds OK by itself to me, but terribly mis-tuned when played against the<br/>octave IE 2/(1.3459 AKA the 7tet 4th) = 1.485...a big time wolf fifth (neither<br/>in the 22/15 diminished fifth or 3/2 pure fifth areas my mind tends to favor).<br/>That &quot;wolf fifth&quot; also, of course, if the fifth in 7TET...and, to me, it means<br/>less triads will be available since the other dyads will have to work to help<br/>&quot;cancel out&quot; the impurity of the 5th (not to say it&apos;s impossible, just hard to<br/>do/&quot;prime&quot;....for the composer).</p><p>   IMVHO, 7TET, though obviously having its virtues, hints at something purer<br/>that still keeps a high degree of major/minor swap-ability in tact at the<br/>composer&apos;s creative disposal.  Try the following &quot;skewed 7TET&quot; scale which,<br/>IMVHO, keeps the feel while increasing the &quot;steadiness&quot; of the scale:</p><p>1/1<br/>10/9<br/>11/9<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>18/11<br/>11/6<br/>2/1</p><p>   Now granted...temper this beast and you will likely get something &quot;even&quot;<br/>better sounding...
