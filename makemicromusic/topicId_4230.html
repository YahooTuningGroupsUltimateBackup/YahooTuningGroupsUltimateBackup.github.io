Ya know, those<br/>short, hyper-expressionist pieces, &quot;expressing a novel in a sigh&quot; or<br/>what-not.</p><p>With the talk about Charles Ives being the &quot;predecessor&quot;, as it were, to<br/>Dan&apos;s music, well, to be honest, I think I prefer Dan&apos;s music to Charles<br/>IVes&apos;.  Regarding Ives. . . there&apos;s a lot of cool ideas there, but<br/>I usually find the music too muddy (to name one complaint).  I think Dan<br/>Stearns has all the best Ivesian attributes, without the bad ones.</p><p>cb</p></div>
