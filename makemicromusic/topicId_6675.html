IIRC, after pages of tables of permuted<br/>tetrachords,<br/>S said that only those approximated by the 17-tone cycle of fifths scale<br/>were in use in<br/>his day.</p><p>In general, the Greeks put the smallest intervals at the bottom of the<br/>tetrachord and the<br/>largest on top, though there are are exceptions  such as Archytas&apos;s<br/>28/27 x 8/7 x 9/8, 28/27 x 36/35 x 5/4, and Didymos&apos;s 16/15 x 25/24 x<br/>6/5. In these cases, the choice of the first interval<br/>may have depended upon the interval it made with a note a 9/8 below the<br/>first note of the tetrachord (mese for the diezeugmenon tetrachord,<br/>proslambanomenos for hypaton, and an extra note, diatonic lichanos<br/>hypaton or hyperhypate, for the meson). The use of this composite<br/>interval appears to have been a standard stylistic feature of music in<br/>the enharmonic and chromatic genera.</p><p>There is good reason to believe that the so-called &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning<br/>of the diatonic<br/>genus was the oldest scale in Greek art music (see Franklin&apos;s<br/>dissertation) and that the enharmonic derived from 5-toned folk scales<br/>of the semitone-Major third (ditone) type.<br/>This scale is derivable from the diatonic by gapping, of course. The<br/>chromatic genus developed<br/>from the enharmonic, which became heptatonic only around the end of the<br/>4th century BCE and<br/>the beginning of the 3rd. Stopping half-way between the enharmonic and<br/>chromatic produces<br/>Aristoxenos&apos;s hemiolic chromatic (75 + 75 + 350 cents), giving another<br/>example of the neutral third.</p><p>I suggest that the neutral diatonic type of scale such as Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>Equable or Even Diatonic, Al-Farabi&apos;s reduplicated 3/4-tone genera, etc.<br/>are not Greek, but possibly of African or Arabian origin. I think<br/>Ptolemy heard them in Alexandria, which was the most cosmopolitan city<br/>in the eastern Mediterranean area in the 2nd century CE. In addition to<br/>large Greek and  Egyptian population, there were Romans, Jews, Arabs,<br/>Ethiopians, Persians, etc., and even Buddhist missionaries from India<br/>living and trading there.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=6676 href="#6676">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2004 9:22:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello John!<br/> You are probably right on this but Having a large collection of African<br/>music i cannot tell you how many times i have heard things that sounded<br/>like  Ancient greet artifacts. Now this might be caused by an influence of<br/>greek culture on african or possibly we might consider that the greek which<br/>appear to import instruments (such as the aulos) might have had a taste for<br/>other instruments and instruments from the south. Compare a lyre to a kora<br/>and any of the many african plucked instruments. I also by the way find<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s Equable or Even Diatonic like scales in Scandinavian countries<br/>also.
