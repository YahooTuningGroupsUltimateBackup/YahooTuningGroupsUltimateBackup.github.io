As I commented on the other list, if you have a built in mic and strum across it, it sounds just like strumming a guitar! xD</p><p>John</p></div><h3>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2010 11:45:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I watched the video. This is very impressive, especially the ability to have the microphone as driver. I like listening to all types of synths, but physical modelling synths are the only type I would be interested to own, due to their more organic, complex character.</p><p>Mat Cooper</p></div>
