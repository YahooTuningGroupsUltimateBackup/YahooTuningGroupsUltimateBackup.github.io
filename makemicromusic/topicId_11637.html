I went ahead and purchased it  myself just now, &gt;hoping that the microtuning implementation is usable.</p><p>WilliamK, the developer, seemed responsive to the very problematic first implementation of microtuning, and did some very quick work on the program. It is closer now, but there are still problems. My guess, like many of the VSTs that have implemented micro lately is that they are likely to be successful when doing pure synthesis (because they can calculate the frequencies directly) as opposed to those that use samples in some form (since, given a mutlisampled layout for a 12tet instrument, one would have to do some sophisticated figuring out which notes to use and retune).</p><p>Wusik is closer now, but it may depend on the size and kinds of tunings you use. I am sorry that when the fixes got made also coincided with a time period that I had to call a halt to my electronic music making, and I&apos;ve only recently started up again. Maybe between Rick and I we can pinpoint further any problems and have them resolved.</p><p>&gt;Once I have a chance to mess with it, I&apos;ll report back on the tuning &gt;implementation.</p><p>Well, Rick, if it is a bust for you I&apos;ll split the cost! :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=11640 href="#11640">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2005 12:17:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Seidel asked:</p><p>&gt; Is this usable standalone?

It has a facility for loading sampled sounds, and you have to tell<br/>it explicitly the real frequency of each sample, and which sample to use<br/>for which keys/ranges on the keyboard. It would be a lot of work to make a<br/>fully sampled instrument with Rhino, but it *does* (seem to) correctly<br/>implement tuning of sampled sounds. [Note that Rhino isn&apos;t really a<br/>&quot;sampler&quot; per se, but it can use sampled sounds.]</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=11645 href="#11645">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2005 1:00:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for all the great info, Rick.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Rick McGowan wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave Seidel asked:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Is this usable standalone?
