Haha, just too hard for me to play. I&apos;m going to sell it in the SF bay area. If anyone on this list wants it (and could pick it up) just e-mail me privately. $200 including manual, stand. Mid-week I&apos;ll put it on Craig&apos;s list.</p><p><a href="http://www.moogmusic.com/products/etherwave-theremins/etherwave-theremin-standard">http://www.moogmusic.com/products/etherwave-theremins/etherwave-theremin-standard</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Rick</p></div>
