Main new thing of microtonal interest is the &quot;A Version of Theremin&apos;s Rhythmicon&quot;. The original Rhythmicon is a polyrhythmic metronome playing notes in the harmonic series, and probably the first ever &quot;drum machine&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ve also made more of a feature of the various versions of the Harmonic Metronome and the Fractional Harmonic Metronome which I posted about before. The Fractional Harmonic metronome is the one that can play a golden ratio pitch interval with steady beats at golden ratio intervals to give &quot;the most inharmonic pitch interval combined with the most polyrhythmic rhythm&quot;. The harmonic metronome plays polyrhythms with notes from the harmonic series, so same idea as the Rhythmicon.</p><p>Also major overhaul of the user interface and improvements in the shortcuts - see the press release or the what&apos;s new on the web site for details.</p><p>Page about the Rhythmicon:<br/><a href="http://www.bouncemetronome.com/metronome_rhythmicon.htm">http://www.bouncemetronome.com/metronome_rhythmicon.htm</a><br/>Page about the fractional harmonic metronome:<br/><a href="http://www.bouncemetronome.com/metronome_fractional_harmonic.htm">http://www.bouncemetronome.com/metronome_fractional_harmonic.htm</a></p><p>If you already own Tune Smithy Play or Complete, then you can unlock Bounce Metronome Pro as well with the same unlock key.<br/>Tune Smithy is still at version 3.0 and Bounce Metronome Pro is at 3.2, so Bounce Metronome Pro also gives an idea of what FTS will look like when I update the entire program to 3.2 hopefully later this year.</p><p>Tune Smithy 3.0 is at:<br/><a href="http://robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/music.htm">http://robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/music.htm</a></p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions at all do contact me, either here, or directly to support@... or  via the forum:<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/smf">http://www.robertinventor.com/smf</a></p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>Oxford, United Kingdom - July 2nd 2009, Robert Inventor announces Version 3.2 of Bounce Metronome Pro.</p><p>This metronome uses bounces to help you keep in time, just as conductors often do. It&apos;s especially easy to clap or play in time with the bounces of a ball when it hits a flat surface. Bounce Metronome Pro can show bounces following any rhythm, as a drum stick, ball or baton.</p><p>You can use it to practice almost any kind of rhythm including swing, polyrhythms, additive rhythms like 3+2+3/8, and combinations of all of those. Also includes harmonic metronomes and a version of Theremin&apos;s Rhythmicon - a pitched polyrhythm metronome, which was the first ever drum machine.</p><p>The bounces help you to keep in time with the beat, which is especially useful for irregular and tricky rhythms.</p><p>In version 3.2 the program has been reorganised to help new users quickly find the main features. Select the type of rhythm or metronome you want, e.g. swing, polyrhythm or whatever is the main interest, in the main window drop list. You then find that the main window is set up ready to work with that particular type of rhythm. Other new features include a right click to accent beats feature, use of backspace key to tap the tempo, return key as a quick way to stop and start the metronome when you practice, and quick shortcut keys to silence or play any part in the rhythm.</p><p>You can get the basic metronome for $9.95, the pro metronome for $19.90, and you can get Tune Smithy as well for $49.90. If you already have the Play or Complete License for Tune Smithy, you can use your license to unlock the Pro metronome, and if you have the Midi Save license for Tune Smithy you can unlock the basic metronome.</p><p>To download the program, and for screen shots and more information visit</p><p><a href="http://www.bouncemetronome.com/index.htm">http://www.bouncemetronome.com/index.htm</a></p><p>Direct download link:</p><p><a href="http://www.bouncemetronome.com/Setup_Bounce_Metronome.exe">http://www.bouncemetronome.com/Setup_Bounce_Metronome.exe</a></p><p>Contact</p><p>Robert Walker</p><p>Robert Inventor</p><p>support@...</p><p><a href="http://www.bouncemetronome.com/">http://www.bouncemetronome.com/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
