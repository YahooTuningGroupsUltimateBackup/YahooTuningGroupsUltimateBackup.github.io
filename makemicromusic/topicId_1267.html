I&apos;ve enjoyed some of the recent musical pieces put up here (and there, and everywhere), so my hat is off to the various people playing/making the stuff.</p><p>I&apos;m also pretty well astonished at the *variety* of approaches and styles exhibited within even this small community. If the tools to make microtonal music continue to evolve, and the means of dissemination improve, there is a chance that alternatives to being locked in to 12tET can be grow on a listening public from many, many angles. And that is probably the only way things will move forward.</p><p>OK, so why in the world would I mention a 12tET piece of mine? A fair number of people come at the task of making &apos;our&apos; kind of music(s) with the question &quot;What is the minimum setup needed?&quot; Of course, there are many answers, especially if you divide between the software/hardware/acoustic instrument camps. That said, many people have started out exploring with the minimum of Scala, FTS (or maybe Jeff Scott&apos;s Lil&apos; Micro Oven [sorry, Jeff, I don&apos;t remember the *exact* name right now] and a humble Yamaha TX81z.</p><p>Jacky recently brought up in a post to Joseph that he has some seriously improved brass patches, and as I&apos;ve just setup a second system totally devoted to running the synths and music gear, it made me think: didn&apos;t I manage to coax some better sounds out of my old box once?</p><p>So, while it is a piece that doesn&apos;t step directly into non-12, it does remind me of what I could do when I was using a couple of TXs on a more regular basis. To be morally pure, I didn&apos;t upload it to our files section, but you can find &quot;Circuit Riding&quot; at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jonszanto/">http://www.geocities.com/jonszanto/</a></p><p>The description is there, basically that it was a little spec/soundtrack piece about flying around inside a circuit board. I&apos;m going to start working on some piece(s) that have some similar textures, but finally have some good intonations to work with the material, maybe changing tunings during different sections. We&apos;ll see...</p><p>Anyhow, hope everyone is well, and if you haven&apos;t been around CMM lately, post a little note to let us know how you (and your music!) are these days.</p><p>Mom loves you,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>11/28/2001 1:31:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

I think ahead to those treatments when writing the piece, if it is to be a recorded piece instead of a performed one.

That&apos;s what I figured, but I just wanted to make sure<br/>that listeners didn&apos;t think that was the final version!</p><p>I&apos;m sure the sound of the &quot;trombone&quot; patch (actually called &quot;horn&quot; to<br/>the TX81Z) &quot;inspired&quot; Jacky to think of some of his TX81Z<br/>brass &quot;improvements.&quot;</p><p>Surely the brass sounds need it.  Actually this &quot;horn&quot; is one of the<br/>better brass ones on the &quot;Z.&quot;  And, of course, we know what the<br/>*strings* sound like!  :)</p><p>But, of course, the bells and chimes with the FM work on the &quot;Z&quot; are<br/>really quite striking (literally!).  In fact, I got a good &quot;review&quot;<br/>in a theatre newspaper (not even sure which one... it was just posted<br/>up at the theatre) for the bells and chimes in the Tempest...  which<br/>I &quot;abstracted up&quot; quite a bit.</p><p>Thanks for the interest, and for listening.  As I mentioned, I<br/>enjoyed your masterful work with the TX81Z.  Although an earlier<br/>piece of equipment, I believe there&apos;s no arguing that<br/>it&apos;s &quot;legendary&quot; from a tuning standpoint.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that practically *everybody* who is into synthesis<br/>and alternate tunings has worked with one at one time or another...<br/>at least that&apos;s what it seems like sometimes to me...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>11/29/2001 7:22:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;9u40pq+gu34@...&gt;<br/>I still have my TX81Z patches at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/graham/x991203.zip">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/graham/x991203.zip</a>&gt;.
