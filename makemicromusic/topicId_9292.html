Not everyone comes to microtonality through the front<br/>door, sometimes they summersault in through a window or seep up<br/>through the floorboards... this month&apos;s theme was &quot;out-of-tune&quot;, and<br/>I think it&apos;s interesting to hear some of the results...like ego<br/>guitar and sharpie for instance, very nice. I think he&apos;s in the house<br/>now!</p><p><a href="http://negation.hoster905.com/plunger/">http://negation.hoster905.com/plunger/</a></p></div>
