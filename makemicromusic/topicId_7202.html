It&apos;s different, but its cleaner and faster, and the delivery is<br/>*much* faster. I also like that topics are threaded. (Its clear that I much<br/>prefer it to Yahoo by now, eh?)</p><p>Joseph, the link thing sounds weird, but you&apos;re in and approved, so why not<br/>send a test post to be satisfied that it works for you.</p><p>To speed things along, and so no-one here has to wait to be reviewed for<br/>membership over at Google, I&apos;m making it temporarily that anyone can join.<br/>I can then weed out spammers later.</p><p>This will get the ball rolling on comparisons. By all means, cross-post to<br/>Google, go there and compare searchability, web interface, etc. Right now a<br/>healthy, core group of 14 of us have registered, and I&apos;ll send another email<br/>out inviting members of MMM that I have record of who aren&apos;t already joined<br/>to do so.</p><p>We need to give it chance. Well, at least I feel that strongly that Yahoo<br/>sucks because of its &apos;search lameness&apos;.</p><p>Robert, as for the proprietary script, I think the BBS certainly looks nice,<br/>etc. But do they have Linux scripts? And I&apos;m still not quite sure I want to<br/>pay dough to be able to chat with you all about music/tuning. My vote would<br/>still be to stay at Yahoo over that, lame as it is.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using to much free good quality software on a killer free OS to take<br/>seriously the idea of paying for software much anymore.</p><p>Anyway, if enough of you are just not into Google, I&apos;m going to still keep it<br/>open, try to develop it over there, and maybe there will be two organic forks<br/>of the same idea? But for now, my practice will be to cross-post. I&apos;m certain<br/>that if you give it a chance, even the skeptics will see the virtues of<br/>Google and let the Yahoo group die by slow habitual migration over to Google.<br/>Once enough of you are caught in my web, I&apos;ll remove the cross-posts, and<br/>you&apos;ll be caught in the horrible Google lair !!!!

It saves us the<br/>trouble of setting up such a forum<br/>oneself, and in some ways<br/>it is better than many of the scripts you<br/>can find to do it yourself,<br/>particularly the attachments<br/>upload - that is a fairly rare<br/>feature, also the innovative<br/>threading interface.</p><p>The one big caveat is that there is<br/>nothing to stop them from changing<br/>the format of the forum any day,<br/>or to add obtrusive ads or whatever<br/>they like, including also just<br/>losing one of the groups entirely too<br/>one day.</p><p>All those things have happened with<br/>Yahoogroups which originally<br/>had no ads at all on the web<br/>pages, only a few years ago.<br/>They also changed the format<br/>so that ascii diagrams became<br/>unreadable - luckily we found<br/>a work around, but there is no<br/>guarantee that one will always<br/>find a work around and if one can&apos;t<br/>you can&apos;t do anytinng about it.<br/>Maybe ascii diagrams aren&apos;t<br/>so important here but<br/>they could change things<br/>that are important to us too.<br/>Then also you hear about<br/>yahoogroup groups suddenly<br/>vanishing as happened to the<br/>main tuning list for a few days<br/>- but luckily it came back<br/>again after the glitch.<br/>There was no-one wwe could contact<br/>to find out what was happening,<br/>just had to wait and hope it<br/>got sorted out.</p><p>As a free service you just don&apos;t<br/>expect good custom support<br/>- though admittedly I haven&apos;t<br/>tried the Google custom support<br/>and maybe it is better than<br/>Yahoogroups.</p><p>If we host our own script somewhere<br/>whether privately or at an institution<br/>then it will never change unless<br/>we want it to. If one needs<br/>to migrate to a new server,<br/>you can take the script and<br/>messages archives with you.</p><p>Anyway with MMM just want us to be<br/>aware of that. Maybe it isn&apos;t<br/>such a big issue as if that<br/>happens we can just move on again.<br/>If it can be our home for a couple<br/>of years or whatever, then if we have<br/>to move again we can maybe<br/>find somewhere even better<br/>by then, or host our own<br/>script at that point.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem to matter too<br/>much at all to lose the continuity<br/>with previous messages in this<br/>forum as we have already migrated<br/>twice before. The music is the<br/>central thing and old<br/>messages refer to music that is<br/>no longer available for download<br/>anyway.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
