I have yet to make it through the<br/>list myself (busy composing tonight) but what is apparent is that there is a<br/>lot to learn from practically every piece I heard.</p><p>I personally like the winning piece a lot. The common thread I hear in the<br/>top three is a breadth of vision - I can&apos;t say the others didn&apos;t have it<br/>since I&apos;ve not finished listening. I think what one may have to allow for is<br/>music that you may not necessarily like yet has depth and vision that can&apos;t<br/>be denied. That certainly was my first impression of the winning piece - but<br/>on repeated listens I think I&apos;m stating to &quot;get it&quot;. In any case, like Igs&apos;<br/>piece - it is damn powerful.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Jan 31, 2011 at 11:52 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Domina Catrina Lee: Eidolon - Loaded with memorable melodies, orchestral<br/>&gt; surges<br/>&gt; in an ethnic arrangement as complex as in Shaahin&apos;s piece, and tons of<br/>&gt; playful variation...and all incredibly easy to listen to (comparable to, say<br/>&gt; &quot;Iris&quot; by the alt. rock group Goo Goo Dolls).
