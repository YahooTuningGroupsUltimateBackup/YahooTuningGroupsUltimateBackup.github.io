Gene, I haven&apos;t had time to listen except for<br/>about twice, and they were a tad distracted. My initial impressions were<br/>that I liked the first temperament best (I believe it returns?), but<br/>maybe it is just a matter of context. I *did*, however, like your first<br/>motive very well, and the variations that came to it.</p><p>It seems to me I recall responding to this once, but it seems not to have<br/>appeared; oh well. The first temperament (126/125) is in better tune, the<br/>second (64/63) is in a version more like 27-et, and could have been a<br/>little tamer in something like 22-et. If you liked the first (which, yes,<br/>does return) better, it could mean you like to get close to JI. :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Help. As in what sort of gear?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t jump in too much here. One of the problems is with extended<br/>intonations, where you need to access more than 12 steps per octave, our<br/>current lineup of hardware/software are still far from ideal. However,<br/>there are a good number of people over at MMM that could counsel you well<br/>in this area.</p><p>Any takers? I&apos;ve been using Scala and Timidity, which is freeware, but I<br/>don&apos;t know if there is any software out there which would be better.</p><p>&gt; But it is clear where you are going, and especially if you were to<br/>really pinpoint an &apos;orchestration&apos; for a piece - say, a woodwind quintet<br/>or something - then you can get your information going as you have, and<br/>then find someone with more outboard gear to do a &apos;realization&apos; for you<br/>that would come closer to acoustic renditions.</p><p>I was thinking more along the lines of writing a woodwind quartet (which<br/>I am for the nonce, in &quot;Magic&quot;) and then seeing if Johnny or someone<br/>would consider it for a *live* performance. I think that&apos;s where I need<br/>to go if I&apos;m going to try to get serious about this.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s all from me, congrats and any follow-ups I can do at MMM...</p><p>Thanks, Jon. With your interest in cellular automata, we&apos;ll make a<br/>mathematician of you yet.</p></div><h3><a id=3183 href="#3183">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2002 7:49:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Gene W Smith &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_2880.html#3182">/makemicromusic/topicId_2880.html#3182</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking more along the lines of writing a woodwind quartet<br/>(which<br/>&gt; I am for the nonce, in &quot;Magic&quot;) and then seeing if Johnny or someone<br/>&gt; would consider it for a *live* performance.

However, I must<br/>say that it was Johnny *himself* who suggested to me that I include<br/>alternate fingerings in my microtonal pieces. (Not necessarily for<br/>*his* group, but in general)</p><p>My *own* objective is to write pieces that could be performed<br/>by &quot;standard&quot; players, not necessarily microtonal specialists, so I<br/>try to make my scores accessible to that larger group.</p><p>Last night, in fact, I worked with a violist, Olivia Koppell, who has<br/>played *very little* microtonal music.  Of course, for string<br/>instruments I don&apos;t need fingerings.  She almost quit the piece,<br/>thinking it was &quot;too hard.&quot;  However, it ended up that she did quite<br/>a nice job of it and even learning a *lot* in the process: about<br/>pitch perception (which was enhanced, of course) and about bowing<br/>technique (apparently vibrato covers a multitude of sins, and<br/>playing &quot;senza vibrar&quot; entails an entirely new and valuable bowing<br/>technique...)</p><p>So, in the end, she really enjoyed the experience and is even<br/>thinking of playing the piece for a &quot;viola conference&quot;<br/>demonstrating &quot;new things&quot; that can be done with the instrument...</p><p>best,</p><p>JP</p></div>
