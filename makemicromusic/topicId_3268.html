That&apos;s my primary weapon of choice.</p><p>Yes it most certainly does sysex messages in midi streams, as do a lot of<br/>sequencing software.  You can also edit the contents of the sysex and type<br/>over or in between bytes.</p><p>You can ALSO have sysex stored in buttons on a &quot;Console&quot; which if you look<br/>at the MOTU site, you&apos;ll see it&apos;s a user defined interface.  I currently<br/>have two consoles that change the temperaments on either of my TX81Zs at the<br/>click of a button.  The day I put that together brought a *big* evil grin.</p><p>Otherwise.  You can pitchbend audio in cent steps, but the pitch bend<br/>command is the standard, -8192 to +8191.  If that&apos;s what you&apos;re asking.</p><p>What I couldn&apos;t believe until I saw it is, you can actually change the pitch<br/>OR formants OR tempo of a soundbite independently.</p><p>I started using Performer 3.0 in 1989, went up to 6.03 in 1998, just<br/>upgraded to Digital Performer 3.02 a couple months ago.  I THOUGHT it was<br/>simply Performer with unlimited audio tracks.  I cried for hours when I read<br/>through the info online.  It does everything.</p><p>Actually the accompaniment of my last performance involved the mixing of 20<br/>audio tracks.  No pops, no clicks, no drags.  I maxed the ram in my iMac and<br/>shot the preferred memory for DP3 up to like 200MB or something.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>even flinch no matter how much I pump through it.</p><p>I would go the extra 50 or 100 bucks and get Unisyn if you have a lot of<br/>modules that you&apos;d like to be able to edit patches for onscreen.  That and a<br/>MOTU interface.
