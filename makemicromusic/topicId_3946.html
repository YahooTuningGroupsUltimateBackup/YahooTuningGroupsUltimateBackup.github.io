Pauline Oliveros, accordian; Philip Gelb, shakuhachi; and<br/>&gt; Dana Reason,<br/>&gt; piano.<br/>&gt; -------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Arts Center for the Capital Region<br/>&gt; 265 River Street Troy<br/>&gt; 12-05-02<br/>&gt; 8pm doors at 7:30pm<br/>&gt; $5/3 students<br/>&gt; -------------------<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ir-music.org">http://www.ir-music.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The final Impulse/Response of part one of our 3rd season is<br/>&gt; indeed an<br/>&gt; exciting one!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  From three corners of our grand US of A, come three of the most<br/>&gt; sensitive<br/>&gt; and unique voices in contemporary improvisation.  The Space<br/>&gt; Between has been<br/>&gt; mystifying audiences with their unique blend of sonic exploration<br/>&gt; for over 7<br/>&gt; years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Arts Center will be a wonderfully intimate space to listen to<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; delicate, organic ensemble...come in from the cold and warm up<br/>&gt; your ears!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Group Bio:<br/>&gt; THE SPACE BETWEEN<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Space Between trio was formed in the winter, 1996 when<br/>&gt; the Dana<br/>&gt; Reason/Philip Gelb duet invited Pauline Oliveros to join them for<br/>&gt; a concert<br/>&gt; in San Francisco. Utilizing a unique combination of Just<br/>&gt; intonation<br/>&gt; accordion with shakuhachi and piano immediately puts the trio<br/>&gt; in a special<br/>&gt; sonic space. The trio employs timbre and texture as their main<br/>&gt; structural<br/>&gt; units for composition and improvisation. As a result the<br/>&gt; discrepancy in<br/>&gt; tuning systems of the instruments becomes an advantage rather<br/>&gt; than a<br/>&gt; disadvantage. Since the three members live in different cities,<br/>&gt; performances<br/>&gt; have been sporadic; highlights include the Opus 415 festival in<br/>&gt; San<br/>&gt; Francisco, Spruce Street Forum in San Diego and a two night<br/>&gt; stint at the<br/>&gt; Center for New Music and Audio Technologies where they were<br/>&gt; joined by Barre<br/>&gt; Phillips on bass.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Individual Bios:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PAULINE OLIVEROS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pauline Oliveros has become a senior figure in American<br/>&gt; avant-garde. In the<br/>&gt; &apos;50s she was part of a circle of iconoclastic composers, artists,<br/>&gt; poets and<br/>&gt; such gathered loosely around John Cage. Oliveros has been as<br/>&gt; interested in<br/>&gt; finding new sounds as in finding new uses for old ones -<br/>&gt; nowadays she most<br/>&gt; often plays accordion, an unexpected visitor perhaps to musical<br/>&gt; cutting<br/>&gt; edge, but one which she approaches in much the same way that<br/>&gt; a Zen musician<br/>&gt; might approach the Japanese shakuhachi. Pauline Oliveros&apos; life<br/>&gt; as a<br/>&gt; composer, performer and humanitarian is about opening her<br/>&gt; own and others&apos;<br/>&gt; sensibilities to the universe and facets of sounds. Since the<br/>&gt; 1960&apos;s she has<br/>&gt; influenced American music profoundly through her work with<br/>&gt; improvisation,<br/>&gt; meditation, electronic music, myth and ritual. Pauline Oliveros is<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; founder of Deep Listening, which comes from her childhood<br/>&gt; fascination with<br/>&gt; sounds and from her works in concert music with composition,<br/>&gt; improvisation<br/>&gt; and electro-acoustics. Pauline Oliveros describes Deep<br/>&gt; Listening as a method<br/>&gt; to listen in every possible way to everything possible to hear no<br/>&gt; matter<br/>&gt; what you are doing. Such intense listening includes the sounds<br/>&gt; of daily<br/>&gt; life, of nature, of one&apos;s own thoughts as well as musical sounds.<br/>&gt; Deep<br/>&gt; Listening is my life practice,&quot; she explains, simply. John Cage:<br/>&gt; &quot;Through<br/>&gt; Pauline Oliveros and Deep Listening I finally know what harmony<br/>&gt; is... It&apos;s<br/>&gt; about the pleasure of making music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DANA REASON<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Canadian born pianist, composer and improvisor Dana Reason<br/>&gt; has performed at<br/>&gt; the California Institute for the Arts, Colorado University, Guelph<br/>&gt; Jazz<br/>&gt; Festival, Frau Musica (Nova) Cologne, San Francisco Jazz<br/>&gt; Festival, Beyond<br/>&gt; the Pink Festival, (LA), Knitting Factory (NYC), Music Gallery<br/>&gt; (Toronto),<br/>&gt; and Newfoundland Sound Symposium. Ms. Reason has been<br/>&gt; featured on National<br/>&gt; Public Radio, Radio Canada and has recorded for Music &amp; Arts,<br/>&gt; Red Toucan,<br/>&gt; Deep Listening, Sparkling Beatnik and Ryokan labels. This past<br/>&gt; fall<br/>&gt; Musicworks magazine published a feature article titled The<br/>&gt; Piano Artistry of<br/>&gt; Dana Reaons by Dan Given. Ms. Reason is Ph.D candidate and<br/>&gt; scholarship<br/>&gt; recipient at the University of California San Diego where she<br/>&gt; studies with<br/>&gt; George E. Lewis and Anthony Davis. Her dissertation research<br/>&gt; is titled<br/>&gt; Playing like a Girl: Women Improvisors in the Second Half of the<br/>&gt; Twentieth<br/>&gt; Century: A Cross-Cultural Investigation into Musical<br/>&gt; Performativity. Ms.<br/>&gt; Reason is a freelance writer for the Twentieth Century Music,<br/>&gt; The Improvisor<br/>&gt; and Musicworks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PHILIP GELB<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Philip Gelb was born in Brooklyn, NY April 12, 1965. He has<br/>&gt; been studying<br/>&gt; shakuhachi since 1988, and performing professionally since<br/>&gt; 1995.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gelb began studying shakuhachi while a senior in college at the<br/>&gt; University<br/>&gt; of Florida where he recieved a BA in anthropology. His first<br/>&gt; shakuhachi<br/>&gt; teacher was Dr. Dale Olsen bai-o who introduced him to Kinko<br/>&gt; Ryu shakuhachi<br/>&gt; playing. He has also studied Meian Ryu shakuhachi with Ronnie<br/>&gt; Nyogetsu<br/>&gt; Seldin and with Kurahashi Yoshio. His traditional shakuhachi<br/>&gt; studies have<br/>&gt; concentrated on honkyoku, the solo Buddhist repetoire. In<br/>&gt; addition he always<br/>&gt; had a very strong interest in new and experimental music and<br/>&gt; improvisation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He attended graduate school at the Florida State University<br/>&gt; School of Music<br/>&gt; studying ethnomusicology. While at FSU, he founded and<br/>&gt; directed the New<br/>&gt; World Ensemble. As director of this ensemble he was<br/>&gt; responsible for holding<br/>&gt; several artists in residence, including George Lewis, Richard<br/>&gt; Teitelbaum,<br/>&gt; Wadada Leo Smith, Davey Williams, Derek Bailey, Ladonna<br/>&gt; Smith, Shaking Ray<br/>&gt; Levis and Lawrence &quot;Butch&quot; Morris. The Butch Morris residency<br/>&gt; culminated in<br/>&gt; a CD that was released on New World/Countercurrents as part<br/>&gt; of Butch&apos;s 10 CD<br/>&gt; box set. The group also collaborated with several other great<br/>&gt; musicians<br/>&gt; including Kazue Sawai, Jill Burton, Gustavo Matamoros, Scott<br/>&gt; Walton, David<br/>&gt; Durant and Dana Reason. The New World Ensemble continues<br/>&gt; today at the FSU<br/>&gt; School of Music even though it has been several years since any<br/>&gt; of its<br/>&gt; founding members were there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In November, 1996, Philip Gelb received a grant to attend a<br/>&gt; Japanese<br/>&gt; American artists interchange at the Atlantic Center for the Arts to<br/>&gt; study<br/>&gt; with the brilliant composer, Yuji Takahashi. During this residency<br/>&gt; some very<br/>&gt; important professional and personal connections were made;<br/>&gt; particularly<br/>&gt; meeting dancer, Eri Majima who has become a regular<br/>&gt; collaborator in Japan<br/>&gt; and the US.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since 1995, Gelb has been performing nationally and<br/>&gt; internationally as a<br/>&gt; soloist and in ensembles. Performance highlights include the<br/>&gt; World<br/>&gt; Shakuhachi Festival, Lincoln Center, Yerba Buena Center for the<br/>&gt; Arts (San<br/>&gt; Francisco), Mills College (Oakland), Knitting Factory (New York),<br/>&gt; Session<br/>&gt; House (Tokyo), Tiara Koto Concert Hall (Tokyo) Munster Neue<br/>&gt; Musik Festival<br/>&gt; (Germany), Earshot Jazz Festival (Seattle), Music Gallery<br/>&gt; (Toronto), Center<br/>&gt; For New Music and Audio Technologies (Berkeley), Gainesville<br/>&gt; Jazz Festival,<br/>&gt; Subtropics New Music Festival (Miami), University Of California<br/>&gt; SanDiego,<br/>&gt; Bard College, Stetson College, Rollins College, University of<br/>&gt; Vermont, and<br/>&gt; Earlham College and two appearances as guest soloist with the<br/>&gt; Seattle<br/>&gt; Creative Orchestra.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gelb&apos;s current projects include The Space Between (a trio with<br/>&gt; accordionist<br/>&gt; Pauline Oliveros and pianist Dana Reason), duets with<br/>&gt; interactive<br/>&gt; electronics composer Chris Brown, a trio with violinist Carla<br/>&gt; Kihlstedt and<br/>&gt; cellist Hugh Livingston. Other musicians with whom he<br/>&gt; frequently<br/>&gt; collaborates are koto master Shoko Hikage, multi<br/>&gt; instrumentalist Joe McPhee,<br/>&gt; and synthesizer player Tim Perkis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Philip Gelb&apos;s recordings are available on various labels: Deep<br/>&gt; Listening,<br/>&gt; Sparkling Beatnik, New World/CounterCurrents, Leo, Music482,<br/>&gt; Ryokan, Abray,<br/>&gt; Twisted Village, Limited Sedition, and Cultural Labyrinth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gelb currently lives and teaches in the San Francisco Bay area.<br/>&gt; Apart from<br/>&gt; music, his interests include vegetarian cooking, organic<br/>&gt; gardening, and<br/>&gt; film.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Scott Smallwood - iEAR Studios Technical Director<br/>&gt; Clinical Assistant Professor of Computer Music<br/>&gt; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Anything<br/>outside of that is *never* going to sound &quot;good...&quot;  It&apos;s not in the<br/>esthetic, obviously...  I imagine Catler is a bit like this, too,<br/>although I *believe* he&apos;s used 12-equal in some of his ensemble<br/>pieces for the other players besides his solo guitar...  (Dunno, but<br/>I *think* I&apos;m right on that...)</p><p>My *own* style, however, is considerably more eclectic, so I&apos;m trying<br/>to shove all the great stuff I&apos;ve learned from *you* guys into<br/>my &quot;larger corpus...&quot;</p><p>(That&apos;s a rather painful process...  :)</p><p>JP</p></div>
