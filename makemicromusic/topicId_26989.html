Sibelius is supposed to let me<br/>write quartertone music with &quot;traditional&quot; quartertone notation. At the<br/>moment I am working on a SATB Choral piece using the Unimajor tuning. It is<br/>not serial at the moment - but considering I&apos;m so far disappointed with my<br/>musical results perhaps that would be a good thing to try. There are a lot<br/>of variations at applying a tone row to 4 simultaneous voices.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if I can dig in and apply pitch bends directly like I can in<br/>Sonar. I&apos;m still learning the software - it has a real shift in user<br/>interface from other windows programs that is sort of its own little<br/>universe. Learning it has required a fairly steep learning curve and I&apos;m<br/>still on it. Not as steep as csound though!!</p><p>I am pleased with the quality of the scores it produces, and at least with<br/>the included sample set Sibelius obeys your score directions - in other<br/>words crescendos, ritrarondos,  dynamic markings, accents, etc. etc. are<br/>performed. That is really, really nice. However, as pointed out by Lobawad<br/>the pizzicatos were too loud as exported by the program. (Version 3 of<br/>Turkey Run has my explicit dynamic markings to correct it).</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Thu, Apr 7, 2011 at 11:38 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The piece is a minute long and I tried to make something diatonic<br/>&gt; sounding<br/>&gt; &gt; within the constraints of what I term &quot;relaxed serialism&quot; - I allow<br/>&gt; repeated<br/>&gt; &gt; and simultaneous members of the row.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea has possibilities, but you know you don&apos;t actually need to use an<br/>&gt; edo to use serialism, don&apos;t know?

My experience in college,<br/>where we analyzed the serial implementations of Schoenberg (I can find this)<br/>and Milton Babbit (can&apos;t find this) and also listened to Webern and Berg was<br/>very much skewed towards very dissonant music. At the time I felt that I<br/>could be dissonant without having to resort to serialism and what I saw was<br/>its constraints. I actually feel liberated somehow at this point. Though I<br/>think the number of ideas I&apos;d use serialism for may be numbered. But that is<br/>ok - its another tool.</p><p>I appreciate your idea about the violinist.
