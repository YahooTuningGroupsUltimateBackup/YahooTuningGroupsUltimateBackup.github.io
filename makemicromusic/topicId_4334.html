One modulation source is the keyboard notes.<br/>You could use this as a &quot;rough&quot; tuning of notes per octave for the<br/>oscillators and filters, then use the full keyboard microtuning scale to<br/>add the appropriate offsets.  This would only be useful if you always<br/>used the same number of notes per octave, otherwise you&apos;ll need a unique<br/>voice programmed per scale.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p><p>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/</a></p><p>The Wavemakers Modular and Integrated Synthesizer Web Site<br/><a href="http://www.wavemakers-synth.com/">http://www.wavemakers-synth.com/</a></p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Graham Breed [mailto:graham@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 25, 2003 6:53 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [MMM] Re: Korg z1 keybaord scales<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;(one thing I want to try is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;to tune the keys to a segment of the harmonic series,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;say partials 32-64 or whatever, and or aliquot scales.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel:<br/>&gt; &gt; Not possible then, only way is via pitch bend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, it might be possible, but it gets hairy.
