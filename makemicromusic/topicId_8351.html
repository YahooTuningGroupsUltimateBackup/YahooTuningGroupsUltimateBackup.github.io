Few, it seemed, could match his vision or<br/>hyperactive work ethic. So any given band led by Zappa lasted just a<br/>short time before some inevitable lineup change.</p><p>Worcester Artist Group is focusing though on Zappa&apos;s more endearing<br/>qualities, such as his musical innovations and sense of humor. And<br/>the host of musicians WAG rounded up for its tribute to Zappa can<br/>breathe easier knowing they only have to answer to the easygoing Phil<br/>McNamara and Bob Jordan, instead of a legendary taskmaster.</p><p>Zappa died in December at age 52 after a bout with prostate cancer.<br/>WAG&apos;s McNamara said he and Jordan had been discussing a WAG tribute<br/>to Zappa for a year and wanted to do something wh! ile he was still<br/>alive. &quot;Apart from the hard core, other bands we worked with cited<br/>Zappa as a mentor,&quot; McNamara said. So WAG hoped to have an arts<br/>festival that included music, poetry, and performance all done in a<br/>Zappaesque way.</p><p>Obviously, that never came to be, and in the fall, shortly before<br/>Zappa&apos;s death, WAG lost its performance space in Cherry Valley. WAG<br/>then found it difficult to book any shows and is just coming up to<br/>speed using a variety of listening rooms around Worcester to present<br/>its avant-garde fare. But in putting together a concert with yeP!,<br/>Gingerbutkis and Supergreg and Waterpark, WAG recognized Zappa<br/>qualities as a common thread, McNamara said. So the original triple<br/>bill rock show took on the look of a Zappa tribute and the lineup has<br/>grown to include those three bands and Dan Stearns, Borderland and<br/>John McKeag. Following the music at 12:30 a.m. WAG will show the cult<br/>classic Zappa film &quot;200 Motels.&quot;</p><p>In speaking to some of the artists! taking part in the tribute, a<br/>funny thing came to light. They may re mind a listener of Zappa, but<br/>they never necessarily dove wholeheartedly into his music.</p><p>&quot;Everyone who sees us says, &quot;You guys must listen to a lot of Zappa,&apos;<br/>and we never really did,&quot; said John Shipman, a k a Supergreg, the<br/>guitarist and singer for Supergreg and Waterpark. &quot;I went out and<br/>finally got a few (Zappa) tapes, and I like him. The other guys<br/>don&apos;t, though.&quot;</p><p>Supergreg and Waterpark is a very promising young band that played<br/>pretty regularly at WAG and a few other nightspots in the spring and<br/>summer before going on hiatus. The Zappa tribute will be the band&apos;s<br/>first public show since growing into a quartet with the addition of<br/>drummer Jeff Auburn.</p><p>Avant-guitarist Dan Stearns is another seeming Zappa acolyte, but<br/>simply is not. &quot;I got a lot of my influences early on, and Zappa<br/>wasn&apos;t one of them. That&apos;s simply because I wasn&apos;t exposed to him. I<br/>got a lot more influence from European-based bands that I can tell<br/>now drew from Zappa,&quot; Stearns said.</p><p>Stearn&apos;s dense, dissonance-laden compositions bring to mind<br/>Zappa&apos;s &quot;serious&quot; music, the neo-classical jazz fusions. For this<br/>concert, Stearns wrote two new arrangements featuring guitar, banjo,<br/>bass and drum. Unfortunately he has been hamstrung for a rhythm<br/>section and may have to shift gears before the show. Stearns&apos; band,<br/>Private World, has had 20 members come and go since forming a year<br/>ago. There&apos;s another similarity between Stearns and Zappa.</p><p>The Boston-based trio Gingerbutkis is made up of Zappa fans, but has<br/>never tried to play his music. &quot;We love his approach to arranging,<br/>using lots of movements in one song. That&apos;s something we do,&quot; said<br/>bass player Stephen Villane. Gingerbutkis has found an audience here<br/>with its multi-textured musical forays and plays at the invitation of<br/>WAG every couple of months. &quot;You need to be open minded when you come<br/>to see us. And people who are musically inclined tend to like us. But<br/>others get frustrated and leave the room! ,&quot; Villane said.</p><p>yeP! is one band though that has done its bit of worshiping at the<br/>shrine of Zappa. Matt Laurence, yeP!&apos;s bass player, recalled one band<br/>meeting where everyone sat around and watched the Zappa performace<br/>video &quot;Baby Snakes&quot; for inspiration. The group plays Zappa&apos;s &quot;I Am<br/>the Slime,&quot; but would love to tackle the warped &quot;St. Alphonso&apos;s<br/>Pancake Breakfast&quot; at some point, Laurence said. &quot;Frank Zappa was, no<br/>doubt, a genius of bizarre and wonderful proportions. He stood as a<br/>contradiction in the rock world. He rallied some of the best rock<br/>players, yet was influenced by weird and obscure composers.&quot;</p><p>yeP! plays more of a funk-fueled freewheeling brand of rock than any<br/>Zappa project did. But yeP!&apos;s approach to songwriting takes on a wry<br/>edge that Zappa would appreciate.</p><p>Most of the acts playing the tribute will stick to their own<br/>material, but it should be clear what each shares with the one-of-a-<br/>kind guitarist/composer/social critic/depraved humorist.</p><p>WAG TRIBUTE TO FRANK ZAPPA When: 7 p.m. Friday Where: !
