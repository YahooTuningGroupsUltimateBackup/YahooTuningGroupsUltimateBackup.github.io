And another secret is to get a gig or more of RAM and turn off<br/>&gt; paging.  Then set your hard drive to spin down after 1 min.  The result<br/>&gt; is a silent PC with 25-33% more battery life and prolonged hard drive<br/>&gt; life/reliability (because you&apos;re not running it as much, and you&apos;re<br/>&gt; protecting it from shocks while it&apos;s running).</p><p>Rightio. I&apos;ll bear that in mind. If recording one could record<br/>directly to RAM couldn&apos;t one and not use the hard disk at all.</p><p>Indeed one could set up a virtual RAM drive which I think isn&apos;t<br/>too hard to do (I think it is a matter of adding a line to ones<br/>autoexec.bat or some such)</p><p>Then one could add a command to ones autoexec.bat to<br/>copy the programs one uses into that RAM disk automatically<br/>on start up with everything they need,<br/>and run everything from RAM - and then of course<br/>makes sure that all ones work on the RAM drive gets automatically<br/>mirrored back to the hard disk before it gets switched off.</p><p>Then it would hardly use the hard disk at all, not when<br/>recording anyway.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Laptops come with onboard soundcards.  My thinkpad has a very popular<br/>&gt; one, the Crystal Soundfusion which provides the basic SoundBlaster<br/>&gt; compatible stuff.  Then get something like this for MIDI and good<br/>&gt; quality recording...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tascam.com/product_info.php?pid=253&nav=computer_recording">http://www.tascam.com/product_info.php?pid=253&nav=computer_recording</a></p><p>Okay fine.
