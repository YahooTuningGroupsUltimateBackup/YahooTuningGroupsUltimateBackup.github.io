In the US there are at least 3 professional tuners that orchestral and other players trust their vintage bars to. One fellow I&apos;ve used, and been very pleased with, is John Salazar, who used to be the head bar person at Marimba One:</p><p><a href="http://www.salazarfinetuning.com/index.php">http://www.salazarfinetuning.com/index.php</a></p><p>As to other tunings, the further you would go from 12tet (or the further 12tet bars were out of tune) you start getting into problems. You can move the pitch up and down, but it always entails removal of wood, and at some point the removal starts to degrade the tonal quality of the bar, and eventually destroys the dimensions critical to a good sound. Also, if you were taking a standard 12tet instrument, you couldn&apos;t just, ad hoc, try and turn it into a 24tet instrument, because you need bars that are in the vicinity of a given pitch, and pretty soon you would be trying to tune bars that are much higher or lower than the intended pitch.</p><p>For info from the horse&apos;s mouth on taking stock instruments and putting them into another tuning, ask Kraig Grady. He is on this list (usually) and has tuned a number of instruments to use for his music.</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=12463 href="#12463">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2006 10:41:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Yes.
