Here, I&apos;d prefer to stick what I&apos;ve done -- or, at least, am<br/>about to try in a tuning with which I&apos;m at least a little acquainted.</p><p>By the way, my decision at present to provide ASCII notation rather<br/>than sound files for my examples in 14-tET is only because of my<br/>technical situation. While I can use Scala to produce MIDI files<br/>by coding an ASCII text file with commands for things like note<br/>numbers in a given scale and duration, and then use the &quot;example&quot;<br/>command in Scala to generate a MIDI file and proofread the output with<br/>a utility rendering an ASCII &quot;translation&quot; plus a GNU Emacs Calc<br/>routine to translate pitchbend messages into cents, the system I&apos;m<br/>using doesn&apos;t have any sound card or the like. With a timbre-sensitive<br/>tuning like 14-tET as applied to a neo-medieval style with fifths and<br/>fourths as perfect concords, I&apos;d prefer not to post something in a<br/>registration that I haven&apos;t heard.</p><p>Obviously I&apos;d much prefer to put the sound itself out there, with the<br/>notation as a supplement for those who might want it rather than a<br/>much inferior substitute (hearing my synthesizer timbre might also<br/>saying something about how much beating I&apos;m willing to take in stride<br/>or what my notion of &quot;reasonably smooth concord&quot; is).</p><p>This has meant making a cassette recording, and sending it out to<br/>someone helpful who can translate it into a sound file -- with very<br/>high artistry in the case of someone like Jacky Ligon.</p><p>Anyway, in dealing with this situation at the moment, I can at least<br/>stick on MMM to discussing tunings that I&apos;ve actually used -- adding,<br/>in the case of 15-tET, that composers such as Easley Blackwood and<br/>Brian McLaren have used it and recorded pieces in it.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
