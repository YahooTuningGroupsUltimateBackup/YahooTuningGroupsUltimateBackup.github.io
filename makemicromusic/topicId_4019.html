Beyond that, if you think that Prent Rodgers work qualifies as *musical* then the next step might be to try your hand at working with samples, because if you can get facility with that technique then it wouldn&apos;t be too hard to find commercial samples of synth (or other) sounds you like, and utilize them in the rendering process.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4022 href="#4022">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2002 1:03:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
