IJ&lt;ve come<br/>up with a definition of consonance and a way to measure consonance. If<br/>you are deep into the study of just intonation and you like to scratch<br/>and think you will get a lot out of this cite. My material is all<br/>original and copyrighted. I would be very interested in knowing<br/>whether or not it is a published first. I canJ&lt;t imagine that it is a<br/>literal first in terms of who did it first. I know it was done before.<br/>It is a re-creation of the wheel, so to speak.</p><p><a href="mailto:CoefficientOfConsonance@yahoogroups.com">CoefficientOfConsonance@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>Joseph Bernard</p><p>Posted by Prent Rodgers from an email.</p></div>
