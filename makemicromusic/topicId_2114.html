That&apos;s what this forum is for, and it&apos;s been<br/>of *immense* value to me even so far.</p><p>[Quite possibly I&apos;ve gotten as much out of *this* Forum as the &quot;Main&quot;<br/>forum... although I have to admit some of my &quot;theoretical&quot; background<br/>came from over there...]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, naturally I&apos;m interested in doing something about<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;cheesy&quot; timbres, if possible, and have been exploring the<br/>&gt; &gt; possibility of at least improving them a bit by *reverb* on<br/>&gt; &gt; *this* list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I think FM timbres do well from adding a touch of<br/>&gt; effects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They also do well when combined with analog timbres<br/>&gt; since they each exist in their own complementary timbre<br/>&gt; space - FM sidebands vs analog harmonic overtones. Can<br/>&gt; get more dense mixes by using different families of<br/>&gt; electronic instruments; it&apos;s an orchestration issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheesy sounds can work well if some spatial movement is<br/>&gt; added to. And just about any cheesy sound becomes<br/>&gt; subtle and expressive if do more with it than play it<br/>&gt; from an on/off switch/keyboard perspective -- vary the<br/>&gt; attack and decay rates during a melody line, subtley<br/>&gt; change the eq settings, etc etc - just about any<br/>&gt; element of the audio path is well served by being<br/>&gt; subsumed (right word?) into the set of available<br/>&gt; *compositional* parameters.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Well, at least I can start with *dynamics!*  Embarassingly<br/>enough, I didn&apos;t even know how to do that right before!  And<br/>reverb... and some more effects once I learn how to do them...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it that less people are interested in tuning now<br/>&gt; than 10 years ago? It seems like more are here on the<br/>&gt; net, but the trend in pop music is to use fx processors<br/>&gt; to &apos;harmonize&apos; live vocals to 12tET, creating an<br/>&gt; unearthly robotic sound. Yuck.</p><p>****My guess is that, initially, the engineers *were* interested in<br/>xenharmonics, since, probably many of them, like many of our<br/>math/engineering types on this and the other list who are &quot;into&quot;<br/>music are interested in xenharmonics.</p><p>But, then the *marketing* people get in to it and it&apos;s &quot;Hey, why add<br/>all this stuff when it costs more... here is our *market* and only a<br/>few &quot;weirdos&quot; want this stuff.  Take it out if you still want your<br/>job around here...  :)&quot;</p><p>Just a guess.</p><p>JP</p></div>
