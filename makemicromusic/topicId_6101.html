Much obliged!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bubbly bubble,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; shirley-quirk</p><p>i haven&apos;t been in Philly since late 2000, but i grew up<br/>there 1962-1977, then lived there again 1986-2000, so<br/>i&apos;ve spent a lot of time exploring the Philly music scene.</p><p>there&apos;s a ton of stuff going on, and a lot of it free.</p><p>if you like &quot;Classical&quot; music (or contemporary stuff that<br/>can still fall under that name), by all means keep an eye<br/>on the free recitals at the Curtis Institute of Music.<br/>i used to go all the time, and the performers are some<br/>of the best in any music school anywhere.  the best<br/>concert i saw there was a tribute to George Crumb, and<br/>it was great.</p><p>the Philadelphia Orchestra has a new home down the street<br/>from its old one at the Academy of Music, and despite<br/>recent criticisms (primarily of conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch),<br/>i&apos;m sure it&apos;s still one of the finest orchestras in the world.</p><p>for new music, be sure to check out the other colleges<br/>and universities besides Curtis -- and there are LOTS of<br/>them in and around Philly.</p><p>the University of Pennsylvania is what i miss most,<br/>especially their library, which i think might have a<br/>copy of every single book ever published.  of course<br/>i&apos;m exaggerating ... but probably not by much.  i&apos;ve<br/>done scads of research, and i found music-theory treatises<br/>in there that i had no idea existed.</p><p>Temple University also has a very extensive music program<br/>and library, and is particularly big in the jazz world.</p><p>speaking of jazz, there are more hole-in-the-wall<br/>dive bars with live jazz in Philly than i&apos;ve ever seen<br/>in any other city.</p><p>the main newspapers -- the three big ones last i knew<br/>were the Daily News, and the weekly Welcomat and City Paper<br/>-- all have comprehensive listings.</p><p>and with summer coming, you also might want to watch<br/>what goes on at the &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; ... there are always<br/>big-name acts in Atlantic City, and the clubs in Wildwood<br/>are famous.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2004 6:21:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>and how could i forget ... New York is also only a<br/>2-hour drive or (cheap) train ride away, and of course<br/>there&apos;s even more happening there.  i used to go all the time.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>formicofyle &#x3C;bshirley@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2004 3:57:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz:<br/>    now you got me all excited! much obliged!<br/>-shirley-quirk</p></div>
