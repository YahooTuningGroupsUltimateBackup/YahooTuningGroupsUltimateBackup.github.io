For those of you (like me)<br/>using older Windows apps that can only<br/>address up to 10 MIDI devices (like Encore),<br/>this was a real pain, especially if the<br/>device you wanted happened to be alphabetized<br/>after &quot;MIDI Yoke&quot; (like &quot;UA-1000&quot;).</p><p>At my request, the developer has released<br/>a new version that lets you set the number<br/>of ports.  I just upgraded and it works.<br/>You apparently have to install with 8 ports,<br/>reboot, set to 4 (or whatever) and reboot<br/>again.  But other than that it&apos;s basically<br/>painless.</p><p><a href="http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm">http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
