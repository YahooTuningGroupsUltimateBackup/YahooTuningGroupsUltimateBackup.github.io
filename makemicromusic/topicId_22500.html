Program notes:</p><p>Johnny  Reinhard&rsquo;s CAMBIA was composed to  provoke a previously unknown<br/>time, and place.  Nine years ago, aerial sonar located two  cities on the banks<br/>of an extinct river, now submerged in the Gulf of Cambay, in  Gujarat,<br/>India.  Each city was the size of Manhattan, and radiocarbon  tests traced back<br/>9,500 years, to the end of the ice age.  The instrumentation of three Korean<br/> gayakeums is a direct reference of a descendant of ancient Indian musical<br/>culture.  The natural microtonal  character of the instruments, due to the<br/>extreme bending of the strings, makes  for a fresh tessitura of timbre for<br/>the bassoon to interact.  One might imagine the bassoon as a great  leader of<br/>the imagined ancient land of &ldquo;Cambia.&rdquo;  The inspiration for the piece is<br/>also  largely a result of working with the Yoon sisters for a period of 3<br/>years, and  with their teacher, Rami Seo, for the past year.  The tuning of the<br/>two 12  string-instruments follows a single improvised tuning devised by<br/>the composer  that was duplicated on the second instrument, and then recorded<br/>electronically  for future rehearsals and performance.  Spectacularly<br/>surprising, except for two of the 12 notes, ten of the  microtones are aurally<br/>identical to a previously undisclosed Korean tuning that  still defies a<br/>translation into cents.  However, the full sound spectrum is the true tuning of<br/>the piece, with  the bassoon bouncing off one moment, and leading the way to<br/>ever newer sound  experiences at another.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2010 5:21:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is great!!</p><p>And I especially love your bassoon playing!

Now, the digital sound recording has been merged  with<br/>the video, thanks to Michael Shaffer, on the American Festival of<br/>Microtonal Music&apos;s web site.  It is a great improvement.
