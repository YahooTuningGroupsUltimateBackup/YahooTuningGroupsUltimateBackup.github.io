I compose stuff using the cheesy MIDI synth built into this computer, but I&apos;d never use it in a performance.</p><p>And a lot of hardcore microtonal work you *have* to perform with electronic instruments to get the precise pitches right.</p><p>&gt; Why don&apos;t we network composers and performers?  If we built a list of<br/>&gt; everyone who is willing to play something, maybe we could start to<br/>&gt; write for what&apos;s available.  Virtual ensembles could be created via<br/>&gt; multi-tracking.  Besides the obvious aural results, asking someone to<br/>&gt; invest time into a performance is a great way to get valuable feedback.</p><p>I play fretless bass and oud. The former is a defretted Ibanez six-string, and I play progressive rock/metal with jazz, funk, classical and world-music influences. The latter is a basic Egyptian instrument I got from Lark In The Morning; it sounds pretty nice for the price. I&apos;ve been listening to A LOT of Arabic, Turkish, Greek and Iranian music lately to get my playing style more orthodox. But I have memorized almost all of the maqamat (melodic modes). I use it a great bit as a fretless guitar too, even playing some chords.</p><p>I also need to save up for a decent but inexpensive upright bass. I&apos;d like to do some microtonal bluegrass.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div>
