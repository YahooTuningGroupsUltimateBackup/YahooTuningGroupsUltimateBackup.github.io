I need specific help to get<br/>  my keyboard to access the notes and play in real<br/>  time through my computer&apos;s speakers. The USB driver<br/>  is loaded. I seem to be close but am now stuck.</p><p>  Next day off is Wednesday. If you live in eastern<br/>  Mass I could even call you. E-mail me on or off list<br/>  if you wish. This might take some effort, since I<br/>  don&apos;t know a great deal about MIDI, USB, etc.</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p></div>
