Terminology can be explained to those who don&apos;t get it; people have been explaining things to me for a long time and I quite enjoy it.  I have learned an immense amount of music and mathematical theory from people here and on the tuning list, and I am eminently grateful whenever someone informs me that I&apos;m missing a technical distinction in terminology.  If somebody points out that your usage of a word isn&apos;t proper, take it as educational rather than critical, and move on.</p><p>What *does* scare people off are long-winded rambling posts about vague philosophical points about the community in general, or nit-picking debates about simple and rather inconsequential things.  A simple &quot;oh, I didn&apos;t realize there was a difference, sorry&quot; will do a lot more to keep the stream of discussion focused on useful and interesting topics than will any other response.
