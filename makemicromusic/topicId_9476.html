It&apos;s very good in theory, but I<br/>forsee several difficulties in practice:</p><p>1)Not too many of us here are in possession of microtonal acoustic<br/>instruments.<br/>2)Given the plethora of scales and tunings being explored on this<br/>site (not to mention the broad differings of opinions on the merit of<br/>any given scale), I&apos;m not sure if there would be enough performers<br/>with instruments of the same tunings to constitute an &quot;ensemble&quot;.<br/>3)Multi-track exchanges over the internet are difficult at best,<br/>since everyone&apos;s using different software and not everyone has the<br/>capabilities of recording onto their computers.<br/>4)There is also the problem of notation: some consensus would have to<br/>be reached between the theoretical composer and all the theoretical<br/>performers as to what system to use.  I can&apos;t even begin to go into<br/>the issues of this subject, which has been (and is still being)<br/>debated at great length over on the &quot;tuning&quot; forum, but needless to<br/>say it&apos;d be quite a task to get everyone to agree.</p><p>I don&apos;t mean to pooh-pooh your idea, I&apos;m sure others are more<br/>optimistic than I...heck, if someone wanted to write a fairly simple<br/>prelude for the 22-tET guitar using some type of numerical tablature,<br/>I&apos;d be more than happy to learn it and record it.  But I think we&apos;ve<br/>got a ways to go before we can form any &quot;virtual ensembles&quot;.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chris Bryan&quot;<br/>&lt;melandchris@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it seems to me that one of the biggest weaknesses of a lot of the<br/>&gt; music that gets posted here is that it&apos;s midi stuff.

(The musical saw,<br/>similar in sound to a theremin, has a range of approx. three<br/>continuous octaves.)  Will attempt to play in any tuning system you<br/>can conceive and write in.  If I am a good boy and do some practicing<br/>this summer, I might also be of use on quartertone clarinet and/or<br/>tricesimoprimal (31-equal) bassoon.</p></div>
