And...at the end of the piece, it goes into pure sonic mayhem, using delays to overdrive themselves and create a mass of sound that has nothing to do with key centers. Check out &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; by Hendrix (from &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;)...his use of distortion/whammy bar/feedback creates a wall of sound that is more like a solar wind than anything to do with traditional music. That&apos;s still a field with great experimental possibilities I believe. I also have a couple of CD&apos;s of NASA satellite music...they took frequencies picked up by spacecraft and put them into an audible range, lovely stuff and way atonal. And when Coltrane got into squeakin&apos; and squawkin&apos; it again was beyond key center...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a>  (Oh yeah...on James Brown&apos;s &quot;Super Bad,&quot; there&apos;s a great sax solo that sounds much more like Ornette Coleman than R&amp;B...way atonal, and it works perfectly)<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=27070 href="#27070">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2011 5:39:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yeah the music of Jupiter&apos;s EM field is so beautiful ...</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3fqE01YYWs&feature=player_embedded#">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3fqE01YYWs&feature=player_embedded#</a>!</p><p>Mat Cooper</p></div>
