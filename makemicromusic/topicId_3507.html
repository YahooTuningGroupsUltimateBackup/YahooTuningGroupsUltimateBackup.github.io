I used<br/>&gt; scala&apos;s midi relay which went equally smooth, and did in fact seem<br/>&gt; to produce polyphony.</p><p>Hurray!</p><p>Yes, SCALA does polyphony, but I gather, only one voice at a time at present.<br/>However I somehow wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Manuel adds in multi-timbral<br/>midi relaying at some time in the future...</p><p>FTS can either relay separate voices from each midi in channel, or you can<br/>set the keyboard up so that e.g. left and right halves of keyboard<br/>have their own voices, and then FTS sends the appropriate program change<br/>before the note on in whichever channel it is relayed to.</p><p>That&apos;s easiest if your midi synth lets you play voices at once in the same<br/>channel e.g. flute and oboe both playing at once in channel 1.<br/>I gather that&apos;s the way a modern soundcard GM midi synth normally works.<br/>With that you can retune most midi files to almost any tuning unless the files have<br/>effects such as pan already applied to the channels as well, or<br/>require a lot of pitch polyphony (e.g. you want to retune them<br/>to a scale with more than 15 notes all to be played simultaneously<br/>or a non octave scale with more than 15 pitches of polyphony).</p><p>Even on a soundcard you can still run out of channels in multi-timbral work,<br/>e.g. if the midi clip has many voices each with a particular pan position,<br/>or other effects such as modulation etc. For those the only Midi solution<br/>as far as I know is to use tuning tables as there simply aren&apos;t enough<br/>midi channels available to retune them using pitch bends.</p><p>In FTS the multitimbral midi relaying options are selected from Out | Options<br/>| More options and in the new upload there are three buttons there to<br/>set them to the modern soundcard default, GM synth default, and<br/>non GM synth default.</p><p>&gt; on fts: the computer having troubles lacks a modem or means to<br/>&gt; connect to the internet. I had to reinstall the os because it kept<br/>&gt; freaking out. So I haven&apos;t really had to email an error report :(<br/>&gt; the good news is i should be registering the software soon.</p><p>That&apos;s all right! Anyway if one crops up be sure to send it.</p><p>It&apos;s reassuring that it works on the laptop in win2k.</p><p>Wish you much pleasure with FTS and thanks for registering in advance<br/>for whenever you do!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
