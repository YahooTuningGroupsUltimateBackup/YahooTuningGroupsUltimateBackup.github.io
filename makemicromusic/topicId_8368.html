Though not exhaustive, it looks like 12 note tunings work most often, and everything else confuses it.</p><p>Also, it confirmed one of my suspicions: if one were to attempt utilizing a sampler, you&apos;d need to figure out how the samples would get altered. A simple 12tet sample set (for instance, a complete grand piano) would work moderately well for octave-based tunings of nearly 12 note per, meaning that the notes would be retuned from samples that would be relatively nearby. But something like 7tet would end up stretching samples way beyond a quality level.</p><p>As an example, I can take a good piano sample, edit the 12ET scale so that a C is tuned up 100 cents, and sit there and play the C and C#. Yes, they are the same pitch, but the timbre is quite different now. Therefore, anything but the most moderate alteration from the original sample set yields an instrument that does not have a consistent voicing, if you will.</p><p>I had figured this, theoretically, but it wasn&apos;t until I had an instrument that I could interactively try it that I can see how much work would be involved.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
