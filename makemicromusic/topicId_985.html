Man, could you possibly write more about audio gear? Huh? :)</p><p>In any event, here&apos;s a general item: there is more of a Mac contingent on music or graphics or publishing lists, which tends to balance out the overwhelming preponderance of the WinTel scene. Nonetheless, or maybe more so, it is always a good idea to mention if a piece of gear/software is specific to a platform. I *looked* to me like pretty much everything you mentioned was PC-based, but there were just a couple I wasn&apos;t sure of (is Audio Mulch PC or Mac).</p><p>Just something for us to remember, when offering ideas for others on the list.</p><p>Also, while the SB cards may be totally sucky for anything remotely resembling final production stuff, I always like to keep in mind what the lowest entry (read: barrier) to making micro stuff could be, and in this case a setup of FTS, Scala, and some kind of moderate sound card would at *least* allow someone to hear new intonations, and start the juices flowing. There is always time to upgrade down the road... or that is what all the manufacturers are banking on! :)</p><p>&gt;Every time I hear a set of brakes from a big truck squeal outside my heart &gt;thumps.... ;)</p><p>Hey, even my dog knows the UPS truck two blocks away!</p><p>&gt;I might mention that I am more than willing to help master anyones projects on<br/>&gt;this list. I am willing to take on a couple for free too, so just get in<br/>&gt;contact!</p><p>Man, that is really a wonderful and sharing attitude. You people kill me!</p><p>&gt;Oh, yeah... Here is the last track I created.</p><p>Going to check it out now...</p><p>Cheers, and welcome,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
