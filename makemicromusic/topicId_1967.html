As it turned<br/>out, it was one of those rare moments when you hit existential<br/>paydirt; when you get to bring home a souvenir from the netherworld!</p><p>Anybody know what a &quot;whint&quot; or a &quot;wint&quot; is?</p><p>Sometime before the alarm went off, I had carelessly climbed over a<br/>fence at my grandmother&apos;s farm trampling down some electric fence wire<br/>and stuff in the process. This in turn promptly segued into me trying<br/>to fix a light on the porch of the house which I&apos;d also broke climbing<br/>the fence--ah, who needs the niceties of linear and logical narratives<br/>anyway!</p><p>I asked my grandmother if she happened to have any small nails,<br/>something like a 6d or so, and she said, &quot;you need a whint&quot;, and then<br/>the alarm told me that it was 5:45 AM. So I groggily trudged in the<br/>direction of its incessant nag with the dream lagging about, still<br/>fresh for the taking.</p><p>I&apos;ve had a lot of dreams that have given me oddball knickknacks like<br/>super bizarre number formulas and specific musics that I&apos;ve never<br/>heard before, but I can seldom bring anything back intact. Once awake,<br/>the dissipation rate is astonishing. Its speed and efficiency never<br/>fail to surprise me.</p><p>So while a whint (or a wint) may seem a rather underwhelming trifle in<br/>the cocksure sobriety of the ambulatory state, it&apos;s been my experience<br/>that the netherworld is pretty stingy when it comes to sharing<br/>specifics with the waking world.</p><p>So, what&apos;s a whint? Well, it seemed to be some name for a nail, and it<br/>seemed no more odd at the time than just that either. However, it was<br/>my grandmother, someone I share many profound affinities with, and she<br/>didn&apos;t say a nail--she said a whint, so I&apos;ll take my chances and<br/>assume she didn&apos;t mean a nail... Oh what a curious marvel the<br/>slumbering mind is, and what far-flung corners of nowhere I can find<br/>myself in!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2002 8:42:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Anybody know what a &quot;whint&quot; or a &quot;wint&quot; is?</p><p>Thought you might like to take a look at:</p><p><a href="http://www.soleilmoon.com/store/updatesdetail.lasso?update=35">http://www.soleilmoon.com/store/updatesdetail.lasso?update=35</a></p><p>...and read this on the page (the CD is entitled &quot;whint&quot;):</p><p>ABSOUTE[LONDON] / TOUCH<br/>03878 FRANCISCO LOPEZ+ ZBIGNIEW KARKOWSKI Whint 2xCD $14.99<br/>&quot;Francisco L&oacute;pez has started his own label, which will release<br/>collaborations between himself and other artists. Due to constant<br/>travelling, Francisco has decided to realize this label with the help<br/>of a few other labels. Therefore, absolute will have branches in<br/>London, Vienna, Osaka, New York City, and Seattle.</p><p>Zbigniew Karkowski and Francisco L&oacute;pez share a common ground in their<br/>respective work with the physicality of sound through a passionate<br/>approach forcefully devoid of conceptual elements. Raw sonic energy<br/>and an intense focus on the intricacies of sound matter. They both<br/>have a long history of solo work, collaborations and performances all<br/>over the world.</p><p>&quot;whint&quot; is their first studio collaboration, recorded by commission of<br/>The Compound in San Francisco. Using white noise as the only sound<br/>source material, they generated and transformed a common pool of<br/>sounds together, and then created two independent pieces in separate<br/>studio rooms. A common sonic spirit and two different compositional<br/>personalities. Two amazing drifting voyages into the same essential<br/>sonic micro-universe of the &quot;sound of all sounds&quot;.
