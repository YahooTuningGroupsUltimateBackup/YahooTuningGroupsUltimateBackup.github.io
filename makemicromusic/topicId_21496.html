He always has something unique and wonderful on his Thursday program.</p><p>You absolutely must download the latest program from Thu, November 12, 2009, only available for another few days. He played a cut of Jon Catler that was out of this world.  You have to advance to the 1 hour and 41 minutes in the program to get to the Catler tune (or listen to the whole thing if you want). The song is called 13 O&apos;clock Blues by Willie McBlind on his album Bad Thing.</p><p>The program is available here:<br/><a href="http://archive.kpfk.org/parchive/mp3/kpfk_091112_100030gv_john.MP3">http://archive.kpfk.org/parchive/mp3/kpfk_091112_100030gv_john.MP3</a><br/>or here: <a href="http://64.27.15.184/parchive/">http://64.27.15.184/parchive/</a> look for Global Village Thursdays (the other days have other people). They drop the shows sometimes very quickly.</p><p>Other cuts by Catler here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002X0ZGXQ/ref=dm_sp_alb?ie=UTF8&qid=1258429134&sr=8-10">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002X0ZGXQ/ref=dm_sp_alb?ie=UTF8&qid=1258429134&sr=8-10</a></p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
