For example, when I got the 34 tone electric bass in the mail 10 years ago, within 5 minutes of playing it, I had stumbled on what would become the bassline for my tune &quot;Microseconds.&quot; Of course, after that I had to do some gruntwork to come up with the melody and overall form, but the basis of the tune just sort of happened.<br/>   And, somehow, that seems to be how many of my compositions came to be. I do have a lot of theoretical concepts I&apos;m familiar with, and an awful lot of hands on playing under my fingers, so sure, it all adds up. And, for example, I have a couple of future pieces planned out in 34...one will work off the cycle of 34 major 3rds, and the other off the 2 cycles of 5ths which are in the system. So, when it&apos;s time, I&apos;ll sit down and start playing through those patterns, and I&apos;m confident that, sooner or later, a theme or two will appear. Then, it&apos;s only a matter of time till a form takes shape, and a piece will be the end result.<br/>   For me, the name of the compositional game is endless variations on a theme...so, once I get a melodic fragment, then I can usually take it and come up with what I need for a song. Bach is my mentor in composition, overall. Nobody could do variations like he did, he&apos;s a great inspiration.<br/>   And I am familiar with the chain of minor 3rds in 34, Erv sent me a paper on that some years ago, haven&apos;t sat down with it yet, but it&apos;s another concept that ought to be good for a tune or two...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=13327 href="#13327">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2006 9:15:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>How do you usually tune the open strings of your 34-tone guitar?
