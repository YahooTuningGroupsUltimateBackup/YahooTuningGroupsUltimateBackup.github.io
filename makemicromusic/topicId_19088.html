Waves are waves and regardless<br/>of the medium follow common rules.</p><p>Keep in mind however that octave equivalence is a property of the ear<br/>and mind, not of the sound itself. It happens when a sound detector<br/>hears some equivalence between one frequency and double that<br/>frequency. This usually means the detector is at least in part a tuned<br/>resonator. The sound waves pretty much ignore each other while they<br/>travel through the air. The comparison and connection happens in the<br/>ear. Most of the musical properties we know (consonance etc) happen<br/>because of how we perceive sound.</p><p>To paraphrase if a symphony is played in the forest and there is no<br/>one to hear it there is no music. Music is largely a matter of<br/>perception.</p><p>If you want to find equivalence in other spectra you need to think<br/>about how it would eventually be perceived. One simplistic possibility<br/>would be to translate it to sound. According to wikapedia the eye sees<br/>from 400&ndash;790 terahertz which is less than an octave so by definition<br/>there will not be octave equivalence in what we see. Also the<br/>detectors in the eye are not based on resonant coupling, at least not<br/>the way we tend to think of it, However we could easily translate<br/>certain frequencies of light into certain frequencies of sound and<br/>then listen to the result</p><p>The eye is a much less sophisticated sensor than the ear. The ear can<br/>not only hear over 9 octaves but it can distinguish between<br/>frequencies only a few cents apart. This is a simplification but the<br/>eye basically has two color sensors  covering two frequency ranges<br/>with a substantial overlap. The three primary colors are basically:<br/>sensor one sees something, sensor two sees something. both sensors see<br/>something. All other colors are sort of in between these three. As I<br/>said this is a simplification.</p><p>On Sat, Jun 21, 2008 at 12:48 PM, robert thomas martin<br/>&lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The electro-magnetic spectrum consists of more than just light waves.<br/>&gt; There are also X-rays, ultraviolet, infrared, radio waves etc. These<br/>&gt; are all wavelike energy manifestations which can be described in<br/>&gt; frequencies and thus ratios and cents if some sort of accuracy can be<br/>&gt; established.

Even though<br/>acoustics has lots of non-linearities in it acoustics is linear to<br/>more than a first approximation. The non-linearities cause only subtle<br/>second or third order effects. You would be more accurate to say</p><p>&quot;Most acoustic systems are essentially linear but there are minor<br/>non-linear effects that must be considered.&quot;</p><p>You can go a long ways and be quite productive pretending that<br/>acoustics is linear because most of it is.</p><p>This is similar to the issue of the period of a pendulum. Pendulums<br/>were used for years for high accuracy clocks because &quot;they have the<br/>same period no matter how high they swing.&quot; Many of us were taught<br/>this in school. Unfortunately it is not true except as a first<br/>approximation. Pendulums are accurate time keepers only if you keep<br/>them swinging by a roughly constant amount which rule all good<br/>mechanical clock designs enforce. So pendulums are actually non linear<br/>but you can make them appear linear if you use them in constrained<br/>circumstances.</p><p>Audio is the same.

Even though<br/>&gt; acoustics has lots of non-linearities in it acoustics is linear to<br/>&gt; more than a first approximation. The non-linearities cause only subtle<br/>&gt; second or third order effects. You would be more accurate to say<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Most acoustic systems are essentially linear but there are minor<br/>&gt; non-linear effects that must be considered.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can go a long ways and be quite productive pretending that<br/>&gt; acoustics is linear because most of it is.</p><p>This is true, but if you assume everything is perfectly linear then<br/>there is no reason to believe that JI intervals are anything special<br/>(except for timbres that already have perfectly harmonic overtones<br/>like totally non-stiff strings). The reason JI intervals are special<br/>in general is because of nonlinear effects like harmonic and<br/>difference tone generation.</p><p>&gt; This is similar to the issue of the period of a pendulum. Pendulums<br/>&gt; were used for years for high accuracy clocks because &quot;they have the<br/>&gt; same period no matter how high they swing.&quot; Many of us were taught<br/>&gt; this in school. Unfortunately it is not true except as a first<br/>&gt; approximation. Pendulums are accurate time keepers only if you keep<br/>&gt; them swinging by a roughly constant amount which rule all good<br/>&gt; mechanical clock designs enforce. So pendulums are actually non linear<br/>&gt; but you can make them appear linear if you use them in constrained<br/>&gt; circumstances.</p><p>Aha, but what about the phenomenon of two weakly coupled pendula<br/>locking in phase? If the pendula were perfectly linear, that would<br/>never happen. It&apos;s a fundamentally nonlinear phenomenon.</p><p>&gt; Audio is the same. The non linearities are there but usually you can<br/>&gt; ignore them.</p><p>I claim that if you ignore the nonlinearity you ignore phenomena that<br/>are musically important.</p><p>&gt; By the way the worst non-linearities in music come from non-linear<br/>&gt; electronics, not from non-linear acoustical systems.
