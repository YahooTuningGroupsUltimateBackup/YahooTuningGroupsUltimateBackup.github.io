In particular, the convex<br/>breed closure of the 7-limit tonality diamond can be tuned justly and<br/>it would work just fine:</p><p>! diaconv2401.scl<br/>Breed convex closure of 7-limit diamond<br/>17<br/>!<br/>50/49<br/>8/7<br/>7/6<br/>6/5<br/>60/49<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>7/5<br/>10/7<br/>3/2<br/>8/5<br/>80/49<br/>5/3<br/>12/7<br/>7/4<br/>49/25<br/>2</p><p>This has five otonal and five utonal tetrads, but one of the utonal<br/>tetrads is off of just by 2401/2400, which is less than a cent. It<br/>would be interesting to see what someone could make of this for<br/>compositional purposes, but I don&apos;t think you could do much with it<br/>using actual pianos.</p><p>Here&apos;s the 5-limit 17-note dwarf, which is wilson_17, an Erv Wilson scsle:</p><p>! dwarf17_5.scl<br/>Dwarf(&lt;17 27 39|) = wilson_17<br/>17<br/>!<br/>135/128<br/>10/9<br/>9/8<br/>32/27<br/>5/4<br/>81/64<br/>4/3<br/>45/32<br/>40/27<br/>3/2<br/>128/81<br/>5/3<br/>27/16<br/>16/9<br/>15/8<br/>160/81<br/>2</p><p>This has eight major and eight minor triads, though one of the minor<br/>triads is off by a schisma (less than two cents.) It also has two<br/>otonal and two utonal tetrads if we make use of 225/224-tetrads, which<br/>are quite usable. This scale can be viewed as a modified version of<br/>the schismatic/garibaldi 17 note scale--it is a chain of fifths, with<br/>one of the fifths flat by a schisma. You therefore get a very closely<br/>related scale by taking Pythagorean[17], the 17-note Pythagorean scale.</p></div><h3><a id=15405 href="#15405">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2006 2:10:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding the instruments:  how is the string trio tuning to 17?

I would strongly<br/>suggest the string players resort to tied frets a la the viol family, to<br/>maintain accurate intonation -- at least, if 17-edo is going to be the<br/>primary tuning. Thin mono-filament nylon works well (or perhaps even<br/>silk string) if gut fretting isn&apos;t available. I used this method on my<br/>violin and &apos;cello when experimenting with tunings in the past; but nylon<br/>mono-filament has to be secured in place on the back of the neck with<br/>simple adhesive tape.</p><p>An alternative to fretting would be very narrow strips of light-colored<br/>peel-and-stick adhesive paper, to indicate accurate fingerings. These<br/>last much longer than erasable marks.</p><p>My vote goes for keeping the sharp/flat convention overall, as it has<br/>been somewhat established in the minds of both composers and performers.<br/>Quarter-flat and quarter-sharp accidentals (indicating one scale step<br/>down or up) would help with notating a chord like 0 - 352.9 - 705.8 -<br/>1058.7 as &quot;C - E quarter flat - G - B qtr. flat&quot;, instead of &quot;C - D# - G<br/>- A#&quot;; and with melodic passages like &quot;B qtr. flat - C qtr. sharp - D<br/>qtr. sharp - E&quot; instead of &quot;A# - Db - Eb - E natural&quot;.

Any 17 tone tuning (EDO or not) falls very<br/>naturally into the idea of &quot;flats aren&apos;t the same as sharps but otherwise<br/>it&apos;s the same notation&quot;... but...</p><p>Adjusted fingerings would be required, e.g., on fretless strings such as<br/>violin or cello, in any case because the intervals are all different.</p><p>Oh, and you would have to tune the strings to the wide fifths of the 17<br/>edo scale to start with. It actually shouldn&apos;t be too difficult for<br/>experienced players to learn the appropriate fingerings, if they know what<br/>they&apos;re listening for.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
