Here I&apos;ll use numbers to<br/>show modifications of a Pythagorean pitch (based on a chain or pure<br/>fifths or fourths) by one or more septimal commas of 64:63 (~27.26<br/>cents):</p><p>   E1      F#2   G0      A1      B1     C#2   D0      E1<br/>   1/1     8/7   7/6     4/3     3/2    12/7  7/4     2/1<br/>    0      231   267     498     702    933   969     1200</p><p>Interestingly, and very pleasantly, the small 49:48 steps (~35.70<br/>cents) sound to me like convincing although &quot;different&quot; semitones,<br/>possibly with the categorical distinctions between large major second<br/>or sixth and small minor third or seventh reinforcing this effect<br/>above a drone.</p><p>As has been commented, the special charm of the 49:48 steps<br/>distinguishes this kind of Dorian from another kind which I also love<br/>and indeed favor in just and tempered systems, for example:</p><p>   D1      E1    F0      G1      A1     B1    C0      D1<br/>   1/1     9/8   7/6     4/3     3/2   27/16  7/4     2/1<br/>    0      204   267     498     702    906   969     1200</p><p>This has the typical 28:27 semitones or thirdtones (since they&apos;re<br/>equal to about a third of a 9:8 tone) of Archytas, around 62.96<br/>cents.</p><p>I&apos;d like to compose something using Robert&apos;s scale, possibly with some<br/>extra tones now and then to facilitate certain progressions, such as<br/>this one involving the great 16:21:24:28 sonority: in my keyboard<br/>tuning discussed above, A1-D0-E1-G0:</p><p>          G0     F#1<br/>          E1     F#1<br/>          D0     B1<br/>          A1     B1</p><p>This calls for the note F#1 to form a pure fifth in the resolving<br/>sonority, in distinction to the &quot;native&quot; F#2 of this scale.</p><p>Another remark: Robert, your scale also led me to note this very nice<br/>Dorian scale in 25-tET, which I might call the most &quot;usual&quot; version of<br/>Dorian, and in my keyboard mapping is played like this:</p><p>    C      D   Eb      F     G     A   Bb     C<br/>    0     240  288    480   720   912  960   1200</p><p>Since 25-tET isn&apos;t a regular diatonic tuning (to borrow Easley<br/>Blackwood&apos;s term) where you can take five identically sized &quot;whole<br/>tones&quot; and two identically sized &quot;semitones&quot; to make a 2:1 octave,<br/>I&apos;ll refer to my &quot;usual quasi-diatonic semitone&quot; of 48 cents. This<br/>step is somewhere between the 49:48 (~36 cents) of Robert&apos;s scale and<br/>the 28:27 (~63 cents) of a more familiar (to me) septimal Dorian.</p><p>One analysis might explain this scale as simply the 5-tET steps plus<br/>my customary values for the &quot;usual&quot; minor third and major sixth at 288<br/>cents and 912 cents. (In 25-tET, what I call &quot;alternatives thirds&quot; are<br/>also available at 336 cents and 384 cents, and the 240-cent major<br/>second can also serve as a &quot;quasi-third,&quot; so that one can get lots of<br/>different nuances).</p><p>Again, Robert, thank you for introducing me to such a charming scale:<br/>fascinated as I am with the 48-cent semitones of 25-tET, I&apos;m impressed<br/>by those 36-cent steps which nicely define the difference between a<br/>septimal major second or sixth and a minor third or seventh.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6672 href="#6672">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2004 7:19:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh, and Aaron, if you were reading it, what I wrote about 22-equal<br/>below also applies to your tuning . . . the chain of (36:7)^(1/4)<br/>s . . . have you tried aeolian and dorian scales with it, or just<br/>pentatonics so far?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks!

I agree that the<br/>semitones are convincing small steps especially<br/>when the harmonic context makes them distinctive<br/>in their role. I have a fondness for small<br/>semitones too.</p><p>I had the pleasure of finding this scale for myself<br/>as a new one (to me), though of course it is now<br/>about a thousand years old at least, with Al Farabi in<br/>the tenth century AD as the original discover<br/>(unless someone else preceded him).<br/>I wonder how many people have come across it<br/>in various ways and it explored it in all those<br/>centuries.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been wondering about how you might<br/>extend it to a scale of e.g. 12 notes since<br/>that is convenient on a conventional keyboard<br/>single manual.</p><p>BTW I have tried out your double manual style<br/>of playing from time to time. What I found is<br/>that the keyboards I tried are rather deep, so you<br/>can&apos;t stretch a single hand from one of the<br/>manuals to the other. But I know there are<br/>keyboards that are less deep than these.</p><p>Do you play them two handed with one hand for each manual<br/>(in that case apart from the extra range you get<br/>with two keyboards, and the shorter distance to<br/>move the hands, one could also play on a keyboard divided<br/>left and right with a comma difference in tuning<br/>or whatever one wants between the two halves<br/>- as I did in my improvisation in your<br/>sesquisexta scale).</p><p>Or do you have keyboards shallow enough so that<br/>you can play on two at once with a single<br/>hand? Come to think of it, one only needs<br/>one shallow keyboard, for the one that<br/>sits on top.</p><p>BTW I have added a new option to FTS<br/>to make any formula you like into<br/>a wave to use e.g. for example<br/>chords in harmonic timbres<br/>- but also they can be made into<br/>sound fonts e.g. for the SB Live! or<br/>for Giga. After I have finished the<br/>upload I&apos;ll try making a few fonts<br/>for both of those, and make<br/>them available.

So there is clearly a bit of an art<br/>&gt; &gt; to this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is one of the most fascinating posts I&apos;ve seen in a long time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you mind getting a bit deeper on all this on one of the more<br/>&gt; analytical lists, such as harmonic_entropy, tuning, or tuning-math?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d enjoy that, anyway.</p><p>The curves are maybe best explained<br/>with screen shots of them - I&apos;ll<br/>do some to follow this up.</p><p>The basic mathematical idea I used<br/>is to let the user enter any mathematical formula<br/>to set a curve for either the<br/>quarter, half or complete wave.</p><p>If it is intended for a quarter wave, FTS adds a constant<br/>term to ensure that it starts at 0.<br/>Then it does the other three quarters<br/>so that they all join up seamlessly<br/>- continuous lines anyway though they<br/>may not be smooth where the various<br/>quarters meet.</p><p>If it is intended for a half curve, then it<br/>does two rotated copies, so again<br/>they meet up and indeed this time<br/>they will meet up smoothly too if the<br/>original curve is smooth at origin.<br/>This time it adds a linear term to<br/>ensure that the start and end points of the<br/>curve are both 0.</p><p>If it is a complete wave, then FTS<br/>will add a quadratic term to ensure<br/>that the two endpoints of the curve<br/>are both zero, and that in between<br/>it has as much of the curve above<br/>as below the zero line (so that<br/>the areas above and below are equal).<br/>This won&apos;t necessarily always be a smooth<br/>curve where they endpoints meet up<br/>from one wave to the next however.</p><p>It then normalises the result so that<br/>whatever your formula, the maximum<br/>height of the wave remains the same.</p><p>So you can use any formula for any<br/>of those, e.g. you could use say, x^3<br/>for all three and it would still<br/>work and make continuous<br/>repeating sound waves you can play<br/>and listen to.</p><p>You also have a choice of a few<br/>presets too - sine waves,<br/>triangles, a sine triangle, and<br/>repeated sines which make a kind<br/>of a rounded square wave,<br/>and you can morph any of your<br/>curves with a sine wave to<br/>make a curve that is between<br/>the two (e.g. 80 % your curve<br/>and 20 % sine or whatever).</p><p>Then it adds together any desred number<br/>of these waves to make<br/>a harmonic series. The series<br/>can be quantised to the current<br/>scale <a href="http://e.g.to">e.g.to</a> 7-et or 12-et or whatever.</p><p>Then the Setherised thing is a matter<br/>partly of personal preference I think<br/>- maybe the Setherised sine curve harmonic timbres<br/>are in a sense smoother but they also have more obvious beats<br/>(i.e. for each single note on its own)<br/>while more complex curves end up with<br/>a kind of uniform texture or roughness<br/>so that you don&apos;t hear the beats within<br/>that texture so clearly, so it<br/>may sound more harmonious in some sense<br/>if not really smoother.</p><p>The x^n*sin(1/x^n)  etc family of curves<br/>which I tried out is quite interesting here - when you set<br/>n high you get something more like a series<br/>of fast clicks, so a buzz, rather than a<br/>wave, and the more it is like that then<br/>the less you notice any beats, but the<br/>note gets very kind of rough (an interesting<br/>texture and still with a distinctive<br/>pitch in it but a bit more towards a kind of<br/>coloured noise rather than a note).</p><p>Anyway when I have some time after the upload<br/>I&apos;ll do a web page about it with graphics<br/>and sound clips, and some sound fonts<br/>and Gigs to download for users of the<br/>SB soundcards or others that can use<br/>SF2 fonts, and for users of GigaSampler<br/>/ GigaStudio. They consist of just<br/>single waves so are tiny and the new</p><p>FTS has an option to make wave clips<br/>for all the octaves for a sound font in one go.</p><p>However for best pitch accuracy you want<br/>the high pitch waves to be an integral<br/>number of samples. At present it<br/>uses 1/100 of the sample rate<br/>for the 1/1 of the sound font samples as it were,<br/>and then goes up and down in octaves<br/>from that point. So that pitches<br/>them at A = 441, then if you want<br/>A = 440 you can adjust the<br/>result down by 4 cents when you use<br/>the sound font.</p><p>If you try A = 440 at 44.1 Khz<br/>that doesn&apos;t work well. It is important<br/>to get the numbers right there as<br/>the higher notes have very few samples,<br/><a href="http://e.g.at">e.g.at</a> A = 441, then a uses<br/>100 samples for a single wave, a&apos; uses 50, and a&apos;&apos; uses<br/>only 25. Clearly something like<br/>49.5 approximated by 50 there would throw<br/>the pitch well out. Best solution would<br/>be if you could use the lowest pitch wave<br/>for everything but in the SF2 fonts<br/>anyway it seems it won&apos;t let you raise the<br/>pitch more than about an octave or two.<br/>(will be interested to know if anyone<br/>has any tips about this).</p><p>The other solution is to record<br/>a train of e.g. 100 waves<br/>instead of a single wave,<br/>which is an alternative - though the single<br/>wave is more elegant.</p><p>Another idea is to set A=440 and<br/>then save the sound clips at<br/>44 Khz which you can do in FTS<br/>and I think the SF2 format anyway<br/>can handle data in that format,<br/>and play it at the appropriate pitch, will see.</p><p>More later when I do the web page,<br/>and will be interested to know if<br/>anyone has any tips on the sound fonts.<br/>Also has anyone come across any other program<br/>that lets you play any mathematical equation<br/>you like to enter as a sound wave?</p><p>If anyone has any particular questions<br/>be sure to ask too,</p><p>Best,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=6705 href="#6705">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2004 8:03:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Rightio, I&apos;ve posted a reply to tuning and then<br/>it can be followed up wherever.</p><p>...</p><p>Sorry everyone - I have just posted it to<br/>MMM instead by mistake (and had this one originally<br/>addressed to tuning).</p><p>Best,<br/>Robert</p><p>&gt; This is one of the most fascinating posts I&apos;ve seen in a long time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you mind getting a bit deeper on all this on one of the more<br/>&gt; analytical lists, such as harmonic_entropy, tuning, or tuning-math?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d enjoy that, anyway.</p></div><h3><a id=6708 href="#6708">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2004 12:50:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Then the Setherised thing is a matter<br/>&gt; partly of personal preference I think<br/>&gt; - maybe the Setherised sine curve harmonic timbres</p><p>I&apos;m assuming you mean Sethares-style inharmonic timbres, which are<br/>neither sine curves nor harmonic timbres.

I wondered how it happened.<br/>I was using a harmonic series of quite a few terms, e.g.<br/>5 terms or 13. I wonder if missing out some of the partials<br/>may be a way to reduce those beats then. Well tht will<br/>probably be for another upload after this - I plan to<br/>add options to let the user set the volumes individually<br/>for each partial (and the pitches too if they like).<br/>Right now it just does them with the volumes<br/>decreasing as you go up the series.</p><p>Meanwhile what I can do is to add radios to do<br/>only the odd harmonics or only odd prime<br/>harmonics - to reduce the number of partials<br/>so of combination tones - maybe that will help make<br/>the Setherised chords smoother.</p><p>Just as a taster, here is a screen shot:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/xpn_sin_1oxpn.gif">http://www.robertinventor.com/xpn_sin_1oxpn.gif</a></p><p>Shows x^n sin(1/x^n) though can&apos;t remember what n was<br/>- it&apos;s just a screen shot I made for debugging.</p><p>Normally all the ripples would be about the zero line,<br/>but it is curved like this because of the quadratic term<br/>that gets added to make the areas above and below<br/>the zero line the same size, as they are in normal<br/>sound waves.</p><p>As you vary the parameters in another window,<br/>(including the n) then the curve<br/>changes instantly in the oscilloscope and you can click<br/>the Play this button to hear it.</p><p>I&apos;ve cc&apos;d this to tuning, and posted another reply<br/>to your post there.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=6711 href="#6711">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2004 3:41:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve cc&apos;d this to tuning,</p><p>Thanks, I replied there.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
