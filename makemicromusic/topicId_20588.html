Charles Lucy replied to the first post, no-one seems to have noticed the second one at all.</p><p>I thought the second one might be relevant with all the discussion there about phi ratio tunings recently. But by recently I mean a week or two ago and though the conversation still seems something to do with phi ratios, I&apos;m not really sure what it is about exactly - it is easy to get out of sync with everyone else when you don&apos;t have time to read old posts to get up to date. Anyway never mind, got plenty of other things to do :-)...</p><p>Nice turn of phrase :-). Would like to be like that indeed, so many byways and there are plenty of people following the well beaten paths so I think space for a few who turn corners, and you never know quite what you might find.</p><p>Robert<br/><a href="http://www.bouncemetronome.com">http://www.bouncemetronome.com</a></p><p>&gt; hello there robert, you should post this to the tuning list as well<br/>great to see you&apos;re still turning corners others walk straight by.<br/>daniel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
