Shamisen is<br/>a popular tranditional Japanese instrument with three strings played with a large club-<br/>shaped bachi.<br/>I am an amateur shamisen player and would-be composer. After studying some of the<br/>classical genres like naga-uta (used in Kabuki theater etc.) and songs like ha-uta (short<br/>song) and zokkyoku (popular song), I found a following scale could cover most of<br/>traditional practice of hoso-zao (&quot;narrow-pole&quot; shamisen) playing. Common tunings are<br/>hon-chosi (B-E-B&apos;), ni-agari (B-F#-B&apos;) and san-sagari (B-E-A).<br/>Below is a Scala print out with my notation system (the tonal center is E).<br/>Shamisen_Ritsu_Yang_Yin<br/>  0:          1/1           E          unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         27/26              F      tridecimal comma<br/>  2:          9/8           F#         major whole tone<br/>  3:        243/208             Gb<br/>  4:         32/27          G          Pythagorean minor third<br/>  5:         81/64          G#         Pythagorean major third<br/>  6:       2187/1664            Ab<br/>  7:          4/3           A          perfect fourth<br/>  8:         18/13              Bb     tridecimal augmented fourth<br/>  9:          3/2           B          perfect fifth<br/> 10:         81/52              C<br/> 11:         27/16          C#         Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 12:        729/416             Db<br/> 13:         16/9           D          Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 14:        243/128         D#         Pythagorean major seventh<br/> 15:          2/1           E          octave</p><p>Followings are underlying observations.<br/>1. The Ritsu-Yang-mode is made of Pythagorean pentatonic: E-F#-A-B-D-E: A and B are<br/>perfect 4th and 5th, and all diatonic intervals (E-F#, A-B, D-E) are Pythagorean whole tone<br/>(9/8).<br/>2. The Ritsu-Yin-mode is made of minor pentatonic with less-than-half tone intervals<br/>above the tonic E and 5th B: E-C-B-A-F-E (in a descending order). The intervals of the<br/>half tones (C-B and F-E) are not rigorous and seem to depend genres, schools,<br/>individuals, in particular songs or phrases etc. but they do not exceed the 12-ET half<br/>tone. I prefer the string ratio (27/26), the one-third of the whole tone intervals, which<br/>maybe the smallest end of the spectrum. One practical reason is that the one-third<br/>interval is very easy to locate if the whole tone positions are marked on the pole.<br/>3. Yang and Yin modes are freely mixed in compositions, although tones like F and F# do<br/>not appear in same phrases.<br/>4. In highly developed compositions like naga-utas, there are frequent modulations of the<br/>tonal center. In most cases, the music starts in E but temporary modulates to B or A or F#<br/>or C# and returns to E as shown by Haiko Ohtsuka (&quot;Pitch Theory in the Music of the<br/>Shamisen&quot;, Ongakunotomo-sha, 1995, in Japanese). This scale covers all the modulations<br/>shown above.<br/>5. Since this scale is essentially Pythagorean, it is easily adapted in MIDI hardware or<br/>software synthesizers with Pythagorean tuning by selecting out F, C and &quot;flat&quot; tones into a<br/>different instrumental channel tuned (100-65.33) cents below. By manipulating this value,<br/>it is also possible to find out the most favorable intervals for the less-than-the-half<br/>tones.<br/>6. I made one realization from standard naga-uta repertories using Siberius V3 and<br/>Cubase SX3 with FM7 softsynth in my home page though no attempt was made for faithful<br/>simulation of shamisen sounds or rhythmic modulations.</p><p>Nobuo Munakata &lt;<a href="http://www.toshima.ne.jp/~edogiku">http://www.toshima.ne.jp/~edogiku</a>&gt;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2008 8:26:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you so much for sending this. buried in some papers here is a recent study done in Japan on Koto Tunings done by ear. Often they found a semitone 25/24 which would make sense having a difference tone a &apos;fifth below the lower note.
