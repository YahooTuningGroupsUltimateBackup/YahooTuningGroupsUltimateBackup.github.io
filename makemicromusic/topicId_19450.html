Since it&apos;s a MIDI sequence, the swung notes are going to sound mechanical, and a faster tempo would cover that up a bit. And stride is supposed to be played pretty fast, since a stride is a jazz rag, and a rag is vaguely a syncopated march. An example: Eubie Blake&apos;s &quot;The Baltimore Todolo&quot; (this guy on piano is good; who cares if it&apos;s 12-ET!): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ebl4bh7bfs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ebl4bh7bfs</a> . He&apos;s playing in about 100-120, but he does get loose with the tempo and rhythm, which you definitely want to do.</p><p>Though his performance of Scott Joplin&apos;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; is a little _too_ fast: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrPtS1aRdME">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrPtS1aRdME</a> (he takes over on piano from the first player, who plays it about right, IMO). I think he&apos;s just showing off here.</p><p>Programming rubato in a MIDI file can be a fun if not tedious process. Usually the latter.
