See</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/miracle.htm">http://x31eq.com/miracle.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>The first change is obviously to introduce new harmonies.  I have<br/>segregated intervals into four levels of dissonance, roughly guided by the<br/>integer limit and interval width.  You could think about starting and<br/>ending on perfect consonances, and always moving up or down the dissonance<br/>hierarchy by one step.</p><p>Another idea is that intervals within the decimal scale count as &quot;normal&quot;<br/>and most of the melody should be composed of them, even when it uses more<br/>than 10 notes.  That&apos;s equivalent to only using diatonic intervals even in<br/>chromatic music.</p><p>And a less obvious difference is that you have intervals of 8:7 and 7:6<br/>that are somewhere between the steps and leaps of traditional theory, so<br/>you have to blur the rules accordingly.</p><p>I&apos;ve written bits of music like this, but not enough to know present a<br/>finished set of rules.  Still, it is an interesting direction, and I plan<br/>to look into it more.</p><p>Another thing is that certain progressions which work in 12-equal but not<br/>5-limit JI can be spiced up with 9- or even 11-limit intervals and made<br/>more coherent.  That would make more sense with staff notation, using<br/>modifiers to get to the exotic intervals.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1453 href="#1453">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2001 1:48:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &lt;xbrianskix@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi, yall...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Being relatively new to microtonality, I hope you<br/>&gt; forgive any errors/stupidities in my post.

He was a master of the common practice style, and explored<br/>the new types of intervals he encountered, developing a kind of<br/>counterpoint combining new and old. For example, he concluded that the<br/>&quot;proximate minor third&quot; at around 11:9, or 9/5-tone (about 9/31<br/>octave) was rather concordant, but found a &quot;minimal third&quot; of 7/5-tone<br/>(about 7:6) as more dissonant in its leanings. He also developed some<br/>cadences where certain voices shift from their expected notes of<br/>arrival by 1/5-tone.</p><p>Now, as in 1555, I guess that &quot;playing around&quot; is the main process for<br/>exploring these things on a keyboard.</p><p>Here I might make a few general comments.</p><p>First, from a medieval or Renaissance viewpoint, there&apos;s no distinct<br/>line between &quot;counterpoint&quot; and &quot;harmony&quot; -- if there is in any era of<br/>European or other world music. Multi-voice cadences are often built by<br/>superimposing two-voice progressions so that they mutually reinforce<br/>each other and lead to a rich stable sonority. There is a distinction<br/>between note-against-note and more ornamented or rhythmically<br/>independent textures, and especially in Renaissance styles a special<br/>kind of feel in imitative textures where the voices share an opening<br/>motive (like a canon, but often much freer).</p><p>Secondly, maybe there&apos;s a continuum from designing or choosing the<br/>tuning to fit the style, to taking the tuning and shaping the style to<br/>fit it. A 14th-century European style in a regular Pythagorean tuning,<br/>and such a style in 13-tET, might illustrate the more clearly defined<br/>poles of this continuum &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>One fun thing is the way that a &quot;strange&quot; tuning can have some<br/>familiar progressions, as well as vice versa. For example, adapting<br/>standard 14th-century European cadences to 13-tET, we have (in cents):</p><p>                  minor 3rd to unison    277-0<br/>                  major 3rd to fifth     462-738<br/>                  major 6th to octave    923-1200<br/>                  major 2nd to fourth    185-462<br/>                  minor 7th to fifth    1015-738</p><p>These are all progressions in stepwise contrary motion, and the<br/>resolutions from &quot;minor third to unison&quot; and &quot;major sixth to octave&quot;<br/>are quite &quot;down at home,&quot; routine and beautiful for a neo-medieval<br/>kind of tuning. However, it turns out that in 13-tET, the interval of<br/>about 462 cents -- 5/13 octave -- can serve either as a stable small<br/>fourth or an unstable large major third! I find it most convenient to<br/>describe the interval either way -- in explaining how the tuning<br/>&quot;maps&quot; to neo-medieval expectations -- depending on what it does.</p><p>In view of all the debates since the early 14th century in European<br/>theory on whether the fourth is a &quot;consonance&quot; or &quot;dissonance,&quot; we<br/>might find it a refreshing change of pace to consider whether the same<br/>interval is serving as a major third or a fourth &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Timbre here is very important, as others have discussed, and with<br/>13-tET my usual first item on the agenda is to pick a timbre where<br/>intervals of 738 cents and 462 cents can sound like &quot;stable<br/>consonances&quot; more or less &quot;equivalent&quot; to a usual fifth and fourth.</p><p>However, a lot of this kind of counterpoint is metaphor -- it sounds<br/>&quot;right&quot; or &quot;convincing,&quot; not necessarily &quot;just like&quot; a more usual<br/>tuning. Thus I&apos;d say that in 13-tET, 0-462-923 cents is a fine<br/>cadential sonority expanding to 0-738-1200 cents -- rather like a<br/>sonority of 0-408-906 cents might do in an historical Pythagorean<br/>tuning, or 0-435-933 cents in simple just intonation based on ratios<br/>of 2-3-7-9 (7:9:12) -- again given the right timbre.</p><p>Is this the power of imagination, or historical association, or what?<br/>I&apos;d say that 462 cents is more like a small fourth than a large third<br/>in itself, and yet 0-462-923 cents, with two of these identical<br/>intervals, can &quot;suggest&quot; to me a lower major third and upper fourth.<br/>Or, maybe most judiciously stated, this sonority can very nicely do<br/>the same thing as a more typical medieval or neo-medieval sonority<br/>with the &quot;expected&quot; interval sizes for the &quot;major third&quot; and &quot;fourth&quot;<br/>as well as the &quot;major sixth.&quot; Is it possible that that excellent<br/>923-cent sixth expanding to an octave guides my appreciation of the<br/>rest of the progression?</p><p>Brian, I apologize if some of these details aren&apos;t so clear; some<br/>recent 13-tET improvisations I&apos;ve done and Jacky Ligon has most kindly<br/>converted to .mp3 format and posted here may say more than words to<br/>explain my approach.</p><p>Mainly, my message would be: &quot;Experiment, experiment, experiment.&quot;</p><p>If you&apos;re familiar with a given style, take that as your base -- and<br/>explore from there.</p><p>Without getting too much into historical questions, I would make one<br/>very important point: 12-tET is a relatively recent standard for<br/>keyboard instruments, and many historical forms of European<br/>counterpoint and part-writing are premised on other types of<br/>historical tunings: medieval Pythagorean, Renaissance meantone, and<br/>Baroque-Romantic _unequal_ well-temperaments.</p><p>For example, playing conventional 16th-century counterpoint in a usual<br/>meantone, you are &quot;in the music&apos;s natural element&quot; -- this is a<br/>standard period keyboard tuning. Carry the tuning beyond 12 notes, and<br/>you have not only more transpositions (used in some adventurous pieces<br/>of the era), but new types of intervals -- the exciting things that<br/>Vicentino explored in practice and theory.</p><p>My own journey has branched out from medieval Pythaagorean and<br/>Renaissance meantone. Like Vicentino in the mid-16th century, or Fabio<br/>Colonna in the early 17th century, I&apos;ve discovered (or rediscovered)<br/>some new progressions to go with the old; also, it can be fun in<br/>larger tuning systems especially to experiment with different sizes or<br/>&quot;flavors&quot; of the same (more or less) &quot;type&quot; of interval or<br/>progression, for example major sixth expanding to octave.</p><p>There are many sides to this: getting a new flavor of a familiar<br/>progression, or hitting on a new kind of progression and then trying<br/>to &quot;explain&quot; it in terms of familiar patterns -- a fun exercise, as<br/>long as the explanation doesn&apos;t get in the way of the doing and<br/>enjoying.</p><p>One thing I relish is the moment in exploring a new tuning of: &quot;I&apos;m<br/>don&apos;t quite know yet what to call this, but I hear it and I like it!&quot;</p><p>While I&apos;ve discussed medieval and Renaissance European counterpoint,<br/>what I say might apply to the many forms of counterpoint in African<br/>musics, for example, or in Javanese or Balinese gamelan. There are<br/>&quot;traditional&quot; tunings, with some regional affinities as well as<br/>variations for gamelan pelog and slendro scales, for example, as well<br/>as a range of possible &quot;different&quot; realizations in equal or unequal<br/>tuning systems.</p><p>Please experiment -- and enjoy!</p><p>Peace, love, and happy holidays to all,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=1607 href="#1607">ðŸ”—</a>M.

Instead, I<br/>spent that hour reading medieval and Renaissance music history, a<br/>process that got me very excited about the Notre Dame School around<br/>1200, and also some subtleties of the 14th century.</p><p>For the next 30 years, making music would mean mostly playing any<br/>available organ, harpsichord, synthesizer -- or, in a pinch, a piano<br/>-- mostly tuned, I would guess, in the default 12-tET. Improvising in<br/>13th-16th century styles was my everyday language, meaning much<br/>counterpoint but little &quot;microtonality.&quot;</p><p>In the late 1970&apos;s I read about Nicola Vicentino, and was fascinated<br/>by the new intervals he described; also, having read some discussions<br/>of Pythagorean tuning, I persuaded a friend to tune a harp in pure<br/>fifths, and found it quite delightful -- but wasn&apos;t sure how to go<br/>about finding or placing a keyboard in this temperament.</p><p>Then, in 1998, I started playing a TX-802 in the historically<br/>appropriate medieval Pythagorean and Renaissance meantone tunings --<br/>and found myself also trying out things like 24-note Pythagorean and<br/>17-tET. People like John Chalmers played a central role in getting me<br/>involved in the scene, and giving me much invaluable advice.</p><p>Coming as I was from a medieval and Renaissance background, where<br/>music generally assumes unequal semitones and does _not_ assume the<br/>specific features of 12-tET, the main difference in approaching<br/>familiar counterpoint or polyphony in these tunings is that the<br/>intervals were more &quot;colorful&quot; or idiomatic. It was mostly a matter of<br/>playing the same notes, and getting a more interesting result.</p><p>However, with 17-tET or 24-note Pythagorean, I was venturing into some<br/>new interval types, as also happened when I had the thrill in August<br/>of 1999 of first playing a 24-note meantone tuning likely close to a<br/>subset of what Vicentino may have used in 1555 for a 31-note cycle on<br/>his _archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s one thing to read about Vicentino, or even to read his treatise<br/>itself (available now in a fine English translation by Maria Rika<br/>Maniates and Claude Palisca), and another actually to try out some of<br/>his fifthtone progressions and cadences at the keyboard. I found<br/>myself exploring these progressions and coming up with some variants<br/>of my own.</p><p>Then, in June of 2000, I started looking at some regular temperaments<br/>of a &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; kind with fifths wider than pure -- often tempered<br/>about the same amount as in 12-tET, but in the opposite (and I might<br/>say more interesting) direction.</p><p>Here I would say that tradition, innovation, insight, and sheer<br/>inspiration mix with a lot of keyboard experience and practice to<br/>shape my outlook on &quot;counterpoint and microtonality&quot; in a given<br/>tuning.</p><p>For example, when I first tried a temperament of around 704.61 cents,<br/>I hadn&apos;t considered the idea of &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; thirds -- but<br/>that&apos;s what I encountered, some thirds maybe a bit more &quot;polarized&quot;<br/>than usual neutral ones around 11:9, say something like 14:17:21. My<br/>traditional patterns of 14th-century counterpoint and three-voice<br/>cadences suggested to me a resolution which I liked very much. From<br/>there I could explore similar intervals in a system I had already<br/>tuned like 29-tET -- really beautiful -- and also look for new systems<br/>in this general region.</p><p>Then came a process of seeing what happens with 24-note tunings in the<br/>&quot;704-cent neighbhorhood&quot; -- I knew some of the attractions of 29-tET<br/>because of a connection with 14th-century theory (however uncertain),<br/>but by October of 2000 was looking into this for some other<br/>temperaments. This was a time of more delightful surprises.</p><p>Maybe others can be the best judges of the outlook of my music -- and<br/>my special thanks to Jacky for making some pieces from a recent<br/>cassette available on the Web, with very sophisticated noise reduction<br/>and other touches of artistry as well as technical finesse.</p><p>However, I do see musicmaking, at least for me, as in interactive<br/>process in which I approach a new tuning from a perspective of certain<br/>familiar patterns -- which can be modified, or added to, in ways that<br/>I need to play in order to find.</p><p>There&apos;s excitement in both the practice and theory: I can find delight<br/>either in finding some new progression at the keyboard, often by<br/>accident, or in coming up with some of kind of &quot;new tuning&quot; and<br/>finding out that it&apos;s identical to something documented centuries ago<br/>in some world music tradition.</p><p>Of course, simply playing a synthesizer seems something quite modest<br/>compared to designing and building instruments -- whether in a<br/>traditional gamelan ensemble, or in the manner of Nicola Vicentino,<br/>Harry Partch, or Ivor Darreg.</p><p>Getting the right balance of practice and theory can be a delicate<br/>process, but I&apos;d emphasize that theory is mostly for me practice<br/>distilled, or sometimes practice anticipated, although I also<br/>celebrate the more general and philosophical side.</p><p>A final remark on counterpoint: often music is rather like an<br/>alternate history novel for me, with lots of familiar patterns but<br/>with &quot;one important detail changed&quot; -- or maybe several &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
