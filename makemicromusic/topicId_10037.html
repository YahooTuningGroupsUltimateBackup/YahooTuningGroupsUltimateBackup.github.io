Then it appears<br/>as a menu item under the &quot;scripts&quot; menu of Kontakt...<br/>you can retune any instrument this way.</p><p>I know what you mean about using the correct sample, and<br/>I&apos;m pretty sure the script is doing this right -- the samples<br/>in a Kontakt instrument are assigned to a range of MIDI notes.<br/>The script first figures out which is the closest MIDI note<br/>to the one desired and then retunes. Of course, if you go really<br/>high (like it&apos;s easy to in something like 7-tet) you&apos;ll<br/>be transposing the highest sample way too far and you&apos;ll hear<br/>artifacts. But if you stay within the normal range of the<br/>instrument, then this isn&apos;t an issue.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2005 7:41:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon (Szanto) you wrote,</p><p>&gt; The last missing link in my setup is a way to use at least some sampled<br/>&gt; material that I can alter the tuning in.

I&apos;ve found Rhino not<br/>really too difficult to work with, if you&apos;re incorporating samples into a<br/>more complex voice. And I like Rhino&apos;s envelopes a lot. With samples in<br/>Rhino, you don&apos;t need to do much fancy envelope editing. I&apos;ve seen some of<br/>Daniel&apos;s voices with circa 5 or 6 different samples spread across the<br/>keyboard. And Rhino gives you precise control over specifying the actual<br/>pitch of a sample, so that you can &quot;get it right&quot; in a microtonal context.</p><p>&gt; right now the most straightforward implementation would be CronoX<br/>&gt; 3, because they&apos;ve expanded the ability to place samples over keyranges,<br/>&gt; and incorporate direct .tun file compatibility.</p><p>Zowie...

But I assure you it is there. If you download the demo, you click on the LinPlug logo on the front of the instrument, and it flips to a back panel, which has a few setting, including the option to load a .tun file. I find CX3 to be a much deeper and flexible instrument than CX2, and haven&apos;t had the time to really do a lot with it, mainly found a number of presets I like, and did some tweaking of others. The nice thing is that it is backwards compatible with CX2 patches.</p><p>&gt;Ah, I am envious.

But she was a dancer in a company that I had done a number of pieces for, and knows my music, so we both have an OK comfort level. And I *do* love working with music/dance, very synergistic.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
