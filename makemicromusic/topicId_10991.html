My Violist friend knows how<br/>&gt; to play F# differently if it&apos;s a P5, M3, or m3. When I&apos;m playing on my<br/>&gt; Theremin or my Acoustic Theremin, I use lots of glissandos and melodic<br/>&gt; intervals that aren&apos;t calibrated to anything. And when I&apos;m<br/>&gt; throat-singing, I use some portion of the overtone series, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; even know which one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think folk intonation is the next big thing, at least in<br/>&gt; outsider/visionary/untrained music.</p></div><h3><a id=10998 href="#10998">ðŸ”—</a>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2005 3:54:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 12/4/05, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would maintain that except on fixed-pitch instruments,  people have<br/>&gt; always,  and will always,  play in a kind of adaptive JI,  as far as the<br/>&gt; actual sound is concerned.
