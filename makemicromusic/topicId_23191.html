Yes, I concur about your choice of tonic modes for a &quot;major key&quot;.  It is the sLssLss mode, if I read that correctly, aka the &quot;Anti-Aeolian&quot; mode.  If you want to hear something really interesting, try the &quot;Anti-Harmonic Minor&quot;: in 16-EDO, it would be 150 375 525 675 900 975 2/1, so I&apos;m guessing that would translate to 30-EDO as 160 360 520 680 880 1000 2/1.  Running up and down that scale really tricks my ears, I can tell you that!!  (And FWIW, I think the 25-EDO version of Mavila is nicer, it damages the 5th and 7th harmonics less than does 30-EDO, and the 23-EDO version has nicer 6/5&apos;s--what do you like about the 30-EDO version?  The almost-tolerable fifth?)</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I was playing around in mavila[7] (Scala file posted below).<br/>&gt; I found the most stable mode was<br/>&gt;   160.0 360.0 520.0 680.0 880.0 1040.0 2/1<br/>&gt; (starting on &quot;A&quot; in the scale below, if 2/1 = C on your keyboard,<br/>&gt; which it should by default in Scala)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anyone else have any comments on the modes of mavila[7]?</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 6:35:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for weighing in, Igs.
