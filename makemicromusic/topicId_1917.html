All I know is that he<br/>popped up a few pieces on his site to go along with the interviews Ken<br/>Rubenstein and I did. Ken&apos;s there for exactly the same reason, he has<br/>an interview that was done by Mark... all the other stuff pertains to<br/>Mark&apos;s music.</p><p>Neither Ken nor I have a web site of our own, so Mark put the examples<br/>up at his ampcast site. But none of the stuff Ken or I did is for<br/>sale, so what you read must&apos;ve had to do with Mark&apos;s other<br/>stuff--sorry for the confusion!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Rick McGowan&quot; &lt;rick@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:makemicromusic@yahoogroups.com">makemicromusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, January 24, 2002 10:58 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: guitar music</p><p>&gt; Hiya Dan...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://shredlikehell.homestead.com/stearns.html">http://shredlikehell.homestead.com/stearns.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That pointed to a place where I saw the title &quot;Silvered Alar Rise!&quot;,<br/>but<br/>&gt; when I clicked on it, my browser went to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       <a href="http://www.ampcast.com/music/7587/artist.php">http://www.ampcast.com/music/7587/artist.php</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and I finally found the piece, way down the list amongst other<br/>stuff...<br/>&gt; But now I&apos;m totally confused. There are too many acronyms and sort<br/>of<br/>&gt; ambiguous rambling proses...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is the relationship between: &quot;Dan Stearns&quot; and &quot;Gtr Oblq - SLH&quot;<br/>&gt; (which means what by the way?) and &quot;Infinite Ego&quot; and &quot;Savior<br/>Onasis&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;Ken Rubenstein&quot;??? There appear to be pointers between pages having<br/>to do<br/>&gt; with them all, but... Gee, I must be dense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So... Where can I send my check for how much to get a copy of some<br/>stuff<br/>&gt; like &quot;Silvered Alar Rise!&quot; and &quot;Softball Lesbian&quot;? The <a href="http://ampcast.com">ampcast.com</a><br/>page has<br/>&gt; something for $7.99; but the blurb at the top says to go to the<br/>mOther<br/>&gt; shop! Which is my best bet?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
