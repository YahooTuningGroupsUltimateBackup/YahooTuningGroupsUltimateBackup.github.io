He&apos;s a monster player, lots of CD&apos;s out...a long time student of Munir Bashir...www.rahimalhaj.com  Best to all from the land of the Broncos...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get back to school stuff for them and cashback for you.<br/><a href="http://www.bing.com/cashback?form=MSHYCB&publ=WLHMTAG&crea=TEXT_MSHYCB_BackToSchool_Cashback_BTSCashback_1x1">http://www.bing.com/cashback?form=MSHYCB&publ=WLHMTAG&crea=TEXT_MSHYCB_BackToSchool_Cashback_BTSCashback_1x1</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
