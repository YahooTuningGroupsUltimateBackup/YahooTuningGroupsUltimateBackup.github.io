So now we at last<br/>find out about your dirty little secret -- you are a<br/>very talented composer. You thought you&apos;d hide it from<br/>all of us but finally I guess you just couldn&apos;t keep it<br/>a secret anymore.</p><p>&gt; Yep, it&apos;s true. What could be worse than some ###<br/>&gt; starting a list about making microtonal music and then the<br/>&gt; yozo doesn&apos;t even make any? How come people didn&apos;t stir up a<br/>&gt; fuss.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe your talk about throwing it together<br/>&apos;mixed very badly&apos; etc. Terrifies me to think what your<br/>good mixing would sound like -- the mixing and<br/>mastering are great; sounds like you hired a top<br/>producer.</p><p>&gt; Well, be that as it may, I just posted an extremely short<br/>&gt; piece of ... I hesitate to call it &apos;music&apos; as it would<br/>&gt; demean the art.</p><p>Gag me! What&apos;s with this modesty routine? :) You kick<br/>ass, dude!</p><p>&gt; This doesn&apos;t amount to much more than noodling, but I wanted<br/>&gt; to just offer up some calculated noises</p><p>Surely you jest! Do you really think this?</p><p>&gt; But it would be nice for Mom to hear some more music,<br/>&gt; no?</p><p>Now that you&apos;ve raised the bar its back to<br/>the drawing board for the rest of us.</p><p>Are you putting together a CD now? This is great stuff.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
