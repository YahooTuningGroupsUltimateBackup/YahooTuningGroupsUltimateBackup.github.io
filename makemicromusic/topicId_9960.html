Yes, I wasn&apos;t so didactic about the timing.<br/>One of the reasons was the fact that the patch with the voices<br/>actually had its own internal sweep and timing, and wouldn&apos;t sync<br/>with the rest anyway.  So, it all had to be somewhat loose.</p><p>The live percussion will, of course, be written out, but I&apos;ll still<br/>keep the electronic part pretty loose, specified in seconds, or<br/>quarter note equal to 60 for the most part...</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=9970 href="#9970">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2005 3:17:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for listening, Kraig!</p><p>JP</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; i kinda liked the slowing down effect as it reminded me of  such<br/>things<br/>&gt; in indonesian music.
