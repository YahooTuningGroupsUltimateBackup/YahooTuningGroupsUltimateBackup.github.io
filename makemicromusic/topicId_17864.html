Yes, I should have mentioned that the new<br/>works _Blackjack_ and _Blacklight_ are available through Subito, but<br/>they are not all up on the webpage as yet.  One will have to email or<br/>phone them.  Additionally, one should mention that these are *new<br/>scores* so they will know who to ask, rather than just looking in a<br/>catalog.</p><p>The only specifically microtonal work from the list you have given<br/>above is the _Harmonic Etude_ for solo horn.  This piece is written<br/>in just intonation for solo horn and was premiered by the fine<br/>hornist Francis Orval in Merkin Hall in New York, so it has had a<br/>nice history.  Additionally, it is in the *circulating* score section<br/>of the New York Public Library, which is also nice to know...</p><p>You can hear many of my pieces on my SoundClick page... in fact over<br/>10 hours of music (certainly you have that much time to devote to<br/>this... :)</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/josephpehrson">http://www.soundclick.com/josephpehrson</a></p><p>Thanks again for the interest!!</p><p>JP</p></div>
