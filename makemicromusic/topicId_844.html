What are samples, pure synthesis, and outboard hardware??</p><p>Sampling is a technique where you record a number of short sound examples<br/>(&quot;samples&quot;) and play them back at different pitches to give the illusion<br/>of playing a real instrument.  Most standard synthesizers these days work<br/>with samples.  You can also get software that allows you to use your own<br/>samples.  It&apos;s fairly easy to get a mediocre sounding result this way.</p><p>Pure synthesis is a term I made up for any other way of synthesizing<br/>timbres.  These include analog-style, additive and FM.  With a bit of<br/>experimentation, you can get some interesting sounds out, but they tend<br/>sound obviously electronic.</p><p>Some external synthesizers are capable of being tuned to microtonal<br/>scales.  John Loffink maintains a list at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/index.html">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/index.html</a>&gt;, which includes software as<br/>well.  And, as an intermediate step, most soundcards have on-board<br/>synthesizers and some are retunable.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d like to work in real time but how can you use a keyboard when it<br/>&gt; is designed to reproduce music in 12T eq?</p><p>All digital keyboards worth bothering with will work with MIDI.  You can<br/>plug any MIDI keyboard into your computer, and send the output to any MIDI<br/>synthesizer.  So it all depends on how comfortable you feel with the keys<br/>mapping to unexpected pitches.  There are also alternative MIDI keyboards,<br/>see &lt;<a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/">http://catalog.com/starrlab/</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; How Much money to spend?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well....I understand there are free programs out there and I<br/>&gt; understand there are programs that cost in the hundreds of dollars.</p><p>Hundreds is only the start ...</p><p>&gt; Somehow it would be nice if I can learn some of the basics (with a<br/>&gt; low cost or free program) and then build upon it with the more<br/>&gt; expensive software that utilize the same &quot;medium&quot; (not a<br/>&gt; requirement). Otherwise cost is not a concern. I really want to lean<br/>&gt; the art of composing on the computer.</p><p>If you have a MIDI keyboard, or buy a cheap one, you can play microtonal<br/>music right away with my MIDI Relay.  See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/software.htm">http://x31eq.com/software.htm</a>&gt;.

Since you mention a background in guitar, I have a good suspicion that you would favor methods whereby you could either hear results literally in real-time, and play the music live, or something close to it. Working with a sequencer that can tune with pitch-bends is OK, but both Scala and Fractal Tune Smithy sound much more up your alley.</p><p>On the other extreme would be Csound, whereby you would literally have to compose the piece first (and not in anything resembling standard music notation, mind you) and then let the program compile it before you could hear anything. Extremely powerful results, and not always &quot;science-fiction&quot;-sounding electronic stuff, either; if you&apos;d like to hear very convincing pieces composed utilizing only Csound and some samples of instruments, check out Prent Rodgers work (in JI) at:</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers</a></p><p>But in any event, please feel free to ask questions right here -- I am warm in the knowledge that among this list are some of the people making big strides, both technically and musically, in the new era of microtonal music.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (sometimes known as &quot;list-mom&quot;)</p></div><h3><a id=852 href="#852">ðŸ”—</a>earth7@...</h3><span>10/1/2001 1:59:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Alison, Graham, Jonathan and of course Monz</p><p>Thank you so much for your timely responses to my question on JI<br/>software.

I chopped up a Gibson Les Paul back in 1987 and was never able to<br/>put it back together properly.  &quot;Properly&quot;</p><p>has a definition that&apos;s different to most people. I recently sold it<br/>for a fraction of what I paid for it. I</p><p>swore I would never attempt such a project again until I acquired the<br/>tools and knowledge to do the job properly.<br/>Unfortunately, I am a perfectionist.

Downsides which include<br/>stress overload and many unfinished</p><p>projects. Hopefully I will deal with this eventually and find a happy<br/>medium. Anyway, over the past few years I</p><p>have been studying guitar construction and plan on building my own<br/>acoustic as well as electric JI guitars. I am</p><p>currently building a solid workbench and have (almost) all the tools<br/>needed to construct guitars. I am a member</p><p>of A.S.I.A. which publishes a magazine called &quot;Guitar Maker&quot;. I<br/>highly recommend it to all builders. Please see</p><p><a href="http://www.guitarmaker.org/">http://www.guitarmaker.org/</a>  For now, if I really need a JI guitar, I<br/>would consider Freenote/G&amp;L Guitars. Please</p><p>see <a href="http://microtones.com/gtr01.htm">http://microtones.com/gtr01.htm</a></p><p>David Canright has loads of information with respect to how to fret a<br/>guitar for JI. Please see</p><p><a href="http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/">http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/</a></p><p>I have a band and at some point would like to perform JI<br/>compositions &quot;Live&quot;. I study JI whenever I can but still</p><p>considered a novice in this most interesting field. I am currently<br/>studying The Just Intonation&apos;s David Doty&apos;s</p><p>book called &apos;The JI PRimer&quot; and forging ahead as best I can.</p><p>Getting back to my original question, I&apos;d like to learn how to<br/>compose and write music on the computer using all</p><p>aspects of JI and of course 12-tET or 12-EDO (thanks for the<br/>clarification Monz).</p><p>Everyone has given me some great ideas.</p><p>Monz - I like your idea about cakewalk and have been tossing the idea<br/>around about purchasing the program. I believe their top of the line<br/>product is called &quot;Sonar&quot;. Cubase VST32 is the competition to<br/>Cakewalk and is probably known worlwide for its add on features.</p><p>Id like to help you with your program called &quot;Just Music&quot;. It sounds<br/>great! What programming language do you recommend I learn to help you<br/>with this?</p><p>Graham - Thanks for all the ideas. I went to your Home page and found<br/>it incredibly helpful. Aside from the fact of being hard to start<br/>with, is C-Sound the most powerful of all software out there? I&apos;d<br/>like to be able to have access to the source code this way I&apos;m not<br/>limited in the event I&apos;d like to write an add on. You said,&quot;All<br/>digital keyboards worth bothering with will work with MIDI.  You can<br/>plug any MIDI keyboard into your computer, and send the output to any<br/>MIDI synthesizer.  So it all depends on how comfortable you feel with<br/>the keys<br/>mapping to unexpected pitches.&quot;  Graham, you mean that I can<br/>map/assign any pitch to a specific key on the keyboard? And the<br/>distance between each key can be any frequency I desire???</p><p>Jon - I listened to Prent Rodgers work and found it very, very<br/>interesting. I&apos;d like to learn C-Sound but since you say it does not<br/>resemble anything like standard music notation, then I just assume<br/>that if I want to write music on the computer I essentially have Two<br/>choices. 1) Write and Compose in a programming language medium like<br/>C-Sound and send the file into a score program like Finale so the<br/>piece converts to standard music notation or 2) Compose and write<br/>music using software that essentially does the conversion from<br/>programming language to standard music notation. OR I can write using<br/>a keyboard (controller I believe its called?) or NOT use a keyboard<br/>(C-Sound) and utilize a programming <a href="http://language.Is">language.Is</a> this true? This gets<br/>more confusing as I go along but I&apos;m learning alot.</p><p>Alison - You said, &quot;The best software for cooking up tunings and<br/>sending them to your synth is definitely (and without a doubt) Jeff<br/>Scott&apos;s L&apos;il Miss Scale Oven (LMSO). It won&apos;t help you write or<br/>compose and in fact I don&apos;t think any software can help with that.&quot;<br/>Alison, I thought Cubase VST32 was a sequencer/multiTrack/editor and<br/>composer in one package!? I sorry. I think I didn&apos;t make myself<br/>clear. I&apos;m not looking for a program that &quot;tells&quot; me how to write<br/>music but rather a program that allows me to insert notes (melodies<br/>and chords) in music notation form with editing capabilities and play<br/>back capabilities so I can hear how the song is progressing. I own a<br/>version of PG Music&apos;s &quot;Power Tracks Pro Audio&quot; that&apos;s a real<br/>inexpensive software that allows me to do this but so far I&apos;m having<br/>a tough time getting thru their manual. Alot of these programs assume<br/>you know the lingo and such of computerized music.</p><p>Alison, please tell me why I would want to &quot;cook up tunings&quot;??? Maybe<br/>I need to start with exploring tunings before I write in JI??? Thanks<br/>for your input.

This gets<br/>&gt;more confusing as I go along but I&apos;m learning alot.</p><p>Yes, it is weird until you know more about the territory. Look, Csound is the least like traditional music writing/composition of all of your previously stated possible paths. What you essentially do (correct me if I&apos;m wrong, friends) is prepare two different text files, one that defines the sound resources (the &quot;orchestra&quot;, or .orc file) and the instructions for making the sounds (the &quot;score&quot;, or .sco file).</p><p>However, neither will look like any description of music you have ever seen before! The only thing that could possibly help you, in terms of a real-time feel for it, would be to use a midi-to-Csound program to take a sequencer file that you would record and convert it to a text file for Csound to process into a wave file to listen to.</p><p>Yep, it is that convoluted. For many people, it is the perfect way to work, but not for all.</p><p>I would sincerely have you consider, for now, a modest keyboard/synth setup and working with Scala, FTS, and/or Calkwalk, and start getting this stuff in your ears instead of just your eyes and your head! The Cakewalk route (now Sonar) may be a very valid way to go, but maybe moreso after you&apos;ve done some listening to what this sounds like. With Scala or FTS, you can sit down with a keyboard and hear these harmonies and start to find what you like (and don&apos;t like!) in the world of JI music. Or other tunings, which you may very well be inspired to explore (Scala contains a very large collection of tunings, and Scala and FTS work well together, after you figure out some stuff -- and both the authors/programmers of the programs are here to answer your questions!)</p><p>Hey, if it were slam-dunk easy it might not have the mystery about it. Someday read about the history of Harry Partch, who read something about ancient Greek tunings, and ended up spending his life building instruments and composing music just to get these intonations back into the world. We&apos;ve got it *easy* these days, we do...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=856 href="#856">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 6:24:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 Graham</p><p>There is one other level that I hav explored only a little, and that<br/>is mods.

A lot has happened since then!</p><p>Basically, show the midi relaying view from<br/>the view menu. Then choose which scale and mode<br/>you want to relay the notes to from Midi in.</p><p>If using it for midi relaying, one can tick to<br/>Open the Midi in at the start of the session.</p><p>If you want the usual octave on the keyboard to correspond<br/>to an octave when midi relayed, then you need to choose<br/>a scale with seven notes to an octave for the mode to be<br/>played on the white notes, obviously. However, if you<br/>are happy to spread it out, you can use any map of music<br/>keyboard keys to the scale; e.g. in 96-tet an entire 88<br/>note keyboard will be less than an octave, etc.</p><p>The download page has some help on this, which is more<br/>up to date than the help that comes with the program,<br/>which needs to be updated.</p><p>I _hope_ it is reasonably bug free now -<br/>had no bug reports for midi relaying for<br/>quite a few weeks. Reports are that<br/>it is very stable.</p><p>One feature which I gather is entirely new to FTS - you can now relay<br/>in monophonic legato mode in any of the scales / modes,<br/>if your synth / soundcard supports monophonic legato mode, by ticking<br/>Out | Options | Monophonic legato tracks.</p><p>It works by sending an appropriate pitch bend just before the<br/>next legato note gets played when you release the second key<br/>of the two keys held down simultaneously when playing<br/>a legato trill.</p><p>Definitely still needs testing; works okay here.<br/>(thanks to Jacky for suggesting this idea :-)).</p><p>For examples of fts in use for composition and<br/>improvisation, see my tunes page<br/><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>For composing, I use a normal 12-tet score, but retune it so that<br/>the c d e f g etc play successive notes of the mode of the<br/>scale you want to use, instead of playing successive<br/>12-tet diatonic notes. Using Midi Yoke, I can<br/>retune the output of the play button for the sequencer<br/>/ score writing program I use, so whenever you press the play<br/>button of the sequencer to hear a bar you have been editing,<br/>you hear it tuned as you wish it, instead of in 12-tet.</p><p>So that&apos;s a good second best for a microtonal sequencer<br/>- the playback is exactly as you would want it, but the notation is of<br/>course still 12-tet, with that notation re-interpreted microtonally.<br/>I add a text or lyric line to the score to say how it is to be<br/>interpreted, with the ratios / cents value of the scale, so that<br/>one can cut / paste it into FTS for relaying whenever one plays<br/>that particular piece.</p><p>Of course, one could use the same technique with any<br/>retuning midi relaying software and any midi sequencer.</p><p>It will be some time before<br/>i make a release of it as the program has many<br/>other elements in it - it isn&apos;t just for midi relaying,<br/>in fact was originally an algo-comp type program<br/>and that is still a strong element.

I went to your Home page and<br/>found<br/>&gt; it incredibly helpful. Aside from the fact of being hard to start<br/>&gt; with, is C-Sound the most powerful of all software out there? I&apos;d<br/>&gt; like to be able to have access to the source code this way I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; limited in the event I&apos;d like to write an add on.</p><p>I use Kyma, which does the same kind of thing as CSound but in real<br/>time and with graphical editing.  It does cost a lot of money, and<br/>you don&apos;t get the source code.  See<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.symbolicsound.com/brochure/index.html">http://www.symbolicsound.com/brochure/index.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>I haven&apos;t seen a point by point comparison between CSound and Kyma.<br/>But I expect CSound can do most things, and the problem with either<br/>is that they don&apos;t have shrink-wrapped modules to emulate cathedrals<br/>or Marshall stacks.</p><p>One advantage of CSound is that there&apos;s a good book about it.  It&apos;s<br/>called, imaginatively, &quot;The CSound Book&quot;.  You may find working<br/>through that a good way of learning about computer music.</p><p>&gt; Graham, you mean that I can<br/>&gt; map/assign any pitch to a specific key on the keyboard? And the<br/>&gt; distance between each key can be any frequency I desire???</p><p>This is called a full keyboard tuning table.  Some devices support<br/>them, some don&apos;t, so check John Loffink&apos;s list.</p><p>&gt; Jon - I listened to Prent Rodgers work and found it very, very<br/>&gt; interesting. I&apos;d like to learn C-Sound but since you say it does<br/>not<br/>&gt; resemble anything like standard music notation,</p><p>I think you can exaggerate the importance of this.  CSound is as<br/>close to standard notation as you can reasonably expect given that it<br/>expects text files, and is highly flexible.  You feed it a list of<br/>notes, giving the time of onset, pitch, duration, and any other<br/>parameters you want to define.  It should be a routine job to convert<br/>a score into such parameters, if that&apos;s the way you like working.</p><p>&gt; then I just assume<br/>&gt; that if I want to write music on the computer I essentially have<br/>Two<br/>&gt; choices. 1) Write and Compose in a programming language medium<br/>like<br/>&gt; C-Sound and send the file into a score program like Finale so the<br/>&gt; piece converts to standard music notation or</p><p>Can Finale read CSound files?  The usual way would be to use the MIDI<br/>to CSound convertor because everything works with MIDI (it is indeed<br/>the standard).</p><p>&gt; 2) Compose and write<br/>&gt; music using software that essentially does the conversion from<br/>&gt; programming language to standard music notation.</p><p>This would be using a sequencer?  Working with standard notation can<br/>be a mixed blessing anyway.  The rhythms that work best tend not to<br/>be the simplest ones in notation.  Until you have a computer playing<br/>exactly what you tell it, this isn&apos;t really important.  But if you<br/>want to view a MIDI file that swings it usually means approximating<br/>the rhythm to make it comprehensible.  Some sequencers<br/>have &quot;humanizers&quot; which take simple notation and make it swing.<br/>Apparently, they&apos;re coming on well.</p><p>&gt; OR I can write using<br/>&gt; a keyboard (controller I believe its called?) or NOT use a keyboard<br/>&gt; (C-Sound) and utilize a programming <a href="http://language.Is">language.Is</a> this true? This<br/>gets<br/>&gt; more confusing as I go along but I&apos;m learning alot.</p><p>Yes.  You can record to MIDI and convert the MIDI to CSound.  But<br/>that means you&apos;re not getting correct feedback when you record, so I<br/>don&apos;t know how you&apos;ll control the performance.  I think I&apos;ve deleted<br/>my Elements Suite, so you don&apos;t have to listen to it, but that&apos;s the<br/>kind of thing I couldn&apos;t have done without a real-time system.</p><p>There are packages that get CSound working in real-time, but I don&apos;t<br/>have experience with them, so somebody else is going to have to chime<br/>in.</p><p>Some MIDI controllers aren&apos;t keyboards.  For example, you can get<br/>MIDI wind instruments.</p><p>&gt; Alison, please tell me why I would want to &quot;cook up tunings&quot;???<br/>Maybe<br/>&gt; I need to start with exploring tunings before I write in JI???<br/>Thanks<br/>&gt; for your input. It was very helpful.</p><p>You can certainly spend a lot of time exploring tunings, JI or not,<br/>and this is where it&apos;s good to have a real-time keyboard setup.  But<br/>the danger is that you&apos;re always trying out the next tuning and don&apos;t<br/>get round to writing any music.  So you could discipline yourself to<br/>get something written with the first tuning you like if you want<br/>instant results.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=866 href="#866">ðŸ”—</a>earth7@...</h3><span>10/2/2001 1:31:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon</p><p>Okay I&apos;m convinced.

This<br/>gets<br/>&gt; &gt;more confusing as I go along but I&apos;m learning alot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it is weird until you know more about the territory. Look,<br/>Csound is<br/>&gt; the least like traditional music writing/composition of all of your<br/>&gt; previously stated possible paths. What you essentially do (correct<br/>me if<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wrong, friends) is prepare two different text files, one that<br/>defines<br/>&gt; the sound resources (the &quot;orchestra&quot;, or .orc file) and the<br/>instructions<br/>&gt; for making the sounds (the &quot;score&quot;, or .sco file).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, neither will look like any description of music you have<br/>ever seen<br/>&gt; before! The only thing that could possibly help you, in terms of a<br/>&gt; real-time feel for it, would be to use a midi-to-Csound program to<br/>take a<br/>&gt; sequencer file that you would record and convert it to a text file<br/>for<br/>&gt; Csound to process into a wave file to listen to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep, it is that convoluted. For many people, it is the perfect way<br/>to work,<br/>&gt; but not for all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would sincerely have you consider, for now, a modest<br/>keyboard/synth setup<br/>&gt; and working with Scala, FTS, and/or Calkwalk, and start getting<br/>this stuff<br/>&gt; in your ears instead of just your eyes and your head! The Cakewalk<br/>route<br/>&gt; (now Sonar) may be a very valid way to go, but maybe moreso after<br/>you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; done some listening to what this sounds like. With Scala or FTS,<br/>you can<br/>&gt; sit down with a keyboard and hear these harmonies and start to find<br/>what<br/>&gt; you like (and don&apos;t like!) in the world of JI music. Or other<br/>tunings,<br/>&gt; which you may very well be inspired to explore (Scala contains a<br/>very large<br/>&gt; collection of tunings, and Scala and FTS work well together, after<br/>you<br/>&gt; figure out some stuff -- and both the authors/programmers of the<br/>programs<br/>&gt; are here to answer your questions!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, if it were slam-dunk easy it might not have the mystery about<br/>it.<br/>&gt; Someday read about the history of Harry Partch, who read something<br/>about<br/>&gt; ancient Greek tunings, and ended up spending his life building<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; and composing music just to get these intonations back into the<br/>world.<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve got it *easy* these days, we do...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3><a id=867 href="#867">ðŸ”—</a>earth7@...</h3><span>10/2/2001 1:57:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Graham</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time to help me. please see my post #866.<br/>If it all came down to a simple start, what software would you say I<br/>start with to explore what JI is about.

CAL is a &apos;scripting&apos; language that runs within Cakewalk, allowing you to automate or add new functions to the program. I don&apos;t know how well current versions still support this, but I imagine they do.

For most of what I do, reassigning multiple channels to get microtonal is not a very good option, because I like a lot of &apos;orchestration&apos; along with my tuning, and the only alternative is to do multiple passes of sequences that get burned to audio tracks, which then get mixed later in a larger digital mixdown. It would all be so much easier if the instruments themselves could be more microtonally flexible, but that isn&apos;t the case today (and I doubt it will be at any point...).</p><p>&gt;Not according to the reviews I checked on the web:</p><p>Thanks for those links, I&apos;ll take a browse at them; much of this also depends on source material. Not having *gone* to the links yet, I can&apos;t tell, but a lot of the writing on mp3 stuff comes from the public/popular arena, and I don&apos;t think the differences between encoders is as big a deal on a blink-182 tune as it might be on music with more... subtleties. And I *don&apos;t* mean to be elite at all, as I use them for a lot of my rock-and-roll, too, but some musics, in their delicacy and transparency, can show up flaws in the lossy compression routines.</p><p>Not to mention that different encoders take longer than others, though ultimately that is not the important point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Does great music deserve less?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What&apos;s better, and at what price?</p><p>What is better is what *my* ears judge, and the price is the lowest you will afford to go for the quality reproduction of your music. If it means a great deal to you, then the sacrifice (of tool cost) is worth it. If you just tinker, you can get by with a lot of stuff.</p><p>So that you know that I&apos;m not against these tools, early on this list I posted 3 free programs to digitize and encode files, for those who were saying &quot;How can I get into this?&quot;. Lame was one, and I still use it for quite a few things, mainly because I like the Razor front-end I use with it...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1169 href="#1169">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@...</h3><span>10/27/2001 5:02:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
