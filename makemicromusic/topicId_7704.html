Most composers, myself included, somewhat shamefully,<br/>&gt; do not take enough time to make their realizations beautiful.</p><p>A long time ago, when you didn&apos;t happen to be here, there was a long (and maybe long-winded) discussion on just what a &quot;composer&quot; is (maybe it was on the tuning list). It certainly seems you fit the traditional role of composer, especially in light of your production of scores along with recordings/realizations of the pieces.</p><p>But many of the people that are making their own music these days - whether one wants to give them the label of &quot;composer&quot; or not - are taking quite a bit of care in the presentation of their pieces in recorded form. We haven&apos;t ever had access to the kind of electronic musical tools we do now, and while it adds to the list of stuff to do (as you say, &quot;take enough time&quot;), there may very well be benefits to a few less pieces when the pieces done are done as carefully as possible.</p><p>It certainly doesn&apos;t really make sense to labor in an anguished form over the electronic realization of a piece that should have it&apos;s ultimate final product a live performance. But if you are working in 19tet on keyboard pieces (only as an example), you probably aren&apos;t ever going to find a 19tet piano laying around, and the more time put into finding the best realization - possibly leading to a live performance solution - might be time well spent.</p><p>Ultimately, it *does* boil down to a composer&apos;s priorities. I think some, like you, really do feel a need to push forward with writing, maybe at the expense of better realization; there are certainly others who just aren&apos;t *aware* of the lame impression that a weak, ill-conceived, or &apos;good-enough&apos; rendition can give.</p><p>&gt;My problem is that my musical persona is very web-derived making synthetic &gt;realizations of new pieces or un-recorded pieces problematic.</p><p>For someone who is web-derived, and acknowledging that a great deal of the progress made in electronic music has happened through web-derivation/dissemination, this seems like an odd stance. It seems you should be *flourishing*. Maybe it is just that classical people, in general, refuse to look at some of the models of music production/distribution that come from people in popular music fields.</p><p>Not to mention that your programming and communication skills, as evidenced in your various web sites, would be a natural springboard for furthering your music in every way possible.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7713 href="#7713">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2004 1:59:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; And I still don&apos;t agree with you about the problem.

In general, the loss of a voice<br/>implies a loss of momentum, or requires, to maintain momentum, a<br/>compensatory factor, such as a tightening of rhythm, or increase in<br/>volume, or textural complexity.  The examples I&apos;m thinking of where<br/>voice loss creates a musically inappropriate gesture are usually<br/>simplistic contrapuntal passages or areas where the accompaniment<br/>disappears without this effect being played up or compensated for.</p><p>&gt; This isn&apos;t the only way to do it with electronics, and certainly isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; the way it was intended to be done.  But the traditional rules still<br/>&gt; work remarkably well in this alien environment.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Traditions need to grow to encompass the spectral textural<br/>possibilities inherent in these tunings and to promote these effects<br/>towards dramatic ends.</p><p>jeff harrington<br/><a href="http://jeffharrington.org">http://jeffharrington.org</a> - new music<br/><a href="http://netnewmusic.net">http://netnewmusic.net</a> - new music portal<br/><a href="http://beepsnort.org">http://beepsnort.org</a> - new music blog<br/><a href="http://webjay.org/by/idealord/mikrotonal-experimentaltuningmusic">http://webjay.org/by/idealord/mikrotonal-experimentaltuningmusic</a> -<br/>microtonal webjay playlist</p></div><h3><a id=7720 href="#7720">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2004 9:13:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The examples I&apos;m thinking of where voice loss creates a musically<br/>&gt;inappropriate gesture are usually simplistic contrapuntal passages<br/>&gt;or areas where the accompaniment disappears without this effect<br/>&gt;being played up or compensated for.</p><p>Can you think of any particular instances of this?

I heard this first in viol playing (especially the Purcell _Fantazias_) and later imitated this to a degree, via sul ponticello playing, in several pieces of my own.  (I recently played several of _Fantazias_ with a meantone renaissance recorder trio -- G alto, tenor, bass -- and they had charm, but lack the depth of viol playing, perhaps because of the unambiguous registration.)</p><p>It is precisely such accidents of surface combined with the failure of samples to interact with one another in the way that simultaneous acoustical sounds interact that my ears miss most in electronic &quot;realisations&quot; (as if the electronics are any less &quot;real&quot;).

For the Shakuhachi I used the Shakuhachi<br/>voice on my sound card and for the singing bowls<br/>I used the recorder voices playing all the singing bowl<br/>partials for each one.</p><p>Anyway I&apos;m sure you could do a much more sophisticted<br/>one with actual Shakuhachi recordings and singing<br/>bowls. Or indeed the actual instruments themselves<br/>though the singing bowls would have to be very precisely<br/>tuned and the Shakuhachi&apos;s played with great precision of<br/>pitch.</p><p>The idea is simple anyway. You find the partials<br/>of the Shakuhachi, and get a singing bowl to play<br/>at each of those pitches. You also find the partials<br/>of a singing bowl and get your Shakuhachis to play<br/>those pitches too. The Shakuhachi had only three<br/>partials to play because that&apos;s all the analysis found<br/>in the singing bowls - slightly inharmonic partials<br/>with a distinctive beat.</p><p>Then, the four singing bowls playing the Shakuhachi<br/>partials at their correct volumes will have<br/>exactly the same set of partials in that big<br/>composite timbre as the Shakuhachis playing the<br/>singing bowl partials.</p><p>So now - well you could just play them all at once<br/>or introduce them one at a time, until all the<br/>partials are present for the singing bowls.<br/>Then let them die away and as they fade, gradually,<br/>gently bring in Shakuhachi instruments playing the exact<br/>same partials - there one coudl imagine that good<br/>performers with a keen ear for the pitch of the<br/>partials of the singing bowls could blend in seamlessly.</p><p>Then the Shakuhachi&apos;s can either fade away in unison<br/>or one at a time until only one is left.</p><p>That&apos;s enough to be a musically interesting piece<br/>by itself I think. Or could be a point of interest<br/>in a larger piece. Main technical difficulty in<br/>implementing it I suppose would be to be able<br/>to tune the singing bowls to such precision -<br/>and to find three Shakuhachi players able<br/>to play continuous sutained precise pitches<br/>with a keen ear to hear the partials of the<br/>singing bowls. Seems technically to be<br/>within the realm of possibility<br/>that it could be performed some day, who knows,<br/>if there were someone interested and with<br/>the contacts and facilities to do it.<br/>:-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7729 href="#7729">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2004 11:56:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>&gt;The idea is simple anyway.

The Shakuhachi had only three<br/>&gt;partials to play because that&apos;s all the analysis found<br/>&gt;in the singing bowls - slightly inharmonic partials<br/>&gt;with a distinctive beat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then, the four singing bowls playing the Shakuhachi<br/>&gt;partials at their correct volumes will have<br/>&gt;exactly the same set of partials in that big<br/>&gt;composite timbre as the Shakuhachis playing the<br/>&gt;singing bowl partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So now - well you could just play them all at once<br/>&gt;or introduce them one at a time, until all the<br/>&gt;partials are present for the singing bowls.<br/>&gt;Then let them die away and as they fade, gradually,<br/>&gt;gently bring in Shakuhachi instruments playing the exact<br/>&gt;same partials - there one coudl imagine that good<br/>&gt;performers with a keen ear for the pitch of the<br/>&gt;partials of the singing bowls could blend in seamlessly.</p></div><h3><a id=7752 href="#7752">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2004 12:21:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But it&apos;s never a problem in<br/>&gt; real-world performance, and usually not even with computer music,<br/>&gt; outside of something like CSound (wavetables and even physical models<br/>&gt; are seldom accurate enough).</p><p>I guess it&apos;s time to try for some maximally incompetent counterpoint<br/>in CSound.</p></div><h3><a id=7753 href="#7753">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2004 12:37:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess it&apos;s time to try for some maximally incompetent counterpoint<br/>&gt; in CSound.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Personally, I&apos;d stick with disfunctional harmony.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=7754 href="#7754">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2004 12:40:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  You can&apos;t like it,<br/>&gt; anyway, because you joined in the chorus of no critical feedback when I<br/>&gt; announced it.

Particularly liked the Pelog flute<br/>improvisation.</p><p>If you want some constructive criticism, how about a suggestion to point out<br/>the phrasing just a bit more? Occasional micro pauses to point out moments<br/>of surprise and to mark where a phrase starts and ends, and occasional longer<br/>phrases. You do it already but could do it more.</p><p>For instance in the Pelog piece, the player hardly ever pauses for a breath<br/>- the one or two places where it does break off very momentarily are handled<br/>effectively, but you could do with a few more of those perhaps.<br/>Even in a solo piece you can have occasional complete rests or at least<br/>points where notes get cut off a bit short to point out the phrasing<br/>and give more structure for the ear to listen to.</p><p>When accompanying other instruments or voice you can have complete<br/>rests for a bar or two or even have an instrument that only comes<br/>in for a few bars now and again. Again you do that a bit but could<br/>do it more so, more pauses of a bar or two, and more short micropauses<br/>to point out moments of transition or surprise.</p><p>Same with the accompaniment to When I set out to Lyonaisse,<br/>a few micropauses in the accompaniment after moments of surprise<br/>or to point out changes, in a subtle way. You have one complete<br/>pause in the melody line at 1 minute 9 seconds and a pause<br/>befoer the registration shift at 57 seconds which are quite<br/>effective, but a few more could help. I&apos;d maybe do a shorter<br/>note to start the third bar for instance at the mild moment of<br/>surprise at 4 seconds, and maybe another one at 9 seconds<br/>for the transition to longer notes, and so on, I suppose<br/>every few seconds. Sometimes short phrases of a bar or less<br/>and more often longer ones. A player of an instrument<br/>would have many tiny sub-phrases too of just a few notes<br/>- however those are a lot of work to do in midi or whatever<br/>and require subtle changes in the lengths of notes and<br/>dynamics. But larger phrases are pretty easy to do.</p><p>Can also pause completely for a bar or two or even have<br/>an instrument that only comes in for a few bars now and again.</p><p>I find that work on the phrasing helps the composer to think<br/>more about the piece in terms of phrases and answer phrases and so on.<br/>So as well as helping the listener, it also improves the composition<br/>indirectly.</p><p>Even if the instrument line is meant to be lost - still micropauses<br/>and rests in the accompaniment won&apos;t draw much attention to it<br/>- will just make it so that it has a bit more of a pattern to it,<br/>like a carpet or wallpaper if you want that type of an effect,<br/>still those are often patterned rather than uniform in colour and<br/>it doesn&apos;t draw attention to them that much.</p><p>&gt; Sorry, am I sounding bitter?  Well, I wish people would tear these<br/>&gt; things apart if they don&apos;t like them.  Why post things here if you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; want negative feedback?  If I&apos;m going wrong somewhere, I&apos;d like people<br/>&gt; to say so I can ignore them.  Or something.</p><p>I think that one needs to say that one wants negative feedback<br/>first, because some people are very sensitive to anything that<br/>may be considered as crticism. But constructive criticism<br/>I agree is very useful, best done if one already likes<br/>the piece, or at least some aspects of it, or can see<br/>how it could be made into a good piece with a bit of work<br/>on something or other. If one sees nothing in a piece<br/>at all then there is little point in saying anything about<br/>it as it is clearly lost on one. So then one has to leave<br/>it to someone else who is better attuned to the composer&apos;s<br/>aspirations and intentions.</p><p>The sort of criticism that says<br/>- well actually I wouldn&apos;t write a piece like that at all<br/>and I don&apos;t like that style anyway and (by implication)<br/>- why do you bother, or why don&apos;t you write in the same way<br/>that I do isn&apos;t particularly helpful.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7769 href="#7769">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2004 12:05:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve been prodded to reply to this.

You do it already but could do it more.</p><p>Oh, yes.  That&apos;s something I do think about because I have a tendency to have all the instruments playing all the time without taking any kind of break.  But I also like music that doesn&apos;t do this.

On an instrument that doesn&apos;t have to pause for breath.  There are things I don&apos;t like about it, but I don&apos;t want to do the work required to analyze it, re-write bits, re-record them to sound like the surrounding material and then splice them in.

I&apos;ve got as far as changing the rhythm so that a part doesn&apos;t just meander around with the same note length.  I&apos;m a bit wary of having a part drop out, though.  Especially with such thin orchestration. Perhaps I should take the plunge and allow a few gaps to see if anything really suffers.

It&apos;s quite easy to move notes around and change their length in the piano roll view, which is how I always edit it.
