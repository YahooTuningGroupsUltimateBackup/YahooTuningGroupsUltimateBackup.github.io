I did in fact, tweak the original<br/>version of &quot;Te Deum Laudamus&quot; just a tad &amp; the new setting is at<br/><a href="http://NotOnlyMusic.com">NotOnlyMusic.com</a>. This is a better soundfont I think, with gentler<br/>attacks and softer tone. As you asked about septimal intervals, I<br/>rendered this version in an extended Ptolemy tuning:</p><p>12-tone extended septimal Ptolemy, jls<br/>  12<br/>!<br/>  21/20<br/>  9/8<br/>  7/6<br/>  9/7<br/>  4/3<br/>  10/7<br/>  3/2<br/>  63/40<br/>  27/16<br/>  7/4<br/>  27/14<br/>  2/1</p><p><a href="http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=786&p=4415#p4415">http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=786&p=4415#p4415</a><br/>&lt;http://&gt;</p><p>  Hope you enjoy,<br/>jls</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tuning sounds wonderful, there are some beautiful vertical<br/>sonorities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you render this with a different sound and maybe work on flow of<br/>the lines, suspensions and so on?
