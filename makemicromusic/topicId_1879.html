There are many good free SF2s out<br/>&gt; there on the internet. Found some really good sounding guitars and a<br/>&gt; couple of banjos too.</p><p>Do you have the links?</p><p>&gt; I downloaded the Vienna Sound Font Studio to see what would be<br/>&gt; involved in programming sound fonts, and was glad to learn that there<br/>&gt; is great tuning flexibility there. Haven&apos;t tried it yet though,<br/>&gt; mainly because I seek more instant forms of gratification - if you<br/>&gt; know what I mean.</p><p>You can get quartertones or 88CET very easily by setting the scale tuning<br/>parameter.  Unfortunately it&apos;s set to 1 cent granularity, so it can&apos;t do<br/>general equal temperaments or realistic piano tunings.  Other scales need<br/>a lot more work, and with enough instruments together you have to worry<br/>about running out of memory or pointers.</p><p>I few of us did think about writing a program that can automatically tune<br/>up a sound font, but nothing came of it.  If anybody knows of a library<br/>that can read and write them, this could still be an option.</p><p>&gt; I did do a bit of experimentation with using<br/>&gt; Robert&apos;s FTS with the SF2s though, which worked pretty well. I did<br/>&gt; experience some weird artifacts related to the pitch bends seeming to<br/>&gt; happen after the note ons. Need to play with it more to see if I can<br/>&gt; make it work better. I don&apos;t think this has anything to do with FTS,<br/>&gt; but is a result of midi routing through Midi Yoke, and into the DAW.</p><p>This is with a soft synth?  I never noticed this problem with the AWE<br/>series sound cards.</p><p>                            Graham</p></div>
