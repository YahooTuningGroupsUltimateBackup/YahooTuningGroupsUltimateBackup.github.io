Hmm . . . it&apos;s definitely a subtle thing, but<br/>listening to a lot of Renaissance music may certainly magnify the<br/>effect for you (it did for me) . . .</p><p>&gt; And I think that&apos;s because<br/>&gt; our friend Wendy Carlos is right: It&apos;s not the interaction of the<br/>Fundamentals<br/>&gt; that are important to how good it sounds, it&apos;s the interactions of<br/>the<br/>&gt; overtones, which is a function of the orchestration.

I might not<br/>be holding<br/>&gt; my jaw right, but this happiness continues to elude me with this<br/>approach,</p><p>It&apos;s normally justified partly in terms of the overtones and/or<br/>partly in terms of other psychoacoustic effects that favor simple<br/>ratios. When this is done carefully, there&apos;s nothing backwards about<br/>the approach. But you&apos;re missing other big aspects of tuning theory<br/>which relate to scales &amp; chord progressions, etc. . .</p><p>&gt; because it&apos;s backwards:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Determine &quot;best&quot; tuning/temperment system based on available<br/>&gt;interactions of the fundamentals in the piece, then Orchestration<br/>&gt;will automatically be better.</p><p>What you are saying doesn&apos;t appear to be likely to lead to much of an<br/>change relative to the &quot;backwards&quot; approaches you mention above.<br/>Meanwhile, the actual chord progressions and other pitch usage in the<br/>piece should be a *huge* factor in determining the best tuning for<br/>it, since one should allow adaptive tuning in general, and doesn&apos;t<br/>want big pitch drifts or sudden retune motions.</p><p>&gt; Overtone-alignment-based tuning is bloody hard. Human Acapella<br/>Choirs manage a form of this: they tend toward Just intonations, and<br/>as the pieces go through<br/>&gt; more and more elaborate harmonic gyrations, the choirs &quot;go flat&quot;.<br/>Well, they<br/>&gt; don&apos;t really *try* to go flat, they just continue to follow the<br/>just resolutions<br/>&gt; beyond what the statically-tuned instruments they have accompanying<br/>them<br/>&gt; (pianos, etc) can adjust for on-the-fly.</p><p>Actually, good choirs use *adaptive tuning*, adjusting the notes by<br/>fractions of a comma to fit the harmonic context, and thus don&apos;t end<br/>up having to go flat at all. The effect acheived is similar to Just<br/>Intonation in the purity of the sonorities acheived but without any<br/>drift or audible shifts in the notated pitches.</p><p>Since human voices have exactly harmonic timbres, though, I don&apos;t<br/>really know why they serve to illustrate the distinction you<br/>originally brought up here, between ratios-between-fundamentals and<br/>overtone-alignment paradigms.</p></div>
