Works easy, but stays in<br/>&gt; &gt;tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      I have yet to hear aluminum tubing sound as nicely (to my ear)<br/>&gt; as steel.  What is this tubing you mention and where can I obtain it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Just ask for 6061-T6, thats all you need. I&apos;m using tube just slightly over<br/>1 inch.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>GZ</p></div>
