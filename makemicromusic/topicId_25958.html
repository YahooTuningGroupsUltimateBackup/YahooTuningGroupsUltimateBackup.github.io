It looks interesting, I&apos;ll try to find more about his &quot;spectral&quot; music. That work was written in 2000, recorded in 2003 and seems to be successful and popular, there&apos;s a lot of performances.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 22 Feb 2011, at 1:24 AM, Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    A composer named Georg Friedrich Haas got a nice write up for &gt; his micro work, &quot;In Vain;&quot; anybody know about this feller and his &gt; work?

Best...Hstick</p><p>I&apos;ve gotten to know about him through the great writing of Alex Ross, the music critic for the New Yorker. He had an extensive article on Haas back in November, which is online (though it might be only for subscribers) and he also gives some more background in his New Yorker blog:</p><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/alexross/2010/11/footnotes-georg-friedrich-haas.html">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/alexross/2010/11/footnotes-georg-friedrich-haas.html</a></p><p>Note that you can find the article in a link there, as well as links to sound samples. He also had a mini-profile in his own blog a while back:</p><p><a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/2010/09/georg_friedrich_haas.html">http://www.therestisnoise.com/2010/09/georg_friedrich_haas.html</a></p><p>Two things to consider:</p><p>1. He isn&apos;t a microtonal composet the way a lot of people around here think of one, much closer to the spectral school of composers, the main difference being (as I recall) that he doesn&apos;t go in for a lot of computer analysis of sound when composing, choosing to use his ears instead.</p><p>2. You owe it to yourself to read both of Ross&apos; books on music, &quot;The Rest Is Noise&quot; and &quot;Listen To This&quot;. He is the best arts writer we have going, has big ears, and is a great champion of people making music right now, while still having respect for past artists. Killer stuff.</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p></div>
