I really enjoy listening to your performances, and udderbot is a unique instrument which seems to have no traditional equivalent.<br/>I would say I&apos;ve not heard anything like this piece of music before, it&apos;s truly experimental to my ears! Although it&apos;s cerebral and difficult to find the pulse, I think I understand it after a couple of repeated listens. I dread to think what it would feel like to be in Guudo&apos;s position though..</p><p>You don&apos;t get new listening experiences like this every day, so thanks for supplying one. :) And yes, that means I enjoyed it!</p><p>Tricesimoprimally,</p><p>Sean</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;piccolosandcheese&quot; &lt;udderbot@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi MMM,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still love you!
