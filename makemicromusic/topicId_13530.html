I won a composition fellowship from the Colorado Council on the Arts in 1999 for my CD &quot;Acoustic Stick,&quot; which is 19 and 34 tone; picked up first in the 1992 Guitar Player mag Ultimate Guitar Competition (experimental category) for &quot;Spider Chimes,&quot; a 19 tone piece; and won an Arts Innovation Award from the city of Denver in 1996 for &quot;Jimmy and Joe,&quot; a 19 tone country breakdown (brought the Catler bros out to Denver with the $$$).<br/>       Conteste are pretty subjective, it&apos;s all up to the mood of the judges...but, winning is a good thing, it helps get one&apos;s name out there, you can meet some interesting folks, and if there&apos;s $$$, that&apos;s not bad, either. I met Dan Stearns and several other folks from the Guitar Player contests, and these friendships have lasted many years...gogogo...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
