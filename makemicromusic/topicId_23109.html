Meaning if you mention<br/>ideas there without some huge type of scientific backup (huge survey and/or<br/>reference to papers and/or reference to equations), you can easily get called a<br/>troll and/or not taken seriously.</p><p>    People on the Tuning (and not even the tuning-math!) list often tell me<br/>&quot;what you are saying has little substantiated evidence in tuning and, as being<br/>so much more subjective, really has much more to do with just music...put that<br/>kind of discussion on the MMM list, not here!&quot;   Meanwhile when I talk about how<br/>I think a chord sounds subjectively here (same sort of topic), the response is<br/>often &quot;that&apos;s too technical...and has little to do with sharing musical<br/>examples, put it on the Tuning list!&quot;  Can you say double standard? :-D</p><p>   See the apparent problem?   IMVHO, the tuning list is not the middle ground<br/>tuning-math and MMM I believe it should be...only very strict academic theories<br/>seem to be taken seriously while middle-of-the-road theories seem to be ignored<br/>or even set into flame wars IE &quot;we need to knock this guy off the list because<br/>he&apos;s not &apos;smart&apos; enough&quot;.  There are a few people who actually start fights with<br/>people regularly and call them things like psuedoscientists and &quot;people who<br/>think they are perfect&quot; or even say &quot;x person is an idiot&quot; as if it would<br/>somehow help the list.  No wonder there is over-flow onto this list...especially<br/>among those who have somewhat &apos;subjective&apos; views on tuning and aren&apos;t overly<br/>interested having to be hardcore academics to be respected in the form they<br/>discuss their theories.</p><p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>Meanwhile...here is some music I&apos;ve made a couple of months ago<br/>-&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.archive.org/download/Split_Notes_-_Crack_My_Pitch_Up/04_Paragon_-_Coral_Garden.mp3">http://www.archive.org/download/Split_Notes_-_Crack_My_Pitch_Up/04_Paragon_-_Coral_Garden.mp3</a></p><p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>     It is based on the compositional ideas of using chained neutral seconds to<br/>allow jazzy-sounding clustered chords not possible in 12TET and is much inspired<br/>by the Ptolemy Homalon scale (which has similar neutral second compositional<br/>possibilities).

After spending so much time learning about scales, I heard<br/>knowsur&apos;s album and it blew my mind because it used a temperament I<br/>could never get to sound good. So I wanted to hear how other composers<br/>dealt with this issue, since there was clearly some insight that I am<br/>lacking. I am tired of only studying theory and want to start writing<br/>music. Thus it seemed at the time that MMM was the right place to have<br/>this sort of discussion.</p><p>The discussion then spontaneously went back into tuning theory,<br/>because I guess that&apos;s what people wanted to talk about. George Secor<br/>came back and posted on the matter, Kraig and Carl got into a<br/>discussion, etc. It ended up becoming so technical that I posted an<br/>offshoot onto the tuning list which has gotten so much further into<br/>theory than I have previously delved that it&apos;s actually somewhat<br/>exciting.</p><p>So it&apos;s not surprising to me that when talking about how to actually<br/>make music with tunings that theoretically are labeled &quot;inaccurate,&quot;<br/>some kind of related discussion broke out about the tunings themselves<br/>or why they can still &quot;work&quot; or whatever. All I really wanted to hear<br/>were people&apos;s insights into how to use dissonant tunings effectively<br/>to create music, which I got from Igs: stop messing with GM timbres,<br/>set up keyboard mappings, &quot;there is no bad tuning,&quot; etc. Thus I am<br/>happy. However, if you&apos;d like me to make posts like this on the main<br/>tuning list instead, I can do that too.
