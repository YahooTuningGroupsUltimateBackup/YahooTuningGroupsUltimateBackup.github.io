Since that piece and this<br/>version of Lasso&apos;s _Prologue_ from his _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_ have<br/>the same MIDI instruments, why don&apos;t I give links to the MIDI files<br/>for both pieces as well as the ogg and mp3 versions of the Gesualdo<br/>piece, so that people can compare, check the MIDI pitch bend messages,<br/>or experiment with different MIDI instrumentations and timbres:</p><p>         &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid</a>&gt;<br/>         &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mf2t">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mf2t</a>&gt;<br/>         &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mid</a>&gt;<br/>         &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.ogg">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>         &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>The Lasso piece is the prologue in his four-voice vocal cycle<br/>_Prophetiae Sibyllarum_, &quot;The Prophecies of the Sibyls,&quot; written in a<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; style announced in the opening words of this prologue, and<br/>often dated to the early 1550&apos;s -- the same epoch that Vicentino was<br/>experimenting with chromatic and enharmonic music on his archicembalo<br/>or superharpsichord documented in his treatise of 1555.</p><p>While the Gesualdo piece was coded with the versatile EXAMPLE feature<br/>in Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala, the Lasso illustrates another approach:<br/>Aaron&apos;s et_compose. Each program has its own conventions.</p><p>A quick comment on the matter of _intentionally_ impure sonorities,<br/>maybe more notably relevant to the Lasso. In Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI<br/>system, there are typically two &quot;versions&quot; of a given note at 1/4<br/>syntonic comma or about 5.38 cents apart, and one can shift between<br/>these versions with little melodic disturbance.</p><p>A complication, however, is the _rhythmic_ alteration that would be<br/>required if one voice has a sustained note while others move to a new<br/>sonority which would require a retuning of that note in order to<br/>achieve vertical JI. Here a tempered sonority might harmonically, if<br/>very subtly, complement the rhythmic diversity of the parts -- as a<br/>suspension dissonance does at a much more obvious level.</p><p>However, Paul, you mentioned hearing beating in the Gesualdo piece at<br/>&quot;many of the harmonic points of rest&quot; -- and this comment, plus the<br/>mostly note-against-note motion of that piece leads me to suspect<br/>something other than intentionally impure sonorities, as I mentioned<br/>in my other post.</p><p>Also, for the curious, here&apos;s a link to the et_compose source file for<br/>the Lasso piece:</p><p>         &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue_etc">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue_etc</a>&gt;</p><p>In this file, notes are specified in a division of 1,200,000-EDO --<br/>that is, in thousands of a cent, which I find intuitive. The statement<br/>&apos;div=1200000&apos; at the start of the first voice &apos;1: &apos; chooses this<br/>division; the default, interestingly, is 19, possibly reflecting<br/>Aaron&apos;s interest in 19-EDO (e.g. _The Juggler_ and his harpsichord<br/>rendition of John Bull&apos;s _Ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la_).</p><p>A note is specified by a rhythmic value (e.g. &quot;1/1&quot; for a whole note,<br/>&quot;1/2&quot; for a half note) followed by a pitch value of octave number,<br/>period, and location within a C-C octave as measured in steps of the<br/>chosen division, here 1,200,000-EDO. Thus</p><p>4: 1/1 5.701955<br/>3: 1/1 5.386314<br/>2: 1/1 5.0<br/>1: 1/1 4.0</p><p>would show a note with a rhythmic value of &quot;1/1&quot; in each voice forming<br/>a just sonority with a ratio of 2:4:5:6 (C-C-E-G).</p><p>In each line, a stated rhythmic value or octave number implicitly<br/>applies to any subsequent notes until/unless a new value is stated.<br/>As in some 16th-century keyboard scores, simultaneous notes often but<br/>not always are roughly aligned vertically -- when they are, this can<br/>help in proofing.</p><p>Since there&apos;s been some discussion of Aaron&apos;s Gaussian rhythm<br/>&quot;humanization&quot; of MIDI files produced with et_compose, I might offer<br/>this piece as one example of what Aaron&apos;s algorithm (drawing on a<br/>feature of the Python language) does. Here repeating a link to a text<br/>version of the MIDI file, made with Piet van Oostrum&apos;s very useful<br/>program mf2t, might be convenient:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mf2t">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mf2t</a>&gt;</p><p>In reading this mf2t file, I should add that it&apos;s helpful to know that<br/>with et_compose notes for each voice alternate between two adjacently<br/>numbered MIDI channels -- voice 1 between channels 1 and 2, for<br/>example, and likewise voice 2 (channels 3 and 4), voice 3 (5 and 6)<br/>and voice 4 (7 and 8).</p><p>Here the MIDI resolution for a quarter note or crotchet is 5000,<br/>meaning that such a note is represented as 5000 MIDI timing units;<br/>thus each 4/2 measure takes 40000 such units. Since in this piece the<br/>shortest values are some ornamental eighth notes or quavers, &apos;note on&apos;<br/>messages would normally occur at MIDI timings evenly divisible by<br/>2500.</p><p>However, here the Gaussian rhythm variable &apos;gar&apos; is set to &apos;gar=125&apos;,<br/>which means, if I understand correctly, that MIDI events will be timed<br/>with a randomization factor based on a normal curve with a standard<br/>deviation of 125/5000 of a quarter note or crotchet. One illustration<br/>of how the algorithm can translate into practice comes at the opening<br/>of measure 3, where all voices simultaneously sound new notes. Without<br/>the randomization, each &apos;note on&apos; message should occur at 80000 units.</p><p>However, the actual note on messages occur at 79964 (voice 3 or<br/>tenor), 80048 (voice 1 or soprano), 80098 (voice 4 or bass) and 80307<br/>(voice 2 or alto).</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s a pleasure to make this music and documentation for the<br/>Lasso piece available as a celebration of some of the potentials of<br/>et_compose.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=9284 href="#9284">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2005 3:27:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>I&apos;ll have to compare your realizations later.
