On<br/>this one I&apos;m playing one of Jon Catler&apos;s &quot;12-tone Ultra Plus&quot;<br/>guitars.  It&apos;s pretty spacey, but with a mildly tribal<br/>undercurrent.  Just try to maintain concentration during the middle<br/>section...I dare ya....  This song makes even MY mind wander, until<br/>it picks up again during the last third or so.  Anybody who can name<br/>the 2nd to last chord that I play in the song (the one that I strum<br/>for like 30 seconds, because it just sounds so cool) gets a gold<br/>star.</p><p>Comments are welcome, but bear in mind that I didn&apos;t<br/>really &quot;compose&quot; this piece...it just sort of happened to me.</p></div>
