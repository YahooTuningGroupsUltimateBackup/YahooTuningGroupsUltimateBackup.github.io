His book has a few other &quot;near 7 equal&apos; scales. I corresponded with his son on this subject, who has since retired.  These tunings i passed to Erv after finding one of the Meru scales doing an uncanny fit. He came up with his Meta Mavila based on what he found in the tunings or had a tuning that fit. The original one i found works at least as well. But we can see others have taken off on his Meta Mavila. I use it on my Hammer dulcimer for one.<br/>Some of the most interesting tunings can be heard on the various Mbira recording he made. I do not think these have been figured out. Andrew had sent me some of these.</p><p>The Toumani Diabete stuff i heard was close to 12 EQ but maybe i am mixing the brothers up as there are a few. One is in LA still i think,  John Schneider knows him and might have some insight along those lines.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>microstick@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perfect time to ask this question...been listening to a bit of African &gt; music lately, and wondering if anyone knows what a standard Kora &gt; tuning might be?<br/>&gt; Got 2 Toumani Diabete CD&apos;s, a real virtuoso.

I have the LP, and could digitize for y&apos;all, if<br/>it&apos;s hard to get. Just a thought...</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Pete</p><p>--- microstick@... wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Perfect time to ask this question...been listening<br/>&gt; to a bit of African music lately, and wondering if<br/>&gt; anyone knows what a standard Kora tuning might be?<br/>&gt; Got 2 Toumani Diabete CD&apos;s, a real virtuoso.<br/>&gt; Although they mention the uneven intervals of one of<br/>&gt; the tunings, they don&apos;t say just how it&apos;s different.<br/>&gt; He uses Egyptian and Sauta tunings on &quot;The Mande<br/>&gt; Variations&quot; disc, lovely stuff.
