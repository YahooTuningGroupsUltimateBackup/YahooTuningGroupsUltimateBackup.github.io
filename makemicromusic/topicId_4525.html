This is not to disuade you<br/>from trying suggestions for notation programs, but<br/>just to say you will still have this pitch bend problem<br/>to deal with after that at the end of the day.</p><p>Here is the little stand alone program to test your<br/>pitch bend range in Windows:</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk/testpitchbendrange.exe">http://tunesmithy.co.uk/testpitchbendrange.exe</a></p><p>Right click and choose to save it anywhere<br/>- on your desktop is fine as it is a stand<br/>alone program with no other files neede. Then run it as<br/>usual. Select a device, click the button to test<br/>it and if you hear two identically pitched notes<br/>then it is fine. Otherwise, it is ignoring pitch<br/>bends or won&apos;t let itself get set to the<br/>standard Midi pitch bend range of +- 2 semitones.</p><p>Thans.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
