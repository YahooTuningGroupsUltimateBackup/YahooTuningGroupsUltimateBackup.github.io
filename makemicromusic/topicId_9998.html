It works<br/>like this:  people buy the synth now for $149 and if enough people<br/>buy it, that&apos;s it.  Otherwise, you get billed a little more later,<br/>depending on how many units are sold.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t do much for *me,* personally, since I paid close to $200<br/>for it, but maybe for somebody else, if enough people do it.</p><p>I have to say, though, it is the most revolutionary tool I have ever<br/>experienced in making electronic music, &apos;way back to my initial<br/>forays in around 1970 or so... certainly a real revolution in<br/>microtonal music...
