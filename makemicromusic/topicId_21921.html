There are photos of that arrangement in the<br/>Photos-section of this group.</p><p>Later I got two more PC-180A&apos;s (were cheap), detached the black keys<br/>from them and made one with all black keys which fits your<br/>description. To aid navigation I used colored stickers. It really is<br/>an improvement so you should do it if you are bothered by the<br/>standard &quot;two little pigs-three little pigs&quot;-arrangement and don&apos;t<br/>have the money to buy a two-dimensional controller. But since it is<br/>still one-dimensional there is still the problem of more widely<br/>spaced intervals if the tuning has more than 12 tones. But for<br/>example Bohlen-Pierce is manageable because there are only 13<br/>tones.</p><p>I now have a 16x16-monome (<a href="http://www.monome.org">www.monome.org</a>) which is not velocity<br/>sensitive but is otherwise quite useful for playing in alternative<br/>tunings and it has all those leds!</p><p>Kalle Aho</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;markallanbarnes&quot; &lt;mark.barnes3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been using Scala and a Yamaha PSR-175 midi keyboard to play in intonations other than 12 note equal temperament, but I think that the arrangement of the keys is unsuited to scales that do not have a pattern based on 12 notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I dismantled the keyboard and it seems that I could easily replace the keys with one row of evenly spaced keys that still push down on the  existing rubber bits that trigger the notes.
