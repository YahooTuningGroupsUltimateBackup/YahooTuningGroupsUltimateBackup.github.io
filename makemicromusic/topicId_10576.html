I&apos;ve heard everything from &quot;I like<br/>&gt;tape music concerts.  The lights go dim, there&apos;s no visual distractions,<br/>&gt;and it&apos;s just me and the music and I can really focus in on it&quot;</p><p>Those are cool.  I&apos;ve been to some great ones in San Francisco.  But<br/>you need a warm space with bean bag chairs and hopefully exposed<br/>wood somewhere.</p><p>&gt;And what could be more @#$%@#$% ridiculous than applauding a pair of<br/>&gt;speakers?!?!?!&quot;</p><p>Applause is for the composer if they&apos;re there.</p><p>&gt;I can see both points of view.  I would say that whether people &quot;start<br/>&gt;chatting&quot; or not depends more on the venue than whether or not you&apos;re<br/>&gt;playing tape music: if a concert was in a brewery, I&apos;m guessing people<br/>&gt;would chat away, whether you&apos;re just playing CDs, or you&apos;ve got a DJ</p><p>Hey, I almost forgot DJs!  How $&amp;@$%&amp;% is it to idolize them?</p><p>The kind of tape shows I&apos;ve been to have been the silent, dark kind.<br/>Except for wedding receptions and raves.</p><p>&gt;The usual solution is to turn the volume way up so that any &quot;chatting&quot;<br/>&gt;is more like screaming,  which adds to the fun fun fun &quot;we&apos;re all going<br/>&gt;to get laid tonight&quot; vibe that everyone seems to love about loud bars.</p><p>I totally hate that.</p><p>&gt;(And by the way:  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessarily bad that music is a<br/>&gt;background ambient thing.  Many great pieces were written for that<br/>&gt;purpose:  virtually all early operas,  Mozart divertimenti and such, and<br/>&gt;so on. the idea of &quot;being attentive&quot; only came into being relatively<br/>&gt;recently.</p><p>I think the practitioners/listeners of early Indian music were probably<br/>meant to be &quot;attentive&quot;, thousands of years ago (if liner notes are to<br/>be believed).</p><p>&gt;And I like the idea of having fun chatting with my friends, then once<br/>&gt;in a while noticing,  hey this music in the background is groovy stuff!)</p><p>I&apos;m not much for it, but some dig it.  Some good friends of mine have<br/>a band called the Mood Doculators which aim to do exactly that.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s true that multi-channel stuff is great;  I just got back from a<br/>&gt;festival in Montreal of 8-channel music (where I had a 19tet piece<br/>&gt;played, incidentally).</p><p>Oh, what piece?</p><p>&gt;That was a lot of fun.  In that case, there&apos;s more of a &quot;reason&quot; to<br/>&gt;have a &quot;tape&quot; music concert, since most people don&apos;t have a 16-, 10-, 8-,<br/>&gt;or even 4-  channel speaker setup in their home.</p><p>5.1 is increasingly common, and this is a viable delivery method.<br/>But I&apos;m a big fan of Kurt Bigler&apos;s 32-channel setup.</p><p>&gt;In any case,  I think what has worked pretty well, is to have variety on<br/>&gt;a program,  especially in a concert hall: &quot;tape&quot; music interspersed with<br/>&gt;works with dancers, or works with video, or works with live instruments<br/>&gt;and electronics, or what-have-you.</p><p>I personally don&apos;t like dancers with tape, or tape music in a formal<br/>concert hall setting.  Then again, I don&apos;t like any music in a<br/>formal concert hall setting!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
