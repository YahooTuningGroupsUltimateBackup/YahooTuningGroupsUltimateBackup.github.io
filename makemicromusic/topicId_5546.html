Oh well....</p><p>I was at this web site</p><p><a href="http://www.dennysguitars.homestead.com/whyopentune1.html">http://www.dennysguitars.homestead.com/whyopentune1.html</a></p><p>and was confused as to what he is trying to say about voicings. Can<br/>anyone please explain this to me. I understand everything up to the<br/>point where it says (in red type)&quot;ACHIEVING GIANT STEPS IN<br/>UNDERSTANDINGAND USING OPEN TUNING VOICINGS:&quot; which is about half way<br/>down the page.</p><p>I play slide guitar in open &quot;E&quot; tuning which is E,B,E,G#,B,E but it<br/>sounds as if his method of tuning the open E chord should be 135135<br/>which is E,G#,B,E,G#,B. This tuning also puts &quot;less stress&quot; on the<br/>guitars neck. Apparently by using this tuning, I have more access to<br/>other sounds???????? Is this what he is trying to say?</p><p>Thanks<br/>Walter</p></div>
