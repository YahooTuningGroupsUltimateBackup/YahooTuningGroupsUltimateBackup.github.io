If you are dabbling, or maybe just a little deeper than that, you might want to look at Anwida DX Reverb Light 2.0, available just for the cost of downloading:</p><p><a href="http://www.anwida.com/">http://www.anwida.com/</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2003 9:56:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

I could<br/>greatly use such a resource, and I&apos;m sure others could as well.  Just<br/>a suggestion...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I *DO* want to reserve time for myself to actually make music with these things!, but I&apos;ll try to post a synopsis.</p><p>I also want to, when I have the time to foster it, resurrect the ides of &apos;snapshots&apos; of peoples own work scenarios - a brief essay on what they use and how they use it.</p><p>The last caveat is that this is very much a moving target, and after initial info is shared people have to get out and try themselves - and then share what, and what doesn&apos;t - work.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
