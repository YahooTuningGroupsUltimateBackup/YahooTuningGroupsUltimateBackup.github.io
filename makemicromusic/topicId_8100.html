The thing is with the eikosany is that if you use it as it naturally unfolds leads one to other tonal point quite quickly. I think alison has some examples around that illustrate this. My creation of the worlds exploited this quality of the eikosany ( as practically most of my work before 1994)</p><p>&gt; scales where the tones are equally consonant/dissonant as in the Scales<br/>&gt;of Mt.

Can you or &gt;someone else who understands this give an example?<br/>&gt;<br/>threat the numbers has harmonics. my ensemble of Meta slendro instruments uses Meru number 3 starting on 7 and going up to 200 which gives you a good 12 tone scale. More often than not one drops the lower numbers cause these are more &apos;seeds&apos; of the series. one could also just make a scale out of the ratio that it converges on also, as well as treating the scale subharmonically. Personally i like the terrain where the convergence hasn&apos;t been reached to far.  This gives the most variety of subscales from your set. I had a 12 hour work day today so pardon if i am too lazy to look up which of the meru set of papers includes the zigzag charts that show you the MOS scales formed by each series, but it is a good idea to have this in mind. It is also possible to &quot;reseed&quot; the series in the same way you can the classic fibonacci series. more on all this later &gt;<br/>&gt;Best,<br/>&gt;Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!

I just took what Kraig had done on a Novatone (?)-fitted acoustic 12-string (one of those would be REALLY cool, done up right!) that&apos;s no longer extant, I believe.  The choice of D# and A# apparently yielded the most notes &apos;in common&apos; across the strings.  I think there&apos;s only one errant &apos;9/8&apos; that crept into my piece, with minimal emphasis, I hope.  I was/am pretty scrupulous to try to stay consistent that way.

In fact, I think an acoustic steel-string<br/>guitar is among the best timbre for utonal chords, due to the<br/>sympathetic resonance of the common overtones. Otonal chords work<br/>great with any harmonic or near-harmonic spectrum, including electric<br/>guitar of course. Adding distortion/overdrive will make the otonal<br/>chords sound awesome and the utonal chords sound like mush.</p><p>&gt; I used DDL&apos;s, at first.</p><p>Digital Delay Lines? Or . . .

Tremendous thanks for pointing that out!</p><p>Dave&apos;s solution, if I remember right, allows for all the Eikosany<br/>pitches and chords to be played in first position on the guitar, and<br/>the highest string continues the Eikosany scale. In higher positions<br/>on the other strings, though, you will find some non-<br/>Eikosany &apos;substitutes&apos; for Eikosany pitches, due to the straight-<br/>across frets. I think some of the open strings are tuned a neutral<br/>third apart from one another in Dave&apos;s scheme . . .</p><p>Best,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>Pete McRae &#x3C;petesfriedclams@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2005 8:54:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; To play as chords?<br/>&gt;&gt; Ooowww!   :-)</p><p>&gt; Well, I think that&apos;s where the real beauty/specialness of an Eikosany<br/>&gt; guitar will reveal itself.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s where I spend almost all of my time searching, and there haven&apos;t been _too_ many disappointments.  But I studied enough with some guitarists who could _really_ stretch (or scrunch) for those dazzling chords, so the &apos;ouch! factor&apos; in fingering is something I really don&apos;t mind...it just takes practice to execute.

Sorry, I couldn&apos;t resist the anachronism.  :-)  I tired of the looping thing really quickly, as an artistic medium, but it can still be a gas to practice with.  I&apos;m really trying to play as much as possible, in anticipation of a spiffy (ie xenharmonious) acoustic instrument.  Hopefully some new stuff will manifest itself.  I&apos;ve got the other country blues-y thing(s) almost done, just need time to record them as well as I can.  Then it&apos;s back to the real Eikosany, and maybe a new fretting???
