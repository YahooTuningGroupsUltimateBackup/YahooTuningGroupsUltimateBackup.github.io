I recently got into one at<br/>another music theory group, and it turned out to be the best,<br/>most lively and honest thread that group has seen in a while.<br/>And i got completely humiliated in the process!</p><p>what we all need to realize, is that microntonal composers are a<br/>very small segment of the population, a 3fraction of a<br/>2subsegment of another 1segment (1musicians who<br/>2compose in 3odd tunings).  As such, we should realize that we<br/>will occasionally have differences, but that they are vastly<br/>outweighed by our similarities.</p><p>in my experience, no musician will ever be above bickering.<br/>that&apos;s just the nature of the game.  drag it out into the open!  it&apos;s<br/>something most of us struggle with, unless we&apos;re too<br/>passive-agressive to admit it.</p><p>-just sticking my dumb nose in.<br/>scott</p></div><h3>piccolosandcheese &#x3C;jbarton@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2004 7:02:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And now, a mammoth reply:</p><p>1) Luring in the uninitiated:  As Andrew mentioned, there are different doors for<br/>different people.  The door I used was mapping xennish scales to the same ol&apos; MIDI<br/>keyboard and just banging on them.  However, no one had to convince me to try this;<br/>I sought it out myself.  If someone is more skeptical, they might have to be shown a<br/>major scale in 19 to accept it.  In this sort of case, the argument I always give is<br/>Partch&apos;s (extended to xenharmonics in general), that one can achieve far greater<br/>consonance and far greater dissonance than in 12.  I am also partially partial to the<br/>&quot;vast array of different moods&quot; approach, but I remain skeptical.</p><p>2) Scale aesthetics:  14 is quite happy to my ears.  Especially that 7:9:11-like chord<br/>that was pointed out - I am bedazzled.  Strangely, this general question as to 14 as a<br/>tuning is technically off-topic until I provide a musical example (I will...eventually) - I<br/>feel the &quot;limits&quot; here too.  Anyhow, for anyone interested in some less-than-twelve<br/>side-by-side listening, dig &quot;Moods,&quot; an addition at</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/funwithxenharmonicity/">http://www.soundclick.com/funwithxenharmonicity/</a></p><p>My verdict on some low temperaments after doing this:  6 can imply a lot of nice 12<br/>stuff. I HATE playing in 7! I looooove 9...and 10.  11 I didn&apos;t give a fair chance.  My<br/>banging-on-the-keyboard favorite remains 15.</p><p>Here&apos;s something that could be discussed, but perhaps on the main tuning, that<br/>grows out of this: we all know that &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot; are dependent on<br/>context.  A tuning has no context at all. 14 equal? What does that sound like?<br/>Well...are you using harmonic or inharmonic timbres? Sustained or not?  I would be<br/>interested to see how far you could push context (I&apos;m mostly thinking about note<br/>duration) to effectively mask out-of-tuneness.  An extension, I think, of Terry Riley&apos;s<br/>quote &quot;Western music is so fast because it is out of tune.&quot;</p><p>Jacob</p></div>
