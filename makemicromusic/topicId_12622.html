All I want to hear is some killer music, so however you get there is fine with me. And, Dan recently sent me a copy of his latest demo, and I think it&apos;s some of the best music I&apos;ve heard in years...he may be the most progressive guitarist/composer around at this time. Imagination, to me, is what&apos;s sorely lacking in most music/art today, and Dan has that many times over. That he used tuning systems that most people do not is a hoot. I myself like chordal music, so I like good sounding 3rds/5ths; but, if I had more $$$, I would have a collection of guitars that included many tunings, just to mess with them...Hstick<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
