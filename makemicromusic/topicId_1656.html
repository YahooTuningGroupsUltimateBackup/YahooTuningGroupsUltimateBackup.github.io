The show closed on Saturday night, so I<br/>&gt; have put up some excerpts from that music in MP3 format, and a web page<br/>&gt; with some explanation of the selections and the tuning. Included are three<br/>&gt; Christmas carol arrangements that I used for exit music after the play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/TheMiser/index.html">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/TheMiser/index.html</a></p><p>Just wanted to let you know that I enjoyed your music for _The Miser_,<br/>and am glad that my work on Ganassi&apos;s tuning inspired you to do this.</p><p>I feel compelled to mention something I just discovered a couple of<br/>weeks ago, in Barbour&apos;s book: Ganassi intended for some of the notes<br/>to be tempered slightly away from the JI ratios I give in my webpage.<br/>So the tuning I presented is really a rational &quot;archtype&quot; for the<br/>actual tuning.  The differences would be very slight -- the reason<br/>I haven&apos;t updated the webpage is that it&apos;s not exactly clear what<br/>the precise tuning would be -- but in any case, it should be mentioned.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
