First, I wrote what I wrote straight from the heart, and there are no hidden meanings or negative implications. Often, at the new year, I look ahead to the coming months, and try to imagine ways in which I, and hopefully others, can try and do our part to make the world a better place. Listening to the incredible music I mentioned made me want to try and make the best possible music I can...and, as a member of the tuning lists, which have quite a few musicians on them, I thought I would share my thoughts on that subject...which is exactly what I did. And, I do, indeed, hope everyone here who makes music, or talks about the theory involved, will try and do their best to do what they do with a great deal of soul...why not?</p><p>   And, I do believe there is music with no soul, or heart, or deep meaning...just as there are great and poor books, great and mediocre films,<br/>superb and meaningless poetry. And, sometimes very mediocre things will resonate with a large group of people, and they may very well be moved by such works...that&apos;s their right, but that doesn&apos;t mean that the works in question are any better for it. I do not know &quot;what sounds will speak to another&apos;s soul,&quot; as you said...but, I know, for example, that mediocre/terrible music can sell many millions of records. And, I&apos;m still going to call it mediocre, no matter how many folks like it...again, that is their right.</p><p>   I am also not &quot;anti intellectual and anti musical;&quot; I am anti intellectuality without any soul behind it, and anti music with no deep feeling. I would hope you would be, too. And, there were several folks on this list who responded positively to what I said, I believe they understood where I was coming from. And, I also  believe you read a bunch of stuff into my post that wasn&apos;t remotely intended...and why you did that is your affair, and doesn&apos;t involve me in the slightest. There&apos;s no need to start a ruckus over nothing, Mr. Wolf...it&apos;s a waste of our precious life&apos;s energy, and just puts out negative feelings where there should be none. I don&apos;t know the slightest thing about you, your beliefs, or what sort of person you are...and when I wrote my original post, I was not thinking of you in any fashion whatsoever, so there was no reason for you to get offended.</p><p>   So, again I will say...I hope we who study/compose/theorize about non 12 music will, in the coming year and beyond, try to make our works come from that place where the soul of man never dies...because without that quality, I think art is practically meaningless...very best to all...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://agenturadellarte.net">agenturadellarte.net</a>   <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=15677 href="#15677">ðŸ”—</a>Mohajeri Shahin &#x3C;shahinm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2007 5:45:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi<br/>Microtonality is the soul of music and microtonalist.<br/>It embraces him like sinking in a deep ocean of unheards .<br/>Having some microtones in soul to be consonant with the heaven of muse or not , He wonders what to do .<br/>He thinks and live microtonally , out of limit of Majority and minority.<br/>He will hear sounds of human antiquity, virgin cultures , birds and wind.<br/>He knows that , his soul is temperd with inner and outer world in such a way , to temper sounds .<br/>And , again , this is the question for him , to be consonant or not to be?<br/>Click here : My dear brother in music , Ozan Yarman ,sent me a poem related to above. &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_66249.html#66260">/tuning/topicId_66249.html#66260</a>&gt;</p><p>Shaahin Mohajeri</p><p>Tombak Player &amp; Researcher , Microtonal Composer</p><p>My web site&#x648;&#x628; &#x633;&#x627;&#x64A;&#x62A; &#x634;&#x627;&#x647;&#x64A;&#x646; &#x645;&#x647;&#x627;&#x62C;&#x631;&#x64A;   &lt;<a href="http://240edo.googlepages.com/">http://240edo.googlepages.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>My farsi page in Harmonytalk   &#x635;&#x641;&#x62D;&#x647; &#x627;&#x62E;&#x62A;&#x635;&#x627;&#x635;&#x64A; &#x62F;&#x631; &#x647;&#x627;&#x631;&#x645;&#x648;&#x646;&#x64A; &#x62A;&#x627;&#x643;   &lt;<a href="http://www.harmonytalk.com/mohajeri">http://www.harmonytalk.com/mohajeri</a>&gt;</p><p>Shaahin Mohajeri in Wikipedia  &#x634;&#x627;&#x647;&#x64A;&#x646; &#x645;&#x647;&#x627;&#x62C;&#x631;&#x64A; &#x62F;&#x631;&#x62F;&#x627;&#x626;&#x631;&#x647; &#x627;&#x644;&#x645;&#x639;&#x627;&#x631;&#x641; &#x648;&#x64A;&#x643;&#x64A; &#x67E;&#x62F;&#x64A;&#x627; &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaahin_mohajeri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaahin_mohajeri</a>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
