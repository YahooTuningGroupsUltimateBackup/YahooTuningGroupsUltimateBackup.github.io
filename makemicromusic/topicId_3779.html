While<br/>&gt; harmonic<br/>&gt; creativity seems both a skill and an art, and other techniques such as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; counterpoint and &apos;orchestration&apos; lean even more toward the craft end<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; things, my listening to both composers and improvisors leads me to<br/>&gt; believe<br/>&gt; that melody is more in the domain of personality and not learned<br/>&gt; technique.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe others on the list have ideas as to whether melody is a more<br/>&gt; personal<br/>&gt; reflection than other aspects of music-making, or if one can train<br/>&gt; oneself<br/>&gt; to become a gifted &apos;melodist&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lou Harrison claims that Schoenberg told him to listen to nothing but<br/>&gt; Mozart in order to learn about the art of melody.

In fact I could hum the whole<br/>&gt; concerto by heart. Must be something in that. I&apos;d tend to take advice<br/>&gt; from somebody like Schoenberg.</p><p>Additionally I&apos;ve been inspired by TS Elliot&apos;s work ethic.
