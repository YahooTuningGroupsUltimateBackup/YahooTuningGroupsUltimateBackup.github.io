He must<br/>&gt;undergo rigorous training in a number of fields (music, literature, dance,<br/>&gt;drama)  and is more like a secular priest than a mere performer. Indeed,<br/>&gt;the ritual allowing one to begin working as a dalang is closely akin to the<br/>&gt;ordination of a Hindu priest. (Note: While women priests are common in<br/>&gt;Bali, I&apos;m unaware of any women working in wayang.) Further, the dalang is<br/>thought<br/>&gt;of as a type of spiritual medium, one who in the performance of his art,<br/>&gt;opens lines of communication between the natural and supernatural worlds.<br/>&gt;He bridges the gap between those worlds and allows the unseen forces to speak<br/>&gt;through him. As such, although the plays themselves are almost always based<br/>&gt;on traditional and well known stories, they are typically laced with current<br/>&gt;social and political commentary, often couched in humorous terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The plays are presented on a 6 X 4 foot screen behind which is a<br/>&gt;hanging oil lamp which projects the flickering shadows of the leather<br/>&gt;puppets. There may be as many as 125 for possible use. The dalang sits<br/>&gt;behind the lamp which also has a microphone attached to it into which he<br/>&gt;speaks. He must be conversant in at least three languages: old Javanese<br/>&gt;(or Kawi), the language in which the plays transpire, and Balinese and<br/>&gt;Indonesian, the languages which the four clown-servants of the main (both<br/>&gt;good and bad) characters speak to translate and comment upon the proceedings<br/>&gt;for the audience, almost none of whom understand the old language.<br/>&gt;Additionally, he must speak in any number of voices, often switching between<br/>&gt;them in rapid succession, as it is he who speaks for each of the puppets.<br/>&gt;At the same time, he is manipulating and/or moving the puppets through space<br/>&gt;in an appropriate manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Between the toes of one foot, he also holds a wooden knob with which<br/>&gt;he strikes the box which holds the puppets when not in use, in this way<br/>&gt;directing the gamelan ensemble accompanying the play and adding dramatic<br/>&gt;emphasis to scenes with his rhythmic knocking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   There is also always a battle somewhere in the play between the<br/>&gt;forces of good and evil. While the &quot;good&quot; always wins, it is not a triumph<br/>&gt;in any ultimate sense, only a single moment wherein which the two forces<br/>&gt;are kept in some sort of balance which allows the world to remain in harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;While these battles take place in the &quot;physical&quot; realm, I was told a few<br/>&gt;years ago in Java, when I attended a wayang performance there, that the<br/>&gt;reason the good characters always triumph is that they have great &quot;inner&quot;<br/>&gt;strength, unlike the bad characters who only &quot;appear&quot; to be strong, acting<br/>&gt;blustery and throwing their weight around.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Parallels for improvisation exist in the way in which the free<br/>&gt;improviser moves between known and unknown worlds, allowing unconscious<br/>&gt;and subconscious realities to come into play; allowing different, perhaps<br/>&gt;seemingly mutually, exclusive voices to emerge. Also, as I&apos;ve written<br/>&gt;elsewhere, I see the improviser as fulfilling a type of shamanic function,<br/>&gt;forging sound realities which may exist as archetypes for the manner in<br/>&gt;which we would like to shape our world. We may also use sound<br/>&gt;therapeutically in this way, as part of  both a personal and social cultural<br/>&gt;context, allowing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; forces to play out in the sound world<br/>&gt;in such a way -- perhaps even with some levity -- that a respectful balance<br/>&gt;of same is achieved both within and around us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   It is worth noting too the spiritual preparation the dalang makes<br/>&gt;prior to performances, asking for protection from evil forces, some of<br/>&gt;which he will bring into being through the puppets. He asks also that the<br/>&quot;gods&quot;<br/>&gt;may speak through him in the performance and that the audience will take<br/>&gt;delight in his work -- which I take to mean that the audience will be<br/>&gt;delighted in their inherent recognition of  the archetypical realities<br/>&gt;presented in the play. Purification rites follow the performance as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The performances I saw, four in all, differed in the types of<br/>&gt;orchestras employed to accompany the plays, the level of involvement of<br/>&gt;the music with them, and the styles of working of the different dalangs. The<br/>&gt;performance from east Bali (Karangasem) and that from central Bali (Bangli)<br/>&gt;were similar in that the accompanying ensembles were more of a &quot;standard&quot;<br/>&gt;sort, four players of gamelan gender, 2 pairs of 10-keyed metalaphones<br/>&gt;tuned an octave apart in a 5-toned roughly equidistant (slendro) scale. (The<br/>&gt;players play the instruments two-handed with round-headed wooden hammers,<br/>&gt;continually damping the keys with the palms of their hands as they go.<br/>&gt;Lower-pitched unison lines are often played with the left hand while<br/>&gt;decorative lines of varying complexity are added with the right.) The<br/>&gt;ensemble from west Bali (Jembrana) used similar instrumentation, but with<br/>&gt;the addition of small gongs, cymbals (ceng-ceng), and an oblong two-headed<br/>&gt;drum (kendang). This type of ensemble is considerably more dramatic in<br/>&gt;effect and is used to accompany, among other things, tales from the<br/>&gt;Ramayana, typically those which include a fair amount of conflict. In this<br/>&gt;instance, however, it seemed to be almost &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; as, following<br/>&gt;a particularly auspicious and portentous opening, the dalang engaged his<br/>&gt;audience with more than an accustomed amount of humor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   By far the most ambitious production I saw was from the village of<br/>&gt;Sukawati, Gianyar (central Bali), a village with an island-wide reputation<br/>&gt;for the excellence of its dalangs. This shadow performance featured a quite<br/>&gt;large ensemble, some 20 musicians playing instruments of an ancient<br/>&gt;orchestra, the seven-tone gamelan selunding, whose keys are made of small<br/>&gt;to large iron slabs (most Balinese gamelan instruments have bronze keys)<br/>&gt;suspended over wooden trough resonators (as opposed to the individual-key<br/>&gt;bamboo resonators more commonly in use). The keys are struck with large<br/>&gt;wooden hammers; like the gamelan gender, the instruments are played<br/>&gt;two-handed. Included in the orchestra were four players of bamboo flutes<br/>&gt;(suling) who doubled at times on conch shells, adding subtle low tones<br/>&gt;to the sound of the ensemble.  Also featured were two drummers (of the oblong<br/>&gt;kendang) and players of large and small gongs and of cymbals (ceng-ceng).<br/>&gt;Even for this orchestra, only rarely heard in its villages of origin in<br/>&gt;east Bali (once a year in most locales), the addition of flutes, drums and<br/>gongs<br/>&gt;to the basic ensemble was extremely unusual.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The music itself was wild!  The flutes blew long, wavering<br/>&gt;on-and-off tones, continuously played, the results of circular breath.<br/>&gt;The drums interjected thunderous rhythms while the clanging, clattering<br/>sounds<br/>&gt;of  iron moved in, around and about in textural circles and rose and fell<br/>&gt;in smaller and larger percussive waves. A preliminary piece, such as is<br/>&gt;normally played prior to the beginning of the wayang itself, actually drew<br/>&gt;applause from an overwhelmingly Balinese audience, the first time I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;heard such a thing in this context. As is the case in all wayang<br/>performances,<br/>&gt; at times the gamelan only served to highlight and forward the action of the<br/>&gt;play. But even this was quite extraordinary. And then, when somewhere in<br/>&gt;the middle of the performance, the orchestra members put aside their<br/>instruments<br/>&gt;to vocally interject strains of &quot;ketchak&quot; (the now internationally<br/>&gt;well-known &quot;monkey chant&quot;),  the audience howled with delight and once<br/>&gt;again broke into applause. This ensemble&apos;s music was also the most integrally<br/>&gt;woven with the action of the play of any of the performances I saw.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The stories themselves, which I had to rely on others to relate to<br/>&gt;me, varied also. The first, presented by an elder dalang from east Bali,<br/>&gt;was somewhat out of character in that there were no &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; forces<br/>&gt;in the strict sense. Rather, the story concerned the coming to Bali of<br/>Hinduism<br/>&gt;and the resultant strife that ensued between Hindus and Buddhists over<br/>&gt;the truth of their respective religions. Eventually, however -- through<br/>&gt;constructive interactions  -- each came to view the other with tolerance<br/>&gt;and respect. The dalang related the story in a fairly &quot;serious&quot; manner and<br/>&gt;with an enormous amount of engagement. When the play was finished, after<br/>about<br/>&gt;an hour and a half, he was in a heavy sweat and appeared to be in an altered<br/>&gt;state. He reminded me of seeing Cecil Taylor coming off stage after an<br/>&gt;hour or so of intensely pursued piano improvisations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I never did get a sense of the plot in the obviously humorous tale<br/>&gt;presented by the dalang from Jembrana, the west. My driver and informant,<br/>&gt;who hailed from there, while admitting that the dalang was very funny (he<br/>&gt;himself was laughing throughout), felt the performance was &quot;out of place&quot;<br/>&gt;in the context of the Arts Festival. I think he was pretty much alone in this<br/>&gt;feeling, but he did not want to tell me too much about the story. I<br/>&gt;personally liked the dalang who, I felt, was extremely conscientious in<br/>&gt;his approach and, through his extensive use of humor, was attempting to blend<br/>&gt;old stories with new and to make old but universal messages meaningful<br/>&gt;to a modern audience. (Speaking of which, there was another more or less<br/>popular<br/>&gt;and &quot;famous&quot; dalang, Cenk Blonk, from Tabanan in the near west of Bali,<br/>&gt;who appeared in the festival but who I did not get a chance to see. He is<br/>well<br/>&gt;known for his manner of introducing modern characters into his plays. In<br/>&gt;his performance during the festival, I was told that he premiered a puppet<br/>&gt;of Amrozi, the &quot;smiling&quot; Bali bomber, as one of the evil protagonists!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The Bangli and Sukawati tales were similar in form, each with<br/>&gt;sections which included a fair amount of dialog. The Sukawati story told<br/>&gt;of the formation of Indonesia itself;  I&apos;m not entirely certain about the<br/>&gt;Bangli tale. There could not have been a greater contrast, however, between<br/>&gt;the two dalangs, both relatively young men (early 30s?). The Bangli dalang<br/>&gt;incorporated the gamelan, I felt, to least possible advantage. He also<br/>&gt;maintained a more taut and monophonic tone throughout. Uniquely, however,<br/>&gt;he often sang passages of the text, song-like rather than -- as is more<br/>usually<br/>&gt;the case -- rising-and-falling chant-like, and he at times used his tapping<br/>&gt;of the knob to create simple, drum-like rhythms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The Sukawati dalang, on the other hand, was almost certainly the<br/>&gt;most sophisticated of any of these wayang masters. He only slowly brought<br/>&gt;his figures onto the screen. They appeared as flickering ghosts,<br/>&gt;materializing from nothing. His sense of drama was so great that I<br/>&gt;frequently felt on the edge of my seat, even while my actual understanding<br/>&gt;of the play&apos;s content was negligible. It was rather like entering a movie<br/>&gt;theatre in the middle of a great film you know little about but immediately<br/>&gt;recognizing the style of it as masterful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I attended one other festival program of great interest which<br/>&gt;featured as its main work a new piece for double gamelan orchestra (two<br/>&gt;gamelan &quot;semara dana&quot; from the village of Pengosekan in central Bali) by<br/>&gt;the American composer and Bali music scholar (now living in Vancouver)<br/>Michael<br/>&gt;Tenzer. The overall program featured various mixed works for Balinese and<br/>&gt;western instruments and included a handful of players both from California&apos;s<br/>&gt;Gamelan Sekar Jaya (of which Tenzer was an original founder) and an ensemble<br/>&gt;from Canada. The Sekar Jaya members worked with Balinese composer I Nyoman<br/>&gt;Windha to premiere a new work, Jaya Baya (translated as &quot;Victory over<br/>&gt;Tragedy&quot;), which featured  trumpet, clarinet, guitar, violin, tablas, and<br/>&gt;a small (four-tone angklung) gamelan ensemble. It was an ultimately<br/>optimistic<br/>&gt;piece, with much feeling and pathos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Without question, however, Michael Tenzer&apos;s new work was &quot;the event&quot;<br/>&gt;of the evening. To understand its context, some background is in order.<br/>&gt;While nearly all Balinese music is based on pentatonic scales and nearly<br/>&gt;all large, modern (kebyar) ensembles contain only a single (multiple octave)<br/>&gt;scale of that sort, in the 1980s a new hybrid gamelan of seven tones (the<br/>&gt;gamelan semara dana) was created so that various types of Balinese music<br/>&gt;might be played on a single set of instruments. The idea was to be able<br/>&gt;to use the gamelan for fast, kebyar-type music (this music is normally played<br/>&gt;single-handed, one&apos;s free hand being used to damp the keys, allowing the<br/>&gt;players great speed to create rapid-fire, interlocking rhythms) but also<br/>&gt;to have the capability of playing older, more elevated court styles as well.<br/>&gt;Until recently, that&apos;s the way the semara dana gamelan was approached.<br/>&gt;Then, only three years ago (in the context of engaging Gamelan Sekar Jaya in<br/>&gt;a type of &quot;battle of the bands&quot;), a work was created in Pengosekan, &quot;Geregel&quot;<br/>&gt;(also performed as a part of  this program), which for the first time<br/>&gt;proposed a multi-pentatonic, multi-modal style of Balinese music. The piece<br/>&gt;included structural innovations as well, unusual silences and a broad<br/>&gt;dramatic sense not entirely common in Balinese music; to oversimplify,<br/>&gt;a sense of drama as much between as embedded within the lines. (The work<br/>&gt;has been documented on Wayne Vitale&apos;s Vital records on an excellently<br/>recorded<br/>&gt;CD entitled &quot;Cudamani&quot;. The extensive program notes by Wayne are an<br/>&gt;education as well.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   So Michael Tenzer&apos;s piece took off from this new structurally open,<br/>&gt;multi-pentatonic, multi-modal perspective, upping the musical ante both<br/>&gt;in the piece&apos;s ambition and by throwing in another whole orchestra. The work,<br/>&gt;whose name I&apos;m unable to recall, was programmatic in nature, but its nature<br/>&gt;was such that it served to further the musical advancement. That is, it<br/>&gt;had to do with a first-time meeting between two entirely different cultures,<br/>&gt;each one represented by one of the two orchestras which faced each other<br/>&gt;across an open-air stage. As the piece commenced, each orchestra began<br/>&gt;playing entirely in its own musical universe, paying little if any attention<br/>&gt;to what was transpiring across the way from it. Additionally, the orchestra<br/>&gt;on the left began by playing extremely quietly while the orchestra on the<br/>&gt;right was more demonstrably loud and assertive. There were any number of<br/>&gt;textural twists, some marvelous sudden rhythmic interjections and shifts<br/>&gt;in dynamics until finally, at the piece&apos;s center, a powerful yet slightly<br/>&gt;uneasy unanimity was achieved between the two bodies. The collective power<br/>&gt;of it was exhilarating, yet it lasted only briefly. Gradually, the heady<br/>&gt;communion began to come apart, each orchestra retreating into its own<br/>&gt;parameters, then finally retiring to musical spaces which mirrored the<br/>&gt;opening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   There were some subtle, yet important, visual components to the work<br/>&gt;as well. For example, in the middle of the piece, one of the two drummers<br/>&gt;from each orchestra exchanged drums, symbolic of creating a cultural bridge<br/>&gt;between the groups. Also, at the work&apos;s conclusion, each of the players<br/>&gt;of the large gongs from each orchestra abandoned their posts at the rear of<br/>&gt;the stage and walked to the front. As the large gong is more or less the<br/>anchor<br/>&gt;of any gamelan ensemble, I took the musicians leaving their instruments<br/>&gt;to indicate that while the piece was finished, the process itself was<br/>&gt;unfinished; unfinished because it is an ongoing one and must be continually,<br/>&gt;freshly re-engaged in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   In all, it was a relatively short piece, no longer than 15 minutes;<br/>&gt;but there was an opportunity to hear it played twice, both at the beginning<br/>&gt;of the evening and again at the end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Marvelous on its own terms, this piece was also personally<br/>&gt;interesting to me in its implications for improvisation. Cultural relations,<br/>&gt;after all, while steeped in social identities, are nothing more than<br/>&gt;personal relations played out on a larger scale. That said,  the main thing<br/>&gt;that has always interested me about group improvisation is how much musical<br/>&gt;independence or sense of true self individuals might maintain while<br/>&gt;(equally) contributing to and upholding a group identity. A prevalence<br/>&gt;among improvisers, I often feel, is that they are either reluctant to allow<br/>their<br/>&gt;full selves to come forth; or else they are assertive to the point of<br/>&gt;overshadowing the contributions of the other players. So did this piece<br/>&gt;suggest any answers? What it mainly suggested, it would seem, is the<br/>&gt;difficulty of maintaining that precarious and delicate balance between<br/>&gt;the individual and the group. It likewise suggested to me that, despite the<br/>&gt;elusiveness of means to an ultimately unified end, an honest process itself<br/>&gt;(of improvisation) may be just as worthy as any final &quot;result&quot;  that is<br/>&gt;achieved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Certain background material for this report came from the online<br/>&gt;article, &quot;Wayang Kulit:Shadow Puppet Performances&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(<a href="http://www.murnis.com/wayangkulit.htm">http://www.murnis.com/wayangkulit.htm</a>) at Murni&apos;s Website: &quot;Articles on<br/>&gt;Balinese Culture&quot;; also from Wayne Vitale&apos;s notes to &quot;Cudamani: The<br/>&gt;Seven-Tone Gamelan Orchestra From the Village of Pengosekan, Bali&quot; (Vital<br/>&gt;Records 440).</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist</p><p> &quot;Welcome and explore and inquire into everything, new or old, that comes<br/>your way, and then build your own music on whatever your inner life has been able<br/>to take in and offer you back again.&quot; - Henry Cowell</p><p>&quot;Music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the Ideas, but a<br/>copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas.

Also, as I&apos;ve<br/>written<br/>&gt; &gt;elsewhere, I see the improviser as fulfilling a type of shamanic<br/>function,<br/>&gt; &gt;forging sound realities which may exist as archetypes for the<br/>manner in<br/>&gt; &gt;which we would like to shape our world. We may also use sound<br/>&gt; &gt;therapeutically in this way, as part of  both a personal and<br/>social cultural<br/>&gt; &gt;context, allowing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; forces to play out in the sound<br/>world<br/>&gt; &gt;in such a way -- perhaps even with some levity -- that a<br/>respectful balance<br/>&gt; &gt;of same is achieved both within and around us.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   It is worth noting too the spiritual preparation the dalang<br/>makes<br/>&gt; &gt;prior to performances, asking for protection from evil forces,<br/>some of<br/>&gt; &gt;which he will bring into being through the puppets. He asks also<br/>that the<br/>&gt; &quot;gods&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;may speak through him in the performance and that the audience<br/>will take<br/>&gt; &gt;delight in his work -- which I take to mean that the audience will<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt;delighted in their inherent recognition of  the archetypical<br/>realities<br/>&gt; &gt;presented in the play. Purification rites follow the performance<br/>as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   The performances I saw, four in all, differed in the types of<br/>&gt; &gt;orchestras employed to accompany the plays, the level of<br/>involvement of<br/>&gt; &gt;the music with them, and the styles of working of the different<br/>dalangs. The<br/>&gt; &gt;performance from east Bali (Karangasem) and that from central Bali<br/>(Bangli)<br/>&gt; &gt;were similar in that the accompanying ensembles were more of<br/>a &quot;standard&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;sort, four players of gamelan gender, 2 pairs of 10-keyed<br/>metalaphones<br/>&gt; &gt;tuned an octave apart in a 5-toned roughly equidistant (slendro)<br/>scale. (The<br/>&gt; &gt;players play the instruments two-handed with round-headed wooden<br/>hammers,<br/>&gt; &gt;continually damping the keys with the palms of their hands as they<br/>go.<br/>&gt; &gt;Lower-pitched unison lines are often played with the left hand<br/>while<br/>&gt; &gt;decorative lines of varying complexity are added with the right.)<br/>The<br/>&gt; &gt;ensemble from west Bali (Jembrana) used similar instrumentation,<br/>but with<br/>&gt; &gt;the addition of small gongs, cymbals (ceng-ceng), and an oblong<br/>two-headed<br/>&gt; &gt;drum (kendang). This type of ensemble is considerably more<br/>dramatic in<br/>&gt; &gt;effect and is used to accompany, among other things, tales from the<br/>&gt; &gt;Ramayana, typically those which include a fair amount of conflict.<br/>In this<br/>&gt; &gt;instance, however, it seemed to be almost &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; as,<br/>following<br/>&gt; &gt;a particularly auspicious and portentous opening, the dalang<br/>engaged his<br/>&gt; &gt;audience with more than an accustomed amount of humor.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   By far the most ambitious production I saw was from the village<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;Sukawati, Gianyar (central Bali), a village with an island-wide<br/>reputation<br/>&gt; &gt;for the excellence of its dalangs. This shadow performance<br/>featured a quite<br/>&gt; &gt;large ensemble, some 20 musicians playing instruments of an ancient<br/>&gt; &gt;orchestra, the seven-tone gamelan selunding, whose keys are made<br/>of small<br/>&gt; &gt;to large iron slabs (most Balinese gamelan instruments have bronze<br/>keys)<br/>&gt; &gt;suspended over wooden trough resonators (as opposed to the<br/>individual-key<br/>&gt; &gt;bamboo resonators more commonly in use). The keys are struck with<br/>large<br/>&gt; &gt;wooden hammers; like the gamelan gender, the instruments are played<br/>&gt; &gt;two-handed. Included in the orchestra were four players of bamboo<br/>flutes<br/>&gt; &gt;(suling) who doubled at times on conch shells, adding subtle low<br/>tones<br/>&gt; &gt;to the sound of the ensemble.  Also featured were two drummers (of<br/>the oblong<br/>&gt; &gt;kendang) and players of large and small gongs and of cymbals (ceng-<br/>ceng).<br/>&gt; &gt;Even for this orchestra, only rarely heard in its villages of<br/>origin in<br/>&gt; &gt;east Bali (once a year in most locales), the addition of flutes,<br/>drums and<br/>&gt; gongs<br/>&gt; &gt;to the basic ensemble was extremely unusual.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   The music itself was wild!  The flutes blew long, wavering<br/>&gt; &gt;on-and-off tones, continuously played, the results of circular<br/>breath.<br/>&gt; &gt;The drums interjected thunderous rhythms while the clanging,<br/>clattering<br/>&gt; sounds<br/>&gt; &gt;of  iron moved in, around and about in textural circles and rose<br/>and fell<br/>&gt; &gt;in smaller and larger percussive waves. A preliminary piece, such<br/>as is<br/>&gt; &gt;normally played prior to the beginning of the wayang itself,<br/>actually drew<br/>&gt; &gt;applause from an overwhelmingly Balinese audience, the first time<br/>I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt;heard such a thing in this context. As is the case in all wayang<br/>&gt; performances,<br/>&gt; &gt; at times the gamelan only served to highlight and forward the<br/>action of the<br/>&gt; &gt;play. But even this was quite extraordinary. And then, when<br/>somewhere in<br/>&gt; &gt;the middle of the performance, the orchestra members put aside<br/>their<br/>&gt; instruments<br/>&gt; &gt;to vocally interject strains of &quot;ketchak&quot; (the now internationally<br/>&gt; &gt;well-known &quot;monkey chant&quot;),  the audience howled with delight and<br/>once<br/>&gt; &gt;again broke into applause. This ensemble&apos;s music was also the most<br/>integrally<br/>&gt; &gt;woven with the action of the play of any of the performances I<br/>saw.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   The stories themselves, which I had to rely on others to relate<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;me, varied also. The first, presented by an elder dalang from east<br/>Bali,<br/>&gt; &gt;was somewhat out of character in that there were no &quot;good&quot;<br/>and &quot;evil&quot; forces<br/>&gt; &gt;in the strict sense. Rather, the story concerned the coming to<br/>Bali of<br/>&gt; Hinduism<br/>&gt; &gt;and the resultant strife that ensued between Hindus and Buddhists<br/>over<br/>&gt; &gt;the truth of their respective religions. Eventually, however --<br/>through<br/>&gt; &gt;constructive interactions  -- each came to view the other with<br/>tolerance<br/>&gt; &gt;and respect. The dalang related the story in a fairly &quot;serious&quot;<br/>manner and<br/>&gt; &gt;with an enormous amount of engagement. When the play was finished,<br/>after<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt;an hour and a half, he was in a heavy sweat and appeared to be in<br/>an altered<br/>&gt; &gt;state. He reminded me of seeing Cecil Taylor coming off stage<br/>after an<br/>&gt; &gt;hour or so of intensely pursued piano improvisations.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I never did get a sense of the plot in the obviously humorous<br/>tale<br/>&gt; &gt;presented by the dalang from Jembrana, the west. My driver and<br/>informant,<br/>&gt; &gt;who hailed from there, while admitting that the dalang was very<br/>funny (he<br/>&gt; &gt;himself was laughing throughout), felt the performance was &quot;out of<br/>place&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;in the context of the Arts Festival. I think he was pretty much<br/>alone in this<br/>&gt; &gt;feeling, but he did not want to tell me too much about the story. I<br/>&gt; &gt;personally liked the dalang who, I felt, was extremely<br/>conscientious in<br/>&gt; &gt;his approach and, through his extensive use of humor, was<br/>attempting to blend<br/>&gt; &gt;old stories with new and to make old but universal messages<br/>meaningful<br/>&gt; &gt;to a modern audience. (Speaking of which, there was another more<br/>or less<br/>&gt; popular<br/>&gt; &gt;and &quot;famous&quot; dalang, Cenk Blonk, from Tabanan in the near west of<br/>Bali,<br/>&gt; &gt;who appeared in the festival but who I did not get a chance to<br/>see. He is<br/>&gt; well<br/>&gt; &gt;known for his manner of introducing modern characters into his<br/>plays. In<br/>&gt; &gt;his performance during the festival, I was told that he premiered<br/>a puppet<br/>&gt; &gt;of Amrozi, the &quot;smiling&quot; Bali bomber, as one of the evil<br/>protagonists!)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   The Bangli and Sukawati tales were similar in form, each with<br/>&gt; &gt;sections which included a fair amount of dialog. The Sukawati<br/>story told<br/>&gt; &gt;of the formation of Indonesia itself;  I&apos;m not entirely certain<br/>about the<br/>&gt; &gt;Bangli tale. There could not have been a greater contrast,<br/>however, between<br/>&gt; &gt;the two dalangs, both relatively young men (early 30s?). The<br/>Bangli dalang<br/>&gt; &gt;incorporated the gamelan, I felt, to least possible advantage. He<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt;maintained a more taut and monophonic tone throughout. Uniquely,<br/>however,<br/>&gt; &gt;he often sang passages of the text, song-like rather than -- as is<br/>more<br/>&gt; usually<br/>&gt; &gt;the case -- rising-and-falling chant-like, and he at times used<br/>his tapping<br/>&gt; &gt;of the knob to create simple, drum-like rhythms.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   The Sukawati dalang, on the other hand, was almost certainly the<br/>&gt; &gt;most sophisticated of any of these wayang masters. He only slowly<br/>brought<br/>&gt; &gt;his figures onto the screen. They appeared as flickering ghosts,<br/>&gt; &gt;materializing from nothing. His sense of drama was so great that I<br/>&gt; &gt;frequently felt on the edge of my seat, even while my actual<br/>understanding<br/>&gt; &gt;of the play&apos;s content was negligible. It was rather like entering<br/>a movie<br/>&gt; &gt;theatre in the middle of a great film you know little about but<br/>immediately<br/>&gt; &gt;recognizing the style of it as masterful.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I attended one other festival program of great interest which<br/>&gt; &gt;featured as its main work a new piece for double gamelan orchestra<br/>(two<br/>&gt; &gt;gamelan &quot;semara dana&quot; from the village of Pengosekan in central<br/>Bali) by<br/>&gt; &gt;the American composer and Bali music scholar (now living in<br/>Vancouver)<br/>&gt; Michael<br/>&gt; &gt;Tenzer. The overall program featured various mixed works for<br/>Balinese and<br/>&gt; &gt;western instruments and included a handful of players both from<br/>California&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;Gamelan Sekar Jaya (of which Tenzer was an original founder) and<br/>an ensemble<br/>&gt; &gt;from Canada. The Sekar Jaya members worked with Balinese composer<br/>I Nyoman<br/>&gt; &gt;Windha to premiere a new work, Jaya Baya (translated as &quot;Victory<br/>over<br/>&gt; &gt;Tragedy&quot;), which featured  trumpet, clarinet, guitar, violin,<br/>tablas, and<br/>&gt; &gt;a small (four-tone angklung) gamelan ensemble. It was an<br/>ultimately<br/>&gt; optimistic<br/>&gt; &gt;piece, with much feeling and pathos.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Without question, however, Michael Tenzer&apos;s new work was &quot;the<br/>event&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;of the evening. To understand its context, some background is in<br/>order.<br/>&gt; &gt;While nearly all Balinese music is based on pentatonic scales and<br/>nearly<br/>&gt; &gt;all large, modern (kebyar) ensembles contain only a single<br/>(multiple octave)<br/>&gt; &gt;scale of that sort, in the 1980s a new hybrid gamelan of seven<br/>tones (the<br/>&gt; &gt;gamelan semara dana) was created so that various types of Balinese<br/>music<br/>&gt; &gt;might be played on a single set of instruments. The idea was to be<br/>able<br/>&gt; &gt;to use the gamelan for fast, kebyar-type music (this music is<br/>normally played<br/>&gt; &gt;single-handed, one&apos;s free hand being used to damp the keys,<br/>allowing the<br/>&gt; &gt;players great speed to create rapid-fire, interlocking rhythms)<br/>but also<br/>&gt; &gt;to have the capability of playing older, more elevated court<br/>styles as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;Until recently, that&apos;s the way the semara dana gamelan was<br/>approached.<br/>&gt; &gt;Then, only three years ago (in the context of engaging Gamelan<br/>Sekar Jaya in<br/>&gt; &gt;a type of &quot;battle of the bands&quot;), a work was created in<br/>Pengosekan, &quot;Geregel&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;(also performed as a part of  this program), which for the first<br/>time<br/>&gt; &gt;proposed a multi-pentatonic, multi-modal style of Balinese music.<br/>The piece<br/>&gt; &gt;included structural innovations as well, unusual silences and a<br/>broad<br/>&gt; &gt;dramatic sense not entirely common in Balinese music; to<br/>oversimplify,<br/>&gt; &gt;a sense of drama as much between as embedded within the lines.<br/>(The work<br/>&gt; &gt;has been documented on Wayne Vitale&apos;s Vital records on an<br/>excellently<br/>&gt; recorded<br/>&gt; &gt;CD entitled &quot;Cudamani&quot;. The extensive program notes by Wayne are an<br/>&gt; &gt;education as well.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   So Michael Tenzer&apos;s piece took off from this new structurally<br/>open,<br/>&gt; &gt;multi-pentatonic, multi-modal perspective, upping the musical ante<br/>both<br/>&gt; &gt;in the piece&apos;s ambition and by throwing in another whole<br/>orchestra. The work,<br/>&gt; &gt;whose name I&apos;m unable to recall, was programmatic in nature, but<br/>its nature<br/>&gt; &gt;was such that it served to further the musical advancement. That<br/>is, it<br/>&gt; &gt;had to do with a first-time meeting between two entirely different<br/>cultures,<br/>&gt; &gt;each one represented by one of the two orchestras which faced each<br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt;across an open-air stage. As the piece commenced, each orchestra<br/>began<br/>&gt; &gt;playing entirely in its own musical universe, paying little if any<br/>attention<br/>&gt; &gt;to what was transpiring across the way from it. Additionally, the<br/>orchestra<br/>&gt; &gt;on the left began by playing extremely quietly while the orchestra<br/>on the<br/>&gt; &gt;right was more demonstrably loud and assertive. There were any<br/>number of<br/>&gt; &gt;textural twists, some marvelous sudden rhythmic interjections and<br/>shifts<br/>&gt; &gt;in dynamics until finally, at the piece&apos;s center, a powerful yet<br/>slightly<br/>&gt; &gt;uneasy unanimity was achieved between the two bodies. The<br/>collective power<br/>&gt; &gt;of it was exhilarating, yet it lasted only briefly. Gradually, the<br/>heady<br/>&gt; &gt;communion began to come apart, each orchestra retreating into its<br/>own<br/>&gt; &gt;parameters, then finally retiring to musical spaces which mirrored<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;opening.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   There were some subtle, yet important, visual components to the<br/>work<br/>&gt; &gt;as well. For example, in the middle of the piece, one of the two<br/>drummers<br/>&gt; &gt;from each orchestra exchanged drums, symbolic of creating a<br/>cultural bridge<br/>&gt; &gt;between the groups. Also, at the work&apos;s conclusion, each of the<br/>players<br/>&gt; &gt;of the large gongs from each orchestra abandoned their posts at<br/>the rear of<br/>&gt; &gt;the stage and walked to the front. As the large gong is more or<br/>less the<br/>&gt; anchor<br/>&gt; &gt;of any gamelan ensemble, I took the musicians leaving their<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; &gt;to indicate that while the piece was finished, the process itself<br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt;unfinished; unfinished because it is an ongoing one and must be<br/>continually,<br/>&gt; &gt;freshly re-engaged in.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   In all, it was a relatively short piece, no longer than 15<br/>minutes;<br/>&gt; &gt;but there was an opportunity to hear it played twice, both at the<br/>beginning<br/>&gt; &gt;of the evening and again at the end.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Marvelous on its own terms, this piece was also personally<br/>&gt; &gt;interesting to me in its implications for improvisation. Cultural<br/>relations,<br/>&gt; &gt;after all, while steeped in social identities, are nothing more<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt;personal relations played out on a larger scale. That said,  the<br/>main thing<br/>&gt; &gt;that has always interested me about group improvisation is how<br/>much musical<br/>&gt; &gt;independence or sense of true self individuals might maintain while<br/>&gt; &gt;(equally) contributing to and upholding a group identity. A<br/>prevalence<br/>&gt; &gt;among improvisers, I often feel, is that they are either reluctant<br/>to allow<br/>&gt; their<br/>&gt; &gt;full selves to come forth; or else they are assertive to the point<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;overshadowing the contributions of the other players. So did this<br/>piece<br/>&gt; &gt;suggest any answers? What it mainly suggested, it would seem, is<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;difficulty of maintaining that precarious and delicate balance<br/>between<br/>&gt; &gt;the individual and the group. It likewise suggested to me that,<br/>despite the<br/>&gt; &gt;elusiveness of means to an ultimately unified end, an honest<br/>process itself<br/>&gt; &gt;(of improvisation) may be just as worthy as any final &quot;result&quot;<br/>that is<br/>&gt; &gt;achieved.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Certain background material for this report came from the online<br/>&gt; &gt;article, &quot;Wayang Kulit:Shadow Puppet Performances&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(<a href="http://www.murnis.com/wayangkulit.htm">http://www.murnis.com/wayangkulit.htm</a>) at Murni&apos;s<br/>Website: &quot;Articles on<br/>&gt; &gt;Balinese Culture&quot;; also from Wayne Vitale&apos;s notes to &quot;Cudamani: The<br/>&gt; &gt;Seven-Tone Gamelan Orchestra From the Village of Pengosekan, Bali&quot;<br/>(Vital<br/>&gt; &gt;Records 440).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---<br/>&gt; Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &quot;Welcome and explore and inquire into everything, new or old, that<br/>comes<br/>&gt; your way, and then build your own music on whatever your inner life<br/>has been able<br/>&gt; to take in and offer you back again.&quot; - Henry Cowell<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the<br/>Ideas, but a<br/>&gt; copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas.<br/>For this<br/>&gt; reason, the effect of music is so very much more powerful and<br/>penetrating than is<br/>&gt; that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow,<br/>but music<br/>&gt; of the essence.&quot; - Schopenhauer, _The World as Will and<br/>Representation_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than<br/>stasis. ...<br/>&gt; improvisation is about a constant change.&quot; - Steve Beresford<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the<br/>assumptions<br/>&gt; that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; -<br/>John Berndt<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &quot;We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dream.<br/>Wandering by<br/>&gt; lone sea breakers, and sitting by desolate streams.
