I hope to try &apos;em<br/>&gt; out before long. Interesting that Medieval thirds might be tuned<br/>&gt; both Pythagorean for cadences and JI otherwise, at least according<br/>&gt; to that one authority of the time.</p><p>Please let me thank you for your most gracious words as well as your<br/>beautiful performances of this music, and add out of an abundance of<br/>cation a clarification that both Christopher Page and I are here<br/>addressing specifically the question of medieval _English_ intonation; for<br/>Continental 13th-14th century music, regular Pythagorean tuning is the<br/>usual keyboard solution.</p><p>As it happens, 12-equal isn&apos;t so far from Pythagorean, and thus a quite<br/>reasonable compromise for your fine Ars Subtilior renditions, Harold.<br/>Especially with brighter timbres (e.g. plucked ones), major thirds at 400<br/>cents can sound quite active and exciting -- appropriate for this music,<br/>although ironically the kind of effect which, for example, might have<br/>made the harmonium when tuned in 12-equal not-so-popular for playing<br/>European Renaissance-Romantic music based more or less on ratios of 5.</p><p>Thank you playing some of my favorites, and for capturing some of the<br/>exquisite balance between the vertical and horizontal elements --<br/>including, of course, the complex and sophisticated rhythms, as in the<br/>Baude Cordier piece _Amans ames_.</p><p>I should add that I really loved the Willaert setting, which I learned is<br/>in no less than seven voices! While I might simply have done this in<br/>meantone (TX802 P04 for 1/4-comma with pure 5:4 major thirds), your<br/>timbres were at once very appealing and (at least to me) stylistically<br/>compatible with 12-equal. One could argue that there is also a<br/>16th-century precedent for this kind of timbre/tuning accommodation: in<br/>1581, Vincenzo Galilei (father of the astronomer Galileo) noted that<br/>12-equal, which he considered a &quot;perfect&quot; tuning because of its symmetry,<br/>was ideal for lutes, but on the harpsichord with its more &quot;vehement&quot; sound<br/>production, 2/7-comma meantone (the favorite tuning of his former teacher<br/>and frequent opponent in theoretical debates Zarlino) sounded better.</p><p>Anyway, you put together one beautiful performance: to me this seems like<br/>maybe the more &quot;traditional&quot; side of Willaert, and I was reminded of the<br/>style of some early 16th-century German songs by Senfl, for example, as<br/>well as maybe some Spanish settings from the same epoch.</p><p>If I may ask, how did you record this music: by multi-track recording from<br/>a MIDI keyboard, for example? Am I right that this could be done either by<br/>recording each layer as audio output from the TX-802, or by capturing MIDI<br/>keystrokes and then playing them back?</p><p>Carl: again, I would emphasize that the following scale from an English<br/>treatise of 1373 on organ design is simply one possible answer to how<br/>English music might have tuned on keyboard at that time. I&apos;ve taken Bb as<br/>part of the regular Pythagorean tuning (Bb-B), since this note like the<br/>seven diatonic ones is regarded as _musica recta_ or part of the regular<br/>gamut, in contrast to other _musica ficta_ or &quot;invented&quot; accidentals. The<br/>other accidentals are placed so as to divide a whole-tone into 18:17:16<br/>(string ratio, with the smaller 18:17 below, e.g. F-F#-G).</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/english1373.scl">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/english1373.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>In this interpretation, the most impure fifth is B-F#, about 15 cents<br/>narrow -- curiously similar to the popular early 15th-century modified<br/>Pythagorean tuning of Gb-B on the Continent, an interesting choice on<br/>keyboard for early compositions of Dufay, for example, where this is the<br/>&quot;Wolf&quot; or diminished sixth, narrow by a full Pythagorean comma<br/>(531441:524288, ~23.46 cents).</p><p>Anyway, especially since this is MMM, now my challenge is to make some<br/>recordings illustrating some of these tunings -- and some possibly<br/>refinements of 14th-century Pythagorean tuning where major thirds and<br/>sixths in directed progressions expanding to fifths and octaves can be<br/>tuned rather _wider_ than usual Pythagorean.</p><p>However, Harold, getting back to your musical offering: in addition to<br/>producing some beautiful performances, you&apos;ve illustrated an important<br/>point: musical values and sensitive performance involve more than the<br/>choice of a tuning system.</p><p>Again, congratulations -- and many thanks!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=8926 href="#8926">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2005 11:17:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt;Carl: again, I would emphasize that the following scale from an English<br/>&gt;treatise of 1373 on organ design is simply one possible answer to how<br/>&gt;English music might have tuned on keyboard at that time.
