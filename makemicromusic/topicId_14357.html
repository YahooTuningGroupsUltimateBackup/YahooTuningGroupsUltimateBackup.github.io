But they really don&apos;t, and so I don&apos;t.  I do<br/>invite anyone in the least bit dissatisfied with the internet&apos;s<br/>representation of things microtonal to make their desires known.</p><p>One thing I think would be useful is the transfer of particularly<br/>well-formulated messages from this and other Yahoo! groups.  Now that<br/>the search function has been greatly improved, it&apos;s easier to find<br/>things, so this is less necessary, but also since it&apos;s easier, why not?</p><p>2) One page within the above, MusicWatch, is an attempt to keep track<br/>of all the new downloadable microtonal music announced on this list,<br/>in a format more boiled-down than possible on this discussion list.  I<br/>am looking for one or more Gnomes who actively follow the list anyway,<br/>to ensure that the list doesn&apos;t miss anything.</p><p>3) In related news, the internet Microtonal Listening List was easily<br/>transfered from the <a href="http://riters.com/microtonal">riters.com/microtonal</a> wiki to this one.  If your<br/>website is going to be around for a long time, it&apos;s not a bad idea to<br/>add it to the list.</p><p>4) The deadline of the Seventeen Tone Piano Project call for scores is<br/>a month and a day away!  C&apos;monnn, a whole MONTH!  Plenty of time!<br/>Relax, and get to work!  Personally, I&apos;m still planning something<br/>ethereal with a vocalist and a 13-limit-no-fives tonality diamond...</p><p>Do let me know if you have any questions about the Project, as I am<br/>anxious to encourage the participation of every interested person.</p><p>5) A page of 17-tone music theory exists also at the wiki<br/>(/SeventeenTheory), and it could certainly use some more diverse<br/>viewpoints.  Anyone have any favorite modes?  Pretty graphs?  Time to<br/>churn out some didactic midi files?  Germane anti-equal-temperament<br/>slogans?  (I suggest you make these only as acts of constructive<br/>procrastination between composing spells...)</p><p>Thanks for your attention, affection, and anticipation,<br/>Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=14385 href="#14385">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2006 5:03:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com</a> is starving for contributions.<br/>&gt; The front page currently contains a list of my wiki wishes, and if<br/>&gt; all were in existence I would dare say that we have a vibrant<br/>&gt; community of microtonalists here.
