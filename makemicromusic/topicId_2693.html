It&apos;s an FM<br/>synthesizer that&apos;s a generation or two ahead of the TX802, in terms of<br/>voices.</p><p>There&apos;s a cool demo of it on their home page. Go out to:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?home_us">http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?home_us</a></p><p>scroll down the left side until you find the downloadable demos. (And they<br/>do ask for registration before downloading. It worked for me.)</p><p>One cool thing about this demo is that the full keyboard is retuntable in<br/>real time. Bring up the demo. Look for the &quot;PITCH&quot; button along the top row<br/>of green buttons. When you go in to the &quot;Pitch&quot; mode, there is a<br/>&quot;Microtuning&quot; section on the lower right corner. You can mess with all<br/>octaves, sliding the individual pitches up and down with sliders.</p><p>Unfortunately, this synth appears to be mono-timbral.</p><p>So now my question of the day... Is there, in the world, _ANY_ software<br/>synth at any price that is multi-timbral and polyphonic and totally<br/>microtonally tunable like the TX802???</p><p>Thanks,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=2696 href="#2696">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>4/13/2002 2:10:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt; So now my question of the day...
