What is it?<br/>If I&apos;m correct- the tuning, built on perfect fifths only, must have<br/>220Hz-446Hz-904Hz... etc. octaves (if we start from 220Hz).<br/><a href="http://www.rdrop.com/users/tblackb/music/temperament/">http://www.rdrop.com/users/tblackb/music/temperament/</a><br/>Yours is different.<br/>Thanks for advice on FTS, I will definitely look into it later.<br/>ATM I&apos;m copying .mid file into Cubase5.1 track, then hit &quot;Play&quot; to<br/>load it into FM7 which is assigned for the same track.</p><p>Mitya</p></div>
