I went for a fishing line job on a really<br/>cheap guitar (maybe $20).  It was problematic because the fretboard<br/>wasn&apos;t flat.  It may not matter so much with proper frets, but that&apos;s<br/>something to check.  If it&apos;s worth paying for a refretting, it&apos;s worth<br/>paying for a decent guitar, so go for that $100 range.  And try it out<br/>in the shop.  If it sounds good it can&apos;t be bad.</p><p>&gt; Also, please pick two of the following four numbers: 15, 16, 19, 22</p><p>19, 22 :-P</p><p>Combining them is left as an exercise for the interested reader.  I<br/>never got that working, but as I said, my fretboard wasn&apos;t flat.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2011 7:03:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I too will say 19 and 22 on your guitar refrets</p><p>So far I&apos;ve deleted 7 threads from last night ....</p><p>On Sat, Feb 26, 2011 at 11:43 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey guys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m about to get a few more refrets done.

The thing about cheap guitars is that the quality varies greatly.  I&apos;ve had some good luck with Squiers in the past but also some really *bad* luck.  Epiphones can be good, and I had a cheap Takamine for years that I really loved.  I&apos;d say for the money Epiphone will probably be the most consistent, but don&apos;t be afraid of getting a no-name brand if you can play it first and verify the sound.</p><p>I&apos;d say 15 and 19.  On a steel-string 22 will murder your fingers and you will have a hard time playing chords that take advantage of 22&apos;s harmonic features.  Also I find that 19 actually sounds quite a bit more &quot;septimal&quot; and it&apos;s really easy to play a 4:5:7:9:11 chord with 19&apos;s open-string tuning--the same cannot be said for 22.  15 will be extra-playable and you can dazzle your friends with its &quot;all-4ths-but-still-two-octave&quot; open tuning, you&apos;ll get Blackwood and Porcupine, and to be perfectly honest steel-string guitars are so inharmonic the 4ths and 5ths will sound just fine.  And I can&apos;t stress enough just how *simple* it is to play 15 on guitar--never has guitar felt so easy to me as it did when I played in 15.</p><p>And as I am the only person on this list who has actually played all four of these tunings on guitar, I can say that 15 and 19 are easily the most rewarding to play (by which I mean, the easiest to make sound good).  22 is frustrating because you *know* there are so many things you should be able to do with it, but on guitar it&apos;s a hell of a challenge to live up to the potential of the system.</p><p>Much as I love 16, I don&apos;t think you will find it as rewarding as 15 and 19.  It will not impress your friends very much and you may find yourself cursing the crappy fifths.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>Also, if you want, I can e-mail you some chord and scale diagrams for these various tunings to show you what you&apos;ll be up against in each one.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey guys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m about to get a few more refrets done.

(or 19 or 22)?</p><p>19 is the only one I can do video for right now, as the Freenote neck went on the body that had the 15/18 fishing-line neck.  I sold my 22-tone super-strat to Bill Sethares for $500 a few years ago...kinda regretting that now!  But I&apos;ll try to do a video for 19 in the next few days, once I get my bearings.</p><p>&gt; The whole thing has some kind of otherworldly feel to it, once you<br/>&gt; stop thinking in terms of modes and start thinking in terms of 5-limit<br/>&gt; harmony (well, at least that&apos;s how I have to start thinking). Then<br/>&gt; again, I feel like I should probably explore 15 or 19 or 22 first.</p><p>16 is hands-down the weirdest tuning I&apos;ve played.  Compared to 16, even 11 and 13 feel normal.  When I first heard Ron&apos;s stuff in 16 my brain totally did a BSoD.  It&apos;s great to have on hand to really slam people with the shock-value.</p><p>&gt; My question to you is - why do you keep recommending 19? What can 19<br/>&gt; do that&apos;s so different? It has some rough 7-limit stuff and some even<br/>&gt; rougher 11-limit stuff... It has magic, I guess, and Barbados[9], but<br/>&gt; 22 has the first decent porcupine and superpyth too...</p><p>It also has Negri[9] and [10], which I find to be a much better 5-limit temperament than Porcupine in terms of melodic properties, though a bit higher in complexity.  Also, 19 is really more Godzilla than Barbados because of of the 81/80 vanishing, in the 9-note MOS you get exactly 1 good 5-limit major and 1 good 5-limit minor.  But at any rate, that scale is *really fucking cool* when you realize that it has 7 perfect fifths, but every triad has two types of third possible at the same time.  The fact that 19&apos;s subminor 3rd is right between 7/6 and 8/7 means it can actually do double-duty: 6:7:9 triads AND 7:8:9 triads both sound really good.  You&apos;ll see.</p><p>But seriously, in 22 the septimal harmonies just don&apos;t sound very striking.  And the Superpyth scale is just wonky.  Did you listen to the Superpyth track I did on &quot;Early Microtonal Works&quot;?  It&apos;s called &quot;Through the Streets&quot;.  It sounds weak and really not all that interesting, especially melodically.  Using Godzilla for septimal harmony in 19 seems to work a lot better.</p><p>19 also has some quirky dissonant stuff that seems to work out in interesting ways.  There&apos;s an 8-note scale of 2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 that I&apos;m pretty sure manages to avoid 4ths and 5ths completely, and is a nice way to force yourself out of the 5-limit.</p><p>Most importantly though is that it&apos;s easier to push 19 to its limits on guitar than it is with 22.  When I played in 22, I felt like I was constantly losing my place.  I know, you probably think--&quot;It&apos;s only three more notes, it can&apos;t be THAT different&quot;.  Yet somehow it is.  You&apos;ll see when I send you the chord and scale charts.</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
