So much for respectful disagreement.</p><p>If you want a multitrack environment for recorded, &apos;static&apos; compositions,<br/>then yeah, logic is great and max is overkill.  On the other hand, if you<br/>want custom algorithms that respond to a performer in realtime, or simply a<br/>sound installation or background music that never repeats itself (think<br/>digital wind chimes!) then max/pd is the only way to go.  I&apos;ve used pd in<br/>both ways with great success.  It wouldn&apos;t have been harder in logic:  it<br/>would have been *impossible.*  You can hear both pieces here:</p><p><a href="http://cmbryan.com/Dialogue_hi.ogg">cmbryan.com/Dialogue_hi.ogg</a><br/><a href="http://cmbryan.com/ensemble_sample.ogg">cmbryan.com/ensemble_sample.ogg</a></p><p>I had a friend who was going to spend hours tweaking individual samples to<br/>put in logic for an installation that would have had to go on loop, and I<br/>showed her how to automate the process in pd and generate it in realtime.</p><p>Comparing Logic to Max is like comparing a can opener to a screwdriver.<br/>Anyone who tells you one of them is unnecessary obviously doesn&apos;t know what<br/>its purpose is.</p><p>And yeah, I&apos;m an academic nerd, so there ;)  Actually, I just left my degree<br/>program because I realised I have forgotten (or maybe never learned!) what<br/>it means to really be a musician.  Here&apos;s hoping I can get back to the<br/>process of figuring that out.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On 14/12/2007, Charles Lucy &lt;makemicro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Don&apos;t waste your time with MSP etc. and all the applications that the<br/>&gt; academic nerds suggest on the tuning lists.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Most of them are lame on Macs, and require command line operation,<br/>&gt; including scala)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a Mac use the Logic Pro 8 latest edition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is about $500 and has everything you could possibly need.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have been using Logic and its earlier incarnations for the past ten<br/>&gt; years.
