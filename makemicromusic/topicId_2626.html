Here&apos;s the basic info:</p><p>Godspace continues the spacious vocal music of Spectral Voices&apos;<br/>recordings from the water tower.  This is Jim Cole&apos;s solo debut<br/>and<br/>is the fourth CD released on Spectral Spiral Music.  Godspace&apos;s<br/>many-<br/>voiced layers of harmonic singing were created within the deep<br/>reverberation of a virtual water tower with extensive looping.  The<br/>only sound source for this album was the human voice.</p><p>To hear MP3 clips of Godspace please visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com/clips.htm">http://www.spectralvoices.com/clips.htm</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the special new release price: $10.98 (with shipping INCLUDED -<br/> $14.98 for orders outside of the US) when you order directly through<br/>our site!</p><p>Thanks for your support,</p><p>~Jim Cole<br/>Spectral Spiral Music<br/><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a><br/>jimcole@...<br/>P.O.
