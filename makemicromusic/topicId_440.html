Not just<br/>cm - I was browsing various groups just then,<br/>downloading files (or trying to), that sort of thing.<br/>Wasn&apos;t logged into any of them on starting.</p><p>Found only way to sign in to any of them was to untick<br/>the box saying to remember the password on the computer.<br/>But then if you do that you get asked to re-sign<br/>in at various stages. Never quite got to point of downloading<br/>the file I was aiming for.</p><p>When I tried again later, it had cleared itself up.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>X. J.

This time, didn&apos;t,<br/>and one had to sign in by hand, which only worked if one unticked<br/>the save password cookie box.</p><p>That would have been okay, but you get asked to re-sign in rather<br/>frequently if one does it that way.</p><p>Later in evening tried again and the cookies were working again.<br/>Wondered if it could be something specific to what I&apos;d been<br/>doing but as others were having same thing, I imagine it may<br/>well be a little glitch at the yahoo end in the management<br/>of the cookies.</p><p>robert</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;X.
