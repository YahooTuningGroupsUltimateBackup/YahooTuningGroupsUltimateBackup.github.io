Fine.</p><p>MMM is supposed to be about making the music, not the technology.

Great.</p><p>For myself, I promise to cut back on my conceptual posting.</p><p>I&apos;ll be making a new group as well, MMR. Making Microtonal Reverb.</p><p>OK, I broke my promise in one sentence flat.</p><p>To all, be well,<br/>GZ</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

Fine.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget that there are always people new to a medium, and what you or I read (for what seems like the umpteenth time) may be their first. In that sense, it serves a purpose.</p><p>&gt;MMM is supposed to be about making the music, not the technology.</p><p>The technology helps to make the music, and if people need information, then others can share.</p><p>&gt;This list has talked more about reverb and plug-ins than scale design or &gt;just general information about composing.</p><p>Then that is only by nature of what people contribute, and if responded to then what people find of value. When things veer too much off-topic, I try to reign it in. Like I&apos;m about to do (maybe...) with this &quot;wood&quot; thing you keep bringing up.</p><p>And the list has had detailed discussions about tubular instruments, about bar instruments, and other acoustic means. It hasn&apos;t been singularly electronic, even if it has skewed in that direction. Want more acoustic instrument discussions? Send in a post that discusses some of it!</p><p>&gt;It all boils down to the fact that tuning is just a tool, a choice. A &gt;small part of a nutritious breakfast. We still need to start, develop, and &gt;end a work. With all the myriad details that entails. Spending countless &gt;hours programming, reading manuals, etc, is not my idea of composition.</p><p>OK, that&apos;s a good start! What *is* your idea of composition? What pieces would you like to share with those ideas? In what ways would you like to broaden the horizons of your compositional techniques.</p><p>&gt;So, a new list has been formed for you techheads. Great.</p><p>That isn&apos;t very fair, especially to people who do a lot of acoustic playing (like me, for instance).</p><p>C&apos;mon, GZ, we&apos;ve all had good laughs from your posts, and I hope you can remember the times that people have been supportive over the last months. If the current direction seems away from what interests you, then add to the flow of the river and see who else chimes in. And, especially, let&apos;s have you share some of the music you are making!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
