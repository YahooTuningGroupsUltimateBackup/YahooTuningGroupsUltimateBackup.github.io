You can edit any of these, seems to<br/>me.

But the only one that currently exists is for<br/>equal temperament retunings.</p><p>Jon continued:</p><p>&gt; Here, here, Bill! Tell them...</p><p>Yes, I had written to the author of the EDO script<br/>asking if he could write a script that<br/>could somehow load in scala files. From looking at the<br/>scripting language, though, I wasn&apos;t too hopeful,<br/>since it has no commands to read in files of any kind.<br/>I guess even a thick book isn&apos;t enough...</p><p>However -- there is good news. &quot;Li&apos;l Miss&apos; Scale Oven&quot;<br/>(LMSO) can do it. It&apos;s at:</p><p><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com">http://www.nonoctave.com</a></p><p>Rather than reading the scala file into the script,<br/>LMSO reads in the scala file and<br/>then automatically writes a Kontakt script.<br/>You can then save it, and it&apos;s instantly<br/>available in any instrument.<br/>It&apos;s actually quite a bit more flexible than that --<br/>you can have many tunings active at once,<br/>and switch between them easily. The only downsides are<br/>that it is Mac only and that it is not free.<br/>On the other hand, X. J. Scott has worked hard<br/>to figure this stuff out, and I am pretty happy with the<br/>money spent (and time saved over trying to do it myself).</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=10404 href="#10404">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2005 8:09:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill!</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I guess even a thick book isn&apos;t enough...</p><p>Philistines.</p><p>&gt;However -- there is good news. &quot;Li&apos;l Miss&apos; Scale Oven&quot; (LMSO) can do it. &gt;It&apos;s at:</p><p>Excellent - X.J. is a smart one.

I think that most people<br/>yelling are trying to get a genuine NI person to help<br/>them with something, and this is the step that is<br/>difficult.
