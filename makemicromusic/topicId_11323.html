You might want to check the thread<br/>&quot;Microtuning the orchestra&quot; where I discussed it. Manueal made specific<br/>modifications to Scala that make relaying work very nicely with GPO.

I know everyone has<br/>their own preferred compositional process, tools, etc. I just mentioned<br/>GPO because the thread touched on sampling, and I&apos;ve had good experiences<br/>with it, and people in the microtonal community have been working on relays<br/>to make it usable with any possible tuning.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=11341 href="#11341">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2005 10:09:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ah, well, that&apos;s a different matter.
