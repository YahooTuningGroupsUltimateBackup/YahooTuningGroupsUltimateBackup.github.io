(Also, there&apos;s info here that others<br/>might find profitable.)</p><p>&gt; From: Robert Walker &lt;robertwalker@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, August 05, 2001 4:10 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [MMM] Re: Monz trip to Europe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t yet done anything about the trip to Holland.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However just today I thought I&apos;d better look out the passport<br/>&gt; in case it needed to be renewed. Turned out it is still valid<br/>&gt; until 30th Sept 01 :-).</p><p>Ooh!... I&apos;m glad you mentioned that!  Whew!, mine is still valid<br/>for 5 more years... but I did have to check!</p><p>&gt; So only thing to do is to get the ticket, don&apos;t know how far<br/>&gt; in advance one needs to do that. I tend to leave things late.<br/>&gt; I expect I&apos;ll go by boat - like the fresh sea air and being on<br/>&gt; board a boat. Esp. so since I have a kind of hay fever like<br/>&gt; reaction to cigarette smoke, which makes fresh air useful -<br/>&gt; that may be worth mentioning in case any of you smoke - it gives<br/>&gt; me a bad headache and I&apos;m not easily able to give full attention to<br/>&gt; discussion etc. after that.</p><p>Graham Breed has already told me that he has an aversion to<br/>flying, mainly because of his environmental stance regarding<br/>jet-fuel pollution.  (And I agree with him, but I&apos;m being<br/>forced, by time and financial reasons, to be a hypocrite.)<br/>Perhaps the two of you might want to coordinate your travel<br/>plans from UK to Netherlands.</p><p>If you do decide to fly, you won&apos;t beat the fares from Ryanair<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ryanair.com">www.ryanair.com</a>&gt;.  They fly from UK to Brussels at incredibly<br/>low rates.  I&apos;ll be using Brussels as my gateway to Italy, and<br/>so will have to do some ground transportation between Brussels,<br/>Amsterdam, and Paris.  I expect to be arriving back in Brussels<br/>from Italy on September 17, and have to be back in Paris on the<br/>21st.  So that gives us roughly 3 days together in the Netherlands.</p><p>&gt; Maybe an idea also to say in advance that I&apos;m not much inspired<br/>&gt; by the idea of a &quot;microtonal microsoft&quot;, being much more interested<br/>&gt; in idea of diversity of programs that all call each other, as FTS<br/>&gt; and SCALA call each other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be nice to be able to call up JM from FTS by passing a<br/>&gt; scale to it to show as a lattice, just as I can pass a scale<br/>&gt; to SCALA to show there and work with in SCALA.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then it is up to the programmers of JM to make it a nice program<br/>&gt; that users will want to linger in and explore once they have looked<br/>&gt; at the lattice. I imagine it will be if it is anything like the<br/>&gt; C++ version. That was near first release stage when I tried it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully you&apos;ll get a few FTS users sent your way, who download JM<br/>&gt; in order to enable the &quot;show lattice in JM&quot; button.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like to keep things small and diverse, and like idea of<br/>&gt; lots of programs calling each other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the web is much richer for its diversity, and one can think<br/>&gt; of programs as somewhat analagous to web pages. ONe comes across<br/>&gt; &quot;universal&quot; type web sites, and very useful they are too, but they<br/>&gt; are part of the diversity too!</p><p>Yes, originally (back in the mid-1980s) I had hoped that JustMusic<br/>would be the be-all-and-end-all microtonal composition software<br/>application, but I&apos;m tending more and more these days to think<br/>along the same lines as you.  The programs that you, Graham, and<br/>Manuel have already released can already do *so* much that I wanted<br/>JustMusic to do, that this approach really makes a lot of sense.</p><p>&gt; Anyway will be great to meet up with everyone, and sometimes<br/>&gt; the things that one least expects are the ones that are most<br/>&gt; valuable.</p><p>I&apos;m certain that this trip, particularly the Netherlands segment<br/>of it, is going to be one of the highpoints of my life.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=387 href="#387">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 7:46:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Jon Szanto &lt;JSZANTO@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, August 06, 2001 4:18 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [MMM] Re: Monz trip to Europe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Robert, Hi Monz!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You guys really know how to be mean: here are all these other people<br/>&gt; who can&apos;t get away for a trip to Europe, and you two are making plans<br/>&gt; right in front of us! :)</p><p>Well... considering what else is going on in my life right now,<br/>I really &quot;can&apos;t&quot; get away for this trip either! ... I&apos;m forcing myself<br/>to do this!  :)  (seriously, I am... if I wasn&apos;t already scheduled<br/>into the conference I&apos;d wait until I had more time and money)</p><p>&gt; But seriously, folks, it&apos;s ok to make these public, since traffic is<br/>&gt; a little slow for now, but also please bear in mind the purpose of<br/>&gt; this little corner of the net and use your good judgement. Mainly, I<br/>&gt; just don&apos;t want to set any bad precedents for long, off-topic threads.</p><p>I know, Mom... sorry.  We&apos;ll keep the rest of it off-list.<br/>Mainly, I wanted to post that message here because I thought everyone<br/>ought to know how cheap those Ryanair flights are!  If you can<br/>get to the UK or Brussels, you can go anywhere in Europe for about<br/>$20 to $70 round-trip!!</p><p>&gt; AND - I hope you&apos;ll both report back on the proceedings, regarding<br/>&gt; the software meetings and on the Monz&apos;s performance/lecture. Have a<br/>&gt; great trip!</p><p>OF COURSE!  I&apos;ll be writing *reams* of stuff about what happens!<br/>(and all on-topic!)</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
