Just as travelling over small speed<br/>bumps or road markings can emit a rumbling tone throughout a vehicle,<br/>the melody road uses the spaces between to create different notes.</p><p>Depending on how far apart the grooves are, a car moving over them<br/>will produce a series of high or low notes, enabling cunning<br/>designers to create a distinct tune.</p><p>Patent documents for the design describe it as notches &quot;formed in a<br/>road surface so as to play a desired melody without producing simple<br/>sound or rhythm and reproduce melody-like tones&quot;.</p><p>There are three musical strips in central and northern Japan - one of<br/>which plays the tune of a Japanese pop song. Notice of an impending<br/>musical interlude, which lasts for about 30 seconds, is highlighted<br/>by coloured musical notes painted on to the road. According to<br/>reports, the system was the brainchild of Shizuo Shinoda, who<br/>accidentally scraped some markings into a road with a bulldozer<br/>before driving over them and realising that they helped to produce a<br/>variety of tones.</p><p>The designs were refined by engineers at the institute in Sapporo.<br/>The team has previously worked on new technologies including the use<br/>of infra-red light to detect dangerous road surfaces.</p><p>But motorists expecting to create their own hard rock soundtrack<br/>could find themselves struggling to live the dream. Not only is the<br/>optimal speed for achieving melody road playback a mere 28mph, but<br/>locals say it is not always easy get the intended sound.</p><p>&quot;You need to keep the car windows closed to hear well,&quot; wrote one<br/>Japanese blogger. &quot;Driving too fast will sound like playing fast<br/>forward, while driving around 12mph has a slow-motion effect, making<br/>you almost car sick.&quot;</p><p>Yahoo!
