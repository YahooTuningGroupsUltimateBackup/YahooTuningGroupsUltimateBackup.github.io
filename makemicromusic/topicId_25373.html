That seems really easy to understand, and that&apos;s what I was saying. Some paintings are astonishing, some are mediocre...some authors are deep and profound, some are abominable. There are many many levels of feeling/emotion/spiritual understanding in the Universe...some are on one level, others are on others...same with quarterbacks, baseball players, whatever. Everyone puts their feelings into whatever they do...some are on deeper levels of expression than others, and that is reflected in their art...no biggie...best...Hstick...www.microstick.net<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
