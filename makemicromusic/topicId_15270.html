There&apos;s a lot of thematic excitement and energy that<br/>holds my attention, as well as maybe a suggestion of Persian modes in<br/>a new context. As others have said, you have a talent for orchestration<br/>that can tie in very nicely with new tunings as well as traditional<br/>ones.</p><p>All three pieces reflect your skill in this direction and musical<br/>breadth, but for some reason the melodic and rhythmic action of the<br/>first _For Baran_ piece especially captured my attention.</p><p>Peace and love, with best wishes for Baran and Sara,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
