Yea, it&apos;s a little like that stuff in pine trees, but who<br/>cares? If we never stuck our necks out, we&apos;d never _______.</p><p>Thanks for this one, I enjoyed it. It almost all downloaded, about 2:40.</p></div><h3><a id=1101 href="#1101">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/19/2001 5:06:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., George Zelenz &lt;ploo@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JDL,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I kinda liked it, especially the hook.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>And congratulations for letting a little bit of your creative self<br/>come out and play.  Honestly I prefer hearing this to the retuned<br/>masterpieces of others.  Its real and its you.</p><p>Graham thanks for the link to Stina Nordenstom.  I always like<br/>hearing new female vocalists.  I wish she had some sound bytes on<br/>Amazon but I&apos;m going to trust your judgement and order away, along<br/>with some Terry Bozio stuff Jon recommended last week.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div>
