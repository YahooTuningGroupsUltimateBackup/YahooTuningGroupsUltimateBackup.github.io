Makes me giddy. Your approach as<br/>described below is both very wise and effective, and I agree with you<br/>completely about rhythm. As for sounding dated, I think anyone who<br/>likes progressive rock will love these pieces. You may have already<br/>answered this question before, but I wonder, what synth(s) are you<br/>using for these?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you most kindly, Mr. Smith!

I&apos;ve actually taken a great deal of<br/>inspiration from your works as well, as they are some of the few more<br/>classically-oriented compositions I&apos;ve heard that actually exploit the<br/>strengths of the more &quot;unusual&quot; EDOs.</p><p>&gt; You may have already<br/>&gt; answered this question before, but I wonder, what synth(s) are you<br/>&gt; using for these?</p><p>Native Instruments FM-7 for everything but the drums/percussion.  I&apos;ll<br/>admit that I didn&apos;t bother to use scala and retune to the full EDOs,<br/>but rather used the built-in microtuner to do 12-note subsets (I can<br/>practically hear some list members exclaiming &quot;Microtonal music that<br/>doesn&apos;t use *every* note in the tuning, and is only accurate to 1<br/>cent? Heresy!&quot;).  This is because 1) I don&apos;t find pitch deviations<br/>less than 1 cent to be audibly distinct, and 2) my purpose is to<br/>exploit alternative tonalities of no more than 11 notes per scale, not<br/>to exploit the infinite multitudes of modulational possibilities or<br/>functional chromatic harmony, so I don&apos;t *need* any more than 12 notes<br/>per song.  Heck, when I write in 12-EDO, I scarcely ever use all 12 of<br/>those notes, so why would I need more than 12 notes of a<br/>greater-than-12-EDO scale?</p><p>But I digress.</p><p>Thanks for listening!</p><p>-Igliashon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you most kindly, Mr. Smith!
