Several weeks back we<br/>were talking about belief systems and math, and I challenged myself<br/>to see if I couldn&apos;t find some of the belief systems which kept me<br/>from being an active contributor on tuning -math :-) (Jacky found<br/>that hysterical!)</p><p>Well that led me back to Hypatia, a 4th c female mathematician who<br/>was stoned to death for her mathematical knowledge by a gang of<br/>Christian monks.</p><p>In this piece I am playing with 46 TET and 75TET, fronm the Stern<br/>_Brocot scale tree.   I think I&apos;m going to have to look a little<br/>further than Hypatia to get up to speed for tuning math, but I am<br/>very much enjoying the process :-))</p><p><a href="http://64.225.101.47/HeartMath1.html">http://64.225.101.47/HeartMath1.html</a></p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div>
