This follows on the heels this morning of an &apos;encouraging&apos; note from Jacky Ligon, which I&apos;ll reply to later - suffice to say that he is spot-on with his commentary, and it really warms my heart.</p><p>I finally have a little bit of something that was in short supply the last couple of months: a little time. So within the next couple of days I&apos;ll post instructions on uploading files to the new site we can use for files, the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.microtonal.org">www.microtonal.org</a>. Yes, we&apos;ll have an easy-to-utilize 20mb of file space for sharing mp3s of new music, but I also wanted to send a sense of joy and encouragement; the nice part is I had just thought about this during the morning after I was loading out a van load of percussion from my last performances of 2001.</p><p>We will feature a &quot;Selected&quot; musical piece by a member of Making Microtonal Music on the front page of the forum. I will take the selected piece, convert it to RealAudio and stream it off the dedicated RealServer that is installed at Corporeal Meadows (<a href="http://www.corporeal.com">www.corporeal.com</a>). It ain&apos;t a competition, it ain&apos;t a wagering situation, it is just a way to let people who might wander in and wonder if we actually do anything - they&apos;ll be able to hear it for themselves!</p><p>I&apos;ll take new pieces, and if we have a month where activity is high I&apos;ll just rotate pieces so everyone gets time in the spotlight. If activity is slow, we&apos;ll keep one piece on the mantle for a couple of weeks, and when it starts getting stale the scream will go out for new music!</p><p>I&apos;ll post all the info when it&apos;s ready, and I hope it is one small way to be both stimulating and sharing at the same time. There is *no* reason to not harness the abilities we have in this new medium, and if anyone has any other thoughts, you know how to post to MMM...</p><p>Best to all,<br/>Jon</p></div>
