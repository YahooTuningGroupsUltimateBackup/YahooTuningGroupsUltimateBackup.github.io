Here&apos;s a picture that shows a selection of 12:</p><p><a href="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/twelve.jpg">http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/twelve.jpg</a></p><p>and here&apos;s a piece built from that selection:</p><p><a href="http://soundclick.com/share?songid=7607461">http://soundclick.com/share?songid=7607461</a></p><p>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=20715 href="#20715">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2009 5:33:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I uploaded the mp3 file for my newest piece to the group files directory, for those folks who don&apos;t want to go to SoundClick to get it. I also uploaded the CSound score file there, so folks can see as well as hear what is going on there.</p><p>I calculated the frequency of occurrance in this piece of the 12 pitches in the subset I chose:</p><p>Pitch class 25 occurred  45 times<br/>Pitch class 39 occurred 239 times<br/>Pitch class  0 occurred 242 times<br/>Pitch class 14 occurred 100 times<br/>Pitch class 28 occurred 118 times<br/>Pitch class 42 occurred  86 times<br/>Pitch class  3 occurred 134 times<br/>Pitch class 17 occurred 264 times<br/>Pitch class 31 occurred 154 times<br/>Pitch class 45 occurred 106 times<br/>Pitch class  6 occurred  53 times<br/>Pitch class 20 occurred  17 times</p><p>I just put these in the order of the minor thirds progression - hard to say what&apos;s best!</p><p>Jim</p></div>
