However I *did* have one question: two of them<br/>&gt; are, purportedly by the &quot;Fractal Tune Smithy&quot; and one is by *you* but<br/>&gt; all three seem somewhat &quot;algorithmic...&quot; How do you distinguish the<br/>&gt; author?? This is not meant in any kind of deprecating way, since it<br/>&gt; seems this kind of method is working well for this kind of music.</p><p>&gt; This definitely falls into the kind of &quot;automatic&quot; or &quot;algorithmic&quot;<br/>&gt; composition that Kraig Grady has been discussing... I haven&apos;t had<br/>&gt; time to comment on it before.</p><p>I wonder, ...</p><p>I do use a kind of passing tones approach while improvising so that<br/>is a similarity.</p><p>Also, some of the fractal tunes are based on musical phrases that one plays<br/>and fts makes into a fractal tune, and when I use the timing of the phrases<br/>in the fractal tunes to make the rhythm more interesting, then it would be<br/>in my timing of course, - I don&apos;t know if there is anything particular about<br/>that, but those ones could have some of the feel of the way I play things<br/>perhaps, if there is anything to that.</p><p>However, I certainly couldn&apos;t improvise an augmented canon, while on the other hand,<br/>FTS finds it easier to play one of those than anything else :-)</p><p>Robert.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2002 12:24:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2053">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2053</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do use a kind of passing tones approach while improvising so that<br/>&gt; is a similarity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, some of the fractal tunes are based on musical phrases that<br/>one plays and fts makes into a fractal tune, and when I use the<br/>timing of the phrases in the fractal tunes to make the rhythm more<br/>interesting, then it would be in my timing of course, -</p><p>***My guess is that you are actually *learning* your style from FTS!<br/>You&apos;ve been so involved in its construction and in the kind of music<br/>that it generates, that when it comes time to do your &quot;free&quot;<br/>improvisations, they sound like compositions of the composer &quot;Fractal<br/>Tune Smithy...&quot;</p><p>??</p><p>Just a guess...</p><p>JP</p></div>
