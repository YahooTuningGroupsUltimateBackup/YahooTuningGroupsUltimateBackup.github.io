At first I was put off by the synthesizer timbre with its beating conflicting with just intervals. But then I just relaxed and really enjoyed the notes. Wonderful notes. Is it the 12-24 overtones or something else?</p><p>I once built a small brass tubalong instrument using the 13th through 26th overtones of A @ 110 Hz. You played it by tossing it onto the ground, and all 14 notes would play simultaneously, making a nice difference tone in the bass.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am pleased to announce the first preview album of the World Harmony<br/>&gt; Project by Denny Genovese, Dave Hill, and Jules Siegle is available for<br/>&gt; your listening pleasure<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/0-hosted-albums/Forth_and_Back.html">http://micro.soonlabel.com/0-hosted-albums/Forth_and_Back.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div>
