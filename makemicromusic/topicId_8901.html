It is one of my staple scales now. I really<br/>think Gene is a wizard for figuring it out. When it is latticed, it seems<br/>hard to imagine how anyone could have missed it before he &apos;discovered&apos; it (I<br/>don&apos;t think it was known before Gene)--it has such a lovely symmetry to it on<br/>the lattice, and a nice balance of available dyads.</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>&gt; - Dave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron K.

Back in the days when La Monte&apos;s tunings were total secrets, sitting at Erv&apos;s kitchen table, I casually mentioned that the WTP had two tones out of sequence (where a key to the right had a lower pitch than the key to left). In a matter of seconds, Erv drew a lattice, and said:  &quot;is this it?&quot;  Of course it was, and then Erv went on to draw two or three variations on the theme, each with comments about advantages and disadvantages that were far from obvious.</p><p>(My little book on La Monte (1984) was not published because I had to go into fairly elaborate verbal contortions to get around his restrictions on describing the tunings. These appear to be gone since Gann published his PNM article, but that publication also killed any interest in my MS.

Personally I like music<br/>that transcends its components and particulars. I know a lot of folks<br/>prefer slow,unfolding tone stimuli when it comes to microtoanlity and<br/>I&apos;m aware that even a music as startlingly original and transpotive<br/>(to Partchland) as Harry Partch&apos;s has been criticized for promoting<br/>just intonation and then sending it all flying by at too rapid a clip<br/>to justify its usage. I understand but I don&apos;t agree. In fact, it&apos;s<br/>often been my experience that a lot of microcultists allow the<br/>demonstration of the new tones to unfold in so deliberate and<br/>unadorned a fashion that I feel as though I&apos;m in the presence of a<br/>musical &quot;Watch Spot run.&quot; Or,in the case of the<br/>repetitionists, &quot;Watch Spot run. Watch Spot run. Watch Spot run.&quot; Now<br/>I like monosyllable sentences as much as the next three-year-old, but<br/>I digress... obviously tastes differ, and everyone&apos;s mileage is going<br/>to vary given their perspective.</p><p>Another important thing,aside from the opinions of humans, is<br/>physical interface. Music tends to get made along the idiomatic lines<br/>of the instruments and technology at hand. For instance, I have a<br/>microtonal banjo, and the congenital character of the instrument<br/>doesn&apos;t really lend itself to slowly sustained unfoldings--this was<br/>also true of most of Partch&apos;s collection of plucked, strummed and<br/>struck micromakers. I also have a fujara, and its design and<br/>interface is as different from the microbanjo as the mouse&apos;s<br/>heartrate is from the elephant&apos;s. The technology of the banjo and the<br/>fujara suggest a metabolic makeup that would hardly recognize each<br/>other... but the mouse and the elephant coexist and us humans are<br/>crafty pantheists and stubborn creatures of habit ,and the music I<br/>make with the fujara is no less obviously my music than the music I<br/>make with the banjo.

Sibelius was a violinist who wrote some<br/>engaging<br/>&gt; piano pieces (right now I&apos;m learning the first Sonatina). And, you<br/>have<br/>&gt; composers who tend to write abstractly (Bach comes to mind,<br/>although it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; half-truth), and the lines work because they are conceived in a<br/>more-or-less<br/>&gt; monochromatic fashion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, I think all great music has a sense of transcending<br/>it &apos;components<br/>&gt; and particulars&apos;.....so I agree with that statement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Monday 21 February 2005 11:19 am, daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello David and everybody, just a couple random thoughts.....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think the way we feel about music is tied much tighter to our<br/>&gt; &gt; personal tastes than it is anything else.

Personally I like music<br/>&gt; that transcends its components and particulars. This is related to a theme that has recently floated through the new music blogosphere, started by Kyle Gann, who set up an opposition between new music that was tonal, repetitive, meditative, process-oriented and music with much complexity, dissonance and noise, identifying each with generations of composers making, on their own terms, progressive moves (this is a weak paraphrase, but it&apos;ll do).  I wrote a longer response to this elsewhere, but in short, it was that these characterizations were of surfaces, not of substance, and that any given surface texture can sustain content that is progressive/radical or conservative/reactionary;  by my terms, both Mumma and Glass were, in 1969, radicals, while Roy Harris and Wuorinen were reactionaries.  What the progressives/radicals have in common, whatever their surfaces, was the potential to tell us something new and substantial about music, its possibilities, its extent and limits, and perhaps even something about the world around that music. This surface fallacy is an old one. In many ways, the 4th and 7th symphonies of Sibelius are more deeply inventive than symphonic works of his more dissonant contemporaries.  And technical innovations, in themselves, are never a source of depth, but rather new means for articulating that depth.  (Innovation in orchestration came innevitably from opera, not from the symphony; the symphony was a form that was not about the orchestra, but about using the orchestra to articulate a form).</p><p>I just read something by Robert Bresson that relates, if you substitute &quot;music&quot; for &quot;film&quot;:  &quot;Your film&apos;s beauty will not be in the images (postcardism) but in the ineffable that they will disengage.&quot;</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=9124 href="#9124">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

I think my sound-track will be primarily neo-<br/>Monkian<br/>&gt; abstract<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tet jazz (unless anyone can point me to some tunings that do<br/>&gt; typical jazz<br/>&gt; &gt; chords as well as 12-tet does---by typical I mean some of the<br/>more<br/>&gt; dissonant<br/>&gt; &gt; types like altered chords, dominant sharp ninths, etc.). But in<br/>any<br/>&gt; event,<br/>&gt; &gt; jazz of some sort or other it will be...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not use 72-tet?  It will do everything 12-tet will and also<br/>allow<br/>&gt; you to do some really &quot;expressive intonation&quot; (e.g., with a choice<br/>of<br/>&gt; major/supermajor thirds that approximate 4:5, 64:81, 11:14, 7:9, or<br/>&gt; even 10:13) and 11-limit harmonies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>22-equal works great for altered chords (based on tritone<br/>substitution) and dominant sharp ninths. Mmm . . . tasty and a little<br/>extra consonant. But it&apos;s absolutely miserable for a 6/9 chord -- try<br/>it! Yuck. If you&apos;re willing to dump the diatonic scale and some of<br/>its native chords, I think you can come up with some good 22-equal<br/>jazz. Some people even think I&apos;ve done so . . .</p></div>
