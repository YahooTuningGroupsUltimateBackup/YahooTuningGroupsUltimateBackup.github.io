After you get the first line right, repeat it.<br/>Then find something that rhymes... sort of: &quot;Got a good woman with the<br/>meanest face in town. Yes, I got a good woman with the meanest face in<br/>town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher, and she weigh 500 pound.&quot;</p><p>4.The Blues is not about choice. You stuck in a ditch, you stuck in a<br/>ditch--ain&apos;t no way out.</p><p>5.Blues cars: Chevys, Fords, Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues<br/>don&apos;t travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues<br/>transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft<br/>and company motor pools ain&apos;t even in the running. Walkin&apos; plays a<br/>major part in the blues lifestyle. So does fixin&apos; to die.</p><p>6.Teenagers can&apos;t sing the Blues. They ain&apos;t fixin&apos; to die yet. Adults<br/>sing the Blues. In Blues, &quot;adulthood&quot; means being old enough to get<br/>the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.</p><p>7.Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place<br/>in Canada. Hard times in Minneapolis or Seattle is probably just<br/>clinical depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City are still the<br/>best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place<br/>that don&apos;t get rain.</p><p>8.A man with male pattern baldness ain&apos;t the blues. A woman with male<br/>pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cause you were skiing is not<br/>the blues. Breaking your leg &apos;cause a alligator be chompin&apos; on it is.</p><p><a href="http://9.You">9.You</a> can&apos;t have no Blues in a office or a shopping mall. The lighting<br/>is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.</p><p>10.Good&nbsp;places for the Blues:<br/>&nbsp;a. Highway<br/>&nbsp;b. Jailhouse<br/>&nbsp;c. An empty bed<br/>&nbsp;d. Bottom of a whiskey glass</p><p>11.Bad&nbsp;places for the Blues:<br/>&nbsp;a. Nordstrom&apos;s<br/>&nbsp;b. Gallery openings<br/>&nbsp;c. Ivy league institutions<br/>&nbsp;d. Golf courses</p><p><a href="http://12.No">12.No</a> one will believe it&apos;s the Blues if you wear a suit, &apos;less you<br/>happen to be a old ethnic person, and you slept in it.</p><p><a href="http://13.You">13.You</a> have the right to sing the Blues if:<br/>&nbsp;a. You older than dirt<br/>&nbsp;b. You blind<br/>&nbsp;c. You shot a man in Memphis<br/>&nbsp;d. You can&apos;t be satisfied</p><p><a href="http://14.You">14.You</a>&nbsp;don&apos;t&nbsp;have the right to sing the Blues if:<br/>&nbsp;a. You have all your teeth<br/>&nbsp;b. You were once blind but now can see<br/>&nbsp;c. The man in Memphis lived<br/>&nbsp;d. You have a pension fund</p><p>15.Blues is not a matter of color. It&apos;s a matter of bad luck. Tiger<br/>Woods cannot sing the blues. Sonny Liston could. Ugly white people<br/>also got a leg up on the blues.</p><p>16.If you ask for water and your darlin&apos; give you gasoline, it&apos;s the Blues</p><p>17.Other acceptable Blues beverages are:<br/>&nbsp;a. Cheap wine<br/>&nbsp;b. Whiskey or bourbon<br/>&nbsp;c. Muddy water<br/>&nbsp;d. Nasty black coffee</p><p>18.The following are NOT Blues beverages:<br/>&nbsp;a. Perrier<br/>&nbsp;b. Chardonnay<br/>&nbsp;c. Snapple<br/>&nbsp;d. Slim Fast</p><p>19.If death occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun shack, it&apos;s a Blues<br/>death. Stabbed in the back by a jealous lover is another Blues way to<br/>die. So is the electric chair, substance abuse and dying lonely on a<br/>broke-down cot. You can&apos;t have a Blues death if you die during a<br/>tennis match or while getting liposuction.</p><p>20.Some Blues names for women:<br/>&nbsp;a. Sadie<br/>&nbsp;b. Big Mama<br/>&nbsp;c. Bessie<br/>&nbsp;d. Fat River Dumpling</p><p>21.Some Blues names for men:<br/>&nbsp;a. Joe<br/>&nbsp;b. Willie<br/>&nbsp;c. Little Willie<br/>&nbsp;d. Big Willie</p><p>22.Persons with names like Michelle, Amber, Debbie, and Heather can&apos;t<br/>sing the Blues no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.</p><p>23.Make your own Blues name Starter Kit: a. name of physical infirmity<br/>(Blind, Cripple, Lame, etc.) b. first name (see above) plus name of<br/>fruit (Lemon, Lime, Melon, Kiwi, etc.) c. last name of President<br/>(Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore, etc.) For example: Blind Lime<br/>Jefferson, Jackleg Lemon Johnson or Cripple Kiwi Fillmore, etc. (Well,<br/>maybe not &quot;Kiwi.&quot;)</p><p>24.I don&apos;t care how tragic your life: if you own even one computer,<br/>you cannot sing the blues.</p><p>On Thu, Apr 7, 2011 at 12:54 PM, Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, folks, this is just my opinion(s) only, no offense meant, I&apos;m just simply trying to start a fun flame war, ok? ;)<br/>&gt; For my part, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily call it (blues) easy (nothing is easy if it&apos;s done well, it might only appear easy to those on the outside of it, or it might be easy once mastery has been achieved) but I would say I largely have lost whatever interest I may have had in it, perhaps because it may in fact be very difficult to not sound horribly cliched in it.<br/>&gt; And it&apos;s not because of the typical simple chord changes (although I must say, they do bore me to tears by now, being honest, even in the hands of whatever master player you wanna throw at me.)

It&apos;s not music that comes from the head, so you have to feel it...and if you don&apos;t, you&apos;re not gonna fool anyone who actually knows the blues.  But if you do feel it, it&apos;s as natural as breathing.  I&apos;m not a fan, mostly because I grew up in a small town with more blues bands than you can shake a stick at and cut my guitar-playing teeth jamming with more than a few of them.  I can &quot;feel&quot; the blues no problem, in fact I&apos;m an improv guy through and through--but I&apos;d much rather apply that approach in a way outside pentatonic scales and I-IV-V progressions, and I can&apos;t relate to the subject matter of most blues lyrics.  If you take away the basic blues formula, but keep the other stylistic traits--the rawness, the expressiveness, the &quot;from-the-gut&quot; emotiveness, that&apos;s when things get interesting.  I will say that there are a few bluesmen whose playing has really wowed me on occasion, though--I heard a Stevie Ray Vaughan live recording once and he played one of the most polyrhythmic microtonal solos I&apos;ve ever heard, really...dude was hitting all kinds of neutral intervals, playing quintuplets, septuplets, etc., as far out as anything Zappa ever did.  Wish I could find that recording, it was seriously amazing.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, folks, this is just my opinion(s) only, no offense meant, I&apos;m just<br/>&gt; simply trying to start a fun flame war, ok? ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For my part, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily call it (blues) easy (nothing is easy if<br/>&gt; it&apos;s done well, it might only appear easy to those on the outside of it, or<br/>&gt; it might be easy once mastery has been achieved) but I would say I largely<br/>&gt; have lost whatever interest I may have had in it, perhaps because it may in<br/>&gt; fact be very difficult to not sound horribly cliched in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And it&apos;s not because of the typical simple chord changes (although I must<br/>&gt; say, they do bore me to tears by now, being honest, even in the hands of<br/>&gt; whatever master player you wanna throw at me.)

Fingerstyle?<br/>&gt; &gt; Lotsa variety in blues, or any of the above mentioned American styles...and<br/>&gt; &gt; each one has it&apos;s own &quot;grease,&quot; if you will. But...over the years, I&apos;ve seen<br/>&gt; &gt; an attitude from folks that don&apos;t play or understand blues, that it is<br/>&gt; &gt; easy...perhaps because of the deceptive simplicity of it&apos;s structure...a<br/>&gt; &gt; zillion light years from true. Chris...you&apos;re a sincere cat, and good<br/>&gt; &gt; musician...but, if we ever get a chance to hang, we can do what the Chicago<br/>&gt; &gt; guys used to do, have a little &quot;head cuttin&quot; session, and see how easy blues<br/>&gt; &gt; is then...hell, we can even do some blues in 19 or 36 if you want..and<br/>&gt; &gt; Catler is doing blues in his 64 tone system, and getting great reviews.<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t know why you think it&apos;s easy, cause it&apos;s far far from that...best from<br/>&gt; &gt; sunny Denver...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microwstick.net">www.microwstick.net</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

You sound like this black friend of mine from decades gone by who didn&apos;t much like blues. He had this comedy album he loved, featuring Blind Melon Chitlin&apos;, the most authentic Delta blues artist ever, who didn&apos;t actually sing but just sort of moaned and fell out of his chair.</p><p>Not taking sides on the blues thing here...just a tale of yesterday.
