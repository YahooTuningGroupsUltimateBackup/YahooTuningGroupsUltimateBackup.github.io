I use two of them<br/>since each only gives independent polyphony of 8 voices.  This way,<br/>obviously, I have 16.  If I want to use chords, I have to use several<br/>voices on one channel, so that eats up the 16 total quite quickly.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to send a Scala tuning to the TX81Z.  Simply use<br/>the &quot;SEND/FILE&quot; command in Scala and use a .mid suffix.  That&apos;s all<br/>there is too it!  The file is saved someplace on your computer and<br/>then played with a sequencer into the TX81Z. Of course, the TX81Z<br/>must be selected in SET SYNTH.  (In the case of the TX81Z it&apos;s #101).</p><p>For the sequencer,  I use Digital Orchestrator Pro and the TX81Zs are<br/>hooked up to my computer by the use of the very flexible MIDISPORT<br/>4x4 that supplies MIDI input and output ports to all my software (and<br/>connects to the computer via a handy USB cable).  The tuning MIDI<br/>file must be played at a very slow tempo, say 16 beats per measure,<br/>in order to work.</p><p>One goes to the &quot;Edit Full Keyboard&quot; selection under &quot;Edit Micro<br/>Tune&quot; on the TX81Z and plays the .mid tuning file as tuned by Scala<br/>above.  A bunch of numbers whir on the Z&apos;s screen (that&apos;s the full<br/>keyboard tuning being implemented!) and then, when you select<br/>your &quot;performance mode&quot; patches, you are playing the microtonal<br/>scales through the Zs, provided you have set the patches<br/>to &quot;microtonality enabled.&quot;</p><p>From there, it&apos;s simply a matter of selecting the appropriate ports<br/>and channel in the sequencer (one TX81Z is on one port, the other on<br/>another Â– this you can easily set with the MIDISPORT selections).<br/>Each instrument should be on a separate channel, unless one wants<br/>chords in which case more than one voice is assigned to the same<br/>channel.  This is all done on the front panel of the Z.</p><p>From there, one just makes music using the sequencer.  The Digital<br/>Orchestrator Pro, like most sequencers, uses a &quot;piano roll&quot;<br/>notation.  Since there is microtonal tuning, the notes of the piano<br/>roll no longer correspond to 12-equal letter notes.  Therefore, if<br/>one wishes to notate a piece, there must be a &quot;transliteration&quot;<br/>process after composition so that the &quot;correct&quot; note on a staff is<br/>put down on music paper.  At this point, I do this manually, and use<br/>the Sibelius notation program to make the final written score.  I<br/>don&apos;t use Sibelius for playback of extensively microtonal scores,<br/>since it doesn&apos;t do a great job of it.  I only use that function in<br/>Sibelius for more conventional work in 12-equal which, quite frankly,<br/>I still do sometimes.</p><p>Once a microtonal piece is finished in the sequencer, it&apos;s time to<br/>record it.  For this I use SoundForge.  It&apos;s easy to just start up<br/>the SoundForge recording software, and then start the sequencer.<br/>Provided the recording levels are set correctly in the computer,<br/>SoundForge will record the input going into the soundcard from the<br/>sequencer with no problem.  No additional software or hardware is<br/>required.</p><p>Once the piece is recorded in SoundForge, one can add some post-<br/>processing, such as a bit of reverb and save the piece as a .wav file.</p><p>.wav files can, of course, be burned to audio CDs through a myriad of<br/>available software (I use &quot;Easy CD Creator).</p><p>The piece is then available to be played through any CD player for<br/>the (one might hope!) anxiously awaiting public... :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
