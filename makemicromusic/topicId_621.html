I just recently bought<br/>&gt; an Aardvark Direct Pro 96, which is multiport, and am very happy with<br/>&gt; the sound quality although its already too limiting with only one<br/>&gt; midi I/O.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Try www. <a href="http://audiomidi.com">audiomidi.com</a>, and ask for Miriam.

Great sound, very intuitive<br/>interface, and is fully compatible with ProTools.

The Motu 828 has been reported to have<br/>a lot of problems.  Motu support has also been a joke with all the<br/>Motu stuff I have owned.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
