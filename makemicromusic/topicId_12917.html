You know, sometimes there isn&apos;t a shortcut: if you want a particular kind of musical composition, you have to *compose* it. All this other stuff is just short-cuts and help tools.

For instance, I like to use tools like this, not for<br/>&gt; the bulk of what I do, or for even a big part of it, but<br/>&gt; sometimes just for some variety. My favorite way of generating<br/>&gt; some algorithmic building materials is KeyKit:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://nosuch.com/keykit/">http://nosuch.com/keykit/</a></p><p>Hmmm, downloaded that, but couldn&apos;t seem to<br/>get it going.  But based on your recommendation,<br/>Jon, I&apos;ll put it back on my list of toys to play with.<br/>Yes, as someone recently commented onlist we do<br/>indeed have an embarrassment of riches today.</p><p>&gt; Some of the tools are good for working up variations on single<br/>&gt; lines or background textures, and the nice thing is that it is a<br/>&gt; language-driven tool, meaning I can write new modules to do what<br/>&gt; I want. ...</p><p>That&apos;s what sounded so attractive about it.</p><p>&gt; ... Not to mention it is fun to play with. While all it does<br/>&gt; is drive midi data, with a tool like MidiOX you can run the<br/>&gt; output to any of your microtonal synths to hear the stuff the way<br/>&gt; you want it.</p><p>MidiOX ... some kind of MIDI Yoke?</p><p>Perhaps one could use a span of MidiOXen? ;-)</p><p>But seriously - the first time I tried using Hubi&apos;s<br/>Midi Loopback, I got terribly confused.

I&apos;d appreciate pointers from<br/>anyone on just what to expect with this kind of tool,<br/>and how to use them - perhaps there&apos;s a tutorial<br/>somewhere?</p><p>&gt; Bottom line is that the composition tools available to us are<br/>&gt; just that: tools. And even if one of them could really poop out a<br/>&gt; piece that was probably going to fool some people completely (and<br/>&gt; P. T.

(Some time ago it would be removed because security flaws.)</p><p>Then, it seems that Windows is really approaching desktop usability rapidly... :-)</p><p>&gt;&gt;Indeed, Windows can run many excellent pieces of software: emacs, &gt;&gt;octave, gcc, bash, latex, lyx, openoffice, mozilla, gimp, csound, &gt;&gt;puredata, zynaddsubfx, audacity, timidity, abcm2ps, abc2midi, tcl/tk, &gt;&gt;ghostscript... but I still think all these softwares perform better when &gt;&gt;running on GNU. ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; GNU or sourceforge apps ought to run better on Linux, since most of<br/>&gt; them are developed there.  Just as the thousands of commercial Windows<br/>&gt; apps run better in Windows.</p><p>That was just a somewhat ironic response to Gene, to show that software demands are not the same for all people. My interest on GNU was highly motivated by the appealling aboundance of software I would like to use but they were not available (or fully functional) on Windows. That time, almost all software I would like to use -- all them I can use now -- were free software and had no Windows versions (or the ports were not good).</p><p>&gt;&gt;Concerning to new hardware, GNU/Linux is likely to do provide support &gt;&gt;before Windows can do it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s highly debatable.</p><p>Yes, there are hardware factories with special interest on Linux, factories that publish technical specifications for software developpers, factories that make exclusivity contracts with OS vendors... in this latest case, of course, Windows can arrive first.</p><p>But after some (generally not long) time after hardware releasing, it is natural that free operating systems (most probably GNU/Linux, but not only) can provide support for many of the models, while proprietary OSes will stay tied to a smaller number of models.</p><p>&gt; One can write open source software on any platform.  When linux people<br/>&gt; tell me how great linux is, it usually comes back to the fact that<br/>&gt; they love building operating systems.  But I don&apos;t think operating<br/>&gt; systems are interesting.  It&apos;s what I can do when the OS is doing it&apos;s<br/>&gt; job and staying out of my way that interests me.</p><p>I am not interested on operative systems, and definitely I am not interested on building OSes. (This is one reason why I want do stick with Debian/DeMuDi for long years.)</p><p>But, if we are speaking on computer-aided composing, algorithmic composition, etc., one obvious premise is the ability to use a computer and can programming, assuming the environment provides some flexibility to develop and integrate music programs and the data they manipulate.</p><p>Even if the OS is not free software, many of the better and cheaper (often gratis) tools to acomplish computer music will be free software. First, we have free compilers for any imaginable programming language (compiled, interpreted, scripting, object-oriented, widgets, etc.). Second, interoperability between softwares requires openly specified data formats, some of them are not always well supported by certain proprietary softwares. Third, many free/open source software is multiplataform, making easy execute jobs on many machines (remarkable examples are csound and puredata). Then, we have community-shared codes for study or usage. Many computer musicians have a academic tradition of publishing synthesis/composition techniques, often resulting on important free/open source programs and knowledge sharing. In short, computer music and free/open source software have a long time relation, strengthened by the feasibility of complete free operating systems.</p><p>Today, there are several (GNU/Linux based) software distributions specially developped for musicians, for instance: DeMuDi, Planet CCRMA at Home and Musix. All the most representative music free software is included and integrated so that installing and configuring is not difficult (sometimes all things work even in a LiveCD session!).</p><p>I would like, finally, to recall that computer music -- in special algorithmic composition -- hardly can be made with closed software. The composer often needs to have full freedom to plan each detail of the computer program. Many comercial tools are designed for specific music genera and conceptions, thus limiting -- or driving -- the &quot;(cre)action&quot; of the users. Free/open source software can be far more flexible yet being easy to use.</p><p>As says a DeMuDi slogan, free art needs free tools.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson Lacerda</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Abra sua conta no Yahoo!

And beyond that, the non-transparent nature of installation,<br/>&gt; configuration, and running these things continue to keep them - for the most<br/>&gt; part - in the realm of people who love tweaking and hacking. I&apos;m not saying<br/>&gt; that is bad, but it isn&apos;t for everybody. In fact, it probably isn&apos;t for most<br/>&gt; people.</p><p>This isn&apos;t true at all. Newer versions of linux are as easy to install as<br/>Windows and considerably easier to maintain. They&apos;re certainly easier to<br/>install than 3.11 was. KDE and Gnome {and several other desktops} are as good<br/>or better than the commercial systems {KDE consistently scores at the top of<br/>the polls as far as usability goes}. Rosegarden 4, Snd, Audacity, etc, etc are<br/>as usable as anything on Windows, etc. If you use a pre-configured system you<br/>can simply download and install any of the multimedia aps with apps and be<br/>going within a few minutes. {If you&apos;re running the right hardware} There is<br/>Windows software that requires and enables &quot;hacking&quot; just as much as anything<br/>in linux.</p><p>What is a real problem is the lack of support for applications that people<br/>have used for years {Sonar, Cubase, After Effects, Photoshop, {to say nothing<br/>of &quot;essential&quot; applications like Dreamweaver. ...Bless it&apos;s little bitmapped<br/>heart.}, etc} and don&apos;t want to switch from as well as for technologies like<br/>VST {though that&apos;s changing}. Windows is not really about Windows. It&apos;s about<br/>the shrinkwrapped apps that run on it that you have to know in order to get a<br/>job or to maintain compatibility with the rest of the world.</p><p>Personally, I think Xara is one of the best vector editors going. I&apos;ve never<br/>yet seen a job listing that asked for it. No one wants to have to deal with<br/>multiple learning curves and things like Illustrator and Photoshop and Word<br/>have become labelled &quot;the best&quot; in a huge part of the public psyche. It&apos;s what<br/>they teach in school, it&apos;s what you&apos;ll use at work and it probably has the<br/>best third party support as far as plugins and extensions go. What would any<br/>of the shrinkwrapped apps be without things like vst or photoshop plugins?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t help that you have the narrow minded set out there that would<br/>rather die than use anything but a mac {With the right bitmaps you could have<br/>something very like OSX in linux fairly easily} and that insist that anything<br/>not done in Photoshop or Cubase {or Logic} is somehow inferior. I think the<br/>thing really constraining the software world is the marketing that&apos;s ingrained<br/>into society&apos;s psyche and re-inforced constantly by {less than knowledgeable}<br/>users. How many of the Mac supremacists that you know have actually used<br/>Windows or linux to say nothing of Oberon or UNIX or OS2, z/OS or Solaris? How<br/>many of them do you think will be using Croquet {There&apos;s a developr&apos;s release<br/>available for all three major platforms<br/><a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/Croquet_Technologies/downloads.html#">http://www.opencroquet.org/Croquet_Technologies/downloads.html#</a> }? How many of<br/>them do you think would attempt it with an open mind and without turning up<br/>their noses? Photoshop is Photoshop whether it&apos;s running on Windows, Macs or<br/>in KDE under Wine.</p><p>I use Windows XP because it&apos;s an excellent system and because my considerable<br/>investment in software requires it to run. I&apos;d love to run linux instead but<br/>everything I do gets done in applications that require Windows.</p><p>That said... my next upgrade to Sonar will probably be to Ableton Live. Not<br/>because I find Sonar to be lacking in any way... because I think that Live has<br/>a lot of features that I can use whereas Sonar has a lot of features that I<br/>don&apos;t. {Besides that...

Linux, especially nowadays, is easy to install<br/>and maintain, and is *extremely* stable when running. The commercial<br/>vs. open source arguments are dead when you consider the maturity of<br/>projects like WINE. And, low-latency audio, something musicians should<br/>be really concerned about, is actually better on Linux than any other<br/>platform. Linux audio users routinely report &lt;2ms latencies, something<br/>Windows and Mac users can only dream of.</p><p>OTOH, Windows and Mac OS-X offer nothing but headaches with things<br/>like viruses and security issues. Not to mention the API of both,<br/>should one want to develop an app (we know you don&apos;t Jon, but that<br/>doesn&apos;t mean you speak for all) is extremely ugly and<br/>counter-intuitive. *nix&apos;s great innovation, which is woefully absent<br/>in the others, is device files--hardware can be written to and read<br/>just like a normal file--brilliant concept. Windows has &apos;COMM ports&apos;<br/>extremely ugly and hard to use, and from what I&apos;ve seen, evil Apple<br/>has destroyed the typical *nix file structure, and doesn&apos;t have a /dev<br/>directory---apparantly they in their infinite wisdom have decided that<br/>it was of no use to anyone. Apple also feels that their typical user<br/>is a complete idiot, and doesn&apos;t want to ever write software or roll<br/>up their sleeves. Their company image sort of icks me out.</p><p>I&apos;d take Linux anyday over any other OS---and Carl, you are absolutely<br/>wrong about it&apos;s stability---Linux was years ahead of windoze in this<br/>area---my wife had to reboot her machine every day just about, after<br/>crashing here and there, while as long ago as 1998 I was running a<br/>Slackware box that tayed up for months.
