Here an outstanding model is Jacky Ligon, whose mastery<br/>of timbre and penchant for complex JI has produced both beautiful music<br/>(sometimes mixing electronic and acoustical sounds) and fascinating<br/>theory.</p><p>While I can&apos;t speak for Jon, I can say that an MMM avoiding the<br/>contention, unconstructive conflict, and discouraging comparisons would be<br/>a much more pleasant place for me.</p><p>Jon, from what I know of your values, I might guess that part of the<br/>dilemma for you is, as moderator, taking the role of List Mom in a place<br/>where incivility and contention seem difficult to control, and<br/>participating seems a kind of cooperation with a state of affairs that we<br/>set out specifically to avoid.</p><p>Thus if this forum is to succeed, we need a policy of concerted avoidance<br/>of this style of conflict based on a strong agreement of the group, and<br/>noncooperation with such unconstructive discussions.</p><p>The history of European music, at least, shows that e-mail communication<br/>is hardly the first arena of this kind of style of conflict, although some<br/>aspects of e-mail communication might tend both to loosen inhibitions<br/>against verbal intemperance or even abuse while making misunderstandings<br/>of intended meaning or tone more likely, sadly sometimes with an<br/>escalating effect.</p><p>Thus I would suggest that if we want to negotiate a new basis for MMM --<br/>wherever hosted -- that we commit ourselves to civility and musicmaking as<br/>the center of our activities. It means especially that we refrain from<br/>theorizing in negative or discouraging ways about tuning systems that we<br/>_don&apos;t_ use.</p><p>That is, if someone here expresses an interest in creating some music in<br/>tuning system M, I&apos;d see it quite appropriate to lend encouragement and to<br/>explain how I use tuning system M -- ideally with some music, or at least<br/>some kind of notated example(s).</p><p>However, I&apos;d urge that discussions on why _not_ to use tuning system M, or<br/>what tuning others might prefer, be directed elsewhere -- except, of<br/>course, that everyone is encouraged to post music and share their<br/>explanations about it in _any_ desired tuning.</p><p>That means that we would need a strong communal commitment as part of the<br/>shared culture of this group to engage in concerted nonviolent resistance<br/>against any incursion of unconstructive or uncivil &quot;tuning wars&quot; into this<br/>forum.</p><p>The question is whether we can achieve this, and if so, how.</p><p>Since the original MMM guidelines that Jon has often mentioned seem quite<br/>adequate to me, I would invite people in this community who want to<br/>maintain MMM as a forum in keeping with those guidelines express our<br/>commitment to do so here.</p><p>I would like to affirm this commitment, and to urge that we make MMM a<br/>showcase of diversity where people doing the most adventurous, artful,<br/>and vulnerable kinds of musicmaking can feel more at home.</p><p>People can be hurt by a culture of bellicosity -- especially, from an MMM<br/>standpoint, people who are making &quot;far out&quot; music (even by &quot;microtonal<br/>community&quot; standards) and who need encouragement.</p><p>Whatever the mix of music and theory that prevails here, I&apos;d to like to<br/>see MMM as a refuge from bellicosity and a refuge for new or<br/>unconventional music and theory alike.</p><p>Jon, I&apos;m not sure how well this answers your concerns, and I warmly invite<br/>your feedback as someone who has struggled with the less positive aspects<br/>of what has been going on here for too long.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>George D.

I warmly applaud your decision to pass on your<br/>responsibility to others, and while this has been a difficult time<br/>for you, you can rest assured that it has served as a wake-up call<br/>for the rest of us that will make the task of your successors a much<br/>less difficult one.</p><p>Also, I want to let you know I haven&apos;t forgotten that I owe you a<br/>reply to a discussion about the relationship of musical styles to<br/>microtonality:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54146">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54146</a><br/>which I could not help thinking about when I posted this yesterday:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54747">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/54747</a></p><p>While both of these messages are intimately connected with practical<br/>aspects of &quot;making microtonal music&quot; rather than theory, they are<br/>concerned with that topic primarily in a general sense and are apt to<br/>lead to a lively (and, if one is not careful, heated) debate about<br/>the merits (or lack thereof) of certain musical styles.  I would<br/>conclude, therefore, that (even if there is the slightest doubt) such<br/>discussions should be kept on the main list, with a short notice and<br/>link posted here for those who might be interested in following<br/>and/or responding.</p><p>If we focus the discussion here on specific compositions submitted by<br/>list participants and confine our more general comments to<br/>information that will be useful to others in their creation and/or<br/>understanding of such compositions, then I think that this would go a<br/>long way toward fulfilling the intent of making this a place where we<br/>can be comfortable in sharing our musical efforts, ideas, and dreams.</p><p>Music! music!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2004 1:07:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thus I would suggest that if we want to negotiate a new basis for MMM --<br/>&gt; wherever hosted -- that we commit ourselves to civility and<br/>musicmaking as<br/>&gt; the center of our activities.
