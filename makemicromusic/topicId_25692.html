Punch in &quot;1200&quot;.  Divide by 13.  The number you get is one step of 13-EDO in cents.  Add it to itself to get successive steps of 13-EDO.  Works with any equal division.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Kasper &lt;michael_kspr@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Guys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can anyone give me the cents for 13 EDO and other lower in # symmetrical EDO&apos;s<br/>&gt; as well as the cents for 53 EDO.
