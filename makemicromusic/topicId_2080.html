However, not having the means to listen to MIDI files or audio<br/>files on the Web -- although I can create the former, and with the<br/>help of generous people such as Jacky Ligon and a number of others who<br/>have most generously offered their assistance also the latter -- I had<br/>until recently experienced only his words, but not his music itself.</p><p>That music is indeed copious and diverse, showing a love of many world<br/>traditions and the ability, also featured by xenharmonicists such as<br/>Jacky Ligon and Mary Beth Ackerley, to bring them together in a<br/>special kind of synthesis. My initial impressions of the CD he sent me<br/>as a kind of Christmas and New Year&apos;s gift can only hint at the beauty<br/>of his achievements, which, happily, many of you can hear in forums<br/>such as this, or on his Web site:</p><p>        <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>The opening piece on the CD I received is in a tuning called<br/>Sesquisexta, one in which two 12-note Pythagorean chains of fifths are<br/>placed at a pure 7:6 apart. Robert&apos;s piece in this scale is a chant, a<br/>statement of pure melody, and one most eloquent. Having seen his<br/>discussion of this piece, maybe in this forum, I recalled that there<br/>was a 64:63 comma shift -- but found myself simply taking in the<br/>eloquent flow of the music.</p><p>Maybe this ties in with Jon Szanto&apos;s observation that one can listen<br/>for &quot;microtonality&quot; or simply for music, and that the latter approach<br/>has its own virtues. One thing I can say is that it&apos;s a delight to see<br/>and hear the Sesquisexta tuning being used in ways that only other<br/>musicians can come up with, and to reminded that pure melody has its<br/>own possibilities. Robert&apos;s piece, like a Gregorian chant or an<br/>English folk melody of the kind that Ralph Vaughan Williams might set,<br/>is a welcome reminder of this point for those of us often enamoured of<br/>polyphony and counterpoint.</p><p>The next piece, &quot;2001: A MOS Odyssey&quot; is subtitlted &quot;One of Jacky<br/>Ligon&apos;s scales,&quot; and the music seems nicely to fit the title, with a<br/>bit of _Switched-on Bach_ feeling. Since Wendy Carlos was producing<br/>the original _Switched on Bach_ around the same epoch that produced<br/>the movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_, this association was a pleasant<br/>one. Carlos herself has become an advocate through music as well as<br/>words of the movement to liberate not only synthesized sound, but the<br/>tuning systems in which it can operate.</p><p>The third piece, an excursion in David Canfield&apos;s 13-limit tuning with<br/>12 notes, brought various images and associations: a snatch of<br/>pentatonic, maybe a bit of Schoenberg, and then a wonderful melody<br/>which seemed to me either &quot;raga-like&quot; or &quot;Arabic.&quot; Robert shows that<br/>&quot;JI&quot; music can mean many things, with the structure of the scale<br/>itself as a starting point rather than a definition of style.</p><p>Now we come to something really exquisite, an improvisation or<br/>improvisation-like piece in a Chopi scale which sounded to me as if it<br/>could have been taken from a recording of a traditional performance --<br/>in my view, the highest compliment. There are beautiful fifths and<br/>fourths, with a xylophone-like timbre: this is world-class music,<br/>which makes me intensely interested in the Chopi tradition. I hope<br/>that this piece will take an honored place in our global village,<br/>serving as a bridge of understanding and encouraging a greater<br/>awareness in our xenharmonic community and elsewhere of the pluralism<br/>of world musics and the need to appreciate and cherish this variety.<br/>Here Robert&apos;s Web site includes some links to lots of information about<br/>the Chopi people of Southern Mozambique and their music.</p><p>The next piece is a delightful journey from medieval to Baroque, at<br/>least as I hear it, in Dan Stearn&apos;s diatonic scale in 20-EDO. Here we<br/>can savor the ability of a strikingly &quot;new&quot; tuning to evoke some<br/>European history -- not its only ability, as Dan Stearn reminds us in<br/>observing that 20-EDO also contains within itself 5-EDO, a rough<br/>approximation of the slendro scale of gamelan.</p><p>A piece in Graham Breed&apos;s blues scale has lots of delicious fifths and<br/>fourths, and a pentatonic feeling -- a kind of music that catches my<br/>ear both on this CD, and also in live performances such as one at a<br/>bookstore I was browsing at maybe a couple of years ago. The ensemble<br/>there was playing some kind of jazz or the like, which I rather<br/>passively accepted as &quot;background&quot; -- but when they started playing<br/>those fifths and fourths, I took enrapt notice. Robert&apos;s piece, also,<br/>deserves this kind of notice: I&apos;m not sure that Graham Breed&apos;s music<br/>in the same scale would sound anything like this, and that&apos;s the point<br/>of having not only many scales, but many musicians.</p><p>The eighth piece is another exquisite improvisation in the Chopi<br/>scale, one happily extended as a traditional musicmaking session might<br/>be. Some of the figures are a bit like Chinese music, or the music of<br/>Southeast Asia I often listened to about 30 years ago. Such a piece<br/>suggests to me an ongoing project: to produce CD&apos;s or other recordings<br/>showcasing both traditional world musics and some music using<br/>nontraditional sound generation to arrive at similar scales and<br/>styles. Maybe &quot;Xenharmonics Old and New&quot; could be one theme, if that&apos;s<br/>the right statement: intonational diversity is a global reality, and<br/>there&apos;s a need to honor its many traditions, which have themselves<br/>evolved and maintained their integrity despite sometimes most daunting<br/>crises both for the traditions and the cultures which have created<br/>them.</p><p>The ninth piece, &quot;Octany Lullaby,&quot; is a bit like a music box, maybe a<br/>curious metaphor for the Combination Product Set (CPS) of Erv Wilson;<br/>my notes say: &quot;Kind of like 18th-19th century, but different.&quot; What I<br/>heard as an allusion to the Classic-Romantic eras in Europe isn&apos;t the<br/>only item on this agenda, however: I also heard what sounded like a<br/>6:8:9 sonority, common in many world musics ranging from Georgia and<br/>medieval France to Malaysia (which might be described in one way as<br/>the fifth and fourth above the lowest note).</p><p>The tenth, &quot;Twilight Bells,&quot; has a different mood which I described in<br/>my notes as &quot;Setharean,&quot; recalling the customized timbres of William<br/>Sethares often tailored to a specific scale, or vice versa; the timbre<br/>is realized in a piece with neat rhythms.</p><p>The eleventh, &quot;Andante in Quarter-Comma Meantone,&quot; uses a tuning I<br/>often favor for 16th-century European styles in a somewhat later kind<br/>of genre, &quot;rather like Bach or Scarlatti?&quot; according to my notes, when<br/>meantone was still the norm for much organ music, for example. Like<br/>much Baroque music, the texture is filled with active melodic themes,<br/>and this electronic rendition includes some neat &quot;winds&quot; in its<br/>virtual ensemble.</p><p>The next four items (12-15) are the four movements of a &quot;7-tet trio&quot;<br/>(or 7-EDO, in the Monzian style). The opening portion includes some<br/>fifths, and pleasant stringlike timbres with a &quot;fiddle&quot; sound, and<br/>what I describe in my notes as a &quot;glissando kind effect almost.&quot;<br/>The music builds to what I noted as &quot;more discrete patterns,&quot; with an<br/>engaging rhythmic counterpoint in the final movement.</p><p>Item 16, &quot;17-tet hurdy-gurdy player,&quot; is gorgeous in its somewhat<br/>pentatonic style; while the CD includes only part of the piece because<br/>of a technical complication, that was enough to let me know that this<br/>masterpiece and the Chopi scale pieces are my favorites. Again, as an<br/>enthusiastic for 17-tET/EDO and unequal 17-note well-temperaments or<br/>&quot;circles&quot; of various kinds, I am delighted to hear Robert making the<br/>most vigorous advocacy possible: music that says it all, in a way that<br/>reflects his special musicianship and imagination.</p><p>Item 17, an improvisation in 13-tET/EDO with diminished sevenths, is<br/>quite different -- but maybe, like some other pieces on this CD, a bit<br/>Baroque -- or could it be Near-Eastern? This is another side to<br/>13-EDO, which along with the music of xenharmonicists such as William<br/>Sethares shows the musical beauty to be found in this often<br/>undervalued and too often unknown tuning. As someone who has<br/>improvised neo-Gothic music in this same scale, I can say from the<br/>experience both of playing and of listening to Robert&apos;s piece that<br/>these scales open the way to creativity, inviting odysseys that may<br/>take divergent paths each lending its own allure to a system such as<br/>13-EDO.</p><p>Item 18, in &quot;Jacky Ligon&apos;s golden meantone non-octave scale,&quot; sounded<br/>&quot;Bluesy&quot; to me, with some percussion. There&apos;s been a great deal of<br/>interest in nonoctave (or sometimes stretched/compressed octave)<br/>scales in our tuning forums, and also in Jacky Ligon&apos;s electronic<br/>journal TMA available on the Internet; Robert shows that such scales<br/>can be used for music at once not too unfamiliar, and yet new. I&apos;d be<br/>ver interested to hear what he might come up with in something like<br/>the Bohlen-Pierce scale.</p><p>Item 19 lives up to its name, &quot;Jacob Van Eyck&apos;s Boffons with zany<br/>percussion arrangement.&quot; This has a catchingly jazzy flavor, and<br/>indeed is a 21st-century reprise of a kind of 17th-century Netherlands<br/>jazz (if I have my chronology of Van Eyck right): theme and<br/>variations, an artform also expressed in much Spanish and English<br/>music, for example, of the 16th and early 17th centuries. This could<br/>be a Carlos album, _Switched-On Van Eyck_, and although this era is a<br/>bit &quot;modern&quot; for me &lt;grin&gt;, I delight in the &quot;modernism&quot; of Monteverdi<br/>and Frescobaldi, and would love to hear more of this.</p><p>Item 20, &quot;Golden ratio &apos;cello fractal tune&quot; is slightly truncated, but<br/>the portion on the CD includes an engaging string-like timbre and a<br/>musical moment which seemed a bit &quot;Japanese&quot; to me.</p><p>Item 21, &quot;Improvisation in Werckmeister III,&quot; has fifths and fourths<br/>in what I described in my notes as a &quot;multicultural&quot; style, reminding<br/>us again that an 18th-century European tuning isn&apos;t limited to<br/>18th-century European styles. The many pure fifths of Werckmeister III<br/>make it, in my view, from one perspective a partly &quot;just&quot; tuning<br/>despite its place also as representing the essence of temperament in<br/>one historical manifestation, and I&apos;d like to hear more global<br/>excursions of this kind.</p><p>Item 22, &quot;African-style complex rhythms,&quot; is a study in percussion,<br/>focusing on meter as the opening piece focuses on melody.</p><p>Item 23, &quot;Atmospheric polyrhythms,&quot; came with a very thoughtful<br/>advisory from Robert, taking note of my sensitivity to loud sounds: he<br/>cautioned me that this has some high volume levels. Accordingly,<br/>following the rules of audio safety, I turned my amplifier to the<br/>lowest volume for this piece -- avoiding any problem, and finding that<br/>he had offered lots of sounds and patterns. Others might want to<br/>adjust the volume to taste with due caution; I&apos;d add that there are<br/>some great pieces of William Sethares, also, where percussive timbres<br/>made me a bit cautious about volume.</p><p>Anyway, Robert, you&apos;ve shown that our community has already produced<br/>some fine music deserving notice as music, however interested or<br/>otherwise people may be in the fine details of &quot;microtonality&quot; -- and<br/>reminded us that many cultures have been doing so for uncounted ages.<br/>Thank you for this special gift, which has also given me the<br/>opportunity better to appreciate what you&apos;ve made available on this<br/>forum and elsewhere via the Internet.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=2081 href="#2081">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2002 2:43:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Robert!&quot; (he shouted publically),</p><p>&quot;Where and how can anyone besides Margo get a copy of your CD?&quot;</p><p>...and the story continued from there...</p></div><h3><a id=2093 href="#2093">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2002 12:24:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Thanks for the wonderful review of my cd.</p><p>Looks like everyone is wanting copies now.<br/>It&apos;s interesting that you liked the Chopi scale<br/>ones as that&apos;s also one I part. want to learn more<br/>about.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2094 href="#2094">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2002 12:25:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>&gt; &quot;Where and how can anyone besides Margo get a copy of your CD?&quot;</p><p>I can do you a copy, or anyone else on this list for that matter.<br/>I&apos;ve got this very fast new cd writer (16 times write for CD - R) so<br/>I could do a few in no time.</p><p>It&apos;s fast because I got it (as my 1st cd writer) just a couple of months ago.</p><p>I see you&apos;ve just posted to the list offering to do the cds for me.</p><p>I wonder, maybe since my cd writer is fast, I could do the cds here<br/>and send them all to you in a bunch to send on to everyone?<br/>Or you could do some too, whatever.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2097 href="#2097">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
