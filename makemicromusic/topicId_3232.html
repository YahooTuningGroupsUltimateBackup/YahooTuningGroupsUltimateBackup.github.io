Import this midi file into<br/>your<br/>&gt; midi sequencer - like Cakewalk Sonar, Cubase, etc - slow the tempo<br/>&gt; down on the sequencer, and play the file to your board. This works<br/>&gt; without fail every time for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L</p><p>***I wish Manuel would develop tuning support for the Proteus 2000.<br/>I don&apos;t believe he has that yet.
