For some time I&apos;ve been working on a choir piece, and I have been using stretched meantone for it&apos;s midi realization. Now it seems that the director of my choir is going to let us sing it once or twice so that I can hear what it sounds like when a real choir sings it, which I&apos;m really happy about.</p><p>My song includes otonal tetrads. For example CEGA# in the key of F. That A# was a bit too out there for my choir director so he requested I change it to Bb. I&apos;m going to do that since I&apos;m happy enough already that I will hear the choir sing it, and I think/hope the singers will be clever enough to adjust the intonation.</p><p>For fun when changing the enharmonic spelling I listened to the resulting midi file. It of course sounded worse. The 7th was way too sharp. Still it was acceptable. Then I got the idea that maybe 12edo would be a better compromise since the 7th would be a little flatter and closer to a 7/4. So I retuned the midi file to 12edo. Now the interesting and disturbing experience I had: Hearing it in 12edo made me feel sick. The notes and chords all sounded sour and out of tune. It sounded as if they were mocking my song.</p><p>I wonder if people felt the same when the shift was made from mean/well temperament to equal temperament.</p><p>I also wonder: Had I written this song in 12edo from start to end, would I have been happy with the result? Would I even have written the same song? Is this especially a problem with computer/midi realizations of music?</p><p>/ Magnus</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2006 10:57:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;My song includes otonal tetrads.

Maybe I didn&apos;t present it really well. I think the main reason he wants the enharmonic notes &quot;fixed&quot; is that he doesn&apos;t want the singers to be confused. It will be interesting to see if the sopranos will sing a subminor 7th or not... They tend to be sharp on the major thirds so I certainly can&apos;t count on it. The biggest problem I can see is if they remember the Bb they sang two measures ago and sing that instead of the A# that fits harmonically. Different spellings would make them aware of the necessary intonation changes.</p><p>-Magnus</p><p>On Wed, 20 Sep 2006, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; My song includes otonal tetrads.

In a way I like when the piano is widely out of tune instead of perfect 12tet, because there are three strings for each key and at least one of them will have to concord with the other tones!

The<br/>&quot;don&apos;t use parallel 5ths or octaves and you should avoid parallel<br/>4ths&quot; rule was because of the jarring strength of those intervals,<br/>when compared to the &quot;gentleness&quot; of parallel 3rd or 6ths, especially<br/>in sweetly-thirded meantone. It stuck out a lot when you did it (the<br/>theorists started the litany: &quot;don&apos;t do this, don&apos;t do that, my god&quot;).<br/>Much more so than under 12TET, so that &quot;rules&quot; don&apos;t make as much<br/>sense as they once did. But, if you are going to back-step to the old<br/>ways, then &quot;the rules&quot; once again become necessary, unless you don&apos;t<br/>care that your carefully crafted piece with carefully crafted tunings<br/>sounds woefully out of tune in places. Or having overwhelmingly<br/>jarring consonances cropping up here and there.</p><p>Once 12TET came in, and the intervals equaled out, the jarringness<br/>became less apparent, and so we don&apos;t notice them these days. It&apos;s<br/>really funny in theory/history classes to have the professor say<br/>things like &quot;yes, this interval was considered dissonant&quot; while<br/>playing a 4th on a 12TET piano, which sounds perfectly acceptable,<br/>leading to the ignorance-of-the-ancients belief society meetings at<br/>the local bar. Hard to demonstrate the atrocities of a wolf tone if<br/>you can&apos;t really play it.</p><p>As 12TET became accepted because of keyboardists who wanted to play<br/>something other than 3-chords-and-loud-in-C-major, the rules that<br/>dictated harmonic/melodic/contrapuntal motion under previous tuning<br/>systems (like just, or mean or pythagorean) became less and less<br/>relevant until 12-tone came along and alienated the ivory tower from<br/>the rest of us even more than it had before the advent of the<br/>recording industry.</p><p>Certainly, it helps for us meager anarchists to know the rules we are<br/>breaking, so we can break them even more effectively. But hey, even I<br/>can&apos;t know all I&apos;m purported to know.......</p><p>So keep at it. And don&apos;t let any of the rest of us write your music.</p><p>-bjc</p></div>
