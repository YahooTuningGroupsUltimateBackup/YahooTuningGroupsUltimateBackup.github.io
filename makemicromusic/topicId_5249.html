I don&apos;t know<br/>what the future plans are, but Big Tick knows that there are tons of these<br/>old patches that people want to use.</p><p>I have made some Rhino patches by hand-copying my old TX802 patches --<br/>i.e., looking at the algorithms &amp; FM settings and copying them to the Rhino<br/>oscillators &amp; envelopes -- and the results are OK. If you tweak them up to<br/>take advantage of Rhino&apos;s better envelopes, etc, you can do better, and<br/>get something that sounds close to the original. And this is less effort<br/>than dreaming up an entirely new patch. But there isn&apos;t any import utility<br/>at this time.</p><p>Rhino does implement two separate FM models, the &quot;linear&quot; and<br/>&quot;exponential&quot;. Rhino native is linear, Yamaha model is exponential. And<br/>this seems to work fine to set exponential mode when you&apos;re trying to<br/>emulate a Yamaha patch. The other thing to watch out for is that Rhino has<br/>no fixed &quot;LFO&quot; for vibrato with envelope like the Yamaha synths. Rhino has<br/>a &quot;global pitch&quot; envelope that you can hand-tweak to do whatever LFO you<br/>desire; and oscillators can cycle interestingly in their sustain portions.<br/>It&apos;s a bit harder to use than the Yamaha LFO model for vibrato, but once<br/>you get the hang of it, it is very flexible; and Rhino comes with many<br/>pre-set envelopes for your simple vibrato, etc. The depth can be modulated<br/>by velocity, etc, etc.</p><p>Also, I have found that if you emulate old DX or TX patches, which<br/>typically use all 6 oscillators (sine only), the voices are less efficient;<br/>they take more CPU than if you program up a similar sound from scratch in<br/>Rhino. You can do better with fewer oscillators in Rhino, by taking<br/>advantage of additive waveforms and other built-in facilities.</p><p>&gt; Got it. And I have no shortage of perc sounds... :) It&apos;s my living.</p><p>Cool... I usually don&apos;t use much percussion because I don&apos;t really like<br/>boom-boom pop music drums; or shall we say, it&apos;s not my thing. I<br/>occasionally use some percussive accenting, etc, as you heard in this<br/>piece. I&apos;m always on the lookout for good percussion sounds that I can use<br/>without thinking I&apos;m ripping someone else off... so I decided to just make<br/>my own from household items! No worries about copyright there.</p><p>&gt; Last question: are you still working in Finale and then playing the score<br/>&gt; with midi, or was this a sequenced piece?</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m an old-school kinda guy. This is scored in Finale and played back<br/>through Finale. I can&apos;t work with piano roll or that kind of thing. Finale<br/>works really well for me. I just got the 2004 upgrade, and it has this<br/>&quot;human playback&quot; mode that is really pretty darn good at doing an<br/>expressive rendition. But to use it to advantage, I will have to modify my<br/>way of working a bit. Currently I tweak the MIDI data and tempos by hand in<br/>Finale using very spare score markings, but I would have to start using<br/>more consistent dynamic markings, hairpins, cresc/decresc, etc in the score<br/>so that the human playback module can &quot;read&quot; them out of the score. The<br/>&quot;human playback&quot; mode ignores the hand-tweaked MIDI data... kind of<br/>unfortunate. But on the other hand, it knows how to do a decent reading of<br/>an orchestral score for expressive rendition.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=5256 href="#5256">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2003 5:53:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul (Erlich), thanks for the kind comments!</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=5268 href="#5268">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2003 11:05:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_5249.html#5255">/makemicromusic/topicId_5249.html#5255</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I&apos;m an old-school kinda guy.
