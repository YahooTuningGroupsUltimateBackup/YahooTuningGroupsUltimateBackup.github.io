(again I mean mainly<br/>&gt; Carl)</p><p>   Marcel, it&apos;s obviously not just you Carl seems to annoy for the sake of<br/>annoying.   IMVHO, there is nothing wrong with talking about math in music, so<br/>long as people do not use it as a tool to smack aspiring microtonalists in the<br/>face and say &quot;If you don&apos;t agree with this theory, it shows you are<br/>dumb/uneducated or unable to learn microtonallity well and should give up trying<br/>to make or understand microtonal scales&quot; (paraphrased).</p><p>    Carl (and maybe 1 other or so on the tuning list) has actually made said<br/>statement to me and, for my successful IE well received scales, said &quot;that<br/>doesn&apos;t mean you have learned anything...monkeys can make good scales!&quot; and said<br/>similar about my music IE &quot;you can make good microtonal music yet have no reason<br/>to be respected for knowledge of microtonallity.  Sure, he claimed the context<br/>was &quot;good composition can take place under even a terrible scale&quot;...but, come<br/>on, can you believe that?<br/>    This is coming from myself as someone who has been on the list for years and<br/>makes at least one new, rather complex, composition per month IE I put forth<br/>tremendous effort rather Carl credits it or not.</p><p>   Right now, in fact, I&apos;m working on my Untwelve competition entry...but I&apos;m<br/>positive if it places in the competition (according to his past actions), Carl<br/>will try his utmost to claim I cheated somehow and spew out some long<br/>explanation about how many tuning-theory mistakes I &quot;made&quot; and how I&apos;m &quot;ruining<br/>the art&quot;.  Same goes for Cameron, was has receive similar accusations from Carl<br/>and yet, IMVHO, is a much better composer and scale-creator/user.  And Marcel<br/>was actually thrown off the tuning list for his &quot;false math&quot; and claims that it<br/>could be very useful...meanwhile myself, Igs, Cameron, Chris, Mike B, and<br/>several others finally agree his version of Beethoven&apos;s Drei Equili, retuned<br/>using his theory, sounds significantly better than 12TET and 5-limit JI and<br/>likely on par with, if not beating, the historic favorite 31TET and 1/4 comma<br/>meantone tunings.  Yes, Marcel&apos;s work is also based on math...but it at least<br/>has strong musical examples and tries for something new rather than somewhat<br/>blindly forcing conformity to &quot;proven theories&quot; as if virtually nothing new is<br/>possible in microtonallity.<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>   I swear, the last thing we aspiring microtonalists need is to put forth huge<br/>honest effort and have people claim our effort is useless and carry a<br/>only-one-way-can-be-right mentallity about music in general.  Tuning math and<br/>tuning, even, are seperate topics...yet people on the tuning list often get<br/>criticized for not talking about tuning math!  There is a new list called<br/>&quot;Tuning Research&quot; ran by Mike B. which I highly recommend because it, like the<br/>tuning list, contains a lot of experts but, unlike the tuning list, is very open<br/>to musical examples and math that don&apos;t fit some sort of pre-decided/biased mold<br/>and does not involve loads of flaming.  This list is good as well...at least for<br/>those lucky moments where we have full, inspired songs to post.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23473 href="#23473">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2010 8:19:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To top it off....Robert (who got thrown off both lists for simply and<br/>honestly saying &quot;you guys are using to much math and so little musical example,<br/>it&apos;s likely to confuse people&quot;) is a leading musician and programmer in this<br/>field....yet Carl still does not respect him.<br/>Eventually I see a split.

It would be fantastic, IMVHO,<br/>if professors in music schools lobbied to make a course in creating microtonal<br/>scales and composing in them an elective for all music majors (similar to<br/>creative writing as an English elective).  If we can get out of people&apos;s minds<br/>that microtonalism is some one-track-minded unbearably complex overly-academic<br/>idea with few listenableexamples, it will be a great accomplishment.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23475 href="#23475">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2010 8:30:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dante&gt;&quot;Robert, you&apos;re a good guy and all (I presume) and I respect your efforts<br/>to<br/>create a  repository of tuning texts, but come on: did you actually go on<br/>the tuning-MATH list to complain that they were talking about tuning-MATH???&quot;</p><p>Agreed (Robert), this could REALLY easily come off the wrong way.<br/>I get the impression your point was &quot;it&apos;s not a problem that you are using<br/>Tuning Math...but I have issue with your going on about it without supplementing<br/>it with practical musical examples&quot;.<br/>If you said it like I just did and still got thrown off the tuning-math list,<br/>though, I think it would be pretty clear it was most likely the list moderator,<br/>and not yourself, carrying the attitude problem.</p><p>To clear it up as well<br/>A) I think the issue of tuning math on the Tuning List, even in Robert&apos;s<br/>full-force wording, is understand-able<br/>B) I think the issue of tuning math on the Tuning Math List was rather<br/>overstated by Robert considering it IS a designated math list, though I do see<br/>his point</p><p>-Michael</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23477 href="#23477">ðŸ”—</a>robert &#x3C;robertthomasmartin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2010 9:49:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I personally think that this document is very funny and I have to laugh every time I read it.

I am a genuine musician who can read, write and play music. I can improvise in any tuning that I can imagine. What on earth are you going on about? If you are genuine mathematicians then what on earth are you trying to prove? All that you are succeeding in doing is muddying the waters for genuine musicians. You should be ashamed of yourselves. And you Carl: What are you going to do? You are already moderating my messages in the tuning group. Are you going to ban me? Big deal if you do. This group appears to be the refuge of untalented musicians who happen to be mathematicians. Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic. You should be ashamed of yourselves. But perhaps you are so insensitive of the real issues of microtonal music that you are ignorant of what you are doing.<br/>&gt; &quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, you guessed it, I got banned from the tuning-math group. But from the tuning group too! This appears to be a gross abuse of power.<br/>&gt;</p></div>
