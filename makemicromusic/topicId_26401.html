&nbsp; A huge majority of the negative ones were due to them jumping the gun and saying what they &quot;knew my theory was aimed toward&quot; without asking me or my missing a historical term and their getting really heated up as if I meant to do it IE song vs. piece of music or polyphony vs. heterophony or<br/> personality/intention judgments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If there has been some obvious &quot;what to do&quot; point beyond &quot;read more books from the masters...learn theories from x prominent figure in microtonal music&quot; (something I&apos;ve found useful at some times and not others)...it apparently was not well-explained to me.&nbsp; And again, I wish we could all go back to<br/> judging each others music first and foremost before jumping into theories...and avoid any attitude personal judgment or &quot;training the &apos;lesser student&apos; &quot; altogether.</p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the record (hopefully branching off into a less personal topic), I see a strong pattern (as I almost always have) in not just having few intervals per interval class and constant structure ALA MOS...but virtually any system that allows the brain to classify music into a few simple parts.&nbsp; Be those a chain of fifths, a chain of only two interval sizes, where the set of intervals are off key but by a consistent/predictable amount (IE scales that beat a lot, but keep about the same amount of beating regardless of the intervals used)...&nbsp; Plus a chord that is high limit IE 14:18:21...can be balanced out by what&apos;s &quot;good&quot; in it at a lower level IE the 7:6 and 9:7 dyads.&nbsp; And a scale with terribly rough semitones IE the diatonic scale is balanced out by the fact those semitones are maximally spaced from each other.</p><p>&nbsp; And figures that, in composition, I hear a lot of pieces with chords leaning toward &quot;bad/sour&quot; weaved into Motifs in ways where the predictability of the Motifs &quot;cancel out&quot; the unpredictability of the &quot;bad ratios&quot; used in the chord progressions.&nbsp; Meanwhile, as Igs has pointed out, and Mike B made clear about Blackwood...just how much low-limit ratios can matter far as root notes of chord progressions IE that they aren&apos;t simply a tool for single chords, but also for chord progressions.&nbsp; And this seems to stress the use of chains of low-limit ratios to make resolving chord progressions (using notes along those chains as roots for chords).&nbsp; Then again if you use so much of such a &quot;simplifying theory&quot;...I&apos;ve found you (just like with diatonic scales in 12TET) have to go the extra mile to find some way to get surprise and tension into a composition.&nbsp; This seems to show a danger of getting too far into using one and only one theory.</p><p>&nbsp; So, all in all...I&apos;ve come to a conclusion that while scales, composition...all matter...what matters most is not what theory or theories a piece of music abides by but the overall balance of the concoction of the theories used.&nbsp; Just about everything I&apos;ve composed that I&apos;ve felt has worked did not follow one theory completely, but instead chipped pieces off of each theory and assembled them into something stable.</p><p>&nbsp; Has anyone else hear notes any combinations of theories, plus their own ideas, that have served them well for composition?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2011 2:21:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Machine is insane in that it has 4:7:9:11 all over<br/>&gt; the place, although the accuracy isn&apos;t suitable for those who are into<br/>&gt; microtemperament. Any others?</p><p>It&apos;s hard to beat the diatonic scale. Diminished[8] and august[9] are good, but those temperaments aren&apos;t really good for more than 12 notes, and then you&apos;re just getting a minor variation on 12-ET. Keemun[11] is nice, and you&apos;ve got a good 19-note &quot;chromatic&quot; scale to play with, but 11 notes is pushing the limit of a reasonable scale size for something comparable to the diatonic scale. I&apos;m a fan of neutral seconds, so I like porcupine[7], and the 15-note MOS is a good &quot;chromatic&quot; scale for porcupine.</p><p>Probably the best thing I can suggest is orwell[9], with orwell[13] as a &quot;chromatic&quot; scale. But I think you&apos;d want at least 22 notes to do much with orwell.</p><p>Here&apos;s another one that looks somewhat interesting: it&apos;s a 6&amp;9 temperament with generators around 399.7 and 152.7 cents. The generator mapping is [&lt;3 4 7 8 10], &lt;0 2 0 1 1]], and it has MOS at 6, 9, 15, and 24 notes. Does this have a name?
