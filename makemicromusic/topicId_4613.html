The 24<br/>tone system was advanced by al-Farabi circa 940 CE. In &quot;Measurement<br/>of the Arabian Scale,&quot;  Yusuf Shawqi concludes ( I&apos;m told) far fewer<br/>than 24 tones are found in practice. Adding to the confusion maqamat<br/>(plural of maqam) and scales are different concepts. How does one<br/>expect new master pieces when we can&apos;t agree on what has already been<br/>accomplished?</p><p>Arabic music has a strong theoretical base that dates back to the<br/>Greeks. We have yet to see the zenith that this 17 pitch system may<br/>reach. Not notated much before the1800s it still relies on a mix of<br/>notation and memory, so an oral history still prevails. With other<br/>music available memories can fade. One Arabic orchestra has already<br/>started using a piano instead of a qanun.<br/>What&apos;s the big deal?  see:</p><p>&quot;<a href="http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/700/780/fairuz/legend/instruments.ht">http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/700/780/fairuz/legend/instruments.ht</a><br/>ml&quot; \l &quot;qanun&quot;</p><p>Questions:<br/>An Arabic keyboard is a dream of mine.  Carl Lumma already introduced<br/>me to the 31 pitch per octave generalized keyboard.  Being a purest I<br/>don&apos;t want to just up the number of key  to avoid missing one.<br/>The<br/>1/4 tone is a misnomer by the way.  Arabic music has 1/2 steps, 3/4<br/>steps, whole steps and at times 1&amp;1/4 steps, but no 1/4 steps.  see:</p><p>&quot;<a href="http://WWW.maqamworld.com">http://WWW.maqamworld.com</a>&quot;</p><p>What literature is available?  Has anyone seen Yusuf Shawqi&apos;s book?<br/>Has it been translated to English?  What music program has expertise<br/>in this area?</p><p>Warm Wishes (WW),<br/>Jim Nagy</p></div>
