Doing so would scarcely be possible, since I haven&apos;t heard most of the entries. So I want to make it clear that objecting to the results isn&apos;t what I am doing, and if you don&apos;t agree I issue this challenge--show me where I objected to the results, quoting what I said.</p><p>I did and do have some objections. I&apos;m good at having objections, and one of the things I object to is people responding not to what I say, but how it comes across to them on an emotional level. If you think I am a bit annoyed, you are correct; but the default assumption should be, I think, that I&apos;m annoyed about what I say I am annoyed about, and not something else. It&apos;s elementary psychology to surmise I would be less cranky if I had won a prize--in part, just because I would feel more of a moral obligation to soft-peddle any objections I might have. There&apos;s also the principle of the IQ test: you may object to treating it as a measurement, but probably more quietly if you scored highly. But that&apos;s psychology, it&apos;s not the point at issue.</p><p>In the spirit of full disclosure, having listened to last year&apos;s results, I think the person who should have won didn&apos;t even place. I&apos;ll give my own ranking when I&apos;ve sorted it out and if you want to call that objecting to the results I suppose you may. It&apos;s really more by way of illustrating my point that the results of adding up apples and oranges isn&apos;t a measurement, or even a fruit salad, and should not be presented as one. That, I DO object to.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2011 1:22:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jan 25, 2011 at 4:14 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the spirit of full disclosure, having listened to last year&apos;s results, I think the person who should have won didn&apos;t even place.
