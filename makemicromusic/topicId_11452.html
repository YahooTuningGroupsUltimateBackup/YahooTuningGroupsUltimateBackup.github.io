One interesting thing I read recently, in a great book called &quot;Escaping the Delta,&quot; by Elijah Wald, involved the famous Alan Lomax visit to the South to document music for the Library of Congress. He met Muddy Waters about 1941, and of course recorded some of his music. And, and as we all know, Muddy was one of the titans of blues...but, in the form he had to fill out for Lomax, he listed his singing repertoire, and it included 7 Gene Autry songs, and a number of other tunes that were considered &quot;pop&quot; at the time, not blues at all. But, there were never any Western albums recorded by Muddy, and that&apos;s a shame, cause I would have loved to have heard him sing cowboy songs. Because of his race, and the way black musicians were marketed then, Muddy was a &quot;bluesman,&quot; and that was that.<br/>  The main thrust of this book focuses on how a lot of our perceptions of just what a blues artist was is not totally correct, and how a lot of these misperceptions started in the 1960&apos;s, when musicians like Eric Clapton romanticized guys like Robert Johnson as sort of primitive geniuses, the ragged bluesman walking down a dusty road with his guitar over his back. But, Johnson&apos;s only known picture shows him in a sharp 3 piece suit, with fedora, and it was well known that he could play and sing just about anything, from pop standards to country tunes. And the same goes for a lot of &quot;bluesmen&quot; (and women); they were much more versatile as performers than is generally thought, and they had to be, because their audiences were listening to all sorts of music, and would want to hear their favorite tunes at a show/dance (and most performances in those days were dances...listen to Johnson&apos;s constant beat on the low strings of his guitar).<br/>  Wald interviewed one old black performer (in his 90&apos;s, with a new wife), and the guy told him he used to sing a certain song in Mandarin Chinese, as well as play all the big hits of the day. The book is full of anecdotes like this, and is a real eye opener. Bobby Bland said he loved country music, and sang a lot of the songs, but he knew the racial climate wasn&apos;t right for him to make it in that field. And of course, Ray Charles could sing/play just about any style of American music there was (and he invented some, too). But, when Ray did his country thing, he remolded the tunes into his own style, and was not really a part of the &quot;country&quot; scene...Charley pride was the only black person I&apos;m aware of that made it in country.<br/>  Genres can be very destructive to real artists, as they are forced to stay in a box not of their own making. The placing of black artists into the blues genre, even if they could do much more, as a lot of them could, is a great example of a genre being forced onto the market in a somewhat artificial way, in this case because of race. It&apos;s too bad, I&apos;ll bet Muddy could sing the shit out of cowboy songs...HHH</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2005 10:32:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot;<br/>&lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  Neil</p><p> Very interesting post.</p><p> Of course for every plus there is a minus. (or minus there is<br/> a plus as in this case). Many artists forced into a genre do<br/> great there. The public sees them in a certain way and loves<br/> that illusion. The same holds true in movies (which are illusions<br/> to begin with). Think about some very likeable actor today that<br/> begins to appear in movie roles as a psychopath. The fans<br/> (that is fanatics) of this actor would be outraged. Yet each<br/> role he had, the good-guy ones or bad-guy ones,were all just<br/> make believe anyway.</p><p> Take any artist you mentioned and image them getting<br/> away with singing this. (see link)</p><p> I believe Carl said I can&apos;t post the lyrics here because of<br/> copyright concerns. Anyway image them singing this song with<br/> the execption of paragraph 1 and  the second to last paragraph.</p><p><a href="http://www.lyricsdownload.com/waitresses-know-what-boys-like-">http://www.lyricsdownload.com/waitresses-know-what-boys-like-</a><br/>lyrics.html</p><p>Stephen Szpak</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Genres can be very destructive to real artists, as they are<br/>forced to<br/>stay in a box not of their own making.
