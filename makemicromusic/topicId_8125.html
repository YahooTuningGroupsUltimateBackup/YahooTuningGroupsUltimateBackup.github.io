I&apos;m actually already using NWC to make MIDI files from notation, which I then retune using Scala.  But I haven&apos;t been concerned yet with producing a score.  Of course, you approach will work, so long as the instrument accommodates tuning.</p><p>But these concerns can wait.  What I&apos;d like to do in the short term is to create tabulature scores for the real-time Csound pieces I&apos;m working on (with Art Hunkins), in which the user plays a set of knobs or sliders on a MIDI controller.  Since all I want or need to indicate is a series of events (e.g., controller number, controller position, start time, and duration), tabulature seems ideal.  It looks as if lilypond has that capability, so I&apos;m going to look into that.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>&gt;Hi Dave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well you could use the approach I use for my pieces here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The idea is that you use NWC to write a playing score<br/>&gt;for a retuned keyboard - the keyboard can be tuned to any tuning<br/>&gt;you like not necessarily 12-t. &gt;<br/>&gt;A keyboard player uusing a suutably retuned keyboard just<br/>&gt;reads it like a 12-t score using their familiar<br/>&gt;hand / eye coordination - but because the<br/>&gt;keyboard is retuned, then they play microtonal<br/>&gt;pitches.

Lilypond is attractive, but, in my opinion, it is not yet ready for publication-quality microtonal work.</p><p>If you need microtonal playback directly from your score, Finale is the better choice at the moment (there being no &quot;best&quot; choice at the moment) and Lime is the only alternative.  Finale offers microtonal midi playback via either individual pitchbends (which may or may not have graphics attached) or through the non-standard key signature facility with some external, full-keyboard tuning.  The non-standard facility appears to be counter-intuitive for many users, but it&apos;s great for any notation scheme with regular interval spellings (i.e. each accidental has a fixed value in terms of scale steps).  I rather like the user-defined tuning table in Lime, but it is limited to tunings with seven nominals (the &quot;white keys&quot;) and four accidentals (i.e. a maximum of 35 pitches per score) and Lime is not yet -- in my opinion -- the full-feature program that Finale is, with some serious restrictions. But not everyone is a notation-wonk, examining their scores microscopically or demanding Henle-level editions.  If you have been satisfied with Noteworthy&apos;s output, then I strongly recommend trying out Lime. You can try it out for free and the purchase price is modest.<br/>(There are a lot of complaints about Finale&apos;s interface.  I see the matter somewhat differently and find that Finale&apos;s variety of interfaces -- simple entry, speedy entry, midi file transfer, and command-line entry -- far outweighs the complaints about any single note-entry method, and no other program at the moment supports such a range of input methods.   The menus are profligate, but that&apos;s just the price of having so many features. The one single feature of Finale, however, that I can&apos;t live without is the ability to shift between Page and Scroll views.  The multiple page view used in Sibelius is -- to me -- a weak compromise, and, with my aesthetic, it is too inflexible to consider as a serious composing environment. My biggest complaint about Finale is that there are some third-party plug-ins, especially TGTools, that are almost essential and ought to be fully packaged with Finale, given the price.)</p><p>The developers of Turandot (who have just survived a major legal challenge by one of the bigger companies), promise an individual pitch-bend based microtonal playback.  If this allows for defining pitch bends for the nominals as well, then this is especially promising, but if not, it will at least allow for all the multiples-of-twelve tunings. In any case, Turandot is reasonably priced and has an interesting interface.</p><p>If someone ever develops a Lime-like plug-in for either Finale or Sibelius with more than seven nominal and four accidentals, then we&apos;ll really have something useful.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p><p>Dave Seidel wrote:</p><p>&gt; What do people recommend for notation software?

I&apos;m working both on stuff written directly in Csound, some of it for live performance using knobs/sliders on a MIDI controller, and other stuff written using conventional notation with Noteworthy, saved as MIDI, and then retuned with Scala.  My immediate notational interest is to develop a form of tabulature suitable for my pieces that use a MIDI controller, but since I was broaching the subject, I thought it would be good to hear people&apos;s thoughts on microtonal notation software in general.  So far, I haven&apos;t found a good solution for making non-guitar-oriented tabulature, but I&apos;m still looking.  I thought Lilypond might be suitable, but after looking at the docs, I&apos;m not so sure it would work unless I&apos;m willing to hack Scheme -- not completely out of the question, but not very realistic either at this point in time.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>[blog] <a href="http://superluminal.com/dave/weblog">http://superluminal.com/dave/weblog</a><br/>[music] <a href="http://mysterybear.net">http://mysterybear.net</a></p><p>&gt;This thread begs the question, who is the notation for?

They just are not<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;accurate enough for &quot;serious&quot; microtonality.  They seem to vary a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;lot... (although it&apos;s my impressions that pitch bends, *in<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;general* do this... and it&apos;s been confirmed by listening to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;several items posted on these tuning lists over the years...)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There&apos;s more accuracy in pitch bend than most synths are capable<br/>&gt;&gt; of producing.  The problem lies elsewhere.  Can you describe the<br/>&gt;&gt; symptoms?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;***Hi Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, the symptoms are that each time the notes are played they seem<br/>&gt;to be bent slightly differently, unless it&apos;s my imagination.  Also,<br/>&gt;sometimes a pitch bend can throw off the entire tuning of Sibelius,<br/>&gt;and one has to stop the playback and select a note further on to get<br/>&gt;on track.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m sure this is mostly a problem endemic to Sibelius...</p><p>Sounds like it.</p><p>What method are you using to enter the pitch bends?</p><p>And what ever became of Peter Walton&apos;s plugin?</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;I use Sibelius now strictly as an *engraving* tool, and use tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;table synths for the microtonal composing.

This is a complete music production program based on notation, and comes at just the time when Finale and Sibelius, the big elephants in the engraving software world, are increasingly adding production devices to their packages so it is interesting to see and hear how a program apparently coming from the other perspective performs in comparison.</p><p>Although many of the individual components are familiar, it has a very different feel from any other music software I know. On the surface, this is because it is more oriented towards popular musics than the software I usually use, and has the native MusicXML and digital sound environment so directly available that the more familiar midi facilities rapidly slip into the background. But I think that the main difference is that the program really structures everything in a new, internally consistant way; it&apos;s like a music production suite written by Bourbaki... the ample help window messages even remind me of Bourbaki&apos;s warning hand signals!</p><p>I stopped programming back when Hector was a pup, but the program seems to invite 3rd party scripting, the developer&apos;s manual can be downloaded right away, and the scripting in Lua seems to lend the whole program much of its particular taste. The price of the package at 70 USD or EUR (save big, buy in dollars!) and the attitude of the developers places it on that narrow edge between shareware and bigbidnisware. There is an active polling site for user development requests and the programmers don&apos;t appear to have the peavish impatience that Finale and Sibelius staff famously share. If four or five members of the tuning community got active on the polling, perhaps we could have some additional microtuning bells and whistles very fast.</p><p>As an engraving tool, it has very nice out of the box output, but is not yet ready for prime time. It promises access to all of the font sets, but not -- to my great frustration -- allowing one to split up the notation characters aong several fonts.  But, the action here for me would be to make my scores in Finale and then export the MusicXML to Harmony Assistant to get a more polished digital product or vice versa. The native microtonal facilities are two fold: one involves note-attached pitch bends directly to digital output, so no worries about midi channel limtations; the other involves the creation of &quot;rules&quot; -- in one case, you can assign specific microtunings to specific notes (the built-in scripts for Turkish and Quartertone accidental are neat), in another case, one can define tunings based on relationships to a fundamental. Included in the package are an example of the former with 19tet, and examples of the latter for barbershop quartet in 7-limit JI and other vocal ensembles in MT and 5-limit JI arrangements. It appears that one is limited to 21 tones (7 nominals +14 accidentals) for a given microtuning rule, but one is not limited to using a single rule within a composition. Again, my immediate frustration is not being able to break up the music font.  The rules can include neat descriptive handles -- for example &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;seventh partial&quot; or the cent value or any other description.</p><p>At present, the program seems to stop at one cent tuning accuracy. I can&apos;t imagine that this needs to be the limit, so I have already voted for that improvement on the polling page.</p><p>I have the feeling that Harmony Assistant is a strong suggestion of what  a complete music production system is going to look like in  five- or six-years time. I just don&apos;t know if it is the real thing, with real development in front of it, or just a promising cul de sac.</p><p>I also got the Virtual Singer add-on.  It&apos;s quite impressive, and with tweaking even more so,  but I&apos;m not yet sure form an aesthetic point of view what exactly I&apos;m going to do with it -- mock-ups of choral music or maybe cartoon soundtracks...</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=8213 href="#8213">ðŸ”—</a>idealordid &#x3C;jeff@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2004 6:17:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the thorough review Daniel.
