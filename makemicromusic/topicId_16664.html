He&apos;s named it &quot;Roz&quot; after<br/>&gt;&gt;Roswell, New Mexico. A refresher: It&apos;s an 8 string in microtempered<br/>&gt;&gt;7-limit JI with an otonal tetrad on the low 4 open strings and utonal<br/>&gt;&gt;on the high 4.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;When he came to take delivery it was awesome to see and hear him play<br/>&gt;&gt;it so well so quickly. He had clearly been thinking about the tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;and the guitar design deeply and for a long time.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;At the moment he&apos;s unhappy about being unable to play it. He badly cut<br/>&gt;&gt;his left thumb at work (4 stitches). :-(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think I heard something about that on MMM.  :(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This is the first<br/>&gt;&gt;Choob to use clear fretline and I&apos;m currently installing a red neon<br/>&gt;&gt;tube inside it, to be powered via the second channel of a stereo cable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Awesome!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;But you&apos;re right, there&apos;d be no harm in having a queue, in which case<br/>&gt;&gt;you&apos;ll be the first on it, after me. I&apos;ve been thinking about pricing.<br/>&gt;&gt;Here&apos;s a formula I could live with. This is Australian dollars.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;$200 + $30 per string + $5 per fret or fretlet<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;So a 6-string with 24 frets comes to AU$500.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;But right now (I can&apos;t say for how long) I&apos;ll give a 20% discount to<br/>&gt;&gt;any brave soul willing to take a risk on something new.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Wow!  I should just write you a check.  I&apos;d like to consult with<br/>&gt;you a bit on tuning at some point, maybe off-list.  I&apos;m thinking<br/>&gt;of 22-ET, but the Roz tuning sounds interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;These prices include a strap and sock and hard case. The sock is the<br/>&gt;&gt;black cloth tube that you slip over the choob before you slide it<br/>&gt;&gt;inside it&apos;s case. Internal lighting will be extra (I haven&apos;t worked<br/>&gt;&gt;that out yet). You can pay by electronic transfer or PayPal. I may ask<br/>&gt;&gt;for payment in advance if I don&apos;t know you well. (Not you Carl)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll pay in advance anyway.  What&apos;s your e-mail address for<br/>&gt;purposes of PayPal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;When shipping outside Australia I figure I should ship it with the<br/>&gt;&gt;ballast chamber empty and open. I&apos;ll assemble it to test it, and then<br/>&gt;&gt;take it apart enough to give access. I wouldn&apos;t want customs to have<br/>&gt;&gt;to take it apart just to prove there&apos;s nothing in there but a little<br/>&gt;&gt;bit of Aussie beach. So I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll have to source your own wet<br/>&gt;&gt;sand and complete the assembly. Instructions will of course be provided.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Assistance with designing a guitar or bass for your desired microtonal<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning will be provided free of charge, as always, since that&apos;s pure<br/>&gt;&gt;fun. :-) The design discussion can be carried out on one of the tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;lists if you think others would be interested, or by email.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well this is just great news.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was thinking about buying one of these<br/>&gt;<a href="http://blackbirdguitars.com">http://blackbirdguitars.com</a><br/>&gt;and maybe I still will, but I think a Choob has a lot of things<br/>&gt;going for it as a first step into guitarland.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By the way, I asked my friend who&apos;s a guitarist &apos;seduced into being<br/>&gt;a guitar tech&apos; about piezo vs. magnetic, and he says piezos:<br/>&gt; * tend to sound brittle<br/>&gt; * don&apos;t overdrive as well<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not worried about either of these, and at any rate observations<br/>&gt;made on a normal guitar may not apply to choobs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Oh: string material.

I have soft hands, owing<br/>&gt;to never having done an honest day&apos;s work in my life (as I like<br/>&gt;to quip), and the high string on a normal steel 6-string often hurts<br/>&gt;my fingers.  Classical/nylon guitars don&apos;t bother me as much, nor<br/>&gt;do baritone or bass guitars.  Since it&apos;s piezo I guess nylon would<br/>&gt;work as well (?).

There would also be nothing<br/>&gt;&gt;to stop you changing from nylon to steel at some later date, except<br/>&gt;&gt;that the saddle-setback may need to change slightly to maintain<br/>&gt;&gt;accurate intonation on the high frets and this is not adjustable<br/>&gt;&gt;except by cutting the old saddle off the bridge and gluing on a new one.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Should we move this to MMM?

Not something you&apos;d want to show off to your friends.<br/>No paint, no pickup, no strap buttons, no ballast chamber, no truss<br/>wires, no fret centre locating holes and high action to allow for<br/>worst case string gauges, but enough to let you hear it (softly) and<br/>get the feel of it. If you decide you don&apos;t like it you can try a<br/>different fretting. You just fill the old fret-end holes and drill new<br/>ones on a new line offset around the curve by say 5 millimetres. You<br/>could do this maybe 5 times with the same tube.</p><p>Then when you&apos;ve got a tuning you like, you can turn it into a<br/>full-blown Choob. Alternatively you could have the tuning implemented<br/>on a conventional guitar.</p><p>Unfortunately this doesn&apos;t make quite so much sense if I&apos;m building<br/>the Choob for you and you&apos;re not in Australia, as the freight costs<br/>could add up (about AU$25 each way for airmail). But it&apos;s not entirely<br/>out of the question.</p><p>I suspect a lot of good microtonal guitar ideas never see the light of<br/>day because of the high level of financial risk associated with<br/>implementing them when they may not work. Well now there&apos;s no excuse. :-)</p><p>&gt;By the way, I asked my friend who&apos;s a guitarist &apos;seduced into being<br/>&gt;a guitar tech&apos; about piezo vs. magnetic, and he says piezos:<br/>&gt; * tend to sound brittle<br/>&gt; * don&apos;t overdrive as well<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not worried about either of these, and at any rate observations<br/>&gt;made on a normal guitar may not apply to choobs.</p><p>How right you are.</p><p>I assume by &quot;sound brittle&quot; he means either lacking in bass or<br/>exaggerating the treble or having sharp resonances in the treble. And<br/>by &quot;don&apos;t overdrive&quot; he means they have a low output level and so<br/>cannot be made to drive the amplifier input stages so far into the<br/>beloved distortion.</p><p>I have to agree that they often sound like that when added on to<br/>existing instruments. I had heard them myself and so wasn&apos;t expecting<br/>much. Which is why I leapt from my bathtub shouting &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot;<br/>and ran down the street naked with my alligator clips dangling, when I<br/>heard the result with the Choob.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_Stockade">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_Stockade</a></p><p>These problems definitely do not occur with the Choob. I don&apos;t know<br/>for sure why, but I have some theories (fairly well grounded I think).<br/>A piezo transducer is a piece of anisotropic material that converts<br/>pressure along a preferred direction into electrical charge. The type<br/>I&apos;m using is called a bender as it is laminated onto a thin sheet of<br/>brass in such a way that it responds most to bending (e.g. support the<br/>edges and push on the middle.</p><p>When added on to an existing instrument the piezo is effectively<br/>acting as an accellerometer relying on its own small mass to convert<br/>motion into pressure. This is pretty ineffective at low frequencies<br/>and the piezo itself has resonances right in the middle of the audio<br/>band. And it produces a low output level because it is only tapping<br/>off a tiny portion of the string motion.</p><p>With the Choob a lot of synergy/serendipity happened. Because of the<br/>curvature, the bridge is an arch and because it is PVC it is<br/>lightweight. So I am effectively supporting the entire lightweight<br/>bridge on a pillar standing on the middle of the piezo(s). The full<br/>pressure variation of the vibrating string is brought to bear on the<br/>piezo, hence the high level, and it really is transducing pressure.<br/>The tube underneath it is fairly rigid and packed with wet sand so the<br/>piezo&apos;s own mass becomes irrelevant and the resonances are pushed<br/>below the audio band. The mating of bridge and guitar-body surfaces to<br/>piezo surfaces is hermetic as it is put in with PVC solvent cement<br/>which conforms to the piezo&apos;s shape.</p><p>It is however important to have a high impedance input to your amp or<br/>you will lose bass. But magnetic pickups need high impedance too, so<br/>any guitar amp should be fine. It may not work well into your stereo<br/>or computer without a preamp, but preamps are not expensive anyway.</p><p>By the way, the wet sand ballasted tube isn&apos;t quite as good as a solid<br/>wood body for preventing feedback, but it&apos;s certainly good enough to<br/>play loud enough to annoy your neighbours without feeding back.
