A magazine here rereleases classic movies, usually more<br/>offbeat ones, and this morning the very films I was going to mention<br/>on this thread are included! For about 8 dollars, hohoho!</p><p>Aguirre the Wrath of God and Cobra Verde, two great Herzog/Kinski<br/>movies with very nice Popol Vuh soundtracks, including African folk<br/>music in Cobra Verde, just the extras in the movie filmed live<br/>singing and left in the final cut. Strange how Herzog later said<br/>he&apos;d cut out such scenes, which I consider highlights, but maybe<br/>that&apos;s a conflict between the eyes and ears (and director&apos;s egos?)<br/>that tends to weaken film music.</p><p>Other fine soundtracks- Zardoz, Planet of the Apes (the first<br/>couple), The Ultimate Warrior, A Clockwork Orange of course... hmmm,<br/>basically lots of &quot;bad&quot; (a.k.a. great) movies have the deepest<br/>soundtracks.</p><p>And what about the Artemiev soundtracks?
