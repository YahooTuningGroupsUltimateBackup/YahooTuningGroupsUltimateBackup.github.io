I cannot see anything that<br/>&gt; would restrict this.</p><p>Probably only limited by the size of the fret units and how many<br/>fit into the channels.</p><p>&gt; I wonder how much the instruments cost.</p><p>Going through the Tuning List archives I found some posts from<br/>Wim Hoogewerf who uses the system professionally in concerts:</p><p>Aug 1999:<br/>&quot;the price is at least a 1000 dollar. The guitar has to come to Germany.<br/>Building in the FretMobile system will take a day or two. Please send a<br/>quick note to Herv&Egrave; so he can send you detailed information. The<br/>technical<br/>realisation is at NASA level. Extremely trustworthy.&quot;</p><p>Dec 2000:<br/>&quot;Herv&eacute; Chouard, Walter Vogt&apos;s successor and actually the only<br/>(and lonely)<br/>producer of *the* system, told me recently that he has managed<br/>to reduce the<br/>cost considerately thanks to a new plastic material for the fretlets,<br/>allowing the use of a mould.&quot;</p><p>Aug 2001:<br/>&quot;Frets for every string are individually tuneable within one<br/>cent precision.<br/>I do use the system myself since 1986. The advantage is definitely the<br/>professional reliability: every configuration is possible, no loss of<br/>sustain or whatsoever. Disadvantage: every tuning takes time to<br/>set, between<br/>20 and 30 minutes. So you need several guitars to do a whole<br/>concert with<br/>different tunings.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Something worth saving for.</p><p>Yes !</p><p>&gt; Justin<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2002 7:57:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;justintonation&quot; &lt;JUSTINTONATION@H...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; See &lt;<a href="http://www.chouard.de/">http://www.chouard.de/</a>&gt; for Herv&eacute; R.
