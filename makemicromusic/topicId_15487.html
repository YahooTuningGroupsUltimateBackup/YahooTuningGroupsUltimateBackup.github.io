After n bars of playing, the<br/>transcribed result is displayed on a monitor on the music<br/>desk, and you attempt to play that.  The process is continuous.<br/>Transcription/human error will pile up and result in novel<br/>musical material, as well as great reading exercise.</p><p>N could be adjusted to get Beethoven-like themes or song-like<br/>sections.  The MIDI transcriber would introduce novelty more<br/>slowly than the audio one.  The fact that there&apos;s repetition<br/>with (hopefully) subtle variation makes it good practice for<br/>reading.</p><p>The idea was inspired by a Fleck/Meyer improv where one<br/>performer copies the other after n bars.  Probably stuff like<br/>this has been done.  I think Larry Polansky had something<br/>similar on one of the JI Network tapes.  Usually I think with<br/>such approaches the computer has been programmed to add in<br/>novelty on purpose.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
