Not only the music, but the background computer<br/>construction and the esthetic discussion.  Lots of stuff here, that&apos;s<br/>for sure.</p><p>I had some questions, personally, about some of the ideas<br/>of &quot;flatness&quot; since I don&apos;t feel that Xenakis and Ferneyhough are<br/>really &quot;flat...&quot;  Boulez and Babbitt I can see, as well as Cage.</p><p>And Feldman wasn&apos;t mentioned right off the top.  Don&apos;t they like him<br/>at Columbia...? [I had to get that joke in...]</p><p>Well, the piece really changes a lot.  Sometimes it really *does*<br/>sound like Cage, other times like minimalism...</p><p>The samples really sound great and listening in a &quot;micro&quot; way, as you<br/>recommend, seems quite rewarding.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to listen to the entire soon, but I gave it a pretty<br/>good &quot;sample&quot; at the moment.</p><p>Nice to know this is all in 19-tET, too...</p><p>Congrats to you!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
