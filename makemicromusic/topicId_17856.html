He is well, but somewhat frail.</p><p>Some may remember that Dr. Barzun was a keen supporter of Harry Partch.  He also wrote extensively on Berlioz and a dozen dozen other subjects (like baseball).</p><p>I am doing a concert in Calgary (that sadly will not have any microtonal music in it) in his honour.</p><p>But I hope that by bringing this to the attention of the group, others who are performing might place some tribute mention in their performances.  Also, if any are writers, dare I suggest a brief article written for your favourite journal?</p><p>In my estimation, he is one of the greatest minds that North America can claim for itself.  Please, let us do something to mark the birthday of the remarkable man!</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p></div>
