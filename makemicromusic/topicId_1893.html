Unfortunately the few<br/>microtonal pieces I&apos;ve recorded on tape are pretty underdeveloped.<br/>The most interesting items tend to date from before I got distracted<br/>by all this microtonality stuff, simply because in those &quot;single<br/>days&quot; I had more available time to sit down and work things out.</p><p>Anyway I&apos;ve posted up a couple of files for your enjoyment, or<br/>amusement, or whatever.  These are probably 3-4 years old.  I might<br/>put up more over the next few days.  As always, comments, praise or<br/>ridicule are welcome.<br/>kp</p></div><h3>kalleaho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2002 12:05:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Kris!</p><p>I greatly enjoyed these!<br/>Made me howl like a wolf.</p><p>Kalle</p></div>
