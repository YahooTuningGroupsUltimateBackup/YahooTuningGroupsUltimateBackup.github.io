Alas, the haughty fury of the somniferous Orient turns<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; once again to the envious reverie of the Occident at the end &acirc;Â€&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tinted, however, with a tell-tale Hijaz murmur.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; East Dreams West was composed using Sibelius+Scordatura by H-Pi<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; instruments and processed with Logic Pro.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Special thanks to Aaron Krister Johnson for his kind invitation and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; encouragement.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Do visit <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a> for the score of East Dreams West and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; even<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; more treats!<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &acirc;Âœ&copy; &acirc;Âœ&copy; &acirc;Âœ&copy;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a><br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=21935 href="#21935">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2010 3:29:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 14 March 2010 03:15, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; At 01:40 PM 3/13/2010, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;Apparently the selections for the 60x60 contest have been made - the<br/>&gt;&gt;list of accepted works is available here:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.icmc2010.org/program.html">http://www.icmc2010.org/program.html</a> (Congrats, Ozan!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham, you made it!</p><p>Sure, I got an email about it.
