I think all here can<br/>make Excel divide.</p><p>I really enjoy 9ths, 11ths, 7ths, etc.  Could I use a similar method<br/>to Ms. Carlos&apos; to create a scale that would provide me with good dies<br/>(con)cordant values in these sets, much to the sacrifice of my non-<br/>favoured 3rds, 5ths, Octaves?   Or a division of a western octave<br/>that would provide me with the most discord possible when run through<br/>various modulations?  What intervals would I base this on?</p><p>That would be interestingÂ…  maybeÂ…</p><p>&lt;/rant off&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=18729 href="#18729">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2008 6:38:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>T.

Say you&apos;re interested in 6/5, 5/4, 3/2. Create a scale with these intervals, select &quot;Fit to mode of nonoctave ET&quot; from the Approximate menu, and there you go. After three crude approximations, three scales that approach the Carlos Alpha, Beta, and Gamma scales show up, followed by four scales with really tiny steps.</p><p>So let&apos;s say you really like 7/4, 9/4, and 11/4.
