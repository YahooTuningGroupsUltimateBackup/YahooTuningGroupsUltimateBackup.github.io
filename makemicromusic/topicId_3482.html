I remember we played down in a<br/>ditch next to a little brook that ran in back of us and under a bridge<br/>where I remember seeing a bunch of people when we were playing. The<br/>beer garden was up in back of that performance area on a hill behind<br/>the brook.

The city of Trenton decided to<br/>&gt; hold their own festival at the same place and time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought the TAGFest organization still exists to organise<br/>&gt; yearly George Anthiel concerts, but apparently there&apos;s<br/>&gt; an organization called Capital Arts in Trenton that has<br/>&gt; squeezed them out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Back then they had a<br/>&gt; &gt; beer garden, and things on the whole were pretty wild for<br/>something<br/>&gt; &gt; occurring in the middle of a metropolitan park in broad daylight!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those were the days....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * David Beardsley<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>&gt; * <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
