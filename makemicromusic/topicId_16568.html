Maybe I should map my midi keyboard to 19 tones per<br/>&gt;       octave and work from there. Right now I&apos;m using a 12-chain of 19 and for<br/>&gt;       that one piano would be enough. But using only one piano kinda misses the<br/>&gt;       point of the concert. By the way, do you notate by hand when composing<br/>&gt;       or do you use software?</p><p>The first &quot;go&quot; is by hand.  I just notate it in complete 17 or 19--tet notation, where G# is different from Ab, and so on.</p><p>When I composed the 17tet thing . . .I just typed this one-super-piano version into Finale, and then copied it between 2 pianos.  (I saved a copy of the original 1 piano version, so I could refer to it later if necessary).  then I went in, and for each piano, &quot;subtracted out&quot; the notes that that given piano couldn&apos;t play.  Then I went back and added in notes necessary to make rhythm and so on easier.</p><p>I should say that if you&apos;re the kind of person who writes &quot;at the piano&quot; this will be a bit problematic.</p><p>I often write stuff by imagining contours,  using some logical thought (like &quot;this will probably sound cool&quot; and so on), some inner ear, and sometimes I sit at a 12-tone piano and sorta play a melody and think, &quot;OK, it will be a screwey micro-y version of this . . . &quot;</p><p>Once I have copied out and modified the 2 piano parts in Finale, I record each one separately from my sequencer, tuning the device to each different tuning.  Then I play them togehter and decide about any changes. I then make the changes to the score, and begin this paragraph&apos;s actions again.  Repeat until satisfied!</p><p>&gt;       In the end i am quite happy with just this tuning taking up to 12.<br/>&gt;       Which made me better understand why even though the Indonesians have<br/>&gt;       Pelog that would form a nice series at 9, they tune only 7.<br/>&gt;       More is not always better.<br/>&gt;       Something is lost sometimes like in poetry</p><p>Yeah, once you go above 7,  it seems that what you really have is &quot;more notes to make 7-note scales from&quot;.  In a sense, no one can really write for, say, 19 tones.</p></div>
