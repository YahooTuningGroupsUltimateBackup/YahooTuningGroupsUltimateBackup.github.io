A good player can play what ever pitch you give them as Johnny&apos;s work in NY shows. Jim French showed up at my house with a harmonic flute, one with no holes and he was playing along in the eikosany, so it is the player at least as much as the instrument.</p><p>I have seem Square Organ Pipes with a plunger to play it like a trombone with a wire that hung over the body where one could put marks to designate the ratios. metal bars can be sunk in water as Emil Richard has in his studio.</p><p>But new instruments don&apos;t have the traditional disposition toward the former 12et tuning timbrewise so i understand. I must admit i have taken the other path of having instruments that produce pitches down into the 1/10 of a cent range thinking that if i can play it for variable pitched instruments then they have something to match. Which i guess is what Partch tried to do with string instruments although they are way to soft to be practical.</p><p>Most new instruments really aren&apos;t new. most are based or modification of existing ones</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Jacob wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is superb!
