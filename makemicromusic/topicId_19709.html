Not so sure what it says, my Czech isn&apos;t so hot....maybe the interview is archived there; it was played all over the country. Played 12 tone guitar, and several fretless pieces, including one with a 7 limit tuning. The gigs were very well received; the Czechs are an artistic society, and like music, theatre, marionettes, and art exhibits. Hell, we ate at a Pizzeria Dali once, with a huge exhibit of Dali stuff. And, both clubs I played (one in Brno) had wonderful art on the walls as well. Off to the NYC fretless fest on Sept 20/21...I&apos;ll be playing Sun the 21st at about 10, please come on down to Crash Mansion...best from the wild west...Hstick<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>   <a href="http://agenturadellarte.net">agenturadellarte.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
