So<br/>far, that hasn&apos;t included learning many standard things, like reading<br/>music, or knowing any scales at all. I just usually know how to play<br/>what I want to hear. I also don&apos;t generally play anyone else&apos;s<br/>material... so this whole 24-tET thing is going over my head. What I am<br/>wanting to do is use an extraordinarily cheap Fender knockoff electric<br/>guitar (called a Saturday Night Special) that had 22 frets-- and turn it<br/>into something with the same range, but having all the frets &quot;in<br/>between&quot;...

What you are looking for is a 24tet guitar, and you could<br/>cetainly describe the modification as adding the 1.5 fret, 2.5 fret<br/>etc. I have instructions here for refretting your own guitar:<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/guitar.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/guitar.html</a><br/>and they include formulae for calculating the fret positions. On the<br/>other hand, I would be glad to print a chart and post it in my folder<br/>if you will tell me the distance from the nut to the 12th fret on the<br/>guitar you wish to refret.<br/>Staggered frets like you propose in the last part of the quote are<br/>very difficult to cut, and I don&apos;t recommend it unless you are making<br/>a justly intoned guitar a la Jon Catler (in which case you have no<br/>choice). For an equal temered 24 fret per octave number like you<br/>propose, the best way is to just put in 24 frets straight across.</p></div><h3><a id=147 href="#147">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 12:20:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Dave X &lt;davex@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, when you were discussing my idea for the 5th and 6th frets,</p><p>strings?</p><p>&gt; did<br/>&gt; that mean that I was correct, and that this would work (although<br/>&gt; decreasing the range of the guitar)?</p><p>Yes.
