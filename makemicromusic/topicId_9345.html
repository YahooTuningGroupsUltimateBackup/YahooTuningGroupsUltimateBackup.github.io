Finally,<br/>after 3 long months of waiting, I have received my re-necked 22-tET<br/>strat from Carruthers.  Let me tell you, the myths about that man<br/>are true: this is the most flawless job I&apos;ve ever laid eyes on.<br/>Worth every penny of the $400 + shipping.  I&apos;ll post pics as soon as<br/>I have internet at home (I moved early last week, and I&apos;ve yet to<br/>get my new headquarters fully operational).  Likewise, I&apos;ll post<br/>some pics of the completed bass tubulong (1 octave span, 14 out of<br/>22-tET, 3/4&quot; pipes ranging from approx 3 ft. to about ?2/3 of that?)<br/>unless Stevie beats me to it.</p><p>So, we&apos;ve dived right in to it.  Stevie and I are currently working<br/>on what is probably the world&apos;s first pop/rock song in the Porcupine-<br/>8 scale, and I&apos;ve got a few decatonic-based ideas that could<br/>probably be knit into a full-length composition.  Sometime within<br/>the month, Stevie and I are going to record somewhere in the<br/>neighborhood of 3 or 4 songs in the 22-tET to make a little demo,<br/>which will feature our multi-instrumental talents of guitar, drums<br/>(me), bass, keyboard (Stevie), and tubulong (both of us).  Heck, we<br/>might even attempt some vocals if it we feel we can handle it.  I<br/>think the plan is to possibly distribute this demo on mini-CD to the<br/>SFSU campus at large, with the goal of recruiting more musicians for<br/>the ensemble (and of course raising awareness of microtonal music).</p><p>So be on the lookout! :-&gt;</p></div>
