I once used to get a load of very harsh criticism on my compositional skill saying things like &quot;your instrument is 3 cents out of tune&quot; or &quot;the fifth chord in your progression (a sus4 7) is too standard&quot; or &quot;the slightly plastic-sounding flute ruins the feel of your entire song&quot;.  All the while I spent months polishing out these tiny errors and seeing no improvement in response...until someone had the balls to tell me &quot;your problem is that seems you are forcing yourself to make the song and not enjoying it...that comes across in the mood: it sounds like an academic exercise not an expression of emotion&quot;.  And from then on I made songs probably with more technical/academic errors than the first bunch...but this time with attitude and not stressing the theory so much...and they did much better.</p><p>   Rather than spend all sorts of effort to make something fit a theory, I figure, a better idea would be to start with you emotions and build the theory around that.  For example, hit notes of arbitrary frequencies that you think sound good together and only then try to tie them to some sort of nearest JI scale.   Another idea...take a look at theory and think &quot;is there any way I can<br/>flip the theory around or extend it in such a way to match what I want<br/>to express?&quot;.  Blues seems to kind of do that indirectly as the 1/4 tone bends hover between major and minor keys and allow the musician/player to choose how much of each he wants to fit the desired mood: it essentially &quot;bends&quot; 12TET theory to fit between two different moods at once, rather than just be stuck with one.</p><p>   A summary: I think theory can turn an ok musician into a good one...but not a good one to a great one.  To me the best theory is one that opens up more possibilities, rather than tells you half the things you wanted to do musically are &quot;illegal&quot;  ...And if the theory you&apos;ve learned does that (IE the idea that minor seconds in chords must sound very tense), try to find a theory or develop one in such a way you can, say, get something that feels like a minor second but does not sound very tense.</p><p>    A side note...I think some of the main challenges facing micro-tonal theory are typically<br/>A) That it is usually heavily academic (IE why are so few people on these lists not music professors or those with music degrees...are normal musicians simply not allowed or are we just making the subject matter sound too intimidating to attract them?)<br/>B) That it is usually be primarily based around classical music (which a very small percentage of people listen to)<br/>C) That forms of it used most often are either so close to 12TET novice listeners can&apos;t tell or so dissonant they think it&apos;s chaotic (a few exceptions I&apos;ve found: 22TET octa-tonic scales, Wilson&apos;s 6-tone MOS scales, Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales)<br/>D) The fact so many scales require either a lot of theory to play well in (IE it is often much easier than in 12TET to hit sour chords by accident)<br/>E) Fitting it to physical instruments well and getting support for it incorporated into more music software.  For these reasons I am strongly against the idea of too much prevalence of huge ET (IE 34TET+) instruments scaring the daylights out of people who&apos;ve never seen a micro-tonal instrument and making them think &quot;wow that has to be impossible to play...what kind of weird rocket science is this (get me out of here)?&quot;</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=21844 href="#21844">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;danterosati@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2010 8:40:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; However, the best minds make complex ideas understandable to many people -<br/>&gt; including those not in the field.</p><p>Beethoven makes complex ideas understandable to many people, but those<br/>ideas are not describable by music theory!

But I&apos;d wager they be much more effective behind a 19-ET<br/>guitar.  Theory told us.

Thus, many of us complain modern pop music does not have much variation...and, in fact, pop-musicians appear to follow said above theory closer than most classical musicians (past and present)...so religiously it&apos;s to the point it appears to stifle their freedom to add variation since they have such strict standards for &quot;staying on theme&quot;.  The extreme is to take a single motif and simply alter the phasing and instrument choice for different parts to a song to &quot;obey the theory&quot; more...which gives us songs like Mr. Oizo&apos;s &quot;Flat Beat&quot; and DJ Jean&apos;s &quot;The Launch&quot; (perhaps the most repetitive and annoying dance songs ever).</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21873 href="#21873">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2010 1:22:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes. You use your analytical side to explain after your intuitive side<br/>has figured out what&apos;s going on.</p><p>This ties back in with the discussion about puns on the tuning list,<br/>and one of the original points Carl made: 12-equal is not just a<br/>meantone temperament.</p><p>Common practice theory revolves around meantone temperament. And guys<br/>playing jazz in the 20th century didn&apos;t really care much about that,<br/>and started exploring other &quot;puns&quot; available in 12-tet and such. You<br/>could say that the concept of tritone substitution involves the<br/>intuitive realization that 49/48 is tempered out in 12-tet, or that<br/>all of the hip quartal and modal stuff jazz guys like to do these days<br/>in which the I chord is a dom7 envisions 12-tet as a dominant<br/>temperament. You could say that Coltrane started to delve into 12-tet<br/>as an augmented temperament, and that Debussy explored its potential<br/>as a diminished temperament (and several thousand other temperaments<br/>that I can&apos;t even imagine). And so on and so on.</p><p>And this is why music theory is supposed to be descriptive, rather<br/>than proscriptive. Had these guys had their heads stuck in<br/>meantone-based common practice theory, they would have never<br/>considered any of this. In fact, Debussy clashed with his more<br/>&quot;formal&quot; teachers about his harmonic ideas all the time. But instead,<br/>he stuck with the principles he intuitively knew to be right, and in<br/>so doing almost singlehandedly invented modern harmony. You could say<br/>that he started to delve into regular mapping without even realizing<br/>it.</p><p>Of course, now that we finally have the ability to say from an<br/>analytical standpoint that he was right and his teachers were wrong.<br/>So now that we can more accurately describe theoretically some of the<br/>developments of the last century&apos;s worth of music, it would be foolish<br/>not to.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, Feb 22, 2010 at 3:51 PM, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; yes, because the music theorist&apos;s job (with in this context) is to explain<br/>&gt; why what you did worked, after the fact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Feb 22, 2010 at 3:44 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Carl&gt;&quot;YMMV, but what I think is clear is that the theory is audible in<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; the final product, whether you like it or not.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Bizarre.

To them, it&apos;s as if the entire world of chords must exist mostly below the 8th harmonic or so (IE a 5:6:8 chord).<br/>   I agree even things I have complained in the past about as being too simple of forms of variation (IE mean-tone scales) in micro-tonallity still open up chords (and the moods which come with them) which are impossible in 12TET.  Of course, so do Marcel&apos;s scales.  Another way to state our mission on this list, which perhaps some of you can answer, is this<br/>A) What extra possibilities can micro-tonallity offer today&apos;s musicians and how can different theories be used to provide different possibilities?<br/>B) How do all of these play into the creation of certain moods in music, particularly moods relatively in-accessible in 12TET?</p><p>-Michael</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21877 href="#21877">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2010 5:57:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Quite frankly, I  don&apos;t care about the general 12 tet music scene in this<br/>respect.</p><p> It is not my mission to make them compose music as I want to compose or<br/>hear music.</p><p>My goal is to compose music good enough (like Sean, Carlo, Dan S. and others<br/>here) that no one cares it is microtonal.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Feb 22, 2010 at 4:34 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Again the problem a lot of people seem to run into is they idea there<br/>&gt; must<br/>&gt; be only one theory..&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris&gt;&quot;I would have hope that no one so closed minded is on this or the<br/>&gt; tuning<br/>&gt; list.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was talking about the popular music scene in general...specifically in<br/>&gt; their typical use of 12TET without trying to twist anything around (IE<br/>&gt; diatonic tone rows and such).<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21878 href="#21878">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2010 6:00:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; My goal is to compose music good enough (like Sean, Carlo, Dan S. and others<br/>&gt; here) that no one cares it is microtonal.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=21879 href="#21879">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2010 7:09:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; My goal is to compose music good enough (like Sean, Carlo, Dan S. and<br/>&gt; others<br/>&gt; &gt; here) that no one cares it is microtonal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Amen.</p><p>Yes I agree too.<br/>Though I&apos;m hoping that with enough microtonal theory, the microtonal part<br/>will actually become a plus even in the general public&apos;s ears unlike it is<br/>today (rightfully so imho)</p><p>Marcel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
