I&apos;ve always *loved* Nancarrow<br/>going back to the late 70&apos;s when I first hear his music before it<br/>became so widely known.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if he has anything much in &quot;alternate tunings&quot; but it<br/>makes little difference, since he&apos;s such an individualist.</p><p>I remember a *great* concert that Joel Sachs did in New York in the<br/>mid 80&apos;s and Nancarrow was *here* for it.  That was unusual since it<br/>was hard for him to travel to the States, since, as you know, he got<br/>on the wrong side of the &quot;authorities.&quot;</p><p>But just the idea of going on like that, and using the player piano<br/>instead of performers -- due to his disdain for their limitations and<br/>the inability to get good performers in Mexico City -- was an<br/>incredible feat.  And, ironically, what might have been a liability<br/>turned into his greatest asset, since the key to his fame was the<br/>fact that he did something that nobody else did...</p><p>He makes Harry Partch, with his comparatively larger number of<br/>performances, seem almost &quot;outgoing...&quot;  :)</p><p>J.
