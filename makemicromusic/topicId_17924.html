I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>nearly so cranky if I hadn&apos;t spent 20 minutes vainly trying to find the<br/>music somewhere after clicking the button which says, &quot;Click Here To<br/>Listen&quot; and &quot;Play&quot;.</p><p>I loathe and despise registration with a passion purple; however, I&apos;ll<br/>often comply for a noble cause -- and if warned ahead of time. I find<br/>the phrases &quot;Click Here To Listen&quot; and &quot;Play&quot; to be unfortunately<br/>misleading -- they imply immediate access to the music itself. Perhaps<br/>amending those sentences to &quot;REGISTER/LOG-IN FIRST, Then Click Here To<br/>Listen&quot; or &quot;REGISTRATION/LOG-IN REQUIRED To Play&quot; might be kinder and<br/>gentler to irritable eccentrics, such as yours truly... :-D</p><p>jlsmith</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jarod.dcamp&quot; &lt;jarod.dcamp@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few people mentioned they were having trouble listening to the radio<br/>&gt; last week.
