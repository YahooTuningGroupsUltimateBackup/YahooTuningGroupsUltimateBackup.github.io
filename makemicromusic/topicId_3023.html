Meru that produced<br/>impressively deep, tolling<br/>                                       reverberations--a battered reed<br/>organ and two<br/>                                       stringed instruments hidden<br/>behind the stage. There<br/>                                       was no need to adjust one&apos;s ears<br/>for alternative tuning<br/>systems; this music had an allure and beauty that<br/> communicated immediately.</p><p> The prologue, where a silhouetted hand holding a ball gave way to<br/>projections of a<br/>                                       comet flying through outer space,<br/>was a most striking sequence--and one&apos;s hopes<br/>                                       immediately went up. Alas, the<br/>ensemble&apos;s sonic splendors were then lavished<br/>                                       upon a piece of silliness<br/>burdened with antic barbed voices and so-called humor<br/>                                       whose chief reference point was<br/>not the imaginary South Seas island of Anaphoria<br/>but good old Southern California (with mentions of McDonald&apos;s, the Santa<br/>Monica<br/>Mountains, energy bars, Charlton Heston, etc.)</p><p>                                       The shadow play was credited to<br/>an &quot;author&quot; named Isafa--and according to the<br/>                                       program notes, &quot;Rumors have<br/>varied from Isafa being a woman of notoriety to<br/>                                       Isafa being a collective<br/>endeavor.&quot; If you had written this play, you might want to<br/>                                       hide behind &quot;rumors&quot; too.
