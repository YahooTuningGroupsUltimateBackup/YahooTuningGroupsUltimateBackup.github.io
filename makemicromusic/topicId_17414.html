As a matter-of-fact, it was the dueling pairs of distorted<br/>fifths and maj thirds as well as the inclusion of the exotic Javanese<br/>like 5-tone equal temperament that initially led me to try this<br/>tuning. A curious byproduct of this tuning on a guitar is the unique<br/>ability to tune the open strings exclusively in fourths (at 2/5ths of<br/>an octave) and still retain the traditional EADGBE arrangement- -so in<br/>cents this would be 420, 900, 180, 660, 1140 and back to E at 420<br/>again.</p><p>Besides the 20-tone equal temperament electric, I also have a<br/>beautiful 24-tone equal temperament quartertone &quot;Spanish Nail&quot;<br/>Stienberger made by the amazing Chris Shaffer:</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobuc">http://i24.photobuc</a> <a href="http://ket.com/albums/">ket.com/albums/</a> c33/dans. ..onefinished. jpg</p><p>I also have two fretless electrics right now. One is a Les Paul with<br/>a zero radius aluminum fingerboard that was made by Rick Canton :</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobuc">http://i24.photobuc</a> <a href="http://ket.com/albums/">ket.com/albums/</a> c33/dans. ..ns/P1140102. jpg</p><p>The other fretless is an old Kramer that I originally took the frets<br/>off of planning to refret it to something new. But I ended up playing<br/>it as is, so it&apos;s a fretless where the fret slots were never even<br/>filled in--note the colored grease pencil micro markers :</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobuc">http://i24.photobuc</a> <a href="http://ket.com/albums/">ket.com/albums/</a> c33/dans. ../P1010021_ 1.jpg</p><p>One other fretless instrument I get a lot of use out of is a three<br/>string fretless baritone ukulele--and depending on the context, this<br/>instrument also neatly doubles as an acoustic fretless piccolo bass:</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobuc">http://i24.photobuc</a> <a href="http://ket.com/albums/">ket.com/albums/</a> c33/dans. ..ns/P7070004. jpg</p><p>I also have two other instruments that were customized by Chris<br/>Shaffer. One is a tenor ukulele that I had fretted to a maximally<br/>even 8-out-of-13 subset of 13-tone equal temperament.</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobuc">http://i24.photobuc</a> <a href="http://ket.com/albums/">ket.com/albums/</a> c33/dans. ../P4290289_ 2.jpg</p><p>Thirteen-tone equal temperament is almost exclusively mentioned in<br/>tuning theory with a negative connotation- -as a sort of pinnacle of<br/>atonality and discordance. But sometimes things need a different<br/>perspective, and trying to compare 13-tone equal temperament and<br/>common practice tertian harmony is really quite counterproductive.<br/>There are many truly beautiful scales and subsets in 13-tone equal<br/>temperament, and this 8-out-of-13 contains a wonderful 7-tone scale<br/>at 0 2 3 7 8 10 11 13.</p><p>The other Shaffer&apos; job was a six string banjo-guitar that retained<br/>the standard 12-tone equal temperament but was augmented with five<br/>additional Just Intonated notes, 33/32, 7/6, 11/8, 14/9 and 7/4:</p><p><a href="http://i24.photobuc">http://i24.photobuc</a> <a href="http://ket.com/albums/">ket.com/albums/</a> c33/dans. ..ns/P9170121. jpg</p><p>This gives a 17-tone octave, and this arrangement represents three<br/>separate one-dimensional planes of 3, 7 and 11 limit ratios. It also<br/>rather nicely approximates a 3, 5, 7 and 11-limit grid, and the banjo<br/>resonator wonderfully melds these relations in an ambient, organic<br/>haze.</p><p>Abandoning tradition in this way is not for everyone of course. Nor<br/>should it be, but for me it was a natural progression of my<br/>interests, so I never really questioned it too much. Over the years<br/>I&apos;ve come to feel that the beauty is in the work, and that forward<br/>momentum is waking up curious.</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace">http://www.myspace</a>. com/danstearns</p><p>      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Luggage?

Some people may misuse it, but that doesn&apos;t make it any less precise.  The simplest definition is a mathematical one. There, nth note of the maximally even x from y scale is scale steps</p><p>int(n*y/x)</p><p>in the &quot;from&quot; scale.  That is,</p><p>int(n*y/x)/y octaves.</p><p>The &quot;int&quot; function can be either floor (truncating down), ceil (like floor but going up) or round to nearest with halves rounding up.  Only the starting point changes.  It doesn&apos;t work with rounding or truncating towards zero or banker&apos;s rounding.</p><p>Conceptually, it&apos;s the nearest you can get to x EDO but tuning to y EDO.</p><p>Dan&apos;s rounding to nearest here, which is fine.  That is a maximally even scale.  7 from 12 is</p><p>0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, ...</p><p>and 8 from 13 is</p><p>0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, ...</p><p>I think the original definition was using floor instead, but I don&apos;t have anything to check (or whether the starting point is part of the definition).  But you certainly can&apos;t generalize to arbitrary L and s and call the result maximally even.  It&apos;s only a property of equal temperaments.</p><p>I think this all agrees with</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/m/maximal-evenness.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/m/maximal-evenness.aspx</a></p><p>except for Manuel&apos;s &quot;more general version&quot;.</p><p>All of which unfortunately obscures the fact that maximal evenness with its strict definition is a blindingly simple concept.</p><p>                Graham</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;At 10:32 AM 7/9/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also have two other instruments that were customized by Chris<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shaffer.
