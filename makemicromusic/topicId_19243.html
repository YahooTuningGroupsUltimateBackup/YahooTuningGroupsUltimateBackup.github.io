It<br/>does seem that a lot of people would be interested in contributing to<br/>such a project like this, which is exciting. Although there were a lot<br/>of different ideas thrown around, I think that the main consensus was:</p><p>We need an interactive, microtonal staff GUI that can be played back<br/>in real time.</p><p>This GUI should have a variety of features, including but not limited<br/>to the following:<br/>  - Being cross-platform<br/>  - Having support for multiple notation systems (Sagittal, Decimal,<br/>Sims-Maneri, etc.)<br/>  - Outputting via MIDI and MTS<br/>  - Should somehow integrate with Scala files</p><p>This naturally requires that the score editor has some kind of<br/>sequencer component to it to allow for playback, as well as some kind<br/>of GUI for the staff notation. From what I think we all decided, that<br/>it plays back correctly and is graphically usable is a higher priority<br/>than it looking good for printing: more of a linear scrolling<br/>Sonar/Cakewalk &quot;Staff View&quot; than a Sibelius &quot;Score Editor&quot;, at least<br/>at first.</p><p>Secondary objectives that extend this core idea would be things like<br/>the following:<br/>1) A Piano Roll alpha blending overlay on top of the notation<br/>2) Enabling integration with CSound and OSC<br/>3) Enabling integration with VST synths and such<br/>4) Integrating an audio sequencer into the fray<br/>5) Throwing in pitch bend/channel swapping for backwards compatibility<br/>with older synths<br/>6) Expanding the idea or creating a full score-editing suite a la<br/>Finale or Sibelius</p><p>But those should be tackled only after we get the first part going.</p><p>So far as I can remember, I think these are the main pathways forward<br/>that we have found so far:</p><p>1) Canorus, as Graham pointed out, is a cross-platform score editor.<br/>It builds off of an older KDE score-editor called NoteEdit, and the<br/>developers of Lilypond and MusicABC are involved. We could either<br/>lobby for microtonal features from them, and at some point fork off<br/>from them. (<a href="http://canorus.berlios.de/">http://canorus.berlios.de/</a>)</p><p>2) Rosegarden is a very powerful DAW that has score editing, a piano<br/>roll, and audio integration already done - but it&apos;s Linux only. Talk<br/>of porting the GUI to Qt4, a cross-platform GUI, has been thrown<br/>around on the Rosegarden-devel list for years, and they seem to be<br/>very, very slowly moving forward with that objective. The main<br/>hindrance with the porting, from what I gather, has nothing to do with<br/>GUI, but rather that all of the audio stuff is hardcoded to work with<br/>Linux&apos;s ALSA/JACK drivers, which we don&apos;t need to worry about to get a<br/>score editor... for now. (<a href="http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/">http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/</a>)</p><p>3) MusicKit, which looks very promising, is a non-GPL but free<br/>library/API to use, which apparently does almost anything. I haven&apos;t<br/>done as much research into this one as I have the other ones, but it<br/>does seem very, very interesting, and might make it very easy to<br/>proceed. (<a href="http://musickit.sourceforge.net/">http://musickit.sourceforge.net/</a>)</p><p>4) TSE3 is a GUI-less MIDI and audio sequencer library. We can build a<br/>notation GUI straight on top of this.

It is currently being ported to wxwidgets.<br/>From what I can tell from the Google images results for &quot;Jazz++&quot;, it<br/>has a piano roll, a &quot;Harmony Generator&quot; which might be useful to turn<br/>into some kind of a lambdoma, but no staff editor. It does look a<br/>little rough around the edges, and its website isn&apos;t all that helpful.<br/>(<a href="http://jazzplusplus.sourceforge.net/">http://jazzplusplus.sourceforge.net/</a>)</p><p>6) ABC/MicroABC, Lilypond, etc. could possibly be modified to be<br/>interactive, or have a front end created around them. Rosegarden, to<br/>some extent, extends Lilypond in such a way. If people like the way<br/>Lilypond looks, it might be nice to take its graphic library, modify<br/>it, and integrate it with TSE3, or something like that. This one might<br/>not even prove feasible in the end, but it was discussed in the<br/>thread.</p><p>I think those were the ones talked about, although if I&apos;ve forgotten<br/>any please let me know. Some of these approaches are easier than<br/>others - it may very well be easier to fork from Canorus than to make<br/>a front end for Lilypond or port Rosegarden, for example.</p><p>And at least for now, the discussion on what language we should<br/>program in and whether we should use .NET or some kind of managed code<br/>should be put on hold for a bit until we get the main bits like this<br/>sorted out. As the issue is already slightly raised by virtue of the<br/>notion that we should fork off of existing projects, I will say that<br/>this project, if people are willing to contribute to it, will go a lot<br/>faster and much more smoothly if we are open to forking off from<br/>existing projects that are in a huge range of languages. There are<br/>people on the list that prefer Python, there are people that prefer<br/>C++, and we even had a discussion about C# as a middle ground... So to<br/>be blunt, people will have to be willing to work in C++, just as I<br/>will have to be willing to work in Python, if we want to maximize our<br/>range of options and get the best possible result.</p><p>Note also that some of these options would give us the secondary<br/>objectives right away: Rosegarden, if we do manage to port it, will<br/>give us audio and VST integration right off the bat. And Canorus aims<br/>to be a score editor, so we&apos;d have that secondary objective<br/>accomplished. I do think that we will need to eventually fork off from<br/>the Canorus route though, as even if they do implement some kind of<br/>microtonal features in their software, new ideas seem to come out of<br/>tuning and MMM at a fairly rapid rate. Unless Canorus latches onto the<br/>microtonal community&apos;s wants and needs, which are considerably more<br/>difficult to implement than what would be expected by a normal score<br/>editor, I see us having a project designed mainly by and for us, a la<br/>Scala.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2008 1:11:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>I&apos;ve gone over your message and all the features and functions that<br/>you&apos;d like to see in this project.

Having just the score editor in<br/>which you can move notes around but not hear what they sound like won&apos;t help<br/>me really. So if the score can play back what it has, that is a sequencer.</p><p>&gt;&gt;2) Enabling integration with CSound and OSC<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m strongly in favor of MIDI and OSC. I don&apos;t really get the<br/>&gt; csound part. You want to output csound score files or something?</p><p>I mean that the root of the program should be the notation/sequencer and<br/>work with MIDI. Being as people love Csound, it might be nice to make it so<br/>they can use their Csound instruments as an output. There&apos;s a Csound VST<br/>wrapper, I think, which means that this would be tackled with the<br/>implementation of VST&apos;s. But I&apos;m mainly saying that these things should be<br/>secondary objectives to be tackled once we get the MIDI core down.</p><p>As for OSC, I think it would be good if we started with MIDI to get things<br/>rolling, and once we get that part of the program down, we&apos;ll add OSC<br/>support and stuff.</p><p>&gt;&gt;3) Enabling integration with VST synths and such<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MIDI&apos;ll do that.</p><p>I suppose it will. I don&apos;t know much about the VST spec, but I thought it<br/>might be apt to get that part set up after we get just basic MIDI stuff<br/>functioning.</p><p>&gt;&gt;4) Integrating an audio sequencer into the fray<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As already stated, I don&apos;t agree with this goal.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s a lofty goal. I would like to leave it open to be implemented in<br/>the future if there is the time and interest for it. That&apos;s why I put it<br/>down as a secondary objective - a possible extension.</p><p>In other words, I don&apos;t want to hardcode AGAINST having audio sequencing if<br/>possible - else in the future, when that bridge is crossed, it&apos;ll be a<br/>nightmare to implement.</p><p>&gt;&gt;6) Expanding the idea or creating a full score-editing suite a la<br/>&gt;&gt;Finale or Sibelius<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m definitely interested in the latter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;But those should be tackled only after we get the first part going.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to do a generalized score editor from start to finish.</p><p>I thought you were saying that your main goal was to have a linear scrolling<br/>timeline kind of thing, not an actual score editor?</p><p>&gt;&gt;1) Canorus, as Graham pointed out, is a cross-platform score editor.<br/>&gt;&gt;It builds off of an older KDE score-editor called NoteEdit, and the<br/>&gt;&gt;developers of Lilypond and MusicABC are involved.

Before discussing branching off it might be worth more<br/>thought about patitioning the problem better so that significant parts<br/>of the work can be based existing projects without branching. For<br/>example it might be good to standardize on an extensible text notation<br/>(or API) system that multiple score editors could sit on top of. A<br/>clear boundary layer for generating sound would make it easier to port<br/>to different audio platforms. The key split is for score<br/>representation levels to be ignorant of sound production details and<br/>vice versa. This sounds simple and obvious but of the almost hundreds<br/>of audio/music software tools out there each seems to partition in a<br/>different way.</p><p>My own gut feel is that we want several API layers each with a one to<br/>one text representation that can be used independently. Lower layers<br/>should focus more on generality and portability. I&apos;m sort of thinking<br/>about something like the iso network stack. That model is tremendously<br/>powerful because it makes clear just which layer you want to replace<br/>to splice in a new platform(bottom) or application (top.)</p><p>It is all well and good to say we want to branch off and do our own<br/>thing but the investment required is tremendous. What we really want<br/>to do is mostly use someone elses well supported packages where we can<br/>and branch off only where our needs are truly unique so our limited<br/>resources can be spent on our unique needs.</p><p>I think your list is an excellent place to start. The next step is to<br/>try and fit it into a layer strategy. I think if this is done cleverly<br/>you will discover more existing stuff can be used and less new stuff<br/>will be required than you imagine which is a good things because then<br/>it might happen.</p><p>This is not a good group for most of the discussion because the<br/>required skill set for much of it is software engineering. This list<br/>represents the end users, composers, performers etc. Their large egos<br/>will guarantee strong opinions about everything (it is not a shy or<br/>particularly modest crowd) but should be trusted mostly for defining<br/>&quot;user&quot; requirements. There is a subset here that can contribute a lot<br/>to the software engineering discussion but an alternate list should be<br/>considered to babysit development issues. Just look at the thread you<br/>are replacing. It is a long winded thread full of interesting,<br/>strongly stated but mostly irrelevant posts by posters who lost track<br/>of the purpose of the thread. A yahoo group devoted to the creation of<br/>a micro tuning tool chain would be easier to keep focused. I suggest<br/>you start one, or if you like I will start one for you since I have<br/>done it before.</p><p>On Mon, Jul 7, 2008 at 4:03 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Being as the other thread has slowly drifted away from the discussion<br/>&gt; of software development and headed toward a discussion of different<br/>&gt; compositional methods and preferences, I thought I&apos;d make this one to<br/>&gt; reignite that original discussion and sum up where we are so far.

Before discussing branching off it might be worth more<br/>&gt; thought about patitioning the problem better so that significant parts<br/>&gt; of the work can be based existing projects without branching. For<br/>&gt; example it might be good to standardize on an extensible text notation<br/>&gt; (or API) system that multiple score editors could sit on top of. A<br/>&gt; clear boundary layer for generating sound would make it easier to port<br/>&gt; to different audio platforms. The key split is for score<br/>&gt; representation levels to be ignorant of sound production details and<br/>&gt; vice versa. This sounds simple and obvious but of the almost hundreds<br/>&gt; of audio/music software tools out there each seems to partition in a<br/>&gt; different way.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean here... We weren&apos;t going to have an actual<br/>sound generator as part of the design.

I&apos;m all for that. I think that is actually the route<br/>we should take, as it would be more expandable later on.</p><p>&gt; My own gut feel is that we want several API layers each with a one to<br/>&gt; one text representation that can be used independently. Lower layers<br/>&gt; should focus more on generality and portability. I&apos;m sort of thinking<br/>&gt; about something like the iso network stack. That model is tremendously<br/>&gt; powerful because it makes clear just which layer you want to replace<br/>&gt; to splice in a new platform(bottom) or application (top.)</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if we&apos;re talking about the same thing, but one model I<br/>had floating around was something like this:</p><p>Layer 3: Different GUI&apos;s that take the event list and display the<br/>information in different ways - Staff, Piano Roll, etc.<br/>Layer 2: Event list. Stores note information as well as anything else we want.<br/>Layer 1: MIDI/Sequencer API&apos;s</p><p>&gt; It is all well and good to say we want to branch off and do our own<br/>&gt; thing but the investment required is tremendous. What we really want<br/>&gt; to do is mostly use someone elses well supported packages where we can<br/>&gt; and branch off only where our needs are truly unique so our limited<br/>&gt; resources can be spent on our unique needs.</p><p>Agreed.

I have to investigate deeply into both of those<br/>though.</p><p>&gt; I think your list is an excellent place to start. The next step is to<br/>&gt; try and fit it into a layer strategy.

There is a subset here that can contribute a lot<br/>&gt; to the software engineering discussion but an alternate list should be<br/>&gt; considered to babysit development issues.

A LOT of<br/>&gt;people, actually.</p><p>Prent uses it, but I didn&apos;t get the sense he&apos;s interested in a<br/>score editor.  Graham has used it, but says a score editor is<br/>a waste of time.  Hans may be interested.  Steve was interested<br/>in using it via Blue.  Who did I miss?</p><p>&gt;&gt; First of all, I think you mean VSTi, as plain VST is effects only,<br/>&gt;&gt; as the data sent to plain VST components is I think audio only.<br/>&gt;&gt; With VSTi, I think the data simply includes MIDI, but I could be<br/>&gt;&gt; completely wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yeah, I&apos;m talking about Kontakt, Pianoteq, FM8, etc.</p><p>As a funny coincidence, all of those synths have standalone modes<br/>that can accept MIDI from a virtual MIDI port.  Synths without a<br/>standalone mode can be hosted in any VSTi host you like (I like<br/>REAPER and Brainspawn Forte) and recieve our MIDI there, where it<br/>can render to PCM and sequenced to your heart&apos;s delight.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Why not make a separate app for audio? And audio sequencers<br/>&gt;&gt; are already tuning-agnostic. So what functionality, exactly, are<br/>&gt;&gt; you after?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why make a separate app for audio? Audio isn&apos;t even the focus now.<br/>&gt;Here&apos;s what I&apos;m saying:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We pick an abstraction model in which there are &quot;events&quot; that are<br/>&gt;&quot;played&quot; somehow. If these events are MIDI notes, then corresponding<br/>&gt;note ons and offs are played via MIDI. If they are OSC events, then<br/>&gt;they are played via OSC. This kind of model means that if we want to<br/>&gt;incorporate audio, we simply come up with an audio &quot;event&quot; which would<br/>&gt;be a pointer to some PCM data in memory and such.</p><p>What functionality, exactly, are you after?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Fullblown score editor. Just without some sort of 15th-century<br/>&gt;&gt; obsession with printing at the core of the architecture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What do you mean?</p><p>I already explained it but we can flesh it out more if we can get<br/>on the same page with the basics (see above).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2008 7:04:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Many of us cannot hear directly from the score.

I&apos;ve said about a thousand<br/>times that if we throw in a track view and audio and channel<br/>swapping/pitch bending and all of these little bells and whistles,<br/>we&apos;re going to do it much, much later on. And so I don&apos;t understand<br/>how it could affect the progress of the score editor, since we&apos;re<br/>focusing on the score editor first. Designing the code to be<br/>expandable won&apos;t &quot;bog down&quot; the project. If anything, NOT designing<br/>the code to be expandable would be what bogs down the project.</p><p>My focus is that we have to be sensitive to people&apos;s needs. And so<br/>this project will be infinitely more useful if we make it, again,<br/>EXPANDABLE. There is no need to take some particular way we can expand<br/>it and then say &quot;this will be too difficult to implement now, so let&apos;s<br/>not make it expandable.&quot; That is a straw man argument.</p><p>My goal for this, my long-term goal, is to someday have a microtonal<br/>composition suite. I want to be able to write orchestral microtonal<br/>music, electronic microtonal music, etc. I have gotten very good at<br/>composing in DAW environments, in the scoring environments, etc. I<br/>find text-based environments hard to work on, and so I want to have<br/>this notation GUI, as do you.</p><p>Some day, I&apos;d also like to have a lot of things that you probably<br/>don&apos;t care about, and you&apos;d like to have a lot of things I probably<br/>don&apos;t care about. I could say &quot;let&apos;s ignore the alpha blending piano<br/>roll, as it would bog down the project.&quot; But, as a way to make the<br/>project even better, I&apos;d rather say &quot;let&apos;s make sure we modularize our<br/>code successfully, and then you can make your piano roll, and I&apos;ll<br/>make my track view, and the product will appeal to a wider audience.&quot;</p><p>The starting point for this all is the notation GUI, and a lot of<br/>people are interested in that. Eventually, once that&apos;s done, I might<br/>go on and add audio, and then there will be people who don&apos;t care<br/>about that and don&apos;t participate, and new people who do. But I hope<br/>you realize that hardcoding this in such a way that we are not<br/>sensitive to the adding of potential features in the future completely<br/>invalidates the usefulness of this project for me.</p><p>In other words: rather than argue about what features we&apos;ll add in the<br/>future, let&apos;s make it easy to add whatever features we WANT in the<br/>future, and deal with avoiding bloat later. In the meantime, let&apos;s<br/>tackle the problem of the notation GUI now.

It<br/>&gt; does seem that a lot of people would be interested in contributing to<br/>&gt; such a project like this, which is exciting. Although there were a lot<br/>&gt; of different ideas thrown around, I think that the main consensus was:<br/>&gt; &gt; We need an interactive, microtonal staff GUI that can be played back<br/>&gt; in real time.</p><p>That sounds right.  I drew a distinction between a sequencer and a score editor before.  What it seems we want is a simple score editor with basic audio support (probably via MIDI).  And the immediate goal is to explore new notations, not to produce the best printed scores or MIDI performances.   The distant goal is for perfect score output and some fuzzy idea of a composition system.</p><p>&gt; This GUI should have a variety of features, including but not limited<br/>&gt; to the following:<br/>&gt;   - Being cross-platform<br/>&gt;   - Having support for multiple notation systems (Sagittal, Decimal,<br/>&gt; Sims-Maneri, etc.)<br/>&gt;   - Outputting via MIDI and MTS<br/>&gt;   - Should somehow integrate with Scala files</p><p>Looks good.</p><p>&gt; This naturally requires that the score editor has some kind of<br/>&gt; sequencer component to it to allow for playback, as well as some kind<br/>&gt; of GUI for the staff notation. From what I think we all decided, that<br/>&gt; it plays back correctly and is graphically usable is a higher priority<br/>&gt; than it looking good for printing: more of a linear scrolling<br/>&gt; Sonar/Cakewalk &quot;Staff View&quot; than a Sibelius &quot;Score Editor&quot;, at least<br/>&gt; at first.</p><p>I say a score editor is the target.  The internal representation of notes should reflect staff notation, not MIDI.  It should also be as easy as possible to enter notes in the score view.  We have to accept that it won&apos;t be as powerful as Sibelius at first.  Unfortunately that means very few people will be interested in it but it&apos;s worth a try anyway.</p><p>&gt; Secondary objectives that extend this core idea would be things like<br/>&gt; the following:<br/>&gt; 1) A Piano Roll alpha blending overlay on top of the notation</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>&gt; 2) Enabling integration with CSound and OSC</p><p>No need unless it&apos;s a *primary* goal (which it obviously isn&apos;t).</p><p>&gt; 3) Enabling integration with VST synths and such</p><p>No need.</p><p>&gt; 4) Integrating an audio sequencer into the fray</p><p>No.  Audio sequencers are different beasts to score editors.   Things you need for audio can&apos;t naturally be represented in staff notation.  A good quality performance depends on low-level MIDI editing.  The details of MIDI can&apos;t be well represented in staff notation and vice-versa.  We need to decide what we want from the outset -- a score editor that does MIDI or a sequencer with a score view.</p><p>&gt; 5) Throwing in pitch bend/channel swapping for backwards compatibility<br/>&gt; with older synths</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; 6) Expanding the idea or creating a full score-editing suite a la<br/>&gt; Finale or Sibelius</p><p>There should always be room for expansion in that direction.</p><p>&gt; But those should be tackled only after we get the first part going.<br/>&gt; &gt; So far as I can remember, I think these are the main pathways forward<br/>&gt; that we have found so far:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Canorus, as Graham pointed out, is a cross-platform score editor.<br/>&gt; It builds off of an older KDE score-editor called NoteEdit, and the<br/>&gt; developers of Lilypond and MusicABC are involved. We could either<br/>&gt; lobby for microtonal features from them, and at some point fork off<br/>&gt; from them. (<a href="http://canorus.berlios.de/">http://canorus.berlios.de/</a>)</p><p>It looks good.  I suggest we contact the development team ASAP.</p><p>What I suggest is not a fork.  Maybe a branch.  They&apos;re going to be working on improving its general score editing features and we need to roll in those changes.  The more cooperation they give us the better.  If possible we join the project.  If not we maintain a patch against it or plug-ins.</p><p>&gt; 2) Rosegarden is a very powerful DAW that has score editing, a piano<br/>&gt; roll, and audio integration already done - but it&apos;s Linux only. Talk<br/>&gt; of porting the GUI to Qt4, a cross-platform GUI, has been thrown<br/>&gt; around on the Rosegarden-devel list for years, and they seem to be<br/>&gt; very, very slowly moving forward with that objective. The main<br/>&gt; hindrance with the porting, from what I gather, has nothing to do with<br/>&gt; GUI, but rather that all of the audio stuff is hardcoded to work with<br/>&gt; Linux&apos;s ALSA/JACK drivers, which we don&apos;t need to worry about to get a<br/>&gt; score editor... for now. (<a href="http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/">http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/</a>)</p><p>It&apos;s a sequencer with good notation support.  My (second hand) information is that the development team is not at all interested in microtonal support.  Jack should move to Windows with the rest of KDE.  If the Rosegarden team don&apos;t have a plan for this it worries me.  It suggests their code-base is getting bloated.</p><p>&gt; 3) MusicKit, which looks very promising, is a non-GPL but free<br/>&gt; library/API to use, which apparently does almost anything. I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; done as much research into this one as I have the other ones, but it<br/>&gt; does seem very, very interesting, and might make it very easy to<br/>&gt; proceed. (<a href="http://musickit.sourceforge.net/">http://musickit.sourceforge.net/</a>)</p><p>It shares a common ancestor with Csound, doesn&apos;t it?  How is it relevant?</p><p>&gt; 4) TSE3 is a GUI-less MIDI and audio sequencer library. We can build a<br/>&gt; notation GUI straight on top of this. (<a href="http://tse3.sourceforge.net/">http://tse3.sourceforge.net/</a>)</p><p>I don&apos;t like the idea of GUI-less.  Too much work for us.</p><p>&gt; 5) Jazz++ is a cross platform MIDI and audio editor that Hans Straub<br/>&gt; pointed out some time ago. It is currently being ported to wxwidgets.<br/>&gt;&gt;From what I can tell from the Google images results for &quot;Jazz++&quot;, it<br/>&gt; has a piano roll, a &quot;Harmony Generator&quot; which might be useful to turn<br/>&gt; into some kind of a lambdoma, but no staff editor. It does look a<br/>&gt; little rough around the edges, and its website isn&apos;t all that helpful.<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://jazzplusplus.sourceforge.net/">http://jazzplusplus.sourceforge.net/</a>)</p><p>I used an old version if Jazz and it was a very basic MIDI sequencer.  I followed the Jazz++ development once.  If it&apos;s still rough around the edges I guess it always will be. Rosegarden is the project that succeeded.</p><p>&gt; 6) ABC/MicroABC, Lilypond, etc. could possibly be modified to be<br/>&gt; interactive, or have a front end created around them. Rosegarden, to<br/>&gt; some extent, extends Lilypond in such a way. If people like the way<br/>&gt; Lilypond looks, it might be nice to take its graphic library, modify<br/>&gt; it, and integrate it with TSE3, or something like that. This one might<br/>&gt; not even prove feasible in the end, but it was discussed in the<br/>&gt; thread.</p><p>Rosegarden and Canorus are both front-ends for Lilypond in that sense.  The back-end is largely irrelevant when it comes to writing a score editing GUI.</p><p>Lilypond output is good because you can then tweak it for a printed score.  I think we can customize it for what we need.  I&apos;m still waiting for a reply from Torsten on that.</p><p>&gt; Note also that some of these options would give us the secondary<br/>&gt; objectives right away: Rosegarden, if we do manage to port it, will<br/>&gt; give us audio and VST integration right off the bat. And Canorus aims<br/>&gt; to be a score editor, so we&apos;d have that secondary objective<br/>&gt; accomplished. I do think that we will need to eventually fork off from<br/>&gt; the Canorus route though, as even if they do implement some kind of<br/>&gt; microtonal features in their software, new ideas seem to come out of<br/>&gt; tuning and MMM at a fairly rapid rate. Unless Canorus latches onto the<br/>&gt; microtonal community&apos;s wants and needs, which are considerably more<br/>&gt; difficult to implement than what would be expected by a normal score<br/>&gt; editor, I see us having a project designed mainly by and for us, a la<br/>&gt; Scala.</p><p>I think Canorus is the way to go.  Either Canorus or Rosegarden will mean C++ which is fine with me.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2008 11:42:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;I said, let&apos;s make it so we can expand on the core idea in the future.<br/>&gt;You said, doing the possible expansions now will take too much time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Straw man.

Alas, my own experience in programming a notation program was done back in the upper Pleistocene, so I can only offer encouragement.  But may I point out two features for microtonal notation in existing programs that ought to be emulated, or even better, improved upon?</p><p>First, in Finale, the non-standard key signature feature allows the user to define (a) the number of lines in a staff, (b) the number of tones in an octave, (b) the number and position of nominals (&quot;naturals&quot;) in an octave, (3) the values in +/- steps of accidentals the font and symbols associated with each accidental.  I can get a reasonably good real time composing desktop with this, provided that I output to an external synth or to InTun and then to my computer&apos;s synth.  The limitations are (1) 128 midi notes, (2) no microtonal playback with Finale&apos;s built in synth or Kontakt Player (although once a score is completed, I can export the midi file and use Scala to add pitch bends, then re-import to Finale, so long as I keep each channel monophonic), (3) alternative staff designs are limited to changing the number of lines, not the spacing between lines, a la Klavarskribo or Wilson.</p><p>Second, in Lime, there is a tuning table in which a pitch bend is assigned to each note and accidental combination. This is a great feature, but limited to 35 pitches (= 7 naturals, plus two modifications upwards and two downwards).  I suspect that this limitation is arbitrary, but not certain.

Not sure what the standards on playing a note at<br/>&gt;a certain unusual place is, but I use deviations from the closest<br/>&gt;rhythms or the closest 256th with Sibelius (which the adventurous<br/>&gt;Finale does not even plan to notate in a future ... let&apos;s not even<br/>&gt;mention the horrible customer service!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Just my personal view!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Tony Salinas (melting in Osaka)</p><p>Hi Tony- do you just mean 256th notes, or something more radical?<br/>You&apos;re welcome to reply on the new microtools Google Group,<br/>where we&apos;re trying to move this discussion:</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microtools">http://groups.google.com/group/microtools</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2008 1:03:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel wrote:</p><p>&gt;First, in Finale, the non-standard key signature feature allows the user<br/>&gt;to define (a) the number of lines in a staff, (b) the number of tones in<br/>&gt;an octave, (b) the number and position of nominals (&quot;naturals&quot;) in an<br/>&gt;octave, (3) the values in +/- steps of accidentals the font and symbols<br/>&gt;associated with each accidental.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty comprehensive.
