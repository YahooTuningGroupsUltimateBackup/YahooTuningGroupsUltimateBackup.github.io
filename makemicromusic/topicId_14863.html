What instruments would be available for<br/>17-tone intonation in addition to the string trio? I would like to see a<br/>17- or 34-tone guitar, perhaps viols (or fretted violins), even a<br/>harpsichord...?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>jlsmith</p><p>PS:  Jacob, I e-mailed a congratulatory note to all of you the night of<br/>the concert, but sent it to the &quot;udderbot&quot; address -- so it may still be<br/>sitting there. Just didn&apos;t want you to think I&apos;m an ungrateful<br/>wretch.....  :-)</p></div>
