Goosebumps are better, MUCH better, than key mastery.<br/>GZ</p><p>&quot;D.Stearns&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I agree with many of the points Moses makes here--namely to<br/>&gt; stand on your own two feet and kick butt, I disagree with many others.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try and explain some of this by way of example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I was trying to get players for my live bands, I needed players<br/>&gt; who could read and get things done on little rehearsal time. I worked<br/>&gt; with a lot of very good players who epitomized the Moses standard of<br/>&gt; mastering things by immersing yourself in a lot of varied playing<br/>&gt; situations. Problem is this tends to breed a career student and if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re lucky a seasoned pro, and seasoned pros of this nature are<br/>&gt; better suited for the pit orchestra and the cruise ship gigs and jazz<br/>&gt; with a lowercase j--in short, Moses lite!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was my experience that I had more guitar students who had a better<br/>&gt; grasp of what their strengths were than I had very accomplished<br/>&gt; players in my bands. There&apos;s a big difference between being able and<br/>&gt; capable and playing something because it just has to get out, and this<br/>&gt; is where my &quot;sometimes I think musicians are the worst thing for<br/>&gt; music&quot; attitude comes from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m interested in the people who&apos;ve found a unique way to light up<br/>&gt; music with their presence. This is what interests me, not so-called<br/>&gt; masters or masterful musicians per say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also think Moses makes the process of playing jazz sound somewhat<br/>&gt; akin to scaling Everest backwards in your underwear while blindfolded!<br/>&gt; Being able to play every standard that ever existed in any key at any<br/>&gt; tempo is the sort of thing I was referring to when I said there&apos;s some<br/>&gt; exaggerating going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll settle for someone who can play one song in one key and surprise<br/>&gt; me... give me goosepimples... that&apos;s enough for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; take care,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 19, 2001 8:57 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [MMM] Re: Bob Moses editorial<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everybody,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Amidst some exaggerations and a pretty thick layer of crankiness,<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; think there&apos;s plenty to chew on in this letter Bob Moses sent to<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Boston Phoenix regarding an article they ran entitled &quot;Merenda<br/>&gt; Plays<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mingus&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.amuletrecords.com/bios/moses3.htm">http://www.amuletrecords.com/bios/moses3.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface of it, this may appear to have little to do with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; microtonality, but a lot of the larger issues that are brought up<br/>&gt; &gt; here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; surely do... I&apos;d be interested to hear any thoughts that any of<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; might have regarding these thorny and often contentious issues.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This article was the inspiration for the post on the tuning list<br/>&gt; &gt; which inspired you to write, &quot;sometimes I think musicians are the<br/>&gt; &gt; worst thing for music&quot; . . . Bob Moses is a friend of mine and we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; played on gigs together, so you can understand if I say maybe I let<br/>&gt; &gt; his article get to me a little too much.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       Yahoo!
