Actually had sleep interrupted a fair amount<br/>recently for one reason and another and also been putting it as<br/>low priority, so you are right on about that.</p><p>Possibly some recent bugs may indeed have been because of inattentativeness<br/>because of that, and the fresher and more alert one is the less likely<br/>- looking at the type of bug they have been, such as forgetting to do<br/>something or other. I also tend to work long hours and forget to take<br/>breaks, being so interested in it all.</p><p>However, p.c.s get a lot done, and they spend the vast majority of the<br/>time asleep, even when pretty &quot;busy&quot; - I understand that it is very rare<br/>that it actually uses the processor to capacity continuously for any<br/>length of time, even if it is ultra short interrupted sleep of a few<br/>milliseconds at a time, or when it is at its most busy, sleeps<br/>perhaps measured in millionths of a second, or whatever it is.</p><p>Perhaps one can learn from that.</p><p>I plan to set it to highest priority, as you say.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
