I thought of making curved bridges at both<br/>ends, designing so that I can bow all 8 strings. Has anyone built, seen<br/>or played such an instrument? If so, any pics or designs? The problem I<br/>foresee is that the two highest strings, being further away from the<br/>soundboard, might lose volume.</p><p>Thanks in anticipation.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
