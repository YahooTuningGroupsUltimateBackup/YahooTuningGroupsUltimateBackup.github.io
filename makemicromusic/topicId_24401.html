Or do you?<br/>&gt;<br/>Depends.  Currently, I am limited to 12-note subsets, since I use Apple Logic, but as far as my experience goes, 12 is more than enough for me.  Sometimes it is too much, if the scale is too uneven.  I compose more by feel than by theory, and if I have too many notes available I lose my ability to &quot;feel&quot; my way forward--too many decisions to make at any given moment causes brain-lag and I can&apos;t keep up enough forward momentum.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if this is a strength or a weakness for me as a composer; I&apos;d fail miserably if I ever attempted to write even basic counterpoint, but I seem to have a knack for minimalism.  When I did take a stab at 31-EDO on guitar, it was a nightmare, though not as bad as the Catler 12-tone Ultra Plus (which takes 12-tET and adds 7th, 11th, and 13th harmonics to every note).  I had to play everything in the same key (A, specifically), as the thought of modulating even in the diatonic scale was too intimidating.  Even playing in Pajara[10] in 22-EDO took quite a bit of mental agility for me.  Which is probably why I have very different taste in scales than you do--the temperaments you use (and quite skillfully, may I add) would stymie me, no doubt about it.  Surely you&apos;ve noticed that the scales I love all have one thing in common: they&apos;re simple!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24415 href="#24415">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2011 7:44:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Let&apos;s make it a rule hereforth to include the scale used in every<br/>musical file presented.</p><p>I found merits in this example.

In the piece I wrote for your tuning, I used sampled guitar harmonics--you can&apos;t get more &quot;pure harmonic&quot; than that!--as well as strings (w/no vibrato) and some kind of calliope-esque sound.  In the piece for John&apos;s scale, I used a piano, an electric bass, and a friggin&apos; BRASS HORN sample (again w/NO vibrato).  About the only timbres I can think of that are LESS masking of the tuning would be pure square and saw waves, which sound bad on their own!</p><p>I don&apos;t disbelieve Sethares&apos; theory, all he&apos;s on about is eliminating beating by tuning all the partials to match all the possible fundamental notes in the tuning.  I just don&apos;t believe that the elimination of beating has any more than a negligible effect in actual music.

I&apos;ve said it before and I&apos;ll say it again: it is a waste of time to seek a single tuning to succeed 12-tET.  There are too many viable alternatives to select one, or even a handful.  It is also impossible to explain why any of them would be desirable without explaining basic principles of tuning.  Musicians should be empowered to choose among tunings, not led blindly from one to the next.  Yes, there is a vast teeming plethora of tunings used in the microtonal world, but most microtonalists at least understand all of them, because we know the basic principles (which are really quite simple).</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24833 href="#24833">ðŸ”—</a>ALOE@...</h3><span>1/23/2011 4:16:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 05:44 AM 1/9/11 +0200, Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt;Let&apos;s make it a rule hereforth to include the scale used in every<br/>&gt;musical file presented.</p><p>If pitch is bent throughout, as in blues, how can that requirement be met?</p><p>-- Beco dos Gatinhos &lt;<a href="http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music/pitch.html">http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music/pitch.html</a>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=24836 href="#24836">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>1/23/2011 4:33:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Is this your tune Igs?
