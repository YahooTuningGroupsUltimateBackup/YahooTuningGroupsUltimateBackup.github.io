It&apos;s described on my website here:  <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/photonwind/">http://members.shaw.ca/photonwind/</a></p><p>Specifically, for microtonal playing, the 8 finger keys detect not just being pressed, but the location they are pressed, or alternatively the tilt after they are pressed.   They also detect pressure or aftertouch.  Octaves are selectable either with your lip/tongue from the mouthpiece or with your thumb on a controller.  All this is highly customizable - initially only through changing the embedded code, but in the future there may be a PC/Mac hosted user interface for it.  I may offer the hardware controller for sale, and make the software open source if there is enough interest.</p><p>The fingering system is designed to be able to emulate the fingering patterns of wind instruments - sax, clarinet, flute, trumpet, etc, as well as the mouthpiece control, on the same hardware platform, all customizable just by changing software.   It would also be possible to create &quot;alternative fingerings&quot; for the desired number of notes within an octave. These would then repeat for other octaves using an octave selection system (lip/tongue, or thumb).  I also have a method in mind that could allow the 8 keys to be played sort of like a melodica, but with the possibilities of bending between notes or selecting specific microtonal pitches between notes.</p><p>One would have to come up with a way of mapping pitches to midi either with pitch bends associated with microtonal notes, or by mapping to note numbers where the synth is not tuned in octaves.  I&apos;m also thinking of providing a non midi way of connecting it to a PC to send raw controller actions to softsynths such as max/msp or Reaktor or Perry Cook&apos;s midi toolkit, which would bypass the limitations of midi.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working on this for about four years, and have now prototyped and tested all the subcomponents of the instrument, sometimes attached to commercial wind controllers.

Right now it&apos;s research, but I hope it may be a<br/>product<br/>&gt; someday.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s described on my website here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/photonwind/">http://members.shaw.ca/photonwind/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Specifically, for microtonal playing, the 8 finger keys detect<br/>not<br/>&gt; just<br/>&gt; &gt; being pressed, but the location they are pressed, or<br/>alternatively<br/>&gt; the tilt<br/>&gt; &gt; after they are pressed.   They also detect pressure or<br/>aftertouch.<br/>&gt; Octaves<br/>&gt; &gt; are selectable either with your lip/tongue from the mouthpiece<br/>or<br/>&gt; with your<br/>&gt; &gt; thumb on a controller.  All this is highly customizable -<br/>initially<br/>&gt; only<br/>&gt; &gt; through changing the embedded code, but in the future there may<br/>be<br/>&gt; a PC/Mac<br/>&gt; &gt; hosted user interface for it.  I may offer the hardware<br/>controller<br/>&gt; for sale,<br/>&gt; &gt; and make the software open source if there is enough interest.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The fingering system is designed to be able to emulate the<br/>&gt; fingering<br/>&gt; &gt; patterns of wind instruments - sax, clarinet, flute, trumpet,<br/>etc,<br/>&gt; as well<br/>&gt; &gt; as the mouthpiece control, on the same hardware platform, all<br/>&gt; customizable<br/>&gt; &gt; just by changing software.   It would also be possible to create<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;alternative fingerings&quot; for the desired number of notes within<br/>an<br/>&gt; octave.<br/>&gt; &gt; These would then repeat for other octaves using an octave<br/>selection<br/>&gt; system<br/>&gt; &gt; (lip/tongue, or thumb).  I also have a method in mind that could<br/>&gt; allow the 8<br/>&gt; &gt; keys to be played sort of like a melodica, but with the<br/>&gt; possibilities of<br/>&gt; &gt; bending between notes or selecting specific microtonal pitches<br/>&gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; notes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One would have to come up with a way of mapping pitches to midi<br/>&gt; either with<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch bends associated with microtonal notes, or by mapping to<br/>note<br/>&gt; numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; where the synth is not tuned in octaves.  I&apos;m also thinking of<br/>&gt; providing a<br/>&gt; &gt; non midi way of connecting it to a PC to send raw controller<br/>&gt; actions to<br/>&gt; &gt; softsynths such as max/msp or Reaktor or Perry Cook&apos;s midi<br/>toolkit,<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; would bypass the limitations of midi.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been working on this for about four years, and have now<br/>&gt; prototyped and<br/>&gt; &gt; tested all the subcomponents of the instrument, sometimes<br/>attached<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; commercial wind controllers.  I&apos;m now in the process of building<br/>a<br/>&gt; complete<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; - Chris Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may be interested in a plan for valved brass instrument that I<br/>&gt; proposed in this spreadsheet:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/Brass.xls">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/Brass.xls</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A detailed explanation of this may be found in these two messages:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45966">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45966</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45990">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45990</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is for 4-valve *multi-tuning* acoustic brass instruments<br/>&gt; consisting of three 2-position finger valves and one 3-position<br/>thumb<br/>&gt; valve (with rest position at the center of travel).  The thumb<br/>valve<br/>&gt; may alternatively be analog (similar to a small trombone slide),<br/>&gt; approximately +70/-50 cents.  An additional 2-position valve (for<br/>the<br/>&gt; little finger) would be used on instruments in which combinations<br/>of<br/>&gt; valves would be required to lower the pitch up to an octave (tuba<br/>&amp;<br/>&gt; piccolo trumpet).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just as a generalized keyboard permits a keyboard player to play a<br/>&gt; synthesizer in multiple tunings with uniform fingering patterns,<br/>two<br/>&gt; significant features of this plan are that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) A brass player could play in many different tunings with a<br/>single<br/>&gt; instrument, thus eliminating the need for multiple instruments for<br/>&gt; multiple tunings;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) The valves retain the same general functions across all<br/>tunings,<br/>&gt; with the first and second valves retaining the *very same<br/>function*<br/>&gt; they have in 12-ET brass instruments (lowering the pitch a major<br/>2nd<br/>&gt; and minor 2nd, respectively), regardless of the tuning, thus<br/>&gt; simplifying the learning curve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope you will consider making the brass version of your<br/>controller<br/>&gt; compatible with what I have outlined above, so that the fingering<br/>&gt; habits acquired by a brass player using your product could<br/>eventually<br/>&gt; be transferred to an acoustic instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George Secor</p></div><h3>George D.
