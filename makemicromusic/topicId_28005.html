I&apos;m always confused by the privacy complaints.<br/>Facebook is the most private thing on the web.  In fact it&apos;s<br/>so private it can&apos;t be searched.  Their URLs are temporary<br/>and sometimes even unique to your particular browser session.<br/>In fact the entire site seems to run out of memcached and<br/>anything in the db behind that is essentially irretrievable.</p><p>To save space they downsample and re-jpeg all photos at very<br/>low quality (even gifs and pngs, sometimes even making them<br/>much larger in the process).  Paul Erlich&apos;s been uploading<br/>his diagrams and they&apos;re hardly legible at times.</p><p>HTTP, REST, and HTML have been hijacked by businesses and<br/>professional programmers and turned into an API (and a pretty<br/>awkward one in my opinion).

This alone makes it worthwhile to me.  There are lots of outside perspectives and I enjoy the frequent contributions there by Paul Erlich, Johnny Reinhard, Kraig Grady, Ron Sword, etc.  It&apos;s not good for really in-depth discussions, but it&apos;s good for short and mostly-friendly exchanges of ideas and exposure to wider perspectives than one tends to get here.  I am often reminded there that the most active composers don&apos;t worry so much about the rigors of theory that we hash out on the Tuning List.  They all have their own approaches, which despite containing some logical warts and inconsistencies seem to perennially bare fruit in music.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Hans,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My take: It&apos;s nice to have people&apos;s photos - it changes the<br/>&gt; dynamic.

Features are different, and I don&apos;t know if I<br/>&gt; like it any better, and of course there&apos;s no going back :S Group chat is<br/>&gt; nice, but it sucks that you can&apos;t see stuff without being a member of FB,<br/>&gt; even when it&apos;s set to be an &quot;open group&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve had some conversations with Tyler Henthorn (a friend of Ron Sword)<br/>&gt; about installing Drupal on one of &quot;our&quot; servers, and equipping it with a<br/>&gt; music-sharing player like the Ning site had, plus some kind of intelligent<br/>&gt; scale/tuning collaborative database. I&apos;m not terribly psyched about Drupal,<br/>&gt; and am just now learning the basics of PHP/MySQL in case some custom<br/>&gt; programming needs to be done, but I&apos;m hopeful. So sit tight, Mat.<br/>&gt; &gt; Jacob<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>domilarre &#x3C;domilare@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2013 1:41:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello AKJ, I am visiting Chicago from June 18th to June 24th 2013 and would very much like to meet you.<br/>Cheers<br/>Dominique</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve had a lot on my plate lately, and it only seems to be getting more-so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve decided to drop off the radar of these Yahoo groups...if anyone needs<br/>&gt; to reach me try private email, or I&apos;m still following the lighter traffic at<br/>&gt; the Xenharmonic Alliance on FB.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wishing you all the best,<br/>&gt; AKJ<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div>
