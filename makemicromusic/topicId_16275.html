I could feel the eights at<br/>least I guess :)&quot;</p><p>The 9/8 meter in the beginning is played quite freely in tempo, to<br/>obscure the meter and give an improvised feeling. The 11/8 meter (with<br/>drum) is really just 3 + 3 + 3 + 2/8, with the santoor breaking into<br/>syncopations against the percussion now &amp; then.</p><p>&quot;This mode seems to work very well, especially with the santoor sound.<br/>It is curious that your fifth 10/9 is a comma flat from 3/2, but I<br/>didn&apos;t notice that when I listened.&quot;</p><p>The entire tuning has a rather nice flavor, I think. The mode is tuned<br/>from 1/1= C, but I chose the plagal mode starting on the fifth for this<br/>composition. The melodic material emphasizes 3/2 and 1/1 as the<br/>primary/secondary tonal centers, with 9/5 as a third (but less<br/>emphasized) center.</p><p>This mode is comprised entirely of neutral, medium and major seconds<br/>(from 3/2):  12/11 - 11/10 - 10/9 - 10/9 - 11/10 - 12/11 - 9/8.</p><p>[The score in PDF is available on request.]</p><p>Regards,</p><p>jls</p></div>
