There is no<br/>doubt the the world he envisioned is there for the taking by anyone<br/>with the courage to leave pretuned instruments to a supporting role<br/>or else use them only in special circumstances in full recognition of<br/>the straitjacked they impose...&quot;</p><p>??</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=2438 href="#2438">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

I don&apos;t think this proportional division is likely to change.</p><p>I think I understand why Ben Johnston feels the need to speak in these terms, and Partch himself (as he stated so well in &quot;Genesis&quot;) would ask others to go beyond his works and expand upon similar theories. It is unfortunate that Johnston needs to cast his argument against the backdrop of what he perceives as failures on Partch&apos;s part, especially in light of his apparent lack of success in creating a compelling art himself.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2440 href="#2440">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2002 9:40:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
