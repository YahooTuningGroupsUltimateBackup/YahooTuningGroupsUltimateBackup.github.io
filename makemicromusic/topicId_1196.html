It&apos;s curious how the tuning can often support something<br/>&gt; quite close to what might be called &quot;textbook 14th-century harmony,&quot;<br/>&gt; but with some engaging turns and twists.</p><p>Yes, indeed, it does sound like very early music to my ears...</p><p>&gt; Let&apos;s see, this would be 0-277-554-831-1200 cents. I should try this<br/>&gt; myself.</p><p>Yes, and then because one of the intervals is a major third, you<br/>can rotate it to four different positions and form each one note<br/>in the chord you can branch off four different &quot;diminished sevenths&quot;<br/>and so one can modulate around the clock as it were using only<br/>&quot;diminished sevenths&quot; in fact sort of, only one diminished seventh<br/>gradually transforming.</p><p>I have an idea to do a piece like that, basically just one 13-tet<br/>diminished seventh rotating around and going to all possible positions<br/>in the scale by doing so. I suppose that&apos;s not a very medieval<br/>idea, but would be interesting to find out if it fits in somehow.</p><p>&gt; These are interesting comparisons; one timbre I use is called a<br/>&gt; &quot;Chowning Celeste,&quot; based on a Yahama TX-802 preset, with at most<br/>&gt; minimal adjustments if I recall correctly. The pleasant effect of an<br/>&gt; inharmonic &quot;tuned percussion&quot; type of timbre is maybe not so<br/>&gt; surprising, and the Sitar comparison maybe another kind of question.</p><p>Yes, the Sitar is more of a surprise I think. I don&apos;t know what it is<br/>that makes it work on Sitar and not on the Cello say. I&apos;ll do some<br/>investigating... (Also is quite likely to depend on the soundbank and which of the<br/>SB Live Midi ports I use).</p><p>I&apos;ve put the Sesquisexta into the Midi In preset list in FTS beta preview,<br/>as an experiment - it is a kind of somewhat eclectic list that brings<br/>out various things that one can use with the program for midi relaying<br/>- in this case, idea of using the two halves of the keyboard for<br/>playing 24 note scales (or alternatively, two keyboards).</p><p>Basically tends to be whatever I was playing about with at the time<br/>I added the entry to it, if it was something that seemed would interest<br/>others. It&apos;s also got the spiralling hexany I posted to the TL as it<br/>makes it convenient to  get to it and I think it is kind of fun<br/>to play around with.</p><p>Today I&apos;ve been playing around with another kind of effect, using<br/>syntonic commas looking at a little phrase:</p><p>c e g b&apos; e+ e g e b e e+ b e e+ b e+ e c a c&apos; a+ c&apos;+ d&apos;+<br/>e&apos;++ ~~ e&apos; c&apos;</p><p>where ~~ = a pitch glide, + = up by a syntonic comma</p><p>I found the recurring b e e+ melodic motif most attractive.<br/>I worked it out on recorder rather than keyboard, using<br/>the just ratios, or at least, what I imagined were them,<br/>with no keyboard to hand at the time.</p><p>Idea is to write a piece that uses the syntonic comma to melodic effect,<br/>and be useful too maybe for those wanting to practice just intonation<br/>major thirds and syntonic commas in their playing. I may add some<br/>kind of accompaniment to it. I&apos;d like it to have at least one<br/>comma glide in it, or maybe a double comma glide from say e++ to e<br/>as in this ex.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I look forward to reading about the pieces and your technical notes.</p><p>&gt; With Jacky&apos;s help, there should be more to come.</p><p>I&apos;ll look forward to it all.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
