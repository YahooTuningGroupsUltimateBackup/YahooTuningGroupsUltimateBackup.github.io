(Tuning by keymap on the Kurzweil<br/>allows you to have n tones per octave to cent accuracy, and permits<br/>you to set up any number of sample roots across all but the lowest<br/>12 MIDI note numbers).</p><p>Given my own difficulties in trying to send the right SysEx to the<br/>K2000 to do the same thing, I can only salute Fred&apos;s ingenuity and<br/>persistence in getting this to work!</p><p>I look forward to using it to tune up my TX81Z.</p><p>Merry microtonal holidays to all,<br/>Harold<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin">www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin</a><br/>(Click on the Compositions link and scroll down to enjoy many<br/>microtonal mp3s.)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;fredwkohler&quot;<br/>&lt;fred.kohler@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi All,<br/>&gt; I couldn&apos;t bear to have my Windows tuning editor lying around doing<br/>&gt; nothing so I&apos;m making it available for free.
