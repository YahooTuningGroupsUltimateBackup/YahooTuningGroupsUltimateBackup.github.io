The mapping is restricted to a maximum of 12<br/>degrees per octave.</p><p>2) open and playback midi files. During playback you can switch forth<br/>and back between temperaments. The retuned midi file can be saved<br/>seperately.</p><p>3) improved and much easier configuration setup</p><p>Keep in mind that the goal of the program is not to offer the most<br/>advanced options in microtuning nor the most elaborate virtual organ,<br/>but a simple program that provides the experience of microtuning to<br/>all musicians or music students. (A friend of my has a rather advanced<br/>education as an organist, but never had any experience with, say,<br/>quarter meantone). I would like very much to have this program used in<br/>music schools.</p><p>I included some example mp3 files that I created with JMTOrgan and<br/>Synthfont: the 22nd prelude of WTC1 in B-flat minor - In my opinion,<br/>Werckmeister III is not well suited for this prelude. The friction is<br/>at the wrong places. I prefer Lehman&apos;s temperament to which I keep<br/>tuning my (real) harpsichord.  (I am sure there must have been a large<br/>deal of discussions on this temperament on the list.)</p><p>see: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jeroendonkers/JMTOrgan/examples.html">http://www.geocities.com/jeroendonkers/JMTOrgan/examples.html</a></p><p>The piece by William Byrd sounds almost like magic in quarter meantime<br/>and is unbareable for me in equal temperament.</p><p>regards,</p><p>Jeroen Donkers</p></div>
