My name is Igliashon Jones, and I am a microtonal<br/>guitarist.  Currently I have a 31-EDO guitar and one of Jon Catler&apos;s<br/>wonderful 13-limit (minus 5) 12-Tone Ultra-Plus guitars, and I have<br/>an old nylon string being refretted to 22-EDO as I write this.  To<br/>give a little background on myself: I&apos;m 21 and I live in the Bay<br/>Area, and I stumbled into the wonderland of Xenharmonic music almost<br/>by accident.  Basically I have always been obsessed with the idea of<br/>breaking free of musical cliches, and when adding bizarre sounds and<br/>complex polyrhythms didn&apos;t help as much as I&apos;d hoped I suddenly<br/>realized that the solution might be to change the number of frets<br/>per octave on my guitar.  I came very close to just guessing a<br/>random number (13 or 14 it probably would have been) and refretting<br/>to that, but a google search on &quot;more than 12 notes per octave&quot;<br/>turned up a few scholarly research articles.  These introduced me to<br/>the term &quot;microtonality&quot;, and a few searches later I discovered that<br/>there was in fact a whole new world right under my nose.</p><p>Long story short, I&apos;ve become fairly well-versed in the basic<br/>theories of rational intonation, harmonic series, and the various<br/>other equal temperaments.  31 was the scale I picked to start with,<br/>and I&apos;ve got what I think is a good enough grasp of it to express<br/>myself freely.  However, as many of you know microtonal tuning gets<br/>addictive, and I cannot be satisfied with just one system.  So I&apos;m<br/>going hog-wild and refretting all my guitars to different systems.</p><p>Now, I should note that I&apos;ve gotten my hands on as much microtonal<br/>music as I can and I have loved nearly all of it.  But one thing<br/>I&apos;ve noticed is that for the large part, microtonality is the domain<br/>of scholars, theoreticians, and modern classical/avant garde<br/>composers.  This is all well and good, and has created a very unique<br/>and interesting community here, and were it not for these scholars<br/>and theoreticians I would have had quite a time finding my way<br/>around.  But my dream has always been to reach out to the public at<br/>large and shatter their conception of what music can be.  I want to<br/>take microtonal music out of the shadows (though not necessarily<br/>into the spotlight; the last thing we need is it to become<br/>commercialized).  I think that maybe by applying microtonality to<br/>some of the familiar modern musical idioms, more people might<br/>embrace it.</p><p>To put it straight: I want to form a microtonal band, and I&apos;ve come<br/>here seeking advice.

Does<br/>anyone have any idea of a cost-effective way to access a variety of<br/>microtonal scales on a performance-oriented instrument?  I thought<br/>about fretless instruments for a while, but trying to teach someone<br/>to play a fretless in several different scales (or even to play it<br/>myself) is frankly beyond my ability.</p></div><h3><a id=8055 href="#8055">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Redfern &#x3C;brianwredfern@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2004 4:20:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, at least you&apos;re in the Bay area!

Persevere! You are already sounding very committed to an unconventional musical life, and there is no need to fret (literally and otherwise...).</p><p>2. As Dan wrote, at least it isn&apos;t Kansas; more to the point, it is the Bay Area! Just a day or so ago I read on Kyle Gann&apos;s blog how he is getting way more performances on the West coast as opposed to East, and he feels he is a WC&apos;r trapped in a EC&apos;rs body!</p><p>3. It is remarkably fertile up there, with a lot of very open-minded musicians. If you can relax into it, you&apos;ll find yourself growing even until you find other similar non-12 players.</p><p>4. You mentioned a couple EDOs in your rep, but be aware that the Just Intonation Network (of which I&apos;m sure Catler knows of) is based in SF (this may be old news to you) and they are having concerts sometime in the coming year. You don&apos;t find this kind of stuff in North Dakota, my friend!</p><p>5. There are a fair number of people on this list from the SF/Oakland/Berkeley area - no players that come to mind, at least in your requirements, but hopefully supportive people that you could hang with and learn from.</p><p>6. Last, and most important: you are in an epicenter of microtonality that has a long and deep history of nurturing great explorers. Was it always easy? No. But Lou Harrison spent a long and loving time in NoCal, and leaves us with a vast repository of great music. And one HAS to mention that the ground still vibrates from the times that Harry Partch worked in Oakland, Berkeley, Sausalito, Petaluma... I&apos;ve corresponded with people (even a *bass* player!) as part of my work with the Harry Partch Foundation that lived up there and were creative.</p><p>You Can Do It.</p><p>As a matter of fact, we now expect you to.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. Don&apos;t know what would pan out of it, but if you&apos;re in the SoMa area, look up OmniCircus (<a href="http://www.omnicircus.com/">http://www.omnicircus.com/</a>) and talk to Frank Garvey; Frank&apos;s father conducted a number of Partch premiers in the 50/60&apos;s, and Frank created his own ensemble that combines performance, theatre, art, and robotics (this is *very* wild stuff). Tell him Jon Szanto let you know about his stuff, and see if he can guide you to players as well...</p><p>P.S.S. I happen to think what you want to do is not only important, not only necessary, but both vital and long overdue. There are so few people outside of the academic/classical circles *actively* promoting non12. Have you corresponded with Neil Haverstick???</p></div><h3><a id=8063 href="#8063">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2004 9:54:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mr. Stearns, I currently have one 31-tet improvisation up on my<br/>soundclick site ( <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/cityoftheasleep">http://www.soundclick.com/cityoftheasleep</a> ), which<br/>I recorded a day or two after getting the guitar back from the shop<br/>and was just starting to get familiar with it.

I will be starting my first semester at San Fran state<br/>this spring, so perhaps a few (or many) well-placed flyers will net<br/>me some musicians.</p><p>On a side note, do you know of any good luthiers that are relatively<br/>close to my area who have experience with microtonal retrofretting?<br/>I&apos;m not very fond of the guy who did my 31-EDO...he&apos;s slow, and a<br/>few of the frets are out of tune.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

You are already sounding very committed to an<br/>unconventional<br/>&gt; musical life, and there is no need to fret (literally and<br/>otherwise...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. As Dan wrote, at least it isn&apos;t Kansas; more to the point, it<br/>is the Bay<br/>&gt; Area! Just a day or so ago I read on Kyle Gann&apos;s blog how he is<br/>getting way<br/>&gt; more performances on the West coast as opposed to East, and he<br/>feels he is<br/>&gt; a WC&apos;r trapped in a EC&apos;rs body!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. It is remarkably fertile up there, with a lot of very open-<br/>minded<br/>&gt; musicians. If you can relax into it, you&apos;ll find yourself growing<br/>even<br/>&gt; until you find other similar non-12 players.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. You mentioned a couple EDOs in your rep, but be aware that the<br/>Just<br/>&gt; Intonation Network (of which I&apos;m sure Catler knows of) is based in<br/>SF (this<br/>&gt; may be old news to you) and they are having concerts sometime in<br/>the coming<br/>&gt; year. You don&apos;t find this kind of stuff in North Dakota, my friend!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5. There are a fair number of people on this list from the<br/>&gt; SF/Oakland/Berkeley area - no players that come to mind, at least<br/>in your<br/>&gt; requirements, but hopefully supportive people that you could hang<br/>with and<br/>&gt; learn from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6. Last, and most important: you are in an epicenter of<br/>microtonality that<br/>&gt; has a long and deep history of nurturing great explorers. Was it<br/>always<br/>&gt; easy? No. But Lou Harrison spent a long and loving time in NoCal,<br/>and<br/>&gt; leaves us with a vast repository of great music. And one HAS to<br/>mention<br/>&gt; that the ground still vibrates from the times that Harry Partch<br/>worked in<br/>&gt; Oakland, Berkeley, Sausalito, Petaluma... I&apos;ve corresponded with<br/>people<br/>&gt; (even a *bass* player!) as part of my work with the Harry Partch<br/>Foundation<br/>&gt; that lived up there and were creative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You Can Do It.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a matter of fact, we now expect you to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. Don&apos;t know what would pan out of it, but if you&apos;re in the<br/>SoMa area,<br/>&gt; look up OmniCircus (<a href="http://www.omnicircus.com/">http://www.omnicircus.com/</a>) and talk to Frank<br/>Garvey;<br/>&gt; Frank&apos;s father conducted a number of Partch premiers in the<br/>50/60&apos;s, and<br/>&gt; Frank created his own ensemble that combines performance, theatre,<br/>art, and<br/>&gt; robotics (this is *very* wild stuff). Tell him Jon Szanto let you<br/>know<br/>&gt; about his stuff, and see if he can guide you to players as well...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S.S. I happen to think what you want to do is not only<br/>important, not<br/>&gt; only necessary, but both vital and long overdue. There are so few<br/>people<br/>&gt; outside of the academic/classical circles *actively* promoting<br/>non12. Have<br/>&gt; you corresponded with Neil Haverstick???</p></div><h3><a id=8066 href="#8066">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Redfern &#x3C;brianwredfern@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2004 10:20:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Check out music stores that sell to kids in the school<br/>orchestra, or any that  offer violin lessons can help<br/>you out.<br/>--- cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any idea where I could get this kind of tape?

More often than not, one is not always sure about the intervals until one hears it enough times in the timbre it is being used in.

I got a 22-tone JI, actually a 1.3.7.9.11.15 Eikosany, and I just gave &apos;em the ratios and they did it.  (To have an existing neck refretted costs more, &apos;cause they&apos;ve gotta fill the old slots, and if there&apos;s finishing to worry about...I don&apos;t know.)  My neck isn&apos;t &apos;painted&apos; at all, but it is all sanded really nice and stuff...As I recall the installation (ie bolting it on and setting it up, AND a new nut) charges were minimal, if not included (!).</p><p>He&apos;s got (or, he had) a copying lathe that shapes the necks, and a computerized jig that saws the fret slots.  All they do is pound in the frets, file, sand and polish.  It&apos;s pretty slick, in the best sense.  If you want it &apos;painted&apos;, ie clear-coated, or whatever, I&apos;m sure it would be reasonable, but good finishing is a hassle.  Without finishing, it&apos;s an easy (one-day?) job.  I&apos;m sure I didn&apos;t wait more than a week for mine, but I was living there.  Your turnaround time would depend (I guess) on how busy they are right then, and how much they hate packing and shipping stuff.

Currently I have a 31-EDO guitar and one of Jon Catler&apos;s<br/>&gt; wonderful 13-limit (minus 5) 12-Tone Ultra-Plus guitars, and I have<br/>&gt; an old nylon string being refretted to 22-EDO as I write this.  To<br/>&gt; give a little background on myself: I&apos;m 21 and I live in the Bay<br/>&gt; Area, and I stumbled into the wonderland of Xenharmonic music almost<br/>&gt; by accident.  Basically I have always been obsessed with the idea of<br/>&gt; breaking free of musical cliches, and when adding bizarre sounds and<br/>&gt; complex polyrhythms didn&apos;t help as much as I&apos;d hoped I suddenly<br/>&gt; realized that the solution might be to change the number of frets<br/>&gt; per octave on my guitar.  I came very close to just guessing a<br/>&gt; random number (13 or 14 it probably would have been) and refretting<br/>&gt; to that, but a google search on &quot;more than 12 notes per octave&quot;<br/>&gt; turned up a few scholarly research articles.  These introduced me to<br/>&gt; the term &quot;microtonality&quot;, and a few searches later I discovered that<br/>&gt; there was in fact a whole new world right under my nose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Long story short, I&apos;ve become fairly well-versed in the basic<br/>&gt; theories of rational intonation, harmonic series, and the various<br/>&gt; other equal temperaments.  31 was the scale I picked to start with,<br/>&gt; and I&apos;ve got what I think is a good enough grasp of it to express<br/>&gt; myself freely.  However, as many of you know microtonal tuning gets<br/>&gt; addictive, and I cannot be satisfied with just one system.  So I&apos;m<br/>&gt; going hog-wild and refretting all my guitars to different systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I should note that I&apos;ve gotten my hands on as much microtonal<br/>&gt; music as I can and I have loved nearly all of it.  But one thing<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve noticed is that for the large part, microtonality is the domain<br/>&gt; of scholars, theoreticians, and modern classical/avant garde<br/>&gt; composers.  This is all well and good, and has created a very unique<br/>&gt; and interesting community here, and were it not for these scholars<br/>&gt; and theoreticians I would have had quite a time finding my way<br/>&gt; around.  But my dream has always been to reach out to the public at<br/>&gt; large and shatter their conception of what music can be.  I want to<br/>&gt; take microtonal music out of the shadows (though not necessarily<br/>&gt; into the spotlight; the last thing we need is it to become<br/>&gt; commercialized).  I think that maybe by applying microtonality to<br/>&gt; some of the familiar modern musical idioms, more people might<br/>&gt; embrace it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To put it straight: I want to form a microtonal band, and I&apos;ve come<br/>&gt; here seeking advice.  I don&apos;t know anyone in my area who is<br/>&gt; simultaneously a good musician, a microtonal enthusiast, and has<br/>&gt; either the money or the luthier skills to put together a small<br/>&gt; ensemble of microtonal basses and/or guitars and/or some other type<br/>&gt; of performance-oriented instruments that would match my own.  Does<br/>&gt; anyone have any idea of a cost-effective way to access a variety of<br/>&gt; microtonal scales on a performance-oriented instrument?  I thought<br/>&gt; about fretless instruments for a while, but trying to teach someone<br/>&gt; to play a fretless in several different scales (or even to play it<br/>&gt; myself) is frankly beyond my ability.</p></div><h3><a id=8077 href="#8077">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Redfern &#x3C;brianwredfern@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2004 1:36:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That makes a lot of sense, people who learn fretless<br/>instruments like violin, cello, and bass are still<br/>playing on instruments designed for a standard<br/>intonation, where-as a fretted bass that&apos;s properly<br/>intonated for microtones will sound correct because<br/>its been intonated for a microtonal scale.</p><p>I&apos;m about to build some micrtotonal flutes, along the<br/>same idea, rather than try to bend a western flute to<br/>play microtones, I&apos;m taking a technique I learned at<br/>school from Nyoman Wenten, some of their older bamboo<br/>sulings from Bali were cracking in the dry heat of<br/>Valencia, so Wenten&apos;s brother built sulings from PVC.<br/>What&apos;s interesting is that its possible to mess with<br/>the spacing and number of holes, along with the width<br/>of the PVC to make different variations.</p><p>I already play traditional suling, and I&apos;m working on<br/>some new stuff (now that I got my soundcard working),<br/>mixing some traditional suling with electronic<br/>microtones generated from csound.<br/>--- Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Over the last 30 years i have seen all type of<br/>&gt; instruments and those<br/>&gt; that really get people interested in new tunings are<br/>&gt; those where someone<br/>&gt; can walk up to it and hear it right off.

Then you go to a hardware store and usually they have a little display of brass tubing and you buy the same size tube as the penny whistle and put on the removed mouth piece. I did this with Jim french. from there we had a set of drill bits of varying sizes and we put the hole under where he wanted his finger to be and made the hole from small to large till we got what we wanted. I wouldn&apos;t let him look at the pitch read out ( he has too good of ear and would bend it to what he wanted) and it took us about 8 hours to make one flute.<br/>( if inclined you are more than welcome to come over and see the Meta-slendro instruments in have on hand-just contact me off list)</p><p>Brian Redfern wrote:</p><p>&gt;That makes a lot of sense, people who learn fretless<br/>&gt;instruments like violin, cello, and bass are still<br/>&gt;playing on instruments designed for a standard<br/>&gt;intonation, where-as a fretted bass that&apos;s properly<br/>&gt;intonated for microtones will sound correct because<br/>&gt;its been intonated for a microtonal scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m about to build some micrtotonal flutes, along the<br/>&gt;same idea, rather than try to bend a western flute to<br/>&gt;play microtones, I&apos;m taking a technique I learned at<br/>&gt;school from Nyoman Wenten, some of their older bamboo<br/>&gt;sulings from Bali were cracking in the dry heat of<br/>&gt;Valencia, so Wenten&apos;s brother built sulings from PVC.<br/>&gt;What&apos;s interesting is that its possible to mess with<br/>&gt;the spacing and number of holes, along with the width<br/>&gt;of the PVC to make different variations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I already play traditional suling, and I&apos;m working on<br/>&gt;some new stuff (now that I got my soundcard working),<br/>&gt;mixing some traditional suling with electronic<br/>&gt;microtones generated from csound.<br/>&gt;--- Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;    Over the last 30 years i have seen all type of<br/>&gt;&gt;instruments and those &gt;&gt;that really get people interested in new tunings are<br/>&gt;&gt;those where someone &gt;&gt;can walk up to it and hear it right off.

With the PVC suling you get another piece of<br/>PVC that&apos;s about .5cm long, 3.25cm wide and with a<br/>thickness of .5cm.</p><p>The suling has six finger holes, the top hole starts<br/>about 24.75cm from the top, the second hole is 2.5cm<br/>from the end of the first hole (each hole is .7cm in<br/>diameter) and the third hole is 2.7cm from the edge of<br/>the second hole. The fourth hole is 5.2cm from the end<br/>of the third, the fifth is 2.7cm from the fourth, and<br/>the sixth hole is 2cm from the fifth.</p><p>The mouthpiece on the PVC suling is slightly different<br/>than the bamboo, because there&apos;s no bamboo joint<br/>sealing the end, you just cut the mouthpiece hole into<br/>the end of the PVC, and its slightly longer than the<br/>bamboo suling&apos;s mouthpiece.</p><p>Cut a rectangle 1.7cm in length, and .6cm wide, into<br/>the end of the PVC that will be the top of the flute.<br/>Then shave about a 3 degree slant onto the top of the<br/>rectangle. Then the second short tube fits over the<br/>end like a bamboo suling and you can drill the holes<br/>for the fingers.</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
