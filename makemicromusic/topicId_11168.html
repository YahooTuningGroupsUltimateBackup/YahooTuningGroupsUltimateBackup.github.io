I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m quite clear on the distinction you&apos;re<br/>trying to draw. I would say that &quot;Father temperament&apos; encompasses<br/>many different tunings, and &quot;meta-father&quot;, following Wilson (though<br/>he may have some other &apos;meta&apos; name for it), would have to be a pretty<br/>darn *specific* tuning of father temperament where one finds a great<br/>deal of coincidence between difference tones of scale tones and other<br/>scale tones. But please fill me in on what you mean -- particularly<br/>if you can do so on another list . . .</p></div>
