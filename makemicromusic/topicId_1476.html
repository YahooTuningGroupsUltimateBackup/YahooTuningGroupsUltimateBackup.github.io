In<br/>both the cases of the harmonic series and tuning by timbre you have the same<br/>principle of &quot;coincidence&quot; of partials are equal to consonance. In other<br/>words, acoustical relations hold the show. Now it is hard to tell which came<br/>first the chicken or the egg. The timbre or the scale, but as far as<br/>instruments made around the world, there is an overwhelming preference for<br/>instruments with strong fundamentals. In those places where you have<br/>instruments without strong fundamentals, the music develops in other<br/>directions than pitch altogether, such as with gongs and especially drums.<br/>Here pitch might be more correctly thought of as range in order to<br/>differentiate one &quot;voice&quot; from another.<br/>    Sethares works opens up some interesting Questions. For instance why do<br/>so many different timbres work in 12 ET and not in other timbres. Or are we<br/>not used to the different relationships they have in other tunings. Also<br/>there are cases such as Gagaku where you have parallel tunings that work<br/>side by side. Pythagorean plucked strings with Subharmonic flutes and such.<br/>The method of using a combined timbre to create a scale makes quite good<br/>sense. I personally have been interested in what simultaneous scales can be<br/>used to sound the same as if they are the same scale. The observation that<br/>the same timbre does not work throughout a large range  seems to be the true<br/>with acoustic instruments, outside of maybe strings.

It is an effort to balance the musical scales<br/>&gt; based on what my *ear* tells me, because in the end, hearing this in<br/>&gt; music is what I think we are trying to work toward, and hearing it in<br/>&gt; complex interaction in a musical setting is the final *proof* of if<br/>&gt; you got it right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Many times the large body of contemporary tuning theory will give -<br/>&gt; what I see - as undue &quot;weight&quot; to the supremacy of the harmonic<br/>&gt; series, because in the West, harmonic series timbres may generally<br/>&gt; dominate in the musical textures. This does have value to musical<br/>&gt; situations which match this choice of timbres, yet other realties may<br/>&gt; exist where cultural or personal conditioning (not to mention<br/>&gt; aesthetic choice) favors the inharmonic series timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best Regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Timbre Rules&quot; - Frank Zappa<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=1492 href="#1492">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2001 1:59:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In those places where you have<br/>&gt; instruments without strong fundamentals, the music develops in other<br/>&gt; directions than pitch altogether, such as with gongs and especially<br/>drums.<br/>&gt; Here pitch might be more correctly thought of as range in order to<br/>&gt; differentiate one &quot;voice&quot; from another.</p><p>Very good point Kraig.</p><p>&gt;     Sethares works opens up some interesting Questions.

Similarly, I could see Pelog as taking advantage of<br/>the increased &quot;malleability&quot; of the consonances when inharmonic<br/>overtone structures are in play. For example, on tuning-math we found<br/>that, just as eliminating the usual syntonic comma, (4 -1), leads<br/>uniquely to the familiar meantone temperament, elimiating the major<br/>limma, (3 1), leads uniquely to a Pelog tuning, approximately in a<br/>stretched 23-tET.</p></div><h3><a id=1512 href="#1512">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 2:55:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And I&apos;m not even familar with his work,<br/>although I&apos;d like to read some of his work.</p><p>Kraig!
