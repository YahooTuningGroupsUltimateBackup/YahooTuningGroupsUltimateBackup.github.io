The oldest recording i<br/>have is an old UNESCO vinyl GEORGIA I<br/>with liner notes by our old friend Habib Toumi<br/>I got this around probably 1973 so it is older than that<br/>.<br/>this description seems to be in the ball park and is an important find.</p><p>Paul thanks for translation. It does appear that their 5th  are pretty pure to<br/>my ear.</p><p>Now here is one of those cases if someone came up with this tuning I can&apos;t<br/>imagine anyone taking it seriously. The fifth being such a strong interval<br/>makes sense when you consider these are like voices. One doesn&apos;t expect men to<br/>sing in octaves a whole lot, although i hear some of this two.<br/>In New Guinea, I have often heard recordings with men and women in parallel<br/>octaves on some very highly ornamented lines</p><p>    I too would be quite interested in what exactly they are doing. If you find<br/>more PLEASE keep me informed!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 4<br/>&gt;    Date: Thu, 11 Jul 2002 20:40:13 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;booeyschewy&quot; &lt;booeyschewy@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Some Georgian Tuning info found<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a quote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In general, in music with true three-part polyphonic independence and<br/>&gt; a small melodic range, fifths will be more important than octaves.<br/>&gt; The fifth will replace the octave as the unit of structural stability<br/>&gt; and pitch equivalence, and the scale will repeat at the fifth instead<br/>&gt; of the octave. We can usefully speak of such music as being built<br/>&gt; around the &quot;quintave&quot; rather than the octave. In a scale based on the<br/>&gt; quintave, furthermore, the tendency will be to subdivide the fifth<br/>&gt; not into whole and half steps but into four intervals more nearly<br/>&gt; equal in size, blurring or erasing the sense of major and minor.<br/>&gt; Those intervals produce a lowered second, a near-neutral third, and a<br/>&gt; raised fourth--which, when projected by a fifth, results in a raised<br/>&gt; eighth degree, a wide octave. The effects of this tendency vary by<br/>&gt; region in proportion to the tradition of true three-part polyphony,<br/>&gt; but some form of quintave tuning is common to almost all Georgian<br/>&gt; music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; from here <a href="http://argosoft.com/kavkasia/album2/intro.htm">http://argosoft.com/kavkasia/album2/intro.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That sounds very interesting. I have some recordings of other<br/>&gt; Georgian music, is there a program I could use to analyze the<br/>&gt; frequencies of the scales?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; todd<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=3613 href="#3613">ðŸ”—</a>judithconrad@...</h3><span>7/13/2002 5:52:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 13 Jul 2002, at 3:14, Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I have noticed the neutral thirds  but the expanded octave i am not<br/>&gt;  sure about</p><p>I was walking my dog yesterday evening, not in Georgia but in New<br/>England, and was passing a house with a birthday party in full<br/>swing in the back yard. And I arrived at just the right moment,<br/>because I was treated to their very own, unaccompanied, rendition<br/>of &apos;Happy Birthday&apos;. Led, presumably by the person with the<br/>strongest voice in the group, the goup lacking anyone with musical<br/>training (just guessing here -- they did manage to hit recognisable<br/>pitches a lot better than many comtemporary americans do). The<br/>melody came out, roughly speaking,</p><p>f f g    f     b flat    a             f f g     f       c      b flat</p><p>f f     c#    a#        g         f#    e</p><p>b  b   a#      f#     g         f</p><p>!
