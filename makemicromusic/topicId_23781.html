I don&apos;t know<br/>how much 12-equal the Logic library Concert Grand piano really is<br/>actually... It all boiled down to setting the right tuning that wasn&apos;t<br/>&quot;fixed to 12-equal&quot; which also worked with the piece. I happily ended up<br/>using my own construct since the chords were pleasing enough compared to<br/>many other temperament options.</p><p>Another thought is, If the piece is actually sounding Western despite<br/>the regular utilization of The Pythagorean + quartertonal division of<br/>the wholetones (adding also the occasional 3-comma flats), then this is<br/>significative of two things in my opinion:</p><p>1. That what makes a music Western-sounding has hardly much to do with<br/>the tuning as long as it has a characteristic diatonic basis.</p><p>2. That the tunings professed to work for Turkish and Arabic Maqam<br/>musics may not necessarily serve the desired purposes even when<br/>utilizing Eastern or Eastern-inspired melodies.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>--</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>hstraub64 wrote:<br/>&gt; Sounds really good, and I also like the composition!
