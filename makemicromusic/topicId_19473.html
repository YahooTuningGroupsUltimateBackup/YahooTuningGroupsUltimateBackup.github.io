If you&apos;re just doing black or white<br/>(i.e. you&apos;re just looking at set membership and not escape<br/>times), then that&apos;s a single bit per per pixel, or about 200MB<br/>for a 40,000 x 40,000 set.  If you do 20 iterations per point<br/>(and you probably wouldn&apos;t need that many), that&apos;s on the order<br/>of 32 Gops.  A 3GHz quad-core Xeon chip from Intel can do<br/>80 GFLOPS.  So your project is well within range of today&apos;s<br/>hardware.</p><p>If you could calculate audio from a bmp, you can generate<br/>the mandelbrot in the first place.  In fact I would tally<br/>the value for the waveform inside the loop for the mandelbrot<br/>so you don&apos;t have to store and parse that 200MB file.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>jorge blank &#x3C;jorgepiaget@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2008 6:08:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey there</p><p>I am a long time lurker, first time poster.</p><p>anyhow, if you want to convert the Mandelbrot set into sound, why not<br/>start with the functions involved (might be easier to try some simpler<br/>self-similar sets first like Serpinski Triangles or something) and<br/>apply the results of those functions directly onto a set of audio<br/>data, or utilize them to generate audio directly?  It seems to me that<br/>this is a more direct approach since the mathematical language<br/>functions in this case as THE missing link between the picture and the<br/>intended sounds.  Maybe the time domain could represent what happens<br/>as one transitions from one order of magnitude (level of organization)<br/>to the next, and the frequency and amplitude material of the sound<br/>could reflect various solutions to the function.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to know so much math to approach these things as tables<br/>of numerical data relating to the solutions of these types of things<br/>are available, probably even on the internet.
