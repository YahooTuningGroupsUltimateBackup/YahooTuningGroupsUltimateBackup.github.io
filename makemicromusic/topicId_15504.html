You can&apos;t just say tuning X<br/>has mood(s) A, B, C. It may be true that some range of moods (or whatever)<br/>fall out naturall from some set of pitches... But it&apos;s a complicated<br/>relation, especially as the number of available tones increases. It&apos;s the<br/>*restricted* sets and the relationships within limited sets of pitches that<br/>impart the moods -- or rather &quot;flavors&quot;. E.g., you get different flavors<br/>with 12-ET than in unequal 12 tunings. You get different flavors from<br/>15-tet than 12-tet. But as you go up in the number of available tones, you<br/>tend to have more intervals that can emulate the intervals in sets with<br/>fewer available tones.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=15514 href="#15514">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2006 12:55:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:38 AM 12/17/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Bravo, or to use that most annoying wor--&quot;kudos&quot;--to the person who<br/>&gt;pointed out that there is a difference between a &quot;Scale&quot; and a &quot;tuning.&quot;</p><p>That was Jon Smith.

I think his observation was<br/>that if you play the same thing (or same kind of material) in different<br/>(especially in lower-numbered, like &lt; 24 or 53) ETs, you notice they<br/>each impart a &quot;mood&quot; to the material.  At least, that&apos;s something I<br/>can agree with.  An easy way to check it out is Herman Miller&apos;s warped<br/>canon page:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/warped-canon.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/warped-canon.html</a></p><p>&gt;I think a &quot;tuning&quot; is a very abstract object,  especially when<br/>&gt;one gets above, say, 13-16 tet;  from which one can extract actual<br/>&gt;scales (in my mind a scale has somewhere between 3 and 10 notes)<br/>&gt;which may have 1 (or more---look at the diatonic  scale, depending<br/>&gt;on which &quot;mode&quot; (phrygian, lydian, etc.) one emphasizes,  even<br/>&gt;just those 7 notes can project many moods) moods to project.</p><p>Agree.

There are two things:</p><p>1. The minimum step size.  If you use it.<br/>2. The mistuning amount and direction of the various<br/>consonances, if you use them.</p><p>So it&apos;s certainly possible to avoid this kind of mood, and of<br/>course any scales used will introduce less subtle moods on top.<br/>But the fact that the ear is wired to hear the consonances means<br/>that it has a way of comparing different tunings.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying I can hear the smallest step size difference<br/>between 16 and 17 (unless I try to listen for it under ideal<br/>conditions in a sample that&apos;s just slowly trilling the steps<br/>perhaps), or the consonance difference in a triad in 34 or<br/>one in 54 (unless I&apos;m counting beats under ideal conditions<br/>perhaps).  But with lowish number ETs (the kind Ivor was<br/>mostly dealing with), I think there may be somtehing to his<br/>observation.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15517 href="#15517">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2006 1:52:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this is basically correct but at the same time the one ET i<br/>know<br/>&gt; well, 31, i found it was just too restful and not having a really good<br/>&gt; 9/8 made it lack what that interval brings.</p><p>I think facts like that do give 31 a particular character. Of course<br/>you can sound very unrestful, but not in any way you might desire--for<br/>instance by using sharp fifths. There really aren&apos;t any; if you go up<br/>a diesis you get an interval which is a small fraction of a cent from<br/>that fine 17-limit interval, 26/17. If you force the poor thing to<br/>play the role of a fifth a la McLaren, it&apos;s not going to sound much<br/>like the sharp fifth of 46 or even 22.</p></div><h3><a id=15518 href="#15518">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2006 2:03:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not saying I can hear the smallest step size difference<br/>&gt; between 16 and 17 (unless I try to listen for it under ideal<br/>&gt; conditions in a sample that&apos;s just slowly trilling the steps<br/>&gt; perhaps), or the consonance difference in a triad in 34 or<br/>&gt; one in 54 (unless I&apos;m counting beats under ideal conditions<br/>&gt; perhaps).</p><p>I&apos;d be surprised if you couldn&apos;t tell the difference between 34 and 54<br/>in a side-by-side.
