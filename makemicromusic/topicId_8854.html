Caving to<br/>something because it is ubiquitous means that no one is motivated to move<br/>away from the inferior format that is mp3. Not caving means that the initial<br/>effort to change pays off when enough people are able to listen to Ogg-Vorbis<br/>files. The market works by demand only, and no or little demand for<br/>Ogg-Vorbis means being stuck with mp3 dominance. And the existence of that<br/>little demand happens because people say &quot;I should really just make this file<br/>and mp3&quot;. At some critical mass, enough people make a difference, and you<br/>have big companies like IBM massively pushing and underdog OS like Linux, to<br/>make a parallel example. OTOH, not doing this leads to a lackluster status<br/>quo, lack of innovation.</p><p>If I really want to see/hear something that is not in an easily available<br/>format, I as a user am motivated to get the appropriate software. End of<br/>story. As a distributor of content, putting the end user through that or not<br/>is a personal choice, I suppose. I believe we will, however, we all be better<br/>off using a superior audio codec, and we as musicians have to stick to our<br/>guns and be serious about supporting it, esp. since there is a lot of<br/>commercial/industrial support already for the competition.</p><p>Jon, I think your argument at this point is a red herring. The ease with which<br/>someone can download an Ogg-Vorbis player on any platform is so minimal. I<br/>realize that Dan&apos;s case is rare (being at the mercy of an ill-informed public<br/>library system administrator), but I don&apos;t want go out and cave in to mp3 on<br/>that case alone. Let the *library*, and everyone else, cave in and learn<br/>about a superior audio codec. I&apos;m sure at one point, the library computer<br/>couldn&apos;t play an mp3, either. They had to learn how to configure their<br/>browser to recognize *that* data type, and now they have another.

For the music I&apos;ve been making, the difference is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;quite non-trivial.  For example, my latest piece[1] is 17MB as an MP3,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and 2MB as an OGG, and this is at 320Kbps.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;- Dave<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Not possible.  320Kbps is 320Kbps.  I&apos;ve downloaded both your<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; oggs and mp3s, and your oggs are at a much lower bitrate, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; they don&apos;t sound as good.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;While it is true that a high quality mp3 and high quality ogg would be<br/>&gt; &gt;indistinguishable, the usual medium/low bitrates have consistently been<br/>&gt; &gt;in ogg&apos;s favor in ABX listening tests,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s true, but I&apos;m not interested in medium/low bitrates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;as well as winning for samller file size for comparable audio quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a different version of what you just said, minus the medium/low<br/>&gt; restriction.  And without that restriction, it isn&apos;t necc. true.  Unless<br/>&gt; an ABX test has been done at transparent bitrates since I&apos;ve last checked,<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no reason to believe Ogg is any better in this range.</p><p>Agreed. MP3 and OGG are indistinguishable at high bitrates, but that was never<br/>my argument. I said:</p><p>&quot;While it is true that a high quality mp3 and high quality ogg would be<br/>indistinguishable, the usual medium/low bitrates have consistently been in<br/>ogg&apos;s favor in ABX listening tests, as well as winning for samller file size<br/>for comparable audio quality.

It is as if one can attempt to do like things , but it gets you quickly into other areas. I believe when i first started on this list i mentioned that there was something to 22 tone scales in general as opposed to 31, which i tried first. It is as if when we expand to higher number tunings we want to subconsciously be able to give what we left an entirely new slant. 31 doesn&apos;t really do that.

But<br/>22 shines in its &quot;septimal diatonics&quot; which resemble Micheal<br/>Harrison&apos;s {2,3,7}-JI scales but have fewer wolves. For example, a<br/>septimal Aeolian 4 1 4 4 1 4 4 in 22-equal, which has three<br/>approximate 4:6:7:9 chords.</p><p>&gt; and  the 12 tone language.</p><p>The thing it has in common with 12-equal is that the &apos;commas&apos; 50:49<br/>and 64:63 (and thus 225:224 and 2048:2025 as well) vanish in both<br/>systems. You can think of these commas as defining scales of 10, 12,<br/>22, 34, 56 . . . notes per octave, as explained and illustrated in my<br/>new paper (which I sent you). The 10-note scales you may remember<br/>from my old paper, and they certainly &quot;work&quot; in both 12 and 22,<br/>though 22 does a bit less damage to the 5-limit, and a good deal less<br/>damage to the 7-limit, consonances.</p><p>&gt; It is as if one can attempt<br/>&gt; to do like things , but it gets you quickly into other areas.</p><p>I prefer to avoid the &quot;like&quot; things these days, and stick to<br/>the &quot;other areas&quot;, such as Porcupine.

Can you expand on this? My new<br/>paper does include more of the 22-compatible systems than the 31-<br/>compatible systems. But among the 31-compatible systems in there,<br/>you&apos;ll find not only the conventional Meantone with its normal<br/>diatonics (pentatonics, chromatics, etc), but also</p><p>Cynder (1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 in 31-equal is a 16-note<br/>Cynder scale),</p><p>Miracle (which you know),</p><p>Myna (1 5 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 5 1 in 31-equal is an 15-note Myna<br/>scale),</p><p>Orson/Orwell (3 1 3 3 1 3 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 in 31-equal is a 13-note<br/>Orson/Orwell scale), and</p><p>Wurschmidt (1 1 7 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 7 1 1 or 1 1 6 1 1 1 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6<br/>1 1).</p><p>But these alternate systems seem to require scales with a lot of<br/>notes (compared with 7 or 5 for Meantone) in order to project their<br/>underlying harmonies -- not to mention that many of these scales have<br/>those longish strings of 1s. It&apos;s hard to keep a whole lot of notes<br/>in your memory when listening, and also hard to project coherent<br/>scales that consist of long strings of tiny intervals. So you&apos;re<br/>right if you mean that 31 is awfully hard to find non-diatonic<br/>analogues to the diatonic system in.</p><p>&gt; I sense that much of your writing is in search<br/>&gt; for a &apos;justification&apos; of your preference for this.</p><p>Does that include the new paper I sent you? Any actual justification<br/>for the &apos;cutoffs&apos; I used, which precluded a lot more 31-compatible<br/>systems from being included, was left out. But the reason was to<br/>limit undue complexity, related to the desire for scales without a<br/>lot of notes I mentioned above. Is that what you were referring to?</p><p>&gt; while it does have a<br/>&gt; common thread with 12,</p><p>Just about every ET that you would arrive at through tempering has a<br/>common thread with 12 -- what doesn&apos;t?</p><p>&gt; it is differences that i sense is really what<br/>&gt; makes it come alive for you.</p><p>Yes -- Meantone in 31 does less damage to the harmonies than meantone<br/>in 12, but that alone doesn&apos;t make 31 exciting enough to justify the<br/>expense for me.
