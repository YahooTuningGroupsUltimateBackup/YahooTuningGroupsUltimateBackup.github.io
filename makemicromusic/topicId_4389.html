Rhino, the Big Tick newest soft synth, has been released.</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://bigtick.pastnotecut.org">http://bigtick.pastnotecut.org</a></p><p>I highly recommend you look at it. Special price is 80 euros until April when it goes up to 100 euros. Well worth it.</p><p>I have been able to emulate a few patches from my TX802, and this is a solid FM implementation that goes well beyond the TX802 capabilities.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
