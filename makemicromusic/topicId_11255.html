The alphorn, as some may know.<br/>is a famous swiss folk instrument, consisting of a single long tube<br/>and playing only tones of one harmonic overtone series - and that is<br/>the scale that I use in the piece, too.

You would be surprised at how much<br/>musicality is realized through subtle changes in amplitude after the<br/>start of a note. I use Csound to apply complex sound envelopes that<br/>have a distinct attack, variable sustain that might go up and down 5<br/>times during a single note, and decay with the right amount of fade<br/>before the next note. And the space between notes is carefully<br/>managed, much like the articulation of a pianist. I change the<br/>envelopes, often many times in the same phrase. I alter the timbre by<br/>upsampling or downsampling from the &quot;correct&quot; samples. For example, I<br/>might play middle C Midi using a sample recorded on an instrument at G<br/>a fifth above the C, which results in a more mellow sound. Or G a<br/>fourth below for a harsher sound. I switch between one and the other<br/>inside a phrase to mimic the subtle timbre changes moving towards and<br/>away from the bridge on a violin or guitar. There is a lot more to<br/>making a &quot;real&quot; sounding instrument that finding a perfect sample<br/>library.</p><p>That said, I am working on making the Iowa University sample library<br/>compatible with Csound. It takes about 12-24 hours of processing per<br/>note to find the optimum loop points (I do it while I sleep). Each<br/>instrument was recorded with one semitone per sample. The flute and<br/>trombone are especially charming. I can assure you that it will sound<br/>lifeless and electronic unless you take care with the envelopes and<br/>sample choices.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>&quot;Fake but Accurate&quot; music with Csound</p><p>&gt; To be<br/>&gt; convinced it&apos;s worth persuing, I&apos;d like to hear examples of people who<br/>&gt; really get it to work as I&apos;d like it to. That wouldn&apos;t include Prent,<br/>&gt; since he uses samples, not synthesized sound.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2005 8:14:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Hans,</p><p>I like these pieces (including the instrument sounds).

The alphorn, as some may know. &gt; is a famous swiss folk instrument, consisting of a single long tube &gt; and playing only tones of one harmonic overtone series - and that is &gt; the scale that I use in the piece, too. The privilege of the virtual &gt; alphorn over the real one is, of course, the possibility to play &gt; more than one harmonic series - and, in consequence, the possibility &gt; to modulate!<br/>&gt; &gt; The beginning of the piece may sound a little like in some of the &gt; folk pieces - but soon it drifts off, especially towards much use of &gt; the weirder intervals of the harmonic series, such as the 11/8 and &gt; 13/8.<br/>&gt; &gt; The programming was all done in csound - the orc is derived from a &gt; french horn sound downloadable from &gt; <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/csound/index.html">http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/csound/index.html</a>, while &gt; the score was typed entirely be hand (phew!).
