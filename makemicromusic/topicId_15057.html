While I hope to produce a nicer PostScript and PDF version with<br/>these glitches and errors corrected, the timeliness of the discussion<br/>moves me to made the material available now:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip</a>&gt;</p><p>Above all, I would urge that this companion article be read together<br/>with your presentation, George, which fittingly precedes it in XH18:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>One quirk that people may notice in my quick PostScript/PDF version is<br/>that the last page of one portion reappears as the first page of the<br/>next portion -- with added text for the new section. This should<br/>confirm just how &quot;raw&quot; a version it is, for which I offer apologies<br/>but plead that prudence may have been overcome by the intoxicating<br/>spirit of your generosity and service in making your own article<br/>available on the World Wide Web.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2006 2:27:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is fantastic...thanks!</p><p>Oh yes, very pertinent and perceptive stuff...</p><p>But it wasn&apos;t very nice to post this the very hour my printer ran out<br/>of ink. ;-)</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
