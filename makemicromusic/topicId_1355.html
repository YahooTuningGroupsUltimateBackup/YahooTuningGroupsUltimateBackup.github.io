However, if someone were just starting, it<br/>would be hard to recommend this because the ASR was orphaned when<br/>Ensoniq was acquired by Creative Labs...</p><p>Jacky - you mention using Unity. Last year when I downlaoded a demo,<br/>I found that I couldnt use both the microtonal features and the<br/>legato modes at the same time. Have they fixed this?<br/>Its the primary reason that I didnt purchase it...</p></div>
