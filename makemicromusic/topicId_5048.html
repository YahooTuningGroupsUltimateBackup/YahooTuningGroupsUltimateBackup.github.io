I say this because you&apos;ve asked the question in 2 different microtonal music forums, and on top of that you say:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kalamataguy&quot; &lt;kalamataguy@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Yo make weird music!</p><p>Well, I&apos;m all for weird music. But you&apos;ve made this big kbd assemblage, and I wonder: what did you have in mind for all those keys, if all you wanted to do was stay in the same scale that every piano has? Are you simply trying to find new patterns of music, even if in traditional 12 tone equal temperament, by placing a large number of keys within reach of each other?</p><p>If you put this together without a general purpose in mind, I myself don&apos;t really have a clue as to how best to put it into use; if you had a driving force behind it (or even just a dream of something) maybe you could share a little more about that with us, and we might make some better suggestions.</p><p>On last question: is this a strictly &quot;on-off&quot; kbd, or is it touch-sensitive?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who is welcomes you to MMM, and hopes you&apos;ll find some interesting new pitches for all those keys...)</p></div><h3><a id=5054 href="#5054">ðŸ”—</a>kalamataguy &#x3C;kalamataguy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2003 7:31:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Jon,</p><p>Carl Lumma best answered a few questions:</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a tradeoff, not a limit. By narrowing the octave, the hand<br/>can span a greater portion of the tuning. And by making it diatonic<br/>only, you eliminate the chance of &apos;wrong notes&apos; (where &apos;wrong&apos; is<br/>non-diatonic, at any rate).&quot;</p><p>I will use it to expeiment and see what I can come up with.<br/>perhaps try microtuning in the future.</p><p>Please note that I improvise and want to try new<br/>ideas.</p><p>Where I need help is how to map it in Cubase SX.</p><p>&gt; On last question: is this a strictly &quot;on-off&quot; kbd, or is it touch-<br/>sensitive?</p><p>It is velocity sensetive.</p><p>&gt; Jon (who is welcomes you to MMM, and hopes you&apos;ll find some<br/>interesting new pitches for all those keys...)</p><p>Thanks for the welcome.
