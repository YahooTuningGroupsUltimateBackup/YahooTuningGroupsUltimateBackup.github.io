To<br/>&gt;  extend what already exists.<br/>&gt; *********************************************************</p><p>Personally, I&apos;m not convinced that upgradability is that big a deal.<br/>Fixed-pitch instruments need to be redesigned at any rate, so while<br/>you&apos;re at it, why not adjust some of the 12= notes?  And<br/>flexible-pitch instruments don&apos;t need to stick to 12 anyway.  *For me<br/>personally,* I&apos;m attracted to microtones because I&apos;m tired of &quot;what<br/>already exists&quot; in the western classical tradition, so upward<br/>compatibility doesn&apos;t matter much to me.  And once you move to<br/>anything microtonal, you&apos;ve alienated 90% of performers anyway, so<br/>that&apos;s an issue no matter what :)</p><p>&gt;   Not sure what you meant by this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot;flexible language &quot;</p><p>Traditional staff notation is not flexible, in that one can *only*<br/>designate 12-equal pitches.  Of course, variable-pitch instruments<br/>have been adapting the tuning of traditional scores for centuries, but<br/>theoretically, it is inflexible.  On the other hand, notation that<br/>uses either cent values or frequency ratios or whatever is<br/>theoretically capable of expressing *any* tuning ever created, or that<br/>ever could be created.  Therefore, my hope would be that the diversity<br/>of tunings would continue, but that a standard notation of them would<br/>become more well-known and well-taught, to make new music more<br/>accessable to more performers.</p><p>My final thought on the matter is that IMO it is extrememely unlikely<br/>that any standard can become a common standard in our post-modern,<br/>post-western, pluralistic world.  300 years ago, there was a common<br/>(even while evolving) perception of &quot;good music.&quot;  When everyone has a<br/>similar idea of what &quot;good music&quot; consists of, common standards<br/>develop to realize that music.  Now, on the other hand, while each of<br/>us today may have a clear idea of our personal perception of &quot;good<br/>music,&quot; none of us (or very few of us) would go around trying to<br/>prosyletize others to join our camp.  Those that do are labeled and<br/>shunned... most times for good reason.  If you don&apos;t believe me, send<br/>a post out telling the JI people that their tunings are inferior to<br/>EDOs, or tell the EDOs that their tunings are &quot;unnatural,&quot; and see<br/>what happens ;)  The point I&apos;m trying to make is, people today are<br/>very happy pursuing their own artistic goals, and letting others<br/>pursue theirs; if you like the tuning, and if you have electronics<br/>and/or performers to play you music, then great!  There&apos;s no need to<br/>enforce it on the rest of the world :)  I think I speak for most<br/>people when I say that.  That plurality is both good and bad, because<br/>it creates a musical culture that it both diverse and fractured.  I<br/>comfort myself when I hear my favorite composers because I know that<br/>good music is still being made, and it couldn&apos;t have been made under<br/>any standard.  Maybe 100 years from now it will be lost... that&apos;s<br/>something one has to accept.  But my own personal conclusion is...</p><p>to hell with the standards, and do what you want!</p><p>:-D</p><p>(p.s.

The point, of course, is that it&apos;s a multiple of<br/>&gt; &gt; 12.</p><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>I don&apos;t think the value of a tuning can be judged by<br/>the number of performers who use it, nor by the<br/>number of works written in it.  If we allowed a<br/>popular vote to rule the day, we&apos;d all give up on<br/>everything else and go with the flow - 12-EDO!</p><p>... to every music-lover&apos;s detriment, of course.</p><p>Of course, to be useful in making music, a tuning<br/>has to be practical to use.  But given the wealth<br/>of new instruments we have under our fingertips,<br/>even a 12000-EDO tuning is eminently practical<br/>for some kinds of music, if not for acoustic<br/>instruments.</p><p>The practicality of 31-EDO and 72-EDO will<br/>depend not only on the instruments, but also on<br/>the performers themselves.

And not as long as<br/>the Monteux recording of Le Sacre (with the Rousseau painting on the<br/>cover). And not as long as either Jacky Gleason&apos;s Velvet Brass or<br/>Martin Denny&apos;s Exotica.

But<br/>switching tuning will never be profitable, because (paraphrasing what<br/>Kraig said) the young masses aren&apos;t listening to the tuning anyway.<br/>Therefore...

Does one want to be a commercial success or not?<br/>&gt; &gt;      If one wants to be a commercial success ( and therefore<br/>&gt;      establish microtonal music, as 12 EDO is established) one<br/>&gt;      should look at what popular music has. (I can&apos;t take this<br/>&gt;      very far myself.) It almost always has relavant lyrics,<br/>&gt;      {{lyrics about romance,for example}}<br/>&gt;      a melody line, a beat ( and of course, beautiful people).</p><p>Then there&apos;s the other approach ... doing music as a hobby, without any intention of being a commercial success. One of the things that I want when I&apos;m writing music or improvising on the keyboard is more of the kinds of things I like to hear, but don&apos;t get enough of from commercial recordings. What I end up with doesn&apos;t always live up to those expectations, but I&apos;ve had a few what I consider to be &quot;successes&quot; by my own standards. I&apos;ve had cases where music originally written in 12-ET ended up sounding more interesting when converted to another tuning (<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Transformation-vsc.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Transformation-vsc.mp3</a>) as well as music originally written in a non-12 tuning that doesn&apos;t work at all in 12-ET (<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/porcupine-absynth.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/porcupine-absynth.mp3</a>).</p><p>&gt;      There is much written here about math and ratios (which<br/>&gt;      is fine)...yet 12 EDO is said by many to lack so much,<br/>&gt;      and be so out of tune.<br/>&gt;      Yet the multi-billion dollar record industry is based<br/>&gt;      on it. Most people in the West love one or more styles<br/>&gt;      of 12 EDO music, yet hate,or are at least indifferent<br/>&gt;      to other styles of 12 EDO music. Sure, it&apos;s out of tune, but that&apos;s not always a bad thing. It just seems overused and bland compared to the variety of tunings used in other parts of the world. Some of those are more &quot;in tune&quot; than others, but I like both kinds. (My CD collection is nothing compared to Kraig Grady&apos;s or Carl Lumma&apos;s, but I&apos;ve got probably over 100 CD&apos;s of world music from every continent except Antarctica.) It&apos;s also an interesting challenge to try to write listenable music in a &quot;bad&quot; tuning, as I did once with 13-et (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/triskaidekaphobia.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/triskaidekaphobia.mid</a>) and I&apos;ve attempted to do with other &quot;challenging&quot; tunings such as 11-et and 18-ET (<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Unfinished-11et.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Unfinished-11et.mp3</a>, <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/18et-sketch.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/18et-sketch.mp3</a>).</p><p>&gt;      Conclusion(?) As much as I see the logic or moving<br/>&gt;      to 24 (in varied versions if you wish) or 19 or 31 etc.<br/>&gt;      the logic and math involved are &gt;      largley irrelavant to its future. And arguments about popularity are largely irrelevant to this list, which is about using a variety of tuning systems to make music. But I have to admit that it&apos;d be pretty cool if &quot;alternative tuning&quot; started to catch on with popular writers and performers. Many of them probably just don&apos;t know what they&apos;re missing out on.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2005 1:32:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One of the things that I want<br/>&gt; when I&apos;m writing music or improvising on the keyboard is more of the<br/>&gt; kinds of things I like to hear, but don&apos;t get enough of from commercial<br/>&gt; recordings.</p><p>Once again it seems we are peas belonging to the same pod.

Thus I&apos;d say that the play of tension and release<br/>relative to the *expectations* based on previous listening is about 9<br/>times more important than the tension and release in the objective<br/>physical aspects of the sound. And since the former can work just as<br/>well with just about any other tuning system or scale, I only 10%<br/>agree with you. But I&apos;ve always been one to go the extra 10%!</p><p>Anyway, why is this discussion happening on this list? Can we move it<br/>elsewhere, so as to keep MMM on-topic?
