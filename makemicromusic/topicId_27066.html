I&apos;m working on a CD project with Bill Hill, a master percussionist/composer, and the charts are difficult, indeed. A tune called &quot;Molybdenum,&quot; which is sorta heavy funk/fusion, has a lot of tough time signatures...the melody goes from measures of 7/8 to 10/8, with a lot of syncopation, and the melody crossing bar lines...really hard to count or feel. Then, there&apos;s a section of 13/16, followed by 6/16 and 7/16 (still 13, but phrased differently)...then a cut time samba feel, back to 7/8 to 10/8, a bunch more 6/16 to 7/16, and that&apos;s it! I&apos;ve been woodshedding this one every day, can finally read through it, but haven&apos;t rehearsed it yet with the ensemble...should be a hoot. Had to have a great sight reading friend come over and help me...he broke it down, and showed me cool ways to count it, which I woulda never thought of myself...more later...best...Stickman<br/><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2011 5:37:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I consider rhythm to be ultra-low pitch.

Polyrhythms are then Just<br/>Intonation.

Polyrhythms are therefore rhythmic harmony.</p><p>I like the idea of Just Intonation music where polyrhythms are derived from<br/>the JI scale. The rhythms are tuned to the scale.</p><p>Mat Cooper.&quot;</p><p>The cymbal is in the Fibonacci series counting by measures. Then there is a<br/>drum at every whole, half, half tripelet, and quarter note. This gives a<br/>series of 1:2:3:4 - which are off set slightly since in the real world the<br/>sound source would be out of phase. And then to top it off I gradually<br/>change the tempo from 10 bpm to 1000 bpm (as fast as Sonar X1 will go). My<br/>hope was that you&apos;d hear a pitch - but I don&apos;t really.
