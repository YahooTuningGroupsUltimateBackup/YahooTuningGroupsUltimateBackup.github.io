Ambient music is sorta tricky...it can be nice, pretty, interesting, but still maybe not that great on a deeper level...it&apos;s technically pretty easy, overall to perform, and can be a refuge for folks that are not really technically proficient. Yet, I thought Ivor Darreg&apos;s CD &quot;Detwelveulate&quot; was great...not a lot of compositional chops, but the many moods he created were substantial; he had a great imagination, which really helps. And Wendy Carlos&apos;s &quot;Sonic Seasonings&quot; is a masterpiece...she mixes musical tonalities with various real life sounds, and there are two bonus tracks on later editions which use JI tunings as well...she is a great artist....wish she would put something new out...bets...Hstick<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2011 6:47:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here are two of my ambient albums<br/><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/search/all/vaisvil">http://www.jamendo.com/en/search/all/vaisvil</a></p><p>I recommend Orion Nebula over Dallas seeing how it is newer.</p><p>On Wed, Feb 2, 2011 at 6:32 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My 3rd CD, &quot;Other Worlds,&quot; is all electronic, guitar synth based music,<br/>&gt; with pieces in 12, 19, 34, and fretless (with John Starrett on Starrboard).<br/>&gt; Ambient?
