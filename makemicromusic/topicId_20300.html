Maybe you can still find one with a serial port, but I&apos;m not optimistic about that either.  Not much need anymore with USB and Firewire.</p><p>I&apos;m very happy with my PreSonus Firebox (<a href="http://bit.ly/L2QV">http://bit.ly/L2QV</a>).  Balanced in, balanced out (all .25-inch).  Just did my first gig with it with realtime SuperCollider, and it came out very well.  I am considering getting adapter cables for the output though, .25-inch male to DIN female, to make it easier for the sound guy to hook me up to a PA -- this ought to work as well as a direct box.  At home, I use it with powered speakers.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Aaron Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey Micro-ers,<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m in the market for a new laptop, but I wanted to do lots of research<br/>&gt; first.

Debian (and thus<br/>Ubuntu) has the greatest packaging system, APT, the most packages of<br/>any distro, which means more music apps, too, but---I can&apos;t stand<br/>their zealous purity with licensing: makes doing anything practical<br/>like getting online with a wireless card that needs corporate firmware<br/>an unnecessary chore. And I wish they had an i686 package<br/>branch---they have this thing for being &apos;universal&apos; so they compile<br/>for processors that noone uses anymore (like the Alpha) but they won&apos;t<br/>compile packages optimized for Pentium pro and its descendants!</p><p>Ah, anyway...let&apos;s continue in metatuning if you want to say more.</p><p>-AKJ.</p></div><h3><a id=20307 href="#20307">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>1/14/2009 4:21:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My acer aspire 5102 has line in and has served me well since Oct 06.

When you plug in a cable, the audio driver asks you what type of connection you just plugged in (line in, mic in, headphone, speaker out, digital out, etc.) and supposedly adjusts the signal according to your response. I&apos;ve only seen this kind of software running under Windows and I have no idea how the audio interface would behave under Linux. Not to mention, my personal experience is built-in laptop audio interfaces are only good for operating system sound effects.

But there certainly is a bunch of EMI inside<br/>a computer chassis, while most interfaces I&apos;ve seen use external<br/>D/C adapters, so I could see the argument maybe.

I just<br/>got one.  It&apos;s much more commodity than, and I doubt as good as,<br/>the UA-1000.  But it&apos;s also smaller and cheaper.

Aliasing<br/>just sounds like crap for one thing.</p><p>Extreme internal bit rates are much rarer, the Algorithmix EQ plugins<br/>are the only examples I can think of. They use up to 81 bits<br/>internally, IIRC, and are widely considered not only the best computer<br/>EQs but some of the best EQs of any kind (they are stunning, you can<br/>try the demos for 14 days). They also oversample internally, 8x IIRC,<br/>which is a much more common process.</p><p>But 192k ADDA for consumer gear is pretty dubious. 192k must be more<br/>error prone (clocking) compared to say 48k, and combined with cheap<br/>analog circuitry, there&apos;s no way the ADDA is going to sound great.</p><p>That being said I have a new 192k consumer toy for travel, a USB ADDA,<br/>which sounds very good and has lots of gizmos considering it only cost<br/>150 dollars. The MIDI latency is unbelievably fast for consumer laptop<br/>with USB. In the year 2009 a musician should not settle for more than<br/>a couple of milliseconds of latency. Not counting the nanoseconds<br/>responses of real analog gear (which does not include most of what<br/>people call &quot;analog&quot;), a laptop should be hardware-quick today.</p><p>By the way an ideal practical rate for ADDA was thoroughly reasoned<br/>out and proposed long ago, and as far as I can tell it still holds.<br/>58k or 64k or something around there, can&apos;t remember exactly.</p></div>
