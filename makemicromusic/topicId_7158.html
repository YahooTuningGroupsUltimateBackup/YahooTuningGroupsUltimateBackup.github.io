Rod Poole has as well as<br/>Erv Wilson ( possibly Ivor had his done here too) was Caruthers. I would send a<br/>note to Rod at<br/>ladawpoole at <a href="http://sbcglobal.net">sbcglobal.net</a></p><p>jrinkel@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been subscribed for a few months now, but I&apos;m not sure I have posted to<br/>&gt; this list before or not.  I posted this question on the tuning list, but since<br/>&gt; this list looks like it will be closing down soon :-(  I will go ahead and<br/>&gt; repeat my question(s) here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am interesting in having guitars refretted for various tunings such as 19edo,<br/>&gt; 22edo, and lucy tuning.  I have already found one luthier who does this sort of<br/>&gt; work (in Massachusettes), and I have already sent him a guitar to modify for<br/>&gt; lucy tuning -- I sent him all of the necessary details.  I was just wondering<br/>&gt; if anybody else knows of other luthiers / guitar repair people who are capable<br/>&gt; of doing this sort of work.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be happy with the work from this one<br/>&gt; luthier, but it never hurts to know of other resources in case one person gets<br/>&gt; too busy to be able to do a refret for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any ideas from people on this list?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jay<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
