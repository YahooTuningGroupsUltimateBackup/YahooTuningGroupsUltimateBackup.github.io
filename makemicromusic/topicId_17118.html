Your comments are always welcome, thanks.</p><p>Let it be known that I come down firmly on the side of the artist&apos;s<br/>vision of her/his work at all times, though from my own perspective as<br/>an artist -- and as an audience member as well --I might look askance at<br/>the methods and results. I do gently poke a finger into the side of my<br/>fellow composers, now and again.</p><p>All artists know there&apos;s a fine and difficult line to be walked -- a<br/>true razor&apos;s edge -- between their artistic vision and the public<br/>perception of that vision. If I am unconcerned with the public and don&apos;t<br/>give a fig for their opinion, or their ability to absorb what my art is<br/>trying to say or the methods I use, then I can compose just about<br/>anything I want to my heart&apos;s content; but who&apos;s listening to it, aside<br/>from (perhaps) a tiny clique of enthusiasts? It&apos;s a bit ironic for me to<br/>desire artistic acceptance while composing music that drives people<br/>away. And I&apos;m speaking here in the widest terms possible, to include<br/>music of any kind at all -- classical, popular or what have you.</p><p>(On the other hand, concerning myself *only* with public opinion and<br/>taste probably makes me a panderer and a pimp.)</p><p>There&apos;s also another line to walk -- that between information and noise.<br/>When you have a vision that contains a good deal of complexity, it<br/>borders on &quot;noise&quot; to those who haven&apos;t had time to sort it out. Art has<br/>always been about &quot;information&quot;, about communicating a message or vision<br/>-- even if the message doesn&apos;t require words, but emotions.</p><p>Many of the tunings discussed and used here on the list are acoustically<br/>complex, and their xenharmonies even more so. I&apos;ve ever only wanted to<br/>remind my friends to mix a little sugar with all that medicine, to have<br/>a bit of consideration for the unaccustomed ears of the audience (a<br/>hypothetical or potential audience beyond we few).</p><p>Making &quot;inroads into the public consciousness&quot; is about finding ways to<br/>open the ears of society to new tunings. I can be as iconoclastic as I<br/>please, but stooping to write an enjoyable piece in a less complex<br/>tuning once in a while, goes a long way to preparing more and more<br/>people for tunings that are more and more complex.</p><p>I&apos;ve called myself a &quot;classical&quot; sort of guy, and so I am. But the<br/>&quot;classical&quot; music crowd is even more conservative about these things<br/>than even the general public; so I write compositions with tunings in<br/>sundry JIs, Pythagorean or some other suitable equal-temperaments like<br/>19.</p><p>Daniel Thompson wrote his &quot;Study&quot; for organ in 12 of 26-ET, yet<br/>generated favorable responses from some rather staid members of the<br/>Delian Society -- but his &quot;Study&quot; used a style and progressions familiar<br/>to his audience, thus softening them up for the &quot;kill&quot; (so to speak).<br/>His &quot;Nocturne&quot; in 17-ET will make a similar impression, and I hope to<br/>have a really nice rendition for him shortly.</p><p>(BTW guys, I posted a new rendition of his &quot;Study&quot; at my ZeBox page a<br/>while back, which was thoroughly ignored while the rest of you plotted<br/>anarchic acts in celebration of MMM Month. Now that you have your Marx<br/>Bros. antics out of your systems, do go back and have a listen.)</p><p>Essentially, I can (and do) respect both artists and their particular<br/>visions; but I won&apos;t lie and say I like something when I don&apos;t. You&apos;ll<br/>remember, Dan, that when I first wrote to you off-list I said I found<br/>most of your music too complex and dissonant for me to absorband enjoy;<br/>yet I have heard some other works of yours that were haunting and<br/>strange in a most beautiful way, and have said so. (I&apos;m not above doing<br/>the &quot;wild thing&quot; either, as our recent collaboration attests.)  I<br/>understand that your visions -- and the visions of others -- will<br/>include works that I can&apos;t follow, and I have no problem at all with<br/>that.</p><p>Humorous note: Here at MMM, I&apos;m thought too traditionalist, while at the<br/>Delians&apos; list I&apos;m a radical &quot;microtonalist&quot; who&apos;s talents(?) are best<br/>suited to composing music for dolphins. That&apos;s funny.</p><p>Best,</p><p>jls</p></div>
