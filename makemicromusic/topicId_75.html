I purposely<br/>kept the aria short in deference to everyone who&apos;s not on cable/dsl.<br/>If bandwidth isn&apos;t a big deal for you, here is some of my most recent<br/>stuff with vocals.</p><p><a href="http://208.233.94.147/Channel.html">http://208.233.94.147/Channel.html</a>.</p><p>Actually any vocals you hear in the music I post is me.  And I do 12<br/>TET too (oh my) although I don&apos;t post it here. I love being able to<br/>sing, and I love being able to use a real human voice with all the<br/>electronics.  Its also real portable and I don&apos;t need a midi relay<br/>program to make it microtonal :-)</p></div>
