Kontakt, from what I can tell (see next bit) is in the &apos;you can tune the notes&apos; category; they don&apos;t support any of the current standardized tuning files for import. They may (memory slipping) have a few built-in preset tunings, but I think most of us find that a lame nod at tuning. And there doesn&apos;t seem to be anyone who wants to implements a product-line-wide feature set for tunings.</p><p>(let me tell you: making demo versions match the most recent full versions is sometimes *not* the highest priority on a company&apos;s hot-list - I&apos;ve only been able to glean implementation by documentation)</p><p>Alison, you out there?

One merely would take multiple samples and then adjust pitch and save as new notes. But either method means not only a lot more work, but no immediate feedback if you come up with a new tuning. Not good enough, I say, if one wants to explore. But if you settle on a particular tuning, nothing will get you as good a sound as custom crafting the sample set itself.</p><p>I&apos;m really impressed with the sound *quality* of rgc:audio&apos;s sfz+ soundfont player. I hadn&apos;t given soundfonts a lot of credit, but this thing took a single wave file and did a pretty damn good job of transposing without too much artifacts.

I &gt;guess not enough people ask them for it.</p><p>I know you are a pretty recent member, but one of the things that has been nice to see is that a few of the members of MMM, by working closely with developers, have actually been catalysts for tuning to be an added feature. It is very much the case that you just don&apos;t simply ask for the tuning support, but you show them why it is important, point to music that uses these features, give them background on file formats, etc. You help them work it out a bit, and likelihood of inclusion goes up.</p><p>It also seems that this is a bottom-up situation, as the small developers seem both more approachable and more interested in a niche feature like microtuning support. The big boys have no interest, they just want to move units, and they&apos;ll include the feature set that appeals to the most common audience.</p><p>The weird thing is a company like NI: FM7 supports microtuning, Absynth has a few presets and a promised internal tuning editor (hell, just import one of the file formats!), Kontakt or Kompakt supposedly has *some* internal tuning feature, and the other fine instruments have none at all. No company-wide vision on this aspect.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 12:38:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;zquatch&quot; &lt;zquatch@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Does anyone know of an inexpensive software sampler that can be<br/>&gt; retuned?

It&apos;s also not<br/>necessary, just that it would be easier then having to figure which<br/>note is which.   I&apos;m pretty sure there aren&apos;t any programs that<br/>currently do what exactly what I want, but I thought it would be<br/>worth mentioning in case I was incorrect, as I was on the sampler,<br/>since CronoX looks to be exactly what I want for that.</p><p>&gt; There are a few environments floating around out there that you can<br/>patch<br/>&gt; objects together to create a lot of what you want (Bidule -<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.plogue.com/">http://www.plogue.com/</a> or energyXT - <a href="http://www.xt-hq.com/">http://www.xt-hq.com/</a> - or<br/>maybe the<br/>&gt; VAZ modular system would do what you want - [have to Google<br/>it...]). But<br/>&gt; none of these will go into notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if you want a tracker that can do non12, I&apos;m betting that is<br/>going to<br/>&gt; be a real, real challenge to find. Are there tracking newsgroups,<br/>forums, etc?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m positive you&apos;re correct on this, I&apos;ve thought about trying to<br/>make such a program, but am not the best programmer, someday I may<br/>try to tackle that. I know someone who has VAZ modular, and it almost<br/>does what I would want.</p><p>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2004 1:31:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
