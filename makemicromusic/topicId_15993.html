There&apos;s a lot that I like about 26 edo. I<br/>enjoy the triad 0, 277, 692 (in cents). It has an approximation of<br/>7/6 that&apos;s about 10 cents sharp and an approximation of 3/2 that is<br/>about 10 cents flat. The directions of the discrepancies, however,<br/>seem to produce a triad that is a little more spatially balanced than<br/>the corresponding justly tuned triad, while still having a nice<br/>flavor of septimal harmony.</p><p>The distance from 277 to 692 is about 415 cents. You can modulate to<br/>a mode that uses 415 cents as a sort of approximation of a major<br/>third (perhaps a Pythagorean major third), but it is pretty sharp.<br/>There seems to be a pretty strong urge to modulate back to the<br/>septimal minor mode. When I compose in 12 edo I feel the opposite<br/>urge to go from minor to major. You could also use a minor third of<br/>323 and a major third of 369, but the minor is still closer than the<br/>major. The minor modes sound strong and powerful to me. You can also<br/>have some interesting modulations where you go from one type of minor<br/>to the other or one type of major to the other.</p><p>26 edo has an equally tempered tritone. The tritone seems to me to<br/>have a stronger function in 26 edo. I speculate that this may have<br/>something to do with the fact that the fifth is pretty flat. A<br/>perfectly tuned fifth divides the octave in a linear sense, while a<br/>tempered tritone divides an octave in a logarithmic sense. Since the<br/>fifth is flat, I wonder if the emphasis is shifted somewhat towards<br/>the tritone as a sort of alternate point of symmetry. I also like the<br/>way the tritone is asymmetrically divided into two different minor<br/>like intervals (277 and 323 cents).</p><p>I don&apos;t know if any of this makes sense to any one but me. I&apos;m still<br/>trying to come to terms with this temperament. There is a lot of<br/>speculation involved. I do know that I like the sound of it.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cody Hallenbeck&quot;<br/>&lt;codyhallenbeck@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool piece!

You get the 16-note scale by splitting the 3-steps into smaller steps of 1 and 2 degrees of 26-ET (2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2). Instead of a chain of fifths, lemba has a chain of approximate 8/7 intervals (5 steps of 26-ET); a fifth is approximated by three of those intervals (15 steps of 26-ET).</p><p>Another temperament of interest is injera, which repeats at the half-octave (like lemba), but is based on a chain of fifths or fourths (like meantone). The generator of injera temperament is 2 steps of 26-ET. One nice thing about this temperament is that it has a 12-note scale which can easily be adapted to the traditional piano keyboard.</p><p>Also of theoretical possibility, there&apos;s cynder (aka mothra), which has a 5-step generator (like lemba), but repeats at the octave, and superkleismic, with a 7-step generator. I don&apos;t know whether these are useful in the context of 26-ET, but it might be worth a try.</p></div><h3><a id=16001 href="#16001">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2007 7:40:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot;</p><p>&gt; And there&apos;s no wanna-be 5/4, what a relief! :-)</p><p>I&apos;m curious from whence comes the fashionable hatred of this interval?</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3><a id=16006 href="#16006">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2007 1:30:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot;<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And there&apos;s no wanna-be 5/4, what a relief! :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m curious from whence comes the fashionable hatred of this<br/>interval?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -A.</p><p>Hahaha!

These examples<br/>aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; actually tuned in 26-ET, but they could be adapted without much<br/>trouble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/lemba2.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/lemba2.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/lemba-galatsia.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/lemba-galatsia.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The basic 10-note lemba scale in 26-ET has alternating steps of 2<br/>and 3<br/>&gt; degrees of 26-ET (3 2 3 2 3 3 2 3 2 3). You get the 16-note scale<br/>by<br/>&gt; splitting the 3-steps into smaller steps of 1 and 2 degrees of 26-<br/>ET (2<br/>&gt; 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2). Instead of a chain of fifths, lemba<br/>has<br/>&gt; a chain of approximate 8/7 intervals (5 steps of 26-ET); a fifth is<br/>&gt; approximated by three of those intervals (15 steps of 26-ET).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another temperament of interest is injera, which repeats at the<br/>&gt; half-octave (like lemba), but is based on a chain of fifths or<br/>fourths<br/>&gt; (like meantone). The generator of injera temperament is 2 steps of<br/>&gt; 26-ET. One nice thing about this temperament is that it has a 12-<br/>note<br/>&gt; scale which can easily be adapted to the traditional piano keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also of theoretical possibility, there&apos;s cynder (aka mothra), which<br/>has<br/>&gt; a 5-step generator (like lemba), but repeats at the octave, and<br/>&gt; superkleismic, with a 7-step generator. I don&apos;t know whether these<br/>are<br/>&gt; useful in the context of 26-ET, but it might be worth a try.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for the information and music examples. I especially liked the<br/>first one in 26 edo. It has a kind of sound that I&apos;ve never achieved<br/>in this temperament. It&apos;s nice to get a better idea of what some of<br/>the possibilities are.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Daniel Thompson</p></div><h3><a id=16028 href="#16028">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2007 7:45:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think other people have given it a try. A very different &gt; temperament with sharp rather than flat thirds is 27, and for some &gt; reason that isn&apos;t tried as much. In fact, so far as I know I&apos;m the &gt; only one who has tried it. It&apos;s quite musically feasible, however. &gt; 26+27=53, showing the errors of the two cancelling out. However, 27 &gt; has better fifths (though of course very different ones) and much &gt; better major and minor thirds. 26 has a much better 7/4, but taken as &gt; a whole 27 does much better with septimal intervals also. Why it gets &gt; ignored in favor of 26 all the time I don&apos;t know. Of course, George &gt; Secor thinks it&apos;s a garbage tuning, but I suppose he&apos;d say the same &gt; about 26.</p><p>I did a 27-ET version of Galticeran which is a nice change from the 21-ET version. It has a nice shimmering quality, not as gloomy as the one in 21-ET.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/Galticeran27.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/Galticeran27.mid</a></p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/Galticeran21.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/Galticeran21.mid</a></p><p>In the end I preferred the 21-ET version since it was a better match for the particular mood I was trying to achieve, but there&apos;s a lot of good qualities in the 27-ET version (and both of these turned out better than the previous retunings I tried).</p></div>
