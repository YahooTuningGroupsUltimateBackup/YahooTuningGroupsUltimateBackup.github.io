The<br/>only Neidhard tmeperament I have directions for is a very balnd<br/>slight variation on ET, but I have heard of an &apos;Aaron -- Neidhardt<br/>Modified Meantone&apos;, I just don&apos;t know the details. Does anybody&apos;s<br/>reference library include anything about this?</p><p>Judy</p></div>
