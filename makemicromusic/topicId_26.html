I was living in<br/>Philadelphia and had just started 10th grade at<br/>Lamberton School.</p><p>My models were obviously Haydn and Mozart, with<br/>a few perverse melodic and harmonic twists of<br/>my own... I was also a big fan of Prokofiev&apos;s<br/>&quot;Classical Symphony&quot;, which is much in the same vein.</p><p>I wrote down most of the material that was in my<br/>head, but did leave some big holes where I could<br/>&quot;hear&quot; the music in my mind but never bothered<br/>(or felt like figuring out how) to write it down.</p><p>In New York in June 1980, a few weeks after finishing<br/>my first year at Manhattan School of Music, I sat at<br/>the piano and filled in the holes in the &quot;B&quot; section<br/>of the 3rd movement.  I was interested in completing<br/>the score at that time, since it had lain fallow for<br/>four years, but got diverted by other projects and<br/>left it at that point.</p><p>At some point around 1988 I entered the notes from<br/>my score into a MIDI-file, and tinkered with it<br/>from time to time over the next 5 or so years.</p><p>In December 1994, shortly after my second wedding<br/>anniversary, I was working on the MIDI-file and decided<br/>to complete the piece once and for all.  I was amazed<br/>at how well I could remember what I heard in my head<br/>18 years before as I entered notes directly into<br/>the staff on my computer.  I was also inspired to<br/>add a few new touches, the best of which are the<br/>surprise slow bit at the very end of the 1st movement,<br/>and the Coda of the 2nd movement, which I think is<br/>one of the most poetic things I&apos;ve ever written.</p><p>I still felt that the final Coda of the 3rd movment<br/>needed something more, and finally, in October 2000,<br/>I was inspired to add some counterpoint to what<br/>was already there, and was more than pleased with<br/>the result.</p><p>All this music had been done in the standard 12-EDO tuning.<br/>In May 2001 I sent the MIDI-file to John deLaubenfels<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a>&gt;, and asked him to retune it<br/>in 5-limit and 7-limit adaptive JI, with stiff vertical<br/>springs (meaning that melodic &quot;evening out&quot; would be<br/>sacrificed in order to achieve JI vertical sonorities).<br/>I really liked the 7-limit version, and made the mp3<br/>which is available for listening at<br/>&lt;<a href="/makemicromusic/files/monz/SYM2cr7.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/monz/SYM2cr7.mp3</a>&gt;.</p><p>The symphony is very terse, the entire Exposition<br/>of the 1st movement being wrapped up in 24 seconds,<br/>and the &quot;A&quot; section of the 3rd movement about the<br/>same.</p><p>Because of this brevity, I made more than the usual<br/>repeats, as can be seen in the above formal analysis.<br/>Upon listening today, I&apos;d probably delete several<br/>of those in the 2nd movement.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
