One thing that occurred to me is that it has two chains<br/>of fifths at 600 cents apart -- and, of course, a 600-cent tritone --<br/>although we&apos;d probably agree that it&apos;s rather distinct from a<br/>paultone (which I might guess is a category starting somewhere around<br/>707 cents, say 56-tET, as opposed to 686 cents, and also one that<br/>involves a regular diatonic<br/>tuning) &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>The main trick, not so surprisingly, is to choose or design a timbre<br/>where the fifths and fourths can sound like reasonably smooth or<br/>blending perfect consonances -- for my approach, of course, where<br/>these intervals are the goals of directed progressions.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I note that one of the first progressions I tried -- and<br/>please quote me on this if you would, because this is one aspect of<br/>my musicmaking where you&apos;ve been especially influential -- involves<br/>the 14-tET equivalent of 4:6:7:9. To write it using step numbers<br/>(maybe the notation of least astonishment), I mean this:</p><p>        16  17            21   22<br/>        11   9            16   14<br/>        8    9            13   14<br/>        0   -5      or    5    0</p><p>Curiously, I pleasantly find it a lot like a tuning such as 22. Given<br/>the way you&apos;ve made 4:6:7:9 one of my favorite sonorities -- I wrote<br/>about it specifically and had an example in an article I did in 1/1<br/>on my 17-tone just thirdtone system, JOT-17 -- I find it appropriate<br/>to make this my first technical observation about 14-tET.</p><p>Please let me invite you, if it seems appropriate, to post these<br/>comments on 14-tET to makemicromusic and/or the Tuning List. It looks<br/>like I might have some technical problems at Yahoo with access, but I<br/>would like to let people know that I&apos;m much enjoying this tuning.<br/>**********************************************************************</p></div>
