I&apos;m not a technophobe. I am now chest deep in<br/>&gt; &gt;state of the art gizmos, and loving it. But I didn&apos;t start here. I<br/>&gt; &gt;don&apos;t mean to say that the route your on is wrong, it is fine. But all<br/>&gt; &gt;this talk about electric this and that for learning JI is rubbish. The<br/>&gt; &gt;greatest thinkers EVER in JI never even used electricity to learn. Ears<br/>&gt; &gt;work in the dark.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I have to disagree.  Sure, acoustic instruments are the cat&apos;s<br/>&gt; meow, but twiddling electronic knobs is the best way to listen to<br/>&gt; various tunings precisely.  &quot;Rubbish&quot;?  Not in my book!  I can&apos;t claim<br/>&gt; to belong to the cadre of &quot;greatest thinkers ever&quot; (in JI or anything<br/>&gt; else), but I _can_ lay claim to having benefitted greatly from having<br/>&gt; tunable electronic synths under my hands.  If I can ever retrofit<br/>&gt; adaptive tuning to an acoustic piano, I&apos;ll be in heaven!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess I don&apos;t see why electronic and acoustic instruments should be<br/>&gt; pitted against each other, with one declared a &quot;winner&quot; by one camp,<br/>&gt; and a &quot;loser&quot; by the other.  I would rather encourage everyone to make<br/>&gt; use of all available instruments of every sort.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that ears work best in the dark.  Luckily it is perfectly<br/>&gt; possible, even easy, to listen to music, acoustic or electronic, in any<br/>&gt; lighting conditions one desires.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I&apos;ve<br/>never been so content with my musical endeavours. I would urge all of<br/>you in this present incarnation to build just one instrument and tune it<br/>up even if you only make a slit drum.</p><p>This is not easy though and indeed it took me a bit of a lifestyle<br/>change and physical relocation to access the necessary resources. I also<br/>agree that we all get caught up in gear and money. Do we blame the<br/>capitalists for that or just our own acquisitive minds?

I<br/>believe it&apos;s worth some time and effort to have this if you&apos;re serious,<br/>particularly with composition. Using the technology as a means to an end<br/>or as an end in itself or somewhere on a sliding scale between the two<br/>is an artistic choice.</p><p>But when St. Peter at the Pearly Gates asks me what I did good I can&apos;t<br/>see myself banging on about resonant filters.
