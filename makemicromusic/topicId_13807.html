The fifth size is (56/11)^(1/4), so that four fifth give a<br/>pure 14/11. This suits Medieval music quite well, as Margo Schulter is quite<br/>keen in observing.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=13808 href="#13808">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2006 2:54:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The tuning is a 12-note linear temperament related to Peppermint<br/>very closely,<br/>&gt; but not quite.

The English, as you say, seem to have gotten into the<br/>5-limit game rather early. I meant something which treats the thirds<br/>and sixths as dissonances, but in which they are prominant.</p></div>
