It&apos;s scored for ob., cl., bn., pno.,<br/>perc., vln., vc... that&apos;s the instrumentation of his group.</p><p>He performed the piece in 1997 in Moldova and in Bacau, Romania.  Two<br/>years later, it was featured and reviewed in Bucharest, on Danceanu&apos;s<br/>own festival.  That same year, it was also performed in Peru, or so<br/>says ASCAP.  Perhaps it was by Danceanu on tour again, dunno.</p><p>In any case, because of economic restrictions in Romania which are<br/>rather severe, I gather, the piece was never recorded.  I felt bad<br/>about this, but I feel bad about a lot of things, do no different.</p><p>In any case, I was very happy to realize that with Sibelius I can now<br/>pretty easily make a nice MIDI (if MIDI is nice, actually it &quot;sucks&quot;)<br/>recording of my work (GM particularly is onerous).</p><p>In any case, it&apos;s better than nothing, so I thought I should<br/>immediately deliver it to you for your listening &quot;pleasure.&quot;</p><p>You will note that there *is* substantial microtonality in this<br/>piece, but mostly in the quartertone department.  Sibelius does a<br/>pretty good job of those.</p><p>I have also included a PDF of the score, which really is MANDATORY,<br/>given the nature of MIDI.  I tried to use as many &quot;authentic&quot; MIDI<br/>percussion instruments (using MIDI commands) as I could, but I&apos;m<br/>missing some.</p><p>In particular, the very end of the piece uses pots and pans that the<br/>percussionist whams and whacks and it might be the reason that the<br/>piece was presented *last* on many programs.  What would follow?<br/>What *could* follow?  And, *who* would want to follow THAT!</p><p>In any case, the MIDI file is here, the PDF is here, and people might<br/>have some fun with this piece.</p><p>It&apos;s in *my* directory in the &quot;files&quot; section of this forum:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Pehrson/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Pehrson/</a></p><p>It&apos;s possible, of course, to listen to the MIDI and *ALSO* follow the<br/>PDF file if you have *two* browser windows open.  One has to scroll<br/>along quickly to keep the PDF &quot;up to speed&quot; but I recommend using the<br/>little &quot;next page&quot; arrow at the bottom, rather than trying to scroll<br/>through the graphics.  That worked for me.</p><p>In any case, &quot;enjoy!&quot;</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=2699 href="#2699">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2002 4:36:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_unknown.html#2689">/makemicromusic/topicId_unknown.html#2689</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; In 1997, I wrote an ensemble for Liviu Danceanu&apos;s Romanian<br/>&gt; &gt; based, &quot;Archaeus&quot; ensemble.

Thanks for listening.  Actually some of<br/>this was partially a test of Sibelius for me, since I&apos;ve<br/>never &quot;delivered&quot; music in this way before.  In the first place,<br/>although this piece was played 3 times in Eastern Europe, I *never*<br/>got a recording (nor *will* I, most probably) so, naturally I was<br/>excited about the MIDI realization possible in Sibelius which is<br/>pretty sophisticated.  *Then* combining that with the possibility of<br/>saving the *score* as a PDF, really makes a different *distribution*<br/>world possible.  So it was, obviously, a test for this method of<br/>distributing music as well (I&apos;d never done it like this before).</p><p>Thanks again for listening!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
