What makes one<br/>tune distinct from another?  I know this sounds like a rather<br/>pedantic question, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as simple as it seems.  The<br/>more I think about it, the more undefinable it becomes.<br/>Historically, changing one note has been enough to get out of a<br/>lawsuit...you&apos;d think then that since a microtonal &quot;translation&quot; of a<br/>12-tET song could be said to have *completely* different notes<br/>entirely.  Could it have something to do with the overall pattern as<br/>a whole, the particular arrangement of small and large steps relative<br/>to each other?  But then that seems a little too broad, especially in<br/>the context of microtonal music.  Analogize it to lyrics: if you sing<br/>a song in japanese that was originally written in english, does the<br/>original author have the right to sue you?  I mean, the words are<br/>different, the meaning is different, the rhythm of the words will be<br/>different...and yet somehow, it&apos;s the same song.  Or is it?  If the<br/>Japanese singer denies that his lyrics are just a translation of an<br/>english song, how can he be disproved?  Likewise, if I recorded a 12-<br/>tET song in 22-tET and then claimed it as my own original idea, how<br/>could I be disproved?  Not that I&apos;d ever do such a thing, I&apos;d much<br/>rather write something that really *is* new, but this question has<br/>really got me vexed.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Igliashon Jones wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ha, I figure you&apos;re right about the legality, but I was thinkin&apos;<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; different kind of &quot;surf&quot; music.
