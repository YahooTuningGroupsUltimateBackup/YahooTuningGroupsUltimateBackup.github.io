Yes.<br/>&gt;Do I have faith these days in operating systems and software design. Not<br/>when it has to work every time, all the time!</p><p>Certainly understood... With minimal configuration (IE only the audio programs necessary for the performance set up) a PC rig should work. Um... I haven&apos;t put my foot out and done this myself yet though; I plan to in the future...</p><p>I will never forget the time when I hosted a guest techno producer (DDR). He was working it live and the music stopped.. I was only 10&apos; away and my jaw dropped when he gave a couple of stiff jabs to his Akai S3000; everything kicked back in...</p><p>That would be a site at an orchestral concert...  We were shocked enough as it was in the club... ;)</p><p>&gt;If you ca find an Ensinq ASR-X or and ASR 10 I would go for that.</p><p>Probably not a bad one to look into for a hardware sampler.<br/>It supports granular synthesis effects plus some other cool ones via plugins available below:<br/><a href="http://www.waveboy.com/">http://www.waveboy.com/</a></p><p>I have mastered some tracks for a German fellow who has one and it sounds nice. Much more flexible than the Akai for onboard effects.  Here is the final recording from this fellow... This is his 5 track EP. There are some nice microtonal sounding timbres here.. He might have used the tuning capability, but I&apos;m not sure: <a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/whole_cd.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/whole_cd.mp3</a><br/>He used the ASR-10 and a hardware sequencer (has some synth part to it here) and recorded 44/16 to the computer...  I think you would like these tracks Jacky...</p><p>&gt;No softare sampler will give you the polyphony of a hardware sampler and no hardware sampler will give you as much sound design flexibility as a software sampler.</p><p>From NI website:<br/>&quot;KONTAKT&apos;s advanced design and dynamic resource allocation ensure that its audio engine is always running at optimal efficiency, for up to 256 stereo voices per instance on a standard computer.&quot;</p><p>The Akai S5000/6000 has 64 voice polyphony and can be upgraded to 128 with a $500 expansion board. Kontakt has 256 _per instance_ with the number of instances limited only by total CPU/RAM.</p><p>** Maybe I should apply for a sales rep position; it wouldn&apos;t be a bad idea to place someone within arms reach at NI; the sales staff does influence implemented functionality right? &quot;Look at this petition... 5000 people signed it demanding unified and extensive microtonal support across all products... Weird!&quot; ** ;P</p><p>&gt;Did anyone else hear any crackly sounds that sounded like they<br/>should not be there?</p><p>Yes.  Probably a mix fix.. Keep it coming... the mix is a little dry and the part that comes in at 1:34 is jarring like a bunch Goblins.</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
