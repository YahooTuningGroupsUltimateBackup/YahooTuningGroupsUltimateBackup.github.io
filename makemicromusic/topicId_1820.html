Interesting enough  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/trans22.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/trans22.PDF</a><br/>&gt; on page 10 shows  one way this scale could be expanded to 22 tones. Of course it would be<br/>&gt; interesting to see what david would come up with without him knowing about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think Rod Poole&apos;s 17 tone guitar has both of these 12 tone scales possibly, i can&apos;t<br/>&gt; remember off hand<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am sure erv did not know about David&apos;s scale even though he developed a whole series of<br/>&gt; designs called HelixSongs which had two harmonic series a fifth apart but always identical<br/>&gt; i believe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One more related approach is the scale marked 12 in the middle on page 3 of<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF</a><br/>&gt; which i thought i would mention as a different way of drawing upon two harmonic series a<br/>&gt; fifth apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      The whole 3/2 apart thing as i have mentioned before could be applied to the diamond.<br/>&gt; two diamonds a 3/2 apart. Interestingly and with synchronicity I was thinking about a<br/>&gt; diamond with 1-(3 or 9)-5-7-11-13 with a 1-3-5-7-9-11 a 3/2 above<br/>&gt;  which really reflects David&apos;s spirit here. now I&apos;ll really have to map it out!<br/>&gt;</p></div>
