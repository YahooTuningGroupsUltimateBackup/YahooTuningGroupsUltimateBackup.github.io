Certain sections have a sense of continuity that<br/>&gt;seem almost like a horizon-like beach.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah, I was thinking of &quot;graininess&quot; I suppose.</p><p>Also, all of the musique-concrete sounds are taken from this one little<br/>fishing town in MA.   It&apos;s near a great beach, and so. . . .you get the<br/>idea.  Plus certain of the textures I originally thought of denoting<br/>beach-like vistas and so on, though I&apos;m not sure they ended up sounding<br/>like that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My wife and I both listened to this work (a bottle of wine can also<br/>&gt; add to the experience -- one is adequate)<br/>&gt;</p><p>ha!. . .  OK, admit it, you were stoned as well. . .   :)</p><p>&gt; and enjoyed it<br/>&gt;tremendously. She mentioned what she considered the &quot;random&quot; nature<br/>&gt;of it, and not in a deprecating way...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, it is in the sense described in Chapter II of the paper, in the sense<br/>of &quot;fragmentation of the familiar&quot; -- cutting up and twisting around<br/>familiar things into random sequences.   I like that experience as a<br/>listener.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) Is it true that Chris goes to elaborate lengths in order<br/>&gt;to &quot;achieve&quot; randomness? That seems a bit curious, although I am not<br/>&gt;opposed to it...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, in a way it is.  And it actually IS hard to achieve randomness.</p><p>Or, I should say, it IS hard to make a sequence of events that will make<br/>someone say &quot;Wow, that&apos;s totally random!!&quot;  In this case I&apos;m using<br/>&quot;random&quot; as an aesthetic term, rather than a scientific one, and I think<br/>I mean by it, let&apos;s say we have two objects in a sequence, A and B.<br/>Aesthetic &quot;randomness&quot; as I&apos;m discussing it would make an observer exclaim<br/>(or feel):  &quot;Wow,  object B, is the LAST thing I would think of<br/>putting after that object A.&quot;  ---  and one feels a kind of &quot;shock&quot; of<br/>aesthetic &quot;power&quot; coming from this juxtaposition.</p><p>It is, as you might imagine,  hard to sustain this kind of power through a<br/>long sequence of such juxtapositions. . . and in fact, when one does do<br/>this (or try to do it), one ends up with the kind of &quot;flat surface&quot; I was<br/>talking about in Chapter I.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;2) Certain sections *seemed* to have a compositional continuity. Is<br/>&gt;that intentional, or did it just work out that way?? Personally, I<br/>&gt;feel that adds to the piece, but since my *own* pieces tend to<br/>&gt;operate along those lines, it&apos;s not surprising I would feel that<br/>&gt;way... I, personally, like some of the *continuous* sections, maybe<br/>&gt;about in the *third* section...<br/>&gt;</p><p>You mean in Part III?  I would hope the whole thing would be continuous,<br/>once one accepts a sort of norm of discontinuity (in the sense of events<br/>constantly &quot;interrupting&quot; one another.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Great job, and lots of fun. It&apos;s also interesting to think about how<br/>&gt;this thing was assembled, although I must admit I only understand a<br/>&gt;part of that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Nice the entire thing is up on a website, too for &quot;easy access...&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, thanks for listening/reading!</p><p>cb</p></div><h3><a id=4201 href="#4201">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2003 3:51:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_4200.html#4200">/makemicromusic/topicId_4200.html#4200</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;2) Certain sections *seemed* to have a compositional continuity.

Those are the parts that remind me of<br/>the horizon on the beach.  Maybe some of those are just one *very<br/>long* sample, dunno.  Anyway, they seemed to change and have<br/>more &quot;contextual propulsion,&quot; but perhaps that was an illusion due to<br/>the length of the sample or some such.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, thanks for listening/reading!<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, *I* certainly found it entertaining.  I imagine others will<br/>as well.  I don&apos;t find it tedious at all... maybe if it went on<br/>another *hour* it would be... :)</p><p>best,</p><p>JP</p></div>
