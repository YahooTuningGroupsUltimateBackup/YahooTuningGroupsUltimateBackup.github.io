Does anyone have experience setting it up for alternate tunings?  Can you describe how to retune it from 12ET?  I would presume that with a MIDI keyboard, you would be best off using 12 notes per octave; but how would you define different tunings?</p><p>Thanks for your support.</p><p>Howard Cornell</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
