So I decided to upload the pieces onto <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> a<br/>few years ago to store the pieces in a place I thought would be safe<br/>(so much for that theory) and where somebody could hear them if they<br/>were interested in such things.<br/>      To be honest, the reason I decided to try 14 tone equal<br/>temperament was by a miscalculation of mine.  Originally I wanted to<br/>include perfect fifths in my pieces by spliting the interval into<br/>eight instead of seven equal parts.  Later I saw that this caused the<br/>octave to be out of tune, but instead of totally giving up on the<br/>idea (which maybe I should have at the time) I went with what I<br/>thought was a viable alternative.<br/>      Perhaps I am showing my ignorance regarding the pros and cons<br/>of the various micotonal equal temperaments (or maybe my ears are<br/>simply not screwed on right) but while I was composing these pieces I<br/>did not get a sense that the tuning was dissonant and that it should<br/>therefore be abandoned.  I simply went for it.  I took the tools I<br/>had to work with and did the best that my ears told me I could with<br/>that temperament.  I appreciate any dialogue (either good or bad)<br/>that these pieces might generate; for me any dialogue is better that<br/>having my pieces stay on that cassete tape collecting dust.</p></div><h3><a id=6225 href="#6225">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2004 10:19:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;terriandralph&quot;<br/>&lt;terriandralph@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;       These pieces were composed about 20 years ago but for many<br/>&gt; years they sat on a cassette tape without anyone listening to them<br/>&gt; (some people might argue that&apos;s where they should have stayed!)</p><p>Not me; I&apos;m all for expanding the available store of microtonal<br/>music.

It complicates things, but in fact, writing in a tuning<br/>without octaves is quite doable.  In fact, some people favor nonoctave<br/>tunings.  (see <a href="http://www.nonoctave.com">http://www.nonoctave.com</a>)</p><p>&gt;       Perhaps I am showing my ignorance regarding the pros and cons<br/>&gt; of the various micotonal equal temperaments (or maybe my ears are<br/>&gt; simply not screwed on right) but while I was composing these pieces I<br/>&gt; did not get a sense that the tuning was dissonant and that it should<br/>&gt; therefore be abandoned.  I simply went for it.  I took the tools I<br/>&gt; had to work with and did the best that my ears told me I could with<br/>&gt; that temperament.</p><p>Personally, I think that&apos;s awesome.  The music you came up with is sincere<br/>and organic.  In my opinion, if the tuning doesn&apos;t represent some idyllic<br/>relationship with JI, who cares?  It is a unique tuning, and you embraced it<br/>with sincerity.  No apology necessary!</p><p>-Andrew</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
