By simultaneity I simply mean the simultaneous sounding of<br/>unrelated events,a technique used to great success by Ives,<br/>Brant,Ornette, Braxton and many, many others. But what I was trying<br/>to achieve with these pieces--there are three of them, I tried a mid<br/>tempo, a ballad and a blues--was a sense of unity with a minimum of<br/>clashing, and, for me, a new way to hear things working together in<br/>a &quot;jazz&quot; context. As far as the particulars go,it&apos;s a collage using<br/>two completely different recordings in four passes. The two<br/>recordings were only a few seconds off in total running time,and<br/>knowing them both I could hear, in a rough and brute force way,that<br/>they would work together. The idea of the four passes,two for each<br/>record, was to make the composite massively microtonal, so I let the<br/>turntables run and &quot;played&quot; the pitch knob on the recorder exactly<br/>as you would an instrument. But the real thing I was after with<br/>these experiments,and out of a dozen carefully planned attempts only<br/>three really worked to my liking, was a different way to hear<br/>TIME...to listen to the phrasing as whole completely independent<br/>parts run concurrently and coalesce into a single piece of music.<br/>These kinds of exercises are the types of things I like to do to<br/>both stretch my ears as a soloist and as a composer. It&apos;s one thing<br/>to have the idea,but I find that when I take the time to make little<br/>working models it&apos;s much more instructive when it comes time to<br/>actually implement the ideas or concepts.</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>mid-tempo<br/>ballad</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m *way* behind on my listening, but I did want to say I<br/>listened<br/>&gt; recently to Dan Stearns&apos; &quot;No More Next Time&quot;.
