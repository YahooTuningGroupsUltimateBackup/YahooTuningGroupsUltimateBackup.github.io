For instance, I like to use tools like this, not for the bulk of what I do, or for even a big part of it, but sometimes just for some variety. My favorite way of generating some algorithmic building materials is KeyKit:</p><p><a href="http://nosuch.com/keykit/">http://nosuch.com/keykit/</a></p><p>Some of the tools are good for working up variations on single lines or background textures, and the nice thing is that it is a language-driven tool, meaning I can write new modules to do what I want. Not to mention it is fun to play with. While all it does is drive midi data, with a tool like MidiOX you can run the output to any of your microtonal synths to hear the stuff the way you want it.</p><p>Bottom line is that the composition tools available to us are just that: tools. And even if one of them could really poop out a piece that was probably going to fool some people completely (and P. T. Barnum made a fortune banking on this basic premise), where&apos;s the fun in that? Frankly, I compose because I enjoy it!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
