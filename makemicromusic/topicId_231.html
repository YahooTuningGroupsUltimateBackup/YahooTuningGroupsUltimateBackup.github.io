Why?  Well, music being what<br/>it is, there are common turns of phrase, so you don&apos;t want to limit things<br/>too tightly, or people would start suing over 2 or 3 note phrases.

You can make a satire something without being accused of legal<br/>infringement.  That, for example, is why someone like Yankovic can do what he<br/>does.
