But it hasn&apos;t really caught on -- most folks<br/>&gt; &gt; still prefer cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I originally looking for something like that.  (But then<br/>&gt; again, I revise my question in why we adhere to 1200 cents.<br/>&gt; There are other things besides cents to use after all,<br/>&gt; depending on context and audience group.)</p><p>In case you haven&apos;t noticed, something like 99% (or more)<br/>of the musical world is locked into 12-edo thinking.<br/>We microtonalists, since we now have internet forums<br/>in which we associate on a daily basis, tend to forget<br/>that sometimes.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2007 1:14:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Austin Butts wrote:</p><p>&gt; Long story short, I need a clear cut definition and explanation for<br/>&gt; &quot;octave&quot; and &quot;2:1&quot;, if they are in any way related and, if so, how? &gt; Disassociation between octave and period across the board would also<br/>&gt; be much appreciated if it is deemed proper to do so.</p><p>A period isn&apos;t necessarily an octave, although it frequently is. It can be a fraction of an octave, or some other interval not connected with an octave (you can have a tetrachord-based scale that repeats at the interval of a fifth, for instance). Some of my favorite temperaments have two periods to the octave, where a period is in the approximate range of 600 cents.</p><p>Opinions are divided on whether an &quot;octave&quot; always has to be an exact 2:1 interval. My preference is to use &quot;octave&quot; for either an exact 2:1 or its tempered equivalent. Certainly in the case of piano tuning, the interval between notes that have the same name is still referred to as an &quot;octave&quot; even though pianos are tuned with octaves stretched wider than 1200.0 cents.</p><p>But in the case of &quot;EDO&quot;, I believe it was generally accepted that the &quot;octave&quot; being divided equally is defined as 1200.0 cents. (One reason I don&apos;t often use the term is that I don&apos;t want to limit octaves to only being 1200.0 cents; another is that in my own usage, I&apos;m always thinking of the tuning as some form of temperament, even if it isn&apos;t always a consistent one, so the older usage &quot;ET&quot; is more applicable to my tonal approach to using these tunings.)</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2007 5:20:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Some other microtonalists have devised tunings which are<br/>&gt; equal divisions of other interval-ratios ... i remember<br/>&gt; that Jeff Smith composed a piece in something like 10-ed(5/3).<br/>&gt; (Sorry i can&apos;t remember exactly what it was, and i&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; googling but can&apos;t find Jeff&apos;s webpage.)</p><p>I just found it:</p><p><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/tunes/jigsaw.html">http://www.nonoctave.com/tunes/jigsaw.html</a></p><p>On his album &quot;5-dimensional jigsaw puzzle&quot;, Jeff Smith<br/>used 14ed(12/7) for several pieces, and 13ed(7/5) for one.</p><p>Now this points up something else: using &quot;ed&quot; to describe<br/>a tuning like this, it&apos;s almost the same as writing the<br/>actual mathematical description -- so 14ed(12/7) is<br/>(12/7)^(1/14), etc.</p><p>BTW, note that Jeff&apos;s 14ed(12/7) tuning is almost exactly<br/>the same as 18-edo.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2007 5:25:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, the thing i had forgotten to mention before was<br/>&gt; that some tuning theorists like to use &quot;millioctaves&quot;<br/>&gt; instead of cents, precisely because it focuses on a<br/>&gt; decimal division of the 2:1 ratio and avoids any reference<br/>&gt; to 12-edo.
