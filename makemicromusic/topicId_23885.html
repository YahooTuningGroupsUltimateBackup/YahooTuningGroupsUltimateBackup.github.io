It runs 12 weeks, from February 2 to May 7.  We&apos;ve got an<br/>interesting crew of composers assembled, and are looking for a few more.</p><p>Tuition is $1500 for 12 weeks of intensive microtonal work in good company.<br/>Scholarships and work study are available.  Money should not be a barrier to<br/>participation, so if this sounds like something you can&apos;t miss, let&apos;s talk!</p><p>Excitedly,<br/>Andrew Heathwaite, gtrpkt@...</p><p>The Short Description:  &quot;In this society, the available means for music-making<br/>are a product of the ruling musical system. To imagine anything different would<br/>be to invite the (im)possible tasks of designing new instruments, new<br/>orchestras, new human capacities, new concert formats. Microtonal design is a<br/>seminar for unsticking the ear and everything attached to it.&quot;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
