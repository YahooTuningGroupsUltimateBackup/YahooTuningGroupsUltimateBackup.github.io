I&apos;ve only heard The People United,<br/>but I was fairly impressed.</p><p>Another composer friend of mine, who happened to be the<br/>one who loaned me the Rzewski disc, thought Berio was<br/>the greatest living composer.  But I could never get into<br/>his stuff.  And I just looked him up, and he passed away<br/>in 2003.</p><p>It would be easy if Nancarrow were still with us (he<br/>passed away in 1997).</p><p>Elliot Carter is 98 years old.  Norman Henry might nominate<br/>him.  I prefer him to Berio I think, but still can&apos;t get<br/>onboard 100%.</p><p>Witold Lutoslawski died in 1994.</p><p>Somebody on the web thinks either Einojuhani Rautavaara or<br/>Per Norgard.</p><p>Maybe Easley Blackwood deserves mention.  A student of<br/>Messien, he was.  And his string quartets are good.</p><p>I would never have thought of Part in this context, until<br/>Kurt Bigler played a piece of his for me on his organ.<br/>Maybe it was just the mood I was in that day, but, wow.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 12:51 PM 4/25/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Fredric Rzewski<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MixrSzIa264">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MixrSzIa264</a><br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MixrSzIa264">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MixrSzIa264</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Everything was going just fine until the glass player<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whips out an ET tuner!
