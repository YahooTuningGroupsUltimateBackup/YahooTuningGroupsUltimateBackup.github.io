If the softsynth is going to be around<br/>for several years, then during all that time with this<br/>extra feature you will continue to get so many extra<br/>people buying it every year.</p><p>It is an area where a minority of people wanting something can<br/>make it well worth while if it means some buy the software<br/>as a result. For everyone else, it means you have one more<br/>thing in the list of features for them to play about with,<br/>and as long as it doesn&apos;t clutter the interface too much,<br/>then they aren&apos;t going to complain and will probably be<br/>well pleased too.</p><p>Then of course, you never know, it could be the next<br/>must have feature, and it can&apos;t be a bad thing to be<br/>one of the first in with a softsynth with that feature<br/>if that&apos;s what happens.</p><p>BTW at some point I plan to add an option to fts<br/>to auto-retune sound samples by changing the sample rate<br/>to hopefully help with the matter of voices for wave table<br/>synths being tuned only to within 1 to 3 cents.<br/>I don&apos;t know if it will work, but the wave count method<br/>is pretty accurate for short clips, also the<br/>harmonic series method, depending on the timbre.</p><p>Idea is you&apos;d export all the sound samples, retune<br/>them by just changing the sample rate at the head<br/>of the file, which will leave all the loop points<br/>unchanged, and then import them all again.</p><p>You&apos;d specify the desired pitch for the sample<br/>using the file name, which is the way many of<br/>them are done anyway.</p><p>Anyone see any flaw in the idea?</p><p>Not prob. for a little while though if I do it as<br/>I will be taking a break from coding FTS for a<br/>month or two to get my virtual flowers program<br/>on the go after this release (apart from<br/>any post release bug fixes and some work on the<br/>help, and noting down any ideas) -<br/>I&apos;ll prob. also be doing some microtonal<br/>composing enjoying using FTS and getting<br/>more of the perspective of a user of the program<br/>rather than the programmer, ready for when i<br/>go back to work on it again. :-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3149 href="#3149">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 8:54:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_unknown.html#3146">/makemicromusic/topicId_unknown.html#3146</a></p><p>&gt; The only thing I might suggest, is to save the original wave files<br/>&gt; before processing. Changing the sample rate, could introduce<br/>&gt; artifacts, and one might wish to get to restore the originals.<br/>Maybe<br/>&gt; this is a given alreay. But it is a good practice to work with a<br/>copy<br/>&gt; of wave file samples - just in case.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***This is actually something I learned rather recently.  When I<br/>started with all this stuff, I was quite happy to save sound files<br/>as .mp3s.  Frankly, they sounded fine to me, and I couldn&apos;t<br/>distinguish the difference between .wavs and .mp3&apos;s.</p><p>However, after *very* careful listening, finally, I *can* hear the<br/>difference between the .wav and .mp3.  It&apos;s like a little<br/>difference &quot;around the edges&quot; of the sound, in the nature of the way<br/>the reverb, etc. sounds.  But it *is* pretty subtle.</p><p>Anybody else have similar experiences??</p><p>TX</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=3150 href="#3150">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Millions of people, I imagine! The reality, and everyone needs to be aware of this, is that mp3 encoding is what as known as a &apos;lossy&apos; encoding, which means that one of the trade-offs in reducing the file size is a loss of information. All you need to do is encode a good sound file in progressively smaller codecs, i.e, 320k bitrate, 128, 44, etc. and you&apos;ll hear a degradation in the sound.</p><p>In EVERY instance of digital file manipulation, you must ALWAYS save a copy at the highest level of storage, and this includes sound, image, and video file information. One thing people learn, now that digital cameras are ubiquitous, is that if you save a .jpg picture again as a .jpg, and make changes, and save it again, etc., you are gradually reducing the quality each time, and depending on the chosen compression sometimes radically! If you *don&apos;t* save an original there is _no_way_ back to the pristine copy - you can&apos;t undo it once you&apos;ve saved the file.</p><p>Caveat emptor.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3152 href="#3152">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

We go to lots &gt;of effort to share our tunes, to have low birate mp3 encoding destroy the &gt;intended quality at the final stage. I&apos;ve noticed that Catharsis does all &gt;his stuff at 192 kbs, if memory serves.</p><p>I&apos;ve never imagined that music at the default, accepted &apos;online posting&apos; bitrate of 128 was representative of the ultimate sound quality of the original artifact. I tend to think of this encoding as a reasonable alternative, for people to get their ears wet and, if they like what they hear, to download a higher encoding or (heaven forbid) order a CD from the author/composer!</p><p>All these are trade-offs, in terms of storage space, download time, etc. When I upload at a lower bitrate, I am keeping in mind those that either pay dearly for online time, or simply aren&apos;t set up to effectively download very large files. If one can have a low bitrate sample, to get the juices flowing, and have another, more fully realized version somewhere else, we approach the ultimate in end-user experience.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3159 href="#3159">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 12:01:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

Quite often mp3 encoding is brutal on music which<br/>&gt; has allot of inharmonic timbres I&apos;ve noticed.</p><p>Does this depend on the encoder?  I&apos;ve had trouble before with noise being<br/>garbled, but Lame seems to handle that okay.</p><p>&gt; The work-around for this problem is to encode at higher birates than<br/>&gt; 128, and or use VBR (Variable Birate). VBR is so much better than the<br/>&gt; standard method, and the pieces I&apos;ve tried it out on I kept at 128<br/>&gt; kbs, and they sounded fanstastic in quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, using higher birates, or VBR will make the size of the files<br/>&gt; much larger, challenging those with dialup modems to get the pieces.</p><p>Why not use a lower minimum bitrate with VBR?</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
