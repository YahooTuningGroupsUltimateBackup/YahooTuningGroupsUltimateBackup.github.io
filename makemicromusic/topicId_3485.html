I remember we played down in a<br/>&gt; ditch next to a little brook that ran in back of us and under a bridge<br/>&gt; where I remember seeing a bunch of people when we were playing. The<br/>&gt; beer garden was up in back of that performance area on a hill behind<br/>&gt; the brook. I&apos;m pretty sure there was always two or three simultaneous<br/>&gt; performances.</p><p>I was probably at the Composer&apos;s series at a Church across<br/>the park, so I probably missed ya!</p><p>&gt; No microtones with that group (sorry), I think I was playing a black<br/>&gt; and red Steinberger... the drummer was a flamboyant type; a really<br/>&gt; tall guy who looked like a blonde Ted Nugent but could play any crazy,<br/>&gt; mangled rythem I asked.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t even remember if it was a good show or not... however, I do<br/>&gt; remember getting NO sleep the night before in some cheap NJ dive that<br/>&gt; was not ten feet from an all night truck stop!</p><p>Ah...road stories.</p><p>dB</p></div>
