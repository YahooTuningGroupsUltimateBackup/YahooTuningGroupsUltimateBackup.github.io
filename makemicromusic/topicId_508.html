These have never been heard before, and although the quality is<br/>not too good, they are interesting. I have posted one in my folder<br/>here, but I realize this may not be the forum for this material. If<br/>they are not appropriate for this group (and I know we have limited<br/>space), I will remove it. If you are interested, listen or download<br/>it. Unless I am informed that it is not a good idea, I will remove an<br/>old one and post a new one each day for a month. I have also started a<br/>site at <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> called Kami&apos;s African Expedition where I will leave<br/>these up permanently. Of course, this takes time these days, and the<br/>site probably will not appear for a couple of weeks.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=555 href="#555">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2001 5:19:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi All.
