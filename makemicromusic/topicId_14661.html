My problem<br/>is that once i choose a scale with more than 12 tones per octave i&apos;m<br/>only able to hear 12 of them in the Staff view. For instance, i choose<br/>15-TET, set the meter to 5/4 in Staff view (so i can easily hear all<br/>15 pitches, i.e. I should now have five different tones in three<br/>measures, right?)</p><p>I am able to hear 12 of the 15 tones per octave when i insert flat(b)<br/>and sharp(#)signs on a standard 12-TET scale (e.g. c-C, for instance.)<br/>I don&apos;t know if Cakewalk&apos;s staff view recognises double flat, or<br/>double sharp signs. Is there a workaround for this? My question is<br/>whether FTS can output from multiple midi synths on different channels<br/>at the same time? For example, can it output my soundcard&apos;s synth on<br/>ch.1 and my hardware synth on ch.2, at the same time?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p></div>
