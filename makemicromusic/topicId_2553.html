My piece was played last night, and was the only piece in an actual key. They like atonality down here quite alot.</p><p>I&apos;m writing to you from the basement of the student services building of USF. Since arriving here, I&apos;ve begun work on my first string quartet. It&apos;s mostly in three/ four time, but the last 40 measures or so I&apos;ve been doing something sneaky.</p><p>I have three bars of three, then a bar of four. This group of four bars repeats (the structure of bars, note the notes) many times. The musicians won&apos;t know it, but I&apos;m writing in 13/4. Sneaky.</p><p>Just thought I&apos;d share this with all of you xenometricians.</p><p>Say hi to everybody for me,<br/>Love george</p></div><h3><a id=2556 href="#2556">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2002 2:58:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/7/02 2:07 PM, &quot;ploo@...&quot; &lt;ploo@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have three bars of three, then a bar of four.
