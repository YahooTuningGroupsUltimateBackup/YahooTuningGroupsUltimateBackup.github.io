The next guitar I refret is going<br/>to be that. It&apos;s an amazingly beautiful tuning, and the frets are<br/>actually wider than 12-tet, so you aren&apos;t going to run into<br/>playability issues at high octaves. I mean tritaves.

Neil has done great work with<br/>his 34-tone axes, and Eduardo Sabat-Girabaldi (after whom giribaldi<br/>temperament is named) had a school of 53-tone guitarists in.

With the exception of its neutral intervals, it feels like just a kinda more &quot;rough&quot; 12-tone, i.e. major and minor chords sound less &quot;smooth&quot; and &quot;resolved&quot;.  Unless you like the neutral stuff or are okay getting repeatedly sucked back into diatonic patterns, I&apos;d recommend staying away from 17 on a guitar.</p><p>My strong, STRONG recommendation is to compare tunings by their scalar structures (MOS scales especially), NOT just their harmonic properties.  Compared to 17, 19 actually has more interesting alternative tonal structures, IMHO, even though it has a rep for being &quot;not very different from 12&quot;.  Take a minute to work out the various MOS scales (and their harmonic properties) in both 19 and 17 and I think you&apos;ll agree.  I particularly like 19&apos;s &quot;augmented second&quot;-based MOS at 9 notes, coming out to LsLsLsLsL...really xenharmonic, yet you still have 7 out of 9 triads with perfect fifths.  Gives you access to the &quot;third-tone&quot; quality of 19 as well.</p><p>I still think 23 gives the most xenharmonic bang for the buck, but the lack of a fifth really throws people off.  MOS-wise, though, it&apos;s LOADED with the &quot;xenest of the xen&quot;: the LLsLLsLs scale from 13 and 18 (Father?), the LsLsLsLsL scale from 14 and 19 (Beep?), the LLLsLLLLs scale from 16 (Mavila?), the LssLsLs scale from 10 and 17 (Beatles/Mohajira?)...not to mention Herman Miller&apos;s &quot;Superpelog&quot; scale.  And in fact most of its intervals are very near-Just, and can sound very smooth when approached with understanding (instead of trying to shoe-horn it into common-practice).  But hey, it&apos;s probably also not a good place to start your xenguitar journey, either.  Even I&apos;m still a bit intimidated by it.</p><p>Anyway...yeah, I&apos;d suggest 19 over 17, and maybe even over 22.  22 looks the best harmonically, but MOS/temperament-wise, it&apos;s somewhat poor.  Beyond Erlich&apos;s Pajara decatonics, Orwell, and Porcupine, it&apos;s not got much going for it in b&#x9;$10-note MOS scales.  I am telling you this because my biggest regret in all the time and money I&apos;ve put into microtonal guitars is that for the first several guitars I had made, I chose tunings based on harmonic properties instead of based on the alternative tonal structures they made possible.  Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m intimidated by chromaticism in general and prefer the rigidity of MOS scales, and maybe you&apos;re different.

Beyond<br/>&gt; Erlich&apos;s Pajara decatonics, Orwell, and Porcupine, it&apos;s not got much going<br/>&gt; for it in b&#x9;$10-note MOS scales. I am telling you this because my<br/>&gt; biggest regret in all the time and money I&apos;ve put into microtonal guitars is<br/>&gt; that for the first several guitars I had made, I chose tunings based on<br/>&gt; harmonic properties instead of based on the alternative tonal structures<br/>&gt; they made possible. Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m intimidated by chromaticism in<br/>&gt; general and prefer the rigidity of MOS scales, and maybe you&apos;re different.<br/>&gt; But this is what I&apos;ve experienced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;MakeMicroMusic%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;,<br/>&gt; Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I do want something that is xenharmonic &quot;forcing&quot; - so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; thinking  I&apos;d go to 22 actually instead of 19.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now this is the opinion of someone who hasn&apos;t had a real micro axe in<br/>&gt; &gt; my hands so that may all change.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I do think that beyond 22 may be too much for me to deal with - again<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know for a fact which is why I&apos;m going to experiment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My expectations is that real guitar will allow for more expression<br/>&gt; &gt; than my GR-20 - no matter how much I love that bird.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Chris<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Tue, Jun 8, 2010 at 8:28 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&apos;t forget 19 in the &apos;not too dramatic from 12&apos; dept.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 17 is great for melody, I find, but not that great for harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22616 href="#22616">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2010 10:00:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:08 PM 6/8/2010, you wrote:</p><p>&gt;Anyway...yeah, I&apos;d suggest 19 over 17, and maybe even over 22.  22<br/>&gt;looks the best harmonically, but MOS/temperament-wise, it&apos;s somewhat<br/>&gt;poor.

I thought MOS scales were a pretty entry-level concept, but maybe you entered by a different door than I did.  I&apos;d be happy to clarify, if you&apos;re curious.  It&apos;s simple theory that I can explain in probably less than a paragraph.  Unless you&apos;re perfectly familiar with MOS scales and it was that ascii mess that threw you off, the random characters that displayed when I tried to type in a &quot;less than or equal to&quot; symbol.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the best thing to do is continue my tuning survey - which of course<br/>&gt; dovetails into this purchase.</p><p>Definitely.  But it might help you to delve a little into the theory behind the scales you explore to get a better understanding of how they relate to each other and to various EDOs.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=22618 href="#22618">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2010 1:57:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 9 June 2010 04:27, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gotcha. &nbsp;Without dissing the wire idea, which could produce fine<br/>&gt; results I&apos;m sure, you might consider doing a regular refret yourself.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not all that hard. &nbsp;I&apos;ve posted John Starrett&apos;s howto in the<br/>&gt; files section:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/carl/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/carl/</a></p><p>It may not be that hard if you have the right tools and know what<br/>you&apos;re doing.

The only tool you need is a<br/>penknife, for cutting it, and pulling the old frets out.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>work very well, but that&apos;s life.  I&apos;m sure thicker line would be<br/>better.  (80lbs, which would be 40kg, doesn&apos;t sound that much.  But I<br/>don&apos;t remember what I had.)  Also a more even surface to the<br/>fretboard.  As the guitar in question&apos;s more expensive than the one I<br/>played with maybe it&apos;s worth doing a better job, but the fishing<br/>line&apos;s still great for trying out frettings.</p><p>About these curved fretboards: when I refretted my strat copy I had to<br/>put the frets in flat.  I was using a coping saw instead of a proper<br/>fretsaw, which may have been the problem.  But the slots were too wide<br/>and so the frets didn&apos;t bend.  The result is still a lot better than<br/>the cheap guitar with fishing line.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div>
