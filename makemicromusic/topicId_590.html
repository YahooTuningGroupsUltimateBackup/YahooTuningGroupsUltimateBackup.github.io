I love the way it<br/>&gt; flows. What kind of dance performance was given with it?</p><p>Thanks for the nice comments. As I mentioned, this is just one short<br/>section of a 12:20 piece for choreographer Patricia Sandback and<br/>company. Pat and I collaborated on a number of dances, in differing<br/>ways. More often then not, she got an entire vocabulary of moves and<br/>sections of pieces, done to set counts and tempos. I would be faced<br/>with the task of &quot;here is what it looks like, and this is the mood;<br/>I&apos;ve got 43 measures of 5/4, and then a faster tempo in 3, and then<br/>about 2 minutes of 7 count bars...&quot;</p><p>Yes, it could be a real chanllenge. Sometimes she just worked with a<br/>metronome, so I had to come up with suitable music AT a particular<br/>tempo. And the dancers complained when it varied!</p><p>I&apos;ll find a way to put the entire thing up, somewhere, but until then<br/>I may find some other sections of pieces from these eras that might<br/>be of interest. Meanwhile, I have to try and revamp a dance piece I<br/>did for a commission earlier this year, and it isn&apos;t going to be easy!</p><p>&gt; I also don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever publicly told you what an incredible<br/>&gt; job you have done with the Partch web site.  It is just gorgeous by<br/>&gt; all design standards.</p><p>Off topic! Off topic! You are banished!!!     (just kidding)</p><p>Well, thanks again for the nice comments, especially in view of the<br/>fact it is WAY overdue for new material and an updating. Time, I must<br/>find time...</p><p>&gt; And thank you for keeping this list gently focused.</p><p>Easy to do when dealing with well-behaved adults! I just think people<br/>have found a bit of a haven, which *does* make me smile. Hope you&apos;ll<br/>be around more often, too!</p><p>Long night, must retire,<br/>Jon</p></div>
