And as<br/>&gt;I&apos;m always out in the woods wherever I go, it didn&apos;t take long for me<br/>&gt;to realize why--one spring day my first year here I sat down under a<br/>&gt;few trees on a hike for less than ten minutes only to find at least<br/>&gt;five tiny deer ticks crawling on my pant leg. Needless to say I was<br/>&gt;quite paranoid thereafter, and figured it was only a matter of time as<br/>&gt;these ticks were so small compared to the wood (or dog) ticks I&apos;d<br/>&gt;grown up knowing off-Cape.</p><p>Those ticks are the antichrist.

As a teenager my drive to go into the woods overwhelmed<br/>anything else, and I had lots of fun counting how many I&apos;d picked up<br/>after each trek.  I once saved some deer ticks in an airtight glass<br/>vial in my fridge, and they happily started crawling away when I<br/>opened it about a year later.  They&apos;re almost invisible to the naked<br/>eye unless under bright light.  When I moved to California, I rejoiced<br/>to find that ticks are far less common here.  The openness (lack of<br/>low-lying brush) and/or dryness of the forest means you can take many<br/>treks and never pick up a single tick.</p><p>&gt;Problem is I never got a telltale rash or any of the arthritic-like<br/>&gt;ailments commonly associated with Lyme, at least not since I&apos;d been on<br/>&gt;the Cape.</p><p>Lyme is sometimes completely asymptomatic at infection.</p><p>&gt;Was it possible that I&apos;d had Lyme disease for at least 15 years?</p><p>&apos;tis possible.</p><p>&gt;The specialist who prescribed the Tetracycline had warned me that it<br/>&gt;might pull the Lyme out, but I was totally unprepared for the possible<br/>&gt;severity of the symptoms.

I can only assume the effects are usually not so<br/>&gt;pronounced. For what it&apos;s worth, in Slovakia they do more extensive<br/>&gt;initial testing to try to either prove or disprove the presence of<br/>&gt;Lyme in the body, like lumbal punction and other more specialized<br/>&gt;blood tests that show more than the IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies.
