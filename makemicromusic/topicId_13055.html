I&apos;ve thought about putting down for one, good sampler, but before the support was there for microtuning I made an investment in another instrument that can, if needed, function for sampling use. I will eventually add K2 to the arsenal, I think, so I&apos;ll eventually find use for your script-o-mat. But it is great you&apos;ve added a nice tool for people to use.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;My main idea was to develop a vehicle to explore modulations between related<br/>&gt;sets of scales, hence the desire to load and programmatically switch between alternate tunings.</p><p>Excellent idea. The only way I can do that now is compose for different tunings and use parallel tracks with the same instruments in differing tunings, and just record on the appropriate track. See Point 3 below...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve been using EnergyXT (39 euros) as a sequencer/host for Kontakt...</p><p>And an excellent tool both as a host, and also to wrap multiple instances/instruments and load as one scene (I use it this was as a VST inside of Sonar)</p><p>&gt;... and its track freeze/unfreeze facility is so slick, you really only need one or two instruments active in Kontakt at any time if you have half a clue of what you want.</p><p>Point 3: &quot;Freeze&quot; is your friend! :) Life has really changed since the addition of freezing tracks in Sonar, and I know it has been available in other sequencer/DAW packages for a while as well. When the infinite RAM and transtellar CPU machine finally arrives, we won&apos;t need to freeze, but for now... it works.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
