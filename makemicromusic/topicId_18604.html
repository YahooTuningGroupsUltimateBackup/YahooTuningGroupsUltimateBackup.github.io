And since Mac OS-X is fundamentally<br/>BSD (which is also descended from Unix), it shouldn&apos;t be<br/>hard to port the Linux version over to Mac.</p><p>Meanwhile, i&apos;ve been exploring virtual operating systems<br/>a lot for the past 5 weeks. So as soon as i decide which<br/>flavor of Linux i want to install on my new laptop, the<br/>next project is to try installing Tonescape into a virtual<br/>Windows Vista running in VirtualBox under Linux, and see<br/>if it works.</p><p>If it does, then that would be the ideal way for Mac and<br/>Linux users to work with Tonescape, because they would<br/>have the complete Windows version with all the functionality.<br/>The only drawback is that to run Windows legally, they<br/>still have to buy a retail copy of it.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
