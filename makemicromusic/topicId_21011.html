It&apos;s a professional stage piano in<br/>the $5000 range.  Importantly, it&apos;s physically modeled (like<br/>pianoteq, and Roland&apos;s V- Accordians).  It also touts Roland&apos;s<br/>latest fake piano keyboard action, and some fancy &apos;fake ivory&apos;<br/>keytops.  I went to my local shop yesterday to audition it.</p><p>The shop had it running through some truly massive PA system<br/>right next to it, which sounded incomprehensible at such short<br/>distance (the massive sub was on my left, resulting in a really<br/>unbalanced sound, etc etc).  So take the following with a grain<br/>of salt: sound-wise, it was good, but no better (and perhaps<br/>even inferior to) pianoteq.  The presets include some neat fun,<br/>such as what would happen if you made strings out of silver,<br/>or had tripled unisons all the way down the keyboard, but<br/>nothing especially useful.  I spent most of my time between<br/>two concert grands.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that I don&apos;t like &apos;fake piano&apos;<br/>keyboard actions, and historically I&apos;ve liked Roland&apos;s least<br/>of all.  So again, take this with a grain of salt.  The action<br/>was better than I&apos;ve experienced on other Roland instruments,<br/>but still posed no threat to the fellow who&apos;s renting me the<br/>Yamaha U5 in my living room.  It was responsive and relatively<br/>quick, but trills reveal right away something rotten in Denmark,<br/>and after about 15 minutes a type of fatigue set in which is<br/>characteristic of these actions.</p><p>Also granted, that with time one&apos;s technique can possibly<br/>adapt to suit any action, including this one.  That said, these<br/>fake actions seem to me to go to contortions to replicate the<br/>surface features of a piano actions (escapement let off, etc),<br/>at the expense of being normal physical systems whose linear<br/>responses correlate to the sound being produced (which is what<br/>is truly important in piano actions, and all acoustic keyboard<br/>actions).</p><p>As for tuning features, it had the standard Roland front-panel<br/>affair, with a handful of 12-tone tunings like &quot;just major&quot;,<br/>&quot;just minor&quot;, &quot;pythagorean&quot;, &quot;meantone&quot;, and &quot;kirnberger&quot;,<br/>along with a key center setting.  I suspect the tuning<br/>implementation is the usual Roland one, restricted to 12 tones<br/>per octave, but have not verified this.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll put $4700 in the bank and stick with pianoteq<br/>and its excellent Scala-file support.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=21012 href="#21012">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2009 1:08:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It&apos;s regrettable that most manufacturers stick to 12-tones, and the standard<br/>temperaments, without at least offering a user scale.</p><p>I wonder what Yamaha&apos;s latest is in the way of digital pianos.
