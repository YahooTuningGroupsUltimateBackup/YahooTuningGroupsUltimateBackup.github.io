Mahler would have given up the<br/>orchestra to have his hand at the powers of these pitches. Some<br/>prominent bassoon players were likewise impressed by the use of the<br/>instrument in ways they had not seen.<br/>    If microtonality could solicit 10 more forces such as Johnny, the<br/>12et walls of jericho would surely fall.</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
