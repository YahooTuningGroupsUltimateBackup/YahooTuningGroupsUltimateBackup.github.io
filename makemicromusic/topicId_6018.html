For example, do you<br/>alternate<br/>&gt; semitones with quarter-tones? Do you give verbal information<br/>&gt; identifying interval sizes? Do you arrange the semitones, sixth-<br/>tones,<br/>&gt; etc., in scales? Do you present the intervals slowly enough to sing<br/>&gt; back with? repetitively? I&apos;m curious to find what people have tried<br/>&gt; and what might work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kyle</p><p>***Hi Kyle,</p><p>Well, I&apos;ll take this from the &quot;instructions&quot; for _Blackjack_, the<br/>cello/electronics piece:</p><p>The description begins telling the player how Blackjack is close to<br/>JI (up to the 11 limit, within 2 or 3 cents) and how it is,<br/>basically, easy to play because it uses 72-tET notation, i.e. our<br/>basic 12-equal pitches, PLUS, quartertones, 1/6th tones, and 1/12th<br/>tone alterations.</p><p>Then it shows the symbols I use (in this particular piece I am using<br/>the Ezra Sims, symbols... since then I have a modified form of George<br/>Secor&apos;s &quot;sagittal&quot; which seems even better)</p><p>1/6 tones being approximately 33 cents deviation high and low from<br/>the 12-equal pitches and</p><p>1/12th tones being approximately 16 cents up and down from the 12-<br/>equal pitches.</p><p>Since those are the only accidentals (besides quartertones) necessary<br/>in Blackjack, that&apos;s pretty simple..</p><p>On the first track of the accompanying CD I have &quot;Blackjack note<br/>practice.&quot;  Each example is repeated twice, and there is space<br/>between the examples.  They go as follows: (I also indicate TIMINGS<br/>on the CD so that a person knows *for sure* what pitch he/she is<br/>on!)  Essentially I just follow the 12-equal chromatic scale with<br/>this, including the deviations that are necessary for the Blackjack<br/>scale.  Each pitch is about 2 or 3 seconds in length.  These are the<br/>comparisions:</p><p>0:00 C natural</p><p>0:13 C#, C# 12th tone low</p><p>0:58 Db, Db 12th tone high</p><p>1:44 D natural, D 6th tone high</p><p>2:31 Eb, Eb 12th tone high</p><p>3:19 E natural, E quarter tone low</p><p>4:11 E natural, E 6th tone high</p><p>5:09 F natural, F 6th tone low</p><p>6:01 F natural, F quarter tone high</p><p>6:56 F#, F# 12th tone low</p><p>7:49 G natural, G 6th tone low</p><p>8:43 G#, G# 12th tone low</p><p>9:39 Ab, Ab 12th tone high</p><p>10:38 A natural, A 6th tone high</p><p>11:34 Bb, Bb 12th tone high</p><p>12:30 B natural, B quarter tone low</p><p>13:28 B natural, B 12th tone low</p><p>14:24 C natural, C 6th tone low</p><p>15:16 C natural (one octave about original...)</p><p>****</p><p>Then, TRACK 2 of the CD, is the 21-note blackjack scale through a one<br/>octave range, ascending and descending.  It is played twice...  I<br/>note that there are essentially only *two* different step sizes in<br/>Blackjack, one 83 cents (five 72-tET units) and the other 33 cents<br/>(two 72-tET units)</p><p>Then I show a graphic of the scale (that was a bitch to import in<br/>from Sibelius, but I hear they&apos;ve improved graphic import to Word by<br/>now... :)  with the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;L&quot; labels for the intervals indicated<br/>between the notes...</p><p>TRACK 3:  is the cello part ALONE.  I had been asked to have this<br/>kind of track from instrumentalists before, so they could practice<br/>their intonation only against the one line...</p><p>TRACK 4:  This is the piece WITH a MIDI realization of the cello<br/>part, for practice purposes only...</p><p>TRACK 5:  Finally, this is the track that will be performed in<br/>concert... the MIDI accompaniment *without* the cello part.  I put<br/>this last on the CD for obvious reasons:  that way there will be<br/>nothing after it in case the engineer messes up and forgets to turn<br/>the CD off... :)  (that&apos;s happened, of course)...</p><p>That&apos;s basically it, and I&apos;ve been using a similar procedure for all<br/>my solo Blackjack pieces... although it&apos;s been somewhat &quot;refined&quot; as<br/>I went along...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>kylegann1955 &#x3C;kgann@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2004 11:36:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Uh... thanks, Jon... mmmm... uh... what, uh, what&apos;s &quot;a flexible<br/>&gt; &gt; front-end&quot; exactly?
