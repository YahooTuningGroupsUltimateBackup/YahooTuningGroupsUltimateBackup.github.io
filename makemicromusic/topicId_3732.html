And I tell you that, in a large sampling of human beings,<br/>there are<br/>&gt; those that simply will never have a very good concept of a steady<br/>tempo,</p><p>i have to say you&apos;re probably right, but for any given individual,<br/>how can you presume to say never? my own personal experience<br/>contradicts that in the strongest of terms. so i prefer to give each<br/>musician a chance, and let the chips fall as they may.</p><p>&gt; and that solid rhythmic ability will escape them, in spite of much,<br/>much<br/>&gt; practice. That never stopped us from having a good time, but I<br/>never pulled<br/>&gt; the wool over my own eyes about their probability for being solid,<br/>&gt; time-keeping drummers. And being rhythmically adept is the easiest<br/>task for<br/>&gt; a performing musician, long before the other skills.</p><p>what do you mean by &quot;long before&quot;? might it not be one of the *last*<br/>skills a particular musician learns to perfect?</p><p>&gt; Labor does not always save the day.</p><p>which is better: sitting on your butt doing nothing, or working on<br/>yourself as an integrated human being?</p><p>&gt; &gt;perhaps that innate ability is there but hasn&apos;t been watered<br/>enough and<br/>&gt; &gt;given a chance to flower.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could be. But if someone were intrinsically a &apos;melodic&apos; person, if<br/>they<br/>&gt; walked around &quot;with song in their heart&quot; (sorry about that...), it<br/>would<br/>&gt; show up in their music.</p><p>if they were an effectively expressive musician, yes. there can be<br/>many obstacles to that too, and it can take &quot;work&quot; to remove those<br/>obstacles.</p><p>&gt; &gt;perhaps it isn&apos;t. but who are we to say? maybe future generations<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt;find our judgments quaint and outmoded.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uhhh, right...</p><p>it&apos;s happened before!</p><p>&gt; &gt;who said anything about learned technique? many people devote<br/>their lives<br/>&gt; &gt;to acheiving ever-greater levels of spiritual inspiration,<br/>starting from<br/>&gt; &gt;very meager beginnings. why couldn&apos;t the same be true of musical<br/>inspiration?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well put. I like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;yes, i&apos;ve found that if one spends years and years working on it,<br/>one can<br/>&gt; &gt;improve one&apos;s abilities as a melodist considerably. it&apos;s more a<br/>spiritual<br/>&gt; &gt;than a technical feeling when you do it, but *doing it* is the<br/>key -- just<br/>&gt; &gt;like writing prose or poetry or expressing one&apos;s emotions to<br/>others, it<br/>&gt; &gt;gets better with practice, and worse with neglect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree with the above paragraph, for the most part. *Never*<br/>doing<br/>&gt; something certainly won&apos;t yield much fruit, but unlike<br/>counterpoint,<br/>&gt; orchestration, all the task/craft-like aspects of music-making, I<br/>still<br/>&gt; think that the best of the melodists are tapping into something<br/>inside them<br/>&gt; that isn&apos;t &apos;work&apos;-related.</p><p>i wasn&apos;t talking about this &quot;best&quot; of the melodists, i was talking<br/>about someone who may have a hidden melodic spark trying to get<br/>better at it. i agree that the product, in this case, bears little<br/>resemblence to the &quot;work&quot; involved in attaining it. but even the best<br/>of melodists don&apos;t appear in a vacuum. musicians are nearly always<br/>*immersed* in some existing musical style or style, and once in a<br/>while you get a mozart, but for the most part it takes some active<br/>effort *within* that style before a musician, even a great musician,<br/>gets around to *transcending* that style in whatever small way, and<br/>making a melodic statement that is truly personal, expressive, and<br/>timeless.</p></div><h3><a id=3812 href="#3812">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Nothing more than that!</p><p>&gt;this was a completely, random, hypothetical example, meant to illustrate &gt;that even a tiny spark of innate ability can grow into a bright flame.</p><p>Wellllll, completely random it may have been, but also skewed into a rather vivid contrast of the two potentials.</p><p>&gt;these two percentages were meant to apply to the same person, in my example.</p><p>Sorry, that wasn&apos;t clear to me.</p><p>&gt;yes, you sure went far afield!</p><p>Oh, Paul, the entire conversation is drifting. You may take credit as well! :)</p><p>&gt;Paul first said: by laboriously working on one&apos;s music<br/>&gt;Jon went on: Labor ... doesn&apos;t sound like a path to melodies that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Paul finally said: this is exactly what i *didn&apos;t* mean. i meant &quot;labor&quot; &gt;in the sense of spiritual reaching</p><p>Well, your examples and your thrust seemed to parallel exactly the kind of work *I* was thinking of, the kind you hear in so many music department practice rooms, with constant (and somewhat mindless) repetition droning on and on. I know you to be a spiritual person, but I also know you to be a rather exacting person. When you say &quot;work&quot; and &quot;labor&quot; I tend to think of the classic meanings, not &quot;laboriously working&quot; as translated to &quot;spiritual quest&quot;, &quot;transcendence&quot;, or &quot;magic&quot;.</p><p>&gt;... nose-to-the-grindstone counterpoint exercises or whatever you imagined &gt;(inspired, i&apos;m sure, by your continuing prejudices about me as a human being).</p><p>C&apos;mon, Paul, I&apos;m not harboring those thoughts! I&apos;m just reading plain ascii (especially the kind without capital letters, where someone is just too *busy* to hit the shift key so it can be read easily...).</p><p>&gt;this process of transcendence i have read about in many accounts by many &gt;great musicians, and like to think i might have experienced myself now and &gt;then, and is quite the opposite of &quot;just cranking out labored tunes&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t know that it is the &quot;opposite&quot;, but, sure, *that* kind of musical journey is always a fulfilling one.</p><p>&gt;well then i may have overstated the point, which was a reaction to what &gt;you *were* saying.</p><p>I just *knew* it was my fault in some way!</p><p>&gt;i have to say you&apos;re probably right, but for any given individual, how can &gt;you presume to say never? my own personal experience contradicts that in &gt;the strongest of terms. so i prefer to give each musician a chance, and &gt;let the chips fall as they may.</p><p>I specifically said that I would still encourage and work with that kind of individual (I happened to also be the only person that would still take on beginning students, while others just carved out their time for more advance or collegiate players). I don&apos;t look on it as a presumption that young Bob or Sylvia will never make a good drummer - I&apos;ll work with them, but also keep an eye (or ear) out for the part of music that is stronger in them than rhythm.</p><p>I don&apos;t happen to believe that everyone can do everything. I think that everyone can maximize and fully realize that set of &apos;things&apos; that just seem so very right for them as an individual. I find the journey of discovering the strengths in each individual to be joyous and exciting, and I also find it a shame when another is kept on false &quot;learning life support&quot; in an endeavor that is probably not playing to their inner strong points.</p><p>I know you want to &quot;let the chips fall&quot;, and that is fine. I was speaking more to a real mastery of something, and not simply having a rudimentary grasp. *Anyone* who would study percussion with me would be better after x number of sessions than not at all. That does not mean that they would all progress equally, or end up in the same place. There will always be those that have IT, and those that don&apos;t. Even those that don&apos;t can have a good time, too.</p><p>&gt;what do you mean by &quot;long before&quot;? might it not be one of the *last* &gt;skills a particular musician learns to perfect?</p><p>Sure, but that isn&apos;t what I meant. I meant that if a musician were to work on all the musicianly skills, rhythmic training would be the easiest to come to grips with.</p><p>&gt;which is better: sitting on your butt doing nothing, or working on &gt;yourself as an integrated human being?</p><p>Gee, the second option?</p><p>&gt;if they were an effectively expressive musician, yes. there can be many &gt;obstacles to that too, and it can take &quot;work&quot; to remove those obstacles.</p><p>Obstacles?</p><p>&gt;i wasn&apos;t talking about this &quot;best&quot; of the melodists, i was talking about &gt;someone who may have a hidden melodic spark trying to get better at it.</p><p>And this sort of sums it up: a hidden spark.
