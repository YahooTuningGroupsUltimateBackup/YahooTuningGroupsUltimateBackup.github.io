It started by me playing in her band as a sideman(she also<br/>played piano), jazz and blues and poetry, and I remember she used to<br/>tell the audience, &quot;there are major chords and there are minor<br/>chords and there are the chords dan plays&quot;, never knew if she meant<br/>it as a compliment or not! We played a few nice gigs..i remember one<br/>on the same bill with Frisell and Tim Berne in a planetarium, and<br/>another completely impromptu thing where Symmetry was playing on the<br/>same bill as Jean and her poetry and we accompanied her for over an<br/>hour off the cuff. Anyway, her quartet eventually turned into a duo,<br/>me and her, and that&apos;s where these 4-track recordings come from. I<br/>haven&apos;t seen or heard of/from her for at least 15 years. So this<br/>tune is a mix of the old and the new with the new parts probably<br/>outnumbering the old parts now, but even that&apos;s not quite right as a<br/>lot were flown in from older, period recording, but there&apos;s a lot of<br/>brand new stuff in there too. All parts are x-15, but there are<br/>alsoa few important real-time external devices and parts flown in at<br/>the mix through an 8-track mixer; so it&apos;s not quite 4-track in any<br/>purist sense .I was trying for a kind of dreamstate feel with the<br/>mix of acoustics and electronics melting into a happy, crazy magic<br/>where you don&apos;t so much notice it&apos;s a song with a lot of part<br/>changes and little orchestrated complexities... that was the thing i<br/>was going for. I would like to get some compression and some NR,<br/>maybe a little exciter or EQ too...but for now it&apos;s good enough.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for anyone who might be interested, i&apos;ve uploaded a collaboration<br/>&gt; with jazz poet/ musician Jean Lozoaritis called &quot;I saw myself&quot;.<br/>This<br/>&gt; is a reworking--more guitar, less smiley smile--of an earlier<br/>piece,<br/>&gt; infinite angels .It&apos;s a strange mix of surrealism and song, and<br/>i&apos;d<br/>&gt; be interested to know what you might think .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw myself<br/>&gt; (last song on bottom of the page)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jean lozoaritis--vocals, lyrics<br/>&gt; daniel stearns--acoustic, electric and classical guitars,<br/>&gt; mandolin,piccolo upright, keyboards and electronics, acoustic and<br/>&gt; electronic percussion, fujarka, voice and tape<br/>&gt;</p></div>
