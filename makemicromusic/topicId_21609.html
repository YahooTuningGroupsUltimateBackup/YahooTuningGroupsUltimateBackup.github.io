It&apos;s something new to<br/>me. There are a lot of strange and exotic sonorities in this piece. While<br/>from my perspective, it lacks the immediate emotional &quot;tear at the<br/>heartstrings&quot; impact of 5-limit music, it instead has a much more subtle and<br/>cerebral sense of well-being to it. Maybe that&apos;s the hallmark of 11-limit<br/>music as opposed to 5-limit music.</p><p>I really like this, I&apos;m going to put it on repeat as I sleep tonight and see<br/>if I come to an epic epiphany about the nature of music.

The pitches are described in the blog post.<br/><a href="http://bumpermusic.blogspot.com/2009/12/winding-out-to-pacific-take-17.html">http://bumpermusic.blogspot.com/2009/12/winding-out-to-pacific-take-17.html</a></p><p>Here&apos;s another way to think of it.</p><p>I generate four 8 note scales from the tonality diamond, what I call sub-minor, minor, major, and supermajor, as shown on the diamond in the blog post. I then pick out a fourth chord from each scale, starting at the 7th degree of each scale. I pick fourths that are close to 30 72EDO steps, or 60 steps for two fourths. For example, in C major, think of a chord made up of Bb,  E, Ab, C, G, B, F#, Bb, E. The exact notes are listed in Sagittal notation in a graphic on the blog post.</p><p>Then I transpose each scale so that the third scale degree is in common for each.</p><p>Here are the scale degrees of the fourth chords:</p><p>subminor   726 158 473<br/>minor      736 251 473<br/>major      736 251 472<br/>supermajor 726 148 372</p><p>The prominent bass note is the 7th degree of the scale, the 8:7 in major. This is what you hear on the bottom as a drone. It&apos;s made louder cause I like loud bass. I use finger piano and sine wave samples for the low notes.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, Prent, do you have a score or MIDI for this?

I used to use the just intonation scales directly, but they limited my flexibility. For example, the diamond produces the four scales I wanted to use. But the common note is the first degree of the scale, and I wanted the third degree of each scale to be in common. With 72 EDO I can transpose each chord until whatever note I want is in common across the scales.</p><p>For example, the 72 EDO approximations of the four scales, what I call sub-minor, minor, major, and supermajor, can be written as 8 note scales. The chords are arranged by determining which scale degree is where in the chord like this:</p><p>SubMinor scale       7   2   6   1   5   8   4   7   3<br/>Minor scale          7   3   6   2   5   1   4   7   3<br/>Major scale          7   3   6   2   5   1   4   7   3<br/>SupMajor scale       7   2   6   1   4   8   3   7   2</p><p>Where the 7th note in the scale is the first note in the chord, the 2nd degree is the second note, the 6th degree is the third note, and so on.</p><p>I can represent these scales in 72 EDO using the following table. In this table, the first degree of the scale is note 0 in 72 EDO. Zero is the first degree of each of the four scales.</p><p>SubMinor scale       7   2   6   1   5   8   4   7   3<br/>SubMinor 72 EDO  0  53   8  42   0  30  63  23  53  16</p><p>Minor scale          7   3   6   2   5   1   4   7   3<br/>Minor 72 EDO     0  56  19  49   9  42   0  30  56  19</p><p>Major scale          7   3   6   2   5   1   4   7   3<br/>Major 72 EDO     0  58  23  50  12  42   0  33  58  23</p><p>SupMajor scale       7   2   6   1   4   8   3   7   2<br/>SupMajor 72 EDO  0  51  12  42   0  26  61  19  51  12</p><p>But I don&apos;t want the 1st scale degree in common; I want the third degree in common.
