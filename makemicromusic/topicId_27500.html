It is without an ounce of doubt that<br/>beautiful recordings can be made with as simple a tool as a freely<br/>available vintage FM synth out there such as Kontakt FM7. In this<br/>regard, I find the mentioned Kurzweil Flagship and Korg Kronos to be<br/>bloated keyboards whose various capabilities are readily reproduced with<br/>lesser cost quad-core Macs running the right DAW and plug-ins (or<br/>standalones). Add to this better microtonal control using the right<br/>software... It is a shame that a single joystick design is implemented<br/>even today to awkwardly force the pitch bend of all MIDI notes<br/>simultaneously! These companies understand nothing of the power of xentones.</p><p>Upon Jim&apos;s suggestion, I wonder if a Flagship microsynth from Starr Labs<br/>is velocity-sensitive? I know Aaron Andrew Hunt has not yet implemented<br/>velocity-sensitive buttons to his Tonal-Plexus and U-Plex models. The<br/>Haaken Continuum Keyboard is also tagging my mind. There is also the<br/>forgotten John Allen NoteBender if it is still around.</p><p>I also agree with Lobawad that space is very much neglected in favour of<br/>electronic apparatus. A biased half of the budget (if not more) should<br/>actually be invested in space design. Ambience is everything in<br/>acoustics.That leaves me with less than 50,000 dollars for the equipment<br/>and computers.</p><p>Though the cent increment is sufficient for you Robert, I wouldn&apos;t<br/>settle for anything less than 0.1 cents. Most, if not all of the gear<br/>should be able to operate with precise pitch resolutions.</p><p>Joel seems to prefer ProTools. I&apos;ve seen it once or twice. It&apos;s<br/>definitely big and expensive, not to mention slick and smooth. But what<br/>is the most economical Studio-starter pack I ponder? I mean, of course,<br/>a software-hardware bundle for both a Mac and a PC hooked together to<br/>the Studio. I&apos;ve seen ProTools + Mbox for a 1000 Euros. What else would<br/>you good folk recommend? Perhaps sticking with Logic Pro or even Ableton<br/>Live?</p><p>Chris made some very clever suggestions. As you can tell Chris, the<br/>Studio should contain a backup PC unit running Windows 7 just in case<br/>the Mac gives us grief. Or else, an extra working booth with the PC in<br/>it could yield double work seances. In my opinion, a Mac should go with<br/>either Logic Pro or ProTools or both. An extra license for the PC<br/>wouldn&apos;t hurt (unless cost is an issue). But if we go with ProTools, the<br/>natural choice lies with C24 control surface (10000 USD), no? Or else,<br/>you will perhaps tell me that the same quality can be achieved for less.</p><p>Joey appeals to my senses with a basic and sufficient solution. Why not<br/>indeed cut back on the needless fancy electronics and stick with the<br/>essentials? Same as AKJ said. A couple of really good mics with a few<br/>acoustic instruments and self-contained micro-friendly electronic synths<br/>(H-Pi TonalPlexus for instance) will work wonders with a wholly vast<br/>space and a really solid computer recording environment (Mac Pro,<br/>ProTools+gear, Monitors, sound insulation).</p><p>I&apos;m also thinking, next to Tolgahan&apos;s guitar, a trombone, clarinet,<br/>kemenche, ud... If money permits.</p><p>Of course, the whole thing should be built so as to allow expansion.</p><p>Here, I really would like a second opinion from AKJ and gang to fill in<br/>the untouched blanks with an imaginative set of unpretentious but<br/>capable digital tools to effectuate a microtonal-oriented<br/>recording/mixing studio.</p><p>Thanks!<br/>Oz.</p><p>*</p><p>Perhaps a comparison is in order.
