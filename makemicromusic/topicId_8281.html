It is just a pain in the<br/>ass to try to score something in 22 in the &quot;Piano Roll&quot; view when you<br/>are stuck with the 12-tone octave layout.  Is there a sequencer out<br/>there that has better microtonal implementation?</p><p>2) I have also come to the conclusion that I have enough microtonal<br/>electric guitars (22-edo, 31-edo, 15-edo in the works, and Catler<br/>semi-JI) and I now need an acoustic.  These are evidently more<br/>difficult to refret and thus more costly, so before I shell out I<br/>just wanted to see if anyone on this board has or knows of someone<br/>who has an &quot;extra&quot; microtonal acoustic guitar they might want to<br/>unload.  I&apos;m not particular about the tuning/temperament or about the<br/>cosmetics; I just want a microtonal guitar I can carry around campus<br/>with me to confuse the music majors ;-).</p><p>Thanks a bunch!</p><p>-Igliashon</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I have to think, coming from your background as a guitarist, that tactile interaction is very much a part of your music making. Even with rudimentary kbd chops, it might make more sense to find a 22tet kbd layout that makes sense to you and put stuff in that way, even if you have to enter things in step mode (or whatever Cubase might call it). I can&apos;t believe people can enter entire pieces in a paino roll format (typo intended), but I&apos;ve seen it happen. Completely not for me.</p><p>&gt;Is there a sequencer out there that has better microtonal implementation?</p><p>Not that I&apos;m aware of. They all still stare at MIDI as 0-127 bits of info, and none of them try to wrap their heads around anything but 12tet. I think it can be still worked around, but it depends on your personality and approach to making/composing music. It would be interesting to see if someone could develop a modest microtonal sequencer with a toolbox like KeyKit - <a href="http://nosuch.com/keykit/">http://nosuch.com/keykit/</a> - but I don&apos;t have the time to do it right now.</p><p>Best of luck.

My current setup sort of forces me to do that<br/>anyway.  My audio multitracker is AudioDesk 2.0, which has no MIDI<br/>sequencing.  The sequencing comes from either Numerology (a<br/>performance oriented soft-sequencer inspired by analog sequencers of<br/>the 70s), or the onboard sequencer of my Emu XL7 - either of those<br/>trigger the notes of my synths and AudioDesk just records the audio<br/>output of those synths.</p><p>Are you trying to produce a score for other musicians to read and<br/>perform from?

If you&apos;re working with soft synths, you want synths that can<br/>load tuning files in the fairly standard file formats (.scl, .tun,<br/>etc.).  That is, you want a synth that supports user tuning tables.<br/>Such a table establishes a mapping in the synth, so incoming MIDI note<br/>number values are mapped to the tuning&apos;s pitches.  Thus, the<br/>microtuning is done internally in the synth, instead of by MIDI pitch<br/>bend.</p><p>Yes, the disadvantage of this method is that it is hard to tell from<br/>the sequencer display what MIDI note number is mapped to what pitch.<br/>MIDI note number 61 may be C# in 12t-ET, but once you change the<br/>tuning, it will map to a different pitch.  The display for Numerology,<br/>a sequencer I use a lot, shows the notes as sliders just like the 70s<br/>sequencers.  The default range per note slider is +12 and -12, but it<br/>can be increased.  I don&apos;t know if its limited to multiples of 12 or<br/>if the number of steps is user-assignable (say, +22 and -22 for use<br/>with 22t-ET) - I haven&apos;t played with that feature too much.  Of course<br/>if you have a tuning like 88tET so that you use up 88 MIDI note<br/>numbers in just one octave, you will have to use another instance (or<br/>2, or 5, etc.) of your soft synth to cover the range that you want.<br/>This I believe is what George was referring to.</p><p>Hope this was of some use,<br/>Paolo</p></div>
