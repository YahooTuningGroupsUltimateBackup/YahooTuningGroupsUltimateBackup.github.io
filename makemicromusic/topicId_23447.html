The feedback I received about the one minute work was exceptional.  My dance department colleagues encouraged me to continue to develop the work.  That is why I am writing to you. Â… I would like to triple the length of the dance for our upcoming faculty concert; and, I am wondering if there is more to this piece than the one minute.  If you would be willing to share more music, please let me know.  I would be willing to send you a video of the dance to your music if you&apos;d like.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Nola Nolen Holland, M.F.A.<br/>President-elect, CORPS de Ballet International, Inc.<br/>Co-director, The Dance in India Initiative<br/>Department of Dance<br/>Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania &gt;&gt;</p><p>I am happy to report that, because my composition, Dekany: 8 Through12, was basically computer-generated, it took only a few more emails and half an evening&apos;s work to produce an expanded (4&apos;30&quot;) version of my original 60-second piece in time for the Thursday (21 Oct) rehearsal, which, according to a subsequent email I received, was reported to be a &quot;smashing success ... absolutely perfect in timing and content. ... In these days of copyright, royalties, and legalities, your willingness to expand your work via long distance communication has been exceedingly refreshing.  Thank you.&quot;  Hopefully, the SLU Dance Department may be open to working with other MMM members who would like to collaborate on future projects, so, on behalf of our group, I intend to make a suggestion to that effect in my next reply.</p><p>My piece will be performed in the SRU Faculty and Guest Artist Dance Concert on Tuesday, 26 Oct at 8 p.m.  Slippery Rock is located north of Pittsburgh, PA and east of Youngstown, OH.  In case anyone in that area wishes to attend, further information is at:<br/><a href="http://www.sru.edu/academics/colleges/chfpa/dance/Pages/events.aspx">http://www.sru.edu/academics/colleges/chfpa/dance/Pages/events.aspx</a><br/>Since this is a world premiere, I will not be giving a link to (and further details regarding) the expanded version of my piece until after the performance.</p><p>Some of you will recall that Andy Hasenpflug collaborated with Aaron Krister Johnson to create the Divide by Pi albums.  He is presently musician/accompanist for the Dance Department at Slippery Rock, and I understand that he is also trying to get a video of the UnTwelve 60x60 dance mix performed at Slippery Rock on 7 Oct to make available to our MMM group.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2010 12:55:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Some of you will recall that Andy Hasenpflug collaborated with Aaron<br/>&gt;Krister Johnson to create the Divide by Pi albums.

So I felt obligated to contribute something, even though I was severely strapped for time.</p><p>Therefore, my contribution was something &quot;quick &amp; dirty&quot; that I put together rather quickly by modifying the &quot;Tumbling Dekany&quot; spreadsheet that Dave Keenan and Andy Fillebrown:<br/><a href="http://www.dkeenan.com/Music/StereoDekany.htm">http://www.dkeenan.com/Music/StereoDekany.htm</a><br/>So my contribution was essentially a collaborative work, in which I was basically both interpreter and performer, establishing a particular mood by choosing a new set of harmonic tones (8,9,10,11,12-dekany), a different timbre, and variations in tempo to produce an alternative realization of the original &quot;Tumbling Dekany&quot; 60 seconds long:<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12.mp3</a></p><p>Here are the program notes:</p><p>&lt;&lt; _Dekany: 8 Through 12_ is one of many possible microtonal realizations derived from a scale-creation algorithm of Erv Wilson, utilized in a computer program written by Dave Keenan and Andy Fillebrown. The factors that generate this particular 10-tone just intonation scale, an 8&middot;9&middot;10&middot;11&middot;12 dekany combination product set, were chosen by George Secor in order to achieve a polyphonic texture in which the individual voices combine to produce melodic lines characterized by a descending-stepwise pattern and &quot;otherworldly&quot; harmonies resulting from the presence of the 11 factor. &gt;&gt;</p><p>As it turned out, there were so many entries for the 60x60 UnTwelve mix that I didn&apos;t expect that this one would make the cut, so I was even more surprised that, without any sort of meter or rhythmic pulse in the music, Nola Nolen&apos;s choreography was so successful that she asked if I could supply a longer version of the piece.  As she described it, &quot;I took a Merce Cunningham approach to putting the dance and music together.  In other words, rather than choreograph to your music, I created the dance independently without setting movements to the music, without analyzing the structure of the music, and without setting or seeking landmarks within it.  The dance and music simply proceded from their simultaneous and individual beginnings. ...  Your music created a mystique for the piece.  Since there was no set design, the music created the atmosphere for the dance as well as provided a soundscape to which the dancers moved. ...  Just to let you know briefly about my choreographic process, I created the movement independently of the music so that I would not be influenced by the music&apos;s stucture, sound, or ambiance.  I was going for a sculptural effect of the two dancers&apos; bodies - no emotion, no story - just the bodies in the space.  I entitled the work &apos;Calder&apos; after the 20th century sculptor.  That&apos;s the only reference for the movement.&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s the expanded (4&apos;30&quot;) version that I made for the 26 October performance (in 2 different file formats):<br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.ogg">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.ogg</a></p><p>I haven&apos;t seen or heard anything yet about videos of either performance, other than that they do exist, but I&apos;ll keep you posted.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2010 9:07:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That is exceptionally beautiful George!</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p><p>On 2/11/10 1:21 PM, gdsecor wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the expanded (4&apos;30&quot;) version that I made for the 26 &gt; October performance (in 2 different file formats):<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.mp3">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.mp3</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.ogg">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Dekany_8-12A.ogg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t seen or heard anything yet about videos of either &gt; performance, other than that they do exist, but I&apos;ll keep you &gt; posted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>11/2/2010 2:09:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I didn&apos;t get to listen until now.
