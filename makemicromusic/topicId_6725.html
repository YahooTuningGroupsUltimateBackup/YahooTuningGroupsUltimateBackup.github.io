Some tunings seem more suited than others.</p><p>I&apos;ll bet. And we&apos;ve gotten to the point where pieces can be composed that could take advantage of &apos;modulating&apos; to different tunings without a great deal of difficulty, and a very simple piece, cast in different tunings, might point out areas that one could take advantage of these mods.</p><p>I wish I didn&apos;t think about things I probably don&apos;t have time to do...</p><p>&gt;Hmm, maybe I&apos;ll dust off my examples &amp; post somewhere.</p><p>There you go threatening us again.

No to say i have not experience<br/>a &apos;wrongness&apos; more than once if not appalled at the reaction ( no pun<br/>intended). Often though this is just an initial response to having it say<br/>something different that i had intended. After the shock of this, i have grown<br/>to like newer versions of some pieces for doing just that, going beyond what i<br/>had attempted or accomplished. Sometimes such things have been unavoidable<br/>when one has to cannibalize one instrument for another as i have had to do<br/>with some pump organs, not so much to retune the reeds as to put a new set of<br/>reed in a pre existing body with bellows. one feels like playing one&apos;s one<br/>little piece and there it is , different.<br/>    I say the decision is the composers until he is dead and then the reality<br/>that a piece of music has a life of its own separate from its creator must be<br/>accepted.<br/>As i mentioned, Lou Harrison wrote many pieces to be played on any pelog or<br/>slendro even though i am sure there are some he would love and others he would<br/>not.</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.
