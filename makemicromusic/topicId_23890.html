Forgotten Works contain remakes and reconstructions of few songs from eighties. Some of them are microtonal although most of them were presented here already. Flex Nr. 3 - 9 is a collection of my sine tone studies, most of them in no tuning but some in various ETs.</p><p><a href="http://www.uvnitr.cz/music/music.html">http://www.uvnitr.cz/music/music.html</a></p><p>Enjoy!<br/>Milan</p></div>
