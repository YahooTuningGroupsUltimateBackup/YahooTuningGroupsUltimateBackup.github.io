(I designed the Clavette, but it was built for me at<br/>the Institute of Sonology at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague,<br/>Netherlands.)<br/>The performance footage was done by a professional in a 4-camera<br/>studio.<br/>(I can&apos;t make DVDs yet, although eventually that should be possible.)</p><p>I also have &quot;The Clavette: A Microtonal MIDI Keyboard Controller&quot; a<br/>35-minute SVHS/VHS<br/>documentary about the Clavette, although none of its footage was shot<br/>by a pro, and so quality &amp; other aspects of it can look amateurish.<br/>However, the program provides a brief tutorial about microtonality<br/>along with<br/>performance footage of several Clavette solo pieces.</p><p>I would like to get the program(s) broadcast on public access cable<br/>TV channels<br/>in the US and abroad, and am wondering if any of you would be<br/>willing to submit<br/>a tape for broadcast. At the moment, I only have NTSC format tapes,<br/>although I could<br/>see if I could make PAL or SECAM tapes if there&apos;s interest.</p><p>I also plan to make a streaming or download-able versions of each<br/>program for the web,<br/>but these would only include excerpts from each complete program.</p><p>I would send tape directly to the stations, except that at least in<br/>the US, often<br/>the stations require a local sponsor of the program, which sometimes<br/>means that<br/>the local sponsor must be already be a member of the station--that<br/>fee can range<br/>from 0 to perhaps 70 dollars. Sometimes people can be remote<br/>members, but this is usually<br/>not worth the expense.</p><p>If you could sponsor a tape for local public access broadcast,<br/>please reply to<br/>harold_fortuin@...</p><p>with your mailing address &amp; the name of the station(s) you have in<br/>mind.<br/>Please first check the policies of your local station before<br/>replying to this message.</p><p>You can probably find your local public access station from one of<br/>these links:</p><p><a href="http://www.silcom.com/~taxabo/tv.htm">http://www.silcom.com/~taxabo/tv.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.alliancecm.org/index.php?page_id=16">http://www.alliancecm.org/index.php?page_id=16</a><br/><a href="http://www.phone-soft.org/layout-3/cyber-world/make-frame.php3">http://www.phone-soft.org/layout-3/cyber-world/make-frame.php3</a>?<br/>framename=0040i.htm</p><p>Anyone who will sponsor a local broadcast,<br/>and can send me proof of broadcast<br/>(like a link to the broadcast schedule or printout including the<br/>program)<br/>is permitted to keep the tape for personal, non-profit use<br/>once the local station is done broadcasting.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to buy a VHS NTSC tape of both programs for personal,<br/>non-profit use<br/>without sponsoring a local broadcast, send your mailing address to<br/>harold_fortuin@... &amp; I&apos;ll reply with the cost &amp; other details.</p><p>Of course, feel free to forward this message to any relevant friends<br/>&amp; colleagues.</p><p>Thanks for your consideration,<br/>Harold Fortuin<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin">www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin</a></p></div><h3><a id=7992 href="#7992">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2004 1:48:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Harold!</p><p>&gt;I have just completed &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, a 7m 35s SVHS/VHS TV program<br/>&gt;featuring my original composition &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, played by Kris<br/>&gt;Peck on Asta, his self-built 20-tone JI electric guitar, and myself on<br/>&gt;Clavette microtonal MIDI keyboard (which plays a Kurzweil K2000 organ<br/>&gt;sound).
