More valuable, IMO. he also debates jazz VERSUS<br/>improvisation, and the yin-yang balance, and the virtue of<br/>retreating to contemplatively grow vegetables in the country ...<br/>Well worth a read for every practising or apiring musician, I think.</p><p>So far I&apos;ve just listened to the first piece, based on Messiaen, and<br/>haven&apos;t got past it, since I&apos;m now playing it for the third time!<br/>This music is SO good.
