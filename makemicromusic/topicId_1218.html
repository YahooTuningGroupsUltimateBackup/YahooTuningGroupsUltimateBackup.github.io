On my keyboard, it would be spelled,<br/>for example</p><p>D3-F3-G3-Bb3-D4</p><p>Here, in my &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot; modes, the 3-step can be treated as<br/>either a &quot;minor third&quot; or as a special kind of &quot;whole-tone-like&quot;<br/>interval, as this spelling might suggest.</p><p>In a neo-Gothic kind of style, I came up with a couple of resolutions,<br/>although in various styles this sonority could also stand as a &quot;stable<br/>concord&quot;:</p><p>D                              S11<br/>Bb B                           S7   S8<br/>G                              S4<br/>F                              S1<br/>D  E     or more generally     S-2  S0</p><p>where &quot;S&quot; shows the lowest note of a stable sonority, and all the<br/>other notes are given relative to that step. Another resolution is:</p><p>D                              S9<br/>B  C#                          S5   S8<br/>G                              S2<br/>F                              S-1<br/>D  F#1   or more generally     S-4  S0</p><p>&gt; Wish you could hear it - sounds great<br/>&gt; as scale on my SB live! Sitar.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll prob. include it in the c.d. if<br/>&gt; I make one of my musical examples /<br/>&gt; improvisations.</p><p>May I lend you some encouragement here, please.</p><p>One issue for me with my cassette was, &quot;This is so tentative, do I<br/>really want this on a CD.&quot;</p><p>Now I&apos;m more and more convinced that getting the music out there is<br/>important, with disclaimers if necessarily as to this being an<br/>&quot;improvisation in progress&quot; or whatever.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve done an mp3 of it for now, for those<br/>&gt; who can listen to it.</p><p>May I hope that people who can hear it, which means _lots_ of people<br/>here, get great enjoyment for your sitar timbre, something really<br/>interesting for 13-tET, and an example of how experimentation can<br/>often be the best teacher.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
