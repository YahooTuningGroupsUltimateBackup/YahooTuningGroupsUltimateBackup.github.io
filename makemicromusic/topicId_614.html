It&apos;s found among every people on Earth. Is it<br/>hardwired into the brain or carried in our genes?<br/>Model: Doug Lohmeyer/Gilla Roos Body Painting by Tara Meadows<br/>Take a step toward the wall mural in psychologist Sandra Trehub&apos;s lab, and<br/>you&apos;ll find yourself in a tropical rain forest, enveloped by a riot of<br/>purple flowers, lush green ferns, oversize butterflies and bees. The only<br/>thing missing is the cry of macaws. But take a step back, and you&apos;re likely<br/>to hear other cries&iuml;&iquest;&half; those of babies. And then it all makes sense&iuml;&iquest;&half; the<br/>forest, the Teletubbies, the toy trucks scattered on the floor, the<br/>graceful mobiles hanging from the ceiling, the picture books and bright<br/>posters. This is a lab where mothers and very small children feel<br/>comfortable. It is also a lab with a very specific quest, a search within<br/>the infant brain for the biological roots of music.</p><p>Thousands of babies have passed through this facility at the University of<br/>Toronto at Mississauga in the past 25 years, and each one has departed with<br/>a diploma attesting to his or her contribution to &quot;the advancement of<br/>science and the understanding of child development.&quot; Here Trehub has<br/>observed parents singing to their babies and watched how the babies respond<br/>to those songs (they are mesmerized). She has studied the history and<br/>universality of lullabies (they sound the same the world over). She has<br/>documented the power of a mother&apos;s singing (it decreases stress hormones in<br/>her child). She also has found that babies seem to have an innate<br/>appreciation for music.</p><p>In one study, for example, a pudgy-faced, redheaded 8-month-old sits on his<br/>mother&apos;s lap in a soundproof booth, fascinated by the fluffy toy a smiling<br/>lady is waving in his face. In the corner, an audio speaker spits out a<br/>tinny little tune over and over&iuml;&iquest;&half; the sequence of notes arranged on the<br/>Western major scale (do re mi fa sol la ti do) familiar to fans of The<br/>Sound of Music. At first, the baby seems indifferent. Then an anomalous<br/>note&iuml;&iquest;&half; one that doesn&apos;t belong in the scale&iuml;&iquest;&half; intrudes on the recording, and<br/>he suddenly turns his head toward the speaker. He&apos;ll do this repeatedly<br/>when the wrong note is played.</p><p>Some might argue that the baby has learned since birth to recognize notes<br/>common to Western music. But a second experiment casts doubt on that<br/>assertion. This time the tune played has an inherently musical structure,<br/>yet it&apos;s built on an invented scale unfamiliar to Westerners. Nevertheless,<br/>Trehub&apos;s infant subjects still pick out anomalous notes&iuml;&iquest;&half; even better than<br/>adults do. &quot;I&apos;m convinced that there&apos;s a biological basis for the babies&apos;<br/>abilities,&quot; Trehub says. &quot;Music making is so successful in managing the<br/>baby&apos;s state and getting the baby to sleep that it makes the task of caring<br/>for the baby easier. It takes the edge off this enormous burden.&quot;</p><p>A baby that&apos;s better cared for is more likely to survive to adulthood and<br/>reproduce. And that gets to the crux of a debate that has galvanized<br/>evolutionary biologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists alike. If the<br/>ability to appreciate music is ingrained in the human brain, could music<br/>making have evolved to help us survive and reproduce? Is it akin to<br/>language and the ability to solve complicated problems, attributes that<br/>have enhanced human survival? Or is it just &quot;auditory cheesecake,&quot; as<br/>cognitive scientist Steven Pinker of the Massachusetts Institute of<br/>Technology has called it&iuml;&iquest;&half; a phenomenon that pushes pleasure buttons without<br/>truly filling an evolutionary need?</p><p>No one has ever seen a need to build a robot equipped to appreciate music,<br/>says Steven Pinker of MIT. This suggests that music, unlike eyesight, is<br/>not essential for long-term human survival.<br/>Sometime between 43,000 and 82,000 years ago, a Neanderthal living in a<br/>cave in what is now Slovenia fashioned a flute from the femur of a bear.<br/>Simpler instruments such as rattles and drums probably preceded it, and<br/>singing probably began even earlier&iuml;&iquest;&half; perhaps as long as 250,000 years ago.</p><p>Why? Why has music spread to every country and every people in the world?<br/>Why is music used to rouse armies, praise God, and bury the dead? Charles<br/>Darwin, for one, thought music helped humans find mates. In his 1871 book,<br/>The Descent of Man, he suggested that early men and women, unable to<br/>express their love in words, &quot;endeavored to charm each other with musical<br/>notes and rhythm,&quot; as birds do. But proof is still lacking.</p><p>Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of New<br/>Mexico, has looked at thousands of jazz, rock, and classical music albums<br/>and noted the age and sex of the musicians. In every genre of music, he<br/>says, men produce about 10 times as much as women, and their output peaks<br/>at around age 30&iuml;&iquest;&half; near the time of their peak reproductive years. &quot;Good<br/>musicians, particularly good singers, attract sexual interest,&quot; Miller<br/>says. &quot;Successful male musicians are notoriously promiscuous and tend to<br/>produce a lot of children&iuml;&iquest;&half; and that&apos;s how the genes for musical ability<br/>tend to be passed on.&quot;</p><p>Still, there&apos;s no evidence that women are any less musically inclined than<br/>men. Women in all cultures sing to their infants, Trehub points out, and<br/>there is no hard evidence that talented musicians are particularly<br/>prolific. In fact, Hajime Fukui, an evolutionary psychologist at Nara<br/>University of Education in Japan, maintains that music reduces sexual<br/>activity. In one study, Fukui gathered 35 male students and 35 female<br/>students, measured their hormone levels, and then played them half an hour<br/>of music of all types. Afterward, Fukui found, the men&apos;s testosterone<br/>levels had gone down and the women&apos;s had gone up. Silence had no effect.</p><p>Fukui believes that when early humans formed communities, they had to<br/>develop ways to alleviate sexual tensions. &quot;We may assume that their<br/>solution was music,&quot; he says. If music lowered testosterone levels in men,<br/>it made them less sexually active. If it increased testosterone in women,<br/>it made them more aggressive and less social. The net result was less sex,<br/>and less sexual tension. &quot;National anthems, work songs, party music, and<br/>war music all have the same effect,&quot; Fukui says. &quot;They diminish fear,<br/>relieve tension, and boost people&apos;s sense of solidarity. Music moves<br/>people, throws them into a trancelike state, and paralyzes their ability to<br/>think logically. We might think that we are the users of music. In fact, we<br/>are not the puppeteers but the puppets of music.&quot;</p><p>In Sandra Trehub&apos;s lab, a clucking chicken or a shuffling puppy greets this<br/>6-month-old baby when she turns her head toward unusual musical notes.<br/>Music can also mitigate stress. In one recent study, neurologist Barry<br/>Bittman of the Mind-Body Wellness Center in Meadville, Pennsylvania,<br/>gathered a group of 10 people and had them beat hand drums for an hour<br/>while a music &quot;facilitator&quot; conducted. Afterward, Bittman took blood<br/>samples. The drummers, he found, had heightened levels of immune cells<br/>called natural killer cells that seek out and destroy both cancer cells and<br/>cells infected by viruses. A control group that read in silence experienced<br/>no such upsurge.</p><p>Bittman believes that group drumming, through its camaraderie, support,<br/>exercise, and music making, signals the brain to lower the production of<br/>cortisol, a stress hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Less cortisol<br/>has been associated with a heightened immune response and may help the body<br/>fight off infection. &quot;I&apos;m not saying I have a cure for cancer,&quot; Bittman<br/>cautions. &quot;But what I am saying is that we have a very important step in<br/>understanding a delightful, enjoyable, and fun way for people to reverse<br/>the stress response in a manner that leads us to positive biological<br/>changes.&quot;</p><p>None of that impresses MIT&apos;s Steven Pinker. &quot;I think people who argue that<br/>music is an adaptation have confused the everyday meaning of the term&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>meaning something that is beneficial or salubrious&iuml;&iquest;&half; with the biological<br/>meaning of the term, which is something that causally increases the rate of<br/>reproduction or survival,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, it&apos;s not enough just to show that<br/>something is correlated with reproduction. Wearing a linen suit or driving<br/>a Porsche might help you find a sex partner, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s an<br/>adaptation. What you need to do is show, on sheer engineering grounds and<br/>in terms of cause and effect, that some particular trait would lead to an<br/>adaptive outcome.&quot;</p><p>To prove that having two eyes is an adaptive trait, for instance, one first<br/>has to use geometry to show that stereoscopic vision enables depth<br/>perception. In turn, one can argue that animals that perceive depth are<br/>better at foraging, escaping predators, and finding a mate. It&apos;s not enough<br/>to point out that guitar heroes tend to be sexually successful, or that<br/>making music helps foster social unity. One has to explain why &quot;rhythmic<br/>plinking sounds,&quot; as Pinker calls music, are sexually appealing or<br/>conducive to bonding. If music is about sexuality, why do children and the<br/>elderly care for it? And if it&apos;s all about bonding, why do people like to<br/>listen to it alone?</p><p>Not every common trait is adaptive, Pinker adds, citing his favorite<br/>example: &quot;Let&apos;s say someone asked, what&apos;s the adaptive value of cheesecake?<br/>The answer is, there is none. It&apos;s bad for you. But it is a by-product of<br/>other adaptations, namely a taste for sweets and fats, which were adaptive<br/>in an environment in which sweets and fats were rare.&quot; A chemist can prove<br/>the adaptive value of sweets and fats by burning them&iuml;&iquest;&half; just as the body<br/>does&iuml;&iquest;&half; and measuring the energy released. But cheesecake is a kind of<br/>perversion of that process. &quot;What we do with cheesecake is we start off<br/>with the fact that the brain is tickled by certain kinds of pleasure. We<br/>concentrate them, purify them, pack &apos;em together to give ourselves a big<br/>sensory wallop. We give ourselves pleasure by taking advantage of<br/>preexisting pleasure buttons.&quot;</p><p>Many parts of the brain participate in music making. Musical sounds are<br/>processed in the auditory cortex (yellow). Pathways then carry music to<br/>areas of the brain that perform (green), anticipate harmonic and melodic<br/>changes (pink), feel and remember (orange), and read (blue).<br/>Based on an illustration by Mark Jude Tramo, Science, Vol. 291, January 5,<br/>2001.<br/>By the same token, Pinker says, the pleasure we take in music has less to<br/>do with its adaptive value than with the value of the pleasure buttons it<br/>pushes. The words and rhythms in music take advantage of our propensity for<br/>language. The melodies in music may just be elaborations of the simple<br/>sounds we make to convey emotion&iuml;&iquest;&half; sighing, laughing, crying, and cooing. Or<br/>they may resemble natural sounds (rushing water, birdsong) that were<br/>important to human survival. &quot;We know that the auditory system of the brain<br/>has to make sense of all the sounds pouring into the ear at once,&quot; Pinker<br/>says. &quot;People listen hard to try to hear the animal call against the<br/>background of the rustling leaves and the other human voices. Maybe music<br/>gives you an artificial stimulus that&apos;s so easy to carve into components<br/>that the brain thinks, &apos;Aha! I really understand what&apos;s going on in the<br/>world.&apos; Or maybe it&apos;s a combination of all of those.&quot;</p><p>Pinker agrees that lullabies could be adaptive: They may reinforce certain<br/>natural soothing sounds that send a signal to relax. But he has<br/>reservations. &quot;If all music were mothers singing to babies, I would accept<br/>that theory,&quot; he says. &quot;But that&apos;s a fraction of all music. And it doesn&apos;t<br/>explain why a 17-year-old listens to heavy metal.&quot;</p><p>Not surprisingly, Pinker&apos;s views have made him something of a whipping boy<br/>in certain musicological circles. At a recent conference on the biological<br/>foundations of music at Rockefeller University in New York City, speaker<br/>after speaker rose to denounce the analysis in Pinker&apos;s most recent book,<br/>How the Mind Works. Pinker has long championed the evolutionary roots of<br/>language, Trehub says, although &quot;we don&apos;t have any more evidence that links<br/>language in any direct way to survival; all we have is the belief that it&apos;s<br/>likely to promote survival.&quot; Definitive proof will always be elusive, she<br/>says; yet the evidence for music as a survival tool is all around us. &quot;When<br/>you have something that&apos;s in every possible culture and in every historical<br/>period, you have to ask yourself: Why? If it&apos;s an accident, why did this<br/>accident happen everywhere?&quot;</p><p>Even if music isn&apos;t rooted in evolution, there is something about its sheer<br/>power to heal and revive the human spirit that seems to set it apart from<br/>other arts. In one of his scholarly studies on music and the brain,<br/>neurologist Oliver Sacks noted that the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche<br/>continued to improvise at the piano long after he had been rendered mute,<br/>demented, and partially paralyzed by tertiary syphilis. Sacks has also<br/>testified to the uncanny gift that music has for drawing people out of<br/>comas and catatonic states.</p><p>No place better demonstrates this power than New York&apos;s Beth Abraham health<br/>center in the Bronx, home to the Institute for Music and Neurologic<br/>Function. Here, twice a week, music therapist David Ramsey plays host to<br/>stroke patients who can no longer speak. But they can sing.</p><p>One Wednesday morning in the middle of winter, Bertha, a 67-year-old<br/>patient with thick glasses and thinning gray hair, sits silently in a<br/>wheelchair with a yellow blanket over her knees. Ramsey, a sprightly man of<br/>seemingly infinite patience, strides in and says hello. Bertha only smiles<br/>faintly: A left-hemisphere stroke has left her all but paralyzed. Beside<br/>her sits Keith, a Nigerian-born former university professor in his fifties<br/>who until recently refused to leave his room. When Ramsey greeted him,<br/>Keith tried to respond, but his words were slurred and indistinct. He, too,<br/>has suffered a left-brain stroke.</p><p>&quot;Music: companion of joy, balm for sorrow,&quot; wrote the painter Vermeer. At<br/>Beth Abraham in the Bronx, the balm of music therapy coaxes even stroke<br/>victims like these to sing.<br/>There&apos;s a sadness to the scene that is all too familiar, one that&apos;s<br/>repeated every day in hospital rooms and nursing home corridors across the<br/>country. But when Ramsey picks up his guitar, the room transforms. &quot;Hello.<br/>How are you today,&quot; Keith and Bertha sing, as the first three chords ring<br/>out. Their voices are quavering and tentative at first but seem to gather<br/>strength with every measure. &quot;I am feeling fine, thank you. It&apos;s good to<br/>see you again.&quot; Soon they&apos;ve launched into a repertoire of familiar tunes<br/>with a gusto that seems to belie the miserable weather outside. &quot;O what a<br/>beautiful morning! O what a beautiful day!&quot; Over on a bench along the wall,<br/>two bearded visiting professors and a shy young student pick up maracas and<br/>start to sing along: &quot;You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me<br/>happy when skies are gray.&quot;</p><p>Watching them sing&iuml;&iquest;&half; this man and woman so recently incapable of speech&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>it&apos;s hard not to believe there&apos;s something in music that runs deeper than<br/>speech, something that reaches places mere language can&apos;t get to. &quot;The<br/>patients, as soon as they see that they can sing, that they can<br/>communicate, they break into tears,&quot; says Renato Rozental, a neuroscientist<br/>at New York City&apos;s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. &quot;How is music doing<br/>this? I personally don&apos;t know.&quot;</p><p>Rozental plans to use MRIs to study precisely what goes on in these<br/>patients&apos; brains. It&apos;s believed that healthy areas of the brain compensate<br/>for injured parts, enabling the patients to sing. But he knows his work<br/>will offer only crude answers. &quot;There are a lot of myths and dreams about<br/>music,&quot; he says. &quot;The point is that it works.&quot; And here even Pinker is<br/>willing to concede: &quot;I suspect that music still is a mystery, and we<br/>shouldn&apos;t fool ourselves into thinking that we understand it. I think it<br/>genuinely is an unsolved problem, which is all the more reason not to<br/>accept glib explanations without making sure they really cut the mustard,<br/>in terms of science.&quot;</p><p>Animal Music<br/>The Thai Elephant Orchestra recently issued its debut CD. Played on<br/>traditional Thai instruments&iuml;&iquest;&half; slit drums, gongs, and large xylophonelike<br/>renats&iuml;&iquest;&half; the elephants&apos; symphony, which is accompanied by the animals&apos;<br/>haunting calls, sounds a little like the clatter of church bells ringing.<br/>The question is obvious: Are the elephants making music, or is it just<br/>noise? One can&apos;t tell for sure, yet many animals sing songs with patterns<br/>remarkably similar to those found in human music.</p><p>The sounds made by humpback whales, for instance, follow a familiar human<br/>form: a statement of theme, an embellishment, and then a return to a<br/>slightly modified version of the original theme. The intervals between<br/>notes resemble those found in human musical scales, and humpback songs<br/>contain repeated, rhyming refrains.</p><p>Birds use a plethora of well-known musical forms. The canyon wren&apos;s trill<br/>cascades down the musical scale just like the opening of Chopin&apos;s<br/>&quot;Revolutionary&quot; &iuml;&iquest;&half;tude. The songs of the wood thrush accurately follow the<br/>traditional Western musical scale. Male palm cockatoos in northern<br/>Australia court females by using twigs shaped into drumsticks to bang on<br/>hollow logs.</p><p>Such evidence suggests that humans did not invent music: It may predate us<br/>by tens of millions of years, and it may stimulate deep, primitive parts of<br/>the brain&iuml;&iquest;&half; the source, perhaps, of its deep, emotional pull. &quot;Sound<br/>production has been part of animal repertoires forever and ever,&quot; says<br/>Jelle Atema, a flute-playing marine biologist who studies animal signaling<br/>at the Boston University Marine Program. &quot;If that represents music for<br/>those animals, then we are the latecomers.&quot;</p></div>
