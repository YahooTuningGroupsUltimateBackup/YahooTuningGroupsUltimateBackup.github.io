Sagittal would convey the actual intervals who those<br/>&gt;   you might want to give a hearing and compositional aid to a<br/>&gt;   recording. Also since we don&apos;t have allot of examples of Sagittal<br/>&gt;   in the wild,it might brings things to light that can&apos;t be as<br/>&gt;   apparent by just going through what people think they might need.</p><p>Certainly I agree that Sagittal should be better understood the more<br/>it is used for a variety of musics. My first reflection on an approach<br/>for this piece might be to see if there is a Sagittal convention for<br/>288-EDO, since I could approximate Zest-24 and this seven-note subset<br/>of it quite accurately in that -- although a JI approach is of<br/>interest also.</p><p>&gt;   Good music seems to be able to survive different changes of<br/>&gt;   timbre. Sometimes some group comes together plays something not<br/>&gt;   written specifically for what they have and it works amazing well.</p><p>Here I much agree, and Jon L. Smith&apos;s arrangement of my piece is a<br/>nice example:</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music">http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music</a>&gt;</p><p>The interesting question is whether an ensemble might tend to adjust<br/>tuning somewhat to fit timbre, as well as vice versa. For example,<br/>here&apos;s the scale for my piece in the original region, with pardon<br/>begged for any inconsistencies in rounding the cents:</p><p>      Bb    C   C*    Eb     F    G   G*     Bb<br/>      0    204 254    492   708  900 950    1200<br/>        204   50   237   217  192  50    250</p><p>Here the small minor third and seventh are represented by intervals of<br/>about 254 cents (~22:19) and 950 cents (~26:15, for example), and we<br/>get a kind of soft diatonic with steps of 237 and 250 cents.</p><p>This is the tuning in which I composed my original version, and the<br/>timbre is somewhat mellow, as Jacky Ligon put it, so that Bb-C* at 254<br/>cents and F-G* at 242 cents will sound as imperfectly concordant minor<br/>thirds in some resolutions for three or four voices, playing somewhat<br/>the same role as the simpler 7:6 at 267 cents. Even more delicate is a<br/>sonority Eb-G*-Bb-C* at 0-458-708-963 cents. That 458-cent interval is<br/>very exciting, and I wanted to have the sonority radiant and thrilling<br/>but not too clashing.</p><p>However, other styles of tuning are possible -- in Zest-24, or by<br/>flexible pitch performers who obviously aren&apos;t going exactly to follow<br/>any fixed temperament. For example:</p><p>      Bb    C   Db    Eb     F    G   Ab     Bb<br/>      0    204 275    492   708  900 983   1200<br/>        204   71   237   217  192  83   250</p><p>In this version, Eb-Ab becomes a usual 492-cent fourth (close to<br/>85:64, if one wants a harmonic JI equivalent), so that Eb-Ab-Bb-Db at<br/>0-492-708-983 cents isn&apos;t too far from conventional 20th-century<br/>quintal/quartal harmony with a septimal cast because of the narrower<br/>983-cent minor seventh and upper 275-cent minor third by comparison<br/>with a simple 18:24:27:32 (0-498-702-996 cents).</p><p>If singers are going for the simplest ratios that fit the general<br/>style, however, then we might get something like this transposition:</p><p>      Eb    F   F*    Ab     Bb    C   C*     Eb<br/>      0    217 267    492   708  913  963   1200<br/>        217  50   225    217   204  50   237</p><p>Now Ab-C* is an almost just 21:16, with Ab-C*-Eb-F* at 0-471-708-975<br/>cents rather close to a just 16:21:24:28, which should be pleasing in<br/>a variety timbres. At this point, we might ask why flexible-pitch<br/>performers might not approximate a simple JI version:</p><p>     1/1   9/8  7/6    4/3    3/2   27/16  7/4     2/1<br/>      0    204  267    498    702    906   969    1200<br/>        9:8 28:27  8:7    9:8    9:8   28:27   8:7<br/>        204  63    231    204    204    63     231</p><p>Of course, I find a special charm in the version with intervals like<br/>250, 242, and 458 cents -- but this doesn&apos;t mean that the piece can&apos;t<br/>be performed with a range of intonations, and that in some textures a<br/>septimal tuning based on pure or near-pure rations of 2-3-7 might not<br/>be the ideal choice to get across something like the originally<br/>intended effect.</p><p>&gt;   This helps getting further ideas and opportunities of areas to<br/>&gt;   explore if your music fits nicely for it in some unexpected way.<br/>&gt;   and there is no reason that a piece might not enjoy a life<br/>&gt;   appearing in varied instrumentation, like a multi faced jewel.  it<br/>&gt;   is like a plant that can grow in more varied soil. and as you<br/>&gt;   mention there is a long standing tradition of it.</p><p>Yes, and starting to conclude that the alphabetical notation, for<br/>something like it, might have the right mixture of specificity (&quot;here<br/>are the steps in cents as I perform the piece on synthesizer) and<br/>generality (&quot;here are the notes in alphabetical notation -- while I<br/>tune the small minor third F-G* at 242 cents, it could be F-Ab at 275<br/>cents or Eb-F* at a virtually just 7:6 or 267 cents, or whatever might<br/>best fit a given timbral situationn&quot;).</p><p>In the late 16th century, it was taken for granted at least in some<br/>circles that a madrigal would have one style of intonation (at or<br/>close to 5-limit JI) for voices, another (meantone) for keyboards, and<br/>another (12-EDO or close) if arranged to be played on a lute.</p><p>Of course, a lot of what you&apos;ve said could apply to a range of pieces;<br/>but I considered your remarks especially relevant to a piece like<br/>this.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
