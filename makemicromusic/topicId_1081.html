This was a small sample, meant to<br/>&gt; show some of things I&apos;m doing rather than how they could be done if my<br/>&gt; keyboard technique were more accurate and my familiarity more<br/>&gt; assured</p><p>Do we get to hear these? Perhaps I&apos;ve missed them.</p><p>&gt; There are other tunings that I want to get to, for example<br/>&gt; Sesquisexta, with two 12-note Pythagorean chains at a pure 7:6 apart.<br/>&gt; This has a keyboard layout like a lattice: play C-G on the lower<br/>&gt; keyboard and C-G on the upper keyboard at the same time, and you get a<br/>&gt; pure 12:14:18:21 (around 0-267-702-969 cents).</p><p>This sounds interesting. I&apos;ll be able to try these things out soon in FTS<br/>- with two keyboards and a 2 to 1 midi connection.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1089 href="#1089">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2001 11:05:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Great, I look forward to hearing your improvisations :-).</p><p>I can well understand a bit of inertia; I feel it&apos;s &quot;in the air&quot; as it were<br/>right now, a kind of listlessness, and great if there is some returning of<br/>things to normal.</p><p>I&apos;ve just realised, I can play in your 24 note<br/>dual manual scales by splitting the keyboard<br/>and playing one in left half and the other in the<br/>right half.</p><p>Just been trying out your two pyth. scales at interval<br/>of 7/6, and a lovely one it is too.</p><p>E.g.<br/>C C+ D+ E+ G F D C</p><p>where + = + 7/6</p><p>I&apos;ve added a little plainsong like improv in this to my<br/>tunes page, repeating it with elaborations; gradually<br/>moving into new regions.</p><p>No score though, so I suppose you won&apos;t be able to hear it.<br/>May try writing something in it at some time.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm#pyth_mod_7o6">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm#pyth_mod_7o6</a></p><p>.......For FTS users:...................</p><p>I&apos;ll add it to the FTS Midi In presets drop list to make<br/>it easy for FTS users to try it out, and also to make<br/>related maps consisting of two scales at an interval<br/>to each other by simply changing the scale and the interval<br/>of modulation.<br/>........................................</p><p>Robert</p></div>
