I just found you had some discussion about it, so perhaps I may briefly clarify its motivation.</p><p> &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Hudson Lacerda<br/> &gt; I&apos;m not against<br/> &gt; the use of algorithmic tools per se....only that I would feel rather<br/> &gt; dishonest using them to create a work, and then take credit for it<br/> &gt; myself.</p><p> I assume I do not really need to motivate algorithmic composition in general. Naturally, we can compose music fully &apos;by hand&apos;. Yet, a number of people prefer to delegate some subtasks of the composition process which can be formalised to some &apos;silicon assistant&apos; (any aesthetic decision still remains with the composer, e.g., she/he may edit the software or the result until satisfied -- its only a different way of working) There exists an impressive amount of systems which allow for such a way of working and many of these systems also support doing microtonal music (see <a href="http://www.flexatone.net/algoNet/">http://www.flexatone.net/algoNet/</a> for a list of systems).</p><p> A rich set of algorithmic composition strategies have been proposed and successfully applied. However, these strategies are often rather procedural. Strasheela proposes a considerably more declarative way based on the notion of compositional rules.</p><p> Compositional rules are well suited to describe music, because rules allow to describe the multi-dimensional nature of music in a modular way. When the task description is broken down into rhythmic rules, melodic rules, rules on the harmony etc. then the various musical dimensions are formalised one by one. A rule-based approach is particularly adequate to address the complexity required to model pitch structures -- including microtonal music.</p><p> Technically, Strasheela employs constraint programming to implement compositional rules. A number of constraint-based composition systems have been proposed already. Compared with existing systems, Strasheela is particular generic -- see <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/strasheela/doc/StrasheelaMotivation/index.html">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/strasheela/doc/StrasheelaMotivation/index.html</a> for a discussion of this aspect.</p><p> &gt; Boy, I sure as hell wished they would have burned some audio files. I find it<br/> &gt; impossible to judge the _musical_ results of their algorithms without actually<br/> &gt; listening to them!</p><p> I know what you mean. The thing is that the musical output depends largely on the user: the system outputs music according to the music theory (i.e. musical constraint satisfaction problem) defined by the user. I provided standard examples like Fuxian counterpoint: you may look into the Fux textbook to see what kind of results that produces.</p><p> Strasheela by itself hardly predefines anything. Its design goal is (i) to facilitate the definition of music theories and (ii) to create music according to user defined theories reasonably efficient (by making the search process adaptable to the theory).</p><p> &gt; This looks like it might be fun, but if it ain&apos;t got<br/> &gt; a GUI, I don&apos;t have time to play with it.</p><p> I know that the biggest obstacle to start with Strasheela is its user interface, the Oz programming language. There are several reasons why I have chosen Oz. Strasheela aims to be highly generic and therefore offers a programming language as user interface. The language is textual, because I am convinced such a language scales up better for complex music theories. For example, I believe that a logical formula such as the following implication example</p><p>       isSimultaneous(Note1, Note2) =&gt; isConsonant(Note1, Note2)</p><p> is expressed more concisely in a textual way than in a  visual language. I am most interested though, if you can convince me otherwise (see <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/vpl.html">http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/vpl.html</a> for a bibliography of research on visual programming languages, including logic and constraint languages).</p><p> There exist a considerably number of constraint systems, but Oz belongs to the state-of-the-art. Its programmability of the search process (i.e. what decisions are done during the search process and in which order) has proven to be essential for efficiently solving complex composition tasks. Besides, Oz/Mozart is free (open source) and platform independent -- unlike competitors such as ECLiPSe or SICStus Prolog.</p><p> If I would start with developing Strasheela today, then I would possibly implement it in Lisp (still the lingua franca of algorithmic composition) together with the Gecode library  (<a href="http://www.gecode.org">www.gecode.org</a>) -- but Gecode wasn&apos;t around five years ago when I started with Strasheela and porting it now can not be done in a weekend ;-)</p><p> Thank you very much for your interest!</p><p> Best,<br/> Torsten</p><p> <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

It has built-in Tartini-Couper accidentals, and the user can create new accidentals (Sagittal notation can be used, for instance). Staves can have from 0 up to 9 lines, note-heads can be changed, etc. There is also abc2midi, which also allows to get microtonal MIDI files.
