Depending on the tuning system, the traditional counterpoint<br/>rules may apply only in a limited way or not at all - after all, there<br/>are other kinds of intervals, and those that appear in traditional<br/>counterpoint may not appear at all (there are no fifth parallels if<br/>there are no fifths!).<br/>I have seen quite some amount of melodic and harmonic theory for<br/>generalized tunings - I wonder if there is something like a<br/>generalized counterpoint theory? Maybe in the spirit of Paul&apos;s<br/>decatonic scales or so?<br/>Well, maybe this belongs more into tuning or tuning-math.

Use them in the way that<br/>traditional counterpoint texts tell you to use 3rds and 6ths, etc. Avoid<br/>parallel octaves and parallel things that *function* like 5ths. The<br/>principles of good voice leading are likewise pretty general, not really<br/>dependent on the tuning per se.</p><p>Basically I think there isn&apos;t any *need* for a &quot;generalized counterpoint<br/>theory&quot; because the principles underlying the picky rules about certain<br/>intervals given in some texts are already general enough.</p><p>For a fugue, which is basically focussed on what you do at the voice<br/>entries, pick related interval that functions something like a 5th.</p><p>&gt; Well, maybe this belongs more into tuning or tuning-math.

Depending on the tuning system, the traditional<br/>counterpoint<br/>&gt; rules may apply only in a limited way or not at all - after all,<br/>there<br/>&gt; are other kinds of intervals, and those that appear in traditional<br/>&gt; counterpoint may not appear at all (there are no fifth parallels if<br/>&gt; there are no fifths!).<br/>&gt; I have seen quite some amount of melodic and harmonic theory for<br/>&gt; generalized tunings - I wonder if there is something like a<br/>&gt; generalized counterpoint theory? Maybe in the spirit of Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt; decatonic scales or so?<br/>&gt; Well, maybe this belongs more into tuning or tuning-math. I already<br/>&gt; looked there, but did not find much til now.<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Hans Straub<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.datacomm.ch/straub">http://home.datacomm.ch/straub</a></p><p>***It seems like there would be general principles for this, but I&apos;m<br/>not sure they could be codified.  For example, even repetition in a<br/>non ET would cause different intervals at different pitch levels.</p><p>So one would rely on the old compositional standards, such as ideas<br/>of unity, variety, and that vague term &quot;interest...&quot;</p><p>However, in any given non-12 tuning system, I&apos;m sure a lot could be<br/>said on this topic in a theory course, and it would be an interesting<br/>one...</p><p>J.
