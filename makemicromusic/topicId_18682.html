If the 5th is taken to be 700cents<br/>then the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; multiples are 2x2x5x5x7=700cents which can produce some<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   From Robert.

So far<br/>&gt; your posts, Robert, have nothing in common with her approach.<br/>&gt; She used an algorithm to find the best non-octave divisions<br/>&gt; in terms of approximations to JI.

There are certainly lots of different ways of understanding and using a scale like the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma scales. I gave a bit of my own interpretation when I represented these scales as early representatives of the &quot;rank one temperament&quot; group. But the best way to evaluate a scale or a tuning is to make music with it. Otherwise it&apos;s just a list of numbers. Whatever pleases the ear, as Debussy is quoted as having said. :-)</p><p>Unfortunately, my only example of Carlos Alpha music that I&apos;ve written is an early version of what ended up as Mizarian Porcupine Overture. The unfortunate thing about this is that I only have it in RealAudio format. (At the time the RealAudio player wasn&apos;t as annoying as it turned out to be later on.)</p><p>ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/hmiller/ra-archive/alpha.ra</p></div>
