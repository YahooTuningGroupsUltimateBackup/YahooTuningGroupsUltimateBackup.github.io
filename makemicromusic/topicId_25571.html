You are a<br/>demigod for &apos;Diving I&apos; alone, if you do nothing else before you die that<br/>makes you nearly immortal..... :)</p><p>Anyway, I think this is a hard question to answer, short of getting the<br/>right kind of setup and exploring things until something feels right.<br/>And---sometimes something will feel wrong and then someone somewhere will do<br/>something in the tuning you thought was useless and you will be inspired to<br/>give it another try. The opposite happens, too.</p><p>These things are also tied to the type of sounds one employs; not every<br/>tuning is equally suited to every timbre. I find the more dissonant tunings<br/>(e.g. 11-edo) benefit from either really pure sounds without a lot of<br/>spectral content, or inharmonic timbres of some sort (esp. ones that can<br/>match properties of the tuning in question---see Bill Sethares&apos;s work here)</p><p>Coming from JI or more traditional harmonic thinking, one path might be to<br/>explore 19-edo and 17-edo first (I did this, plus things like 31- and<br/>53-edo), and then branch off into more exotic territories (23-edo, 16-edo,<br/>etc.). Then you have midway points of interest like 22-edo. And, you have<br/>the basic &apos;almost anything vertical sounds exotic and good&apos; systems where<br/>you can explore rather devil-may-care counterpoint, like 7-edo and 5-edo.<br/>Some find 5-edo too boring, though, YMMV.</p><p>The MOS paradigm of large and small step sizes, and their ratios, is a<br/>helpful, and delightful thing to explore. In particular, if you want<br/>something spicy and exotic, look no further than turning Western music on<br/>it&apos;s head with an &apos;anti diatonic&apos; scale: instead of LLsLLLs, you have<br/>ssLsssL --- some EDOs that do this would be 9-, 16- and 23-edo. Very cool<br/>sounds, and very fresh to the ears, but with a familiar logic.</p><p>This of course leaves out the discussion of non-equal linear temperaments,<br/>various rational systems, non-octave systems, harmonics and subharmonics,<br/>etc. The universe is really really really large, and life is short. I find<br/>it best to stick to things that I can intuit quite well, and try to master<br/>them with the time I&apos;m given. So I mostly gravitate to 19- and 17-edo, and<br/>EDOs in general I find are nice closed systems that are manageable and can<br/>transpose without a hassle. There&apos;s enough there for several lifetimes of<br/>music making in the two I mentioned. 31 is a pretty darned good tuning, too,<br/>a kind of &apos;can do almost anything&apos; system.</p><p>Check out the xenharmonic wiki to start some of your exploring.</p><p>Best,<br/>AKJ</p><p>On Thu, Feb 10, 2011 at 12:32 AM, thorin kerr &lt;thorin.kerr@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi all.

I ended up hating all of them, for one reason or another, and finally found my niche in the realm of the EDOs that most self-respecting microtonalists don&apos;t touch with a 10-foot pole.  I know that it&apos;s really easy to get caught up when you see a lot of really smart and experienced people raving about the merits of this or that tuning, and to ignore the voices of the &quot;radicals&quot;.  Even if you hear music that you really like in a particular tuning, it&apos;s no guarantee that you&apos;ll be able to mesh with it.  Be prepared to waste a LOT of time (and perhaps money, especially if you&apos;re a guitar player) just goofing around.  What worked really well for me was systematic exploration of EDOs--especially those that I did NOT want to explore, because those turned out to become favorites.  Never trust numbers nor the generalizations on which theories are usually based, unless you have the luxury of verifying them with music.</p><p>Me personally, I like fixed scales at this point in my musical development, because I don&apos;t know how to choose &quot;whatever intervals I want&quot;.  Creating unique new musical structures is too demanding and confusing for me.  I need limits to work within.  I like scales that force my hand in directions I wouldn&apos;t ordinarily know how to conceive.  Taking &quot;good&quot; intervals out of my vocabulary proved to be the best way to do this for me.</p><p>HTH,</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, thorin kerr &lt;thorin.kerr@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all.

However,<br/>Michael, since you keep bringing up 17, I&apos;ll say that I agree that 17 is<br/>great, but it depends on what you&apos;re looking for. It&apos;s not strong in the 5/4<br/>dept., but as you know it&apos;s good for neutral 3rds and 2nds (and thus neutral<br/>6ths and 7ths), which are interesting animals. In addition, the 7th is very<br/>close to 23/13, which is a mediant between 16/9 and 7/4, so that might come<br/>in handy to some. Good for a neo-Medieval harmonic vocabulary, or a harmonic<br/>vocabulary that uses a lot of quartal chords. Also, the 11-ish tinge has<br/>been mentioned. 17 can also be used succesfully in a monodic fashion for<br/>middle-Eastern flavors.</p><p>19 might be a safer bet for those who want all the traditional comforts of<br/>home along with new resources like the true augmented second at 4 steps<br/>(along with 15 steps, its inverse), which is for me a key fun feature of 19.<br/>Even 19 fifths from a chain of a larger meantone system like 31 or 50 is<br/>useful for similar properties but slightly different shadings of emotional<br/>color.</p><p> --<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>On Thu, Feb 10, 2011 at 1:12 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;   My current question STILL is why can&apos;t 17EDO be a tuning we all agree to<br/>&gt; push as an &quot;intro to microtonality&quot; tuning?

So<br/>for example, I like Aaron&apos;s suggestion of playing with step sizes. Not<br/>because it bares resemblance to the way traditional 12EDO is done, but<br/>because it&apos;s a system which offers some sort of coherency.</p><p>I like Michaels suggestion of irregular temparaments. That seems really<br/>progresive to me, offering lots of freedom... but I can also image it&apos;s<br/>pretty hard to get it right. For example, will my &apos;irregular temperament&apos;<br/>allow me to transpose and modulate with all (or another set) of intervals<br/>that I like? or... if my dyads sound good, will my triads sound good too?<br/>Maybe... I&apos;ll bet this path is hugely rewarding, but probably takes a huge<br/>amount of work to get right.</p><p>At the same time, as Igliashon points out, I can appreciate that letting the<br/>constraints of, say an EDO, guiding your choices could be both liberating<br/>and quite practical. As Sartre said: &quot;Constraint has no hold on freedom&quot;.</p><p>And then Neil points out, there&apos;s &apos;moods&apos; to consider. hmmm.... true.... and<br/>&apos;coherent systems&apos; aren&apos;t the only thing that makes good music.</p><p>Gene is correct, I do need to ask these questions of myself.

Some EDOs just don&apos;t do the &quot;quasi-standard&quot; thing at all.  11-EDO, for instance--you have to tune it in alternating 545-cent and 436-cent intervals, which gets confusing, and in 9-EDO you need a few 533-cent intervals and a few 400-cent ones, because if you do four of the 533-cent intervals, you end up needing a subminor 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd strings, and the string tension is really wacky.  16-EDO you have to put a minor 3rd between the 3rd and 2nd strings instead of a major 3rd, so scales go all cross-eyed when you get to that point.  In 14-EDO and 19-EDO, you can&apos;t play a subminor barre chord with a root on the 6th string, which is really annoying.  In 18-EDO it&apos;s really hard to play the most consonant chords, because they need to be played in close position and that&apos;s really hard to do in either of the quasi-standard tunings.  In 13-EDO, you have to tune four 462-cent intervals and then one 553-cent interval between the 2nd and 3rd strings, which is sort of a &quot;backwards&quot; standard tuning and everything on the 2nd string plays a fret lower instead of a fret higher (that gets confusing really quickly).  17-EDO is dead-simple and works just like 12 (more or less), and 15-EDO is simpler still because 5 of the flat 480-cent fourths spans two octaves exactly, so it&apos;s the same interval between any pair of adjacent strings.  In 19-EDO it gets a little confusing remembering that a semitone is two steps instead of one, so scale shapes seem a little strange at first.  In 20-EDO things are starting to get crowded and barre chords stop working.  21-EDO I have no idea because I&apos;ve never tried it or really thought about it at all, it&apos;s the one EDO in this range that&apos;s never caught my fancy.  22-EDO you can actually still sorta play barre chords, and the diatonic scale still makes sense--but other scales are a bit confusing, especially the Pajara decatonics.  23-EDO works just like 13 or 16 (depending on which standard tuning you adopt, the one based on flat fourths or the one based on sharp ones) but chords are weird and scales get confusing.  24-EDO is easy again, because you just tune to 12-EDO standard (although weirder tunings are possible, you can tune it to 8-EDO standard as well).  25-EDO tunes just like 15 and 20, but you can also tune it like 16 if you&apos;re into the whole &quot;anti-diatonic&quot; thing.  26-EDO can be tuned like 13 or 19, and 27-EDO is probably best tuned like 22 (i.e. exaggerated Pythagorean with flat 4ths and a sharp major 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd strings).  28--no idea, another one that hasn&apos;t struck my fancy.  29 is another pythagorean one, works like 12-EDO or 17-EDO but is pretty crowded.  30 works like 25--you can tune it in all flat 4ths or like 16 using the sharp 520-cent 4ths, but it&apos;s crowded as f***.  31-EDO is another diatonic-like tuning, much like 19, but forget about barre chords, though honestly 31&apos;s less challenging than smaller EDOs; you can also tune it like 13-EDO with flat fourths and one approximate 11/8, but why would you do that?

Some EDOs just don&apos;t do the &quot;quasi-standard&quot; thing at all.  11-EDO, for instance--you have to tune it in alternating 545-cent and 436-cent intervals, which gets confusing, and in 9-EDO you need a few 533-cent intervals and a few 400-cent ones, because if you do four of the 533-cent intervals, you end up needing a subminor 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd strings, and the string tension is really wacky.  16-EDO you have to put a minor 3rd between the 3rd and 2nd strings instead of a major 3rd, so scales go all cross-eyed when you get to that point.  In 14-EDO and 19-EDO, you can&apos;t play a subminor barre chord with a root on the 6th string, which is really annoying.  In 18-EDO it&apos;s really hard to play the most consonant chords, because they need to be played in close position and that&apos;s really hard to do in either of the quasi-standard tunings.  In 13-EDO, you have to tune four 462-cent intervals and then one 553-cent interval between the 2nd and 3rd strings, which is sort of a &quot;backwards&quot; standard tuning and everything on the 2nd string plays a fret lower instead of a fret higher (that gets confusing really quickly).  17-EDO is dead-simple and works just like 12 (more or less), and 15-EDO is simpler still because 5 of the flat 480-cent fourths spans two octaves exactly, so it&apos;s the same interval between any pair of adjacent strings.  In 19-EDO it gets a little confusing remembering that a semitone is two steps instead of one, so scale shapes seem a little strange at first.  In 20-EDO things are starting to get crowded and barre chords stop working.  21-EDO I have no idea because I&apos;ve never tried it or really thought about it at all, it&apos;s the one EDO in this range that&apos;s never caught my fancy.  22-EDO you can actually still sorta play barre chords, and the diatonic scale still makes sense--but other scales are a bit confusing, especially the Pajara decatonics.  23-EDO works just like 13 or 16 (depending on which standard tuning you adopt, the one based on flat fourths or the one based on sharp ones) but chords are weird and scales get confusing.  24-EDO is easy again, because you just tune to 12-EDO standard (although weirder tunings are possible, you can tune it to 8-EDO standard as well).  25-EDO tunes just like 15 and 20, but you can also tune it like 16 if you&apos;re into the whole &quot;anti-diatonic&quot; thing.  26-EDO can be tuned like 13 or 19, and 27-EDO is probably best tuned like 22 (i.e. exaggerated Pythagorean with flat 4ths and a sharp major 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd strings).  28--no idea, another one that hasn&apos;t struck my fancy.  29 is another pythagorean one, works like 12-EDO or 17-EDO but is pretty crowded.  30 works like 25--you can tune it in all flat 4ths or like 16 using the sharp 520-cent 4ths, but it&apos;s crowded as f***.  31-EDO is another diatonic-like tuning, much like 19, but forget about barre chords, though honestly 31&apos;s less challenging than smaller EDOs; you can also tune it like 13-EDO with flat fourths and one approximate 11/8, but why would you do that?

The Just major third, I agree, certainly does not sound like the supramajor third of 17- in fact, you can use<br/>those two intervals, or roughly those two intervals, in a single scale<br/>and they sound like distinct intervals.
