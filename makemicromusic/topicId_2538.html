Lack of $$, knowledge, and then parenthood slowed<br/>the efforts.  Finally, last year I had saved enough money to get some<br/>decent gear.</p><p>I began alone playing with the equipment to find a big water-tower-<br/>like space (using Echoplex, TC Electronic M-1 reverb, Mackie mixer<br/>and a nicer mic) and projected the sound into our living room.  After<br/>several sessions learning to work with the mixer, program new reverb<br/>settings in M-1, and looping the &apos;Plex (I had never worked with<br/>electronics before - spoiled by the &quot;pure&quot; acoustics of our first<br/>studio - the water tower) some magic began to flow as I relaxed and<br/>got more comfortable with the tools.  I didn&apos;t record during sessions<br/>until something sounded particularly interesting.  Then I just turned<br/>on the DAT - after about 9 months of this process I had about a dozen<br/>or so promising pieces.  &quot;Godspace&quot; is made up of just three long<br/>ones (whole CD is just under 74 mins) and it&apos;s simply looped<br/>and &apos;verbed voices recorded in one take - much of it incorporates<br/>harmonic overtone singing and some of it contains<br/>other &quot;experimental&quot; vocal production that&apos;s hard (for me) to<br/>describe.  There&apos;s no post production EQ&apos;ing or processing and we<br/>pretty much mastered it with the fade in&apos;s and out&apos;s that happened at<br/>the moment of their creation (except one fade in).</p><p>...Thanks for offering me the floor Jon, and again for the<br/>encouraging comments!</p><p>BTW, this set up is what we Spectral Voices are using for practices,<br/>recording and performances now too, and it&apos;s much more practical to<br/>go into a venue and be able to sculpt the space into each particular<br/>space we sing in rather than try to hold a concert in an abandoned<br/>water tower! :)</p></div><h3>thejimcole &#x3C;jimcole@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2002 8:36:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;I went out an listened to the clips<br/>&gt; yesterday, and found them to be at your usual level of beauty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This one has a different sound to it somehow. Really like it.</p><p>Thanks Jacky!  I guess it is somehow a different sound - different<br/>space, different time.  Hoping we Spectral Voices will develop an<br/>album this year with that set up.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW - What is &quot;microtonality&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;  )</p><p>Ha Ha!  That&apos;s a good one - and a good one to keep asking as we go<br/>on :-)</p><p>&gt; Seriously - a &quot;developed theoretical approach&quot; is not near as<br/>&gt; important as being able to make beautiful music that will endure<br/>&gt; repeated listening. In this regard, you are very highly developed<br/>in<br/>&gt; the most important area IMHO.</p><p>Jacky, your support and enthusiasm for our music is dear to me - Wow,<br/>thanks man!!</p><p>&gt; Your music is perfection to me. Love all I&apos;ve been privileged to<br/>hear.</p><p>...as is yours to me.  Music, and music-making, is an overwhelmingly<br/>wonderful thing/experience/process.  Much appreciate the kind<br/>reverberations!!!</p><p>Thank you Jacky and Jon again - when I&apos;m having a bad day I know<br/>where to come  back to for support and encouragement :-)</p><p>~Jim</p></div>
