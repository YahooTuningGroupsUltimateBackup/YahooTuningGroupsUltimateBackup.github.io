It&apos;s a<br/>rounded 0-709-982-1418 cents (with 4:6:7:9 at ~0-702-969-1404 cents).</p><p>In this resolution, it progresses to an approximation of 1:2:3 --<br/>how&apos;s that for &quot;intonational basics&quot; -- a neat and spacious sonority<br/>of octave, twelfth, and upper fourth (0-1200-1909 cents).</p><p>A neat thing about this cadence is how it actually combines two more<br/>familiar three-voice cadences in one:</p><p>           B4  C5         B4  C5<br/>           G4  F4         E4  F4<br/>           E4  F4         A3  F3</p><p>First cadence:  &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei004.mid</a>&gt;<br/>Second cadence: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei005.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei005.mid</a>&gt;<br/>Both at once again: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei003.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>The first cadence, in 22-tET, has a near-6:7:9 sonority resolving to a<br/>fifth in the usual manner for this kind of style: the minor third<br/>contracts to a unison, and the near-Just 22-tET major third (almost a<br/>pure 9:7) expands very nicely to a fifth.</p><p>The second cadence has a very beautiful near-4:6:9 sonority -- a major<br/>ninth &quot;divided&quot; into two fifths, pleasing in lots of tunings -- with<br/>the outer ninth expanding to that roomy twelfth.</p><p>Anyway, 22-tET is a scale very rich with creative ideas, and having<br/>first tried your 4:6:7:9 in this scale (where you recommended it), I&apos;m<br/>using it and assorted variations in a range of tunings.</p><p>                         *       *      *</p><p>Now for the &quot;something old,&quot; but also, at least in my view, very new<br/>as well as xenharmonic, and most deserving of a hearing and lots of<br/>use in this 21st century.</p><p>In 1618, Fabio Colonna published what I consider one of the hottest<br/>musical figures of all time: a &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; in &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>or &quot;fifthtone&quot; steps which he played on his 31-note keyboard, likely<br/>tuned in a meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds -- and a 31-tET guitar<br/>should do very nicely, if someone can work out the tab, so to speak,<br/>not to mention a 31-tone organ a la Vicentino/Fokker.</p><p>This example features a sixth sonority, and actually moves through no<br/>fewer than _four_ flavors of sixths before resolving this interval<br/>between the outer voices to the octave. Here it is, with my notation<br/>for the curious using an asterisk (*) to show a note raised by a<br/>diesis or fifthtone:</p><p>            C5   C*5  C#5  Db5  D5<br/>            G4   G4   G4   G4   A4<br/>            E4   E4   E4   E4   F#4<br/>            E3   E3   E3   E3   D3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmfc001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmfc001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Colonna calls this a &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; through &quot;three enharmonic<br/>steps.&quot; Vertically, we start with a usual minor sixth or thirteenth<br/>E3-C5, move to what Vicentino in 1555 calls a &quot;proximate minor sixth&quot;<br/>(or in 20th-century terms a neutral sixth) of E3-C*5, then to a usual<br/>major sixth E3-C#5, and finally to Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate major sixth&quot;<br/>or diminished seventh E3-Db5 (Dave Keenan and others call this a<br/>&quot;supermajor sixth,&quot; a fitting name in this kind of style).</p><p>In 31-tET, those &quot;enharmonic steps&quot; (C5-C*5-C#5-Db5) are each 1/31<br/>octave (~38.71 cents); in 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 thirds,<br/>they&apos;re very slightly unequal, at ~41.06 cents (128:125) and ~34.99<br/>cents, with the locations of these two sizes depending on the choice<br/>of a tuning chain.</p><p>By the way, I play this progression myself (actually a three-voice<br/>version easier to navigate) on a 24-note synthesizer in meantone (two<br/>12-note manuals a 128:125 diesis or fifthtone apart), where it&apos;s<br/>available in lots of positions; but with all 31 notes, you get full<br/>transposibility, as both Vicentino and Colonna observe.</p><p>Speaking of microtonality in action, I might add that Colonna&apos;s<br/>31-note instrument used a kind of &quot;generalized keyboard&quot; with five<br/>ranks of 7 notes each spaced a fifthtone apart, and with some notes<br/>replicated on more than one key.</p><p>In theory, as Monz and I have both noted, Colonna also discussed all<br/>kinds of complex integer ratios including some involving higher primes<br/>(e.g. 17:12). In practice, however, he went with something fairly<br/>straightforward, at least for his 31-note keyboard: take a usual<br/>meantone (likely with pure major thirds), and divide the octave into<br/>31 more or less equal parts. That&apos;s also Vicentino&apos;s approach, and<br/>both use it to make some very radical music.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;d say that in a classic 1/4-comma meantone or on a 31-tET<br/>guitar, this is one hot progression right out of the Neapolitan scene<br/>in 1618, and I hope it gives people lots of ideas.</p><p>Celebrating the new and the old, I wish the best to everyone here,<br/>including my &quot;comrades in numerology&quot; Jacky and Monz.</p><p>With peace, love, and harmony to all,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=31 href="#31">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 12:01:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_30.html#30">/makemicromusic/topicId_30.html#30</a></p><p>&gt; In 1618, Fabio Colonna published what I consider one of the<br/>&gt; hottest musical figures of all time: a &quot;sliding of the voice&quot;<br/>&gt; in &quot;enharmonic&quot; or &quot;fifthtone&quot; steps which he played on his<br/>&gt; 31-note keyboard, likely tuned in a meantone with pure 5:4<br/>&gt; major thirds -- &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; This example features a sixth sonority, and actually moves<br/>&gt; through no fewer than _four_ flavors of sixths before resolving<br/>&gt; this interval between the outer voices to the octave.

I&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; enter that into FTS and use it for voice training.</p><p>Hi Mary,</p><p>About a week ago on one of the lists there was a bit of debate<br/>over the usefulness of MIDI-files for audio examples.</p><p>As I use MIDI a lot I&apos;m well aware of its limitations.  But<br/>one really big advantage it has in a situation such as this<br/>is that it allows one to examine the tuning of the audio<br/>example, because it&apos;s a simple matter to open the MIDI-file<br/>in any sequencer and look at the event list, which shows<br/>all the pitch-bends.  And the more-or-less standard use of<br/>Cawapus (4096 per Semitone) for pitch-bend gives sufficiently<br/>fine resolution to figure out to a fraction of a cent what<br/>the tuning is.</p><p>So I performed surgery on Margo&apos;s file of the Colonna example,<br/>and am here presenting several different versions of it.</p><p>Margo noted that her example was tuned by Scala in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone.  I could provide &quot;ratios&quot; for this, but they&apos;d<br/>be quite inconvenient-looking, so instead I simply notate<br/>the actual meantone values as units of the 1/4-comma meantone<br/>generator, which is (3/2) / ( (81/80)^(1/4) ).</p><p>Margo also noted that 31-EDO gives results very close to<br/>the 1/4-comma meantone.  I have included these as well.</p><p>Analysis of tuning of Margo Schulter&apos;s MIDI-file of<br/>Colonna &quot;fifth-tone&quot; example:</p><p>Cawapus (Cakewalk pitch-bend units, 4096 per Semitone):</p><p>C5 0      C5 +1682   C#5 -981  Db5 +701  D5  -280<br/>G4 -140   G4 -140    G4  -140  G4  -140  A4  -420<br/>E4 -561   E4 -561    E4  -561  E4  -561  F#4 -841<br/>E3 -561   E3 -561    E3  -561  E3  -561  D3  -280</p><p>Cents (C = 0):</p><p>  0.0      41.1       76.0     117.1     193.2<br/>696.6     696.6      696.6     696.6     889.7<br/>386.3     386.3      386.3     386.3     579.5<br/>386.3     386.3      386.3     386.3     193.2</p><p>1/4-comma meantone generators (C = 0):</p><p>  0       -12          7        -5         2<br/>  1         1          1         1         3<br/>  4         4          4         4         6<br/>  4         4          4         4         2</p><p>31-EDO degrees (C = 0):</p><p>  0         1          2         3         5<br/> 18        18         18        18        23<br/> 10        10         10        10        15<br/> 10        10         10        10         5</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=38 href="#38">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/25/2001 10:26:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>likely tuned in a meantone with<br/>&gt; &gt; pure 5:4 major thirds --</p><p>Is that the same as saying 1/4 comma meantone?</p><p>so instead I simply notate<br/>&gt; the actual meantone values as units of the 1/4-comma meantone<br/>&gt; generator, which is (3/2) / ( (81/80)^(1/4) ).</p><p>This is actually a very funny statement to anyone other than a<br/>microtuning enthusiast :-)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you have an Excel spreadsheet that does these conversions for<br/>you, especially the pitchbend to cents?

In 1555, Vicentino<br/>predicted that singers would come to sing the most difficult leaps as<br/>easily as they customarily sang a perfect fifth, and he offered some<br/>tips for singing difficult intervals such as sevenths. Mainly his<br/>advice was to train with his _archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; with<br/>its 31 steps per octave; and 446 years later, that might still be the<br/>best of advice, with a bit of help from high technology and computers.</p><p>Monz, your tuning information looks it might be just what&apos;s needed to<br/>set up this sequence in a program like Scala or FTS or whatever.</p><p>Maybe I might just add a perspective focusing on how the melodic<br/>fifthtone steps for a singer tie in with some of the vertical<br/>intervals like the different kinds of sixths.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that this is only one possible &quot;road map,&quot; and<br/>that hearing and singing are the main things.</p><p>Here I&apos;ll give cents for 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major<br/>thirds, and for 31-tET, which was first to my knowledge precisely<br/>defined by Lemme Rossi in 1666. In practice, especially on instruments<br/>tuned by ear, the real-world variations might well be greater than any<br/>theoretical differences between these two mathematical models -- not<br/>to speak of the fluidity of the human voice once a singer enters the<br/>picture.</p><p>I&apos;ll take the lowest note of a sonority as &quot;0 cents,&quot; and show the<br/>simultaneous or vertical intervals in parentheses above that, plus the<br/>melodic steps of the highest voice in positive (ascending) or negative<br/>(descending) cents. Here the steps of this voice are all upward, so<br/>all the values are positive. Let&apos;s see what happens when we move<br/>through those fifthtone steps in 1/4-comma meantone, with the signed<br/>numbers above the notes of the highest line showing the &quot;total<br/>distance travelled&quot; from the starting note:</p><p>                  +41           +76          +117         +193<br/>     C5 -- +41 -- C*5 -- +35 -- C#5 -- +41 -- Db5 -- +76 -- D5<br/>   (2014)       (2055)        (2090)        (2131)        (2400)<br/>     G4 ------------------------------------------- +193 -- A4<br/>   (1510)                                                 (1897)<br/>     E4 ------------------------------------------- +193 -- F#4<br/>   (1200)                                                 (1586)<br/>     E3 ------------------------------------------- -193 -- D3</p><p>By the way, although Colonna repeats the notes of the lower three<br/>voices each time the upper voice moves, you could also treat the lower<br/>voices as a kind of a drone, moving only for the concluding cadence,<br/>against which you could sing the rising fifthtone steps.</p><p>Mary, one way for a singer to approach this is to focus on the<br/>intervals that the fifthtone steps make with the lowest voice;<br/>Vicentino says that the bass determines the modal organization of a<br/>piece, and Tomas de Santa Maria (1565) takes the two outer voices as<br/>most important. Here I&apos;ll ignore octaves, and treat E3-C5 as a minor<br/>sixth at a pure 8:5 (meantone) or around 814 cents, for example,<br/>rather than as the actual interval of 16:5 or a minor thirteenth at a<br/>rounded 2014 cents:</p><p>                  +41           +76          +117         +193<br/>     C5 -- +41 -- C*5 -- +35 -- C#5 -- +41 -- Db5 -- +76 -- D5<br/>    (814)        (855)         (890)         (931)        (1200)<br/>     E3 ------------------------------------------- -193 -- D3</p><p>Here you start out at C5 on a usual minor sixth, a pure 8:5 in<br/>1/4-comma meantone (major thirds and minor sixths are pure).</p><p>Now you move up to the first step of the &quot;slide,&quot; a fifthtone higher<br/>-- about 41 cents higher, C*5, and land on a &quot;proximate minor&quot; or<br/>neutral sixth at around 855 cents. As Dan Stearns might say, feel free<br/>to &quot;take in&quot; that neutral sixth, which Vicentino mentions in 1555 (he<br/>finds neutral thirds quite consonant). From a JI viewpoint, it&apos;s close<br/>to 18:11.</p><p>Next you move up by a slightly smaller fifthtone of 35 cents -- at<br/>least in theory, or on a synthesizer&apos;s tuning table -- to a usual<br/>major sixth at C#5, slightly wider than a pure 5:3 (884 cents) in this<br/>meantone, or about 890 cents. You&apos;re now a small or chromatic meantone<br/>semitone higher than where you started (C5-C#5), about 76 cents.</p><p>Next you move up by a 41-cent fifthtone to the &quot;proximate major sixth&quot;<br/>or diminished seventh of E3-Db4, which Vicentino finds a rather tense<br/>interval leaning toward dissonance, not an unlikely judgment in this<br/>kind of style where it sounds very different than an expected major<br/>sixth at or near 5:3. It&apos;s around 931 cents, actually very close to a<br/>pure 12:7 -- a great 21st-century concord, but in this context a more<br/>&quot;special&quot; interval.</p><p>In the concluding cadence, that wide major sixth expands to the octave<br/>as you move Db5-D5, a small or chromatic semitone in meantone of<br/>around 76 cents, in contrast with the more usual diatonic semitone<br/>like C#5-D5 at around 117 cents. A JI-oriented person might compare<br/>these steps to ratios of 25:24 (around 71 cents) and 16:15 (around 112<br/>cents).</p><p>The vocal steps and vertical intervals are almost the same in 31-tET,<br/>where those three ascending fifthtones are precisely equal at ~38.71<br/>cents</p><p>                  +39           +77          +116          +194<br/>     C5 -- +39 -- C*5 -- +39 -- C#5 -- +39 -- Db5 -- +77 -- D5<br/>   (2013)       (2052)        (2090)        (2129)        (2400)<br/>     G4 ------------------------------------------- +194 -- A4<br/>   (1510)                                                 (1897)<br/>     E4 ------------------------------------------- +194 -- F#4<br/>   (1200)                                                 (1587)<br/>     E3 ------------------------------------------- -194 -- D3</p><p>Here are your intervals in 31-tET above the lowest voice, with the<br/>different flavors of sixths almost identical to 1/4-comma meantone:</p><p>                  +39           +77          +116          +194<br/>     C5 -- +39 -- C*5 -- +39 -- C#5 -- +39 -- Db5 -- +77 -- D5<br/>    (813)        (852)         (890)         (929)        (1200)<br/>     E3 ------------------------------------------- -194 -- D3</p><p>Monz, your information might actually be more helpful in setting this<br/>up with a software program, since such programs tend to map things in<br/>terms of pitches rather than vertical intervals (at least Scala<br/>does).</p><p>Anyway, Mary and anyone else who might be interested, this kind of ear<br/>training is a really interesting side of making microtonal music: the<br/>best of success to you, and I&apos;d love to hear about experiences with<br/>this kind of learning.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=43 href="#43">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/25/2001 1:09:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi guys</p><p>In trying out Monz&apos;s suggestion I hack the midi file to discern the<br/>tunings I realized that it was &quot;simple&quot; for me to to make an audio<br/>file of this glorious progression.</p><p>.  First I opened it in Logic, slowed the tempo and isolated the<br/>voice I was planning to sing. I used Baroque Strings on the K2500<br/>with some KDFX reverb and eq and recorded it into protools.
