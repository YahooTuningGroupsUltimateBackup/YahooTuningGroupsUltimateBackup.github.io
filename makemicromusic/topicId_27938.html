This is one of those<br/>cases. Also, I often treat sound sources as equivalents. A dutch friend<br/>Sam Samshuijzen called that way of looking at music as  MUX.<br/><a href="http://www.samshuijzen.nl/sam/samzen/mux/mux.html">http://www.samshuijzen.nl/sam/samzen/mux/mux.html</a></p><p>So, what you hear here is a distillation of 22 minutes of recorded guitar<br/>using the simple set up of Ibanez, loopstation (which I was fighting<br/>actually), Marshall practice amp (clean channel) and a Zoom H2 portable<br/>recorder. If you are truly interested I&apos;ll can give you the source and the<br/>19 minute intermediate partially processed recording.</p><p>While I could do some of this live - it wouldn&apos;t have the same complexity or<br/>control.  Its actually been a while since I&apos;ve dragged out a gaggle of<br/>guitar pedals. I have been spoiled by my computer. What I did was load up<br/>the 22 minute original recording referenced above and cropped, selectively<br/>reversed, and applied various effects. Sometimes these effects were the same<br/>for both channels, sometimes the L and R channels were treated as separate<br/>entities. Then to top it off I took the only section that was heavily<br/>compressed (about a minute and a half worth) and ran that through Paul&apos;s<br/>extreme stretch. - the stretched and 19 minute tracks were combined Sony<br/>Vegas as I worked on the film. Speaking of the film, it was generated by<br/>filming about 45 minutes of windows media player playing the 19 minute<br/>version  on my video camera, slicing that 45 minutes into 2 pieces, cropped,<br/>and then combining the 2 pieces of video so they overlapped and applied<br/>effects. Also I &quot;blue screened&quot; black in this video track. For the blue<br/>screen source I took the same two pieces of video into a parallel video<br/>track but in reverse order. To these I overlapped and added effects. This<br/>track is then what you see via the &quot;chroma keyer&quot; blue screen effect of the<br/>first instance.</p><p>So, I&apos;m very curious as to what your impression is now.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sat, May 14, 2011 at 3:02 PM, Caleb Morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How realized: A fairly complicated guitar-rig, in which most of the time<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; direct guitar sound is not heard at all.

Some of these, to my ear, come out completely satisfying and<br/>&gt; enjoyable,<br/>&gt; and some sound more like beginner&apos;s efforts. I&apos;m middle-aged, but feel too<br/>&gt; old<br/>&gt; to rock and roll.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe I saw the wrong pic, and you&apos;re actually in your 20&apos;s. But I doubt<br/>&gt; it. You<br/>&gt; have the enthusiasm of a young man, but the crust of a middle-aged guy.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s<br/>&gt; a good way to be for an artist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for me, I come by my negativity honestly, and try to apply it fairly,<br/>&gt; without<br/>&gt; being too much of a jerk in the process. Sometimes I don&apos;t succeed. If I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; working on something, I tend to become like a chained dog with pent-up<br/>&gt; energy,<br/>&gt; chewing on my own paws.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________<br/>&gt; From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Sent: Sat, May 14, 2011 12:22:38 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [MMM] 19 Black Hawks for Osama<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the listen and extensive comments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These make me curious as to what do you imagine my age and background is.<br/>&gt; Also - how do you imagine this composition was realized?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sat, May 14, 2011 at 8:35 AM, Caleb Morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lovely, and interesting, with the creaks, swipes, hint of major vs.<br/>&gt; minor,<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; subtle F# (6th) over the A-E-B-ish drone<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; up to 11:30, where slight awkwardness/tentativeness in guitar occurs<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wa-sound is less ducky (quacky) than the wa-wa&apos;s of my youth.
