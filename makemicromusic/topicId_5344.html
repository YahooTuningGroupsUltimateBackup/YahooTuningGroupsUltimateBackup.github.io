I went out to the garage, and using my MiniDisc and a pair of binaural mics, recorded two single notes on my marimba (C2 and C3), two notes on my orchestral chimes (C3 and C4), and a bass tone and a slap tone on a djembe.</p><p>2. I brought these into the house, sucked them into a wave editor (Sound Forge), separated the sounds into files (with only noise reduction and normalization), and saved them to disk.</p><p>3. I brought up CronoX inside a sequencer/audio workstation (Sonar 2.2), and then created 5 instances of the synth. With each instance I built an instrument: bass marimba, mid marimba, chimes, hi and lo drums. I then added two more (ok, I&apos;m cheating), one from a previous percussion instrument I created (a morphed tambourine/gong) and the other a gift patch from a friend (tuned and floating gongs).</p><p>4. Everything seemed ready, so I started laying down tracks, seeing what I could come up with. Eh, it isn&apos;t great stuff, but I tried to focus for a few bars on the marimbas (which are tuned in 19tet). It is what it is, musically, but I did manage to work with 7 tracks of the synth, all with different patches, and only had a small problem with latency issues during recording (things not lining up despite my fingers being sure they were hammering in time). I&apos;m not convinced it is the synth and not something else, and I&apos;ll investigate that later.</p><p>5. I did a little post-tweaking, moving a few notes in time, drawing a few volume envelopes, things like that. When I figured enough was enough, I exported the whole thing to an audio file (which means that the mix gets done as data, not real-time, so there aren&apos;t any latency/timing issues, it just calculates everything [I guess]).</p><p>6. Converted file to .mp3, which (alas) lost some of the twinkle, and uploaded to <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>.</p><p>Total time for project: 2 hours.</p><p>So there you have it: &quot;The Avon Lady Wears Lattice-Weave Hose&quot;, rendered only with the fine little softsynth CronoX from LinPlug, with custom sample/patches from yours truly, composed/improvised in 19- and 31-tet. And with no socially redeeming value.</p><p>Questions welcomed, best I can answer them I will.</p><p>I know, I know: Jon used an ET? *Two* of them?? Kinda sick, huh? :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5348 href="#5348">ðŸ”—</a>Justin Weaver &#x3C;improvist@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2003 9:31:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4.

I went out to the garage, and using my MiniDisc and a pair of binaural<br/>&gt; mics, recorded two single notes on my marimba (C2 and C3), two notes on my<br/>&gt; orchestral chimes (C3 and C4), and a bass tone and a slap tone on a djembe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. I brought these into the house, sucked them into a wave editor (Sound<br/>&gt; Forge), separated the sounds into files (with only noise reduction and<br/>&gt; normalization), and saved them to disk.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. I brought up CronoX inside a sequencer/audio workstation (Sonar 2.2),<br/>&gt; and then created 5 instances of the synth. With each instance I built an<br/>&gt; instrument: bass marimba, mid marimba, chimes, hi and lo drums. I then<br/>&gt; added two more (ok, I&apos;m cheating), one from a previous percussion<br/>&gt; instrument I created (a morphed tambourine/gong) and the other a gift patch<br/>&gt; from a friend (tuned and floating gongs).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. Everything seemed ready, so I started laying down tracks, seeing what I<br/>&gt; could come up with. Eh, it isn&apos;t great stuff, but I tried to focus for a<br/>&gt; few bars on the marimbas (which are tuned in 19tet). It is what it is,<br/>&gt; musically, but I did manage to work with 7 tracks of the synth, all with<br/>&gt; different patches, and only had a small problem with latency issues during<br/>&gt; recording (things not lining up despite my fingers being sure they were<br/>&gt; hammering in time). I&apos;m not convinced it is the synth and not something<br/>&gt; else, and I&apos;ll investigate that later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5. I did a little post-tweaking, moving a few notes in time, drawing a few<br/>&gt; volume envelopes, things like that. When I figured enough was enough, I<br/>&gt; exported the whole thing to an audio file (which means that the mix gets<br/>&gt; done as data, not real-time, so there aren&apos;t any latency/timing issues, it<br/>&gt; just calculates everything [I guess]).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6. Converted file to .mp3, which (alas) lost some of the twinkle, and<br/>&gt; uploaded to <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Total time for project: 2 hours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there you have it: &quot;The Avon Lady Wears Lattice-Weave Hose&quot;, rendered<br/>&gt; only with the fine little softsynth CronoX from LinPlug, with custom<br/>&gt; sample/patches from yours truly, composed/improvised in 19- and 31-tet.

It is more<br/>than a trial run to prove a methodology, it really sings! Great work.<br/>Keep it up. You might need to downsample the marimba a bit to make it<br/>sharper. In other words, instead of playing the sample at its<br/>recorded pitch, use a sample recorded at a lower pitch and then play<br/>it back at a higher pitch. This gets rid of the muddled sound that<br/>results from filtering and microphones. I downsample my finger piano<br/>by 2-3 notes to give it more bite.</p><p>Keep it up!</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
