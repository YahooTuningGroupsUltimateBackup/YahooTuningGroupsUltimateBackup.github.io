Maybe I&apos;ll make a recording with<br/>&gt; more 7-limit stuff later.</p><p>Hello, there, Magnus and Keenan.</p><p>What you are describing is one variety of temperament ordinaire, with a<br/>good number (often a majority) of meantone fifths and the remainder<br/>tempered wide so as, in a number of versions, to avoid any Wolf fifth. As<br/>your discussion is bringing out, this kind of temperament does have its<br/>advantages and compromises.</p><p>With 1/4-comma, let&apos;s suppose we place eight regular meantone fifths at<br/>F-C#. Thus this portion of the temperament will be identical to regular<br/>meantone; and the diminished fourth C#/Db-F will also be identical at<br/>32/25 or about 427 cents -- great for special effects in a meantone style,<br/>or for other purposes I&apos;ll explain below, but not likely for representing<br/>a 5:4 third! As in regular meantone, and unlike a usual well-temperament,<br/>we&apos;ll have some major thirds dramatically larger than a Pythagorean 81:64<br/>(about 408 cents), and minor thirds smaller than 32:27 (about 294 cents).</p><p>How about those septimal minor sevenths -- and thirds -- of meantone? We<br/>have another compromise, with ratios closer than in a usual well-tempered<br/>system but considerably less accurate than in regular meantone. Let&apos;s see<br/>why this is.</p><p>In regular meantone, a near-septimal minor seventh is formed from two<br/>unequal fourths: a regular meantone fourth at around 503.42 cents, and a<br/>Wolf fourth at about 462.36 cents. This adds to about 965.78 cents, very<br/>close to 7:4 (968.83 cents).</p><p>In our 1/4-comma temperament ordinaire with eight regular meantone fifths,<br/>and the other four equally wide, the wide fifths will each be about 4.89<br/>cents larger than pure -- and the narrow fourths equally narrow of pure.<br/>Thus two such fourths at about 493.16 cents will produce a minor seventh<br/>of about 986.32 cents (Scala says about 986.314 cents), rather narrower<br/>than 16:9 but still more than 17 cents wider than 7:4. This is better than<br/>a usual well-temperament where all fourths are pure or wider, and vice<br/>versa for fifths -- but much less accurate than regular 1/4-comma.</p><p>Also, if you are specifically interested in approximating 4:5:6:7, let&apos;s<br/>consider first the situation with regular 1/4-comma, where we have two<br/>such good approximations, in the locations with a meantone augmented<br/>sixth equivalent to a 7:4 minor seventh, Bb-G# and Eb-C#:</p><p>   Bb    D    F    G#<br/>   0    386  697  966</p><p>   Eb    G    Bb   C#<br/>   0    386  697  966</p><p>With an 8/4 temperament, based on the eight regular fifths at F-C#, we<br/>have a more complicated situation, with greater compromises in some of the<br/>5:4 major thirds as well as 7:4 minor sevenths:</p><p>   F      A     C    Eb/D#<br/>   0     386   697   986</p><p>   Bb     D     F    G#/Ab<br/>   0     397   707   986</p><p>While F-A-C-Eb yields the best approximation of 4:5:6:7 from the viewpoint<br/>of ratios above the lowest note, note that C-Eb/D# is considerably wider<br/>than 7:6, almost 290 cents (and very close to 13:11).</p><p>Now we find that Bb-D-F-Ab/G# has the same accuracy for 7:4, and greater<br/>accuracy for 7:6 (about 279 cents, still considerably further than a<br/>regular 1/4-comma), since here we have a wide fifth Bb-F, by the way a tad<br/>closer to 3:2 than a regular meantone fifth (about 4.89 cents wide versus<br/>5.38 cents narrow). However, Bb-D in this tuning is not a pure major third<br/>at 5:4, but one compromised by 1/4 of a 128:125 diesis, about 10.265<br/>cents, in the wide direction. This third is formed by three meantone<br/>fifths plus a wide fifth: Bb-F-C-G-D (with Bb-F wide). Thus from a 4:5:6:7<br/>perspective, we need to consider the impurity not only of the 986-cent<br/>minor seventh but the 397-cent major third.</p><p>Still, if you want a circulating (i.e. &quot;all fifths and fourths playable&quot;)<br/>temperament with some minor thirds and sevenths within &quot;hailing distance&quot;<br/>of septimal, this is a way to do it -- but less attractive, possibly, for<br/>4:5:6:7 than for things like 4:6:7 or 12:14:18:21 which don&apos;t bring into<br/>play the compromise of three major thirds which would pure in a regular<br/>1/4-comma. These are Bb-D and E-G# at around 397 cents -- and, more<br/>dramatically, Eb-G at around 406.84 cents, or close to Pythagorean.</p><p>Now for the &quot;other special uses&quot; of the remote thirds near or beyond<br/>Pythagorean. I like to use these in a kind of &quot;neomedieval&quot; style like<br/>that of the 13th-14th centuries in European music based on Pythagorean<br/>tuning, where the near-septimal intervals and narrow semitones (in an 8/4<br/>temperament based on 1/4-comma, at C-C#/Db, F-F#/Gb, with a size of the<br/>same 76.05 cents as regular meantone chromatic semitones) can have a very<br/>pleasing effect.</p><p>Again, an important caution is that this kind of temperament avoids any<br/>wolf fifth or fourth while keeping a wide range of third sizes more<br/>characteristic of meantone than of a well-temperament. This can be an<br/>advantage if we&apos;re looking for septimal ratios -- but it also means that<br/>C#-F, for example, will be just as unlikely a representation of 5:4 in a<br/>sonority such as Db-F-Ab as if the tuning were regular meantone! If we<br/>want Db-F-Ab to approximate 14:18:21, however, then the arrangement is<br/>more advantageous.</p><p>Also, there are times when one might desire the full color and excitement<br/>of C#-F as a special meantone interval, for example, in a rhythm that<br/>places some stress on the first C#:</p><p>    F         E            F#<br/>    C  C#  D    C#  B  C#  D<br/>    A                      D</p><p>If you do experiment with this tuning, an advantage is that you&apos;ll only<br/>need to retune three notes in each octave from the regular 1/4-comma<br/>meantone. If your meantone is Eb-G#, then the notes to be retuned are<br/>Bb, Eb, and Ab/G#. The idea is to make the fifths Bb-F, Eb-Bb, Ab/G#-Eb<br/>and C#-G#/Ab equally wide, and a tad less impure than the regular meantone<br/>fifths.</p><p>David Hill has done some CD&apos;s with a piano in regular 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>and I&apos;d emphasize that the kind of irregular temperament we&apos;re discussing<br/>is something I&apos;m familiar with on synthesizer rather than an acoustical<br/>instrument.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2006 4:16:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 20 Aug 2006, yahya_melb wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Magnus,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I enjoyed your quarter-comma meantone improv - thanks for sharing it<br/>&gt; with us!</p><p>Thanks Yahya!</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Magnus Jonsson wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On Sat, 19 Aug 2006, Keenan Pepper wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That is probably a good idea.

This is not as close to 7/4 as<br/>in 1/4-comma, of course, but still seems to me quite reasonable as an<br/>approximation.</p><p>Compare 981.82 cents in 22-EDO, which Paul Erlich uses for its<br/>approximations of 4:5:6:7, or around 985 cents in George Secor&apos;s 17-tone<br/>well-temperament for the best approximations of 7/4; in a circulating<br/>system based on eight regular fifths in 2/7-comma and the rest equally<br/>wide, one of my favorite meantone variations, the smallest minor sevenths<br/>(or augmented sixths) are around 983.24 cents.</p><p>Also, in 1/5-comma, augmented seconds like Bb-C# are around 278.883 cents,<br/>comparable to the best near-7:6 minor thirds in George Secor&apos;s 17-WT<br/>mentioned above.</p><p>Something like Bb-D-F-G# in regular 1/5-comma would thus be about<br/>0-391-698-976 cents. If something like 22-EDO is practical for 4:5:6:7<br/>approximations (0-382-709-982), then this should be practical also.</p><p>A rule, however useful or otherwise: for a meantone tuning, take the size<br/>of the fifth in cents and multiply by 10 to get the size of the augmented<br/>sixth plus five octaves or 6000 cents which you then subtract (an<br/>excellent approxmation of 7:4 around 1/4-comma, and still not too far at<br/>1/5-comma, as we&apos;ve seen). For example, a 1/4-comma fifth is around 696.58<br/>cents, so the augmented sixth is around 6965.8 cents less 6000 cents, or<br/>965.8 cents -- just a bit narrow of a just 7:4 at 968.83 cents or so.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p><p>P. S. While 1/5-comma is still reasonably close for 7/4 and 7/6, it is not<br/>so accurate for 9/7, where 2/7-comma is close to optimal.

To remedy this fault, I will give a couple of<br/>musical examples, the first in a modified 2/7-comma meantone which was<br/>much inspired by Harold Fortuin, and which like a very recently posted<br/>example of his (Hi, Harold!) uses a 7:4 approximation at one point,<br/>although the near-7:6 is more prominent.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>The second piece shows how the remote portion of the cycle can be used<br/>for a septimal style featuring approximations of 7:6 and 7:4.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>What might be vital for this thread is to make clear some musical<br/>assumptions that lead me to favor either this tuning or the closely<br/>related modified meantone based on 1/4-comma, which I&apos;d consider as<br/>different musically interchangeable shadings:</p><p>    (1) In the usual portion of the circle, I&apos;ll be playing typically<br/>        in a modal style not unlike that of the 16th or early 17th<br/>        century, where large diatonic semitones (121 cents in<br/>        2/7-comma) may be more congenial than in later major/minor<br/>        tonality.</p><p>    (2) In the remote portion of the circle, while I might use lots of<br/>        septimal intervals (e.g. thirds at 275/434 cents), I&apos;m also<br/>        happy with sizes such as 300/408 cents or 287/421 cents. People<br/>        seeking especially &quot;approximations of small integer ratios&quot;<br/>        such as 4:5:6:7 might be happier with a regular 1/4-comma,<br/>        if the Wolf fifth isn&apos;t a consideration.</p><p>My concern is that often it&apos;s easier to discuss cents than musical<br/>styles and sensibilities. For me, the modified 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma<br/>scheme is a neat way in a 12-note system to have all 12 fifths<br/>reasonably close to 3:2 and to be able to play in an idiomatic<br/>Renaissance meantone style in the nearer portion of the circle, and an<br/>idiomatic (neo-)medieval style in the remote portion. For pianistic<br/>repertory, the relevant goals and compromises could be quite different!</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2006 10:19:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hallo Margo,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; May we conclude that for the 7-limit, you prefer your<br/>circulating 2/7-comma variation, over other alternatives, including<br/>regular 1/5 comma and 1/4-comma (circulating or regular)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Yahya,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me quickly explain, before appending a longer answer,<br/>that what I&apos;m typically going after might be rather different<br/>than &quot;7-limit&quot; as very reasonably interpreted by many people.
