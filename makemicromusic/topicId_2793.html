It worked with<br/>Midi Relay, but not without some strange pitch swoops, so we bought<br/>FTS.</p><p>Well, everything seems to be set right, the same way it worked for<br/>Midi Relay. The sound card is an SB AudioPCI 64V, which is set as<br/>both the Midi In and Midi Out for FTS. FTS works fine for playing<br/>fractal tunes from the computer, but for some reason it won&apos;t<br/>recognize the keyboard input.</p><p>Paul also has some initial comments on the program:</p><p>i chose 22-tone equal temperament (M) under &quot;Scales&quot;. (what does M<br/>mean?) then i looked under &quot;Arpeggios or Modes&quot;. i saw some ragas,<br/>and i also saw &quot;symmetrical decatonic&quot;. i tried these and none of<br/>them seem correct -- they all get mapped into ultrachromatic scales<br/>crammed between note 0 and note 12 of 22-tone equal temperament. is<br/>this a bug or am i missing something?</p></div><h3><a id=2796 href="#2796">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Can I safely assume that you&apos;ve used other applications (for example, a sequencer) that successfully read the midi input?
