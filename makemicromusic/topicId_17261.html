They always seem to just take is as postulated. A bit<br/>annoying, eh.</p><p> &gt; There are so many of these neuroscience/music papers now<br/> &gt; that get the basics wrong I&apos;ve given up caring.</p><p>It&apos;s not only the neuroscience/music people who get the basics wrong.<br/>Many on the tuning associated lists have the same problem.</p><p> &gt;Maybe time for someone to take a crack at debunking such papers? Or at<br/> &gt;least debunking the assumptions. Why not a letter to the editor of<br/>PNAS?</p><p>Go for it.</p><p>Rick</p><p>I have even more problems with this paper that Carl does.</p><p>The author(s) seem to have managed to think beyond 12edo.<br/>They have acknowledged that something interesting is happening at<br/>integer frequency ratios.<br/>Yet like Carl and many of the other &quot;JI-blinded&quot; (or should it be &quot;JI-<br/>deafened&quot;) experts, they have failed to think past this paradoxical<br/>anomaly to the next stage.</p><p>Most people will agree that integer frequency ratios produce<br/>intervals which can be heard as having zero-beating when compared to<br/>very close intervals, and that as a string<br/>or other vibrating source is progressively tuned towards an integer<br/>frequency ratio, the perceived beat rate reduces.</p><p>At this stage, Carl, and many other naive or lazy thinkers jump (or<br/>should that I say &quot;stumble&quot;) to the conclusion that these points must</p><p>also be the intervals at which the musical &quot;harmonics&quot; occur.</p><p>Hence many people still fallaciously believe that Just Intonation<br/>must be the only possible reference grid from which &quot;harmonious&quot;<br/>music can be mapped.</p><p>Charles Lucy lucy@...</p><p>-----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----</p><p>For information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>Skype user = lucytune</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning">http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2007 9:23:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;At this stage, Carl, and many other naive or lazy thinkers jump (or<br/>&gt;should that I say &quot;stumble&quot;) to the conclusion that these points must<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;also be the intervals at which the musical &quot;harmonics&quot; occur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hence many people still fallaciously believe that Just Intonation<br/>&gt;must be the only possible reference grid from which &quot;harmonious&quot;<br/>&gt;music can be mapped.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Charles Lucy lucy@...</p><p>I say, Charles, Q.E.D.
