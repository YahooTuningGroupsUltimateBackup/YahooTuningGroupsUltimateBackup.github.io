Seems like most people can relate to<br/>at least some aspects of the issue.  Some comments:</p><p>**   From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&quot;Inspiration goes a lot further, so finds out what<br/>keeps you going , even if it is a LIE, Even a Brian McLaren LIE. &quot;</p><p>Not totally sure what you mean by this, Kraig, but that capitalized &quot;LIE&quot;<br/>looks like some great tuning acronym just waiting to be coined and entered<br/>in to Monzo&apos;s dictionary!  What could those letters stand for?  Some new<br/>scale?  Any takers?</p><p>&quot;If one has only pieces, then in pieces give -Goethe&quot;<br/>&quot;thats all any of us can do<br/>and is more than enough&quot;</p><p>Thanks, Kraig!  That&apos;s beautiful.</p><p>**  From: Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt;<br/>&quot;At one point I decided that our modern commercial<br/>culture is mostly a wasteland.  I cut all TV, newspapers, magazines, and<br/>other stupid stuff that&apos;s full of trashy advertising anyway (and is only<br/>really designed to get people to consume more dreck).  If you watch any<br/>television regularly, but you also want time for music, that&apos;s my first<br/>suggestion.  Turn off the evening news, the late show, and the re-runs of<br/>Star Trek.  My motto is: &quot;if it&apos;s really important news, I&apos;ll hear about it<br/>eventually by word of mouth, just like my Great-Great-Grandparents did&quot;.<br/>They had time for the good stuff.  Now I&apos;ve backslid and I do watch a few<br/>movies &amp; read a lot when I should be composing or writing novels...&quot;</p><p>I enthusiastically agree with almost all of this.<br/>(OK, well we do occasionally watch X-Files....)</p><p>**   From: &quot;Jonathan M. Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@...&gt;<br/>&quot;Lurking is incredibly undervalued in society - if only more people would<br/>take the time to just listen!&quot;</p><p>Yes!  I think most people would rather talk than listen and learn.  Some<br/>internet groups actually discourage lurking!  One yahoo group (discussing<br/>the works of author Charles Williams) I subscribe to actually states in its<br/>description &quot;This e-list is open to all, but lurking and trolling are<br/>frowned upon&quot;, as if lurking and trolling were somehow similar damaging<br/>behaviors!</p><p>&quot;...Have everything ready for you. Show up on time. Do it.&quot;</p><p>Thanks for all your practical suggestions, Jon.</p><p>**   From: &quot;Jim Cole&quot; &lt;jimcole@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: quality time</p><p>&quot;I would know - if I only had memories intact of that period!  &quot;</p><p>Kind of an incoherent blur, isn&apos;t it?  But there is light at the end of the<br/>tunnel.  (Hopefully it isn&apos;t the oncoming train...)</p><p>&quot;Somewhere around the time after Amanda was born I started to<br/>ritualize the times I lulled them to sleep with spontaneous singing.<br/>It wasn&apos;t always pretty nor even remotely &quot;lullaby&quot; stuff in the<br/>usual sense...&quot;</p><p>Wonderful.  I&apos;m sure everyone on this list is deeply envious of your girls!</p><p>&gt; Obviously personal organization and self-discipline are major<br/>factors, and<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t claim that I always manage my time optimally.<br/>&quot;Who does under extreme sleep deprivation?  I have never thought of<br/>myself as very organized or disciplined to begin with, but having<br/>little ones really did in what little I had!!!&quot;</p><p>I can tell which people are parents just by the tone of the responses!<br/>Actually the sleep deprivation isn&apos;t so bad these days.  But the past year<br/>I&apos;ve gotten sick several times and I know it&apos;s just because of not enough<br/>rest, since normally I never get sick!  Not to mention the worst-ever<br/>allergies this spring/summer...</p><p>**   From: jpehrson@...<br/>&quot;I think it really is important to discuss when people find time to<br/>compose.  This is an important topic, and I would say that there are<br/>fewer people who have unlimited amounts of time to do this than one<br/>might suspect.  I think there are *very* few people like that.  &quot;</p><p>I may have overstated the impression that everyone on this list has nothing<br/>to do all day but play and compose.  I know that&apos;s extremely rare, even<br/>among those &quot;full-time&quot; musicians...  I remember reading Robert Fripp<br/>stating that as a professional musician he spends around 5% of his total<br/>working time actually playing or creating music in between all the<br/>business-related stuff.</p><p>&quot;And... the Tunings Lists...  &quot;</p><p>I usually at least skim through the TL&apos;s to see if there is anything<br/>specific of interest but I don&apos;t invest time into lots of interaction.  The<br/>computer is probably not too huge a time-waster for me, but I should cut<br/>down a bit.  For myself anyway I can spend a lot less time reading 20 pages<br/>than writing just one page.  (Unfortunately I have a tendency to read my<br/>email but forget to reply to it...)</p><p>**   From: nanom3@...<br/>&quot;Here&apos;s my advice.  Whenever you can sleep, do.  Cumulative lack of<br/>sleep has a dehibilitating effect.  &quot;</p><p>As I said earlier in this post I have unfortunately experienced the effects<br/>of this in the past year.</p><p>&quot;And hire a sitter , even if its just for a few hours, once a week and<br/>spend some quality time with another adult, like your spouse:-)&quot;</p><p>Yes.  Actually my wife and I spend lots of time just recovering when<br/>possible.  My own stress level is minor compared to my wife who is with the<br/>kids all day!  By the end of the day she is in dire need of conversation<br/>with an intelligent adult.  Failing that, at least she&apos;s got me!  :)</p><p>&quot;Use a little portable tape recorder for ideas and hum in it whenever<br/>a tune comes to you.  You&apos;ll be amazed how quickly you can recreate<br/>the ideas from that, even years later.&quot;</p><p>I will keep this in mind!<br/>But from the wonderful mp3&apos;s I&apos;ve heard I would much rather carry around a<br/>tape player with your voice singing on it!</p><p>**   From: &quot;David J. Finnamore&quot; &lt;daeron@...&gt;<br/>&quot;you can use the built-in sound recorder and the<br/>cheap little mic that comes with it&quot;</p><p>(By the way, my employer makes that cheap little mic.  But I hesitate to<br/>comment on it one way or another from my work email...)</p><p>&quot;Hey, Kris, come to think<br/>of it, you could record you and kids and all for a Cage-esque<br/>aleatoric thing!  Little kids are incurably microtonal :-)&quot;</p><p>No, you mean &quot;little kids are incurably aleatoric&quot;!!!</p><p>Actually I was going to try to upload (to my own ISP space) an example of<br/>my microtonal daughter&apos;s abilities.  Maybe this weekend...<br/>---</p><p>Due in part to this list exchange last night I actually felt inspired to<br/>stay up late and play around with some very nice 11et melodies I started<br/>exploring on guitar almost 2 years ago.  Rest assured I&apos;ll post something<br/>up something when/if it&apos;s presentable.  (Along with a lengthy diatribe<br/>about how it proves that all music theorists are Nazi-Stalinist<br/>totalitarian cultists!)</p><p>Again, thanks all!  Hopefully others have gotten a lot out of this<br/>discussion as well!<br/>kp</p></div><h3><a id=115 href="#115">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2001 2:18:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kris!<br/>    The real truth is probably beyond what we can get to so, we work<br/>with models that have only limited applications.
