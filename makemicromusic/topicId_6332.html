It seems to me the hamsters-and-duct tape claim is presented<br/>&gt;as an article of faith. Why should I believe it? Of course, given<br/>&gt;enough notes to the octave you can do pretty much anything no matter<br/>&gt;how they are organized.</p><p>I believe because I have seen, again and again and again that<br/>&quot;pre-compositional ideas&quot; of any sort,  from ideas on form,<br/>instrumentation, tuning, whatever,  do not usually tell you anything<br/>useful about the &quot;quality-level&quot; or whether a piece is going to &quot;work&quot;,<br/>etc. of a piece of music that hasn&apos;t been written yet.</p><p>As a teacher of composition, if a student comes to me and says, &quot;these are<br/>my ideas for a piece.  ____________________.  do you think it&apos;ll be cool?&quot;<br/>well the best I Can do is say something like, &quot;well, it CAN work or it CAn<br/>be effective if _____________&quot;.   But I have learned that you can never<br/>truthfully say &quot;this is gonna rock&quot; or &quot;Don&apos;t use this instrumentation,<br/>it&apos;s gonna stink&quot;, etc.    Music&apos;s effects and affects are so dependent on<br/>the details,  with all of their interdependency and non-linearity, it&apos;s<br/>just impossible to make such predictions.</p><p>It&apos;s not theory at all.  Just empiricism based on my experiences.</p><p>I have no beef, however, with looking at what harmonic resources a scale<br/>has available in it.  It&apos;s just important to keep in mind that harmonic<br/>resources are not the most important thing, in all types of music.</p><p>And even if you find just one measly little cool sound/chord/melodic-<br/>figure in a scale/tuning/whatever,  that can be enough to write a great<br/>piece around.  Maybe even a bunch of great pieces.</p></div>
