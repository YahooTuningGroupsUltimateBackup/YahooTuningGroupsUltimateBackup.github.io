My recent piano piece was dissed for a<br/>&gt; bad piano setting. &gt;</p><p>As far as I am concerned, when I post something to a forum like this, it&apos;s just an example, like a fragment of notation from a harmony textbook. I make my living putting scores in the hands of players, and it&apos;s the sounds that they produce that constitute my work.  I use midi and sound files to illustrate aspects of my work, and often only work-in-progress, not the work itself (that&apos;s one reason why I prefer closed forums).  The focus here is on tuning, and I invest the small amount of time that I can afford on getting the tuning right, if sometimes ridiculously so, and this is knowingly at the expense of getting the timbre, dynamics, tempi, rubati, articulations, etc. right. But above and beyond that, I don&apos;t know what the hell an acceptable midi or sound file is supposed to be like.  I am very suspicious of the present tendency to evaluate electronic music on the basis of verisimilude to known instruments and the habits of human players.  Two of my teachers (Mumma, Lucier) are real pioneers in electronic music, and such a standard is certainly irrelevant to their work.  One of the advantages of the electronic media would seem to be the ability to get extreme accuracy in several domains, but the direction nowadays seems to be anything but that.  I&apos;d rather have an electronic music that does what electronics do well rather than poorly imitate what real players haphazardly. (Lucier&apos;s combinations of sine wave oscillators and instruments or voices is my model here).   Above and beyond _that_, I suspect that you&apos;ll never come to a reasonable consensus about electronic realisations. I&apos;ve poured days into making a sound font that  fits a particular tuning, half the audience hates it, the other half doesn&apos;t notice. I&apos;ve taken an instrument straight from an out-of-the-box computer, half the audience loves it, the other doesn&apos;t notice... I can&apos;t detect any patter here, just my intuition that I could invest a lot more in sampling and face only ever-diminishing returns on that investment.</p><p>I&apos;d hope here at MMM that unless the realisation gets _completely_ in the way of hearing the tuning being demonstrated,  the discussion would stay focused on the tuning, and suggestions for improving the realisation can take a back channel.  DJW</p><p>By the way, my 22tet stuff is not really an improvisation, it&apos;s a string of sketches, notated on the screen in Finale.  I don&apos;t use the midi-keyboard (the one I have is way too small for my hands)  for notating, I only use it to trigger events when I do live performances with  PD.</p></div><h3><a id=7600 href="#7600">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

We know what a rich world we all have, we, the<br/>brave, who chose to go down the &quot;road less travelled&quot;.</p><p>*Oggs are really becoming more popular, so the analogy is weak anyway. But<br/>weak analogy or not, they are the &quot;road less travelled&quot;. And they sound<br/>better. Hopefully, they will soon be the format of choice. Or, they will<br/>become LISP to mp3&apos;s JAVA.</p><p>*I stand for promoting the good over the ubiquitous. The good needs all the<br/>help it can get over the ubiquitous. So, let&apos;s compare the sound of of ogg<br/>and mp3, and come to some conclusions.</p><p>*The only reason Ogg will not win is the skepticism of the new. This<br/>skepticism boils down to lazyness and fear of losing comfort regarding<br/>change, ultimately. Ogg files are like hybrid cars--we all know its the right<br/>thing to do, but only 1 out of 5 people do it. But we *do* have the power to<br/>change the demand, and industry does have the power to mandate change by just<br/>making less of what it wants to and more of what it wants to. So, we send a<br/>message every time we choose to download Ogg-capable software, and spend the<br/>5 minutes it takes to do so.</p><p>*The nice thing about Ogg is that it wasn&apos;t industry greed driving it. It was<br/>smart hacker types saying &quot;fuck you and your patent, we can make a better<br/>sounding format and make it free for all&quot;. That&apos;s the *real* America to<br/>me !!!</p><p>*This &quot;fuck the common&quot; thing resonates with me. Otherwise, I&apos;d be writing in<br/>12-equal exclusively.</p><p>*Yes, most synthetic out-of-the-box factory preset sounds suck. But IMO, Wendy<br/>Carlos is proof that one can make patches that sound good.

One is the super-MIDI type of specification<br/>(like ZIPI&apos;s MPDL) that allows cool things like microtonality unrestricted by one pitch bend<br/>per note per channel, unheard-of timbral control, and an overall freedom from a<br/>keyboard-biased note-on/note-off model.</p><p>Something like this is only found in custom-designed electronic studios (and not the one<br/>at rice).  But notice that the size of a better-than-MIDI file would be similarly tiny, and if<br/>the data representation of the music were better thought out than MIDI, I dare say the<br/>musicality of digital realization could improve manyfold.

An additive timbre represented by a grouping of<br/>&quot;notes,&quot; each turn-offable and pitch-adjustable...a strange marriage of MIDI and audio...</p><p>Now, I know I could have my own fun using the advanced things available to me (Kyma!)<br/>but I sure would love to see something like this for the average computer user.

That deals with a lot of the tuning issues<br/>if only the MTS standard were more widely supported<br/>by synths and software programs that paly midi.</p><p>It lets you tune any of the 127 midi notes to any pitch you<br/>like so completely eliminates the midi retuning one pitch<br/>per channel problems in Mdi. And actually exists within<br/>midi itself, part of the midi spec but seldom implemented.</p><p>Some people advocate the .tun table as teh way to go but<br/>that has the disadvantage that there is no way to send a<br/>.tun table via midi so it is only good if you want<br/>to load a tuning into your synth and keep with that<br/>one tuning. It is no good for dynamic real time<br/>retunign where maybe you want to make a midi<br/>file where the tuning changes at bar 7 or<br/>whatever. Or maybe you want channel 1 to play<br/>one tuning and channel 2 to play another.<br/>All that is possible in midi with MTS.</p><p>I think programmers seem to favour MTS<br/>but musicians tend to go for .TUN but<br/>if the MTS was suppoted more widely and<br/>better one would see teh value of it.<br/>It allows tuning with double the precision<br/>of midi pitch bends.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in your idea of a hibrid<br/>midi / audio as I&apos;ve actually done some of<br/>thta in FTS in fact. (Fractal Tune Smithy<br/>- the program I wrote to play fractal<br/>music and to retune microtonal music).</p><p>I used Midi to make instruments consisting of e.g.<br/>a marimba playing all the pitches of<br/>the harpsichord partials from an<br/>analysis of the spectrume of a harpsichord<br/>note, and that sort ofthing so you get<br/>these interesting morph sounds partway<br/>between e.g. a marimba and a harpsichord.<br/>Fun to do.</p><p>This next release of FTS in maybe a week<br/>or a forthnigth from now will hopefully<br/>include CSound too - to let you just select<br/>a C-sound instruent from a drop list just<br/>as you do in midi so eliminating all the<br/>techyness of building an orchestra out of<br/>individiual c-sound instrumetns as FTS<br/>will be able to do all of that for you.</p><p>It involves someone making a special<br/>.CSI file which tells FTS how to combine<br/>that particular instrument with other<br/>instruments in an orchestra - but once<br/>that file is made it can then be used<br/>with any other instruments in any order<br/>and with them all in any pan position<br/>just by selecting them from a list.<br/>Then user can also set any optional<br/>parmeters fo rthe instrument.</p><p>Since FTS also has this option to make<br/>custom voices made up of combinations<br/>of toher instruemnts, itwill then be<br/>possible, just as you say, to<br/>make an instrument out of any combination<br/>of C-sound instruments stacked up to<br/>build them into a timbre - and of course<br/>one couls use sine waves, or any other C-sound<br/>instrument.</p><p>So you could say I&apos;[m working on this at least.<br/>:-). Fairly early days yet but all this<br/>described here is working and I plan to<br/>do a bit more work on it. But I&apos;ll then<br/>probably need to ask around and see what<br/>C-Sounders think about it. So far I have<br/>just developed it on my own as an experiment<br/>in FTS. But certainly, it does work -<br/>for most of the C-Sound instruments that<br/>I&apos;ve tried. Some few don&apos;t wrok and I can&apos;t<br/>see how to get them to work because the<br/>functions they use can&apos;t be seprated out, but<br/>most work just fine, including ones that pass<br/>table numbers and work with them in various<br/>ways and ones that need initialisation<br/>instruments (e.g. drum and stick) and<br/>so on all that works just fine and very<br/>easily indeed.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7619 href="#7619">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2004 10:51:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jeff, I totally agree. But my personal opinion is that it&apos;s up to<br/>the composer to properly parent all relevant aspects of their music<br/>and that would certainly to my mind include a self-respecting<br/>attention to timbre and tone,etc. So my general rule of thumb when it<br/>comes to presenting a piece is that if it&apos;s not good enough it&apos;s not<br/>good--period. In my opinion, bad midi realizations are the main<br/>reason this microtonal community is taken lightly by most musicians<br/>who otherwise would seem a perfect fit.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicoMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicoMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;idealordid&quot; &lt;jeff@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I was invited to comment a few years back about music piracy by the<br/>&gt; American Music Center and the core of my argument rings in this<br/>&gt; discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How can we be worried about stealing when we&apos;re not even getting<br/>&gt; listens?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Replace &quot;stealing&quot; with &quot;file formats&quot; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll add another potentially inflammatory comment, I think that an<br/>&gt; even greater impediment to the acceptance of microtuning, is the use<br/>&gt; of crap synthesizer realizations.  I could barely get through<br/>Daniel&apos;s<br/>&gt; recent 22ET improvisations.  Gene&apos;s Ostinato piece, is barely<br/>&gt; listenable with its timbres.  My recent piano piece was dissed for a<br/>&gt; bad piano setting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve got real problems, people, in that we&apos;re dependant on bad<br/>&gt; synthetic realizations to get our musical point across.  How do we<br/>fix<br/>&gt; that?  I only have so much time in the world to tweak patches, and I<br/>&gt; spent a bit of time looking for a more electronic sounding patch to<br/>&gt; make my piece at least an electronic work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But geez... the file formats suck.  The realizations suck.  Our<br/>music<br/>&gt; rocks.  If we&apos;re interested in getting the serious music world to<br/>open<br/>&gt; up to our newness we&apos;d better get all our acts together and I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure what the solution is.  (Although I am sure, I&apos;m not going to<br/>&gt; adopt OGG.  Hehe...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is microtuning doomed to an existence as a bad MIDI realization or<br/>&gt; weak, pablum soft-synth realizations forever?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jeff harrington<br/>&gt; <a href="http://jeffharrington.org">http://jeffharrington.org</a> - new music<br/>&gt; <a href="http://netnewmusic.net">http://netnewmusic.net</a> - new music portal<br/>&gt; <a href="http://beepsnort.org">http://beepsnort.org</a> - new music blog</p></div><h3><a id=7628 href="#7628">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2004 2:38:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jonathan M.
