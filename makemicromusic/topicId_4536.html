Seems to me I used to be able to get it (distant<br/>past?) without delivering myself up to their barages. Oh well, I can always<br/>set a rule in Outlook Express to delete their mail sight unseen (my list of<br/>rules is growing very fast these days).</p><p>Got to run to the local musical instrument store--Home Depot.

Certainly your &quot;filter&quot; idea would work, though...</p><p>Thanks for trying!</p><p>Good luck with the instrument building.  That&apos;s very adventurous...</p><p>Joe P.</p></div>
