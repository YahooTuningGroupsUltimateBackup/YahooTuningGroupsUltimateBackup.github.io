There is no justification for 800 percent profit per<br/>&gt;&gt; parcel, other than the blatant truth about the state of our<br/>&gt;&gt; decaying world. If this is a general trend for overseas shipments<br/>&gt;&gt; of music media and other products from the USA - as it seems to be<br/>&gt;&gt; - I can say that you are wasting your time defending these<br/>&gt;&gt; organizations. I blame not the good folk employed for minimum to<br/>&gt;&gt; average wages dedicating their lives to noble goals without seeking<br/>&gt;&gt; lavish material gains, but the discriminatory and greedy capitalist<br/>&gt;&gt; mentality taking hold of the establishment.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I do not desire any special treatment, nor should you suggest such<br/>&gt;&gt; a course on their behalf. The rectification for this horrid scenary<br/>&gt;&gt; is the immediate global reversal of the aforesaid isolationist and<br/>&gt;&gt; exploitative international policy poised over the world market like<br/>&gt;&gt; a carrion-ravished vulture.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If you have any communication with the said good folk, I would urge<br/>&gt;&gt; you to deliver my sentiments from my side of the globe.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &acirc;&oelig;&copy; &acirc;&oelig;&copy; &acirc;&oelig;&copy;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; jonszanto wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Oz,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you&apos;ll allow me a few words.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman&lt;ozanyarman@&gt;   wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would most definitely support crumbling down these thieving<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; double-dealing institutions of macro-capitalism in any anarchist manner<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unallowable by law.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; The fees you cited were beyond reasonable, and I need to state that up front. The thing I wonder is how this compares to other manufactured good of a similar nature that needed to be shipped from US -&gt;   Turkey, and whether or not a discussion with people at innova regarding a combined shipping might help?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I bring this up for a specific reason: are you aware of the nature of this label and organization. The label was born out of the American Composers Forum, a non-profit entity that has been, for years, supporting the work of composers in unconventional ways, composers who had fallen through the cracks of larger support structures (big-time grants, universities, etc).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; In one very small aspect of what they do, I&apos;ve had a significant partnership: Dr. Philip Blackburn took over the work of Kenneth Gaburo in publishing the final documents of Harry Partch. The outcome of this was the innova/Partch &quot;Enclosures&quot; series, which includes multiple CDs, DVD versions of films made with Partch, and one very large and informative biographical/pictorial book. Together with CDs from New World Records, the Enclosure series succeeded, for the first time, to have every recording Partch ever made accessible to the public. I know this because I curate the archives of the Partch Foundation, and I was the one doing the transfers of the recordings from the original masters.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Frankly, if it wouldn&apos;t have been for 10 years of tireless work by Philip and innova, these recordings, his (Partch&apos;s) photographs, and much of his writing and correspondence would have not seen the light of day, and have garnered the attention around the world that it has.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t speak for the recording industry (yeah, like it even exists anymore!) or any of the other companies. But since you&apos;ve raised the issue specifically with them, and are painting them in a pretty bad light, I just wanted you to know that the people who are involved with the ACF and innova are some of the most hard-working people I know, and that hard work is completely directed at getting composers heard by people. They aren&apos;t evil, money-grubbing scum, but passionate devotees of the creative output of composers and musicians from many areas of the art.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; If it is Partch you are interested in, I can figure out ways to get recordings to you. Write me off-list and I&apos;ll see what I can do.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
