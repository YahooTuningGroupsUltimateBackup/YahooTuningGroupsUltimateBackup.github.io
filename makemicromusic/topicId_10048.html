I can&apos;t ever get choreographers to listen, much less  &gt;commission ;-)<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>I played a 4 hour show today on 42nd St. with a dance company. It&apos;s the<br/>fourth show I&apos;ve done with them, plus another show, a duet with the principal choreographer last Nov., makes five.</p><p>How did I get there? Fate lead to a gig with a cello player who later invited me to play at his loft with a dance studio. Cello player shares loft with dancers. After evening long showcase that turns into an after hours hour jam, roommate shows up and says &quot;What&apos;s that sound???&quot;. Email proposal shows up about a week later. 20 min. show about a month later. At the end of the show, the cello player introduces me to the choreographer I&apos;ve been working with and says &quot;You two are perfect for each other!&quot;.</p><p>And that&apos;s how I ended up with this gig, slow music and slow motion. I never thought I&apos;d end up working with a dance company, my drones are more likely to inspire laying on the floor than any kind of movement, but there&apos;s a lot more dancers in the NYC area than venues and microtonalsits combined. And one gig leads to another.</p><p>I don&apos;t know where you are Rick, but I suggest showing up at a lot of performances of modern dance and getting to know people. Something will happen.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
