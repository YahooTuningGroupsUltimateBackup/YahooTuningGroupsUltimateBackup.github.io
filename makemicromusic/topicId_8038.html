Nice to see you there.  I have to say that Carson<br/>Cooman has a particular talent for setting up dramatic registrations<br/>on the organ.</p><p>Speaking of microtonality... in doing the program notes I realized<br/>that this work was done when I was in the midst of many specifically<br/>microtonal works... Although the *organ* is not a particularly<br/>convenient instrument for microtonality, I was mentioning to Carson<br/>that I thought I was getting halfway there through the use of<br/>clusters, which are used to offset other elements several times in<br/>the piece...</p><p>JP</p></div>
