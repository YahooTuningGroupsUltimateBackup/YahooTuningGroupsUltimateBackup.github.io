Love It!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please tell us all about it. Synths, tuning, etc..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had the pleasure of speaking with you before.<br/>&gt; Could you give us a little background about you and your music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With Many Thanks for the Music!,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky</p><p>Thanks a lot Jacky! I love your music too very much!</p><p>Well... Some of you may remember me from the Tuning List. I am now 23<br/>years old and I live in Helsinki, Finland. I am studying theoretical<br/>philosophy and mathematics at the University of Helsinki. Look for<br/>more information about me in the Tuning List.</p><p>I don&apos;t have much equipment. I have a Roland PC-180A Keyboard<br/>Controller and a PC with Soundblaster LIVE! soundcard. That&apos;s it.<br/>Well I do have a bass guitar but it&apos;s useless for xenharmonics. For<br/>this piece I used my own homegrown additive synthesis technique which<br/>basically combines SoundFont samples of sine waves. I did some<br/>sequencing, a short loop actually which I recorded into a sample<br/>editor. Then I did some processing with echoes and flangers.</p><p>Kalle</p></div>
