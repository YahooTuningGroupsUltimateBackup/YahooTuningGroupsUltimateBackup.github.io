And I can play 17 on my 34 tone axe...just play every other fret. I have 2 tunes that do this...&quot;34 Steps,&quot; from &quot;Acoustic Stick,&quot; and &quot;Microseconds,&quot; from &quot;If The Earth Was a Woman.&quot; Don&apos;t know if they sound like 12 eq...but I think they sound &quot;natural,&quot; whatever that means...best...Hstick<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
