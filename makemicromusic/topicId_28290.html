I&apos;ve been working with Gary David and<br/>Marcus Hobbs for the last 5 years trying to figure out a way to explain<br/>to the general public  the groundbreaking work of Ervin Wilson, a<br/>&quot;musical cosmologist&quot; with whom we have all studied.  His contribution<br/>to music is very deep and we believe represents a major evolution in the<br/>future of music and other fields as well.  I&apos;ve put in at least 5000<br/>hours filming, editing, scoring and narrating etc., what was supposed to<br/>be a short documentary but ending up being a &quot;transmedia&quot; project<br/>including an ipad app, an album, and some commissioned artwork all<br/>parked on an elaborate website dedicated to his work.  The main event at<br/>the website is a 21 minute film that gives the viewer a chance to<br/>directly experience the effect of his musical innovations.  The site has<br/>11 other explanatory videos, interviews, and more to come as well.  I&apos;d<br/>love it if everyone receiving this email would do me a favor and go to<br/>the site, leaving your comments under the different films and mp3&apos;s.<br/>You input will largely influence how we proceed with all this so please<br/>be honest.  I am in the middle of an intensive Disney project right now<br/>and have not been able to get back to friends and family very fast but<br/>please let me know if this material  in any way connects with you or<br/>not.  We&apos;d appreciate if you sent the website to as many people as you<br/>think would be interested, and/or post on your Facebook page.<br/>Thanks for taking the time to check it out.</p><p><a href="http://www.thesonicsky.com">www.thesonicsky.com</a></p><p>Thanks so much,<br/>Stephen James Taylor</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2011 3:56:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is very nice, and the production is superb.
