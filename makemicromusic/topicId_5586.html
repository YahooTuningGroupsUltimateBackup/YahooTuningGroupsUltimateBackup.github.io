E.g. .Am7 is the first<br/>inversion of Am7.</p><p>Anyway the thing of interest here is that, well of course, it can be played<br/>in any scale you like - not just twelve tone ones though,<br/>they can have any numbers of notes to an octave as it looks to the<br/>closest pitches to the chords in the current scale. You can use<br/>31, 72, 19 or 12 tone notations for the roots of the chords at<br/>present, also solfeggio note names which as it has seventeen names to an<br/>octave I&apos;ve mapped to 17 equal.</p><p>Also you can try other flavours of chords such as harmonic series chords,<br/>and the septimal subminor and supermajor chords, etc.</p><p>Examples: Ch7 for the harmonic seventh chord, Ch11 for the harmonic 11th etc.<br/>Csm for the septimal subminor or Cs for the supermajor and so on (s = septimal)</p><p>Cj for the just intonation major chord 1/1 5/4 3/2 and you can choose<br/>between the dominant seventh with 9/5 or 16/9 - use Ck7 for the 9/5 dom7th.</p><p>So then you use this same notation for all just 5 limit chords,<br/>e.g. Cjm for the just minor chord, or Cjsus2 to add a 9/8 etc.</p><p>It plays the closest pitches to the desired chord in the current scale.<br/>Or if you want the chord to play exact pitches, prefix with x, e.g.<br/>xGh11 to play a haromonic eleventh chord rooted on the G of the current scale.<br/>So xGh11 will play 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 9/4 11/4 with the 1/1 set to whatever is<br/>the G in the current scale.</p><p>Interested in any comments on how it works, suggestions for improvements for the<br/>future and so forth. Also any suggestions of good twelve tone scales<br/>to use for new notations.</p><p>The main things I have in mind to do already is to extend the support for making<br/>your own chords and to support the Scala list of named chords. Then also I&apos;ll add<br/>in some kind of option to give the rhythm a swing, and to let user set a groove.<br/>Then will be an idea to add in some example chord progressions too probably.</p><p>It uses a lower priority method for playing the notes rather than the ultra high<br/>priority multimedia note scheduling that FTS uses for playing the fractal tunes.<br/>The main effect of this is that the rhythm is more easily disturbed if you<br/>have heavy activity on your computer, so it works best if you keep things<br/>quiet, and close other programs that are running if you find there<br/>are irregularities in the rhythm. This is just pro-tem - I&apos;ll<br/>do an update presently that plays at the highest priority.</p><p>(e.g. on my computer, I have a scanner cover sensor which seemingly<br/>puts on a heavy load on the CPU every few seconds to check if the<br/>scanner is on and the lid is open - that sort of thing could throw<br/>it).</p><p>The player itself is completely free at present. Later, when I add in the lively<br/>rhythm options then those will time out after ten minutes in freeware mode.</p><p>Has anyone done any work on compiling lists of microtonal chord progressions<br/>along the lines of all those sits with extensive lists of twelve tone chord progressions?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a></p></div>
