However, it is important that the music that circulates from the AFMM be of the highest caliber.  The Early CD in Werckmeister III (PITCH 200202) is such an album.  More appropriate would be a new studio recording of the Telemann, alas.</p><p>One thing for sure, I will plan on more Telemann performances in sixth comma meantone.</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
