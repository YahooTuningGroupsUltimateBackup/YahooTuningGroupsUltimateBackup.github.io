Despite<br/>the fact that every other major notation program has some form of<br/>microtonal support, this one doesn&apos;t.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>PS- Almost nothing in this message is true.</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I downloaded the demo mp3 *last* time you posted, and it was pretty good. But until we get a demo version of the software or something, uh, what is the *point*?

Wow.</p><p>12-tone can always be retuned in various ways at a later stage.  If<br/>the interface is good, it&apos;s good for me.  But I think to compete at<br/>this level you need microtonal/extensible accidentals.  Whether they<br/>playback in any way is another story...</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
