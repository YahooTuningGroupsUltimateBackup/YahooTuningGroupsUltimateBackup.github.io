Did I miss something?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p><p>Nono don&apos;t worry :)<br/>Contest still going strong.<br/>Infact there are finally many people working on an entry now.</p><p>But since it&apos;ll take a while (months? maximum final entry date will be<br/>june 21 but I hope we won&apos;t have to stretch it that long) before<br/>everybody has finished theirs, I&apos;ve decided not to wait before posting<br/>mine.<br/>Also think it&apos;s more fair in a way so you know what you&apos;re up against ;)<br/>My entry will still get a random anonymous filename like the other entries.<br/>And it&apos;s the choice of the person him/herself if you want to post you<br/>entry online before the competition begins or not.<br/>So far there are 4 completed entries, and 3 people have posted their<br/>version online at some point in some way (petr and charles).<br/>(and others have posted inclomplete versions)<br/>I have no problem with entries beeing posted online before the voting<br/>starts etc.<br/>So if you wish to share yours or even ask for advice etc feel free to do so.<br/>When voting starts all entries will get random filenames and get<br/>rendered in thesame way.<br/>If some people can then identify entries based on previous posts, well<br/>then so be it, no big problem.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=22247 href="#22247">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2010 8:10:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok here it goes.<br/>I was yet again WRONG.</p><p>The tuning of the Drei Equale I posted was based on the assumption the<br/>piece is in the tonic of D, as Beethoven seemed to have notated it.<br/>But, after further insights into tonality and my harmonic model, I now<br/>see this piece isn&apos;t in the tonid of D but likely in the tonic of F.<br/>Yes, it starts with a D minor chord, and ends with a D major chord,<br/>but D is 5/3 from F and 5/3 from the tonic is a harmonic model root of<br/>itself.<br/>Actually, this does make sense in the notation way, seemes like this<br/>is no error of Beethoven or regular music theory or notation at all,<br/>as D minor is equal to F major in notation.<br/>In any case, to see the tonic as F makes a lot of sense in this piece.<br/>The &quot;fundamental basses&quot; (something very similar to my harmonic model<br/>roots) indicate clearly a structure that has F as the true tonic of<br/>the entire piece. The piece actually seems to use all 5 harmonic roots<br/>present in 6-limit tonality, namely 1/1, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, and 5/3 (F, A,<br/>Bb, C, and D), amazing.<br/>The Drei Equale has never made as much sense to me as it does now.<br/>So give it a week or so and I&apos;ll have the new version ready.</p><p>Marcel</p><p>On 7 April 2010 07:07, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The title pretty much sais it all :)<br/>&gt; Melodyne retuned real trombone quartet playing Drei Equale in Tonal-JI<br/>&gt; on YouTube.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfI8tQ69zXY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfI8tQ69zXY</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Was finally able to finish it satisfactory after finding a good model<br/>&gt; for tonality.<br/>&gt; The piece is now entirely in the tonic of D (as Beethoven wrote it).<br/>&gt; And if I may say so, it&apos;s sounding goood :)<br/>&gt; Let me know what you think!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My JI transcription is here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%28Tonal-JI%29.png">http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%28Tonal-JI%29.png</a><br/>&gt; It&apos;s very readable, I put the ratios next to the notes of the original<br/>&gt; score image.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More files comming soon, including one where I play a D drone<br/>&gt; throughout the piece to show tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a><br/>&gt;</p></div>
