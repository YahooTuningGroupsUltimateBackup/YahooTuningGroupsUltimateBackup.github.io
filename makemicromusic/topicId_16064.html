Meantone is good but inaccurate,<br/>especially on the fourths and fifths which are important for a guitar<br/>style.  Magic&apos;s the next simplest 9-limit temperament *waves hand*.<br/>It&apos;s better tuned, and I think 9-limit harmony on a guitar would sound<br/>cool.  There are folks who&apos;ve managed JI with guitars, of course, but<br/>I&apos;ve always been frightened off by the commas.</p><p>One thing, as you corrected yourself in another message, is that the<br/>generator&apos;s a major third.  Perfect fourths are a relatively distant<br/>interval (five thirds down) and so a conventional tuning probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t work at all.  (But maybe a lute tuning?)  That means you&apos;d<br/>have to learn a new fingering as well as getting the frets moved<br/>around.  I don&apos;t expect anybody to be crazy enough to try that in the<br/>near future, but perhaps I will one day ;-)</p><p>Without checking the details, I&apos;m guessing it&apos;d be my first choice if<br/>I got a new re-fretted guitar.  I&apos;ve done meantone, and tuned the<br/>strings to copy the blackjack fretting we were talking about at the<br/>time.  That sort of worked, and magic should be simpler and good<br/>enough.  A 29-equal fretting to get mystery is also worth a thought,<br/>but that&apos;s more of a freaky fairground tuning.
