I&apos;m not sure<br/>as to the exact mechanism, but this phenomenon (also observed with some piano strings) is supposedly seperate from what Ayhan Zeren is<br/>describing. Actually, he has brought up the issue of beats to evade<br/>accounting for pitches not defined by Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek theory based<br/>on the 24-tone Pythagorean tuning. He has claimed a most strange thing<br/>when he said that the fluency of perde segah (Bd) is actually due to<br/>executants trying to bend this perde down to dik kurdi (A#) and them<br/>being confused as to its location due to:</p><p>1. Dik kurdi not having been specified in the scores in pertinent<br/>modulations,<br/>2. Difficulty in perceiving the lessened interfereces for these small<br/>intervals,</p><p>with the result being an unacceptable aberration.</p><p>When I cornered him saying that there is no question of beats when the<br/>tanbur frets are already aligned according to Arel-Ezgi theory (tuned<br/>in pure fifths) and when performing in a totally monophonic fashion,and pressed on with saying that higher limit ratios produce no beating<br/>in this scenario compared to AEU pitches anyway, he didn&apos;t flinch and<br/>said that I knew it wrong and that one need not hear two pitches<br/>together to perceive beats.</p><p>By saying so, he apparently manoeuvred out of the tight fix using a<br/>loop hole that wasn&apos;t even relevant to the discussion. For indeed,<br/>pseudo-beats are single tone partial interferences. The beats in<br/>question are interferences due to the usage of at least &quot;two seperate<br/>sources or tones&quot;. It goes without saying that the known phenomenon of<br/>regular beating depends on two tones deviating from their respective<br/>partial nodes.</p><p>Besides, Prof. Zeren also gives practically the same definitions forbeats in his other books!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Apr 29, 2010, at 5:11 PM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt; I hit upon one example Oz - and only one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some large (church) bells have beating because of the complex non-<br/>&gt; harmonic<br/>&gt; overtones involved.

This is the<br/>&gt;&gt; Analytical section.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Therein is also included three critiques against first: a Professor<br/>&gt;&gt; who claims that one need not hear two pitches together to perceive<br/>&gt;&gt; beats, second: a famous Maqam music composer whose rather coarse<br/>&gt;&gt; language and agenda gives away his over-nationalistic sentiments,<br/>&gt;&gt; third: an overbearing Jazz musician who took it a fancy to peddle 48-<br/>&gt;&gt; tone Equal Temperament as a great innovation for Turkish Maqam music<br/>&gt;&gt; in all due theoretical incompetence. This is the Critique section.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I had much joy and fun when the paperback arrived in my hands.
