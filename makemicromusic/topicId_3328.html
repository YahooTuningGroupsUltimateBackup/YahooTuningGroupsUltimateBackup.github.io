Not much to *that*! Works great.</p><p>Good. I was hoping I didn&apos;t have to cringe after my advice!</p><p>So what you do now is, even though you may not have more gear, just set up something in a sequencer and cut-and-paste some track that has a lot of events into four tracks, each one going to one of the four ports. Maybe stagger the pasting so everything isn&apos;t lined up exactly.</p><p>Then turn out the lights in the room, hit &apos;play&apos;, and watch those LEDs on the front of the box go nuts. Just like the 60&apos;s all over again... :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
