People tell me that melodic invention is one<br/>of my strong points, and I certainly find it very easy<br/>to make up tunes, and there is no feeling of effort to it; it is just<br/>a whole lot of fun to do.</p><p>I haven&apos;t worked at it. However I htink it is something that has just come<br/>partly from being around other people who do it - I think it is something that<br/>rubs off. Also listening to live concerts, - did a lot of that when<br/>I was at univ. and enjoying hearing the pieces by young composers in a very active<br/>music dept.</p><p>Another thing is that I used to improvise for hours on end at the piano<br/>and I think that helped.</p><p>Also just letting oneself sing / whistle when one feels like it - if one<br/>is inhibited there I think it might make it harder. While if it is just<br/>fun and one enjoys it, maybe that shows up in the tunes?? Loosening up<br/>exercises of some type to release ones melodic inhibitions?? No suggestions<br/>there as I haven&apos;t needed them. May help that I&apos;m an amateur and don&apos;t<br/>feel that I need to be good at it at all.</p><p>However, a couple of years ago I did a thing where every day i&apos;d just whistle a<br/>tune and write it down - one a day at least, which was fun to do and<br/>may do it again. There, the thig is to just make up anything, doesn&apos;t<br/>matter if it is good or bad, and write it down, I think will help<br/>to make the proces of inventing tunes more effortless, though I<br/>did it rather to try to make it easier to write out the tunes<br/>that I whistle, which originally was rather a slow process - the<br/>technical thing of figuring out what all the notes were to write down.</p><p>Sharing music I&apos;m sure is a help too - listening to<br/>work by other composers and the feeling of being in a community<br/>of people composing using the same general materials.<br/>Gradually we may learn together more about the melodic<br/>potential of all these new tunings we are exploring just<br/>by trying it out, and when someone makes up a nice tune,<br/>maybe something in the way it happens will inspire others<br/>to make new tunes of their own in related tunings.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3809 href="#3809">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2002 10:23:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However I htink it is something that has just come<br/>&gt; partly from being around other people who do it - I think it is<br/>something that<br/>&gt; rubs off.
