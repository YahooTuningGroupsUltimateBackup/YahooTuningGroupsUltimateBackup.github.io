Also, I should<br/>acknowledge my lack of experience with generalized keyboards -- as<br/>opposed to regularized 24-note Halberstadt pairs (two conventional<br/>12-note keyboards at some distance apart, with the same pattern of<br/>steps and intervals on each keyboard).</p><p>First, I shouldn&apos;t let my own lack of experience stop me from<br/>affirming that while it might not be &quot;indispensable&quot; to everyone&apos;s<br/>music making, a generalized keyboard has very obvious advantages which<br/>I&apos;d consider indeed essential to many of the large tuning sets used<br/>and discussed by people like George Secor, Erv Wilson, and so forth.<br/>The question isn&apos;t whether someone could get along without this tool,<br/>but whether it is indeed a valuable improvement -- which it is.</p><p>Secondly, I suspect that I am able to get along reasonably well with a<br/>regularized keyboard -- interestingly, with irregular as well as<br/>regular tunings -- because of certain constraints or parameters which<br/>a generalized keyboard user might well call simply limitations.</p><p>Reading a fascinating article by Bosanquet himself, and a letter by<br/>Wilson (available at &lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a>&gt; in the Wilson<br/>archives) suggests to me that a situation where a generalized keyboard<br/>might be especially helpful is in dealing with systems and uses where<br/>one seeks to combine pure or near-pure ratios of 3 and 5, for example,<br/>using intervals derived from long chains of fifths or involving comma<br/>distinctions.</p><p>In contrast, if I&apos;m looking to built a texture based on ratios of 3<br/>and 5, I&apos;m likely to use a meantone (regular or modified); and if I&apos;m<br/>using a positive tuning (fifths wider than 700 cents), it likely means<br/>that I regard larger major thirds from a chain of four fifths as<br/>desired intervals. Thus a Halberstadt arrangement is reasonably<br/>serviceable, at least comparatively so -- although I suspect that<br/>George wouldn&apos;t be shy about pointing out the advantages of a<br/>generalized keyboard for something like his 17-WT as well!</p><p>One possible hypothesis might be that the 24-note regularized keyboard<br/>might be less impractical if the following question could be answered<br/>yes: &quot;Would you be happy tuning a &apos;usual&apos; 12-note chain of fifths for<br/>this system? -- &apos;usual&apos; implying that the tuning might be regular or<br/>irregular.&quot;</p><p>For my favorite 24-note systems, the answer is generally an<br/>enthusiastic &quot;Yes!&quot; -- indeed, I started using some of these as<br/>12-note tunings and then discovered all the extra intervals and<br/>sonorities I could enjoy by adding another 12 notes at some convenient<br/>distance from the first 12.</p><p>However, someone interested in combining ratios of 3 and 5 (not to<br/>exclude others) in some implementation or variation on 41-EDO or<br/>46-EDO might not be as enthusiastic as I am about major thirds at<br/>ratios like 19:15 or 14:11 -- at least while they seek, as I do in<br/>meantone, to produce textures which consistently use 5:4 thirds.<br/>This could explain why a generalized keyboard would be especially<br/>valuable in such a situation, historically a focus for Helmholtz/Ellis<br/>and Bosanquet as well, for example, Wilson at least in some of his<br/>correspondence -- but I don&apos;t want to imply that it wouldn&apos;t have<br/>advantages for other situations also.</p><p>The advantage of a dual-Halberstadt solution is maybe more easy<br/>availability of 12-note MIDI controllers than technical virtue; and it<br/>calls for developing fluent bimanualism, or the art of playing with<br/>one hand on two keyboards. I must admit that for fast polyphonic<br/>passages, I tend to favor notes within a single 12-note set.</p><p>Ergonomically, the main problem I&apos;m aware of is the vertical distance<br/>between two manuals, required by the thickness of the keyboards and<br/>the shelf to hold the upper one (although that is quite compact).<br/>Moving  between diatonic notes on the lower keyboard and accidentals<br/>on the upper keyboard is the most difficult situation. For some<br/>situations, maybe I should consider reversing the relation of the two<br/>keybaords so that the higher one is physically lower, if this means<br/>that more accidentals for a given piece occur on that keyboard rather<br/>than the physically upper one.</p><p>Anyway, I have every reason to consider the generalized keyboard a<br/>very valuable improvement, while emphasizing that other solutions may<br/>be practical to a greater or lesser extent depending on the musical<br/>context and also the approach to performance.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
