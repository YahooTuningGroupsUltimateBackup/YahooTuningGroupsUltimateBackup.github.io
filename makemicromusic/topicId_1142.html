I think won&apos;t take long as it is rather easy programming,<br/>as it happens (add a tick count and increment the seeds depending on<br/>it). I&apos;ll have a try later today and see how it goes.</p><p>Okay, I&apos;ll explain about the custom voice rhythm in the help on the beta<br/>preview page. I&apos;ll be adding all that to the help proper later when I set to<br/>that.</p><p>Basically it is</p><p>Voice | Edit Custom melod. voices | Edit Instr... | Beats to play<br/>(and Repeat every [...])</p><p>Then one makes a custom voice with say 3 instruments playing<br/>first tick out of, say, 3, 5 and 7 respectively. That would<br/>play 15 against 35 against 21.</p><p>To play 3 against 5 against 7, do 3 instruments playing<br/>every 15, 35 and 21 beats.</p><p>Then go back to the Edit Custom melod. voices window and choose<br/>Select into Highl. Track, (or select that custom voice from the<br/>drop list).</p><p>I&apos;ll explain in detail, but that gets one started.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there is any help for that window yet.</p><p>Works best for percussion / pizzicato. For the in between beats, the<br/>instruments are silent.</p><p>Or, one can increase sustain for the notes - I&apos;ve just tried it and<br/>it gives quite an interesting complex effect at present if one does<br/>that but I&apos;m not sure if it that is how it should be. May be a bug<br/>in the option (have to think about how sustain needs to interact with<br/>the custom voices).</p><p>I&apos;ve put that ex. on the new fractal tunes page too.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/new_fractal_tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/new_fractal_tunes.htm</a></p><p>I realise that the example already on the page actually used another way of<br/>making polyrhythms:</p><p>Buttons | Seed Options | Seed Pos Increment...,<br/>plus a seed that has every fourth beat louder than<br/>the others, which is another way, for some polyrhythm type things.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1159 href="#1159">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2001 11:12:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mary,</p><p>I&apos;ve got it programmed now.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/new_fractal_tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/new_fractal_tunes.htm</a></p><p>There was a little more to it than I thought.</p><p>For instance, one wanted to make sure it finds the rhythms<br/>quickly even if the number of ticks per beat from multiplying<br/>all the polyrhythms together is very large.</p><p>It can now even do 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23<br/>as simultaneous polyrhythms.</p><p>To add one other level, the volumes of all the seeds can vary, say, every 31 notes.<br/>I&apos;ve done a demo of this, with all the parts varying in volume every 31 notes<br/>of their respecitve part making waves of sound.</p><p>That&apos;s about the limit for now. One could go further with<br/>special programming, in fact it would be possible to remove the limit<br/>altogether.</p><p>I&apos;ll write up the help soon, but if you go to the relevant window<br/>perhaps it is reasonably intuitive, also with a drop list of polyrhythms<br/>to try out.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1164 href="#1164">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/27/2001 8:55:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi RObert</p><p>This looks great.
