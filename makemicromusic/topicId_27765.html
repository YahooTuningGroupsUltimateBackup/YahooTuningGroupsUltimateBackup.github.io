The way<br/>that you use 17-equal makes it out to be a meantone temperament, so<br/>much existing stuff will work. However, there are also other commas<br/>that 17-equal tempers out, and these will cause new and other<br/>interesting pumps.</p><p>Petr has been doing a great job at categorizing these, so you might<br/>want to check out his stuff with comma pumps. The basic idea is - you<br/>&quot;depart from&quot; the tonic in one direction and then suddenly find<br/>yourself in a position to move back home. So for example, if you&apos;re in<br/>magic temperament, and you start in C major, and you keep moving up by<br/>major third, you will suddenly find that you&apos;re at the V chord, and<br/>you can go from V back to I. Likewise we&apos;ve been making use of this<br/>for centuries in meantone harmony without realizing it - you can do<br/>things like I -&gt; IV -&gt; ii -&gt; V -&gt; I, which also involves a comma pump.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=27795 href="#27795">ðŸ”—</a>John Moriarty &#x3C;JlMoriart@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2011 3:41:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think most of the interesting territory has to do with comma pumps,<br/>&gt; which cause chords to connect differently than you&apos;re used to.</p><p>I think you&apos;re right, the most interesting stuff for me has been stuff that only works given the commas I&apos;m tempering. I really dig your improv btw.</p><p>One progression in Bug I&apos;m having a lot of fun with goes up a 6/5, down a 3/2, up a 6/5, up a 6/5, and down a 16/15, which puts you back at tonic. In Meantone, it would go from C, Eb, Ab, B, D, and end up on C#. I&apos;ll have to put something up on youtube as an example when I get something solid going on my AXiS.</p><p>John M</p></div>
