At this time I &gt;study the Ancient Greek music theory  (harmony and rhythm) and I try to &gt;learn more about compose music with Ancient Greek scales.</p><p>What is fascinating is that many people became involved in tuning and *then* went back to read on what ancient Greeks had to do with this. Nice to see that you started there and are moving forward.</p><p>&gt;You can enjoy my song &quot;Enarmonio&quot; to the following link:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.mp3.com/morfaice">http://www.mp3.com/morfaice</a></p><p>...and I&apos;ve uploaded it as <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/Enarmonio.mp3">http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/Enarmonio.mp3</a> on the org site in case Yahoo is difficult.</p><p>&gt;Regards and many thanks to Jon Szanto and List-Mom.</p><p>...who, on good days, is one and the same person...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
