A mostly personal<br/>failure of a piece, but in that good character-building way.</p><p>Apparently for violin, 2 cellos, bass, clarinet, otonal organ,<br/>percussion, and kazoo!  Notated in HEWM 72tet ( v &lt; - + &gt; ^ ) (the &lt;<br/>and &gt; were confusedly mixed up, if I recall, because placed to the<br/>left of noteheads, they suggested their opposite in meaning) but<br/>really only hangs around low harmonics of G. Much more confusedly<br/>notated than it needed to be.  Originally intended as a first section<br/>to a sonata-allegro form.  For what it&apos;s worth:</p><p>two takes:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/rough/exposition1.mp3">http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/rough/exposition1.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/rough/exposition2.mp3">http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/rough/exposition2.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Featuring lots of good ole 5/4&apos;s, most intelligibly from otonal organ...</p></div>
