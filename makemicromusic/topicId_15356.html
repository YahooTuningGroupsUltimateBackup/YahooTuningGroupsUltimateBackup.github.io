That<br/>will change. And last weekend&apos;s festival of his music Â— the first<br/>ever Â— at CalArts, where Tenney spent his last six years teaching,<br/>was the beginning of the change...  Yet a work like &quot;Critical Band,&quot; in<br/>which instruments microtonally move away from the standard A, on which<br/>an orchestra tunes, the out-of-tuneness creates an acoustical beating<br/>effect, from which comes an explosion of overtones, the thrilling likes<br/>of which I don&apos;t think anyone ever heard before...  His last score,<br/>&quot;Arbor Vitae,&quot; a string quartet composed this year as he lay dying of<br/>lung cancer, was a final flowering. It was written for the<br/>Montreal-based Quatour Bozzini, which closed the festival with the<br/>premiere. The score is a 20-minute slowly falling and rising series of<br/>microtonal chords. It begins with vastly complex harmonics that are half<br/>heard, half felt, a sound from the beyond.  As the quartet moves down<br/>the scale, the music feels as though it almost touches ground before<br/>evaporating into the aural ether, more aura than substance.  Tenney&apos;s<br/>time will come. It is coming.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
