This is an<br/>example where / when it started to make sense to me to re-examine serialism<br/>as a organizational tool. The guiding factor in my voice leading is the<br/>level of dissonance. It would be hard for me to define right now - when I<br/>was working the score I made variations of the themes and adjusted notes<br/>based on a sense of how dissonant I wanted the harmony to sound. One of the<br/>things I actively was trying to avoid, for the most part, where &quot;near<br/>perfect&quot; consonances in the scale - like a near perfect fifth that had<br/>audible beating / phasing. Another guiding factor was making the right and<br/>left hand parts as distinct as possible and of course to compose<br/>contrapuntally.  The opening theme toyed with the idea of making B the tonic<br/>where the Centaur tuning is technically centered on C (as far as I<br/>understand it). That idea gave way  to more of a free-form follow-your-ear<br/>voice leading with 3rd avoiding sonorities, quartal and quintal chords<br/>sprinkled in as contrast. In the end F was the tonal center with a leaning<br/>towards minor modality.</p><p>I agree that the brass doesn&apos;t have the same punch though I think the brass<br/>does a better job in pulling out more emotion out of the slow section.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, Jun 1, 2011 at 1:16 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like the piano version quite a bit.
