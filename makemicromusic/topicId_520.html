He lived in Rome for two<br/>years on a Fulbright Scholarship. He has performed extensively in the<br/>United States and Europe in solo concerts and with the Sonic Arts<br/>Union, which he co-founded with composers Robert Ashley, David<br/>Behrman, and Gordon Mumma. He is currently professor of music and<br/>former chairperson of the music department at Wesleyan University.<br/>Lucier has pioneered in many areas of music composition and<br/>performance, including the notation of performers&apos; physical gestures,<br/>the use of brain waves in live musical performance, the generation of<br/>visual imagery by sound in vibrating media, and the evocation of room<br/>acoustics for musical purposes.&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>Also, a former member of the &quot;Once&quot; group (they only PREMIERED<br/>compositions, hence the title) of Ann Arbor MI, where I heard one of<br/>their final performances in the late 60&apos;s with Robert Ashley and<br/>Gordon Mumma and my *own* former teacher, the now regrettably<br/>forgotten George Caccioppo...</p><p>________ _________ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
