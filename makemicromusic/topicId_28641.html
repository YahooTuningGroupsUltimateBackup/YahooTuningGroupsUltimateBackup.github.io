(Except for the last sentence...)<br/>As for skill, concerning _performance_ skill - I confess one thing, my aim was to play it live, but there is quite some amount of midi editing in it, incl. quantization. In case it sounds like played live, well, you can call it skill that it does...<br/>But your comment is very reassuring for me!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
