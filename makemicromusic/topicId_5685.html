It&apos;s an utterly trivial conversion.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s so trivial to interpret .scl files. And any two<br/>implementations are bound to have a different set of bugs.

Yeah, scl is a powerful format, but -- every scl file<br/>doesn&apos;t specify a set of pitches. If you drag/drop it onto a synth, what<br/>you get is anyone&apos;s guess. It&apos;s an inappropriate format for specifying the<br/>final, static tuning of a synthesizer. Sorry, but it doesn&apos;t work for me.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Scala does something extremely interesting from my point of<br/>&gt; view: it completely insulates the concepts of &apos;tuning system&apos; and<br/>&gt; &apos;keyboard layout&apos;, turning them in two cohesive but non-intersectant<br/>&gt; objects.&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s precisely  something I don&apos;t want in a tuning map! I want a precise<br/>set of  frequencies on particular MIDI notes. With a .tun file, at least<br/>you&apos;re guaranteed that if you set two synths to the same tuning file you<br/>get the same frequencies.</p><p>I really must be missing something here, and many Manuel can straighten it<br/>out. But as far as I can tell scl format in and of itself is just<br/>inappropriate to use as a &quot;final format&quot; for loading into a synth precisely<br/>because it doesn&apos;t specify any frequencies.</p><p>&gt; Another way to say it is that a scl file is a list of intervals,<br/>&gt; which which a keyboard mapping can produce a list of pitches.</p><p>Again, that doesn&apos;t seem useful to me. See above. There aren&apos;t any<br/>frequencies of particular notes on the keyboard in a scl file. What the<br/>synth is ultimately going to be using is a set of frequencies for sound<br/>production. How do you get that? And how do you guarantee you&apos;ll get the<br/>same pitches from two synths that use scl format?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line for me is that nobody&apos;s shown me that scl format<br/>is useful as a final format for using with different synths; or that I can<br/>just take any scl file and get a precise set of frequencies to match some<br/>other criterion. As such, scl format seems unsuited to be used as a<br/>drag/drop tuning file format for synths.

It&apos;s an utterly trivial conversion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s so trivial to interpret .scl files.

Who<br/>&gt;knows!? What guarantee do you have that two synths implementing scl<br/>&gt;format will give you the same pitches? None. The file doesn&apos;t specify<br/>&gt;any frequencies, it specifies a *system*.</p><p>Exactly.  It&apos;s a language for talking about musical systems.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In that thread Rene writes, &quot;The native scale format is much more<br/>&gt;&gt; complete and powerful<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yeah, but... there may be N-thousand scl files out there, but none<br/>&gt;of them specify any pitches; they specify tuning systems and they<br/>&gt;have to be tied to set of pitches to be used. What guarantee do I<br/>&gt;have that any two synths will give me the same set of pitches? None.</p><p>If you want to assure that two people can get on stage and play<br/>together, and you&apos;re too lazy to implement keyboard maps, definitely<br/>tun files are the way to go.</p><p>&gt;&gt; There are many, many reasons why Rene is absolutely correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No, he&apos;s wrong. Yeah, scl is a powerful format, but -- every scl file<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t specify a set of pitches. If you drag/drop it onto a synth,<br/>&gt;what you get is anyone&apos;s guess.</p><p>It&apos;s no guess if you&apos;ve specified a keyboard map.  Otherwise<br/>they should be mapped to middle C by default, as in Scala.</p><p>Do tun files have throwaway precision?  It seems desirable to<br/>specify the scale once at maximum precision and let each instrument<br/>handle its frequency resolution in its own way.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, the bottom line for me is that nobody&apos;s shown me that scl format<br/>&gt;is useful as a final format for using with different synths; or that I<br/>&gt;can just take any scl file and get a precise set of frequencies to match<br/>&gt;some other criterion. As such, scl format seems unsuited to be used as a<br/>&gt;drag/drop tuning file format for synths. Am I missing some crucial point<br/>&gt;here?</p><p>If synths were all I was ever going to talk to, I&apos;d say tun format,<br/>all the way.  But I (as many others) use scl files to keep track of<br/>tuning systems, and synth compatibility is a highly-desirable feature<br/>for me.

Well, yes, Scala is a highly specialized language.  But .scl files plainly don&apos;t contain statements in that language.  They contain what the link Carl gave says they contain.

Key-for-key mapping with Middle C on standard frequency.<br/>! Size:<br/>0<br/>! First MIDI note number to retune:<br/>0<br/>! Last MIDI note number to retune:<br/>127<br/>!
