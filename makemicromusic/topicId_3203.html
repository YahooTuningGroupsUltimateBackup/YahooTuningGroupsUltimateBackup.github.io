Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2002 8:58:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I have three 8&quot; x 36&quot; x 1/4&quot; spruce tops that I want to make<br/>&gt; into one large board. Before I just glue and rub together I<br/>&gt; wonder if anyone has experience of this type of craftwork and<br/>&gt; can offer some tips. The tops are best quality and expensive<br/>&gt; and I don&apos;t want to botch up the job.</p><p>Alison! Yes - I have made harpsichord soundboards from<br/>Sitka Spruce, starting with thick planks of spruce.</p><p>So I&apos;ll just cover the topic of large soundboard<br/>construction and leave the topic of bracing to others.<br/>Personally when doing bracing I just try to thiunk like<br/>a string and I like making pretty braces that will<br/>never be seen again -- like Pascal Taskin did.</p><p>1. Dry and age the spruce.</p><p>2. Plane the boards on both sides.</p><p>3. Join one edge of boards. I think I just did one...<br/>maybe both though.</p><p>3. using a 20&quot; bandsaw, slice the 1&quot; spruce planks in<br/>two 1/2&quot; thinner boards - I think I got 2 pieces out of<br/>1&quot; material, though maybe it was three?? Long time<br/>ago...</p><p>4. Plane remainder sides until I have 1/4&quot; material, as<br/>you do, but 8 feet long.</p><p>5. Carefully sort through the boards, looking for knots<br/>and curvy grain. Cut boards into largest pieces I can<br/>figure that are straight and knotfree on a cabinet<br/>making (table) saw - BUT IMPORTANT NOTE!! Don&apos;t have 8&quot;<br/>wide sections -- that is too wide and will warp! 2-3&quot;<br/>seems to be how wide I cut the strips. Also, doesn&apos;t<br/>have to be perfectly straight, a little ripple is ok,<br/>just not too much.</p><p>Note that making these cuts straight is important --<br/>ideally the boards are hand planed by a joiner (a<br/>person not a machine) and are given a slight concavity<br/>in the center of the edge. I don&apos;t recall if I joined<br/>both edges. I have a vague idea that for some reason I<br/>joined one edge on each as cutting along and then just<br/>cut the opposite with a carbide blade to be a really<br/>clean cut only. But seems like should join them.<br/>Convexity is the bad thing you want to avoid as that<br/>will promote splitting at the ends.</p><p>6. Layout your boards in the shape of your soundboard.<br/>**Very Important note! ** You have to lay the *end*<br/>grain to ALTERNATE while doing this -- one concave,<br/>next convex. This will be tricky slightly since your<br/>spruce is certainly quarter cut, but just do it so you<br/>have the rigns down to the left on one, then down to<br/>the right on the next. This will result in a soundboard<br/>that does not warp -- if one short section warps a bit<br/>one way, the one beside it warps in the opposite way,<br/>canceling it out.</p><p>7. Now get a real straight edge or straight board and<br/>clamp or nail it down to your work bench or (in the<br/>case of very large soundboards), a sheet of plywood.<br/>Place the spine piece against the edge board. Place the<br/>next piece next to it. Put waxpaper under the joint.<br/>Apply glue to edge. Rub two together to spread glue.<br/>use a large set of flat triangular wedges between the<br/>new glued piece and a straight piece of wood you&apos;ve<br/>tempararily nailed to your plywood -- you have maybe 20<br/>of these two triangle sets (6&quot;-8&quot; by 1.5&quot; rectangles<br/>cut diagonally out of 1/4&quot; thick material.) along the<br/>edge. You tap the triangles together to cause pressure<br/>against the spruce during gluing.</p><p>You should try this without glue to make sure it all<br/>fits and you have enough triangels (are they called<br/>spline clamps?) and you can do before doing it with<br/>glue.</p><p>Be sure to remove all glue from the top edge with a wet<br/>sponge before it dries! And realize the bottom edge<br/>will have glue stains, so make sure the bottom while<br/>gluing is the real bottom.</p><p>8. Wait to dry, then do the next one, moving both the<br/>wax paper and the board that stops the spline clamps.<br/>Repeat.</p><p>9. Use bricks set on towels to hold down the soundboard<br/>from warping from the pressure as your total glued area<br/>gets large.</p><p>10. Now you have a large sheet of spruce in the rough<br/>approximation of the size you want. If you did a good<br/>job gluing and did consistent planing early on, the<br/>boards will be pretty much flat where they are joined<br/>and need minor touchup. However, you may need to bring<br/>the thickness down a bit. You can do this by running<br/>each side through a commercial panel finishing sander<br/>(these look like an enormous planer but have a 4-6 foot<br/>wide sanding belt inside.) with just the most minute<br/>amount of take off setting. Running something so thin<br/>through a regular planer is strongly discouraged.</p><p>But the ideal thing to do is hand finish it using a<br/>plane (will need old-time planing talent for this) and<br/>shape it a bit to be thinner at the edges than in the<br/>center. Perfectly even thickness in the soundboard of<br/>anything other than a modern piano is not ideal -- even<br/>thickness tends to produce thin sounds. Rich sounds<br/>come from hand finishing at this point. X-rayed<br/>blueprints of classical instruments from the<br/>Smithsonian are helpful for this task as they show the<br/>exact thicknesses throughout the soundboard which the<br/>old masters used to get the richness of tone they did.</p><p>11. I&apos;ll stop now, leaving out discussion of the<br/>fitting of the soundboard to the instrument, which just<br/>needs to be done carefully but is straightforward.</p><p>12. Oh, forgot, when you affix the brigde and the ribs<br/>it will be helpful to make a raised table or workbench<br/>to place the board on -- then you make some spars that<br/>are a little bit longer than the distance from top of<br/>bridge to ceiling. Then jam the spars between bridge<br/>and ceiling to provide clamping pressure during gluing.</p><p>Good luck and let us know how you end up doing it!<br/>Soundboard construction is a wonderful topic and so<br/>important to getting the right sound out of an<br/>instrument.</p><p>Oh here&apos;s a tip -- instead of buying all the equipment<br/>needed, can be helpful to either take a night class at<br/>the local trade college, or hire a local carpenter to<br/>let you have access to large bandsaws, joiners and<br/>planers. (though a small 6&quot; joiner, a good<br/>cabinetmaking quality table saw, a 14&quot; bandsaw and a<br/>drill press are all pretty good to have and any<br/>instrument maker will get a lot of use out of each of<br/>these.)</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=3212 href="#3212">ðŸ”—</a>X.

Most are not very loud and have required support to be<br/>heard  with close miking or sound reinforcement. One of the problems with<br/>the Harmonic Canons is the use of guitar tuning pins which are not as good<br/>as  autoharp pin enabling more string tension hence more volume and stay in<br/>tune longer which his didn&apos;t.  In Madagascar they deal with balancing the<br/>string tension by using both sides of the board which keeps the pressure on<br/>both ends and even to prevent twisting.<br/>    I have found hammer dulcimers quite good, louder, and with a wider pitch<br/>spectrum. I have always found them cheaper to buy than build and enjoy the<br/>fact i have have one less thing to build. I make it so each bridge in<br/>independent as i rarely use pure 3/2. Recently i found a chromatic cymbolum<br/>which although is unbelievably heavy, is as loud as any of my vibraphones.<br/>It uses three piano stings per mote and with it i feel it approaches<br/>everything i have wanted to do with strings.
