So much easier<br/>than calculating pitch bends yourself.</p><p>If your music requires no more than 12 distinct pitches<br/>per octave it is ideal. If it requires more than that or<br/>uses non octave scales, you can still use it, and<br/>then you need to treat it as a scordatura score,<br/>so that the score shows what notes you would play<br/>from a suitably retuned music keyboard.</p><p>Anyway the tunes page gives plenty of examples and if<br/>interested and more details are needed be sure to ask.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
