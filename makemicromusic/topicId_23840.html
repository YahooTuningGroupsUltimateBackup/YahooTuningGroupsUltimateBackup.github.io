The theme is &quot;California State Parks&quot;, it&apos;s really expansive and pretty, and is the first album I&apos;ve made with Apple Logic.

But this year I could really use some prize money, so the hope of winning some is a good incentive--I&apos;m saving up for LMSO and a 19-EDO Catler-made neck (which will cost me an additional couple hundred to have a luthier install and set-up).</p><p>Aaaaand I&apos;m making good progress on the Alternative EDO Primer, it&apos;s going to cover 5-EDO to 41-EDO and it&apos;s chock full of goodies: every 5-to-10-note MOS scale is covered (and their instantiations in each EDO are contrasted), approximation-errors of harmonics 3 through 31 are shown for each EDO (in 5-cent increments from 5 to 30-cent errors), harmonic properties and overall &quot;mood&quot; are described subjectively and rather colorfully, and I list some of my favorite chords in each EDO as well.  Also, some minimal synth-piano pieces may or may not be composed in each MOS scale to accompany the reading.  It&apos;s going to be well over a hundred pages, perhaps over even 200, and when it&apos;s done it will (hopefully) be the single most-useful thing ever written on the subject for the average musician.</p><p>And that&apos;s the state of the City!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=23841 href="#23841">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2010 12:28:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow ... impressive.
