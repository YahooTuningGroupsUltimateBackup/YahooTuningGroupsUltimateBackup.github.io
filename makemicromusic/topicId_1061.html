With the added Kyma<br/>access to my schedule I am overloaded as I already had a full schedule and did<br/>not expect access to the Kyma during the fall. I am also going through upgrade<br/>hell woes... I have been running Windows 2000 for a while and soon XP, but I<br/>needed to install 98 again as the Aardvark Q10 is not successfully running with<br/>2000, etc. I tried to get 98 back installed, but of all things my Matrox G450<br/>card is causing lots of grief (although it was working with 98 before). I have<br/>to do the nasty with my computer today: format my 98 partition, install 98,<br/>yank all my PCI cards except for the graphics card, and see if I can get it to<br/>work; then install the PCI cards one by one... Grr...</p><p>Thanks for all the good words with cafe orbital; I had a difficult time<br/>convincing my parents that it was something other than noise; don&apos;t know if I<br/>succeeded... It was rather funny as the studio CCMIX has is not really up to<br/>date. The fastest PC was a P2-300; so I really could not do too much; they had<br/>an old ProTool rig (version 4), but only had the Hyperprism plugins which I<br/>don&apos;t like. I decided to go to an internet cafe which had faster computers and<br/>use Audiomulch and create it there. 90 minutes/90 francs.  Anyone with a Mac<br/>should check out the Pulsar Generator available from CREATE<br/>(<a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu">www.create.ucsb.edu</a>); also Road&apos;s new book, Microsound, is available next<br/>month. I was able to go out to coffee with him for 15 minutes; it was a strange<br/>15 minutes.</p><p>Audiomulch is a PC only program, but it has a long free trial time period and<br/>only costs $50 to register. I have been using it for almost two years now and I<br/>have seen massive upgrades to functionality. By the time it reaches 1.0 it will<br/>be a solid program. It is the first program that allowed me to break away from<br/>midi programming and work with just sound itself. I was surprised that no one<br/>involved with the CCMIX program knew about the program (except for Curtis<br/>Roads).</p><p>Other books of interest that I am trying to get my hands on are:<br/>Concert and Opera Halls: How they Sound -- Leo Beranek<br/>The Audio Cyclopedia.  3rd edition<br/>Audio Anecdotes published by A.K. Peters</p><p>Bob Katz is coming out with a large mastering tutorial around January. The only<br/>other mastering book I could find is: &quot;The Mastering Engineer&apos;s Handbook&quot; by<br/>Bob Owsinski. This book is ok and serves as a good intro to the topic; not much<br/>more though. There is a good portion of the book devoted to interviews with top<br/>mastering engineers.</p><p>Checkout the mastering web community at:<br/><a href="http://webbd.nls.net/webboard/wbpx.dll/~mastering">http://webbd.nls.net/webboard/wbpx.dll/~mastering</a></p><p>Top information available there and you get to see the engineers that you read<br/>about in the Owsinski book discuss their work and gear. I don&apos;t post on those<br/>lists; just lurk; though I had an interesting conversation with Bob Katz off<br/>list...</p><p>Another awesome audio community is Tape Op (<a href="http://www.tapeop.com/">http://www.tapeop.com/</a>). I have<br/>started to pick up their magazine at issue #10 when it was still black and<br/>white. It is probably one of the last honest magazines that supports the real<br/>audio community. Most of the other commercial magazine push products and an<br/>image; Tape Op is definitely different and is great because there is a lot of<br/>discussion on analog recording; a topic that has long since vanished from all<br/>the other recording magazines.</p><p>A good book for studio acoustics is the &quot;Master Handbook of Acoustics&quot; by F.<br/>Alten Everest.<br/>Audio in Media by Stanley R. Alten is also used a lot for teaching.</p><p>On the composition angle I have read:<br/>The Future of Modern Music by James McHard<br/>Electric Sound by Joel Chadabe</p><p>Both presented at CCMIX. I have my reservations on both of the above as they<br/>came off as pundits; IE have some knowledge and insight, but don&apos;t practice or<br/>conceive of much output themselves.</p><p>Here is a review I wrote of McHard&apos;s book:<br/>&quot;The Future of Modern Music (TFMM) highlights the tradition and changing role<br/>of modernity in classical music of the 20th century. As a student participant<br/>of the 2001 summer CCMIX program ... I firsthand gained from the pedagogy<br/>founded on sound based composition which is the focus of both CCMIX and<br/>McHard&apos;s book. ....</p><p>I categorize TFMM as a book that attempts to place the compositional modernity<br/>of the last century into a hyper modern role in the present. By hyper modernity<br/>I posit that TFMM supports the Western assumption that the detached theoretical<br/>viewpoint is superior to the involved practical viewpoint. Nevertheless, TFMM<br/>succeeds in relating the important transitions that classical music has made in<br/>the 20th century and is a worthy book to read especially for the classical<br/>listener who is not familiar with the advances of composition in this past<br/>century.&quot;</p><p>I was actually most amused by the CCMIX course during our lunch breaks as that<br/>is when the guests would start real conversations. One day I happened to be<br/>sitting across from Gerard Pape and Curtis Roads was nearby when I brought up<br/>post modernism. Immediately Gerard offered his viewpoint on post modernism,<br/>basically how it glorifies the fact that nothing new can be created and how the<br/>composers just collage previous periods and create &quot;neo Baroque&quot; music or &quot;neo<br/>tonal music&quot;. I politely excused myself and then stated that his definition was<br/>the text book definition of post modernism and only can describe the most chic<br/>realizations from that area. When questioned on my definition I certainly could<br/>not provide a better answer; other than I hold a lot of things in this world<br/>with doubt and disbelief and have been doing so for only about 3 years, so I am<br/>still working my way through the gray area. This was the first time I was<br/>confronted with staunch modernists though. In my area very few people realize<br/>they are subject to a philosophical outlook.</p><p>Another funny scene that developed was when during a break when Joel Chadable<br/>started to mention these great new sound files he has been able to create; IE<br/>taking a recording of footsteps then making then sound like metallic footsteps<br/>then turning them into pitches. He was all excited like he stumbled across<br/>something brilliant and was recounting it to mostly clueless people (oh, I<br/>meant students!).. I calmly replied, &quot;Well, if I wanted to do that I would use<br/>GRM Tools Resonator.&quot; To which his smile faded, &quot;yeah, that is what we used.&quot;<br/>;)</p><p>McHard&apos;s book is interesting though I don&apos;t agree with the mild attack on post<br/>modernism.</p><p>I am still out in question on the subject though... I have Heidegger&apos;s Being<br/>and Time sitting here (along with the Dreyfus commentary!), so there are<br/>several things I want to read before passing judgement on an area that is<br/>counter to the viewpoints of most of the American (international?) science<br/>community. When will I read it? Agh...</p><p>It was a great experience though. I was able to tour IRCAM and GRM. Wow... I<br/>can&apos;t believe IRCAM and the cultural dominance that is asserted by this<br/>institution.. It is amazing really; especially considering that the French<br/>government gives them $31 million a year let alone whatever industry contracts<br/>they fulfill. I can&apos;t think of a similar institution in the US that receives<br/>that much support to create culture. CCMIX gets next to nothing and it was cool<br/>to hang out with the &quot;punk rockers&quot; of the modern classical scene in Paris.</p><p>I am concerned that the composers involved with CCMIX (Gerard Pape) just<br/>co-opted theories found in chaos theory and applied them to composing. IE that<br/>is very evolutionary; not revolutionary. &quot;Chaos theory&quot; was very popular in the<br/>early &apos;90s when he applied these ideas.</p><p>I hope I am not sounding rude though... I am grateful I had that experience,<br/>but I am just trying to make sense of that world and I hold it up to just as<br/>much doubt and disbelief as when I attend classes at my university.</p><p>Ack. Anyway.. I hope to sub back onto this list around winter; hopefully I will<br/>have completed something interesting audio wise.</p><p>Again get in touch off list if you are interested in mastering as I more than<br/>willing to fit that into my schedule.</p><p>I still am just beginning my adventure into the microtonal world... I like<br/>electronic and studio technology; it allows an individual to explore an<br/>infinite world from the reversibility of history (IE the microtonal aspect) to<br/>applying forward looking techniques.</p><p>Anyway.. I just wanted to pop back on here to say that I haven&apos;t forgotten<br/>about this area of music and it is very much on my mind daily, but I just don&apos;t<br/>have the time to dissect the volume of email on this list or the tuning list. I<br/>could spend all day doing that!</p><p>--Mike</p></div>
