I<br/>don&apos;t know the piece but, according to the reviewer, it begins with a<br/>passage of microtones.  Is this significant I wonder? Probably not. There<br/>was the usual gathering of top class ensembles and soloists but, with the<br/>exception of the mini Oriental festival, nothing of interest from a strictly<br/>microtonal point of view.</p><p>I therefore dived headlong into the programme of Korean music. First an<br/>evening of &apos;Sanjo&apos; or &quot;scattered melodies&quot;. Sanjo is a genre of instrumental<br/>multi-movement pieces developed from the music of the south-western Cholla<br/>province of Korea.</p><p>I won&apos;t go off-topic and elaborate on the art-form, but I must say that the<br/>virtuosity and radical microtonal nature of the music deserves some comment.</p><p>The recital began with a taegum (bamboo flute) player accompanied by the<br/>changgo, a double-headed hourglass drum. The rhythmic cycles played on the<br/>changgo are highly structured. Melodies are phrased to match these cycles.</p><p>Musicians say that &apos;songum&apos;, a concept that indicates both voice colour and<br/>ornamentation, characterises the genre. Songum is heard in the way musicians<br/>bend tones, shade pitches and add vibrato to impart a feeling of deep<br/>sorrow.</p><p>The timbre of the taegum is unlike that of the sweet western flute.<br/>Apparently the fingerholes are equidistant (does this imply a subharmonic<br/>series?) and an extra hole between mouthpiece and fingerholes is covered by<br/>a sympathetic resonator, allowing players to add buzzing to loud pitches and<br/>to notes in high tessituras. In western music I&apos;ve only ever heard<br/>guitarists like Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan bend notes like this<br/>flautist.</p><p>If this wasn&apos;t far enough &quot;out there&quot;, on came a female Kayagum player. The<br/>Kayagum is the most popular Korean instrument , a 12 string zither. She<br/>moved around the instrument like a sorceress, bending, pre-bending, sliding<br/>(both glissandi and portamenti for the cognoscenti) and double stopping with<br/>all of the above.</p><p>As my brain began to implode under the weight of all these microtones there<br/>entered a man with an Ajaeng, or bowed zither. (want-one-now) This<br/>instrument has its origin in shamanism and has seven or eight strings, a low<br/>tessitura and is bowed with a cello bow. I can only say that the sound was<br/>like music from another planet. Double and triple stops with all varieties<br/>of bends and slides seemed to be the norm, relieved occasionally by a snatch<br/>of folk melody.</p><p>The ensemble was completed by two female Pansori singers and a Ching (gong)<br/>player. I&apos;ll leave you to imagine what the resulting sound was like.</p><p>I found out later at a study day that these musicians were Korea&apos;s finest.<br/>In my next posting I&apos;ll tell you about about the art of Pansori, about<br/>meeting the musicians and about my attempts to find out more about the<br/>tuning and playing of these instruments.</p><p>Best Wishes<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=5160 href="#5160">ðŸ”—</a>Stan Hoffman &#x3C;stanhoffman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2003 1:23:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes--Korean music, both &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;classical,&quot; is amazing and wonderfully<br/>microtonal. I tried to find a teacher to learn kayagum, komungo, or ajaeng<br/>in the Boston area, but the nearest I could find was a three-hour drive in<br/>Connecticut (Kim Jin Hi or, Americanized, Jin Hi Kim). If anyone know of any<br/>practitioners of Korean music (any instrument, not necessarily at a<br/>professional level) in the Boston, Massachusetts area, please let me know!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Stan</p></div>
