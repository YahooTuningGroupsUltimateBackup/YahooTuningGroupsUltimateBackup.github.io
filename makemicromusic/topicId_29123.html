Here&apos;s the fretboard design for the first octave:</p><p><a href="http://www.abload.de/img/diamond_frets_94l6xei.png">http://www.abload.de/img/diamond_frets_94l6xei.png</a></p><p>The &quot;frets&quot; are arranged in a nested structure:</p><p>* The centers of the black diamonds mark garibaldi[3] (1:1, 4:3, 3:2), which contains the root and both generators.<br/>* When the red part of the diamond in the middle is ignored, the diamond centers (indicated by numbers) mark garibaldi[12], generated by stacking 5 fifths downwards and 6 fifths upwards.<br/>* The diamond centers and edges, as well as the fret lines between the diamonds mark garibaldi[53].<br/>* The large steps in the former garibaldi[53] MOS are 2 steps in 94-edo. If we add the notes that are approximately in the middle of those large steps, we have a full 94-edo scale. Those large steps occur between a diamond center and its edge, and (sometimes, but not always) between a diamond edge and an adjacent single fret line.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, you can associate the diamond centers with &quot;simple&quot; pythagorean intervals. The left edge of a blue diamond and the right edge of a red diamond usually represent simple 5-limit intervals, while the other edges usually represent simple 7-limit intervals. Some of the most important 11- or 13-limit intervals are represented by single fret lines.</p><p>For a notation system, I use a garibald[12] interval notation based on numbers 0 to 12 (see picture). Here are the pythagorean intervals associated with these base intervals:<br/>(94-edo steps and simpler ratios in brackets)</p><p>0 (0) - 1:1<br/>1 (7) - 256:243 (21:20)<br/>2 (16) - 9:8<br/>3 (23) - 32:27 (13:11)<br/>4 (32) - 81:64 (33:26)<br/>5 (39) - 4:3<br/>6 (48) - 729:512 (10:7)<br/>7 (55) - 3:2<br/>8 (62) - 128:81 (52:33)<br/>9 (71) - 27:16 (22:13)<br/>10 (78) - 16:9<br/>11 (87) - 243:128 (40:21)<br/>12 (94) - 2:1</p><p>The form of this 12-tone MOS is sLsLsLssLsLs, with s = 7\94 and L = 9\94, so the chroma is c = L - s = 2\94. This means 2 steps in 94-edo, or the difference between a diamond center and one of its edges.</p><p>So we have 12 base intervals (13 when counting the octave), and if we add a pair of accidentals that represent the chroma we have a complete interval notation for Garibaldi, or 94-edo. I decided to use &apos;/&apos; and &apos;\&apos; for a chroma up and down, resp., because from my experience the most common interpretation is a syntonic comma 81:80, though it can also represent the septimal comma 64:63, or the pythagorean comma 531441/524288.</p><p>For example, the major and minor scale can be written as following:</p><p>major scale:<br/>1:1 9:8 5:4 4:3 3:2 5:3 15:8 2:1<br/>0 2 4\ 5 7 9\ 11\ 12</p><p>minor scale:<br/>1:1 9:8 6:5 4:3 3:2 8:5 9:5 2:1<br/>0 2 3/ 5 7 8/ 10/ 12</p><p>4\, 9\ and 11\ refer to the left edge of the diamonds labeled 4, 9 and 11, while 3/, 8/ and 10/ refer to the right edges of the corresponding diamonds.</p><p>This notation can be used just like standard guitar tab notation, except there are additional microtonal accidentals. For example, if the guitar is tuned in standard tuning using perfect 4ths, a Dm chord can be notated like following:</p><p>e|1/<br/>B|3<br/>G|2<br/>D|0<br/>A|x<br/>E|x</p><p>(some other chords don&apos;t work that well with this string tuning, try a C major chord, for example)</p><p>An overtone scale between the 8th and 16th harmonic can be written as following:</p><p>1:1 9:8 5:4 11:8 3:2 13:8 7:4 15:8 2:1<br/>0 2 4\ 5// 7 8// 10\ 11\ 12</p><p>To avoid that the notation becomes overly messy in the 11-limit or higher, it&apos;s a good idea to add a half-sharp &apos;^&apos; and a half-flat &apos;v&apos; which replace &apos;//&apos; and &apos;\\&apos;, resp., so 11:8 can be written as 5^, and 13:8 as 8^.</p><p>Note that this is a general Garibaldi notation, so it also works with other tunings that support Garibaldi temperament, like 41- or 53-edo. Similarly, also the fretboard design can be adapted for those tunings: in 41-edo, the 12 small steps in garibaldi[53] vanish (-&gt; between each diamond, remove a fret line), and in 53-edo, all steps in garibaldi[53] become equal (obviously).</p><p>Hope I could inspire someone! Also, any suggestions about alternative accidentals? &apos;/&apos; and &apos;\&apos; look like slide notation, and slides are a pretty cool thing on a fretless instrument.</p><p>- Gedankenwelt</p></div><h3><a id=29124 href="#29124">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2013 1:23:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tuesday 09 April 2013 9:25:20 gedankenwelt94 wrote:</p><p>&gt; The idea is that &quot;fret markers&quot; for garibaldi[53] in<br/>&gt; 94-edo are painted on the neck of a fretless guitar (or<br/>&gt; another suited fretless stringed instrument).

Interestingly, those are literal quartertones in 94-edo, dividing the whole tone 9:8 (= 16\94) into 4 equal steps.</p><p>&gt; I count 55 pitches :-S</p><p>Probably my wording, or the dual diamond in the middle were a little confusing. If it helps, you can ignore the red diamond in the middle, and think of its left edge as a single fret line; its center and right edge overlap with the left edge and center of the blue diamond.

I know there will be problems, be it correct intonation or sustaining notes on light strings, but I&apos;m happy if I can play single note lines, or some simple basic chords.</p><p>I&apos;m more concerned about correct intonation in general, since straight fret lines will mean there&apos;s at least some error if I just go by the fret markers, instead of adjusting finger positions. But I suppose with some experience one learns on which strings and in which ranges the finger positions have to be adapted in which way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Hope I could inspire someone!

They might<br/>&gt; get confused with ^ and v, though.</p><p>Thanks, that helped! :)</p><p>I guess I&apos;ll use / and ^ for non-guitar tab software, /! and ^ for ascii tabs, and half and full arrows for physical guitar tabs ... or instead of full arrows, a # with only one vertical line, and a struck through b, as used in maqam notation. I intended to use # and b for two quartertones anyway (representing 17:16 or 18:17 in 94-edo), so that would fit well.</p><p>- Gedankenwelt</p></div>
