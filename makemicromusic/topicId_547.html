The<br/>many medieval and Renaissance pieces representing &quot;rearrangements&quot; or<br/>variations on earlier pieces, not to speak of the variety of<br/>performance practices, provide much precedent for the idea of music as<br/>a shared resource.</p><p>Your variable adaptive tuning is a new kind of resource which can<br/>augment the range of performance practices. I find it exciting to have<br/>new and older options for adaptive tuning available side by side, as<br/>it were, so that we can compare, learn, and (especially here)<br/>encourage each other in the creation of more music celebrating the<br/>experience (and possibly representing our spectrum of tastes).</p><p>Please let me confirm, in response to an excellent question you raise,<br/>that fifthtone or diesis inflections are not required for Vicentino&apos;s<br/>system of adaptive JI, but indeed represent a matter of style,<br/>inspired by the enharmonic genus of ancient Greek music in which a<br/>semitone is divided into two smaller steps.</p><p>Here is my original version with both fifthtone inflections and<br/>adaptive JI adjustments; then a version with fifthtones using regular<br/>meantone intervals without adaptive JI; then a version in adaptive JI,<br/>but without fifthtones; and finally a version in basic 12-note<br/>meantone without either the fifthtones or the adaptive adjustments:</p><p>original version: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a>&gt;<br/>fifthtones: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4ae.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4ae.mid</a>&gt;<br/>adaptive JI: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4aa.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4aa.mid</a>&gt;<br/>12-note meantone: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4am.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4am.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>What I&apos;d like to emphasize is that the fifthtone steps are described<br/>by Vicentino as a kind of yet more subtle and &quot;gentle&quot; development of<br/>chromaticism, permitting yet more refined shades of expression; they<br/>are definitely meant to be heard, and to stand out. In contrast,<br/>adaptive JI adjustments involve much smaller shifts of 1/4-comma or<br/>~5.38 cents (in a meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds) to obtain pure<br/>consonances such as fifths (3:2) or minor thirds (6:5).</p><p>Please let me add that what your adaptive tunings distinctly offer is<br/>the possibility of _dynamically_ adjusting pitches and intervals as a<br/>piece moves along, a special advantage of computer algorithms. In<br/>contrast, my Vicentino-based methods draw on a fixed set of pitches,<br/>albeit a rather large number per octave, using a computer as it were<br/>to model a kind of player harpsichord or organ.</p><p>Monz, thank you for your feedback as a composer on the effect of my<br/>diesis shift at measures 20-21: it seemed to me to mark a kind of<br/>change of &quot;color&quot; between two sections, maybe from a more exuberant to<br/>a more reflective mood.</p><p>Mary, thank you for sharing your orchestration skills and insights, as<br/>well as the fascinating responses of your friend showing how<br/>performance practices can make a difference in how a piece is<br/>perceived. Before musing a bit philosophical about some implications<br/>for the composer/performer relationship -- or sometimes identity --<br/>please let me share not only my gratitude for your efforts in this<br/>direction, but my warmest encouragement for more experimentation.</p><p>Your musicianship and technical acumen are precious gifts, whether<br/>applied to your own music or to the music of others for which you<br/>discover new and often unsuspected possibilities.</p><p>Now for the more philosophical question which you raise, Jon -- and<br/>also Dan Stearns, for example. Given that a score or MIDI file is open<br/>to many interpretations and instrumentations, some of which may have<br/>dramatically different effects on listeners, how is the composer to<br/>respond to this situation?</p><p>One viewpoint might be that of maximum control, ideally realized when<br/>the composer is also the performer, or possibly the director of a<br/>performing ensemble. Certainly electronic technologies make this<br/>available as an option, and the possibility of a &quot;composer&apos;s<br/>performance&quot; recorded in the most precise digital detail is one<br/>valuable 21st-century option.</p><p>Another viewpoint, however, is one of a creative partnership between a<br/>composer and a range of performers, and medieval and Renaissance<br/>European music often involves a great scope for discretion not only in<br/>choices of voices and/or instruments for the different parts, but in<br/>decisions about matters such as accidental inflections.</p><p>In many ways, I might consider a General MIDI file as somewhat<br/>analogous to a medieval manuscript or a printed collection of the<br/>earlier 16th century: it provides the notes, but leaves lots of room<br/>for interpretations. The MIDI file may actually be more specific,<br/>since it often involves specifying a given intonation -- although as<br/>you&apos;ve shown, John, such a file can serve as the basis for new<br/>versions with dynamic adaptive tuning, for example.</p><p>My own viewpoint is that there doesn&apos;t have to be one &quot;definitive&quot;<br/>version of a composition, although a &quot;composer&apos;s version&quot; might<br/>sometimes serve as a starting point for other interpretations. Here<br/>I&apos;m addressing a tradition like that of medieval and Renaissance<br/>music, where a range of interpretations is typical.</p><p>Having shared some of my own outlook on these things, as someone who<br/>views my music as pretty much fitting the GNU Public License or<br/>copyleft, I&apos;d emphasize that &quot;benchmark performances,&quot; so to speak,<br/>can provide an invaluable reference point: an interpretation by the<br/>composer, or using period instruments, at once offers a sonorous<br/>&quot;image&quot; of the piece and a theme for many variations.</p><p>Again, thanks to everyone for such generous feedback and musical<br/>creativity, and I regret the technical problems which delayed my<br/>response.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=548 href="#548">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Margo, you are operating in a unique and narrow niche, and your analogy to old manuscripts if very, very apt: there have certainly been many centuries of music that was not tied inextricably to the resources used to make the music. The timbre of voices, and more importantly, the exact instrumentation chosen for many period pieces (I love the seemingly hundreds of takes on Praetorius&apos; Terpsichore dances) are testament to this.</p><p>What *you* happen to do is very appropriate for a variety of sound sources at the performance end, and I would never suggest that this kind of composition needs to &apos;pay more attention&apos; to the scoring of the notes.</p><p>Hope that makes it a little less of a &quot;broad brush&quot; type commentary...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
