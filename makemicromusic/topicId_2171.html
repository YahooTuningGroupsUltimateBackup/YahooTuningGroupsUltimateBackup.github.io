Well I actually went through the files last night.  All of<br/>them.  Pretty interesting.  I was wondering... I mean I think it&apos;s a sort of<br/>intelligent deduction... I haven&apos;t looked through the archives at all here<br/>yet; are all these empty folders just a matter of cleaning out the files<br/>every so often?  I notice you only have 20MB here and there are a few new<br/>MP3&apos;s taking up like 3MB.</p><p>On 2/25/02 10:13 AM, &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Robert Walker: &quot;7lim_octony_lullaby.mp3&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beautiful string sounds!

This would&apos;ve fit<br/>&gt; right on &quot;Ralph Records&quot;, where I used to hear some Residents back in<br/>&gt; the day.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ralph!!!  LMAO... Yeah this is very reminiscent of Tuxedo Moon.</p><p>I got seriously wrapped up in all of those melody/timbre objects.  When the<br/>final chunk came in, the clarinettish thing in the right channel at the end,<br/>I thought that was pretty trippy.  Very anti-alienating.  I&apos;ve never heard<br/>something that close to performance art backgrounding, that actually had<br/>some kind of consciousness to it.  For that matter, any obscure T-Rex used<br/>to freak me out when it would walk off the map and just end.</p><p>&gt; Bill Sethares: &quot;Joyous_Day.mp3&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beautiful work Bill! Nice chant. Liked the polyrhythmic moments very<br/>&gt; much.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah that was pretty cool.  Sounds a bit spirited in a cultured way.  Or<br/>cultured in a spirited way.  Either way it&apos;s distinguishable from the<br/>baseball hot dogs and apple pie America.  Freshing.</p><p>&gt; Robert Walker: &quot;twilight_bells.mp3&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beautiful bell sounds! Really love the quality of the tuning mood and<br/>&gt; timbres on this one. Doing some good work with Giga there Robert.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This I&apos;ll just ditto.  Something about just sitting around listening to<br/>bells ring... I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m having sort of a new thought here.<br/>Listening to bells ring seems to be pleasant enough that when I hear bells I<br/>don&apos;t sit around and analyze the musical content.  They&apos;re just bells.<br/>So... With all great effort trying to conform to so many different musical<br/>principles, (with something like bells,) on one end of the spectrum, and<br/>then just bing bong clang bells in the air on the other side of the<br/>spectrum... Starting to wonder what can be found in between.  Recognizable<br/>music drifting in and out of strange sounds, eventually making the strange<br/>sounds recognizable.</p><p>Err - so much for just dittoing.</p><p>Good work everyone.  Glad to hear things.</p><p>Marc</p></div>
