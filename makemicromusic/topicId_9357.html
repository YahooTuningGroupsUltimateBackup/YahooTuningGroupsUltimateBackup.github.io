In my exercie in Gb Lydian,<br/>these wide fifths and the intervals they help generate take a showcase<br/>role:</p><p>           &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GbTry001.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/GbTry001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>What especially excited me was being able to get some septimal types<br/>of sonorities in a circulating 12-note system. Zarlino&apos;s tuning, as it<br/>happens, yields a diminished fourth of about 433.52 cents, only about<br/>1.56 cents narrow of a pure 9:7; this interval is here available at<br/>C#-F (or Db-F in the setting of a neo-medieval style where it&apos;s used<br/>as a regular major third). The smallest minor thirds of the<br/>circulating version, F-Ab and Bb-Db, are about 274.86 cents, or about<br/>7.99 cents wide of 7:6.</p><p>Here these intervals are featured along with others on the spectrum<br/>between Pythagorean and septimal. Note that while the graduation of<br/>intervals, or &quot;modal color&quot; as one moves around the circle, is as a<br/>result of the irregular tempering, Zarlino&apos;s original tuning provides<br/>not only the near-9:7 third at C#/Db-F, but the two excellent 25:24<br/>semitones at F-F# and C-C# (or, in this context, F-Gb and C-Db, two<br/>vital cadential steps in Gb Lydian).</p><p>Another curious facet of this circulating version inspired the final<br/>cadence of my exercise as a musical tribute to Paul Erlich: the<br/>sonority Bb-F-Ab-C (about 0-708-983-1404 cents) happens to combine the<br/>best approximations of 7:4 (Bb-Ab) and 7:6 (F-Ab) with a near-just 9:4<br/>major ninth at Bb-C to give a nice approximation of 4:6:7:9, a<br/>sonority to which you introduced me, Paul. Here the trick is that that<br/>in the chain Bb-F-C, the first fifth is about 6.42 cents wide and the<br/>second about 6.14 cents narrow -- so that they &quot;average out&quot; to<br/>something very close to a just 9:8 or 9:4. Of course, let me add,<br/>22-equal provides more accurate septimal intervals, and in lots more<br/>locations.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m posting this bit of keyboard practice in order to post<br/>a recording of something other than ASCII keystrokes &lt;grin&gt;, with<br/>caution that it _is_ practice rather than a finished performance.<br/>Most of the material is medieval, with special homage to the two-voice<br/>setting _Verbum bonum et suave_ and the _Missa Tournai_, plus a<br/>progression that George Secor should recognize (to be documented in<br/>our forthcoming articles in _Xenharmonikon 18_).</p><p>For the curious, I&apos;ll add a Scala file of this circulating 12-note<br/>variation on Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, and also the intervals in<br/>rounded cents for the Gb Lydian I use in this piece.</p><p>! zarte84.scl<br/>!<br/>Temperament extraordinaire, Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone (F-C#)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 70.67243<br/> 191.62069<br/> 287.43104<br/> 383.24139<br/> 504.18965<br/> 574.86208<br/> 695.81035<br/> 779.05173<br/> 887.43104<br/> 995.81035<br/> 1079.05173<br/> 2/1</p><p>     Gb       Ab       Bb      C   Db      Eb       F    Gb<br/>     0       204      421     625  696     913     1129 1200<br/>        204       217     204    71    217     217    71</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
