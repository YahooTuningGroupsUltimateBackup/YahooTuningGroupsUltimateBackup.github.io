I find Jorgenson to be a very interesting book,<br/>myself, but I would never ever ever recommend him to a beginner or even a<br/>gullible but semi-knowledgeable amateur. There are people in Early Music<br/>who get very hot under the collar at the mere mention of his name.</p><p>There are two half-comma fifths in this temperament. I&apos;d want there to be a<br/>lot more than that to call it a half-comma temperament. But they are indeed<br/>important fifths, it&apos;s a-e and d-a -- and to have those two fifths beating 6 or 7<br/>times a second in the middle of the keyboard would indeed add color. In<br/>music from Kirnberger&apos;s period I don&apos;t think it would be likely to sound very<br/>elegant.</p><p>&gt; Even so, that Kirnberger well temperament does give a period<br/>&gt; flavor and is so outlandishly easy to tune that even I have<br/>&gt; attempted it.</p><p>Well, this brings up the question of what&apos;s &apos;easy&apos;? Letters and fictional<br/>works of the period where people talk about their keyboard instruments<br/>daon&apos;t talk about &apos;I tuned my Clavier in Kirnberger 2 equal-beating<br/>temperament today&apos;, they just say &apos;I tuned the clavier&apos;. Organ tuners talked<br/>about the details (and mostly they used quarter-comma meantone, in some<br/>places well into the 19th century), because they had to tune a lot of ranks<br/>into unison, often tuned at different times, and they also had collections of<br/>lots of other instruments that had to play with them etc. but when people<br/>talked about their little living room clavichord they just said &apos;I tuned the<br/>clavichord&apos;. They didn&apos;t feel the need to hit some perfectly accurate exact<br/>template. They tuned for themselves, the tuning hammer was in a little<br/>drawer inteh instrument, if somethign bothered them while they were<br/>playing they fixed it.</p><p>What I do for tuning an all-purpose well-temperament on my harpsichord is I<br/>tune the first 4 intorvals to make the third c-e, to make it have just a few<br/>beats in it usually, but if I am working on a mix of music that includes lots<br/>of earlier stuff I make it pure, I adjust the fifths and fourth for g, d, and a to<br/>be fairly even.Then I tune fifths and fourths from e to b, f# and c# and from c<br/>to f and b flat to be just slightly tempered, or maybe even pure, and then I<br/>connect the c# to the b flat by means of  some sort of e flat /d# and a flat /<br/>g# that aren&apos;t too wolfy and make the keys I happen to be playing in at the<br/>moment work. And as I practice I maybe find I want the e flats a little lower<br/>so I move them. By the time I give the concert I have developed it into a<br/>tempe4rament that makes all of the funny mix of music from 2 or 3<br/>centuries sound acceptable.  And it doesn&apos;t have a name on it unless I want<br/>to give it one.</p><p>It&apos;s really not that hard, the important thing is to listen.</p><p>Judy</p></div>
