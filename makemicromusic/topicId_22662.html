No doubt it could sound much different<br/>on a guitar.  Sorry if this isn&apos;t more useful, but I don&apos;t have<br/>an 8 edo guitar and timbre does matter with these things.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=22664 href="#22664">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2010 1:29:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I tried out the chord on my 16-EDO steel-string, and I concur--washes of &quot;maj7-ness&quot; seemed to come in and out as I strummed it.  Arpeggiated, not so much.  It warbles and beats a lot, I liked it better with the 1500&cent; interval raised to 1575&cent;, then it practically sang!  (In a weird augmented way).</p><p>I do like 8-EDO though, it sounds great with plucked-string timbres!  I like these triads: 0-450-750, 0-450-900, 0-750-1050, and 0-450-600 (in addition to the 0-300-750 triad).  It&apos;s a very unique mood, and it&apos;s lack of &quot;stability&quot; makes for great contrast and strong xenharmonics.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mark&quot; &lt;mark.barnes3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I play the 8 edo chord given in cents as: 0, 750, 1200, 1500, 1950, 2400 on my semi acoustic lyre-guitar it sounds like a major 7th to me.
