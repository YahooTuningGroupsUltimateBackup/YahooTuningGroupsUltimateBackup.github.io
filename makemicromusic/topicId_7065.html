Anytime I&apos;ve &quot;lowballed it&quot;, I ended up with a<br/>&gt;machine that had sucky graphics card such that it seemed to chew a lot<br/>&gt;of CPU pushing bits around on the screen.

I&apos;ve heard the VAZ stuff is pretty easy on CPU cycles. But try out a number of VST instruments, and you see that some are efficient, and others are hogs. Besides, while on can always dump to audio, it sure is nice on a big orchestration to keep all your instruments happening.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7110 href="#7110">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2004 10:02:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

If you insist on getting the very latest and very fastest, &gt;you will always pay a huge premium for something which will rapidly &gt;decrease in value, so asking yourself if it is worth it is a good &gt;practice. Do you need 3 GHz, or would 1.5 GHz suffice? &gt;<br/>I&apos;m a &quot;power user&quot;, I regularly search databases here of 200,000 names+.
