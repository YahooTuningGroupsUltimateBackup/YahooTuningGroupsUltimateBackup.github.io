One can use these best<br/>approximations in a neo-medieval kind of style while keeping to the<br/>same familiar fingerings and note spellings as in Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Two features of 22-tET have drawn mixed comments: the rather heavy<br/>temperament of the fifth (about 7.14 cents wide), and the small size<br/>of the diatonic semitone at around 55 cents (1/22 octave). While I<br/>tend to prefer a milder tempering of the fifth (except when I&apos;m using<br/>something like 13-tET, 14-tET, 20-tET, or 25-tET, that is!), I find<br/>this tuning a stimulating variation for medieval or neomedieval<br/>music. Part of the fun is playing routine progressions in routine<br/>patterns -- with a &quot;pleasantly different&quot; sound.</p><p>As has been discussed, 22-tET presents some complications when used<br/>for diatonic major/minor styles of tonality based on just or<br/>approximate ratios of 2-3-5 or 2-3-5-7; as an admirer of the 4:5:6:7<br/>approximation in this and similar &quot;paultone&quot; temperaments, Paul Erlich<br/>phas creatively and ingeniously developed a decatonic style of melody<br/>and harmony in which the music at once fits the structure of these<br/>tunings and achieves patterns of tonality analogous to those of the<br/>major/minor system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6908 href="#6908">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2004 5:41:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter<br/>&lt;mschulter@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The first piece here presented in 22-tET was recently used for a<br/>&gt; comparison between Pythagorean intonation (the likely historical<br/>&gt; choice for this kind of 13th-century style) and some similar<br/>&gt; temperaments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/librar22.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/librar22.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded an ogg version of this in the 22-et tuning to my web<br/>site:</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/coll.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/coll.htm</a></p></div>
