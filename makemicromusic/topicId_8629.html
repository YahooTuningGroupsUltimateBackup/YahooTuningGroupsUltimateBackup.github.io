Blumberg<br/>calls these keyboard layouts &quot;isomorphic,&quot; from the Greek roots meaning<br/>&quot;same shape,&quot; and I&apos;ve adopted that term.  On an isomorphic keyboard,<br/>every occurrence of a given interval has the &quot;same shape&quot; wherever it<br/>occurs (edge conditions aside).</p><p>I have attached a PDF file (&quot;Summary of Isomorphic Keyboard Layouts,&quot;<br/>13K) that describes the essential characteristics that can be used to<br/>discriminate among all possible isomorphic keyboards.  I have also<br/>attached an image of a three-octave, 19-button-per octave Wicki/Hayden<br/>keyboard (19ButtonName.jpg, 194K).</p><p>The Wicki/Hayden layout is a particularly interesting isomorphic layout<br/>because</p><p>(a) it exposes the symmetry of the diatonic scale around the second<br/>degree of its Ionian mode (D in C Major)</p><p>(b) by sizing, spacing, and shaping the note-controlling buttons<br/>optimally (which is NOT shown in the attached JPG), one can fit a<br/>three-octave range of buttons within the span of a single hand&apos;s<br/>fingers, and</p><p>(c) it clusters the notes of the diatonic scale into a single<br/>multi-button column, flanked on either side by multi-button columns of<br/>chromatic notes.</p><p>By naming one such chromatic column&apos;s buttons using flat names, and the<br/>other using sharp names, the isomorphic fingering patterns of scales,<br/>chords, etc. can be consistent with traditional note-naming conventions.</p><p><a href="http://www.maccann-duet.com/hayden/Hayden-The-Hayden-System.pdf">http://www.maccann-duet.com/hayden/Hayden-The-Hayden-System.pdf</a></p><p>Bill tells me that microtonalists might be particularly interested in<br/>the observation that if any given isomorphic keyboard (not just the<br/>Wicki/Hayden) uses this system of enharmonic naming (flats on one<br/>&quot;side,&quot; sharps on the other) then it will have the same pattern of<br/>note-names in every N-ET tuning if at least N buttons are included per<br/>octave.  This is particularly useful for those N that provide a<br/>recognizable diatonic scale.  The Wicki/Hayden keyboard displays this<br/>consistency especially clearly, due to its being vertically symmetrical<br/>around D.</p><p>More specifically, an electronic instrument that used a<br/>19-button-per-octave Wicki/Hayden keyboard layout (like that shown in<br/>the attached JPG) would present the same pattern of note-names in 12-ET,<br/>17-ET, and 19-ET.</p><p>+ In 12-ET, the buttons labeled Cb and E# would be enharmonic with the<br/>diatonic (white) B and F buttons respectively; all of the other black<br/>buttons would be enharmonic with other black buttons (on the other<br/>side).</p><p>+ In 17-ET, Cb and E# would still be enharmonic with the diatonic B and<br/>F respectively, but none of the other black buttons would be enharmonic<br/>with any other.</p><p>+ In 19-ET, the keyboard would not have any enharmonic buttons; each<br/>button would control a unique pitch.</p><p>Because such a keyboard would have the same fingering of diatonic<br/>patterns (the diatonic scale, diatonic chords, etc.) in all such N-ET<br/>tunings, it would be an especially effective tool for introducing<br/>microtonal novices to non-12 ET divisions of the octave.  Indeed, if<br/>successful solely on its 12-ET-based merits, such an instrument could be<br/>the Trojan Horse that slips an hidden cargo of microtonality into the<br/>mainstream musical world.</p><p>The first question for this group is: is what I&apos;ve presented in this<br/>email and its attachments already known, or its it novel?  I understand<br/>that Erv Wilson has done a lot of work with generalized keyboards, but<br/>what I&apos;ve read of his work does not seem to parallel mine - unless I&apos;m<br/>missing something, which is more than likely.  :-)</p><p>Let&apos;s take a moment to consider some of the other benefits provided by<br/>an instrument with two keyboards (one for each hand, optionally mirrored<br/>to reflect the mirroring of human hands), each with three-octave,<br/>19-button-per-octave, W/H-optimized button-arrangements.</p><p>1) It places three octaves under the span of each hand, so - using both<br/>hands - you can select notes from across a six-octave range<br/>simultaneously.  That&apos;s about three times the span of two hands over a<br/>piano keyboard.</p><p>2) You can press the two adjacent buttons sounding any given P4 or P5<br/>interval (or the three mutually-adjacent buttons sounding any given sus2<br/>or sus4 triad) simultaneously with a single fingertip.  Using one hand,<br/>one can play eight or more harmonious notes simultaneously.  Look at the<br/>W/H keyboard, and you&apos;ll see that this makes single-handed playing of<br/>highly-extended chords possible, without dropping notes.</p><p>Because you can play lots of harmonious notes over a wide range on a<br/>Wicki/Hayden layout-based instrument, it is possible to play<br/>(essentially) full orchestra scores on it, whereas such scores have to<br/>be reduced significantly to be played on the piano.  This ability has<br/>been demonstrated by performers of W/H-based acoustic concertinas - it&apos;s<br/>real, not theoretical.</p><p>3) Because the W/H-based keyboards are so small, the entire two-keyboard<br/>(hence six octave) instrument can be remarkably tiny - about the size<br/>and weight of a thick paperback book, partially opened.</p><p>The second question for the group is: if you presumed that such a<br/>six-octave, 19-button-per-octave, W/H-layout instrument had all the<br/>usual MIDI keyboard features, was Mac &amp; PC compatible, was compatible<br/>with both hardware and software synths, emitted data via all the usual<br/>physical &amp; wireless interfaces, was highly programmable, had<br/>velocity-sensitive keys and polyphonic aftertouch, supported OSC, and<br/>generally supported every other feature ever seen on any other<br/>MIDI-controller keyboard ever.</p><p>+ Would you buy one?</p><p>+ What would it worth to you (i.e., what would you be both willing and<br/>capable of paying me for it), given its unique advantages, including its<br/>isomorphic support for microtonality?</p><p>+ What among the above described features is of greatest value to you?</p><p>+ How many people do you think there are in the world who would buy one<br/>at that price for the same reason(s) you would?</p><p>+ How price-elastic to you think that demand is?  Alternatively put, by<br/>what percentage would I have to lower its price to sell twice as many,<br/>all else being equal?</p><p>Hoping that interested readers will respond to the group regarding<br/>novelty (question #1), and to me privately (james@...)<br/>regarding the product/market/pricing issues (question #2), I am</p><p>Sincerely Yours,</p><p>James</p><p>P.S.:  I am not able to supply any additional details about the proposed<br/>instrument at this time, but I would welcome your suggestions, sent to<br/>me privately.</p><p>P.P.S.:  One feature request I know I&apos;ll get from this group is to<br/>deliver more than 19 buttons per octave.  Sorry, I can&apos;t do it.  19 is<br/>the upper bound of what the human hand can span at maximum<br/>button-density - I&apos;ve checked.  In my proposed instrument, if you can&apos;t<br/>span it, you can&apos;t play it, so there&apos;s no point.  You&apos;re welcome to<br/>build your own isomorphic 22-button-per-octave keyboards, though!  :-)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=8630 href="#8630">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2005 8:48:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The Hayden Keyboard is  what Westley came up with later.<br/>except upside down and with buttons ( which is an insignificant differance) .

Looking at the Hayden layout shown on the McCann site you<br/>mentioned, clearly one can play a major scale on (for instance) e&apos;b,<br/>but not on d&apos;# (for which there isn&apos;t even a button) or d&apos;&apos;# (for<br/>which there&apos;s a button, but on the wrong end of a row).  Of course in<br/>12-equal that doesn&apos;t matter because d&apos;# is e&apos;b, but not so in 17- or<br/>19-equal.  So to have a generalized keyboard on which one can play<br/>scales in all 19 keys, longer rows would be needed, and I&apos;m pretty<br/>sure these would include enharmonic equivalents in 19-equal such as fx<br/>= gb and f# = gbb.</p><p>- Rich Holmes</p></div><h3><a id=8633 href="#8633">ðŸ”—</a>James Plamondon &#x3C;james@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2005 11:24:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gentlepersons,</p><p>The attachments stripped from my initial email can be found at:</p><p>            <a href="http://www.jamatronics.com/keyboards.pdf">www.jamatronics.com/keyboards.pdf</a></p><p>            <a href="http://www.jamatronics.com/19_Button.jpg">www.jamatronics.com/19_Button.jpg</a></p><p>I apologize for not realizing that these would be stripped from my<br/>email, and I encourage this group&apos;s members to check out the above<br/>documents.</p><p>To answer another question: yes, many Wicki/Hayden keyboards exist.</p><p>Wicki, being Swiss and having written his patent in German, had his<br/>greatest influence in Germany.  It is my understanding (input from a<br/>musical instrument historian would be welcome here) that many German<br/>migrants took their W/H-layout bandoneons to Argentina, where they<br/>became the typical instrument of the tango.  Because Wicki did not get<br/>an English patent, and the concertina was already in decline by the time<br/>of his Swiss patent (1896), the Wicki layout was unknown in England<br/>until Hayden discovered it independently 90 years later.</p><p>A number of small-scale manufacturers - Stagi, Morse, Dipper, Marcus,<br/>Dickinson, and one other whose name I&apos;ve misplaced -manufacture<br/>W/H-layout concertinas (invariably described as &quot;Hayden&quot; concertinas,<br/>since the Wicki patent was only &quot;discovered&quot; by Anglophones last year).</p><p>There are probably thousands of W/H-layout bandoneons and hundreds of<br/>W/H concertinas in active use.  These should not be confused with the<br/>&quot;Anglo&quot;-style concertinas used in Irish folk music!  The W/H-layout<br/>concertinas are of the fully-chromatic &quot;duet&quot; type.</p><p>The point is NOT that you need to learn about concertinas and bandoneons<br/>- you don&apos;t.  The point is that these instruments provide an &quot;existence<br/>proof&quot; that the W/H layout can be used for a wide variety of complex and<br/>challenging music.</p><p>Thanks!  :-)</p><p>--- James</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Kraig Grady [mailto:kraiggrady@...]<br/>Sent: Sunday, 23 January 2005 12:49 AM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Isomorphic Keyboards</p><p>The Hayden Keyboard is  what Westley came up with later.<br/>except upside down and with buttons ( which is an insignificant<br/>differance) .

Also, as a proficient pianist and intermediate-level<br/>generalized keyboard performer, I prefer the Wilsonian horizontal<br/>positioning of the diatonic tones, which of course remains the same<br/>for &quot;fully diatonic&quot; tunings (sorry I don&apos;t know the precise term),<br/>those that are 5 * whole step + 2 * half-step.

This is particularly useful for those N that provide a<br/>&gt; recognizable diatonic scale.

I<br/>understand<br/>&gt; that Erv Wilson has done a lot of work with generalized keyboards,<br/>but<br/>&gt; what I&apos;ve read of his work does not seem to parallel mine - unless<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; missing something, which is more than likely.  :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s take a moment to consider some of the other benefits<br/>provided by<br/>&gt; an instrument with two keyboards (one for each hand, optionally<br/>mirrored<br/>&gt; to reflect the mirroring of human hands), each with three-octave,<br/>&gt; 19-button-per-octave, W/H-optimized button-arrangements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) It places three octaves under the span of each hand, so - using<br/>both<br/>&gt; hands - you can select notes from across a six-octave range<br/>&gt; simultaneously.  That&apos;s about three times the span of two hands<br/>over a<br/>&gt; piano keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) You can press the two adjacent buttons sounding any given P4 or<br/>P5<br/>&gt; interval (or the three mutually-adjacent buttons sounding any<br/>given sus2<br/>&gt; or sus4 triad) simultaneously with a single fingertip.  Using one<br/>hand,<br/>&gt; one can play eight or more harmonious notes simultaneously.  Look<br/>at the<br/>&gt; W/H keyboard, and you&apos;ll see that this makes single-handed playing<br/>of<br/>&gt; highly-extended chords possible, without dropping notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because you can play lots of harmonious notes over a wide range on<br/>a<br/>&gt; Wicki/Hayden layout-based instrument, it is possible to play<br/>&gt; (essentially) full orchestra scores on it, whereas such scores<br/>have to<br/>&gt; be reduced significantly to be played on the piano.  This ability<br/>has<br/>&gt; been demonstrated by performers of W/H-based acoustic concertinas -<br/> it&apos;s<br/>&gt; real, not theoretical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) Because the W/H-based keyboards are so small, the entire two-<br/>keyboard<br/>&gt; (hence six octave) instrument can be remarkably tiny - about the<br/>size<br/>&gt; and weight of a thick paperback book, partially opened.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second question for the group is: if you presumed that such a<br/>&gt; six-octave, 19-button-per-octave, W/H-layout instrument had all the<br/>&gt; usual MIDI keyboard features, was Mac &amp; PC compatible, was<br/>compatible<br/>&gt; with both hardware and software synths, emitted data via all the<br/>usual<br/>&gt; physical &amp; wireless interfaces, was highly programmable, had<br/>&gt; velocity-sensitive keys and polyphonic aftertouch, supported OSC,<br/>and<br/>&gt; generally supported every other feature ever seen on any other<br/>&gt; MIDI-controller keyboard ever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; + Would you buy one?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; + What would it worth to you (i.e., what would you be both willing<br/>and<br/>&gt; capable of paying me for it), given its unique advantages,<br/>including its<br/>&gt; isomorphic support for microtonality?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; + What among the above described features is of greatest value to<br/>you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; + How many people do you think there are in the world who would<br/>buy one<br/>&gt; at that price for the same reason(s) you would?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; + How price-elastic to you think that demand is?  Alternatively<br/>put, by<br/>&gt; what percentage would I have to lower its price to sell twice as<br/>many,<br/>&gt; all else being equal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hoping that interested readers will respond to the group regarding<br/>&gt; novelty (question #1), and to me privately (james@p...)<br/>&gt; regarding the product/market/pricing issues (question #2), I am<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely Yours,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; James<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S.:  I am not able to supply any additional details about the<br/>proposed<br/>&gt; instrument at this time, but I would welcome your suggestions,<br/>sent to<br/>&gt; me privately.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.P.S.:  One feature request I know I&apos;ll get from this group is to<br/>&gt; deliver more than 19 buttons per octave.  Sorry, I can&apos;t do it.<br/>19 is<br/>&gt; the upper bound of what the human hand can span at maximum<br/>&gt; button-density - I&apos;ve checked.  In my proposed instrument, if you<br/>can&apos;t<br/>&gt; span it, you can&apos;t play it, so there&apos;s no point.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; one of the few around to have built one with engineering help: The<br/>&gt; Clavette<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin/clavett.htm">http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin/clavett.htm</a><br/>&gt; (a photo of the keys is posted up here in the Photos folder)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and I also own a Microzone, an 810 key generalized keyboard built<br/>&gt; and sold by Starr Labs (developed with input from Erv Wilson)<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.starrlabs.com/">http://www.starrlabs.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ll note that Starr Labs also has a smaller number-of-keys<br/>&gt; keyboard which could also be treated as a generalized keyboard,<br/>&gt; which should be much less than the Microzone (which I think today<br/>&gt; costs in the upper 4 figures).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I investigated various tunings, I found I did not want to be<br/>&gt; limited to a particular number of notes per octave, although I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t yet ventured beyond 31 /octave myself for practical<br/>reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would not want to discourage you from building your own dream<br/>&gt; keyboard, but the market of course is so far quite small for these<br/>&gt; devices, and of course your keyboard would not be suited to all-<br/>&gt; tones-of-the-scale &gt; 19-tone scales, unlike either the Microzone<br/>or<br/>&gt; Clavette. Also, as a proficient pianist and intermediate-level<br/>&gt; generalized keyboard performer, I prefer the Wilsonian horizontal<br/>&gt; positioning of the diatonic tones, which of course remains the<br/>same<br/>&gt; for &quot;fully diatonic&quot; tunings (sorry I don&apos;t know the precise<br/>term),<br/>&gt; those that are 5 * whole step + 2 * half-step. If you&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; understand more about the relations of tunings and their layouts<br/>on<br/>&gt; generalized (or potentially generalized keyboards like yours), you<br/>&gt; should speak to Erv Wilson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least before venturing into commercial production,<br/>&gt; you might be wise to meet with Harvey Starr and Erv Wilson. And in<br/>&gt; any case, the <a href="http://anaphoria.com">anaphoria.com</a> website of Kraig Grady could be a<br/>&gt; helpful resource, even if you&apos;re determined to keep your keyboard<br/>19-<br/>&gt; centric.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best of luck in your venture,<br/>&gt; Harold Fortuin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;James Plamondon&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;james@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Gentlepersons,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bill Sethares recommended that I share with you my recent work on<br/>&gt; &gt; isomorphic keyboards.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are many known keyboard layouts that have the same<br/>fingering<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; all 12-ET keys.

On an isomorphic<br/>&gt; keyboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; every occurrence of a given interval has the &quot;same shape&quot;<br/>wherever<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; occurs (edge conditions aside).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have attached a PDF file (&quot;Summary of Isomorphic Keyboard<br/>&gt; Layouts,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; 13K) that describes the essential characteristics that can be<br/>used<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; discriminate among all possible isomorphic keyboards.  I have<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt; attached an image of a three-octave, 19-button-per octave<br/>&gt; Wicki/Hayden<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard (19ButtonName.jpg, 194K).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Wicki/Hayden layout is a particularly interesting isomorphic<br/>&gt; layout<br/>&gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (a) it exposes the symmetry of the diatonic scale around the<br/>second<br/>&gt; &gt; degree of its Ionian mode (D in C Major)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (b) by sizing, spacing, and shaping the note-controlling buttons<br/>&gt; &gt; optimally (which is NOT shown in the attached JPG), one can fit a<br/>&gt; &gt; three-octave range of buttons within the span of a single hand&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; fingers, and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (c) it clusters the notes of the diatonic scale into a single<br/>&gt; &gt; multi-button column, flanked on either side by multi-button<br/>&gt; columns of<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic notes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By naming one such chromatic column&apos;s buttons using flat names,<br/>&gt; and the<br/>&gt; &gt; other using sharp names, the isomorphic fingering patterns of<br/>&gt; scales,<br/>&gt; &gt; chords, etc. can be consistent with traditional note-naming<br/>&gt; conventions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.maccann-duet.com/hayden/Hayden-The-Hayden-System.pdf">http://www.maccann-duet.com/hayden/Hayden-The-Hayden-System.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bill tells me that microtonalists might be particularly<br/>interested<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the observation that if any given isomorphic keyboard (not just<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; Wicki/Hayden) uses this system of enharmonic naming (flats on one<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;side,&quot; sharps on the other) then it will have the same pattern<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; note-names in every N-ET tuning if at least N buttons are<br/>included<br/>&gt; per<br/>&gt; &gt; octave.  This is particularly useful for those N that provide a<br/>&gt; &gt; recognizable diatonic scale.  The Wicki/Hayden keyboard displays<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; consistency especially clearly, due to its being vertically<br/>&gt; symmetrical<br/>&gt; &gt; around D.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; More specifically, an electronic instrument that used a<br/>&gt; &gt; 19-button-per-octave Wicki/Hayden keyboard layout (like that<br/>shown<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the attached JPG) would present the same pattern of note-names<br/>in<br/>&gt; 12-ET,<br/>&gt; &gt; 17-ET, and 19-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; + In 12-ET, the buttons labeled Cb and E# would be enharmonic<br/>with<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic (white) B and F buttons respectively; all of the other<br/>&gt; black<br/>&gt; &gt; buttons would be enharmonic with other black buttons (on the<br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt; side).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; + In 17-ET, Cb and E# would still be enharmonic with the<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; B and<br/>&gt; &gt; F respectively, but none of the other black buttons would be<br/>&gt; enharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; with any other.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; + In 19-ET, the keyboard would not have any enharmonic buttons;<br/>&gt; each<br/>&gt; &gt; button would control a unique pitch.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because such a keyboard would have the same fingering of diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; patterns (the diatonic scale, diatonic chords, etc.) in all such<br/>N-<br/>&gt; ET<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings, it would be an especially effective tool for introducing<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal novices to non-12 ET divisions of the octave.<br/>Indeed,<br/>&gt; if<br/>&gt; &gt; successful solely on its 12-ET-based merits, such an instrument<br/>&gt; could be<br/>&gt; &gt; the Trojan Horse that slips an hidden cargo of microtonality<br/>into<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; mainstream musical world.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The first question for this group is: is what I&apos;ve presented in<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; email and its attachments already known, or its it novel?  I<br/>&gt; understand<br/>&gt; &gt; that Erv Wilson has done a lot of work with generalized<br/>keyboards,<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; what I&apos;ve read of his work does not seem to parallel mine -<br/>unless<br/>&gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; missing something, which is more than likely.  :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s take a moment to consider some of the other benefits<br/>&gt; provided by<br/>&gt; &gt; an instrument with two keyboards (one for each hand, optionally<br/>&gt; mirrored<br/>&gt; &gt; to reflect the mirroring of human hands), each with three-octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; 19-button-per-octave, W/H-optimized button-arrangements.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) It places three octaves under the span of each hand, so -<br/>using<br/>&gt; both<br/>&gt; &gt; hands - you can select notes from across a six-octave range<br/>&gt; &gt; simultaneously.  That&apos;s about three times the span of two hands<br/>&gt; over a<br/>&gt; &gt; piano keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) You can press the two adjacent buttons sounding any given P4<br/>or<br/>&gt; P5<br/>&gt; &gt; interval (or the three mutually-adjacent buttons sounding any<br/>&gt; given sus2<br/>&gt; &gt; or sus4 triad) simultaneously with a single fingertip.  Using<br/>one<br/>&gt; hand,<br/>&gt; &gt; one can play eight or more harmonious notes simultaneously.<br/>Look<br/>&gt; at the<br/>&gt; &gt; W/H keyboard, and you&apos;ll see that this makes single-handed<br/>playing<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; highly-extended chords possible, without dropping notes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because you can play lots of harmonious notes over a wide range<br/>on<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; Wicki/Hayden layout-based instrument, it is possible to play<br/>&gt; &gt; (essentially) full orchestra scores on it, whereas such scores<br/>&gt; have to<br/>&gt; &gt; be reduced significantly to be played on the piano.

Also, as a proficient pianist and intermediate-level<br/>&gt; &gt; generalized keyboard performer, I prefer the Wilsonian<br/>horizontal<br/>&gt; &gt; positioning of the diatonic tones, which of course remains the<br/>&gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; for &quot;fully diatonic&quot; tunings (sorry I don&apos;t know the precise<br/>&gt; term),<br/>&gt; &gt; those that are 5 * whole step + 2 * half-step. If you&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; &gt; understand more about the relations of tunings and their layouts<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; generalized (or potentially generalized keyboards like yours),<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; should speak to Erv Wilson.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At least before venturing into commercial production,<br/>&gt; &gt; you might be wise to meet with Harvey Starr and Erv Wilson.

I have<br/>&gt; also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; attached an image of a three-octave, 19-button-per octave<br/>&gt; &gt; Wicki/Hayden<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; keyboard (19ButtonName.jpg, 194K).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Wicki/Hayden layout is a particularly interesting<br/>isomorphic<br/>&gt; &gt; layout<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (a) it exposes the symmetry of the diatonic scale around the<br/>&gt; second<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; degree of its Ionian mode (D in C Major)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (b) by sizing, spacing, and shaping the note-controlling<br/>buttons<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; optimally (which is NOT shown in the attached JPG), one can<br/>fit a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; three-octave range of buttons within the span of a single<br/>hand&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fingers, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (c) it clusters the notes of the diatonic scale into a single<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; multi-button column, flanked on either side by multi-button<br/>&gt; &gt; columns of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chromatic notes.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; By naming one such chromatic column&apos;s buttons using flat<br/>names,<br/>&gt; &gt; and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other using sharp names, the isomorphic fingering patterns of<br/>&gt; &gt; scales,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chords, etc. can be consistent with traditional note-naming<br/>&gt; &gt; conventions.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.maccann-duet.com/hayden/Hayden-The-Hayden-System.pdf">http://www.maccann-duet.com/hayden/Hayden-The-Hayden-System.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill tells me that microtonalists might be particularly<br/>&gt; interested<br/>&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the observation that if any given isomorphic keyboard (not<br/>just<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wicki/Hayden) uses this system of enharmonic naming (flats on<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;side,&quot; sharps on the other) then it will have the same<br/>pattern<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; note-names in every N-ET tuning if at least N buttons are<br/>&gt; included<br/>&gt; &gt; per<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octave.  This is particularly useful for those N that provide a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; recognizable diatonic scale.  The Wicki/Hayden keyboard<br/>displays<br/>&gt; &gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; consistency especially clearly, due to its being vertically<br/>&gt; &gt; symmetrical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; around D.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; More specifically, an electronic instrument that used a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19-button-per-octave Wicki/Hayden keyboard layout (like that<br/>&gt; shown<br/>&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the attached JPG) would present the same pattern of note-names<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-ET,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 17-ET, and 19-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + In 12-ET, the buttons labeled Cb and E# would be enharmonic<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; diatonic (white) B and F buttons respectively; all of the<br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt; black<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; buttons would be enharmonic with other black buttons (on the<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; side).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + In 17-ET, Cb and E# would still be enharmonic with the<br/>&gt; diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; B and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; F respectively, but none of the other black buttons would be<br/>&gt; &gt; enharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with any other.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + In 19-ET, the keyboard would not have any enharmonic<br/>buttons;<br/>&gt; &gt; each<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; button would control a unique pitch.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because such a keyboard would have the same fingering of<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; patterns (the diatonic scale, diatonic chords, etc.) in all<br/>such<br/>&gt; N-<br/>&gt; &gt; ET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tunings, it would be an especially effective tool for<br/>introducing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; microtonal novices to non-12 ET divisions of the octave.<br/>&gt; Indeed,<br/>&gt; &gt; if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; successful solely on its 12-ET-based merits, such an<br/>instrument<br/>&gt; &gt; could be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Trojan Horse that slips an hidden cargo of microtonality<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mainstream musical world.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The first question for this group is: is what I&apos;ve presented<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; email and its attachments already known, or its it novel?  I<br/>&gt; &gt; understand<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that Erv Wilson has done a lot of work with generalized<br/>&gt; keyboards,<br/>&gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what I&apos;ve read of his work does not seem to parallel mine -<br/>&gt; unless<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; missing something, which is more than likely.  :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let&apos;s take a moment to consider some of the other benefits<br/>&gt; &gt; provided by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an instrument with two keyboards (one for each hand,<br/>optionally<br/>&gt; &gt; mirrored<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to reflect the mirroring of human hands), each with three-<br/>octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19-button-per-octave, W/H-optimized button-arrangements.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) It places three octaves under the span of each hand, so -<br/>&gt; using<br/>&gt; &gt; both<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hands - you can select notes from across a six-octave range<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneously.  That&apos;s about three times the span of two<br/>hands<br/>&gt; &gt; over a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; piano keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) You can press the two adjacent buttons sounding any given<br/>P4<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; P5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval (or the three mutually-adjacent buttons sounding any<br/>&gt; &gt; given sus2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or sus4 triad) simultaneously with a single fingertip.  Using<br/>&gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; hand,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one can play eight or more harmonious notes simultaneously.<br/>&gt; Look<br/>&gt; &gt; at the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; W/H keyboard, and you&apos;ll see that this makes single-handed<br/>&gt; playing<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; highly-extended chords possible, without dropping notes.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because you can play lots of harmonious notes over a wide<br/>range<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wicki/Hayden layout-based instrument, it is possible to play<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (essentially) full orchestra scores on it, whereas such scores<br/>&gt; &gt; have to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be reduced significantly to be played on the piano.  This<br/>&gt; ability<br/>&gt; &gt; has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; been demonstrated by performers of W/H-based acoustic<br/>&gt; concertinas -<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; real, not theoretical.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Because the W/H-based keyboards are so small, the entire<br/>two-<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (hence six octave) instrument can be remarkably tiny - about<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; size<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and weight of a thick paperback book, partially opened.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The second question for the group is: if you presumed that<br/>such a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; six-octave, 19-button-per-octave, W/H-layout instrument had<br/>all<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; usual MIDI keyboard features, was Mac &amp; PC compatible, was<br/>&gt; &gt; compatible<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with both hardware and software synths, emitted data via all<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; usual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; physical &amp; wireless interfaces, was highly programmable, had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; velocity-sensitive keys and polyphonic aftertouch, supported<br/>&gt; OSC,<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; generally supported every other feature ever seen on any other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; MIDI-controller keyboard ever.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + Would you buy one?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + What would it worth to you (i.e., what would you be both<br/>&gt; willing<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of paying me for it), given its unique advantages,<br/>&gt; &gt; including its<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; isomorphic support for microtonality?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + What among the above described features is of greatest value<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; you?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + How many people do you think there are in the world who<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; buy one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at that price for the same reason(s) you would?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; + How price-elastic to you think that demand is?<br/>Alternatively<br/>&gt; &gt; put, by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what percentage would I have to lower its price to sell twice<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; many,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all else being equal?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hoping that interested readers will respond to the group<br/>&gt; regarding<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty (question #1), and to me privately (james@p...)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the product/market/pricing issues (question #2), I am<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely Yours,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; James<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.:  I am not able to supply any additional details about<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; proposed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instrument at this time, but I would welcome your suggestions,<br/>&gt; &gt; sent to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me privately.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; P.P.S.:  One feature request I know I&apos;ll get from this group<br/>is<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; deliver more than 19 buttons per octave.  Sorry, I can&apos;t do<br/>it.<br/>&gt; &gt; 19 is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the upper bound of what the human hand can span at maximum<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; button-density - I&apos;ve checked.  In my proposed instrument, if<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; span it, you can&apos;t play it, so there&apos;s no point.
