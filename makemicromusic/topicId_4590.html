Any recommendations as to<br/>&gt;makes and models?</p><p>Heya Alison,</p><p>I&apos;ve been laptop-only for almost 3 years.  I have an IBM Thinkpad X20.<br/>About to upgrade to a Dell D600.  Typically Toshiba, Sony and IBM make<br/>the best laptops.  As for models, it depends what you like.  I go for<br/>compact models so I can carry them easily, but they cost a lot more.  No<br/>model has any sound advantage over another -- the native sound on<br/>laptops is uniformly bad.  But one can run a softsynth or easily attach<br/>a USB sound module.</p><p>If you do scoring on a computer, screen resolution is really important.<br/>I&apos;d recommend at least 1400x1050.</p><p>Other than that, one would be advised to get a laptop with Intel&apos;s<br/>&quot;Centrino&quot; logo, for various reasons.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2003 1:36:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison,<br/>Laptops... For me, Toshiba Satellite series seemed best disk size &amp; memory<br/>for the money in comparable models. Bought mine a year ago.</p><p>As for microtonality on OSX, I think there&apos;s very little. For most small<br/>developers, unless they are developing exclusively for Mac, there isn&apos;t any<br/>bang-for-the-buck. It&apos;s a minority platform. The tools that Mac does have<br/>are often really great tools, but for variety you have to go to a majority<br/>platform where developers can make a return on their investment...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;jdrodrigues@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2003 6:27:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wednesday, April 30, 2003, at 03:02 , <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: OS X and microtonality</p><p>Hi Alison, the major ones I know of are :</p><p>Reaktor and Max/MSP.

After much deliberation I&apos;ve decided<br/>that portability is desirable but not essential so I&apos;m looking at some nice<br/>PC desktops with good soundcards. If anyone has any recommendations I&apos;ll<br/>gladly take them on board.</p><p>I look forward to using some of the new softsynths recently mentioned on<br/>this list, They&apos;ve been getting good reviews in one UK magazine at least,<br/>though not for their microtonal potential.</p><p>There seems to be quite a buzz about new software with users abandoning<br/>hardware systems. I can see the point as it&apos;s taken me two days and nights<br/>to rearrange and repatch my hardware/midi studio. I&apos;ll give it 6 months<br/>alongside a softsynth system to compare the two.</p><p>Thanks again</p><p>Regards<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2003 11:14:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 30/4/03 2:27 pm, Joel Rodrigues at jdrodrigues@... wrote:</p><p>On Wednesday, April 30, 2003, at 03:02 ,<br/><a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: OS X and microtonality</p><p>Hi Alison, the major ones I know of are :</p><p>Reaktor and Max/MSP.
