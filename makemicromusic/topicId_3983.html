Still quite<br/>a steep learning curve I think but get the<br/>impression that having it to hand may be<br/>pretty useful when learning C-Sound.</p><p>Something I&apos;d like to do at some point, at least to study it<br/>a bit to get an idea how it works and think about whether<br/>a direct save of FTS tunes to C-sound<br/>may be useful. I gather you can<br/>covert midi files to C-sound but that<br/>won&apos;t take advantage of it&apos;s unlimited<br/>pitch polyphony, which FTS would be<br/>able to exploit in a direct save<br/>if I implement it. That would be the big attraction of<br/>C-sound for me.</p><p>Also, it seems like a good one to<br/>recommend for beginner C-sounders and<br/>have mentioned it on the FTS download page.<br/>But, wondered about what it is like, if<br/>you happen to have tried it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2002 2:59:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Gene</p><p>Sorry, just looked again, the test one was just the one that I selected last time<br/>I ran winsound, and not a Cecilia one at all. Sorry to mislead everyone<br/>about that.</p><p>There are many examples listed here though</p><p><a href="http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linux_csound.html">http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/linux_csound.html</a></p><p>Many don&apos;t need samples I know that for sure.</p><p>I&apos;ve just downloaded one and tested it and it worked</p><p>I went here<br/><a href="http://www.computermusic.ch/archive_d.html#anchor1399158">http://www.computermusic.ch/archive_d.html#anchor1399158</a></p><p>and downloaded soprano.orc and soprano.sco (the first ones)</p><p>It downloaded as html for some reason so I had to edit the<br/>files to remove some html junk (i mean junk as far as C-sound is<br/>concerned) at the start and end,<br/>and change the file extension to .sco and .orc respectively.</p><p>After that, it worked fine. See if you have any html junk<br/>at the start of the one you are trying.</p><p>BTW just came across a CSound VST:</p><p><a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~gogins/Silence/CsoundVST.htm">http://www.pipeline.com/~gogins/Silence/CsoundVST.htm</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2002 3:19:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I went here<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.computermusic.ch/archive_d.html#anchor1399158">http://www.computermusic.ch/archive_d.html#anchor1399158</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and downloaded soprano.orc and soprano.sco (the first ones)</p><p>It worked!
