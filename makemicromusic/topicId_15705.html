I hope to all concern that they can recognize the difference between following different ideas can be so a separate thing from admiring someones work when it happens.</p><p>microstick@... wrote:<br/>&gt;     Kraig...I agree 100% that the roots of soul are African, Mid Eastern...I said, in my post, referring to the swing concept of time that is essential to jazz/blues/funk: &quot;It comes, essentially, from African and Middle Eastern roots...&quot;   best...Hstick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
