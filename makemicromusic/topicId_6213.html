This is nowhere near the parts of the manual that talk about<br/>scales/tuning. It controls, for each oscillator, the slope of the<br/>graph of keyboard position (on the x-axis) vs. pitch (on the y-axis).<br/>The slope can be set to any value from -1.0 to +2.0 in increments of<br/>0.1. So setting the slope to 0.5 causes the keyboard, in &quot;equal<br/>temperament&quot; tuning, to play 24-equal instead of 12-equal.</p><p>Oddly, -99 to +99 cent offsets in the user tunings are applied<br/>*after* this &quot;pitch slope&quot; adjustment, not before as one would expect.</p><p>So to acheive a half-octave of 22-equal, one simply programs the<br/>offsets from the half-octave of 24-equal that one needs -- 11 offsets<br/>altogether, key E is left out.</p><p>Literally, this is how one inputs the user octave tuning (by turning<br/>the dial on each note until the correct number is shown):</p><p>C: +9<br/>C#: +14<br/>D: +23<br/>D#: +28<br/>E: WHATEVER<br/>F: -28<br/>F#: -23<br/>G: -14<br/>G#: -9<br/>A: -5<br/>A#: 0<br/>B: +5</p><p>And then, a pitch slope is 0.5 is used, so each keyboard octave will<br/>sound as as half-octave -- and the 22-equal mapping is complete!</p><p>For a full 31-equal that doesn&apos;t skip any keys, you need to use<br/>the &quot;user all notes scale&quot;. Set the pitch slope to 0.4, which gives<br/>you 30-equal, and apply the necessary offsets from there.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, we&apos;ve been having loads of fun playing lots of timbres<br/>with a<br/>&gt; &gt;9-note Mavila (formerly Pelogic) tuning -- not just kalimba sounds<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt;even string sounds work fantastically with it . . . look forward<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;hearing examples in the next month or two . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Care to post a .scl of that file, unless it is already listed in<br/>Scala?</p><p>Since the idea draws on familiar keyboard patterns, I&apos;ll show how the<br/>tuning is implemented as cent offsets from 12-equal. When this is<br/>done, the notes aren&apos;t in order of pitch anymore so I&apos;m not sure how<br/>to best express that as an .scl. The pitch slope is back to normal<br/>(+1.0) for this:</p><p>C: +46<br/>C#: WHATEVER<br/>D: 0<br/>D#: WHATEVER<br/>E: -46<br/>F: +69<br/>F#: -92<br/>G: +23<br/>G#: WHATEVER<br/>A: -23<br/>Bb: +92<br/>B: -69</p><p>&gt; &gt;ENANTIODROMIA . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t even guess...</p><p>I discussed this on other lists, and the relevant posts will help you<br/>understand what we&apos;re doing with this Mavila (formerly Pelogic)<br/>tuning. Though they were not original to him, Erv Wilson was the one<br/>who applied the words &quot;Mavila&quot; and &quot;Enantiodromia&quot; to this tuning and<br/>this process.</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52727">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/52727</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1557">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1557</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1558">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1558</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1562">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1562</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1566">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/SpecMus/message/1566</a></p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
