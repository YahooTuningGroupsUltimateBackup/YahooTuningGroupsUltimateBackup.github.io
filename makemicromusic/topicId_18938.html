In an<br/>environment like 12-tET, everything is on the one hand completely<br/>tonal, as there is no tone without a corresponding perfect 2/1 and<br/>near-perfect 3/2 of &lt;2 cents difference from the harmonic series, and<br/>on the other hand completely atonal as there are no other harmonic,<br/>in the literal sense, intervals other than those derived very<br/>directly from inversions and small stackings of the aforementioned<br/>intervals.</p><p>(Possible harmonic, in the literal sense again, identities such as<br/>19/16 with the m3 are a whole different discussion).</p><p>Continuing: in 12-tET, E# and F are the same damn thing. They are NOT<br/>the same thing in the bulk of Western music. Even in nominally 12-tET<br/>music, they are not the same. They are different pitches. Only if we<br/>limit music to fixed-pitch 12-tET instruments are they the same pitch.<br/>In the world of voices, reeds, brass, strings and even quality<br/>synthesis and sampling, E# and F are NOT the same pitch.</p><p>The M3 above C# is NOT F, it is E#. It is a different frequency.<br/>Schillnger&apos;s transformations such as you posted before, in the way<br/>you are applying them (ie., on a fixed-pitch synth rather than say<br/>Glenn Miller&apos;s wind section) work on the assumption that there is NO<br/>true D##, E, Fbb, E#, Fb, or F, but two acoustically approximate<br/>&quot;symbols&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, doing multiple duty as all six (and more, in<br/>the grand scheme).</p><p>Due to...circumstances? my &quot;Western common practice&quot; education is<br/>fundamentally pre-War. I know from drilled physical experience (&quot;do<br/>that again! Ti is sharp when going to Do!&quot;) that at the time<br/>Schillinger was rolling, 12-tET was understood as symbolic. Glenn<br/>Miller&apos;s winds were NOT interpreting Schillinger ideas on a synth<br/>with 12 fixed pitches to the octave, as you can hear to this day on a<br/>recording.</p><p>You might want to think this over a good long time. Or not.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
