I can warn away aspiring composers from<br/>&gt;  the software discussed here to more useable and proletarian programs<br/>&gt;  consistent with their lack of programming savvy.</p><p>Csound was my first real programming experience.</p><p>Also, it is very much a compositional tool, because its forte is in<br/>sculpting timbres.  It feels very much like improvisation or jamming<br/>to me, even if I have to wait a few seconds while it&apos;s rendering in<br/>order for the &quot;feedback loop&quot; to complete.</p><p>I&apos;m not picking a fight, :) and I understand that csound isn&apos;t the<br/>tool for everyone; I just wanted to offer that your description and<br/>experience of the program did not match my own.</p><p>-Chris</p></div>
