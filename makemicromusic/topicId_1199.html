General<br/>idea is that one makes larger scales by joining one chord to<br/>another, each being a pythagorean diatonic subdivision<br/>of a sixth (T T S T T), then depending on which notes connected to which<br/>one could get comma shifts when passing from one tetrachord to<br/>another. Is that roughly what you have in mind?</p><p>I notice also that Eb is particularly given as a note - I suppose<br/>you get that rather easily by joining a hexachord mi to the<br/>the Sol of the one in C.</p><p>Anyway, I think the idea of a kind of fragment scale rather than<br/>complete octave, and transiting from one fragment to another by<br/>comma shifts, is rather what it sounds like.</p><p>In this little phrase, there is no kind of compelling logical reason<br/>for including a comma shift when playing the notes of hte Eb hexachord,<br/>as none of the notes in the comma shifted fragment are linked in any<br/>kind of a very definite way with the c based hexachord, except that it felt<br/>/ sounded beautiful.</p><p>&gt; Just playing the theme you&apos;ve noted on keyboard, not necessarily in<br/>&gt; the best rhythm or with the expression you give it, suggests to me the<br/>&gt; beginning of a beautiful improvisation. I&apos;d love to hear this, maybe<br/>&gt; on CD or cassette.</p><p>I&apos;d like to make one for you to hear. I don&apos;t have a CD writer at the<br/>moment, but it seems such a useful thing to have that I think I<br/>might splash out on one.</p><p>Then I could do a CD of some of my music with this improv.</p><p>I&apos;ve just done an improvisatino in 13-tet - see next msg.</p><p>&gt; May I just say that this looks like a wonderful feature, because<br/>&gt; placing two scales at some arbitrary interval to each other is one<br/>&gt; very creative approach to arrive at new tunings which have old or<br/>&gt; familiar intervals also. I hope that FTS users really enjoy this, and<br/>&gt; play with it to come up with possibilities we might not guess in<br/>&gt; advance.</p><p>Great. Yes, I think that is it, the way one can combine old and new<br/>intervals together, and I hope they really enjoy it too.</p><p>For FTS users - I&apos;ve done this by adding a new option to the TRacks<br/>window which lets one transpose any of the tracks by any interval one<br/>likes (not necessarily in the scale or mode) - one can also do it<br/>using the Scales for tracks window, but this is quicker to change<br/>as one just needs to type in the new interval of transposition for the<br/>track in the Tracks window.</p><p>I.e. just select Margo&apos;s scale as the preset, then go to the Tracks...<br/>window and edit the interval of transposition. I&apos;ll explain this in<br/>the help for the presets when I update it.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
