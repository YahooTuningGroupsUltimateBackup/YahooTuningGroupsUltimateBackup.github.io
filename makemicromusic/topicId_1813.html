There are good people in MMM, who can probably help, but let me mention a couple of things (this is good for _all_ to know).</p><p>&gt;i will say hello to you if you help me.</p><p>No bargains, just sharing. Besides, telling us a little bit about yourself will make it easier to help!</p><p>&gt;pls teachme about equipment ineed for instance soundcard, instrument, &gt;software...</p><p>When asking a question like this, it is *much* more easy to be of assistance if we have more to go on, such as:</p><p>- what computer platform/OS are you using - many tools are for particular setups<br/>- are you interested in making microtonal music electronically, with acoustic instruments, or a combination<br/>- what kind of musical background do you have, so we can gear our language and ideas to your level of experience</p><p>&gt;and what is good among them, and what i must learn for making micmusic (i &gt;have learnt logic and basic harmonic theory)</p><p>Well, what is &quot;good&quot; may be influenced by my preceding questions, and what you must learn depends a lot on what you know already! For instance: is &quot;logic&quot; the formal concept, as in math/statistics, or are you referring to the computer audio program &quot;Logic&quot;? I know, it&apos;s confusing, but sometimes these are the kind of clarifications that can really help.</p><p>&gt;plspls hhelp///..</p><p>You&apos;ll probably find it, but maybe one last bit of advice: your choice of email names/addresses might make people a bit hesitant to get involved, so if its all benign and just something you&apos;ve got for fun, posting a message with a little more background on yourself, your musical interests, and stuff like that will help people feel more comfortable in jumping in with advice. I&apos;ve been involved long enough with mailing lists to understand anyone else&apos;s hesitancy to speak up, because you just never know...</p><p>Anyhow, welcome to the group, and we&apos;d look forward to hearing more.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (sometimes known as &quot;ListMom&quot;)</p></div>
