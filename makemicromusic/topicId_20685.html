It was nothing but the mere matter of observing who has been attracted to microtonality. He has had contact with many people over many years. while many of these have been negative, i did not find it so in this case. Which was lifted from elsewhere and not sent to the list in the first place. How could this be an attack on anyone here?</p><p>Historically microtonality remained of a side interest until the work of Harry Partch. The people quoted on the site below are directly from his work. Johnson then Gann.</p><p>dare i point out that the above school would have never been the appeal that brought me to microtonality. nor Brian&apos;s to be fair. But if someone approached me and i found out they thought the way of either, that is where i would direct them. to send them there at the offset  might actually turn them off. There were others who i met before Wilson and i was left with no interest at all in pursuiting it.</p><p>I have never met anyone in person who was interested in microtonality in doing &apos;common practice&apos; harmony which is BMcL point. At least not composers. I do not say it is impossible nor would Brian.</p><p>There is nothing to be gained by people doing microtones that don&apos;t need them. There are whole movements in the musical world who have no interest in pitch at all. It is not nor should it be a religion or substitute for it. nor should it be trivialized by being used as some type of fashion label.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>robert thomas martin wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Teaching microtonality from the familiar to the exotic appears to be a &gt; logical way to proceed for the people at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory27.htm">http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory27.htm</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory27.htm">http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory27.htm</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And Dolmetsch will exert a far greater influence than the negative<br/>&gt; thoughts of a single, disillusioned microtonalist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
