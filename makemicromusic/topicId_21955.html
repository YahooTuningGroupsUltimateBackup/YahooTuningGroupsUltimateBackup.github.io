I think Steve Vai and Prince are quite good...but know fairly few people who have also &quot;made it big&quot; who use them as influences for how/why they compose or set up their equipment...sadly they fall into the bin of &quot;semi-popular musicians&quot;.  People like Joe Satriani (also highly experimental at times) and Pat Metheny have similar &quot;problems&quot;, IMVHO...they have a select few musicians who praise and follow them almost religiously, but that&apos;s it and those few are unlikely to get &quot;huge&quot; enough to have major influence or bring mass-spread public awareness.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve had many people over the years who genuinely like my music, but<br/>none of them have went out and got a 19 tone axe yet. A common theme I<br/>hear is &quot;Well, I have enough trouble with 12 tones,&quot;</p><p>    I see a huge potential for things like guitar pedals designed to re-tune notes to micro-tonal scales.  This shouldn&apos;t be too hard to do with 7-tone scales...all you have to do is tell the pedal what key you are in and it reassigns notes by number in the scale IE the root tone of D (from 12TET) and overtones would be multiplied by the second note of the new scale of the frequency of D.</p><p>    A real limit on micro-tonality is that the most popular acoustic instruments (IE fretted guitars, trumpets, saxophones...) come with pre-set notes and changing them often requires purchasing another instrument and re-learning the new &quot;fingering&quot; for said instrument.  Getting an external device to do the retuning before amplification would be a huge stride toward easy accessibility of micro-tonal scales, IMVHO.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>   Another way to make composing micro-tonal music more accessible that comes to my mind is to concentrate on making scales where virtually all combinations of dyads sound fairly consonant.  That way<br/>A) Any chord in the traditional 7-tone diatonic scale has a near-equivalent that can be played more or less the same way using said-above &quot;retuning pedal&quot;.<br/>B) As a plus, chords and melodic progressions that were considered &quot;illegal&quot; or at least &quot;too odd for live use&quot; under standard types of 12TET theory become possible.</p><p>    This would help refute the old &quot;12 tones is hard enough&quot; argument by letting musicians take advantage of virtually all their old knowledge and gain some easy options they never had before.  I guess you could say that&apos;s why I&apos;ve been so obsessed lately with 7-tone scales with<br/>1) virtually all dyads, especially the minor 2nd and 7th ones, sounding pure enough to be used as non-neighboring tones thus becoming available for virtually any type of chord and<br/>2) mirrored intervals (ALA Cameron&apos;s idea)<br/>   I&apos;m working on proving the validity of such a scale in a new song I&apos;m writing for a competition loaded with 7-note chords and even 9-tone chords (if you don&apos;t count notes harmonizing several octaves up/down IE C4 and C7) and I found easier to compose than songs in 12TET while (when needed) it matches traditional 7-note diatonic interval classes decently and doesn&apos;t seem to leave you &quot;missing out on the mood of a certain 7-tone Western tone&quot;.<br/>-------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;Both Catler and I have done what could be called &quot;accessible&quot; music,<br/>rock/blues oriented stuff, and we&apos;ve had favorable reviews in mags such<br/>as Guitar Player, Downbeat, and others...it hasn&apos;t translated yet into<br/>large CD sales, or other artists getting on board in any significant<br/>manner.&quot;</p><p>    And you both do very well...but, sadly, often it&apos;s the corporate networking and look....and not the quality of composition....that drives influence in the musical world.  How many kids don&apos;t know of Robert Johnson yet listen to rock (as a derivative of blues) plenty?....<br/>     The sad fact is blues doesn&apos;t have the sort of traction harder rock and pop rock does so far as popularity and social influence nowadays.  Heck neither does punk or some of my personal favorite genres like liquid drum and bass and deep house.</p><p>    Bridging the gap would likely mean getting someone like Carrie Underwood or Beyonce to sing in micro-tones or Nickelback to use them.  You know...the kind of crappy groups we complain about when we say things like &quot; current &quot;pop&quot; music is in a dreadful state, very corporate in most ways&quot;.   Eventually the major labels are going to die (heck, we&apos;re already down to 3 from 5)...but the one thing they have is that even people who hate them have excellent marketing awareness of them and to be realistic, I think making micro-tonal music more widespread will have to involve broadcasting through them.</p><p>     Say Ibanez came up with a pedal that translated tones to micro-tones (ALA the &quot;micro-tone pedal&quot; described above) or E-bow came up with a similar product.  And that produce actually would not output/send-to-the-amplifier 12TET, only micro-tonal scales.   And then said guitar company asked a major artist if he/she would use the guitar in gigs in exchange for pay as an advertiser.  Then the artist would use the pedal, perhaps confused by it at first, but over time be likely to get used to the idea, like the sound, and finally pop the question back to the manufacturer &quot;why don&apos;t you make more of these?!&quot; and start composing with micro-tonal tools by choice.  That sort of thing, IMVHO, is when the revolution will truly begin.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Jay Rinkel &#x3C;jrinkel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2010 6:23:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I had an acoustic guitar modified to be 19edo ... sometime after I heard<br/>your music ... does that count? :-)</p><p>Jay</p><p>On Wed, 2010-03-17 at 10:36 -0600, Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; interested...but to what degree is another matter.

Many of the Just, mean-tone (including 31tet) and Pythagorean etc tunings sound only marginally different from 12tet. This sound difference is so marginal to the ears of some Western musicians that they say &quot;Who cares? Close enough is good enough. I think I&apos;ll stick to 12tet&quot;. But these same musicians recognise that Middle Eastern music does sound significantly different and can achieve enormous popularity.<br/>  Even though I personally prefer using the harmonics of the 6th octave I don&apos;t have any problems with 24tet which is capable of achieving strikingly different sounds as compared to 12tet.<br/>  The fact that many Middle Eastern musicians don&apos;t actually play in true 24tet doesn&apos;t really mean anything because many Western string players and singers don&apos;t actually play or sing in true 12tet.<br/>  The fuzzy nature of 12tet perception can quite easily evolve into a fuzzy 24tet perception.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2010 1:50:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:11 PM 3/19/2010, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On 3/19/2010 1:02 PM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Now it is simply the case that music as<br/>&gt;&gt; a whole is unpopular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hmmm...

I wouldn&apos;t use data like that to try proving that music isn&apos;t popular anymore.

Kids, once the big market, have learned to tap it for free.</p><p>&gt; Live performance is the new revenue stream, but hasn&apos;t made up the difference yet.</p><p>It never will catch up or make up the diff. The &quot;big band&quot; era is over, and recording is the new media.</p><p>&gt; We all hear that music programs keep getting cut from public<br/>&gt; schools.  Anybody have any info on that?<br/>&gt;    Yeah, in my kids&apos; district a few years back (they&apos;re all grown up now), the parents paid for the music program, and they still do. Music programs are not cut because music is unpopular, they are cut because they are one of the &quot;least painful&quot; things to cut when the state is taking a nose-dive and people no longer want to pay for kids&apos; educations. Same with art programs, but do we say that &quot;art is not popular&quot;. Every kid draws pictures! Popularity of a field has nothing to do with what gets cut in schools when there&apos;s a budget crisis. It&apos;s the perceived utility as &quot;education&quot;. On the other hand, among people who *want* their kids to be educated, music education is *extremely* popular because music is thought to foster brain development, blah blah, and people who &quot;want the best for their kids&quot; are definitely shelling out for private lessons.</p><p>&gt; In my personal sphere, and it may be because I&apos;m getting older,<br/>&gt; but I don&apos;t know of anyone who actively buys music and listens<br/>&gt; to it, and several of the musicians/bands I know are on hiatus.<br/>&gt;    I buy, and listen. But I&apos;m an old geezer now. In the past 10 years, I buy almost all used CDs, and a smattering of MP3 online through Amazon and CD Baby. I almost never buy new CDs because in part I know that the money isn&apos;t really going to the band anyway. If it was well known and fixed up so that bands got 50% of the cover price, I&apos;d be buying all my music new and supporting the musicians.</p><p>OK, my kids: mostly downloading who knows what, but they do buy some music. They definitely are listening, all the time.</p><p>&gt; I also can&apos;t think of a home stereo without a bigscreen TV<br/>&gt; attached, outside of Berkeley.<br/>&gt;    I have one, in San Jose! ;-) Well, I take that back. It has a little-screen TV because: my beautiful stereo amp died last year and I had to replace it, so I replaced it with an all-in-one system that plays DVD and CD and has 5 speakers and a subwoofer. Because of that, it has a little-screen TV attached to it. Unfortunate, but the fact was: the pretty decent all-in-one was cheaper than just replacing the amp.</p><p>&gt; When I grew up we all had stereo systems in our bedrooms, which<br/>&gt; we poured over in extended listening sessions.  I understand the<br/>&gt; computer is the new listening zone, but I can&apos;t help but feel<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a poor substitute (browsing online while listening?).<br/>&gt;    Yes, same when I was growing up. Both of my kids listen on laptops. Either with headphones or just through the laptop speakers. Constant music, though. It&apos;s always going. Oh, and my daughter plays double bass in the local college orchestra (without being parentally forced to do so).</p><p>&gt; Perhaps I&apos;ll learn more when my kids get to be teens.<br/>&gt;    Heh heh. Yup. :-)</p><p>&gt; On the classical side, I know that the nation&apos;s orchestras have been hurting too.</p><p>Absolutely: the big band era is over. It&apos;s too expensive to have orchestras be a medium for ordinary listeners on their night out. Clubs, opera, orchestra, etc. Ensemble size dropped pretty obviously since the demise of the big bands of the 40s... Also, aside: Personally, I don&apos;t go to symphony concerts because I can&apos;t stand loud audiences coughing if I seriously want to listen to the music; and they don&apos;t play a lot of what I personally want to hear live, because they have to play to the biggest audience. (I want to hear &quot;maximalist&quot; orchestral music written well after 1900, at least, and may be a few &quot;rare gems&quot; of the old schools thrown in for seasoning oncein a while. That&apos;s not the kind of programming we see at the local symphonies.) I do, however, spend a lot of money each year to attend live opera, chamber music, and early music, mostly in small venues. (Yes! Opera in small venues: I&apos;ve been a season subscriber to Pocket Opera for maybe 15 years. It&apos;s a way of life.)</p><p>&gt; I also know that there is currently no explosive genre, like<br/>&gt; indie rock and jam bands were a few years ago.</p><p>Totally true. I can agree with that...</p><p>This is a low period culturally for music making and a bit for music consumption, for a variety of reasons. But saying music isn&apos;t popular is a bit much. Go down the street in any city and ask each person, &quot;do you ever listen to music&quot;? I&apos;d bet you get 75% &quot;yes&quot;, at least, no matter where you are.</p><p>What you really mean, I think, is that paying for music is less popular than it once was.

The *last* thing they would ever do, no matter how tight the budget, is get rid of an athletic program.

This is especially an issue/problem with trying to convince people to play 19+TET scales, the thought that pops up in people&apos;s mind of the finger arrangements needed is much like the cartoon sketch of Neil on <a href="http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vcGhvdG9idWNrZXQuY29t">http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vcGhvdG9idWNrZXQuY29t</a> and it intimidates a lot of people.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The chords for 7 note equal temperament guitar are basicly the same shapes as for 12 note equal temperament.&quot;<br/>  That does seem to be a logical way to introduce micro-tonal.  Or, perhaps even better yet, use double-tetrachord based scales that merge near 12TET such as 18:20:22:24:27:30:33:36 (which often sound more consonant than 7TET and often as good or better than typical 7-note modes of 12TET).  The best ones I&apos;ve found so far are based on Ptolemy&apos;s &quot;Homalon&quot; ratios.</p><p>&gt;&quot;5 and 7 note equal temperaments make it almost physically impossible to play notes that clash with each other.&quot;<br/>   I&apos;ll agree somewhat.  5TET I&apos;d say is neither consonant nor dissonant...but does indeed avoid the hard dissonance possible by a not-so-trained composer in 12TET.  The downside to 5TET is there are several pentatonic scales under 12TET that can do the same thing IE &quot;no sour chords possible&quot; and do so with more consonance...although I agree &quot;no possible clashing notes&quot; is a good goal toward which to build scales through which we should all try to use to introduce micro-tonal to the general public.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The main disadvantage seems to me that there is no distinction between<br/>major and minor chords, but you can change between sustained fourths or<br/>seconds and normal triads to give a similar feel.&quot;<br/>  Again, my suggestion would be switch to things like tetrachord-based scales that merge near 7TET.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Another idea I am think of persuing is fixed fingerboard microtonic<br/>ukeleles in 5, 7 or 10 note equal temperament (as mentionned above).&quot;<br/>   I will say one thing (again)...anything TET is easier to make instruments for than non-equal temperament scales.  However it&apos;s not like non-TET-based instruments are impossible to make...I believe Kraig Grady has designed quite a few, for example.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2010 10:54:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael,</p><p>Good stuff in your responses.

People just don&apos;t listen to music that intently.&quot;</p><p>    I think it has to do more with confidence of music than anything else...and the problem being that people are taught to view only certain intervals in 12TET as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for confidence when, in reality and musical-psychology&amp;physiology there are many other.   A very obvious form of confidence derived from 12TET is a root, octave, and sometimes also a 5th tone in an arpeggio with very driven phasing/timing...and as such it&apos;s used extensively in just about all genres of popular music (everything from bluegrass arpeggios to dance arpeggios to choral harmonies to ways to design synth sounds using waveforms on different octaves and beyond).<br/>  I believe people want things new, but also want things to be very easy to follow...and it turns out the mind has more ability to &quot;follow&quot; complex changes in things like rhythm and timbre (the most obvious timbre modification&apos;s being a filter).<br/>  Far as melody and harmony, seems the most obvious way to go to get confidence and resolvedness is to base everything on either a common motif or things that form chords when played against that motif...and most pop songs are formed by turning on-and-off various melodic lines that match with a single motif, sometimes not-playing the motif but playing two lines that match with it so you can &quot;feel/predict the motif without hearing it&quot;...particularly for chorus and breakdown sections of songs.  To me it&apos;s a very limited formula and virtually a &quot;pop standard&quot;, but one that can be stretched to at least a good few more options via micro-tonality.</p><p>  Case in point: whenever someone DOES come up with a truly new melodic or harmonic technique...people don&apos;t just remember it for a few months but for 10+ years.  Easy examples: Way Out West uses huge deep 5+ note jazz chords extensively and B&apos;z (the Japanese selling equivalent of the Beatles) twist all sorts of weird melodic lines and in-between-key modulations around their infectiously catchy melodic themes.  Both are some of the very few relatively new groups regarded as classics for 10+ years.  It seems deeper melodies and harmonies play a huge role in making bands/groups &quot;classic&quot;.   Obviously also older groups like the Byrds and the Beatles often did all sorts of avant-garde things with melody and harmony as well...on top of the usual pop staple of great lyrics.<br/>    I&apos;m pretty convinced most people would love to see more &quot;classic&quot; groups show up, that they could talk about for years on end.  And since so many (if not most) of the &quot;surprising but somehow easy to follow&quot; combinations in 12TET have been found already...where better to go to find new ones than micro-tonal where, say, even swapping a 10/9 interval with a 12/11 in an old classic melody can completely warp the feel yet maintain a similar sense of composure/confidence?<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Me&gt; At the very least, use tuning to skew the mood of simple harmonic<br/>usage to purify and/or &quot;im-purify&quot; chords to fit the intended mood of<br/>the song for.<br/>Jon&gt;Not a bad idea.<br/>   More notes...what I was referring to hear is things like different forms of meantone that exchange purity/im-purity of some chords for others but &quot;average&quot; about the same level of purity overall.  One amusing test IMVHO is to select a mean-tone scale that bends a classic pop song so the chords that represent its mood most are stressed more.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve always had a particular hatred for the &quot;that sound is cool&quot; mode<br/>of thinking, because once the sound is out of vogue, the logic would<br/>follow that it isn&apos;t worth listening to anymore. I think of some of the<br/>music from the 70s and 80s and how people slam it for how cheezy the<br/>synths sound (or the drum sound, etc)&quot;<br/>   Hmm...I didn&apos;t mean it that way IE &quot;cheezy synths = bad&quot; or that by &quot;creative timbre&quot; I meant &quot;more advanced sounds&quot;.  In fact, back in the real pop world, some people gravitate toward things like 80&apos;s music...that&apos;s why we have all these 80&apos;s music stations here in 2010 (lol).  It&apos;s more like the whole art of having timbre help define a song...in the right context &quot;cheesy&quot; can be a plus (Lord knows how many people love hip hop songs with cheesy analog-synth bleeps) in the same way well-timed dissonance can be a plus to provide contrast to music.<br/>  So, at least to me, one sound&apos;s being cool doesn&apos;t by any means make something that doesn&apos;t follow it&apos;s ethics uncool: a huge evolving smooth ethereal pad sound loaded with effects need not make a cheesy bleep sound with only a well-timed amplitude modulation on it obsolete.  In fact one easy example is Way Out West&apos;s latest album...their old albums are chock-full of extremely technically advanced sounds and effects while their latest is kind of an ode to the Pet Shop Boys with purposefully simple 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s-esque sounds...and that album has done just as well as the rest.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Thanks for all your thoughts.
