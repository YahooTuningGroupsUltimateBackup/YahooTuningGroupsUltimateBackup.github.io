Erv Wilson is a legendary genius, and you&apos;re not, and never will be. There are also those of us out in the real world, playing concerts, teaching, recording, getting reviewed, and turning folks all over the world on to the vast world of microtonal music...if you had something to show for your theories, that would be a start...but you don&apos;t. And of course, I don&apos;t know you except for what I see here, which is not very impressive, to say the least. There are an infinity of ways to tune instruments...but more importantly, as I&apos;ve stated here before, it&apos;s the MUSIC that&apos;s important, not words on a computer screen. Music is sound, and tunings are to be used in service to musical ideas...so as far as I&apos;m concerned, there is no one way to tune. But every serious artist knows that, no need to debate which tuning is &quot;better.&quot; But, cats like you just make reading this list a chore, so I actually wish you would quit posting...and to the others here, I say ignore this feller, which is exactly what he doesn&apos;t want you to do...guys like this feed off of other people&apos;s discomfort, and they enjoy making others angry...don&apos;t waste your energy...and this will be my only post regarding Marcel...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2011 10:36:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Good show Neil my man, I completely agree with you in every respect.<br/>Personally, I&apos;ve blocked the dudes who have made it an insufferable<br/>habit of gamboling about in the tuning related lists with their<br/>cent-worth daily ideas.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>--</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;     M...well, you&apos;re another of those tuning list guys that loves to cause a ruckus, and another reason I never mention this list to any serious musicians I know.
