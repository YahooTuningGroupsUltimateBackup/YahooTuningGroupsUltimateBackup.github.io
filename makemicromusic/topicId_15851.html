I&apos;d love to<br/>carry that dialogue further, and maybe can better offer a response to<br/>your post now that the music itself is posted. I&apos;ll try to pick up on<br/>that thread over the weekend, because your comments deserve a lot of<br/>thoughtful discussion. For example, how might a piece of this kind be<br/>notated in Sagittal, and what might different performers do with it?</p><p>As discussed in the notes accompanying the ASCII score, this piece<br/>features a very expressive type of interval which I would like to<br/>thank Gene Ward Smith for calling to my attention.</p><p>Least but not least, the piece is dedicated to John Chalmers, both for<br/>his precious contributions to our understanding of tetrachords and<br/>many other aspects of music, and for the most generous help and<br/>encouragement he has extended me over the last nine years or so as I<br/>explore a universe of interval space which he has made more<br/>fascinating and engaging.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15905 href="#15905">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2007 1:46:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Jon and all.</p><p>Please let me thank and congratulate you for your moving<br/>interpretation of my _La Pacifica_. The choice of timbres, so as to<br/>highlight some of the counterpart and part-writing while also keeping<br/>a degree of blend, showed a very sensitive understanding of the piece<br/>while bringing out some aspects not revealed by my own rendition.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music/">http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music/</a>&gt;</p><p>Kudos, and thank you for illustrating the saying that creative<br/>arrangement is the highest form of flattery.</p><p>This is the kind of thing that happens very often in current<br/>performances of medieval European music: lots of different<br/>interpretations, varying in everything from instrumentations to chosen<br/>tempo or tactus to, in some cases, decisions about basic rhythmic<br/>patterns or which notes should sound simultaneously where the<br/>manuscripts leave this ambiguous -- not to mention those questions of<br/>discretionary accidentals!</p><p>Kraig replied to an earlier post I wrote about this piece before<br/>recording and posting it, raising questions about how I should notate<br/>it and seeking advice. He discussed the possibilities that one might<br/>use Sagittal, for example, and let performers decide the precise pitch<br/>contours.</p><p>I&apos;ll discuss this more in another post, but what I want to say now,<br/>Jon, is that your performance with its sensitive instrumentation<br/>eloquently illustrates one of Kraig&apos;s points: that a piece can and<br/>should be open to many possibilities.</p><p>While it&apos;s natural that discussions about this diversity on MMM might<br/>often focus on intonation, it&apos;s a much more general question. For<br/>example, about 30-40 years ago, a group called Studio for Early Music<br/>did some beautiful performances of 12th-14th century European music<br/>informed by an understanding of Near Eastern practices that likely<br/>influenced certain regions. Sometimes people ask whether their work is<br/>still a leading authority on possible medieval performance practices<br/>in Europe, and one answer is that their approach might be considered<br/>&quot;dated&quot; from this point of view -- or, at least, that other visions of<br/>what was likely &quot;period practice&quot; are in vogue at the moment.</p><p>Another question, however, is to ask whether their performances show a<br/>feeling for the music and bring out artfully and entertainingly -- and<br/>there, I would reply, &quot;Absolutely!&quot; If the music wasn&apos;t performed this<br/>way in 1250 or whenever, we&apos;re all the richer that nevertheless it has<br/>been done this way by now. This isn&apos;t to say that other performance<br/>practices must be inferior to theirs -- only that they have shed new<br/>light on the music in a most engaging way while seeking to be informed<br/>by the best information available at the time.</p><p>Anyway, while I&apos;ve often reflected on these issues as a performer,<br/>experiencing them from a composer&apos;s viewpoint is very illuminating,<br/>and you&apos;ve provided both the inspiration and the occasion!</p><p>Thanks again for all this, as well as your many compositions, and my<br/>Mom asked me to send you her &quot;warm&quot; regards. It was a pleasure to tell<br/>her about your arrangement.</p><p>Peace and love, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15942 href="#15942">ðŸ”—</a>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2007 12:30:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like the segment 1:10-1:20.
