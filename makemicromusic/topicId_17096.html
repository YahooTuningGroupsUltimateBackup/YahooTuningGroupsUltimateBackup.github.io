For instance, there are at<br/>least two 7-note MOS scales in which all but one note of the scale can<br/>be used as the tonic of a root-third-fifth-esque triad, but no 8-note<br/>scales with this property.  The 8-note scale with the highest<br/>note:available tonic ratio is the LLLLLLLs scale, with 8 notes:5<br/>tonics.  This changes, however, if the &quot;consonant triad type&quot; is<br/>altered from something resembling root-third-fifth to something<br/>resembling root-second-third.

Good equal temperaments are likely to lead to good *unequal* temperaments.  That&apos;s why my rank 2 search works with equal temperaments.  An MOS is a special case of a rank 2 temperament.</p><p>The logic is that the closer an EDO is to JI, the less out of shape you have to pull it to improve the relationship.

The approximations inherent in the EDO become central; this makes it different both from 13-et (which isn&apos;t really an approximation system)  and JI. Then of course there are the people who adopt a wholly intuitive approach.</p><p>&gt; I *started* my microtonal searches with a 31-tone guitar, and while it<br/>&gt; has very nice JI-esque harmonic properties, I did not find it a very<br/>&gt; productive source of new tonalities. Other than its typical meantone<br/>&gt; scale, the only new tonalities it offered were scales of 11 notes or<br/>&gt; more, and even those offered comparitively few consonant triads for<br/>&gt; the number of notes they require. All the other MOS scales of less<br/>&gt; than 11 notes don&apos;t produce enough consonant triads to form a<br/>&gt; tonality.</p><p>I think, considering how nice the 7 is, that looking at 31 as a purely 5-limit system is too limiting, but even then why not 13 notes with a 10deg31 generator? But more to the point, why not 13 notes with a 7deg31 generator? What you are ignoring, if you take the pure 5-limit point of view on orwell, is that the *generator* is a good-quality 7/6, just four cents sharp of just. Aside from 5-limit triads, there are also 1-7/6-3/2 and 1-3/2-7/4 triads, etc etc, to consider. There&apos;s also the 5/4-7/6-7/6-7/6 &quot;magic&quot; chord all over the place.</p><p>&gt; That, and no one I&apos;ve met in &quot;real life&quot; could even hear a difference<br/>&gt; between the various types of intervals in 31.</p><p>That&apos;s preposterous. No one can tell the difference between a fifth which is five cents flat and one which is 33.5 cents sharp?</p></div><h3><a id=17173 href="#17173">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2007 6:23:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like this one.

I actually feel a bit the same about the piece being unrelenting, but I like it.<br/>When finishing it I looked for a place to make a cut, but I decided it was OK the way it was<br/>and I left it all in. Jon L. Smith has graciously made mp3 renderings of it at a slower tempo<br/>and with some added rubato at the cadenza which you may like.

I liked these two. The compositions of yours that I&apos;ve heard have a sort of<br/>intense explosive quality which I like, and which strikes me a bit like Xenakis&apos; music<br/>sometimes does.
