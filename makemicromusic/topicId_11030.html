I am somewhat stuck or confused. I don&apos;t know if it relates to just intonation or composing for a choir, or just my general composition skills. I don&apos;t have any formal training in any of these subjects. My problem is:</p><p>My music tends to become very slow. And the vocal lines very simple, especially the bass&amp;tenor part. I am afraid this will bore singers and listeners. But if I try to compose faster music, and make vocal lines move more independent, I find the result sounding messy even if it&apos;s still harmonious.</p><p>Here is a piece I&apos;m working on right now:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/clhob">http://tinyurl.com/clhob</a></p><p>or equivalently:</p><p><a href="http://magnus.smartelectronix.com/examples/Magnus%20Jonsson%20-%20Walking%20to%20Class%202.mp3">http://magnus.smartelectronix.com/examples/Magnus%20Jonsson%20-%20Walking%20to%20Class%202.mp3</a></p><p>It is a prototype recording, so please be forgiving on my singing and the audio quality. And be forgiving on my amateur lyrics. Once I write something that is good enough I&apos;m hoping to get one of the university choirs to sing my piece.</p><p>I guess what I am asking is if there are any particular techniques that other just intonation composers use, that could be of general help for me. I&apos;ve tried to google for information about just intonation composition, and there&apos;s not a lot out there beyond the basics of ratios, and endless tuning talk.</p><p>Any advice?</p><p>- Magnus Jonsson</p></div>
