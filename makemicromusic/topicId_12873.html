I&apos;d been looking around for useful temperaments that may have been overlooked, and this one immediately attracted my attention.

So it occurred to me to try retuning Galatsia, which I wrote back in 1979, since it uses the whole tone scale in a couple of places. I tried to keep more or less the original melody, but I&apos;ve changed the harmony in some places to show off some of the harmonic possibilities of the 7-limit harmony approximations in lemba temperament. So here&apos;s the folk tune from Galatsia as it might be played on the island of Lemba:</p><p><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/lemba-galatsia.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/lemba-galatsia.mp3</a></p><p>For comparison, here&apos;s a MIDI arrangement of the 1982 orchestral version of Galatsia:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/Galatsia1.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/Galatsia1.mid</a></p></div><h3><a id=12876 href="#12876">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2006 9:30:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve always liked Herman&apos;s pieces and bits , and i think at his best<br/>he&apos;s an even better example of the same types of trad tonality<br/>through a microprism effects that someone like e.Blackwood is famous<br/>for.
