Included within my message was a link to some music (you&apos;ve seen/heard it) that I did with his application, and it certainly got his attention.</p><p>Which made me think: it is well and good to ask these people to micto-this and tonal-that, and hope that they will include the features that would make this new generation of music tools work for *our* needs. But I can&apos;t think of a better way than to say &quot;*this* is the kind of thing that I need to do, and I&apos;m sharing this music with you to show that I already *am* doing it, and would like to be able to use your SpectralSampleSynth in my upcoming pieces&quot;.</p><p>Most people who write software get a real pleasure out of knowing that people use it and are more creative/productive when they do. Rather than approach them cold, making them wonder if a particular request is just one more thing to add to a list, if one shows a real interest in the product and can show that you are already using tools in a similar manner, it just might be the extra &apos;stuff&apos; that gets them in the mood - &quot;hey, they could be using *my* app to make music!&quot;</p><p>Just a thought, and hopefully a spur to those already making music...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div>
