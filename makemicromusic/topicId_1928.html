Here&apos;s what I really think:</p><p>I believe we shouldn&apos;t use synths and computers only to imitate<br/>existing instruments because we can do so much more with them. My<br/>point was mainly about the potential of SYNTHESIS. Everyone knows<br/>that the Raison D&apos;etre of SAMPLERS is to record, manipulate and play<br/>sounds to be used in pieces of music. Many of you who use samples of<br/>acoustic instruments are extremely good at it and I enjoy your music<br/>tremendously. With modern sampling technology and larger memories of<br/>samplers one can reach to a point where no one can hear any<br/>difference between an imitation and the real thing.</p><p>My apologies for anyone who misunderstood my views.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=1931 href="#1931">ðŸ”—</a>spigot@...</h3><span>1/26/2002 4:10:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>stuff about synthetic imitations of real instruments --<br/>reminded me of something i read just yesterday:</p><p>&quot;... how determined people seem to be to aim for exactly the same<br/>target again and again. a charitable interpretation: by doing so<br/>they evolve better tools for everyone else, creating vocabulary<br/>out of metaphor.  like those pathetic computer artists who<br/>are so thrilled when they&apos;ve finally produced a picture of a daffodil<br/>with a drop of dew upon it -- indistinguishable from a real photo.<br/>to me this would represent a total failure, but in fact it&apos;s<br/>probably those people who propel the evolution of tools.&quot;<br/>    -brian eno</p><p>--<br/>. . .   p  f  l  y  . . .<br/>    <a href="http://www.neuron.net/~pfly/duckapus.html">http://www.neuron.net/~pfly/duckapus.html</a><br/>             ...the debut pfly CD...</p></div><h3><a id=1933 href="#1933">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

But what I believe is that the obsession<br/>with imitation has held back the potential of synthesisers.  Most boxes<br/>today aren&apos;t nearly as flexible as a TX81Z.  Most of those that are do so<br/>by pretending to be analog.  What a step backwards!</p><p>&gt; The other thing is that a world-class sample of an acoustic instrument<br/>&gt; is only as good as the way it is used/performed.

All this effort to get a cheap<br/>imitation of acoustic instruments.  That does have its place, for people<br/>who need a good mock-up or can&apos;t afford an orchestra to perform their<br/>music.  But as long as this is the goal of synthesiser design, they can&apos;t<br/>be more than imitations of other instruments.  What great musician would<br/>take up an instrument on the expectation that they&apos;ll never make it to the<br/>final recording?  Or that the ultimate success is for nobody to realise<br/>they&apos;re there?</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1936 href="#1936">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2002 1:21:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
