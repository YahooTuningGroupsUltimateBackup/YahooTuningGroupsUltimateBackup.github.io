This new piece feels sweeter and more<br/>supple than Librar22, which I also enjoy.

Also, I&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; find a good site for a general archive of my music (composed or<br/>&gt; improvised) in ogg and mp3 formats, and would prefer a policy of<br/>&gt; making pieces available in both formats. There have been some helpful<br/>&gt; posts on this topic of sites for making audio files generally<br/>&gt; available, and I&apos;d welcome more discussion and advice on this (I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; also had some helpful discussions offline).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One question raised by my General MIDI instrumentation is the nature<br/>&gt; of default MIDI-based string timbres, which I find add diversity to<br/>&gt; the consort of sounds (with contrasting timbres helping to<br/>&gt; differentate the melodic layers), but without closely emulating the<br/>&gt; variations characteristic of acoustical string playing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here 29-EDO is a kind of modern variation on medieval Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning, the &quot;historically correct&quot; intonation for this kind of style.<br/>&gt; The genre might be described as conductus, with the voices often<br/>&gt; moving together in more or less note-against-note style; three-voice<br/>&gt; textures in this genre are common around 1200, with a range of modern<br/>&gt; performance interpretations. During my youth, ensembles mixing voices<br/>&gt; with contrasting instrumental timbres for different lines were often<br/>&gt; favored; over the last three decades, performances by voices alone<br/>&gt; have come more into vogue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me express many thanks to those of you here and elsewhere<br/>&gt; who have helped to get me to this point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In view of Aaron Johnson&apos;s special role in facilitating my adventures<br/>&gt; with Linux, I would like warmly to dedicate this modest version of my<br/>&gt; piece to Aaron, his wife Lorna, and his grandfather Clarence -- with<br/>&gt; many thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt; mschulter@...</p></div>
