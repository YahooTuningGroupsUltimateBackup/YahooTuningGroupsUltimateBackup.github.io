Generally speaking, Jacky<br/>and I tend to work in different ways--you could say that I tend to opt<br/>for drastically changing parts and moods whereas Jacky tends to opt<br/>for the unity of a consistent thread that&apos;ll run through his pieces.</p><p>I think this collaboration is an example of two people coming from<br/>different places, conceptionally or aesthetically speaking that is,<br/>trying to work it out... though sometimes difficult, I think that&apos;s an<br/>exciting thing! I also think it speaks well for the spirit and<br/>potential of a community like ours as well--thanks Jacky.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

Perhaps you can write more about the process and how the collaboration progressed. To give a true review I would need to hear a high bandwidth CD version as I am detecting some &quot;woofiness&quot; in the mix; could just be the effects used and the 128k mp3 encoding. Jacky are you using a spectral panning plugin and/or some sort of transient/stable splitting effect? This could be it; I hear a lot of artifacts.. There is massive phasing during parts of  the mix. I kind of hear what sounds _like_ a pumping compressor, but with the phasing effect instead (volume rising and falling in a non-synched fashion).</p><p>None of the above is negative; just what I am hearing; I need a CD copy to hear what both of you hear.</p><p>Keep it coming. I&apos;d like to see more collaboration between list members!</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2002 2:20:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2995">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2995</a></p><p>***Nice and interesting mix of two musical personalities which I know<br/>well!</p><p>J.
