While you at it, check out a couple of other xentonal works on the same site from this page:<br/><a href="http://www.aaronandlorna.com/aaron_works.html">http://www.aaronandlorna.com/aaron_works.html</a></p><p>(You can contact Aaron on his site, since he isn&apos;t a member here...)</p><p>**********</p><p>Also, I asked him how he went about composing/producing the piece, and got a pretty surprising answer:</p><p>&quot;My equipment was my Korg X5DR module, and two of my own Python scripts, one for translating a notational ascii representation of the &apos;score&apos; to a midi file, the other script is a homegrown midi-file player.&quot;</p><p>So many ways to get it done...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
