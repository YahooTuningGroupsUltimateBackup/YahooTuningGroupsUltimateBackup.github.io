I don&apos;t<br/>feel quite as sure about it as one<br/>does if you can have your own backup<br/>as well - but it is probably better<br/>than Yahoo.</p><p>However, I do feel that it is quite possible that they may<br/>change their policies on ads as they did add ads<br/>to the search results after resisting them for<br/>a long time.</p><p>It is also possible that some format change<br/>they make may affect us quite unintentionally<br/>on their part.</p><p>Anyway, if we are happy to move on<br/>at any time if needed, it is no<br/>great concern at all, so in that<br/>sense minor, and may never happen.</p><p>The file attachments upload and threading<br/>are both big points in its favour :-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7212 href="#7212">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2004 7:35:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hi David,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d love this as a solution to Yahoo or Google.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I proposed this a few months ago using php on Metatuning<br/>&gt;&gt;and some folks thought it wasn&apos;t a good idea.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Great, glad someone sees it&apos;s good points :-).<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>I&apos;m used to the format, there&apos;s a couple of php boards I hang at.</p><p><a href="http://www.organissimo.org/forum/">http://www.organissimo.org/forum/</a> is one I frequent quite a bit.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
