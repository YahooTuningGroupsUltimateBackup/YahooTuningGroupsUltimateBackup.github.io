I&apos;m listening to the song now; I hear the guitar in five and the drums sound like their in six. And the saxophonist is picking his nose.</p><p>(So what could be the rhythmic equivalent of microtonalism anyway? What would you consider a &quot;microrhythm&quot;?)</p><p>&gt; Have you ever listened to Meshuggah?  I know they use standard-fretted<br/>&gt; instruments, but Fredrik Thordendal plays *the* most blatantly<br/>&gt; microtonal solos I&apos;ve ever heard anyone play on any guitar (regardless<br/>&gt; of fretting/tuning).  On more than a few songs he employs what sounds<br/>&gt; like a detuned &quot;harmonizer&quot; effect, doubling his solo notes with notes<br/>&gt; ranging a quartertone to a 3/4-tone off.  If you haven&apos;t heard them,<br/>&gt; check out their album &quot;Chaosphere&quot;...that&apos;s one of my all-time faves.</p><p>I got some of their more recent music on my Yahoo! Music playlist. I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m not more into Meshuggah, though I&apos;m not as much a headbanger as I was in high school and college. The band I&apos;m in now seems to be going in a prog-metal direction, so this is apparently changing. Now you want to talk about some SERIOUSLY complex rhythms and atonality.</p><p>And apparently I could be part of a very small clique - heavy metal oudists. Daron Malakian of System of a Down is the only one I can think of (listen to &quot;Nuguns&quot; from Steal This Album! - still no microtonalism there, unfortunately). The fretless instrument is turning out to be pretty handy for blues (very appropriate for Austin, Texas) and not just Oriental music.</p></div>
