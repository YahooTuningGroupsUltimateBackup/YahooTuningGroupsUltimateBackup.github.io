Sure, he follows the<br/>standard baroque chord progression, but the devil is in the<br/>counterpoint.  Especially the fugues.  I agree with you about<br/>the organ - Bach was first and foremost an organ composer, and<br/>his organ works are some of the most adventurous ever written,<br/>and there he *does* get away from the formula.  Also, if you hear<br/>something like the Mass in B min live... he proves he really<br/>understood woodwinds and chorus.</p><p>&gt;Gamelan is just as counterpuntal at times and there you don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt;wait for the theme to come back cause all the variations are happening<br/>&gt;the first time through right on top of each other</p><p>I do love gamelan.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=16764 href="#16764">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2007 9:23:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I think it&apos;s a misleading/misguided question because it is an<br/>&gt;impossible question,</p><p>It&apos;s not impossible, just subjective.
