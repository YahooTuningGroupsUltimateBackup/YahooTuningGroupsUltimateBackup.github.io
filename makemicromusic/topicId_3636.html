You might find a kbd for that with a &apos;piano&apos; sound, but it won&apos;t be very good, and you certainly won&apos;t find anything with weighted-key action.</p><p>But every year brings goodies at lower prices, so I stand ready to be surprised! It&apos;s just that the last time (last year) I went looking for a controller that also has some good, basic sounds, it cost a lot more than that...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
