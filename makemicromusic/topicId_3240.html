Oh.  Well, I know I have a SoundBlaster 128.  What I<br/>was wondering is whether I have a USB port, which I don&apos;t think I<br/>have.

In some special cases, one needs to have a merge. I bought a<br/>&gt; midi merge box, because I have a rather complex set-up which<br/>involves using a software synth editor. More ports are good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be the *sequencer* software, right,<br/>&gt; &gt; not the software that would come with the interface??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The interface will have drivers, which will allow your DAW to see<br/>the midi card.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you look at the midi properties in the sequencer you use, you<br/>&gt; will see that you can configure midi to be sent to any available<br/>&gt; chosen outputs.

But how about planning ahead? What if you get the Proteus 2000, or other midi gear (like a TX802)? The bottom line is that the cost difference between the 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4 is fairly negligible, and you can plan for expansion.</p><p>Remember, one of the downsides of multi-timbral on the TX boxes is that the more separate channels/voices you use, the less polyphony in that part. If you set up one box with 8 patches responding (each) to 8 separate channels, you can now only give one note at a time per patch/voice.</p><p>Multi-timbral is great, but with harmonic or complex music you *need* voices, and it is better to have another box (even if borrowed) that can be addressed by another midi port or channel.</p><p>OK, hope that helps.

And since they<br/>can be<br/>&gt; &apos;daisy chained&apos;, you can add a port expander; for instance, one<br/>advertised<br/>&gt; today is standard: you plug it into one of the above USB ports and<br/>it adds<br/>&gt; four more ports. Cost? $0.00 with the rebate - yes, it is free.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I forgot to mention that is seems like virtually EVERY printer<br/>these days<br/>&gt; uses USB instead of serial, not to mention all the digital cams and<br/>stuff.<br/>&gt; Definitely the way for you to go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please note: USB is *not* supported by Win95; you must be using<br/>Win98 or<br/>&gt; 2000 or later...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>***Thanks so much, Jon, especially for the link.

They were saying, though, at Sam<br/>Ash that<br/>&gt; &gt;they could &quot;special&quot; order a multi-port interface that worked with<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;*serial* port rather than an USB.  Does it really make any<br/>difference??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Virtually all &apos;peripheral&apos; components being made for PCs<br/>utilize the<br/>&gt; USB port, and it is the way to go (getting a serial device is<br/>simply<br/>&gt; investing in outdated and soon-to-be unsupported hardware). Not to<br/>mention<br/>&gt; that USB devices can be &apos;daisy chained&apos;, and they can be &apos;hot&apos;<br/>plugged,<br/>&gt; which means you can plug and unplug them, and the computer will<br/>recognize<br/>&gt; what has just been added to the system. I swap a USB midi device<br/>and a Zip<br/>&gt; drive on my laptop all the time. And on my desktop I have USB film<br/>scanner,<br/>&gt; flatbed scanner, color printer, and midi device. Can&apos;t have 4<br/>serial ports,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s for sure.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, this is pretty cool, and I didn&apos;t have time to read it<br/>carefully enough yesterday.  What you&apos;re saying, Jon, is that with a<br/>USB port one can plug and unplug different devices into it and the<br/>computer will figure out what they are immediately with no problems??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2002 7:36:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
