Also, I<br/>like making wiki pages that themselves become a call to ACTION in some<br/>way.</p><p>Hope to see you there or anytime,<br/>Jacob<br/>who didn&apos;t finish his 19-tone piano piece :( but will be going to<br/>Chicago :)</p></div><h3><a id=17707 href="#17707">ðŸ”—</a>Jacob &#x3C;tricesimoprimalist@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2007 12:39:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What a lonely wiki weekend that was.

Until, the<br/>wiki list takes off, we don&apos;t have a systematic way of studying the<br/>repertoire of a particular edo. I personally want to hear the good, the<br/>bad and the ugly. We can always have a recommended list when we have<br/>more pieces to choose from. That&apos;s just my opinion, but if others share<br/>it, then it might make a worthwhile project. There&apos;s also plenty of<br/>room on the wiki if others would like to organise things differently.</p><p>Daniel Thompson</p></div><h3><a id=17731 href="#17731">ðŸ”—</a>aum &#x3C;aum@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2007 9:56:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,<br/>sorry for not to participate on wiki weekend, but I didn&apos;t find the time for it.<br/>Some time ago I put something on 5edo page as guest (<a href="http://88.103.85.96">88.103.85.96</a>).
