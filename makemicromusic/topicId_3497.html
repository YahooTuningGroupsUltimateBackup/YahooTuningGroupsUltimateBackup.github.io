What&apos;s the pattern?<br/>[...]<br/>&gt; Q2. Was C really considered the center of this default three<br/>&gt; sharp two flat meantone tuning?</p><p>Well, actually the center is d. It is literally the center of a C-E short<br/>octave four octave keyboard, it is the final of mode one, and it is<br/>the note halfway between c and d -- the MEAN!</p><p>Of course you can tune meantone centered anywhere you have a<br/>major third you want to bisect. F#-A# would work fine, centered on<br/>G#.</p><p>The pattern is you tune the fourths and fifths to get your proper<br/>bisect, which tunes five notes (c, g, d, a, e), then from the ends (c<br/>and e) you tune three fifths  down from c (f, b flat, e flat) and three<br/>fifths up ffrom e (b, f#, c#). That gives you 11 notes. If you&apos;re<br/>stopping at 12, you have to decide whether to make it a G# or an A<br/>flat. G sharp is the more common, but retuning for the key you are<br/>in next didn&apos;t take long. Of course this is why the gig musicians<br/>published all those little fakebooks called things like &apos;Suite in F&apos;, or<br/>&apos;Suite in G&apos;, or &apos;Suite in e minor&apos; -- sho you would know you could<br/>play a bunch of dances without having to stop and retune the<br/>accidentals.</p><p>Judy</p><p>Judith Conrad, clavichordist<br/>Music Director, Calvary Baptist Church<br/>747 Broad Street, Providence RI 02907</p></div><h3><a id=3503 href="#3503">ðŸ”—</a>judithconrad@...</h3><span>6/26/2002 9:37:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 27 Jun 2002, at 0:00, X.

Or am I wrong about<br/>&gt; that being popular -- I had thought the F-F compass was the 5<br/>&gt; octaveer one that gave the cembalist the widest repertoire.</p><p>OK, quick explanation -- when I said c-e short octave four octave<br/>compass, it goes from low C, C2 to piano tuners, to high c&apos;&apos;&apos;, C6 to<br/>piano tuners. But it doesn&apos;t have all the notes at the bottom, it&apos;s a<br/>&apos;short octave&apos; -- bottom note looks like E, but plays C, next note is<br/>F, the thing that looks like F# plays D, G is G, the thing that looks<br/>like G# plays E.. So you have no C# or D# or F# or G# in the<br/>bottom (short) octave. Well, sometimes you had split accidentals<br/>to give you F# and G#. So D was actually in the middle of a four<br/>octave keyboard.C - C. Weird, huh!</p><p>Organ keyboards never got more than that, most of the time,<br/>except that at some point a bit before 1700 they started making.<br/>them chromatic to the bottom instead of having the short octave.<br/>Most keyboards weren&apos;t more than 4 octaves until near 1700, full<br/>five - octave ones didn&apos;t start till well into the 18th century.  I think<br/>something like 30 of Scarlatti&apos;s 500 sonatas require five octaves. A<br/>few notes above c&apos;&apos;&apos; were pretty standard in Bach&apos;s time, the<br/>noted\s below C weren&apos;t.</p><p>Judy</p><p>Judith Conrad clavichordist<br/><a href="http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html">http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html</a></p></div>
