Africa, with a great booklet, featuring detailed profiles of the artists, and a list of the maqamat/scales used...Bassekou Kouyate and Ngoni Ba, &quot;I Speak Fula...&quot;  Killer African music, featuring 4 Ngonis...it&apos;s amazing how they get so many notes out of such a teensy fretless neck...and amazing rhythms...</p><p>The Devil&apos;s Anvil, &quot;Hard Rock From the Middle East...&quot; from 1967, an early mix of rock with Arabic, Greek, and Turkish concepts...totally uncontrived, still one of my favorite albums...this is where I first heard the oud and Arabic singing, at the age of 16...and last but not least, Sando Szabo&apos;s &quot;Modern Hungarian Maqam&quot; is a beautiful CD; he&apos;s a great guitarist, and his research into early Hungarian maqam ideas is really interesting.
