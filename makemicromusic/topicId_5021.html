I suppose if you took one of the Debussy<br/>gamelan inspired pieces and tuned it to a genuine gamelan tuning,<br/>or maybe Messian tuned in some way inspired by birdsong then that<br/>might be xentonal because the composers inspiration was xentonal<br/>even if the medium he chose to express it was not, so by retuning it<br/>like that you are bringing out the xentonal inspiration of the original<br/>piece.</p><p>Otherwise, hard for a twelve tone inspired piece retuned to be<br/>really xentonal though it might be in very special circumstances<br/>(such as those special remappings that acutally move the notes<br/>around and change the ordering and the way the harmonies operate<br/>altogether, those perhaps could be).</p><p>It&apos;s not meant as a criticism of your retunings in any way, but an attempt<br/>to keep language and concepts clear. Correct me if I haven&apos;t understood<br/>what xentonality means, anyone.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2003 6:10:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;It&apos;s not meant as a criticism of your retunings in any way, but<br/>&gt;an attempt to keep language and concepts clear.
