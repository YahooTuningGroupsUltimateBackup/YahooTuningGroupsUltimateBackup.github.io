Currently, retuning the<br/>samples microtonally is extremely time consuming (300,000 manual<br/>operations to retune a single string library, for example). They&apos;re<br/>working on version 3 now, and I&apos;ve asked them to make it possible to<br/>create templates into which exisiting sound libraries can just be<br/>poured into automatically for retuning.</p><p>Please, if this possibility interests you, e-mail custser3@t...<br/>very soon and tell them that you work with [ethnic, music,<br/>microtonal] music and are considering buying Gigastudio but want to<br/>know if it is easy to retune samples automatically from their sound<br/>libraries! If they add this feature, I honestly believe this will be<br/>an incredibly rich source of musical inspiration for microntonalists<br/>of all stripes.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help,<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>--- End forwarded message ---</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
