In reference to your previous post, I also most emphatically prefer to make my own judgements- I was just describing how things seem to work, in my experience, not how they necessarily should be.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember exactly what I wrote, but the piece is in 2:3:7:13<br/>Just Intonation, seventeen tones of a larger tetrachordal system, very roughly. In effect there are some small commas tempered out, not literally but in the sense that intervals differing from each other by<br/>these commas are functionally equivalent, so technically they could<br/>be tempered out with no other effect than small coloristic changes, and are tempered out in notation.</p><p>The tuning is &quot;bronzepunk&quot;, as the tetrachords can all be described in<br/>ancient or medieval ways, but the tune, to my ears, came out with a<br/>1930&apos;s kind of flavor to it.</p><p>about 17-equal<br/>to make my own judgements<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s the piece I submitted to the untwelve competition. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://dl.kibla.org/dl.php?filename=ALittleRomance_CBobro.flac">http://dl.kibla.org/dl.php?filename=ALittleRomance_CBobro.flac</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Mr. Bobro.
