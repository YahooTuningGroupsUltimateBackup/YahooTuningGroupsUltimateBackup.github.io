It is the first time<br/>I&apos;ve posted anything to non12comp.  I guess I&apos;ll start by saying I hope<br/>you&apos;re all doing well and feeling inspired.  I&apos;ve got something to share<br/>today, so I&apos;ll get on with it.</p><p>There have been some excellent postings of pieces in 5tET, and some talk<br/>about alternatives to 5tET.  Some have suggested that some JI scale<br/>approximating 5tET might be an interesting alternative to 5tET.  An<br/>intriguing suggestion.  I&apos;ve been waiting to hear examples, and then I got<br/>tired of waiting.</p><p>I recorded a little improvisation in 5tET, and then I created a number of<br/>retuned versions.  I uploaded the whole set to my site:<br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/andrewheathwaite">http://www.soundclick.com/andrewheathwaite</a>.</p><p>I will tell you all the scales I used (details below), but I&apos;ll leave my<br/>opinions to myself for the time being.</p><p>&#xFFFD; 5tET<br/>&#xFFFD; 7-limit JI approximation<br/>&#xFFFD; 17-limit JI approximation<br/>&#xFFFD; a MOS scale (13/10 generator, octave repeat)<br/>&#xFFFD; A segment of the overtone series<br/>&#xFFFD; 5th root of 3<br/>&#xFFFD; 5th root of 19/11</p><p>The first three sound the most like 5tET, then they start getting esoteric.<br/>I had fun with it.</p><p>Share your thoughts!</p><p>-Andrew</p><p>===</p><p>Details of scales</p><p>=</p><p>5tET</p><p>cents from 1/1:<br/>0, 240, 480, 720, 960</p><p>cents difference:<br/>240, 240, 240, 240, 240</p><p>The original, equal steps and octave-repeating.</p><p>=</p><p>7-limit JI approximation</p><p>ratio from 1/1:<br/>1/1, 8/7, 4/3, 3/2, 7/4</p><p>cents from 1/1:<br/>0, 231, 498, 702, 969</p><p>cents difference:<br/>231, 267, 204, 267, 231</p><p>A simple JI approximation, unequal, unbeating.</p><p>=</p><p>17-limit JI approximation</p><p>ratio from 1/1:<br/>1/1, 15/13, 17/13, 26/17, 26/15</p><p>cents from 1/1:<br/>0, 248, 464, 736, 952</p><p>cents difference:<br/>248, 217, 271, 217, 248</p><p>A more complex JI approximation, further from 5tET, unequal, more<br/>ear-bending.</p><p>=</p><p>MOS scale (13/10 generator, octave repeat)</p><p>cents from 1/1:<br/>0, 292, 454, 746, 908</p><p>cents difference:<br/>292, 163, 292, 163, 292</p><p>By definition, steps of two distinct sizes.
