A partner of mine and I ran<br/>our<br/>&gt; own creative underground cassette label between 1985-95, which had<br/>&gt; over 70 releases of music with a wildly wide range of styles<br/>&gt; represented. There was microtonality, comedy, rock, dance music,<br/>&gt; jazz, electro-acoustic &quot;classical&quot; styled, free-form improvisation<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All this was going on during a time in which the technology to<br/>record<br/>&gt; our own CDs was still out of reach, so being unable to do this, we<br/>&gt; harnessed the power of the venerable cassette to network with other<br/>&gt; artists and &quot;zines&quot;. The exciting vibe about the flourishing taper<br/>&gt; scene, was that of total unchained creativity, and it showed me that<br/>&gt; what we see/hear coming through the popular media hardly represents<br/>&gt; the true ground of creative work that one likely would never become<br/>&gt; aware of through the usual popular means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The underground cassette review &quot;Zine&quot; was a vital part of this Home<br/>&gt; Taper Scene, and this is where one would hope to get their music<br/>&gt; reviewed, and would offer ways to network with others doing<br/>&gt; interesting creative work. This is where I first became aware of the<br/>&gt; fantastic music of Dan Stearns. Truly some of the best that was<br/>going<br/>&gt; on. What a delight it was to come to this internet community to find<br/>&gt; Dan here - and also learn that his deep creativity extended into the<br/>&gt; field of microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now with the power of the internet and mp3, things happen much more<br/>&gt; quickly than for the Home Tapers. One can create music, and the same<br/>&gt; day deliver it to those who wish to hear it. It is like a dream come<br/>&gt; true really, to be able to network this way. No more snail mail -<br/>&gt; just instant gratification. And with the ability to publish to the<br/>&gt; web, what are the online equivalent of the Zines, the opportunities<br/>&gt; for the microtonally inclined are also greatly increased. Not to<br/>&gt; mention exciting forums like Make Micro Music, where we all have the<br/>&gt; wonderful opportunity to come together to share our diverse<br/>&gt; approaches to this beautiful art form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While all of this may be taken for granted if it&apos;s all one has ever<br/>&gt; known, when one has had to work with much less, then it is easily<br/>&gt; apparent how things have changed for the better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While on the one hand I hold in highest regard the effort to create<br/>&gt; microtonal CD works, I&apos;m still even more at heart an advocate of<br/>just<br/>&gt; playing for the pure joy of it. I feel that it is not always<br/>&gt; necessary for us to have to be making some kind of imagined &quot;high<br/>&gt; brow art&quot; in order to just have fun and great pleasure from what<br/>&gt; microtonality offers us. This simple pleasure of &quot;just playing&quot; for<br/>&gt; enjoyment, is what keeps me going through the years, and not<br/>&gt; ironically, casual playing has taught me more about microtonality<br/>&gt; than all I&apos;ve been able to &quot;read&quot; about it. The emotional impact and<br/>&gt; power of musically exploring the rich palette that microtonality<br/>&gt; brings to the curious composer/musician is in large part ineffable.<br/>&gt; Basically this is because sound/tuning has a somewhat symbolic<br/>&gt; emotional impact, and as one might guess, the words we use to<br/>&gt; describe &quot;things&quot; are not the things themselves - in this regard,<br/>&gt; there is an *understanding* coming through the music that defies our<br/>&gt; ability to always and in every case define it. Musical experience of<br/>&gt; and with microtonaltiy is the way to really begin to grasp its<br/>&gt; powerful nature in music. When one sits down to their chosen<br/>&gt; instrument and begins to play and explore the new sound patterns,<br/>and<br/>&gt; directly experience the emotional impact of new tunings outside of<br/>12<br/>&gt; tET, this is where the ineffable &quot;magic&quot; is discovered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back during the Home Taper days, I got to hear many different kinds<br/>&gt; of new music - some rough - some brilliantly polished, and I always<br/>&gt; made an effort to deeply listen and appreciate what the musician was<br/>&gt; trying to say, no matter how roughly recorded the music was. It was<br/>&gt; just the excitement of being able to network and share music in this<br/>&gt; creative scene that kept me interested in what other creative people<br/>&gt; were doing for the better part of 10 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the same hand and set of ears that I like to apply to what I<br/>&gt; encounter in this forum. While it&apos;s easy for some to say things<br/>&gt; like &quot;I don&apos;t care for much microtonal music that I hear being<br/>made&quot;,<br/>&gt; it takes Courage to Encourage, and even more Courage to Create. To<br/>&gt; me, there is no &quot;lesser vision&quot;. I&apos;m excited about new listening<br/>&gt; experiences - I&apos;m constantly wishing to hear new creative work,<br/>&gt; especially if I know the artist(s) who are doing the creative work.<br/>&gt; Everyone&apos;s unique take in this art form is where my direct interest<br/>&gt; lies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I&apos;m extending to the members of this vibrantly creative<br/>&gt; group. I will listen attentively to every single piece of music that<br/>&gt; anyone at all posts here, and make an effort to comment. It matters<br/>&gt; not to me if it&apos;s played on a single keyboard timbre, or a symphony<br/>&gt; orchestra - it matters not if it&apos;s got noise, clicks and pops - it<br/>&gt; matters not to me if it sounds like 8 bit audio played through a<br/>&gt; Victrola. I&apos;ll listen to anything and be interested, because it is<br/>&gt; here in this forum, where individuals have gathered to finally turn<br/>&gt; the theories into realities, that I&apos;ve found an environment that I<br/>&gt; like to call &quot;home&quot;.  Tuning alone does not good music make, and it<br/>&gt; is a honor to be in a place where others are up to the ultimate and<br/>&gt; larger challenge of making it live in music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May 2002 bring abundance to all, in music, joy and life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Peace,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
