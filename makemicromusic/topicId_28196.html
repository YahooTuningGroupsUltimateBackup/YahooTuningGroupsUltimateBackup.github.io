For instance, Bach&apos;s sequence of chords A- D7 (bars 3 &amp; 4) was turned into A subminor (A C; E) followed by semptimal D7 (D F# A C;) (end of bar 3 - beginning of bar 4). This choice forced, by analogy, a subminor A= chord at the beginning of bar 3; on the contrary, C was kept even in the central group of bar 3.</p><p>There are many similar issues in this piece. I feel it is worthwhile telling it is the first time I succeed in rendering Bach&apos;s music using a septimal limit tuning: the main issue at stake is that, in general, a &quot;prepared&quot; seventh, when tuned as a septimal note, makes the preceding chord rather dissonant.</p><p>However, I agree with you in general that it best to retain 7/4 where its harmonic function is most important, and even out the whole steps where it&apos;s more of a passing tone: but, when composing, we have more degrees of freedom...</p><p>I am composing some septimal works, but they are still in a preliminary phase.</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Claudi Meneghin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Harold&quot; &lt;harold.fortuin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for uploading this - you did some nice organ-ish instrumentation too, and since I&apos;ve not been to Milan, the city scenes were an added bonus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure I heard usage of the septimal 7th (exact or close approximation to 7/4) in dominant-seventh (4:5:6:7) chords and arpeggiated chord passages.
