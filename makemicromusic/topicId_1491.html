The reasons for this are the same reasons we can<br/>hear a complex set of frequencies as a _single pitch_ in the first<br/>place. If the constituent tones _don&apos;t_ each have a clearly<br/>identifiable pitch, then the major triad will still lead, in most<br/>cases, to a more integrated sound than the augmented or diminished<br/>triad.</p></div>
