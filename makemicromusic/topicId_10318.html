I *can* think of a way you could do full orchestral scores this way:</p><p>- You didn&apos;t mention capturing output, but if you would be willing to do your piece one track at a time, you could capture each track separately. If you don&apos;t have a way to do it, get &quot;TapeIt&quot; from SilverSpike (free) and put it as the last VST insert - it will write audio to a file</p><p>- Do this for each &apos;line&apos; of your score (vln, flute, tpt, whatever), rendering each  by itself</p><p>- Gather the audiofiles and bring them into a multi-channel audio editor/mixer. That recent experimentation with the Kristal Audio Engine makes me think this would be ideal.</p><p>Arduous? Yep, but easier than building a harmonic canon.</p><p>&gt;What I need is a standalone app like JIRelay (or a VSTi plugin) that will &gt;do pitch-bending without re-channeling the output onto different channels. &gt;In other words, treating each channel as monophonic, and just setting the &gt;pitch-bend with each note-on.</p><p>It wouldn&apos;t work if you had any notes sustaining over, because per-channel pitchbending would bend the sustaining notes as well. Even round-robin re-channelling doesn&apos;t work with thick polyphony.</p></div><h3>Cody &#x3C;codyhallenbeck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2005 4:16:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is kind of a techie question for those who are into plugging<br/>stuff together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Long ago I bought Finale and I always upgrade.

And FTS 3 (now in beta?) can do this!<br/>FTS has some sophisticated facilities for doing things with channels and<br/>with pitch-bend range, etc. It has some problems, similar to what I<br/>mentioned about Scala&apos;s new option...

For example, I tried a 15-tet tuning, where some<br/>adjacent notes of the tuning happen to be pitch-bend versions of the same<br/>MIDI note. I&apos;m guessing that the note on/off on the same pitch is screwing<br/>things up -- in legato mode, that situation doesn&apos;t work well at all: the<br/>2nd slurred note on the same MIDI note always gets lost. This might be<br/>fixable, but I&apos;m not sure how. It may be simply endemic to the method. As<br/>long as you&apos;re playing detached notes, it seems to work OK. So, the method<br/>is probably only really usable in tunings where no two adjacent notes in<br/>the tuning are required to be realized on the same MIDI note with different<br/>pitch bends. (I suppose it might be possible to fudge a bit, if you have<br/>carefully constructed instrumental parts such that they never have<br/>successive notes realized as pitch-bend versions of the same MIDI note<br/>number. There might also be some way to &quot;fix&quot; Scala for these tunings,<br/>e.g., if a note can be realized as a pitch-bend version of more than one<br/>MIDI note, then Scala could look for a *different* MIDI note than the<br/>last-sounding note on the channel; that may be overkill, or not possible,<br/>but it&apos;s a possible attack on the problem.)</p><p>Some instruments of the orchestra seem to not work properly at all with<br/>regard to pitch bending, but I haven&apos;t tried them all to verify. Also, the<br/>non-bending instruments like Piano of course don&apos;t bend. It also seems to<br/>make a difference whether you use the Finale &quot;built-in&quot; version or the<br/>&quot;full GPO&quot; version of an instrument. E.g., the full GPO version of the oboe<br/>doesn&apos;t work properly, but the Finale version does!</p><p>So, GPO plus Scala is entirely useable with various baroque tunings,<br/>harmonic tunings and others involving only 12 notes, etc., and to a limited<br/>extent with arbitrary tunings. Many, many thanks to Manuel! I am so glad<br/>that he implemented this. To my mind, this has quietly revolutionized<br/>something...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/2005 9:29:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Hello everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Recently on the list, Manuel provided a new experimental version of Scala<br/>&gt;that has the option to *not* switch channels on pitch-bend re-tuning.

Until now these re-tuning<br/>relay applications could be used for doing keyboard pieces, but not really<br/>for ensemble pieces (unless you record the parts of the ensemble<br/>separately).

You<br/>really need to do this channel switching when you have polyphonic music on<br/>a channel, because all the sounding notes on a channel will get bent<br/>simultaneously. If your channels are truly monophonic, it shouldn&apos;t matter;<br/>hence you shouldn&apos;t *need* to switch channels.</p><p>Manuel implemented that feature in Scala&apos;s MIDI relaying.

I have not tested the GPO<br/>&quot;Notation Edition&quot; full version instruments yet, just the set that comes<br/>with Finale 2006, so I hope this is useful for people who have Finale but<br/>don&apos;t have the full GPO version. By &quot;usability&quot; I mean it responds to pitch<br/>bend in the &quot;standard&quot; range of plus or minus 2 semitones that is usable<br/>with most of the current relay mechanisms that do pitch-bend retuning.</p><p>The pitch bend range in the built-in Finale Edition is supposed to be 2<br/>semitones in either direction. In my list below, &quot;OK&quot; means that the<br/>pitch-bend is correct and usable, with some caveats. Some instruments do<br/>not respond to pitch-bend messages; some respond in a flawed way, as noted<br/>below.</p><p>In *all* of the brass and woodwinds the pitch-bend seems to automatically<br/>fly back to &quot;zero&quot; (center) at note-off. This is annoying, but apparently<br/>they are still apparently usable, as per my recent sound examples.</p><p>The pianos and most other plucked, struck, or otherwise non-sustaining<br/>instruments either do not respond to pitch-bend or do so unusably.</p><p>In short, most instruments are usable, but the following instruments have<br/>fatal flaws for microtonal work:<br/>&#x9;English Horn 1 (all &quot;plr&quot;)<br/>&#x9;Bass Clarinet (all &quot;plr&quot;)<br/>&#x9;B-flat Clarinet (all &quot;plr&quot;)<br/>&#x9;Bassoon 1 (all &quot;plr&quot;)<br/>&#x9;all Trombones</p><p>(Note: There exist other, usable, English Horns, Bass Clarinets and<br/>Clarinets, but no usable Trombones at all.)</p><p>-----------------</p><p>LIST OF INSTRUMENTS AND FINDINGS</p><p>Woodwind:<br/>    Alto Flutes - plr 1, 2, 3, and solo - OK<br/>    Bass Flute solo NV, V - both OK<br/>    Flute solo flutter, KS, NV, V - all OK<br/>    Piccolo - all OK<br/>    English Horn 1, 2 solo - OK<br/>    Oboe 1 modern plr 1, 2, 3 - all OK<br/>    Oboe 1, 2, 3 modern solo - all OK<br/>    Oboe classical solo - OK<br/>    Oboe d&apos;amore solo - OK<br/>    Bass Clarinet solo - OK<br/>    B-flat Clarinet solo - OK<br/>    Contrabass Clarinet solo - OK<br/>    E-flat Clarinet solo - OK<br/>    Bassoon 1 solo - OK<br/>    Bassoon 2 plr 1, 2, 3, solo - all OK<br/>    Contrabassoon 1, 2 solo - OK<br/>Brass:<br/>    French Horn 1, 2, 3 plr 2, 3, 4 - seem all OK, not all tested<br/>    Trumpet 1, 2, 3, plr 1, 2, 3 - all seem OK, not all tested.<br/>    Trumpet piccolo solo - seems OK<br/>    Contrabass Tuba - OK<br/>    Tuba 1, 2 solo, and others - seem all OK, not all tested</p><p>Keyboards:<br/>    Harpsichord KS - OK</p><p>Strings - all seem OK</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>I didn&apos;t test any of the real unpitched percussion, such as snare drums.</p><p>All of the following instruments behave &quot;oddly&quot; with pitch-bend.<br/>Typically, if they respond to pitch-bend at all, they do so partially, then<br/>slide back to the nominal tone in a weird way, instead of retaining the<br/>pitch-bend across attacks.<br/>    Handbells<br/>    all Marimbas<br/>    Timpani<br/>    Tubular Bells<br/>    Vibraphone<br/>    all Harps<br/>    Celesta<br/>    Glass Harmonica<br/>    all Pianos<br/>    all Pipe Organs</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>The following instruments are fatally flawed for microtonal work for the<br/>reasons mentioned:</p><p>Bass Flute plr 1, 2, 3 -  pitch-bend goes up/down one semitone<br/>Flute plr 1, 2, 3 - pitch-bend goes up/down one semitone<br/>English Horn 1 plr 1, 2, 3 - pitch-bend goes up/down one semitone<br/>Bass Clarinet plr 1, 2, 3 - pitch-bend goes up/down one semitone<br/>B-flat Clarinet plr 1, 2, 3 - pitch-bend goes up/down one semitone<br/>Bassoon 1 plr 1, 2, 3 - no pitch-bend response at all<br/>Bass Trombone 1, 2, 2ag solo - pitch-bend goes augmented 4th up/down<br/>Tenor Trombone plr 1 - pitch-bend goes augmented 4th up/down</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>The trombones all have fatal flaws that render them unusable for<br/>microtonal work of any type, which is very unfortunate. Note however that<br/>in the GPO &quot;Notation Edition&quot; full version, the trombones all seem to go<br/>up/down 12 semitones as documented, which is good news. The trombones would<br/>be usable under two conditions: 1) the pitch-bend range of the relay<br/>system could be set plus or minus arbitrary semitones, and 2) it could be<br/>set on a per-channel basis. In fact, with GPO generally, to make fullest<br/>use, one would probably want the pitch-bend range to be settable per<br/>channel, given the different sizes of hard-wired pitch-bend ranges. Perhaps<br/>a future version of GPO will fix these problems, and also allow settable<br/>pitch-bend range.</p><p>[end]</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2005 5:59:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, for what it&apos;s worth... Below text posted on the official GPO<br/>forum under Support &amp; Technical, Oct 19. We&apos;ll see if there&apos;s any answer.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p><p>-------------------</p><p>Recently bought GPO and love it, etc. It does what it&apos;s supposed to do,<br/>but I&apos;m into alternative tuning, so I have been pushing the envelope a bit<br/>and made some experiments.</p><p>I find the pitch-bend range inconsistent in some of the instruments in the<br/>Finale Edition of GPO. (I haven&apos;t yet tested the &quot;Notation Edition&quot; full<br/>version, which I also purchased.)</p><p>Most instrument pitch-bend ranges in the Finale Edition are set as<br/>documented to 2 semitones up/down, which is great. That&apos;s the MIDI spec<br/>standard starting position, and the range most used by MIDI relay systems<br/>that do real-time re-tuning via pitch-bend. Some of the GPO Finale Edition<br/>instruments, however, have different settings. I&apos;d consider these &quot;bugs&quot;.</p><p>All of the Trombone instruments (Tenor and Bass included) go up/down an<br/>augmented 4th.</p><p>All of these instruments go up/down one semitone:<br/>    Bass Flute plr 1, 2, 3<br/>    Flute plr 1, 2, 3<br/>    English Horn 1 plr 1, 2, 3<br/>    Bass Clarinet plr 1, 2, 3<br/>    B-flat Clarinet plr 1, 2, 3<br/>    Bassoon 1 plr 1, 2, 3</p><p>Is there any bug-fix patch in the works that might address this inconsistency?</p><p>I&apos;ve asked before about microtonal support in GPO, and that seems like a<br/>dead-end. But solving these inconsistencies would help some of us who are<br/>experimenting with use of GPO for this work. You see, most of GPO actually<br/>is very usable with alternative tunings with some of the MIDI-relay<br/>mechanisms that this community uses (e.g., Scala). It&apos;s not just useful for<br/>avant garde tunings, but historical tunings such as meantone, etc.</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2005 12:45:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello all...</p><p>Here is another experiment with Garritan Personal Orchestra, perhaps a bit<br/>more musical, with larger scoring.

This is Finale<br/>outputing to two separate MIDI devices. One MIDI device is relayed through<br/>Fractal Tune Smithy 3 (beta) to GPO Studio; FTS does the pitch-bend<br/>retuning on each channel, as we&apos;ve discussed previously in this thread. The<br/>other MIDI device is sent from Finale directly to VAZ Modular 3 with one<br/>instance of Rhino. FTS and Rhino are both using the same &quot;.tun&quot; files for<br/>tuning.</p><p>This also shows that it&apos;s possible to combine Finale-&gt;FTS-&gt;GPO with<br/>Finale-&gt;VAZ to use Rhino or VAZ sounds with the orchestra.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p><p>----<br/>PS, in the &quot;other non-essential details department&quot;: The first time I<br/>tried this, yesterday, VAZ/Rhino kept crashing every few seconds whenever I<br/>would switch to/from the &quot;piano&quot; part for editing, and I almost gave up on<br/>the whole scheme.

I also<br/>discovered yesterday that the GPO &quot;keyswitch&quot; pizzicato/arco shifting<br/>apparently does not work when the signal is routed through FTS; I&apos;ll try to<br/>get to the bottom of that problem later with Robert.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2005 3:56:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 12:45 PM 10/22/2005, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Hello all...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here is another experiment with Garritan Personal Orchestra, perhaps a bit<br/>&gt;more musical, with larger scoring.
