I didn&apos;t mean to suggest that<br/>accessibility is a more important goal than self-expression.  By all<br/>means, honesty of expression is the utmost priority in the creation of<br/>music.  However, one must also be honest with one&apos;s self regarding<br/>whether it should be expected that other people enjoy one&apos;s music.</p><p>What I was referring to (with the whole &quot;Vin Diesel--Prom Dress&quot;<br/>thing) is what I&apos;ve seen as people trying to make tunings do things<br/>they aren&apos;t really well-suited to.  Tunings have strengths and<br/>weaknesses, and not all tunings lend themselves to the same sort of<br/>compositional approaches used in a lot of classical training.  The<br/>&quot;pop song&quot; is a format, typically based on simple vertical structures<br/>and repetitive horizontal patterns and often with an emphasis on a<br/>driving rhythm, not something that is necessarily &quot;accessible&quot;.  The<br/>pop song format relies on different devices to engage interest than<br/>most classical formats, and frankly I just don&apos;t find a lot of tunings<br/>compatible with the sorts of devices that engage my interest in<br/>classical compositions.  A lot of tunings lend themselves much more<br/>readily to simple progressions and minimal melodies than they do to<br/>intricate ornamentation and lots of modulation, at least in my limited<br/>human experience.  This is one of the reasons I find about 80% of,<br/>say, Easley Blackwood&apos;s compositions rather unpleasant: they ignore<br/>the strengths of the tunings for the purpose of exemplifying all the<br/>&quot;interesting&quot; theoretical possibilities they hold.  Since pop songs<br/>are by nature much much simpler, it&apos;s easier to orient them toward<br/>exploiting the scant strengths of some of the more unusual tunings.  I<br/>didn&apos;t mean to disparage the efforts of any of y&apos;all that are more<br/>classically-oriented; with rare exception, the composers on this list<br/>are fantastic about playing to the strengths of the tunings they explore.</p><p>It&apos;s really just that a lot of people disparage tunings like 11, 15,<br/>and 16, and I think the reason for this is because a lot of music<br/>written for these tunings is written in formats for which the tunings<br/>are not well-suited.  It&apos;s my belief that the pop song format, because<br/>of its simplicity, allows greater tuning flexibility; and in fact,<br/>that&apos;s what I&apos;m hoping to prove with my music: it&apos;s possible to write<br/>a decent pop song in almost *any* tuning.  On the other hand, a<br/>symphony in 11-EDO or 16-EDO would probably sound god-awful to just<br/>about anybody, unless it was REALLY carefully composed.</p><p>Hope this clarifies a few things.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i agree fully.<br/>&gt;  i would add the idea of accessibility is impossible to determine.<br/>&gt;  Nothing is more inaccessible to many than music of whole cultures on<br/>&gt; the globe, many which have existed and withstood generations of these<br/>&gt; people .
