In other words, if you start with a bar that plays a440 Hz, with overtones at 1220 Hz and higher, then shave off some of the middle, the fundamental drops to perhaps 400 Hz, but the overtone stays close to 1220 Hz. Keep shaving off the middle until you end up with a fundamental at 305 Hz, and the 1220 Hz overtone is now two octaves higher than the fundamental, and the sound is sweet. The overtones do drift around in unpredictable ways, though. And they move down as the fundamental drops, but slower. The idea is to have them move closer to an integral relationship to each other. Measure, write down what you find, change the bar more in some manner, measure again, and repeat until you understand the material and how changes affect it.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Through a friend I have access to a metal working shop that mostly deals<br/>&gt; with aluminum - especially chunks of it.

I&apos;m looking for new sound which to sample<br/>or use stretched by Paul&apos;s Extreme Sound Stretch to use as a &quot;pad&quot; or<br/>&quot;wash&quot; (whatever term is current :-)</p><p>What I do have in my hands (which is NOT the bell I mentioned) is the<br/>deadest piece of aluminum I have ever heard. It was a shock that I could<br/>create a piece of metal that sounded like cardboard. I need to post some<br/>pictures.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Aug 21, 2012 at 3:29 PM, prentrodgers &lt;prentrodgers@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My first metalophones were 1/2&quot; galvanized conduit electrical pipes, which<br/>&gt; we cut to lengths based on listening and a tuning device.
