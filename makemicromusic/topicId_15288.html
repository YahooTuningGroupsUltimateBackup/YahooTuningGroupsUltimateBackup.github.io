I retuned a scale with one of my tunings; in<br/>this case, the interval between C and C# should be 87.9 cents.  I used<br/>all three methods: pitch bend, pitch bend without channel swapping and<br/>midi tuning standard.

I set up the Scala relay to send/recieve<br/>from the same bus and crossed my fingers. No<br/>luck---if I start up Cubase first and then press<br/>the &quot;start relaying&quot; button, Scala gives me an<br/>error on trying to open the midi device. If I<br/>start relaying before I open Cubase, I am able<br/>to record a new midi track with MPU-401 as input,<br/>but it remains blank.</p><p>I&apos;m not terribly stuck on Cubase. I&apos;d settle<br/>for:<br/>Cubase midi editor---&gt;midi file---&gt;Scala- --&gt;<br/>successfully retuned midi file---&gt;vst host---&gt;<br/>successfully retuned audio file.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Everyone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!
