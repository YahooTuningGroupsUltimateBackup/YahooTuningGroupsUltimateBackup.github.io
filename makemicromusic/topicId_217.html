I bought the best headphones I could find at a<br/>regular store: Sony MDR-CD570.  They&apos;re pretty good, but I still think that<br/>the bass response isn&apos;t so hot with any headphones.</p><p>What I usually end up doing is making a preliminary CD of the music,<br/>listening on the &quot;bigger&quot; stereo in the living room, and then possibly<br/>adjusting some of the bass instruments downward before re-recording.  Another<br/>thing I sometimes do is record to hard disk (WAV files) then use CoolEdit&apos;s<br/>frequency analysis tool in real time to watch the changing waveform.  I can<br/>often tell if the bass is too heavy just by watching the waves for a while.</p><p>Anyone out there have a better recommendation for headphones?</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/2/2001 10:50:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Rick</p><p>Here is a review of the Grados.  Worth looking into.</p><p><a href="http://www.streettech.com/archives_Gadget/SR60Headphones.html">http://www.streettech.com/archives_Gadget/SR60Headphones.html</a></p><p>I also have a pair of Sennheisers that I don&apos;t like nearly as much,<br/>but that could be because I don&apos;t have the proper amplifier for them.<br/>I use Mackie HR824&apos;s for mixing, which I think are great if colored&apos;<br/>as well as car speakers, computer speakers and Kenwoods left over<br/>from the 80&apos;s :-)</p><p>Recently someone was telling me about a pair of JBL&apos;s that sound<br/>great and could be used for live performance so I am planning on<br/>checking them out.  I also want to get something for surround and am<br/>just looking.  BTW one of the best places I&apos;ve found to check out<br/>whats good is the users conference at digidesign.  Put in a search<br/>for best speakers or best mike and you will get some pretty informed<br/>opinions.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>8/3/2001 1:45:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;200108021717.NAA14322@...&gt;<br/>Rick  wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyone out there have a better recommendation for headphones?</p><p>Sennheiser HD 25 SP.  No problem with the bass.  They seem to like them at<br/><a href="http://headphone.com">headphone.com</a>, and also think they&apos;re cheap!</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
