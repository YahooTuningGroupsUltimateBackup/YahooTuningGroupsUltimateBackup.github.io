I like the bass part a lot<br/>better than the sax part - as was noted on facebook, and I agree,  I<br/>wandered a bit too much with the sax. However, the bass part came pretty<br/>easily.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Jun 14, 2011 at 7:06 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; A composition for 3 piece jazz band, tenor sax, fretless bass, and<br/>&gt; drums in 14 equal divisions of the octave.
