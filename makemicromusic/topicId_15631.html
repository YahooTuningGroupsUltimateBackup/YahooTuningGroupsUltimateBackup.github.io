I found all<br/>the comments valuable.  Not surprisingly, almost all of the<br/>commentary was over here on the MakeMicroMusic list which seems to be<br/>the &quot;real&quot; micro composition list these days.  The original comment<br/>should have, actually, been posted over here.  I will do that.  (I&apos;m<br/>reverting back to a bit of &quot;pre-history&quot;...)</p><p>In any case, OF COURSE, I am not trying to *prescribe* a working<br/>method for anyone but only stating my OWN PERSONAL PREFERENCE,  (I<br/>guess I&apos;m shouting for a minute, so you&apos;ll have to excuse me), that<br/>it seems that I have an awful lot to do in the Blackjack scale and,<br/>in fact, still don&apos;t even have a glimmer of what in the hell I&apos;m<br/>doing in it, so it might be wise for me to stick with it for a<br/>while... :)</p><p>Thanks again, everybody.  I&apos;ll be posting some links to recent<br/>pieces.  I have some MIDI prototypes, but I&apos;ve been waiting for the<br/>recordings of some &quot;real&quot; performances.  A recent version of my<br/>_Inner Voices_ with live percussionists was performed at William<br/>Paterson University, but it was not recorded, as I had assumed it<br/>would be...</p><p>JP</p></div>
