There are a couple of pretty big country radio stations, but I don&apos;t consider what they play country music anyway. Not a lot of great country pickers here...but, and I don&apos;t agree with this decision, the State legislature just made Rocky Mountain High by John Denver the State song. I see why they did it, but I don&apos;t like the song that much. Course, it&apos;s not a country song, light folk/pop might describe it better.</p><p>   Actually, there are a superb bunch of jazz musicians here, the equal of anywhere in the world...Jeff Jenkins, Dale Bruning, Greg Gisbert, Ron Miles, Eric Gunnison, Ken Walker, Paul Romaine, and many more...they are all highly regarded in the world of jazz, and have accompanied many top jazz artists when they tour here. And, earlier in the 20th century, the 5 Points area was a major stop for the big jazz players; it was nicknamed the Harlem of the West, lots of club action. Who would have guessed, but it&apos;s true. And, there&apos;s a pretty good theatre scene as well...the Denver Center for Performing Arts won a Tony in 1998 for best regional theatre, and a lot of big name plays come through here, and do very well. Hoping the microtonal scene will do the same thing someday...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
