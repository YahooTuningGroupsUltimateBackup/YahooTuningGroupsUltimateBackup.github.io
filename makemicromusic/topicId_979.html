NOte that it is a very<br/>preliminary section at present. However, could already<br/>be used for checking pitch reproduction of the soundcard<br/>to high accuracy using, e.g. the ocarina voice.</p><p>May have bugs in it.</p><p>While at it, I&apos;ve done a section on how to set FTS up<br/>so that one can show the FTS scales in SCALA,<br/>show current SCALA scale in FTS, and use the<br/>SCALA scales archive and list of modes in FTS as<br/>a drop list,<br/>and ditto for the SCALA list of modes.</p><p>Soon also hope to add the same kind of thing<br/>for the new SCALA list of chords, but everything<br/>is taking so long... :-( - well feels that way<br/>anyway, really because there is so much I<br/>want to do).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
