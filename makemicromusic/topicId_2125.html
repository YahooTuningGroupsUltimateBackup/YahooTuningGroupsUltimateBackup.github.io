Weird thing is that until Bob Gilmore wrote a biography and Philip Blackburn started producing his Partch series, Ben&apos;s liner notes in that LP may well have been - outside of &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; - about the most extensive writing on Partch&apos;s &apos;career&apos;.</p><p>&gt;This really neat album has liner notes by my NC homey Ben Johnston (who &gt;plays on a number of the pieces), and has the following pieces by Partch:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Rose<br/>&gt;The Wind<br/>&gt;The Waterfall<br/>&gt;The Intruder<br/>&gt;I am a Peach Tree<br/>&gt;A Midnight<br/>&gt;Farewell<br/>&gt;Before the Cask of Wine<br/>&gt;The Street</p><p>Those first nine were later released on CRI and Innova in more complete versions (if you don&apos;t know them, they are some of the more intimate pieces), and...</p><p>&gt;The Dreamer that Remains</p><p>...was the first Partch piece I played (and recorded). And I&apos;m sure Harry would have screamed about a pairing with Cage (and probably wouldn&apos;t have allowed it at all!).</p><p>Gee, Jacky, thanks for taking me down &quot;Memory Lane&quot;.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
