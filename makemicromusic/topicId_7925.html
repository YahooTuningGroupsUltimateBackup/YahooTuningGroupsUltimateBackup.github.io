In particular, apropos recent discussions on MMM, I<br/>&gt; appreciate the multiple file formats you offer, as well as the clear manner<br/>&gt; in which you present them; a good example is on the full lyre page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre/">http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (FireFox seemed to want that concluding forward slash...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bravo - now I&apos;m going to go back and check out some of your fiddling, and<br/>&gt; see if your head can keep up with your heart!! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3>Carl McTague &#x3C;box-0cccbec56b@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2004 8:50:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Prent,</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>My understanding is that most of the artifacts reported missing from<br/>the museum had in fact been safeguarded by the Iraqi curators months,<br/>and in some cases years, ahead of the war.  It took considerable time<br/>for the Col. Bogdanos&apos;s team to develop enough trust with the curators<br/>for them to disclose the artifacts&apos; hidden location.  The US military<br/>has decided that these holdings will remain in their hiding places<br/>until the security situation improves.</p><p>But many artifacts were in fact stolen---some by what appear to have<br/>been professionals with insider information, and others by improvising<br/>amateurs.  Most badly hit was the museum&apos;s collection of signature<br/>seals.  Many of the artifacts have been recovered both through<br/>road-stops and seizures, but many more have been recovered through a<br/>no-questions-asked amnesty program.  Incidentally, many stolen<br/>artifacts have been seized from Ahmed Chalabi, once favored by the US<br/>Defence Department (but never by the State Dept) as the future leader<br/>of Iraq.</p><p>In any case, many artifacts are still missing from the museum, and<br/>many more have been plundered from unexcavated sites, a topic which I<br/>have not even addressed here.  The FBI and international police<br/>organization Interpol maintain web-sites dedicated to the recovery of<br/>missing artifacts, where you can determine the current status of<br/>specific artifacts:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/arttheft/asia/iraq/iraqart.htm">http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/arttheft/asia/iraq/iraqart.htm</a><br/>  <a href="http://www.interpol.int/Public/WorkOfArt/Iraq/Items.asp">http://www.interpol.int/Public/WorkOfArt/Iraq/Items.asp</a></p><p>Let me add the caveat that all of the above information comes from the<br/>top of my head, and that I have not had a chance to follow the events<br/>for a few months; so there may be small factual errors and entirely<br/>missing recent developments.  More detailed and authoritative<br/>information is available from Col. Bogdanos&apos;s pentagon briefing:</p><p>  <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2003&m=September&x=20030910181723namfuaks0.6611139&t=usinfo/wf-latest.html">http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2003&m=September&x=20030910181723namfuaks0.6611139&t=usinfo/wf-latest.html</a></p><p>I believe several journalists are following this issue closely<br/>(including one I recall having been kidnaped), so more detailed<br/>information is almost certainly forthcoming.</p><p>In summary, although the number of artifacts reportedly stolen from<br/>the museum were initially inflated, the artifacts stolen both from the<br/>museum, and especially from unexcavated sites should absolutely not be<br/>shrugged off.  The US Government failed to adequately plan to<br/>safeguard these treasures.  In fact, were it not for the museum&apos;s<br/>curators, the large numbers of reportedly stolen artifacts would have<br/>been accurate.</p><p>Carl</p><p>&gt; Message: 7<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2004 14:45:28 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: The Lyre of Ur<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl,<br/>&gt; I enjoyed the War Piece most, but all three are terrific pieces with a<br/>&gt; very professional sound and movement. I also enjoyed the story.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in 2003 or so, I followed the story of the Lyre, but not with the<br/>&gt; kind of detail and color that you provided. I always enjoy a good<br/>&gt; story with my music. Didn&apos;t they find amost all of the 170,000 &quot;lost&quot;<br/>&gt; artifacts soon after they were &quot;reported&quot; lost? That is my<br/>&gt; recollection, but I could be wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Prent Rodgers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl McTague<br/>&gt; &lt;box-0cccbec56b@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have put a new piece online called &quot;The Lyre of Ur&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   <a href="http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre">http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2004 10:26:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;My understanding is that most of the artifacts reported missing from<br/>&gt;the museum had in fact been safeguarded by the Iraqi curators months,<br/>&gt;and in some cases years, ahead of the war.
