We are seeking sound works for &apos;Resonant Cities&apos;:<br/>Internet radio streaming that explore the sonic identity of our surrounding<br/>space and that engage with the fragmented &apos;noise&apos; of the city soundscape:<br/>people, traffic, communication intrusions, mobile phones, radio traffic,<br/>city wildlife, buildings...</p><p>We are particularly interested in audio works which involve one or several<br/>of the following ideas or processes:</p><p>- Acoustic Ecology<br/>- Acousmatics<br/>- Phonography<br/>- Sonic research<br/>- Radio art, Internet radio<br/>- Microsound<br/>- Lowercase sound<br/>- Internet communication media and audio streaming<br/>- Electronic communities<br/>- Artists&apos; software for sound and music<br/>- Sound work developed using open source processes and principles<br/>- Generative sound<br/>- Sound archives<br/>- Spoken word / oral history<br/>- Field recordings<br/>- The re-purposing / representing of existing analogue sound recordings,<br/>such as amateur recordings, scientific recordings, and accidental, lost or<br/>abandoned recordings</p><p>The works selected by the Drift team will then be curated into themed<br/>streams that will be available via this web site.</p><p>Our intention is to expand the audience for the work, encourage appreciation<br/>of sound art, and broaden access to a genre which is too often labelled as<br/>esoteric and inaccessible.</p><p>We cannot pay a fee for this opportunity, but we will facilitate the<br/>broadcast of your work.</p><p>Eligibility</p><p>- Open to artists, musicians, producers in the UK and across the globe.</p><p>DEADLINE: 31 OCTOBER 2003</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist</p><p> &quot;Welcome and explore and inquire into everything, new or old, that comes<br/>your way, and then build your own music on whatever your inner life has been able<br/>to take in and offer you back again.&quot; - Henry Cowell</p><p>&quot;Music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the Ideas, but a<br/>copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas. For this<br/>reason, the effect of music is so very much more powerful and penetrating than is<br/>that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music<br/>of the essence.&quot; - Schopenhauer, _The World as Will and Representation_</p><p>&quot;His music, far from being in the background of my life, was in the<br/>foreground.  It was he as a musician who accomplished what I dreamed of, and<br/>I followed as well as I could with the inferior power of words.  The ear is<br/>purer than the eye, which reads only relative meaning into words. Whereas<br/>the distillation of experience into pure sound, a state of music, is<br/>timeless and absolute.&quot; -Anais Nin on her brother Joaquin Nin-Culmell</p><p>&quot;...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ...<br/>improvisation is about a constant change.&quot; - Steve Beresford</p><p>improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the assumptions<br/>that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; - John Berndt<br/>Improvisation resists documentation - it celebrates the ephemeral, it<br/>perversely reminds us every second that everything dies. Much of the &quot;modern<br/>Westernized world&quot; isn&apos;t ready for this kind of news.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Any sufficiently advanced music is indistinguishable from noise&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;(after Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s aphorism that any sufficiently advanced</p><p>&gt; &gt;technology is indistinguisable from magic.)&quot; - John Chalmers, in email<br/>response<br/>to the quote _The Difference between Music and Noise is all in your Head_</p></div>
