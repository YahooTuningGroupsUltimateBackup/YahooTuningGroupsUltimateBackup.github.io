I didn&apos;t think much of the first 50 seconds but I<br/>suppose it set some kind of mood. The final 2 minutes sounded like<br/>something that I might imagine to be playing at a late night hip-hop<br/>rave party with lads and lasses dancing wildly and frenetically to the<br/>beat of your music. I rarely go out late at night so this is just my<br/>imagination. A bit scratchy in parts but it all came together with<br/>interestings rhythms in the final quarter of &quot;A Hint from those who<br/>passed away&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=19014 href="#19014">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 9:03:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>may I suggest opening an account on traxinspace?</p><p>many composers there<br/>On Thu, Jun 19, 2008 at 3:42 AM, raedkhashoukgi &lt;raedkhashoukgi@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Hi, two days ago I posted a song in my folder &quot;Raed&apos;s Music&quot;.

I just opened a Traxinspace account. Let&apos;s see what<br/>happens. I&apos;m actually interested in putting microtonal music in popular formats. Not for<br/>success, but to prove it is a completely valid artform not only for psychologicaly displaced<br/>or generaly hopeless people. The freaky microtonal genre (soundscapes and strange<br/>noises) is interesting too, but I&apos;ll get into that later.<br/>   Has anyone written with Kathleen Schlesingers Greek scales? That&apos;s what I&apos;m working on<br/>at the moment and it is really fun!<br/>    Well, I&apos;m gone for the weekend and will listen to all the music here on tuesday.<br/>   Let&apos;s change the world!!!</p><p>Greetings for now and more noise later.
