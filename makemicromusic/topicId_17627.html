I will try to address most<br/>of them, please bear with me.</p><p>The 19-tone layout I&apos;m looking for is one common to older pipe organs<br/>and harpsichords: the 7-naturals/5-accidentals Halberstadt keyboard,<br/>with split accidentals (subsemitones) and an extra accidental each<br/>between E-F and B-C. The default tuning would probably be 12-edo with<br/>accidentals tuned identically, and 19-edo as a second default. But I<br/>really want to be able to play user-defined tunings, such as:</p><p>!</p><p>256/243 - 16/15</p><p>9/8</p><p>32/27 - 6/5</p><p>5/4</p><p>- 81/64</p><p>4/3</p><p>45/32 - 64/45</p><p>3/2</p><p>128/81 - 8/5</p><p>21/16</p><p>16/9 - 9/5</p><p>15/8</p><p>- 243/128</p><p>2/1</p><p>BTW Kraig, thanks for the pointers on layouts and for the clavichord<br/>schematic. I liked your idea of two 19-tone layouts (38-key Bosanquet<br/>style) for use with different timbres, for use with pipe organ<br/>soundfonts. I&apos;ll be momentarily content to have a single 19-key<br/>Halberstadt!</p><p>Monz, I found a link about the Yamaha keyboard, but it sent me to an IBM<br/>patent site and I dead-ended there. And I agree with your frustrations:<br/>I&apos;m a strong proponent of the 19-tone keyboard for good and practical<br/>reasons. It would make a large and varied subset of tunings available<br/>for performance without having to punch in a new tuning on the fly. The<br/>split-key configuration would feel quite familiar under the hands of<br/>keyboard musicians everywhere. I don&apos;t think that such a MIDI keyboard<br/>would be of interest only to musicologists and for historical music<br/>performances (though that&apos;s nothing to sneeze at!). Many musicians<br/>perform world-music in non-western tunings, and it would be nice to have<br/>19 out of the 22 shrutis, or all 17 of the Persian scale, available at<br/>one time!</p><p>Andrew, I&apos;d love to collaborate on such a project with you. $ is indeed<br/>a problem! Please contact me off-list so we can chat a bit about this.</p><p>I intended a longer reply, but I don&apos;t want to push my luck with Yahoo!<br/>any further. Thanks to all who posted comments!</p><p>jls</p><p>PS: Nothing personal toward Kraig&apos;s reed organs, but I spent several<br/>years with a little reed organ while trying to teach myself harmony and<br/>counterpoint. Have you ever heard 12-edo chords on a reed organ??</p></div><h3><a id=17628 href="#17628">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Thompson &#x3C;microtonaldan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2007 7:29:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would love a 17-24 key to the octave midi keyboard. I think if the<br/>split keys contained a mechanism that allowed them to either play<br/>separately or be locked together, then the market could be greatly<br/>expanded and it could be attractive to some non microtonalists. The<br/>experience of a traditional twelve note mapping wouldn&apos;t have to be<br/>compromised, but there would be extra, conveniently placed, keys<br/>available for triggering loops, making different versions of the the<br/>same patch available or for sending other midi messages. It could be<br/>very useful for making impossible to play fingerings possible. I can<br/>picture the nonmicrotonal market being much bigger than the microtonal<br/>market for such a device. Perhaps, this would be the only way to make a<br/>product like this commercially viable. Microtonalists might miss out on<br/>some features that they would like, but at least it would be<br/>available.</p></div>
