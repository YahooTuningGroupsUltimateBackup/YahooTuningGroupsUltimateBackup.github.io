He really is a<br/>wonderful, high energy player, with a solid rhythmic pocket, and a<br/>wonderfully quirky vocalist too (we both share vocal duties)</p><p>&apos;prelude/jungle&apos;, &apos;bachelor&apos;s grove&apos; (yes we are married--it&apos;s the name of a<br/>famous haunted Chicago graveyard where Capone used to dump gangland murder<br/>victims), and &apos;plastic bathtub toys&apos; use Grady&apos;s &apos;Centaur tuning&apos;, although<br/>many of the synth patches are so FM-based, with their non-harmonic spectra,<br/>it&apos;s hard to notice. &apos;hommage a messiaen&apos; is a showcase for Paul Hahn&apos;s<br/>7-limit 32-consonance tuning. &apos;broad liquid&apos; is a drone, where I play with<br/>the filters to get the otonal series with the resonance, so the tuning is<br/>irrelevant. &apos;blood sacrifice at stonehenge&apos; is 7-tet. &apos;solid aviary&apos; is all<br/>over the map tuning wise--it was so free and Morton Subotnick &apos;Silver Apples&apos;<br/>like that tuning info is besides the point....it was pure synth fun!!!!</p><p>Thanks again Bill and Jon for your support and flattering comments; in the<br/>truest sense, we do it for the few like you who are in that subsection of the<br/>world population who share our quirky take on music.....</p><p>By the way, Bill, I&apos;m starting a seperate thread re: your disks...</p><p>Ciao!!</p><p>On Saturday 01 May 2004 06:49 pm, Bill Sethares wrote:<br/>&gt; I received my copy of &quot;Divide by Pi&quot; recently --<br/>&gt; Aaron K.
