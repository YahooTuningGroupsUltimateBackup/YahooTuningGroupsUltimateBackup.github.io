Look also at equal<br/>divisions of the 4/1 - for example 21st root of 4, aka<br/>10-and-a-half-tet. There&apos;s also that scale that Hanuman Zhang calls &quot;a<br/>very WOLF-colour-saturated version/mutant perversion of 11tET/EDO,&quot;<br/>or, occasionally, &quot;throbbin chthonic bleu&quot;: 7th root of 20/13.

The interface is pretty liberating and the &gt;&gt;possibilities for punishing discord and alien pandemonium are many! &gt;&gt;Anyway, keep up the good work and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find something &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;you &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;like and I&apos;ll try to check your 11-teter next time I drop by the &gt;&gt;library....btw, I&apos;m have a 14-tet classical guitar in the works &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;right &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;now .<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &gt;&gt;&lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi everybody!

It&apos;s at my soundclick site:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/1/cityoftheasleepmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/1/cityoftheasleepmusic.htm</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s called &quot;Breakdown Hives&quot; and is basically in 11-tET.  Well, &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;the &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;intro is actually based on the idea of two 11-tET guitars tuned 1 &gt;&gt;&gt;step of 22-tET apart, but the rest is straight-up 11.  I have &gt;&gt;&gt;honestly come to a point where I&apos;m absolutely tired of the &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;usually &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;approximated 3- and 5-limit sonorities and I want to play &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;something &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;that&apos;s really jarring and &quot;off&quot; to the western ear.  I&apos;m also &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;getting &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;tired of navigating all of these tightly-packed frets!  So I &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;think &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;for my next instrument, I&apos;m setting the following limitations: &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;1. fewer than 19 tones per 2/1 (or approximate 2/1)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Approximate 3/2&apos;s or 4/3&apos;s must be AT LEAST 15 cents off &gt;&gt;&gt;(preferably more).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;3. NO 5/4&apos;s or 6/5&apos;s closer to Just than those of 12-equal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I&apos;m only considering equal temperaments, since J.I. on guitar is &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;more &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of a bother than I want to deal with.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I&apos;m curious as to what anyone on this forum might suggest.  Right &gt;&gt;&gt;now, I&apos;m thinking either 13, 18, 10, or 14 equal divisions of the &gt;&gt;&gt;octave, or maybe even something non-octave.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Does anyone here have any suggestions on the matter?

Yes,<br/>you have answered many of my questions.  Let me answer some of yours,<br/>to clarify what I&apos;m looking for:</p><p>As far as other consonances I&apos;m looking to avoid, I&apos;d say 9:8&apos;s (I<br/>like my whole tones narrow, but wide could be cool also) and 16:9&apos;s,<br/>and also probably 7:4&apos;s since all of my current microgitarras<br/>approximate that interval.  I&apos;d also like to avoid the usual sixths.<br/>And yes, I want to avoid octave-equivalencies to these intervals as<br/>well, but not necessarily 2:1&apos;s themselves.  And I DEFINITELY want to<br/>avoid the LLsLLLs pattern.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any J.I. intervals in mind that I&apos;d like to approximate<br/>particularly well...it&apos;s more sort the general character that I&apos;m<br/>after.  Probably higher-limit stuff, though.  I would be cool with<br/>something close to a 9:5 minor seventh, but that&apos;s about it for the<br/>strictly low numbers.  The Phi thing really intrigued me because of<br/>the recursivity: difference tones being notes from the scale adds a<br/>sort of fractal dimension not found in most music.

What about<br/>&gt; the super fourth or subdiminished fifth (5:7) that is somewhat<br/>implied<br/>&gt; by the tritone? What about octave-extensions of the above ratios,<br/>such<br/>&gt; as 1:3, 3:8, 2:5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest avoiding either<br/>&gt; (a) all ratios between the integers 1 to 6, or<br/>&gt; (b) all ratios between the integers 1 to 9 excluding 7.<br/>&gt; (c) all ratios between the integers 2 to 6, or<br/>&gt; (d) all ratios between the integers 2 to 9 excluding 7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (a) and (b) would avoid octaves, while (c) and (d) would not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are there some ratios, such as those involving 7 or 11, that you<br/>might<br/>&gt; actually like to have _good_ approximations for, while avoiding the<br/>&gt; others?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think Graham Breed is on the right track.

So a just fifth is said to _generate_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pythagorean,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and a fifth narrowed by 1/6 to 1/3 of a syntonic comma generates<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course it&apos;s easier to do this using the logarithmic measure of<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, where the process of generating the scale then becomes one of<br/>&gt; &gt; merely taking sucessive _multiples_ of the generator and reducing<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; them<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; modulo 1200.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just in case there is anyone reading who doesn&apos;t know what phi is,<br/>&gt; &gt; phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 ~= 1.618<br/>&gt; &gt; It can be defined as that positive real number which is one more<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; its own reciprocal.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is, in a sense, the &quot;least rational&quot; of all real numbers because<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; needs the largest numerators and denominators to approximate it by a<br/>&gt; &gt; ratio. Sucessively better approximations to it are obtained as the<br/>&gt; &gt; ratio of successive pairs of numbers from the Fibonacci series<br/>&gt; &gt; 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,... where you can see what Carl mentioned, that<br/>&gt; &gt; it approximates 8:13. However it doesn&apos;t approximate it (or any<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; such ratio) sufficiently well for it to be recognisable as such.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are at least two different meanings of &quot;phi-generator&quot;. One is<br/>&gt; &gt; the frequency ratio 1:phi, the other is the 1/phi octave-fraction.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In cents, the first is<br/>&gt; &gt; ln(phi)/ln(2)*1200 ~= 833.09 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; The second is<br/>&gt; &gt; 1200/phi ~= 741.64 cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The first is the one that has the property Kraig mentioned, of<br/>&gt; &gt; difference tones also being in the scale (a harmonic-series scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; also<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; has this property of course, but is not distributionally even).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So when Kraig says he is dividing the octave by phi he seems to be<br/>&gt; &gt; confusing the two.

So rather than wait till the thread grows cold, I&apos;m sending<br/>this preliminary report to you now.  YA</p><p>-------------</p><p>Here&apos;s my report on some simple experiments on a guitar.  (If you&apos;re<br/>past this stage, there&apos;s probably not much new in it for you.)  I&apos;m<br/>pleased to say they were non-destructive esperiments, and can easily<br/>be repeated without any real expense.</p><p>I wrote, earlier:<br/>&gt; ... the fewer notes the EDO scale has to the octave (or<br/>&gt; double octave, per Graham), the weirder it may sound.  Particularly<br/>&gt; when the period doesn&apos;t divide 12, such as 2, 3, 4 and 6-EDO, we get<br/>&gt; some nice (easily-fingered) scales that don&apos;t remind us too inexorably<br/>&gt; of common repertoire music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance, 7-EDO is the theoretical Thai court music scale, and<br/>&gt; that sounds particularly rootless or restless (to me at least).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve long believed that any artist worthy of the name needs to be<br/>&gt; able to make the most of limited resources - as they are often a<br/>&gt; fact of life - and besides, the mental discipline of doing so is also<br/>&gt; a real challenge to creativity.  In any scale whatsoever, it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; wonderful exercise to try to make engaging music with, say, only<br/>&gt; three or four distinct pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For some nicely weird 11-EDO music, I recommend a listen to Bill<br/>&gt; Sethares&apos; &quot;The Turquoise Dabo Girl&quot;, from Xentonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6-EDO is of course the whole-tone scale that Debussy exploited so<br/>&gt; brilliantly.  But how about 5-EDO?  With its very limited gamut, and<br/>&gt; no point of harmonic repose, that should stretch musicianship and<br/>&gt; inventiveness pretty far ...</p><p>Lying in bed this morning, I had a silly idea.  What if the fingerboard<br/>of my guitar were made in rubber, and I stretched it, uniformly, by<br/>say 10%? - but left the bridge in the same place.  The frets would<br/>become 10% further apart, and the notes 10% higher (in relative<br/>frequencies 100 cents --&gt; 110 cents).  Or equivalently, and much more<br/>usefully, move the bridge one-eleventh of the length closer to the nut?</p><p>The numbers seemed quite good - to avoid any GOOD consonances<br/>(which are bad in this context), you&apos;d want the minor and major third<br/>and sixth, as well as the fourth, fifth and octave, to be significantly<br/>off.  That is, the notes from frets 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 12 shouldn&apos;t be<br/>too consonant.  With a 10% stretch, these turn into 330, 400, 550,<br/>770, 990, 1100 and 1320 respectively.  Only the last three are near to<br/>whole 12-EDO semitones, and maybe fiddling with the stretch factor<br/>could fix that.</p><p>But how easily could I adapt the guitar, perhaps by adding another<br/>bridge nearer the sound hole?</p><p>So I got out of bed, got a glass of water and went to take my tablets<br/>before grabbing the guitar.  Unfortunately, I slipped in a puddle on<br/>the tile floor in the kitchen (dog getting old, weak bladder) which<br/>sort of delayed proceedings while we cleaned up broken glass ... :-(</p><p>When I got the guitar, I saw I could easily slip a pen underneath the<br/>strings to act as a movable bridge, and tension it by jamming a thin<br/>bit of plastic (actually, the handle of a pink feather duster!) under<br/>one end.  The pen was a cheap gel one, with an almost straight plastic<br/>barrel, from K-Mart.  A ball-point would do just as well.</p><p>Success!  In no time, I was picking out &quot;tunes&quot; in my approximate<br/>11-EDO.</p><p>With the bridge almost at the edge of the soundhole (this is a flat-<br/>top Spanish guitar), I had very close to 10-EDO, and I&apos;m sorry to<br/>say, this was very tuneful indeed.  Only a couple of the intervals<br/>were bad enough for Igliashon&apos;s purpose, of having no readily<br/>available consonances.  I jotted down one of the tunes I picked, in<br/>what I can only think of as 10-EDO E minor; only the thirds are not<br/>really melodic.  I may convert that to a Scala .seq file to post to<br/>tuning-files to show what I mean about the thirds.</p><p>With a 20% stretch, the consonances turn into 360, 480, 600, 840,<br/>1080, 1200 and 1440 respectively.  But this (10-EDO) scale also<br/>includes 720, which is a passable fifth, and does give a perfect<br/>octave.</p><p>The 11-EDO setting (10% stretch) was more dissonant than the<br/>10-EDO, by far.  The fourths and fifths are really BAD, and that&apos;s<br/>good :-)  Fact, the only thing that sounds halfway good is playing<br/>diminished chord positions on the top four strings; they sound<br/>rather like ordinary diminished chords, but stretched (I can&apos;t call<br/>them &quot;augmented&quot;, can I?).  All the major, minor and dom seventh<br/>chord (fingerings, that is) that I tried do sound quite bad.  The<br/>minor chords were much better (therefore worse) than the others.<br/>(But see Caveat below.)</p><p>To avoid the octave completely, I tried 10.5-EDO.  This was even<br/>more successful than 11-EDO.  The minor chords were still<br/>acceptable, particularly in speed, but everything else was &quot;off&quot;.<br/>(Also see Caveat below.)</p><p>With 9-EDO, the resonance is weakened greatly with the bridge<br/>moved so far over the sound-hole.  However, I found it made for<br/>interesting arpeggio figures when shifting a diminished chord<br/>position or a barre chromatically up and down a few frets.<br/>(Also see Caveat below.)</p><p>One thing I did notice in all tunings was that fast melodic passages<br/>sound pretty good; again, especially in &quot;minor keys&quot;.  I suspect<br/>that only slow music, that emphasises the most discordant intervals,<br/>will sound &quot;weird&quot; enough for Igliashon&apos;s purposes.</p><p>Caveat:<br/>I should mention that in all of the above, I did not alter the basic<br/>tuning of the guitar, which would have become stretched fourths<br/>and a stretched third.   For example, in 9-EDO, the strings are<br/>tuned, not 5, 5, 5, 4 and 5 steps apart, but about 4, 4, 4, 3.5 and<br/>4 steps apart.   Unless the strings are an exact number of steps<br/>of your gamut apart, the chords are not drawn from the same gamut,<br/>since each string has its own tuning.  So the results above don&apos;t<br/>accurately represent 10-EDO, 10.5-EDO or 11-EDO, do they?<br/>Except on one string at a time.  Although, by chance, the strings<br/>happened to be almost in tune in 9-EDO.  (Actually, it&apos;s not chance,<br/>but maths - 4 steps of 9 is 444 cents, while 5 steps of 12 is 417.)</p><p>Therefore the conclusions I drew above about chords are<br/>probably wrong.  I need to retune the strings to notes of the<br/>n-EDO gamut I&apos;m using to be able to hear what chords really<br/>sound like in it.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>The point of the standard guitar tuning is to maximise playability;<br/>without shifting hand position, you can use up all your fingers (and<br/>no more!) to get different notes from one string, then move to<br/>the next string to continue the sequence of notes.</p><p>So I tried tuning the strings to the standard number of steps apart,<br/>in 9-EDO, by leaving the top E string fixed and dropping the others.<br/>All the strings were quite playable.  The chords I played then were<br/>at least all drawn from the same gamut.</p><p>(Side note:  after this retuning, by removing the movable bridge, I<br/>found that I had a usable non-harmonic tuning, with the notes tuned<br/>about 6.25, 6.25, 6.25, 5 and 6.25 steps apart.  This produces no<br/>recognisable harmonies, no matter how I finger chords, and the<br/>consonances you get in melodies played in close positions of the hand<br/>are limited to those of one tetrachord (fourth) at a time.  We might<br/>call this chance discovery an accidentally non-harmonic tuning - if<br/>that didn&apos;t cause any confusion.)</p><p>And yes, 9-EDO IS weird - especially melodically.  I hardly know how<br/>to make a tune in it.  Of course, almost every chord is wrong: the<br/>gamut consists of 0, 133, 267, 400, 533, 677, 800, 933, 1067, 1200<br/>cents above Doh.  So you get an equally-tempered augmented chord<br/>as your most consonant triad.  An interesting scale pattern is -<br/>l s l s l s<br/>Its inverse is -<br/>s l s l s l<br/>In 9-EDO, s=1 and l=2.</p><p>Translating these into 12-EDO, with s=1 and l=3 we get the scales:<br/>C D# E G Ab B C&#x9;and&#x9;C Db E F G# A C.  (The second scale is<br/>actually just a transposition of a mode of the first.)  Both have a<br/>number of harmonic chords, as follows -</p><p>The first has major triads - C E G and Ab C D# and E G# B,<br/>minor triads - C D# G and E G B and Ab B D#,<br/>and augmented triads - C E Ab and G B D#.</p><p>The second has major triads - Db F G# and F A C  and A Db E,<br/>minor triads - Db E G# and F G# C and A C E,<br/>and augmented triads - C E G# and Db F A.<br/>(As expected, these are transpositions of those of the first.)</p><p>The relevance of this to 9-EDO is that its third step, 400 cents,<br/>is exactly the fourth step of 12-EDO, a (rough) minor third.  So<br/>this interval is always available in 9-EDO, which makes it rather<br/>(sub-)harmonic.  This doesn&apos;t meet Igliashon&apos;s desire to eliminate<br/>all the usual consonances, as it leaves minor thirds and major<br/>sixths.</p><p>Back in 9-EDO, with s=1 and l=2, those two scales become:<br/>C D#- E G- Ab B- C&#x9;and&#x9;C Db+ E F+ G# A+ C,<br/>where by + and - I mean a pitch shift of 33 cents up or down.<br/>(With this convention we could notate the entire 9-EDO gamut as -<br/>C&#x9;Db+&#x9;D#-&#x9;E&#x9;F+&#x9;G-&#x9;G#/Ab&#x9;A+&#x9;B-&#x9;C<br/>0&#x9;133&#x9;267&#x9;400&#x9;533&#x9;677&#x9;800&#x9;&#x9;933&#x9;1067&#x9;1200.)<br/>The harmonic chords of these scales in 12-EDO become -</p><p>First scale - major triads - C E G- and Ab C D#- and E G# B-,<br/>minor triads - C D#- G- and E G- B- and Ab B- D#-,<br/>and augmented triads - C E Ab and G- B- D#-.</p><p>Second scale - major triads - Db+ F+ G# and F+ A+ C and A+ Db+ E ,<br/>minor triads - Db+ E G# and F+ G# C and A+ C E,<br/>and augmented triads - C E G# and Db+ F+ A+.</p><p>The major and minor triads all have -<br/>o&#x9;a fairly good major third of 400 cents<br/>&#x9;(well, we&apos;re used to hearing it as good!),<br/>o&#x9;a bad minor third of 267 cents, and<br/>o&#x9;a bad fifth of 677 cents.</p><p>The augmented triads are exactly as good as in 12-EDO.</p><p>It seems that 9-EDO is harmonically bad, compared with<br/>12-EDO.  For Igliashon&apos;s purposes, it&apos;s better than 12-EDO,<br/>but still probably not weird enough.</p><p>Now, I know that some people may say &quot;There are easier<br/>ways of showing this&quot;, and they may be right.  But for me,<br/>musically, there&apos;s no better way of finding something out<br/>than by trying it.</p><p>---</p><p>What about 5-EDO?  It&apos;s just every second note from 10-EDO;<br/>however, having the guitar tuned in 10-EDO doesn&apos;t necessarily<br/>make it easy to finger 5-EDO.  The notes are 240, 480, 720, 960<br/>and 1200.  The second note is a flattish fourth and the third is a<br/>sharpish fifth; altogether too consonant, I think.  This is, of course,<br/>the &quot;Javese Salendro, assumed&quot; scale reported by Ellis as number<br/>95 in his table of non-harmonic scales (p 518, &quot;On the Sensations of<br/>Tone&quot;, Hermann Helmoltz, translated by Alexander Ellis, Dover<br/>1954).  So I think we can scrub that one.</p><p>Maybe 5.5-EDO would sound good, but you&apos;d have to be nimbler<br/>than I am to play melodies in it by fingering every second fret<br/>with the guitar tuned in 11-EDO.  (I did try ...)</p><p>I&apos;ll probably revisit the 10-, 10.5- and 11-EDO cases again, with<br/>retuned strings this time.  But now, it&apos;s breakfast time!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.11.8 - Release Date: 10/5/05</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2005 10:51:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone named this scale yet?</p><p>It&apos;s called simply &quot;phi 13&quot; in tha Scala archive.

I&apos;m going to have to spend some time with this one, but<br/>it is DEFINITELY going to be useful down the line, when I start<br/>thinking about non-equal frettings.</p><p>&gt; I trust your ears. But I&apos;ve got bad news for you. ;-) I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;it gets any badder unless you either:<br/>&gt; (a) have fewer notes per octave, or<br/>&gt; (b) give up octaves,<br/>&gt; or both.</p><p>Indeed, it seems that way, but then you have to realize that there is<br/>a question of &quot;priority&quot; here: my highest priority is to avoid<br/>intervals that sound like fourth/fifths.  My second highest priority<br/>is to avoid &quot;normal-sounding&quot; major and minor thirds, since I&apos;ve<br/>already got 3 guitars to give me some unusual thirds.  After that,<br/>it&apos;s all just gravy.  And most of these suggested tunings don&apos;t seem<br/>to miss the 4th/5th by as much as I&apos;d like.  In fact, even giving up<br/>octaves doesn&apos;t seem to help much in that respect, since for<br/>stretched/compressed tunings the 4:3&apos;s and 3:2&apos;s are not mistuned by<br/>the same amount, leaving one of them nice and wolfy while the other<br/>is recognizable.</p><p>The more I look at it, the more it seems like 13-EDO is the way to go<br/>for this current project.  It misses 4:3 and 3:2 by a huge amount...I<br/>think the only temperament that misses them farther is 11-EDO, and I<br/>already have access to that temperament.  13 also misses 6:5 by ~40<br/>cents, its nearest approx. to 5:4 is closer to 16:13, and its<br/>wholetones are almost Just 10:9&apos;s.  In a sense, I think 13 is the<br/>yard-stick I&apos;m using to measure everything else, since that was my<br/>original impulse.  However, all these suggestions are absolutely<br/>fascinating, and there are more than a few I hope to explore in the<br/>future.  I really need to get something more readily retunable than a<br/>guitar....</p><p>In the meantime, I&apos;d really like to hear more composers try their<br/>hands at these theoretically &apos;maximum dissonance&apos; tunings...and not<br/>just for dissonant music, either!</p><p>-Igs</p><p>&gt; The more notes you have per octave the easier it gets to find<br/>&gt; something vaguely diatonic. If you stopped at 10 notes of this<br/>&gt; phi-generated scale, then it would be better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I think you&apos;re not only trying to avoid 5-limit JI<br/>approximations,<br/>&gt; but also approximations to intervals of 12-equal. And these scales<br/>do<br/>&gt; have 100 cent steps, and sometimes two in a row.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In fact it&apos;s very very close to subset of 36-equal, which<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t seem like the most dissonant tuning out there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes it is essentially a subset of 36-equal (and so of 72-equal), but<br/>&gt; as Erv Wilson notes, on the last page of<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/tres.PDF</a><br/>&gt; 72-ET contains both the best and the worst.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The golden generator 50/72 oct (or equivalently 22/72 oct) just<br/>&gt; happens to be the one whose multiples take the longest to hit a<br/>&gt; consonance and that hits the fewest consonances per note. George<br/>&gt; Secor&apos;s miracle generator of 7/72 is the opposite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm...I dunno about this one.  It&apos;s a cool idea, to be sure, but<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe this recursive combinational tone idea is a little too<br/>&gt; &gt; impractical for this current project of mine.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, I did just recently notice that 23-EDO contains very<br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; approximations to both Phi and Pi, as well as a host of other<br/>bizarre<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals.  However, it violates my first criterion (less than 19<br/>&gt; &gt; steps per approximate 2:1), so maybe 11.5-EDO?  i&apos;ll have to play<br/>&gt; &gt; around a bit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could try using 7/23 oct as the generator (~365 cents) and stop<br/>at<br/>&gt; 10 notes. But this gives you better 8:9s than the 11/36 oct<br/>generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you wanted primarily to get as far away from any 12-equal<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; as possible then I&apos;d advise scrapping the octave and using a<br/>generator<br/>&gt; which is some noble multiple of the 12-equal semitone. The simplest<br/>&gt; are 100*phi = 161.8-cET (7.4-ET) and 100/phi = 61.8-cET (19.4-ET)<br/>but<br/>&gt; these probably have too few and too many notes respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is interesting<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SilverRatio.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SilverRatio.html</a><br/>&gt; but it gives us noble ratios _further_ from 1, whereas we need them<br/>&gt; closer to 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please read<br/>&gt; &quot;The Noble Mediant: Complex ratios and metastable musical<br/>intervals&quot;<br/>&gt; by Margo Schulter and myself.

So rather than wait till the thread grows cold, I&apos;m<br/>sending<br/>&gt; this preliminary report to you now.  YA<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s my report on some simple experiments on a guitar.  (If<br/>you&apos;re<br/>&gt; past this stage, there&apos;s probably not much new in it for you.)  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; pleased to say they were non-destructive esperiments, and can easily<br/>&gt; be repeated without any real expense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote, earlier:<br/>&gt; &gt; ... the fewer notes the EDO scale has to the octave (or<br/>&gt; &gt; double octave, per Graham), the weirder it may sound.<br/>Particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; when the period doesn&apos;t divide 12, such as 2, 3, 4 and 6-EDO, we<br/>get<br/>&gt; &gt; some nice (easily-fingered) scales that don&apos;t remind us too<br/>inexorably<br/>&gt; &gt; of common repertoire music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For instance, 7-EDO is the theoretical Thai court music scale,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; that sounds particularly rootless or restless (to me at least).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve long believed that any artist worthy of the name needs to be<br/>&gt; &gt; able to make the most of limited resources - as they are often a<br/>&gt; &gt; fact of life - and besides, the mental discipline of doing so is<br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt; a real challenge to creativity.  In any scale whatsoever, it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; wonderful exercise to try to make engaging music with, say, only<br/>&gt; &gt; three or four distinct pitches.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For some nicely weird 11-EDO music, I recommend a listen to Bill<br/>&gt; &gt; Sethares&apos; &quot;The Turquoise Dabo Girl&quot;, from Xentonality.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 6-EDO is of course the whole-tone scale that Debussy exploited so<br/>&gt; &gt; brilliantly.  But how about 5-EDO?  With its very limited gamut,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; no point of harmonic repose, that should stretch musicianship and<br/>&gt; &gt; inventiveness pretty far ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lying in bed this morning, I had a silly idea.  What if the<br/>fingerboard<br/>&gt; of my guitar were made in rubber, and I stretched it, uniformly, by<br/>&gt; say 10%? - but left the bridge in the same place.  The frets would<br/>&gt; become 10% further apart, and the notes 10% higher (in relative<br/>&gt; frequencies 100 cents --&gt; 110 cents).  Or equivalently, and much<br/>more<br/>&gt; usefully, move the bridge one-eleventh of the length closer to the<br/>nut?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The numbers seemed quite good - to avoid any GOOD consonances<br/>&gt; (which are bad in this context), you&apos;d want the minor and major<br/>third<br/>&gt; and sixth, as well as the fourth, fifth and octave, to be<br/>significantly<br/>&gt; off.  That is, the notes from frets 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 12<br/>shouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; too consonant.  With a 10% stretch, these turn into 330, 400, 550,<br/>&gt; 770, 990, 1100 and 1320 respectively.  Only the last three are near<br/>to<br/>&gt; whole 12-EDO semitones, and maybe fiddling with the stretch factor<br/>&gt; could fix that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But how easily could I adapt the guitar, perhaps by adding another<br/>&gt; bridge nearer the sound hole?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I got out of bed, got a glass of water and went to take my<br/>tablets<br/>&gt; before grabbing the guitar.  Unfortunately, I slipped in a puddle<br/>on<br/>&gt; the tile floor in the kitchen (dog getting old, weak bladder) which<br/>&gt; sort of delayed proceedings while we cleaned up broken glass ... :-(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I got the guitar, I saw I could easily slip a pen underneath<br/>the<br/>&gt; strings to act as a movable bridge, and tension it by jamming a thin<br/>&gt; bit of plastic (actually, the handle of a pink feather duster!)<br/>under<br/>&gt; one end.  The pen was a cheap gel one, with an almost straight<br/>plastic<br/>&gt; barrel, from K-Mart.  A ball-point would do just as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Success!  In no time, I was picking out &quot;tunes&quot; in my approximate<br/>&gt; 11-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the bridge almost at the edge of the soundhole (this is a flat-<br/>&gt; top Spanish guitar), I had very close to 10-EDO, and I&apos;m sorry to<br/>&gt; say, this was very tuneful indeed.  Only a couple of the intervals<br/>&gt; were bad enough for Igliashon&apos;s purpose, of having no readily<br/>&gt; available consonances.  I jotted down one of the tunes I picked, in<br/>&gt; what I can only think of as 10-EDO E minor; only the thirds are not<br/>&gt; really melodic.  I may convert that to a Scala .seq file to post to<br/>&gt; tuning-files to show what I mean about the thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With a 20% stretch, the consonances turn into 360, 480, 600, 840,<br/>&gt; 1080, 1200 and 1440 respectively.  But this (10-EDO) scale also<br/>&gt; includes 720, which is a passable fifth, and does give a perfect<br/>&gt; octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 11-EDO setting (10% stretch) was more dissonant than the<br/>&gt; 10-EDO, by far.  The fourths and fifths are really BAD, and that&apos;s<br/>&gt; good :-)  Fact, the only thing that sounds halfway good is playing<br/>&gt; diminished chord positions on the top four strings; they sound<br/>&gt; rather like ordinary diminished chords, but stretched (I can&apos;t call<br/>&gt; them &quot;augmented&quot;, can I?).  All the major, minor and dom seventh<br/>&gt; chord (fingerings, that is) that I tried do sound quite bad.  The<br/>&gt; minor chords were much better (therefore worse) than the others.<br/>&gt; (But see Caveat below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To avoid the octave completely, I tried 10.5-EDO.  This was even<br/>&gt; more successful than 11-EDO.  The minor chords were still<br/>&gt; acceptable, particularly in speed, but everything else was &quot;off&quot;.<br/>&gt; (Also see Caveat below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With 9-EDO, the resonance is weakened greatly with the bridge<br/>&gt; moved so far over the sound-hole.  However, I found it made for<br/>&gt; interesting arpeggio figures when shifting a diminished chord<br/>&gt; position or a barre chromatically up and down a few frets.<br/>&gt; (Also see Caveat below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I did notice in all tunings was that fast melodic passages<br/>&gt; sound pretty good; again, especially in &quot;minor keys&quot;.  I suspect<br/>&gt; that only slow music, that emphasises the most discordant intervals,<br/>&gt; will sound &quot;weird&quot; enough for Igliashon&apos;s purposes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Caveat:<br/>&gt; I should mention that in all of the above, I did not alter the basic<br/>&gt; tuning of the guitar, which would have become stretched fourths<br/>&gt; and a stretched third.   For example, in 9-EDO, the strings are<br/>&gt; tuned, not 5, 5, 5, 4 and 5 steps apart, but about 4, 4, 4, 3.5 and<br/>&gt; 4 steps apart.   Unless the strings are an exact number of steps<br/>&gt; of your gamut apart, the chords are not drawn from the same gamut,<br/>&gt; since each string has its own tuning.  So the results above don&apos;t<br/>&gt; accurately represent 10-EDO, 10.5-EDO or 11-EDO, do they?<br/>&gt; Except on one string at a time.  Although, by chance, the strings<br/>&gt; happened to be almost in tune in 9-EDO.  (Actually, it&apos;s not<br/>chance,<br/>&gt; but maths - 4 steps of 9 is 444 cents, while 5 steps of 12 is 417.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Therefore the conclusions I drew above about chords are<br/>&gt; probably wrong.  I need to retune the strings to notes of the<br/>&gt; n-EDO gamut I&apos;m using to be able to hear what chords really<br/>&gt; sound like in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point of the standard guitar tuning is to maximise playability;<br/>&gt; without shifting hand position, you can use up all your fingers (and<br/>&gt; no more!) to get different notes from one string, then move to<br/>&gt; the next string to continue the sequence of notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I tried tuning the strings to the standard number of steps apart,<br/>&gt; in 9-EDO, by leaving the top E string fixed and dropping the others.<br/>&gt; All the strings were quite playable.  The chords I played then were<br/>&gt; at least all drawn from the same gamut.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Side note:  after this retuning, by removing the movable bridge, I<br/>&gt; found that I had a usable non-harmonic tuning, with the notes tuned<br/>&gt; about 6.25, 6.25, 6.25, 5 and 6.25 steps apart.  This produces no<br/>&gt; recognisable harmonies, no matter how I finger chords, and the<br/>&gt; consonances you get in melodies played in close positions of the<br/>hand<br/>&gt; are limited to those of one tetrachord (fourth) at a time.  We might<br/>&gt; call this chance discovery an accidentally non-harmonic tuning - if<br/>&gt; that didn&apos;t cause any confusion.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yes, 9-EDO IS weird - especially melodically.  I hardly know how<br/>&gt; to make a tune in it.  Of course, almost every chord is wrong: the<br/>&gt; gamut consists of 0, 133, 267, 400, 533, 677, 800, 933, 1067, 1200<br/>&gt; cents above Doh.  So you get an equally-tempered augmented chord<br/>&gt; as your most consonant triad.  An interesting scale pattern is -<br/>&gt; l s l s l s<br/>&gt; Its inverse is -<br/>&gt; s l s l s l<br/>&gt; In 9-EDO, s=1 and l=2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Translating these into 12-EDO, with s=1 and l=3 we get the scales:<br/>&gt; C D# E G Ab B C&#x9;and&#x9;C Db E F G# A C.  (The second scale<br/>is<br/>&gt; actually just a transposition of a mode of the first.)  Both have a<br/>&gt; number of harmonic chords, as follows -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first has major triads - C E G and Ab C D# and E G# B,<br/>&gt; minor triads - C D# G and E G B and Ab B D#,<br/>&gt; and augmented triads - C E Ab and G B D#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second has major triads - Db F G# and F A C  and A Db E,<br/>&gt; minor triads - Db E G# and F G# C and A C E,<br/>&gt; and augmented triads - C E G# and Db F A.<br/>&gt; (As expected, these are transpositions of those of the first.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The relevance of this to 9-EDO is that its third step, 400 cents,<br/>&gt; is exactly the fourth step of 12-EDO, a (rough) minor third.  So<br/>&gt; this interval is always available in 9-EDO, which makes it rather<br/>&gt; (sub-)harmonic.  This doesn&apos;t meet Igliashon&apos;s desire to eliminate<br/>&gt; all the usual consonances, as it leaves minor thirds and major<br/>&gt; sixths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in 9-EDO, with s=1 and l=2, those two scales become:<br/>&gt; C D#- E G- Ab B- C&#x9;and&#x9;C Db+ E F+ G# A+ C,<br/>&gt; where by + and - I mean a pitch shift of 33 cents up or down.<br/>&gt; (With this convention we could notate the entire 9-EDO gamut as -<br/>&gt; C&#x9;Db+&#x9;D#-&#x9;E&#x9;F+&#x9;G-&#x9;G#/Ab&#x9;A+&#x9;B-<br/>&#x9;C<br/>&gt; 0&#x9;133&#x9;267&#x9;400&#x9;533&#x9;677&#x9;800&#x9;&#x9;933<br/>&#x9;1067&#x9;1200.)<br/>&gt; The harmonic chords of these scales in 12-EDO become -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First scale - major triads - C E G- and Ab C D#- and E G# B-,<br/>&gt; minor triads - C D#- G- and E G- B- and Ab B- D#-,<br/>&gt; and augmented triads - C E Ab and G- B- D#-.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Second scale - major triads - Db+ F+ G# and F+ A+ C and A+ Db+ E ,<br/>&gt; minor triads - Db+ E G# and F+ G# C and A+ C E,<br/>&gt; and augmented triads - C E G# and Db+ F+ A+.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The major and minor triads all have -<br/>&gt; o&#x9;a fairly good major third of 400 cents<br/>&gt; &#x9;(well, we&apos;re used to hearing it as good!),<br/>&gt; o&#x9;a bad minor third of 267 cents, and<br/>&gt; o&#x9;a bad fifth of 677 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The augmented triads are exactly as good as in 12-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems that 9-EDO is harmonically bad, compared with<br/>&gt; 12-EDO.  For Igliashon&apos;s purposes, it&apos;s better than 12-EDO,<br/>&gt; but still probably not weird enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I know that some people may say &quot;There are easier<br/>&gt; ways of showing this&quot;, and they may be right.  But for me,<br/>&gt; musically, there&apos;s no better way of finding something out<br/>&gt; than by trying it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about 5-EDO?  It&apos;s just every second note from 10-EDO;<br/>&gt; however, having the guitar tuned in 10-EDO doesn&apos;t necessarily<br/>&gt; make it easy to finger 5-EDO.  The notes are 240, 480, 720, 960<br/>&gt; and 1200.  The second note is a flattish fourth and the third is a<br/>&gt; sharpish fifth; altogether too consonant, I think.  This is, of<br/>course,<br/>&gt; the &quot;Javese Salendro, assumed&quot; scale reported by Ellis as number<br/>&gt; 95 in his table of non-harmonic scales (p 518, &quot;On the Sensations<br/>of<br/>&gt; Tone&quot;, Hermann Helmoltz, translated by Alexander Ellis, Dover<br/>&gt; 1954).  So I think we can scrub that one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe 5.5-EDO would sound good, but you&apos;d have to be nimbler<br/>&gt; than I am to play melodies in it by fingering every second fret<br/>&gt; with the guitar tuned in 11-EDO.  (I did try ...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll probably revisit the 10-, 10.5- and 11-EDO cases again, with<br/>&gt; retuned strings this time.

The pen was a cheap gel one, with an almost straight<br/>&gt; &gt; plastic barrel, from K-Mart.  A ball-point would do just as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Success!

But hey, for zero cost,<br/>who&apos;s complaining.</p><p>That is, it is very inaccurate if you determine the new bridge<br/>position for N-EDO by moving it until the Nth fret gives an octave.<br/>For example, in the case of 10-EDO, if you place it so the 10th fret<br/>gives an octave you will have errors of 10 to 17 cents on frets 2 thru 8.</p><p>If instead you move the bridge so that the 5th fret gives a<br/>half-octave then the errors for frets 1 thru 6 will be less than 5<br/>cents, although frets 8 and beyond will be unusable.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
