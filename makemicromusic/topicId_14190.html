Seems to be Filmi.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood</a></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmi</a></p><p>Filmi is Indian popular music as written and performed for Indian<br/>cinema. The various Indian cinema industries produce thousands of<br/>films a year, most of which are musicals and feature elaborate song<br/>and dance numbers. There is constant work for pop music composers Â—<br/>or music directors, to use the Indian term. Movie soundtracks are<br/>released as tapes and CDs, before the movie is released. They<br/>dominate pop music.</p><p>Filmi is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of<br/>Ardeshir M. Irani&apos;s Alam Ara and its popular soundtrack. In the<br/>earliest years of the Indian cinema, filmi was generally Indian<br/>(classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements.<br/>Over the years, the Western elements have increased significantly.</p><p>How much of current filmi is &quot;Western&quot; or &quot;Indian&quot; in style is a<br/>matter of dispute, as is the desirability of the increasing<br/>internationalization of a formerly regional style. Some fans prefer<br/>the classic music of the past; others see it as old-fashioned and<br/>whole-heartedly embrace novelty.</p><p>Filmi is also making converts and exerting influence beyond the<br/>usual Desi audiences. Western music stores carry Bollywood<br/>compilations. Baz Luhrman showcases the song &quot;Chamma Chamma&quot; from<br/>China Gate in his 2002 movie Moulin Rouge. A. R. Rahman, one of the<br/>most popular current music directors, now has a musical, Bombay<br/>Dreams, playing in London and New York.</p><p>((Internet radio links here too within article.))</p><p>===============================================================</p><p>This is some music from:</p><p><a href="http://www.gayaki.com">http://www.gayaki.com</a></p><p>The sound quality is poor and I think some songs are in 12<br/>as well.

The singers<br/>themselves do not always understand the words that they are<br/>singing.  There are simply too many languages.  Since this is not an<br/>impediment to the enjoyment of vocal music in India, it need not be<br/>an impediment to you.</p><p>...However, the situation may be different with the popular genres.<br/>Film songs have absorbed many Western influences.  For such Western<br/>inspired genres, there may be a heavy reliance upon chords.</p><p>Are the pitches in the Indian scales the same as in the Western<br/>scale?</p><p>Popular genre such as film songs may use the standard Western<br/>tempered scale.  However, traditional Indian music is definitely not<br/>based upon the tempered scale.  It is instead based upon some type<br/>of just intonation.  Therefore, the &quot;semitones&quot; will sometimes be<br/>more than 100 cents and at other times they will be less than 100<br/>cents.</p><p>Although there are constant debates as to exactly what the intervals<br/>should be, we may make a few general observations.</p><p>The natural 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th correspond to their UNTEMPERED<br/>Western counterparts.<br/>A minor 2nd is slightly flatter when descending compared to when it<br/>is ascending.<br/>A natural 7th is slight sharper when ascending and slightly flatter<br/>when descending.<br/>The minor 3rd and the minor 6th have different intervals depending<br/>upon other scalar characteristics.<br/>These are just rules of thumb, so they may not always be applicable.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p>Left side of page lists the many different genres of Indian music:</p><p><a href="http://www.musicindiaonline.com">http://www.musicindiaonline.com</a></p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>Talks of musical genres in India as well:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_India">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_India</a></p><p>Excerpt:</p><p>The biggest form of Indian pop music is filmi, or songs from Indian<br/>musical films.

Skipping down<br/> to:</p><p>PART II<br/>The Meaning of Culture</p><p> and reading to the bottom, you&apos;ll actually find some interesting<br/> stuff. Only excerpts are here on this post.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The function of the Hindi film, according to Shyam. Benegal, a noted<br/>Indian film&shy; maker, is to externalize an inner psychological conflict<br/>and handle the inner passion generated by social and political<br/>processes...These events and persons are both ideal types and<br/>representatives of different aspects of a fragmented self.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Does Indian mainstream cinema have a cultural identity that is<br/>predominantly and obviously Indian? Or, has it become rather hybrid<br/>with influences of Hollywood pervading the screen with sexual<br/>innuendoes and graphic violence?</p><p>Culture is not a rigid, static word...</p><p>It does not exist in a vacuum. Nor is it bound anymore within the<br/>framework of geographical parameters which are themselves constantly<br/>threatened by modern warfare and communicational globalisation via<br/>the electronic media. Culture therefore, is itself &quot;hybrid&quot; in its<br/>sense of defiance of all Western notions of what constitutes &quot;Indian<br/>Culture&quot;</p><p>Culture has initially meant, in our context, the monuments of<br/>antiquity, the temple sculpture of a glorious past, the texts of<br/>ancient scriptures, all &quot;the wonder that was.&quot; So when we turn to<br/>look at present&shy;day cultural practices, weighed down as we are, by<br/>the golden past and therefore, by a certain notion of culture, we<br/>react with incomprehension, dismissal, embarassment or shame.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Musical Metaphor:</p><p>Music in Indian cinema is unique in its cultural implications<br/>because it spells out the Indian&shy;ness of cinema even when the songs<br/>or the background score are influenced, inspired and now, even<br/>plagiarised from Western, African and Arabic hits. Music in Indian<br/>mainstream cinema defines a new synthesis of traditional and<br/>international genres of music. Each level involves such a synthesis<br/>that any one particular level cannot simply be reduced to another. A<br/>cinema song cannot be reduced to its classical or folk roots.</p><p>No moderm musical form from any part of the globe, including jazz,<br/>can boast of such diversity, richness, subtlety and reach as the<br/>Hindi film song can.  The Hindi film song has cut through all<br/>language barriers in India to engage in lively communication with a<br/>nation where more than 20 languages are spoken.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Politics of Silence as a Metaphor of the Oppressed :</p><p>&quot;Only in a sound film, can a director use silence for dramatic<br/>effecf&apos; wrote VY Perkins. Music director Bliaskar Chandavarkar<br/>says &quot;if you cannot express things through music, you can use<br/>silence which is likely to reveal more than what music or dialogue<br/>could have revealed.</p><p><a href="http://www.filmsound.org/india/">http://www.filmsound.org/india/</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p>If there is interest in the music...lower bass to slightly<br/>increase the quality of the musicical playback.</p><p><a href="http://www.gayaki.com/songs-of-Eight-Shani.html">http://www.gayaki.com/songs-of-Eight-Shani.html</a></p><p>Perhaps try:</p><p>Ishq Ishq</p></div><h3><a id=14205 href="#14205">ðŸ”—</a>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2006 3:45:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Stephen,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; ***********************************************************<br/>&gt; Supplemental: Richard Cooper comments on my music.

It has<br/>nothing to do with academics or facts or theories, and everything to<br/>do with the essence of what makes us human.</p><p>Consider films as an example.  There are plenty of flicks that have<br/>awesome special effects, lots of action and glory and romance, and<br/>they&apos;re pretty entertaining.  We sit in the theatre, our heart race<br/>rises, and we say it&apos;s good fun after work with friends.  And after a<br/>month or a year, we forget about it.  After all, there&apos;s a new movie<br/>showing, with a bigger budget and more effects!</p><p>On the other hand, there are other films which affect us differently.<br/>Maybe it wasn&apos;t quite as slick, the effects are pretty shoddy, etc.<br/>Sometimes we get confused by strange plot twists, and we&apos;re challenged<br/>to figure out just what&apos;s going on.  Nevertheless, something sticks in<br/>our minds.  When we leave the theatre, we see the world just a little<br/>bit differently.  Months and years later, we still find ourselves<br/>going back in our memory and turning the film over, pondering what it<br/>was that struck us.  If it affects us enough, it might even change the<br/>course of our life.</p><p>The experience of the 2nd film is completely different to the 1st, and<br/>it has little to do with entertainment.  The same goes for music, or<br/>any other media:  the majority of people simply want sensory candy to<br/>anesthetize their brain... but a few renegades actually listen in<br/>order to learn something:  not about theory or facts, but about the<br/>reality of our humanity.</p><p>I would recommend reading &quot;A Brave New World&quot; as an extreme example of<br/>exactly what I mean.  If you believe there&apos;s any truth to his message,<br/>it will really change your perspective.</p><p>Sorry if this is off-topic, but if nothing else it serves to<br/>underscore the important principle for any musician:  &quot;it&apos;s not about<br/>the theory.&quot;</p><p>-Chris</p></div><h3><a id=14257 href="#14257">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2006 10:55:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I also think that certain emotions exist only because of music, that<br/>&gt;they would not exist otherwise.</p><p>It seems true for me at least.</p><p>&gt; I needed go into the evidence of music in helping people learn</p><p>The famous &apos;Mozart&apos; experiments are a good example (the authors of at<br/>least one study take pains to point out that any subtle music works,<br/>but the media keeps reporting it as the &quot;Mozart effect&quot;).</p><p>Verbal crunching power -- the ability to speak well, learn new<br/>languages, fake accents, and do impersonations -- may be improved<br/>by listening to music.</p><p>The practice of following (let alone playing!) multiple simultaneous<br/>voices in counterpoint is obviously good mental exercise.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=14264 href="#14264">ðŸ”—</a>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2006 12:09:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  I also think that certain emotions exist only because of music , that<br/>&gt;  they would not exist otherwise.</p><p>This is an interesting corollary to the current trend in linguistic<br/>theory which asserts that language does not merely express thought,<br/>but is actually necessary to create it.

It<br/>has<br/>&gt; nothing to do with academics or facts or theories, and everything<br/>to<br/>&gt; do with the essence of what makes us human.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider films as an example.  There are plenty of flicks that have<br/>&gt; awesome special effects, lots of action and glory and romance, and<br/>&gt; they&apos;re pretty entertaining.  We sit in the theatre, our heart race<br/>&gt; rises, and we say it&apos;s good fun after work with friends.  And<br/>after a<br/>&gt; month or a year, we forget about it.

Nevertheless, something<br/>sticks in<br/>&gt; our minds.  When we leave the theatre, we see the world just a<br/>little<br/>&gt; bit differently.  Months and years later, we still find ourselves<br/>&gt; going back in our memory and turning the film over, pondering what<br/>it<br/>&gt; was that struck us.  If it affects us enough, it might even change<br/>the<br/>&gt; course of our life.</p><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277371</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The experience of the 2nd film is completely different to the 1st,<br/>and<br/>&gt; it has little to do with entertainment.  The same goes for music,<br/>or<br/>&gt; any other media:  the majority of people simply want sensory candy<br/>to<br/>&gt; anesthetize their brain... but a few renegades actually listen in<br/>&gt; order to learn something:  not about theory or facts, but about the<br/>&gt; reality of our humanity.</p><p>  Seriously now.

It&apos;s using the same seven note<br/>scale that we use, except that whereas we assign constant<br/>frequencies to the notes, this song changes which frequencies<br/>represent each note throughout the song.  Basically, the song is<br/>written with the same seven notes that western music is written<br/>with, it simply selects the frequencies for those notes from a<br/>different frequency scale.

I can&apos;t see how this is possible by the music<br/>&gt; &gt;    alone, except under the rarist circumstances. (&quot;Taps&quot; for<br/>example<br/>&gt; &gt;    as I mentioned a while back.) Are you talking about the lyrics<br/>&gt; &gt;    of a song? This is what is important to me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Like what is this without the lryics?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are absolutely correct that most pop music would have no<br/>meaning<br/>&gt; outside of the lyrics.  This is exactly the point!  You need to<br/>&gt; *begin* to listen to music that does.</p><p>++++ Chris</p><p>  I&apos;m not just talking about pop music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Listen to any instrumental music that is generally accepted<br/>as &quot;good,&quot;<br/>&gt; and instead of trying to describe how the music makes you feel in<br/>&gt; words, simply absorb it and let it move you without trying to<br/>classify<br/>&gt; or explain it.  Try to listen to the music in such a way that you<br/>get<br/>&gt; a glimpse of the mind of the person making it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this concept would be called &quot;mystical&quot; in religious<br/>language.<br/>&gt;  I think it&apos;s a healthy attitude in either case :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Chris<br/>&gt;</p><p>++++ Chris</p><p> I&apos;m not just talking about pop music.</p><p> I mentioned the body/spirit metaphor regarding music and lyrics<br/> previously. Maybe the concept of conscious/subconscious is a<br/> better one.</p><p> When one thinks of a individual (symbolic of a piece of music)<br/> we can call up various specific things about this person. Their<br/> name, actions they have taken, etc. This is the conscious part,<br/> the lyrics.</p><p> We also have established in our minds the quality of the character<br/> of this person based on these specifics. The end result is a<br/> feeling/belief we have about him. He is trustworthy/not trustworthy.<br/> He is kind/brutal. He is peaceful/aggressive.</p><p> Take the song &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for example. The lyrics are sweet<br/> and simple. The music is too. The music *has* to reflect the<br/> lyrics in this case (and many others).</p><p> Another self-evident example is the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;.<br/> If someone just becoming a citizen of the U.S. heard this song<br/> without the lyrics for the first time they *might* get a feeling<br/> about the U.S. , but no specifics.</p><p> The song &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; without the lyrics would not change<br/> anyone&apos;s life.</p><p> I guess music minus lyrics, is feeling something without<br/> understanding the reason why. One could say that that is<br/> the whole idea. I liken it to waking up and feeling a certain<br/> way because of a dream, yet not remembering the dream.</p><p> -Stephen</p></div><h3><a id=14320 href="#14320">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2006 10:04:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree with Jon.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; Stephen and all,<br/>&gt; &gt; This is not a general music and arts forum.
