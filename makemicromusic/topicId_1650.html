Fantastic percussion work. It sounds as if<br/>&gt;the percussion may be a part of the tuned texture. Right - wrong?</p><p>Thanks - and right - the rhythmic bed is basically a 3 against 2 pattern,<br/>and is integrated into the melodic/harmonic portions in the<br/>sense that (more or less) everything occurs on elements of<br/>the 3 by 2. Actually, some voices are 3 by 2, others 4 by 3,<br/>others 6 by 4, others 8 by 3, etc, but the point is that all<br/>of these provide accents and variations on the underlying 3 by 2.</p><p>&gt;How do you do it Bill?</p><p>I&apos;ll take this question literally.</p><p>The basic rhythmic motif was created with a Max program -<br/>superimposing the various rhythms and playing them in random 12-tet<br/>pitches. When I decided on the orchestration, I FFT&apos;d the<br/>timbres of the sounds (many of them quite inharmonic)<br/>and then re-tuned using a variant of the adaptive method<br/>(in this case a Matlab program) so as to maximize<br/>consonance (actually, to minimize the dissonance)<br/>at each time instant.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
