John, just want to thank you in public for a fascinating journey. No, not every day&apos;s work makes it for me (though I have a whole folder of favorites), but I always check the podcast bin and see what you&apos;ve been up to.

And I mean<br/>daily. And I mean priority. If you&apos;re out in Harvard Square from 6 to<br/>11 tonight, I&apos;m the guy playing acoustic guitar like a sitar with the<br/>guy playing doumbek like a tabla.

And I mean &gt;daily. And I mean priority.</p><p>Sorry, didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that no one else was! I know how hard it is to compose stuff, having just pulled two all-nighters trying to complete an 8-10 minute dance piece. John&apos;s work is an inspiration to me in that he has managed to create a system/setup with all the tools in place, and he can proceed to the lovely task of creating a new piece everyday without the hassles of figuring out software, balancing audio stuff, etc. I am about 95% of the way there myself, and it really is a wonderful thing to sit down and know that, in the main, the only impediment is a lack of muse. It has been uplifting to chart his course over a 1/2 year, and watch a fellow seeker.</p><p>It is a shame that your &apos;work&apos; is so little documented, but that is only a shame in the sense that &apos;we&apos; out here don&apos;t know of it. All the people around you, your active listeners, are (I am sure) having a good time.</p><p>Dang it, Paul, the cheapest mini-disc recorders and a quick-and-dirty mp3 encoding would delight a lot of people around here! Please consider sharing some sounds, even if they are in the lingua franca tuning.</p><p>If I post any of the dance piece it will have to be elsewhere, as the current version has not been non-12&apos;d. This is planned, as there are sections that can easily adapt to better tunings; this project (at least this first performance) was under such a time crush that I had to get things done very fast, and couldn&apos;t mull through my tuning options. But Joe P. will be happy to know that I am stressing Sonar greatly, running about 25 instances of softsynths and samplers of various kinds, and a good number of audio plugins as well. So far, no crashes, and a virtual recording/mixing room right here in the house. This is all going to morph into pieces for recorded and/or live electronics and live instrumental performance.</p><p>All part of the Grand Plan, grinding inexorably towards the horizon...</p><p>Play well, Paul, we&apos;ll be there in spirit!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=10151 href="#10151">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2005 12:08:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Dang it, Paul, the cheapest mini-disc recorders and a quick-and-dirty mp3<br/>&gt; encoding would delight a lot of people around here!

Oh, I see.</p><p>I agree with you in principle that we need to move past the days of hard media, etc. But I just subbed on a show for a guy who is a long-time drummer on Broadway, and I mentioned I&apos;d probably record the show on md so I could study before subbing. He said great, because he records all his shows that way and stored the mini-discs right along with a copy of the book, all for easy reference. In this case, the format was not only not history, it was the perfect match.</p><p>To answer Paul&apos;s question, I haven&apos;t invested in any new md recorders in a while. I simply bought a second Sharp 702 on eBay (as a backup unit) for about $60. All one needs to document transitory music experiences (like Paul, who plays with lots of different people in various situations) is a simple unit with decent fidelity, decent battery life, and low cost.</p><p>But I really *do* like that M-Audio unit. Probably will look at something in that are in the next year or two, we&apos;ll see how the technology/market shakes out.</p><p>One last thing: internal mics? You&apos;ve just signalled that you don&apos;t care about the quality of the recording, and might as well take a cassette recorder! I don&apos;t quite see the point of good specs, quality a/d and d/a conversion if you just end up using a mic built into the body of the unit. But I guess is all depends on what you need it for.</p><p>Good comparison on your site, Carl. Let me know if you find out if the M-Audio battery is easily replaceable...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=10154 href="#10154">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2005 6:34:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Try either the Edirol R-1 or the M-Audio MicroTrack.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which one of these can be bought for less than $100?

You&apos;ve just signalled that you don&apos;t<br/>&gt;care about the quality of the recording, and might as well take a<br/>&gt;cassette recorder!</p><p>Nope -- internal mics can be near optimal for live acoustic music.<br/>In fact, the cheap pinhole electret condensers in many old cassette<br/>recorders can outperform mics costing hundreds of dollars for what I<br/>want to do.  And of course, cassette has lots of problems (poor<br/>S/N ratio, pre-echo, wow and flutter, and poor media halflife) that<br/>24-bit solid-state digital doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t quite see the point of good specs, quality a/d and d/a<br/>&gt;conversion if you just end up using a mic built into the body of<br/>&gt;the unit.</p><p>I don&apos;t get the point of external mics and a handheld-size recorder.<br/>As long as I&apos;m carying a pair of mics and stands (and expensive and<br/>unweildy TRS-&gt;XLR converters), I might as well carry my laptop and<br/>audio interface (where the phantom power will far surpass that of<br/>the MicroTrack).</p><p>This is all based on recording acoustic music... still, a band with<br/>a board might as well tote a laptop, and save $500 (since you already<br/>own the laptop).

You couldn&apos;t tell the difference<br/>&gt;&gt;between them and AKG-414s (the old, German-made ones, to boot) in say,<br/>&gt;&gt;a chamber music performance in a normal auditorium.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now that, my dear friend, is a claim that just cries out for the very<br/>&gt;comparison you point out! But if it is simply _close_ to that quality,<br/>&gt;then they must do pretty well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Cheers,<br/>&gt;Jon</p><p>The thing is, most of the mic stuff is snake oil.  Large-capsule<br/>condensers like the 414 are known for their pleasant distortion.  They<br/>may make a mediocre vocalist sound warmer (largely just the bass boost<br/>side effect of the cardioid pattern) or more &quot;present&quot; (largely just<br/>a bit of mid-high freq boost with &gt;12K rolled off) but neither of<br/>these things are relevant in an instrumental rehearsal or street<br/>performance situation.  The biggest thing external mics will get you<br/>is more choices for mic placement, background noise suppression, etc.<br/>For micing my piano, the R-1 is near optimal.  For recording a classical<br/>concert in a church, unless you can afford Earthworks or Schoeps<br/>spaced omnis, the R-1&apos;s microphones will satisfy.  The far bigger<br/>problem with the R-1 as far as producing release-ready recordings is<br/>getting the levels right.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10205 href="#10205">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2005 11:03:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;***Oh...
