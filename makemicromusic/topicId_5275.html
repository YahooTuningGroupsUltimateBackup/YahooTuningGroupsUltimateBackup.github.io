The interface is some sort of Max-ish<br/>patchbay. It recognizes my Tascam US-428 as &quot;in&quot; and Built-in audio controller as<br/>&quot;out&quot; -- &quot;Mixer&quot; is automatically linked to the built-in audio controller. I can drag and<br/>drop CronoX to the workspace and open it there but no sound comes out of it. As I<br/>understand it, the Tascam should be linked to CronoX and CronoX should be linked<br/>to the Mixer, which goes to audio out. Even when I do this, no sound comes out. I&apos;m<br/>probably just not understanding the interface, but that&apos;s how far I&apos;ve gotten. -Justin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

But if your intial purpose is to listen to tunings, and to play them for others, I am sure you can find a couple of patches/timbres that would work. It may take some time. Do keep in mind that you are delving in an area of music-making that is so far into being a niche that it probably redefines the term niche.</p><p>That, in a couple of days, you now have a system working that will play (probably) any tuning you might end up throwing at it is, well, pretty remarkable.

CronoX only looks at the *exact* tuning section. You can even delete the 1-<br/>&gt;cent tuning section entirely and CronoX still plays the scale, so it&apos;s obviously looking &gt;at the fine resolution. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s actually playing back scales accurate to 6 &gt;decimal point (we&apos;ll need Kraig Grady&apos;s ears to find that out), but if it IS, that&apos;s fine &gt;enough resolution to please the purest of the purists. &gt;  &gt;<br/>Your own ears will do fine.
