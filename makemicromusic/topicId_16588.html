I know they are on line and I know<br/>they have microtonal experiences to share.</p><p>How about me? Years ago Paul (who is now not with us. he&apos;s not dead, he&apos;s just now not with us.)<br/>asked me to share what I leaned about open tunings on the guitar. I wasn&apos;t ready because I felt<br/>that I was still exploring and wanted to use my findings in my own music.</p><p>I am now ready to share.</p><p>Use notes other than 5/4 and 3/2.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
