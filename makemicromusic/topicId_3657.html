The ideal scenario is that you have<br/>&gt;&gt; created multiple partitions and you have one partitions ONLY<br/>&gt;&gt; FOR AUDIO FILES. Actully, if you do this you don&apos;t need to do<br/>&gt;&gt; the defrag. Just backup your audio files for each song and<br/>&gt;&gt; keep that partition fresh. Having a smaller partition will<br/>&gt;&gt; also seriously reduce your seek time on the disk which is a<br/>&gt;&gt; big help for audio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do you partition a drive on a Mac?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clueless in Cambridge<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dear Clueless,</p><p>Jeff&apos;s right, partitioning your drive WILL ERASE EVERYTHING ON IT ! What kind of Mac do you have ? I&apos;ve got G3 233MHz Desktop. I used to run OS 8.1, now it&apos;s 9.2.1 &amp; 10.1.4 (upgrading to 9.2.2 &amp; 10.1.5 tomorrow). In any case partitioning is dead easy, and I&apos;ve always had my drive partitioned - it&apos;s a potentially good thing to do. To this day I have never seen anything that is easier to do in Windows than on a Mac, even now with the Unix OS X !</p><p>In OS X use Disk Utility. See the help which is pretty simple :<br/>Partitioning a hard disk divides it into sections, each of which works like a separate disk. You can set access privileges to partitions to prevent modification of data. You can also install a different version of the Mac OS on different partitions. Open Disk Utility, click Partition, and select the disk to partition. Choose partition settings, then click OK.<br/>WARNING: Partitioning a disk erases the existing information on it.</p><p>In OS 9 use Drive Setup, and see the Drive Setup help.</p><p>Repartitioning without erasing your drive is very risky and is only possible using 3rd party utilities. It is NOT recommended ! In fact I&apos;ll be repartitioning my 4 GB drive this weekend from 2+1+1 to 2.4+.8+.8.</p><p>I know I&apos;m a bit late responding to this and it looks like Jeff&apos;s helping you sort things out. Good luck, Stan !</p><p>- Joel</p></div>
