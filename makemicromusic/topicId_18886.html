Your<br/>posts are unresponsive. I and most people are unwilling to spend time<br/>on your ideas unless you give us a head start in trying to understand<br/>what you are trying to do. You refuse to do this. I came into this<br/>thread late and missed your &quot;data&quot;. All you have posted since I picked<br/>up the thread is vague and unsubstantiated boasts and assertions about<br/>how wonderful you believe your work is. For all I know it is the best<br/>thing since chunk style peanut butter but your conversational style is<br/>not helpful.</p><p>To be blunt your rhetoric and logic are deficient and your tone is<br/>unpleasant for innocent bystanders to listen to. I generally don&apos;t<br/>like getting personal but you are presenting a great imitation of what<br/>I would term a &quot;blow hard.&quot; Your posts appear to have lots of hot air<br/>and no substance. They are aggressive, harsh and accusatory and depend<br/>on classic rhetorical fallacies. Your post I quote below is a typical<br/>example of your recent posts. It is also a wonderful example of<br/>several logical fallacies that I might present to a class in reasoning<br/>and rhetoric. Rather than defend your thesis (whatever it is) you<br/>attack the character, judgement  and skill of the people who disagree<br/>with you. You ignore their arguments, which to the rest of us appear<br/>quite valid on the face of it. This method of argument has a name. It<br/>is called an &quot;ad hominum&quot; attack. Don&apos;t believe me. Look it up. Google<br/>has gazllions of references. It is one of the classic logical<br/>fallacies.</p><p>The fact that you have no supporters should give you a hint. If there<br/>were any merits to your arguments (assuming you ever made any actual<br/>arguments) people would be piping up and defending you. I read that<br/>silence as indicating that the 400 you mention are basically happy<br/>with the conclusions stated by people like Carl and have better things<br/>to do with their life than argue with an ...</p><p>The only solution to a blow hard is to ignore them until they give up<br/>and go away. Now that I have violated that strategy twice I think I<br/>will stop adding to the futile discussion and go back to lurking.
