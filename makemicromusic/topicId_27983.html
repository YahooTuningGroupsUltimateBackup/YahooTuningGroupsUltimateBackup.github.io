I really like the sound of it on your canon recording, which surprises me because my experience of contact transducers is that they usually sound truly awful to me. Bridge piezo pickups on acoustic guitars often sound truly awful to me too, though this may be just the cheaper pickups, or pickups without good preamplification.</p><p>Maybe I should try the one you have linked to.
