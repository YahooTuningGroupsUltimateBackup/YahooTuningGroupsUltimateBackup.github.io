They were composed back in the 1980&apos;s, when all I had was an XT (pre Pentium) computer, a Yamaha TX81Z, a Quadraverb, and a program called Personal Composer (which I believe now only exists as a notation program and is no longer a sequencer program). All of those pieces still exist in their original form on 3.5&quot; floppy disks. You would think that with all of the equipment I have now, it would be easier to compose microtonal pieces, but unfortunately that has not been the case. I just hope someone will get some enjoyment out of this piece.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow, I have your mircos 1-6 here from 2004 (except I suspect that&apos;s<br/>&gt; when I moved them over from another hard drive and that they were<br/>&gt; actually earlier... true?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can&apos;t wait to listen.
