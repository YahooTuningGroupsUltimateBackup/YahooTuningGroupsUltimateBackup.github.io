Yup it sure seems that way, doesn&apos;t it?  Having been in this<br/>software business from the inside for over 20 years, my experience is this:<br/>Yeah, they want to keep selling you something so they can survive; and a lot<br/>of times, the engineers think they&apos;re working on a cool product and they<br/>would rather put all the features in right away.  Yes, the first version<br/>doesn&apos;t have features that are sometimes planned for later versions.  But the<br/>_reason_ all the features don&apos;t get into the first version is not typically<br/>willful on their part, it&apos;s an emergent phenomenon.  Software engineering on<br/>a large scale is _so_ labor intensive and _so_ prone to bugs and scheduling<br/>problems, that it&apos;s just IMPOSSIBILE to engineer a major product that has all<br/>of those features the first time around, and get it to market before going<br/>belly up.  So there&apos;s this Big Dance of Compromise between the engineers, the<br/>engineering managers, and the marketing people.  _That_ is why your<br/>statement above is true.  You can see that I&apos;m right by looking at open<br/>software and freeware projects.  Take Scala for example.  It keeps evolving,<br/>but Manuel Op de Coul isn&apos;t making money off it; it evolves because his<br/>thinking evolves, and he has finite time in which to engineer the product; at<br/>some point, he puts out a version, but he&apos;s certainly got new ideas for the<br/>next version.  I used to work on teams doing major operating systems, and<br/>in-house we were always running on software that was at least a year ahead of<br/>what was selling on the streets.  By the time _anything_ hits the streets,<br/>it&apos;s been obsolete in the lab for over a year.</p><p>&gt; Lately i have noticed quite a few bands (smaller/unknown) playing<br/>&gt; with very unsteady rhythms and playing parts and lines that resemble<br/>&gt; weaving more than being strict pulse oriented.
