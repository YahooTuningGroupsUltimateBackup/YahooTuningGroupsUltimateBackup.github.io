This particular one is the demonstration disc from the Columbia &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot; featuring the instruments of Partch, along with some of his monologues.</p><p>However, he is unaware (but I&apos;ll let him know) that this material is now included on the recent DVD release from Innova/Philip Blackburn, entitled &quot;Enclosure 7&quot;. In addition to the film of Delusion, the documentary &quot;The Dreamer That Remains&quot;, and some other assorted tidbits, Philip put together a slide-show version of this disc, with newly-remastered audio that I sent him from the master tapes of the commentaries. He included many more photos of the instruments than were in the original booklet.</p><p>Anyone interested in E7, or any of the other amazing Partch series he produced, can see those at:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydadwr">http://tinyurl.com/ydadwr</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=14938 href="#14938">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2006 1:28:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;However, he is unaware (but I&apos;ll let him know) that this material is<br/>&gt;now included on the recent DVD release from Innova/Philip Blackburn,<br/>&gt;entitled &quot;Enclosure 7&quot;.</p><p>I thought so (I haven&apos;t had time to play that DVD yet).
