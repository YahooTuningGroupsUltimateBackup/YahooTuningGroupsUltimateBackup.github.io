For example, I designed a custom<br/>CSound instrument that uses noise modulation of oscillators to add<br/>expressive realism and warmth (most acoustic instuments have a good<br/>deal of randomness in their core) in a way that most pre-packaged<br/>synthesizers, virtual or otherwise, would not generally allow. That<br/>being said, sometimes CSound is used when it is not really<br/>necessary, too.</p><p>With CSound, there are no architectural limitations, just the limits<br/>of your imagination. Another advantage is that you don&apos;t have to<br/>worry about the limits of MIDI or polyphony with CSound, at least if<br/>you are not doing realtime MIDI performance with it.</p><p>I also think that sometimes, it&apos;s a good thing to slow down and<br/>think hard about and do work on your sounds in a very meticulous and<br/>polished way. Think of it as like being Stradivarius trying to<br/>perfect the sound of a violin! Often the cheap results we hear<br/>nowadays come from the instant gratification we have from<br/>pre-packaged and loop and preset driven mentality--originality goes<br/>out the window, out of sheer laziness.</p><p>Yes, these things are *hard*. Writing great music is *hard*.<br/>Beethoven&apos;s symphonies were not farted out, and Rome wasn&apos;t built in<br/>a day. I think the best work is that which is born in lots of blood<br/>sweat and tears---and there is something to old fashioned, pre-MIDI<br/>difficulty, for instance the way Wendy Carlos or Easley Blackwood<br/>had to laboriously overtrack to make their microtonal stuff, that<br/>adds expressive character and humanity that no easy solution<br/>approach could give; a lot of that is due to the presence of<br/>*inaccuracies* of timing, etc.</p><p>I hold up as an example of the excellent potentials of CSound Prent<br/>Rodgers&apos; music, BTW. His is a sample-based approach, and his tools<br/>are completely custom, as is his sound. I respect this<br/>&apos;custom-based&apos; and pioneering attitude more than any other,<br/>personally.</p><p>That said, I certainly know what you mean otherwise!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Hudson Lacerda<br/>&lt;hfmlacerda@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I just uploaded the latest microabc:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The music can be written like this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; X:1<br/>&gt; &gt; %%MIDI program 21<br/>&gt; &gt; Q:1/4=126<br/>&gt; &gt; K:C<br/>&gt; &gt; [C][D][E\][F^] [G][Bbt][D1][E\1] | [C1][Bbt][G][F^] [G]4 |<br/>&gt; &gt; [C][D][E\][F^] [G][Bbt][A\][G] | [C1][Bbt][D][E\] [C]4 |<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some testing options could be:<br/>&gt; &gt; - JI with pithbends in cents (denominator 100):<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -i- -pinput.abp den:100 &gt; <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; abc2midi <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; - 12-ET with pitchbend in cents, quantized:<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -i- -pinput.abp equaltemp:12 den:100 &gt; <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; abc2midi <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; - 12-ET with pitchbend in cents:<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -i- -pinput.abp equaltemp:12 den:100 &gt; <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; abc2midi <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; - Score (-P):<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -i- -Pinput.abp &gt; <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; abcm2ps <a href="http://output.abc">output.abc</a><br/>&gt; &gt; See also inside examples/sagittal folder.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Software you probably will need:<br/>&gt; &gt; - abcpp-1.3.2 (or newer)<br/>&gt; &gt; - abcm2ps-4.3.2 (or newer)<br/>&gt; &gt; - abcMIDI-2006-01-31 (or newer)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; #define MAX_MACROS 512 /* # of #defined macros */<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -iinputfile -ooutputfile<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -iinputfile -pabpfile -oabcfile4midi<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc -iinputfile -Pabpfile -oabcfile4ps<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc centre:62 &lt; inputfile &gt; outputfile<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc range:-6\ 6 -iinputfile -ooutputfile<br/>&gt; &gt; microabc name:_ABCM2PS_ abcm2ps:4 -iinputfile -ooutputfile<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Command line options override the corresponding values got from<br/>&gt; &gt; inputfile.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; == SAGITTAL PITCHES ==<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [C] [A] [Ev] [B^]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F] [G]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [A/||\] [A#] [#A] [/||\A] [A#\] [\#A]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; NOTE: Mixed things like [#\A] or [A\#] may work, by they are not<br/>&gt; &gt; recommended.

If not, could someone then explain to me how<br/>this<br/>&gt; program -- or any such program using only command-lines -- is an<br/>&gt; advantage to everyday users,  as opposed to programs with a<br/>&gt; user-friendly GUI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me clarify up front that I do NOT want to denigrate the use of<br/>such<br/>&gt; programs, nor the immense thought and effort (not to mention time)<br/>spent<br/>&gt; in creating them. I have no doubt that this is a worthy musical<br/>&gt; software. If a composer is comfortable with this method, more<br/>power to<br/>&gt; them indeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My one and only complaint here is in the counter-intuitive,<br/>&gt; user-unfriendly, excruciatingly painful and tedious means by which<br/>a<br/>&gt; mere handful of notes are produced. If I wish to use this software<br/>-- or<br/>&gt; another similar to it -- I am immediately discouraged from doing<br/>so by<br/>&gt; the nearly vertical learning-curve. Frankly, as my time here in<br/>your<br/>&gt; world is limited, I&apos;d rather spend it making music in the most<br/>&gt; expeditious manner possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just recently downloaded Csound, a program that until recently<br/>you<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t have paid me cash to attempt to deal with. I decided to<br/>give it<br/>&gt; a test-run only after Dave&apos;s most recent work was posted...and<br/>then,<br/>&gt; only after discovering that there was at least one GUI (Blue) that<br/>I<br/>&gt; could use with it to reduce command-line excesses to a minimum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I might note here that I foolishly took a peek at the Csound<br/>reference<br/>&gt; manual and as a consequence, lay down on the floor in a fetal<br/>position<br/>&gt; for several hours. I was later roused out of this state by the<br/>gentle<br/>&gt; application of kicks by my wife.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve had this discussion before. But I have to say again that the<br/>&gt; nearly infinite capabilities of such programs (also their<br/>availability<br/>&gt; as freeware) don&apos;t at all compensate for the equally near-infinite<br/>&gt; trouble it takes to use them.  For those who enjoy working with<br/>the<br/>&gt; left-brain, linear aspects of command-line interfaces it&apos;s no<br/>&gt; problem.....which of course, leaves the rest of us (especially<br/>&gt; beginners) entirely out in the cold. Deliberate discrimination?<br/>Hope<br/>&gt; not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suppose a poet wanted to compose a sonnet to be read by another<br/>poet to<br/>&gt; an audience. He sits down to pencil and paper -- only to discover<br/>that<br/>&gt; he must first compose his sonnet in Sumerian cuneiform, then hand<br/>it to<br/>&gt; a translator, who renders it to English then gives it to the<br/>reading<br/>&gt; poet. The first poet won&apos;t know if his Sumerian cuneiform renders<br/>to<br/>&gt; English accurately, until this cumbersome process is finished. If<br/>he<br/>&gt; needs to alter a word or phrase, he cannot simply erase....he must<br/>again<br/>&gt; use Sumerian cuneiform and repeat until satisfied. Hardly an<br/>elegant<br/>&gt; solution to writing a sonnet. That&apos;s not to say that good poetry<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t be written thus; but how many poets do you think would<br/>rather<br/>&gt; just do it themselves with pencil and paper?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of the ingenuity that goes into creating these wonderful<br/>programs<br/>&gt; could surely be directed towards creating a user-friendly GUI to<br/>easily<br/>&gt; access them, yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; NOTE: If the this program does indeed have a user-friendly GUI, I<br/>hereby<br/>&gt; apologize for the above rant and make use of the following quote<br/>--<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Never mind.&quot;  -- Ms. Emily Latella<br/>&gt;</p></div>
