I have a little folder in the photos section with some of my<br/>instruments, and a photo of my home studio. It would be cool to see<br/>photos of some of yours (instruments, that is) or photos of your home<br/>studios, or some such, just as a &quot;get to know the community&quot; kinda<br/>thang.</p><p>Also, I have a folder called scores in the files section, in which I<br/>have placed three pages of a humorous score as a beginning. It would<br/>be interesting to see some scores from those of you who actually write<br/>stuff down.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
