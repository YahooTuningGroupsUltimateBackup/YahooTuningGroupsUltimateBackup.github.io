I&apos;m on the verge of buying Kontakt II sampling software. I did a<br/>search through the messages on this list to educate myself as to its tunability. What I<br/>found was a little over my head - seems it can be made microtonal is some kind of script<br/>is added, and I don&apos;t know what that entails. Can someone tell me in pretty simple English<br/>whether that software is conducive to tuning each key microtonally (I generally use 30 or<br/>more pitches to the 8ve), and whether, as a novice, I&apos;d be able to make it work that way?</p><p>Thanks for your time and help,</p><p>Kyle</p></div>
