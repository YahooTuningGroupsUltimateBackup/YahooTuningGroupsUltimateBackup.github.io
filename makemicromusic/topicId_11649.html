(structural forms in example)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  with bottom up the composer would start with a germ of an idea ( such<br/>&gt; as a motif)  that would grow like a seed into the full composition.<br/>&gt; The latter i have never been able to do, as far as starting at the<br/>&gt; beginning and going all the way through, unless i already have some idea<br/>&gt; of where i am going.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick McGowan wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;This brings up a question i have about composers in general, do they all<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;work from top down ideas are are they composers who work from bottom up<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;constructions.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t know how to interpret &quot;bottom-up&quot; and &quot;top-down&quot; in this context.<br/>&gt; &gt;What do you mean?</p><p>Probably mostly &quot;bottom-up&quot;, altho I may still have a<br/>good &quot;top-down&quot; idea of the sound or general structure<br/>I want when I start.  This is the SABEAMITM (Start<br/>At Both Ends And Meet In The Middle) method! :-)<br/>I write poetry the same way.</p><p>I usually start with some sounds - it could be a theme<br/>that I hear in my head and demands to be played, or<br/>it could be a cluster of notes that happen when I throw<br/>my fingers down sort-of-randomly on the keyboard,<br/>guitar or simple wind instrument (vertical flute, whistle<br/>or recorder).  Often, too, when I&apos;m walking somewhere,<br/>the rhythm suggests some rhythmic motif which then<br/>gains a tune as I go; the tune may pick up on coincidental<br/>sounds like a car horn, a siren or a bird song - no, I don&apos;t<br/>mean I&apos;ve ever heard a &quot;siren song&quot; - yet!</p><p>Once I&apos;ve got such material (and I discard most of it<br/>because I simply don&apos;t have time to get them all down<br/>before the next one pops up), it&apos;s a pretty straight-<br/>forward process to elaborate it into something bigger.<br/>To do so, I use classic contrapuntal techniques, harmonic<br/>blocking, textural and range changes, and sometimes a<br/>bit of &quot;cut-up&quot; &iuml;&iquest;&half; la William Burroughs.  Also, the phrases<br/>of any theme used long enough build up their own metres,<br/>and as in any conversation, phrases call for answers, so<br/>I often create a counter-theme that deliberately<br/>contrasts with the original, expand that a little, and then<br/>combine the two.  Sometimes, too, I set out on a process<br/>of systematic variation, both of melodic twists on a short<br/>motif and of rhythmic grouping, for example by shifting<br/>the start position of a triplet group within the metre,<br/>which, when combined with counterpoint, gives some very<br/>unusual cross-rhythms.  Oh yes, sometimes, I set my own<br/>poetry to music; at other times, my music suggests words.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s my process; how successful it is may be<br/>difficult for you to judge, since I don&apos;t have any of this<br/>stuff published anywhere, tho there&apos;s plenty of it.  For<br/>example, my WIP (work in progress) folder for 2005 has<br/>95 files.  Most of these are still a little raw; some are<br/>only quick sketches that need fleshing out; but a dozen<br/>or so are, I believe, playable or singable or both.  I call a<br/>piece &quot;finished&quot; when I can enjoy how it sounds as a MIDI<br/>file realised on the Roland E-28 keyboard, or as the file<br/>in NoteWorthy Composer format (.nwc) from which such<br/>a MIDI file can be written.  I rarely convert the NWC or<br/>MIDI file to an audio file, tho, for two reasons - one is<br/>that I keep forgetting how (and it changes with what<br/>audio software I&apos;m using), and the other is that I&apos;m sure<br/>these pieces would mostly sound better if they were<br/>played on acoustic instruments.  The least satisfactory<br/>aspect of the MIDI realisations for me is the lack of<br/>variety and control of the singing voices.  If you do want<br/>to have a notion of the music I make, there&apos;s a plug-in<br/>for WinAmp that is a NoteWorthy Player (it plays .nwc<br/>files).  The .nwc files are small, so I could throw a few of<br/>them into the MMM files area if anyone wants to listen.</p><p>But do remember that the sounds you get will be those<br/>of your own MIDI implementation!  I&apos;ve noticed that<br/>different kit sometimes gives an entirely different<br/>balance between instrumental parts, which can make<br/>something that&apos;s fine in one place sound very out of<br/>whack elsewhere.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.9/217 - Release Date: 30/12/05</p></div>
