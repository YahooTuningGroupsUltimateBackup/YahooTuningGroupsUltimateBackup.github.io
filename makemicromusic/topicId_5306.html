This is why a lot of the sequencers have the option to &apos;export&apos; the file, whereby it is rendered in non-realtime and is not CPU dependent in a temporal fashion. This is also an area where it is a good feature if the softsynths have, essentially, &apos;draft&apos; and &apos;final&apos; modes of playback, where they can turn off some features or sound rendering during intial work so you get an idea of the piece, and then you turn up the rendering quality when doing the final mixes.</p><p>Just curious.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
