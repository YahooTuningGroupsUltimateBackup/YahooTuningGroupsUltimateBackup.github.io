These are Timidity++ renditions from a Scala file using a sound<br/>font called Personal Copy 5.1, if I&apos;m correct.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sure you didn&apos;t see my penultimate post yet, but the advice<br/>&gt; about legato-staccato is relevant here. You should also rest between<br/>&gt; each phrase--remove some tone sustain and add an equivalent length<br/>&gt; of silence, ca. eighth or quarter rest for each if the music was in<br/>&gt; 4-4.</p><p>Yes, if I&apos;m going to use algorithmic coding in Scala, there&apos;s no rule that<br/>prevents me from coding creatively and borrowing part of a note value for<br/>a timely pause -- as if there were a comma above the note to indicate a<br/>phrase breath mark.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll venture some guesses about the tuning. I think the major 3rds<br/>&gt; vary in width according to their proximity to home key, and I also<br/>&gt; think you&apos;re stretching the major 6ths when they resolve to octaves.<br/>&gt; Am I right?</p><p>Actually, it&apos;s possible there might be a few small and incidental<br/>variations for reasons I&apos;ll explain, but generally this should be in<br/>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive 5-limit JI system: two 1/4-comma meantone chains at<br/>1/4-comma apart, producing pure vertical sonorities. The exception might<br/>be that where a note is sustained, I might have permitted a few tempered<br/>meantone vertical intervals and sonorities rather than shifting a<br/>quarter-comma in mid-note -- although that might be quite acceptable since<br/>the shift is so small. (This isn&apos;t to rule out deliberate comma shifts,<br/>for example by a 64:63 or the equivalent as a common one I sometimes use<br/>in a neo-medieval setting, only to say that in a Renaissance kind of<br/>style, I tend to prefer a smoother and more &quot;seamless&quot; voice-leading.)</p><p>Stretching sixths before octaves is something that I&apos;d consider a<br/>14th-century kind of procedure, and I&apos;ll be doing it in some pieces in<br/>that kind of style. However, for 16th-century, I tend generally to prefer<br/>a different kind of &quot;xenharmonic&quot; effect used by Vicentino to get<br/>narrower cadential semitones while keeping 5-limit sonorities (or their<br/>meantone approximations). This is something I should post soon: best first<br/>heard, then discussed. However, Fabio Colonna in 1618 _does_ give an<br/>example which could be placed in a category of this kind: a meantone<br/>diminished seventh (around 12:7) used in a major sixth to octave kind of<br/>progression. That I should post soon too -- maybe as part of a composition<br/>(a neat commission, thank you!).</p><p>Anyway, even if I may have treated some vertical sonorities as meantone<br/>rather than pure 5-limit, the different shouldn&apos;t be more than 5.38 cents<br/>or so (the amount by which the meantone minor third is smaller than 6:5,<br/>or the meantone major sixth larger than 5:3). This assumes that I coded<br/>correctly, and that Scala and Timidity++ produced the right pitch bends.</p><p>&gt; As for Gesualdo--he and his compatriots are of course for the late<br/>&gt; Renaissance parallel to the Ars Subtilior in the late Medieval.</p><p>True: I love pieces by both Gesualdo and Monteverdi around 1600 which mix<br/>dramatic intensity with elements of polyphonic technique.</p><p>&gt; What would be interesting to hear,<br/>&gt; and which undoubtedly occurred in some nearby parallel universe to<br/>&gt; our own ;)</p><p>Sometimes I seem to be residing in such a place...</p><p>&gt; is a composer using Gesualdo-ish/Vicentino-ish chromatic harmony<br/>&gt; (maybe the 24 of 31-tone 1/4 comma meantone like Vicentino), but<br/>&gt; with the rhythmic subtleties of the Ars Subtilior.</p><p>That _is_ an interesting scenario, and why not?</p><p>&gt; Have you found this artist in your historical research ;) ?  If not,<br/>&gt; have you checked with Bill Sethares and other knowledgeable<br/>&gt; exomusicologists?</p><p>Without attempting to guess what Bill might say, I could quickly comment<br/>that Thomas Morley, for example, has some somewhat &quot;Ars Subtilior&quot; stuff<br/>in his _A Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music_ (1597),<br/>including things like proportions and division of a note into 5 or 7 equal<br/>parts. Combine that with some aspects of the style of Vicentino or<br/>Colonna, and there you have it -- or one approach to what you&apos;ve proposed,<br/>at least.</p><p>&gt; (One hint?: if our culture, with its 5-fingered hands, adopted a 12-<br/>&gt; tone per octave system, perhaps we must look to planets on which<br/>&gt; humanoids or other intelligent life has 10-fingered hands or<br/>&gt; equivalents thereof to have adopted a 24-tone system.)</p><p>Well, I have ten fingers on two hands, and tend often toward 24-note<br/>systems (just or tempered) -- but someone with ten fingers on _each_ hand<br/>might play in them more fluidly. Again, this might be an invitation both<br/>for me to record more in these systems, and for you or Bill or others to<br/>design xentonal renditions of what someone with two 10-fingered hands, for<br/>example, might play.</p><p>&gt; Conjecturally yours,<br/>&gt; Harold</p><p>Thank you again both for the feedback and the ideas.</p><p>Kraig:</p><p>&gt; that has to be the happiest Don Carlo i have heard.

If we take the example of Rhythm, in ethnomusicology they have a machine that can decipher rhythm extremely accurately and it rightfully points out that the beats very greatly.
