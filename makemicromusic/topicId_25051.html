Actually<br/>I&apos;d argue with Carl here...that rock was, indeed, developed from blues and not<br/>R&amp;B.  I don&apos;t know any major famous guitarist (Satriani, Van Halen, Steve Vai,<br/>Slash...) who hasn&apos;t done a nod to blues, either in bios or cover songs, at<br/>least a few times in his/her career...likely because they also &apos;know&apos; their<br/>chosen art of rock was born of blues.</p><p>.  Though even then, it seems, Santana was not creating straight &quot;Mississippi<br/>Delta&quot; blues...the article says &quot;In the early years the Santana Blues Band<br/>created a unique sound by  blending rock, blues and jazz with salsa, Latin<br/>percussion (congas and  timbales), and Santana&apos;s melodic, bluesy guitar solos&quot;.<br/>Again it seems to say he was influenced by blues more than that he was blues.<br/>Even when he plays with John Lee Hooker...he sounds about 70% Latin Rock and<br/>about 30% blues.</p><p>    However...I&apos;d believe he was in fact a straight blues player in the very<br/>early days of his career...</p><p>&gt;&quot;There&apos;s a CD somewhere, don&apos;t recall the name, where Santana is playing<br/>&gt;straight blues at Winterland, think it&apos;s 1968...very impressive stuff&quot;</p><p>     Well, if you can recall, I&apos;d love to hear it.  The earliest Santana album<br/>I&apos;ve heard is mid-70&apos;s, haven&apos;t heard what he did in 1968.  In fact, if you can<br/>manage to share with us on the list a few links to a good few songs he wrote<br/>that were, in fact, in straight blues.  I&apos;m still more convinced he is yet<br/>another great guitarist heavily inspired by blues who grew more toward other<br/>influences over time but, as with Slash, the way he solos, no matter what genre<br/>it were over, makes the blues influence obvious.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:makemicromusic@yahoogroups.com">makemicromusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Fri, January 28, 2011 12:57:07 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Santana/blues</p><p>Hey Michael...not messing with you, your comments are in good faith<br/>but...Santana indeed is a great blues player; in fact he started as the Santana<br/>Blues Band before he made it with the more Latino stuff...he was greatly<br/>influenced by Mike Bloomfield in his early years.
