But, I didn&apos;t hear much in the way of good songwriting to support all of those notes (and there were a few exceptions).<br/>In fact, the guitar, overall, has turned into sort of a &quot;macho&quot; axe, with fast and technically complex playing substituting for any sort of compositional depth or expression.. .and it bores the hell out of me.</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/">myspace.com/</a> microstick <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a> <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
