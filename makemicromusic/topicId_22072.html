My take is...different instruments for different concepts, so one size may not be best for every situation. Fretless is really easy to get around on, for example, but...when I retune it to Harmonic Series notes, you gotta relearn where to put your fingers, which not everybody wants to do. I enjoy learning different systems anyway, and wish I had many more guitars...best...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>The New Busy is not the old busy.
