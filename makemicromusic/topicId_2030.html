Sounds great!</p><p>I&apos;ve got more terminology now.  It&apos;s what&apos;s called a &quot;goblet drum&quot;.  I<br/>don&apos;t know much more than that.  I got it from a third world craft shop,<br/>and it didn&apos;t even have a label.  It&apos;s a wooden frame with what must be an<br/>animal skin.</p><p>&gt; And on that Pelog tuning - would you care to show the cents values on<br/>&gt; that one? That was a happening melody.</p><p>Oh, yes.  I mention it at &lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/7-plus3.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/7-plus3.htm</a>&gt;.  It<br/>could be the white notes of</p><p>C      0<br/>Db   150<br/>D    200<br/>E    350<br/>F    500<br/>Gb   650<br/>G    700<br/>A    850<br/>Bb  1000<br/>B   1050<br/>C   1200</p><p>without C and F.  But it&apos;s probably tuned more like 31-equal because I<br/>recorded it with MIDI Relay.  The piece is heavily derivative of a track<br/>I&apos;ve got on a CD of flute and gamelan music of west Java.  I can give you<br/>the catalog number if you want to check how unoriginal it is.  I wasn&apos;t<br/>actively looking for that sound, but I found by noodling with the neutral<br/>third scales that one of the pentatonics came out sounding remarkably<br/>similar.  It was very easy to get an example together by playing it with a<br/>flute timbre, like on the CD.</p><p>&gt; I want to get a Dumbek and a Djembe too. Remo makes some good Fiber-<br/>&gt; Skin 3 drums that stay in tune even in the most humid conditions.<br/>&gt; Never thought I&apos;d like the Fiber-Skin 3 until I got both a Riq and a<br/>&gt; Tar. My two Bodhrans are goat-skin (bless the goats that now give me<br/>&gt; such musical pleasures), but they are very sensitive to humidity -<br/>&gt; which here in NC can swing wildly up and down in the space of days.<br/>&gt; The Bodhrans have an exquisite sound when the climate is dry. They<br/>&gt; are made by Cooperman - one of the finest makers of this kind of<br/>&gt; drum. The 18&quot; has a lovley inharmonic timbre which can sound a little<br/>&gt; gongish if struck in the right place, and the 24&quot; has this huge noble<br/>&gt; sound in its bass, and a rim tone to die for. I love drumming. I<br/>&gt; carry a 14&quot; Tar with me everywhere, and play everyday that weather<br/>&gt; will allow in the lovely parks near where I work.</p><p>Oh, they&apos;re supposed to stay in tune are they?  I think mine&apos;ll be<br/>particularly sensitive, and perhaps it does sound best in a dry<br/>atmosphere.  Ultimately, I&apos;ll control this by using samples, but that<br/>means all the work of isolating them again without background noise,<br/>building them into a patch, and even recording more of them.</p><p>You have to be careful about the ways you obtain pleasure from goats.</p><p>The high pass filter can make a big difference to the sound.  Cutting out<br/>the constant boom is essential for snare-type sounds.  It was difficult to<br/>control that for the recording, because the acoustic bass was getting in<br/>my headphones.  So on previous takes I tended to over-filter it.  Getting<br/>the sound right in general was remarkable difficult.  Obviously, as I<br/>usually play acoustically, that&apos;s the sound I know how to control.  To<br/>capture it electronically requires training in microphone placement I<br/>don&apos;t have and probably different microphones as well.  With samples<br/>that&apos;s not a problem -- they sound great, so who cares if they aren&apos;t what<br/>you get like acoustically?</p><p>I don&apos;t practice drumming anything like daily, any more than keyboards or<br/>guitar.  But it is fun.  And a good way of learning rhythm.  I might make<br/>a systematic effort to learn Beefheart patterns.</p><p>Oh yes, and about the parks.  A couple of weekends ago, I decided to walk<br/>to Yatton, because I haven&apos;t been there much and I thought there might be<br/>something interesting.  Sure enough, when I stopped and decided it was<br/>time I headed back I saw a footpath to a place called Cadbury Hill I<br/>think.  It was an Iron Age fort and some kind of settlement in the Dark<br/>Ages.  I had no idea there was such a place so close to home.  It has<br/>quite an atmosphere, and was fairly quiet.  A few archaeologists, some<br/>dogs, other people who found their way up.  It&apos;s big enough and has enough<br/>trees that you could find an out of the way spot and have an acoustic jam<br/>session.  Drums and flutes, record it onto DAT, if I knew people who&apos;d do<br/>such things.  One day I might bring my drum there (get the bus this time,<br/>it is a long walk) and get some open-air practice.  I suppose it&apos;ll get<br/>busier in the summer, coincident with the mud drying up.</p><p>By the time I got home the mood had completely passed, as well as me being<br/>tired and hungry, so I didn&apos;t get anything recorded that day.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
