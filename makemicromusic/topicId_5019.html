There is a lot in a name.</p><p>I wonder what a good word for it might be...</p><p>Some of your transformations would be genuinely zenharmonic<br/>- I&apos;m thinking of your transformations that I now include in FTS<br/>- the ones that change five limit chords to e.g. seven limit<br/>ones in such a way that the melody line remains intact and the<br/>harmonies still function - but in new transformed ways.<br/>I think those would be counted as xenharmonic.</p><p>Also some twelve tone inspired music could be xenharmonic if it<br/>explores diesis shifts or such like new ideas like some<br/>of Margo&apos;s pieces. But I think they would probably need<br/>to be composed especially, not sure you could take<br/>a piece composed for a twelve tone system and<br/>retune it in another tuning and call it xenharmonic<br/>- unless somehow transformed so that the way it functions<br/>is completely different and no longer based<br/>on twelve tone harmonies. I mean - if it works because<br/>when you listen to it then you hear the original piece<br/>still coming through and somehow working much as it did originally<br/>as in your seven equal tuning of Bach,<br/>then I think it is microtonal, and strange, and it is well<br/>possible that one could get xenharmonic ideas as a result<br/>of listening to it, but not yet really xenharmonic.<br/>It isn&apos;t yet starting afresh from a new origin<br/>which I suppose is what I think of xenharmony as boing<br/>about.</p><p>Of course it is microtonal - as the more general word.</p><p>Just feel one shouldn&apos;t confuse people - many will be entirely<br/>new to the word xenharmonic (it is fairly new to me)<br/>and a shame to let them go away<br/>with an idea of what it means which could delay their<br/>understanding of what it is about.</p><p>Well just my two cents as they say... And I&apos;m quite new<br/>to this field, so it&apos;s quite possible I haven&apos;t quite got<br/>the right idea about what xenharmony is about either,</p><p>If the focus is to be on retuned twelve tone pieces I&apos;d have thought<br/>it might be worth considering a new domain name for it, and to<br/>reserve this one for the more truly xenharmonic music which<br/>you compose.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2003 4:01:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just to say I agree with Jeff&apos;s comment.

It seems to me you and Scott have simply gotten<br/>&gt; the wrong idea somewhere.</p><p>xenharmonic</p><p>&gt; a term coined by Ivor Darreg from the Greek words for &quot;strange<br/>&gt; music&quot;. Darreg used it to refer to any non-12-EQ (microtonal) scales,<br/>&gt; which presented strange and wonderful new intervals and sonic worlds<br/>&gt; to explore.</p><p>Thanks Gene. Yes, that must be so (in my case anyway). Maybe it was confusion with<br/>xentonality that did it in fact. Sorry.</p><p>I suppose the point here is that the word applies to the scales rather than the<br/>music composed in them - so your site so far presents conventional twelve tone<br/>music in xenharmonic scales. No question about the scales being xenharmonic!<br/>So your domain name is accurate as a description of the scales used.</p><p>But perhaps one could still hesitate about calling music retuned to xenhrmonic scales<br/>as also inevitably xenharmonic. It might be that when used to describe music rather<br/>than scales one would do well to reserve its use to<br/>music actually inspired by the scales... As in Xenharmonic music meaning<br/>music inspired by xenharmonic scales, and maybe we need another word for<br/>music not originally inspired in this fashion but retuned to such scales.<br/>I don&apos;t know, xentransformed music or something...</p><p>Like - retuning music to such a scale presents the strange and wonderful<br/>new intervals and sonic worlds to explore, but doesn&apos;t really explore them<br/>yet, not thoroughly anyway. Like in the case of the seven equal tuning of<br/>Bach obviously it is going to miss out on the particular progressions of chords by<br/>thirds that I was exploring because he wouldn&apos;t have composed in such a<br/>fashion since the original piece wasn&apos;t in seven equal and I don&apos;t think<br/>it would make so much sense in a twelve tone piece. I think if you<br/>took one of my seven tone pieces and transformed it back<br/>to say twelve equal it probably wouldn&apos;t work because I think<br/>they rely on the 11/9 approximation - and they also sometimes<br/>rely on the intervals in the  seven tone scale being equally<br/>spaced in order to work.</p><p>So - will bring out some things and not others and give a few<br/>landmarks probably but maybe not necessarily the ones that one will get<br/>most involved in when one sets down to compose in the tuning.</p><p>I can understand that it may be a good way into xenharmonic<br/>tunings for composers who have a very thorough background in twelve<br/>tone composition and naturally want to apply their training to<br/>their xenharmonic pieces. Eventually they will absorb the idiom<br/>of the tunings they are attracted to and start to produce<br/>mature pieces in it.</p><p>While others seem to like to just dive into a new tuning<br/>straight away and forget any connections it may have with<br/>any other tuning and try to explore it afresh. Then you may<br/>have many falls and stumbles to start with and no pattern<br/>to follow but it is a lot of fun if one is attracted to that<br/>approach. I think this isn&apos;t a matter of experience and<br/>training, rather of temperament.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
