On an instrument that doesn&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; pause for breath. There are things I don&apos;t like about it, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; want to do the work required to analyze it, re-write bits, re-record<br/>&gt; them to sound like the surrounding material and then splice them in. So<br/>&gt; it stays as it is, imperfect but spontaneous.</p><p>Oh yes I understand. You feel that rewriting an improvisation may spoil it mightn&apos;t<br/>it, lose the spontaneity. Maybe it is right too.</p><p>I feel the same and would prefer to start again with a new piece<br/>rather than redo an improvisation. But perhaps that is just a mark of<br/>inexperience. Anyay in the same position I don&apos;t think I&apos;d rewrite it<br/>either, and I find your Pelog improvisation delightful to listen to as it is.</p><p>&gt; What kind of subtle changes do you mean? It&apos;s quite easy to move notes<br/>&gt; around and change their length in the piano roll view, which is how I<br/>&gt; always edit it. But I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d be doing other than<br/>&gt; shortening the occasional note.</p><p>Shortening the occasional note is all one need to do to make a surprising<br/>amount of difference.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I find that work on the phrasing helps the composer to think<br/>&gt; &gt; more about the piece in terms of phrases and answer phrases and so on.<br/>&gt; &gt; So as well as helping the listener, it also improves the composition<br/>&gt; &gt; indirectly.</p><p>&gt; Indeed, &quot;question and answer&quot; is something I often thing of playing<br/>&gt; with, but never do.</p><p>Ah but you do. It is a natural thing, any melody line has<br/>question and answer (or whatever it is you want to call it).</p><p>E.g. in your Pelog piece your first four bars go:</p><p>a b a c</p><p>(a very common type of bars pattern in folk music)</p><p>I don&apos;t mean an exact repeat there, just that the<br/>a bars are smilar in character to each other.</p><p>It then gets answered by another phrase in a similar<br/>a b a c type pattern.</p><p>The a b there itself can be thought of as<br/>a tiny question and answer, ending with an<br/>unresolved answer, then the a c gives  a<br/>more resolved type answer (just a single note<br/>in this case. But not completely resolved or<br/>it would end the tune at that point. That then<br/>leaves it open for another call and answer<br/>type phrase to answer it. The a c also in the<br/>a b a c also answers the a b.</p><p>The whole piece is built up mainly of four bar phrases<br/>themselves building up into eight bar larger<br/>phrases, with a few rhythmic kind of skips now<br/>and again.</p><p>I hear the Pelog piece as full of call and answer<br/>all the way through.</p><p>Bars fall naturally into two bar<br/>patterns (rarely three bar patterns)</p><p>Larger phrases often fall into four bar pattens<br/>built out of two bar phrases kind of question and answer type.</p><p>With your Lyonaisse song I hear the intro a bit like this:</p><p>a ... | b......| b...... | b a.....| a.....</p><p>The b is an elaboration of a I know, but also new in character.<br/>One could hear it various ways I&apos;m sure.</p><p>The | b a....| at the start of the fourth bar there<br/>is the place where you get a bit of a pleasant mild<br/>surprise. So that first b note could be made a bit shorter to<br/>point out the phrasing. Just one of many possiblities I&apos;m sure.</p><p>Now and again a composer will break up the phrasing with a<br/>three bar phrase say. Or may do something exotic like<br/>a seven or five bar phrase. It is suprising what a difference<br/>it makes to have e.g. a seven bar repeating section instead<br/>of an eight bar one.</p><p>However, a listener won&apos;t get bored even if a piece<br/>is entirely four square type 2 bar phrases making up four<br/>bars making up eight bars making up sixteen, all the pairs<br/>answering each other. It can be varied by sometimes starting<br/>phrases on the bar, on the down beat and sometimes on the up beat<br/>and sometimes breaking a bar into smaller sub phrases,<br/>sometimes going over a bar and so on, within the<br/>expected larger beat pattern (which I think is<br/>perhaps a type of natural fractal)..</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m using the term<br/>correctly here, perhaps I may be stretching it beyond<br/>the normal use of the word, in any case that&apos;s what<br/>I had in mind and it is a natural thing you get in<br/>melody. But working on the phrasing of a piece<br/>gets one to notice patterns like that and the<br/>way it is made up of phrases similar and differing<br/>in character and other larger structures. At<br/>least I find that wiht my pieces. Also when playing,<br/>thinking about phrasing gets one to notice larger<br/>structures. So in that way I find it helps with<br/>the composing too, and is more than just a way<br/>to help the listener to hear the details in the<br/>tunes. I think that&apos;s it really - that adding phrases helps<br/>the listener to hear the details - including oneself.<br/>I think that is probably why it seems to help with<br/>the composition process.</p><p>&gt; It does if you do it right. I suppose I do it wrong and then get<br/>&gt; scared, and so go the safe route of having everything playing all the<br/>&gt; time. Thank you for these comments, it gives me an idea of how other<br/>&gt; people are hearing things, and what I need to work on.</p><p>Yes of course, very natural. In the places you use it, to my ears<br/>it is done very effectively, so I think it would work to do more of the same<br/>and to be a bit more adventurous in your use of phrasing.</p><p>After all - like programming, one can always put in a whole bunch<br/>of changes to hear what happens, and if you don&apos;t like it, just roll it<br/>back to the way it was before. I find that useful particularly,<br/>with this sort of thing - phrasing, timing and tempo variation, dynamics etc,<br/>after the main structure of the piece is in place. One feels freeer<br/>to experiment if one makes lots of backups and can roll back to them at<br/>any time.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7820 href="#7820">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

But perhaps that is just a mark of inexperience.</p><p>That is quite often the fact with me! I quickly want to add, however, that if one does more improvising, one can also get more of a feel to just slightly tweak things afterward and still retain the freshness of it. My particular thing is, whether it is my music or doing someone else&apos;s in the studio, I frequently find that my very first (or possibly second) attempt at something is best, even if we keep multiple takes. So I&apos;ve gotten used to making that the very basic material, and just editing a tiny bit if I want to.</p><p>Naturally, if it is all midi then it is a slam dunk; if one is recording live audio it is more problematic to fix something. And I frequently would rather live with something that has a wart on it but is full of life than edit the very essence right out of it...</p><p>But it isn&apos;t inexperience, Rbt, I think it is just part of everyone being individual in their approach.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
