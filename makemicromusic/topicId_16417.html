At some point, I often mention that I play microtonal music...and what I&apos;ve found, more often then not, is that most musicians, even really good classical or jazz players, have very little to no knowledge of even the most basic terms regarding tuning issues. I&apos;m still surprised when a musician doesn&apos;t know the term cents, or doesn&apos;t know what the harmonic series is...but, it&apos;s a very common thing.<br/>   Of course, the fault is with the education systems that teach music...students are rarely, if ever, exposed to anything other than the 12 tone eq tempered system (and nobody even bothers to explain how IT came to be, either), so they can&apos;t be expected to know about anything else. One of my goals is to help people understand the basics of tuning, so for me, simple concepts are best at first...and what I&apos;ve found is, it can be tricky trying to explain just what the overtone series is, much less the intricacies of Pythagorean tuning, or just why any of it matters in the first place. And, among the folks who study tuning, there can, of course, be many different approaches...the lists are pretty much geared towards really advanced theoretical discussions, so only a few people can understand what&apos;s being talked about. No problem, but it takes years to reach that point. My own personal desire is that the subject of tunings can be made available to as many people as possible, so I gear my language and explanations towards that end...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://nycfretlessguitarfestival.com">nycfretlessguitarfestival.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>iranief &#x3C;carlo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2007 12:43:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;My own personal desire is that the subject of tunings can be made available to as many<br/>people as possible, so I gear my language and explanations towards that end...Hstick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Neil<br/>I really agree with you. this is my first post here.
