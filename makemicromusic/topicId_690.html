The preset &quot;Piccolo&quot; on the<br/>TX-802 was happily there to get me in the swing of this tuning with<br/>8/13 octave (about 738 cents) having a &quot;concordant 3:2-like&quot; feeling<br/>for me, but my desire for more timbres and the example of people like<br/>you and Bill Sethares has gotten me into the timbre/tuning design<br/>game.</p><p>As a rank beginner, over the last two days I used &quot;Algorithm 31&quot; to<br/>design a kind of &quot;organ&quot; with partials such as 3.06 or 6.12, or around<br/>an octave-reduced 736 cents, very close to the 738 cents or so of<br/>13-tET. Sometimes those fifths can sound &quot;as solid as Pythagorean,&quot;<br/>other times a bit ambiguous, and sometimes quite unusual, especially<br/>when the interval doesn&apos;t fit into a usual diatonic pattern.</p><p>Ah, now we have the element of melody &lt;friendly grin&gt;. There&apos;s a<br/>wonderful pentatonic mode of 3-2-3-2-3, or LsLsL as Dan Stearns or<br/>Paul Erlich might say (large-small-large-small-large), which sounds<br/>great with a drone on scale steps 0-8, a &quot;quasi-3:2&quot; concord:</p><p>                     3     2     3      2     3<br/>                 0      3     5      8    10      13<br/>                     L     s     L      s     L</p><p>Anyway, the new organ timbre, however inexpertly set up, goes together<br/>very nicely with the &quot;Piccolo,&quot; on which I also tried a few small<br/>adjustments (although as your spectrum analysis showed, the preset<br/>version already seems nicely optimized for intervals in the general<br/>region of 738 cents).</p><p>I&apos;d like to get out some of this music, even while I&apos;m learning the<br/>basics of the scale, and finding some new shadings of neo-Gothic<br/>progressions.</p><p>By the way, Mary, when listening to the _Xentonality_ CD by Bill<br/>Sethares, I heard a couple of pieces that reminded me a lot of you and<br/>your music, especially the &quot;science fiction&quot; kind of feeling.</p><p>I&apos;m making a longer post about 13-tET to the main Tuning List, where I<br/>explain that terms like &quot;fifth&quot; may suggest a pattern of adding<br/>intervals that really doesn&apos;t apply; I&apos;m developing an approach for<br/>neo-Gothic style that counts intervals in 13-tET steps. A more<br/>experienced musician suggested to me this important point, which can<br/>have some practical ramifications.</p><p>Specifically, if one approaches something like 13-tET mainly in terms<br/>of how it does or doesn&apos;t fit some other tuning system or method of<br/>naming intervals, the result can be a &quot;Ripley&apos;s Believe It or Not&quot;<br/>that focuses on the &quot;oddities&quot; of the scale rather than its own<br/>patterns. Those patterns can lead to lots of different styles -- do<br/>all the people who play in 12-tET agree on the best style for that<br/>tuning?</p><p>Of course, I have my own prejudices -- a scale with an interval around<br/>923 cents (the 10-step interval) tends to draw me in. Incidentally,<br/>there&apos;s another scale with an interval very close to that size which I<br/>want to try -- amazingly going back almost 25 years.</p><p>Anyway, I love that 13-tET interval at 923 cents, a familiar touch in<br/>a tuning where lots is new and different.</p><p>Jacky, thanks for such a generous reply, and for your creative example<br/>and assistance in approaching the designing or customization of<br/>timbres.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
