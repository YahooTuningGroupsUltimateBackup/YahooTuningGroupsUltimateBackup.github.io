In fact, when I realized, some years ago, that an interval could be in more than one position, it was a major breakthrough in my understanding of much music around the world. It&apos;s the basic concept that is important, and whether or not I know exactly how many cents or what ratio a pitch lands on is not a big deal. That&apos;s why theory is such a tricky business, cause the players may be doing something a bit different from what the theorists say. And that&apos;s ok by me...HHH</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=13914 href="#13914">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2006 9:24:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hyall</p><p>I recorded a new piece on my 21t-ji guitar. u can find it here:</p><p><a href="http://nagarjuna.onlinestoragesolution.com/new%20ji/">http://nagarjuna.onlinestoragesolution.com/new%20ji/</a></p><p>there are no fx on this- i am experimenting with trying to get a more live<br/>sound. let me know if it works or you think it needs some &apos;verb.</p><p>thanks</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=13918 href="#13918">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2006 11:59:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;hyall<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I recorded a new piece on my 21t-ji guitar. u can find it here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://nagarjuna.onlinestoragesolution.com/new%20ji/">http://nagarjuna.onlinestoragesolution.com/new%20ji/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;there are no fx on this- i am experimenting with trying to get a more live<br/>&gt;sound. let me know if it works or you think it needs some &apos;verb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;thanks<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dante</p><p>I&apos;m so glad you did this.

This recording is of<br/>&gt; good quality.  As for reverb -- it might be nice to<br/>&gt; have some but I think it stands quite well without<br/>&gt; it also.  I like its fairly upbeat tempo.

I like the way it&apos;s idiomatic in a guitarish sense but lets you know where the action is. And it&apos;s a decent length. As for reverb I&apos;d be wondering why you&apos;d really want to place the performance in an artificial space. Anyway it makes me want to go back to my 22 tet guitar and write again.</p><p>james</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
