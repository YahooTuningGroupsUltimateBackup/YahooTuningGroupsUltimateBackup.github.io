I would say more but...  :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Frankly, I prefer the &quot;straight&quot; version to the<br/>Catharsis &quot;creative&quot; one, but only because it adheres more to the<br/>piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;m willing to bet, when you are composing with the same<br/>hardware, you won&apos;t be listening in the same way. Your ears have been<br/>opened...</p><p>****This list has *totally* changed how I listen to electronic<br/>music.  It didn&apos;t take much, either.  Just a few people saying, &quot;Aw,<br/>come on, it *can* sound better than *this!*&quot;  :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But his reverb is *terrific.*  MUCH better than what I was able to<br/>do with my paltry SoundForge XP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s not a surprise, is it? *You* could probably improve<br/>someone else&apos;s compositional work, even if they had *recorded* it<br/>well.</p><p>****That makes sense, and maybe I need to manipulate the reverb<br/>more.  What I was getting that I didn&apos;t like was a *very* synthetic-<br/>sounding &quot;ring, ring, ring, ring&quot; on the solo drum section.  I mean,<br/>I was willing to *live* with it, but Catharsis (Mike) managed to make<br/>the reverb sound *much* better in these sections.</p><p>Or, maybe I&apos;ll just save time and send my files to Mike for mastering<br/>in the future if he&apos;s willing to do it...  :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Now what to do about John Starrett:  since *my* reverb version<br/>with SoundForge XP *sucks* compared to this...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a no-brainer, and I&apos;m sure John would concur: the Best<br/>Sounding Recording is the one that should be heard, even if it<br/>involves more work in taking one down and putting one up.

I&apos;m starting to be a pest.</p><p>jp</p></div>
