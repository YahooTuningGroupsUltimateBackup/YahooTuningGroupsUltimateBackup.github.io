For example, I just talked to an old micro hand, Jeff Stayton, a guitarist who McLaren turned me onto years ago. He did a number of pieces on a 22 tone guitar, interesting stuff. His comment was that tuning is just one component of a piece, and I couldn&apos;t agree more. There are many potential layers of any composition...the scale(s), chord progressions, arrangement, orchestration, technical difficulty, tones of the instruments, rhythms used...not to mention melody, which is often the most difficult of all musical arts. Then, of course, does the piece have emotional/spiritual depth? Does it have deep meaning, for now and the future? Overall, that&apos;s what I look for...when the piece is over, did it move me? Make me feel/experience something of merit? Will I be listening to it years from now? I&apos;ve been listening to Bach, the Beatles, Hendrix, Debussy, Django, Miles, and many others for a long time now...and they never get old, I always find something worthwhile in the music, no matter how many times I listen to it.

So, I think that if we look under the hood we&apos;re going to find that we actually share a lot of basic ideas.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I think is going on: the distinction between intellect and emotion is bogus. For example, laughing is the epitome of emotional experience, yet you don&apos;t need to be tickeled with a feather in order to laugh, you can laugh at a witty joke, even an obscure joke very few people would even understand (specific to your professional field for example). You can think of countless examples, and even quote science on things like depression lowering your math skills or whatever.</p><p>And, just as intellect and emotion are not seperate, neither is the &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot; in music. What you call &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;flow&quot; and so on can also be described as in blunt terms as &quot;technical proficiency&quot;.
