With the DSL here I<br/>&gt; can pull down huge mp3s in seconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW - when can we expect the next one from your quarter? Eargerly<br/>&gt; awaiting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L</p><p>***Thanks, Jacky.  I shudda thunk of that.</p><p>Well, the Blackjack piece for cello and electronics is in the works.<br/>It&apos;s taking some time to transcribe it, and I&apos;m using Sibelius now,<br/>which, in the meantime, I had to learn from scratch (great program,<br/>though).  This will be using the Sims 72-tET accidentals as developed<br/>by Ted Mook.  Hopefully Mook will like the piece and will play it,<br/>too.  There are also some other cellists I am sending it to.</p><p>Mike (Catharsis) is going to help me with the sound processing of the<br/>electronic part, if he&apos;s available when I finish with this.  I find I<br/>am changing the piece -- at least the cello part, to make the<br/>fingering easier, etc. so it can&apos;t be recorded yet.</p><p>Then I am off for a while to *acoustic* projects, since that&apos;s what<br/>I&apos;ve been asked to do:  a trio for guitar, violin and viola, a solo<br/>guitar piece, a solo organ piece and a trio for electric guitar,<br/>cello and percussion.</p><p>Of course, I haven&apos;t written any of these pieces yet, so I hope some<br/>of the people don&apos;t forget about them in the meantime!</p><p>In any case, probably the acoustic pieces won&apos;t be quite as *intense*<br/>microtonally as the blackjack pieces with electronics, which probably<br/>are my *most* &quot;advanced&quot; pieces to date.  Most probably I will be<br/>doing more in the way of 72-tET intervals and sounds in the acoustic<br/>pieces, but not working my way through a visual tuning lattice as I<br/>was with Blackjack.</p><p>But, that will make the piece interesting to analyze, as Jon<br/>mentioned, since I can post up a .mp3 and *also* a .pdf of the piece<br/>and anybody interested can try to figure out how it relates to the<br/>Blackjack lattice.</p><p>Then, the &quot;future, future&quot; plans involve more electronics with<br/>Blackjack.  For that, I hope to expand my MIDI stuff, but as you know<br/>that&apos;s a &quot;never ending...&quot;  &quot;$$$&quot; process.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=3097 href="#3097">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2002 3:29:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
