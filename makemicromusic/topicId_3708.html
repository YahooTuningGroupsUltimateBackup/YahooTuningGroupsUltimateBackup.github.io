MIDI Relay was released in 1998 when I discovered I had a<br/>&gt; website.  It was working in 1997.  I was playing with pitch bends before<br/>&gt; that, certainly in 1995, but not with live or MIDI file input.  A few<br/>&gt; years before 1994 and I didn&apos;t have access to a multimedia PC.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel had Scala retuning MIDI files after I&apos;d written Midiconv but before<br/>&gt; I&apos;d released it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea of tuning with pitch bends was common then, but there wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; anything on PCs(?) to do it automatically.  I know there&apos;s an old program<br/>&gt; for dynamically retuning an FB01 with its SysEx messages.</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p><p>What about Denny Genovese&apos;s Microtonal Midi Translator, I wonder when that<br/>dates back to.</p><p>I&apos;ve updated the FTS links to microtonal programs to show<br/>all the ones I know about that do retuning and are still<br/>currently available. If anyone knows of any more<br/>I&apos;ll add them in.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk/">http://tunesmithy.co.uk/</a></p><p>- go to Other Tuning programs</p><p>Robert</p></div>
