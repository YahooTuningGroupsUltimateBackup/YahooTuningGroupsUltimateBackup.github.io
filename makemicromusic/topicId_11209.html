I was listening to Choraled again.  Yeah,  I guess I can imagine<br/>it sounding good (I&apos;m talking about the playing. . .not the piece itself<br/>and it&apos;s pleasantly twisty maze of harmonic progressions, which I like).</p><p>It&apos;s wierd though ..  .I just have this wierd psychological thing about  .<br/> . .when I&apos;m listening to fixed pitch insts like piano or guitar, somehow<br/>I feel confident that whatever wierdness I hear is SUPPOSED to be there,<br/>and I can just sit back and enjoy it. .  .but with strings,  again,<br/>somehow I feel the uncertainty of pitch,  and it worries me . . .</p><p>Of course,  who am I to talk.  It takes a lot to be a string player.  I&apos;m<br/>but a mere pianist.  It&apos;s easy for us.</p><p>so,  enough rambling.</p></div>
