At least plan on getting one. It&apos;s a good plan.<br/>&gt; A G4 of some sort - eMac, PowerBook, iMac, PowerMac.<br/>&gt; User-friendly desktop Unix super-computing. And with it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;CoreAudio&quot;, it&apos;s got music in it&apos;s soul. Reportedly it&apos;s dead<br/>&gt; easy to write audio &amp; MIDI apps in OS X, including software synths.</p><p>Hmmm, well... I&apos;m not going to personally get a Mac unless I win the<br/>lottery or something. (I do have one here -- a G4 dual processor, hubba<br/>hubba with a huge disk and memory. It&apos;s destined to be a web/project server<br/>and move elsewhere.)</p><p>Some background info, as long as I&apos;m talking, even though this is a bit<br/>off-topic. (This platform business hits one of my hot buttons, so forgive<br/>me if I&apos;m ranting. You can skip down to the Absynth news.)</p><p>I was at NeXT for 7+ years followed by 3 years at Apple. My team<br/>implemented pieces of the new Apple UI. Before that, my team did the NeXT<br/>UI and Application Kit object framework pieces starting way way back in the<br/>days of NextStep in 1990. I&apos;m quite aware of of how cool the new Mac OS X<br/>is, etc. I spent 10 years working on it! Until Mac OS X, all Apple OSes<br/>sucked, pure and simple -- hideous to program, etc, they were stuck in the<br/>1970s and never got &quot;fixed&quot; until NeXT came along and replaced the old Mac<br/>OS with Mac OS X. Compared to the old NeXT OS, and now Mac OS X, everything<br/>else still sucks as a development environment and a user environment both.<br/>Mac OS X is great, and so is Objective-C. Just about any Unix box still<br/>beats the hell out of Windows in terms of stability. (Even my brand-new<br/>Windows XP box still has some of the same mysterious slow-downs and<br/>inexplicable program-deaths and machine wig-outs that Windows has always<br/>been famous for.)</p><p>I&apos;m afraid that at this point, the software and hardware I want to run for<br/>music making is cheaper and more ubiquitous on the PC platform, and having<br/>a long investment in this stuff, I&apos;m not going to switch platforms just to<br/>run SuperCollider! ;-) There&apos;s always Infinity... or Reaktor... if I want<br/>to go the toolbox route.</p><p>I think that if anyone is a serious developer and they want people to use<br/>their software in the world and they want to make a difference, they would<br/>be doing two things: (1) developing for deployment on the &quot;majority&quot;<br/>platform (PC), and (2): bugging Apple to ship their kick-ass development<br/>environment on the PC platform. (At one time, NeXT did ship on the Intel<br/>platform... and even Apple once shipped a Developer version of the NeXT<br/>software for Intel.)</p><p>That&apos;s my 2 cents.</p><p>Oh! Speaking of platforms. I found out today that Absynth, from Native<br/>Instruments, has a shipping PC demo. Check it out! Cool synth! Has some<br/>builtin tunings. I had earlier asked them this question:</p><p>&gt; Are there plans to implement the MIDI tuning standard in<br/>&gt; Absynth? Any plans to make it possible for users to add their own scales<br/>&gt; with their own scales in files? In the next version maybe?</p><p>And today they wrote back to me and said:</p><p>&gt; Yes, we might have it in 2.0.</p><p>Get yer lobbying in, friends!</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
