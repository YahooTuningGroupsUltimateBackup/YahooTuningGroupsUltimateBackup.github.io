This was pre-joining the tuning<br/>  list, it is semi-microtonal in nature, but I can&apos;t tell you what intonation<br/>  or ratios I was using, other than what sounded good to my ears at the time.<br/>  The pentatonic scale used is 1, 3, 4, 5, 7b.</p><p>  <a href="http://www.sethausten.com/microtone.html">http://www.sethausten.com/microtone.html</a></p><p>  click on the link on that page, hope you enjoy it...</p><p>  Seth</p><p>  --<br/>  Seth Austen</p><p>  <a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>  emails: seth@...<br/>  klezmusic@...</p><p>        Yahoo!
