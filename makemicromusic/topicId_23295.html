The second one has more major chords, but the voicing<br/>&gt;and voice leading sucks (technically speaking- there&apos;s no accounting<br/>&gt;for taste), and voila, it&apos;s darker.</p><p>Yes, voicing is important.  No argument here!  Putting on the<br/>psychoacoustics hat for a moment, 4:3 is more discordant<br/>than 3:2, 5:6:8 more than 4:5:6, etc etc.  And that is probably<br/>one of the underlying reasons why voicing is important in<br/>musical consonance and perception.</p><p>&gt;Basic counterpoint stuff- weak or strange voice leading and voicing<br/>&gt;makes for muddier or darker music, regardless of mode or chords.</p><p>You bet!  Also, I thought they both sounded cool even though<br/>they were really short.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=23344 href="#23344">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2010 7:34:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Oct 1, 2010 at 2:03 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At 10:47 AM 9/30/2010, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Yip, I agree with you and Carl on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It looks like Mike&apos;s agreeing, but I&apos;m not completely sure<br/>&gt; what he&apos;s saying...</p><p>Saying about what?

He could have worked it out so that for the second example the<br/>minor stuff was played on top and the major stuff was played on bottom<br/>and it might have sounded more like the blues, but he did it the other<br/>way so it sounded like mush.
