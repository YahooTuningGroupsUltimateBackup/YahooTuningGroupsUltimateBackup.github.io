The Mishandled Blacksmith (Jay09.MP3).  Actually the third of three<br/>     cuts which comprise the Music History Suite, this is my favorite of<br/>     the 12 tracks in the CD Jay recently sent me.</p><p>   . Slide Trombona (Jay06.MP3).  A hilarious parody of My Sharona by<br/>     The Knack.</p><p>Important disclaimer: I play a small role in the first of these: Jay<br/>entrusted me with the tuning of the piano part in 7-limit adaptive JI.<br/>I think it&apos;s lovely!  But mostly this is due to Jay&apos;s composing and<br/>execution of the piano and trombone parts.</p><p>I uploaded both pieces to</p><p>   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-challenges/files/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-challenges/files/</a></p><p>which should be accessible whether or not one is a member.  You&apos;ll see<br/>the files in the root directory.  Enjoy!!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
