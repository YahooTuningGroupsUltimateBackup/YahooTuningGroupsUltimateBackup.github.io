I should have kept in<br/>mind. As soon as I am home, in my music-internet-office (actually<br/>north-no-light-window, one bed, full of instruments-&quot;office&quot; with some roads to walk<br/>between the stuff), I&apos;ll correct that.</p><p>I am using your compliments about the pieces a little to wipe the dust off<br/>my microtonal soul.<br/>Please like this sentence. Somehow it reflects what I feel :)</p><p>I am Clemens Trauzettel. Nice to meet you, Carl Lumma :)</p><p>About that thing you identified as TET. I felt that. But I was not sure<br/>anymore. I created it after hours, in the middle time between night and morning.<br/>When checking the relay, there was nothing active (it should be, Clemens,<br/>shouldn&apos;t it?), but my ears had this strange (well ... tired?) feeling of a<br/>great difference ;)<br/>Anyway, I decided to upload it. Next time I am about musical jokes (at least<br/>before 11 pm), you&apos;ll find a historic clown.</p><p>Thanks for your comments, they are always appreciated *smile*<br/>Clemens</p><p>--<br/>+++ GMX - die erste Adresse f&uuml;r Mail, Message, More +++<br/>Neu: Preissenkung f&uuml;r MMS und FreeMMS! <a href="http://www.gmx.net">http://www.gmx.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=5605 href="#5605">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2003 9:57:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I am Clemens Trauzettel.
