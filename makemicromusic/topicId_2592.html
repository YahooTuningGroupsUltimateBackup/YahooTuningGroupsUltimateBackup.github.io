(Since, if there&apos;s the slightest attempt at a standard,<br/>I&apos;d like to use that instead of going my own way).</p><p>For now, I only want to have this music notated on paper, in case my<br/>computer system crashes totally, as a memory of my juvenile musical crimes.</p><p>I&apos;ll try out both of your suggestions, thanks.</p></div>
