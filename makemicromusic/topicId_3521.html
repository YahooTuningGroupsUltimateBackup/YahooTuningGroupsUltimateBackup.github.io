My next work will be in<br/>53-equal. I&apos;ve just bought Gigastudio from TASCAM, and it is a truly<br/>great sampling program except for one thing: it&apos;s not microtonal<br/>friendly! It is possible to custom-tune every instrument with every<br/>bowing for every note manually, but I estimate that to do this with<br/>the Garritan Strings program alone would take 300,000 manually-<br/>entered computer commands.<br/>Right now TASCAM engineers are working on Gigastudio version 3.0, and<br/>they are CONSIDERING making the next version microtonal friendly. Not<br/>only for hard-core microtonalists, but also ethnic music tunings,<br/>early music tunings, and even fine-tunings for traditional string<br/>orchestra sounds. As most people know, real string orchestras don&apos;t<br/>play pure 12-equal, and sampled string orchestras will sound that<br/>much &quot;sweeter&quot; if they are subtly retuned. All of this great musical<br/>potential can only be realized if they make it possible to set up<br/>custom tuning templates of some kind.<br/>The TASCAM folks have told me that they are more likely to add tuning<br/>macro capability of some kind if enough people ask about it. Even if<br/>you don&apos;t have GigaStudio, PLEASE e-mail them soon at<br/>custser@... and ask them if they can handle microtonal or<br/>alternative or ethnic or early music tunings globally (individual<br/>instruments can be tuned, but what about a global tuning macro?). If<br/>they DO add the tuning macro to Gigastudio 3.0, let me tell you it<br/>will be a great new addition to the microtonalist&apos;s sound palette.<br/>The instruments sound incredibly natural, and they now have a wide<br/>range of sounds: classical, traditional, pop, ethnic, you name it.<br/>Thanks in advance everyone for any help you can give!<br/>All my best,<br/>Chris Mohr</p></div><h3><a id=3522 href="#3522">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

(I rarely shout like this) I hope that anyone involved in this area of music making ala micro (i.e. not people who only work with acoustic instruments) will consider writing to these people. MANUEL - (again, sorry to shout) - I think it would be great if you could drop them a line and maybe give them some examples of the .scl file format, examples of a couple of tunings, and maybe some figures on how many people you estimate might be using Scala (and/or other microtuning programs).</p><p>I&apos;ll drop them a line myself, on behalf of the list, as well.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=3525 href="#3525">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@...</h3><span>6/28/2002 6:56:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>I&apos;ve sent them a mail.
