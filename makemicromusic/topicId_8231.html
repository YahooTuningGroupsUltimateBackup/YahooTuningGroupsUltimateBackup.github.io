Catler&apos;s site is pretty elliptical about what the<br/>guitar can actually do, so allow me to elaborate.</p><p>The 12-tone Ultra Plus builds up like this:<br/>To every note except Eb, the seventh harmonic is added, via 7<br/>additional frets which are 30 cents lower than their 12-equal<br/>counterparts.  This allows for septimal minors and harmonic sevenths<br/>built off of the original 12-tet notes, and septimal majors built<br/>using the &quot;new&quot; notes as tonics.  There are lots of additional<br/>intervals possible as well that I am too lazy to list.</p><p>THEN:<br/>3 quartertone/11-limit frets are added, between the 12-tone 3rd and<br/>4th frets, the 5th and 6th frets, and 10th and 11th frets.  These can<br/>add 11/8&apos;s, 11/9&apos;s, 11/6&apos;s, 16/11&apos;s...lots of 11-limit intervals,<br/>though each not each type of interval applies to each note of 12-tet.</p><p>THEN:<br/>Add 2 13-limit frets, one between the 12-tone 1st and 2nd frets, and<br/>one between the 8th and 9th frets.  These frets are approximately 40<br/>cents sharper than the 12-tet fret below them.  These add 13/8&apos;s,<br/>13/12&apos;s, 16/13&apos;s, and others that I haven&apos;t bothered to calculate<br/>yet, to the 12-tet notes, though not to all of them.</p><p>The only potential drawback of this system is that certain notes only<br/>occur in one place, so chords are position-dependent and scales can<br/>be limited to only one octave.  Also, some of the 13-limit chords can<br/>only be formed from certain tonics.  This doesn&apos;t really bug me,<br/>though, since the possibilities are still pretty extensive.  However,<br/>it might not work for you if you want to perform your guitar/tape<br/>piece on one instrument...it all depends on which pitches you use.  I<br/>should also note that using different tunings makes certain chords<br/>possible that aren&apos;t possible in other tunings (in case that isn&apos;t<br/>immediately obvious).</p><p>If you&apos;re interested, Catler is currently selling Ultra-Plus necks by<br/>themselves for about $550, though you have to drill and bolt them<br/>yourself (not to mention crown the frets).  I bought one and paid a<br/>local luthier to $145 to set it up for me, and I think it was well<br/>worth it.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>&gt; What is this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like you can build 13-limit chords on each 12-tone degree?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve completed a piece recently for 12-tet guitar,  with a tape<br/>part that<br/>&gt; often puts 13-limit JI chords on the 12-tet pitch intoned by the<br/>guitar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; cb</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2004 10:08:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>cityoftheasleep wrote:</p><p>&gt;If you&apos;re interested, Catler is currently selling Ultra-Plus necks by &gt;themselves for about $550, though you have to drill and bolt them &gt;yourself (not to mention crown the frets).
