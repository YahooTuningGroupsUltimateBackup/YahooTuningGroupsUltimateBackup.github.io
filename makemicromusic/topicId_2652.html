When you stack<br/>those to make chords, and with many partials<br/>for each note of the chord,you soon run out<br/>of channels for teh pitch bends. I had got over<br/>that to some extent by using multiple midi out<br/>ports, but this will be much more flexible.</p><p>I&apos;ll do some example files with those custom voices,<br/>as they will be pretty demanding and maybe be<br/>useful benchmarks for the real time retuning.</p><p>Then the next upload of FTS will be able to do<br/>single note retuning. It will be<br/>a preliminary version, there is sure to be more to<br/>do for that, but it will give an idea.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2662 href="#2662">ðŸ”—</a>justintonation &#x3C;JUSTINTONATION@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2002 7:22:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;X.

As I am not a programmer I do not know<br/>what is easy or hard.</p><p>An idea that I had was basically to do it based on the position of<br/>the notes on the various keys.  You would have the notes on the<br/>chordal [left hand] side set with various most consonant<br/>relationships. E.g In the key of C [I do not envisage any key<br/>changing per se in this model]</p><p>Left hand</p><p>0 1/1   C<br/>1 17/16 or 16/15 ...<br/>2  9/8 or 10/9 or 8/7...<br/>3. 6/5 or 7/6 or 19/16 ...<br/>4. 5/4...<br/>5. 4/3...<br/>6. 7/5...<br/>7. 3/2...<br/>8. 8/5...<br/>9. 5/3<br/>10.7/4 or 9/5...<br/>11. 15/8...<br/>12.2/1</p><p>Then on the right hand monophonic section<br/>a scale or a series of scales can be chosen. The following<br/>series of scales is designed to play the [melodic] enharmonic<br/>shifts in the Boomsliter and Creel [melodic theorists] blue<br/>reference [listen to &apos;Chase in Thailand for it&apos;s use.]</p><p>Right hand scale 1. [any scale could be used in reality, ideas are<br/>indian scales etc.]<br/>0. 1/1 matches to left hand position 0.<br/>1. 9/8 matches to left hand position 2.

[i.e is a wholetone]<br/>4. 5/4 matches to right hand position 4.<br/>5. 45/32 matches to left hand postion 6.[i.e it is a tritone]<br/>6. 35/24 matches to left hand position 7.

I will not list them all here though.<br/>One of them has no tonic and others have compressed octaves<br/>[63/32] but it all behaves the same way as I have shown above.</p><p>The only sliding of pitches on the right hand will be when a new<br/>melodic scale is selected via two way foot pedal or some other<br/>method.</p><p>&gt; Not sure what it would sound like but we could try it and see.<br/>&gt; It is the sort of thing that might be easy to do if<br/>&gt; the ideas fell into place...

I have found that in my<br/>experience out of tune- ness is more a melodic thing than a<br/>harmonic thing. I have noticed that I can really warp the harmony<br/>but as long as the melody sounds stable and intact it does not<br/>sound unmusical.  I personally really love the sound of notes<br/>sliding into tune, whether this happens fast or slow could be<br/>something that is set aswell. This is what you mean as glitches?<br/>Perhaps they will be not glitches but rather devices that can be<br/>used knowingly for expressive purposes.</p><p>&gt; Maybe one could learn to work with that as performer<br/>&gt; by playing early  in the melody line or something<br/>&gt; - always lead the chords with the melody.</p><p>Sure. Any new instrument or technology evolves new playing<br/>styles.</p><p>&gt; I plan a chords section somewhat later on (after release of<br/>&gt; FTS and release of my VRML trees program) and will<br/>&gt; perhaps get into the various models of consonance and things<br/>&gt; then.

Then since<br/>we are keeping the right hand notes fixed, without shifts,<br/>the left hand chord needs to be tuned<br/>10/9 4/3 5/3</p><p>Now, keeping that chord sounding, right hand melody<br/>descends A F D - well it will have to be tuned<br/>as 5/3 4/3 10/9 won&apos;t it, or it will sound out of tune<br/>with the accompaniment.</p><p>So we have a shift from 9/8 to 10/9 for the second in<br/>right hand.</p><p>Now continue D B G in right hand accompanied by<br/>a V chord, and you have to end up at 40/27 for the fifth<br/>_in the melody line_</p><p>So by now we see that we definitely have a case of comma drift.</p><p>An alternative is to let the melody continue as<br/>5/3 4/3 9/8<br/>- and then retune the entire II chord in left hand<br/>so the whole chord slides about in pitch as the<br/>melody changes. So you use 10/9 4/3 5/3 as before,<br/>and when you get to the 9/8 in the<br/>melody line, the entire II chord shifts up in pitch<br/>by a syntonic comma. I think that might be rather noticeable<br/>though (can be okay if one is doing it as a composer and<br/>choosing to use this effect, but not so desirable I think<br/>if automated).</p><p>So, I think maybe we have to let the melody line<br/>shift in tonic, or drift in tonic too. I wonder what you<br/>think?</p><p>At present with the tonic drift method, you can let<br/>the tonic drift and then if it has drifted too far,<br/>you can press a tonic shift key twice, which retunes<br/>that note to the original pitch. E.g. with tonic drift<br/>method if you change tonic to A by hitting that key once,<br/>then it does it with tonic drift, but if you hit it twice<br/>in succession, it  does a reset, shifts tonic back to A<br/>with A at its original tuning.</p><p>The idea of listing several alternatives to use for the left hand<br/>seems a possiblity one could investigate - a finite<br/>list of alternatives, limiting the comma drift, ..</p><p>Anyway I think perhaps the best thing is if I make sure it<br/>is working fine doing the tonic shifts on demand from<br/>player, as well as possible at the moment. That is enough<br/>of a programming challenge for the time being I must say<br/>- and several things still to do.</p><p>It&apos;s possible to add the tonic shifts after the event<br/>- you play the piece in a well temperament say,<br/>then go through and figure out the tonic for each<br/>section and add the tonic shifts in a separate tonic<br/>shifts midi channel and play that through FTS.</p><p>Maybe after you have tried the various options out and seen how it<br/>works, and whether you like the program for that matter,<br/>maybe then we can think about ways of automating it,<br/>if it seems possible.</p><p>I&apos;ll also think about it too.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a few ideas in mind. Including the one I mentioned<br/>before.</p><p>One idea following from your suggestions is to designate<br/>one part as the melody line<br/>and then when one has tonic drift, do it so that<br/>the melody line doesn&apos;t shift, instead of doing it<br/>so that the new tonic doesn&apos;t shift in pitch which<br/>is as it is now. (if no note is playing in melody part<br/>then keep the new tonic the same pitch as before, as it is now).<br/>That doesn&apos;t sound too hard to do.</p><p>Another idea is to list chords that are okay in<br/>the tuning you are using, e.g. that it is j.i twelve tone with I, V and IV<br/>pure (or maybe FTS finds these for you and then you edit the resulting<br/>list of chords).</p><p>Then if you play a II chord, FTS could tonic<br/>shift (or drift) to the nearest new tonic around the circle<br/>of fifths  that has a pure major triad for that chord<br/>- in this case I imagine it would be to the D, with the<br/>I chord of D minor functioning as the II.</p><p>In this case the tonic shift would happen as soon as<br/>FTS can recognise the chord - prob. immediately after<br/>all three notes have been played - and would be done<br/>to keep the melody line at the same tuning as it had<br/>before the shift. Then when melody drifts too far you<br/>press a reset button (need to decide what that is<br/>- e.g. specific midi keyboard key, or controller, or maybe<br/>character on keyboard) to get it back again.</p><p>Sudden pitch shifts immediately after<br/>the start of a note are prob. inevitable<br/>in the accompaniment (e.g. slightly broken chord and<br/>as later notes come in the pitch of earlier notes<br/>gets shifted to tune). I&apos;m not sure whether this<br/>will sound nice or not. If it isn&apos;t too hard to<br/>program when the time comes I may just program it in<br/>so we can try it out and see if it sounds okay.</p><p>Generally as programmer, automated retuning of chords and<br/>choosing of tonic shifts seems like a tricky area<br/>to program, esp. in real time. May be possible if<br/>one can find some kind of limited kind of range of things<br/>that one wants to be able to do that happens to fit<br/>in with suitable programming methods.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
