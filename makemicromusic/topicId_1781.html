In his book &apos;Africa and the blues&apos; Gerhard Kubik claims that the<br/>roots of the blues scale are in the same series of partials (though he<br/>found his source in West Africa).</p><p>The only place in Africa where throat singing is found is in the Western<br/>Cape (I&apos;ve heard it). Amongst the Xhosa people (within a few miles of<br/>Nelson Mandela&apos;s birthplace) there can be found some throat singers.

Pehrson</p><p>Well, there are at least three main notes you have to consider at any<br/>given moment in certain styles of throat singing. The note your vocal<br/>cords would &quot;naturally&quot; produce in that position; the note that they<br/>end up &quot;buzzing&quot; on; and the harmonic of that note which you shape<br/>your mouth to emphasize. Call these a, b, and c. Well, b is always a<br/>subharmonic of a, and c is always a harmonic of b.</p><p>Usually, b is an octave below a, and is held constant, while c is<br/>allowed to vary among the harmonics of b. So throat singing usually<br/>features a constant low drone and a harmonic-series scale over that<br/>drone. But I suppose, if one has mastered the art of changing b, as<br/>Jim Cole or someone apparently has, and one changed c independently<br/>of that, one would have access to _all_ the simple just ratios<br/>relative to the 1/1 of a. I haven&apos;t heard anyone do anything like<br/>this, though. Finally, one could vary a as well, and then there&apos;s no<br/>restriction on which pitches you can produce.</p><p>Now what was the question again? :)</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2002 6:21:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1790">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1790</a></p><p>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul Erlich knows a lot about this and can answer it specifically<br/>&gt; &gt; when he comes back on this list.
