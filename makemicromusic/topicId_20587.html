This is the first time I have tried out Gamma. Actually a mode of it (as I explain on my blog). I think that to really get the feeling of any tuning system it takes a lot of time but the first try did get nice results! So, I&apos;ll keep practicing!<br/>:-)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fantastic, Carlo!</p></div>
