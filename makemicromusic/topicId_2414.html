If you need a map,<br/>the contrast is more or less paragraph by paragraph.  This wasn&apos;t written in<br/>order.  Enough with the disclaimers.  This probably doesn&apos;t belong on any<br/>one list but I&apos;m not going to bother cross posting the response.  It started<br/>here, it ends here.</p><p>Bottom line:  what THIS POST has to do with MAKING MICROTONAL MUSIC, is the<br/>ceasing of stagnant means and the motivation through confrontation which by<br/>the end will yield my own, and hopefully someone else&apos;s.  Anyone who can&apos;t<br/>handle a little dissonance, go play Chop Sticks in 19 all day.  As in music,<br/>so in life, so we begin:</p><p>On 2/27/02 6:44 PM, &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; musicians,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it has just come to my attention that i&apos;ve hurt a friend of mine with<br/>&gt; my remarks here -- this person just sent me an e-mail.</p><p>Was it me?  I&apos;m not aware if it was.  I&apos;m sure even you know about my lapses<br/>in consciousness by now.  Either way it&apos;s a relief.  Because either I<br/>blacked out and told you off, or I can start feeling like I&apos;m not the only<br/>person you antagonize.</p><p>***** remembering back *****</p><p>On 5/23/01 3:34 PM, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; When sitting in front of a computer screen, though, I tend to be more<br/>&gt; interested in &quot;cold, hard facts&quot; . . . that&apos;s the mindset that I have to be<br/>&gt; in, anyway, most of the time I&apos;m in front of the computer. I suppose I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; compartmentalized my personality somewhat.</p><p>***** ***** ***** ***** *****</p><p>I&apos;ve remembered this, quoted from your passing on the opportunity to join<br/>the [spiritual_tuning] group.  It wasn&apos;t long after this that you created<br/>the tuning math group which, if you remember, you created specifically to<br/>get me off the tuning list.  And then every so often you started telling me<br/>where to go, tuning math, meta etc.  I don&apos;t know if you were really<br/>conscious of any of this.</p><p>I mean it&apos;s not like you live in the woods and don&apos;t have a phone or<br/>internet service or an unknown address because you&apos;re afraid of the<br/>government and have to have someone bring you your posts on a diskette<br/>disinfected by three virus checking programs and then criticize everyone who<br/>tries to specialize in any study just so you can proclaim yourself as a<br/>composer when in reality you&apos;re so wrapped up in your own paranoid ego you<br/>don&apos;t realize your music sucks, now, is it?</p><p>No.  It&apos;s absolutely not.  You&apos;re not like that at all.  You&apos;re very well<br/>into the city end of this society.  You have interests in specific topics,<br/>you have a good vocabulary about it, your music is good to listen to and you<br/>have a high sense of individuality.  Keep that thought.</p><p>&gt; well, i&apos;m truly sorry to have caused any injury. i only had the<br/>&gt; interest of truth and the best interests of the microtonal community<br/>&gt; in mind -- but i crossed a line i should not have crossed.</p><p>Best interests.  Maybe try to remember there aren&apos;t exactly TUTORS in this<br/>realm.  Pretty much everyone is busting their ass one way or another.</p><p>Well it&apos;s alright.  That&apos;s why I agreed to offer up my private definitions<br/>to the public dictionary so I wouldn&apos;t have to strain through any more<br/>semantics battles.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty much why I stopped posting last year.  Don&apos;t worry, Paul, it<br/>wasn&apos;t *only* because of you.  Some of it was a few other people.  Some of<br/>it even had to do with problems I have reading.</p><p>I mean really, imagine if you can, working completely on your own with<br/>little or no academic resources, finding mathematical ideas you want to<br/>share with other people, trying to explain it only to have heads scratched<br/>for weeks until finally someone finds the benevolence to proclaim OH THAT,<br/>that&apos;s {some 20-letter name} which we stopped talking about four years ago.<br/>After the exasperation, it&apos;s still pretty alienating.</p><p>Not all of us went to Harvard, you know.</p><p>&gt; as a self-reprimand, i will refrain from posting to this list until i<br/>&gt; have actual pieces of music i&apos;d like to present to you all.</p><p>Really why didn&apos;t you post something for 22 day?  At least you inspired a<br/>bunch of people.  Spontaneous inventing of an occasion is a fairly good<br/>leadership quality.  Have you ever done any conducting?</p><p>From before when I said hold that thought.  If you don&apos;t have a lot of<br/>problems with sleep, you can use 22, specifically, to make yourself more<br/>productive.  Playing a lot of 31 is like this posting endlessly.  It *is*<br/>good practice to talk and talk a lot.  The spirit of productivity is<br/>something you have to fight for to attain through 22.  As far as the whole<br/>&quot;wasting time&quot; thread, that&apos;s just it.  All the conversation doesn&apos;t<br/>completely *waste* time, but there is much more productivity to be had.  Why<br/>don&apos;t you write more?  Why don&apos;t you have more music that other people can<br/>readily listen to?  Or, like me, do you simply have a backlog of things you<br/>*have* written trying to find the easiest way to let people listen to them?</p><p>&gt; i love you all and you know where to find me . . .</p><p>Yes, on YOUR tuning list.  Oh by the way PLEASE send me a private email with<br/>nothing more than the email address of the group I should have posted this<br/>to.  I miss being shooed.  Makes me feel so outclassed, like the stubble<br/>under the blades of a Monday morning razor, desperate to go back OVER the<br/>bridge to Brooklyn and ask for a KAWFEE rather than strolling in SoHo<br/>looking for a latt&eacute;.</p><p>But again, truth versus hurting someone... There are people who consider<br/>themselves &quot;brutally honest&quot;, who will tell you the truth even if it hurts.<br/>That&apos;s not particularly compassionate, and people who do that tend to not<br/>care.  There are also people who construct upsetting sets of realistic data<br/>in such a way as to SPECIFICALLY upset other people.  There are people who<br/>lie to themselves and others almost indiscriminately so as to *never* &quot;hurt&quot;<br/>anyone.  So what&apos;s left?  It&apos;s difficult to collect exciting information<br/>while not upsetting people along the way.</p><p>Wrapping up.</p><p>In consumer mode, I would rather you try thinking about all I&apos;m telling you,<br/>maybe not all at once since, as I said, some of this should have been<br/>brought up last spring when it wasn&apos;t sitting in here rotting for months.<br/>Picking this post apart point by point, given the shape of it, I would<br/>consider a personal attack on my not being able to organize and communicate<br/>effectively.  That&apos;s if you&apos;re feeling defensive.</p><p>Otherwise there&apos;s really no need to apologize for anything.</p><p>Hey now that I think of it, this is why I didn&apos;t do anything for 22 day.  I<br/>get the feeling I&apos;m not allowed to use 22 because it&apos;s &quot;your thing&quot;.  Having<br/>used the term enough lately, this is one of those hyper alpha wave<br/>cognitions that lodges in my logic process.</p><p>Not everyone is conscious of 100 percent of their own behavior.  Story of my<br/>life.  Responsibility is just a matter of accountability with an offering of<br/>amends.  But again, there you go again, again.  SELF REPRIMAND???  Paul<br/>speaks, Paul orders, Paul makes mistake, Paul sends Paul away into a<br/>timeout.</p><p>Instead of just running away why don&apos;t you stick around and just try to<br/>learn how to keep that balance between truth and respect?  It&apos;s hard,<br/>BELIEVE me I know.  What&apos;s even harder is participation.  That&apos;s a very<br/>serious word.  There are a lot of things people do, opinions held, macro<br/>activities and attitudes, rehearsed responses, to keep from putting their<br/>own guts on the line.  And why?  Because again, in the quest for knowledge,<br/>some people get hurt inadvertently.</p><p>As for the post from last May, that was included as a sort of token insight<br/>into why I didn&apos;t get *completely* bent out of shape from you pushing me<br/>around last year.  Really, I thought, who is this guy and where does he get<br/>off breaking up all these lists and ORDERING people not to post so much<br/>because he has to read the group at work?!?!?  In between thinking... &quot;hey<br/>why don&apos;t YOU get up to speed and YOU invest in a better computer system if<br/>YOU want to participate in this PUBLIC FORUM...&quot; I thought... This just<br/>doesn&apos;t really seem like that same 22 guitarist I met November 2000.</p><p>Just so you know, for what it&apos;s worth, just to recast myself in not so much<br/>my own compartmentalization, but my own perspective(s):  I have a lot of<br/>personal and interpersonal problems, some from circumstances beyond my<br/>control and some just the same as anyone else&apos;s, that altogether make it<br/>very difficult for me at times to understand what&apos;s going on around me.<br/>I&apos;ve done a lot of work on it and in the last few years I&apos;ve made a lot of<br/>progress.  I&apos;m living on a lot of borrowed time and I&apos;m starting my life<br/>over after two near fatal stress related heart attacks and other factors I<br/>don&apos;t need to get into, &quot;again&quot; or &quot;here&quot;.  I don&apos;t expect to be coddled for<br/>the diversity of certain elements of my plight.  But outside of the<br/>occasional nervous facetiousness I pretty much have to be told to knock off,<br/>I&apos;d like to have at least the respect I&apos;m due for the amount of effort I<br/>HAVE exerted in my work.</p><p>There are times when I wish I was in a wheelchair or I was retarded so<br/>people could IMMEDIATELY see there&apos;s something majorly wrong with me.  I<br/>don&apos;t expect anyone to screech to a halt for me, but in the process of<br/>feeling like I&apos;m being passed at double speed, that&apos;s when *I* withdraw and<br/>excuse myself.  Not so much the &quot;self-reprimanding&quot; you said, with me it&apos;s a<br/>lot more self-destructive.  My lack of esteem comes from literally and<br/>precisely the first derivative of my progress curve with respect to time.<br/>After 6 months of Tiger Schulmann&apos;s Karate, losing over 30 pounds and seven<br/>inches off my waist, I feel like I&apos;m doing nothing despite everyone EVERY<br/>DAY coming up to me and telling me how much better I look AND how much<br/>better I&apos;m doing, why, because I&apos;M NOT DOING MUCH MORE TODAY THAN<br/>YESTERDAY!!!  And the same has ALWAYS been true with me, microtonally etc.</p><p>Which could maybe bring you and me down to a one-time non-recurring<br/>exchange:</p><p>DO YOU have some kind of problem with me?<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>The closer you and I get to one-to-one exchange, the more you really seem<br/>not to.  The closer you and I get to a public space, well, frankly (!?) I<br/>start feeling like I&apos;m being humoured while we&apos;re all waiting for someone to<br/>find my name on your invitation list.  The sole exception being, the fact<br/>that you mentioned me in passing a few weeks ago which ironically enough<br/>brought me BACK to posting frequently.</p><p>I&apos;ll tell you one thing, Paul.  If you are AT ALL jealous about ANYTHING in<br/>my lack of formal education that I might be able to do that you can&apos;t, I&apos;m<br/>telling you right now YOU DO NOT want to know what I had to go through to<br/>get where I am mathematically, musically, psychologically or anywhere<br/>between those.  It was NOT something I think I would have chosen and it&apos;s<br/>MUCH MORE a function of damage control than any kind of gift or talent.<br/>This is why I get so passionate in such a pre-repressed manner.</p><p>As a final taper, in lieu of the fact that all people, when overwhelmed,<br/>tend to exaggerate their pain, just let me assure you I&apos;m really not trying<br/>to rip you a new one here.  If anything, I should have found a way to talk<br/>to you sooner about how you made me feel before it got to such an elastic<br/>testiness.  I WANT YOU to start focusing more on functionality, sentiment<br/>and productivity.  See if those elements don&apos;t give you more perspective.</p><p>Yeah we love you too Paul.  Don&apos;t be so snooty.</p><p>Tomorrow I&apos;m going to try to write something retroactive for 22 day.  And<br/>that&apos;s what it took for me to be able to say this.</p><p>end</p></div>
