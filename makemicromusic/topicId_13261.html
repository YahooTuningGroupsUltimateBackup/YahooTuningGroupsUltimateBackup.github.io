In my remaining reviews, I&apos;ll try to follow Dan&apos;s suggested<br/>groupings, apologizing in advance for any misunderstandings that might<br/>arise, and warmly inviting correction.</p><p>-------------------<br/>3. Ballad in 14-edo<br/>-------------------</p><p>For me, this piece has a kind of &quot;consonant pantonal&quot; quality or the<br/>like in at least some sections, with lots of interesting counterpoint.<br/>An interesting question is to what degree a distinctive &quot;14-ness&quot; is<br/>involved, as opposed (or maybe better simply orthogonal) to Dan&apos;s<br/>method of above all seeking to make compelling _music_ in any tuning<br/>he&apos;s using.</p><p>Having explored 14-edo a bit, I can say that the tuning indeed invites<br/>many different approaches: one could treat it as two chains of 7-EDO<br/>(a rough or sometimes rather close approximation of some Asian and<br/>African tuning systems), or as a set of classic Gothic European<br/>cadences curiously taking place in a nondiatonic environment. Dan has<br/>his own approach -- I&apos;m not sure if &quot;pantonalism&quot; is the right word --<br/>to 14-edo which fits in nicely with his other pieces in this set.</p><p>The use of pitched percussion is typical of the set, giving it a<br/>melodious and often &quot;mysterious&quot; quality while enhancing the timbral<br/>contrasts of the counterpoint, and Dan makes this resource work very<br/>nicely in 14-edo.</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>4. Homage to Charles Ives in 11-edo<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>One traditional view of 11-edo is as an ideal tuning for very<br/>&quot;dissonant&quot; music in an atonal or pantonal style (without the<br/>artificial strategies required in 12-edo to obtain &quot;pantonalism&quot;),<br/>while another perspective focuses on the concordant qualities of<br/>11-edo intervals when &quot;Setharianized&quot; by adjusting partials in<br/>electronic timbres.</p><p>Dan&apos;s approach in this tribute to Charles Ives -- and more broadly, I<br/>might say, to Americana and the diverse roots of these currents --<br/>takes it&apos;s own view, with what I might call a &quot;jazzy&quot; flavor. The<br/>opening theme has energy, and some of the melody seems to have a<br/>&quot;klezmer-like&quot; flavor, evoking the kind of Eastern European mystical<br/>Jewish sound that has had an impact on the other side of the Atlantic<br/>also.</p><p>Again, at least it seems to me, we have more of a musical message<br/>filtered through a given tuning rather than a tuning in search of a<br/>musical message.</p><p>--------------------<br/>5. Scherzo in 13-edo<br/>--------------------</p><p>One classic use of the term _Scherzo_ occurs in the _Scherzi musicali_<br/>of Claudio Monteverdi, of which next year will mark the 400th<br/>anniversary of the first volume&apos;s release in 1607: these are pleasant<br/>songs for two voices above a continuo accompaniment (often a bass<br/>instrument plus one capable of filling in complete harmonies, for<br/>example bass viol plus harpsichord or lute), or sometimes (in the<br/>second volume published around 1632, if I&apos;m correct) a solo voice plus<br/>continuo.</p><p>Dan&apos;s _Scherzo in 13-edo_ is a bit different, with a very jazzy<br/>opening and a development that, like his 11-edo piece in this set, can<br/>sound &quot;klezmer-ish.&quot; The overall effect, I would say, is that of a<br/>jazz ensemble -- another angle on the overall theme of this<br/>collection.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>6. Largo combining 20-, 19-, and 12-EDO<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>This piece seems distinctly in a &quot;20th-century classical&quot; vein, with<br/>an artful use of intervals and contrasts. The opening reminds me of a<br/>typical European gambit around 1600 with an opening &quot;chromatic&quot; figure<br/>-- here meaning not the chromatic tetrachord of ancient Greece<br/>(although that was often a 16th-century inspiration), but a figure<br/>alternating small and large semitones on a meantone keyboard, for<br/>example (e.g. A-G#-G-F#-F). Dan seems to have taken this convention<br/>and transplanted it to a 20th-21st century counterpoint.</p><p>One the most impressive effects is a rather lean and yet immense<br/>texture around 1:30 and again around 4:00 into the piece, maybe<br/>involving vertical sevenths.</p><p>Instead of attempting to sort out the elements of the three equal<br/>tunings combined in this piece, I find my response is to abandon<br/>myself to the total effect.</p><p>This is a modern masterpiece of texture, layering, melodic interweave,<br/>and contrapuntal contrast, and an example of how enlarged intonational<br/>resources can enrich a worthy genre.</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>7. Piano piece in NON-just/octave/equal tuning<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>Opening with a rhythmic and melodic motive that seems a germ for<br/>variations, this piece is, if I&apos;m reading a list correctly, also<br/>identified in its mp3 file name as an &quot;atonal piano&quot; setting.</p><p>There are bursts of energy, alternating with a kind of undercurrent a<br/>bit like the Milky Way as seen with the naked eye somewhere on the<br/>edge of urban civilization. Jazz-like riffs break through to give<br/>drive and direction, while the undercurrent intrigues.</p><p>One challenge for me with this piece is to find the best volume to<br/>hear more of the undercurrents while keeping the louder parts<br/>reasonably comfortable. This is more a comment on my ears, and<br/>possibly on the nature of the pianoforte as an instrument whose very<br/>name announces dynamic contrasts as a major theme, than on the<br/>specifics of Dan&apos;s style -- but he does use these dynamics as part of<br/>his jazzy &quot;atonal&quot; statement.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=13269 href="#13269">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2006 1:54:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i don&apos;t really have time to respond as i&apos;d like, but i just wanted to<br/>take a second to thank margo.

Also. along with this<br/>&gt; counterpoint, there was often a mood of abruptly changing<br/>&gt; and disconnected textures -- very powerful to a receptive<br/>&gt; listener.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is maybe especially the elements of texture and<br/>&gt; counterpoint in Dan&apos;s music that might suggest a certain<br/>&gt; association with &quot;pantonalism.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, an interesting aspect of Dan&apos;s 14-EDO piece I<br/>&gt; discussed, for example, is that he isn&apos;t in the situation of<br/>&gt; striving to use 12-EDO without repeating the patterns of<br/>&gt; earlier music which &quot;pantonalism&quot; seeks ot avoid -- and<br/>&gt; thus, I&apos;d say, can be musically &quot;gentler&quot; in doing something<br/>&gt; new. I&apos;m not sure if Dan might not want to correct or revise<br/>&gt; this analysis, or how much it&apos;s influenced by my own emotion<br/>&gt; reaction to the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A caution, which applies to my writing as well as that of<br/>&gt; other people, is that often a description of a piece as<br/>&gt; &quot;pantonal&quot; might mean something like this: &quot;What is<br/>&gt; happening doesn&apos;t fit any structural model with which I&apos;m<br/>&gt; familiar, so I tend to hear each or any note as potentially<br/>&gt; an equal center.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I&apos;m speaking to certain musical associations which<br/>&gt; Dan&apos;s music suggests to me, rather than to his composerly<br/>&gt; intent or design, to which he can best speak.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you again for the question, which might help me to<br/>&gt; appreciate more fully his pieces which I have yet to<br/>&gt; review.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a very quick answer, but I hope that at least it can<br/>&gt; help by inviting more dialogue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peace and love,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
