Actually, I think it&apos;s one of my stronger works...<br/>certainly one of the most microtonal, by definition!</p><p>It&apos;s performed here by the incomparable Lydia Kavina, who took New<br/>York by storm with FIVE consecutive New York Times reviews on her<br/>last visit here two summers ago.  She is the niece of Leon Theremin<br/>himself.</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/573/573549.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/573/573549.html</a></p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
