The bass theme itself as well as some of the<br/>motives in the upper parts seem to create a kind of 21st-century<br/>genre, with traditional or &quot;folk&quot; subtexts maybe at least as much<br/>inferred by me as implied by the music to anyone else (an interesting<br/>point on which to compare notes). Possibly the pentatonic flavor of<br/>some of the material made me recall Copeland, and also some popular<br/>and film music from my childhood; at the same time, these &quot;familiar&quot;<br/>elements are entwined in a polyphonic web rather like the popular<br/>chorale tunes of Bach&apos;s time, say.</p><p>I enjoyed the portions in quartal/quintal harmony, which your setting<br/>shows can be very pleasing in meantone as well as a tuning such as<br/>12n-EDO with fifths closer to a pure 3:2, or for that matter one such<br/>as 22-EDO where a stack of three fourths, for example, approach a 7:3<br/>minor tenth.</p><p>This is a quite different mode than your &quot;Juggler,&quot; more relaxed and<br/>discoursive, one might say, but the artful juggling or interweaving of<br/>styles is much in evidence.</p><p>I&apos;d call it a delightful 21st-century ground bass piece, and a fine<br/>example of how to look at a traditional form from a new angle.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;d love to invite any comments you might have as the<br/>composer, for example how your approached the form, but I&apos;d call the<br/>result both &quot;organistic&quot; and engaging.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15332 href="#15332">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2006 8:49:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d call it a delightful 21st-century ground bass piece, and a fine<br/>&gt; example of how to look at a traditional form from a new angle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, I&apos;d love to invite any comments you might have as the<br/>&gt; composer, for example how your approached the form, but I&apos;d call the<br/>&gt; result both &quot;organistic&quot; and engaging.</p><p>Thanks Margo...I don&apos;t remember much of my moment by moment thinking<br/>as I wrote this--I wrote in in 1997...but I can remember that I<br/>thought of the melodic fragments as sort of &apos;blocks&apos; that I could move<br/>in space...it was a very contructivist appraoch for lack of a better<br/>word. Might have had something to do with using a sequencer and<br/>cut/paste functions in a very interactive improvisation way...think of<br/>a musical version of &apos;playing with blocks&apos;.</p><p>This piece is a good example of an obsession of mine--hybrid<br/>algorithmic and human composition. Purely algorithmic music tends to<br/>eventually become dull to me, yet sometimes, an unpredictible<br/>transcendence of one&apos;s own stylistic habits is nice, and algorithms<br/>fit the bill nicely. Algorithms, whether using formulas, chaotic<br/>feedback, randomness, etc., can be suggestive of shapes that might not<br/>exist if it were left to humans alone to dream up. I think of it as a<br/>synergetic alloy when you can take a random melody and hack at it<br/>until you like it...coming from a given starting place that one<br/>doesn&apos;t decide leads to discoveries one doesn&apos;t expect, and hopefully<br/>the listener experiences that sense of discovery as well.</p><p>I think I read somewhere that Japanese Zen ink artists sometimes<br/>worked with random ink blots as a starting point, and then would a la<br/>&apos;Rorschach test&apos; find their subject in this way. The idea is very<br/>similar, and when I read this I found it to be a very exciting and<br/>liberating idea. It sort of allows a sense of play to come back into<br/>the game which might otherwise have too much formalism. Or one can<br/>look at it as a kind of formalism in itself, but one I find more<br/>playful, I guess.</p><p>-A.</p></div>
