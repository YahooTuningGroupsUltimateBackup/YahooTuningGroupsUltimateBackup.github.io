I stopped participating<br/>in the lists because I didn&apos;t feel I had much to offer and I wasn&apos;t<br/>interested in the mathematical details coming thru on a daily basis.<br/>Well, I&apos;m still not interested in the math, but this time I do have<br/>something to offer.  I have a digital ANS synthesizer!</p><p>What I&apos;d like to do is have people start posting drawings of what<br/>they&apos;d like to hear on the ANS synth so I can trace them into the<br/>program and post back the audio output.  The drawings can be in any<br/>format (jpg, bmp, gif, etc...) and don&apos;t have to be super technical<br/>(just enough so I can trace it into the program accurately) and I&apos;ll<br/>post the audio back in whichever format you like that I can accomodate<br/>(return time depending on how busy I am).</p><p>The following details of how to setup the drawings assume you know<br/>what the ANS synth is, so start with<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANS_synthesizer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANS_synthesizer</a> then read on.</p><p>Since I&apos;m going to be, for the most part, tracing the drawings into<br/>the program, I need to know how the drawing lines up in the frequency<br/>and time domains.  You could just scribble in MS-Paint, for example,<br/>and write down the desired frequency and time ranges, or, on the other<br/>extreme, you could provide as much detail as you like and make it look<br/>like a blueprint.  The more accurate the drawing, the more accurately<br/>I&apos;ll be able to input it.  In a nutshell, make the drawings look like<br/>what you would etch onto the ANS synth&apos;s glass plates or give me<br/>numbers to work with when inputting.</p><p>Some numbers for you...<br/>The frequency range is measured in cents, with 6000 cents arbitrarily<br/>designated to the same frequency as &quot;Middle C&quot; on the piano.  The<br/>entire frequency domain ranges from 0 to 12,700 cents.  Anything<br/>higher or lower than that will be clipped to that range (hopefully you<br/>will be considerate and not even come close to those ranges, ouch).</p><p>While the program is similar to the ANS synth, there is a big<br/>difference in that there is no 720 note restriction.  The total number<br/>of notes in the program (iirc) is equal to the number of unique<br/>fractions there are in a IEEE double float between the numbers of 0<br/>and 12,700.  A.k.a. ALOT!</p><p>I&apos;ll stop here to field questions but feel free to post drawings now<br/>if you get the gist of it.  The more the merrier!<br/>&lt;/longversion&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=15647 href="#15647">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2007 11:34:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Andy,</p><p>I still have an early AutoCAD-based version of yours here.
