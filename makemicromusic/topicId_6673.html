I&apos;m to writing open ended pieces<br/>that have an exotic melody and then turn into<br/>mayhem or minimalism. I doubt we could play<br/>someplace as commercial as Cornelia, I&apos;m aiming for Tonic<br/>or someplace east of Manhattan.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
