Like<br/>other trackers, you can use the qwerty keyboard like a piano keyboard,<br/>though with scales greater than 12 notes per octave, it will only map<br/>the first 12 keys to the first 12 scale degrees of that scale.  You<br/>can still use shortcuts to raise/lower by scale degree or type in<br/>directly, so entering data is still pretty quick.</p><p>You may want to give it a try to see what you like and don&apos;t like<br/>about the implementation if you go and embark on implementing the<br/>Microtonal Tracker you have in mind.</p><p>Cheers!<br/>steven</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Johnson&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I started experimenting with a (Amiga MOD style) tracker called &apos;Aldrin&apos;<br/>&gt; last night.
