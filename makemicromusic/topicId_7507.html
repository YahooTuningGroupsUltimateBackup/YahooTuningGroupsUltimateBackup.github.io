The more traditional music from like islands used such devices in there own highly unusual tunings. Even ancient hawaiian music used some of the strangest scales i have heard. Samoa has similar music to this. and the solomon islands also has this missionary like style. I believed they used it in the film the thin blue line? or red line? This is an older recording though that has been reissued on a newer label, in fact there were two that came out maybe 10 years ago. this is the first and even then it got some noticed..<br/>   There is an Albanian group called Tirana which has two CDs out. It is one of the rare times you have &quot;professional&quot; quality singers singing traditional music, this along the lines of maybe Georgian being the closest</p><p>Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt;thats pretty amazing- i bet a missionary left a windup record player there<br/>&gt;decades ago and they are imitating the sound of the hymn records as the<br/>&gt;player wound down. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dante<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;&gt;From: Prent Rodgers [mailto:prentrodgers@...]<br/>&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, September 16, 2004 9:34 AM<br/>&gt;&gt;To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;Subject: [MMM] NPR goes microtonal<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Gang,<br/>&gt;&gt;Last night on the way home I heard some amazing vocal music on NPR&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;All Things Considered.
