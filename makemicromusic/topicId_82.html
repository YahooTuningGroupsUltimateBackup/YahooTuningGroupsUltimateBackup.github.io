The suggestion that the ideas are<br/>first &quot;in the head&quot; is a significant one.  Basically, this is the way<br/>*I* work all the time... I virtually *always* HEAR something before I<br/>write it down or try to find the pitches to match it.</p><p>So, in that sense, I don&apos;t &quot;improvise&quot; if, &quot;improvise&quot; means just<br/>trying out different things and settling on something acceptable.<br/>However, I doubt very seriously that fine improvisers work that way,<br/>either.  Most probably they *also* are striving to find something<br/>that is ALREADY in their heads... and use their muscular-auditory<br/>coordination and senses to realize that aim...</p><p>So how does this process differ in microtonality from 12-tET? Well,<br/>of course, I have had VASTLY more experience in 12-tET, having<br/>composed *well* over 10 hours of music in that tuning.</p><p>So how is this process working in microtonality?  Well, in this case,<br/>I believe I absorb the scale as a kind of &quot;template&quot; and STILL try to<br/>find pitches I am initially hearing *in my head* matching these<br/>pitches to the pitches of the scale.</p><p>For this reason, I believe my basic &quot;style&quot; of which I seriously<br/>believe I have one, after many years of composing, is for all<br/>practical purposes THE SAME in 12-tET AND in microtonality.</p><p>It&apos;s just that I have a new, &quot;refreshing&quot; (for *me* at least)<br/>template of pitches that remains in my mind after working with a<br/>scale a bit.</p><p>Then, I try to &quot;find&quot; the pitches I need for my piece from this range<br/>of possibilities.  Since the pitches are xenharmonic and,<br/>therefore, &quot;fresh&quot; to me, the compositional experience at the moment<br/>is more interesting and enjoyable that it would be in 12-tET.</p><p>And, generally speaking, when *I* am getting more out of my<br/>composing, an audience, conceivably, will as well!</p><p>__________ _______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=83 href="#83">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2001 5:02:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, in that sense, I don&apos;t &quot;improvise&quot; if, &quot;improvise&quot; means just<br/>&gt; trying out different things and settling on something acceptable.<br/>&gt; However, I doubt very seriously that fine improvisers work that<br/>way,<br/>&gt; either.

Are you saying that you sort of hear<br/>the &quot;contour&quot; of the melody in your head, and then try to find<br/>its &quot;best fit&quot; within the scale that you have tuned up on your<br/>keyboard? I&apos;d like to hear more about this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For this reason, I believe my basic &quot;style&quot; of which I seriously<br/>&gt; believe I have one, after many years of composing, is for all<br/>&gt; practical purposes THE SAME in 12-tET AND in microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just that I have a new, &quot;refreshing&quot; (for *me* at least)<br/>&gt; template of pitches that remains in my mind after working with a<br/>&gt; scale a bit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, I try to &quot;find&quot; the pitches I need for my piece from this<br/>range<br/>&gt; of possibilities.

But this is far from true<br/>for a scale like Blackjack . . . of course, if you kept adding more<br/>and more new pitches accordingly, you&apos;d end up with all of 72-tET,<br/>which is of course &quot;closed&quot; like 12-tET . . . perhaps a reason to<br/>think about getting a 72-tET generalized keyboard eventually . . .</p></div><h3><a id=84 href="#84">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>7/26/2001 5:52:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_82.html#83">/makemicromusic/topicId_82.html#83</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So how does this process differ in microtonality from 12-tET?<br/>Well, of course, I have had VASTLY more experience in 12-tET, having<br/>&gt; &gt; composed *well* over 10 hours of music in that tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So how is this process working in microtonality?

I&apos;d like to hear more about this.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Yes, it seems as though that&apos;s what&apos;s going on.  However, I believe I<br/>am cognizant of the difference between the scale I&apos;m working on and<br/>12-tET... so it&apos;s not just a matter of &quot;squeezing&quot; 12-tET melodies<br/>and patterns onto another scale.  I think I&apos;m more involved in the<br/>xenharmonics than that!  For example, I&apos;ve become *very* conscious of<br/>the smaller intervals (33 cents) in blackjack, and know that many<br/>pitches can be &quot;inflected&quot; slightly...  That informs my melodic<br/>construction, since I like to use that on occasion.</p><p>HOWEVER, I have also been working &quot;pre-compositionally&quot; as I have<br/>mentioned... finding harmonies through common-tone movement on the<br/>lattice.  BUT, the important factor is that I *don&apos;t use* every<br/>harmony I stumble upon.  I select them, and also select the voice<br/>leading according to the same general principles I outline above...<br/>i.e. I have to think they&apos;re &quot;good,&quot; meaning they have some kind of<br/>syntax that relates to my musical experience and language...</p><p>Frankly, I don&apos;t want to seem too &quot;dogmatic&quot; about any of this.  I<br/>suppose there are some times that I try things out on the keyboard<br/>too and use the &quot;better&quot; of them.  But, generally speaking, I really<br/>believe I am mostly &quot;looking for&quot; something... and finding it through<br/>the pitches.  It&apos;s a bit like the parable of the sculptor who<br/>actually &quot;sees&quot; the form inside the stone before he starts carving...</p><p>I think maybe I &quot;try things out&quot; more in the ORCHESTRATIONAL process<br/>than in something like melodic or harmonic construction.  In other<br/>words, I will copy a line from my sequencer onto another line and<br/>listen to the results.  If I&apos;m not satisfied, I will transfer that to<br/>another voice, change the balance of the volume, etc., etc.  There is<br/>some chancy &quot;trying out&quot; in some of that.  But of course, in my music<br/>anyway, it&apos;s all subject to careful selection... (or rejection!)</p><p>&gt; &gt; For this reason, I believe my basic &quot;style&quot; of which I seriously<br/>&gt; &gt; believe I have one, after many years of composing, is for all<br/>&gt; &gt; practical purposes THE SAME in 12-tET AND in microtonality.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s just that I have a new, &quot;refreshing&quot; (for *me* at least)<br/>&gt; &gt; template of pitches that remains in my mind after working with a<br/>&gt; &gt; scale a bit.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then, I try to &quot;find&quot; the pitches I need for my piece from this<br/>&gt; range of possibilities.  Since the pitches are xenharmonic and,<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore, &quot;fresh&quot; to me, the compositional experience at the<br/>&gt; moment is more interesting and enjoyable that it would be in 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting . . . now for the Blackjack scale, which you&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; working with lately . . . let&apos;s say you&apos;ve worked with the scale<br/>for a while, and it remains in your mind. Then, when you&apos;re hearing<br/>&gt; melodies in your head based on this pattern in your mind, do you<br/>ever hear a pitch that is _not_ present on the keyboard?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Quite frankly, I don&apos;t believe I have *yet* Paul...</p><p>&gt; Answer that before you read the rest of this message.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would expect this to happen sometimes with an improper scale like<br/>&gt; Blackjack, while in 12-tET, it might _never_ happen because all the<br/>&gt; intervals in the scale (and thus in your mental &quot;template&quot; or<br/>&gt; whatever), when transposed to other starting pitches, lead to<br/>ending pitches which are always in the same scale. But this is far<br/>from true for a scale like Blackjack . . .</p><p>I&apos;ll be on the &quot;lookout&quot; for that... So far I haven&apos;t noticed it...<br/>That&apos;s pretty interesting, actually...</p><p>of course, if you kept adding more<br/>&gt; and more new pitches accordingly, you&apos;d end up with all of 72-tET,<br/>&gt; which is of course &quot;closed&quot; like 12-tET . . . perhaps a reason to<br/>&gt; think about getting a 72-tET generalized keyboard eventually . . .</p><p>Well MAYBE, but it&apos;s *so* cumbersome!  I would rather sacrifice a few<br/>pitches than have a 10 foot long keyboard :)  (or, seriously,<br/>something rather &quot;foreign&quot; for me...)</p><p>__________ ___________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
