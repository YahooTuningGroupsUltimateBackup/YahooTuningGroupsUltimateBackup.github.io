Counterpoint is a wide enough net, in my book. And<br/>good counterpoint (what do you want me to say &apos;interesting confluence of<br/>lines&apos;???) is not entirely the sole domain of J.S. Bach and neo-Bach-isms,<br/>either. I never thought I&apos;d agree with Michael about much, but I will say<br/>here: as creative composers and listeners, let&apos;s learn from, but also move<br/>on from Bach, okay? So I refuse to not use the word &quot;counterpoint&quot; just<br/>because conservative listeners insist that it means inverted canons at the<br/>12th or 5-part fugues with augmentation.</p><p>And, Gene---I think it&apos;s fair to say your tastes aren&apos;t all that progressive<br/>either, at least what I know of them. That I can recall, you&apos;ve never seemed<br/>to care much for anything that wasn&apos;t neo-common practice, or perhaps in the<br/>mold of Bartok/Prokofieff and such, of one sort or another. So, yeah, maybe<br/>you wouldn&apos;t get this in a million years. But since you have a nascent<br/>interest, it seems, in Csound and problems of synthesis, maybe you can at<br/>least appreciate someone&apos;s work on that level, which I think shows here<br/>quite well.</p><p>I&apos;d happily listen to anything in this general direction of electronic<br/>composition that anyone thought was *better* than this....haven&apos;t heard it<br/>yet, expect maybe from someone like Squarepusher, and it definitely hasn&apos;t<br/>been approached, let alone surpassed, in these tuning list parts, from what<br/>I&apos;ve heard.

Mahler for instance wrote<br/>highly detailed expressive indications, but still claimed that 90% of what<br/>made his music what it was was *not* in the score!!! Think about that!!!</p><p>I had a vivid experience of seeing my wife &quot;not get&quot; Sibelius 2 under<br/>Esa-Pekka Salonen&apos;s rather dull and mediocre interpretation, but really get<br/>excited by an old Sir John Barbirolli recording of the same piece (which<br/>also put to lie the idea that a composer&apos;s countrymen are always their best<br/>interpreters)....makes one realize *vividly* how important the actual<br/>interpretation that bring these pieces to life is in forming an emotional<br/>bond w/the piece. In my book, the experiences of two different recordings or<br/>interpretations of the &quot;same&quot; piece may be so different in what gets<br/>communicated that one might go so far as saying they aren&apos;t actually the<br/>same piece *in actuality*...meaning, we know and like or dislike a piece<br/>always based on the sonic actuality.</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=27596 href="#27596">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2011 9:19:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Wed, Apr 6, 2011 at 3:24 AM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt;wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Apr 5, 2011 at 8:24 PM, Daniel Forr&Atilde;Âƒ&Acirc;&sup3; &lt;dan.for@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That means there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something more in music than &quot;just&quot; the sound, timbre...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Music by definition is sound, and meaning is in the ears of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; listener, so  this can&apos;t be true.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think horses, for example, hear music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was assuming Gene was a human being, not a horse!</p><p>??
