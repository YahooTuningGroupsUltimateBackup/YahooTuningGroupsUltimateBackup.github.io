This is avoided using pitch bends which<br/>&gt; add a 1 ms delay to the notes but do so consistently,<br/>&gt; not destroying the groove like erratically interspersed<br/>&gt; tables do.</p><p>We should be asking for real time single note tuning changes as per the<br/>MIDI Tuning Standard.

Of course you don&apos;t want to perform in public with<br/>an unreliable, crash prone PC.  So use a reliable PC instead.  Get a good<br/>box from a reputable supplier, don&apos;t add any hardware beyond what you need<br/>to handle the MIDI and don&apos;t add any software beyond the well written and<br/>well tested package you need to do the processing.  If you&apos;re really<br/>paranoid, put two of them in a rack with a MIDI merge to get redundancy.<br/>If you think a hardware synthesizer that allows arbitrary code to execute<br/>on it will be magically crash proof you&apos;re living in a fantasy world.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>justintonation &#x3C;JUSTINTONATION@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2002 7:18:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;X.

If anyone is earnestly interested<br/>in building microtonal synthesizers with advanced tuning features then<br/>there are a couple of options:</p><p>1) Hardware synthesizer. Chameleon by Soundart:<br/><a href="http://www.soundart-hot.com/index.htm">http://www.soundart-hot.com/index.htm</a>.  Chameleon is an open development<br/>platform in a 1U rack form factor, containing a 100 MHz Motorola<br/>DSP56303 24 bit DSP for audio processing and a Motorola Coldfire<br/>MCF5206e 32 bit microcontroller for MIDI and user interface support. You<br/>can roll your own synthesizer in this box.</p><p>2) Software synthesizer. Reaktor by Native Instruments:<br/><a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?home_us">http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?home_us</a>. Using the event<br/>tables in Reaktor and advanced macro programming I believe it is<br/>possible to support almost any tuning requirement.  We would have to<br/>build a &quot;microtuning engine&quot; that could be plugged in to synthesizer<br/>instruments. We would also want to build a &quot;standard library&quot; of<br/>microtunable instruments as the MIDI to microtonal pitch control<br/>interface will be embedded inside instruments. It can require extensive<br/>modifications to add this support to existing instruments.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p></div><h3>John Loffink &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2002 3:35:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; We should be asking for real time single note tuning changes as per<br/>the<br/>&gt; MIDI Tuning Standard.
