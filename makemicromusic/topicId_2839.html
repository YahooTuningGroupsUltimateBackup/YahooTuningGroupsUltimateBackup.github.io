It seems like most of this group is also<br/>connected to the ATL too, so you all probably saw my bio.  If not,<br/>you can access it at</p><p>     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36801">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/36801</a></p><p>     I also poked my nose in on the Tuning-Math List and saw little<br/>that inspired me to look further.  Don&apos;t get me wrong here, I love<br/>math and music and I use them together a lot.  I guess I just need to<br/>ground out the head stuff with heart and hands as well.  So this<br/>group seems to be the right place for me.</p><p>     See y&apos;all around,</p><p>     Stephen Golovnin  (SVG)</p></div>
