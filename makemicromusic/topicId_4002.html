It&apos;s really easy and you don&apos;t need to know anything<br/>about CSound to do it - I&apos;ve done it, and I haven&apos;t learnt CSound yet.</p><p>You just run Winsound, load both the files, specify the output<br/>file and device to use, and click a render button and that&apos;s it. There&apos;s<br/>nothing to it.</p><p>Also winsound is really easy to install, has a regular type<br/>installer and you just run that and it is installed, complete with CSound too.</p><p>If you install Cecilia, it automatically installs winsound too as part of<br/>the installation.</p><p>Then I suppose you will be wanting to edit the .orc file, but that will<br/>let you at least hear it which is a start.</p><p>When I do the programming for it I&apos;ll probably just do it manual in hand,<br/>after a bit of initial learning about how CSound works, don&apos;t expect<br/>I&apos;ll learn all those op codes and things :-).</p><p>Nice thing is once you&apos;ve programmed something, the program then itself<br/>&quot;knows&quot; how to do it long after you&apos;ve forgotten yourself.</p><p>Well if it is open source, then anyone can add conversions into other formats<br/>such as the SCALA .seq file. There I expect the thing is all the notations that<br/>SCALA supports, all would need to be added in for the conversions<br/>if you want to render it in any of the notations. Plus other<br/>statements there too.</p><p>But maybe I can make one way of doing that, particular choice of notation<br/>system and things, by way of being an example that could be added to later<br/>with other notation systems, to get it started...</p><p>Also think about having those notation systems in the original format<br/>too. The SCALA .seq format is particularly designed to help with<br/>making midi files. Maybe one can borrow some elements of it<br/>for the idea of a kind of general microtonal sequencer interchange<br/>format.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2002 8:10:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Gene<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once you&apos;ve got an orc and sco file, you just need to open them in Winsound<br/>&gt; and render them there.
