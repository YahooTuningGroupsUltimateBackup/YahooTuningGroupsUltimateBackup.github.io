I own a yamaha psr-530 which is one the XG<br/>ones. I set it up for the XG series and I have the<br/>midi connected and functioning, I hit send and nothing<br/>happens :( I found today that one can adjust tuning on<br/>the synth via + or - 64 cents from the 12-tone equal<br/>tempered scale in the box. Is it possible to load a<br/>scale into this, do I need to use FTS instead? I<br/>familiar with midi but have never bothered to learn<br/>patch dumps, sysex or anything like that. Any help<br/>getting this to work is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks, Todd</p><p>__________________________________________________________________</p><p>Gesendet von Yahoo!

I can play midi<br/>files through it no problem. I have it set to the right port on both<br/>scala and megamid. Do I need something like midiyoke to connect<br/>megamid and scala? I will try to see if I can have scala send midi<br/>info to the synth via the chromatic keyboard or something... we&apos;ll see</p><p>todd</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I downloaded megamid just for fun and opened it. Still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;nothing happens.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm, are you sure you&apos;ve set the output device to the<br/>&gt; &gt; midi interface like I said? In Megamid, click on the<br/>&gt; &gt; Setup button to see what it is. Play a music midi<br/>&gt; &gt; file with it, do you hear anything?<br/>&gt; &gt; Then carefully read the documentation, in case you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; forgotten.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Manuel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Friends - If I remember correctly, Megamid has never been able to<br/>see<br/>&gt; my USB midi port.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you wish to flawlessly send your tunings to a synth, and have it<br/>&gt; work properly, create a midi file with Scala using first the &quot;Set<br/>&gt; Synth&quot;, then the &quot;Send/File&quot; command. Import this midi file into<br/>your<br/>&gt; midi sequencer - like Cakewalk Sonar, Cubase, etc - slow the tempo<br/>&gt; down on the sequencer, and play the file to your board. This works<br/>&gt; without fail every time for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L</p></div><h3><a id=3259 href="#3259">ðŸ”—</a>booeyschewy &#x3C;booeyschewy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2002 12:20:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wasn&apos;t actually sending it any sequences per say, I was just trying<br/>to dump a scale from scala.

The TX81Z is a great example of<br/>&gt; this. If you send the midi to fast - which *is* tied to the tempo<br/>of<br/>&gt; the sequencer, then some synths will choke and not be tuned<br/>correctly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try sending the midi slowly - like @ 16 BPM.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L</p></div><h3><a id=3309 href="#3309">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 9:15:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tuesday, June 4, 2002, at 07:50 , <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Re: Re: Help with midi dumps, scala, psr-530<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Todd wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; It is strange the manual allows for other tunings and I have manually<br/>&gt;&gt; entered the ones via adjusting the cent distance from equal for each<br/>&gt;&gt; note, but outside of that it doesn&apos;t say much of anything.
