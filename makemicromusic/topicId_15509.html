I thought I&apos;d pass along notice that Garritan is running a group buy, set to end on 12/21, where the GPO, Jazz/Big Band, and Stradivari (solo strings) sets are on sale. They have already reached the maximum discount, which means you can get GPO for $139 instead of $199, a pretty good bargain. Info thread on their forum:</p><p><a href="http://www.northernsounds.com/forum/showthread.php?t=49704">http://www.northernsounds.com/forum/showthread.php?t=49704</a></p><p>What *really* piqued my interest is that the Kontakt Player that they are bundled in (like so many sample sets these days, Garritan is using a NI Kontakt player to bundle the sounds, with the purpose of protecting the samples - you can&apos;t simply import them into other samplers). But what is of special note is that the player will be at version 2.2, and from what I can tell from the NI website it includes the Scripting Engine.</p><p>Big deal? Well, the SE is what has allowed the full Kontakt sampler to not only utilize alternate tunings, but have multiple tunings that one can switch between. The large caveat is that I don&apos;t have it yet, and nothing is ever carved in stone with software (especially trying to glean Real Hard Info from websites). But I took the plunge, because it is a pretty nice orch sample library at a very reasonable price, and I&apos;m hoping the scripting will work with it. I know that Bill Sethares has posted here about using the SE with Kontakt to good effect, as well as some 3rd party app that can generate scripts from Scala files. My fingers are crossed.</p><p>Anyhow, just thought I&apos;d pass that offer along before it runs out. Caveat emptor.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.
