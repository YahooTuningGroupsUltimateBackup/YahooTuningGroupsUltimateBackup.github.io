That is, as long as individuals are compelled to rent themselves<br/>on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long as their role<br/>in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then there are striking<br/>elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very<br/>limited, if even meaningful.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
