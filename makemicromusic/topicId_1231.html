Tried them on a fair number of timbres<br/>and most work.</p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded them to the files area for anyone to listen to.</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/files/Robert_Walker/13-tet+0_3_6_9_13_to_2_3_6_10_13.mi">/makemicromusic/files/Robert_Walker/13-tet+0_3_6_9_13_to_2_3_6_10_13.mi</a><br/>d</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/files/Robert_Walker/13-tet+0_3_6_9_13_to_4_3_6_12_13.mi">/makemicromusic/files/Robert_Walker/13-tet+0_3_6_9_13_to_4_3_6_12_13.mi</a><br/>d</p><p>Also I can imagine how a resolution to the 0 3 6 9 could be<br/>possible too, as it seems to be a fairly consonant chord<br/>somehow.</p><p>&gt; May I lend you some encouragement here, please.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One issue for me with my cassette was, &quot;This is so tentative, do I<br/>&gt; really want this on a CD.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I&apos;m more and more convinced that getting the music out there is<br/>&gt; important, with disclaimers if necessarily as to this being an<br/>&gt; &quot;improvisation in progress&quot; or whatever.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for the encouragement. I&apos;d like to make a CD for you and anyone<br/>else and will do something about it.</p><p>I&apos;m enjoying your pieces a lot. Look forward to hearing more.</p><p>&gt; May I hope that people who can hear it, which means _lots_ of people<br/>&gt; here, get great enjoyment for your sitar timbre, something really<br/>&gt; interesting for 13-tET, and an example of how experimentation can<br/>&gt; often be the best teacher.</p><p>I&apos;m rather curious actually about why it works, I think possibly<br/>because the sitar has so many higher harmonics, and maybe some of them<br/>go together well in 13-tet chords.</p><p>On your notes about the Organum</p><p>&gt; Here I might add that the 9-step interval of 13-tET at ~830.77 cents,<br/>&gt; is quite close to the Golden Section or Phi at ~833.09 cents, and even<br/>&gt; closer to the ratio 13:21 (~830.25 cents) formed from two of the<br/>&gt; numbers in the famous Fibonacci series (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55...)<br/>&gt; where successive pairs form ratios more and more closely approximating<br/>&gt; Phi.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting. The 0 3 6 9 chord ends at that note. I wonder if one<br/>somehow can hear the golden ratio and key in with its special<br/>qualities.</p><p>Thanks for the notes about the origins of it, and the idea of a<br/>moveable pedal point.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
