Unfortunately most<br/>of the self contained analog style sequencers out there (Doepfer, Future<br/>Retro, etc.) are digitized and therefore quantized.</p><p>Designing a tuning module is more an issue of interface than internal<br/>design. The basic concept is simple, just a high resolution Analog to<br/>Digital converter, lookup table in memory, then Digital to Analog<br/>converter. But the definition of scales cries out for a digital<br/>interface: numeric keys, LED or LCD displays, etc., which can be<br/>expensive on a per module basis. If you have any suggestions along these<br/>lines then I would be happy to discuss them, probably offline.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Alexandros Papadopoulos [mailto:alexmoog@...]<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 21, 2002 4:55 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [MMM] Fully fledged microtonal synthesizer<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since I like the sound and tactile feeling of analog synthesizers ,<br/>&gt; especially modulars , I wonder why no company has produced a tuning<br/>&gt; module .<br/>&gt; I asked many companies if they have such plans and I received mixed<br/>&gt; answers .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you don&apos;t follow closely the synth news , there are currently many<br/>&gt; old and new companies making modulars.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tuning stability is not a problem anymore , since new oscillators are<br/>&gt; very stable.<br/>&gt; Ofcourse they are monophonic , but I prefer it that way because you<br/>can<br/>&gt; be more expressive , and you can always multitrack harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of them , Analogue Systems , has a module that allows you to tune<br/>&gt; every key with a pot but for the 12 notes only.<br/>&gt; The module is called &quot;Scale programmer&quot; when I first saw it I was<br/>&gt; excited until I looked at the specs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for me , I decided to get a new modular with a MIDI interface and<br/>the<br/>&gt; &quot;Continuum fingerboard&quot;<br/>&gt; link :<br/>&gt;   <a href="http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Continuum/Cont.html">http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Continuum/Cont.html</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;alexmoog@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2002 12:26:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The price is 8750$ for the 8 octave sized fingerboard and 4950$ for the<br/>4 octave.<br/>I just saw the prices on the site , and maybe they are old.<br/>I have spoken several times with the maker of the instrument , I will<br/>ask him if the prices have hopefully changed recently.</p><p>On Wednesday, May 22, 2002, at 01:06 AM, Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for me , I decided to get a new modular with a MIDI interface<br/>&gt; &gt; and the &quot;Continuum fingerboard&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; link :<br/>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Continuum/Cont.html">http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Continuum/Cont.html</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very cool!
