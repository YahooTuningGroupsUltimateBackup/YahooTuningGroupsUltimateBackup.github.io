In addition to basic mailing list functionality, all your<br/>mailing list content will be stored and searchable on the web. Unlike other<br/>free mailing list services, Google Groups offers generous storage limits and<br/>only displays relevant text ads (never banners or pop-ups).</p><p> To move your mailing list to Google Groups, create a new group by clicking<br/>&quot;Create a new group&quot; in the menu on the left side of the screen. Complete<br/>step one of the group creation process by naming your group and filling out<br/>the other required information. On step two, add the email addresses of the<br/>people in your group. If you are adding more than 10 members to the group,<br/>click &quot;Invite people in bulk.&quot; This option enables you to invite a large<br/>number of people to join your new group. Copying and pasting and existing<br/>list of email addresses into this form is one easy way of moving large groups<br/>to Google Groups. Click &quot;Invite these people&quot; and invitations to join your<br/>group will be sent out momentarily. &quot;<br/>#############################</p><p>So the point I want to make is this: Yahoo&apos;s search feature *really sucks*.<br/>Yes, it would be easier to stay at Yahoo, but the archive will just get<br/>larger and larger and larger and harder and harder and harder to search.</p><p>For those of you who don&apos;t know how to search on Yahoo, give it a try, and<br/>you&apos;ll see how disgustingly annoying it is. It crawls through only a couple<br/>of hundred messages at a time, and not the entire history of the archive.<br/>This means that in order to find what you&apos;re looking for, you have to have a<br/>rough idea of when it occurred, then look up a message number close to that<br/>date in the archive, and then manually *crawl* through the archive a couple<br/>hundred at a time. If you go the *wrong* direction in time, you&apos;re SOL, If<br/>you don&apos;t know *when* the post occurredm you&apos;re alos SOL.</p><p>Even with my automated script, you&apos;re SOL: Yahoo will deny access for at least<br/>half a day to any IP it determines makes to many &apos;html GET&apos; requests: I know<br/>because when I tested my script, I got booted from yahoogroups for a half a<br/>day. In searching the internet for what happened to me, I found out that<br/>Yahoo&apos;s (unstated) policy is to shut people down for a day, but I&apos;ve heard of<br/>cases being a week or more.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>I&apos;m saying adamantly that we should leave....Google&apos;s interface is cleaner and<br/>less pop-uppey anyway, and esp. if you ever use the web interface, they never<br/>put an advertisement between you and the message you want to see. Plus,<br/>Google&apos;s topics are *threaded*:</p><p>Robert Walker and a couple of others have suggested proprietary solutions. I<br/>will not be involved with that at all. This should be free.....</p><p>In short:</p><p>1) Google is searchable over it&apos;s entire history, unlike the slice based<br/>search of Yahoo.</p><p>2) Google is cleaner.</p><p>3) Google is threaded.</p><p>4) Google don&apos;t ever have banner ads or popups like Yahoo, or those who<br/>occasionally (like I do) use the web interface, for either reading archival<br/>stuff, or for being at remote computers.</p><p>I strongly encourage people to join, if you haven&apos;t already:</p><p><a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/non12comp/">http://groups-beta.google.com/group/non12comp/</a></p><p>and cross post there so we can compare which interface on average gives us<br/>faster delivery.</p><p>Best,<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div>
