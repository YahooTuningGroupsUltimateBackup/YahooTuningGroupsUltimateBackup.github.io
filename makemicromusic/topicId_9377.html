So kudos to Neil who keeps right on at it and has slowly but<br/>surely built a very, very impressive body of microtonal work; as a<br/>micro guitarist, I think he&apos;s second only to Catler in terms of<br/>contributing a body of work to the medium. Up until this new CD,<br/>Acoustic Stick had remained my favorite of Neil&apos;s recordings. On<br/>Stick Man, like Acoustic Stick, there&apos;s a sound and a color and a<br/>pacing that runs through all the cuts, and I like that sense of unity<br/>without a sense of sameness, but Stick Man has a little more bite in<br/>the strange and micro content, and a loose, relaxed feeling that I&apos;m<br/>really liking more and more on repeated listenings. I should also<br/>mention that after The Gate, Haverstick&apos;s recordings started to<br/>develop a real strong aesthetic look as well, packaging,art,etc. And<br/>while this wouldn&apos;t mean a hell of a lot if the music wasn&apos;t<br/>there,it&apos;s part of the overall picture and contributes more than one<br/>might imagine to the overall vibe that a work of art and an artist<br/>gives off,and I just though I should mention that it in that context.<br/>Great work Neil,you should be very proud.</p></div><h3><a id=9379 href="#9379">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2005 8:54:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haverstick&apos;s new CD has been wheeling around in the belly of my CD<br/>&gt; player for a couple of weeks now, and it&apos;s my new favorite of his<br/>&gt; work.

Neil is really developing his voice.
