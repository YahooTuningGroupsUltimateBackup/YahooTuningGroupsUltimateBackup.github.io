This should get latency<br/>down to less than 5 milliseconds.  Most consumer grade audio cards will<br/>exhibit large amounts of latency without ASIO.  Of course, the<br/>application also has to support these speeds.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>microtonal@...</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: George Zelenz [mailto:ploo@...]<br/>Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:38 AM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] VST and DXi Synthesis</p><p>Jacky,<br/>My new card (Mia by echo) is a low latency card, and the Cubase software<br/>keeps yakkin about non/ low latency this and that.
