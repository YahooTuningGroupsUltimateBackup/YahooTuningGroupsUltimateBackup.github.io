Have you ever tried to make a harp?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d like to try my hand at it actually. A little known fact<br/>&gt; about your Brother here, is that I&apos;ve got some pretty good<br/>&gt; carpentry skills, and access to the whole range of<br/>&gt; woodworking tools it would take to make it happen.</p><p>I used to have a fine shop too but gave it all away<br/>before I went overseas to teach.</p><p>&gt; I want to try to grow some gourds this year too for this<br/>&gt; purpose.</p><p>Yes if you want large round gourds, I like the &apos;bushel&apos;<br/>gourd variety. Mine have never gotten to the volume of<br/>an actual bushel I don&apos;t think, but they are still<br/>probably abong the best to use if you want a round<br/>shape.</p><p>If you have trouble finding seeds for them where you<br/>are, I can keep an eye out for them at the feed store<br/>when the seeds start coming in and send you a packet.<br/>The brand I&apos;ve gotten before is actually grown down<br/>near where you live in NC.</p><p>With any gourds or melons, you get better yield if you<br/>do the following:</p><p>* use lots of poop<br/>* plant in hills, 3 plants per hill<br/>* cover with black plastic once a bit established.<br/>Weigh down the plastic with stones or bricks for wind<br/>obviously<br/>* If you want to get the started early, get some peat<br/>pellets to start indoors. Any sort of melon or gourd<br/>started inside needs to be put in a peat pellet or such<br/>totally transplantable container since they will not<br/>tolerate having their roots disturbed as would be if<br/>replanting directly from soil</p><p>Next project I believe will be a xalam, or african<br/>banjar.</p><p>Perhaps we should both try and then compare our<br/>results!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
