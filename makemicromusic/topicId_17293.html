I prefer to know who is trying out the<br/>program at this stage until the release.</p><p>Yes - you can only have one pitch bend in a channel at once. The reason is because<br/>the pitch bend in midi affects all notes in the channel simultanesously rather than<br/>individual notes.</p><p>It is actually possible to write a synth that will respond to pitch bends<br/>only at the note on - in that case you get pitch bend polyphony within a single channel<br/>within the midi spec, but notes can&apos;t be bent after they start to sound.</p><p>The other possibility is to have some way in which the pitch bend only applies to a<br/>single note - or to use tuning tables. The tuning tables approach is already<br/>included in Midi but unfortunately the standard MTS sysexes aren&apos;t  widely<br/>supported, and custom tuning tables use a huge variety of different formats<br/>so are synth dependent - Scala can do most of them but FTS can&apos;t as<br/>I haven&apos;t specialised in that.</p><p>But anyway - FTS gets around that sending the notes for a single part to more than<br/>one channel. That works if the music is lightly polyphonic or doesn&apos;t use too<br/>many different instruments / effects. You can play on several out devices<br/>simultaneously so can take advantage of your extra Audigy devices - they<br/>appear as extra devices in the Out menu and you can use them using<br/>Out | Play on several devices at once. That option is already in 2.4<br/>though I think I did some improvements for 3.0.</p><p>Anyway if you want to try out 3.0 - or if anyone else here wants to for that<br/>matter - just let me know and I&apos;ll send you a url to download the latest<br/>release candidate to give it a go.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>Re: Fractal Tune Smithy: Is it MULTI-timbral?<br/>Posted by: &quot;klergstudios&quot; klergstudios@...   klergstudios<br/>Wed May 30, 2007 2:45 pm (PST)<br/>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt;Well, there&apos;s actually a bunch of stuff that FTS does far beyond<br/>&gt;what Scala can do in relaying. E.g. the keyswitches and various<br/>&gt;configurations it can handle. It also can handle multiple MIDI<br/>&gt;cards simultaneously, with different tunings on each channel. It<br/>&gt;really has lots of bells and whistles.</p><p>What do mean by &quot;keyswitches&quot; and &quot;various configurations.&quot;? My<br/>Audigy 2 ZS has TWO separate MIDI devices BOTH with 16 MIDI<br/>channels. Since they&apos;re on ONE card, could Scala retune ALL the<br/>32 channels individually? Most of the &quot;bell and whistles&quot; to me seem<br/>like a bloated, cluttered UI and Algo-comp stuff I do NOT need.</p><p>&gt;That limitation is in MIDI pitch bend. All the sounding notes on a<br/>&gt;channel are bent simultaneously when you apply pitch bend. So if<br/>&gt;you have a polyphonic channel playing chords, for example, all the<br/>&gt;notes in the chord are going to be pitch-bent by the same amount.<br/>&gt;Nothing you can do about that: the problem is in the MIDI spec.</p><p>Well, unfortunately, Scala actually won&apos;t play sustained chords on a<br/>MIDI channel. The sustained chords are cut off. So, that would mean<br/>Scala also does NOT allow polyphonic music to playback on a SINGLE<br/>MIDI channel. Unless, of course, there is some workaround for it.<br/>So, is it just the pitch bends that won&apos;t allow polyphonic music on<br/>a MIDI channel? Indeed, the MIDI spec is in dire need of an overhaul.</p><p>&gt;With FTS you can, however, assigne one input channel to map to<br/>&gt;several output channels, and if you set those output channels to<br/>&gt;the same timbre, then effectively you *can* have some lightly<br/>&gt;polyphonic parts.</p><p>I suppose you can do this in Scala, right? I hope by &apos;lightly<br/>polyphonic parts&apos; you mean at least sustaining notes on a single<br/>MIDI channel.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;ll have to experiment with it...

So, that would mean it&apos;s<br/>&gt; NOT multi-timbral, even if MIDI pitch bend is to blame, right?.</p><p>To understand how it works - suppose you want to play a major third 1/1 5/4 2/1<br/>in part 1 and the 3/2 on a different instrument in part 2.</p><p>Then FTS might do the allocations something like this:</p><p>channel 1 plays 1/1 and 2/1 on instrument 1<br/>channel 2 plays 5/4 on instrument 1<br/>channel 3 plays 3/2 on instrument 2.</p><p>So you get the desired effect as far as sound is concerned, but FTS has<br/>needed to reallocate the channels for the notes to get it t work.</p><p>Then to show how all that works with pitch bends, and why the channel<br/>remapping was needed:</p><p>Suppose the pitch of the 1/1 is set to concert pitch middle C.</p><p>Then channel 1 needs a pitch bend of 0 because the 1/1 and 2/1 are at concert pitch.</p><p>Channel 2 needs a pitch bend of about -14 cents because the 5/4 will need to be played<br/>in midi as an E 14 cents flat.</p><p>Channel 3 needs a pitch bend of about 2 cents because the 3/2 needs to be played as a<br/>G 2 cents sharp.</p><p>The pitch bend applies to all the notes in the channel.</p><p>One might think to play all the notes for the firrst instrument in channel 1 like this:<br/>(I&apos;m leaving out the values after the decimal point for the cents values here - of course<br/>FTS uses the highest precision available with pitch bends when it does the pitch<br/>bending)</p><p>channel 1 events:<br/>pitch bend 0.<br/>Play C4<br/>Play C5<br/>pitch bend -14 cents<br/>play E<br/>- all in quick succession so the events all happen within the same millisecond.</p><p>That would work if the pitch bend only affected a note at the note on. But musicians<br/>like notes to respond to the pitch bend wheel, so that you can bend a note after<br/>it has sounded.</p><p>So the effect of those midi instructions would be:</p><p>channel 1 events:<br/>pitch bend 0.<br/>Play C4<br/>Play C5 // Now playing C4 and C5 at concert pitch<br/>pitch bend -14.0 // C4 and C5 get bent 14 cents flat<br/>        // which would be the desired effect if a musician had rapidly moved<br/>       // a pitch bend wheel 14 cents flat after the notes sounded<br/>play E // also played 14 cents flat<br/>// so now you are playing a 12-et C major chord 14 cents flat</p><p>Which of course makes perfect sense for a musician using a pitch bend wheel<br/>for music in  twelve equal, but isn&apos;t what we want here.</p><p>The spec does allow for the possibility of a synth which switches<br/>off its pitch bend response to every note after it has sounded, but I don&apos;t<br/>know of any existing synth that lets you do that.</p><p>But because it seemed potentially useful for microtonalists, at least something<br/>to explore - I programmed it for the new waveform player in FTS.</p><p>Also you can easily program CSound instruments so that they only respond<br/>to the pitch bends at the note on - in fact  that&apos;s easier than to get them<br/>to respond to pitch bends after the note sounds - and the new FTS 3.0 also has<br/>an option to set CSound instruments to play in this way. So anyone interested<br/>can experiment with this approach using FTS 3.0.</p><p>You then have:<br/>channel 1 events:<br/>pitch bend 0.<br/>Play C4<br/>Play C5 // Now playing C4 and C5 at concert pitch<br/>pitch bend -14.0 // C4 and C5 are unaffected since already sounding.<br/>play E // E as a new note is played 14 cents flat<br/> // Now playing a just intonation major chord</p><p>Pitch bend polyphony is a word I coined to describe this approach.</p><p>Well many pieces we hear in this forum could be done just<br/>fine like that - using  pitch bend polyphonhy, so no channel<br/>remapping at all if one could just switch off the response to<br/>pitch bendsd after the note has started to sound.</p><p>Of course, in some pieces one is likely to need both - maybe in the<br/>same piece of music.</p><p>A quite simple work around would be to let the user switch between<br/>ordinary pitch bending and pitch bend polyphony. If one had a midi<br/>event that let you switch on pitch bend polyphony for a single  channel<br/>then you could use that to play any amount of polyphony you like<br/>most of the time using pitch bends - but when the musician wants<br/>to bend the notes currently playing - you send a message to switch off<br/>pitch bend polyphony and then from then on any notes currently<br/>playing in the channel would get bent up / down in synchrony<br/>- the ptich bend added to those already in play so if the musician<br/>is playing a j.i. major chord for instance, tuned using polyphonic<br/>pitch bends, then adjusts it using  the pitch bend wheel, then the<br/>whole chord gets bent up / down in synchrony, still as a j.i.<br/>chord.</p><p>If you want to bend just one note of a chord, then the note would<br/>need to be played on a separate channel - suppose you had<br/>a piece for keyboard and solo instrument - then  it would be natural<br/>to bend the keyboard chords with all the notes moving simultaneously<br/>- and to bend the solo instrument separately. So long as each was<br/>in a separate channel, then that would work fine with pitch bend<br/>polyphony + this message to switch the polyphony on / off.</p><p>I&apos;ve already programmed pitch bend polyphony as I say into the waveform<br/>player in FTS 3.0 - and may experimentally add in this extra feature to<br/>let the user switch the pitch bend polyphony on / off using a midi event.<br/>It is a case of bootstrapping as there is no such midi event yet.<br/>There is a mechanism to add them in permanently using RPNs<br/>but not really any mechanism to add them in experimentally except<br/>using sysexes which are clumsy in this context, or NRPNs which are<br/>supposed to be hardware specific so not what we want here.<br/>But there are plenty of free rpns and no new ones have  been<br/>added for years.</p><p>So - I would probably use a currently unused RPN - but clearly<br/>marked in the gui as experimental<br/>and let the user vary the number for the RPN if they like (on the very remote<br/>chance that another RPN gets added to the spec in the interim).</p><p>If it were to prove really useful to be able to switch pitch polyphony on / off<br/>in this way - who  knows, maybe the new RPN might get added to the midi spec<br/> - well one can hope.</p><p>Anyway this is just one idea for a way to deal with the situation<br/>of the current limitations on pitch polyphony in Midi<br/>that I am interested in and happen to be exploring slowly myself.</p><p>BTW why I call it pitch bend polyphony rather than polyphony is because<br/>notes at 12-et intervals can be played in the same channel.<br/>That includes all the octaves so for any 12 tone temperament<br/>then you need at most 12 channels for all the pitch bends for<br/>any piece for a single instrument no matter how  much polyphony<br/>there is - 12 channels gives unlimited polyphony in any temperament.<br/>I&apos;m sometimes a bit lazy and just call it pitch polyphony but that is<br/>something of an oxymoron, should be &quot;pitch bend polyphony&quot;.</p><p>Often less is required - e.g. at any time you are unlikely to be using<br/>all twelve intervals in very short succession -  unless you are doing serial music.<br/>Also for  instance in Werkmeister III, several of the intervals less than<br/>an octave are also theoretically 12-et intervals, so can be played on the same channel.</p><p>Most soundcards also let you play notes on several instruments simultaneously<br/>in the same channel so long as they use the same pitch bends and effects<br/>(unfortunately, including the same stereo pan position) - anyway that<br/>can be a great saving in channels for orchestral retuning. It is possible<br/>that that may be why you got your notes played on the same instrument<br/>if FTS was playing them like that.</p><p>On the MTS sysexes - well the tendency to use soft synths more and more<br/>is actaully potentially an advantage here. The FM7 and I think other soft synths<br/>now too from Native Instruments supports MTS sysexes. It isn&apos;t that hard to<br/>add support for them in software so maybe we will see more synths supporting<br/>them in future, in the same way that more and more now support .TUN<br/>tables. BTW FTS 3.0 lets you load a .TUN table and tell it that the current<br/>midi device is tuned to it. But that&apos;s not as flexible naturally as an MTS<br/>sysex where you just need to change the tuning in FTS and the midi<br/>output device gets automatically retuned to your desired tuning.</p><p>So - I hope more soft synths will support MTS sysexes as time goes on.<br/>Hopefully also, libraries of shared routines will get developed to make it<br/>easy for software writers to add MTS support to their synths.</p><p>Robert</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=17330 href="#17330">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

So, that would mean it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; NOT multi-timbral, even if MIDI pitch bend is to blame, right?.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; To understand how it works - suppose you want to play a major third 1/1 5/4 2/1<br/>&gt; in part 1 and the 3/2 on a different instrument in part 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then FTS might do the allocations something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; channel 1 plays 1/1 and 2/1 on instrument 1<br/>&gt; channel 2 plays 5/4 on instrument 1<br/>&gt; channel 3 plays 3/2 on instrument 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you get the desired effect as far as sound is concerned, but FTS has<br/>&gt; needed to reallocate the channels for the notes to get it t work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then to show how all that works with pitch bends, and why the channel<br/>&gt; remapping was needed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suppose the pitch of the 1/1 is set to concert pitch middle C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then channel 1 needs a pitch bend of 0 because the 1/1 and 2/1 are at concert pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Channel 2 needs a pitch bend of about -14 cents because the 5/4 will need to be played<br/>&gt; in midi as an E 14 cents flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Channel 3 needs a pitch bend of about 2 cents because the 3/2 needs to be played as a<br/>&gt; G 2 cents sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pitch bend applies to all the notes in the channel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One might think to play all the notes for the firrst instrument in channel 1 like this:<br/>&gt; (I&apos;m leaving out the values after the decimal point for the cents values here - of course<br/>&gt; FTS uses the highest precision available with pitch bends when it does the pitch &gt; bending)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; channel 1 events:<br/>&gt; pitch bend 0. &gt; Play C4 &gt; Play C5 &gt; pitch bend -14 cents<br/>&gt; play E<br/>&gt; - all in quick succession so the events all happen within the same millisecond.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would work if the pitch bend only affected a note at the note on. But musicians<br/>&gt; like notes to respond to the pitch bend wheel, so that you can bend a note after<br/>&gt; it has sounded.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the effect of those midi instructions would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; channel 1 events:<br/>&gt; pitch bend 0. &gt; Play C4 &gt; Play C5 // Now playing C4 and C5 at concert pitch<br/>&gt; pitch bend -14.0 // C4 and C5 get bent 14 cents flat<br/>&gt;         // which would be the desired effect if a musician had rapidly moved<br/>&gt;        // a pitch bend wheel 14 cents flat after the notes sounded<br/>&gt; play E // also played 14 cents flat<br/>&gt; // so now you are playing a 12-et C major chord 14 cents flat<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which of course makes perfect sense for a musician using a pitch bend wheel &gt; for music in  twelve equal, but isn&apos;t what we want here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The spec does allow for the possibility of a synth which switches<br/>&gt; off its pitch bend response to every note after it has sounded, but I don&apos;t &gt; know of any existing synth that lets you do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But because it seemed potentially useful for microtonalists, at least something<br/>&gt; to explore - I programmed it for the new waveform player in FTS. &gt;<br/>&gt; Also you can easily program CSound instruments so that they only respond &gt; to the pitch bends at the note on - in fact  that&apos;s easier than to get them<br/>&gt; to respond to pitch bends after the note sounds - and the new FTS 3.0 also has<br/>&gt; an option to set CSound instruments to play in this way. So anyone interested<br/>&gt; can experiment with this approach using FTS 3.0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You then have:<br/>&gt; channel 1 events:<br/>&gt; pitch bend 0. &gt; Play C4 &gt; Play C5 // Now playing C4 and C5 at concert pitch<br/>&gt; pitch bend -14.0 // C4 and C5 are unaffected since already sounding.<br/>&gt; play E // E as a new note is played 14 cents flat<br/>&gt;  // Now playing a just intonation major chord<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pitch bend polyphony is a word I coined to describe this approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well many pieces we hear in this forum could be done just<br/>&gt; fine like that - using  pitch bend polyphonhy, so no channel<br/>&gt; remapping at all if one could just switch off the response to<br/>&gt; pitch bendsd after the note has started to sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, in some pieces one is likely to need both - maybe in the &gt; same piece of music. &gt;<br/>&gt; A quite simple work around would be to let the user switch between<br/>&gt; ordinary pitch bending and pitch bend polyphony. If one had a midi<br/>&gt; event that let you switch on pitch bend polyphony for a single  channel<br/>&gt; then you could use that to play any amount of polyphony you like<br/>&gt; most of the time using pitch bends - but when the musician wants<br/>&gt; to bend the notes currently playing - you send a message to switch off<br/>&gt; pitch bend polyphony and then from then on any notes currently<br/>&gt; playing in the channel would get bent up / down in synchrony<br/>&gt; - the ptich bend added to those already in play so if the musician<br/>&gt; is playing a j.i. major chord for instance, tuned using polyphonic<br/>&gt; pitch bends, then adjusts it using  the pitch bend wheel, then the<br/>&gt; whole chord gets bent up / down in synchrony, still as a j.i.<br/>&gt; chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to bend just one note of a chord, then the note would<br/>&gt; need to be played on a separate channel - suppose you had<br/>&gt; a piece for keyboard and solo instrument - then  it would be natural<br/>&gt; to bend the keyboard chords with all the notes moving simultaneously<br/>&gt; - and to bend the solo instrument separately. So long as each was<br/>&gt; in a separate channel, then that would work fine with pitch bend<br/>&gt; polyphony + this message to switch the polyphony on / off.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve already programmed pitch bend polyphony as I say into the waveform<br/>&gt; player in FTS 3.0 - and may experimentally add in this extra feature to &gt; let the user switch the pitch bend polyphony on / off using a midi event.<br/>&gt; It is a case of bootstrapping as there is no such midi event yet.<br/>&gt; There is a mechanism to add them in permanently using RPNs<br/>&gt; but not really any mechanism to add them in experimentally except<br/>&gt; using sysexes which are clumsy in this context, or NRPNs which are &gt; supposed to be hardware specific so not what we want here.<br/>&gt; But there are plenty of free rpns and no new ones have  been &gt; added for years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So - I would probably use a currently unused RPN - but clearly &gt; marked in the gui as experimental<br/>&gt; and let the user vary the number for the RPN if they like (on the very remote<br/>&gt; chance that another RPN gets added to the spec in the interim).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If it were to prove really useful to be able to switch pitch polyphony on / off &gt; in this way - who  knows, maybe the new RPN might get added to the midi spec<br/>&gt;  - well one can hope.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway this is just one idea for a way to deal with the situation<br/>&gt; of the current limitations on pitch polyphony in Midi<br/>&gt; that I am interested in and happen to be exploring slowly myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW why I call it pitch bend polyphony rather than polyphony is because<br/>&gt; notes at 12-et intervals can be played in the same channel.<br/>&gt; That includes all the octaves so for any 12 tone temperament &gt; then you need at most 12 channels for all the pitch bends for<br/>&gt; any piece for a single instrument no matter how  much polyphony<br/>&gt; there is - 12 channels gives unlimited polyphony in any temperament.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sometimes a bit lazy and just call it pitch polyphony but that is<br/>&gt; something of an oxymoron, should be &quot;pitch bend polyphony&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Often less is required - e.g. at any time you are unlikely to be using<br/>&gt; all twelve intervals in very short succession -  unless you are doing serial music.<br/>&gt; Also for  instance in Werkmeister III, several of the intervals less than<br/>&gt; an octave are also theoretically 12-et intervals, so can be played on the same channel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most soundcards also let you play notes on several instruments simultaneously<br/>&gt; in the same channel so long as they use the same pitch bends and effects<br/>&gt; (unfortunately, including the same stereo pan position) - anyway that &gt; can be a great saving in channels for orchestral retuning. It is possible<br/>&gt; that that may be why you got your notes played on the same instrument<br/>&gt; if FTS was playing them like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the MTS sysexes - well the tendency to use soft synths more and more<br/>&gt; is actaully potentially an advantage here. The FM7 and I think other soft synths<br/>&gt; now too from Native Instruments supports MTS sysexes. It isn&apos;t that hard to<br/>&gt; add support for them in software so maybe we will see more synths supporting<br/>&gt; them in future, in the same way that more and more now support .TUN<br/>&gt; tables. BTW FTS 3.0 lets you load a .TUN table and tell it that the current &gt; midi device is tuned to it. But that&apos;s not as flexible naturally as an MTS &gt; sysex where you just need to change the tuning in FTS and the midi &gt; output device gets automatically retuned to your desired tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So - I hope more soft synths will support MTS sysexes as time goes on.<br/>&gt; Hopefully also, libraries of shared routines will get developed to make it &gt; easy for software writers to add MTS support to their synths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=17331 href="#17331">ðŸ”—</a>Doctor Oakroot &#x3C;doctor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2007 7:47:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually, the problem is that we&apos;re asking MIDI to do something it wasn&apos;t<br/>intended to do....

So, that would mean it&apos;s<br/>&gt; NOT multi-timbral, even if MIDI pitch bend is to blame, right?.</p><p>Well, technically speaking, yes. However, by allocating, for example 4<br/>channels (having the same timbre) to a particular part, you can have up to<br/>4 sounding notes of that timbre, and the relay mechanism (in FTS or<br/>whatever) takes care of mapping the channels appropriately. So, it&apos;s not<br/>polyphony on one channel, but it&apos;s the closest you&apos;re going to get in the<br/>MIDI world because...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m still confused as to WHY pitch bend even affects polyphony<br/>&gt; in a MIDI channel, in the first place.</p><p>It&apos;s because the MIDI spec says that when a pitch-bend message is received<br/>on a channel, all of the sounding notes on that channel are bent by the<br/>same amount. I.e., the pitch-bend spec wasn&apos;t really intended for<br/>micro-tonal use. You can&apos;t (unless you have some other non-standard<br/>support) send &quot;Note-on 1, Pitch-bend 1, Note-on 2, Pitch-bend 2, Note-off<br/>1&quot; and expect that it will work as you think it should.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=17338 href="#17338">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;yahoogroups@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2007 10:10:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, Carl, I think that&apos;s right - midi is based on the idea of a keyboard with discrete keys.<br/>Csound is based on the idea of a score that you enter as text. So doesn&apos;t have<br/>to have discrete notes. If you don&apos;t use a keyboard or notation software to<br/>enter notes, but just enter note frequencies by hand, then you can bypass<br/>that whole layer of assigning pitches to midi keys.</p><p>The pitch bend in midi is based on the idea of a pitch bend wheel or the like<br/>modifying the pitch of keyboard notes - so it makes sense to bend them all<br/>by the same amount.</p><p>Even if you had midi note numbers with millions of notes per octave, you<br/>still would need to be able to play them from a keyboard, and somewhere in the<br/>interface between the keyboard and the synth, you would need something<br/>like the midi format on the way to convert the played notes into pitches.</p><p>So for instance with CSound - although they can type anything they<br/>like into CSound scores, in order to be able to play the CSound<br/>instruments in real time from keyboards or notation software,<br/>they added in support for midi - the best<br/>way to do the job at present with midi equipment so universal.</p><p>Midi plus tuning tables is fine for microtonal music, lets you use the tuning<br/>table to retune the notes of the synth just as you like, and the pitch bends<br/>to bend those notes after they are played. The only problem with that<br/>is that MTS sysexes haven&apos;t been implemented widely. That&apos;s not really<br/>a fault in the spec.</p><p>Since the MTS sysexes aren&apos;t widely implemented, programmers resort<br/>instead to using pitch bends since those are widely implemented - but<br/>have to use them to do a job they aren&apos;t designed to do really.<br/>But it does work well enough to be worth doing and software<br/>can do all the tricky stuff under the hood - it doesn&apos;t have to bother<br/>the user unless they want to know the techy details of how it is done.<br/>In terms of timing etc. it is reasonably efficient, doesn&apos;t add much<br/>to the event stream. So it works for lightly polyphonic pieces or<br/>ones with as much polyphony as you like but not too many<br/>instruments playing simultaneously - or for full orchestral pieces<br/>with a fair bit of work if you have multiple midi in and out devices.</p><p>To get Midi to work better for the user without those limitations, the<br/>best thing would be to have wider support for MTS. Second best is<br/>to have support for .TUN which we already have to some extent.<br/>Another option is that pitch bend polyphony idea - it is something<br/>I find interesting, and can be useful at times when using CSound<br/>instruments in real time using midi, so perhaps may be more widely<br/>useful as well.</p><p>The fractional note idea is interesting but you would still have to<br/>work out how the player of the instrument is going to get those<br/>fractional notes - and you also have to figure out how to fit it in<br/>to the existing midi spec - if you make too big a difference then<br/>you might as well call it something else especially if the result is<br/>no longer backwards compatible with existing hardware and<br/>software. We discussed it on the tuning list a while back, with<br/>no really definite conclusion either way about what is the best way<br/>ahead for midi for microtonalists.</p><p>Robert</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=17339 href="#17339">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2007 12:38:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 09:43 AM 6/1/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Well, we don&apos;t even have a standard way to indicate that in a written<br/>&gt;score yet.

One of the nice things about Tonescape<br/>is that once you&apos;ve composed a piece, you can try it<br/>out in any other tuning which has the same cardinality.</p><p>For this reason, i&apos;ve decided that from now on all the<br/>Tonescape files i create of pieces from the standard<br/>Western repertoire will use a 31-note tuning. The<br/>standard musical notation can be modeled as a 31-note<br/>chain-of-5ths running from Gbb on the flat end to<br/>Ax on the sharp end. Therefore, the vast majority<br/>of pieces in this repertoire will never use any notes<br/>notated outside this system.</p><p>And Tonescape can use any 31-note tuning to play<br/>these files -- for example:</p><p>* 31-edo,</p><p>* 31-out-of-55-edo,</p><p>* 31-note chain of golden meantone,</p><p>* a 31-tone JI periodicity-block,</p><p>or even some interesting 31-note tunings which are<br/>essentially supersets of smaller tunings, such as:</p><p>* a 31-note meantone using a 699.99-cent generator,<br/>which makes it audibly the same as 12-edo but allows<br/>you to preserve the spelling used by the composer,</p><p>* a 31-note chain of 1/3-comma meantone, which has<br/>essentially the same effect as the above tuning but<br/>for 19-edo.</p><p>Any 31-note tuning can be used, so for example one<br/>could also try a piece out in the 31-note DES of<br/>TOP Myna temperament.</p><p>One other feature that i enjoy, which doesn&apos;t have<br/>anything to do with tuning, but which is way cool, is<br/>the built-in time-signatures. These employ a hierarchy<br/>of various levels of accent patterns, so that you can<br/>set up, for example, something as complex as a 19/16 meter<br/>where the 19 is divided into 8+11, which are further<br/>subdivided into 8 = 3+3+2 and 11 = 2+3+3+3. This one<br/>isn&apos;t as weird as it seems: it&apos;s something like a<br/>Bo Diddley beat where the last 2+2+2 are stretched<br/>into 3+3+3.</p><p>Tonescape does all of this and all of its tuning work<br/>in MIDI, but the point is that the software does it<br/>so that you don&apos;t have to.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=17368 href="#17368">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2007 7:16:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At 09:43 AM 6/1/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, we don&apos;t even have a standard way to indicate that<br/>&gt; &gt; in a written score yet.
