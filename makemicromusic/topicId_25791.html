If you are vehemently<br/>&gt; opposed to temperament, then your options are to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) have chords with wolves in them and just deal with it<br/>&gt; 2) have chords that are just, but make the notes move occasionally by<br/>&gt; comma-shifted wolf intervals<br/>&gt; 3) allow for occasional pitch drift<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel is a proponent of #1. I don&apos;t like any of them. #2 was what I<br/>&gt; started exploring when I tried to retune Debussy and eventually<br/>&gt; decided it wasn&apos;t worth it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you look closely, the only consistent harmonic relations near x/16<br/>&gt; &gt; (o-tonal) or 16/x (u-tonal)...and while many of the relationships really<br/>&gt; &gt; do near 5-limit (IE 5/4 and 3/2) others much closer near 19/16, 27/16,<br/>&gt; &gt; 17/16, 18/16 (AKA 9/8), and 16/9 than anything 5-limit. So when Debussy<br/>&gt; &gt; does his crazy modulations, isn&apos;t it fair to assume he&apos;s using these<br/>&gt; &gt; o-tonal and u-tonal relationships based on 16 that occur in 12TET, but &gt; &gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; the other systems, which really are much more suited to optimize around<br/>&gt; &gt; 5-limit diatonic scales?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who cares about dyads?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>m.develde@...</h3><span>2/25/2011 5:00:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just uploaded a pdf of the score with the JI ratios next to the notes.<br/>Much easier to read than the Scala sequence file.</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_no1_(MJI_2011-02-20).pdf">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_no1_(MJI_2011-02-20).pdf</a></p><p>You&apos;ll see that not only the sound of JI is beautiful, but it looks beautiful in numbers too :)</p><p>-Marcel</p><p>-----Oorspronkelijk bericht----- From: m.develde@...<br/>Sent: Tuesday, February 22, 2011 5:52 AM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Marcel</p><p>?Hi Mike and Michael,</p><p>Your responses show that you have not listened very well to my tuning of<br/>Drei Equale no1, nor had a look at the tuning as I suggested ;)<br/>There are no wolfs or held note comma shifts, nor is there any drifting.<br/>These problems do not occur in correct JI as I&apos;ve found through my research.</p><p>The problems you discuss are unavoidable in the classic 5-limit &quot;JI&quot;, but<br/>this is clearly a wrong system and has nothing to do with what I&apos;m doing.<br/>Quickest way to demonstrate the difference is to listen to both.<br/>My JI:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_no1_%28MJI_2011-02-20%29.mid">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_no1_%28MJI_2011-02-20%29.mid</a><br/>Classic 5-limit &quot;JI&quot;:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_No1_%28classic-5-limit-JI%29.mid">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_No1_%28classic-5-limit-JI%29.mid</a><br/>This one was done by Petr Parizek about 2 years ago and also does not have<br/>any wolves.<br/>There are various ways to do the classic 5-limit &quot;JI&quot; but all are terrible<br/>and most sound even worse.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said before, if you want to see what&apos;s going on in the correct JI<br/>version, the tuning is right here:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_no1_%28MJI_2011-02-20%29.seq">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/Beethoven_Drei_Equale_no1_%28MJI_2011-02-20%29.seq</a></p><p>Also,  I just read your discussion went to things like 17/16 19/16 etc..<br/>I&apos;ve researched this extensively as well, just like all the other things<br/>you&apos;ve mentioned.<br/>In fact I&apos;ve researched them, then revisited them over and over again.<br/>I retuned much music with each method, and investigated the musical logic,<br/>mathematical soundness and possibilities of all of them (and several other<br/>systems and solutions you didn&apos;t mention).<br/>It&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing full time for over 3 years now.</p><p>The tuning I&apos;ve posted here of the Drei Equale no1 isn&apos;t just &quot;a tuning&quot;.<br/>It is true Just Intonation.

It<br/>&gt; must never be shut in and become an academic art. - Claude Debussy&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he was academically trained, his attitude toward music and communicating about it seemed anything but &quot;proper&quot; in so many ways.&nbsp; In my opinion, such an attitude plays a huge part in the playfulness of his music, and the sense of effortless/seamless beauty rather than rushed technique and compositional angst.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2011 3:12:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
