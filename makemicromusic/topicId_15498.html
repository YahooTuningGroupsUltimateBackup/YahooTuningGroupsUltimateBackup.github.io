Those who have my Without R &amp; R recording can hear  this scale also on the hammer dulcimer in question<br/>Recently someone asked if i had an organ to play along with which i have done with other tunings in the past.<br/>here is what one has to do to place it on a conventional keyboard.</p><p>for those that don&apos;t know off hand Meta -Mavila is a recurrent sequence which can be expressed by 2A+B=E. more on it can be found in the Wilson Archives</p><p>in this example which might make the series clearer i seeded it with harmonics<br/>15<br/>20<br/>27<br/>37<br/>so if 15 (times 2) is A and 20 is B we get 50&apos;as E Next we take 20 (times 2) which gives us 40 plus 27 gives us 67 etc.<br/>we  started (where i liked the series the best by experiment/ear) with 37. below  i add the cents to the next fourth along with how i have it tuned up in relation to 12 ET. all my recurrent tuning are based on F below A440 to possibly allow common tones modulations if they occur between other recurrent tunings. I decided to place tuned reeds into a pump organ and the follow situation developed ( and how i answered it)</p><p>again i added to the below  the cents to the next &apos;forth&apos; (including the closing one to 37) as well as the cent&apos;s deviation from 12 ET<br/>37        531.26      G# -35<br/>50        506.7        C# -17.7<br/>67        530          F# -7       91       535.7        B +23<br/>124      515.4      E +58.7 or F -41.3<br/>167      516.1      A +74.1 or A# -25.9<br/>225      (474)      D +90.2 or D# -9.8</p><p>from high to low using it closest letter names if i place the reed in a series of fourth. included in the cents to the next highest note<br/>C#      to D  203.9<br/>D        to E 158.5<br/>E       to F# 134.3<br/>F#      to G# 172<br/>G#      to A 209<br/>A      to B 148<br/>D     to C# 163</p><p>one can see how C# to D is actually bigger than D to E and if i continued the series one more place too the next key G would actually be higher that G# key. Also the closing four which is the smallest looks larger as a tritone. This was not my option from the beginning not what one would what i ended up doing and i used the alternate which also keeps the reeds with 50 cents of where they would normally be</p><p>C#      to D#  203.9<br/>D#        to F 158.5<br/>F       to F# 134.3<br/>F#      to G# 172<br/>G#      to A# 209<br/>A#      to B 148<br/>B     to C# 163</p><p>So one has to periodically has to change what would look like a fourth on the keyboard to what looks like a Tritone. hence with only 7 tones we have ran into trouble with the conventional keyboard. doable but with a Generalized Keyboard we would not have to concern ourselves with this.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
