These are all pieces that were performed during our last 2002-<br/>2003 concert season. Hope everybody is having a nice Summer!</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/443/composers_concordance.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/443/composers_concordance.html</a></p><p>[P.S. don&apos;t worry about having to &quot;sign up&quot; to hear sound files:<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> sends *very little* spam...]</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
