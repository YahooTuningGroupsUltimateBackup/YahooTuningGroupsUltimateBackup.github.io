Glove to receptor  communication is<br/>key in getting it to work well and since there are no led&apos;s on  bottom of glove<br/>you can&apos;t do things like face your palm toward screen unless you  move<br/>receptor to position not intended and re-write the driver to adjust  coordinates<br/>received by receptor.  IMO it would be possible, but difficult,  to implement the<br/>kind of instrument you described and the results would probably  not have<br/>enough accuracy to be usable.  Check out the P5 yahoo group though  and take a<br/>look at what they&apos;ve done recently with it.  It&apos;s pretty  interesting and it<br/>could become a nice alternative input device if they get the  interface smoothed<br/>out.  Looks promising.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Andy F.</p><p>--Robert, What else you working on?

How do you rate it as a  potential<br/>for playing a virtual instrument?</p><p>I&apos;ve been looking for a  way to play a virtual instrument - just a 2D<br/>instrument on the screen, but  to let one play it with polyphony<br/>and velocity sensitive - say a  rectangular keyboard of square<br/>cells or whatever.</p><p>One idea is to ask  the user to calibrate it roughly by touching opposite<br/>corners of the board  before they start to play.</p><p>Then the program could faintly display the  position of all their finger<br/>tips as they move them over the board,   whenever they are closer<br/>than a certain distance, show them more boldly as  they get<br/>closer - sort of like a shadow - then when they touch  the<br/>screen to within some minimum distance, depending on the  resolution<br/>of the glove, it would play the note, with the volume of the  note<br/>depending on the speed with which the finger hit the note.</p><p>So,  the 3D part of it would be exploited to show the fingers<br/>&quot;shadows&quot; and to  make the virtual instrument velocity sensitive,<br/>or indeed if one has time  varying distance data, one<br/>could surely make it acceleration sensitive  too<br/>or maybe to detect further finger movements after the ntoe<br/>is  already pressed down  (e.g. to vibrate the fingers<br/>sideways with the  note held down to vary the amplitude<br/>or pitch or to apply polyphonic  aftertouch<br/>or something).</p><p>Any thoughts about whether it might be  suitable for<br/>something like this. (If so I&apos;ll put it in my<br/>enormously  long list of things I&apos;d like to program<br/>some day - but if it seems like it  would be<br/>not to hard to program and that it would<br/>also work reasonably  well it would move towards<br/>the head of the list as it could be so  useful<br/>to have!).</p><p>After all once you are able to make the  design<br/>completely virutal like tat you are free<br/>to explore any kind of  layout you like.<br/>Even explore ideas for physical instruments<br/>and tuning  of them prior to making them<br/>too perhaps for those who are into  building<br/>instruments.</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;   &gt;...recently bought a Essential Reality P5  glove,<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;   &gt;<a href="http://www.essentialreality.com/p5_glove.asp">http://www.essentialreality.com/p5_glove.asp</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  awesome!   ...free SDK too!  ..doesn&apos;t get much  better   than that.<br/>&gt; &gt;Thx for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the  link.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yo...   <a href="http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=P5">http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=P5</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;$12.50!

It&apos;s a bit of a pain to get it to do what you want  musically,<br/>&gt; &gt;but I  found Nicholas Fournel&apos;s MIDI controller  app to be  pretty<br/>&gt; &gt;interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Already got it at <a href="http://Overstock.com">Overstock.com</a> for twice as much [oh well].  Still  a<br/>great<br/>&gt; deal compared with orig retail of $99.  It&apos;ll be  perfect for the app  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; writing.<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
