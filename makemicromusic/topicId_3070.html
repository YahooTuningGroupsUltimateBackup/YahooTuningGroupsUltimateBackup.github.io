They are micro<br/>&gt; &gt; capable?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steinberg invented the VST interface but they have<br/>&gt; opened it up so that other people can write VST fx and<br/>&gt; instruments and even host the plugins in other apps --<br/>&gt; so its sort of like an open standard -- Logic and such<br/>&gt; can run the same plugins that Cubase does. That makes<br/>&gt; it so there&apos;s more incentive to write plugins since<br/>&gt; more people can use them. Also, plugins can be ported<br/>&gt; between Mac and PC not trivially but not as difficult<br/>&gt; as a regular App is to convert. You mainly have to<br/>&gt; rework the user interface for your plugin and have a PC<br/>&gt; for testing and compiler and sequencer to test in and<br/>&gt; all that but don&apos;t have to rewrite all the plugin code<br/>&gt; at least.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; GZ, I am not sure if your Cubasis supports VST plugins<br/>&gt; -- does it? Do you have reverb and chorus and eq and<br/>&gt; delays and stuff like that in Cubasis? Or are those<br/>&gt; things only in the bigger full Cubase version?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The VST standard came out in Cubase 3.0 Mac. In<br/>&gt; Cubase 5.0, they upgraded the standard to VST 2.0<br/>&gt; which mainly includes three new things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. plugins can now recieved MIDI in and send MIDI out<br/>&gt; except sysex. This simple addition is the single thing<br/>&gt; that allows for a VSTi (&apos;instrument&apos;) plugin instead of<br/>&gt; just an effect like reverb or chorus. Both write audio<br/>&gt; samples as output, but the VSTi plugins generate new<br/>&gt; samples (instrument voices or whatever) in response to<br/>&gt; MIDI events rather than just process samples like an<br/>&gt; effect box. There is practically no difference between<br/>&gt; VST and VSTi except what the plugin does with the data<br/>&gt; it recieves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. plugins can recieved timing info from the host. This<br/>&gt; means that VST 2.0 effects can now synchronize delay<br/>&gt; times and LFOs to the beat clock! How Cool!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. plugins recieve a tuning parameter with each note on<br/>&gt; and other MIDI event they recieve. (Probably only the<br/>&gt; note on ones are of interest.) This feature seems to be<br/>&gt; something of a secret -- though a secret soon to be<br/>&gt; revealed in the next Cubase release, if John Lofflink&apos;s<br/>&gt; little birdie is right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m still searching the archives trying to figure out the<br/>&gt; &gt; thousand or so messages about reverb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Any help appreciated. Is there a VST faq?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are some discussion boards and faq like things on<br/>&gt; the site Jacky mentioned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]-------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More music files from MMM are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music/">http://www.microtonal.org/music/</a><br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
