I&apos;m wondering if Reaktor is any better than<br/>&gt; this FM7?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s hard to believe that NI would put out a synth that&apos;s<br/>&gt; supposed to<br/>&gt; emulate the DX7 and not allow users to import the tuning<br/>&gt; tables -<br/>&gt; totally lame.</p><p>I had the precursor - Generator. In that, I was able to<br/>build me a little slider thing that manipulated the &quot;note<br/>number&quot;: you can put anything past the decimal point and it<br/>will be played without any pitch bend hassle. Only good for<br/>equal temperaments, however. It seems I goofed too much with<br/>the then young windows 98 and/or some futil attempts to work<br/>with linux, so that I lost my installing licence. Playing<br/>around with 19 and 29 tones was enough to get me to try<br/>stuff like this in less virtual ways, however.<br/>I think it was also possible to work in the frequency<br/>domain, so that you can _create_ JI by multiplication and<br/>division. How to map that on a keyboard, or how to select a<br/>number of tones from an equal temperament for use, I have no<br/>clue (that&apos;s what&apos;s called the tuning table, right?).</p><p>klaus</p></div>
