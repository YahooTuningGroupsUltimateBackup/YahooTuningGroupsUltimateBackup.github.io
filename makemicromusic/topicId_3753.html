The serious looks are<br/>the musicians trying to read one of my scores. From left to right you<br/>can see a bowed psaltery, zither, marimbas, tray gong (obscured), slit<br/>drums and other percussion, long gongs with glass bowls behind, circular<br/>gongs and other metal percussion, rumba box and more zithers.</p><p>Since this I&apos;ve added untuned bamboo percussion and some very resonant<br/>metal percussion kindly donated from a local precision tool factory<br/>called Starretts (any relation?). In the pipeline - four more zithers -<br/>two to make up an Eikosany or two pentadekanies, two bowed hexanies and<br/>a stands for my eikosany marimba (still designing this one).<br/>Additionally some 22 tet tuned percussion so that I can indulge in some<br/>modulation. I&apos;ve also inherited a full set of church organ pipes so I&apos;ll<br/>be asking questions about these soon.</p><p>And the new website is still under construction.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
