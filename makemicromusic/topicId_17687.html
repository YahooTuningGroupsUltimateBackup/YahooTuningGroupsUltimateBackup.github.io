Some of the higher pitches were sounds i have never really heard on a horn. I will agree that algorithmic compositions often some off static. I think we have reached a level where our minds are used to them and hence can grasp the whole. I dare say i found this more with Mats piece and feel if all the variations would have been put into a single piece. i might have enjoyed it better . Placing the different tunings against each other, interacting,  would / could be quite compelling. my 2 cents</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At 06:32 AM 9/16/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s true that we&apos;re too un-harsh with each other.

I wrote it in exploration of the harmonic<br/>series that I face every day as a professional horn player. I see this as ripples in the water,<br/>but in more of an outer-space solar-system pool of water. I like to develop compositions<br/>by way of expanding or contracting phrases. (although sort of a stupid technique, I like<br/>it).In this case, the fundamental is followed by the ripples of all the other overtones of it.<br/>As is sort of hits the side of the pond, it bounces back at half time and at double time.<br/>This is not really a mathematical piece, but a cool weird musical piece ( As I, the composer<br/>hears it). I don&apos;t really know what an algarhythm is.</p><p>I really appreciate honesty, and it is true the low notes on the horn sound farty, bear in<br/>mind that the fundamental of this compositions in the A below what a cello can play. The<br/>sound wave is physically longer than the horn tube, which is a A horn and is about ten feet<br/>long. I don&apos;t think it is physically possible to start the note with a square attack; it needs<br/>to sort of start before the beat and fuzz in. It really should have been done on a tuba.<br/>Similarly I start to sound a little thin as I play high A&apos;s (horn in F high E&apos;s!)</p><p>A 432 - I am working as much as I can at the base tone of A = 432, I wish this group<br/>would discuss that!</p><p>The I Ching.- I am a composer who likes to explore artificial scales. I think I am in good<br/>company with this group of people who like to explore tunings. It&apos;s very similar. Since I<br/>started creating scales from the patterns in the I Ching 25 years ago, I have been through<br/>four revisions of the set of 64 scales. Revision 3 is a set of scales based on the harmonic<br/>series one scale per tone up where there are 64 tones in the octave. I will have this work<br/>ready for publication in the next year or so. I do not use the I ching as chance in any way,<br/>nor did John Cage really do it.</p><p>The I Ching trendy,(!,?) wow that&apos;s a new one!</p><p>Opus 102 is not an I Ching scale composition, but most of my work is.</p><p>Can public comments be posted elsewhere?
