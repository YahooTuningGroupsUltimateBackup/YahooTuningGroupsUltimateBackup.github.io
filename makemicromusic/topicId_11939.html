That&apos;s a reverb thing; different.</p><p>&gt;If the consonants are over-blowing the output,</p><p>No, there&apos;s no clipping I don&apos;t think.  It just sounds like it.<br/>It&apos;s the fault of your vocal synth, is my guess.  Can&apos;t you hear<br/>it?</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s a lot of discussion on the Myriad website about how to improve<br/>&gt;the sound from their Virtual Singer that have so far dealt with the<br/>&gt;vowels (because Praat can analyze them). There needs to be some<br/>&gt;improvement on the consonant side, too, though. The challenge is how<br/>&gt;to make improved consonants with formant synthesis (as that&apos;s the VS<br/>&gt;engine). Anybody know of a good analysis set already done with<br/>&gt;consonants in formant synthesis (or is the hard way the only option<br/>&gt;[doing it myself]?) ?.</p><p>This synth is better, but is Mac-only I think</p><p><a href="http://kaelabs.com/">http://kaelabs.com/</a></p><p>&gt;I did try de-essing: maybe I need to tune up my de-esser some more.</p><p>That should help.</p><p>&gt;And no, it won&apos;t be in 46-ET when I strike out that way: It&apos;ll be 15-ET.</p><p>Cool, I can&apos;t wait!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
