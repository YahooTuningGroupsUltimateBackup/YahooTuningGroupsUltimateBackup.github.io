It is 29&quot; wide X 24&quot;<br/>deep. To see the Maxi click on photos on the menu to the left.</p><p>The Maxi is composed of 6 modified 49 key midi keyboard controllers.<br/>Each segment has 25 front and 24 back white keys of which none are<br/>raised. The keys have been shortened. The octave range can vary and<br/>a method for marking the octaves has been implemented. Because I<br/>want to have many octaves in the 49 key range I will limit my<br/>octaves from a low 5 keys to a high 10 Keys per octave. Weird?</p><p>The six midi outs from the keyboards are inputted into the USB<br/>MidiSport 8X8 inputs. I will put each of the six segments on a midi<br/>channel one through six. Each channel will play a different VSTi.</p><p>The keyboards are grouped in pairs so that each set of two keyboards<br/>face each other. My first problem is that keyboard 1, 3 and 5 are<br/>reversed so in a sense are played from behind. On 1, 3 and 5, the<br/>key number 36 is on the right side and key number 84 is on the left.<br/>These three keyboards have to have the key numbers inverted so that<br/>low notes are on the left. This set up needs to be made the default.<br/>What is the best way to do this?</p><p>Once all six 49 key keyboards have the low notes on the left, I will<br/>need to map one keyboard to my specifications and copy the map to<br/>the other five, so that all six 49 key keyboards are mapped the<br/>same. Do I use the drum mapper for this?</p><p>I have Windows XP and Cubase SX. This is easy to do in Logic which I<br/>want to avoid as they no longer support the PC version. I will<br/>however consider switching sequencer if VST is included and it has<br/>the capacity to play six VST instruments simultaneously.</p><p>At this point I am not interested in microtonality.</p><p>To invert the key numbers on keyboards number 1, 3 and 5 I am<br/>looking for a software solution, preferably a plug-in. I will also<br/>consider hardware solution. Your help will be appreciated to resolve<br/>both mapping issues.</p><p>Kalamata Kid</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2003 3:00:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kalamataguy&quot;<br/>&lt;kalamataguy@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I made a 294 key two dimensional midi keyboard.
