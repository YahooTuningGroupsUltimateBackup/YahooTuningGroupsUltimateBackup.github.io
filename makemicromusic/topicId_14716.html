I have uploaded a DOS executable file that calculates the<br/>fret positions for equal tempered guitar, bass, or what have you. This<br/>is barebones stuff. It opens a DOS window that prompts you for the<br/>guitar fret scale (double the distance from the nut to the current<br/>12th fret, in decimal inches, say, 24.75) and the number of equal<br/>tempered frets per octave. Then it writes the output to a file called<br/>GTRSCALE.TXT on the C drive, and closes the DOS window. GTRSCALE<br/>contains the cumulative measurements in inches from nut to next fret<br/>for 1 octave. To find the next octave measurements, divide the entries<br/>in the list by 2.</p><p>I told you it was bare bones!</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
