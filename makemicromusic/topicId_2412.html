I&apos;ve been using drum machines way before that. My first<br/>&gt; really cool box was an old TR-909.</p><p>For those who aren&apos;t aware, you can emulate a TR-909 with Rebirth.

These beats, I then superimpose over the<br/>&gt; main rhythm.</p><p>Oh, so you&apos;re not using time stretching.</p><p>&gt; You are very perceptive! Yes - the main drum beats are constantly<br/>&gt; changing (with a delay plugin) to get the polyrhythms, while there<br/>&gt; are other rhythms happening over this, which gives an illusion of a<br/>&gt; continuous &quot;pulse&quot;.</p><p>I prefer this when it&apos;s done like mid-90s drum&amp;bass, with simple delay,<br/>gating and no reverb.  But that wouldn&apos;t really fit in with the rest of<br/>what Jacky&apos;s doing here ...</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
