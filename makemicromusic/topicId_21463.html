I will be direct... there occured some unpleasant glitches<br/>that resulted in reactions... not only from Graham and Michael from this list, but also between myself and Mr. Vaisvil through private e-<br/>mails.</p><p>It became a necessity for me, after witnessing the to-and-fro in MMM,to point out some of the relevant issues from our dialogue with Mr.<br/>Vaisvil in order to clear some misunderstandings.</p><p>Mr. Vaisvil implied to me that he was quite stressed out for the past<br/>week due to this event. By having voiced my concerns about the<br/>proceedings of the contest, I fear I have perplexed him to the extent<br/>that our communications are now broken. The situation has not changed<br/>despite the amicable message I sent him today which he hasn&apos;t yet<br/>replied to. I suspect that he didn&apos;t receive it at all.</p><p>The nature of my concerns about the contest, which I shared with Mr.<br/>Vaisvil, center on these points:</p><p>1. On November 3rd, Mr. Vaisvil mentioned the possible<br/>disqualification of &quot;The Saba Storm&quot; based on the perception that one<br/>same person was sending duplicate votes in my favour from different e-<br/>mail accounts, which, I assured Mr. Vaisvil, was not the case. To be<br/>precise, I told Mr. Vaisvil that I had no power over my voters to<br/>listen to all the songs, though that was the ideal which I too shared,<br/>and I pointed out that listening to all the tracks was not deemed a<br/>prerequisite to the voting process no matter how undesirable. It was<br/>either that people were agreeing with my choice in the example I gave,<br/>or did not concern themselves with the details.</p><p>2. Second, there was talk, dated November 4th, of removing votes with<br/>similar content (so-called &quot;duplicates&quot;) in the midst of the voting<br/>phase, which was dismissed later on.</p><p>3. Third, there was the premature announcement, dated November 8th,<br/>pushing &quot;The Saba Storm&quot; to second place due to not counting the votes<br/>that later appeared out of the spambox - although Mr. Vaisvil had<br/>revealed to me earlier (November 4) that my entry was coming first so<br/>far even not counting the &quot;duplicate&quot; votes.</p><p>4. There was the misspelling of my name alone among all the entries in<br/>the premature announcement, which I found rather irritating.</p><p>5. Mr. Vaisvil appeared to be complaining about &quot;irregular&quot; and<br/>&quot;duplicate&quot; votes in the final declaration of the winners (November<br/>9th), inadvertently giving the impression that Ozan Yarman was<br/>undeserving of the first position and was a culprit who attempted to<br/>rig the contest. This insinuation was cemented with Tricky&apos;s earlier<br/>statement regarding the rejection of votes &quot;because of<br/>fraud&quot; (November 8th).</p><p>Despite these unfortunate proceedings, and the unintentional<br/>neglecting of two Turkish votes that could have been counted, I had no<br/>doubt that I earned the prize money, which was promptly delivered to<br/>me by Mr. Vaisvil.</p><p>While thanking him for all that he has done, I found the space to<br/>voice my concerns with the contest in case a new one was held in the<br/>future. My words were not well-received and I witnessed a rather rash<br/>riposte, so I donated my winnings to a charity organization.</p><p>I also would like to interpret Graham&apos;s words to mean that it was<br/>unfortunate that the prize money was distributed without waiting for<br/>protests to the voting procedure.</p><p>I write this letter in the hopes that misunderstandings will be cleared.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2009 1:16:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I also would like to interpret Graham&apos;s words to mean that it was<br/>unfortunate that the prize money was distributed without waiting for<br/>protests to the voting procedure.&quot;</p><p>   Graham, if that is indeed what you meant (IE that Chris&apos;s first award announcement was pre-mature and not necessarily that Ozan was undeserving or &apos;cheating&apos;)...I apologize for taking your words as an insult to Ozan and judges involved in the contest.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Tue, November 10, 2009 3:05:53 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Clarifications</p><p>Dear members,</p><p>I would like to make some clarifications concerning the recent<br/>developments involving my entry in the SoOn 2009 Compo generously<br/>sponsored by Mr. Christopher Vaisvil.</p><p>Firstly, let me state that, despite all that has been said and all the<br/>setbacks that transpired, I believe &quot;The Saba Storm&quot; is rightly the<br/>winner of first place in this contest, since it was seen in the end<br/>that it received the highest number of legitimate votes.</p><p>Let me say that Mr. Vaisvil and his colleague Jeroen Broks a.k.a.<br/>&quot;Tricky&quot; have spent their most valuable time in evaluating and<br/>tallying the votes and I believe they have been most careful to be<br/>fair in every respect.</p><p>However...

The kind of thing I would have bought maybe 10 years ago if you had a full CD.  For a first effort in that style it&apos;s really impressive (something I&apos;ve tried and failed to do over those same 10 years ;-) and I really encourage you to finish the album.</p><p>I&apos;ll try and listen to all the tracks in the competition before I got to work.
