Part of my complaint comes from my own end:<br/>there&apos;s been something wrong with my internet connection<br/>for a couple of weeks now (i suspect it involves my<br/>wireless router), and what i&apos;ve tried so far hasn&apos;t<br/>fixed it.</p><p>So whenever i download a big file (in Windows or Ubuntu),<br/>it gets stuck and i have to stop the download and then<br/>resume. I usually use Opera to download stuff, and<br/>this is really easy, so it makes me lazy to fix the<br/>problem ... but in Ubuntu&apos;s Synaptic, each time i<br/>cancelled the download and then tried to resume, i<br/>had to wait for Synaptic to read the status of the<br/>install all over again. So yes, it was a chore.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  At one point, i somehow got Timidity open and actually<br/>&gt; &gt;  heard some notes, but now i can&apos;t remember how i did that.<br/>&gt; &gt;  I thought i clicked on the Timidity executable, but<br/>&gt; &gt;  that&apos;s not working now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wait, what do you mean &quot;clicked on the Timidity executable&quot;?<br/>&gt; Did you go to the /usr/bin directory in the file manager<br/>&gt; and click the timidity icon there?

I honestly can&apos;t remember how i<br/>got something the first time. It was a very simple, minimal<br/>MIDI player application, kind of like a crude little WinAmp.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  I followed all of the instructions i found here:<br/>&gt; &gt;  <a href="http://frankscorner.org/index.php?p=mid">http://frankscorner.org/index.php?p=mid</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  But when i come to the end of that webpage, and run<br/>&gt; &gt;  the command &quot;timidity -iA&quot; in the terminal, i get a<br/>&gt; &gt;  message that says this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  &quot;TiMidity starting in ALSA server mode<br/>&gt; &gt;  Opening sequencer port: 129:0 129:1 129:2 129:3&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  but then the cursor just hangs and i don&apos;t see the<br/>&gt; &gt;  command prompt.

When first installing,<br/>Tonescape runs a search on system components like MIDI,<br/>video-card, DirectX, etc., and will either install successfully,<br/>install with a &quot;your performance might suffer&quot; message,<br/>or abort installation, depending on what it finds about<br/>your system.</p><p>Tonescape was designed to run only under Windows, and<br/>it&apos;s stuck in a beta right now, so even with Windows<br/>a lot of people have had problems getting it installed,<br/>or if it installs, on some systems it runs but doesn&apos;t<br/>show the Lattice (which of course is its main feature).</p><p>Danny:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Danny Wier &lt;dawiertx@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried to upgrade from 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) to 8.04 beta<br/>&gt; last week, and downloaded and installed the Ubuntu Studio<br/>&gt; additions.
