That&apos;s 4(!) general categories of interval that all fall within the interval class of &quot;2nd&quot;, making for a very uneven scale, which nevertheless revealed itself to me to be full of depth and mystery.  I found it capable of great contrast--depending on where one is in the scale, the mood varies greatly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For those interested, I mapped it to a keyboard using the nearest 12-equal semitones, making a scale of C Db Eb Fx G# A# B.
