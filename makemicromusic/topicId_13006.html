This was what got Microsoft to hire him to do Direct Music.<br/>Dr. T&apos;s KCS has an Algorthmic Music Generator, and you&apos;ll need the Atari ST emulators to get at that.</p><p>I ain&apos;t go no software, but I&apos;ve taken stabs at machine-musics:<br/><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~brentishere/">http://home.comcast.net/~brentishere/</a><br/><a href="http://www.freewebtown.com/brewt/">http://www.freewebtown.com/brewt/</a></p><p>-bjc</p></div><h3><a id=13008 href="#13008">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2006 1:57:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, brentishere@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Late to the party, as ever I am:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Other cool tools:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Microsoft&apos;s own DirectMusic9.

You can&apos;t make anything much<br/>happen without reading the instructions, and when you do read the<br/>instructions, it seems to be mostly baloney.
