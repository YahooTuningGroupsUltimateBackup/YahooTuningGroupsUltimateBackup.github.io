What you probably aren&apos;t aware of, as a newer member, is that the names mentioned as not being part are known personally by a good number of us, and also some of them are right here on the West coast, just perfect for inclusion. Microtonal happenings are so few and far between that it seems a shame to have such a small number of performers.</p><p>My only other thought is that there is plenty of material for another festival next year. And I&apos;m sure sorry I can&apos;t make it up there for this one - it&apos;s been a bit too long since I&apos;ve had my characteristically good times in Seattle!</p><p>Also, it has been kinda quiet from AJK and CB about a proposed bash in Chicago - boys?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=13852 href="#13852">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2006 12:51:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>like i said i am sick of all the politics</p><p>J.Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; Well friends,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have to say I&apos;m fairly disappointed (though perhaps, not entirely<br/>&gt; surprised) by the rather lame and pathetic response to the announced<br/>&gt; microtonal guitar fest in Seattle.
