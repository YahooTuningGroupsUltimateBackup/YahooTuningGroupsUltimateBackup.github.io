I found your piece to be very<br/>organic and natural, and not chaotic at all.  Perhaps this is because<br/>I&apos;m somewhat of a polyrhythm freak and 5 is my second-favorite<br/>symmetrical base (next to 7), so I had no trouble following the<br/>beat.  In fact I was even nodding my head at a few parts!</p><p>One thing I might suggest though is softening the drum sounds a bit,<br/>since your main melody instrument is also fairly percussive and thus<br/>can make the overall rhythm feel a bit crowded.  Also, it might help<br/>to add an instrument that accompanies in a lower register, just to<br/>fill the overall sound a bit.  Other than that, I really enjoyed it!<br/>Once it&apos;s finished I think it will be quite good.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Igliashon Jones</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.
