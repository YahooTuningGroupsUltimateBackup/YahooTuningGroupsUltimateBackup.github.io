(there&apos;s more going on but won&apos;t get into that now)<br/>In true minor (rarer than you&apos;d think in common practice it looks like to me now) the dominant major (of harmonic minor mode) is for instance:<br/>15/16 45/32 15/8 64/27 -&gt; 5/8 3/2 15/8 5/2<br/>and then to the relative major 1/1 3/2 2/1 5/2 for instance.<br/>But see the 15/16 32/27 45/32 dominant above, seen from 15/16 it is: 1/1 512/405 3/2, much tension.<br/>There are 3 different major triads in my JI, 1/1 5/4 3/2 (root from the base chain of fifths), 1/1 81/64 3/2 (root from both chains of fifths possible) and 1/1 512/405 3/2 (root from the 5/4 chain of fifths)<br/>Similarly there are 3 different minor triads in my JI: 1/1 6/5 3/2 (root from the 5/4 chain of fifths), 1/1 32/27 3/2 (root from both chains of fifths possible) and 1/1 1215/1024 3/2 (root from base chain of fifths).<br/>This is for almost all common practice music. Once we add the 7th harmonic chain of fifths many more possibilities arise but I won&apos;t get into that now (I&apos;ll demonstrate it soon though)</p><p>-Marcel</p><p>From: Michael<br/>Sent: Sunday, February 27, 2011 5:16 PM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] JI question: Marcel&apos;s JI</p><p>&gt;&quot;The thing is that not all major thirds are pure as 5/4.
