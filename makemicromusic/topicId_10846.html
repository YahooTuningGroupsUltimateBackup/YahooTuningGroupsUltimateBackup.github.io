Excellent<br/>performance-ship.

(To Kraig)  I&apos;m in England, working on an electronic piece, using<br/>the Eikosany, I&apos;ll e-mail you some theoretical things I&apos;ve been<br/>playing with if you&apos;re interested.  After that I&apos;ll be doing something<br/>with live electronics plus whatever... I wish I could ship you over<br/>here as a performer!  How cool would that be? ;)</p></div>
