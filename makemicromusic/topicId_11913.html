There needs to be some improvement on the consonant side, too, though. The challenge is how to make improved consonants with formant synthesis (as that&apos;s the VS engine). Anybody know of a good analysis set already done with consonants in formant synthesis (or is the hard way the only option [doing it myself]?) ?.</p><p>I did try de-essing: maybe I need to tune up my de-esser some more.</p><p>And the score was quick and dirty (I know), so there is no shortage of need for improvement there.........</p><p>And no, it won&apos;t be in 46-ET when I strike out that way: It&apos;ll be 15-ET.</p><p>-bjc</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2006 6:59:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, brentishere@c... wrote:</p><p>&gt; And no, it won&apos;t be in 46-ET when I strike out that way: It&apos;ll be 15-ET.</p><p>I figured that might be the case, but there&apos;s no harm in suggesting<br/>it, I hope.
