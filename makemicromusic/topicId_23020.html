It&apos;s like chords that I&apos;ve dreamed about or something&quot;<br/>  On the tuning list, I listed it before as one of my favorites in the album.<br/>And it (the song and its use of the tuning) does seem to have a profound sense<br/>of relaxation and lots of diverse harmony (and as you know I&apos;m a huge fan of<br/>tall chords, especially &quot;odd&quot; ones).</p><p>&gt;&quot;So he&apos;s taken the idea that 7-tet smooths major, minor, and diminished triads<br/>&gt;together into one &quot;triad&quot; and has viewed the cup as half-full, with every chord<br/>&gt;sounding pleasant.&quot;<br/>   Agreed.  7TET seems to have this advantage in a way as it is full of neutral<br/>versions of tones.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So my question to all of the experienced composers and songwriters on the list<br/>&gt;is - how do you guys manage to &quot;get into&quot; these low-accuracy temperaments?&quot;<br/>    I got interested in 7TET as it gets pretty close to minimizing root tone<br/>dissonance ala Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s curve....a property I still try to capture in<br/>at least one mode of a scale whenever I start writing a scale so as to make more<br/>clustered chords available.</p><p>    When I actually started playing in 7TET, however, I got somewhat addicted to<br/>the mysterious &quot;neutral&quot; consistency of the chords Knowsur seems to be alluding<br/>to.  Even more so holds for Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales (far as strong neutral<br/>intervals), which take the advantages of which JI accuracy and 7TET and, in<br/>general, put them together (thus making a &quot;high accuracy&quot; version of 7TET with a<br/>similar caveat to 7TET; that there is a terribly wolf-fifth floating around<br/>(actually 7TET repeats it much more than the Homalon scales)).</p><p>     I&apos;ve never composed in 14TET, but have had experience with the &quot;odd&quot; 19/10<br/>and 27/20 ratios it forms and would say they are both excellent (both very<br/>resolved and very new sounding).  The fair 7/6 and 11/7 approximations, of<br/>course, are also usable as typical 7-limit and 11-limit intervals.</p><p>&gt;&quot;After spending all of this time digging deeper into ever-higher accuracy<br/>&gt;temperaments, or middle path temperaments that are still decently harmonic, I<br/>&gt;wonder if perhaps the answer to microtonal enlightenment is to go all the way in<br/>&gt;the other direction.&quot;</p><p>    From my experience so far, I&apos;d say not quite.   It seems &quot;weird&quot; scales do<br/>have an advantage of consistency in feel, but not consistency in other<br/>places...and ones I&apos;ve found often come out when playing progressions but not in<br/>individual chords.<br/>     There&apos;s physics backing up the critical band root tone separation issue and<br/>Knowsar seems to agree with my subjective opinion that neutral intervals lend to<br/>stability (and perhaps said sense of &quot;consistency&quot; I mentioned before).  I have<br/>been playing around with neutral intervals for ages and love it.  However I am<br/>betting a (if not the) major reason that work has nothing to do with lack of<br/>accuracy helping it.<br/>  Remember back when I messed around with PHI and Silver Section Tunings (and<br/>got quite a lashing for it, most trying to say I was wrong and was really<br/>getting at the idea of Noble Mediants, which are &quot;always&quot; the most dissonant<br/>possible intervals being furthest from consonant intervals)?  I&apos;d still say<br/>Silver is a fairly desirable tuning due to its IMVHO solid sense of<br/>consistency.  However both have intervals not really stable toward anything,<br/>including neutral ot even 11 or 13-limit!  So I strongly suspect the consistency<br/>comes from what I&apos;ve heard Jacques Dudon call the naturally equal beating nature<br/>of recurrent sequences...a completely different kind of consistency than neutral<br/>tones!</p><p>   Igs touched on that too in a previous discussion.  That too much &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>can produce situations that bring about &quot;consonance&quot;.    Furthermore my own<br/>perception is, that the consonance need not always take the form of things like<br/>JI chords (where the period can be calculated by taking the inverse of the<br/>difference of any two tones...yes I even confirmed that with a physicist to make<br/>sure).  It seems many other patterns, though not quite as accessible or<br/>convincing to a whole lot of people (at least on the tuning list), do exist.</p><p>   I can&apos;t tell you how happy I am to hear these sort of responses though.  It&apos;s<br/>yet another thing that makes me want to get back to the &quot;lost art&quot; of trying to<br/>find different types of ways to achieve consonance.  Hopefully in the future<br/>people will be able to make progress in such fields without being called<br/>heretics (in a bad way, as if to denote someone who refuses to learn<br/>correctly)...my experience with learning about it has been quite good if not<br/>mind-blowingly fantastic in the past.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>aum &#x3C;aum@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2010 5:05:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 09/11/2010 09:07 AM, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given the recent influx of posts on the tuning list, I thought it<br/>&gt; might be nice to talk about some actual music for a change.

I think about it as of &apos;tempered&apos; or &apos;equidistant&apos; diatonics - the scale combining the familiar structure of 7-tone diaconic scale with the symmetry of edos.<br/>From the beginning it sounds good melodically as well as harmonically to me. I like its ambivalent character with neutral thirds and its overall harmonic simplicity. I agree with Knowsur&apos;s &apos;we cannot possibly make any unpleasant chords&apos; but I would rather say &apos;there is no big difference between consonant and dissonant chords&apos;. There are no strict consonances nor dissonances which is pleasant and useful feature of this scale.<br/>In many of my 7edo works I use simple harmonic progressions which I feel functional and satisfactory. Few examples can be found here: <a href="http://www.uvnitr.cz/flaoyg/flao_yg/kelt.html">http://www.uvnitr.cz/flaoyg/flao_yg/kelt.html</a>, <a href="http://www.uvnitr.cz/flaoyg/flao_yg/pavouci.html">http://www.uvnitr.cz/flaoyg/flao_yg/pavouci.html</a> or here: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Flao+YG">http://www.last.fm/music/Flao+YG</a> (Kelt and Pavouci).<br/>Best<br/>Milan</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2010 8:41:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; So when I hear statements like that 7-tet makes &quot;awful harmonies&quot; and<br/>&gt; generally works best if chords of any kind are avoided - which have<br/>&gt; reflected my own sentiments as well - somehow they don&apos;t seem to apply<br/>&gt; here.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; clueless.</p><p>Temperaments like father and beep take some getting used to. One thing to keep in mind with father is that the same interval can sound like a fourth or a third depending on the context, but if you&apos;re not careful it just sounds like something between a fourth and a third. It really stretches the limit of what you can perceive as 5-limit harmony, and it barely works as 7-limit. Beep really doesn&apos;t function well as a 7-limit temperament, but the 5-limit version &quot;bug&quot; has a nice pelog scale. Timbre does make a difference, but even with regular harmonic timbres you&apos;ve still got contrasts between &quot;more harsh&quot; and &quot;less harsh&quot;.</p><p>Although you can get these extreme temperaments to work, I think they&apos;re right on the edge of barely useful. The &quot;neutral third&quot; kinds of temperament (e.g., dicot, decimal, sharp, or the unnamed 3&amp;7 temperament, which divide the fifth into equal thirds that double as both major and minor thirds) have some potential. But another approach is to forget about regular mapping, and look into tunings like Wilson&apos;s golden horograms. While some of these can be mapped to conventional harmony, or regular temperaments (e.g., Kornerup, Hanson), others may have more than one interval close to the same JI interval.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2010 10:06:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Sep 11, 2010 at 4:58 AM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think perhaps it has something to do with timbre - maybe one of the<br/>&gt; &gt; new elements to wrestle with, for microtonal composition is to not<br/>&gt; &gt; just assume you can throw any timbre over any tuning like you can with<br/>&gt; &gt; 12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually I don&apos;t think any (harmonic) timbre sounds good with 12.

I certainly enjoy all of the acoustic instruments I<br/>can think of... Piano, guitar, organ, etc all sound find to me. I have<br/>never minded something like sawtooth with 12 either, although it&apos;s<br/>obviously more pleasant with a tuning closer to JI. But I have never<br/>heard of it as sounding &quot;bad,&quot; perhaps because my brain is set for 12<br/>to ignore the noise and focus more on what does work. Which is a trick<br/>that I have not yet mastered yet with other low-accuracy temperaments.</p><p>And as I listen to it again, perhaps it&apos;s just that this guy is a<br/>master of hiding timbral roughness... he uses delay and such a lot,<br/>and is very selective about the timbres he uses to play chords,<br/>preferring to use timbres like rhodes and such.</p><p>As an aside, another reason I made that point thought was just as a<br/>reaction to the notion that 12 is an &quot;awful&quot; tuning because the 5/4 is<br/>so sharp. In reality, the more I delve into tuning theory, the more I<br/>find that 12 is an excellent tuning. It&apos;s just not interesting to us,<br/>because the whole point of these lists is to get away from it. But I<br/>sometimes think that if we had all started working with 17-equal or<br/>19-equal or something, we would all find 12 to be this enormously<br/>expressive gem that we had missed and be reveling in its discovery<br/>today.</p><p>At some point in the future I&apos;d like to do an ET survey and write a<br/>piece in every tuning from 7 to 22 or something, and if I do, I&apos;m not<br/>going to skip 12, just for symbolic reasons (and also because I think<br/>there&apos;s a lot of xenharmonic material to squeeze out of it too). But<br/>even this is besides the point, which is that even if you really HATE<br/>12... 7-tet is way further out of tune with JI than 12, and on this<br/>album, it still sounds great.</p><p>A pleasure to talk to you as always.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2010 11:09:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Sep 11, 2010 at 7:28 AM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MikeB&gt;&quot;His song &quot;HANERU,&quot; for example, has harmonies in it that I never<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; conceived of as existing.

But again, I<br/>feel like that&apos;s something I need to get away from. After all, I hated<br/>7-tet, and now it&apos;s awesome.</p><p>I think it has to do with musical context more than anything. If you<br/>start playing a piece of music that is filled with near-just<br/>harmonies, and then start introducing ridiculous wolf fifths, it&apos;s<br/>going to sound absolutely terrible. On the other hand, if you hammer<br/>someone with ridiculously flat 7-tet fifths right from the beginning,<br/>they sound totally fine. Perhaps this reflects adaptations taking<br/>place in the auditory system as a piece of music plays from beginning<br/>to end, I don&apos;t really know.</p><p>&gt; From my experience so far, I&apos;d say not quite. It seems &quot;weird&quot; scales do<br/>&gt; have an advantage of consistency in feel, but not consistency in other<br/>&gt; places...and ones I&apos;ve found often come out when playing progressions but not in<br/>&gt; individual chords.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s physics backing up the critical band root tone separation issue and<br/>&gt; Knowsar seems to agree with my subjective opinion that neutral intervals lend to<br/>&gt; stability (and perhaps said sense of &quot;consistency&quot; I mentioned before). I have<br/>&gt; been playing around with neutral intervals for ages and love it. However I am<br/>&gt; betting a (if not the) major reason that work has nothing to do with lack of<br/>&gt; accuracy helping it.</p><p>I still don&apos;t really get this. Are you trying to say that chords sound<br/>bad if notes fall within a critical band of one another? Because all<br/>of the neutral seconds on this album are well within the critical<br/>bandwidth of one another.</p><p>But I agree, neutral seconds have a very, very pleasant sound. Very<br/>pleasant indeed. Intervals like 10:11:12 even more so. I&apos;m going to<br/>make a post on the tuning list about why I think this is shortly, as I<br/>have just discovered some research in the medical literature that ties<br/>a lot of things together about this. It has to do with combination<br/>tones, but not the kind most people usually assume. You will probably<br/>enjoy it.</p><p>&gt; So I strongly suspect the consistency<br/>&gt; comes from what I&apos;ve heard Jacques Dudon call the naturally equal beating nature<br/>&gt; of recurrent sequences...a completely different kind of consistency than neutral<br/>&gt; tones!</p><p>I always liked your PHI tunings. But in this case, I can&apos;t really find<br/>much beating on this album at all, and I doubt that it&apos;s because 7-tet<br/>has equal beating qualities. One thing I think is also a neat sound is<br/>to shoot for having chords stretched or compressed in proportion<br/>similar to how they naturally fit in the harmonic series. I.E. if<br/>you&apos;re using mavila, get it so that the major triad ends up being an<br/>evenly compressed version of 4:5:6. (I think this works out to be the<br/>same thing as woolhouse-optimal but haven&apos;t worked it out precisely,<br/>if you want to talk more about it let&apos;s take it offlist).</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t tell you how happy I am to hear these sort of responses though.

The &quot;neutral third&quot; kinds of<br/>&gt; temperament (e.g., dicot, decimal, sharp, or the unnamed 3&amp;7<br/>&gt; temperament, which divide the fifth into equal thirds that double as<br/>&gt; both major and minor thirds) have some potential. But another approach<br/>&gt; is to forget about regular mapping, and look into tunings like Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt; golden horograms. While some of these can be mapped to conventional<br/>&gt; harmony, or regular temperaments (e.g., Kornerup, Hanson), others may<br/>&gt; have more than one interval close to the same JI interval.</p><p>I will check those out, thanks.

The same conventions of synth programming<br/>that make 12-equal sound better might completely obscure the point of using<br/>more accurate tunings.</p><p>I certainly enjoy all of the acoustic instruments I<br/>&gt; can think of... Piano, guitar, organ, etc all sound find to me.</p><p>Our acoustic instruments co-evolved with our tuning systems so it&apos;s<br/>no surprise contemporary (fixed-pitch) instruments sound good with<br/>12. Harpsichords already sound kind of &quot;hairy&quot; with 12-equal.</p><p>&gt; I have never minded something like sawtooth with 12 either, although<br/>&gt; it&apos;s obviously more pleasant with a tuning closer to JI. But I have<br/>&gt; never heard of it as sounding &quot;bad,&quot; perhaps because my brain is set<br/>&gt; for 12 to ignore the noise and focus more on what does work.

Another thing we shouldn&apos;t underestimate is the power of<br/>association. A piano in 7-equal might sound wrong because the<br/>intervals and chords don&apos;t sound the way intervals and chords<br/>played with piano are supposed to sound like. Maybe that&apos;s why<br/>I don&apos;t like sampled (=equal-tempered) sitars.</p><p>&gt; As an aside, another reason I made that point thought was just as a<br/>&gt; reaction to the notion that 12 is an &quot;awful&quot; tuning because the 5/4 is<br/>&gt; so sharp.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder who invented the notion that 14 cents is a huge<br/>mistuning, I mean what do you compare it with? I don&apos;t think a typical<br/>musician would think that one seventh of a semitone is much. Yes, it is<br/>7 times the error of the fifth but that&apos;s only in relative terms. So<br/>it must be sharp because it is &quot;awful&quot;. :D</p><p>&gt; In reality, the more I delve into tuning theory, the more I<br/>&gt; find that 12 is an excellent tuning. It&apos;s just not interesting to us,<br/>&gt; because the whole point of these lists is to get away from it. But I<br/>&gt; sometimes think that if we had all started working with 17-equal or<br/>&gt; 19-equal or something, we would all find 12 to be this enormously<br/>&gt; expressive gem that we had missed and be reveling in its discovery<br/>&gt; today.</p><p>At one point I tried to hate 12 but I couldn&apos;t. :) Now I take the<br/>approach &quot;what else is there?&quot; but I always compare how 12 fits in.</p><p>&gt; At some point in the future I&apos;d like to do an ET survey and write a<br/>&gt; piece in every tuning from 7 to 22 or something, and if I do, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; going to skip 12, just for symbolic reasons (and also because I think<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a lot of xenharmonic material to squeeze out of it too). But<br/>&gt; even this is besides the point, which is that even if you really HATE<br/>&gt; 12... 7-tet is way further out of tune with JI than 12, and on this<br/>&gt; album, it still sounds great.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A pleasure to talk to you as always.</p><p>I return the compliment! :)</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2010 10:50:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,<br/>I can&apos;t believe I didn&apos;t see this post!  I need to check MMM more often.</p><p>This is pretty much my area of expertise, so I have a lot to say.</p><p>I&apos;m guessing by this point (I haven&apos;t read all the replies yet) that someone has brought up the point that there&apos;s no such thing as a &quot;low-accuracy temperament&quot;, because all temperaments approximate at least one or two ratios very well (i.e., look at harmonics 32-64, and you&apos;ll find a surprising number of intervals that are practically nailed by many low-numbered EDOs...and while they may not be &quot;concordant&quot;, they&apos;re at least &quot;rooted&quot;, because they&apos;re harmonics).  But I digress: this is supposed to be about how to make them work in music, not explain what&apos;s under the hood.</p><p>First and foremost, playing around in Scala tells you nothing.  General MIDI sounds are the worst in the world for telling you how a tuning sounds.  They don&apos;t sound &quot;good&quot; for 12-tET, why should we expect them to sound good with tunings of lower accuracy?  Get yourself a decent soft synth that can be retuned, even if only to 12 notes at a time.  This is my experience talking.</p><p>Second: octave doubling is your friend!  The octave is so strongly concordant that it can make up for any lower-concordance intervals.  Why do you think barre chords sound good in 12-tET?  Lots of root-fifth octave doubles!</p><p>Third: extended-voice chords are your friend! More unique or more clustered notes in a chord always means that you are approximating a higher-order chunk of the harmonic series, meaning even the best approximation will involve larger ratios than in traditional triads.  Some temperaments that look terrible in the 5-limit can really shine here!</p><p>Four: one concord makes up for a thousand discords.  Sure, a thousand concords might be even better, but people don&apos;t realize how much mileage you can really get out of *one* concordant interval in a tuning.  Even if that concord is not so concordant!  For instance, the near-10/9 and near-7/6 in 13-EDO work GREAT.  In all honesty, I&apos;ve actually found 13-EDO to be more consonant that 14-EDO (at least on piano)!</p><p>Fifth: know the *mood* inherent to the temperament!  One thing I absolutely LOVE about low-accuracy temperaments is that they seem to have much more obvious &quot;character&quot; to them than high-accuracy ones.  It takes some playing around to really understand the mood, but they will reveal themselves with careful listening.  Almost ALL my work with low-numbered EDOs revolves around exploiting their unique moods.  From a concordance stand-point, 11-EDO and 13-EDO are pretty similar, but their moods are like night and day.

The octatonic scale (which is close to 8-EDO) works as an equivalent of a &quot;chromatic&quot; scale. But if you&apos;re using it as a temperament, you&apos;re treating the intervals as (very rough) approximations of some particular JI intervals. While the &quot;major triad&quot; is dissonant and doesn&apos;t sound much like a 4:5:6, you can get by with something that sounds like a 4:5:7. That same &quot;4:5&quot; might sound like a &quot;3:4&quot; in another context (say a melody where you&apos;re approximating 1/1 - 6/5 - 4/3). It also works as a 9/7 interval in a 4:5:7:9 chord.</p><p>&gt; I find myself fitting everything to the diatonic map I have for<br/>&gt; hearing... 7-tet, mavila, 5-limit JI, etc. The furthest I&apos;ve gotten<br/>&gt; away from that is porcupine, where you have a type of minor second and<br/>&gt; major second equated with 27/25 and 10/9, but I still tend to assign<br/>&gt; whole step and half step values to what&apos;s going on subconsciously<br/>&gt; anyway, unless I&apos;m doing something like C-D-Eb-F in where it&apos;s just<br/>&gt; consecutive 163 cent intervals.</p><p>One thing about father and bug is that they do tend to take you away from diatonic interpretations. Anything with an uneven division of the major third (like the lemba decatonic), or an equal division of the minor third (like the 7- or 8-note porcupine scales), can do that to some extent.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Although you can get these extreme temperaments to work, I think they&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; right on the edge of barely useful. The &quot;neutral third&quot; kinds of<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament (e.g., dicot, decimal, sharp, or the unnamed 3&amp;7<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament, which divide the fifth into equal thirds that double as<br/>&gt;&gt; both major and minor thirds) have some potential. But another approach<br/>&gt;&gt; is to forget about regular mapping, and look into tunings like Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; golden horograms. While some of these can be mapped to conventional<br/>&gt;&gt; harmony, or regular temperaments (e.g., Kornerup, Hanson), others may<br/>&gt;&gt; have more than one interval close to the same JI interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; I will check those out, thanks. I&apos;ve been meaning to do some kind of<br/>&gt; systematic exploration of the scale tree for a while now, so this will<br/>&gt; tie into that. I think the question that this all raises though, is -<br/>&gt; how relevant is using x-limit JI as a starting point at all, really,<br/>&gt; to the end result of the music produced? If you pick timbres in which<br/>&gt; clashing partials aren&apos;t really prominent, or disguise them with delay<br/>&gt; and chorus and stuff, as knowsur did - it seems even more xenharmonic<br/>&gt; to get away from JI a bit, since now you&apos;re exploring all sorts of<br/>&gt; ambiguous intervals which can still have their own scale structures<br/>&gt; and hence still make musical &quot;sense.&quot;</p><p>With something like father, it&apos;s got such a tenuous connection to JI that it might make more sense musically to think of it as just a basic 5-note scale with an unusual structure, and 3 more &quot;chromatic&quot; notes to fill the gaps. Or you could start with something having a generator in the same general range, e.g. Wilson&apos;s #22 with a generator of (1 phi + 0) / (2 phi + 1) or 458.359 cents, and ignore any resemblance to familiar intervals.</p><p>&gt; But to more strongly elucidate my position, what I&apos;m really saying is<br/>&gt; - my paradigm until recently was:<br/>&gt; &gt; - JI is the musical reality<br/>&gt; - Tempering is a convenient way to lower the number of notes needed,<br/>&gt; and also creates new musical phenomena like puns and comma pumps<br/>&gt; - Puns create &quot;ambiguous intervals&quot; that can be perceived as more than<br/>&gt; one JI ratio; i.e. dicot thirds can be perceived as either 5/4 or 6/5.<br/>&gt; - This implies that the perception of the underlying ratio is what<br/>&gt; gives the interval its &quot;meaning&quot; to us<br/>&gt; - And this is presumably related to the virtual fundamental phenomenon.<br/>&gt; &gt; But after exploring superpyth aeolian tunings where the minor triads<br/>&gt; are 6:7:9, and seeing how they function almost entirely identical to<br/>&gt; meantone aeolian tunings where the minor triads are 10:12:15 - and now<br/>&gt; hearing Knowsur&apos;s album which is about as maximally far from accuracy<br/>&gt; in the 5-axis as you can get - and also reading Rothenberg - I feel as<br/>&gt; though the above paradigm, which I have basically believed in for the<br/>&gt; last 2-3 years or so, is entirely wrong.<br/>&gt; &gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt; Mike &quot;A broken empty shell of the theory expert I once thought I was&quot; Battaglia</p><p>Well, the idea of a harmonic series approximation does nicely fit with a good range of useful scales, and can even be stretched to extreme cases like &quot;father&quot; temperament.

Well, I admit that I like 12-equal. And I like equal<br/>temperaments in general. I&apos;m actually pretty surprised that you&apos;re<br/>such a big fan of unequal ones, since I know you have AP, and as<br/>someone else with AP, the whole concept irritates me. Not that I can&apos;t<br/>get used to them, but I prefer being able to create any sonority over<br/>any chroma that I wish. This is, admittedly, a part of microtonal<br/>music I have not explored so much, and perhaps my ideas will change<br/>when I mess around with them more.</p><p>&gt; Not only is there 12-unequal, but also 17-unequal, 19-unequal, 29-unequal, and 34-unequal, which are mentioned far less often around here than JI.

So chords like E-F#-D-F sound something like 8:9:14:17.<br/>There are scales that can be constructed with these sonorities, one of<br/>which is a mode of the Magen Abot scale I posted on tuning a while<br/>ago.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that a lot of the really, really hip modern<br/>stuff I listen to, I think, has amazing and beautiful sonorities that<br/>have emerged from a radically expanded approach to 12-equal and<br/>diatonic harmony, which I think hasn&apos;t fully crossed back over to<br/>classical music yet. So to take some of these ideas and put them back<br/>in a classical setting would be xenharmonic in its own right.</p><p>For example, this piece: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMINC9EOZME">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMINC9EOZME</a></p><p>Start listening at 4:10. At 4:58 onward, I get chills. If this isn&apos;t<br/>truly xenharmonic, it&apos;s at least pseudo-xenharmonic :) I haven&apos;t<br/>worked it out yet, but I strongly suspect that what they&apos;re doing here<br/>is treating 12-equal like a tempered CPS, and modulating all over the<br/>place, but pedaling it over the Db. That is, they try to modulate<br/>continuously to a mode that shares a common dyad or two, and do it in<br/>a way that it keeps sounding unresolved and yet harmonic. Then they<br/>pedal it over the Eb.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; even this is besides the point, which is that even if you really HATE<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 12...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (But not as much as I hate EQUAL ...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7-tet is way further out of tune with JI than 12, and on this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; album, it still sounds great.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18:20:22:24:27:30:33<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; 17:19:21:23:25:28:31</p><p>That is an interesting possibility.

A rule of thumb that has worked for me so far in my<br/>own scales is start with a temperament, find a scale under it, and then look for<br/>a combination with the best overall mini-max error for the dyads you like the<br/>sound of the most.<br/>  Thing is with mini-max....many times I&apos;ve found the result does not follow a<br/>single generator (meaning the generator(s) do not overlap at any number of tones<br/>exactly or sometimes even anywhere near exactly)...hence the occasional need for<br/>unequal temperament to get the best mini-max result and forms of dyads with the<br/>least beating interference (if that&apos;s what you&apos;re going for, which I realize you<br/>very well may not be).

One thing I absolutely LOVE about low-accuracy temperaments is that they seem to have much more obvious &quot;character&quot; to them than high-accuracy ones. It takes some playing around to really understand the mood, but they will reveal themselves with careful listening. Almost ALL my work with low-numbered EDOs revolves around exploiting their unique moods. From a concordance stand-point, 11-EDO and 13-EDO are pretty similar, but their moods are like night and day. The difference between these two is much greater than the difference between 12-EDO and 19-EDO, or 22-EDO and 31-EDO, and to me, this makes the former tunings more musically valuable.</p><p>What&apos;s your take on 11-EDO?

I think it&apos;s naturally a very &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;happy&quot; tuning, it likes widely-spaced chords and it has a very &quot;active&quot; feeling--there really aren&apos;t any &quot;restful&quot; triads, but that&apos;s okay!  Restfulness is over-rated.  Keeping intervals away from tight critical-band areas makes for harmonies that are concordant enough to keep you from gritting your teeth.  Have you heard the track in 11 I did on &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot;?  It&apos;s the happiest track on the whole album.</p><p>14-EDO is undeniably exotic, but it&apos;s also sort of familiar.  It&apos;s like being in an east-Asian country and going to a &quot;quote-unquote-American&quot; restaurant: the food *almost* looks right, and most of the ingredients are there, but there&apos;s still something not quite &quot;domestic&quot; about it.  Maybe it&apos;s the soy sauce on the burger, or the mayo with the fries, or the pickled radish on the side...14-EDO suggests familiarity but doesn&apos;t quite achieve it.  It&apos;s unstable but not so active as 11, and triadically the chords have a nice &quot;shimmer&quot; to them.  The subminor third/&quot;hemifourth&quot; has a bit of an Indonesian feel to it, and using it as a generator makes for two great scales: a 4L+1s scale, and a 5L+4s scale.  The latter scale gives a bunch of triads that have both major and minor thirds, but these thirds are separated by a whole-tone, so you can also play them simultaneously.  It&apos;s pretty neat!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 10:52:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Sep 16, 2010 at 1:17 AM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Well, I use Apple Logic and just use 12 note subsets, and previously I used only an FM7--which does support Scala, but I never used it that way, I just retuned 12-note sets by hand.

Also what about 14-EDO?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11-EDO has a very bright mood to my ears, perhaps because it&apos;s like 12-tET with everything &quot;sharpened&quot;. I think it&apos;s naturally a very &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;happy&quot; tuning, it likes widely-spaced chords and it has a very &quot;active&quot; feeling--there really aren&apos;t any &quot;restful&quot; triads, but that&apos;s okay! Restfulness is over-rated. Keeping intervals away from tight critical-band areas makes for harmonies that are concordant enough to keep you from gritting your teeth. Have you heard the track in 11 I did on &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot;? It&apos;s the happiest track on the whole album.</p><p>Which one was &quot;Audiospark spring bubbles turquoise?&quot; That&apos;s the one I<br/>keep coming to.</p><p>&gt; 14-EDO is undeniably exotic, but it&apos;s also sort of familiar. It&apos;s like being in an east-Asian country and going to a &quot;quote-unquote-American&quot; restaurant: the food *almost* looks right, and most of the ingredients are there, but there&apos;s still something not quite &quot;domestic&quot; about it. Maybe it&apos;s the soy sauce on the burger, or the mayo with the fries, or the pickled radish on the side...14-EDO suggests familiarity but doesn&apos;t quite achieve it. It&apos;s unstable but not so active as 11, and triadically the chords have a nice &quot;shimmer&quot; to them. The subminor third/&quot;hemifourth&quot; has a bit of an Indonesian feel to it, and using it as a generator makes for two great scales: a 4L+1s scale, and a 5L+4s scale. The latter scale gives a bunch of triads that have both major and minor thirds, but these thirds are separated by a whole-tone, so you can also play them simultaneously. It&apos;s pretty neat!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 12:55:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel wrote:</p><p>&gt;GM is just part of MIDI standard, it has nothing to do with the sound<br/>&gt;quality which depends only on the quality of samples or sound<br/>&gt;synthesis inside the concrete instrument, sound card, plugin...</p><p>Indeed!

Which quality do you mean? Piano sound is piano sound, be<br/>&gt; it bad or good, for example. If we can still recognize it as a piano<br/>&gt; then it&apos;s probably good enough :-)</p><p>Okay, look.  I love General MIDI sounds, whether they&apos;re the low-quality ones that have been on every Mac since the mid-&apos;90s, or the (rare) high-quality ones on some higher-end keyboards or Soundfont packages.  When I was in high school, I wrote several hundred General MIDI songs using a demo of a program called &quot;Easy Beat&quot;, and they are to date still some of my favorites of my own work.  I was proud enough of that album to release it on my website (<a href="http://www.cityoftheasleep.com">www.cityoftheasleep.com</a>) recently, recorded DIRECT off my old Macintosh Performa 6400.  I too used all sorts of neat tricks with MIDI to get some rather interesting sounds.</p><p>But the thing is, few people use &quot;good&quot; General MIDI sounds, since few computer manufacturers (or is it the sound card manufacturers?) bother to bundle decent GM sounds with their computers.  After messing around with different tunings in Scala, using the GM sounds on my SoundBlaster sound card and my computer keyboard as a generalized keyboard, I thought I knew how certain tunings sounded and felt.  Then I had a couple guitars refretted and realized that I learned nothing about those tunings playing around with GM sounds.  Playing a tuning on an acoustic instrument tells you more about it than anything, and playing it on a quality synth is *just about* as good (but not quite, IMHO).</p><p>Yeah, if you have good General MIDI sounds at your disposal, then you&apos;re probably in the clear.  But generally-speaking, most people don&apos;t, and if you don&apos;t, then you shouldn&apos;t be using your low-quality sounds to judge a tuning.  It makes a difference!  Low-quality sounds lack dynamics, they lack naturalness--they&apos;re hard to interact with.  They sound thin, mechanical, artificial.  It&apos;s like trying to judge the beauty of a work of art by a pixelated thumb-nail of the real thing.  It doesn&apos;t give you the &quot;full experience&quot;.  If you want to evaluate tunings, I think it&apos;s important to try them with the best sounds you&apos;ve got, or else you&apos;re not really giving them a fair shake.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 11:07:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs:<br/>&gt;Okay, look.

There is a constant thirst<br/>for new sounds because none of them can be enjoyed for more than<br/>five minutes.

There are only sounds.<br/>&gt; There are 128 GM addresses, which should be more than enough<br/>&gt; for a lifetime of musical work.  Beethoven probably never heard<br/>&gt; an orchestra so large in his entire life.  The reason they are<br/>&gt; not enough is because the sounds suck, and not only &quot;GM sounds&quot;,<br/>&gt; but almost all synthesized sounds.  There is a constant thirst<br/>&gt; for new sounds because none of them can be enjoyed for more than<br/>&gt; five minutes.  Essentially no progress has been made in the<br/>&gt; expressively of synthesized sounds since the Minimoog.  Which is<br/>&gt; why the Minimoog is still being made and in fact is considered<br/>&gt; one of the best synthesizers available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course even 128 is not a real limit.  Different sound banks<br/>&gt; can be loaded on command.  Also an ensemble of synths with<br/>&gt; different banks can play together.  The only limitation is that<br/>&gt; patch 72 should sound something like a clarinet.  Wendy Carlos<br/>&gt; wrote that she discovered, to her surprise, the orchestral<br/>&gt; instruments we have are not arbitrary, but rather evolved over<br/>&gt; hundreds of years to precisely satisfy human ears.  In the<br/>&gt; process of her discovery she created one of the best GM banks<br/>&gt; ever, the &quot;LSI Philharmonic&quot;.
