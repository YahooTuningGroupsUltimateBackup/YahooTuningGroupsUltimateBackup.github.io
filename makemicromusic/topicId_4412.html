Or how about a piano? Can you imagine what the original instrument builders had to go thru to build the first Lutes? Where do you put those &quot;blasted&quot; frets? Or do we make it sound cool and have no frets? Leave it to the musicians to figure out where to put their fingers?</p><p>If we are now the instrument builders, should the task really be any easier? We are only working with the things that we have at the moment, same as the guy who build his lute out of Pine.</p><p>I really do understand your intentions thou, I guess these are things that have to be added to the Implementation list.
