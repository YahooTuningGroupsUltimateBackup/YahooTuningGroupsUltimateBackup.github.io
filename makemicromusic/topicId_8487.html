I&apos;ve been very busy<br/>learning Sonar with the z3ta+ softsynth for microtonal composing. I<br/>should have more to share later.</p><p>In any case, here is the Press Release to our upcoming Composers<br/>Concordance concert in New York on Feb. 5. If this concert isn&apos;t<br/>microtonal, I don&apos;t know what is... considering these improvisers. I<br/>believe I&apos;m even going to be doing some microtonal vocalizations in<br/>this extravaganza. Here is the release:</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>The Composers Concordance ventures into the realm of the visionary<br/>with our next concert of improvising composers: IMPROVISIONARIES!<br/>Saturday, February 5th at the Cutting Room, 19 W. 24th St., NYC,<br/>8:30PM.</p><p>We hope to capture a new enthusiasm for contemporary, spontaneous art<br/>forms and will include paintings by Andrew Meshberg and visual scores<br/>as a stimulus to live creativity.</p><p>Our performers include the legendary jazz trombonist, Dave Taylor,<br/>the new music marvel, flutist Margaret Lancaster, composers Evan<br/>Hause on percussion, Gene Pritsker on guitar, innovative violist<br/>Arthur Kampella and several others.</p><p>Music will trace the history of legendary composers who used<br/>improvised and chance processes: John Cage, Netty Simons and Toshi<br/>Ichiyanagi with new works by the ever inventive Eve Beglarian, Arthur<br/>Kampela, Gene Pritsker and Evan Hause.</p><p>This will be fun.
