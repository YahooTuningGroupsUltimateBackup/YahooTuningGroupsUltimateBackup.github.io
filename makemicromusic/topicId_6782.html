Well known is the attempt by Alois H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ba. He was aware that in order<br/>to preproduce native songs of his countrymen in Czechoslovakia he needed a<br/>finer grain, so to speak, and therefore he halved the equal semitones. He<br/>tried to use quarter-tones. However, it is clear that by simply adding 12<br/>more notes between the existing 12 notes one cannot improve the harmonic<br/>relationships and the musical quality of the original 12 notes. What one<br/>needs for improvement is not quarter-tones but fifths of tones - the system<br/>Huygens used.<br/> &#x9;Again, Bela Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k, the Hungarian composer who died in 1945 in the United<br/>States, recognizing the value of the Hungarian peasant music both as a living<br/>tradition and as a source of inspiration for modern music, stated that he<br/>over and over again met the interval of the harmonic seventh and that he<br/>therefore laid at the bottom, as a basic foundation for music, a chord of<br/>four notes, adding the perfect seventh to the common chord. Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s<br/>testimony carries great weight, for he was one of the very greatest modern<br/>composers. Therefore, for the evolution of music, it is very urgent that we<br/>find an equal temperament suitable for the reproduction of Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s<br/>fundamental chord, which may be specified by the harmonic numbers 4:5:6:7.<br/>The &quot;tricesimoprimal&quot; equal temperament discovered by Huygens 3 centuries ago<br/>fulfills the requirement...&quot;</p><p>now I&apos;m really interested in perusing Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s  output for two violins, (the<br/>44 duos), which nicely blurs the distinction between the classical style of<br/>playing, and the earthier &apos;fiddle&apos; style.....</p><p>-Aaron<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6783 href="#6783">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

A nice tradoff, if you ask me.</p><p>I&apos;m one of those individuals who tends to think the boundary is, and should<br/>be, blurry between n-tets and JI.</p><p>Anyway, I don&apos;t buy any of the JI metaphysics, even though I love JI, and have<br/>used it, I can&apos;t seem to bring myself to be religious about it. It&apos;s all in<br/>what you want to do, I guess. I miss the open-ended approach to tuning that<br/>seems to have characterized &apos;Xenharmonikon&apos; as contrasted with the &apos;don&apos;t<br/>write an article for us unless you stay away from references to non-just<br/>tunings&apos; attitude of 1/1 and the JI Network.</p><p>Personally, I think there are plenty of interesting sounding intervals (an<br/>infinite number of them, to be precise) that ought *not* be ruled out of<br/>composition because they have no rational representation, including those<br/>that come from non n-tets (like the interval of phi). Just me, I suppose, but<br/>I guess I like the idea of *not* limiting one&apos;s compositional resources based<br/>on an a-priori conviction.</p><p>Hell, I don&apos;t even rule out 12-tet !!!! (some here clearly do, and I&apos;ve even<br/>felt bored by it, but I think it would be silly to say I never want to hear<br/>any music that&apos;s in 12-tet again!) Jazz, for instance, is made for 12-tet.</p><p>Besides, trying to eliminate beating from say, a basic triad like 4:5:6 is not<br/>always right for a given composition. I would argue that it&apos;s not right for a<br/>tremendous amount of music: most Western music throughout history, and almost<br/>all non-Western music (with the exception perhaps of Indian sub-continental<br/>music, which not coincidentally, is harmonically static).</p><p>As a composer, I find an n-tet convenient: I like to transpose and modulate,<br/>etc. and have the intervallic sound remain consistent. That intervallic<br/>consistency is often desirable to me. How close an approximation I want, and<br/>what n-tet I pick, depends on the *mood* of the piece. JI has a mood, and<br/>even different moods depending on the tuning, but sometimes it&apos;s just to<br/>static for me, and an n-tet will have to be done. (Yes, I&apos;m consciously<br/>siding with Darreg here--why not be a tuning omnivore?)</p><p>So I advocate *not* closing *any* doors. Why do people always have to pick<br/>fights about n-tet vs. JI?
