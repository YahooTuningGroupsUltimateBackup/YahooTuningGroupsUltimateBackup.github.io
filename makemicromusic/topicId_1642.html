I mean we&apos;d gotten along nothing<br/>short of magically to date, and being the furtive sort of hermit that<br/>I am, I was quite reluctant to mess with that. It&apos;s just too damn<br/>rare. Ken on the other hand, while surely no socialite, is by nature a<br/>bit more gregarious than I am, and he was pretty intent on making a<br/>get-together happen. I&apos;m glad he was.</p><p>We met halfway at my mother&apos;s place in Duxbury on Green Harbor. Green<br/>Harbor is a ghost town this time of year, and we braved the howling<br/>winter winds and walked the abandoned beach in a light rain.</p><p>It was surreal and mundane, and it was beautiful and a bit melancholic<br/>as well. On its best days, so is life... today was one of those days.</p><p>Several years ago Ken asked me if I&apos;d like to play on his (then)<br/>upcoming CD, Is that my world that hovers? As I&apos;d long admired Ken&apos;s<br/>work, I jumped for it--I played in thirteen-tone equal temperament and<br/>Ken played in twelve, together. Clash? No they didn&apos;t clash, they left<br/>footprints in the same sand we walked in today.</p><p>I&apos;ll miss my friend Ken Rubenstein.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=1648 href="#1648">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
