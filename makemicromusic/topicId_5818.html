All that remains of him<br/>seems to be writings in various places concerning microtonality etcetera, and quite<br/>entertaining they are. I was reading this one -&gt; <a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/</a><br/>~jstarret/composition.html which makes numerous references to a certain<br/>&quot;Microtonal Music of Brian McLaren&quot; album (at least FIVE volumes) and a &quot;240 piano<br/>pieces.&quot;  Is this guy for real? Where is he and where is his music?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=5820 href="#5820">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Sethares &#x3C;sethares@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2004 7:26:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacob wrote:</p><p>&gt; references to a certain<br/>&gt; &quot;Microtonal Music of Brian McLaren&quot; album (at least FIVE volumes) and a &quot;240 piano<br/>&gt; pieces.&quot;  Is this guy for real?

They contain a very<br/>large number of pieces in a large number of tunings -- equal temperaments, nonequal<br/>temperaments, just and nonjust...
