I may some time, now that it has been<br/>ported to Windows. I don&apos;t have access to a Mac, just Windows<br/>machines. But my use of Csound has been limited to sample based<br/>instruments so far. I have not used Midi and Csound.</p><p>I was long ago frustrated by the Midi restriction on legato pitch<br/>bends, channels, and no more than 12 tones at a time. There are some<br/>work-arounds, but they all seemed intractable at some point. About 15<br/>years ago I began writing a Pascal program to exploit the IBM Music<br/>Feature Card (which was a rebadged Yamaha FB-01 on a board), which<br/>allowed a program to set the specific pitch in cents for as many<br/>notes as were needed. The sound was cheesy FM, but it allowed<br/>unlimited microtonality to the nearest cent. After about five years<br/>of experimenting with that, I began to learn Csound, and eventually<br/>ported the FB-01 code over to use Csound orchestras and scores as<br/>output, but still used the same Pascal source code and macro<br/>language. There are no restrictions on number of notes, or vestiges<br/>of 12 tones in the architecture. My program has a maximum of 640k of<br/>memory, from it&apos;s DOS heritage, but I have managed to cobble together<br/>very large scores within that limitation.</p><p>I have not used FTS yet, but it looks like a much faster way to<br/>experiment with intonation systems than my way.</p><p>I use microtonality in Csound by building a list of discrete tones<br/>per octave and loading that list into a function table. Others use<br/>ratios more directly. But Csound can be a steep learning exercise. I<br/>have been at it for about ten years, and only use a very small<br/>subset, primarily sample based instruments.</p><p>Give it a try as an output format for FTS!</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>Something I&apos;d like to do at some point, at least to study it<br/>a bit to get an idea how it works and think about whether<br/>a direct save of FTS tunes to C-sound<br/>may be useful. I gather you can<br/>covert midi files to C-sound but that<br/>won&apos;t take advantage of it&apos;s unlimited<br/>pitch polyphony, which FTS would be<br/>able to exploit in a direct save<br/>if I implement it. That would be the big attraction of<br/>C-sound for me.</p></div><h3><a id=3989 href="#3989">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2002 4:08:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Prent,</p><p>&gt; I use microtonality in Csound by building a list of discrete tones<br/>&gt; per octave and loading that list into a function table.

I<br/>&gt; have been at it for about ten years, and only use a very small<br/>&gt; subset, primarily sample based instruments.</p><p>&gt; Give it a try as an output format for FTS!</p><p>Will do.</p><p>What I&apos;ll do is to do a file save in FTS before the remapping to<br/>channels. The format of that file will be my starting point for<br/>the project.</p><p>Then convert that from the note on / off format to a<br/>note on + note time format. I.e. you can record in real time<br/>with note ons and note offs, and then when you finish the recording,<br/>t can then convert it to the note on / note duration format and so<br/>to a C-sound save.</p><p>What would be nicest would be if it could be easily inter-convertible<br/>between the two formats.</p><p>I&apos;ll give that some thought.</p><p>This links in to a couple of other things too actually.<br/>I&apos;ve been asked to add a save to text format in FTS for<br/>other programs to be able to read. This will provide that.</p><p>Also it will be a first step towards making a file format that<br/>can be easily read and modified in a microtonal sequencer.</p><p>Once one has got a suitable file format for this, not only<br/>will C-sound conversion begin to seem pretty easy to do,<br/>maybe I may do a first rudimentary true microtonal sequencer<br/>for it too, just the very start of one.</p><p>Just started sketching a draft for it. Kind of promising<br/>so far. But the matter of making it inter convertible<br/>between the note on / note off and the note on / note time<br/>formats is a tricky one!!</p><p>Anyway if anyone wants to read it I&apos;ve uploaded a first<br/>sketchy draft.</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/files/Robert_Walker/micro_score_format.txt">/makemicromusic/files/Robert_Walker/micro_score_format.txt</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3993 href="#3993">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2002 8:10:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Prent,</p><p>New idea today:</p><p>Programs using the format can use any subset to output it.</p><p>Will have one option to use midi note numbers too for the note ons<br/>as 60.0 where you can have double precision numbers<br/>and e.g. 63.86 ... for the 5/4 etc so easy conversion from<br/>cents to /from the midi notes which will be a useful format for<br/>making scores in cents notations, or indeed supersets of 12-et.</p><p>Then it would just be</p><p>note_on: 1:60.0 2:63.86<br/>time_incr 1.0<br/>note_off: 1:60.0 2:63.86</p><p>for the nearest to a midi file format</p><p>Anyway idea would be that to input, would have, in windows,<br/>a dll that one could call to convert any of the formats<br/>into ones chosen format. I can write that, open source,<br/>plain c so easily portable to other platforms.</p><p>Would include routines to convert the output to<br/>a midi file or to C-sound.</p><p>Conversion to midi file of course will perhaps have<br/>dropped notes for complex scores, unavoidable, but<br/>have option there to do MTS tuning tables instead<br/>and other coders can add in other formats too of<br/>course.</p><p>So programs output in whatever format they find<br/>most convenient, and input in their chosen<br/>format too, and use the dll (or whatever its<br/>equivalent is for other platforms) to convert<br/>the output of other programs into their<br/>own format for input. Prob. just have<br/>a single routine there and the program can specify in the<br/>call to the routine which types of notation<br/>they recognise - there some work needed<br/>to find the way to make that easy<br/>- prob. some macros for common formats<br/>e.g. midi_like for the one just mentioned<br/>above, etc.</p><p>Forgot to include velocity, that could jst be a v</p><p>note_on: 1:60.0v0.5 2:63.86v0.25</p><p>range 0 to 1,</p><p>or an m<br/>note_on: 1:60.0m64 2:63.86m32</p><p>for midi velocity range 0 to 127</p><p>Also do so that there are one letter or two letter abreviations<br/>available to reduce file size, specify them each time you add<br/>a new symbol to the system, e.g.</p><p>n for note_on<br/>o for note_off<br/>ns for notes</p><p>or something.</p><p>Where the format can be anything convenient and this is just<br/>a suggestion,</p><p>I think the idea of multiple choice for output, and automatic<br/>input conversion to ones own format from any of the others<br/>for input, and open source and a flexible file format<br/>so new things can be added easily (unlike midi where<br/>nothing gets added in normal course of events<br/>apart from new sysexes) are perhaps<br/>the main points.</p><p>And of course no limit on number of channels<br/>- well up to say, maximum number expressible<br/>in 32-bit which is in the billions.</p><p>If you have too many channels then info can<br/>get lost in conversion to midi - but if you<br/>have no more than i think 1024 of them then<br/>you can convert to midi at least for<br/>use in sound cards by having several<br/>instruments playing in the same midi<br/>channel, so long as they all use the<br/>same effects such as modulation, tremulo<br/>and (unfortunately) pan.</p><p>Anyway not to limit the format itself to ensure<br/>that it can be saved as a midi fiile, instead<br/>just have authoring guidelines there.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3998 href="#3998">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2002 1:44:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers &lt;prentrodgers@a...&gt;&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I use microtonality in Csound by building a list of discrete tones<br/>&gt; per octave and loading that list into a function table.

I don&apos;t know how to get Csound to use the sco and orc files thus created to make actual sounds, but the sco file I edit into something Maple can read, and then do whatever I like with that and turn it into something Scala can read. Scala then turns it into a midi file, which can be rendered by a rendering program such as Timidity. I&apos;m writing something in the Nonkleismic temperament now using a tune taken from a midi file of Turkish music in 53-et, which Midi2cs turns into a text file in 12-et, with pitch bend information, all of which when fed to a powerful computer algebra package like Maple can be turned into actual cents and then manipulated however you like.</p><p>One of these days I&apos;d like to get Csound to actully make a sound, though.</p></div><h3><a id=4000 href="#4000">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2002 2:24:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think the idea of multiple choice for output, and automatic<br/>&gt; input conversion to ones own format from any of the others<br/>&gt; for input, and open source and a flexible file format<br/>&gt; so new things can be added easily (unlike midi where<br/>&gt; nothing gets added in normal course of events<br/>&gt; apart from new sysexes) are perhaps<br/>&gt; the main points.</p><p>How possible would conversion to Scala seq format be?</p></div>
