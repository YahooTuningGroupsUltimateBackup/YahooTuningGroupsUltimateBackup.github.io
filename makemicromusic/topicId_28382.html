There&apos;s a clarity to them that strings and other timbres muddy up,<br/>at least with my current capabilities.</p><p>--------<br/>Basics<br/>--------</p><p>This piece was composed in a subset of 24 tET that approximates ratios of<br/>2, 3, and 11: 0, 50, 200, 350, 550, 700, 1050, and 1200 cents.</p><p>This allows for three neutral triads: Each contains the intervals 1/1,<br/>11/9, and 3/2 (i.e., they are 18:22:27 chords), and they are rooted on the<br/>1/1, 11/9, and 3/2 intervals; in cents, these are approximated by<br/>0-350-700, 350-700-1050, and 700-1050-1250.</p><p>In addition, these tones allow for the 11/9, 11/8, and 11/6 above each of<br/>the three root tones (approximated by 0-350-550-1050, 350-700-900-1400, and<br/>700-1050-1250-1750).</p><p>c:     0<br/>c#:   50 = 11/8 stacked on 3/2 (down 1 octave).<br/>d:   200 = 11/6 stacked on 11/9 (down 1 octave).<br/>e:   350 = 11/9 stacked on 1/1.<br/>f:   550 = 11/8 stacked on 1/1. Also, 11/6 stacked on 3/2 (down 1 octave).<br/>g:   700 = 11/9 stacked on 11/9.<br/>a:   900 = 11/8 stacked on 11/9.<br/>b:  1050 = 11/6 stacked on 1/1.

I don&apos;t really love the sound of most 7-limit<br/>harmony, and I really don&apos;t like the sound of 11/7, so I limited myself to<br/>11/9, 11/8, and 11/6.</p><p>The second was fairly typical: playing triads with root movements going<br/>down by a third. In diatonic music, this includes things like G major --&gt; E<br/>minor --&gt; C major. I wanted to hear this with neutral triads.</p><p>This gives me six sets of notes:</p><p>root: 1/1<br/>* neutral chord = 1/1, 11/9, 3/2<br/>* 11-ratios = 11/9, 11/8, 11/6</p><p>root: 11/9<br/>* neutral chord = 11/9, 121/81, 11/6<br/>* 11-ratios = 121/81, 121/72, 121/54</p><p>root: 3/2<br/>* neutral chord = 3/2, 11/6, 9/4<br/>* 11-ratios = 11/6, 33/16, 11/4</p><p>Adding the octave, stripping out redundancy, and octave-reducing gives this<br/>scale:</p><p>  1/1<br/> 33/32<br/>121/108<br/>  9/8<br/> 11/9<br/> 11/8<br/>121/81<br/>  3/2<br/>121/72<br/> 11/6<br/>  2/1</p><p>Or, in cents:</p><p>  0.000<br/> 53.273<br/>196.771<br/>203.910<br/>347.408<br/>551.318<br/>694.816<br/>701.955<br/>898.726<br/>1049.363<br/>1200.000</p><p>You can see that two neutral thirds is almost a 3/2 (i.e., (11/9)*(11/9) =<br/>121/81 ~ 3/2), and that the 11/6 over 11/9 (121/54, or 121/108) is really<br/>close to 9/8. Both of these differences are eliminated by tempering out<br/>243/242.</p><p>I don&apos;t really depend on any other intervals in my composition, so I went<br/>looking for an EDO that tempered 243/242 and didn&apos;t do much damage to my<br/>other intervals. It turns out that 24 EDO is really good. I was surprised<br/>by that, since I haven&apos;t enjoyed much of the quarter-tone music I&apos;ve heard,<br/>but I followed the numbers.</p><p>And that, finally, brings me to my scale:</p><p>!

I liked the way it didn&apos;t<br/>really feel &quot;semi-algorithmic&quot; or whatever you called it, even though you<br/>apparently used some algorithmic techniques in its composition.<br/>Stylistically, it reminded me a little bit of one of Schoenberg&apos;s piano<br/>pieces, the Gigue from Op. 25: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJzwlkeXXoI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJzwlkeXXoI</a> .<br/>It&apos;s not similar, exactly, but something about the pace and the insistence<br/>of it, along with the wide variety of notes, made these two resonate in my<br/>inner ear.</p><p>Our two pieces are almost opposites, in some ways. Yours seems to have a<br/>lot of notes -- do you use all 24? -- and uses them frenetically, whereas<br/>mine is deliberately a little understated, with some gaps and rests in it,<br/>and has a narrower palette.</p><p>Interestingly, Tuesday&apos;s Child doesn&apos;t sound out of tune much to me,<br/>whereas my Lament has some of that out-of-tune weirdness to it in my ears.<br/>(That&apos;s part of what makes it sound plaintive to me.) I wonder how much of<br/>that is related to tuning vs. how much is related to the very brief<br/>lifespan of any given note in Tuesday&apos;s Child.</p><p>&gt; 24 edo is what most non-xenharmonists think is the next logical step (be<br/>&gt; that true or not..)</p><p>I think that&apos;s not true, but it&apos;s not as off-base as I thought it was at<br/>one point, either. For me, it&apos;s the 1/1-11/9-3/2 approximation that has<br/>really made me re-think that. This chord sounds as natural to me now as a<br/>just major chord does. It might be a &quot;gateway chord&quot; for some people into a<br/>wider tonal universe.</p><p>I think Igs posted something recently to the XA Facebook page about<br/>rethinking 24 EDO with an eye toward greater acceptance. I never realized<br/>that it wasn&apos;t cool. :)</p><p>Thanks for the listen and the comments, Chris. You&apos;re a great supporter of<br/>the people who post things to this list and the XA, and I appreciate it.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/18/2011 1:56:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jake,</p><p>Thank you for the Schoenberg - I enjoyed it!

Twice!</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of Schoenberg I don&apos;t like, but his piano music is<br/>great. Some of the things I enjoy in it are the same things I enjoy in<br/>Xenharmonic music. I have a recording of his work by Maurizio Pollini<br/>that seems really exceptional to me.</p><p>&gt; by inspection I believe the answer is yes I used all 24 notes</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean it like a challenge, by the way.</p><p>&gt; but not within the same octave close in time.</p><p>This is more what I meant. It seemed easy to get into, even with my<br/>less-xen-than-yours ears applied to it :) which led to me wondering<br/>how much of it was significantly different from 12-EDO. The answer<br/>seems like, &quot;globally, a lot; locally (in pitch or time), less so.&quot;<br/>That&apos;s interesting.</p><p>&gt; But the arpeggiator applies its own logic and in practice some close notes, even<br/>&gt; quarter tone embellishments are in fact sounded.</p><p>I definitely heard some, and I liked them. They added color without<br/>sounding out of tune.</p><p>It makes me wonder, for those times that we&apos;re showing people what<br/>&quot;xenharmonic&quot; or &quot;microtonal&quot; means, whether quarter-tone ornaments<br/>might not be the easiest way to evoke the sense that 100 cents is<br/>really wider than our minimum perception should be.</p><p>&gt; The semi-algorithmic technique was</p><p>Thanks for the explanation.</p><p>&gt; Interesting - I felt the xen-ness as emotive inflections</p><p>I agree to some extent, but my mind shifts between the two perceptions<br/>somewhat. Xen harmony sounds pretty solid, but melodies surprise me a<br/>lot. Sometimes that leads to a sense of being out of tune; sometimes<br/>it it leads to an emotional response; sometimes both.</p><p>One of Blackwood&apos;s etudes does both, the one in 15 EDO.  At about 1:41<br/>it lands on an impossibly flat note -- I know what note it should be,<br/>and it almost is that note, but it&apos;s not, and it can never be, even<br/>though it sort of is -- and the result is almost painful. Not just in<br/>an out-of-tune way, although I hear it as a strange note, but<br/>emotionally.

You<br/>probably have seen<br/>my posts where I discus the view that we need to look more deeply into<br/>melody despite<br/>the importance of xenharmony. I don&apos;t think one can exist without the other<br/>because<br/>even in monophonic music there is an implied harmonic structure and melody<br/>is<br/>in inescapable when playing harmony. So devices like harmonic entropy are<br/>incapable of capturing the entire experience despite their usefulness as<br/>tools that explains parts<br/>of the puzzle.</p><p>Save some lembas for me :-)</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Fri, Nov 18, 2011 at 5:47 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; by inspection I believe the answer is yes I used all 24 notes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t mean it like a challenge, by the way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but not within the same octave close in time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is more what I meant. It seemed easy to get into, even with my<br/>&gt; less-xen-than-yours ears applied to it :) which led to me wondering<br/>&gt; how much of it was significantly different from 12-EDO. The answer<br/>&gt; seems like, &quot;globally, a lot; locally (in pitch or time), less so.&quot;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting - I felt the xen-ness as emotive inflections<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree to some extent, but my mind shifts between the two perceptions<br/>&gt; somewhat. Xen harmony sounds pretty solid, but melodies surprise me a<br/>&gt; lot. Sometimes that leads to a sense of being out of tune; sometimes<br/>&gt; it it leads to an emotional response; sometimes both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of Blackwood&apos;s etudes does both, the one in 15 EDO. At about 1:41<br/>&gt; it lands on an impossibly flat note -- I know what note it should be,<br/>&gt; and it almost is that note, but it&apos;s not, and it can never be, even<br/>&gt; though it sort of is -- and the result is almost painful. Not just in<br/>&gt; an out-of-tune way, although I hear it as a strange note, but<br/>&gt; emotionally.
