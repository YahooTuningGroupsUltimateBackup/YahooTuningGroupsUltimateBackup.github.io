Which i think he would have enjoyed being taken into this territory.</p><p>Since i had 22 tone 11 limit just instruments . i explored non octave scales in much the same fashion which results in a bi-level set of intervals. Even after the sequence is determined,  where one starts in the sequence on an instrument will produce quite different results. Usually i could play through them all and narrow it down by purely empirical methods. This would take some time as often the whole sequence would not repeat till way beyond the range of the instrument.</p><p>Besides the music of Georgia,  another non octave language we can find in the field are Africa Ballophones (more of the 5 tone as opposed to the 7 tone) will have different intervals in the base. This has much to do with their language where they will speak in different ranges depending on both the subject and the emotional tone. Pretty much it was along this line that i attempted to line up my scale. Making it flaw from top to bottom is some reasonable way . As a whole i enjoyed the results of periods less than the octave more than those larger.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now we ask the question...what if we could make more complex chords &gt; A) that<br/>&gt; &gt; go beyond 5-limit type scales and are still able to be played on today&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments...or B) even leave the chromatic system behind entirely?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     To answer a possible solution for B)...recently I derived a &gt; scale that<br/>&gt; &gt; fits fairly closely into chromatic 12TET which is derived from the &gt; formula<br/>&gt; &gt; (1/octave)^x + 1 and features the tones:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ---C4 D4 E4 F#4 G4 (g is the period) A4 B4 C#5 D5 (d = period) E5 &gt; F#5 G#5 A5<br/>&gt; &gt; (a = period) B5 C#6 D#6 E6 (e = period) F#6 G#6 A#6 B6 (b = period) &gt; C#7 D#7<br/>&gt; &gt; F7 F#7 (f# = period) G#7 A#7 C8 C#8 (c# = period)---<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    It turns out Daniel Forro on the tuning list had derived the &gt; scale about<br/>&gt; &gt; 20 years ago.
