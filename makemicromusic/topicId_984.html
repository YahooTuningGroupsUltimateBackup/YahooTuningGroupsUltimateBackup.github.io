I really recommend<br/>the MAudio OmniStudio (<a href="http://www.midiman.net/">http://www.midiman.net/</a>) for approximately $390 in the<br/>spring. This will give your 4 1/4 inputs 2 S/PDIF on a break out box and<br/>another breakout box with 2 mic pres, inserts, and headphone control. All of<br/>this running via ASIO with minimal latency (~10ms).</p><p>The Delta 44 (4 in 4 out 1/4) can be had for $220 to $260. I had one for a<br/>month before travelling and it was wonderful.</p><p>Stay away from SBLives. There are issues with sound quality and latency (1<br/>second!!! This means absolutely no software synths!)) though I understand you<br/>can hack the drivers for low latency, but the sound quality issues are still<br/>present. I know... I have one and was stuck using it for almost two years. The<br/>frequency response that is goes to your monitors is weak compared to any 24/96<br/>card. I noticed a major improvement with the Delta 44.</p><p>I am getting in the Aardvark Q10 today ($689; 8 universal in; 1/4 or XLR; 2<br/>preamps for connecting high impedance instruments, guitars; 10 outputs; S/PDIF<br/>and midi; word clock)... Every time I hear a set of brakes from a big truck<br/>squeal outside my heart thumps.... ;)</p><p>I am selling my half of a sound system, so I will be getting the Presonus<br/>ACP-88 8 channel compressor and some good mic pres (Sytek or ATI used), and if<br/>I am lucky Tannoy System 800a monitors. Once you get a decent pro card it is<br/>time to think about what you can do before you get that signal into the<br/>computer (mic pres make a big difference along with compression)! I also have<br/>the FMR Audio RNC 1773 compressor and it works well and is the cheapest/good<br/>quality stereo compressor $175 from Mercenary Audio<br/>(<a href="http://www.mercenary.com/fmraudio.html">http://www.mercenary.com/fmraudio.html</a>)</p><p>For the latest in low cost/ but high performance check out the Metric Halo I/O<br/>(to be released soon at around $1200 I think);<br/><a href="http://www.mhlabs.com/index2.html">http://www.mhlabs.com/index2.html</a></p><p>Mytek (<a href="http://www.mytekdigital.com/">http://www.mytekdigital.com/</a>), is also coming out with a 2 channel<br/>stereo A/D (might need a digital card into the computer with S/PDIF or ADAT<br/>though) for $995 just before AES. This would be a choice for a high quality<br/>stereo interface.</p><p>I personally am still dreaming of the Cranesong Hedd-192. Um, yeah... Whoever<br/>buys me that one can also throw in their STC-8 compressor as well.... ;)</p><p>The lower cost 24/96 cards of course wont really get you 24 bits, but they are<br/>a world above consumer sound cards and the starting price is not much higher.</p><p>To go with your new pro card I really recommend Steinberg&apos;s Nuendo and Waves<br/>Native Gold plugin pack. The latest Waves update (3.21) allows me to run 6<br/>Renaissance reverbs (nice sounding!) on my 950 Athlon.</p><p>I have a spare 650 Athlon Slot A CPU sitting here. If anyone can use it it is<br/>available for mailing cost..</p><p>I might mention that I am more than willing to help master anyones projects on<br/>this list. I am willing to take on a couple for free too, so just get in<br/>contact!</p><p>Let the music roll out...</p><p>Oh, yeah... Here is the last track I created. I used Curtis Road&apos;s Pulsar<br/>Synthesis (Generator) and Audio Mulch and a couple of the Waves plugins in<br/>Nuendo to spatialize the samples.<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/cafe_orbital.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/cafe_orbital.mp3</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3><a id=986 href="#986">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/9/2001 6:49:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>the Delta 44.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am getting in the Aardvark Q10 today ($689; 8 universal in; 1/4<br/>or XLR; 2<br/>&gt; preamps for connecting high impedance instruments, guitars; 10<br/>outputs; S/PDIF<br/>&gt; and midi; word clock)...

I&apos;ve been a guitarist since 1973 and very</p><p>much enjoy studying music theory. I&apos;m about 1 1 /2 years into<br/>studying Tuning theory and among the many books I</p><p>have, I&apos;m currently using David Doty&apos;s book called, &quot;The JI Primer&quot;<br/>as my primary study guide.</p><p>Getting the JI stuff into my head using the computer has been a real<br/>uphill climb. I believe I&apos;ve finally found</p><p>two software products to get me started. They are Fractal Tune Smithy<br/>(FTS) and Scala.</p><p>Learning to write and compose music in various tunings are my current<br/>interests at this point in time. I need to</p><p>get started. After I master or at least get this medium of writing<br/>music on the computer to a successful stage, I plan on building a<br/>computer system that will be dedicated to music software. At that<br/>point I will definitely consider a high end sound card such as the<br/>Aardvark and Delta 44 as well a sequencer and ALLLLLLLLLL the other<br/>stuff that eventually falls in-line with this art.</p><p>But, and I pleeeeease stress BUT, I&apos;m starting from the ground floor<br/>and simply, simply want to hear ACCURATELY various<br/>tunings,frequencies and various chords so I can begin my journey.</p><p>I just finished building a computer for another purpose that is used<br/>for business. I&apos;m running win 2000 and it utilizes two P3 cpu&apos;s, two<br/>40 gig maxtor hard drives running raid mirror and a capability of up<br/>to 4 gigs of DDR S-DRAM memory. The downside (for music) is that the<br/>mother board has on-board sound (I know on-board is not good) but I<br/>knew this as the computer was built for another purpose. This<br/>motherboard also has the VIA chipset which I understand is not too<br/>music friendly but very user friendly for the business software I&apos;m<br/>currently running. The I understand the Intel 815EP chipset is the<br/>best for music. I have scala and FTS installed on this system and<br/>would appreciate if anyone can give me advice on a good entry level<br/>sound card to install on this sytem so it can accurately produce<br/>frequencies. Is a software syth such as Yamaha a good choice over say<br/>a PCI based sound card?</p><p>Anyway, I have my old Win95 machine that currently has the Sound<br/>Blaster AWE64 Gold sound card installed. Im going to install FTS and<br/>Scala on this machine as I was told that this sound card should<br/>perform ok to &quot;at least&quot; get me started.</p><p>Mike, I listened to your cafe orbital mp3 and found it really<br/>coooooooool. One of the best sounding mp3&apos;s I&apos;ve heard. I have  (what<br/>I thought) was a good speaker set up including a sub woofer yet my<br/>tweeters were barely able to reproduce the demanding sounds of your<br/>mp3. Good job!</p><p>Regards<br/>Wally</p></div><h3><a id=997 href="#997">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Even if you need to go to another SB card, you still shouldn&apos;t have to spend more than $50. As I keep yammering at some of the other correspondents, to start, to just hear how these tunings work, should not be a big hardware/software barrier to entry. And it isn&apos;t.
