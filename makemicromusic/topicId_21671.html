We&apos;re hearing lots of noise<br/>pieces, concrete pieces, etc. and want more pieces with pitch and rhythm,<br/>ESPECIALLY microtonal pieces. See the quoted message below for more context.<br/>The window is short, so now&apos;s your chance, if you haven&apos;t already.....but to<br/>reiterate--we are not looking for more noise/musique concrete pieces...we<br/>will pass over those, we have a ton already! we are looking especially for<br/>microtonal compositions, 60 seconds precisely, or less, with definite<br/>rhythmic elements if you can....this will contrast best with what we have<br/>already, which is a vast sea of noise pieces....</p><p>if you are interested, CONTACT ME PERSONALLY via my private email, and I&apos;ll<br/>give you and ID number and submission ftp details. I will not be combing the<br/>lists for responses here.......ok?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>AKJ</p><p>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br/>From: Vox Novus List &lt;voisey-i@...&gt;<br/>Date: Thu, Feb 4, 2010 at 9:22 AM<br/>Subject: [Voxnovus] Attention! TWO 60x60 calls - an urgent short<br/>announcement<br/>To: voxnovus@...</p><p>Attention!  TWO 60x60 calls - an urgent short announcement</p><p>FIRST CALL - is a last chance for 60x60 (2010)</p><p>It has come to my attention that there has been some confusion about the<br/>60x60 submission process.  I have decided to give ONE LAST CHANCE to submit<br/>to 60x60 for 2010.</p><p>If you have a piece you want to submit, write an email to<br/>support@... just tell me you want to submit a work to 60x60 with<br/>your first and last name as well as the country you reside in.  I will send<br/>you details how to submit.</p><p>This is NOT a wide call.  Do not post this announcement.  If you (or you<br/>know a friend/colleague) want to submit and didn&apos;t. the time is now!  This<br/>is only an opening for missed chances.  (by the way. this is ASAP I am not<br/>giving a deadline .per se. but I don&apos;t see me doing this past Sunday.) All<br/>aboard for 60x60!</p><p>For those who dabble in microtonal music, or reside in Canada or the United<br/>Kingdom, this year we are intending to do special mixes so if you haven&apos;t<br/>submitted.  60x60 has always been a great way to get pieces performed. (our<br/>statistics are like no other project/competition/festival)  But we are<br/>specifically looking for pieces this year for a special microtonal concert<br/>in Chicago,  a dance performance in Canada,  and a few performances in the<br/>United Kingdom.(hopefully including a dance performance)</p><p>SECOND CALL -  ORCHESTRA 60x60</p><p>Not to be confused with previous calls, Orchestra 60x60 is completely new<br/>for 60x60.  We are calling for completely acoustic 60 second works for<br/>orchestra.  No electronics, no amplification,  only live instruments.  We<br/>have 3 orchestras on board and a bunch sitting on the fence (I will convince<br/>them soon enough. at the moment I am concentrating on submissions;)   This<br/>IS a WIDE CALL!  Spread the 60x60 orchestra call far and wide.  Here are the<br/>details for the call:<br/><a href="http://www.voxnovus.com/orchestra60x60/data/composers.htm">http://www.voxnovus.com/orchestra60x60/data/composers.htm</a></p><p>*ALL COMPOSERS SHOULD SUBMIT TO THIS IF CAPABLE.*<br/>And I do mean all!  Yes, all.  Young, old, big career, little career, no<br/>career, write for orchestra all the time, never write for orchestra,<br/>basically if you can write a competent score for orchestra and have a 60<br/>second idea, you should submit something.</p><p>I started this idea with the same intention as I did with 60x60 and that is<br/>to promote composers, new music and create a venue for our music to be heard<br/>by ALL audiences.<br/>60x60 has been a growing phenomenon.   The success of the Orchestra 60x60<br/>project should change the landscape of new music, and the landscape of how<br/>orchestras approach contemporary composers, you know what!  It was designed<br/>with the vision of changing the landscape for orchestras; giving them an<br/>event to create a fresh exciting performance to improve their popularity to<br/>the entire public.  So this is it.  The link is above.  Read the guidelines<br/>write a piece and be part of the future.</p><p>Talk to you soon,</p><p>Rob</p><p>Robert Voisey</p><p>support@...<br/>60x60 Director<br/>Living Music Foundation Vice President<br/>Founder of Vox Novus<br/><a href="http://www.VoxNovus.com">http://www.VoxNovus.com</a></p><p>_______________________________________________<br/>VoxNovus mailing list<br/>VoxNovus@...<br/><a href="http://seven.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/voxnovus">http://seven.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/voxnovus</a></p><p>--</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
