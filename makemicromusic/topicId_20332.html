Only the drummer has any idea of what&apos;s going to happen before the tape starts to roll. :-) I&apos;m not much of a performer, really. But I&apos;ve been occasionally doing this sort of rambling improvisational stuff for my own amusement since the early 1970s -- the days when you had to do it with analog reel-to-reel tapes and sound-on-sound track bouncing. It&apos;s now much easier and the recording quality is uncompromised.</p><p>(Similar 12-equal stuff here, but it&apos;s off-topic for this list:<br/><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/SixGuys/index.html">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/SixGuys/index.html</a><br/>so if anyone asks, you didn&apos;t see the shameless plug.)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>   Rick</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2009 7:17:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A couple weeks ago I reported on the microtonal project I was working on, which is now finished...

Drum tracks were written out in Finale then rendered to WAV using Garritan Jazz &amp; Big Band library. That backbone was then layered with 5 to 7 tracks of improvisation using Garritan instruments (bass, horns, etc) played through Fractal Tune Smithy 3.0 using my own &quot;.tun&quot; files for tuning. Other than the drums, the &quot;chart&quot; for each piece is basically a few motivic ideas worked before recording. I added a bit of WusikStation and Rhino for a couple of synth sounds, likewise using the same tuning files. The talking bits are canned from the standard Windows voice. The whole was recorded and mixed with Adobe Audition at 32 bit/44.1kHz before the scrunch-down into 128k MP3 files. Spacial reverb was added to the final mix, not each layer, except for the muted trumpet part in one piece where I used a phaser/reverb effect to give it some extra distance.</p><p>   Rick</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2009 3:07:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry if I missed it, but did you publicize this here<br/>&gt; &gt; before the show?
