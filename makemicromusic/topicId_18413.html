It lets you just choose your CSound instruments for the sixteen midi channels from a list and FTS will automatically build a CSound orchestra incorporating them all - something that normally requires a fair amount of recoding and renumbering by hand.</p><p>It is easy to use - just select the CSound save type, choose the CSound instruments for all the parts of your piece from a drop list - and then record to CSound just as you would do to midi, by pressing a record button. Everything else is done automatically.<br/>see:<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/csound.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/csound.htm</a></p><p>Another feature likely to be of particular interest to microtonalists is the Audio Pitch tracer<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/pitch_tracer.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/pitch_tracer.htm</a></p><p>There&apos;s lot&apos;s more that&apos;s new to discover in this release. Most of all - I have done lots of work to make it more user friendly and easier to navigate.</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/fts_download.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/fts_download.htm</a></p><p>I hope this new release will be of value to the microtonal community, and more generally. I&apos;d like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for all those on this forum who have helped in one way or another over the years while I&apos;ve been developing the software, by discussing the work in progress, supplying information, suggesting ideas etc.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
