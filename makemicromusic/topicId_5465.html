Do you know softwares, &quot;thinking&quot; in a way supporting this? For example a guitar tuner, saving lots of tunings it measured through the tunings I create by ear, using (guitar signal) microphone input to send to the tuner?</p><p>I&apos;d love to browse website that thinks (mind to scale) or (mind to instrument tuning) and covers the practical and software issues of this working-way. I am a little confused by my impression, that &quot;given scales&quot; do rule the microtonality so much, instead of a fresh scale creation with every song.</p><p>Thanks for all helping answers!</p><p>Clemens</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=5470 href="#5470">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2003 12:20:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Clemens,</p><p>&gt; Do you know softwares, &quot;thinking&quot; in a way supporting this?<br/>&gt; For example a guitar tuner, saving lots of tunings it measured through the tunings I<br/>&gt; create by ear, using (guitar signal) microphone input to send to the tuner?</p><p>I did some preliminary work on a software approach to this in FTS<br/>- but more to be done there.</p><p>Two ideas I&apos;m exploring.<br/>1.
