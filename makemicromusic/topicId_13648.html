Personally, any program that requires me to stop whatever I&apos;m<br/>&gt;  doing and write command lines simply to alter some parameters is useless<br/>&gt;  for my own compositional purposes.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;  For someone with a more intuitive and<br/>&gt;  spontaneous approach to composing, spending more than a couple of<br/>&gt;  minutes changing parameters -- especially by text -- can be enough to<br/>&gt;  kill the flow of ideas.</p><p>Just a comment on working methods...</p><p>The learning curve for text-based interfaces is definitely steeper<br/>than GUIs, so that it&apos;s usually very slow going in the beginning, and<br/>the command line doesn&apos;t work well for everything.</p><p>However, some people might be surprised that, after gaining<br/>proficiency, text and commands can sometimes be significantly *faster*<br/>than mice and GUIs.  Also, scripts, batch-processing and data piping<br/>can make text apps far more flexible and customizable, both of which<br/>add up to speed of use, which means better flow of ideas.</p><p>So my encouragement to anyone looking at text tools is, if it&apos;s a<br/>useful program, take the time to learn the commands/syntax, because<br/>before long you&apos;ll be leaving your mouse-dependant friends in the dust<br/>;)</p><p>Not that I&apos;ve had the time to look at Strasheela yet...</p><p>-chris</p></div><h3>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2006 2:24:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>J.Smith escreveu:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Hudson Lacerda &gt; &lt;hfmlacerda@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Other people simply are not (enough) interested in algorithmic &gt; &gt; composition.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Quite so, Hudson.

I&apos;m not against &gt; the use of algorithmic tools per se....only that I would feel rather &gt; dishonest using them to create a work, and then take credit for it &gt; myself. This depends on which decisions one put on the hands of the computer program. I think algorithmic composition as a way to accomplish mechanical tasks not very suitable for a humain being, though clearly conceived by a humain being as composer, in special stochastic textures.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Novidade no Yahoo!
