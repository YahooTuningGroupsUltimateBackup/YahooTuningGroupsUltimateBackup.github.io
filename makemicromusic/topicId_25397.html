That seems wrong--it wouldn&apos;t be noticed at all!! Only electronic instruments approach that level of accuracy in their tuning/stability.</p><p>Also, just a side, off-topic note: it&apos;s funny to notice different posting styles of different folks, and I notice your addiction to ellipses, for example: &quot;da da arabic music...dadada...another though...yet another...closing thought...no biggie...best, Neil!!! :)</p><p>I get a kick out of noticing this kind of thing, never mind me. :)</p><p>AKJ</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Of course, it&apos;s important to remember that millions of musicians all over the world already use intervals outside of the western 12 tone scale.
