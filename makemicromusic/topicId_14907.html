It was very interesting to hear how the singers&apos; intonations differred. My ears could distinguish between two camps - most people sang something flat of 8:9 (I wasn&apos;t sure if it was 9:10 or some meantone) while the other camp preferred 8:9. The choir director kept letting different people sing Do and Re together until he got an 8:9 which he seemed to be satisfied with. That was on the fourth pair of singers. I tried to figure out what this means mathematically and it seems that very roughly we could estimate that 1/4 of singer pairs sing pythagorean do-re while the other 3/4 sing meantone do-re. If anyone wants to see the math I did let me know... (basically I assumed a geometric distribution and equated the expected value with the observed value.)</p><p>/ Magnus</p></div><h3>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2006 1:42:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow!
