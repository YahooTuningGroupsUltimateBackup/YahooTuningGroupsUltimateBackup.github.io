Using Scala I have been able to send tuning data (damn, though, limited to changing only one octave, not a full keyboard scale), but the problem is that in &quot;Performance&quot; mode, where you can multi-timbrally have different &quot;patches&quot; respond to different midi channels, it only seems to want to retune the first part (patch).</p><p>I&apos;ve tried various setting changes, including changes to the sysex send (in Sonar 2.1) and control channels in the JV. No luck so far, just hoping someone has a quick answer. Otherwise it&apos;s back to dicking around again tonight (but for a good cause, right?)...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
