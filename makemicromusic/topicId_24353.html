IE I don&apos;t like Madonna&apos;s music, but I can hear<br/>&gt; enough in it that I won&apos;t consider anyone who likes it &quot;needing elementary music<br/>&gt; lessons in tone and key&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;when these people have little interest in penetrating deeper into microtonality<br/>&gt;&gt; despite our very own collective<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; efforts as senior peers?&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;So far, I have not seen any systematic analysis or discovery of anything<br/>&gt;&gt; regarding acoustics from the newbie quarter. &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     You know...relative to people like yourself and Gene...even those like Igs<br/>&gt; are newbies.  And people like Sevish even more so.  And yet...I feel Sevish and<br/>&gt; Igs&apos;s work is on par with your own...not on &quot;technical prowess&quot;...but the<br/>&gt; greater purpose of emotional effect and balance.<br/>&gt;    Also if musical influence were so simple as who was there the longest...half<br/>&gt; of today&apos;s leading musicians would never exist.  My issue with the whole senior<br/>&gt; peers thing is not any lack of expertise...but rather that there seems to be a<br/>&gt; drive among them to pull the market to where they are rather than accommodate to<br/>&gt; what&apos;s actually there IE the skill is there but the direction...isn&apos;t quite<br/>&gt; there.<br/>&gt;    I view myself as the opposite...I trust I have the direction...but not the<br/>&gt; skill....hence I&apos;m trying to get those who do have the skill to listen IE<br/>&gt; compose with my tunings (and I mean starting songs from scratch, not retuning<br/>&gt; existing songs they&apos;ve made, which often works horrifically do to non-standard<br/>&gt; non-even intervals my scales use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;The proposed arguments just reek of pseudo-science wherever we turn... in<br/>&gt;&gt; grandiloquent parlour at that.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      And your compositional alternative is?  It would be easy to call their work<br/>&gt; pseudoscience...if it didn&apos;t mysteriously sound as or more amusing then your<br/>&gt; own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;For the fourth article, the whole matter should finally boil down to what you<br/>&gt;&gt; yourself aspire for your own enjoyment. Try to create something microtonal that<br/>&gt;&gt; you really are satisfied with, without grandiose motives<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; to influence anybody out there.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Good concept...only it seems to give birth to compositions with little<br/>&gt; longevity.  I tried that concept for a couple of years and loved it...but then<br/>&gt; came back years later and found myself dismissing my own music due to technical<br/>&gt; reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     For example...I can&apos;t even vaguely stand the bad production in my old works<br/>&gt; now that I know I need to do things like tune the drums on 5ths and 4ths or<br/>&gt; pieces with only 5 chords or melodies with an overly repeating pattern I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; notice when composing it, but certainly did 1 month later.<br/>&gt;    It seems having a &quot;second ear&quot; is key to a song&apos;s longevity.  Otherwise it<br/>&gt; seems you end up with something only good if you have the exact mood you had on<br/>&gt; the day you wrote it.  Heck, I&apos;d love to know exactly what motifs repeat in my<br/>&gt; 14TET piece because, at least for now, it sounds like a solo to me (in a good<br/>&gt; way)...though as time goes on I figure it will become clearer to me where the<br/>&gt; repetition is after I get &quot;un-used to it&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Let others like Igs and Chris have a go at the scales to demonstrate your<br/>&gt;&gt; points.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Exactly...  Hopefully this time around when I publish my Dimension^2 tuning<br/>&gt; I will have as good luck as when I published these &quot;bad&quot; tunings.  It seems when<br/>&gt; I try to make a good scale, people ignore it...but when I try to make a &quot;bad&quot;<br/>&gt; scale, people are all over it... :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Not that I expect those of us that make<br/>&gt;electronic music or rock have better chances of hitting it &quot;big&quot; with<br/>&gt;something microtonal, but perhaps there is at least a slightly wider<br/>&gt;audience who might be likely to stumble upon us.  Electronic music<br/>&gt;consumers are notorious for their ravenous appetites for new and<br/>&gt;obscure music.  Of course, as Carl pointed out, they&apos;re also an<br/>&gt;audience ill-suited to actually appreciate the alternative<br/>&gt;intonations, on account of the fact that much electronic music<br/>&gt;disregards pitch almost entirely.  Kind of a sad catch-22, I suppose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Igs</p><p>The genre is a natural for microtonalism, and I&apos;ve been suggesting<br/>for years that microtonality is likely to get its biggest popular<br/>start in electronica (and in fact, it has been more adopted there<br/>than elsewhere), for several reasons</p><p>1. It is forgiving, in the way I mentioned with respect to pitch.<br/>The relatively simple structures don&apos;t often have comma problems,<br/>etc. etc.  This makes it relatively easy to adopt microtonal<br/>tunings.  Yes, as you say, it also matters less, but you can&apos;t<br/>have cake and eat it.  The average electronic musician could<br/>probably switch to something like 19 in an afternoon.</p><p>2. The audience is forgiving.  While I criticized them for not<br/>being able to do analytic listening, in the past I&apos;ve praised them<br/>for their openness.  He who does not listen analytically hears<br/>everything as a timbre.  And that&apos;s also a lot less judgmental.<br/>Many fans of electronica have very refined tastes in listening<br/>to timbre -- they characterize the music in terms of &quot;sound&quot;.<br/>If it sounds cool, they will dig it.  They will not balk that the<br/>sixths sound wrong because they are not in 12-ET, as some<br/>conservatory-trained musicians might.</p><p>Ok, two reasons.  -C.</p></div><h3><a id=24382 href="#24382">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2011 12:59:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs:<br/>&gt;Ah, so by posting one piece of (what even I consider to be) mediocre<br/>&gt;music, I&apos;ve somehow extricated myself from your group of undesirables?<br/>&gt; I should advise ...

The mediocrity I try to evade<br/>is consigning myself to musical production &quot;devoid of luster&quot; for those<br/>self-imprisoned web niches whose taste for well-embroidered music is -<br/>well - stagnating. This, due more to an unchecked fetish into<br/>&quot;out-of-tuneness&quot; than anything else. Not that I brush away the niches<br/>as this one, it&apos;s just that I don&apos;t necessarily prioritize them for the<br/>consumption of my musics... at least I hope it won&apos;t stay that way when<br/>I can get an album or two into the mass music market (for which I must<br/>achieve a quality polish satifying my demands for perfectionism).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Have you even listened to actual &quot;microtonal&quot; songs in the Eastern world<br/>&gt;&gt; Michael? There are thousands. All this theorizing is moot without proper<br/>&gt;&gt; research into them. My work so far has roots and is based on systematic<br/>&gt;&gt; analysis of lengthy observations. These I have codified in the form of<br/>&gt;&gt; academic materials. They might not amount to anything in the real world<br/>&gt;&gt; perhaps, but I have incorporated these into working demonstrations and<br/>&gt;&gt; into my music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed, you have a mighty cultural advantage in some ways.  There was a time where I fooled myself into thinking that I might be able to acculturate myself to the music of another culture enough to become proficient...but after failed attempts at learning the cumbus, various instruments of the sundanese gamelan ensemble, the chinese guqin, and even an orchestral instrument of my (supposedly) &quot;own&quot; culture (the clarinet), I decided I lacked a certain empathic understanding necessary to truly make these unfamiliar musical traditions my own.  What else is a man to do in such straits, but to resign himself to his &quot;culture of one&quot; and develop it as thoroughly as he can?<br/>&gt;</p><p>That does not necessarily entail a shortcoming. It can be turned into an<br/>altogether distinct advantage. It would appear you are progressing well<br/>in that direction.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Your search for a scale or scales that will somehow sound &quot;out-of-tune&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; enough to be microtonal and yet &quot;in-tune&quot; enough to be mysteriously<br/>&gt;&gt; accepted by the masses sounds like a fantasy - if not a contradiction in<br/>&gt;&gt; terms - to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fantasy it might be--and as much as I doubt Michael&apos;s scales are likely to catch on, I can&apos;t deny I&apos;ve witnessed (in other areas of life) many people arrive at success on nothing but the strength of a dream and some gumption, in the face of many nay-sayers.  It will be history that decides which of us were following the path to success and which others were following mere flights of fancy.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok.

If<br/>&gt; anything...I&apos;m trying to open Westernized music to being less strictly,<br/>&gt; well....Westernized.  :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Have you even listened to actual &quot;microtonal&quot; songs in the Eastern world<br/>&gt;&gt; Michael?&quot;<br/>&gt;    To be honest, I&apos;ve been limited so far mostly to my exposure to your own<br/>&gt; music.  But why is this such a horrid crime?<br/>&gt;    Counter example: my guess is you probably know all of the intervals used in<br/>&gt; Western blues music and/or at least intervals within a few cents of all of them,<br/>&gt; but not by their formal American names.  Now what if I asked you &quot;have you<br/>&gt; listened to American blues and know how/why it uses microtonality (or how it&apos;s<br/>&gt; Afircan roots were derived?&quot;<br/>&gt;    More than likely, you&apos;ve worked mathematically with all the intervals involved<br/>&gt; in blues, even composed with them...but don&apos;t know their formal names/purposes<br/>&gt; in that culture.  Does that suddenly make your efforts with such intervals in<br/>&gt; music invalid, just because you missed the precise cultural context?  Of course<br/>&gt; not...in fact you&apos;ve probably already composed something &quot;bluesy&quot; without even<br/>&gt; recognizing it...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Your search for a scale or scales that will somehow sound &quot;out-of-tune&quot; enough<br/>&gt;&gt; to be microtonal and yet &quot;in-tune&quot; enough to be mysteriously accepted by the<br/>&gt;&gt; masses sounds like a fantasy - if not a contradiction in<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; terms - to me.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     I&apos;ve said countless times...I don&apos;t believe in &quot;in-tune&quot; vs.<br/>&gt; &quot;out-of-tune&quot;...I believe in different ways to moderate tension in music.  My<br/>&gt; &quot;pseudo-scientific&quot; assumption is that there may be, gasp, more than one way to<br/>&gt; mediate tension in tunings beside using 12TET.<br/>&gt;    You seem to be arguing &quot;it&apos;s considered fast in America because it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; Corvette&quot; while I&apos;m arguing &quot;the car is fast because of any combination of high<br/>&gt; power, low weight, good aerodynamics, the incline of the surface it&apos;s rolling<br/>&gt; on, the wind behind it...and perhaps even other factors that can occur in things<br/>&gt; other than just Corvettes, cars, or even vehicles (IE light is fast)&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;P.S. By newbies, I meant not music-makers like Sevish or Igs, but<br/>&gt;&gt; theory-rackers like Marcel, Mike and yourself.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Just because you don&apos;t like my music does NOT mean I don&apos;t make music...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

There are also old horror stories (kaidan), ninja stories and still living tradition of folk story tellers (rakugo). Enough sources for comics, manga and anime - first cartoon films were produced about 1917. From later probably everybody knows turtle ninjas, or different huge creatures destroying cities (Gojira &amp; company). or sci-fi and robot series...</p><p>But it&apos;s true there&apos;s a lot of influences from American pop culture, especially after WWW 2. (Unfortunately also Japanese language is terribly polluted from English, despite the fact that English knowledge is rather poor here.) Good example is Japanese Superman for children called Anpanman - who looks more like antihero or caricature (anpan is type of Japanese donut or bread with sweet soya paste filling)...</p><p>Lot of anime or manga also found inspiration in European culture and steal many motifs from old myths, or only superficially just some names, and combine them freely which is often rather funny (Phoenix, Laputa etc.).</p><p>Concerning J-pop, it&apos;s greatly influenced by all styles of contemporary Western pop/rock/jazz/fusion/folk/country... Western influence on Japanese music started in Meiji era since 70ies in 19th century, when composers were sent to the West to study Western music. Lot of school educational, nationalist or propaganda artificial songs - shoka - in Western style from those times are still well known here and serve as a kind of folklore. There are German, Italian, English, French, Mediterranean and Russian music influences. Some of them are more original, and use Japanese or Chinese pentatonics for melody with Western harmonization. Later enka style is deeply influenced by Russian and Greek music as well as French chanson.</p><p>Japanese TV NHK has a tradition of broadcasting few long concerts during New year season. This year I have mentioned some new trends and tendencies - big groups using playback accompaniment and dancing, usually only female (some even very young) or male, up to 30 or so members. Generally artistic quality of music itself was very poor in comparison with older styles (one of those programs was a big retrospective of older winning songs from last 50 years). Totally boring. And nothing interesting or original, all only poor copies of American music. It&apos;s a pity Japanese are ashamed to use elements of their own rich culture. It&apos;s a pity that we foreigners living here in Japan must remind them about their own history and music, or even show them how to use it or combine with contemporary art.</p><p>Sometimes some people try to protest against Westernization, Americanization or globalisation. But nothing can be done. Problem is not that there is strong impact of this culture. I see the main problem in the fact, that local people don&apos;t care about their own culture, and just passively accept what is offered. They don&apos;t mind. They want to be westernized. They want to be uniform. They don&apos;t want to be unique, original, interesting.  Same in India, China...

It is forgiving, in the way I mentioned with respect to pitch.<br/>&gt; The relatively simple structures don&apos;t often have comma problems,<br/>&gt; etc. etc.  This makes it relatively easy to adopt microtonal<br/>&gt; tunings.

People interested in microtonality are<br/>happy to have a lot more possibilities as composers or listeners.<br/>There&apos;s nothing like mistake in music composition concerning used<br/>material, and mistakes in compositional process can be even used<br/>intentionally.</p><p>It&apos;s funny to suppose that many common listeners who are unable to<br/>distinguish major third from minor will complain about commatic<br/>&quot;mistakes&quot;.</p><p>&gt;    But the flip side is &quot;how many original ideas can you get with<br/>&gt; the missing<br/>&gt; notes...before you end up with something sounding largely copied<br/>&gt; and barely<br/>&gt; original?  Thank the Lord we aren&apos;t still stuck in something so<br/>&gt; simple as<br/>&gt; pentatonics or, perhaps even &quot;worse&quot;, Gregorian Chant.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, but you are wrong, because evidently you have no knowledge<br/>about Gregorian Chant. After some deeper study you will be surprised<br/>how complex and rich music it is. I have studied few years and it&apos;s a<br/>great base even for contemporary composition.</p><p>Same with pentatonics, there are many things good composer can do<br/>with it.</p><p>BTW development of music was not linear (like development of<br/>language), so it&apos;s not possible to argument that earlier, older music<br/>is worse because it&apos;s underdevelopped, or more simple than later<br/>music. We can find very complex, interesting and inspirative things<br/>in some historical periods or made by some experimental composers.<br/>Those people found very original things and used them to their<br/>limits, which could lead them to very typical closed style and cul-de-<br/>sac. They were always ahead of their times. And later some of main-<br/>stream composers of synthetic type used some of their principles in<br/>synthesis with lot of other ideas.</p><p>I personally consider those experimental composers to be my living<br/>contemporary colleagues.</p><p>&gt;    I think the advantages of convincing musicians to go beyond<br/>&gt; 12TET....are<br/>&gt; similar in magnitude to the advantages of the diatonic scale over the<br/>&gt; pentatonic...and the increasing difficulties also similar.  But<br/>&gt; would it be<br/>&gt; worth it and would most musicians, given the chance, ultimately<br/>&gt; welcome the<br/>&gt; change once they&apos;ve seen what it can do?  I have virtually no doubt...</p><p>In music everything is usable. Microtonality, chromatics, diatonics<br/>and pentatonics coexist together.

For sure not  for money, just<br/>&gt;because it became fashionable.&quot;</p><p>    But you see...that&apos;s the sad fact.  That people often frame the &quot;standards&quot;<br/>for microtonality in such a way people can get away with that.  We all too often<br/>seem to say &quot;microtonal = good&quot; and leave the standards at that.</p><p>    Personally...I&apos;m very critical.  Granted, I rate songs largely by the<br/>ability to balance tension (definitely not the only way to encourage<br/>&quot;quality&quot;)...<br/>  But the good side of this (IMVHO) is that to do that one either has to know<br/>theory by ear or say by just intonation or by recurrent sequences (where often<br/>the tension stays relatively constant...neither very consonant nor dissonant):<br/>it can&apos;t be faked!</p><p>    Even with songs like Igs&apos;s, which are composition-ally very well done and<br/>usually within JI theory, I will point out anything that feels shaky vis-a-vis a<br/>12TET piece done by someone who genuinely knows what they are doing<br/>theory-wise.  So for example...even some of Igs&apos;s melodically and phrase-wise<br/>very well composed songs I&apos;ll still admit I&apos;m scratching my head due to certain<br/>aspects of the tuning he selected.</p><p>    So you&apos;d better bet when I hear something that feels unstable IE someone<br/>jamming on random keys in 19TET after they heard it was a &quot;popular&quot; tuning<br/>saying they are &quot;trying to create an alternative world of tension&quot; I&apos;m going to<br/>say &quot;well...you met your goal...but it doesn&apos;t sound like you are doing anything<br/>well-planned far as music theory&quot;.</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;I feel much the same way a 12TET musician would feel if he could   only,<br/>say, use 5 notes of the seven in each key IE pentatonic scale.&quot;<br/>Daniel&gt;&quot;Intentional limitations are good for inspiration and stimulating<br/>creativity, I use this attitude in composition. Stravinski would   agree with me<br/>:-)<br/>   For inspiring short parts of a song (IE basing a &quot;complex sounding&quot; part of a<br/>tetrachord and inversions of it), sure, but for a limitation for the whole<br/>song?! I seriously have my doubts...  I have yet to hear a Stravinski song that<br/>doesn&apos;t ultimately cover a plethora of chords...not to mention (usually) keys IE<br/>bi-tonality.</p><p>Daniel&gt;&quot;Never heard such complains. People interested in microtonality are happy<br/>to have a lot more possibilities as composers or listeners.  &quot;<br/>  Of course the ones &quot;on board&quot; are...but the counter-question is...how many<br/>people &quot;jumped overboard&quot; before they could become a part of said group soon as<br/>they realized how much more complexity they &quot;might&quot; have to deal with?</p><p>&gt;&quot;It&apos;s funny to suppose that many common listeners who are unable to  distinguish<br/>&gt;major third from minor will complain about commatic  &quot;mistakes&quot;.&quot;<br/>   The flip side is major and minor both use relatively simple dyads...and the<br/>dissonance difference between those sets of dyads, at least to my ears, is very<br/>minor to, say, that of a wolf fifth (IE one 20 cents or so too low).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but you are wrong, because evidently you have no knowledge  about<br/>&gt;Gregorian Chant. After some deeper study you will be surprised  how complex and<br/>&gt;rich music it is. &quot;<br/>  Maybe I just haven&apos;t heard enough of it?  From the few examples I heard it was<br/>just some very simple, very pure sounding chords and I heard its use of<br/>intervals used was limited to only the purest few IE 2/1,3/2,4/3...</p><p>&gt;&quot;BTW development of music was not linear (like development of  language), so<br/>&gt;it&apos;s not possible to argument that earlier, older music  is worse because it&apos;s<br/>&gt;underdevelopped, or more simple than later  music.&quot;</p><p>   From what I&apos;ve heard...after the 1900&apos;s or so the general state of music<br/>actually began to get simpler on the average.  I&apos;m no music history buff...but<br/>isn&apos;t it true that at some time in the past (I think medieval?!) there were<br/>actually many people who believed tri-tones and wolf fifths were actually<br/>created by the devil and thus completely avoided them in songs thus making for<br/>scales with only very simple intervals?</p><p>  Then again, I know some of the scales and forms the Greeks invented far before<br/>that were anything but simple...and often had 7+ tone scales and hints they used<br/>polyphony and/or full chords.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In music everything is usable. Microtonality, chromatics, diatonics  and<br/>&gt;pentatonics coexist together. We can&apos;t say pentatonics is dead  and unusable...&quot;<br/>  Agreed, but I&apos;m saying I don&apos;t believe EXCLUSIVELY limiting oneself to a<br/>certain limited style, scale...actually helps one be as productive musically as<br/>they could be.  Pentatonics, for example, I agree can be very useful for<br/>inspiration or individual parts...but saying all things must be limited to<br/>pentatonics I believe can only hurt.  And same goes for 12TET vs. microtonal IE<br/>12TET may be useful for inspiration but saying something like &quot;there&apos;s no reason<br/>for popular musicians to go beyond it for inspiration or adding to what they<br/>found in 12TET&quot; does not make any sense to me as to how it can help musicians.</p><p>&gt;&quot;We can&apos;t say pentatonics is dead and unusable because it&apos;s older than diatonics<br/>&gt;which offered more<br/>&gt;<br/>possibilities, or diatonics is dead because &quot;better&quot; chromatics came,  and now<br/>all this is dead and unusable old junk because almighty  microtonality came...&quot;</p><p>  Of course not, but would you honestly tell a musician &quot;stick to only<br/>pentatonics for all your songs...you&apos;ll produce better music that way?&quot; or<br/>&quot;stick to 12TET...because microtonality&apos;s extra tones can only help you make<br/>mistakes vs. what people expect/want to hear vs. 12TET?&quot;</p><p>   And of course, as mentioned before, microtonal music IE 31TET was commonly<br/>used before 12TET took over...like you said older does not always mean less<br/>advanced.  I don&apos;t think the battle is about newer vs. older...but rather that<br/>the way to stay &quot;safe&quot; far as making more publically well received music is<br/>A) To stick with only systems popularly used in the present...after all if it&apos;s<br/>not broke don&apos;t fix it<br/>OR<br/>B) To say that any system, including microtonality and from the past, present,<br/>or cutting edge IE new-microtonal scales...can lead to more compositional<br/>freedom<br/>......and that the obstacle is.........<br/>C) People may give up on microtonality thinking &quot;No thanks, 12TET is hard<br/>enough...&quot;  My brother even said this...and he&apos;s a professional jazz guitarist<br/>(not exactly the easiest technical genre).</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24593 href="#24593">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2011 9:28:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Debussy, Skriabin, Sch&ouml;nberg,  Varese, Partch, Ligeti...
