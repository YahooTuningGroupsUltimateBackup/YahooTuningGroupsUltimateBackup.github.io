What a crackup this piece is.<br/>&gt;&gt; Is this the first we&apos;ve heard of your work?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Jeff-</p><p>&gt; Are you using &quot;royal We&quot;? :)</p><p>Hey Kris,</p><p>No; just meant &apos;first you&apos;ve posted publically&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Actually I did post a couple of<br/>&gt; sound files sometime last fall.</p><p>Right, that&apos;s why I was asking; I wanted to check if<br/>I&apos;d missed anything, which it seem I did. There were<br/>a few times in the fall that I wasn&apos;t keeping up with<br/>the lists due to various things that were happening.</p><p>&gt; I could post em again soon if you missed them -- let me know.</p><p>Yes please -- maybe upload them to Jon&apos;s <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a><br/>server? I keep meaning to try it too but then I forget<br/>at the last minute when I get into my routine of<br/>fumbling with yahoo/geo.</p><p>&gt; One was a silly little<br/>&gt; guitar thing in 11ET.  The other was a clip from a group<br/>&gt; improvisational piece performed in Dec 2000.</p><p>Pretty sure I missed those and they do sound<br/>interesting.</p><p>&gt; The reactions to &quot;Four Quarters&quot; are amusing.  I hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really thought about it, but I suppose it is kinda warped.  I<br/>&gt; started just playing little patterns wherever there was a<br/>&gt; 36/35 quarter-tone on my JI fretboard</p><p>Yeegs!</p><p>&gt; and (sort of) worked<br/>&gt; out a sketch around it.  Listening back to it I realize that<br/>&gt; hammering on those small intervals (rather than picking each<br/>&gt; note) just gives it a wavering, bending sound rather than<br/>&gt; clear distinct notes.  But I guess that&apos;s ok.</p><p>It sounded pretty wacked out! (a good thing)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Keep it coming; would love to hear some recent works too if<br/>&gt;&gt; at all possible.</p><p>&gt; The 11ET thing was the most recent thing to wind up on tape.<br/>&gt; I just recently got the guitars out again after having to<br/>&gt; store them away for a few weeks... long story.  I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; noodling a little bit but not &quot;working&quot; on anything.  I could<br/>&gt; just let the tape run while improvising out of the blue, but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not necessarily what I like to share in public.</p><p>I think we all have that issue &amp; I don&apos;t know the<br/>answer. I usually listen to a piece for a couple days<br/>to make sure it&apos;s not totally boring and that there is<br/>some point to it. Some times something will sound<br/>really cool right after I put it together and a day or<br/>two later I wonder what I could have seen in what now<br/>appears to be aimless doodling or simple melodies atop<br/>homogenous block chords. For me I think the solution is<br/>to shame myself into putting together more thought-out<br/>pieces.</p><p>&gt; Generally the more recent it is, the more clumsy it will<br/>&gt; be...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m also tempted to put up a couple of pre-microtonal items--<br/>&gt; possibly in the metatuning folder?-- just for fun.  Actually<br/>&gt; there&apos;s enough sliding around between notes to possibly<br/>&gt; justify a microtonal label.</p><p>Well, I wouldn&apos;t mind hearing a bit of your older<br/>stuff. But hope some new stuff is coming too if you can<br/>work it out there.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
