It<br/>probably has something to do with Chowning&apos;s tuning that Margo mentioned<br/>today, and therefore the reason why Yamaha FM synths have golden ratios<br/>built in.</p><p>&gt; This can be enchanced by using distorsion or acoustical<br/>&gt; cross-vibrations.

I avoided distortion because I thought it would *spoil* the<br/>effect.  I&apos;ll have another look sometime ...</p><p>Oh, the timbre for &quot;the broken talisman&quot; I put in the Crazy Music Files<br/>area goes one step further.  The partials are tuned according to golden<br/>horagram ratios, and weighted according to how far up the scale tree they<br/>occur.</p><p>                             Graham</p></div>
