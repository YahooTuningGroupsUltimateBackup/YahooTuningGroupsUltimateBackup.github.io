My solution has been to get up really early and<br/>do my thing before everyone else gets up (wife and two kids and<br/>they all like to have some attention, as do I, but I need some<br/>SSSSPPPPAAACCCCEEEEE too).</p><p>When the kids get older, it gets a little easier. Just<br/>enjoy the hell out of them while they are little cause you<br/>only get that once.</p><p>Then they hit 13 and just when you thought they were growing up,<br/>suddenly they are back to being three years old in terms of the<br/>amount of parental worry and watching they need. Except that<br/>they are big and angry instead of little and cute.</p><p>Now I do a fair amount on the weekend too. I used to do some<br/>creative stuff on public transportation back and forth to work,<br/>then when I started driving, I got an instrument I could play<br/>in the car.</p><p>But wedging things in doesn&apos;t get symphonys written, it does<br/>match my improvisor+halfwrittenleadsheet way of doing things.<br/>(which came first???)</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
