In doing so, you would expect a perfectly tuned scale.  Ok,<br/>let&apos;s tune one.  For the sake of simplicity, we&apos;re going to start our<br/>tuning at a frequency of 100hz and we&apos;ll call it &apos;c&apos; even though a<br/>real &apos;c&apos; would be closer to 130-something.  The first fifth would be<br/>tuned by ear by adjusting the pitch until a completely clear tone is<br/>produced with no beats.  (Beats are that &apos;wah wah&apos; sound that happens<br/>when your kids elementary school band is &apos;tuning up&apos;.) If you put an<br/>electronic frequency analyzer on the string you tuned, you would find<br/>it vibrating &apos;g&apos; at exactly 150hz.</p><p>Mathematically, that&apos;s the fundamental (100hz) times 3 (300hz for the<br/>second harmonic), divided by 2 to drop it back into the same octave<br/>as your starting pitch.  This relationship is frequently expressed in<br/>terms of the ratio 3:2. If you had the luxury of a tuning hammer and<br/>a professional tuner to repair the damage, you could assault your own<br/>piano.  I don&apos;t recommend it.  Since we can&apos;t demonstrate this<br/>process auditorially, let&apos;s do the math for the rest of the scale.<br/>Tune the next fifth up - 150 * 3 = 450/2 = 225, still more than an<br/>octave above the starting pitch, so we&apos;ll drop it another octave to<br/>112.5 &apos;d&apos;.  Moving on up... 112.5 * 3= 337.5 / 2 = 168.75 &apos;a&apos; * 3 =<br/>506.25 / 2 = 253.125 / 2 = 126.5625 &apos;e&apos; * 3 =   379.6875 / 2=<br/>189.84375 &apos;b&apos; * 3 =  569.53125 / 4( see footnote 3 ) =<br/>142.3828125 &apos;f#&apos; * 3 =  427.1484375 / 4 =  106.787109375 &apos;c#&apos; * 3 =<br/>320.361328125 / 2 =  160.1806640625 &apos;g#&apos; * 3 =  480.5419921875 / 4 =<br/>120.1354980469 &apos;d#&apos; * 3 =  360.4064941406 / 2 =  180.2032470703 &apos;a#&apos;<br/>* 3 =  540.6097412109 / 4 =  135.1524353027 &apos;e#(f)&apos; * 3 =<br/>405.4573059082 / 2 =  202.7286529541 &apos;c&apos;.<br/>OOPS!  Do you see the problem?  Earlier, we predicted (guided by well<br/>understood and established laws of physics) the octave above c(100)<br/>would be c(200).  When we ran the practical proof, using a circle of<br/>perfectly tuned fifths, we ended up at c(202.7286529541), wide by<br/>nearly 3 cycles!</p></div><h3><a id=4072 href="#4072">ðŸ”—</a>pasport197 &#x3C;pasport197@...&#x3E; &#x3C;pasport197@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2003 10:46:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; on 1/3/03 10:37 PM, X.
