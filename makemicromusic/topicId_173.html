I personally don&apos;t have a really huge problem with<br/>piracy of software. If Sytrillium has any brains whatsoever, they must<br/>realize that sending out a demo that contains the entire program, etc,<br/>and only needs a little code... jeez, I mean, technically, they ARE<br/>giving away the whole program for free. It DOES reside on your computer,<br/>only in a somewhat (and temporarily) inaccessable form. Philosophically,<br/>it is interesting, but I will be honest, I haven&apos;t thought about it that<br/>much because I haven&apos;t felt the need to prove anything to myself. Yes,<br/>it is piracy, no I&apos;m not too concerned.</p><p>Also: I&apos;m curious why it matters from which companies one pirates...<br/>some MMMers seem to feel that pirating is okay as long as it is from one<br/>of the bigger companies.
