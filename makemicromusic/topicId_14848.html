If we were to graph the<br/>trigonometric function of &quot;sine&quot; over a horizontal<br/>range of 0 to 360 degrees, we would &iuml;&iquest;&half;nd the exact same<br/>pattern:</p><p>1.2.

This means,<br/>as already noted, that a &quot;spherical music&quot; may<br/>eventually express the evolution toward a world-wide<br/>acceptance of a common tonal system, perhaps the<br/>Mercator, equal-tempered 53 tones-to-the-octave scale<br/>within the overall mathematical perimeter of the<br/>circle of fifths&quot;...</p><p>(Correspondences, File, &quot;30 Unique Divisions&quot;).</p><p>...&quot;the binary aspect of the octave intervals of the<br/>tonal spiral requires a Boolean algebra&quot;.<br/>Dr. Andrew Pikler, International Congress on<br/>Acoustics, Tokyo, Aug. 1968, Generation and Plotting<br/>of Musical Tone System with the Digital Computer.</p><p>...&quot;possibility of a &quot;double helix&quot; in the domain of<br/>the musical tone system...the &quot;sharps&quot; and &quot;flats&apos;<br/>furnish helical formations, each separately split with<br/>the Pythagorean comma&quot;...<br/>Dr. Andrew Pikler.</p><p>43.2 &quot;1, 2, 3 and 5 &quot;</p><p>&quot;Harold&apos;s concept of giving a measure number to<br/>opposite forces (yin-yang) in order to describe them,<br/>seems to relate to music, that is:</p><p>If a note in a minor key is at once the same sound and<br/>a different sound, it must be more or less of one<br/>sound. Therefore...if...a minor key...represents<br/>negative, and a major key represents positive...<br/>Harold&apos;s theory assigns 2 as the measure number of the<br/>minor, 3 as the measure of the major, and 5 as the<br/>measure of wholeness or the 1 sound that can be played<br/>in either the major or minor key- but cannot be played<br/>in both at the same instant of time&quot;.</p><p>If the foregoing is true, we ourselves cannot make the<br/>1 sound, with the measure number 5, until we strike a<br/>chord:</p><p>3 (+ major) and 2 (- minor).</p><p>Harold&apos;s description of the nuclear force of the<br/>hydrogen atom can be read as 3(+) / 2(-). It would<br/>say, &quot;that a chord can be struck using a formula that<br/>could read:</p><p>2(-) / 3(+), or 3(+) / 2(-),</p><p>these 2 would not sound alike, but either would convey<br/>the sound of wholeness.<br/>================================<br/>Natural Musical Scale Derived From Vesica Pisces</p><p> In the process of going from One to Two, a Circle<br/>with a diameter length has a single vibration, but<br/>when another Circle is added interesecting it in its<br/>center, a Vesica Pisces is formed. This is the area<br/>that it shares which looks like the female generative<br/>organ, and from where in sacred geometry  all things<br/>come from. Part of the reproductive creative process<br/>How natures multiplication and reproduction came about<br/>from One to Many Vibrations that we see and feel and<br/>hear.</p><p>    If there was a string across the diameter of our<br/>first circle, that could be our base frequency of<br/>1,The second circle makes the Vesica Pisces, and<br/>extends the distance to 1.5 times the first. Therefore<br/>any frequency times 1.5 gives a pitch that is in tune<br/>with the original pitch or vibration.<br/>     And then if we continue on with the construction<br/>of a new Vesica Pisces by the mating of two circles,<br/>it makes a new larger circle of 2.25 times larger than<br/>our original circle. And so if we half this diamter,<br/>into a range between 1 and 2, it is 1.125. Therefore<br/>any original frequency sounds in tune with that<br/>frequency times 1.125. And lo and behold we can go on<br/>making twelve notes between 1 and its octave of 2.<br/>1.125 being the B note on the piano.<br/>    Therefore using this same process we get a table,<br/>as seen on the left, with each of its corresponding<br/>notes that are all harmoniously in tune with each<br/>other, and now you know why.</p><p>Circle Diameter    Ratio        Note     Hertz<br/>1 = 1                1            A       440<br/>2 = 1.5             1.5           E       659<br/>3 = 2.25           1.125          B       494<br/>4 = 3.375          1.69           F#      743<br/>5 = 5.062          1.265          C#      554<br/>6 = 7.539          1.88           G#      827<br/>7 = 11.39          1.42           D#      622<br/>8 = 17.08          1.06           A#      466<br/>9 = 25.62          1.59           F       698<br/>10=38.44           1.19           C       523<br/>11=57.66           1.79           G       787<br/>12=86.49           1.35           D       582</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

I discovered &quot;Lucy Tuning&quot; a few<br/>days ago by typing what seemed to be key words and phrases taken<br/>from my hands-on experiments with a fretless guitar and the idea,<br/>whether it&apos;s sci-fi or not, that the number 22 in the Indian Sruti<br/>system originates in the 22/7 rational approximation of Pi. The<br/>beginning of the process is described in real-time, warts and all,<br/>in the &quot;Shake Yer Sruti&quot; thread at the Alternate Tuning group.</p><p>Got the &quot;sharp 3d&quot; right away, very convenient because I&apos;m working<br/>on refining a close-to equal 17-tone tuning which of course has high<br/>3ds. Now with the computer I&apos;m continuing, but ignoring what I<br/>consider to the meaningless division of a circumfrence into 360<br/>degrees. One experiment generated a tuning averaging out about 2<br/>cents different than one of Margo Schulter&apos;s tunings in the Scala<br/>archive and about 4 cents from one of my own which I did basically<br/>by ear.</p><p>Been reading Margo Schulter&apos;s archived posts on the groups because<br/>my &quot;what sounds best to me&quot;-based approach to tuning coincides<br/>amazingly with work she&apos;s already done over the years and I&apos;ll now<br/>be able to save a lot of reinventing the wheel, so to speak. Most<br/>importantly, her articles on the real-life USE of tunings are a<br/>treasure; this is no small or idle matter for someone playing live<br/>and recording outside the 12-tET dictatorship.</p><p>Using a circle/spiral of fifths derived from spherical/circular<br/>relationships is just one possibility, there are plenty of others.</p><p>By the way, this is all, actually, Just Intonation, like it or not:<br/>it&apos;s just that it&apos;s coming not from an ideal string, but from an<br/>ideal POINT.</p><p>It&apos;s important to remember that Just Intonation isn&apos;t about numbers<br/>as such, it&apos;s about relationships between partials. The third partial<br/>may lie at 2.98001/2 on a real-life instrument, you could call<br/>it &quot;Aunt Mathilda&quot; or &quot;3/2&quot;, it doesn&apos;t matter as long as you don&apos;t<br/>confuse an idealized NAME (number) with reality. The work of William<br/>Sethares demonstrates this in a spectacular way.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dan Amateur<br/>&lt;xamateur_dan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the course of recent dialog with Charles Lucy,<br/>&gt; I have found myself fascinated with his work and<br/>&gt; related subjects.

The Circles Circumference to its diameter is as Two<br/>&gt; Octaves + Sharp 3rd to the Octave?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3.1416 to 1: So, as 3.1416 is to 1, so is .30103 to<br/>&gt; .09582<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Circles Circumference to Diameter is as the Octave<br/>&gt; (.30103) to Sharp 3rd (.09582)<br/>&gt; ===========<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Octave contains five larger notes and two lesser notes<br/>&gt; (but no actual major or minor notes)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Half the diameter = the larger note = .04791<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are four 5ths, each = .17447&#x9;.17447 x 4 = .69788<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Somehow, Harrison says this equals two octaves and<br/>&gt; a sharp 3rd, but I don&apos;t see the connection, how is<br/>&gt; this so?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each of the four 5ths can be generated by subtracting<br/>&gt; 5*radius from the circumference, the remainder = a<br/>&gt; spatial quantity equivalent to two equal lesser notes<br/>&gt; which = .06148, divide this by 2 = .03074<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subtract the lesser note (.03074) from the greater<br/>&gt; note (.04791)<br/>&gt; .04791 - .03074 = .01717<br/>&gt; This is not the same as minor half note, but may be<br/>&gt; called a tone major and or a tone minor<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A fifth must contain three of the larger notes and one<br/>&gt; of the lesser<br/>&gt; Fifth = .04791+.04791+.04791+.03074 = .17447<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are no ratios exisitng in this musical scale,<br/>&gt; except that of the octave itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chords are best described logarithmically<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can derive the ratio of any chord by  subtracting<br/>&gt; the logarithm of the lesser number from that of the<br/>&gt; greater<br/>&gt; This approach may cause differences from conventional<br/>&gt; ratios<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The resulting sounds will tend to &apos;sound better&apos; and<br/>&gt; this will be observed via the latitude of the flatness<br/>&gt; or sharpness of the resultant<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

----------<br/>&gt; Four 4ths and a sharp 3rd = Two octaves<br/>&gt; ----------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert Smiths Observations;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In  a monochord, the major 3rd to the fifth is as as<br/>&gt; the diameter of a circle, to its circumference.<br/>&gt; The octave =  five meantones and two limmas, making it<br/>&gt; a little bigger than six such tones, or three major<br/>&gt; 3rds.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; When he says &apos;six such&apos; tones, does he imply six<br/>&gt; &apos;meantones&apos; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The circumference of the circle is a little larger<br/>&gt; than three of its diameters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Time of a single vibration =  8 31/12/1748<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Any idea what this actually means, is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two musical strings with the same thickness, density<br/>&gt; and tension, differing in length only, the times of<br/>&gt; their vibrations are proportional to their lengths.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What happens if one or more of the other factors<br/>&gt; differ; thickness,density, tension?<br/>&gt; =============<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Came across the following, which seems to lend support<br/>&gt; to your Lucy Tuning based on pi and the circle, your<br/>&gt; thoughts on this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Octave as a Sine Wave  and 1.2 AC waveforms<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When an alternator produces AC voltage, the voltage<br/>&gt; switches polarity over time, but does so in a very<br/>&gt; particular manner. When graphed over time, the &quot;wave&quot;<br/>&gt; traced by this voltage of alternating polarity from an<br/>&gt; alternator takes on a distinct shape, known as a sine<br/>&gt; wave:<br/>&gt; +-&#x9;Time&#x9;Graph of AC voltage over time (the sine wave)<br/>&gt; In the voltage plot from an electromechanical<br/>&gt; alternator, the change from one polarity to the other<br/>&gt; is a smooth one, the voltage level changing most<br/>&gt; rapidly at the zero (&quot;crossover&quot;) point and most<br/>&gt; slowly at its peak. If we were to graph the<br/>&gt; trigonometric function of &quot;sine&quot; over a horizontal<br/>&gt; range of 0 to 360 degrees, we would &macr;nd the exact same<br/>&gt; pattern:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.2.

Therefore...if...a minor key...represents<br/>&gt; negative, and a major key represents positive...<br/>&gt; Harold&apos;s theory assigns 2 as the measure number of the<br/>&gt; minor, 3 as the measure of the major, and 5 as the<br/>&gt; measure of wholeness or the 1 sound that can be played<br/>&gt; in either the major or minor key- but cannot be played<br/>&gt; in both at the same instant of time&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the foregoing is true, we ourselves cannot make the<br/>&gt; 1 sound, with the measure number 5, until we strike a<br/>&gt; chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3 (+ major) and 2 (- minor).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harold&apos;s description of the nuclear force of the<br/>&gt; hydrogen atom can be read as 3(+) / 2(-). It would<br/>&gt; say, &quot;that a chord can be struck using a formula that<br/>&gt; could read:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2(-) / 3(+), or 3(+) / 2(-),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; these 2 would not sound alike, but either would convey<br/>&gt; the sound of wholeness.<br/>&gt; ================================<br/>&gt; Natural Musical Scale Derived From Vesica Pisces<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  In the process of going from One to Two, a Circle<br/>&gt; with a diameter length has a single vibration, but<br/>&gt; when another Circle is added interesecting it in its<br/>&gt; center, a Vesica Pisces is formed. This is the area<br/>&gt; that it shares which looks like the female generative<br/>&gt; organ, and from where in sacred geometry  all things<br/>&gt; come from. Part of the reproductive creative process<br/>&gt; How natures multiplication and reproduction came about<br/>&gt; from One to Many Vibrations that we see and feel and<br/>&gt; hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     If there was a string across the diameter of our<br/>&gt; first circle, that could be our base frequency of<br/>&gt; 1,The second circle makes the Vesica Pisces, and<br/>&gt; extends the distance to 1.5 times the first. Therefore<br/>&gt; any frequency times 1.5 gives a pitch that is in tune<br/>&gt; with the original pitch or vibration.<br/>&gt;      And then if we continue on with the construction<br/>&gt; of a new Vesica Pisces by the mating of two circles,<br/>&gt; it makes a new larger circle of 2.25 times larger than<br/>&gt; our original circle. And so if we half this diamter,<br/>&gt; into a range between 1 and 2, it is 1.125. Therefore<br/>&gt; any original frequency sounds in tune with that<br/>&gt; frequency times 1.125. And lo and behold we can go on<br/>&gt; making twelve notes between 1 and its octave of 2.<br/>&gt; 1.125 being the B note on the piano.<br/>&gt;     Therefore using this same process we get a table,<br/>&gt; as seen on the left, with each of its corresponding<br/>&gt; notes that are all harmoniously in tune with each<br/>&gt; other, and now you know why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Circle Diameter    Ratio        Note     Hertz<br/>&gt; 1 = 1                1            A       440<br/>&gt; 2 = 1.5             1.5           E       659<br/>&gt; 3 = 2.25           1.125          B       494<br/>&gt; 4 = 3.375          1.69           F#      743<br/>&gt; 5 = 5.062          1.265          C#      554<br/>&gt; 6 = 7.539          1.88           G#      827<br/>&gt; 7 = 11.39          1.42           D#      622<br/>&gt; 8 = 17.08          1.06           A#      466<br/>&gt; 9 = 25.62          1.59           F       698<br/>&gt; 10=38.44           1.19           C       523<br/>&gt; 11=57.66           1.79           G       787<br/>&gt; 12=86.49           1.35           D       582<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>&gt; Tired of spam?
