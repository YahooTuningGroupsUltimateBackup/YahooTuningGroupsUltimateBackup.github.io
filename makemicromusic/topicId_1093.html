It&apos;s generally a good thing to have, and will also help you to<br/>recalibrate.

Now I<br/>really feel as if I&apos;ve performed a necessary &quot;initiation ritual&quot; for<br/>full group membership. ;-)</p><p>I do have a piece up on the Tuning Punks, &quot;Dance Bittersweet&quot;, in<br/>adaptively tuned solo piano.</p><p>I&apos;ve assigned myself to try to write a humorous piece, inspired by Mel<br/>Brooks and Jay Williams.  We could all use a smile now and again!</p><p>Thanks again, everyone.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
