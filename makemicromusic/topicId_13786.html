I&apos;ve been thinking of a 46-et article for Wikipedia, since we<br/>&gt; actually have a few examples of music, and wonder if it would be<br/>&gt; cheating to use something like this.</p><p>Hello, there, and I would follow Carl in noting that Pythgorean tuning<br/>rather than any irrational temperament is what medieval theory describes,<br/>although with Aaron I find that an &quot;accentuated Pythagorean&quot; temperament<br/>like this is pleasant and congenial to the music -- albeit in a &quot;not so<br/>period-authentic manner.&quot;</p><p>One could argue that major thirds around 14:11, minor thirds around 13:11,<br/>and diatonic semitones around 22:21 could have occurred in vocal practice<br/>as mild variations on Pythagorean -- but the idea of a regular temperament<br/>to achieve this seems a frank &quot;anachronism.&quot;</p><p>I do it all the time, and just want to take the opportunity to acknowledge<br/>the &quot;modernization&quot; involved.</p><p>Also, while Peppermint and (56/11)^1/4 are closely akin, the latter as<br/>you have noted seems a closer approximation of 46-et (or vice versa).<br/>Curiously, I started to use (56/11)^1/4 at the end of August 2000, a<br/>few days before Keenan Pepper suggested the regular tuning that I<br/>quickly adopted as another fine shading in 12 notes, and which in 2002<br/>became the basis for the 24-note Peppermint with two chains at 58.68 cents<br/>apart.</p><p>By the way, I should add that while I got involved and enthusiastic with<br/>14:11 or near-14:11 thirds in the summer of 2000, George Secor used eight<br/>fifths at (56/11)^1/4 in his 17-note well-temperament of 1978 -- as I<br/>learned around the beginning of summer in 2001.</p><p>&gt; That makes for one spicy meatball when we use these for meantone<br/>&gt; music, but it may make a lot more sense for Medieval music.</p><p>I&apos;d agree, because unless the timbre is especially mild or customized,<br/>using 14:11 where something like 5:4 is expected is not likely to bring<br/>out the restful quality of thirds and sixths as &quot;imperfect _concords_&quot;<br/>in a 16th-century style.</p><p>However, using 14:11 where something around 81:64 is expected nicely<br/>fits the unstable although somewhat blending quality of medieval thirds<br/>and sixths as &quot;_imperfect_ concords.&quot; Aaron has neatly demonstrated<br/>this in some great arrangements!</p><p>As to medieval pieces with prominent (but unstable) thirds and sixths, I&apos;d<br/>say that Aaron&apos;s _Le greygnour bien_ has some good examples at around<br/>0:58, 2:19, 2:29, 2:51 (within a second or two, anyway). These are common<br/>in lots of 13th-14th century pieces, along with some prominent seconds and<br/>sevenths also. Guillaume de Machaut is one obvious place to turn.</p><p>The point is that as long as you expect thirds to be unstable, the use of<br/>a Pythagorean or modern &quot;eventone&quot; tuning (like a meantone, but with wide<br/>fifths, with a meantone as a case of a narrow eventone -- i.e. two regular<br/>major seconds equal a major third) can be very congenial. There is also an<br/>interesting passage of what would later be called fauxbourdon in the Missa<br/>Tournai from the early or middle 14th century.</p><p>A common 14th-century technique is to end a phrase or section with an<br/>unstable sonority which invites a resolution -- following immediately<br/>(possibly when the form returns to the opening sonority of another<br/>section), or sometimes delayed, building anticipation. In the 13th<br/>century, Adam de la Halle sometimes does this on a miniature but very<br/>charming and effective style in his three-voice rondeaux -- indeed<br/>sometimes opening a piece with a third and sixth above the lowest part<br/>which expand to fifth and octave.</p><p>Again, for telling pauses on thirds and sixths, I&apos;d recommend Machaut<br/>as one model composer.</p><p>This is a different situation evidently than a number of 13th-14th century<br/>English pieces where thirds seem virtually stable, and where the comments<br/>of theorists such as Theinred of Dover and Walter Odington about 5:4 and<br/>6:5 as ratios close to the Pythagorean 81:64 and 32:27 would strengthen<br/>a stylistic impression that thirds, as Christopher Page puts it, may well<br/>have been &quot;mollified.&quot;</p><p>Aaron, thanks so much for these two great arrangements -- and Gene, for<br/>asking some relevant questions. (If you&apos;re curious, Peppermint happens<br/>to be quite close to 121-et, which George Secor and Dave Keenan and I<br/>agreed is a useful system for Sagittal representations.)</p><p>Also thanks to Jon Wild for the Woodley article, which I&apos;ve only<br/>glanced through quickly but will read soon. Here&apos;s a Rahn-style<br/>interpretation (cadential semitones around 48 cents, or close to<br/>37:36) of a texture with prominent cadential thirds and sixths<br/>having either an immediate or a delayed resolution.</p><p>By the way, this uses two 12-note Pythagorean chains at around 42<br/>cents apart, so fifths and fourths are pure -- the &quot;authentic&quot;<br/>period approach, however one might view the best reading of<br/>the sizes of semitones and cadential thirds and sixths in the<br/>system of Marchettus.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2006 11:26:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/28/06, stephenszpak &lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;           Carl mentioned someone named Henry Cowell.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           If anyone has a link to some of his stuff, I&apos;d listen.</p><p>Honestly, I prefer Conlon Nancarrow, who took Cowell&apos;s ideas and<br/>carried them to their logical extreme.

It&apos;s the<br/>&gt; &quot;rational tempos&quot; I find most exciting here.</p><p>He has a very wide range, most of his pieces use rational tempos (one<br/>goes up to 61/60) though the chaotic nature of some of his writing<br/>obscures the relationships. He also has a few pieces in irrational<br/>relationships (e/pi, square roots, and others) and a few in which the<br/>relationships change over time. I reccomend the Wergo set of all<br/>published studies, there isn&apos;t a single wasted note in five discs.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to say if this is off topic. Everything he wrote was for<br/>12-EDO, but the way he uses the tuning is in many ways very<br/>non-meantone. A lot of musical events seem to exist in a tonal limbo,<br/>neither consonant nor dissonant. Also, the way he uses frequency<br/>ratios is certainly suggestive of Just Intonation theory.</p><p>--TRISTAN<br/>(<a href="http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com/">http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com/</a>)</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2006 10:57:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Rozencrantz the Sane&quot;<br/>&lt;rozencrantz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  TRISTAN</p><p>I did listen to excerpts just now.</p><p>-Stephen</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 6/28/06, stephenszpak &lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;           Carl mentioned someone named Henry Cowell.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;           If anyone has a link to some of his stuff, I&apos;d listen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Honestly, I prefer Conlon Nancarrow, who took Cowell&apos;s ideas and<br/>&gt; carried them to their logical extreme.
