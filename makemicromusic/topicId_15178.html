So that you might be able to<br/>&gt; talk abotu and own for once some good music.</p><p>Wow. That was totally uncalled for. In case you haven&apos;t noticed,<br/>different people like different kinds of music. It&apos;s a fact, you<br/>really can&apos;t avoid that one.</p><p>While I&apos;m not a fan of Phish, I do like many jam-bands that get a lot<br/>of negative press for actually enjoying the music-making process. If<br/>you don&apos;t like that kind of music, then don&apos;t listen to it. I know<br/>that&apos;s an overstated sentiment, but it&apos;s true, and it wouldn&apos;t be so<br/>overused if people would stop acting like they were being forced to<br/>only ever listen to music that they hate. Sure, we all have to hear<br/>music we don&apos;t like, but I don&apos;t think Carl&apos;s listening habits are<br/>impacting your own in any significant way.</p><p>If you have anything more to say to this, please send it directly to<br/>me or to metatuning.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>Returning to MMM-land, though: With the help of a really amazing<br/>friend, I&apos;m finally going to put together the jam-band that I&apos;ve been<br/>dreaming about. So of course I&apos;m coming down with some hideous virus<br/>right when the planets are finally lining up. Stuck at home, though, I<br/>started working out chords to a song I wrote back before I knew what<br/>harmony was, and I discovered that the melody was so 3-heavy, and<br/>nearly 5-less, so that I could translate it into Pythagorean without<br/>even trying. A childish little victory, but it felt good to see that<br/>I, knowing so little about composition, had done something right.</p><p>--TRISTAN<br/>Dreaming of Eden is a Comic with no Pictures<br/><a href="http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com">http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=15181 href="#15181">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2006 11:26:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>{Tristan wrote...}<br/>&gt;Wow.
