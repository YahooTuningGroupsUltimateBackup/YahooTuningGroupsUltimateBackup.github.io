All we need is for a popular musician to adopt it<br/>for an album.</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;d be more than happy for<br/>&gt; any feedback on whether you think the chords are nicely rich or too<br/>&gt; dense, interesting or retarded, whatever crosses your mind.</p><p>My approach to a tuning system is to analyze it, and then to go with<br/>what seem to be its strengths. For 19, that would mean more triads,<br/>and a generally tamer sound. There are lots of other things one might<br/>consider; for example, you can split the (sharp) fourth in half, into<br/>an interval which you can pretend is a 7/6 or 8/7, but which is more<br/>like 15/13; some kind of small interval you can stack into chords at<br/>any rate. Two of them are a sharp fourth, and three of them  a flat<br/>14/9; together this makes a chord. These kinds of chords,<br/>characteristic of the particular tuning system, are interesting to<br/>look at. They help define the individual personality of the system, as<br/>do the scales and temperaments you get from particular generators,<br/>such as 4 steps of 19, etc.</p><p>Also striking are the very good minor thirds, five steps of 19 rather<br/>than 4; three of these, and one of the 4 step intervals, make for the<br/>19-et version of a dimimished seventh.</p></div><h3><a id=12107 href="#12107">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 10:59:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:52 PM 1/29/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I managed to hook up with a guy named Steve Altoft, who plays a<br/>&gt;19-tone trumpet, and I&apos;m working on a piece for him that will<br/>&gt;hopefully be published as well as performed at London&apos;s MicroFest &apos;07.</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>&gt;Anyway, I did a harmonic etude to help my brain hear start thinking in<br/>&gt;the right direction.
