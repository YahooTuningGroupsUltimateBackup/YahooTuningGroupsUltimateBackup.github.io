I have Scala, but it won&apos;t let me &gt; create music with the scales i make. You&apos;ve been getting a lot of links so I&apos;ll try and answer the simple questions.</p><p>- Buying a MIDI keyboard is a good idea, but it doesn&apos;t have to be retunable, or even have any sound production.  You can do all that with soft synths and at least get some experience so you make a more informed choice for the next step.  You&apos;ll neeed a way of plugging it into the PC as well.  USB boxes are good.</p><p>- There might be fully retunable keyboards out there but it doesn&apos;t greatly matter.  If you choose a keyboard solely on it&apos;s tuning ability you&apos;re unlikely to get the keyboard and sounds you originally wanted. Hence you usually end up with a different keyboard and synthesizer, which was originally the whole point of MIDI anyway.</p><p>&gt; My sequencer, Digital Orchestrator, and notation app, Noteworthy &gt; Composer remain locked in 12-tone equal temperament. How can i tune &gt; the 12(or hopefully more)pitches of an equal-tempered scale in cents &gt; so my sequencer or notation app will recognise the new tones? Does the &gt; hardware/software need to support MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS),or will &gt; pitch bend messages do this?  You remap the keyboard so that you still have one note per key, but the octave&apos;s a different size.  You can get used to that with the piano roll view of a sequencer.  You&apos;ll probably do notation differently, basing it on a 12 note octave but using additional accidentals.  Some folks in these parts do use Noteworthy Composer like this.</p><p>The MTS is only one way of transmitting tuning data.  It&apos;s often supported by software synths, but there are different hardware protocols, and you can see that Scala supports most of them.  The only problem is that you can&apos;t play the same MIDI file on different synthesizers.  Because every synth has a different sound that&apos;s not likely to work properly anyway.  If the synth doesn&apos;t support tuning tables then you can use pitch bends.  They can work but it&apos;s a pain if you move notes around in the sequencer and generally you&apos;re better off finding something with tuning tables.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=14717 href="#14717">ðŸ”—</a>klergstudios &#x3C;klergstudios@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2006 6:53:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Hudson Lacerda wrote:<br/>&gt;I suppose there are several answers for your questions, starting<br/>&gt;with<br/>&gt;what you mean with &grave;&grave;create [microtonal] music with a PC&apos;&apos;...

It supports SMT and is able to load a frequency table to set all 128 MIDI pitches; it also does some adaptative pure intonation, and can run as a sound device (so that you can send the output of a sequencer to timidity virtual MIDI input).</p><p><a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">http://timidity.sourceforge.net/</a><br/><a href="http://timidity.s11.xrea.com/index.en.html">http://timidity.s11.xrea.com/index.en.html</a></p><p>I would stress that ZynAddSubFX is really very good to play arbitrary scales. You need try it! :-)</p><p>Concerning to MIDI sequencing, I suppose other people can help, as I do not do music that way. (I only use abc2midi to have some audible feedback). I guess most people do the sequencing in common (non-microtonal) sequencers and then re-tune the MIDI files with Scala (e.g. with the command &grave;&grave;example/midi&apos;&apos; -- check Scala documentation).</p><p>For staff notation, there is no a word of flowers... but LilyPond (command line music typesetter) can do quartertones, there is a quartertone extension for RoseGarden (sequencer with a graphical music notation editor)... I remember that Sibelius could do quartertones (and play, in a somewhat dirty way); other programs will allow special accidentals for printing only. Anyway, in most cases you need to a double job -- one for score and another for MIDI. (Fortunately you do not need special accidentals for some scales like 19-EDO, and with quartertones you can have 24-EDO, 31-EDO etc.)</p><p>With microabc I can obtain MIDI and score from a single source file, although I suspect the MIDI will not be too suitable for later improving, if you want a high-quality MIDI performance (MIDI as the final musical work). I sometimes use tkabc (tclabc, from <a href="http://moinejf.free.fr">http://moinejf.free.fr</a> ; see also <a href="http://moinejf.free.fr/sample.gif">http://moinejf.free.fr/sample.gif</a>) as graphical interface for ABC; however, as the programs is young, it has still several limitations and knowledge of ABC is required -- tkabc can notate quartertones.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Hudson Lacerda</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Novidade no Yahoo!

One have to be willing to learn<br/>&gt;&gt; (or invent) how to make it -- this include a bit of effort in<br/>&gt;&gt; programming, specially because most software will not support<br/>&gt;&gt; non-standard scales.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m sorry, but it is time for this software myth to die. Even as near<br/>&gt; as 3 or 4 years ago, there was a bit of validity to that. But I can<br/>&gt; think of at least a dozen software musical instruments that support<br/>&gt; microtonality, many of them with direct .scl or .tun format<br/>&gt; importing, and it just isn&apos;t the case that one has to always &quot;roll<br/>&gt; their own&quot;.</p><p>Maybe I have misunderstood klergstudios: my interpretation was that retuning a MIDI file with Scala or do a MIDI mapping (which I suppose to be the approach used in the programs you refers to) were taken as a *non-elegant* way to do microtonal music; then I told that some &grave;&grave;hacking&apos;&apos; is still necessary to do microtonal music with a computer. For instance, many staff notation programs are clearly too limited for microtonalism. I suppose many sequencers will not let you have a viewing-mode adapted to the tuning (for instance, highlighting the octaves in 22-tet -- that is, every 22 pitches).</p><p>&gt; I fought long and hard to see some of these things come to light, and<br/>&gt; we are in a very fortunate situation compared to past hardware and<br/>&gt; software scenarios. While there is always a great deal one can do<br/>&gt; with programming their own environments, for someone who is new to<br/>&gt; this it can be very discouraging. If one wants to make microtonal<br/>&gt; music right now, they can do it, and the tools are right in front of<br/>&gt; us.</p><p>Indeed, for instance, by using timidity and zynaddsubfx, very easy-to-use tools which I recommended in *first place*, since my very first post in this thread.</p><p>I only _stressed_ the usefulness to learn a little &grave;&grave;programming&apos;&apos; *after* the deceptive feedback concerning to MIDI mapping and MIDI file re-tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I know we all have different ways of working, but let us not be<br/>&gt; discouraging when it isn&apos;t necessary.</p><p>When I suggest someone to learn something which may be useful, I presume that is *encouragement*.</p><p>Best wishes.<br/>Hudson</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Yahoo!
