Being of Hungarian extraction, the cimbalon is a sound I&apos;ve heard all my life, both in recordings and occasional live settings. I almost bought one once to do some heavy practicing, because we should remember that it has also crept into Western classical music, one of the most famous examples being the extended (and solo) part in Kodaly&apos;s &quot;Hary Janos&quot;. There are a few percussionists around that have added that to their arsenal, and make guest appearances when orchestras program the work.</p><p>A close spin-off of this was Harry Partch&apos;s use of felt-padded sticks for playing on the Harmonic Canons in both &quot;And on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma&quot; and the subsequent work, &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot;.</p><p>The latter of which may very well be staged live in 2007.
