I haven&apos;t seen anyone here mention it, so I thought I&apos;d post a<br/>note. The beta is good until February 2003, available here:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://bigtick.pastnotecut.org/rhino.html">http://bigtick.pastnotecut.org/rhino.html</a></p><p>It is missing a bunch of stuff (like C:M ratio setting!) but it is a<br/>6-operator FM synth with multiple wave forms, multi-point envelopes, two<br/>filters, built-in effects, etc. Like its predecessors, it&apos;s a VST plugin<br/>also. You can use Scala &quot;.tun&quot; files to tune it. Documentation is currently<br/>non-existent, but is supposed to be available in January.</p><p>(Sorry for the cross-posting; thought the &quot;Tuning&quot; folks might also be<br/>interested.)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
