It probably has a MIDI (or<br/>&quot;game&quot; port on it, and you hook a cable to your keyboard right? If you&apos;re<br/>hooking up a MIDI cable to your machine and you&apos;re using a keyboard to<br/>playback and input, you don&apos;t really need Midi Yoke. You use the builtin<br/>MIDI i/o capability. Your configuration looks like:</p><p>&#x9;Allegro -&gt; Soundboard-MIDI -&gt; Audio out to Keyboard<br/>&#x9;Allegro &lt;- Soundboard-MIDI &lt;- Midi In from Keyboard</p><p>Or you can setup Allegro to send output to the builtin sound board instead<br/>of the keyboard.</p><p>&gt; but it looks like I pick channels, as if they were instruments</p><p>Exactly. Midi Yoke is a separate MIDI &quot;device&quot; that you can use to chain<br/>two programs together. You only need it if you&apos;re sending MIDI output to a<br/>soft synth. Then your configuration would look like:</p><p>&#x9;Allegro -&gt; Yoke -&gt; Other-Program -&gt; Audio out to speakers</p><p>When you do the MIDI configuration in your application (Allegro or<br/>whatever) the Yoke appears as a device to which you can send MIDI signals,<br/>or from which you can get MIDI signals.</p><p>You may need to open the setup stuff in your application and make sure<br/>MIDI in/out are going to the right place. If you&apos;re doing a keyboard,<br/>that&apos;s probably called &quot;MPU 401&quot; in the control panel. On my machine with a<br/>sound card, the possible MIDI inputs are the MPU-401 (the card itself) or<br/>MIDI-Yoke. The possible outputs are the builtin Microsoft GW Wavetable, or<br/>the MPU-401 (i.e., the &quot;game&quot; port&quot;), or Midi Yoke. Then I hook a soft<br/>synth to the other side of the same MIDI-yoke channel.</p><p>&gt; MIDIcode looks easy to use.  If the tutorial/manual didn&apos;t come all<br/>&gt; winzipped up I might even be able to get it to work.  Please spot me<br/>&gt; the way in: what do I do with whichfile to get it started.</p><p>Midicode is easy to use. You should just download the Midicode &quot;exe&quot; file<br/>and double-click on it. That gets you the demo. If you purchase it, the<br/>author sends you a key to &quot;unlock&quot; the full functionality.</p><p>And Winzip is really standard to unzip the documentation. Everyone uses<br/>zip files for lots of distributions. If you can&apos;t extract the zip contents,<br/>you can get Winzip at <a href="http://Winzip.com">Winzip.com</a>. Their evaluation version is &quot;free&quot; and<br/>it works.<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
