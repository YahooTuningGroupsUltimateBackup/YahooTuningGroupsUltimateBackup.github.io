That&apos;s not a criticism... it&apos;s just that the<br/>piece wasn&apos;t specifically about harmony, but more about<br/>melodic &quot;jamming&quot; and contrast of rather fast elements.</p><p>The question I had for Jacky was whether there was something inherent<br/>in the Blackjack scale that made him go in that direction, or whether<br/>it was just the &quot;mood&quot; of the time.  Of course, Blackjack has been<br/>*designed* to particularly emphasize a harmonic approach through its<br/>many &quot;near just&quot; harmonies.</p><p>Was there any reason for not going in as harmonic a direction as I<br/>generally perceive in many Ligon works??  Was there anything about<br/>the Blackjack scale that did that... or only happenstance of this<br/>particular piece??</p><p>Thanks, Jacky, for any response...</p><p>__________ ________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
