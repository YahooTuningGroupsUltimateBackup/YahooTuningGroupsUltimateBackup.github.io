Have you guys seen this?</p><p>&quot;Overview<br/>Flinger is a program for synthesizing singing voice from a MIDI file<br/>input. It based on</p><p>    * the Festival Speech Synthesis System, developed at the<br/>University of Edinburgh<br/>    * the C++ library contained in earlier versions of the TclMIDI<br/>package, developed by Mike Durian (another TclMIDI page is here) &quot;This<br/>product includes software developed by Michael B. Durian.&quot;<br/>    * various modules developed here at the Center for Spoken Language<br/>Understanding at OGI, including the OGIresLPC synthesizer and voices, and<br/>    * a singing-voice synthesizer written by Mike Macon with support<br/>from Fluent Speech Technologies.</p><p>Flinger is similar in functionality to an earlier system called<br/>Lyricos, but in no way uses any source code or data contained in the<br/>Lyricos system.</p><p>Currently, Flinger is provided in pre-compiled form only, for Linux<br/>and Windows platforms only. We plan to offer a source code<br/>distribution in the future, similar to the way the other OGI TTS group<br/>software is provided.<br/>Flinger Jukebox<br/>Visit the Jukebox page to hear some samples of a growing library of<br/>music contributed by Flinger users around the world.<br/>System Documentation<br/>The Documentation page provides the most basic information needed to<br/>use the system. Note that this is not &quot;pointy-clicky&quot; software. In<br/>order to use it, you must be able to edit a text file and run a<br/>command-line program from the MS-DOS (or Linux) shell.<br/>References<br/>Some publications describing the concatenative approach to singing<br/>voice synthesis are as follows:</p><p>    * M. W. Macon, L. Jensen-Link, J. Oliverio, M. Clements, and E. B.<br/>George, &quot;Concatenation-based MIDI-to-singing voice synthesis,&apos;&apos; 103rd<br/>Meeting of the Audio Engineering Society, New York, 1997.<br/>    * M. W. Macon, L. Jensen-Link, J. Oliverio, M. Clements, and E. B.<br/>George, &quot;A system for singing voice synthesis based on sinusoidal<br/>modeling,&apos;&apos; Proc. of International Conference on Acoustics, Speech,<br/>and Signal Processing, Vol. 1, pp. 435-438, 1997.<br/>    * M. W. Macon, Speech Synthesis Based on Sinusoidal Modeling, PhD<br/>thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, October 1996.</p><p>A large number of references to other papers on singing voice<br/>synthesis can be found in the last reference above.<br/>Download<br/>We are currently allowing a small number of qualified users to<br/>beta-test Flinger for non-commercial use. In order to apply to be a<br/>beta-tester, you must register. Your application will be considered<br/>and if access is granted, a confirmation will be emailed to you. Your<br/>name, address, email, etc., will not be sold or used for any other<br/>purpose than this. To obtain the beta version of Flinger, you must</p><p>    * Read the license agreement and fill in information on the<br/>Registration Page.<br/>    * Wait for a confirmation email (usually within a week)<br/>    * Access the password-controled (use username and password you<br/>have entred in registration form)Downloads Page</p><p>Support<br/>We are looking for funding to continue Dr. Macon&apos;s work on Flinger.<br/>However, in the meantime, we have no resources to fix problems or add<br/>functionality.  We have set up a forum at<br/><a href="http://speech.bme.ogi.edu/forum">http://speech.bme.ogi.edu/forum</a> to provide Flinger users with a forum<br/>to share experiences and trouble solving information.  Please check<br/>back here regularly after you&apos;ve become an accomplished Flinger user<br/>to pass on your knowledge.&quot;</p></div>
