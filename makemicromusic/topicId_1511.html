The first<br/>thing I did once I got the email up and running was join the tuning<br/>list which had just relocated to Yahoo. I was psyched to finally have<br/>immediate access to others who were interested in this topic.</p><p>It took me a long, long time to get the hang of email, the medium was<br/>far more difficult than I ever would&apos;ve anticipated. But the tuning<br/>list was even more of a shock!</p><p>I was used to artist types. Years of trading tapes on the home taper<br/>circuit and frequenting artists&apos; collaborative like the Noh Place and<br/>the WAG had given me a certain set of expectations, and I just assumed<br/>the communal vibe would be at least somewhat similar: creativity<br/>first. This was simply not the case. The vibe was stiff, dry and<br/>snippily pedagogic.</p><p>Bad as that may sound, it wasn&apos;t all bad however. There was a bright<br/>side. Amounts the dominant voices on the list were some uniquely<br/>knowledgeable folks, and this was probably one of the only places on<br/>the planet where some of these theoretical questions and issues, ones<br/>I&apos;d puzzled over on my own, were consistently addressed in a<br/>forthright manner. Lots of no-nonsense facts that were quite useful<br/>for anyone who was interested in the theoretical side of tuning.</p><p>The downside was obvious though--a stifling and curt atmosphere that<br/>fostered only that which lined up favorably with the dominant posters.<br/>The alienated outnumbered the enlightened, but so it went... each new<br/>clash a bit more caustic than the last.</p><p>The main gripe was that the vast majority of the posts had nothing to<br/>do with actual hands-on music making and even less to do with<br/>microtonality in any sort of a broad, holistic sense. If you wanted<br/>your posts to peek their heads out of the din, you&apos;d better be sure<br/>author it in the particular language and excessively narrow interests<br/>of the dominant posters.</p><p>Eventually the inevitable happened and the list split off into many<br/>disgruntled and more special interest type factions. This has helped<br/>ease tensions and foster diversity to some degree, but I think it&apos;s<br/>still a process that&apos;s feeling its way towards something better. It&apos;s<br/>better, but it could be better still.</p><p>I think projects like Jack Ligon&apos;s Microtonal Activist are a step in<br/>the right direction. Projects like these help take list contributors&apos;<br/>work out of the church of the converted and off to the internet masses<br/>in digestible sized portions. I&apos;m sorry, but the signal to noise ratio<br/>renders the list archives all but impenetrable to anyone with anything<br/>less than a stout streak of tuning fanaticism.</p><p>I think more work along the lines of TMA&apos;s digestible sized portions<br/>can only help--Joe Monzo&apos;s editorial and organizational work on Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s Fokker periodicity blocks and harmonic entropy posts would be<br/>another example of a fruitful collaboration that exists in a<br/>presentable form other than the archives.</p><p>A FAQ would help... any FAQ! The last effort kind of collapsed under<br/>the weight of its own ambitions and the usual acrimonious squabbling,<br/>but I bet we--we being the online tuning community who&apos;d be willing to<br/>participate--could get it done. It would probably take an appointed<br/>organizer though, someone who gets things done. (I like Monzo in this<br/>capacity, but whoever.)</p><p>Then there&apos;s music. Stunning music puts all doubts to rest. Just last<br/>night I was listening to the Tilson Thomas conducted Comedy, and with<br/>just those comparatively limited instances of quartertones, Ives says<br/>more about the usefulness of quartertones--and by demonstrable<br/>extension, all non-12 tunings--than the three years worth of posts<br/>I&apos;ve read giving quartertones the back of their hand.</p><p>Effective music brushes even the sturdiest and the most sublime of<br/>theoretical edifices aside, and it does so with alarming ease... it<br/>steamrolls everything in its path... it clears the palate and resets<br/>the clocks.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=1514 href="#1514">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2001 4:04:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I got my first computer as a gift three Christmases ago.

I was psyched to finally<br/>&gt;have immediate access to others who were interested in this topic.</p><p>It was onelist back then, but yeah.</p><p>&gt;Bad as that may sound, it wasn&apos;t all bad however. There was a<br/>&gt;bright side. Amounts the dominant voices on the list were some<br/>&gt;uniquely knowledgeable folks, and this was probably one of the<br/>&gt;only places on the planet where some of these theoretical<br/>&gt;questions and issues, ones I&apos;d puzzled over on my own, were<br/>&gt;consistently addressed in a forthright manner. Lots of no-nonsense<br/>&gt;facts that were quite useful for anyone who was interested in the<br/>&gt;theoretical side of tuning.</p><p>Also lots of practical stuff, like meeting folks who write software<br/>like Scala, the Just Intonation Pitch Palette, SAOL, etc.  Folks<br/>who make web sites listing the microtonal capabilities of synths,<br/>etc.  Folks who make guitar fingerboards.</p><p>Which until recently is all you could do on-line.  Now, we&apos;ve got<br/>mp3, etc.  We were on top of that with the tuning punks, and now,<br/>file trading over yahoo, even though I personally don&apos;t enjoy<br/>working like this.  I like working alone, or with others in a<br/>band, but on-line I just can&apos;t see.  That&apos;s just me, though.</p><p>&gt;The downside was obvious though--a stifling and curt atmosphere<br/>&gt;that fostered only that which lined up favorably with the dominant<br/>&gt;posters.  The alienated outnumbered the enlightened, but so it<br/>&gt;went... each new clash a bit more caustic than the last.</p><p>I guess it really depends on your personality.  I never considered<br/>myself a dominant poster, or beholdant to one, an enlightened<br/>member, or an unenlightened one.  I was here to learn, and learn I<br/>did.  All I ever saw was people answering questions, helping out<br/>at every turn.  And that&apos;s all I ever tried to do.  Sure it&apos;s fun<br/>to be competitive... but that&apos;s all it ever was.  There was never<br/>any name-calling, and being wrong was no dishonor, as I found out<br/>time and time again.  ;0</p><p>&gt;The main gripe was that the vast majority of the posts had nothing<br/>&gt;to do with actual hands-on music making and even less to do with<br/>&gt;microtonality in any sort of a broad, holistic sense.</p><p>I personally feel that &quot;microtonality&quot; is not a valid artistic<br/>style or family of music.  I wouldn&apos;t know what could be said<br/>over e-mail about hands-on making music, except stuff like, &apos;I<br/>used Midi Relay to tune events from Cakewalk&apos;, etc.  There<br/>seemed to be plenty of that.  But people were always free to<br/>post whatever they wanted... or so I thought.</p><p>&gt;If you wanted your posts to peek their heads out of the din,<br/>&gt;you&apos;d better be sure author it in the particular language and<br/>&gt;excessively narrow interests of the dominant posters.</p><p>Jeez, Dan, our posts have crossed paths many times, and I never<br/>had any idea you felt like that!</p><p>&gt; Eventually the inevitable happened and the list split off into<br/>&gt; many disgruntled and more special interest type factions. This<br/>&gt; has helped ease tensions and foster diversity to some degree,<br/>&gt; but I think it&apos;s still a process that&apos;s feeling its way towards<br/>&gt; something better. It&apos;s better, but it could be better still.</p><p>I think the splintering has had both positive and negative effects<br/>on our community.  I agree that the single list was over-burdened,<br/>but I&apos;m not sure a bunch of yahoo groups are the way to solve the<br/>problem.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m sorry, but the signal to noise ratio renders the list archives<br/>&gt;all but impenetrable to anyone with anything less than a stout<br/>&gt;streak of tuning fanaticism.</p><p>In total agreement with you here.</p><p>&gt;I think more work along the lines of TMA&apos;s digestible sized<br/>&gt;portions can only help--Joe Monzo&apos;s editorial and organizational<br/>&gt;work on Paul Erlich&apos;s Fokker periodicity blocks and harmonic<br/>&gt;entropy posts would be another example of a fruitful collaboration<br/>&gt;that exists in a presentable form other than the archives.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t familiar with TMA until just now... looks cool.</p><p>&gt; A FAQ would help... any FAQ!</p><p>Absolutely, 1000% agree.</p><p>&gt;The last effort kind of collapsed under the weight of its own<br/>&gt;ambitions and the usual acrimonious squabbling,</p><p>I wasn&apos;t on the list during this time.</p><p>&gt;but I bet we--we being the online tuning community who&apos;d be willing<br/>&gt;to participate--could get it done. It would probably take an<br/>&gt;appointed organizer though, someone who gets things done.</p><p>Agree, but think none of the appropriate people have the time.<br/>Starrett and Monzo come to mind.</p><p>&gt;Then there&apos;s music. Stunning music puts all doubts to rest.</p><p>Totally agree.  But posting on a list isn&apos;t music.  I don&apos;t see<br/>how to change that.</p><p>My own experience with the list began in the fall of 1996.  I<br/>was enthralled.  I posted a bunch of music -- in 14-bit 32Khz<br/>wav and au format -- which didn&apos;t create much of a stir.  This<br/>was before any of the work we now consider to be great... the<br/>Sethares album, Crash Landing, Acoustic Stick, From on High.<br/>Before the digital Partch re-releases on CD from CRI and Innova.<br/>My friend had just written me about a new format called mp3 that<br/>was going to make news.  I played around with a DOS version of<br/>the Fraunhofer codec that looked like it had been ripped out of<br/>something with a hex editor.  Couldn&apos;t post mp3s, though, since<br/>nobody had anything to play them with.</p><p>I also posted pdf scores and midi files with Sysex messages<br/>inserted by the Pitch Palette sequencer.  Nobody had the Pitch<br/>Palette (or more accurately, the Roland virtual synth that came<br/>with it), so nobody could play the midi files (this was before<br/>Breed, deLaubenfels, and Walker made pitch-bend midi practical<br/>on Windows).</p><p>So I took it all down, and decided to learn some theory.  Now,<br/>I&apos;ve got enough theory to make interesting tunings up all day<br/>and all night.</p><p>I had a spot in Reinhard&apos;s AFMM in 1998.  I wasn&apos;t in the<br/>composing mood in 1998, but he asked nice, and I couldn&apos;t<br/>refuse such a break.  After the concert, I reflected on what<br/>an artistic failure it was.  Lots of great work, most notably<br/>the Adams _Durham_ quartet, but the idea of a concert of music<br/>where &quot;microtonal&quot; (whatever that is) was the only organizing<br/>principle struck me as silly, mis-guided, and abusive of the<br/>audience.  Let them have the sweetest music ever, or the most<br/>sour, but don&apos;t make a point of why it was.  That was going to<br/>be my approach.  The idea of a &quot;microtonal movement&quot; seemed<br/>childish.  There used to be serious limitations... but there&apos;s<br/>very little to stop us anymore, once Vandervoort gets his<br/>keyboard off the ground.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1515 href="#1515">ðŸ”—</a>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2001 8:06:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; Effective music brushes even the sturdiest and the most sublime of<br/>&gt; theoretical edifices aside, and it does so with alarming ease... it<br/>&gt; steamrolls everything in its path... it clears the palate and resets<br/>&gt; the clocks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
