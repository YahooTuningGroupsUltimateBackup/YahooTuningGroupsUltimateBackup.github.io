I have run out of music... :) Seriously, I&apos;ve got to write back on-list about the various (kind) comments, it has just been a sketchy coupla days.

I think this is the best way to<br/>represent the information with the tags.  Of course, this depends<br/>on what scheme you&apos;re using, in your head &amp; in your player.<br/>Players implement different schemes as far as what to report<br/>where about these tags.</p><p>&gt;Thanks for the collation.

However, I&apos;m asking for pragmatic rather than dogmatic strategies: with every other piece in your collection, you see the title of the piece, as well as the composer. The fact that you would be putting a composer&apos;s name in a performer&apos;s tag seems less important than making clear - as all the other files do - who wrote the thing. I&apos;m not saying you or anyone else should do it this way at other times, but with the MMM Day collection it would be nice to see the credit go to the composer, Dave.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
