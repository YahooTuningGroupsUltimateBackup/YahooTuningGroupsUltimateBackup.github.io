It is also the first recording of<br/>his music which does not rely on his great skills as a<br/>performer or the instruments of his own design or<br/>modification. Instead, in this 55 minute composition<br/>Grady has chosen 6 of his favorite instrumentalists<br/>and vocalists from a wide variety of backgrounds, each<br/>because of some unique quality that he finds in their<br/>musicality. Grady calls upon these players to perform<br/>pitches with extreme accuracy, but also to use the<br/>wide range of timbres possible on their instruments or<br/>voices. This extremely meditative yet somewhat intense<br/>composition explores a tuning called Meta-Meantone -<br/>this tuning has the characteristics of exploiting a<br/>variety of acoustical phenomenon ranging from equal<br/>beating chords to the reinforcement of difference tone<br/>phenomenon. This is an entirely acoustic recording<br/>with no processing effects of any kind. Originally<br/>designed for his own personal use, Grady considers<br/>this one of his finest compositions, performed<br/>exceptionally well, persuading him to release this for<br/>the enjoyment of others.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=15703 href="#15703">ðŸ”—</a>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2007 1:31:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hello and a good new year to one and all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I am extremely pleased to announce what may be one of my best<br/>&gt;  CD to date.</p><p>Cool!</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know your strategies for working with instruments<br/>like the bassoon and sax to get the pitches you wanted.</p><p>-Chris Bryan</p></div><h3><a id=15704 href="#15704">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2007 3:29:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>a Peterson tuner,<br/>like some of Niblock early works ( ones that i think only exist on record), by recording one note at a time.<br/>But the players were asked to push their timbres as much as possible while staying on the notes as far as they could vary it at times. So it adds to the aforementioned  the strictness of Young with the timbre  and dynamic variation of say Scelsi , the beating qualities of Wilson&apos;s Meta- Meantone, but breaks it all down into sometimes even a  solo single instrument which was determined by nothing more than personal taste. It is more a work of synthesis but feel it is not redundant since the result does not sound anything like the influences that seemed to be unavoidable. i say all this in hindsight. Hopefully it carries the ball at least a few more yards in this regard. I have no plans to produce any other work like it.<br/>c.m.bryan wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Hello and a good new year to one and all.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  I am extremely pleased to announce what may be one of my best<br/>&gt;&gt;  CD to date.<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be interested to know your strategies for working with instruments<br/>&gt; like the bassoon and sax to get the pitches you wanted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Chris Bryan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
