Please let me warmly thank all of your who<br/>have helped make this possible, including the most inspiring Bill<br/>Sethares who has done so much to encourage timbre/tuning diversity.</p><p>Here I&apos;ll give links to the upload messages, followed by notes on each<br/>of the three items.</p><p>                     *         *         *</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1179">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1179</a><br/>&quot;Fifths&quot; (13-tET, Piccolo, PuffPipesD) ~0:23</p><p>This quick demonstration moves through the 13 &quot;fifths&quot; or 8-step<br/>intervals in a 13-tET chromatic scale, showing how they can have a<br/>&quot;fifthlike&quot; stability or an intriguing ambiguity with some &quot;minor<br/>sixthlike&quot; qualities also. These intervals of around 738 cents might<br/>best be described as in their own class, &quot;fifths&quot; most extraordinary.</p><p>(The timbre is &quot;PuffPipesD,&quot; based on the beautiful built-in voice<br/>&quot;PuffPipes&quot; on the Yamaha TX-802 synthesizer, here modified to make<br/>these 13-tET intervals more smooth or concordant in effect.)</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1182">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1182</a><br/>&quot;Chowning Organ Improvisation&quot; (13-tET, Chowning Organ) ~2:30</p><p>This somewhat &quot;jazzy&quot; neo-Gothic piece tries a bit of &quot;floating&quot;<br/>accidentalism or chromaticism with some four-voice sonorities such<br/>as 0-462-738-923 cents (a bit like 14:18:21:24, 0-435-702-933 cents)<br/>or 0-277-702-1015 cents (a bit like 12:14:18:21, 0-267-702-969 cents).<br/>These sonorities maybe suggest what could very loosely be called a<br/>kind of &quot;neo-medieval barbershop&quot; style celebrating the sonorousness<br/>of this tuning. The Chowning Organ is a flutelike timbre named in<br/>honor of John Chowning, the inventor and developer of FM synthesis.</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1180">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1180</a><br/>&quot;14th-century improvisation&quot; (13-tET, Piccolo, PuffPipesD) ~2:38</p><p>This take on the 14th century features a timbre called &quot;PuffPipesD,&quot; a<br/>variation on the preset PuffPipes voice with optimization for 13-tET;<br/>the &quot;D&quot; in the title is the hexadecimal notation for the number 13.<br/>The &quot;Piccolo&quot; is a slightly modified version of the preset TX-802<br/>voice by this name (A27), which as is can make an interval of 8/13<br/>octave or a diminished sixth in 1/4-comma meantone (e.g. G#-Eb),<br/>either at ~738 cents, have a consonant effect rather like that of a<br/>usual fifth. One is tempted to wonder if the &quot;Piccolo&quot; preset might<br/>have been designed for such a tuning, for example John Chowning&apos;s<br/>ninth root of Phi scale used in Stria.</p><p>                     *         *         *</p><p>An aside: while it&apos;s sometimes convenient to speak of intervals such<br/>as &quot;fifths&quot; in 13-tET, this tuning has its own &quot;musical geometry&quot; or<br/>&quot;interval arithmetic&quot; often radically different from that of Western<br/>European compositional conventions. We might better speak of &quot;8-step&quot;<br/>intervals, often used in neo-Gothic music based on 13th-14th century<br/>European styles as a kind of near-3:2 stable concord.</p><p>May I warmly thank you, Jacky, not only for making these pieces<br/>available, but for taking the quite inexpert cassette recording which<br/>I mailed you and applying your technical skills and musical experience<br/>alike in seeking the best renditions for our tuning community on the<br/>World Wide Web.</p><p>With peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2001 7:03:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very kyool, Margo!

It&apos;s curious how the tuning can often support something<br/>quite close to what might be called &quot;textbook 14th-century harmony,&quot;<br/>but with some engaging turns and twists.</p><p>&gt; I expect it is because of the timbre, after reading your notes to<br/>&gt; Jacky&apos;s e-zine.</p><p>Yes, that could be a determining variable.</p><p>You also make some fascinating comments about the other improvisation,<br/>and maybe I&apos;d be wisest to listen to the piece again, taking note of<br/>your timings, and then respond. In the meantime, thanks for the<br/>feedback.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been doing a bit of experimenting with 13-tet after listening<br/>&gt; to your piece, and was fascinated to find the diminished 7th type<br/>&gt; chord 0 3 6 9 13 with three minor thirds and one major third, and to<br/>&gt; find that on some of the timbres I have it sounds sweet and pleasant<br/>&gt; to listen to and on others it sounds very rough.</p><p>Let&apos;s see, this would be 0-277-554-831-1200 cents. I should try this<br/>myself.</p><p>&gt; E.g. it&apos;s sweet on the Sitar voice of my SB LIve!, but not on the<br/>&gt; Sitar of the Yamaha softsynth. Not on recorder or &apos;cello of the Sb<br/>&gt; Live!, but great on the Glockenspiel and the Celeste.</p><p>These are interesting comparisons; one timbre I use is called a<br/>&quot;Chowning Celeste,&quot; based on a Yahama TX-802 preset, with at most<br/>minimal adjustments if I recall correctly. The pleasant effect of an<br/>inharmonic &quot;tuned percussion&quot; type of timbre is maybe not so<br/>surprising, and the Sitar comparison maybe another kind of question.</p><p>&gt; Made a little fractal tune experiment using those observations,<br/>&gt; which sounded sweet on my SB live! soundcard, and rather raucous on<br/>&gt; the Yamaha Softsynth. So you&apos;ve got me started on 13-tet - I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; really explored it before now.</p><p>This is wonderful, to have a tuning explored from many different<br/>viewpoints, and thank you also for those comments about Sesquisexta<br/>and your melodic adventures in it (the 24-note system with two<br/>Pythagorean keyboards a 7:6 apart).</p><p>&gt; I look forward to reading about the pieces and your technical notes.</p><p>With Jacky&apos;s help, there should be more to come.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2001 10:21:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, John, and thank you for a bit of feedback and reality<br/>testing on my 13-tET pieces.</p><p>&gt; Very kyool, Margo!  The pieces sound a bit &quot;xen&quot;, but nothing near<br/>&gt; as unusual as I would have expected for anything in 13-tET.<br/>&gt; Vertically, they are lovely from beginning to end, and it&apos;s more the<br/>&gt; melodic lines that catch the ear as &quot;odd&quot; somehow.  Odd because<br/>&gt; every now and then it&apos;s clear that things don&apos;t add up the way they<br/>&gt; do in 12-tET (or meantone).</p><p>Curiously, when I was exploring the keyboard and recording these<br/>pieces, I sometimes wondered a bit about reality testing -- or more<br/>dramatically, &quot;sanity testing&quot; -- since I wasn&apos;t quite sure that<br/>13-tET could seem this consonant. Had I really tuned it correctly?<br/>Here a main reassurance was that the intervals didn&apos;t add up as in<br/>medieval Pythagorean -- or meantone or 12-tET, as you mention.</p><p>&gt; (Don&apos;t misunderstand when I use the word &quot;odd&quot;.  Today&apos;s odd is<br/>&gt; tomorrow&apos;s smash hit.)</p><p>That&apos;s understood, and I&apos;d certainly agree that &quot;odd&quot; in the sense of<br/>&quot;new&quot; and &quot;strange&quot; is quite the word here -- and I say this as<br/>someone who routinely uses lots of favorite tunings that other people<br/>might consider somewhat &quot;strange.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Wow, the fifths sound so good, it blows me away that they&apos;re 738<br/>&gt; cents!  This clever voice tinkering you&apos;ve done makes a HUGE<br/>&gt; difference.</p><p>Coming from a connoisseur of harmony like yourself, this is especially<br/>pleasing feedback. It feels a bit like a science fiction movie, maybe<br/>_Journey to the Planet Sethares_ -- or the Planet Chowning? Of course,<br/>Jacky, you could have told me that those large fifths are _beautiful_.</p><p>&gt; If it should ever become possible, Margo, I&apos;d love to hear these<br/>&gt; same pieces in other timbres, not with the expectation that it would<br/>&gt; sound better (!), but to capture more vividly the importance of the<br/>&gt; timbres you have chosen.  A MIDI file of each piece would be<br/>&gt; wonderful, for example (I understand (?) that your present setup<br/>&gt; does not allow for such a file to be captured).</p><p>For a simple and maybe quite illustrative comparison, I could easily<br/>use Scala to code some of the basic 13-tET progressions I use, not<br/>much more difficult than notating them in ASCII. One of the reasons I<br/>_haven&apos;t_ already posted General MIDI files for these progressions is<br/>precisely that I consider timbre such an important factor for the<br/>intended consonance/dissonance effects. A few such files might nicely<br/>address your basic point, at least.</p><p>&gt; The timing of these posts (thanks, Jacky, for bringing Margo to the<br/>&gt; world!!) coincides nicely with Bill Sethares&apos; 19-tET guitar piece<br/>&gt; and a renewed discussion on the big list about the Hammond organ,<br/>&gt; which has quasi-12-tET partials in its sound.  There&apos;s a whole<br/>&gt; universe of music waiting to be written in this realm, it would<br/>&gt; seem.</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s a common theme here, and I&apos;d like to thank you, John, as<br/>well as Jacky and Bill, all for playing a part in leading me into this<br/>universe.</p><p>&gt; Keep that music coming, Margo!</p><p>That&apos;s an appropriate message for all of us in this community as we<br/>seek to &quot;MakeMicroMusic,&quot; and thanks for helping to make it possible<br/>by advice, encouragement, and example.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/31/2001 6:47:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo</p><p>I just got a chance to listen to your work and found myself quite<br/>delighted by the sonorities.
