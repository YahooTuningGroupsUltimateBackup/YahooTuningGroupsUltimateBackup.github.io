I mean *really* musical, and I may be more concerned about it than other people. I have two colleagues that are active composers in the film/television world, where sampled instruments are used a lot (as I&apos;m sure you know already). The amount of not only care spent on the samples themselves, but *how* they are used (both in the playing/programing, and the choices) is night and day. I&apos;ve heard people use Larry&apos;s gear to do their own demos, and it sounded like they tossed out all the good stuff and brought in junk - all due to not having his skill with those sounds/tools.</p><p>&gt;He discusses some of his tools on his blog.</p><p>In the archives of MMM somewhere is a slightly more detailed discussion of how he worked with the samples.
