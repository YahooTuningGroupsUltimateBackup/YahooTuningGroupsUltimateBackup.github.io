As<br/>&gt;it was he influenced me greatly. Music moves in him. I can imagine<br/>&gt;having the time you did with him to jam and talk was excellent.</p><p>While he was here he gave me a DVD of his stuff -- I only had<br/>cassettes, which I can&apos;t play anymore (and some of which were<br/>stolen from me in Oakland in the late &apos;90s).  I&apos;m going to do my<br/>usual thing assembling them into an mp3 archive.  I&apos;ll then ask<br/>him if I can host them.  His stuff was way ahead of its time.</p><p>Unfortunately most of his key ensemble players had just graduated<br/>UFL and moved on before I arrived.  We got one tremendous jam,<br/>with Denny on drums, myself on retuned Baldwin organ, and Pat Pagano<br/>on electric violin, giant hammer Dulimer, and Pro One.<br/>Unfortunately, the only copy was stolen in Oakland.  I had other<br/>copies of some of the other stuff I did with Pat that isn&apos;t as good.<br/>I may post it at some point though.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=23414 href="#23414">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2010 9:04:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>I posted a 6 minute edit of the resulting 34 minute stretched cosmolyra jam<br/>session.<br/>Definitely feel free to post any of the following where you&apos;d like.</p><p>The 6 megabyte file can be downloaded here:</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=1656">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=1656</a></p><p>Or - listened to online here:</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=633&p=4033#p4033">http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=633&p=4033#p4033</a></p><p>I took the liberty of posting your introductory post and pictures to the<br/>start of the thread here:</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=633&start=0">http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=633&start=0</a></p><p>I&apos;m thinking I am hearing some JI &quot;buzz&quot; or &quot;growl&quot; in the stretched version<br/>and I really like it.
