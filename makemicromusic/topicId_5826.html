Born in Oakland, he spent much of his life<br/>working in California, systematically developing a rich body of work<br/>that reaches back to antiquity and archaic musical principles of<br/>music theater.</p><p>Unfortunately his hand-made instruments are difficult to<br/>transport and so more difficult to hear in person, let alone to<br/>be present at a staging of his naturally theatrical works. As he once<br/>said &quot;Hell, i&apos;m not like John Cage.  All Cage needs is a gong, a<br/>carrot juicer and a toothbrush.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Delusion of the Fury:  A Ritual Dream and Delusion&quot; enacts two<br/>interlocking fables, one Japanese and one African. It was written<br/>for six actors, four singers and a large ensemble of Partch&apos;s own<br/>handmade instruments, and premiered in January 1969 at UCLA.<br/>The piece is the culmination of Partch&apos;s work with concept of<br/>&quot;corporeality,&quot; a kind of total theater, integrating music,<br/>dance, stagecraft and ritual.</p><p>The film version incorporates this idea, integrating camerawork<br/>and montage, to bring vividly forth on screen this challenging<br/>and rarely staged work. It was released in 1971, directed by<br/>longtime Partch associate Madeline Tourtelot and edited<br/>by Les Blank.</p><p>Presented in cooperation with Other Minds.<br/>Programmed by Konrad Steiner.</p><p>----&gt; Venue Info &lt;------------------------------------------------------</p><p>SF Cinematheque @ California College of Art<br/>Tinken Hall, 1111 Eighth Street at Irwin (at 16th St)<br/>San Francisco</p><p>By Muni<br/>take the 19 Polk to De Haro &amp; 16th walk east 2 blocks then 1 block<br/>north on Wisconsin<br/>-OR-<br/>take the 22 Fillmore to Wisconsin and walk 2 blocks north (away from<br/>Jackson Playground)</p><p>----&gt; Additional Info &lt;-------------------------------------------------</p><p>sfc@...<br/>415-552-1990<br/><a href="http://www.sfcinematheque.org/">http://www.sfcinematheque.org/</a></p><p>---&gt; The Squid List Admin &lt;---------------------------------------------</p><p>The Squid List, a tentacle of Laughing Squid<br/><a href="http://www.laughingsquid.org/squidlist/">http://www.laughingsquid.org/squidlist/</a></p><p>To subscribe, unsubscribe or change your preferences:<br/><a href="http://lists.laughingsquid.org/mailman/listinfo/squidlist/">http://lists.laughingsquid.org/mailman/listinfo/squidlist/</a></p><p>Frequently Asked Questions &amp; Submission Guidelines<br/>Squid List FAQ: <a href="http://www.laughingsquid.org/squidlist/faq.html">http://www.laughingsquid.org/squidlist/faq.html</a></p><p>Online Squid List Calendar (new feature):<br/><a href="http://laughingsquid.org/squidlist/calendar/">http://laughingsquid.org/squidlist/calendar/</a></p><p>----&gt; Laughing Squid &lt;--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Laughing Squid<br/><a href="http://www.laughingsquid.org">http://www.laughingsquid.org</a><br/>underground art and culture from San Francisco and beyond</p><p>Laughing Squid Web Hosting<br/><a href="http://www.laughingsquid.net">http://www.laughingsquid.net</a><br/>web hosting for artists, individuals, non-profits and small organizations</p><p>Copyright (c) 2004 Laughing Squid.

It wasn&apos;t just in good shape, but is a pristeen Kodacolor original print, so it should do very nicely up there! I UPS&apos;d it to the SF Cinematique last week.</p><p>I should say that there will also be another screening, in a few weeks further down the road, at the Pacific Film Archives at UC Berkeley.

I didn&apos;t really know the Berkeley schedule, as they never told me the exact date of the showing, but that was shown sometime this past spring!</p><p>In any event, the film that was shown there (the actually print) was digitized first at a film production place in LA, in preparation for a DVD release, to be coupled with a new transfer of &quot;The Dreamer That Remains&quot;. This one I&apos;ll definitely post information on, not sure of the production schedule, maybe after first of the year sometime.
