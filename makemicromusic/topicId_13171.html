Indeed this is part of the Dan<br/>Stearns touch -- an important part -- but this is one case where the<br/>whole exceeds the sum of the parts, while honoring and enriching them.</p><p>While there are various ways of meeting Dan Stearns, and some of us<br/>have enjoyed encounters through friendly dialogues or joint editorial<br/>ventures, one good way is through the musical welcome mat he has<br/>freely extended to the world to enjoy a full two dozen of his pieces:</p><p>               &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_2/music/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_2/music/</a>&gt;</p><p>Please let me admit with great regret that it took me several days to<br/>act on Dan&apos;s invitation and have that long downloading session for<br/>those 24 pieces. When I started early this afternoon, I was delighted<br/>to find that one of my excuses for delay was no longer valid: the<br/>download connection with <a href="http://zebox.com">zebox.com</a> went just fine, and in the Lynx<br/>browser for Linux I saw a friendly text menu. It was indeed a long<br/>process, because Dan has bestowed on us all a lot of music -- a CD<br/>album and more, I&apos;d guess.</p><p>So far, I&apos;ve had a chance to listen to five of the 24 pieces, a quick<br/>first selection. While &quot;instant art criticism&quot; has its hazards, I see<br/>no hazard at all in sharing my delight and fascination with what I&apos;ve<br/>heard. It&apos;s indeed vintage Dan Stearns, as a few random reflections<br/>may suggest.</p><p>My comments, by the way, follow the order of my listening, which is<br/>more or less for the most part the order of my downloading the pieces<br/>as arranged on the web page. Maybe Dan could comment on whether this<br/>ordering might have any subtle influence on my perceptions.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>1. JI_Americana: Dan Stearns on Ellis Island?<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>As it happens, I did start with a  piece taken out of the download<br/>order, because it looked so inviting: _JI Americana_. Given that my<br/>grandparents on my mother&apos;s side came as Russian Jews to this<br/>continent in the early 20th century, I approached this as a kind of<br/>&quot;Ellis Island experience.&quot;</p><p>Indeed, Dan charmingly takes some American standards as cantus firmi<br/>or whatever for contrapuntal settings -- it&apos;s lively, jazz, maybe a<br/>bit &quot;expressionistic&quot; a la the Vienna scene (a bit more Berg than<br/>Strauss), and the mark of a new intonational patriotism of sorts, one<br/>might say. The layers and timbres sort of dance around the medley of<br/>tunes: welcome to the land of sophisticated JI (not necessarily<br/>defined by any national borders).</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>2. If You Blink, You Ain&apos;t Dead...Yet<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>&quot;What tuning is this in?&quot; -- I&apos;m not sure, but the music comes<br/>through. It sounded to me a bit like pantonal 20th-century music, or<br/>maybe jazz, with a neat percussion timbre somewhat like bells. A<br/>timbre makes an appearance at one point that sounds to me a bit like a<br/>kazoo, and adds to the piece, which has lots of rhythms that<br/>pleasantly remind me a bit of 14th-century European syncopation,<br/>although that&apos;s likely a free association rather than a technical<br/>description. A neat piano tune comes in near the end -- another aspect<br/>of an engaging soundscape which again seems to draw on Americana and<br/>transform it into something new.</p><p>The other three pieces I&apos;ve heard so far I&apos;ll discuss in my next post;<br/>but this first quick response before I do some shopping for the<br/>weekend, I hope, suggests that Dan Stearns is practicing his art with<br/>finesse and vigor -- and is well worth the hearing, to say the very<br/>least.</p><p>While Dan Stearns and William Sethares are in some ways rather<br/>different artists: Sethares often uses his fine adjustments of tuning<br/>and timbre to produce rather urbane as well as winning pieces that<br/>might go in some familiar category such as a jazz/classical fusion (if<br/>I&apos;m any judge), while Stearns wins through a certain directness that<br/>might suggest a cross between an innovative intonational theorist and<br/>a skillful barroom pianist -- both use intonation as one element in<br/>their musical mixes, with their accent in &quot;microtonal music&quot; being on<br/>the second word.</p><p>Now that Dan has released via the Internet the equivalent of a very<br/>generous album, we can applaud both the artist and the creative medium<br/>he has found, along with so many others, to share his creativity,<br/>beauty, and sheer spunk with the world at large.</p><p>Here I&apos;ve discussed only one twelfth of the &quot;double dozen,&quot; so I have<br/>lots more listening and writing to do, warmly inviting others to join<br/>in and compare notes -- including, of course, Dan himself.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=13175 href="#13175">ðŸ”—</a>Joe &#x3C;tamahome02000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2006 10:15:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, how come you don&apos;t use a more &apos;gui&apos; web browser?
