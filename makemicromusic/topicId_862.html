Your Bardo Prayer is very mysterious! How did<br/>you get the voices in there? And Bird sounds? Great work! I will<br/>check out FTS.

I record my voice through a Neumann<br/>TLM 103 microphone which is fed to a Great River pre-amp and then<br/>into an Apogee AD-8000 where it is converted to digits and then fed<br/>into the computer through a ProTools Mix 24 system.  I record<br/>everything to SCSI hard drives, and mix in ProTools.  On this<br/>recording I am beginning to experiment with parametric compression<br/>and EQ with a Waves C4 plugin which a lot of people rave about.<br/>However I recently found a really good mastering professional and am<br/>very happy I can throw the stuff at him and let him agonize over<br/>levels and EQ.</p><p>NOthing in the piece was actually designated a Bird Call - it could<br/>be my voice :-) or the shaker which is being run through a moving<br/>bandpass filter.</p><p>Scala is a free program which can run alone, and I find its latest<br/>GUI update much easier to manage.  It also can be used within FTS -<br/>thats what I use to &quot;dial up&quot; a scale.</p><p>FTS is seriously underpriced at 20 bucks given the amount of time<br/>Robert puts into developing it.  I am hoping it becomes the first<br/>microtonal sequencer</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=873 href="#873">ðŸ”—</a>earth7@...</h3><span>10/2/2001 7:14:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mary</p><p>Wow! your really well versed in the art of recording!</p><p>I downloaded and installed Fractal Tune Smithy and started &quot;messin&quot;<br/>with the program.

You need to understand who you are as<br/>basically a bioenergetic matrix (just like the movie Matrix)<br/>programmed by belief systems from seven generations of your genetics,<br/>your parents, your early environment and social consciousness -  just<br/>to start with!</p><p>Then you need to accept responsibility that everything that appears<br/>in your life you create.  Most people never realize that because most<br/>of the creation is unconscious.  In essence your job is one of<br/>deprogramming the &quot;default&quot; settings you were born with  and<br/>resetting the parameters to something more to your consci0us liking.</p><p>I use statements like &quot;Discreate all my beliefs preventing me from<br/>recognizing my own inherent ability to create and manifest&quot;.  Or more<br/>simple ones like &quot;make it obvious to me on a conscious level how I<br/>created this disaster in my life&quot;  Then listen and be open because<br/>spirit communicates symbolically (kind of like the computer can only<br/>respond in C code)</p><p>It helps to be doing this with other people, either friends, who can<br/>help keep you honest :-) or energetic healers who can see this stuff<br/>in your field.  Its a process, kind of like an archeological dig, and<br/>the excavation can seem to take forever.  (thats one reason I started<br/>doing the music I do because I found for myself it hastened the<br/>process, and I am a big one for doing things as easily and gracefully<br/>as possible).</p><p>Actually thats another statement you can use - &quot;Discreate everything<br/>that prevents me from leading a life of abundance with grace and ease<br/>(and humor)&quot; The trick is to keep taking responsibility for<br/>everything in your life, especially the bad stuff, and looking for<br/>the roots in your belief systems (kind of like debugging a program to<br/>find the bad lines of code)</p><p>Anyway that is gist of it.  Oh and ask that the resources be brought<br/>to your conscious attention to make the process of debuggin as fast<br/>and easy as possible.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=886 href="#886">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
