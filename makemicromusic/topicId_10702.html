Uggleupplagan, 1919<br/><a href="http://runeberg.org/nfch/0437.html">http://runeberg.org/nfch/0437.html</a></p><p>&quot;The 19-tone system has most frequently been discovered; Praetorius<br/>(1614) has already been mentioned and at more recent times by Swedish<br/>P. S. Munck af Rosenschoeld (1847) as well as German F. W. Opelt<br/>(1852). Munck af Rosenschoeld (b.1804, d.1860, adjunct to the<br/>university at Lund) wrote about his &apos;tempered enharmonic tone system&apos;<br/>in Vet. akad:s preceedings and afterwards had a harmonium prepared<br/>(now in the Musikhistoriska museum [ie <a href="http://tinyurl.com/9n5cx">http://tinyurl.com/9n5cx</a> ]).<br/>Helmholtz .. remarked against all 19-tone theories that they only<br/>addressed the pythagorean comma, but not the syntonic in that they<br/>don&apos;t distinguish between third and fifth tones (e is not the same<br/>pitch as fifth to a and third to c...).&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s a neat article by Denzil Wraight about the famous Zarlino<br/>design, &apos;Zarlino&apos;s 24-note Harpsichord built by Domenico da Pesaro,<br/>1548.&apos; <a href="http://www.denzilwraight.com/24note.htm">http://www.denzilwraight.com/24note.htm</a><br/>You can see a 19-tone Zarlino embodiment at <a href="http://www.jackpeters.com/">http://www.jackpeters.com/</a></p><p>&gt; But if we were going to push for one such thing 22 would be much<br/>better.</p><p>I almost missed seeing a 22-tone harpsichord Willard Martin exhibited<br/>at the Early Music Festival (soon before closing I met Jack Peters who<br/>said to go check out the split keys clavichords he kept in one of the<br/>smaller rooms). He brought two 22 tone keyboards - one that was more<br/>authentic and the other played easier, as well as many diagrams and he<br/>demonstrated a little music (including Beatles).</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2005 3:24:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I say if  Paul and I agree on something (the 22 family as being special), &gt;then the world oughtto stand up and take notice.:)</p><p>I&apos;m standing while I type this.

Unlike 19, 22 forces you away from diatonic, common-practice<br/>thinking, so as an agent of change it has a lot of potential.
