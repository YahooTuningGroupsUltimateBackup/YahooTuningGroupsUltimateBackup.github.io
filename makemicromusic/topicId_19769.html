The major triad a no-brainer if you want 4:5:6 - 0:23:42, or in C, C Ev G in ASCIIzed Richter-Herf notation as used by Scala. The major sixth would be best voiced as 0:23:42:53, or C E\ G A\, A-54 would give you a wolf fifth.</p><p>And the ninth (D) could be either 83 or 84, but D-83 gives you a wolf fifth (G-D\) and D-84 gives you a wolf fourth (A\-D). Which major ninth to chose would depend on what chord you&apos;re progressing towards or out of, but the best bet would seem to be D-84, if you compare the ninth to the other three notes in the chord. C-D is equivalent to 9/4 while C-D\ is to 20/9. E\-D is equivalent to 9/5 while E\-D\ is to 16/9. G-D is 3/4 while G-D\ is a wolf fifth (40/27). A\-D\ is a perfect fourth (4/3) while A\-D is a wolf fourth (27/20). D is more stable with three of the four other notes while D\ is more stable with only one - so my recommended voicing is 0:23:46:57:84.</p><p>I tested the chords with both the 83 and 84-comma ninths in Scala and the 84-comma one sounded smoother. But that&apos;s just one example. I still need to test all the other chords, and then do chords with neutral, subminor and supermajor intervals that can&apos;t be played in 12-tone tuning.</p><p>By the way, I voice the so-called &quot;Hendrix chord&quot;, 7#9no5, as 0:23:58:88, which can also be an Italian sixth with an added augmented ninth. One of my favorite chords is the same chord plus an augmented fourth, 0:23:35:58:88 - that would be a French sixth plus augmented ninth, or Wagner&apos;s &quot;Tristan chord&quot; plus major third.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2008 4:23:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Danny,</p><p>I am by no means an authority on this, but I&apos;ve been tackling the same<br/>question myself for the past few months.

Context will always decide more than such a priori decisions. But we still like to have somethings to start with.

To play through all the inversions will get to allot of things that theory will not.

I&apos;d call that a &quot;resolved eleventh chord&quot;, since it&apos;s as consonant as it could possibly be. It would be best at the end of a tune or phrase.<br/>&gt; 2) You can make the D-F# dyad a 5/4<br/>&gt;   My &quot;normal&quot; tuning for C7#11 might be 0:23:42:60:84:107 in 72et, representing 1/1:5/4:3/2:16/9:14/5.</p><p>&gt; 3) You can make the D-F# dyad a 9/7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The last one has a very bright and almost sad quality to it.<br/>&gt;   I treat 9/7 as a diminished fourth, so I would consider that a &quot;sad&quot; chord. Or a tense and confused one, since it would be C E G Bb D Gb.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, when you hear these chords played in a big band (say in a<br/>&gt; brass section), they will often adjust the intonation to one or more<br/>&gt; of these. Sometimes I hear the #11 played as an 11/4, and sometimes I<br/>&gt; hear it as a 5/4 over a 9/8, and sometimes I hear it as a 9/7 over a<br/>&gt; 9/8. Subtle microtonal inflections bring out different feelings, and<br/>&gt; since no such authority exists right now, you sort of get to invent<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt;   Hey, do you mean 9/7 over 9/8 or over 10/9? Because I like your chord, but I&apos;d leave out the perfect fifth and tune it 1/1:5/4:16/9:20/9:20/7 (0:23:60:83:109). It would actually be a C9b5, with the diminished fifth actually being a twelfth. Or leave in the perfect fifth if you want something ultra-dissonant and borderline disgusting, which is okay with me.</p><p>&gt; The other thing, and the one that I find infinitely more interesting,<br/>&gt; is that even within the context of 12-tet (say on a piano), I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; a huge range of JI chords IMPLIED by the same 12-tet voicing. So in<br/>&gt; our C7#11 example, there are ways to play that chord on a piano and<br/>&gt; hear it as a mistuned version of 4:5:6:7:9:11, or the 5/4 over 9/8 on<br/>&gt; top, or any of the other options up there. The way the chord is<br/>&gt; voiced, the surrounding chords, the voice leading, and sometimes even<br/>&gt; the musical context and thematic setting all contribute to how you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; perceive that chord as functioning or existing.<br/>&gt;   Well yeah, the mind knows how to compensate somehow. Altering a pitch by a single comma just smooths out the sound; it might make it easier on the brain too.</p><p>I am to the point that I hear the F sharp and F half-sharp (7/5 vs. 11/8) as two different pitches; likewise B flat and B flat-and-a-half (16/9 or 9/5 vs. 7/4). So I&apos;ll need at least 24-equal.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t speak for anyone else about that last bit, but that is how it<br/>&gt; appears to me.

The first one sounds like a chord<br/>&gt; extension (continuing the 7th-9th-11th-13th progression to the 15th)<br/>&gt; and the second one sounds like a benign doubling of the root note by<br/>&gt; two octaves.<br/>&gt;   Well, one of my rules *is* that a 32/27 minor third is preferable to a 81/64 major third.

We could make C-F a 4/3, or F-Bb a 4/3 - but not both. And they&apos;re<br/>&gt; both valid - the two simply sound different. The C-F as 4/3 sounds<br/>&gt; much more placid and relaxed, and the F-Bb sounds more excited and<br/>&gt; maybe even a bit agitated or tense to my ears -- as if it is a chord<br/>&gt; forcefully extruding out into some direction.</p><p>Or use the Pythagorean minor third for Eb, 32/27 again.</p><p>But I tried C:Eb/:F/:Bb/, and I think I like that&apos;s best.
