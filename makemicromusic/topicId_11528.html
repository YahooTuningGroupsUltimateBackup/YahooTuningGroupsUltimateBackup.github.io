Not sure. What came to me<br/>    quite some time ago was 15 UDF.</p><p>    15 UDF (15 notes per octave in a Universal Dynamic<br/>    Framework)</p><p>    I don&apos;t know if I posted<br/>    here about it recently or not.</p><p>    Basically, what I have in<br/>    mind is knowing what one wants to do ahead of time regarding<br/>    a melody, etc. So what one would do is choose the root notes<br/>    to be whatever is desired,for three or four chords<br/>    (maybe, keep minor 3rds 300,<br/>    major 3rds 400, and perfect fifths 700, maybe). With 15 notes<br/>    available for a octave, one could have 3 or 4 chords that could<br/>    not exist in virtually any form of 15 (at least that<br/>    is my guess about it). So one would play in these 3 or 4 chords<br/>    for a given composition. That is 9 or 12 notes, maybe more<br/>    if one wanted even more complexity. Although there is a mental<br/>    limit on this.</p><p>    The other notes of the octave would<br/>    not be in use, so they could result in roots that had terrible<br/>    3rds and fifths.
