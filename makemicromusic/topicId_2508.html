It is not the events themselves, but the<br/>pattern that the events form. It is not the actions,<br/>but the way in which the actions mesh together.<br/>It is not the places, but the way in which the places relate.<br/>The song is an answer to its title.</p><p>The song is played and sung in the &quot;aeolic&quot; scale, which uses<br/>the justly tempered pitches</p><p>1/1  9/8  32/27  4/3  3/2  128/81  16/9  2/1.</p><p>*********************</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>sethares@...</h3><span>4/2/2002 5:33:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff wrote:</p><p>&gt; I really am liking these microtonal folk songs you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; done.
