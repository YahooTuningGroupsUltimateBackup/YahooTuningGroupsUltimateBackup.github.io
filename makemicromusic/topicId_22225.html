As best as I can figure out Kontakt compares the note being requested to play with the overtone (or undertone) series in relation to a note you set as the fundamental. So... then if you request a middle C it may map to the 18th overtone and that over tone is played. It is an odd mapping - but something worth exploring.</p><p>Then - I repeat the (short) piece with an organ, but in dynamic pure tuning. Again Kontakt compares the notes you are playing and changes them (slight) from 12 equal to give a pure combination. (It shows you what it does on a bar graph)</p><p><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/overtone-music/ho-hum-overtone.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/overtone-music/ho-hum-overtone.mp3</a></p></div>
