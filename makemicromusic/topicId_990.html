I can&apos;t speak for<br/>what Macs are like, even in their many formats, but those of you with<br/>PCs will understand the following as well:</p><p>If you are doing *any* kind of live audio input via a microphone, but<br/>even more importantly, are *mixing* digital audio, what do you do<br/>about</p><p>      THE NOISE OF THE DAMN FAN(S) IN THE COMPUTER???</p><p>Just curious.</p><p>In all seriousness, and in our ongoing efforts to share and spread<br/>the abilities of making music, what solutions have any of you come up<br/>with in isolating the main box, so as to not pollute either the<br/>recording or your ears with fan noise?</p><p>Sitting here with two of my smallest fans,<br/>Mom</p></div><h3><a id=991 href="#991">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>10/10/2001 1:48:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;9q0huo+a4nu@...&gt;<br/>Jon Szanto asked:</p><p>&gt; If you are doing *any* kind of live audio input via a microphone, but<br/>&gt; even more importantly, are *mixing* digital audio, what do you do<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       THE NOISE OF THE DAMN FAN(S) IN THE COMPUTER???</p><p>For pure-digital work, I have closed-back headphones, and they&apos;re good<br/>enough for me.  Sometimes that means turning the volume right up so the<br/>noise becomes audible.</p><p>The music I recorded through a mic that&apos;s escaped so far wasn&apos;t using a<br/>preamp, so the additional noise from the fan wasn&apos;t a problem.  I&apos;ve now<br/>taken to leaving the room and closing the door after starting recording.<br/>Symbolic Sound suggest putting your computer in the next room, and running<br/>long cables through the wall.  That&apos;s a bit drastic for me, but I can see<br/>the wisdom of it.</p><p>You can also get low-noise fans, or fans that only cut in when they need<br/>to, or huge heat sinks that mean you don&apos;t need a fan.  I&apos;m not sure where<br/>you get these things from, or how you fit them, which is why I don&apos;t use<br/>them.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=998 href="#998">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2001 8:09:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are doing *any* kind of live audio input via a microphone,<br/>&gt; but even more importantly, are *mixing* digital audio, what do you<br/>&gt; do about THE NOISE OF THE DAMN FAN(S) IN THE COMPUTER???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just curious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In all seriousness, and in our ongoing efforts to share and spread<br/>&gt; the abilities of making music, what solutions have any of you come<br/>&gt; up<br/>&gt; with in isolating the main box, so as to not pollute either the<br/>&gt; recording or your ears with fan noise?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sitting here with two of my smallest fans,<br/>&gt; Mom</p><p>There are a couple of companies that make ultra quiet fans and power<br/>supplies.
