Well, since he was a composer long before he added &apos;conductor&apos; to his resume, a fair knowledge of what he ends up being interested enough to compose it definitely sheds light on his interpretive, not to mention aesthetic, demeanor.</p><p>&gt; &gt;No, it wasn&apos;t as simple as that. What he said was not only was he<br/>&gt; &gt;an amateur, but that if Boulez were to revisit Ives&apos; music he<br/>&gt; &gt;(Boulez) would have to rewrite it. I find that condescending and<br/>&gt; &gt;missing the point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It depends on what he meant by re-write</p><p>I found it clear: it needed to be done for the music to be performed by him.</p><p>&gt;but some of Ives&apos; music may be unplayable as written</p><p>None that I am aware of, esp since most all has been performed and recorded.</p><p>&gt;and much of it is actually intended to be &quot;finished&quot; by the performer (the &gt;Universe symphony, for example).</p><p>The Universe may be one of the *only* examples!

I find his elitism and lack of a broad interest to be exactly as I&apos;ve come to expect from him, and it simply goes to further the one thing that I&apos;ve found more reliable than any other barometer: people make/play music that is a reflection of their own personalities.
