A very public appreciation for the craft and skill that went into all the variations, and then on top of that to have the gall to have a ripping good time of it! The flow of the variations is well-paced, and the compositional styles and techniques add to the strength of the piece.</p><p>I have to take issue with calls for a different piano timbre. Why? Well, I&apos;ve been listening to recordings of Nancarrow&apos;s music for 30 years, and am pleased to own the complete box set of the player piano works. What strikes me about the patch you used is how, in it&apos;s less-than-hi-fi reproduction, and with various quirks and anomolies (due, I&apos;m sure in some part, to tuning), it very much has a flavor of his hoary old beasts down in Mexico. I&apos;m not saying this wouldn&apos;t do well in another version, either with &apos;better&apos; sounds, or (someday, somehow) on an acoustic deal. But just as I have no interest in hearing Tom Waits on a pristine Bosendorfer, I&apos;m more than pleased with your current version.</p><p>Except the exposition sounds real stiff.</p><p>You made my afternoon (not bad to have your goofily cheerful variations play for me just after coming back from a great performance of Verdi&apos;s Requiem!). I hope Prent will pick this up for his Podcast, and if Kyle is listening I think it would fit well on his PostClassic station too.</p><p>You never posted a decent link, so if anyone else wants to hear it, look for FoumComplete at:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/2/funwithxenharmonicitymusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/2/funwithxenharmonicitymusic.htm</a></p><p>(I didn&apos;t have the time to try the simultaneous version. I think you must be a pretty sick person...)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2004 10:53:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

This is great.  I<br/>particularly like the idea of stating the &quot;straight&quot; theme in 12-tET<br/>first...  Actually, I can&apos;t recall anybody else doing a theme and<br/>variations like this.  There may be examples, but I can&apos;t recall<br/>them...</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
