Enjoyed it!</p><p>I also just listened for the first time.  I like it.  I think JI works<br/>in this style because of 1) the pure-wave timbres, which exaggerate<br/>the pureness (or lack of it) of the intervals, and 2) the<br/>repetitiveness, which lets the listener digest *specific* intervallic<br/>movement; I liked hearing the 1/1 - 8/7 a whole bunch of times because<br/>the novelty of the 7-limit can sustain that kind of interest in a way<br/>that the over-familiarity of 12et&apos;s tempered 5-limit can&apos;t.  At the<br/>beginning, my 3-limit listening dominance tries to perceptually force<br/>the 8/7 into some kind of whole-tone; but by the end, the precise<br/>repetitions force me to adopt a unique perceptual label to apply to<br/>what is an obviously intentional phenomenon.  I&apos;m no psychologist, but<br/>that might be a reasonable description of the process by which humans<br/>assign meaning to music in the first place.</p><p>This piece sounds to me like an explorative work - the best parts of<br/>it suggest that there&apos;s a *lot* more that could be done, lots more<br/>places to go.  I would be really glad if you continued down the path<br/>of JI-techno and brought back further specimens! :)</p><p>-chris</p></div><h3><a id=12228 href="#12228">ðŸ”—</a>akjmicro &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2006 8:16:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Magnus-</p><p>Very much enjoyed this....thanks!
