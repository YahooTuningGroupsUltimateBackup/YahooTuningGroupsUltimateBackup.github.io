When I first got it, I wasn&apos;t aware of the comma, so I thought I was going cuckoo, couldn&apos;t get it in tune the way I&apos;m used to, now it&apos;s ok. Haven&apos;t written that many 34 pieces, it&apos;s real tough to get a handle on, but I love it to death...best...Hstick</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
