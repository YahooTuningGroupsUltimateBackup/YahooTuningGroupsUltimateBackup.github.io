Here I went for this kind of<br/>flavor by using remote modal transpositions in a special kind of<br/>circulating 12-note modified meantone tuning where the eight fifths in<br/>the range of F-C# are tempered narrow at 2/7-comma (~6.14 cents),<br/>Zarlino&apos;s famous temperament, while the other four are equally wide<br/>(about 6.42 cents). Here&apos;s a link to a Scala file for this tuning:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zarte84a.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zarte84a.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>Please let me hasten to emphasize that some variety of Pythagorean<br/>intonation would have been the historically appropriate period choice,<br/>in contrast to this frankly &quot;neo-medieval&quot; rendition. However, for the<br/>setting of _O Elsa_, this modified meantone version does parallel, and<br/>indeed exaggerate, a nuance of the kind of Pythgorean keyboard tuning<br/>evidently in vogue around 1400-1450, as explained below.</p><p>An ASCII score of _O Elsa, ductrix mea_ is available at:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Please let me candidly confess that I am still considering how best to<br/>notate the rhythm for some of the passages of _In Hora Observationis_;<br/>I&apos;d like to get it into a good score, with the audio file a kind of<br/>record in the meantime.</p><p>Anyway, while the nearer regions of my modified meantone variation on<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma temperament of 1558 are meant for music in a<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic style, the remote region offers thirds and<br/>sixths in a Pythagorean-to-septimal range for the kind of &quot;bracing&quot;<br/>intonation we&apos;re discussing in these fauxbourdon settings.</p><p>_In Hora Observationis_ uses the seven basic steps of a C Phrygian<br/>mode plus Gb (equivalent to Bb in untransposed E Phrygian), with steps<br/>here shown in rounded cents:</p><p>                           575<br/>                           Gb<br/>     C    Db     Eb     F      G    Ab       Bb      C<br/>     0    71    287    504    696   779     996    1200<br/>       71   217    217    192    83     217     204</p><p>Cadences generally have intervals in a Pythagorean-septimal range, and<br/>often feature compact semitones at 71 or 83 cents, the former the just<br/>25:24 chromatic semitone of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma, located at C-C# and<br/>F-F# as expressed in a regular meantone spelling (or here C-Db, F-Gb).<br/>Illustrative are an internal cadence on the second step of the mode Db<br/>(equivalent to F in E Phrygian), and the final cadence on C, with<br/>vertical and melodic intervals shown in rounded cents:</p><p>    C     +71     Db               Bb   +204     C<br/>  (504)         (492)            (492)         (504)<br/>    G     +83     Ab               F    +192     G<br/>(913,408)     (1200,708)       (925,434)     (1200,696)<br/>    Eb   -217     Db               Db    -71     C</p><p>While the cadential sonority Eb-G-C at 0-408-913 cents is not too far<br/>from a regular Pythagorean sonority with 81:64 major third and 27:16<br/>major sixth (0-408-906 cents), Db-F-Bb in the final cadence at<br/>0-434-925 cents approximates a just septimal sonority of 7:9:12<br/>(0-435-933 cents). It remains an open question whether some<br/>14th-century performers following an approach to cadences advocated by<br/>Marchettus of Padua in his _Lucidarium_ (1318) may have arrived at<br/>more or less septimal sonorities of this kind -- although the<br/>tempering of fifths and fourths by more than six cents seems more of a<br/>neo-medieval element.</p><p>In _O Elsa_, when the original D Dorian is transposed to Bb Dorian in<br/>the modified meantone, we get this scale, including relevant<br/>accidentals:</p><p>                      587     779         1092<br/>                       E      Gb           A<br/> Bb     C   Db     Eb      F      G    Ab      Bb<br/> 0     204 275    492     708    900  983     1200<br/>   204   71    217    217    192    83    217</p><p>While the unaltered steps and intervals retain a Pythagorean-septimal<br/>flavor overall, the final cadence on Bb brings about a special<br/>intonational effect with a likely 15th-century precedent. In this<br/>formula, as expressed in untransposed Dorian on D, a sixth sonority of<br/>F-A-D leads to the penultimate E-G#-C#, resolving to D-A-D with<br/>expansions of major third to fifth and major sixth to octave. Here is<br/>the transposed version in our temperament:</p><p>         Bb   -108     A    +108     Bb<br/>       (492)         (504)         (492)<br/>         F    -121     E    +121     F<br/>     (925,434)     (887,383)     (1200,708)<br/>         Db    -71     C    -204     Bb</p><p>While the antepenultimate Db-F-Bb at 0-434-925 cents is close to a<br/>just 7:9:12, the penultimate C-E-A at 0-383-887 cents is Zarlino&apos;s<br/>regular meantone approximation of a just 12:15:20 (0-386-884 cents),<br/>with the major thirds Db-F and C-E differing by a full 50 cents!</p><p>Interestingly, a parallel although not quite so exaggerated contrast<br/>occurs in a typical early 15th-century Pythagorean keyboard tuning<br/>where most or all written sharps are rendered as Pythagorean flats, so<br/>that cadences involving these written sharps have altered sizes of<br/>thirds and sixths very close to the 5-based ratios later made the<br/>standard in meantone. Thus in untransposed D Dorian, we might have:</p><p>         D    -114     Db   +114     D<br/>       (498)         (498)         (498)<br/>         A    -114     Ab   +114     A<br/>     (906,408)     (882,384)     (1200,702)<br/>         F     -90     E    -204     D</p><p>Here the regular Pythagorean third and sixth in F-A-D (0-408-906<br/>cents) are followed by what are called &quot;schismatic&quot; variations in<br/>E-Ab-Db (0-384-882 cents), with the Pythagorean diminished fourth and<br/>seventh only a 32805:32768 schisma (about 1.95 cents) from their pure<br/>5-based counterparts at 5:4 and 5:3 (386 and 884 cents).</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s a question of &quot;something old, something new...&quot;; anyway,<br/>thanks for your encouraging response, and for any patience you may<br/>have with this crude attempt to sketch out some of the math without<br/>totally losing view of the music itself.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=11829 href="#11829">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2006 1:40:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I must admit, I don&apos;t have the time right now to delve into the math<br/>enough to understand it in detail!
