While my reactions, of course,<br/>reflect one musical perspective, I hope that they may speak to the<br/>worldwide appeal of your music.</p><p>_For Margo_ reminded me a bit of an orchestral version of a medieval<br/>European dance called an estampie or istampita, with some 14th-century<br/>Italian pieces in this style seeming to reflect a certain Near Eastern<br/>influence. In the 20th century, medieval and Renaissance European<br/>music was sometimes adopted for larger modern orchestas, although the<br/>original performances were likely for small ensembles and the like.</p><p>The melodic style suggested to me Persian or more generally Near<br/>Eastern elements, but with the rhythmic animation and very tuneful<br/>motives showing an affinity not only to the _radif_ or repertory of<br/>Persian pieces and modes as realized by a given performer or ensemble,<br/>but also the kind of medieval European style I mention above, where<br/>dance music can shade into more &quot;abstract&quot; musical meditations.</p><p>Anyway, I am most complimented to be honored with such fitting music,<br/>and must try to offer some worthy musical response.</p><p>The _Improvised_ piece likewise reminds me of some _radif_ music I<br/>have heard, in a setar style that also somehow evokes for me a Spanish<br/>tradition. It is fascinating to ask to what degree this connection<br/>might reflect the great Islamic cultural tradition in Andalusia, which<br/>may have helped to shape both medieval Spanish music in other regions,<br/>and thus ultimately modern offshoots also; and to what degree it might<br/>represent the interchange of world musics and improvisatory traditions<br/>now taking place.</p><p>These pieces, with their tuning systems based respectively in a<br/>rational string division and 96-EDO, show how intonational diversity,<br/>melodic subtlety, and creative textures can all reinforce one another.<br/>I was fascinated to note that _For Margo_, based on a division of a<br/>string length of 124, includes such intervals as small neutral<br/>seconds, thirds, and sevenths at 124/115, 62/51, and 31/17, or about<br/>130, 338, and 1040 cents -- among my favorite sizes, as well as not<br/>too far from reported averages for Persian music (how impressionistic<br/>such estimates).</p><p>Again, Shaahin, congratulations on pieces which express both a dynamic<br/>direction for Persian music, and a creative quest for a world musical<br/>language -- one language among many in a world which can appreciate<br/>both the diversity of traditions and the possibility for mutual<br/>appreciation and communication.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
