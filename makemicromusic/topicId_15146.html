Comparing music and software, we notice that software needs to be written and maintained for specific technical demands: free software authors have their jobs guaranteed. But for a composer, it seems that specific demands grant only *ocasional* requests. It is more likely that composing will become mostly an investment (for other musical services like teaching/playing) rather than a sevice itself.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p><p>--<br/>  &apos;-------------------------------------------------------------------.<br/>Hudson Lacerda <a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/</a></p><p>*THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS: <a href="http://costofwar.com/">http://costofwar.com/</a></p><p>microabc -- free software for microtonal music<br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-about.html">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-about.html</a></p><p>*N&iuml;&iquest;&half;O DEIXE SEU VOTO SUMIR! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&iuml;&iquest;&half;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a><br/>  .-------------------------------------------------------------------&apos;<br/>--</p><p>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Voc&iuml;&iquest;&half; quer respostas para suas perguntas?

For those who didn&apos;t have cozy jobs they would<br/>have to travel and preform like the French &quot;Jongluers&quot; which where<br/>traveling minstrals, actors, dancer, and just overall entertainers.<br/>Besides these traveling musicians there were others country like them<br/>traveling all over Europe. Such as (another french)Troubadors,<br/>Trouveres, Menestral(spain),and others. These traveling musicians<br/>would also have festivals were only performers where allowed. There<br/>they would exchange songs, story&apos;s, dramas,  and dances. To my<br/>recollection this is the first open sharing of music.  Only traded by<br/>musicians. They new nothing else but to help each other in their<br/>respective jobs/lifes/existences and learn from each other. Today we<br/>don&apos;t help each other as much, we don&apos;t share Ideas, and everyone<br/>seems to know everything so there nothing the teach. Yes we should be<br/>payed for our work, but no we shouldn&apos;t start complaining when people<br/>don&apos;t buy our albums and just rip a tune off it. Really we aren&apos;t<br/>doing are jobs very well if there is only one tune people want to hear<br/>from us. What is the point in buying a whole album of crap when you<br/>only like one song or piece. Me personality I do not share music,  I<br/>collect record albums (12, 45, Lp&apos;s) and avant guard music and I<br/>support the Artists, but I think most of the music that is being<br/>shared today is from artist that deserve it.</p><p>Thanks for your time</p><p>Rian</p></div><h3><a id=15167 href="#15167">ðŸ”—</a>kevin ryan &#x3C;bentivi_cdo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2006 11:19:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>you wrote:<br/>&gt; Sorry, but you seem to be completely at ease with<br/>&gt; being amoral.</p><p>It depends on whose morality you&apos;re talking about.

People commit<br/>&gt; rape, but the fact it is happening does not make it<br/>&gt; ok. Simply making an action easy does not make it<br/>&gt; acceptable. But, hey, if you can rip all that music<br/>&gt; and not pay a dime for it, why not?</p><p>Here&apos;s our dilemma:  I&apos;ve been trying as hard as I can<br/>to avoid the ethical/moral debate on the issue,<br/>striving for a historical, pragmatic outlook.  You<br/>seem to want to only look at the right/wrong aspect,<br/>which I am no more interested in than in arguing about<br/>God.</p><p>&gt; &gt;(Opening up a whole &apos;nother can of worms, but<br/>&gt; perhaps more on topic:  It&apos;s also possible now to<br/>&gt; pirate many high end softsynths, music apps, vst&apos;s,<br/>&gt; etc. with<br/>&gt; &gt;microtonal capabilities...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK with you?</p><p>Ok with me that it&apos;s possible?  I don&apos;t really have a<br/>say in that matter... ;)</p><p>&gt; Some day we&apos;ll talk about Harry Partch. Damn, I sure<br/>&gt; am glad Harry didn&apos;t live this long...</p><p>I would, at this point much rather talk about Partch<br/>or anything more directly musical than be called<br/>&quot;amoral.&quot;  One intent of my original posting<br/>(requesting CD&apos;s at local libraries instead of P2P)<br/>was to suggest a means of getting more microtonal<br/>music into our communities.  I didn&apos;t expect for it to<br/>turn into a debate.  If you do have more to say on the<br/>matter then please respond in Metatuning.</p><p>Thanks!<br/>K</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Sponsored Link</p><p>Compare mortgage rates for today.<br/>Get up to 5 free quotes.<br/><a href="http://Www2.nextag.com">Www2.nextag.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=15168 href="#15168">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2006 11:27:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Sorry, but you seem to be completely at ease with being amoral.<br/>//<br/>&gt; Somebody PLEASE say when metatuning is appropriate!</p><p>It&apos;s inappropriate to post something like this first sentence<br/>on either list, in my opinion.  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15169 href="#15169">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2006 12:01:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kevin,</p><p>To address your very last point, good call: we&apos;ll move this to metatuning.
