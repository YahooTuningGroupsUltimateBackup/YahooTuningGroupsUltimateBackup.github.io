NI Reaktor supports it,<br/>&gt; among other things.<br/>&gt;<br/>Last I checked, NI Reaktor supported OSC but it was really just a wrapping for MIDI, sort of MIDI messages over OSC. Looking for information, I found this:</p><p><a href="http://barely.a.live.fm/pd/OSC/r3osc-2.html">http://barely.a.live.fm/pd/OSC/r3osc-2.html</a></p><p>which makes it seem that they&apos;ve limited themselves to the same values that would be usable by MIDI.  (At least, it was the case with Reaktor 3).</p><p>I originally started blue some five years ago, less than a year after I started programming.  At the time I was also just getting into Csound, and so blue was originally tailored to handle things I wanted to do with it.  Over the years, the idea to make blue not be bound to Csound but other synthesizers like JMax, JSyn, SAOL, or others has crossed my mind, as well as even a no synthesizer system and making it a generic OSC system.  In the end, I stuck with Csound due partly to prior investment in time, but also because I found that Csound does most anything I ask of it.</p><p>I found that Csound&apos;s note format was something really good for me to build blue around and works well for how I think about music.  OSC would be fine too I guess, but is even more generic, and I think may have been too hard for me to build around when I started blue.  Perhaps someday I&apos;ll build a new blue that works around OSC or another message format, but probably not anytime in the near future.  (However, blue&apos;s source code is open source under the GPL, and I encourage anyone who would want to take it and repurpose it for whatever they like to feel free to do so.)</p><p>&gt; My only gripe with CSound is that it wasn&apos;t designed to be realtime.<br/>&gt; That, and it&apos;s apparently very user-unfriendly.</p><p>I end up rendering with Csound in realtime when I work on music with blue, but I am not interacting with the music that is rendering, only listening.  When blue goes to render, it saves a temporary CSD that Csound is able to use and then calls Csound, and this can be set to render in realtime.  On the whole, it&apos;s been enough for me and it suits my way of working, though I understand how that would not work for others.</p><p>As for user-unfriendliness, I think Csound has a bit of a learning curve, but on the whole, the things I&apos;ve put into blue help me manage the complexity and keep me focused on the music-making aspect of it all.  Without blue, though, when I first started using Csound with just a text editor, I did find it a bit trying.</p><p>&gt; &gt;At least I can take comfort that your reaction to the idea was<br/>&gt; &gt;positive. =)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, yes.  Let me ask: can you do smooth scrolling in your GUI?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I understand exactly what you are asking, but I&apos;ve tried my best to make the UI responsive and smooth.  There are a couple of occasions when scrolling slows down, but on the whole, I don&apos;t find enough difference from native applications to make me feel that it&apos;s awkward or drastically different in any way.</p><p>steven</p></div><h3><a id=8550 href="#8550">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2005 5:35:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; My only gripe with CSound is that it wasn&apos;t designed to be realtime.<br/>&gt; &gt; That, and it&apos;s apparently very user-unfriendly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually, Csound works pretty well in realtime, although some version do<br/>&gt;this better than others (the best being CsoundAV).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Art Hunkins (<a href="http://www31.brinkster.com/abhunkins/">http://www31.brinkster.com/abhunkins/</a>) writes primarily<br/>&gt;realtime pieces for Csound, some of which use on-screen widgets, and<br/>&gt;other that use a combination of on-screen widgets and MIDI controllers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve written a set of pieces in collaboration with Art that are for<br/>&gt;realtime Csound (<a href="http://mysterybear.net/article/6/cloud-dragon">http://mysterybear.net/article/6/cloud-dragon</a>) as well<br/>&gt;as a Csound-based sruti box<br/>&gt;(<a href="http://mysterybear.net/article/8/drone-instrument---sruti-box">http://mysterybear.net/article/8/drone-instrument---sruti-box</a>).

I&apos;m not saying that it should be that way or that it&apos;s inevitable, simply that it is often the case.  Sometimes when I use Csound I miss having knobs and sliders and patch cables (virtual or not) and having a bunch of presets to choose from.  And with a more conventional hardware/software synth, sometimes you want to be able to get inside and twiddle things that the the manufacturer/developer didn&apos;t think to expose, or exposed in a clumsy way (like tuning tables). Ideally, we should have a system that has the best of both worlds, and there&apos;s no good reason why we can&apos;t.</p><p>For geeks of my particular code-oriented bent, Csound just fits better, warts and all, and front-ends like Steven&apos;s blue program (which I just started using today, and already like a whole lot) make it even better, but it&apos;s certainly not for everyone.</p><p>- Dave</p></div><h3><a id=8581 href="#8581">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2005 1:12:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Have you checked out Open Sound Control?
