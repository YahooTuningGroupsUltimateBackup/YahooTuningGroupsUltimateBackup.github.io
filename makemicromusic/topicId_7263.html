In my view boostrapping it up to 9-limit JI adds a<br/>&gt;dimension which makes it more than merely mildly interesting, and turns<br/>&gt;it into a powerful compositional technique.</p><p>How would this be done?

I do agree with Hans here:</p><p>&gt; The portamento certainly helps but it might be considered cheating</p><p>Of course, the pitch glides take place primarily from one 5-tet<br/>scale step to another, but they seem to help to increase the melodic<br/>&quot;resources.&quot; Essentially, for each melodic interval considered<br/>as a step, you also have the same melodic interval considered<br/>as a glide. Taking this even one step further, a rapid<br/>glide up and down (or down and up) are other kinds of melodic<br/>intervals. So, by varying which kind of interval occurs in different<br/>places, you can increase the variety.</p><p>Hans also wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, I would not say the other pieces were merely rhythmic<br/>&gt; or that there were less melodies in them than in the current one.<br/>&gt; But I like the piece!</p><p>I certainly did not intend to insult Aaron&apos;s piece:</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/5tet_funk.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/5tet_funk.mp3</a></p><p>or my own:</p><p><a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/PentaFunk.mp3">http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/PentaFunk.mp3</a></p><p>(And please note that I said &quot;primarily rhythmic&quot; and<br/>not &quot;merely rhythmic.&quot;) I guess what I was trying to do<br/>was to contrast the overall feel of the pieces,<br/>which may speak to compositional intent.<br/>For my own piece (Pentafunk), I conceived it more as a<br/>rhythmic chord pattern than as a  melody line<br/>(as in Pentacle).  While I cannot speak to Aaron&apos;s intent, my<br/>impression of 5-tet_funk is that it is built around an<br/>extended bass line, which forms the basis for a complex and<br/>fascinating improvisation. While there certainly are<br/>melodic elements, I would be surprised to find that<br/>these were at the heart of the piece -- rather, what melodies<br/>there are appear to grow out of the bass.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=7267 href="#7267">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64@...</h3><span>8/16/2004 5:51:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From:  &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@c...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On an another topic, we have more to do ahead of us.
