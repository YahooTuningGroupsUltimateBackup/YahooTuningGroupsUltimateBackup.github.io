I am really pretty ignorant about<br/>&gt;this genre of music, but are we talking about 7/6 and 7/4, or neutral<br/>&gt;thirds/sevenths of some sort? What about augmented fourths?</p><p>Short answer: nobody really knows.  Nobody even knows if there&apos;s<br/>any consistency to what goes on.</p><p>Chords... depends on what you consider a chord.  The biggest<br/>deviations from 12 in jazz are probably in sax or vocal melodies.<br/>I&apos;ve heard big bands hit some JI stuff.  Guitarists can bend<br/>notes, but only up, and most JI is flat of 12.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
