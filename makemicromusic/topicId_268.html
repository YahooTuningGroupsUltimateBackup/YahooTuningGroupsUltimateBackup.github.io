It looks like there&apos;s a lot of other good<br/>stuff at that site. It has been common practice among great jazz players to<br/>quote from other standards all the time in their solos.</p><p>&gt; Plundering is, seemingly, the way of the future...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Internet, Napster, etc., etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right now, the economic model means that these things have to be shut<br/>&gt; down.</p><p>I&apos;ve wondered for a few years now at the phenomenum of sampling by<br/>non-instrument playing composers. Sooner or later, if new people don&apos;t learn<br/>to play instruments, and if new composers can&apos;t afford to record their work<br/>as everyone wants to download it from Napster for free, we&apos;ll eventually run<br/>out of music to sample. All music will become merely samples of samples of<br/>samples...</p><p>This could be the end of music as we know it, until sometime in the future a<br/>few eccentric loners read manuscripts about the archaic practice of actually<br/>&quot;playing&quot; an &quot;instrument&quot;, and with careful study try to build and learn to<br/>play instruments and re-create this for themselves...</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div>
