A new feature<br/>there makes it much easier to make instruments<br/>into orchestra files - a bit of set up is needed<br/>to make it possible for FTS to work with<br/>a new C-Sound instrument, then after that it<br/>can be selected from a drop list just liek a midi voice<br/>and user can set its pan position just as they<br/>do for midi  - the user doesn&apos;t<br/>need to edit anything - except to vary the<br/>params if they want to do that.<br/>FTS does all the editing needed to combine<br/>the instruments together to make<br/>the orchestra and to make all the necessary function table<br/>statements and initialisationinstruments<br/>for the scores.</p><p>Adding a new instrument also is just a matter<br/>of a few minutes work now for most instruments.<br/>Add a word auto to the [GLOBALS] section,<br/>the params (identifying which are the amplitudes<br/>and which are the frequencies) to the<br/>[PARAMS] section,and just copy the orchestra<br/>and head of the score to the  [ORC] and<br/>[SCO] section of the file used to descrive<br/>the instrument for FTS - and it is then immediately<br/>ready to use. Others need a bit more work,<br/>but most don&apos;t seem to need much done at all<br/>of the examples I&apos;ve tried.</p><p>With ones that require zakinit and zawm<br/>- I can&apos;t see how to do those yet,<br/>but that seems to be the main exception<br/>so far.</p><p>Also on your post about p.c. keyboard chords<br/>- you can assign chords to a part in FTS<br/>using its custom voices, and you can assign<br/>a part to a row of a keyboard,so you can<br/>set your p.c. keyboard up so that a row<br/>of teh keyboard plays chords of a particular<br/>type where you can either make them<br/>exact tuning so that e.g. 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4<br/>plays the exact harmonic seventh chord<br/>even though it may not be attuned to other<br/>notes in the scale - ro you can set it up<br/>to quantise the chords to the scale so<br/>that e.g. it plays the nearest pitches to the<br/>chord notes whatever tuning you are exploring.</p><p>There are examples of this in the new<br/>Mouse and P.C. Keyboard Music view which<br/>is there already in FTS 2.4.</p><p>I can add more and make it easier<br/>to use. Inded, it would be reasonably easy<br/>to let the user specify any chord<br/>symbol for any position in the<br/>keyboard indeed.</p><p>Also the functino keys aren&apos;t particularly needed<br/>when playing from the keyboard so<br/>I could let the user assign chords<br/>to the function keys.</p><p>I may have a go at that for the<br/>release of FTS 3.0 that I&apos;m working<br/>on right now, and add it in if it<br/>proves easy to do, otherwise maybe<br/>a bit later as I hope to release<br/>it any day now, well possibly next<br/>week say.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
