I&apos;m<br/>guessing this is because Bach is recognizable to many, his pieces were<br/>written before the standardization of 12-TET and thus not biased<br/>towards 12-TET itself.  So I decided to use MIDI files of Bach pieces<br/>for my testing.

You can specify which notes these get mapped to according to a text file.

I am working in the dark as far as choosing MIDI music<br/>files to test &gt;12 tunings.  I understand many of these tunings were<br/>created for specific compositional requirements, but it would help to<br/>have a pool of test compositions in MIDI file form to test the Scala<br/>loading functionality of various synths for these tunings.  Otherwise,<br/>with my relatively limited microtuning experience, I alone cannot<br/>determine by ear the correctness of the tuning implementation in the<br/>synth.</p><p>Paolo</p><p>This testing process has uncovered several breaking</p></div><h3><a id=16574 href="#16574">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2007 5:12:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s a program for Windows systems called Midiconv, which can take<br/>a<br/>&gt; 12-note per octave MIDI file and remap the notes to any number of<br/>&gt; pitches per octave.</p><p>That&apos;s easily done using Scala.
