As it happened, simply<br/>subscribing at my new address via e-mail rather than the Web interface<br/>seemed neatly to solve my technical problems, which might reflect my<br/>use of a text-based Internet account and browser.</p><p>To start on the right foot, I&apos;d like to share a musical example<br/>addressing a question recently raised: the qualities of Phi as an<br/>interval ratio, about 1.618 or ~833.09 cents. What you&apos;ll hear in this<br/>example is an approximation in the Peppermint 24 tuning, ~832.76 cents:</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/pmntphi1.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/pmntphi1.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>This is one of my favorite intervals, and for me belongs to what I<br/>would call the family of &quot;supraminor and submajor&quot; intervals. Other<br/>examples would be supraminor thirds at around 17:14 (~336.13 cents),<br/>with this passage also providing an example as I&apos;ll discuss shortly;<br/>submajor thirds at around 21:17 (~365.83 cents); and submajor sixths<br/>at around 28:17 (~863.87 cents).</p><p>To explain the notation for my example below (for people reading on<br/>the Web, much better if you can view with the original formatting,<br/>maybe &quot;Expand Messages&quot; or the like), I should say a bit about<br/>Peppermint. Mostly it&apos;s a tuning very gratefully borrowed from Erv<br/>Wilson and Keenan Pepper, the first of whom noted its position on his<br/>Scale Tree, and the second of whom independently proposed it on the<br/>Tuning list in September 2000.</p><p>As soon as I learned that the fifths were around 704.10 cents, I was<br/>very excited, and indeed it&apos;s almost as if this were a custom<br/>optimization designed especially for me. I could write a long essay on<br/>this (and have written more than one), but suffice it to say that I<br/>have a passion for regular major and minor thirds around 14:11 and<br/>13:11 (about 417.51/289.21 cents), and supraminor and submajor thirds<br/>around 17:14 and 21:17. In the Wilson/Pepper temperament, all four of<br/>these intervals are within 1.5 cents of the just ratios.</p><p>This very nicely fits the &quot;neo-medieval&quot; music I make based largely on<br/>13th-14th century Western European styles, where rather complex and<br/>active thirds and sixths often resolve to stable fifths and fourths.<br/>As has been discussed here, what you consider a &quot;good&quot; tuning can<br/>often depend on what style you&apos;re following, and my passion for<br/>Peppermint might be an apt example.</p><p>To get Peppermint 24, I took a basic 12-note tuning and added another<br/>12-note chain of fifths at the distance of about 58.680 cents, so as<br/>to produce some pure 7:6 minor thirds (~266.87 cents) as well as lots<br/>of other new intervals quite close to just ratios of 2, 3, 7, 9, 11,<br/>and 13.</p><p>In notating my example of the &quot;Phi sixth,&quot; I use an asterisk (*) to<br/>show a note on the upper 12-note keyboard, raised by 58.680 cents or<br/>so. Here that becomes relevant for the next to last chord or sonority,<br/>as we&apos;ll see.</p><p>(3/4)             (2/4)<br/>  1    2  +   3   + | 1   +  2   + | 1    2   | 1    2 ||<br/>  F#4     G4  F#4 F4  F#4 G4 F#4 F4  F#4        F#*4<br/>  C#4     D4  C#4 C4  C#4 D4 C#4 C4  C#4        C#*4<br/>  Bb3                                Bb3  G#*3  F*3</p><p>Mostly this passage is an example of what I call &quot;Phi drift.&quot; The<br/>upper voices start at the supraminor third and sixth (about 336 and<br/>833 cents above the lowest voice), and move in parallel fourths: first<br/>up to a sonority with the usual major third and sixth (around 416 and<br/>912 cents), then back to the supraminor third and sixth, then down to<br/>the second and fifth (approximating a JI chord of 8:9:12, another of<br/>my favorites), then back up to the supraminor sonority, and so forth.</p><p>What I&apos;m going for, to use a medieval European term, is &quot;imperfect<br/>consonance&quot;: a mildly unstable texture pleasant in itself, but with<br/>some tension or inconclusiveness eventually leading to a resolution of<br/>some kind. What I&apos;d call a Phi sixth is not &quot;dissonant&quot; but a bit<br/>&quot;vague&quot; or &quot;cloudy&quot; -- I once commented to Erv Wilson that it&apos;s the<br/>kind of interval Debussy might have used around 1900 if it had been<br/>part of the prevailing intonational palette. How&apos;s &quot;impressionistic&quot;?</p><p>Here the eventual resolution illustrates one of the features of the<br/>24-note tuning: the lowest voice shifts from Bb on the lower keyboard<br/>to G#*, forming a wide major third and sixth with the upper voices at<br/>around 437.38 and 933.13 cents, with the sixth a pure 12:7, very close<br/>to 7:9:12. This sonority resolves in a typical medieval fashion, with<br/>the major third expanding to a fifth and the major sixth to an octave.</p><p>To put things less technically, this large major third is closer in<br/>size to the fifth and so can resolve to it more efficiently, and<br/>likewise the large major sixth to the octave; at the same time, these<br/>intervals have ratios at or very close to a simple 9:7 or 12:7. For<br/>me, &quot;audibly just thirds with small integer ratios&quot; often means 7:6<br/>and 9:7, in which I find purity, efficiency, and excitement.</p><p>What I want to do here, in discussing Phi sixths, is to put my musical<br/>impressions in a bit of context, as I hope the musical example itself<br/>might help to do. Specifically, since I regard thirds and sixths as<br/>active or &quot;imperfect&quot; consonances, a Phi sixth seems a natural part of<br/>the landscape.</p><p>Here I might quickly comment that in addition to these supraminor or<br/>Phi sixths, actually augmented fifths (e.g. Bb-F# in this example),<br/>Peppermint 24 also has some close approximations of the 13:8 or<br/>&quot;harmonic&quot; neutral sixth at about 842.30 cents, or about 1.77 cents<br/>larger than the just ratio of ~840.53 cents. This is realized as a<br/>regular minor sixth plus the 59-cent interval between the keyboards,<br/>for example A-F*.</p><p>One of the consequences of my association with George Secor is that<br/>I&apos;ve acquired a taste for 13:8 to complement my predilection for the<br/>nearby Phi sixth. In Peppermint 24, both sizes of sixths are<br/>available. By the way, I would like warmly to thank George for lending<br/>a lot of the creative impetus leading to and enriching my adventure<br/>with this 24-note system, and to note that his HTT-29 not only<br/>provided an inspiring precedent, but offers a near-just system with<br/>greater overall accuracy for most of the ratios supported by<br/>Peppermint, not to mention a wider range of intervals.</p><p>These remarks as to the Phi sixth and Peppermint might give some idea<br/>of what is for me a &quot;usual&quot; musical style or tuning system, possibly<br/>filling in a bit of perspective for my next intended post on some<br/>delighted first impressions of what I would call a less conventional<br/>and very beautiful tuning: 14-tET.</p><p>By the way, here&apos;s a link to a Scala file for Peppermint 24:</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/peprmint.scl">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/peprmint.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>and here&apos;s one to Scala files for George Secor&apos;s HTT-29, HTT-17, and<br/>the superset of HTT-41:</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/messages/7574">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/messages/7574</a>&gt;</p><p>Again, thanks to the many people who have made this forum possible.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6374 href="#6374">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
