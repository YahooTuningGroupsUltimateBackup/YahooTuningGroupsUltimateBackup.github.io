I&apos;m not trying to use a hammer on this kind of stuff, but the central point is whether a topic, for whatever reason, gets so far away from our main purpose that it ends up annoying someone rather than enlightening them. I&apos;m not perfect, so I may have stepped in early, but seeing as traffic is high, a topic that isn&apos;t really about our reason for existence is good to find another home.</p><p>&gt;Besides, I&apos;m not a member of that group.</p><p>But you know it&apos;s easy to join, and it was started for exactly this purpose: to have a place to start or continue discussions from our community(ies) when we want to keep signal/noise ratio high.</p><p>&gt;It was a joke.
