The two chords at maximum distance in the hexatonic cycle--forming a &quot;diameter&quot; of it--are called hexatonic poles, e.g. E-minor/Ab-major (they share no common-tones, but there is a maximally-smooth voice-leading between them where each voice moves by one scale step). Rick Cohn has written quite a bit about hexatonic poles - one of his articles shows a piece by Brahms that actually goes through this chord progression, which is difficult to explain using devices of traditional tonality. People also talk about the &quot;hexatonic scale&quot; (C-C#-E-F-G#-A) analogous to the octatonic scale. It&apos;s the hexachord used in Schoenberg&apos;s _Ode to Napoleon_, and all of its 5-note subsets belong to the same set-class. Strangely, Messiaen missed it in his list of &quot;modes de transposition limitee&quot;.
