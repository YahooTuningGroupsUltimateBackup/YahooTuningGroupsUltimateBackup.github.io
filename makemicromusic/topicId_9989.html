They just play in strict<br/>12-tet,  and things should work out.</p><p>Actually, you will hear that there<br/>are places where the sax line is leaping all around while the harmony<br/>holds in the background,  here it gets off,  and the player might inflect<br/>some notes a bit.</p><p>For example,  the sax might be emphasizing a G,  and<br/>the harmony in the recorded part is Eb-Bb-Db  (forming a 4:5:6:7),  but<br/>then the sax might decorate the G with an occasional leap to various<br/>tones,  including a Db,  which will be out of tune relative to the<br/>recorded part.  I find the beating somewhat charming myself,  but I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be averse to the player making an adjustment for it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  it is basically rotating a 13 limit diamond to various 12 Et degrees? /<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes that&apos;s the idea. . .  .though actually,  there are some 17, 19s in<br/>there as well.

My player is set<br/>on &quot;repeat,&quot; so the end was immediately followed by the beginning<br/>again. Ok, just now I turned &quot;repeat&quot; mode off.</p><p>I like this piece quite a lot. To me it sounds serious and yet<br/>playful, &quot;playfully serious&quot; if that makes sense. I like the fact<br/>that it sounds very 21st-century, and I cannot pigeonhole it easily<br/>into any genre, although it sounds familiar (in the sense of<br/>resembling previously-heard music and musical styles) at various<br/>points. For me, it strkes a good balance between sounding novel and<br/>sounding familiar, in ways that I don&apos;t directly link to your (very<br/>effective) blending of ET and JI.</p><p>On the latter point, I think adding just harmonic accompaniment to<br/>an essentially 12tET instrument and melody is a nice and reasonable<br/>thing to do. I was of course trying to mentally substitute the sound<br/>of a human-operated sax for the piano, and I think I did a<br/>reasonable job of it, althoug the piano / MIDI version is nice in<br/>its own right. (I can&apos;t think of any instances in which, for me,<br/>MIDI has compared very well to a performance of the same piece by<br/>musicians. Is that a pretty universal observation?) It would be cool<br/>to hear the similarities and differences between the demo and the<br/>piece performed as you intend.</p><p>Regards,<br/>George</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey<br/>&lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a new piece I&apos;ve written for alto sax and recorded computer<br/>music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s in what I&apos;d call &quot;CJI&quot;  -- Crystallizing Just Intonation --<br/>the sax<br/>&gt; plays in 12-tet,  but the chords in the recorded<br/>part &quot;crystallize&quot; around<br/>&gt; the sax notes in Just sonorities.
