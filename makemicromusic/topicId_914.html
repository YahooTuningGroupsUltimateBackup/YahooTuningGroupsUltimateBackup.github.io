Until I found out<br/>&gt;that Euler couldn&apos;t do it, I thought I was mentally deficient,<br/>&gt;because I&apos;d tried on and off for a long time to crack the code.</p><p>I suspect your memory is playing tricks on you.  Latin squares of any size are<br/>easy to create.

Since<br/>you mentioned Euler, I suspect you were thinking of the Greco-Latin square problem.<br/>In that case, the problem was to arrange the n^2 ordered pairs into an n by n<br/>square such that each pair was used exactly once and each first component was<br/>used exactly once in each row and column and each second component was used exactly<br/>once in each row and column.  Euler was able to construct solutions for all cases<br/>except those where n was even but not a multiple of 4.  In the late 1950s some<br/>American mathematicians found a 10 by 10 Greco-Latin square and since then I believe<br/>Greco-Latin squares have been found for all sizes but 2 and 6.</p><p>David Bowen</p></div>
