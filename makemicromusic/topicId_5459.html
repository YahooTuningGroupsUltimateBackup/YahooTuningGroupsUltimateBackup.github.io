It is the not<br/>Pythagorean tuning. The range is a gamut, from G to f&apos;&apos;; the<br/>directions in the manuscript, as I understand them, are as follows:</p><p>Start with G; place the fret for A 1/9 of the distance in.<br/>place the fret for G# 1/19 of the distance in<br/>and the fret for B flat 3/19 of the distance in.</p><p>Next course, place string for B a comfortable distance;<br/>Fret for c is 1/16 in from there<br/>fret for c# is 1/9 of distance from B<br/>fret for d is 1/9 of the distance from the fret for c</p><p>next course place string for d# a comfortable distance:<br/>fret for e is 1/16 of the distance from d#<br/>fret for f is 1/9 of the distance from d#<br/>fret for f#, well, the manuscript apparently says it is 1/16 of the &#x9;&#x9;<br/>&#x9;distance from e, which is clearly wrong, John Koster says it should &#x9;<br/>&#x9;be 1/10 of the distance from e. I am not sure what the builder did</p><p>And start over at g.</p><p>I tune it by setting a pure 5th from c up to g and a pure fifth from<br/>c down to f, then putting in octaves. There are 9 string pairs.</p><p>You will note that there are no fretting conflicts in major thirds<br/>but one fourth of the minor thirds are unplayable together. The only<br/>unplayable minor third that in practice causes a lot of trouble in<br/>music of the period is the one from g to b flat -- the other common<br/>ones are on different courses.</p><p>Judy<br/>--<br/><a href="http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html">http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html</a></p></div>
