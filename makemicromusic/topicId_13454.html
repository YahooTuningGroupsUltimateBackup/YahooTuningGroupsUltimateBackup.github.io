A generalization, of<br/>&gt; course, but for now, I don&apos;t feel as though I&apos;m at odds with anything<br/>&gt; or anyone...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The piece in question, &quot;Xenharmonic Variations on a Theme by Mozart&quot;<br/>&gt; (with alternate title &quot;foum&quot;), begins with a statement of the theme in<br/>&gt; 12-equal and proceeds to a variation in 13-equal, then 14-equal, and<br/>&gt; so on up to 19-equal. The attempted/emulated styles vary wildly and in<br/>&gt; accordance with the tuning (I like to think), but the very ordering of<br/>&gt; the tunings adds a certain whimsy to it. Perhaps?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The piece is downloadable here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/songInfo.cfm?bandID=145852&songID=1804551">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/songInfo.cfm?bandID=145852&songID=1804551</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but if you want a hard copy, zap me your address and I&apos;ll zap you a CD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Happy memorial day weekend,<br/>&gt; Jacob<br/>...</p><p>Stunning!</p><p>And the 19-EDO is a nicely harmonic (neo-classic)<br/>wrap-up to all those wacky intervening variations,<br/>a bookend to the 12-EDO start.</p><p>I really enjoyed this one - thanks!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.394 / Virus Database: 268.7.3/350 - Release Date: 28/5/06</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2006 1:32:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Monday 29 May 2006 7:29 am, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Definitely great news!
