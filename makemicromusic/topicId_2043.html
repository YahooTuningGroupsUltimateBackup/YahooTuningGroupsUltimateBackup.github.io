Namely innocence<br/>&gt; and the liberation and abandon that are part and parcel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bryan&apos;s playing is amazing. He plays everyday and the sound is<br/>&gt; alarmingly confident and completely lacking in anything resembling<br/>&gt; timidity--I had him leave a live playing message on my friend&apos;s<br/>&gt; answering machine, and he thought it was his friend Bret, a strange<br/>&gt; but accomplished guitar veteran. Bryan listens to very little music,<br/>&gt; and he has no fear or even recognition of doing it right or doing it<br/>&gt; wrong. I have all I can do to keep up! It&apos;s fresh in a way that can&apos;t<br/>&gt; last, how strange.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far, I&apos;ve kept my distance... I&apos;ll show him this or that, but only<br/>&gt; occasionally and only when we&apos;re not playing music--his music. He<br/>&gt; knows what he&apos;s doing and it shows! It may not always be what his pops<br/>&gt; would do if he had is druthers, but it&apos;s also almost always something<br/>&gt; his pops couldn&apos;t do if wanted to--if only he knew! Truth is, it would<br/>&gt; be a shame to &quot;teach&quot; him now because he&apos;s in the zone, but I do<br/>&gt; occasionally worry that he&apos;ll acquire a lot of bad (habits technique<br/>&gt; wise. Oh well, I&apos;m doing what I feel is right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re going to &apos;rehearse&apos;--i.e., get him on a big amp and see if he<br/>&gt; can handle the volume increase that comes with playing with a drummer,<br/>&gt; and see if he can get the hang of singing into a microphone--next<br/>&gt; week, and we hope to gig soon. It&apos;s wild. Kind of like those old SST<br/>&gt; guitar bands but a lot more nuts; more rhythmically spastic like<br/>&gt; Drumbo era Beefheart. None of those guitarists were ever as free and<br/>&gt; fresh as he is either, and only a few were ever any more interesting.<br/>&gt; (Okay, I&apos;m his dad, and maybe I can&apos;t be held accountable for that<br/>&gt; last statement, but we&apos;ll see! BTW, I play fretless bass and he&apos;s been<br/>&gt; playing my fretless Kramer since he broke a string on his guitar a<br/>&gt; couple of weeks ago, so I guess we&apos;ll be a microtonal punk band--see<br/>&gt; this post was on topic after all!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should be fun, and interesting too... we&apos;ll see. As it is, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; take care,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
