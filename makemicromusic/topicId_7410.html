Of course,<br/>the &quot;devil (or artistry) is in the details...&quot;  It becomes almost<br/>humorous when a great work of the literature is reduced to a first<br/>species counterpoint exercise.  I laughed out loud a couple of<br/>times... but, on the other hand, understanding the &quot;background&quot;<br/>really shows important things about the underlying structure of<br/>music, particularly tonal music... (although I agree that I probably<br/>is possible to extend this kind of reductive thinking into all kinds<br/>of music, microtonal as well..)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2004 6:06:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
