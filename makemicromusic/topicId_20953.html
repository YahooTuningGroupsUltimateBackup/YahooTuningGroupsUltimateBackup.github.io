It turns out<br/>they were release envelopes being non-existent in a given Soundfont,<br/>and Timidity not having a built in &apos;bad release de-clicking&apos; provision<br/>coded in. I have been discussing this issue with an ex-Timidity<br/>developer on the Timidity-talk list, maybe it will make it&apos;s way into<br/>code...</p><p>For now, I found an excellent sounding workaround...in the<br/>&apos;timidity.cfg&apos; file, you can add a &apos;rate=attack:decay:sus:rel&apos; option,<br/>where each env segment is an integer from 0-255, 255 being fastest,<br/>and 0 being slowest, in a non-linear scale. To just change the release<br/>time to prevent clicks, just do as in this example:</p><p>#ins-number   file         bank  prog   [options]<br/>23     MySoundfont.sf2   0       23      rate=:::160</p><p>I found by experiment that the release value of 160 removes all<br/>audible clicking artifacts satisfactorily to my ear. You can use an<br/>editor capable of automacros and append the rate option by default<br/>after each patch entry to save typing.</p><p>I have been enjoying tuning a ton of medieval MIDIs to Pythagorean<br/>(and sometimes SuperPythagorean, but I still prefer the pure<br/>5ths!--someday I may want to code an adaptive algorithm to get wide<br/>thirds close to 14/11 or 9/7 a la Margo Schulter&apos;s taste, but not a<br/>priority now) using Timidity, with some high-quality early music<br/>soundfonts, and also the really amazing &apos;Jeux&apos; organ soundfont with<br/>excellent results, some of which I may share here at a later time...</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p></div>
