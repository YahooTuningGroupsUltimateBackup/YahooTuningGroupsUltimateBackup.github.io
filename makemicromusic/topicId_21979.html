And yes, for guitarists, you do have to have an axe made/refretted, so there&apos;s some $$$ involved...keyboardists can have it easier with the right instrument, and of course horn players can learn new fingering/lip techniques. But, I&apos;m seeing, overall, that, unfortunately, people just don&apos;t seem that interested in doing something other than 12...and that&apos;s disappointing, especially given how bland most 12 tone music sounds these days. Especially with more advanced classical/jazz type folks, I had thought other tunings were a way into new fields of composition/improvising (which they are); but, for whatever reason, it ain&apos;t happening. Of course, it still can...and yes, cats like Jay I appreciate immensely, and there are indeed folks around the world who are looking into non 12 systems, and getting into new areas with their music...hope that continues on a bigger scale.</p><p>   And yes, Vai used some microtones...but, what I&apos;d love to see is a guy like him do a whole project in another tuning system; that&apos;s what&apos;s needed. Overall, it&apos;s the younger musicians that need to be reached, cause they are usually more open to new ideas, and have the time/energy to put into it. I&apos;ve played with the Colorado Symphony a lot over the years, and have got to hear a lot of newer works for Symph...sorry to say, not much happening, as so much &quot;new&quot; music doesn&apos;t really sound new...12 eq has been milked pretty well after 200 years, different tuning concepts would greatly enrich that field...not to mention jazz/rock/blues, just about any style. Onward, it ain&apos;t over yet...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/microstick">www.myspace.com/microstick</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Hotmail has tools for the New Busy.

His solution was to use a nonoctave scale (88-CET)<br/>and prominently use things like 1/1 9/7 3/2 triads to get the<br/>audience&apos;s attention.  On an unfortunately note, I realize just now<br/>that I don&apos;t have any of Gary&apos;s music in a digital format.  He sent<br/>me a tape, and though I did manage to archive many of my old<br/>cassettes digitally, it looks like his fell through the cracks.  :(</p><p>I think I&apos;ve already told the story of one composer friend of mine<br/>who carefully listened to the Blackwood etudes.  His assessment<br/>was that only one of the etudes achieved something significant<br/>that couldn&apos;t be expressed in 12.  I didn&apos;t agree with him, because<br/>subtlety IS important in music, but in the grand scheme of things<br/>I saw his point.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=22010 href="#22010">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2010 4:33:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil&gt;.&quot;12 eq has been milked pretty well after 200 years&quot;<br/>What I see now is people repeating more-or-less the same melodies and chord progressions, but with different phrasing, timbres (both instruments and effects), lyrics, and arrangements (instruments).</p><p>  Hence the new &quot;pop&quot; music is often either rhythm or lyrics based...the art of writing fresh melodic &quot;hooks&quot; in 12TET has become very hard as what any new musician does is usually more-or-less 70% the melody/chord-progression of an old one, 20% rearranged themes/motifs from other musicians, and 10% fresh ideas.<br/>  There are IMVHO &quot;fresh&quot; 12TET musicians, but they often keep that way due to clever use of things like phrasing and orchestration.  I find myself listening to &quot;underground&quot; electronica because at least the timbres and beat alterations are often brand-new and cutting-edge even if the tuning and melodies behind them wreak of &quot;been-done-before-&apos;ed-ness&quot;.</p><p>   I still keep thinking the way to get pop musicians into microtonal is to make a pedal that will retune any digital audio signal on-the-fly to micro-tonal...thus enabling guitarists and such to re-tune without buying new instruments or (quite often) learning new fingering.
