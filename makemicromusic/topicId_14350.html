The temperament is Peppermint 24, in<br/>which this piece was conceived.</p><p>By the way, doing some abc notation isn&apos;t the worst way to spend the<br/>second day here locally where the temperature has gone over 40 degrees<br/>Celsius (or 104 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p>In addition to demonstrating the flexibility of the Sagittal notation<br/>and microabc in showing microtonal nuances such as direct comma shifts<br/>(see measures 26-27 of score, or listen to the MIDI at around 0:39,<br/>which timidity++ for some reason places at around &quot;0:44&quot; on its time<br/>indicator), this piece raises an interesting point on the relation of<br/>text and music.</p><p>As Stephen Szpak and others were discussing this general question, I<br/>would like to make it especially relevant here by focusing on the<br/>topic of verbal and musical rhetoric in a microtonal setting. It is<br/>interesting that Nicola Vicentino, in his treatise of 1555 on _Ancient<br/>Music Adapted to Modern Practice_ which described a keyboard including<br/>a complete meantone cycle of 31 notes per octave (1/4-comma or 31-EDO<br/>temperament?), advocated the view that any dissonant interval might be<br/>useful in order to express the sentiments of a text.</p><p>While a fascination with interval qualities and expressive dissonances<br/>became an important aspect of conventional late 16th-early 17th<br/>century practice and theory, the microtonal side of Vicentino&apos;s music<br/>and theory may only now be getting full consideration. While<br/>Vicentino&apos;s context seems to be meantone temperament, some of his<br/>aesthetic principles might be applied to other tunings, such as the<br/>Peppermint temperament in which _O Europae_ was conceived.</p><p>To keep things topically focused, I will make it my policy to tie<br/>discussions on text/tuning issues to specific pieces, with a post<br/>about _O Europae_ to follow soon. First, however, I&apos;d like to give<br/>people who aren&apos;t yet familiar with this piece a chance to hear it<br/>and form your own impressions.</p><p>The mapping of Peppermint used for this Sagittal version follows this<br/>Scala tuning for an octave of C-C oriented around C on the upper<br/>manual of the 24-note Peppermint keyboard:</p><p>! pep24-key1.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint mapping with C on upper keyboard as 1/1<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 69.98955<br/> 128.66924<br/> 149.51152<br/> 208.19121<br/> 229.03349<br/> 287.71318<br/> 357.70273<br/> 416.38243<br/> 437.22470<br/> 495.90439<br/> 565.89395<br/> 624.57364<br/> 645.41591<br/> 704.09561<br/> 774.08516<br/> 832.76485<br/> 853.60713<br/> 912.28682<br/> 933.12909<br/> 991.80879<br/> 1061.79834<br/> 1120.47803<br/> 1141.32031<br/> 2/1</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2006 1:10:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Firstly, Jon and everyone, just a quick but sincere apology for my<br/>contributions to the off-topic threads of late.

(on-or-off list!)  David Bowen<br/>&gt; and I are discussing part-writing issues together, it might be useful<br/>&gt; to pick your brain for that as well.  :)</p><p>Please let me briefly comment that parallel fifths and fourths are routine<br/>in 13th-century technique, and also in many 14th-century progressions for<br/>three or more voices, although &quot;modern&quot; 14th-century theory discourages<br/>parallel fifths in simple two-voice writings (where they still occur now<br/>and then in various compositions). By the mid-15th century, avoiding<br/>parallel fifths is a fairly consistent rule, and at the same time thirds<br/>are becoming more stable. In short, parallel fifths are a medieval<br/>commonplace -- but here sometimes mixed with some less &quot;common&quot; things, as<br/>your next comment might reflect.</p><p>A quick and possibly relevant comment on the question of parallels, which<br/>you&apos;re welcome of course to share with David Bowen, is that 13th-14th<br/>century cadences very typically involve parallel fifths and/or fourths, in<br/>a context where, however, the impelling or directing two-voice resolutions<br/>involve progressing from an unstable to a stable interval by stepwise<br/>contrary motion (e.g. 3-1, 3-5, 6-8, 2-4, 7-5), or sometimes<br/>&quot;near-conjunct&quot; contrary motion with one voice moving by step and the<br/>other by a third (often 2-5). The main intonational variable is that a<br/>medieval or neomedieval interval aesthetic tends nicely to fit a tuning<br/>system like the historical Pythagorean, or the modern Peppermint, where<br/>fifths and fourths are just or fairly close to it, and thirds and sixths<br/>have rather complex ratios (81:64 and 32:27 in Pythagorean; close to 14:11<br/>and 13:11 in Peppermint).</p><p>&gt; If I had to make a criticism, the cadence at measure 30 felt strange<br/>&gt; after 2 listens;  if I can I will listen a few more times and see if<br/>&gt; it &quot;settles&quot; in my ear.</p><p>That&apos;s more than fair enough, and as I&apos;ll explain in an article I&apos;m about<br/>to post about words and music in _O Europae_, that passage was meant to be<br/>a bit &quot;unsettling,&quot; although for me the effect is moderated by my<br/>familiarity with the basic idioms at play. Not to duplicate that article,<br/>I might mention an intonational point not made there, which might help to<br/>explain a suspension idiom which can apply in more &quot;conventional&quot; (in my<br/>idiom, that is) passages as well.</p><p>One thing that George Secor helped get me into around late 2001 or early<br/>2002 is adapting a typical Renaissance idiom, the suspension, to a<br/>neomedieval kind of intonational environment like Peppermint, for example<br/>(which came later than year as a 24-note variation on the Wilson/Pepper<br/>temperament), or a 17-note equal or well-temperament such as his 17-WT.</p><p>In a typical Renaissance suspension idiom, we have a fourth above the<br/>lowest voice that resolves to the major third of a sonority at or near<br/>4:5:6, the simplest ratio in a 16th-century JI or meantone style dividing<br/>a fifth into two thirds (here I follow MIDI conventions with C5 for<br/>middle C):</p><p>... G5      A5<br/>F5      E5  F5<br/>... C5      F4</p><p>Here the suspended voice resolves from the fourth to the major third,<br/>followed by an ascending semitone motion as it moves from major third to<br/>octave with the lowest voice.</p><p>In a context like 17-WT or Peppermint, however, an ideal for a &quot;just&quot;<br/>division of a fifth into two thirds based on simple ratios is frequently<br/>6:7:9, with the small minor third placed below the large 9:7 major third.<br/>Thus we have this suspension figure, using conventional accidentals for<br/>the sake of simplicity:</p><p>... D5       Eb5<br/>C5      Bb4  Ab4<br/>... G4       Ab4</p><p>Here the fourth moves down a large whole-tone (at or near 8:7) to a 7:6<br/>_minor_ third as part of a 6:7:9 sonority that then resolves with the<br/>outer voices ascending by a small semitone (at or near 28:27), and the<br/>middle voice which held the suspension descending in contrary motion by a<br/>whole-tone. In a tuning system like George&apos;s 17-WT, this can be realized<br/>with regular steps in the nearer portion of the tuning circle, so the<br/>notation would be just as above (or its Sagittal equivalent using regular<br/>flats).</p><p>In Peppermint, it&apos;s a bit more complex, because the best septimal<br/>approximations involve mixing notes from two regular 12-note chains. In a<br/>notation oriented to C on the lower keyboard, or C on the upper keyboard<br/>(which is the goal of the cadence), we might have:</p><p>    G5        G/|\5                    ...   G\!/5     C5<br/>F5      D/|\5 C/|\5                    F\!/5       D5  C5<br/>... C5        C/|\5   or equivalently  ...   C\!/5     C5</p><p>Here &quot;/|\&quot; is the sign for the 58.680-cent step between corresponding<br/>notes on the two keyboards, the interval by which the outer voices ascend<br/>to complete the cadence.</p><p>Of course, the parallel fifths between the outer voices, routine in a<br/>13th-14th century setting, would be excluded in conventional Renaissance<br/>technique. Also, a suspended sonority like 6:8:9 is considerably milder in<br/>a medieval kind of context, where major seconds typically play a much<br/>freer role than in a 16th-century technique. It&apos;s curious that here either<br/>6:8:9 or the 6:7:9 that follows it can play the role of an &quot;imperfectly<br/>concordant&quot; sonority, relatively euphonious but unstable and leading<br/>eventually to a stable 3:2 fifth or full 2:3:4 sonority or the like.</p><p>Thus if you&apos;re not familiar with this basic neo-medieval suspension idiom,<br/>it could well sound &quot;strange&quot; itself -- although there are things going on<br/>_O Europae_ that could well make it sound stranger (see my post to follow<br/>in a few minutes).</p><p>Also, of course, I&apos;d be delighted to discuss these things in e-mail as<br/>well with you and/or David if it could add to the voice-leading dialogue.</p><p>&gt; Also, unless/until sagittal gains wider acceptance, it would be very<br/>&gt; useful to explain the accidentals at the beginning of the score.</p><p>That&apos;s a fair point, and the way I&apos;m handling it is to make available soon<br/>an archive including the source microabc score files plus some files with<br/>notes on the Sagittal notation. I must admit that some of the equivalences<br/>may invite a bit of orientation, for example</p><p>...  G\!/5    G5        ...  F|||)5    G5<br/>F\!/5      D5 C5        E|)5        D5 C5<br/>...  C\!/5    C5    or  ...  B|)4      C5</p><p>The former notation reflects the keyboard arrangement, showing that the<br/>initial F in the middle voice and then the C and G moving us to the 6:8:9<br/>suspension are played on the lower keyboard, and the other notes on the<br/>upper keyboard.</p><p>The latter is more &quot;analytical&quot; in a way, letting us know that the notes<br/>on the lower keyboard are, in effect, playing the role of alternative<br/>&quot;versions&quot; of E, B, and F# (F/||\) on the upper keyboard (here the<br/>&quot;standard&quot; one) raised by Peppermint&apos;s equivalent of a septimal or 64:63<br/>comma (George&apos;s &quot;comma of Archytas,&quot; an auspicious name).</p><p>As you can see, I have lots to explain &lt;grin&gt;.

One fascinating<br/>interaction is that between the composer&apos;s intentions or assumptions and<br/>those of a listener diligently encountering the piece from what could<br/>often be a rather different frame of reference.]</p><p>In the spring of 2004, a suggestion was offered on the MakeMicroMusic<br/>forum that people consider writing compositions to celebrate the<br/>expansion of the European Union to 25 member nations. Although the<br/>suggestion more specifically proposed that these compositions use<br/>25-tone equal temperament (25-tET or 25-EDO), I happened to compose<br/>the piece _O Europae_ in the Peppermint temperament.</p><p>This piece is available as a PDF score using Sagittal notation, and<br/>also a MIDI file:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In addition to illustrating some features of Sagittal notation (not<br/>used in my initial version, as I recall, but quite apt as I find now),<br/>the piece may show some interesting interactions between text and<br/>music. One term for this might be &quot;microtonal madrigalisms&quot;: figures<br/>where, as in the madrigal of the 16th and early 17th centuries,<br/>musical idioms serve rhetorically to express the ideas or emotions of<br/>the words.</p><p>The opening section mostly presents the kind of smooth texture often<br/>associated with early 15th-century fauxbourdon, with passages rich in<br/>parallel thirds and sixths (and fourths between the two upper voices)<br/>leading to cadences on stable fifths and octaves. There is a typical<br/>14th-15th century contrast between more inconclusive cadences on A,<br/>involving a semitonal descent from Bb (Sagittal B\!!/) in the lowest<br/>voice, and more definitive cadences on F, the resting note or final of<br/>the mode, with semitonal ascents in the upper voices (E-F, B-C).</p><p>At measures 16-18, however as we approach the conclusion of this<br/>section, there is a nuance in the setting of the words _querulae<br/>pacis_, &quot;of the complaint (or cooing) of peace,&quot; also an allusion to<br/>the famous essay _Querula pacis_ by the great Erasmus of Rotterdam in<br/>the early 16th century which makes a powerful argument against war<br/>(see O_Europae.pdf for the typeset notation, with C5 here showing<br/>middle C as per MIDI conventions):</p><p> 16            17            18<br/> | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 |<br/>   A5    G5      G\!/5         G5<br/>   E5    D5      D\!/5         D5<br/>   C5    B\!!/4  A4            G4<br/>   que   -       ru-           lae</p><p>While the major thirds and sixths in measure 16 have their usual<br/>Peppermint sizes of around 416 and 912 cents, in measure 17 these<br/>intervals are derived in altered form as the difference of a fourth or<br/>minor seventh less the interval (\!/) between the two 12-note<br/>keyboards of about 59 cents, or about 437 and 933 cents, the former<br/>close to 9:7 and the latter a just 12:7.

The rhythm of _illaqueante_ or<br/>&quot;entangling&quot; in the second half of measure 25 presents a pair of<br/>duplets, each equal to a 3/8-note in this prevailing 6/4 meter.<br/>The declamatory style might suggest something more around 1600 than<br/>1400, and as in a composer such as Monteverdi, can lead to a dramatic<br/>vertical sonority.</p><p>In a neomedieval style, the 7:9:11 is often followed by a sonority<br/>with a fourth and a fifth above the lowest note, actually somewhat<br/>concordant in its regular form of 6:8:9, leading in turn to some<br/>cadence. Here, however, we have A|)-D-E|), 0-475-704 cents or a<br/>near-16:21:24 with a narrow 16:21 type of fourth.</p><p>Melodically, the lowest voice arrives  at this sonority by a motion of<br/>A-A|) --  a direct  step of  a Peppermint comma, around 21 cents, in<br/>ascent, while the upper voice descends F-E|), a 59-cent step. Thus we<br/>have a progression between these outer voices from regular minor sixth<br/>to fifth by contrary motion, if one considers the comma a distinct step!<br/>Both the melodic and vertical rhetoric here might amplify the word<br/>_belli_, &quot;of war.&quot;</p><p>Resolving the tension of the near-16:21:24, the middle voice descends<br/>from the narrow fourth to a pure septimal minor third above the lowest<br/>voice (near-6:7:9), then momentarily to an embellishing major second<br/>(near 8:9:12), and then returns to the 7:6 third, followed by a<br/>typical resolution of the near-6:7:9 to a stable fifth (B\!!/4-F5).</p><p>As a transition bringing us to the final and more tranquil section, we<br/>have the entreaty _ducite nos_, that is, &quot;lead us&quot; out of the<br/>entangling thicket of war we have just aurally surveyed:</p><p> 31                             32<br/> |  1     2   3       4   5   6 | 1<br/>    F5        F5      G5          A5<br/>    D5        D5      D5          E5<br/>    B\!!/4    B\!!/4  B\!!/4      A4<br/>    du-       ci-     te          nos</p><p>This entreaty or exclamation leads us back to the more familiar and<br/>ebullient style of the final section or coda on the words _Ut<br/>praevaleat concordia_, &quot;so that concord may prevail.&quot;</p><p>It might be added, of course, that one does not need the stimulus or<br/>occasion of a dramatic text in order to use a neomedieval sonority<br/>like 7:9:11 or 16:21:24; however, the situation of wedding words and<br/>music can, as in the rhetorical program of a Vicentino or a Monteverdi,<br/>lead to some striking passages which might then be expressively<br/>emulated in instrumental music also.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2006 8:10:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo and all.</p><p>I would like to share some thoughts about microtonalismo, Peppermint scale and Margo&apos;s composition &grave;&grave;O Europae&apos;&apos;.</p><p>&gt; On Tue, 26 Jul 2006, c. m. bryan wrote:<br/>&gt; [...]<br/>&gt;&gt;Secondly, Margo, I really enjoyed &quot;O Europae,&quot; and the accidentals<br/>&gt;&gt;seem very appropriate because they&apos;re not too overwhelming.<br/>[...]</p><p>I should first to say that I really liked &grave;&grave;O Europae&apos;&apos; too.</p><p>I think that the way Margo uses of Peppermint scale is consistent in several ways.

I&apos;m<br/>delighted that you enjoyed the piece, and will try here to keep my<br/>reply reasonably brief to a very rich and stimulating set of comments,<br/>maybe in that way making the dialogue a bit more flexible and<br/>accessible, as you have nicely done.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I have mailed a composer which was a colleague of mine<br/>&gt; at the university, talking about microtonalism. He have heard the my<br/>&gt; studies and exercises I did with microabc, as well as the examples<br/>&gt; of Peppermint cadences by Margo. He enjoyed (found interesting) the<br/>&gt; Peppermint cadences.</p><p>Please let me add that your very creative MIDI realizations and<br/>instrumentations of those cadences I posted in an article here are<br/>very attractive, and I enjoy them a great deal. Thank you for sharing<br/>these things with other colleagues.</p><p>&gt; I do not know details of Peppermint, but I know that there are two<br/>&gt; 12-tone chains 7/6 apart, wide major thirds and small intervals which<br/>&gt; can be used to form appealing leading tones.</p><p>You have nicely summed up the septimal resources of Peppermint, and<br/>maybe I should just clarify that the two 12-note chains are placed about<br/>58.680 cents apart, with this interval plus the regular major second<br/>forming a pure 7/6 third, of which there are ten. In the following<br/>diagram, these 7/6 thirds are shown as diagonal lines, with the two<br/>chains shown as horizontal lines with note names in Sagittal notation:</p><p>  F/|\ - C/|\ -  G/|\ - D/|\ - A/|\ - E/|\ - B/|\ - F/|||\ - C/|||\ - G/|||\<br/>   /      /      /       /      /      /      /       /       /         /<br/>E\!!/ - B\!!/ -  F  -   C   -  G   -  D   -  A   -   E   -   B    -   F/|\</p><p>Thus the tuning does in effect include two 10-note chains a 7/6 apart,<br/>and the just tuning of these 7/6 thirds is one of the defining traits of<br/>the system. In trying further to clarify the tuning structure, I would<br/>emphasize that your remarks nicely sum up its musical qualities.</p><p>&gt; Sonorities like B|)4 : D5 : F|||)5 are the main contribution of<br/>&gt; Margo&apos;s piece(s). They are not simply stressed leading tones: they are<br/>&gt; &grave;&grave;new&apos;&apos; sonorities, with a characteristic effect not present in<br/>&gt; /musica ficta/ (or other genera). The septimal intervals assure a<br/>&gt; harmonic consistency, and, no less, yield very interesting sorts of<br/>&gt; beatings and difference tones, which are a characteristic feature of<br/>&gt; Peppermint.</p><p>Your remarks tie in with the important point that while it possible that<br/>&quot;stressed leading tones&quot; in a 14th-century style _might_ sometimes have<br/>been sung to produce septimal or near-septimal ratios, the deliberate<br/>use of these ratios seems a modern rather than medieval approach.</p><p>(Quoting Chris)</p><p>&gt;&gt;If I had to make a criticism, the cadence at measure 30 felt strange<br/>&gt;&gt;after 2 listens;  if I can I will listen a few more times and see if<br/>&gt;&gt;it &quot;settles&quot; in my ear.</p><p>&gt; I have also found that passage a bit strange too. But part of the<br/>&gt; issue is that we heard a MIDI file, with no phrasing or articulation,<br/>&gt; as Yahya pointed out. Depending on the timbres, you can hear the<br/>&gt; sonority A|) : C : E|) as a hard &grave;&grave;septimal&apos;&apos; dissonance solving into<br/>&gt; the consonant sonority B\!!/ : B\!!/ : F .</p><p>Two quick points here. The first is that a 7:6 third or 6:7:9 sonority<br/>can have different effects on different listeners, and we might want to<br/>explore this question more, maybe in part through more musical examples.<br/>Certainly the resolution, as you note, is a central part of the style.</p><p>The second point is that indeed phrasing and articulation might make a<br/>difference, so I&apos;ll try a keyboard rendition and post it here.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I feel the fifths somewhat unstable in Peppermint. Would<br/>&gt; they be too large? It seems that they are only 2 cents wider than 3/2?<br/>&gt; I have experienced a bit of aural fatigue after listen to Peppermint<br/>&gt; pieces, and suspected of the fifths, comparing with the JI versions.<br/>&gt; However, that fatigue can be actually a result of the beatings and<br/>&gt; difference tones of the tempered septimal intervals.</p><p>The fifths are indeed about 704 cents, or 2 cents wider than 3/2 --<br/>impure by about the same amount as in 12-EDO, but in the opposite<br/>direction. Another possible explanation for your aural fatigue: could it<br/>be the regular Peppermint thirds at around 416 and 288 cents, which like<br/>Pythagorean thirds are rather complex and active?  Comparing different<br/>kinds of styles and textures might help in exploring this question.</p><p>[In response to Yahya&apos;s experiment of importing &quot;O Europae&quot; into a<br/>composition program and adding phrasing and new registration, etc.]</p><p>&gt; It is a shame to lost the tuning information, but I have a comment on<br/>&gt; the original timbres: they are heterogeneous, and some of the tuning<br/>&gt; characteristics would be more apparent when using more homogeneous<br/>&gt; timbres.</p><p>This is an interesting point, and I&apos;m considering some synthesizer<br/>versions of pieces including this one with more homogenous textures.</p><p>&gt; Maybe a good interpretation could use three human voices (homogeneous<br/>&gt; part) supported by three contrasting instrumental timbres. I would<br/>&gt; like to hear real interpretations of that piece or other Margo&apos;s<br/>&gt; pieces. By the way, I noticed that the piece in<br/>&gt; &grave;&grave;ForShaahin_Shur001.ogg&apos;&apos; is a lively human interpretation.</p><p>Yes, this is a very important point. While programs like microabc,<br/>abc2midi, Scala, and timidity++ support the very valuable feature of<br/>MIDI files playable in alternative tunings, your remarks and Yahya&apos;s<br/>remind me that this is not a substitute for my actually playing on<br/>keyboard, or some performance by an ensemble. This is why I should try<br/>to record actual keyboard versions of the pieces to go with the microabc<br/>scores and MIDI versions. Also, of course, as Yahya is doing, one might<br/>use certain computer and MIDI tools to produce a more &quot;customized&quot; and<br/>refined version.</p><p>Again, thank you for a most gracious and valuable post!</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2006 7:01:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Hudson Lacerda<br/>&lt;hfmlacerda@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yahya_melb escreveu:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d appreciate the tuning of the scale notes you used, either as<br/>ratios or in cents.

It also exactly matches the specification of the &gt; pitch bend message for the Roland E-28 keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt; The retuning range is -8192 to +8191; the value -8192 corresponds &gt; to -(Pitch bend sensitivity); and (Pitch bend sensitivity) defaults &gt; to 2 semitones = 200 cents = a whole tone. Then your keyboard reduces the default suggested MIDI range of +/-2 semitones in order to obtain a more precise tuning.</p><p>Thanks for the info.<br/>Hudson</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Novidade no Yahoo!

If you would be so kind as to correct those errors,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have a shot at incorporating them in my NWC score.</p><p>Dear Yahya,</p><p>Please let me thank you and hasten to let you know that actually I<br/>made an error on the value in cents for the note you list as &quot;Bq&quot;,<br/>and also in the pitchbend units for the note you list as &quot;E#,&quot; as well<br/>as a Sagittal confusion you correctly queried of &quot;E\|/&quot; for the<br/>intended &quot;E\!/&quot; sign, which you helpfully supplied. Also, as you<br/>noted, the cents value I gave for &quot;Bq&quot; is wrong, and corrected in my<br/>new version below. Further, I made a small error in the cents value<br/>for regular B, fixed below -- 1120.488c for the correct 1120.478c.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I first simply offer a corrected version using your names<br/>for the most part:</p><p>Cn 0000.000c +0000u where 1c=4096u<br/>C# 0149.512c +2028u given as D -2068u D\!/<br/>Dn 0208.191c +0336u<br/>D# 0357.703c +2364u given as E -1732u E\!/<br/>En 0416.382c +0671u<br/>E# 0437.225c +1525u given as F\!/<br/>Fn 0495.904c -0168u<br/>F# 0645.416c +1860u given as G -2236u G\!/<br/>Gn 0704.096c +0168u<br/>G# 0853.607c +2196u given as A -1900u A\!/<br/>An 0912.287c +0503u<br/>Aq 0933.139c +1357u given as A|)<br/>Bb 0991.809c -0336u given as A+3760u B\!!/<br/>Bn 1120.478c +0839u<br/>Bq 1141.320  +1692u given as B|)</p><p>Of course, as long as the pitchbends are correct, we could name these<br/>notes in various ways. For example, if we want to have pitches a<br/>regular fifth or fourth apart have similar notations, the following is<br/>one possibility using your &quot;q&quot; sign for a note higher by a Peppermint<br/>comma (about 20.842 cents or 853u -- sometimes rounded to 854u) than a<br/>regular natural or sharp:</p><p>Cn  0000.000c +0000u where 1c=4096u<br/>C#q 0149.512c +2028u given as D -2068u D\!/<br/>Dn  0208.191c +0336u<br/>D#q 0357.703c +2364u given as E -1732u E\!/<br/>En  0416.382c +0671u<br/>Eq  0437.225c +1525u given as F\!/<br/>Fn  0495.904c -0168u<br/>F#q 0645.416c +1860u given as G -2236u G\!/<br/>Gn  0704.096c +0168u<br/>G#q 0853.607c +2196u given as A -1900u A\!/<br/>An  0912.287c +0503u<br/>Aq  0933.139c +1357u given as A|)<br/>Bb  0991.809c -0336u given as A+3760u B\!!/<br/>Bn  1120.478c +0839u<br/>Bq  1141.320c +1692u given as B|)</p><p>Thus the value of q itself -- or Sagittal |) -- is about 20.842c or 853u,<br/>sometimes rounded up to 854u. The value of #q is about 149.512c, which<br/>together with a /|\ of about 58.680c makes up a regular Peppermint tone<br/>of about 208.191c.</p><p>One lesson of this exercise is that lots of proofreading can help,<br/>including yours, which caught a number of my errors in adding notes to<br/>microabc MIDI output (itself accurate!).</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
