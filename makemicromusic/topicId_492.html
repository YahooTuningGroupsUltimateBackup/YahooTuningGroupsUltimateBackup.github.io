We<br/>played for about 40 minutes total in a loosely structured<br/>improvisation.  The piece, &quot;Portal&quot;, was structured/composed by Dixie<br/>Treichel and evokes the elements-- not the periodic table, but you<br/>know, earth water fire air...  This excerpt is part of the &quot;Earth&quot;<br/>section.  I think it sounds very &quot;earthy&quot;.  (Why are so many<br/>microtonalists fascinated by the elements?)  I&apos;m rather fond of this<br/>excerpt in which I&apos;m playing some simple patterns on my JI guitar<br/>through a digital delay pedal.</p><p>Many thanks to list-mom for pointing me to some useful freeware for<br/>the ripping/editing/encoding!</p><p>kp</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

Very fun listen - I enjoyed the &apos;throbbing&apos; nature of the delay on the low tones.</p><p>&gt;Many thanks to list-mom for pointing me to some useful freeware for the &gt;ripping/editing/encoding!</p><p>Life is for helping.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
