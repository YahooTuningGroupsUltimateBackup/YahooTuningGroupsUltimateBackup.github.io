Also listening to live concerts, - did a lot of that when<br/>&gt; &gt; I was at univ. and enjoying hearing the pieces by young composers<br/>&gt; in a very active<br/>&gt; &gt; music dept.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this is part of the &quot;work&quot; i was talking about -- listening and<br/>&gt; immersion.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, sure, work sometimes is fun if you like what you are doing :-).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another thing is that I used to improvise for hours on end at the<br/>&gt; piano<br/>&gt; &gt; and I think that helped.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that is, of course, another major part of the &quot;work&quot; i was talking<br/>&gt; about.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also just letting oneself sing / whistle when one feels like it -<br/>&gt; if one<br/>&gt; &gt; is inhibited there I think it might make it harder. While if it is<br/>&gt; just<br/>&gt; &gt; fun and one enjoys it, maybe that shows up in the tunes?? Loosening<br/>&gt; up<br/>&gt; &gt; exercises of some type to release ones melodic inhibitions?? No<br/>&gt; suggestions<br/>&gt; &gt; there as I haven&apos;t needed them. May help that I&apos;m an amateur and<br/>&gt; don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; feel that I need to be good at it at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; excellent. yes, getting past the inhibitions can be major &quot;work&quot; for<br/>&gt; many musicians.</p><p>Yes, I think that is it. Surely everyone probably has<br/>some kind of &quot;music in their heart&quot; in Jon&apos;s phrase, and<br/>maybe some don&apos;t feel inspired to express it in music, but<br/>anyone who composes presumably does - so then it is<br/>probably mostly a matter of finding a way to let<br/>it express itself.</p><p>Then at least the composing will be satisfying and fun.<br/>Seems that some do have a kind of a gift and become the<br/>composers that everyone wants to listen to, and if ones<br/>aim is to become such, well maybe it can&apos;t be done by<br/>work, just may happen as it were as a biproduct of<br/>ones work (certainly wn&apos;t happen if one does nothing).</p><p>But, may as well enjoy composing mightn&apos;t one<br/>and it is likely that the result will be better if<br/>one does.</p><p>Also, once you come up with a melody, one may then<br/>want to change it, why not! Just because it may be easy<br/>to make up a tune doesn&apos;t mean that once you&apos;ve got it on<br/>paper you have to keep with the first thing you<br/>thought of (though sometimes that may indeed turn out to<br/>be the best one after the crossing out and work<br/>when one comes back to it later).</p><p>So that is more work, but it also can be a lot of fun<br/>too, and probably helps with making new melodies<br/>in a more fluent immediate fashion later.</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, a couple of years ago I did a thing where every day i&apos;d<br/>&gt; just whistle a<br/>&gt; &gt; tune and write it down - one a day at least, which was fun to do and<br/>&gt; &gt; may do it again. There, the thig is to just make up anything,<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; matter if it is good or bad, and write it down, I think will help<br/>&gt; &gt; to make the proces of inventing tunes more effortless,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;m glad you agree that this kind of work can get you closer to that<br/>&gt; transcendent/magic state of being an excellent, melodically creative<br/>&gt; musician.</p><p>Well, helps one make melodies. Don&apos;t know if that is the highest<br/>level of the art though. Seems to me that Beethoven sometimes did<br/>a great deal with apparently very little in the way of<br/>melodic material.</p><p>Other composers tend to use found melodies as the<br/>starting point - think of Bartok for instance and his folk<br/>songs, bird songs, etc...</p><p>I&apos;m sure one can do the same thing microtonally, so that<br/>could be a way of dealing with the situation if one is<br/>genuinely not very satisfied with any of the melodies one<br/>makes oneself.</p><p>Bartok or Beethoven were melodically gifted, everyone agrees,<br/>don&apos;t get me wrong, but their styles could be of inspiration to those<br/>who find that they make rather few in the way of singable<br/>melodies). Like, sounds as though you need a smaller percentage of new<br/>singable melodies per minute of composing as it were,<br/>and some pieces may be almost entirely without any<br/>singable melodies of any length, or they may all<br/>be derived from folk songs etc - but in a way<br/>that only that composer could possibly have done it,<br/>with his individual unique and expressive style.</p><p>While a composer like say Schubert has far more singable<br/>melodies per minute as it were - all new ones too.<br/>Such a style of composing may provide a model or something to aim for for those<br/>who find the process of making up melodies more effortless.</p><p>Someone might may make just one really nice melody in ones lifetime,<br/>but maybe that will be the one that really strikes home<br/>and expresses something of great value.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; though I<br/>&gt; &gt; did it rather to try to make it easier to write out the tunes<br/>&gt; &gt; that I whistle, which originally was rather a slow process - the<br/>&gt; &gt; technical thing of figuring out what all the notes were to write<br/>&gt; &gt;down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; believe it or not, even this kind of &quot;work&quot; is very, very helpful --<br/>&gt; even though the final result, of effortless creation, doesn&apos;t bear<br/>&gt; any resemblence to this process or even remind you, in any way, that<br/>&gt; you went through it.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m sure.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sharing music I&apos;m sure is a help too - listening to<br/>&gt; &gt; work by other composers and the feeling of being in a community<br/>&gt; &gt; of people composing using the same general materials.<br/>&gt; &gt; Gradually we may learn together more about the melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; potential of all these new tunings we are exploring just<br/>&gt; &gt; by trying it out, and when someone makes up a nice tune,<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe something in the way it happens will inspire others<br/>&gt; &gt; to make new tunes of their own in related tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; music springing from interpersonal cultural exchange always seems<br/>&gt; richer than music springing from a vacuum, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>Yes indeed! I think that is the most important of all!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
