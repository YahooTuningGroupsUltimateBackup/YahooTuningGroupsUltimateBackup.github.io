I thought it was probably theoretically<br/>perfect (up to the limit of normal computer floating poitn<br/>work) and Michael Kurtz said that indeed it probably is<br/>within the limits of human hearing anyway - programmed<br/>to a little better than 24 bit precision.</p><p>Another bit of news, another Native Instruments soft synth will<br/>receive the full range of midi tunign standard sysexes when<br/>it is released like the FM7, the Pro-53<br/><a href="http://www.harmony-central.com/Newp/2002/Pro-53.html">http://www.harmony-central.com/Newp/2002/Pro-53.html</a></p><p>Maybe this is the start of a new trend?</p><p>Another thing, Michael Kurtz tells me that<br/>Sysexes work with VST plug ins in Cubase 5.1<br/>but not in CubaseSX, and Native Instruments will be<br/>pushing Steinberg to do somethign about it - would<br/>probably do no harm to contact them too if you use<br/>CubaseSX with VST plug ins and want them to<br/>have microtuning capabilities.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been testing the speed of midi relaying<br/>and was surprised to find that Midi Yoke Junction<br/>outperforms a hardware loopback - connecting the<br/>midi out of my soundcard round to the midi in and<br/>then to the midi in of another program.<br/>It&apos;s ten to fifty times faster. Midi Yoke can<br/>send a bulk tuning dump round the loopback<br/>in on average a third of a millisecond on my machine,<br/>(which means that most of them go all the way round<br/>the loop in a single Windows tick as the multimedia<br/>timer only has a resolution of one tick per millisecond).<br/>When it goes via the hardware loopback it takes on average<br/>180 milliseconds.</p><p>For note on /off pairs the difference isn&apos;t quite so dramatic<br/>but Midi Yoke takes about the same time to relay a note on /off<br/>pair as a bulk tuning dump - just a little faster.</p><p>Hubi&apos;s loopback is between the two, and about as fast as<br/>Midi Yoke but has a cut off at 64 notes for a fast cluster<br/>of note ons - discards the rest.</p><p>I also found in the case of the physical loopback, some of the bulk<br/>tuning dumps got lost if you sent a them at great speed one<br/>after another through the physical cable - of 20 bulk dumps<br/>sent in a single batch, 4 didn&apos;t make it round the loop<br/>- on my machine anyway.</p><p>Next upload of FTS will have an option to test the speed<br/>of your loopback, and that&apos;s what I used.</p><p>Here are the details:</p><p>Midi Yoke: (10000 events)</p><p>Note on /off pair: 0.27 milliseconds<br/>SNR Sysex: 0.3 milliseconds<br/>Bulk tuning dump: 0.38 milliseconds</p><p>Max delays for note on / SNR sysex pairs:<br/>SNR sysex 8 milliseconds. Note on: 6 milliseconds.</p><p>(note that the 8 millisecond delay here is very rare<br/>- in a 1000 events test I got a max delay of 3 milliseconds)</p><p>Physical cable: (1000 events, 20 for the bulk tuning dump)</p><p>Note on /off pair: 1.916 milliseconds<br/>SNR Sysex: 2.81485 milliseconds<br/> - 44 out of 1000 didn&apos;t make it round the loop<br/>Bulk tuning dump: 181.375 milliseconds<br/> - 4 out of 20 didn&apos;t make it round the loop</p><p>Max delays for note on / SNR sysex pairs -  100 of each:<br/>SNR sysex 8 milliseconds. Note on: 6 milliseconds.</p><p>Hubi&apos;s loopback: (100 events, 20 for the bulk tuning dump, )</p><p>Note on /off pair: 0.21875 milliseconds<br/> - first 64 out of 100 make it round the loop<br/>SNR Sysex: 0.32 milliseconds<br/>Bulk tuning dump: 3.55 milliseconds</p><p>Max delays for note on / SNR sysex pairs:<br/>SNR sysex 3 milliseconds. Note on: 1 millisecond.<br/> - again, first 64 out of the 1000 made it round the loop</p><p>For the pitch measurements:</p><p>440 (desired) -&gt; 439.9214 (wave counting), 440.0848 (FFT)</p><p>550 (desired) -&gt; 549.9039 (wave counting), 549.7696 (FFT)</p><p>The wave counting method is more accurate, so it makes<br/>sense to use those.</p><p>Using those measurements, the ratio is<br/> 386.3205 cents<br/>- should be<br/>386.3137 cents<br/>so relative pitch error is less than a hundredth of a cent.</p><p>Absolute pitch is 0.309289 cents flat relative to A = 440,<br/>but absolute pitch is harder to measure and especially to<br/>check for any systematic errors so I&apos;m not sure about that<br/>and as far as the measurements are concerned, and would<br/>probably need to do more tests to find out what is happening.<br/>It could well be perfect too (assuming they target A = 440<br/>that is)</p><p>Will be releasing FTS 1.09 with the next upload, prob.<br/>later today. Will still continue to update it once<br/>released and particularly there are sure to be<br/>some gaps in the help, and I&apos;m hoping that<br/>I can get a few reviews from the download sites<br/>as I did last time, and the reviewers comments<br/>may be helpful, and could be good to have while<br/>I&apos;m finishing the help.</p><p>Then I&apos;ll be working on the Virtual flowers program for<br/>a while, of course not abandoning FTS or anything,<br/>but maybe work on it somewhat less for a while, also<br/>spend some time enjoying using it and maybe have<br/>a bit of a composing break as I did last year<br/>I think about this time.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
