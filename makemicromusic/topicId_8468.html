I have a new job, new customers, and lots<br/>of new flying time to different cities around the west, so I haven&apos;t<br/>had time to create a podcast in a month or more. I have tons of<br/>material from recent posts here, but no time to put one together.</p><p>Is anyone interested in carrying on the mantle of podcasting? I can<br/>give you a login to the Podcast1024 site at <a href="http://blogger.com">blogger.com</a>, and show you<br/>how to record the 30-60 second intro&apos;s, and give tips for audio<br/>recording software. Any takers? I just haven&apos;t had the time, and I<br/>keep getting requests for new podcasts.</p><p>I have about 150 subscribers to the RSS feed. Every one of them will<br/>have your creations downloaded to their MP3 players or iPods if we can<br/>just get someone to create the material.</p><p>Let me know if you are interested in contributing a piece in MP3<br/>format, 64 kbit/sec stereo with ID3 tags, a short description, and a<br/>blog post.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Podcasting from <a href="http://podcast1024.blogspot.com">http://podcast1024.blogspot.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=9337 href="#9337">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
