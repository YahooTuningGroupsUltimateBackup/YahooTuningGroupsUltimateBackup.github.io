For all of us who are trying to release<br/>microtonal or otherwise music digitally.</p><p>I&apos;m changing my mind about replaygain (.org).  Are you<br/>forever fussing with your volume knob?  Replaygain is a<br/>group of standards (vorbisgain, mp3gain, wavegain) that<br/>attempt to get all files to play back at a certain<br/>perceived loudness, so you can &apos;set and forget&apos; your<br/>volume knob.</p><p>We can&apos;t just normalize all files, because that sets the<br/>peak amplitude, not the average loudness.  But we *must*<br/>respect the peak amplitude no matter what.  Actually, when<br/>faced with clipping, replaygain either allows you to apply<br/>less than the recommended gain or do &quot;hard limiting&quot; to<br/>prevent clipping.  In the former case, you get the same<br/>result as if you would have normalized.  In the latter<br/>case, you&apos;re applying compression to your music (yuck!).</p><p>The nice thing about replaygain is that it doesn&apos;t have<br/>you normalizing your masters, which results in rounding<br/>errors affecting their fidelity.  Instead, it just tells<br/>the playback client (say, winamp) how much gain to apply.<br/>So you still get rounding errors, but they don&apos;t pile up.<br/>In other words, as I argued a few weeks ago, one should<br/>apply any gain at the last possible moment, so it only<br/>happens once.</p><p>But it seems to be that the last possible moment is at the<br/>knob itself!  Let the person compress it at the knob if<br/>they want (say, for in the car).  And re-writing a volume<br/>control is a heckuva lot easier than having everyone in<br/>the World analyzing their wav files!</p><p>So why should I give up any dynamic range?  I&apos;ll just<br/>record to 24-bit, normalize, dither down to 16 bit and<br/>ship.  To hell with Texas.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

But I also wanted to share the following, which came up on two other lists:</p><p>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br/>Date: Thu, 31 Jul 2003 09:19:20 +0200<br/>From: mzmk<br/>To: microsound &lt;microsound@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [microsound] Digital distortion white paper</p><p>30 years since people started using digital recording and they are<br/>still discovering fun new problems ...</p><p><a href="http://www.tllabs.com/files/Digital%20distortion%20white%20paper.pdf">http://www.tllabs.com/files/Digital%20distortion%20white%20paper.pdf</a></p><p>One thing I *will* say is that compression, which you mention a bit, is a tool like any other - it can be abused. That said, I still think there are musics that not only benefit from compression, but are truly enhanced by a *musical* application of it. But that speaks to specific pieces or groups of pieces, and the replaygain scenario sounds like it can be applied across the board. All we have to remember is that everything isn&apos;t the same, even music - if we treat it all the same we might lose something as well as gain something.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2003 2:11:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon wrote...</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.tllabs.com/files/Digital%20distortion%20white%20paper.pdf">www.tllabs.com/files/Digital%20distortion%20white%20paper.pdf</a></p><p>Interesting.</p><p>&gt;One thing I *will* say is that compression, which you mention<br/>&gt;a bit, is a tool like any other - it can be abused.

Most traditional &apos;classical&apos; music is in no way made for listening in a noisy environment like (most) cars. When I take driving trips I don&apos;t ever pop in that kind of stuff, even if I have it along on the trip. Rather listen to the Jayhawks any day, on the road...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
