Here is the program note:</p><p>Inner Voices II was written specifically for Peter Jarvis and April<br/>McCloskey of the DoubleStop Percussion Duo who requested the work and<br/>who are premiering it tonight.  It was written in August, 2005 and is<br/>based upon an electronic piece, Inner Voices which was completed<br/>earlier that month.  Inner Voices was my first electronic piece to be<br/>created entirely with software synthesizers, specifically the z3ta+<br/>softsynth with Sonar as the sequencer host.  One of the wonderful<br/>features of this new synthesizer is that it reads Scala files.  Scala<br/>is a tuning program that makes it possible to create any conceivable<br/>scale.  In this piece, I am using a scale of 21 notes per octave,<br/>appropriately named Blackjack, which very closely emulates just<br/>intonation, or non-beating sonorities.  This scale was created<br/>especially for me by musician-mathematicians Paul Erlich and Dave<br/>Keenan according to my particular requests.  The original electronic<br/>piece includes percussion.  However, Inner Voices II has the live<br/>players perform these parts, while they are also at liberty<br/>to &quot;interpret&quot; the electronic piece to some degree adding their own<br/>creative insights to it.   Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
