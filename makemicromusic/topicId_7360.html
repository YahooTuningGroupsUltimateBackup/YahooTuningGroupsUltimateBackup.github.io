I did as you hoped, which was to contrast it with the original, and I only did that after listening to the variation.</p><p>While I don&apos;t find it as compelling as the original, I don&apos;t put it in the category of a true &apos;failed experiment&apos; (nor do I think it is mere noise). And I don&apos;t necessarily think you overdid the filtering, but my first thought is that you could do a remix of the original where a couple of breaks could actually segue to the filtered version. It certainly has a gauzy texture to it, which might be a nice foil juxtaposed with some of the original (or not...) which has a lot of crunch.</p><p>I always liked &quot;L. A.&quot;, and the basic groove reminds me of one of my favorite Cirque du Soleil pockets. When going between the two pieces, I had in mind some of the mixing techniques from one of my current favorite electonica composers, but comparisons aren&apos;t really a swell thing unless one specifically requests as much.</p><p>I&apos;d say do three more variations and treat them all (including the original) as tracks, and then mix them live!</p><p>Or not. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7404 href="#7404">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2004 8:23:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Sethares&quot;</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_7360.html#7360">/makemicromusic/topicId_7360.html#7360</a></p><p>&lt;sethares@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve just uploaded a new piece called &quot;local variation&quot; to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/local_variation.mp3">http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/local_variation.mp3</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>***I like this, although it sounds like a lot of other sequenced<br/>things I have heard over the years.
