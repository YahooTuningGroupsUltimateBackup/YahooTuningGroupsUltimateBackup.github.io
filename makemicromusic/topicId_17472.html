I&apos;m sorry to post &quot;seeking microtonal musician&quot; ad rather<br/>than post something with actual information but even as a music<br/>student I find it hard to find anyone with the vision to make new and<br/>exciting music.

I compose<br/>and play guitar (in the process of filing off the frets of my old<br/>guitar to mark in 17TET scale). I have scala.

What now?<br/>&gt; ~David   &gt;   Most people who end up doing anything worthwhile are autodidacts about it.</p><p>1) Study great music, study theory, listen a lot to great stuff<br/>2) try a concept or idea in a piece or sketch<br/>3) if it sucks, say &quot;oh well, maybe next time&quot;, then goto 1<br/>4) else, pat self on back, saying &quot;good job, self&quot;, then goto 1</p><p>how else would it be done, really? anyone holding your and through the process doesn&apos;t make it any safer or easier to master.<br/>just do it, or don&apos;t. (apologies to Nike sneakers) over time, hopefully &apos;4&apos; will happen more than &apos;3&apos;, but &apos;4&apos; doesn&apos;t happen without a shitload of &apos;3&apos;. So start writing.</p><p>Anyway, you&apos;ll find a decent forum (most of the time, when it&apos;s not mired in tangential discussions or petty personal disputes) in here to share your work or ideas.
