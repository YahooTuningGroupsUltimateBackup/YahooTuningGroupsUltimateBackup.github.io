Personal Remarks:
=================

The 2nd Symphony was composed in September 1976,
when I was 14 & 1/2 years old.  I was living in
Philadelphia and had just started 10th grade at
Lamberton School.

My models were obviously Haydn and Mozart, with
a few perverse melodic and harmonic twists of
my own... I was also a big fan of Prokofiev's
"Classical Symphony", which is much in the same vein.

I wrote down most of the material that was in my
head, but did leave some big holes where I could
"hear" the music in my mind but never bothered
(or felt like figuring out how) to write it down.

In New York in June 1980, a few weeks after finishing
my first year at Manhattan School of Music, I sat at
the piano and filled in the holes in the "B" section
of the 3rd movement.  I was interested in completing
the score at that time, since it had lain fallow for
four years, but got diverted by other projects and
left it at that point.

At some point around 1988 I entered the notes from
my score into a MIDI-file, and tinkered with it
from time to time over the next 5 or so years.

In December 1994, shortly after my second wedding
anniversary, I was working on the MIDI-file and decided
to complete the piece once and for all.  I was amazed
at how well I could remember what I heard in my head
18 years before as I entered notes directly into
the staff on my computer.  I was also inspired to
add a few new touches, the best of which are the
surprise slow bit at the very end of the 1st movement,
and the Coda of the 2nd movement, which I think is
one of the most poetic things I've ever written.

I still felt that the final Coda of the 3rd movment
needed something more, and finally, in October 2000,
I was inspired to add some counterpoint to what
was already there, and was more than pleased with
the result.

All this music had been done in the standard 12-EDO tuning.
In May 2001 I sent the MIDI-file to John deLaubenfels
<http://www.adaptune.com>, and asked him to retune it
in 5-limit and 7-limit adaptive JI, with stiff vertical
springs (meaning that melodic "evening out" would be
sacrificed in order to achieve JI vertical sonorities).
I really liked the 7-limit version, and made the mp3
which is available for listening at
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/monz/SYM2cr7.mp3>.

The symphony is very terse, the entire Exposition
of the 1st movement being wrapped up in 24 seconds,
and the "A" section of the 3rd movement about the
same.

Because of this brevity, I made more than the usual
repeats, as can be seen in the above formal analysis.
Upon listening today, I'd probably delete several
of those in the 2nd movement.
