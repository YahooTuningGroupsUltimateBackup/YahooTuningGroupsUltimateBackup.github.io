(I have 3 TX802s and 3<br/>cartridges, but one of the boxes has a broken cartridge bay, so one<br/>cartridge is idle.) I have *NEVER* found a cartridge for sale, and have<br/>never seen a TX802 for sale with a cartridge. I got all of mine when they<br/>were new circa 1988/89.</p><p>If you have a TX802 and don&apos;t have a cartridge, the next-best-thing is to<br/>get a patch/library program like MidiQuest. It will run on even older<br/>computers, can load/store tunings as well as patches, so at least you can<br/>use Scala to set tunings, then store your tunings on the computer.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=5131 href="#5131">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

The one thing *that* won&apos;t do is be able to select different tunings by sending midi commands, allowing one to sequence music that changed different tunings. But since we live today, there are other options, like rendering tracks to audio and mixing. There are always ways to get things done, it just seems like there isn&apos;t (yet) the ultimate way!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=29192 href="#29192">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2013 6:09:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Does anyone use Yamaha TX802s any more?</p><p>Just curious.

I&apos;ve been making microtonal music with it since 1990. As electronic repairs are my hobby, recently I have recapped PSU in my unit so it will work reliably for next 20 years. I do this with all my equipment older than 20 years...</p><p>I can be interested in yours, but I&apos;m in Japan, and shipping could be expensive, so probably I&apos;m out of the game... Just from curiosity - how much will you ask for them?</p><p>Best regards!</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 17 Jun, 2013, at 10:09 AM, Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Does anyone use Yamaha TX802s any more?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just curious.
