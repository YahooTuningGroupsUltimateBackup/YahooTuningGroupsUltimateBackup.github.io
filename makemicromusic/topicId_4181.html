I&apos;ve been working my way through &quot;sand&quot;, and just got the last two installments downloaded this afternoon. Make up an mp3 playlist and now I&apos;ve got the whole piece running!</p><p>(Would you consider making either a .zip or .pdf file of your dissert available? I didn&apos;t want to spend all the time online reading it, so I used a snag tool to download all the pages and graphics to read offline - quite intriguing so far...)</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;The timbres I used are rich in their own quirky ways, or when they&apos;re not, &gt;it&apos;s because I wanted them to be crude at that particular point.</p><p>There is a lot of personality to the sounds of the piece.</p><p>&gt;Which maybe is a larger point : It&apos;s possible to write decent sounding &gt;music for MIDI or other computer-music instruments --- but you have to &gt;compose your music for the  MIDI instruments.   Too often, people write &gt;for &quot;string quartet&quot;, and then  listen to a &quot;MIDI realization&quot; and feel &gt;that&apos;s it&apos;s not the &quot;real thing.&quot;  Well, it&apos;s not.</p><p>Damn. Haven&apos;t I been saying that for a long time?</p><p>One thing we must take into consideration is that not every member reading this would consider themselves a composer, with or without a capital &quot;C&quot;. So in a small way one could semi-overlook a less-stringent work ethic when it came to the &apos;orchestration&apos;.</p><p>However...</p><p>If one ventures beyond microtonal &quot;examples&quot; or &quot;experiments&quot; or &quot;progressions&quot; or &quot;doodlings&quot;, etc., and wants the music being made to be taken on a level of listening that *any* music of care and quality is taken, one simply can&apos;t ignore all else (to any major or minor extent) save the intonation of the work.</p><p>Well, one *can*, but one&apos;s work suffers accordingly.</p><p>Whether classical, pop, or any other genre, music requires care in preparation and execution. We could be posting to Making Rhythmic Music, or Making Period Music, or Making * Music - the last word must be Music.</p><p>&gt;But when Bjork (&amp; producer) start a tune with some coarse MIDI sound, &gt;that&apos;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be there.  It&apos;s not &quot;supposed&quot; to be a real clarinet. &gt;They&apos;re writing for the box.  They&apos;re orchestrating for MIDI/samples/etc.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt;... but I think we can write some great music with the computer tools that &gt;are currently available, and, unlike performers, can usually allow us to &gt;write in any tuning system we can imagine, if we just give some thought to &gt;orchestration for those tools.</p><p>And the only thing this scenario will *always* miss is the energy and moment of magic that can only come from a live performance. Maybe sometimes the trade-off is worth it. Even though I make my living performing live music, I constantly listen to recordings as well. I derive great pleasure from them. But it&apos;s been rare that an artist, live, has been less enjoyable than a recording of them.</p><p>&gt;We are all so obssessed with pitch-structure, that when it comes time to &gt;make music, we&apos;ve only done 50% of the work</p><p>If that!</p><p>&gt;--yet we just throw it into a MIDI file, and call it done.</p><p>I try not to, and hopefully with enough examples of good midi orchestration, as well as mixing and production, people will start to realize the benefits of honing a piece to enhance the listener&apos;s experience.</p><p>&gt;In a way, we could learn something from Brian Ferneyhough, annoying though &gt;he may be.  He always starts with the instrument, and works out from &gt;there.  Pitch-structure is secondary.</p><p>Heresy. Besides, I&apos;ve seen BF, and I seriously doubt he works out. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
