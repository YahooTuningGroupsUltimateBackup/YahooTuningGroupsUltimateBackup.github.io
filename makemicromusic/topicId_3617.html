Maybe that&apos;s as important a lesson as anything that<br/>follows, and an appropriate lesson for this group.</p><p>Based on the transcription, I might say that my scales seem to contain<br/>_some_ &quot;Georgian-like&quot; intervals -- but with voices freely following<br/>their own flexible intonation as they traverse the spectrum, that<br/>isn&apos;t so surprising.</p><p>                       -           -           -</p><p>Kraig, that _Georgia I_ album by UNESCO was also my initiation to this<br/>music around 1970 or 1971, and the experience was especially powerful<br/>for me because it was like meeting a friendly cousin with striking<br/>affinities as well as differences.</p><p>Coming from my own tradition of medieval polyphony from Western<br/>Europe, I found that the Georgian traditional polyphony was indeed<br/>often strikingly similar: the music &quot;spoke my language,&quot; although also<br/>of course its own unique language. (Following a remark by Bill Alves<br/>once, I wonder how Georgian singers might hear French music from<br/>around 1200.)</p><p>Just yesterday, at the library, I read part of a fine article on<br/>Georgian music in the Garland encyclopedia of world musics, and was<br/>reminded of my love for this music over the years. Thanks to MMM for<br/>providing the occasion for me to revisit this friendly ground -- and<br/>get some ideas for my own musicmaking.</p><p>For example, I was looking over one two-voice piece in a related<br/>article on the North Caucasus, and reflected that it could almost have<br/>looked like a piece by Leonin, a composer often associated with the<br/>Parisian school sometime around 1175 -- or that Leonin could have<br/>almost come from the same school as these skilled musicians. Here I<br/>say &quot;almost,&quot; because there were inflections which marked the music as<br/>coming from its own special place.</p><p>Then, I reflected, how might I play something like this now -- as<br/>someone who has walked similar paths of improvisation (albeit on<br/>keyboard, a different thing than the fine coordination and cooperation<br/>of singers) for some 30 years?</p><p>Then I got some ideas: how about making this sustained minor seventh<br/>a 7:4 (or a tempered approximation?), this minor third a 7:6, and this<br/>inflected minor second a narrow step around 30:29 (no choice, unless I<br/>transpose, since that&apos;s the step available in the tuning I was<br/>considering).</p><p>It&apos;s curious to feel this kind of musicmaking shaping up on the basis<br/>of looking at a score in what inevitably is the metaphor of notation,<br/>with the imperfections of my own keyboard technique and ability to<br/>follow the subtle rhythms indicated by the notation (let alone get<br/>close to what fluid performers were actually doing in this piece)<br/>making the &quot;translation&quot; process of my rendition yet more<br/>metaphorical.</p><p>How strange in the early 21st century, as a follower of one<br/>13th-century tradition, to be inspired by another (Georgian<br/>three-voice polyphony has a documentation going back to the 11th or<br/>12th century) -- helped along by means of mass communication which<br/>also threaten the witting and unwitting destruction of many world<br/>cultures and musics if &quot;inertia&quot; is allowed to proceed.</p><p>Anyway, now to the scales. One question would be how close Georgian<br/>fourths should be to a pure 4:3 -- gamelan music, for one, teaches us<br/>that the primary concords of _kempyung_ (the equivalent of &quot;fifth&quot; or<br/>&quot;fourth&quot;) can be quite a distance from these ratios.</p><p>One trait of Georgian music, as some Western European schools of<br/>13th-century music, is the use of sonorities like 6:8:9, a fifth and a<br/>fourth together above the same lowest note. Should all these intervals<br/>be close to simple ratios, or should we have a fifth at about 3:2, but<br/>a wide fourth (and major second narrower than 9:8, as some of the<br/>sources quoted here propose)?</p><p>The temperaments I&apos;m about to give offer some different &quot;solutions&quot; to<br/>these questions for fixed-pitch instruments, with some emphasizing<br/>near-pure 6:8:9 concords, and others featuring stretched fourths, and<br/>in one scale also octaves.</p><p>For these scales, however &quot;Georgian-like&quot; or otherwise, I&apos;ve used a<br/>tuning system called Peppermint 24. Erv Wilson and Keenan Pepper<br/>defined the basic temperament with fifths at around 704.096 cents, or<br/>about 2.14 cents wide. This 24-note version has two regular 12-note<br/>chains spaced to form some pure minor thirds at 7:6 (~266.87 cents).</p><p>Curiously, based on my recollections of those albums of Georgian music<br/>(which I should hear again), I really couldn&apos;t say how closely the<br/>tuning comes to some of the models posted here. What sticks with me is<br/>an impression of modes and cadences often vividly like those familiar<br/>to me from a 13th-century Western European tradition, but with often<br/>strikingly distinct inflections.</p><p>There&apos;s also a distinctive Georgian technique of having a high voice<br/>with a &quot;yodelling&quot; pattern -- there&apos;s a term for it, and it adds lots<br/>of excitement to the contrapuntal texture.</p><p>It was these traits that I noticed, without much reflection on fine<br/>points of intonation -- maybe a common human response to beautiful<br/>music, embracing it without necessarily considering niceties of ratios<br/>or cents.</p><p>What I want to caution is that these scales are responses to the idea<br/>of patterns with lots of neutral or semi-neutral steps and intervals,<br/>rather like the Italian opera and oratorio around 1600 were responses<br/>to ancient Greek music.</p><p>First, here&apos;s a scale starting with a &quot;small major second&quot; step and so<br/>including a wide fourth at around 516.75 cents between the second and<br/>fifth degrees, and also some steps of around 129 cents (near 14:13),<br/>149 cents (near 12:11), and 159 cents (near 23:21).</p><p>! mmmgeo1.scl<br/>!<br/>Scale for MakeMicroMusic in Peppermint 24, maybe a bit like Georgian tunings<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 187.34894<br/> 336.86046<br/> 495.90439<br/> 704.09561<br/> 832.76485<br/> 991.80879<br/> 2/1</p><p>The next scale takes this approach a step further with a stretched<br/>octave as well as fourth:</p><p>! mmmgeo2.scl<br/>!<br/>Scale for MakeMicroMusic in Peppermint 24, maybe a bit like Georgian tunings<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 208.19121<br/> 367.23515<br/> 516.74667<br/> 704.09561<br/> 863.13954<br/> 1071.33075<br/> 1220.84228</p><p>Another approach is to seek sonorities close to 6:8:9, as in this<br/>tuning:</p><p>! mmmgeo3a.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint 24 scale for MakeMicroMusic, maybe a bit &quot;Georgian-like&quot;?<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 128.66925<br/> 336.86046<br/> 495.90439<br/> 704.09561<br/> 832.76485<br/> 991.80879<br/> 2/1</p><p>or this one:</p><p>! mmmgeo4a.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint 24 scale for MakeMicroMusic, maybe a bit &quot;Georgian-like&quot;?<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 128.66925<br/> 336.86046<br/> 495.90439<br/> 704.09561<br/> 832.76485<br/> 1040.95607<br/> 2/1</p><p>or this one, just a differen rotation of this last set of notes:</p><p>! mmmgeo4b.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint 24 scale for MakeMicroMusic, maybe a bit &quot;Georgian-like&quot;?<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 208.19121<br/> 367.23515<br/> 495.90439<br/> 704.09561<br/> 863.13954<br/> 1071.33075<br/> 2/1</p><p>The KEY feature of Scala permits lots of experimentation with these<br/>rotations, and I hope that, given the people here, these scales might<br/>help to instigate some more musicmaking.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=3621 href="#3621">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2002 6:00:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;M.

Just like Western music contemporary<br/>Georgian music has its own pop, a wonderful Western classical<br/>tradition with some Georgian composers, and of course (to my suprise)<br/>Britney Spears, M&amp;M etc.</p><p>Its not really Folk music per say, it was actually traditionally<br/>orthodox church music like Gregorian chants. Georgians have told me<br/>that it dates back to the 3rd century, when the first Georgian script<br/>surfaced, but that may be an exageration. It was largely passed down<br/>orally and varies with Region. Georgia in fact is incredibly<br/>culturally diverse and far from isolated. It once was the gateway of<br/>the world standing between the mid-east and china&apos;s trade routes. It<br/>has been frequented by the Persians, Turks, Mongolians, Huns, Romans,<br/>Greeks, Europeans of all sorts, and all the familiar central asiatic<br/>peoples... It sort of makes it a mystery that the Georgians remain so<br/>unique :) Georgia isn&apos;t actually in Russia either, it is its own<br/>nation between the black and caspian seas. One might note that the<br/>Georgian language (like icelandic) has undergone a much slower rate<br/>of change than other languages. They can still read 1000 year old<br/>texts (like the Knight who wore panther skins) and understand them<br/>more or less, and there are isolated nonurban areas where they still<br/>speak similar dialects.</p><p>Sort of back on topic, many call this singing polyphonic yodling,<br/>which is strange.

As is well known, Islamic civilization<br/>played a central and catalytic role in the &quot;12th-century Renaissance&quot;<br/>of Gothic Europe, and my encounter with ancient Greek and Middle<br/>Eastern tuning systems seems a kind of 21st-century Renaissance.</p><p>Since this group is especially devoted to the experience of making<br/>music, and the promotion of that experience, I might say a bit about<br/>my first encounter at the keyboard with Buzurg in a &quot;gently tempered&quot;<br/>version (a term explained below). It&apos;s one thing to know the ratios,<br/>another thing to have notes, intervals, and sonorities dance in<br/>shifting permutations across and around the keyboard.</p><p>At first I tried to get the feeling of the scale -- actually, just one<br/>variant of a Buzurg maqam or mode -- by playing it as unaccompanied<br/>melody, or above a drone. There are charming variations in the sizes<br/>of intervals, and also what seem to me stimulating &quot;asymmetries&quot; from<br/>a medieval European diatonic perspective. Actually, this version of<br/>Buzurg may have been a bit problematic from the viewpoint of Arabic or<br/>Persian theory around 1300 also: there&apos;s a 7:6 step (about 267 cents),<br/>which one opinion would hold irregularly large for an undivided scale<br/>interval. One might, however, take the Syntonic Chromatic of Ptolemy<br/>as a precedent.</p><p>Then I started to experiment with some progressions for three or four<br/>voices, and quickly found some really striking things that seemed to<br/>go from a somewhat &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; sound to 13th-century Europe to<br/>something curiously rather &quot;Gershwinesque.&quot;</p><p>One thing I often found happening was that the set of notes in Buzurg<br/>seemed to guide me into progressions that I would not have found so<br/>readily otherwise, because my conventional practice would have led to<br/>more &quot;standard&quot; resolutions (e.g. &quot;let an unstable sonority resolve,<br/>if possible, by stepwise contrary motion in all voices&quot;).</p><p>Keeping within the scale, and &quot;doing what comes naturally&quot; within that<br/>set of notes, I found that a world of progressions opened where voices<br/>move by thirds (often neutral or semi-neutral), maybe explaining some<br/>of the &quot;jazzy&quot; or &quot;Bluesy&quot; feeling -- or where minor sevenths expand<br/>to octaves and fourths expands to fifths by contrary motion, and so<br/>on.</p><p>These types of progressions weren&apos;t totally new to me, but in Buzurg<br/>they often step to the forefront; in another setting, I might indeed<br/>briefly stumble upon and write down such &quot;alternative&quot; resolutions,<br/>but mostly as asides to the &quot;conventional&quot; ones.</p><p>This exercise of trying to keep within the notes of the scale, and<br/>exploring some of the rich permutations and combinations to be found<br/>there, had a humorous aspect. Sometimes I would find a pleasant<br/>resolution, write it down, and then realize that I had used one or<br/>more notes outside the scale. I call such progressions _ekmelic_, a<br/>Greek term which has &quot;outside the scale&quot; as one possible<br/>interpretation.</p><p>Of course, such ekmelic progressions are also a legitimate musical<br/>resource in one type of &quot;fusion&quot; style, and for me fit a 14th-century<br/>European kind of technique where inflected or &quot;invented&quot; notes<br/>(_musica ficta_) are often used to obtain intervals such as fifths at<br/>desired positions in the gamut, for example.</p><p>However, the strength of staying within Buzurg is that it fosters a<br/>special kind of sound, favoring progressions in many positions which I<br/>might otherwise use only occasionally. One might say that in _musica<br/>ficta_, the vertical progressions reshape to a degree the melodic<br/>steps; in a more &quot;scale-oriented&quot; style, the notes of Buzurg often<br/>reshape the patterns of vertical sonority and progression.</p><p>Now for the delicate matter of &quot;gentle temperament,&quot; and its<br/>compromises. First, I&apos;ll give a Scala file for a just intonation<br/>version of this variant of Buzurg:</p><p>-------------------  Scala file begins next line of text ------------</p><p>! buzurg1.scl<br/>!<br/>Variant of Buzurg (Qutb al Din al-Shirazi, Persian theorist, c. 1300)<br/> 8<br/>!<br/> 14/13<br/> 16/13<br/> 4/3<br/> 56/39<br/> 3/2<br/> 18/11<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>------------- Scale file ended with blank line after &quot;2/1&quot; ----------</p><p>Here&apos;s a file for my tempered version in Peppermint 24, a system based<br/>on the temperament defined by Erv Wilson and Keenan Pepper with fifths<br/>of around 704.096 cents.
