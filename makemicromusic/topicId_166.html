We could have versions of the same piece with or without<br/>fifthtone shifts or progressions, and with or without adaptive tuning<br/>or JI as opposed to usual meantone or 31-tET.</p><p>Please post those retunings, and thank you for a dialogue through<br/>words and music which brings together 16th-century and 21st-century<br/>approaches to adaptive tuning and JI.</p><p>In peace and friendship,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
