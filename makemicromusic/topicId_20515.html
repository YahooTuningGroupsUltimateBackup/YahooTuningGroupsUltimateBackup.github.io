Yes, the imagination needs nourishment and impetus and there all things are open for interpretation and i guess it would seem logical enough that a &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;strange&quot; tuning might be better suited for that purpose than their opposites, but only marginally so at best i&apos;d say.
