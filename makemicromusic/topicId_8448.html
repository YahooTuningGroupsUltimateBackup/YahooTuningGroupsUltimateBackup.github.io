I&apos;m<br/>almost positive that there should be no chords that are particularly<br/>difficult on this one, and all the keys should be playable.  It would<br/>work dang well for diatonic and decatonic, but porcupine scales<br/>suffer a bit.</p><p>I see now that there will be no design that doesn&apos;t require some<br/>sacrifice.  No design that does any one of the 3 systems (superpyth-<br/>7, pajara-10, or porcupine-8) particularly well will do all 3 equally<br/>well.  I guess we&apos;ll just have to decide which design provides the<br/>most acceptable compromise.  If anyone has any thoughts on the<br/>pros/cons of the various designs, please post.  I think we need as<br/>many varied perspectives as we can get.</p></div><h3><a id=8465 href="#8465">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2005 11:18:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Igliashon,</p><p>Sorry I haven&apos;t replied in more detail sooner -- I was on the road<br/>in Northern California.  Now I&apos;m slammed at work.  I&apos;ll try to make<br/>time in a day or two.</p><p>&gt;I see now that there will be no design that doesn&apos;t require some<br/>&gt;sacrifice.

I would bias it toward pajara, because<br/>it seems the most fruitful for the most forward-pushing musical<br/>material.  Really, I prefer meantone to superpyth. for diatonic<br/>stuff, though the latter can have a nice edge.  Porcupine is cool,<br/>but maybe you can build another keyboard at a later time to favor it.<br/>Anyway, this is really just a matter of personal taste/approach.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
