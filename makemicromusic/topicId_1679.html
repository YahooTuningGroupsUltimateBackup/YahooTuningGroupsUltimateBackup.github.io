How about a stint on<br/>&gt; the &quot;Tonight&quot; show??</p><p>&gt; JP</p><p>Joe,</p><p>I wrote it for you actually.</p><p>I was going to send it to you privately but then I got<br/>bold or stupid and posted it.</p><p>Thanks for the warm welcome!</p><p>Actually, I&apos;ve got something that I am planning to send<br/>to Jay Leno - a tourist brochure from Virginia that is<br/>a real crack up. If you see it on there you&apos;ll know who<br/>sent it in.</p><p>I have talked before with others about the possibility<br/>of two great things -- one a stand up comedy routine<br/>about tuning, and the other &quot;Tuning Talk with Brian<br/>McLaren&quot; -- a contentious call-in radio show with a<br/>combined energy of Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern that<br/>has every one up in arms.</p><p>Personally I think everyone should write reviews of<br/>each others dream music.</p><p>Maybe we should form a new group just for that<br/>actually. I guess that means its time to take this<br/>thread to metatuning now that we are talking about<br/>tuning lists.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1684 href="#1684">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.
