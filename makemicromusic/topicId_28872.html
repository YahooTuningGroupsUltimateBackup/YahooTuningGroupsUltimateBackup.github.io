It&apos;s 15 tracks and is divided into 5 sections<br/>of 3 tracks each, and I made video for each of the sections. The album doesn&apos;t<br/>have a track order, each section is somewhat independent of the others, but they<br/>are still a cohesive whole. I&apos;ll be releasing a video each week day (Monday,<br/>Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday) and then the downloadable tracks with liner<br/>notes and artwork on Friday, all for free. The first video was posted<br/>yesterday, and can be found here: <a href="http://youtu.be/Erd4t6C6gUk">http://youtu.be/Erd4t6C6gUk</a></p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
