The necessity is to get them to the point where many<br/>people respect it, not are crazy about it.  Take the average musician who has<br/>heard anything microtonal and they will likely give a statement like what Brian<br/>Eno gives above.  IMVHO, this is a reflecting of the community&apos;s having<br/>virtually no stress on entertainment and almost completely on complexity of art.</p><p>  Now we have some artists like Sevish who does a lot of stuff middle of the<br/>spectrum (IE artistic and entertaining to a fair share of listeners on and off<br/>the microtonal community)...but they get no where in competitions and rarely<br/>even mentioned in discussions.  I&apos;m saying we should at least have a few such<br/>&quot;middle of the road&quot; ambassadors for microtonality who are allowed to be praised<br/>for their contributions toward entertainment without being somewhat<br/>&quot;ex-communicated&quot; for being &quot;anti-art&quot; just because they somewhat focus on<br/>entertainment as well.<br/>    Again the problem seems to be, even middle of the road music (both focused<br/>on &quot;art&quot; and &quot;entertainment&quot;) doesn&apos;t get taken seriously most of the time here,<br/>only much more avant-garde music.</p><p>    What would happen if the community was at least respected by most<br/>professional musicians and a fair share of listeners?  Likely an influx of<br/>microtonal instruments at decent/&quot;non-custom-made&quot; prices, many more gigs for<br/>microtonal musicians, much more microtonal music to listen to, many more forums<br/>to discuss microtonal music on....in short, a broader community.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2011 9:35:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>you need to listen to what I just posted if you think posts here are<br/>too artsy :-)</p><p>On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 12:26 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...................<br/>&gt; I think you guys are all taking this the wrong way.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s an absolute for art vs. entertainment far as music...but<br/>&gt; a continuum...and that most of the stuff that comes out of here is so far toward<br/>&gt; the art side people often thing we microtonalists are a bit crazy.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2011 10:07:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 12:26 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...................<br/>&gt; I think you guys are all taking this the wrong way.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s an absolute for art vs. entertainment far as music...but<br/>&gt; a continuum...and that most of the stuff that comes out of here is so far toward<br/>&gt; the art side people often thing we microtonalists are a bit crazy.
