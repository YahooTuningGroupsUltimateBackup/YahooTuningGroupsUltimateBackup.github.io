In *one day* we went from encouraging composing to<br/>Hitler.</p><p>This is the very definition of Godwin&apos;s Law. See<br/><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Godwin%27s%20law">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Godwin%27s%20law</a></p><p>Godwin stipulates: &quot;As an online discussion grows longer, the<br/>probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&quot;</p><p>Lighten up, gentlemen. Try not to be too defensive.</p><p>My composition teacher in college gave me that advice, when I defended<br/>another one of my student pieces against his gentle criticism. He was<br/>just trying to suggest another way of thinking about music that I may<br/>not have thought about. He wasn&apos;t taking me out to be shot. We are not<br/>out to get anyone.

What you *will* find on the blog is this:</p><p>&grave;&grave;Musical Josef Mengeles like Milton Babbitt and Alan Forte and Robert<br/>Morris who tried to flense away the ligaments of language, the tendons<br/>of cultural connotations, the muscles of synaesthaesia, and all the<br/>skin of extra-mathematical supra-logical aspects from music left us<br/>with set of bleached bones. The attempt to reduce music to dead math<br/>and silent logic yielded unlistenable swill and unreadable jargon.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Mengele may not be as famous a Nazi as Hitler, but he is notorious.</p><p>Here&apos;s the Wikipedia article on the man:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengele">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengele</a></p><p>Gann&apos;s trope comparing Babbitt and Forte to this sadistic Nazi butcher<br/>needs to be understood in context, the context being the<br/>marginalization for a long period of non-serial music, and a music<br/>world where joking references to music critics being &quot;serial killers&quot;<br/>who would simply dismiss with contempt non-serial music like Gann&apos;s if<br/>they bothered to review it at all have long been common.</p><p>That context is not this context. Here we have a group with a history<br/>of sneering at, not composers like Gann, but &quot;dabblers&quot; like me who<br/>commit the thought crime of using mathematical theory when composing,<br/>and who compound their crime by not being professional musicans (most<br/>of us are not, so far as I can see). Moreover, we are supposed to be<br/>turning over a new leaf; I was hoping that leaf would be one where<br/>microtonal composers were welcome simply because they were microtonal<br/>composers, without having to show a union card. When our attention is<br/>directed to a blog which dumps on mathematical techniques, and when we<br/>are exhorted to forget about theory, it acquires a different<br/>contextual meaning when we reference it to this group and its not<br/>always pleasant history.</p></div><h3><a id=7301 href="#7301">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2004 3:08:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene opined,</p><p>&gt; Gann&apos;s trope comparing Babbitt and Forte to this sadistic Nazi butcher<br/>&gt; needs to be understood in context,</p><p>And discussions of Nazis should probably go elsewhere.
