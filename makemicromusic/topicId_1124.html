Laughing<br/>Squid looks fine, as I&apos;d get a lot more web space and the ability to run<br/>CGI scripts than with my current ISP.  If it were possible to add mailing<br/>lists as part of the deal, I could do that.  I don&apos;t know how much the<br/>bandwidth would cost.</p><p>&gt; LAUGHING SQUID&apos;S RESPONSE:<br/>&gt; ________________________<br/>&gt; We are looking into Mailman, but it is currently not something we<br/>&gt; support.  We&apos;re not sure if we want to add email list services because<br/>&gt; of the  potential spam problems that they may create as well as the<br/>&gt; increased load  on our servers. Maintaining excellent server<br/>&gt; performance is one of our main  priorities.</p><p>They mention CGI mailing list products.  I don&apos;t know what these are like.<br/> I found Mailman as another site had the logo for using it.  It&apos;s Free<br/>(GPL) and has a feature-ful web space.  It&apos;s written mostly in Python,<br/>which is good for me because it&apos;s a language I like and am therefore<br/>familiar with.  As I want to run Python scripts anyway (for example to<br/>turn my temperament finder into a CGI) it might be worth trying to get<br/>this working.</p><p>I do see some problems.  It expects cron jobs to run which you couldn&apos;t do<br/>with pure CGI.  Also some of it is written in C.  I don&apos;t know if you&apos;d be<br/>allowed to run C code on the server for security reasons.  And there was<br/>something in the Laughing Squid documentation about not being able to read<br/>mail from a terminal, I don&apos;t know how important that would be.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping spam could be deterred by only allowing subscribers to post,<br/>and ensuring all subscribers have a valid e-mail address.  I know Yahoo<br/>does some clever stuff with the IP addresses, or something, because of my<br/>failure in the past to forge headers.  That might be harder to copy.  But<br/>then again, a few independent mailing lists wouldn&apos;t be a big target for<br/>spammers.</p><p>&gt; The whole email list issue has been around since we first started and<br/>&gt; we  are still undecided if we are ever going to go down that path. One<br/>&gt; option  might be to find some to host just the list for you and then we<br/>&gt; can create  an A record to their server, ie <a href="http://lists.yourdomain.com">lists.yourdomain.com</a>.</p><p>We moved to Yahoo (well, originally OneList) on the understanding that the<br/>adverts would be discreet.  That&apos;s no longer the case, so it is worth<br/>looking if we can move.  Although, as it&apos;s only the web interface that<br/>seems to be a problem, so moving somewhere we don&apos;t get a web interface<br/>would be somewhat pointless.</p><p>Unless there&apos;s no way of setting to text-only e-mail.  I don&apos;t know how<br/>many people have noticed this, but when you join a new group you&apos;re<br/>automatically set to have all e-mail converted to HTML format.  The reason<br/>is that they can insert banner ads, web bugs, cookies and the like.</p><p>There&apos;s another free mailing list site that Laughing Squid linked to.<br/>First thing when I visited the home page, a new browser window appeared.<br/>So much for them ...</p><p>If we really don&apos;t want the pop-ups, there are plenty of alternatives that<br/>some of us can afford to subsidise:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.lsoft.com/products/default.asp?item=ease_home">http://www.lsoft.com/products/default.asp?item=ease_home</a>&gt;<br/>Listserv mailing list hosting.  Priced by number of subscribers, up to $34<br/>a month for 251-300.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.hosting4less.com/descriptions.html#mailing">http://www.hosting4less.com/descriptions.html#mailing</a>&gt;<br/>from $15 a month, supports mailing lists and Perl/Python CGI</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://home.iwc.net/website.htm">http://home.iwc.net/website.htm</a>&gt;<br/>$30 a month, majordomo mailing list (does that include a web interface??)<br/>and Perl/Python CGI.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.icdsoft.com/master.html">http://www.icdsoft.com/master.html</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.oneplanhost.com/cgi-bin/esp?PAGE=plan.esp">http://www.oneplanhost.com/cgi-bin/esp?PAGE=plan.esp</a>&gt;<br/>Perl/Python/C++ CGI, only $6 or $7 per month respectively.  No mailing<br/>lists.</p><p>Price comparisons aren&apos;t fair because bandwidth and likely uptimes will<br/>vary.  Still, the cheap ones are tempting.  My inclinations is to go with<br/>the one I have a personal recommendation for (Laughing Squid) but I could<br/>get a similar service with the mailing lists for about the same price.</p><p>Here&apos;s how you start a newsgroup:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/creating-newsgroups/part1/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/creating-newsgroups/part1/</a>&gt;.  Crunch is<br/>you need 100 net votes in favour.  So how about rec.music.microtonal?  I<br/>think that would be an advantage for the main list, because it makes it<br/>easier to filter, and means you don&apos;t get a load of messages you don&apos;t<br/>want in your inbox.</p><p>I still think this discussion should be on metatuning ...</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
