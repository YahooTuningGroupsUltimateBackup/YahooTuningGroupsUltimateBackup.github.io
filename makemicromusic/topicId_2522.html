We were having some problems with &quot;clipping&quot; on &quot;low end&quot;<br/>sound cards which mine appears to be (It&apos;s a SoundBlaster 128, but I<br/>guess that&apos;s not so much these days...)<br/>Anyway, he solved that problem, and the master is quite nice now:<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/jpehrson/">http://catharsis.egregious.net/jpehrson/</a></p><p>Just wanted to make a quick comment. There was no problem with the first master in regard to playback as a CD (even with the Soundblaster 128, my SB Live, or any CD player). Playback of the original processed mp3 is distorted with these cards if system wave volume is above 50% using Winamp or other editing utilities. Windows Media Player corrects for this and no clipping artifacts are heard. It turns out that with any limited files (tons of examples of commercial CDs) that are made into mp3s will behave in this way. Joseph&apos;s piece, Blect, has several harmonic peaks (<a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/jpehrson/fft.jpg">http://catharsis.egregious.net/jpehrson/fft.jpg</a>) that when limited and played back as an mp3 on lower end sound cards with system wave volume above 50% causes a fair amount of distortion.</p><p>The new mp3s are not limited and do not overload lower end sound cards even with system wave volume at max.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
