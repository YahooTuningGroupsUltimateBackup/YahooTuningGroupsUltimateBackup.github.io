Hey, ok I end up talking to myself, so shoot me ;P</p><p>Terms like &apos;esoteric&apos; and &apos;conventional&apos; are relative terms as we all know. Wonder by which kinds of guitar improvised music can we glean the convention from? For most of us, that would have to be Top 40 radio or MTV pop-rock. As the guitarist on the album I must say I did not wish to try to emulate pop or conventional rock guitar work at all. I m not defending the guitar but just defining things more clearly.</p><p>However for someone who may think that the guitar music of say artists like David Torn, Steve Tibbetts or Allan Holdsworth represent the core issue of &apos;conventional licks&apos; then I would not know how to respond. It is almost like declaring (assuming one had the right to)<br/>that Zakir Hussein for example is a &apos;mere&apos; or &apos;conventional&apos; tabla player, or that Bach is &apos;just&apos; a common composer.</p><p>Having said all that, a listener&apos;s perspective on music is a very personal one and I would not wish to offend anyone or challenge anyone&apos;s position here, but to clarify and communicate mine.</p><p>Catrina</p><p><a href="http://dominacatrinalee.bandcamp.com">http://dominacatrinalee.bandcamp.com</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;prentrodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been enjoying this music all evening.
