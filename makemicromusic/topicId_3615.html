Putting very slightly varying<br/>&gt;amplitude, and pitch envelopes (via volume and pitchbend) on every note,<br/>&gt;for example.</p><p>Check out Touch&iuml;&iquest;&half; Midi File Enhancer,<br/><a href="http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Touche/">http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Touche/</a><br/>Which fits to a part of your specifikation. It doesn&apos;t touch intonation but<br/>at least all the rest:</p><p>&quot;Tired of your midi files sounding like a robot orchestra? Touch&iuml;&iquest;&half; uses a<br/>bounded pseudo-random self referencing algorithm with user input to put that<br/>&quot;human touch&quot; back into MIDI files.<br/>Touche&apos; adds tiny variations in timing, velocity, and accent to each note in<br/>a copy of your midi file. Those little variations or &quot;imperfections&quot; are<br/>what humans find lacking in most midi files. Perfect timing, etc. that is<br/>too good to be true sounds flat and machine like.</p><p>Just set three sliders, choose which midi channels to process and select a<br/>mile file. Even long midi files with multiple tracks take just seconds to<br/>process. Hit play and Touche&apos; sends the newly interpreted masterpiece to<br/>your default midi player for your review. You can save the output, abandon<br/>it, or reprocess it for layered effects.</p><p>You don&apos;t really know how good your MIDI files are until they&apos;ve been<br/>Touch&iuml;&iquest;&half;d&quot;</p></div>
