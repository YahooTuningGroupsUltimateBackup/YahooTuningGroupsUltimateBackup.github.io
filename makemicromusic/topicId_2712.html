One would hope that<br/>&gt; this could be done digitaly - and easily.</p><p>Apparently it doesn&apos;t. However, on Windows I have always had marvelous<br/>luck just hooking CoolEdit up to record the &quot;Stereo Mixer&quot; output to a WAV<br/>file -- works for any sound output, and I use it with all kinds of apps<br/>that don&apos;t support making WAV files. I&apos;ll ask the author about the WAV file<br/>feature...</p><p>&gt; Wonder if it has pitch envelopes for the harmonics?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t have separate pitch envelopes for each harmonic. The author<br/>also mentioned how nice that feature would be, but it also starts to be a<br/>UI problem as well as a problem for processing power.</p><p>The other thing that I wonder about is non-harmonic partials; or at least<br/>non-harmonic modulators to apply to the carrier in the FM synthesis<br/>section.</p><p>Re the FM7 Jacky wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was able to faithfully import my TX81Z and TX802 patches,<br/>&gt; and it worked wonderfully [...] I learned that it didn&apos;t work<br/>&gt; with full retuning. Sadness filled the room. Hard to believe<br/>&gt; that NI missed this detail.</p><p>Oh, that&apos;s a bummer! I was excited when I first saw the FM7, but without<br/>multi-timbral capability and full keyboard retuning, it just can&apos;t replace<br/>the TX802. I sorta lost my enthusiasm.</p><p>&gt; For folks using the VSTi/DXi paradigm, check out VAZ 2001.<br/>&gt; Full retuning, sampling, multi-timbral, FX, etc... Very cool synth.<br/>&gt; And now our beloved Manuel has programmed Scala to export the .TUN</p><p>Oh, I&apos;ll have to go check it out...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
