Maybe it is the time of year, between some of the important days of the year(s) for many people, maybe just because I&apos;m in the middle of my only 2 days off in months...</p><p>It has been quiet on MMM for a while, and frankly I&apos;m OK with that. I&apos;ve seen many lists where the blather rate is high, and if we go a while between posts I can live with it. Me? Hey, I have something that is occupying *all* my spare time and won&apos;t let up until the middle of March, so I have a total excuse for not writing/recording/posting new music.</p><p>What about any of you?</p><p>Beyond all that (and I *hope* that, pending events, I&apos;ll have both energy and time to make some new music in the springtime), I thought the first of the calendar year might be a good time to clear out the files area. I put this out to the list as a group:</p><p>If You Have Files That Are Older Than 6 Months Old, I&apos;m going to clear them out, OK? I figure that unless it has an enduring need for any new members, it is better to clear the space for future needs than to let things that are - through sheer forgetfullness/neglect/whatever - just sitting idly on a hard disk somewhere.</p><p>If you have something you desperately want save up there, let me know; otherwise, I&apos;ll just let the calendar be the arbiter. And we&apos;ll start the New (Gregorian calendar) Year fresh. Unless I forget...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
