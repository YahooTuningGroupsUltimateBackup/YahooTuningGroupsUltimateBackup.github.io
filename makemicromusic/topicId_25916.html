I would like you to compose a piece<br/>specifically for me to render. It should be 5-7 minutes in length (I<br/>won&apos;t carve that in stone, it can be somewhat shorter or longer, as your<br/>Muse dictates), scored for a small ensemble of instruments (or synths),<br/>and be in a tuning of your choice but no more than 12 pitches, to keep<br/>things simple for me.</p><p>Send me a Scala file of your chosen tuning &amp; a MIDI file with each<br/>instrument assigned to a different channel; specify a tempo &amp; any other<br/>parameters (ex. which instrument is most prominent, if any).</p><p>I think people would love a chance to hear your music in a context other<br/>than that of a piano rendition. I&apos;ll do my best.</p><p>What say you?</p><p>Regards,<br/>jls</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
