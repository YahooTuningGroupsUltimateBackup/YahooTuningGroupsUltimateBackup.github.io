I&apos;ll keep adding and refining,<br/>and I hope to do something similar with my historical tunings page<br/>before the summer&apos;s over. Please let me know if you find problems or<br/>if you have an idea for something the page needs (subject to my<br/>sizeable technical limitations).</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=9884 href="#9884">ðŸ”—</a>kylegann1955 &#x3C;kgann@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2005 10:52:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oops, somehow the link acquired an extraneous period which makes it<br/>not work.

Anyway, great addition to the page, but...</p><p>I only had a moment to check, yet I think you should make sure (and others can check as well to make sure it isn&apos;t just me): the very first example, JustC, seems that the levels recorded into the file are too high, and cause some glitches/distortion. In this example I notice it on the third note played, and in my mp3 player the lower frequencies are definitely hitting the top, so you may have recorded too hot.</p><p>I may be able to check all the audio later, but gotta go off to work right now. It&apos;s either you or backing up Natalie Cole...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9886 href="#9886">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2005 12:25:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle,</p><p>I believe I was in error on your mp3 files, I think the levels are OK.<br/>Mystery setting was switched on in my player...</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9887 href="#9887">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2005 12:29:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle, Jon,<br/>The files are not distorted when I played them. Perhaps it is the lack<br/>of beating that is causing a buzz in your speakers. The files are<br/>recorded at a high by not distorted level, as checked by CoolEdit scope.</p><p>This is a great resource. I recommend everyone go and take a look at<br/>this great introduction to Just. Lots of good stuff there.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I only had a moment to check, yet I think you should make sure (and<br/>others<br/>&gt; can check as well to make sure it isn&apos;t just me): the very first<br/>example,<br/>&gt; JustC, seems that the levels recorded into the file are too high,<br/>and cause<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div>
