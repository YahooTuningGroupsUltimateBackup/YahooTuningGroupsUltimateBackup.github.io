This device was<br/>&gt; very artfully used in Aaron&apos;s recording in 19-EDO of a famous piece<br/>&gt; from the epoch around 1600 by John Bull with remote transpositions on<br/>&gt; the hexachord _Ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la_:<br/>&gt; &gt;           &lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Please let me also very warmly thank Harold Fortuin and others for<br/>&gt; their good advice to be aware of things like phrasing -- quite<br/>&gt; available as a matter for artistic refinement in coding rhythms<br/>&gt; numerically. Specifically, I found that digitally &quot;breathing&quot; by<br/>&gt; borrowing part of the value of a note at the end of phrase for a pause<br/>&gt; is a wise counsel, complemented here by Aaron&apos;s Gaussian rhythm<br/>&gt; algorithm.<br/>&gt; &gt; As I mention above, a question which I&apos;m not sure about is<br/>&gt; instrumentation, or the MIDI equivalent. While I tend to like bright<br/>&gt; timbres for lots of early music, and a &quot;mixed consort&quot; kind of sound to<br/>&gt; bring out the different lines, I&apos;m not sure that that&apos;s the best approach<br/>&gt; here. Bright timbres bring out the smoothly blending thirds of meantone,<br/>&gt; and also lend a special emphasis to the diesis steps and shifts in the<br/>&gt; last section of the piece -- an overemphasis, or just making the most of a<br/>&gt; very striking effect?<br/>&gt; &gt; A final comment on this important Vicentino anniversary: all too<br/>&gt; often, this great composer&apos;s and theorist&apos;s writings are discussed in<br/>&gt; the abstract, without an opportunity for actually hearing the<br/>&gt; &quot;enharmonic&quot; or fifthtone music of what is now often called the<br/>&gt; Manneristic Era in Western European music (roughly 1540-1640, say).<br/>&gt; &gt; While begging pardon for any imperfections in these files, inevitable<br/>&gt; or otherwise, I hope that this opening of my Internet celebration of<br/>&gt; the 450th anniversary of Vicentino&apos;s great treatise may illustrate how<br/>&gt; both mp3 and ogg formats can be useful in making and sharing<br/>&gt; microtonal music.<br/>&gt; &gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt; &gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Yahoo!

I<br/>&gt; thought the timbres you chose worked very well.  My only criticism (and<br/>&gt; this is about the composition itself, not your realization of it), is<br/>&gt; that, in the latter part of the piece, I wanted it to longer a little<br/>&gt; longer between shifts.  But that&apos;s just my personal aesthetic prejudice<br/>&gt; (as I&apos;ve stated elsewhere on the list).</p><p>Hi, Dave, and you raise an interesting point about diesis shifts:<br/>while Vicentino has lots of them close together in this piece, they<br/>can also be used more &quot;moderately&quot; for sectional contrasts, for<br/>example. As your response, illustrates, tastes may vary.</p><p>Thank you for the encouraging feedback on timbres: I wondered if my<br/>choice might emphasize, or even overemphasize, the diesis contrasts,<br/>but decided that &quot;this piece is meant to be dramatic.&quot;</p><p>Of course, Aaron&apos;s harpsichord version lends another perspective to the<br/>piece, especially appropriate since Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo might well<br/>have either performed this piece in an instrumental version or lent<br/>support to singers. Congratulations, Aaron, on a really neat rendition!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m looking forward to hearing more like this.</p><p>A project I have for this year is to do renditions of other pieces<br/>from the 16th and early 17th centuries using fifthtones, and I hope to<br/>have more of them available soon, with your response lending a bit of<br/>helpful impetus.</p><p>The kind of stylistic comments you&apos;re offering add interest to the<br/>project.</p><p>Of course, Aaron&apos;s involvement can help multiply both the quantity and<br/>quality of this kind of endeavor: one of the pleasures of this music is<br/>the range of interpretations possible.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m still rapt by _The Gemini Nebula_.</p><p>&gt; - Dave</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
