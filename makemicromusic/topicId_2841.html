You&apos;ve melded so many differing disciplines, and then you turn around and offer it up as something so sweet. Whatta great guy you are!</p><p>I *did* install the Cortona client, and what a cool thing - do I need to send myself a bunch of cards, or can I explore the flowers by just previewing? (though I think that *is* the case...)</p><p>Two items, and since you remember me as a former software guy (who was obsessed with details, implementations, and bugs) you&apos;ll take these as friendly &quot;heads-up&quot; remarks:</p><p>1. In the description about how to view the picture in 3D (both on the preview and on the card desc. itself) you have the following text:</p><p>&quot;You may also be able to this picture in 3D! When you click on it...&quot;</p><p>You are missing the word &quot;see&quot; or &quot;view&quot; after &quot;able&quot;, right?</p><p>2. Is there any way to put a button on the card, or the card page, that can turn *off* the midi sound? I ask this because in the wider world, if one is in an office environment and one receives something like this, it would be very nice to have a handy way to turn off an unexpectedly tuneful computer (hey, everyplace *I* ever worked it wasn&apos;t a problem, but there are some firms at are more uptight...)</p><p>OK, that&apos;s it, but I&apos;m going to make use of the site this week, and I can&apos;t express enough my admiration for you - not only for the implementation, but for being the kind of person that would use talents like this for the purpose of making peoples days brighter...</p><p>...that is, until you unveil the card with the dead flowers and ugly music in 12tet!</p><p>Very big cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2850 href="#2850">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2002 6:58:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>&gt; I *did* install the Cortona client, and what a cool thing - do I need to<br/>&gt; send myself a bunch of cards, or can I explore the flowers by just<br/>&gt; previewing?
