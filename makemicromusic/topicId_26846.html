I also analyzed any other music that came my way, to try and learn the structures, what makes it work. I literally listen to Bach almost every day, guess I&apos;m one of those folks who puts him on a big pedestal...but, don&apos;t worry, I don&apos;t care if others do or not. My favorites are the solo violin sonatas, one of the great masterpieces of music...also love Art of Fugue, solo cello sonatas, lute works, Mass in B Minor, and the Well Tempered Clavier. The bassist with Cream, Jack Bruce, said (on more than one occasion), that if you wanted to learn bass, study Bach...he referred to him as the &quot;governor of basslines.&quot; I have learned a great deal indeed by studying his music. One commentator from Bach&apos;s day put him on the same level as Isaac Newton, which I personally agree with. &quot;The Bach Reader&quot; is a hoot, a collection of letters, town council minutes, articles, etc, from Bach&apos;s day...he got in a fight once with 6 students (pulled his dagger), got reprimanded for playing too weird in church services, spent a month in jail for defying his employer, and walked 250 miles (and back) to hear Buxtehude play...plus had 20 kids. A hard worker indeed...</p><p>And...I have played many different styles of music, from rock/jazz/blues/country, to classical/flamenco/folk, free jazz, pit work for many plays, Symphony Pops concerts, whatever. I enjoy it all, and learn from what I play. And nothing like playing for Texas Mafia clubowners who pack a .38...that&apos;s where you get the grease in your playing, believe me. I draw on all of those musics for my composing. Playing with Bernadette Peters was a transcendent experience, a superb singer/entertainer. The charts for those big shows are incredibly well written, as they are written by the best arrangers in the world. And I also listen to music from all over the planet, with a special affection for Arabic music, the oud in particular...I just realized I have over 50 oud CD&apos;s, just sorta happened. In Arabic music I hear the seeds of blues and funk, especially the rhythms...some of those Arabic percussionist are, well...&quot;funky,&quot; no other way to say it. And Sudanese oud playing, with it&apos;s pentatonic scales, certainly seems bluesy in places. Juan Martin, the great flamenco guitarist, was once quoted in Guitar Player mag as saying there&apos;s a connection between North African music and American rock/pop...absolutely correct. And I personally would love to see more mention of music from other cultures on the tuning lists...best..Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
