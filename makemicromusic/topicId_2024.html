I<br/>have always enjoy Bartok&apos;s<br/>Microcosmos for this reason as it is loaded with such devices in miniature.</p><p>    Either I am part of a minority to think in such ways or people don&apos;t<br/>like to discuss them as being too personal of their musical language. I can<br/>respect that but I think i got more of an understanding of the two that did<br/>respond that any scale or other post. What someone does when they are moving<br/>tells me more alot more than when they are standing still:) Maybe as someone<br/>who really doesn&apos;t like the MP.3 sound nor write works short enough to put<br/>them up, thought there might be other ways of us to interact.<br/>I guess that is the bottom line for what i wanted to say, sorry to be so<br/>wordy.</p><p>Hello Robert!<br/>    This is quite fascinating. I am not sure i completely follow but it<br/>sounds like you have a cross between a canon by augmentation and the eastern<br/>idea of nuclear melody  which i believe we discussed recently.

Maybe a fourth alternating unison with the ones the<br/>third is not playing. The question then becomes what are the two melodies,<br/>the one above and below or the two alternating. a musical relativity.</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; HI there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since FTS does a type of automated counterpoint, maybe it might<br/>&gt; be interesting to say a bit about how it does it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s based on teh idea of passing notes. In the original form,<br/>&gt; all the parts start in unison or at octaves (or more generally<br/>&gt; non octaves, whateve is the interval of equivalence).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the first, fastest part plays its seed above that unison / octave,<br/>&gt; as a passing note. The second part then plays its second note,<br/>&gt; with the first part joining it to start a new seed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That unison of second and first part is a poitn of rest, but also<br/>&gt; a passing note with respect to the third part.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When the second part finishes its seed, the third part moves on to<br/>&gt; its next note, where it is joined by the first two parts, so<br/>&gt; now the three parts are all playig a unison / octave passing note<br/>&gt; with respect to the fourth part..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it goes on. When the last part goes onto its second note,<br/>&gt; then it is still felt as an intermediate note because the seed<br/>&gt; has just started, and there is lots still to go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even wtih one part only playing, one hears some kind of<br/>&gt; pattern superimposed from the first notes of each seed,<br/>&gt; which gives a kind of counterpoint to the tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; YOu can hear lots of examples in real audio format at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/index.htm">http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/index.htm</a><br/>&gt; or play them in FTS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance, the marimba with string quartet has a very straightforward<br/>&gt; fractal tune with the seed just 0 1 0 in scale degrees<br/>&gt; in the five parts - it is a kind of demo of the idea to show<br/>&gt; how it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Basson solo with harp celesta and glockenspiel<br/>&gt; one has a fractal tune, but with the parts playing notes from<br/>&gt; any of the layers of ornamentation rather than in strict<br/>&gt; succession, and the result is quite an intriguing<br/>&gt; feeling of counterpoint - but actually it is still based<br/>&gt; on this passing notes / octaves / unison idea. So,<br/>&gt; nearly all the fractal tunes are based on it in<br/>&gt; one way or another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For an example in mp3 format (which is best to hear how<br/>&gt; they were when I made them, or use an SB LIve!):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mp3.com.au/FractalTuneSmithy/Windchimesscale/">http://mp3.com.au/FractalTuneSmithy/Windchimesscale/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All the notes of the seed are the same length, however the notes<br/>&gt; are played just a little faster as they get higher in pitch,<br/>&gt; - this effect is not very pronounced. It also uses<br/>&gt; an echo effect - each phrase staccato as it has<br/>&gt; alternate rests and notes, and then if the slower<br/>&gt; seed has a rest, the faster seed plays repeats the<br/>&gt; previous seed again quietly, and if you have several<br/>&gt; simultaneous rests in the parts, the top part will play<br/>&gt; very quietly. So, it keeps varying in volume - but not in<br/>&gt; a dramatic way either, all quite gentle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, one can go on to do the same thing with non octave scales.<br/>&gt; Another idea is to have the parts at some other interval<br/>&gt; rather than the octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one has a scale like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 6/5 11/8 3/2 7/4 2/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which I&grave;ve been exploring recently, one can try placing the<br/>&gt; parts three notes apart in the scale like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1  6/5  11/8  3/2  7/4  2/1  12/5  11/4  3/1 7/2  4/1  24/5  11/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A                B              C               D               E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so A:B is 3/2, B:C is 8/5, C:D is 35/24, D:E is 11/7 etc, so the parts<br/>&gt; are at varied intervals and chords at the points of rest where they<br/>&gt; come together, so that they aren&grave;t all the same, at octaves (and<br/>&gt; don&grave;t have to be &quot;consonances&quot; just because one is resting at them).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, lots of other things I explore, like arpeggios in the scale<br/>&gt; that ascend and descend in different ways. Here, one could<br/>&gt; ascend by 0 1 3 and descend by 0 2 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it is:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/elevenlimitpentatonic">http://www.mp3.com.au/elevenlimitpentatonic</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So basically it is a very simple idea. It&apos;s not an attempt to<br/>&gt; make music following traditional rules of harmony at all, but<br/>&gt; making something new that will work with a fractal<br/>&gt; tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW what makes it fractal is that each part plays the same tune<br/>&gt; as all the others, with varied speed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The musical seed gets transformed as it moves up and down in the scale,<br/>&gt; but the same thing is happening in all the parts, so they still all<br/>&gt; play the same tune - the same notes, at varied speeds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This corresponds to visual<br/>&gt; fractals that look the same at all scales - the fractal tunes<br/>&gt; sound the same at all speeds (if one had parts to play for each<br/>&gt; of the layers of ornamentation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are various notions of fractal, ones that are exactly the<br/>&gt; sane at every level, like FTS, or ones that have similar<br/>&gt; structures at every level, but not identical - the<br/>&gt; word fractal is a general neame for a field of study<br/>&gt; rather than a precise mathematical term as such, though<br/>&gt; terms like fractal dimension etc. have been given precise<br/>&gt; mathematical definitions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are lots of fractal music programs, however I wonder if<br/>&gt; FTS is unique so far in using _exactly_ similar fractals to make<br/>&gt; music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s for the basic form of the fractal tune idea. The later<br/>&gt; transformations and remappings and fractal rhythms and polyrhythms<br/>&gt; make fractal tunes that are no longer exactly self similar,<br/>&gt; however, they are still based on the same passing notes idea<br/>&gt; for harmony / counterpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be interested to know what other techniques are used for<br/>&gt; harmony / counterpoint in fractal tunes. Do<br/>&gt; interesting harmonic structures arise naturally from, say,<br/>&gt; the structure of the mandelbrot set or whatever?<br/>&gt; Or, does the counterpoint need to be added in in some way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When composing / improvising, I may to some extent use the passing<br/>&gt; notes idea, - I think I do while improvising.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Idea is that you let your &quot;mistakes&quot; flow into the piece,<br/>&gt; so that you treat them as passing notes, and a source<br/>&gt; for inspiration and invention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I like passing from less to more chromaticism and<br/>&gt; back again while improvising. Result is that one<br/>&gt; treats the accidentals as passing notes rather than<br/>&gt; changes of key, so that is also like some of the fractal<br/>&gt; tunes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Others, I do do kind of key changes, e.g. if yu have<br/>&gt; an ordinary type scale, but then make it a non ascending one<br/>&gt; that goes up to the 2/1, then down to the 3/2 for the repeat<br/>&gt; you will go up one key in the circle of fifths whenever you<br/>&gt; go past the end of the repeat of the scale, and down one<br/>&gt; when you come back again. &quot;Familiar territory&quot; does this<br/>&gt; - no mp3 yet, but its on the real audio page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I love surprises and enjoying being shown that i was<br/>wrong.<br/>    There is a record store in pasadena i sometimes go by on friday nights<br/>where this young self educated composer works . He just loves the old masters<br/>and since on one of these lists, it was mentioned how there has been<br/>recordings of Beethoven on period instruments, i thought i would ask him about<br/>them. Boy! Did i push a button!<br/>He went into this big thing how the interpretations were shit and had none of<br/>the spirit that the recording he happen to have on. He thought they were<br/>hiding from their lack of being able to raise to what the music demanded and<br/>thought they were chopping it down to there level or lack of vision. He<br/>pointed out , how just listening to the music, it calls to be big and he would<br/>have used a bigger orchestra if he had a chance. I really agreed with the<br/>examples he brought up as they came up on the stereo. He felt that once the<br/>composer is dead , the piece should have a life of its own.<br/>    Now in most cultures this is exactly how the music is, it goes into the<br/>village and either dies or lives and while living changes. While copyrights<br/>protect artists from exploitation by those who can perhaps it is good to see<br/>so much music escape the lawsuits when so often we hear the same songs over<br/>and over again.<br/>    As someone who has had to bear and watched other have to bear horrible<br/>renditions of there music , it was good to be reminded of the other side of<br/>the coin from my own.<br/>The true spirit behind any work of music, a pure magical entity which can<br/>carry this spirit free from and sometimes despite its creator, goes<br/>unrecognized as valid. Instead we are left with &quot;objects&quot; with even music<br/>becoming an object to preserve without any regard for what the spirit behind<br/>it is. these &quot;dreamers&quot; that remain.</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.
