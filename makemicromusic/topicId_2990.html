So it is not an atifact I am hearing. Turning the mp3<br/>player down did indeed help.</p><p>Catharsis Wrote:<br/>&lt;Yes. Probably a mix fix.. Keep it coming... the mix is a little dry<br/>and<br/>the part that comes in at 1:34 is jarring like a bunch Goblins.&gt;</p><p>Yep, once I get my amp made I will concentrate on this. Devote<br/>more tim to mastering that is.  I tend not to use many<br/>affects/reverb if any. Perhaps it is time to have a play in that<br/>arena.</p><p>Justin</p></div><h3>justintonation &#x3C;JUSTINTONATION@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2002 6:42:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;justintonation&quot;<br/>&lt;JUSTINTONATION@H...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was just listening back to  the mp3 of my latest piece and<br/>heard<br/>&gt; &gt; some audio artifacts that were not meant to be there.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I do not know whether it is a problem with my headphones<br/>&gt; &gt; [unfortunately I d not have an amplifier at the moment] or is<br/>&gt; &gt; actually recorded on the mp3.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Did anyone else hear any crackly sounds that sounded like<br/>they<br/>&gt; &gt; should not be there?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Justin</p><p>&gt; Justin,</p><p>&gt; Really enjoyed your tune! Was that done with FM perhaps?</p><p>Thanks! There were some FM timbres which were made in The<br/>FM section of Metasynth. I used Metasynth to create all the<br/>parts/sounds and then just multi tracked them into an<br/>arrangement. There is a lot of use of sine waves and harmonics<br/>of melodic lines. Perhaps that is what you are hearing? I know<br/>FM can sound very bright and that is a type of sound I like.</p><p>&gt; On the disortion thing, I might suggest that when you normalize<br/>your<br/>&gt; tracks, don&apos;t normalize to 0 dBs, but rather to something like -.3<br/>&gt; dBs. This will help to avoid digital distortion, which is the most<br/>&gt; unforgiving kind I know. Just a few samples above 0 dBs in a<br/>digital<br/>&gt; file will cause audible distortion, where in an analog recording,<br/>one<br/>&gt; can drive it &apos;into the red&apos; and it still sounds good - almost like a<br/>&gt; natural kind of compression.</p><p>Thanks for the advise Jacky. I am very new to this. But I have<br/>noticed this on all the tracks I have made so far. It always seems<br/>to be more apparent when I bounce to MP3 than when I am<br/>working in audio .</p><p>&gt; J:L</p></div>
