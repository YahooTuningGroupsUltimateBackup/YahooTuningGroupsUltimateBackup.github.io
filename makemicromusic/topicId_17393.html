It was<br/>written as a demonstration of some of the features of the &lt;Qt&gt; robot<br/>and hence, makes full use ot its unlimited polyphony and its very<br/>precize tuning in equal temperament quartertones. The piece is in 12<br/>autonomous voices and starts with random distributions of pitches<br/>covering the entire &lt;Qt&gt; ambitus. Gradualy the distributions gain<br/>orientation towards complex spectral models of real very thick strings<br/>with physical properties changing over time. The polymetric structure,<br/>in nature based on irrational metric proportions, is entirely derived<br/>from the pitch organisation of the material and its composed changes<br/>over time. The composition makes use of the possibilities to modulate<br/>the wind pressure in the windchests of the organ.</p><p>...</p><p>boy does it get piercing for a bit there! neat though. what&apos;s cool is<br/>they give you enough information on the &lt;Qt&gt; webpage that you can<br/>write your own midi file for the instrument, flashing lights and all;<br/>a midi of this piece says to be available shortly.</p><p>jacob</p></div>
