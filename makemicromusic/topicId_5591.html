Their gesture<br/>tools also invite musical applications! I was under the<br/>impression they had already released an SDK, or were<br/>about to.</p><p>Rightio.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/07/10/0220214.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/01/07/10/0220214.shtml</a></p><p>&gt; The /. crowd are usually nitwits.</p><p>Well indeed, you take a lot of it with a grain of salt and<br/>didn&apos;t mean to suggest I accept the general tone for<br/>that page. But they also come up with things that one<br/>wouldn&apos;t perhaps think of, like a brain storming session.</p><p>I think probably that if I can&apos;t feel<br/>the position of the keys it might rule it out for me.<br/>But who knows. I&apos;d like to try it out too and see<br/>if somehow one can adjust and learn to feel where they<br/>are. That is relevant for musical device too of course.<br/>Thinking it over more I think perhaps one might be able<br/>to learn and adjust after a learning period...</p><p>Did you read the bit about how it works<br/>- it actually takes a video of the hand as it approaches<br/>the pad to type the notes and then processes that<br/>video in order to find out what key you pressed.<br/>So if one could get into that processing at a<br/>reasonably low level then one could do just about<br/>anything I suppose. Nice idea :-).</p><p>A lot for a keyboard and mouse perhaps,<br/>but not so much for a midi input device :-).</p><p>According to the web site they haven&apos;t released the<br/>SDK yet. Anyway I wouldn&apos;t be ready to buy it yet.</p><p>Yes this is for my p.c. which needs a separate keyboard.</p><p>Whenever I need to upgrade though<br/>maybe at the end of next year or so, then I may get<br/>a notepad. Prices going down all the time and capabilities<br/>going up and battery life getting longer...<br/>I&apos;m very attracted by the idea that one could<br/>take a notepad anywhere and add a microphone and<br/>double it up as a portable field recording studio.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 1:41:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Thinking it over more I think perhaps one might be able<br/>&gt;to learn and adjust after a learning period...</p><p>That&apos;s what they claim.</p><p>&gt;Did you read the bit about how it works<br/>&gt;- it actually takes a video of the hand as it approaches<br/>&gt;the pad to type the notes and then processes that<br/>&gt;video in order to find out what key you pressed.<br/>&gt;So if one could get into that processing at a<br/>&gt;reasonably low level then one could do just about<br/>&gt;anything I suppose.

Yes they call them notebooks here too.</p><p>Yes makes sense to make everything one can external including the cd or dvd<br/>drive because anything you always carry around adds to the noise and the<br/>weight doesn&apos;t it. Yes one drawback is that most of them don&apos;t seem<br/>to let you install a soundcard do they, and I certainly want to have<br/>midi in and out for one thing. But perhaps nowadays with USB soundcards<br/>that isn&apos;t a problem so much. Maybe if one wanted a particular<br/>high end sound card, e.g. silent and 24-bit or some such...</p><p>What do you do about sound cards for you notebook? Does it<br/>have on board midi in or do you use an external sound card<br/>or what?</p><p>BTW sorry about pasting a url as the subject line. It was quite interesting<br/>actually. so here it is in the body:</p><p><a href="http://www.footmouse.com">http://www.footmouse.com</a></p><p>A mouse controlled by the foot in addition to the hand mouse.<br/>I can imagine that being useful for music sometimes when you<br/>want to play with both hands and at the same time you want<br/>to twiddle some settings on a music program - you could<br/>just use your feet to do it :-). One foot to do the mouse<br/>movement and one for the mouse clicks so it seems. And<br/>it doesn&apos;t cost that much.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 3:57:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Yes makes sense to make everything one can external including the cd<br/>&gt;or dvd drive because anything you always carry around adds to the noise<br/>&gt;and the weight doesn&apos;t it.</p><p>Yes.  And another secret is to get a gig or more of RAM and turn off<br/>paging.  Then set your hard drive to spin down after 1 min.  The result<br/>is a silent PC with 25-33% more battery life and prolonged hard drive<br/>life/reliability (because you&apos;re not running it as much, and you&apos;re<br/>protecting it from shocks while it&apos;s running).</p><p>&gt;Yes one drawback is that most of them don&apos;t seem<br/>&gt;to let you install a soundcard do they,</p><p>Laptops come with onboard soundcards.  My thinkpad has a very popular<br/>one, the Crystal Soundfusion which provides the basic SoundBlaster<br/>compatible stuff.  Then get something like this for MIDI and good<br/>quality recording...</p><p><a href="http://www.tascam.com/product_info.php?pid=253&nav=computer_recording">http://www.tascam.com/product_info.php?pid=253&nav=computer_recording</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
