Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2004 11:55:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[...as I compose this message, I am listening to a new recording of live music by Kraig Grady and his ensemble. It gives me hope...]</p><p>Dear List,</p><p>All things must pass.</p><p>That pretty well sums it up. It is sobering to me that, as of tomorrow, MMM will have been in existence for 3 years. Sobering in that it doesn&apos;t seem that long, that I didn&apos;t (at times) expect it to last, and that I consider it a good run.</p><p>So, along with that, I am announcing that MMM will be going into hibernation on Sunday, August 1, 2004. On that day, posting to MMM will cease, and the forum will be here on the Yahoo Groups site for an undetermined period of time, open for public viewing and using as a resource, but frozen at that point in terms of any new input.</p><p>Why?</p><p>MMM has ceased to be the place we wanted it to be, and the amount of energy (of all sorts) that has been directed to the situation hasn&apos;t really helped. I&apos;ve thought long and hard about this, and consulted with other people who helped launch this site/forum, and my/our opinion is that we made a place where some good things occurred, and we&apos;re going to be content with that.</p><p>The online microtonal world is pretty strange. The overriding point, the prime purpose in starting MMM was to have a real alternative to venues that didn&apos;t seem to be actively interested in the process and results of making music. It just seemed like a foreign endeavor, an implementation detail. A number of us were frustrated by that, and wanted a little patch of the ether of 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s that was friendly and conducive to this kind of activity. I had hopes that, at the very least, the people that would join would share that focus, and at the very most it would grow into an active, supportive, and thriving musical community.</p><p>Ah, hell, one of my students recently called me &quot;the eternal optimist&quot;!</p><p>I&apos;m not angry about any of this, or bitter, maybe just a little sad. But I have reached a point where what MMM has gradually evolved into is not what it was intended to be, and it seems like a good time for all - me especially - to move on. Nothing here to see, folks. Just an accident.</p><p>This can, and will, play out pretty placidly:</p><p>1. During the next two weeks, I urge all of you to save any of the files that may be stored on the MMM groups site. I also urge any of you to make sure you&apos;ve got contacts for other members that you would like to keep in touch with (I&apos;m sure everyone knows how to get in touch with me by now...).</p><p>2. As I said, on 8/1 I&apos;ll flip a switch and posting will be off. The archives will still be online, available to all. I have no reason to change that at any point in the future.</p><p>3. It may very well be that one or more of you would like to start your own microtonal discussion group (which you could have done at anytime, anyway!), and if you have the desire and energy, I say go for it. I simply ask this: do not call it Making Microtonal Music or MMM. I won&apos;t make any attempt to see that enforced, mind you, I would simply ask that you respect this one request of mine.</p><p>4. For the time being I will be keeping <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>, there are future plans for that, but only time will tell.</p><p>*****</p><p>I guess that&apos;s it. There may be some discussion over the coming days, so I&apos;ll be happy (within the bounds of my real-world constraints on time) to answer any questions. There have been some real fun times here, I believe that valuable info has been shared, and I&apos;ve grown to know and respect a great number of our members. I&apos;m a little chagrined that this comes at a time of our highest membership, but I&apos;m also aware that old email addresses to pile up, so I think we&apos;ve been in a holding pattern for a while.</p><p>Lastly, and most importantly, I hope that each and every one of you will take an opportunity to step back from the typing and revisit your musical world. I know that is what I am going to be doing. I&apos;d like nothing better than to think that shuttering another time-sucker like MMM might give rise to a number of little gems, a sprinkling of new pieces that delight the ear and open the heart.</p><p>I was watching an interview with the composer of music for the film &quot;Frida&quot; the other night, and he had a great phrase for describing music that got to him the most: he said it always shared the qualities of being &quot;fresh and inevitable&quot;. We could have that in spades! Music that has elements that no one else explores, yet developed with such care, craft, charisma, or plain old fucking good luck, that it seems undeniable. That it appears inevitable.</p><p>I think it is possible. It wasn&apos;t for this moment, but I believe it can be. Let&apos;s go there.</p><p>Yours in music and life,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2004 12:26:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;So, along with that, I am announcing that MMM will be going into<br/>&gt;hibernation on Sunday, August 1, 2004.</p><p>Wow, I *just* posted the weekly tuning award to the big list.<br/>I wrote it last week with all the other awards for the next<br/>month or so.</p><p>&gt;This can, and will, play out pretty placidly:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.

I<br/>would, in the spirit of Jon&apos;s quest with the formation of MMM, like to keep<br/>the *practical* aspects in the foreground. This means extended posts about<br/>the theory of comma pumps, vals, etc. should go to tuning. The goal here is<br/>music making and the encouragement of it. It&apos;s hard enough to get away from<br/>the addiction of mailing list itself to sit down and write some music. Adding<br/>theory (which can be purely interesting by itself) to the mix only makes it<br/>harder to produce the next &apos;opus&apos;.</p><p>Civility should be strictly observed, but will not be enforced, outside of a<br/>public/private warning that private disputes be taken elsewhere. Musical<br/>examples (mp3&apos;s, midi files) should be the common occurence, and a sign that<br/>the group is healthy, doing it&apos;s thing.</p><p>Anyone want to co-moderate? ;)</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

Since I feel intimately tied to MMM, that doesn&apos;t feel good.</p><p>If the list is simply the collection of email contacts and related postings that come and go on an occasional basis, then someone can simply start another list, call it their own, and people can continue.

(For me, Kleiber was the best conductor of his generation, and often the only one for whom quality music making was more important than all else).</p><p>As you know well, I quit the main list a long time ago out of extreme frustration.  Far too often, I&apos;d practically sweat blood over a message to make sure that it was as accurate and temperate as I could make it, only to find out that my efforts were never enough. I had come to reconcile myself to the fact that -- for whatever reason -- no matter what I wrote, a Reinhard or a MacLaren would scream in disagreement.  But I could not reconcile myself to the coterminous fact that their disagreements, especially those based on the most simple misunderstandings, would be imbedded in the eternity of the internet.</p><p>I did, however, renew some old friendships (Chalmers, Grady) and gain some wonderful new colleagues (among them John Clough, Jonathan Walker, yourself)  on the tuning list, and the off-list discussions were among the best -- and often funniest -- correspondance I&apos;ve encountered.  You, Jon, in particular, have always given good back channel -- a few words of encouragement, or an extended pun, or just good taste in Malts...  Joining your list has been a refreshing re-taste of those good times.  I do regret your decision to quit, but respect it, knowing that it&apos;s often best to quit while the quitting&apos;s good and not to keep doing something once it&apos;s stopped being fun.  MMM is your creation, and you have the luxury to make the end of the list into an aesthetic decision, so do it when it seems done to you.</p><p>I don&apos;t like the idea of moving to Google. The highest virtue, methinks, of Yahoo! is its very incompetence, and all I&apos;ve heard about the combined intrusiveness and competence of Google has given me pause before a leap into Ms. G&apos;s arms.  I&apos;d really prefer to find a quasi-academic home (like the original Mills server) where we could continue on with a minimum of bureaucratic attention or commercial interruption, but have a feeling that the tuning community, like Candide, has left our garden home behind forever, and now, somewhere between Westphalia and El Dorado, will just have to make do. So maybe it&apos;s time to return to the ranch, the big tuning list.
