A 12 yr-old did this? Yikes.</p><p>&gt;Runs in any browser or with Flash Player. Enjoy!</p><p>Yep, no problems on the latest FireFox.</p><p>&gt;Criticisms, suggestions welcomed</p><p>Not really a criticism - I thought maybe the design was reallly big, as it seemed like some of the stuff was getting cut off (tops of heads, etc) but resizing the window showed that is just the border of the images. Just a mention.</p><p>Too long for a splash page, but quite fun...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
