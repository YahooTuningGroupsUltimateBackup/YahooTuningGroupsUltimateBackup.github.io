I think I&apos;m<br/>starting to &quot;get a grip...&quot;</p><p>Ahh... Digital Audio Workstations... DAW (unlike UAW... work<br/>stoppage...)  got it...</p><p>You&apos;re right about this guy and his Vienna *samples...*  That&apos;s<br/>really not something I need.  I work with Sibelius and *real*<br/>instruments when I want to do that.</p><p>What I&apos;m looking for, as I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve garnered... is a softsynth<br/>setup to do, specifically, microtonal work, and it needn&apos;t sound like<br/>sampled instruments.  In fact, it would be better if it *didn&apos;t!*</p><p>Glad to hear I could run the synths and the DAWs like Cubase on one<br/>machine with no problems...</p><p>And, YES, I *am* going according to your suggestions.  In fact, there<br/>is the entire *manual* of Cubase in .pdf format and I certainly plan<br/>to go through it, or try to go through it before I purchase the<br/>software...</p><p>Thanks!!!!</p><p>JP</p></div>
