Not only the music, but the background computer<br/>&gt; construction and the esthetic discussion.  Lots of stuff here, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; for sure.</p><p>Thanks for looking &amp; listening!!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had some questions, personally, about some of the ideas<br/>&gt; of &quot;flatness&quot; since I don&apos;t feel that Xenakis and Ferneyhough are<br/>&gt; really &quot;flat...&quot;  Boulez and Babbitt I can see, as well as Cage.</p><p>Well, it depends on which piece. . .sometimes (as in Cage&apos;s case) on the<br/>particular performance of a given piece.    Some Xenakis is very<br/>&quot;flat&quot;--try Herma or Nomos Alpha---some nice things in there, but very<br/>hard to just listen to all the way through!  (Same with certain pieces of<br/>B. Ferneyhough. . )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And Feldman wasn&apos;t mentioned right off the top.  Don&apos;t they like him<br/>&gt; at Columbia...? [I had to get that joke in...]</p><p>Well, I though I had heard &quot;flat&quot; used by Feldman, but when I looked<br/>around, I couldn&apos;t find the reference.   Besides, both his music, and the<br/>art of Rothko, with which it is associated, I don&apos;t find to be flat,<br/>simply because it&apos;s &quot;slow&quot; enough that it doesn&apos;t &quot;lose&quot; you.<br/>(See the part called &quot;Towards a Formal Definition of Flatness&quot; near the<br/>end of Chapter One of the paper.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, the piece really changes a lot.  Sometimes it really *does*<br/>&gt; sound like Cage, other times like minimalism...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The samples really sound great and listening in a &quot;micro&quot; way, as you<br/>&gt; recommend, seems quite rewarding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping to listen to the entire soon, but I gave it a pretty<br/>&gt; good &quot;sample&quot; at the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice to know this is all in 19-tET, too...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Congrats to you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4056">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4056</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/dissert.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/dissert.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     This is a new piece I wrote over a period of about a year.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2003 2:20:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4089">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4089</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I though I had heard &quot;flat&quot; used by Feldman, but when I looked<br/>&gt; around, I couldn&apos;t find the reference.

I<br/>thought you were associating it with &quot;micro form&quot;... or at least it<br/>seemed so in your essay with its colorful paintings.</p><p>In that sense a piece such as Cage&apos;s _Concerto for Prepared Piano and<br/>Orchestra_ would be a &quot;flat&quot; piece, or one where one has to listen to<br/>moment by moment.</p><p>HOWEVER, that certainly doesn&apos;t mean the piece is not of interest to<br/>the listener if you listen in such a &quot;micro&quot; way.   Similarly, it<br/>seems your *own* music uses the same kind of paradigm... it doesn&apos;t<br/>have a discernable overall *macro* form, at least not in quite a bit<br/>of the recent work, but the *micro* form is *very* interesting, since<br/>the samples are so good.</p><p>I felt the same way about the Cage concerto.  I heard it performed in<br/>New York brilliantly by Dennis Russell Davies.  The trick is to make<br/>*every* sound a brilliant moment, every instant.  So, in *my*<br/>opinion, the quality of such a piece can vary *greatly* depending on<br/>the interpretation.  Of course Cage would disagree with this view, at<br/>least according to his doctrinaire philosophy...</p><p>From what I have heard, it seems some of your *earlier* work was more<br/>like Feldman in its sustained pitches and slow motion, but you seem<br/>to be going now in a *different* direction, possibly as a response to<br/>the use of the computer and samples as a creative tool...</p><p>Still, I don&apos;t believe an &quot;inability to follow or get through&quot; or any<br/>such should be a part of your &quot;flatness&quot; paradigm.</p><p>That&apos;s just an indication of *bad music* regardless of the style!</p><p>J.
