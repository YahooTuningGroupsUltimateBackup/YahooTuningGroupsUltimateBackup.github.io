The only oddity in the one John says is the 12/11 step.</p><p>One could argue that 10/9 is not xentonal at all, and I would agree. However,<br/>it is not often used as a tonic to 2nd degree step, but as a 2nd to 3rd<br/>degree step, as in (1/1, 9/8, 5/4), where it occurs between 9/8 and 5/4....</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div>
