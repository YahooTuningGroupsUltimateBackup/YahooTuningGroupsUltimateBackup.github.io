What _Xentonality_ demonstrates in most creative ways is<br/>that tuning/timbre matching can not only generate some interestingly<br/>consonant intervals; it can serve as a basic for beautiful music.</p><p>Of course, as Bill himself would emphasize, this isn&apos;t the first such<br/>demonstration, and the principle manifests itself in various world<br/>musics: but as Aaron Johnson has aptly written, _Xentonality_ is<br/>indeed a collection of &quot;etudes&quot; in the science and art of harmonizing<br/>tuning and timbre (or vice versa).</p><p>Indeed, in my own idiomatic vocabulary, _Sethareanize_ has become a<br/>very useful verb, meaning basically &quot;to experiment with timbre and<br/>tuning, or to make music based on such experimenting.&quot; Likewise,<br/>_Sethareanization_ means the process of &quot;well-timbrement,&quot; or<br/>according tuning and timbre. Of course, one might also name such a<br/>practice after the masterful builders of African xylophones, or<br/>Javanese or Balinese gamelan instruments, or such xenharmonicists as<br/>Ivor Darreg, John Chowning, and Wendy Carlos; but my usage might<br/>reflect Bill&apos;s role as an explicator and exemplar of this process.</p><p>What I can definitely say is that &quot;Sethareanization&quot; is a contagious<br/>exercise: I&apos;m writing this after having devised a tuning/timbre<br/>combination for a new (to me) temperament, and am writing in the<br/>afterglow of an exhilarating process. Part of the fun of listening to<br/>_Xentonality_ is the element of empathy: &quot;How might I, or have I,<br/>approached this same tuning?&quot;</p><p>Here I&apos;ll seek to complement Aaron&apos;s fine review by addressing a few<br/>tracks of special interest to me in a CD album where every piece<br/>offers inspiration to listeners and musicmakers alike.</p><p>How could I resist a gorgeous piece like _Seventeen Strings_, given my<br/>love for quintal/quartal harmony (chords built with fifths or<br/>fourths)? Here Bill has taken a beautiful harp texture and customized<br/>the timbre to 17-tET. While I might guess that the timbral adjustment<br/>was done in part to get &quot;smoother&quot; or less tense thirds, I might ask<br/>whether the fifths and fourths (about 3.93 cents respectively wide and<br/>narrow of a pure 3:2 or 4:3) were also made to seem closer to just, as<br/>for example in a Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Whatever Bill has done in technical terms, those arpeggiated<br/>sonorities in fifth and fourths are really beautiful, and the portions<br/>with more emphasis on thirds indeed have a &quot;smooth and pleasant&quot;<br/>quality, a judgment which I might guess a listener less accustomed to<br/>the rather active or &quot;beatful&quot; thirds and sixths in this portion of<br/>the spectrum -- when played in typical harmonic timbres -- might<br/>share.</p><p>By the way, a tuning like 17-tET can also illustrate how the nuances<br/>of &quot;Sethareanization&quot; may vary according to style. The major third in<br/>this temperament, at about 423.53 cents, seems near the point of<br/>maximum complexity or tension between the simple ratios of 5:4<br/>(~386.31 cents) and 9:7 (~435.08 cents), so that in many timbres the<br/>effect can sound decidedly &quot;dissonant.&quot; In a medieval or neo-medieval<br/>European style where thirds and sixths are active and unstable, a bit<br/>of discretion in choosing a timbre can help to achieve the desired<br/>effect of &quot;imperfect&quot; or _partial_ concord.</p><p>However, as _Xentonality_ shows, it&apos;s also possible to adapt 17-tET to<br/>styles where thirds and sixths are fully concordant, and moreover to<br/>do so in a delightfully rich texture based on an artfully modified<br/>Celtic harp sample.</p><p>A characteristically urbane side of Bill&apos;s music comes out in _Unlucky<br/>Flutes_, which I might describe as a kind of jazz ensemble piece in<br/>13-tET -- or, at least, I find the style somehow &quot;jazzy,&quot; an adjective<br/>I also apply to some of my favorite 14th-century music. Here, as in<br/>much jazz, the melody is a big attraction, and the &quot;bass&quot; line adds to<br/>the charm.</p><p>As stated in the notes: &quot;All instruments clearly retain their tonal<br/>identity, yet sound harmonious even on sustained passages.&quot; As someone<br/>who has borrowed and designed some timbres for 13-tET on the Yahama<br/>TX-802 FM synthesizer, I can say that meeting both parts of that<br/>statement at the same time -- getting a &quot;harmonious&quot; sound with a<br/>mixed ensemble of &quot;flutes, guitars, bass, and keyboard&quot; -- is indeed<br/>impressive. My own more technically modest approach has been simply to<br/>borrow or concoct a texture or two that to my ears make the interval<br/>of 8/13 octave (about 738.46 cents) sound like a reasonably persuasive<br/>and concordant &quot;fifth,&quot; and go from there.</p><p>The result of Bill&apos;s technical achievement is something that reminds<br/>me of a jazz ensemble from around the 1960&apos;s: witty, cultured, and<br/>musically most engaging.</p><p>As it happens, two pieces on this CD tie in with one of my first<br/>introductions to Bill Sethares and his timbre/tuning creations:<br/>hearing some of the customized electronic &quot;instruments&quot; he designed<br/>for Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-cET or &quot;88-cent equal temperament&quot; on a<br/>cassette which Morrison kindly sent me offering a kind of guided tour<br/>of this tuning. I recall that Bill designed a &quot;bagpipes&quot; timbre, for<br/>example, fit to one of the possible quasi-octave intervals of this<br/>tuning, either 1144 cents or 1232 cents.</p><p>_Haroun in 88_ has a flavor I again find &quot;jazzy,&quot; and I might say<br/>&quot;upbeat,&quot; with nice counterpoint. There&apos;s a richness to the harmony<br/>and texture which _might_ reflect the stretched-octave tuning, but<br/>also more generally the thematic interchange and interplay between the<br/>voices, something effective in lots of tuning systems and styles. If<br/>asked to propose an ostentatiously &quot;88-cET&quot; scenario, I might suggest<br/>some gamelan-like texture with an accent on shimmering 1232-cent<br/>quasi-octaves. This seems to me rather more subtle, with an affability<br/>and refinement that might suggest jazz or Blues.</p><p>Also in 88-cET, the companion piece _88 Vibes_ has indeed what I might<br/>call a &quot;vibrant&quot; quality, using a spectrally mapped &quot;vibraphone&quot;<br/>timbre. As I wrote in my notes, this piece has a &quot;brightness and<br/>mystery&quot; about it; there are some effects like glissando sweeps to<br/>catch the ear, and a lyrical theme with a chord progression I&apos;m almost<br/>tempted to compare to a hypothetical version in minor of the Beatles&apos;<br/>_Let it Be_. Possibly this last comparison might give caution about my<br/>opinions concerning a wide range of post-1400 music, but the<br/>impression of something &quot;different, and yet not that unfamiliar&quot; is<br/>worth noting.</p><p>Now we come to the other piece I&apos;m reviewing here, and which has given<br/>me cause for a bit of cursory Web research on the sociocultural<br/>background: _The Turquoise Dabo Girl_ in 11-tET. My first association<br/>on seeing this title around the time I was first getting in touch with<br/>Bill Sethares on the Internet was with the Latin phrase _Ibi dabo<br/>tibi_ (&quot;There I will give you...&quot;) from the motet _Quam pulchra es_ by<br/>the English composer John Dunstable (c. 1370?-1453).</p><p>A Dabo girl, as it turns out, is a woman in the science fiction series<br/>_Deep Space Nine_ who operates the wheel for a game of chance called<br/>Dabo, apparently some futuristic variant of roulette.[1] It&apos;s not an<br/>especially high-status position to occupy, and the main role<br/>expectation is to attract and hold the interest of as many gambling<br/>customers as possible, using just about any alluring means to do so.</p><p>However, the role of Dabo girl does not necessarily define the woman<br/>(from whatever solar system) playing it: &quot;today a Dabo girl, tomorrow<br/>the leader of an interplanetary liberation movement.&quot;</p><p>Approaching the piece from this perspective, I might hear in _The<br/>Turquoise Dabo Girl_ both the exotic and alluring atmosphere of a<br/>_Deep Space Nine_ casino, and the inner character and strength of a<br/>person who finds herself in the role of a Dabo girl, but has lots of<br/>things to express beyond that role.</p><p>The opening portion might accentuate more the &quot;exotic&quot; theme: I found<br/>it &quot;a bit &grave;brooding,&apos; but not necessarily unfriendly.&quot; One comparison<br/>evoked my childhood: how about using this as a neat theme in the late<br/>1950&apos;s or early 1960&apos;s for a mystery series on television, or a movie,<br/>about some sophisticated investigators, like _The Thin Man_ or _The<br/>Pink Panther_?</p><p>Then things get more lyrically, I might say yearningly, concordant --<br/>not that the previous effect was &quot;dissonant.&quot; Paul Erlich once<br/>concluded, if I recall correctly, and my own experiments with 11-tET<br/>seem to confirm, that this harmonic sweetness results in part from the<br/>use of a sonority like 0-6-9-13 steps or about 0-655-983-1418 cents.<br/>The effect, like that of a just 4:6:7:9 (~0-702-969-1404 cents) or<br/>some closer tempered approximation, is a resonant and intriguingly<br/>complex concord. As Paul Erlich has noted, having a multi-voice chord<br/>fitting this kind of pattern can compensate for inaccuracies in the<br/>tuning of individual intervals, like the 11-tET fifth -- at around 655<br/>cents, some 47 cents narrow of a just 3:2, and inviting the more<br/>likely description of a large tritone (e.g. 16:11, around 649 cents).</p><p>In more conventional terms, 0-6-9-13 steps could be described as a<br/>very narrow fifth, small minor seventh, and rather wide major ninth;<br/>in Bill&apos;s spectrally mapped &quot;instrumentation,&quot; this can convey a<br/>&quot;minor seventh&quot; flavor fitting with an aura of &quot;cool&quot; and<br/>sophisticated harmony a la the 1950&apos;s or 1960&apos;s.</p><p>One question which Bill himself asks in his notes about a &quot;pan flute&quot;<br/>melody harmonized in the &quot;chorus&quot; of the piece: &quot;Does this have the<br/>feeling of some kind of (perhaps unfamiliar) &grave;cadence&apos; as the melody<br/>resolves back to its &grave;tonic&apos;?&quot;</p><p>My own answer would be &quot;Yes, and rather like a remissive or Phrygian<br/>cadence; at least, I pick up the ascending &grave;whole-tone&apos; motion in one<br/>or some of the upper voices (by a 2-step interval of around 218 cents,<br/>I&apos;d guess), and this suggests to me an effect like descending motion<br/>in some other voice by a &grave;semitone&apos; of one step, or around 109 cents.&quot;</p><p>As I might cheerfully conclude by cautioning again, Sethareanizing can<br/>be a highly contagious participant sport, and these consummate etudes,<br/>as Aaron has well described them, provide an incentive and inspiration<br/>for others of us who seek to emulate his most subtle art.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. While I tend to regard my free association of &quot;Dabo girl&quot; with<br/>Dunstable&apos;s setting of the words _Ibi dabo tibi_ as fortuitous, one<br/>unofficial explanation of the name &quot;Dabo&quot; indeed derives it from the Latin<br/>_dabo_, &quot;I shall give&quot; -- as in an advertisement of sorts: &quot;Look at the<br/>prizes we&apos;re giving out if you pick the right number!&quot;  Another unofficial<br/>derivation is from a proper name. I&apos;m not sure if the creators of _Deep<br/>Space Nine_ have spoken to this question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6606 href="#6606">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2004 5:03:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Indeed, in my own idiomatic vocabulary, _Sethareanize_ has become a<br/>&gt; very useful verb, meaning basically &quot;to experiment with timbre and<br/>&gt; tuning, or to make music based on such experimenting.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve used it as a verb also, but I meant &quot;shifting the partial tones<br/>of a timbre to correspond with the tuning of a temperament&quot; or what<br/>you call &quot;well-timbrement&quot; below.</p></div>
