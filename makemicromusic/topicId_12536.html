The man&apos;s a genius, for Pete&apos;s sake!<br/>&gt;After listening to just one of his 19-tone pieces, I was forced to put<br/>&gt;my fingers into a Ronco Dice-A-Matic. I am currently an unpleasant<br/>&gt;shade of Envious Green.</p><p>I think the rhythm of your piece reminded me of the rhythm that<br/>seems to be in all of Bill&apos;s pieces.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
