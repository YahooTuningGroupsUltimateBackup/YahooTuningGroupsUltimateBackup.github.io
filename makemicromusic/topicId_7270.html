It was<br/>originally written for a violin and two cellos, but I don&apos;t have a recording yet.  It&apos;s a set of<br/>variations based on an ancient greak theme (circa 5th or 6th century b.c.e., I believe).  It<br/>uses the enharmonic genera, which means that the fourth is divided roughly into 1/4-<br/>tone, 1/4-tone, major third (although I used pythagorean ratios for this rendering, not<br/>ET).</p><p>I would love your feedback.  It&apos;s a pretty short piece.  It&apos;s in the &quot;files&quot; section of the group<br/>site, in the &quot;Chris Bryan&quot; folder.

Funny you should post this right now: just a couple weeks ago, George Secor passed along his synthesized versions of Partch&apos;s &quot;Two Studies&quot;, which are both built on ancient Greek tunings. (And George did pretty renditions of them, with a couple teeny-tiny caveats). And I&apos;m just finishing post-production on the first volume of a 4 volume reissue of the CRI Partch series to come out on New World Records, so I was listening to the mastering of those two studies in their original recordings. A lot of Greek intonation passing over my eardrums these days.</p><p>You have a very nice piano sound, and I found the rubato and rhythmic aspects of either your playing or composition to have a very fluid feel.

New World Records has taken over their catalog (their mission is identical: keep music of American composers in print and available), and we are simply taking the opportunity to go over them again to make sure everything is as good as possible.
