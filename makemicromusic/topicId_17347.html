And while it isn&apos;t what it was when Harry picked up the inscriptions back in 1940, it is still, to a certain extent, a bit of a crossroads.</p><p>I don&apos;t hesitate to say that I don&apos;t stop when passing though. But if Keenan has some time to kill, a drive out to somewhere beyond Barstow and back, with an eye to removing about 75% of the visual and environmental clutter that is there now, wouldn&apos;t be a total loss. At least get out to a high desert area, pull off the road, and sit by a guardrail. In utter desolation, one might glean some insight.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2007 8:35:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmmm.. Sorry to be off-topic, but what the heck... as long as we&apos;re<br/>comparing armpits... :-)</p><p>&gt; I saw Barstow on a map</p><p>Personally, I&apos;d skip Barstow... Drive on by to quaint little Lone Pine for<br/>lunch. Look up at Mount Whitney. Go into the Alabama hills and look for<br/>the painted face on the rocks near the side of the road. Visit Manzanar.<br/>Swing past what once was Owens Lake, through Helendale and make a<br/>pilgrimage to visit Dixie Evans, last of the great burlesque queens.</p><p>&gt; It would be interesting to hear what other people think, but<br/>&gt; I found Barstow to be the absolute ugliest place I&apos;ve ever<br/>&gt; visited in my life.</p><p>Well, I guess you&apos;ve never been to Aberdeen, Washington. :-( The saddest<br/>town I&apos;ve ever had the misfortune to drive through, and I&apos;ve been to<br/>Barstow, too. Aberdeen is much worse.</p><p>Another unfortunate little town is Ajo, Arizona... as I recall, it had<br/>lots of teeny-tiny homes with sad little gardens and cyclone fences, but<br/>the main &quot;natural&quot; feature is that it is completely surrounded by enormous<br/>mining slag heaps that loom ten times taller than any building in town, and<br/>it sits right on the edge of a vast USAF gunnery range -- on a narrow road<br/>surrounded by some 50 miles of the ugliest hair-raising bomb-cratered<br/>wasteland I&apos;ve ever seen. Can you say Koyaanisqatsi? Definitely worth a<br/>look on the way through if you ever get hoodwinked into making the long<br/>drive to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. (Which is, by the way, worth<br/>seeing.)</p><p>Alabama Hills Painted Face:<br/><a href="http://www.fotosearch.com/UNU130/u12221319/">http://www.fotosearch.com/UNU130/u12221319/</a></p><p>Manzanar:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanar</a></p><p>Dixie Evans:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEDVaLUj5Js">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEDVaLUj5Js</a></p><p>Aberdeen:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen,_Washington">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen,_Washington</a></p><p>Ajo, Arizona<br/><a href="http://www.ajochamber.com/historical.htm">http://www.ajochamber.com/historical.htm</a></p><p>Madras, Oregon<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras,_Oregon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras,_Oregon</a></p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2007 9:16:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/5/07, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hmmm..

And they have<br/>Bill Alves, and I think as well a Microzone/Uath/Wilson<br/>keyboard.  So if I were you, I&apos;d make the trek to play it,<br/>and then report back here.</p><p>I do have a friend at Caltech, who&apos;s interested in<br/>DNA robots and such.

Barstow is just a dusty little<br/>town in the middle of the desert, and it will be unbearably<br/>hot when you&apos;re here (it most likely is already). I doubt<br/>very much if the highway railing which inspired Partch is<br/>even still extant. I drove thru last year hoping to see<br/>something, but pretty much the only value in stopping<br/>there was to sit inside a Jack In The Box for lunch,<br/>to suck up the air-conditioning ... and that was on May 5.</p><p>Much more worthwhile, at least from my point of view,<br/>is to drive 2 hours south to San Diego, to meet me! ;-)</p><p>Also, i can introduce you to Jonathan Glasier and Brink McGoogy,<br/>possibly MMM list-owner Jon Szanto, and maybe Danlee Mitchell.<br/>You could hang out at the Sonic Arts Gallery and create some<br/>microtonal music with the Sonic Arts gang (me, Jonathan,<br/>and Brink). And i can show you where Partch and Ivor Darreg<br/>lived the last years of their lives ... *and* give you a live<br/>demo of Tonescape.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2007 7:32:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot;<br/>&lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I saw Barstow on a map<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LOL, I should never have mentioned it.
