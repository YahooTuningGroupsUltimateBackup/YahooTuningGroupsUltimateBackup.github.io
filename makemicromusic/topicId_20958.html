As for modulations generally, I usually take Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s modulation model as a base - a &quot;neutral&quot; phase with notes that are common in the old and the new key, a &quot;fundamental step&quot; where the old key is left, and a cadence to fix the new key, &quot;cadence&quot; here in a more general meaning as a phrase that uniquely fixes a key, typically a sequence of notes/chords that cannot be played in another key. Of course, when the distance of the keys is high, finding common notes can become difficult...<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
