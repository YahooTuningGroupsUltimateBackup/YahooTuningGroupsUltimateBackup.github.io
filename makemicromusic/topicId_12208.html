The music took them<br/>&gt;   back to the time when they were young.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   There is no way whatsoever that I know of that can duplicate<br/>&gt;   this. It doesn&apos;t depend on the quality of the music, it depends<br/>&gt;   solely on &apos;shared experience&apos;. That is, a particular time in<br/>&gt;   one&apos;s life WITH the experience of a particular music at the<br/>&gt;   same time.</p><p>He was replying to Chris M Bryan, who wrote earlier:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; It may be a minimal audience, but the assumption might be that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all human beings can&apos;t possibly be all *that* different...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In theory, maybe... but in practice, the *vast* majority of<br/>&gt; &gt; listeners, even &quot;educated&quot; ones, are guided by a rigid<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamentalist framework about what is good and what is not,<br/>&gt; &gt; which keeps them from appreciating everything that they<br/>&gt; &gt; otherwise might.  For instance, appreciaters of<br/>&gt; &gt; pop music insist that good music must have a groove, whereas a<br/>&gt; &gt; theorist like Adorno damns the groove as a function of the<br/>&gt; &gt; mind-anaesthizing capitalist machine.  More to the point, lots of<br/>&gt; &gt; people (mostly musicians!) would dismiss microtonal music as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;out-of-tune&quot; rather than let their perception of &quot;in-tuneness&quot; be<br/>&gt; &gt; questioned or altered.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, even if a certain music has qualities that should make it<br/>&gt; &gt; valuable and appreciable by others, it may not be if it falls<br/>&gt; &gt; outside of others&apos; fundamentalist frameworks.  My opinion, then,<br/>&gt; &gt; is that if nobody likes your music, and you do, you&apos;re just going<br/>&gt; &gt; to have to spend the rest of your life convincing a few people<br/>&gt; &gt; that their perceptual framework needs some adjusting. :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (All that is predicated on the assumption that good music has<br/>&gt; &gt; intrinsic value, even if no one appreciates it.  The other<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative, that value is imposed by the observer, is not<br/>&gt; &gt; something that I&apos;m confortable with.  I think the above is<br/>&gt; &gt; relevant to the list, but I&apos;ll stop here...)</p><p>Hi Chris and Stephen,</p><p>Remember the Beatles&apos; &quot;When I&apos;m 64&quot;?
