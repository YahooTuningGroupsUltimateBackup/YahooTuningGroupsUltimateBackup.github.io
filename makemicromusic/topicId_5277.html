I like the VST host I<br/>have a lot (VAZ Modular 2.54), but it would be so nice to be able to get &gt;<br/>16 MIDI channels of input to do really big orchestral stuff. The next VAZ<br/>version might provide that, and if so, it&apos;s a no-brainer to upgrade, since<br/>VAZ also has microtuning, and it&apos;s really stable, and I like the mixing<br/>model quite well. It&apos;s just like a big one-buss console mixer. Totally easy<br/>to operate.</p><p>So I&apos;ve been looking recently at various VST hosts and running some<br/>demos... What I really want doesn&apos;t seem to be available!</p><p>The MIDI standard as we know has 16 channels. If you have more than one<br/>MIDI sound card or multiple MIDI loopbacks (like MIDI OX), you could<br/>theoretically get &gt; 16 channels. Finale can output MIDI data to as many as<br/>8 MIDI drivers (e.g., 8 different sound cards, etc.) Some hosts can take<br/>data from more than one MIDI source... Hmm...</p><p>I&apos;m looking for a VST host that can *input* live MIDI data from more than<br/>one MIDI source at the same time, e,g, MPU401 and/or MIDI OX. I&apos;ve been<br/>checking around at <a href="http://kvr-vst.com">kvr-vst.com</a> and such...</p><p>The host also must have a builtin mixer that can mix &gt;16 stereo channels<br/>at once, and where those &gt;16 stereo channels can all be VSTi soft-synths.</p><p>It should also behave like a &quot;rack&quot;. I don&apos;t really like the<br/>connect-the-dots totally modular approach of some hosts because there are<br/>too many cables to keep connecting all the time.</p><p>There are a couple of hosts that seem like they would (or should) sort of<br/>work, but... The ones I&apos;ve investigated by trying the demos can&apos;t do both<br/>mix &gt;16 channels in a nice way *and* receive &gt;16 channels of MIDI! They&apos;re<br/>all pretty lame.</p><p>The latest Fruityloops, for example, can supposedly mix 48 channels, but<br/>it apparently can&apos;t get MIDI on more than *one* channel! Not even 16<br/>channels! (I couldn&apos;t get it to do anything but play ONE note (low d) in a<br/>soft-synth; no matter what note I played, if it wasn&apos;t low d, no sound came<br/>out!) So, it can&apos;t take input from more than one source, and is thus<br/>useless for connecting to Finale. If Fruityloops could get decent MIDI<br/>input, it would work really well for me, because it has what appears to be<br/>a nice mixer and effects.<br/>There&apos;s an app called &quot;Console&quot; from Art Teknika that can take &gt;16<br/>channels of MIDI input, but it doesn&apos;t have a *mixer* that can mix more<br/>than 4 stereo channels at once. (It uses the freebie CMX844 VST mixer.) If<br/>&quot;Console&quot; had a better mixer, it would be useful enough, as-is, it&apos;s lame.</p><p>The new &quot;Forte&quot; (version 1.2) can take a lot of MIDI input, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>have any mixer. Nothing. It depends on (yuck) channel volume! If Forte had<br/>a mixer, it would be perfect. As-is, it&apos;s lame.</p><p>With Psycle I couldn&apos;t get any sound output at all. Seems totally lame.</p><p>Also Aodix was lame. &quot;Chainer&quot; was lame... Multitrack Studio Lite wouldn&apos;t<br/>even run after installation. Bidule has a lame builtin mixer and crashed<br/>my machine after a few minutes of use... So much for cheap and free hosts!</p><p>My conclusion is that the free or inexpensive hosts are all really lame<br/>and/or buggy. I guess you get what you pay for! (I paid &gt;$275 for VAZ<br/>Modular.) I&apos;m not even going to look at any of the expensive hosts yet,<br/>figuring that they&apos;re  probably lame, too. It seems that anything with a<br/>built-in sequencer (i.e., that tries to be an all-in-one composition &amp;<br/>playback tool) has lame MIDI input capability... Is that right? Should I be<br/>looking at Steinberg?</p><p>Oh, and whatever I buy *cannot* require a dongle. I categorically won&apos;t<br/>run anything that requires a hardware dongle.</p><p>Anyone out there working the way I work, needing just a VST &quot;rack &amp; mixer&quot;<br/>host, and using an external sequencer via MIDI OX or other loopback? What<br/>host are you using? How does it work for you?</p><p>So... after all that kvetching, here is Uncle Rick&apos;s Guide to Cheap and<br/>Free VST Hosts for Windows!! (Format: Host name; can it use &gt; 16 channels<br/>of Midi?; can it mix decently? &quot;DIY&quot; means do it yourself, in other words,<br/>it&apos;s a modular or other environment in which you can probably hack<br/>something together that might work for the task. Was it buggy? &quot;YES&quot; if it<br/>wouldn&apos;t run or crashed.)</p><p>Host           Midi&gt;16?  Mix&gt;16?

If one were to use it for a live performance front-end for a number of softsynths, it would work pretty well. But even there more mixing capability would sure be nice. In my current setup I could set each of the 8 sliders on the Radium kbd to the volume control of an associated synth, and that would work out fine. I think the whole move towards control surfaces and instruments/effects that can &apos;learn&apos; midi input from knobs and sliders is really going to open things up.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not even going to look at any of the expensive hosts yet, figuring &gt;that they&apos;re  probably lame, too.</p><p>Well, c&apos;mon Rick, you gotta try! Seems like if your machine has enough CPU and mem horsepower you owe it to yourself to at least download the demos and see if they work for you.</p><p>&gt;It seems that anything with a built-in sequencer (i.e., that tries to be &gt;an all-in-one composition &amp; playback tool) has lame MIDI input &gt;capability... Is that right? Should I be looking at Steinberg?</p><p>Possibly. Lots of people have used Cubase in it&apos;s varying forms. And while you are using virtual synths, you gotta know that reams of Hollywood composers have been using a lot more than 16 midi channels for a long time.</p><p>&gt;Oh, and whatever I buy *cannot* require a dongle. I categorically won&apos;t &gt;run anything that requires a hardware dongle.</p><p>I saw someone mention that on another list, and I can&apos;t remember the last time I even saw a dongle (that&apos;s what happens when you hit 50, I guess...) It must have been on my Amiga!</p><p>&gt;Anyone out there working the way I work, needing just a VST &quot;rack &amp; mixer&quot; &gt;host, and using an external sequencer via MIDI OX or other loopback? What &gt;host are you using? How does it work for you?</p><p>We&apos;ll keep looking. I sure wish more people would chime in, but I think MMM is still in the semi-dark ages of midi/soft music making. I&apos;ll also call a couple film composers I know to see about their big studio setups.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5300 href="#5300">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2003 1:42:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jonathan M.

I&apos;m not sure if I tried anything new enough to be Sonar, so perhaps that would work.  The old Cakewalk Apprentice that came with my Wave Blaster was fine, but it refuses to work without a soundcard in the Sounblaster 16 line installed, and my system doesn&apos;t like dual soundcards either :(  And it doesn&apos;t do audio.

But although it&apos;s possible to use multiple devices simultaneously, there&apos;s no way I&apos;ve found of labelling which device they came from.  If you set a track to &quot;-&quot; channel, then it remembers which channel things came in on.

So I take it that&apos;s what he means, unless he comes here and says otherwise.  He wants to output them *from* Finale and *into* a VST host.  Cubasis isn&apos;t designed for that, because it expects to be used as the MIDI sequencer.  That&apos;s what it started out as anyway.</p><p>However, as it&apos;s also an audio sequencer, there&apos;d be no problem recording 16 channels at a time, and I&apos;ve verified that 4 track stereo works even on my hardware.  So if you&apos;re working on an orchestral score, you have the equivalent of 64 channels.  The problem&apos;s that you can only play with 16 of them at a time.  And perhaps that you&apos;d have to bounce the MIDI through one track at a time as well.</p><p>I wonder, is it possible to have each softsynth talking directly to the MIDI device?</p><p>                                          Graham</p></div><h3><a id=5308 href="#5308">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2003 9:25:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon asked,</p><p>&gt; One last thing I meant to ask: when you are doing the final &apos;product&apos; of<br/>&gt; your pieces, is it actually a real-time playback of Finale, going into VAZ<br/>&gt; with 11 instances of Rhino (and one percussion via DR-005) &apos;live&apos; and<br/>&gt; simply capturing the audio output, or do you have a way of &apos;rendering&apos;?</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a real-time playback from Finale and I capture the live output.<br/>I send Finale&apos;s output through MIDI Ox to VAZ, where I have the instances<br/>of Rhino as channel inserts in the mixer. To record, I go into VAZ and hit<br/>the &quot;capture&quot; button, so it starts writing to disk. Then I go back to<br/>Finale and click the &quot;play&quot; button. When the piece is over, I click &quot;stop<br/>capture&quot; in VAZ. Then I load the WAV and snip the ends of the file with<br/>CoolEdit. It&apos;s very simple. To get the best performance, I minimize the VAZ<br/>window after I start the capture, and in Finale, I use the non-scrolling<br/>play with &quot;pre-scan&quot; option.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that with my CPU, 1.8GHz, pretty much the max I can get is<br/>about 9 simultaneously sounding notes; typically 7 or 8 gets dicey. On each<br/>Rhino instance, I turn the polyphony setting down to 2 (unless I need<br/>more).</p><p>[Aside: I also have noticed that there is some weird bug apparently in<br/>Windows XP that causes the machine to go into a mode where the task manager<br/>is sucking a huge CPU percentage. If that happens, all sound cracks up and<br/>even the mouse won&apos;t move smoothly... so I have to re-boot and the problem<br/>goes away.]</p><p>&gt; Well, I think Rick is really looking for *outputting* to more channels.<br/>&gt; Since he drives the final product with a printed score (Finale), what he is<br/>&gt; looking for is to expand the number of channels that can be assigned to, to<br/>&gt; increase the number of staffs in a score with separate orchestrational<br/>&gt; lines.</p><p>Not exactly. In my current setup, remember, there is no MIDI hardware at<br/>all. It&apos;s all done with software loopback drivers. I&apos;m looking to connect<br/>one program to another.</p><p>Finale can already support a huge number of staves, and it can output 64<br/>MIDI channels (i.e., 16 to 8 drivers). It has multiple MIDI outputs. Some<br/>VST hosts can *input* over 16 channels by having more than one &quot;MIDI input&quot;<br/>thing, each of which has 16 channels. The MIDI output from the VST host<br/>doesn&apos;t matter at all to me. What I would like is to connect the 64 output<br/>channels of Finale to 64 input channels of the VST host. And of course, if<br/>I feed the host more than 16 channels I would expect it to be able to<br/>render sound on those channels also. This is &quot;research&quot; for the future,<br/>when I get a new machine.

At this, I can still get dropouts and glitches if I get lots of notes going, etc., which is why...</p><p>...the rendering option is (currently) the most feasible way to go. Jacky Ligon was the first person to clue me into this. So I&apos;m wondering: you mentioned doing a lot of tweaking to the Finale score, mostly with minimal tempo and dynamic markings. How well does this translate to a midi file? I ask, because you might be able to work, with Finale, in a slightly limited fashion (can you turn off output to individual staves? i.e. if you have a big score and want to just hear a couple of lines, could you &apos;mute&apos; the midi output of the others?).</p><p>In any event, if you could export to a midi file and retain your nuances, you could import the midi file into an application like Sonar (probably others as well, I don&apos;t know what JL uses), and then &quot;export&quot; the audio. I learned with with a couple of demo files from the z3ta+ synth - there were 12 tracks of the synth itself, and the audio engine would balk at realtime playback, but all you had to do was export the file and voila - you have the audio track. You&apos;d be able to do an automated mix with the mixing console, and even put in audio effects, etc., and then dump it all to a .wav file.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying it is bulletproof, and so much of this is hardware intensive work, and will only get better with beefier systems, and with gradual improvements in hardware. But it does seem a way that, while there are a few compromises during composition, they don&apos;t seem totally ruinous to the musical/creative front-end to the project, and (hopefully) the end result will get you a larger orchestration.</p><p>I think. :)</p><p>Anyhow, some of this can be deferred until you have a heftier platform (and you&apos;re just running a Soundblaster card?) and I really noticed a difference with the ASIO drivers in my Aardvark audio card, really helped the latency in live playing.</p><p>I&apos;m calling it a day early, I gotta go celebrate something...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5311 href="#5311">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2003 2:26:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_5277.html#5295">/makemicromusic/topicId_5277.html#5295</a></p><p>&gt; So, I put some of my opinions into this page with an HTML table<br/>similar to<br/>&gt; the one I posted a while ago here...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;<a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Text/Guide-To-VST-">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Text/Guide-To-VST-</a><br/>Hosts.html<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe someday I&apos;ll update it, but meanwhile, there you have a few<br/>opinions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Rick</p><p>***Thanks so much, Rick!

I sure wish more people would chime in, but I<br/>think MMM<br/>&gt; is still in the semi-dark ages of midi/soft music making.

However,<br/>at the moment I&apos;m perfectly happy with my working methods, and don&apos;t<br/>want to invest the time to change.  I&apos;d rather be writing music!</p><p>My instinct, provided that my sequencer &quot;Digital Orchestrator Pro&quot;<br/>wouldn&apos;t handle the newest softsynths, would be to purchse some<br/>stable product like Sonar as a host and work from that base... Pricy,<br/>yes, but then I wouldn&apos;t be in bug-land.  Would that approach be<br/>sensible?? (Maybe somebody already said this?  Is there an echo in<br/>here?? :)</p><p>J.

I&apos;m *sure* that after you get up into the &gt;12-16 instances of VSTs you are probably going to have to mute some as you work on your mix, but since Sonar can &apos;export&apos; the file, in non-real-time, your end result will be what you want.</p><p>Just a thought, that&apos;s all. Cakewalk is coming out with 3.0, so you might see 2.2 in blowout sales this fall. And Cakewalk (has anyone else had problems with that name and trying to pass it off as a professional product?) has been bought and adopted by Roland for use with their product lines, so they won&apos;t be going away.</p><p>As we are learning, more than one way to peel a grape.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
