The .pdf software &quot;rebelled...&quot;</p><p>But the Word version (actually created from .emf files) works quite<br/>well, if you have it enlarged enough on the screen. Or, even better<br/>yet, just print out the fairly short score. This works.</p><p>Since we&apos;re running out of file space in our Files area, I deleted<br/>something else even *larger* I had there to make room for it.</p><p>It should be possible, with the sound file and the score, of course,<br/>to do some kind of &quot;analysis&quot; of the piece, if anybody&apos;s<br/>interested... with reference to moving around on the Blackjack<br/>lattice...</p><p>I will enjoy and appreciate any comments, no matter how negative... :)</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=3502 href="#3502">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2002 9:13:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I will enjoy and appreciate any comments, no matter how<br/>negative... :)</p><p>ok, the more i listen to this piece (6 times now?), the more i like<br/>it.</p><p>at first i thought:</p><p>i like most of the melodic ideas, but i&apos;m still bothered by the<br/>unidirectionality of many of them . . . especially when you&apos;re moving<br/>stepwise through blackjack scale (which is so uneven, and so<br/>predictably so -- kind of gives the impression of a technical<br/>impediment), instead of one of the 10- or 7-note subset scales.<br/>mechanical melodic patterns can also be as bad or worse than<br/>unidirectionality, i find . . . either way the whole affair can start<br/>to sound a bit like &quot;tuning&quot; rather than &quot;music&quot; . . .
