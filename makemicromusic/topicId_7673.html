I hope you and<br/>others will request such a feature, and hopefully Rene will make it<br/>a reality.  I think he once commented the reason he didn&apos;t implement<br/>it on sfz/+ was that most root samples are not perfectly tuned, so<br/>microtuning them would yield suprising results.  I say, so what, we<br/>WANT IT anyway!</p><p>BTW, if you remember I had conversed with the designer of Vsampler<br/>requesting SCALA compatibility, and God Bless him.  He did it.</p></div>
