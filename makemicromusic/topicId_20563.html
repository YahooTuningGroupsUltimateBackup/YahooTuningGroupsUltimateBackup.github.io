The repetitive voice (now, not now...) with el. drums reminds me something...  Is it possible I heard this piece before?<br/>I have explored 7edo deeply in the end of 80&apos;s and I like it still. I think that inharmonic timbres here hide the tuning properties. It sounds to me as a music in no tuning at all, more sonoric than harmonic/melodic. But it works, anyway. Although I don&apos;t like this kind of drums, but it is my very personal feeling.<br/>Regards<br/>Milan</p></div>
