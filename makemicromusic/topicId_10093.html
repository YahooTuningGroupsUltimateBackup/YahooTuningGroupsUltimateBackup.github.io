But first, a quote:</p><p>In the article, Grant O&apos;Brien wrote:<br/>&gt; In conclusion<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Musically, in those tonalities which are playable in Smith&apos;s &apos;Equal<br/>Harmony&apos; temperament and using his Second System , the tuning quality of a<br/>major triad is almost identical with -comma meantone temperament, except<br/>that normal -comma meantone has major thirds that are 4 cents wider instead<br/>of 4 cents narrower than pure. Chromaticism is even more poignant in Smith&apos;s<br/>temperament than in any of the normal seventeenth- and eighteenth-century<br/>cyclical or regular temperaments which use major thirds which are either<br/>pure or slightly wide. This poignancy is achieved because the narrow thirds<br/>of Smith&apos;s temperament effectively result in the characteristic small<br/>chromatic semitones. This effect becomes especially apparent and musically<br/>effective in chromatic passages and in enharmonic modulations because of the<br/>wide spacing of the enharmonically-related notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although Smith&apos;s &apos;Equal Harmony&apos; temperament has gained little popularity<br/>and is considered an obscure and little-known temperament, it is clearly not<br/>without its musical advantages. Nonetheless it is true that the difference<br/>between Smith&apos;s temperament and the easy-to-tune &iuml;&iquest;&half;-comma meantone<br/>temperament is only marginal in its musical effectiveness or in its use on<br/>an instrument equipped with the enharmonic lever arrangements suggested by<br/>Smith. It is of course possible to use &iuml;&iquest;&half;-comma meantone temperament equally<br/>well on either an organ or a harpsichord equipped for Smith&apos;s &apos;Equal<br/>Harmony&apos; without modification to the physical operating mechanism. Perhaps<br/>the musical qualities and advantages of the temperament do not quite live up<br/>to the mathematical elegance of Smith&apos;s ingenious tuning system and the<br/>mechanical artifice and sophistication with which he puts it into practice,<br/>whether on the organ or on the harpsichord.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m particularly interested in his comments on the &quot;poignancy&quot;<br/>of the Smith &quot;Equal Harmony&quot; - 50-EDO  - being due to its<br/>&quot;characteristic small chromatic semitones&quot;.</p><p>Here&apos;s my question, on which I seek your collective wisdom based<br/>on actual experience of alternative tunings (rather than theory):<br/>How far can one take this narrowing of the chromatic semitones,<br/>while still retaining a fairly just flavour to the intonation?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.2/65 - Release Date: 7/8/05</p></div><h3><a id=10107 href="#10107">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2005 9:57:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s my question, on which I seek your collective wisdom based<br/>&gt; on actual experience of alternative tunings (rather than theory):<br/>&gt; How far can one take this narrowing of the chromatic semitones,<br/>&gt; while still retaining a fairly just flavour to the intonation?</p><p>Hi Yahya,</p><p>Perhaps Aaron Johnson is uniquely qualified to answer this question,<br/>considering the extensive work he&apos;s just done in 2/5-comma meantone,<br/>which could be one possible answer to your query.</p><p>&quot;Fairly just&quot; is a relative term to say the least.

Move the tuning even further, all the way to 9-equal (generator &gt;667 or 533 cents), and this &quot;opposite-of-diatonic&quot; scale becomes &gt;melodically a lot more flavorful, if harmonically quite harsh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;But i use the generator 523.6628465<br/>&gt;&gt;within a few cents of the complement of yours.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Within less than one cent. It&apos;s only a matter of convention whether you &gt;say 523 or 677 -- the tuning comes out the same (if the period is 1200 &gt;cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!

These brief excerpts are in TOP lemba, but could just as<br/>&gt; easily have been in 26-ET; lemba has a half-octave period, and a<br/>&gt; generator which is close to 5 steps of 26-ET.
