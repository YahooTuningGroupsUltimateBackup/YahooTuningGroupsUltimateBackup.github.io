Of course this all raises the question<br/>of tuning accuracy, which is 1/10,000th of a Hz or so in Csound-<br/>just how small are those holes? I believe that they&apos;ll actually work<br/>in unison with other fifths- a violin playing a 3/2 and a synth a<br/>104/69 is, I believe, going to work as a thickening effect and<br/>not an out of tune effect, but we&apos;ll have to hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I get time, I&apos;ll finish a little<br/>&gt; &gt; Csound program that runs through high fifths and you can hear<br/>&gt;&gt;for<br/>&gt; &gt; yourself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be good!
