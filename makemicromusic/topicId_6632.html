Cantilena for George Secor, 17-tET (equal temperament)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigse.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigse.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>2. Cantilena for George Secor, 17-WT (Secor well-temperament, 1978)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsw.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsw.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>3. Cantilena for George Secor, 17-ME (my &quot;modified eventone,&quot; 2000)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsm.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsm.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>4. Cantilena for George Secor, JOT-17 (my 17-note just system, 2002)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>As has often been said, 17-tET and its relatives are unlikely<br/>candidates for styles of harmony based on regular thirds at or near<br/>ratios of 5:4 (~386.31 cents) and 6:5 (~315.64 cents); rather, harmony<br/>in these 17-note systems can draw upon or approximate ratios formed by<br/>factors of 2-3-7-9-11-13.</p><p>My composition illustrates one &quot;neo-medieval&quot; style of harmony in 17,<br/>with some modern touches: using narrow minor thirds and wide major<br/>thirds as ingredients in relatively concordant but active sonorities<br/>which resolve to stable sonorities based on fifths and fourths.</p><p>Two characteristic sonorities are a minor third, fifth, and minor<br/>seventh above the lowest voice, with the seventh tending to contract<br/>to a fifth; and a major third, fifth, and major sixth, with the third<br/>typically expanding to a fifth and the sixth to an octave.</p><p>In one style of microtonal terminology, these sonorities in 17-tone<br/>and similar systems are often called &quot;subminor seventh chords&quot; and<br/>&quot;supramajor sixth chords&quot; respectively, to emphasize that the ratios<br/>are different from the 5-based ones that people often associate with<br/>major and minor thirds and sixths.</p><p>While basic progressions of this kind are inspired by a 14th-century<br/>European style, this piece often approaches such progressions by<br/>somewhat Renaissance-like suspensions, mixing these elements in a<br/>texture which might also suggest the minor seventh and added sixth<br/>chords of some 20th-century styles.</p><p>These chords and progressions illustrate a characteristic of harmony<br/>in 17-tone and similar systems. When thirds have ratios at or near 5:4<br/>and 6:5 -- &quot;5-limit harmony&quot; -- the 5:4 major third placed _below_ the<br/>6:5 minor third, forming a sonority of 4:5:6, tends to sound more<br/>smooth and conclusive than the converse arrangement with the minor<br/>third below the major (10:12:15).</p><p>In contrast, with the sizes of regular thirds found in a system like<br/>17-tET or its relatives, the smaller minor or &quot;subminor&quot; third is most<br/>smoothly placed _below_ the larger major or &quot;supramajor&quot; third. A<br/>common example involves the simple ratios of the 6:7 (sub)minor third<br/>at around 266.87 cents, and the 7:9 (supra)major third at around<br/>435.08 cents: the 6:7:9 arrangement is often notably smoother than<br/>14:18:21 with the large major third below. The latter sonority can<br/>bring lots of tension and excitement, although in higher registers it<br/>can take on more smooth qualities.</p><p>It&apos;s also important to say that this &quot;neo-medieval&quot; style is only one<br/>approach to harmony in 17: another approach, which can also supplement<br/>this one, is George Secor&apos;s focus on isoharmonic chords based on<br/>higher primes like 7:9:11, 9:11:13, or 7:9:11:13, where adjacent<br/>partials have the same differences (here two). Indeed, Secor&apos;s 17-WT<br/>is ingeniously designed to yield nice approximations of these and<br/>other isoharmonic chords with the right intervals in the right<br/>places to form the desired combinations.</p><p>Another resource of 17 is the wealth of neutral steps and intervals,<br/>of interest for example in following or borrowing elements from a<br/>medieval or later Near Eastern style (where such intervals abound).</p><p>Melodically, 17-tone systems feature compact and incisive diatonic<br/>semitones, at about 70.588 cents in 17-tET and ranging from around 56<br/>to 81 cents in the unequal systems here surveyed.</p><p>Now let&apos;s quickly consider some of the specifics of these tunings,<br/>with links to the MIDI examples provided again for convenience.</p><p>1. 17-tone equal temperament (17-tET)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigse.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigse.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In 17-tET, each thirdtone has an identical size of about 70.588 cents,<br/>and ten of these steps make the fifth at around 705.88 cents, about<br/>3.93 cents wide. Major thirds at six scale steps are around 423.53<br/>cents, which seems around the region of maximum complexity, richness,<br/>or &quot;dissonance,&quot; depending on your point of view (and the timbre).<br/>While this is fine for lots of harmony in a style for 17, and can be<br/>pleasantly exciting, other 17-note systems often seek and obtain major<br/>thirds at or closer to ratios such as 9:7 or 14:11 (~417.51 cents).</p><p>2. George Secor&apos;s 17-tone well-temperament (17-WT)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsw.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsw.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>This system, most admirably modelled by analogy to a 12-note<br/>well-temperament of the classic late 17th-18th century type, has the<br/>thirds in the nearer keys or transpositions yield the best<br/>approximations of 6:7:9, with fifths in this portion of the tuning<br/>tempered more heavily at about 707.22 cents (about 5.265 cents wide,<br/>comparable to meantone in the opposite direction). In the more remote<br/>portion of the circle, fifths are tempered more mildly at about 704.38<br/>cents, yielding some just 14:11 major thirds. In this piece, Secor&apos;s<br/>temperament brings the (sub)minor seventh sonority C-Eb-G-Bb, for<br/>example, not too far from a simple 7-based ratio of 12:14:18:21 (with<br/>an outer 7:4 minor seventh), about 0-267-702-969 cents in a just<br/>version, and 0-278-707-985 cents at this position in 17-WT. The narrow<br/>diatonic semitones in the nearer portion of the circle at around 63.90<br/>cents also have an excellent quality for melody.</p><p>3. My 17-tone circulating &quot;modified eventone&quot; (17-ME)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsm.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsm.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>While Secor&apos;s 17-WT shows the kind of grand design that can be applied<br/>to a 17-tone system, mine might show the flexibility of this genre.<br/>Having started with a regular 12-note tuning (Eb-G#) with the fifths<br/>tempered to produce pure 14:11 major thirds (an arrangement Secor also<br/>uses, as I was later to learn, in the more remote portion of 17-WT), I<br/>simply added five notes to complete a tuning circle, with the most<br/>heavily tempered fifths and thirds closest to 6:7 and 7:9 in this<br/>remote portion. For the kind of regular temperament formed by the<br/>first 12 notes, I use the term &quot;eventone&quot; -- a major third, as in a<br/>meantone, is formed by two equal or &quot;even&quot; whole-tones. In this<br/>version, the fifths are more mildly tempered (about 2.42 cents wide),<br/>and the thirds rather more complex than in Secor&apos;s 17-WT; diatonic<br/>semitones in the nearer portion of the circle, at around 78.115 cents,<br/>are nicely compact but not so efficient as Secor&apos;s.</p><p>4. My &quot;Just Octachord Tuning 17&quot; (JOT-17)<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>This 17-note tuning -- not a &quot;circulating&quot; system under usual timbral<br/>conditions, since fifths can be wide by as much as 64:63 (~27.26<br/>cents) -- is largely based on a series of superparticular (n+1:n)<br/>ratios for diatonic semitones or thirdtones -- 28:27, 27:26, 24:23,<br/>23:22, and 22:21. A fourth is divided into seven thirdtone steps, or<br/>eight notes (e.g. Bb-A#-B-C-Db-C#-D-Eb), and thus my &quot;Just Octachord<br/>Tuning.&quot; While all intervals are based on integer ratios, and 11 of<br/>the 17 fifths are pure, one feature resembling a typical 18th-century<br/>well-temperament for 12 notes is the appearance of some prominent<br/>fifths about 5 cents impure (F-C, G-D, A-E). Here, an internal cadence<br/>arrives at one of these &quot;virtually tempered&quot; fifths (A-E), while the<br/>final cadence lands on the pure fifth Bb-F. In the nearer portion of<br/>the circle, as in my &quot;modified eventone,&quot; major thirds are at or near<br/>14:11, with minor thirds at or near 13:11 (~289.21 cents).</p><p>To sum up, the elements in 17 of small minor thirds, large major<br/>thirds, and compact diatonic semitones can all pull together nicely in<br/>congenial styles of harmony and counterpoint. At the same time,<br/>different 17-tone systems can render the same piece with different<br/>shades of harmonic color and melodic proportion; as with different<br/>shades of 16th-century meantone, or 18th-century well-temperament,<br/>this variety has its own charm.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6686 href="#6686">ðŸ”—</a>bfowol &#x3C;pkroser@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2004 2:02:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Could you elaborate a bit more on the structure of the Just Octachord<br/>17 scale?
