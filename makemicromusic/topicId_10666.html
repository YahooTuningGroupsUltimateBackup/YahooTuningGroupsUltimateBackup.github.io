And do you have to be a beta<br/>&gt; tester for FTS?</p><p>I think if you write to Robert Walker he could tell you. He has a 30-day<br/>free trial, which would help you determine if FTS meets your needs. FTS is<br/>not very expensive anyway. GPO itself, however, is pretty expensive. You<br/>also need a MIDI loop driver like &quot;Midi Yoke&quot; to do any of this, because<br/>you have to connect the output of some MIDI player to FTS, and then connect<br/>FTS to GPO.</p><p>FTS: <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a><br/>GPO: <a href="http://www.garritan.com">http://www.garritan.com</a><br/>MIDI Yoke: <a href="http://www.midiox.com">http://www.midiox.com</a></p><p>It is a bit of a hassle to set up FTS with all of the right options and<br/>windows to do this, but once you&apos;ve done it, the software remembers your<br/>settings, and then all you have to do is point it at different tuning<br/>files. At some point, when Robert releases the next FTS version, I had<br/>planned to write up some pointers about how to set up FTS properly for this<br/>kind of re-tuning.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 3:43:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon asked,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How about burning one with just a little less verb?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK...

Do<br/>&gt; you have a way of independently measuring the pitches this system is<br/>&gt; producing?</p><p>You are correct that some notes aren&apos;t quite right. The clarinet, in<br/>particular, is actually way *out of tune* with the rest of the ensemble,<br/>and I&apos;ve since replaced it with a patch that is in-tune, so next go-round<br/>will sound better in that regard. (Note, however, that this could also be<br/>related to the following bug; it&apos;s not quite clear yet.) I&apos;m also not<br/>really sure the piano is as in-tune as it could be with the other<br/>instruments.</p><p>The 2nd violins are probably the cause of the audible so-called &quot;wide<br/>unisons&quot;. The violins are victims of a gnarly bug in FTS which is rendering<br/>incorrect notes in some conditions. This is a note on/off tracking problem<br/>somewhere, and the pitch-bend gets set incorrectly. Those will be fixed as<br/>soon as Robert can find the bug! Some of these bugs only occur when using<br/>more than one MIDI device, so it&apos;s also sometimes a matter of being able to<br/>isolate problems in a way that can be probed with debugging tools.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 4:23:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I&apos;m pretty sure some of the intervals here don&apos;t exist in 15-equal -- &gt;particularly a really small &quot;wide unison&quot; almost halfway through.

I played the &quot;solo clarinet&quot; in 12-tet against the oboe and<br/>flute. They sound in-tune enough. But when you switch them all into 15-tet<br/>by applying pitch-bends, suddenly the clarinet becomes really sour and<br/>out-of tune with the other two instruments.
