This wouldn&apos;t probably be so much a<br/>feature to add to my sequencer as a separate interface.<br/>I&apos;m not saying I could produce it quickly, but would many of you be<br/>interested in a sequencer using Johnston&apos;s accidentals?  What sorts of<br/>interfaces would be good for that?<br/>Like, certain keys would add certain accidentals to existing notes,<br/>certain keys would take them away, etc.  You can&apos;t just have a key turn<br/>a flat on or off, since you might want to use numerous flats.  Or, I<br/>could set it up like my existing sequencer, where you could set 1/1 to<br/>different values as the score progresses.<br/>Personally, I find my existing solution easier to use than Johnston&apos;s<br/>accidentals.  I like that people are encouraged to think in terms of<br/>ratios, which is closer to what music really is than the ABCs are.<br/>Anyone?</p></div><h3>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2006 10:18:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 9/17/06, Chuckk Hubbard &lt;BadMuthaHubbard@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I just realized that traditional notation with Johnstonian accidentals<br/>&gt; would be possible with Pure Data.

While, ideally, you could choose to<br/>use any of the systems he mentioned, I&apos;d probably prefer to use Saggital,<br/>followed by pythagorean Johnston, followed by diatonic Johnston.  Diatonic<br/>Johnston does have the advantage that there are actually people out there<br/>that perform based on this system, and there are major published works in<br/>it.  I just find it a weird way to think.</p><p>Personally, Chukk, I don&apos;t think that persuing a staff-based notation system<br/>in PD would be the best priority for you.  Your sequencer is great, but<br/>there&apos;s a lot of work before it&apos;s really polished.  Most composers are used<br/>to fairly polished notation applications for standard notation (Finale,<br/>Sibelius, etc) and it&apos;d be very hard to match that kind of feature set.<br/>Personally, if I write something in a sequencer like yours and I actually<br/>need staff notation for presentation/performance, I can do that in Sibelius<br/>afterwards.</p><p>My personal hope is that one of the major notation editors finally gets<br/>usable support for microtonal composition.  Sibelius, my personal choice,<br/>has a kludgy script based support for quartertones, and you could probably<br/>write a plugin to get it to play back in any given notation system/tuning<br/>you want with the proper skill.  Still, you&apos;d have to limit yourself to one<br/>voice per staff, I believe.  Finale has it&apos;s custom key signature option<br/>which can make a lot of notation systems work with a synth with a preset<br/>tuning.  Notion currently has elegant support for quartertones, and when<br/>emailed said they at least have some interest in greater microtonal<br/>support.  One can hope, right?</p><p>There&apos;s also stuff like Rosegarden which may be good starting platforms.</p><p>That said, if you&apos;re excited about writting a JI notation editor, I&apos;m sure<br/>there are people who would love it.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2006 10:14:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rozencrantz the Sane escreveu:<br/>&gt; First, I personally find Saggital more aesthetic than Johnston.<br/>&gt; Second, I find Pythagorean Johnston more reasonable than Diatonic<br/>&gt; Johnston.
