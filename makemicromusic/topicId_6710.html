But the viola da gamba has 6<br/>strings... To do non-12 music, you&apos;d want to re-fret it, however. You&apos;re<br/>probably better off just getting a cello and re-tuning.</p><p>&gt; I would tune the cello like a guitar , and play in just intonation!</p><p>Ah, speaking of re-tuning... if your&apos;e going the viola da gamba route,<br/>Interesting.  But you have to be careful re-tuning acoustic instruments.<br/>They&apos;re made to sound best in a particular range, and also you won&apos;t want<br/>too much changing of the strings from their normal tension. You could<br/>probably tune it *similarly* to a guitar in terms of relations between the<br/>strings, but maybe not *exactly* like a guitar...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
