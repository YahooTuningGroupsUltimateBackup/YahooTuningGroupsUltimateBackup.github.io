But you have to be careful re-tuning acoustic instruments.<br/>They&apos;re made to sound best in a particular range, and also you won&apos;t want<br/>too much changing of the strings from their normal tension. You could<br/>probably tune it *similarly* to a guitar in terms of relations between the<br/>strings, but maybe not *exactly* like a guitar...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
