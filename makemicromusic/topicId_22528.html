Video game music was really at its peak in the 8- and 16-bit eras.  Sonic the Hedgehog was top-notch, some of the most anthemic game music ever.  I think Sonic 2 had my favorite music...the &quot;Chemical Plant Zone&quot; is so rad!  Super Metroid on the SNES also had some of the best music of the era...so totally evocative and engrossing.  I agree that there is a lot of room for microtonality in video games...broadening the palette of consonance and dissonance can only make for more evocative possibilities.  My friend Stevie, of Corpus Callosum fame, is an aspiring video game music composer, and he&apos;s totally into microtonality...I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll come up with some good stuff once he gets some work!</p><p>But yeah, Sean&apos;s piece here is top-notch...not that I&apos;m surprised!</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Dare I admit...minus the fact I&apos;d consider that older 14-tone scale just decent and by no means great...you&apos;ve managed to squeeze a whole lot of life out of it and RGB sparkles with early 80&apos;s chip tune funkiness.  At the little cuts, rotations, and melodic changes you&apos;ve added cleverly give momentum to &quot;momentum-less instruments&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I&apos;m also a huge fan of chip-tunes much because it brings so much of the focus back to crafty compositional skills, rather than things like massive synths, orchestral backing, or breakbeats to surprise you (and, often case, if you took away the cutting-edge production, you&apos;d be left with something very predictable and boring).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    On a side notes...major props for you recognition of early video gaming tunes like Sonic the Hedgehog...which had IMVHO incredibly imaginative music.  I remember playing Starfox, Megaman, and the original Mario Bros without sound and they lost about half of their fun factor...it&apos;s amazing just how much music matters in games.  And, needless to say, I think there&apos;s huge potential for micro-tonality in the gaming world, where imagination is valued more and &quot;weirdness&quot; prejudged less.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2010 7:03:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, May 28, 2010 at 9:59 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah!
