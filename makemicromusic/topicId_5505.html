I just realized yesterday that at least two emails from a dear friend of mine got trashed before I had a chance to see them. I&apos;ve fixed the problem now, but...</p><p>Anyhow, please don&apos;t just *assume* someone is ignoring you - there are a myriad of reasons you might not have gotten a response. Maybe a gentler query here would have done the trick, instead of the above.</p><p>&gt;Also on another list (Tuning)...</p><p>Then that would be the appropriate place to post a message about the trouble. Not here.</p><p>&gt;I get the substantial feeling that peeps just delete my postings unread. &gt;Guess I irritate some peeps&apos; elitist wonderbread worldview...</p><p>I don&apos;t, and you know that because I&apos;ve written to you off-list as well. But sometimes people are very focused on one thing or another, and one never knows when a post will really &apos;catch&apos; people, and when it won&apos;t.</p><p>I would offer that, as fond as I am of your usual assortment of quotes in your .sig, there are times when not having lots and lots of text that aren&apos;t part of the message is ok too.</p><p>Hope you stick around, or come back at some point.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5509 href="#5509">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2003 12:35:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 10/10/03 07:00, czhang23@... at czhang23@... wrote:</p><p>I have sent quite a number of emails offlist to Alison M. less than 3<br/>months ago re: Korean music and never even got a bloody polite thank you,<br/>much<br/>less a fuckin&apos; acknowledgement of my existence.<br/>Also on another list (Tuning) I requested info on Raga Mela Hanumatodi<br/>... it has been enough fucking time and not a single damn response &amp; I know<br/>there are peeps out there that know at least bleedin&apos; something.<br/>I get the substantial feeling that peeps just delete my postings unread.<br/>Guess I irritate some peeps&apos; elitist wonderbread worldview...<br/>Understandable,<br/>I will not waste my time or yours...</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Dear Hanuman</p><p>I&apos;m SO sorry. I scan every email that I receive, except for the spam, and I<br/>read those that I think I&apos;ll understand. I ALWAYS read yours. What has<br/>happened is that my spam filter has put anything that isn&apos;t in my address<br/>book into the bin and I haven&apos;t checked. (I wouldn&apos;t suit a penis extension<br/>and last time I checked I didn&apos;t need viagra)</p><p>If I had received your emails I would have been delighted to correspond.</p><p>Please feel free to email me offlist.</p><p>I always reply to people as others on the list know.</p><p>Sincerely<br/>a.m.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
