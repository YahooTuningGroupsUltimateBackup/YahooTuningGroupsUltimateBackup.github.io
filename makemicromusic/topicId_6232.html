I&apos;ve done a bit of composing in<br/>7-et. The fifths are very dissonant and when<br/>composing you feel they need to be resolved rather<br/>than used as a point of rest. But the 7-et<br/>&quot;triad&quot; is no more dissonant than say a 12 equal<br/>dom 7th, and you can resolve it to the 7-et<br/>third diad, which I think is somewhat more consonant<br/>than a 12-et major third triad and somewhat similar<br/>in its role. It works well as a point of rest<br/>at the end of a piece - and you can make a<br/>very pleasant sounding cadence from descending<br/>thirds e.g. degrees 2 4 to 0 2 in 7-et.<br/>You can add a bit more dissonance by using<br/>the triad e.g. 2 4 6 to 0 2.</p><p>So 14-tet sounds to me like an interesting<br/>way of extending 7-et, by introducing<br/>&quot;sharps and flats&quot;. In diatonic music<br/>you use the circle of fifths to<br/>introduce the accidentals - but that<br/>won&apos;t work in 7-et as the fifths only<br/>take you around in 7-et and are dissonances<br/>anyway.</p><p>So I wonder, how you could get from one<br/>of the 7-et scales to the other?<br/>Maybe you could use the three step 11/9<br/>approximation in some way, as perhaps the<br/>next most consonant interval in 14-et<br/>after the 9/7.</p><p>(I&apos;m temporarily without sound so can&apos;t<br/>listen to anything or try it out just this<br/>moment).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=6233 href="#6233">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2004 11:52:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; HI there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14-tet consists of two interleaved 7-et scales, and those have<br/>&gt; nice concordant thirds - rich in texture,<br/>&gt; very close to 9/7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I wonder, how you could get from one<br/>&gt; of the 7-et scales to the other?<br/>&gt; Maybe you could use the three step 11/9<br/>&gt; approximation in some way, as perhaps the<br/>&gt; next most consonant interval in 14-et<br/>&gt; after the 9/7.</p><p>Not sure if I&apos;m understanding you correctly, but I thought I&apos;d point<br/>out . . .</p><p>9/7 is indeed approximated somewhat well in 14-equal, by in interval<br/>of 5 steps.

I<br/>remember Dan Stearns influencing Dave Keenan to upgrade his<br/>assessment of certain tempered systems with this triad as the<br/>specific example. Although the &apos;root&apos; or &apos;1&apos; of the chord isn&apos;t<br/>available in the 14-equal tuning system, the triad has certain<br/>properties which, with a bit of attention to timbre, register,<br/>duration, and loudness, can lend it an unmistakeable &apos;consonance&apos;<br/>or &apos;concordance&apos;.</p><p>If any of the 14-tETters out there want to try composing music with<br/>such triads and related harmonies, I&apos;d love to hear it. Otherwise, I<br/>should shut up now, until I make some such musical examples of my<br/>own . . .</p></div>
