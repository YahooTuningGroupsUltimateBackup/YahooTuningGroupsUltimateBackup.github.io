I&apos;ve fixed that, as well as<br/>uploaded some other things.  Please download away, and write me with<br/>your reactions!  I&apos;ve pasted descriptions below.</p><p>A Great Crossing - This is a 30-minute piece of pure electronic music.<br/>Please enjoy the download, but you may also be able to purchase a<br/>surround-sound dvd! If you are interested, e-mail me.</p><p>Beresheit - This piece was written for choir, string quintet, and a<br/>pair of microtuned keyboards. It&apos;s the largest ensemble I&apos;ve ever<br/>worked with! The text is from the first few sentences of the Torah.</p><p>Orestes Variations - This is a trio for violin and two &apos;cellos. It<br/>begins with a melody from ancient Greece (I think circa 5th-century<br/>b.c.), which is reworked in successive variations. Can you hear the<br/>theme throughout?</p><p><a href="http://www.cmbryan.com">www.cmbryan.com</a></p><p>-chris</p><p>--<br/>&quot;... free speech is meaningless if the commercial cacophony has risen<br/>to the point that no one can hear you.&quot;  -Naomi Klein</p></div>
