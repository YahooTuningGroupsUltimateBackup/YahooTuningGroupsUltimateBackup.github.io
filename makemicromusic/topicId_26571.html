Then again no kidding: I&apos;ve seen you Carl, Gene, John, and several others get angry when people misjudge their scales/theories.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In fact, from Quora, Facebook, Reddit, and Slashdot to various bulletin boards...I can&apos;t think of a single one that doesn&apos;t have active moderation mechanisms -- sometimes multiple levels of them.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Only thing is, for example, I&apos;m regularly on Slashdot, Facebook, Yahoo Answers...and several other boards, many of them very opinionated...and have not been flagged as a &quot;troll&quot; or otherwise threatened to be knocked off the site on a single one.&nbsp; The worst thing I&apos;ve ever had happen is I posted a specific question on fertility outside the &quot;male health&quot; section (IE in the pregnancy section instead) and got a violation...of course I never repeated that and my records got cleared after a few months.<br/>   The only list such a thing (IE being labelled a troll) has happened on for me is the Tuning list back when you were moderating it.&nbsp; So the general case with you, and not other lists, seems to be the anomaly.</p><p>&gt; Chris wrote:<br/>&gt;Dealing with Internet Trolls - the Cognitive Therapy Approach<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/909.html">http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/909.html</a></p><p>  For the record, I think the above is a good approach.&nbsp; And when he suspected I may have been &quot;trolling&quot;, Mike B did exactly that approach.&nbsp; Turns out both that he basically mis-understood my point and that, even when he did &quot;get it&quot;...there were some things I misjudged about how it would or could work.  Actually I&apos;ve find virtually every time someone thinks I&apos;m &quot;trolling&quot;, it turns out the simply misinterpreted my idea.</p><p>&nbsp; Come to think of it, Mike B. just did that (IE basically from the link Chris gave) technique again when replying to my recent &quot;A scale that does it for me like diatonic&quot;...saying clearly the tuning I gave him as an alternative did not work for him because we wanted a tuning with a single smaller/transpose-able sub-scale within it and that he wanted an MOS (while my scale was &quot;hyper-MOS&quot; with 4 or so semi-tone interval sizes).</p><p>  Carl, maybe you should take note how Mike B. responds to me as of late...if you paint me as &quot;not compatible&quot; I can understand...but if you paint me as &quot;lazy, purposefully ignorant and/or evil&quot;...there&apos;s no way I will understand because, no matter how much you may hate the kind of work I do, I do so through hard work, trying my honest best to take everything into account (including other people&apos;s constructive suggestions), and do so for the better good of the community.</p></div>
