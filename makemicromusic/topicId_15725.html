The piece is now listed as BM WA<br/>1996-10-2,1, and depicts, among others, the figure of a crouched female<br/>lutanist. The seal, which I shall not discuss here, has been identified<br/>by Dr Collon as an Uruk example and thus predates the previously oldest<br/>known iconographic representations by about 800 years. Little can be<br/>said about the instrument except that it would have measured about 80<br/>centimetres long and that some protuberances at the top of its neck<br/>might be the representation of some device for the tuning of its<br/>strings. Otherwise, the angle of the neck in its playing position as<br/>well as the position of the musician&apos;s arms and hands is consistant<br/>with one of the aforementioned Akkadian seals, namely BM 89096. This<br/>shows that the instrument evolved very little for the best part of one<br/>millennium, for the probable reason that it already had completed its<br/>development, as early as the Uruk period.</p><p>The existence of the lute among the instrumentarium of the late fourth<br/>millennium is of paramount importance as it is consequential to the<br/>understanding and usage of ratios at that period. I am further willing<br/>to hypothesize that the lute might have been at the origins of the<br/>proportional system. This is what I shall now demonstrate.</p><p>The lute differs from the two other types of stringed instuments, namely<br/>harps and lyres, in that each one of their strings produces more than<br/>one sound. This peculiarity qualifies the lute as a fretted instrument,<br/>not on the basis that it is provided with frets as we know them on the<br/>modern guitar, for instance, but in that each of the different notes<br/>generated from each of its strings is determined by accurate positions<br/>marked on the neck of the instrument. These are defined from the<br/>principle of ratios, and it is the principle of the stopping of the<br/>strings along the neck of the instrument that was at the origins of the<br/>understanding of such ratios.</p><p>DEMONSTRATION</p><p>Let us take a string that we stretch along the neck of a lute. Its<br/>length is measured from the bridge to the nut as this is the part of the<br/>string which vibrates freely to produce music. If a finger presses the<br/>string onto the neck of the lute at precisely half of its length, and if<br/>the half between the bridge and the finger is then plucked, the note<br/>heard will be one octave higher than it sounded when it was free. The<br/>ratio of the length of the free string to that of its half is therefore<br/>of 2:1. Babylonian musical theory defines two intervals, thirds and<br/>fifths. The position at which fingers should stop the strings to produce<br/>these intervals would be 6:5 for the minor third; 5:4 for the major<br/>third; and 4:3 for the fifth, and of course 6:3 = 2:1 for the octave. It<br/>goes without saying that we have there a series of ratios - 6:5:4:3 -<br/>which coincides with the god numbers of 60 for Anu, 50 for Enlil, 40 for<br/>Ea, and 30 for Sin. This is the basic infrastructure for the Babylonian<br/>scale. However, there is a problem since it is well attested that during<br/>the Old Babylonian period, the scales were incontestably descending, and<br/>not ascending as we have it on our Uruk lute. However, it can be argued<br/>that since ratios of string lengths behave in reciprocal relation to<br/>ratios of frequencies, that it all comes to the same. Furthermore,<br/>ratios can be inversed: minor thirds become major sixths; major thirds<br/>become minor sixths; fourths become fifths and fifths become fourths<br/>etc. It is not improbable that despite of the fact that the<br/>approportionation of its strings was made on an ascending pattern, that<br/>the music played on the lute was composed in the characteristic style of<br/>a descending paradigm.</p><p>With regards to units of measurements in relation to the lute, it is<br/>possible to speculate that if the speaking length of a string equated to<br/>2 K&Ugrave;ÂŠ, let us say 60 centimetres, since the average forearm is 30<br/>cms, the octave fret would have been placed at 30 cms. If the other<br/>frets were then placed accordingly to this principle, the fret for the<br/>minor third, 6:5, would have been placed 10 centimetres away from the<br/>nut; the fret for the fifth, 4:3, would have been placed a further 10<br/>centimetres down. If we take arbitrarily the free string as sounding an<br/>unspecified &grave;c&apos;, then the frets as placed above would produce<br/>c-eb-g-c, a chord of c minor. Now this numeric system is unable to<br/>provide with smaller intervals and it is possible that this is what<br/>decided theoreticians to increase the values of the gods to 60, 50, 40,<br/>30 and so forth as it allowed for a more complex ratio system. This is<br/>well demonstrated with the ratio of I&euml;tar to ÂŠakkan, 15:14, which<br/>is situated outside the pantheon of the higher gods (60-50-40-30). But<br/>if we make it fit in the pantheon, 15:14 becomes 60:56, and thus the<br/>fret for ÂŠakkan would be placed 4 cms down from the nut and would<br/>produce 119,44 cents, a large semitone. In early Sumerian metrology,<br/>this would equate to 1 ÂŠ<a href="http://U.SI">U.SI</a>. Now a ÂŠ<a href="http://U.SI">U.SI</a> of 4 cms is large. It<br/>is commonly agreed that it would have measured 1.6 cms, at some point,<br/>and if we make it fit to our hypothetical system by means of<br/>approportionation, then the speaking length of the string would be 48<br/>cms. If we allow for, let us say, 10 centimetres before the nut and 10<br/>more after the bridge for the purpose of fixation, then the length of<br/>the whole instrument would be around 70 centimetres. This agrees with<br/>most of the iconographia.</p><p>Two other gods pair to produce the ideal complement to the ratio of<br/>IÂštar to ÂŠakkan (15:14): these are the second number for Anu, 21<br/>and the number for ÂŠamaÂš, 20. Their ratio 21:20 gives 84.47<br/>cents, which added to the ratio of 15:14 = 119,44 cents, adds up exactly<br/>to 203.91 cents. This is the so-called Pythagorean tone which equates to<br/>the Greek ratio of 9:8. I am willing to emphasize the argument that if<br/>up to now, the principal god numbers might have been coincidental with<br/>the fundaments of ancient musical theory, such sophisticated figures as<br/>the ones just debated cannot really confirm this coincidency. Thus, the<br/>figure of 119,44 cents would have been the Babylonian equivalent of the<br/>Greek apotome, and 84,47, the Babylonian equivalent of the Greek limma,<br/>but not any longer using the terms in their Greek definition because<br/>these Babylonian figures do not arise from the Greek methodology. The<br/>prevalence of the Babylonian apotome and limma, is futher made obvious<br/>when compared to their Greek equation which produce 114 cents for their<br/>apotome, corresponding to the ratio of 2048/2187, and 90 cents for their<br/>limma, corresponding to the ratio of 243/256.</p><p>It is clear, therefore that in spite of the fact that the Greek<br/>Pythagorean tone was a fundamental ratio in their harmonic series of<br/>12:9:8:6, the structure of their semitones was not as simple as the<br/>Babylonian system.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=15726 href="#15726">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2007 1:48:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THE URUK LUTE: ELEMENTS OF METROLOGY<br/>&gt; By RICHARD DUMBRILL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

(The archives of the main tuning list can be<br/>searched for a number of my contributions on this topic.<br/>I had some correspondence with Dumbrill years ago too.)</p><p>What you are describing, assuming that the Babylonain limma<br/>is the lower interval and the apotome the higher, is what the<br/>Greeks later called &quot;katapyknosis&quot;. In this case, the whole-tone<br/>of ratio 9:8 has its terms multiplied by 5 so that the ratio<br/>becomes 45:40, and a division represented by 42 is inserted<br/>between them, to produce an upper ratio of 45:42 = 15:14<br/>and a lower ratio of 42:40 = 21:20.</p><p>My hypothesis is that the Greek division of semitones was<br/>indeed originally as simple as the Babylonian, and in fact<br/>may have actually *been* the Babylonian. It was the later<br/>theories of Pythagoras (or the pythagorians, if in fact<br/>Pythagoras is a mythical person, which he may have been)<br/>which mandated that all ratios be based on factors of only<br/>2 and 3, which limited their construction of semitone division<br/>to the now well-known pythagorean ratios.</p><p>For my own insight into the earliest known Greek<br/>writings on tuning division, see my paper on Philolaus<br/>in _Xenharmonikon 18_, portions of which appear in this<br/>webpage:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx</a></p><p>BTW, it&apos;s probably better to migrate this whole discussion<br/>to the main tuning list, as this one is supposed to be focused<br/>on the actual making of microtonal music. So i&apos;ve cross-posted<br/>this post to the main list, and encourages response to go there.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
