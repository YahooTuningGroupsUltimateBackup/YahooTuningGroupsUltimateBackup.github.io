In this,<br/>I am humbly sitting at your feet, sprinkling holy water on your toes!</p><p>Certainly I am going to print out and save your commentary here!</p><p>I found out some things... the &quot;preview&quot; function is one of<br/>the &quot;hottest&quot; new items for this post-processing software.  Cool Edit<br/>version 1.1 has *more* previews for transforms than before... I just<br/>upgraded (free) my Cool Edit 2000.</p><p>Correspondingly, I found out that even the modest Sound Forge XP now<br/>has such &quot;previews&quot; in version 5.0.  I have version 4.5.</p><p>I&apos;ve been trying to upgrade, but I get a screen at the end of my<br/>upgrade process that says that the &quot;page cannot be displayed&quot; so I<br/>have written to Sonic Foundry.  It seems like it is something with<br/>*their* server.  Certainly they will want to fix that if they want to<br/>sell anything!</p><p>Oh... and, yes, I have been doing as you suggest concerning<br/>using &quot;segments&quot; of pieces for equalization and transform<br/>processing.  That only makes sense.</p><p>The most important thing I learned from your article should have been<br/>the most self evident:  such things as EQ should only be used if<br/>they&apos;re *needed.*</p><p>And here I was just going to add them anyway, so as to be &quot;cool...&quot;</p><p>:)</p><p>Anyway, thanks for these important tips!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
