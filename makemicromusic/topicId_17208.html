I am especially impressed with how good<br/>the 13 tone uke sounds. I have been thinking about making a little<br/>guitar or uke in 26 edo that could also be used for 13 edo. This<br/>gives me some incentive to proceed.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for anyone who might be interested ,I&apos;ve uploaded two little<br/>outtakes<br/>&gt; from this tune that we didn&apos;t use. No1 is a short bit on Chris<br/>&gt; Shaffer&apos;s 13-tone tenor ukulele (the one pictured at the zebox<br/>site),<br/>&gt; and No 2 is keyboard. They&apos;re both improvisation, the second kind<br/>of<br/>&gt; being what i thought was an interesting bit on the Lord of the<br/>Ring&apos;s<br/>&gt; theme that modulates in an almost Ivsian, Americana kind of way,<br/>and<br/>&gt; the first oone is a fast kind of ethnicy dance thingy on the uke<br/>that<br/>&gt; gives you an idea of the kind of chops he has already (he just<br/>turned<br/>&gt; 13 a few weeks ago) and that 13-tone equal temperament is not the<br/>&gt; work of the devil or the enemy of all sensitive ears...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_3/music/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_3/music/</a></p></div>
