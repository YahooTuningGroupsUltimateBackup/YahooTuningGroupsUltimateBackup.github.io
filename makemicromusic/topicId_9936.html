I know<br/>&gt; the inventors are going to jump all over me for this, but I say this<br/>&gt; as somebody who has had some experience (like 30 years) composing<br/>&gt; about every day and trying to do creative projects:  Blackjack is not<br/>&gt; entirely an *aural* scale but is, to a certain degree, a<br/>&gt; *theoretical* one.</p><p>Hi, there, Joseph, and it&apos;s a pleasure to have dialogues here enriched by<br/>your composerly perspective. Your remarks raise some interesting questions<br/>which I&apos;ll try to pursue while keeping the accent, as you do, on practical<br/>performance or composition.</p><p>&gt; In other words, because the small steps are only 33 cents apart and<br/>&gt; there are frequently two that can be part of a consonant triad (one<br/>&gt; is a *wrong* one and the other one the &quot;correct&quot; just one) it&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible to make &quot;mistakes&quot; that later have to be corrected in a<br/>&gt; theoretical appraisal.  That is not an entirely aural process.  You<br/>&gt; can say what you will.  It&apos;s not entirely aural in the way that some<br/>&gt; other scales are aural, including 12-tET.  One *knows* when<br/>&gt; the &quot;wrong&quot; note is played immediately.  They are distinct enough in<br/>&gt; terms of distance.</p><p>Maybe I should invite a clarification here: is the problem that it&apos;s hard<br/>in Blackjack to find an aurally pleasing sound or progression, or that the<br/>aural patterns of Blackjack are sometimes conceptually surprising? The<br/>first might happen if you were composing on paper, wrote a triad that you<br/>thought was 0-383-700 cents, and then tried it at the keyboard and found<br/>that it was actually 0-417-700 cents or 0-433-700 cents (respectively near<br/>4:5:6, 22:28:33, and 14:18:21).</p><p>The second situation might happen if you played a triad you really liked,<br/>made it part of your composition, and then found out that the major third,<br/>which you had supposed to be 383 cents, was actually 417 or 433.</p><p>A quick comment for now: Blackjack might seem &quot;different&quot; from the<br/>viewpoint of a conventional European 12-note tuning (e.g. Pythagorean,<br/>meantone, well-temperament, 12-equal) not only because it has more notes,<br/>and smaller intervals, but because the 116-2/3 cent generator creates a<br/>pattern quite distinct from a familiar chain of fifths.</p><p>At any rate, when I compare the kind of 24-note tuning I&apos;m accustomed to<br/>using (two 12-note chains of Pythagorean, meantone, Wilson/Pepper, etc.)<br/>with the &quot;Wonder Tuning&quot; (generator of about 233.985 cents, or 1/3 of a<br/>pure 3:2 fifth, about twice as large as the Blackjack generator) in my<br/>&quot;23-skidoo&quot; arrangement with 23 generators and thus 24 notes, the &quot;ease of<br/>navigation&quot; is indeed  much greater with the former kind of system. It<br/>isn&apos;t just that Wonder has some small intervals of around 30 cents -- the<br/>more conventional 24-note systems do also -- but the less familiar<br/>arrangement and logic.</p><p>&gt; However, Blackjack has so many other attractive qualities, including<br/>&gt; the extreme notational ease, that I suppose this is just a quibble...<br/>&gt; but here I am quibbling... :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J. Pehrson</p><p>Personally, I&apos;d place something like Blackjack or 23-Skidoo rather toward<br/>the far side of a continuum of &quot;conventional/unconventional&quot; schemes --<br/>it&apos;s a decidedly different structure as compared with many 7-note scales<br/>(e.g.  medieval European modes, Near Eastern maqamat), or with a regular<br/>chain of fifths (e.g. 12 notes or more).</p><p>Nearer the other side, there are things like my modified meantone in 12<br/>notes based on Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma from F to C#, with the other four<br/>fifths equally wide (about 6.42 cents). In the nearer transpositions, it&apos;s<br/>like a usual meantone, and in the most remote range there are some<br/>septimal approximations. Major thirds are at around 383, 396, 408, 421,<br/>and 433 cents (the smallest and largest very close to Blackjack), and<br/>minor thirds at around 275, 287, 300, and 313 cents.</p><p>An important point is that what seems &quot;conventional&quot; can depend on what<br/>one&apos;s used to: someone not used to the meantone convention that a<br/>diminished fourth like G#-C is much larger than a regular major third like<br/>A-C# might find either a regular meantone or my modified meantone<br/>&quot;strange,&quot; for example.</p><p>Anyway, an open question: if your remarks, about which I wasn&apos;t sure<br/>above, mean that sometimes you find a pleasing interval that turns out to<br/>be an unexpected size, might this be a kind of serendipity? Of course, if<br/>your remarks instead mean that you find it hard to find an aurally<br/>appealing interval, that&apos;s something else.</p><p>In 20-tET, for example, I found that the interval D-F on my keyboard<br/>mapping made a pleasing minor third contracting to a unison on E -- and<br/>then realized that D-F on my mapping was actually not 300 cents (the<br/>obvious 20-tET minor third) but 240 cents, also a large major second. This<br/>made me realize that the &quot;minor third&quot; category could at times be this<br/>flexible, with intervals around 240 cents an enhanced resource not only in<br/>this tuning but in 25-tET, for example, and various other schemes with<br/>such intervals.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=9938 href="#9938">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2005 1:16:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Maybe I should invite a clarification here: is the problem that<br/>it&apos;s hard<br/>&gt; in Blackjack to find an aurally pleasing sound or progression, or<br/>that the<br/>&gt; aural patterns of Blackjack are sometimes conceptually surprising?<br/>The<br/>&gt; first might happen if you were composing on paper, wrote a triad<br/>that you<br/>&gt; thought was 0-383-700 cents, and then tried it at the keyboard and<br/>found<br/>&gt; that it was actually 0-417-700 cents or 0-433-700 cents<br/>(respectively near<br/>&gt; 4:5:6, 22:28:33, and 14:18:21).<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hello Margo!</p><p>So nice to hear from you after quite a long time!</p><p>Certainly it is not that the progressions in Blackjack are not<br/>consonant or pleasing.

While a piece in a Renaissance style using<br/>some of the colorful augmented and diminished intervals could<br/>illustrate the advantages of a meantone, that left the question: why<br/>bother &quot;taming&quot; the Wolf fifth (G#-Eb) when Ab-Eb (or G#-D#) doesn&apos;t,<br/>if I&apos;m correct, come into play in my sample piece.</p><p>A ready solution: do a second piece, maybe an improvisation, in a<br/>remote modality like Eb Dorian or Ab Mixolydian (here I&apos;m speaking of<br/>the medieval/Renaissance European modes rather than ancient Greek<br/>ones) where Ab-Eb does get used.</p><p>To simplify things a bit (however questionably), I decided to try<br/>using a MIDI controller transposition feature to remap the keyboard so<br/>that Ab Mixolydian would be mapped to the keyboard as it if were the<br/>untranposed mode at G-G (but with the actual steps and intervals from<br/>the Ab-Ab transposition). I had mixed feelings about this, since it<br/>might be better to practice playing in remote transpositions as part<br/>of the experience of doing this piece -- longer to make fluid, but<br/>edifying and satisfying.</p><p>Anyway, I tried the &quot;shortcut,&quot; and soon took pleasure at the<br/>&quot;near-septimal thirds&quot; I was playing at what mapped to A-C-E and E-G-B<br/>on the keyboard. I was getting into a kind of early 13th-century (or<br/>very late 12th-century?) conductus style, where these sonorities could<br/>move nicely to fifths a step or down.</p><p>After I had done my &quot;shortcut&quot; recording, I checked the transposition<br/>feature again, and concluded that I might have actually transposed the<br/>keyboard mapping so that I was playing in F# Mixolydian rather than Ab<br/>Mixolydian. That meant that &quot;A-C-E&quot; would have been actual G#-B-D#, or<br/>0-300-708 cents -- a reasonable approximation of a Pythagorean<br/>0-294-702 cents (if one disregards the little matter of the fine<br/>quality of that fifth!), but distinct from the 0-275-708 I had been<br/>going for as pleasingly &quot;septimal.&quot;</p><p>My visual &quot;E-G-B&quot; would have been D#-F#-A# (or Eb-Gb-Bb) at 0-287-708<br/>cents, with a minor third about the distance from Pythagorean on the<br/>other side, and a nice approximation of 13:11, as well as an upper<br/>421-cent major third -- very pleasant to play (like &quot;A-C-E&quot;), and in<br/>the right general neighborhood, but still distinct from the intended<br/>F-Ab-C at 0-275-696 cents (well, at least the major third would have<br/>been the right size for the intended sonority).</p><p>In this tuning, interval sizes within a category change by steps of<br/>about 12.57 cents -- maybe not too different from the 16-2/3 cents of<br/>Blackjack. If the scenario above is what happened, then I had no<br/>problem playing a 300-cent or 287-cent minor third and taking it as a<br/>&quot;near-septimal&quot; 275 cents.</p><p>Anyway, having told the story and confessed my less than assured<br/>technique when it comes to basic keyboard transposition as well as<br/>interval size recognition, I might as well share the improvisation<br/>itself:</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/MixolydianDiversionTE1.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/MixolydianDiversionTE1.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Thanks again, Joseph and all, for the dialogue and camaraderie and<br/>sustaining humor.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=9948 href="#9948">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2005 12:08:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone, and here is an improvised piece _For Erin_ in a<br/>slendro scale from Zephyr 24, a just tuning which includes the 20<br/>notes of the 1-3-7-9-11-13 eikosany plus the four simple factors of 1,<br/>3, 7, and 9.</p><p>           &lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/ForErin.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/ForErin.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>The scale combines notes from two overlapping 3:2 pentachords, one<br/>taken from each keyboard, with eikosany or simple factors shown in<br/>parentheses for each note (with C4 as middle C):</p><p>                         E*3      F#*3      G#*3       B*3<br/>                       192/143   216/143     7/4     288/143<br/>                       510.109   714.019   968.826  1212.064<br/>                         (3)     (1.3.9)  (7.11.13)    (9)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    B2         C#3        E3       F#3<br/>    1/1        9/8     189/143     3/2<br/>     0       203.910   482.845   701.955<br/> (1.11.13)  (9.11.13)  (3.7.9)  (3.11.13)</p><p>The outer notes form a wide octave at about 1212 cents, or larger than<br/>a simple 2:1 by 144:143, while the overlapping notes facilitate<br/>complex unisons of 144:143 or about 12 cents (F#-F#*), and 64:63 or<br/>about 27 cents (E3-E*3) -- nuances of a kind typical in gamelan.</p><p>Of course, the art is in getting the music to flow, and here I&apos;m only<br/>a beginner.</p><p>Maybe I should add that one of the things that attracted me to this<br/>pattern was the division of the upper 4:3 fourth on the second<br/>keyboard (F#*-G#*-B*) at 864:1001:1152 or about 255-243 cents, a<br/>division which somehow reminded me of a recording of gamelan music I<br/>had heard around the early 1970&apos;s.
