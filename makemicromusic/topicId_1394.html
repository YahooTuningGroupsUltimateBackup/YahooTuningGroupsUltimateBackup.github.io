I use Csound extensively.<br/>It permits me to control many aspects of the instruments, including<br/>pan and fade. In fact, for each note, I specify the following<br/>parameters:</p><p>1. Start time<br/>2. Duration<br/>3. Velocity (volume)<br/>4. Note (out of the 43 in the scale, I only use 29 or so)<br/>5. Octave<br/>6. Instrument Voice (from the McGill University Master Sample CD-ROM<br/>&amp; some sound effects records for the breaking glass, sweeping,<br/>restaurant sounds)<br/>7. Stereo location (in the pan field)<br/>8. Envelope (allows control over attack, sustain, decay, release,<br/>crescendo &amp; decrescendo)<br/>9. Glissando (move up or down without a re-attack)<br/>10. Up-sample (pick a higher or lower sample than the one used to<br/>create the instrument. Helps to create a miniature piano, or a more<br/>mellow or strident trumpet)</p><p>When I get it sounding the way I want, I use Csound to &quot;convolve&quot; the<br/>sound with one of several chapel interiors from Angelo Farina<br/>(<a href="http://pcfarina.eng.unipr.it/">http://pcfarina.eng.unipr.it/</a>). I have been using Teatro Alcorcon in<br/>Madrid lately. Convolve is a digital signal processing algorithm that<br/>somehow takes a sound and makes it have the temporal characteristics<br/>of another sound. I use it for reverb effects, but others use it to<br/>filter.</p><p>Most of the characteristics of the instruments come from the McGill<br/>sample set, which was painstakingly put together by the recordists at<br/>McGill University several years ago. They wanted to create a perfect<br/>44 kHz stereo sample set for a sample based synthesizer that would<br/>some day come along with unlimited memory. (Like Csound!) The set is<br/>full of problems, inconsistencies, out of tune samples, empty<br/>beginnings and other things that make it a challenge to use for<br/>samplers. But with some care and feeding, it works great. I still<br/>can&apos;t get over the cello martele sample. Edgy.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p></div>
