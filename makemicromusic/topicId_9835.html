My ear (which tonight was apparently mired in<br/>&gt; 12-ET) was surprised and pleased by the low leading tones and pure<br/>&gt; M3&apos;s (all of course natural consequences of meantone).</p><p>Dear Harold,</p><p>Thank you very much for this response, which I&apos;ve just read on returning<br/>home from Los Angeles and checking my e-mail over the last four weeks. I&apos;m<br/>delighted that the intonation came across well, and your beautiful<br/>rendition of Willaert provided lots of inspiration for something using<br/>meantone.</p><p>Your comments suggest to me that the 12-note temperament I was using based<br/>on Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone has much the same sonorous effect as<br/>1/4-comma. Another trait of either tuning I really like -- and tying in<br/>with your comment about low leading tones -- is the contrast between<br/>wide regular diatonic and narrow chromatic semitones, really neat for<br/>Renaissance chromaticism and the like (e.g. C-C#-D or F-F#-G).</p><p>&gt; I also noted that you placed your &apos;instruments&apos; around the virtual<br/>&gt; space nicely, although I&apos;d have prefered an additional wind or string<br/>&gt; instrument somewhere on the left along with the harpsichord.</p><p>This is an area in which, frankly, I&apos;m just starting to learn, with your<br/>renditions (e.g. the fine use of aural space in the Willaert) as a nice<br/>model to consider. One of my starting points might be something like a<br/>two-manual organ; but the options to map any &quot;instrument&quot; on the TX-802 to<br/>either or both stereo output channels, for example, makes things, of<br/>course, much more intricate (or intricate in new ways). Also, there&apos;s the<br/>process of setting channel levels and balance on the mixer in the<br/>recording process.</p><p>Your remarks suggest to me an interesting experiment -- why don&apos;t I try it<br/>and comment more.</p><p>&gt; I think this is one of your best pieces--I&apos;m sure you&apos;d make Zarlino<br/>&gt; proud!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what makes this piece Lydian? I am likely limited in my conception<br/>&gt; of Lydian by the definition:<br/>&gt; &quot;a major scale, except that the 4th scale degree is raised 1/2 step&quot;<br/>&gt; (or F-f on white keys)</p><p>For the moment, I might quickly commment that while your definition is<br/>oriented to major/minor tonality as a point of reference, the 16th-century<br/>situation is in some ways parallel: people like Zarlino (and earlier<br/>Glareanus, whose theory Zarlino adopts as one basis for his own) note that<br/>the characteristic of true Lydian is a modality of F with regular use of<br/>the unaltered step B-natural. This doesn&apos;t exclude the use of Bb also; but<br/>if Bb is used as the regular form of this step (as indicated in the<br/>signature), then Zarlino and Glareanus regard this as a transposed Ionian<br/>(C-C, the same step pattern as a later major key).</p><p>The opening of the Intrada, for example, presents B-natural as a regular<br/>step (C4 here indicates middle C):</p><p>     1    2   +  | 1   2  | 1   +  +  2  | 1<br/>     F4   F4  G4   A4  A4   G4             A4<br/>     C4   D4  D4   F4  F4       E4 D4 E4   F4<br/>     A3   A3  B3   C4  C4   C4             C4<br/>     F3   D3  G3   F3  F3   C3             F4</p><p>Both Glareanus and Zarlino suggest that Lydian (F-F with B-natural as the<br/>usual step) is in modern practice the least common mode, since the Bb<br/>signature for pieces centering on F is so prevalent.</p><p>That&apos;s a quick version. Since I&apos;m accustomed to Lydian in a 13th-14th<br/>century setting (where its use under a definition like that of Glareanus<br/>or Zarlino is much more common), I found it fun to do something with this<br/>mode in a late 16th-century kind of setting (with meantone accidentalism<br/>as a creative element).</p><p>&gt; Best of luck with your mom. You might also consider alternate<br/>&gt; therapies--for example, I think it was Linus Pauling who apparently<br/>&gt; laughed himself to health when he had cancer.</p><p>Thank you -- I&apos;m happy to be returning home for a bit at a time when my<br/>Mom is doing very well: a recent PET scan was &quot;negative&quot; as to detected<br/>abnormal metabolic activity at tumor sites, which is exciting news. She<br/>has a wonderful sense of humor, and I&apos;m trying to lend her some extra<br/>encouragement.</p><p>Again, thank you so much both for inspiring this piece and for so<br/>graciously lending both your encouragement and your expertise on things<br/>like aural space and balance.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
