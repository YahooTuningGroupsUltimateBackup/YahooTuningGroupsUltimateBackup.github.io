A new application name, Custom Scale Editor (CSE), replaces Tuning Box Editor (TBXE) in order to emphasize exactly what this software does, to differentiate it from TPXE, and to give a clear indication that a TBX1 is not required to use this software. CSE is a free scale editor which imports Scala files and allows easy creation of alternative tunings. A new Live MIDI Input feature (available to registered TBX1 and Tonal Plexus owners) allows you to play MIDI on your keyboard or on the computer keyboard through CSE and TPXE, and route MIDI from external applications through the software to other external applications. This should be very useful for those of you working with software synthesizers who may have problems getting various applications working together with your physical MIDI interface. The Mac version also allows any SoundFont to be played microtonally.
