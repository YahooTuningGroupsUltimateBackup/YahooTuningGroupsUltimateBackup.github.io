And the<br/>interest in natural sounds, as sparked by Jacky Ligon and Jeff Scott<br/>reminded me of a quote I saw recently from one of our lifetime&apos;s<br/>truly singular and great people, Pauline Oliveros. As part of a<br/>background piece on her for a recent Los Angeles concert, there was<br/>this:</p><p>&quot;Pauline Oliveros is the originator of the concept of &quot;deep<br/>listening,&quot; a practice combining improvisation with meditation and<br/>the incorporation of environmental sounds into the space of<br/>performance. About the genesis of her practice she has<br/>written, &quot;Shortly after receiving the gift of my tape recorder in<br/>1953 I placed the microphone in the window of my San Francisco<br/>apartment and recorded the sound environment....although I thought<br/>that I was listening while recording I was surprised to find sounds<br/>on the tape that I had not heard consciously. With this discovery I<br/>gave myself a meditation: &quot;Listen to everything all the time and<br/>remind yourself when you are not listening&quot;.</p><p>Yes indeed.</p><p>With admiration for you all,<br/>Jon</p></div>
