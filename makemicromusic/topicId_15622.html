One can sort through a lot of things, and expose themselves to the panorama of tunings that exist (or can exist).

To a certain extent, this also means having absorbed the gestalt of his instrumental creations as well, but they all worked under one tuning umbrella, and the parts - for the most - seemed to be very natural extensions of both the tuning and the instrument is was written for. Had he spent time dabbling in dozens of tunings, I doubt this would have happened, and he would have had a far less cohesive output.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2007 1:15:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;At 08:32 PM 1/4/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I just posted something on the &quot;other&quot; list on this topic.  &quot;Stuck in a &gt;&gt;rut??&quot;  Possibly... or maybe the scale is just working for me and I &gt;&gt;need a lifetime to master it (as some might try to &quot;master&quot; 12-tET...??)<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think sticking to a scale is good approach -- you can get deeper<br/>&gt;into it.

I think a lot of it had to do with his deciding on a tuning system that met his compositional needs at a fairly early juncture, sticking with that system, and building up his arsenal (instrumental and compositional) around it. While Harry didn&apos;t really sit around improvising, he certainly *could* play almost all of his instruments well, and he had a very deep level of understanding on even those that he might not be totally swell on. He wasn&apos;t a great percussionist, but he sure as hell knew how one would approach his instruments.

Certainly not in the sense that any folk/jazz/etc musician sits around improvising. I&apos;m not saying that he didn&apos;t work _at_ the instruments when coming up with parts, but you could tell when he would go to play something that he had to work hard to recall what it was he had written, and the out-takes I have from many of his recording sessions show that once he had written a part, he had to practice it just like anyone else.</p><p>&gt;I disagree here as well.  There are microtonalists who have tried many different systems with good results in all of them.  This is because tuning is only one small part of music.</p><p>Total agreement with the last statement, certainly. And there are people like Lou Harrison who is so independently musical that he *is* able to work with a lot of, if similar, tunings. I still believe the best work comes from dedication to a smaller set of tunings, along with the fact that people can certainly write many pieces of music that all suck in just one intonation.

These go far beyond the portamenti tones on the strings with glass slides.  The adapted viola had brads at pitches outside of the 43-tone scale, perhaps a remnant of an earlier scheme, but present nonetheless,  In some scores, even the Chromelodeon is asked to switch reeds in the course of the piece. The diamond was indeed his basic harmonic environment, but he used many chords beyond those 12, including many chords that were not simple harmonic or subharmonic structure. The 43-tone scale was indeed the most &quot;chromatic&quot; (if you will) environment in his ensemble and was embodied by the tuning of Chromelodeon I and the Boos (and partially, on the Eucal Blossom), and was microtonal enough to similate a non-discrete portamento, but it was never really a &quot;scale&quot;, but a resource.</p><p>The more important point concerns the relationship between Partch&apos;s theoretical project and the role that theory played in his actual compositions.  With the exception of Dark Brother and perhaps parts of Ring Around the Moon, you cannot locate anything in Partch&apos;s music where he is strictly composing &quot;around the diamond&quot;.  His music had two impulses acting against this. The first was his early interest in setting the contours of the spoken voice. In one of the Psalm settings, one can hear a precisely-transcribed microtonal vocal line accompanied by near-random harmonies, as if he struggled within his&quot;monophonic fabric&quot; to find something, or anything, that would work.  The second impulse came with the introduction of percussion instruments and the largely instrumental character of his mature music.   His interests in rhythmic ideas, texture, and instrument-idiomatic patterning became, in many places in his music, much more important than any tonal design. While the percussion instruments did not go outside of his &quot;fabric&quot; of tones, his usage of those tones was often well beyond the uses implied by a just intonation ideal  (Kraig Grady&apos;s music, on the other hand, is much more strict about tonal practice).  At at least two point, Partch himself referred to his own music as atonal. Indeed, the are portions of Caston &amp; Pollux and Petals that are difficult to characterize in any other way.</p><p>We know all too little about Partch&apos;s compositional procedures, and his pre-compositional procedures in particular. We know, for example, that he came to Erv Wilson once with a problem in harmony -- he kept coming, intuitively to an odd combination of pitches. Wilson realized quickly that Partch was trying to approximate a modulation to the dominant!  Improvisation certainly played a role in his compositional practice, but this is true of most composers, just trying things out at the keyboard, mostly, but also, and increasingly, Partch&apos;s unique instrument designs created a demand that the composer actually compose at each individual instrument.   (One thinks of Stravinsky renting a cymbalon, at which he composed his _Ragtime_;  otherwise, Stravinsky always composed directly at his moderated (muted) piano).

These go far beyond the portamenti<br/>&gt;tones on the strings with glass slides.  The adapted viola had brads at<br/>&gt;pitches outside of the 43-tone scale, perhaps a remnant of an earlier<br/>&gt;scheme, but present nonetheless,  In some scores, even the Chromelodeon<br/>&gt;is asked to switch reeds in the course of the piece. The diamond was<br/>&gt;indeed his basic harmonic environment, but he used many chords beyond<br/>&gt;those 12, including many chords that were not simple harmonic or<br/>&gt;subharmonic structure. The 43-tone scale was indeed the most &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>&gt;(if you will) environment in his ensemble and was embodied by the tuning<br/>&gt;of Chromelodeon I and the Boos (and partially, on the Eucal Blossom),<br/>&gt;and was microtonal enough to similate a non-discrete portamento, but it<br/>&gt;was never really a &quot;scale&quot;, but a resource.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The more important point concerns the relationship between Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt;theoretical project and the role that theory played in his actual<br/>&gt;compositions.  With the exception of Dark Brother and perhaps parts of<br/>&gt;Ring Around the Moon, you cannot locate anything in Partch&apos;s music where<br/>&gt;he is strictly composing &quot;around the diamond&quot;.  His music had two<br/>&gt;impulses acting against this. The first was his early interest in<br/>&gt;setting the contours of the spoken voice. In one of the Psalm settings,<br/>&gt;one can hear a precisely-transcribed microtonal vocal line accompanied<br/>&gt;by near-random harmonies, as if he struggled within his&quot;monophonic<br/>&gt;fabric&quot; to find something, or anything, that would work.  The second<br/>&gt;impulse came with the introduction of percussion instruments and the<br/>&gt;largely instrumental character of his mature music.   His interests in<br/>&gt;rhythmic ideas, texture, and instrument-idiomatic patterning became, in<br/>&gt;many places in his music, much more important than any tonal design.<br/>&gt;While the percussion instruments did not go outside of his &quot;fabric&quot; of<br/>&gt;tones, his usage of those tones was often well beyond the uses implied<br/>&gt;by a just intonation ideal  (Kraig Grady&apos;s music, on the other hand, is<br/>&gt;much more strict about tonal practice).  At at least two point, Partch<br/>&gt;himself referred to his own music as atonal. Indeed, the are portions of<br/>&gt;Caston &amp; Pollux and Petals that are difficult to characterize in any<br/>&gt;other way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We know all too little about Partch&apos;s compositional procedures, and his<br/>&gt;pre-compositional procedures in particular. We know, for example, that<br/>&gt;he came to Erv Wilson once with a problem in harmony -- he kept coming,<br/>&gt;intuitively to an odd combination of pitches. Wilson realized quickly<br/>&gt;that Partch was trying to approximate a modulation to the dominant!<br/>&gt;Improvisation certainly played a role in his compositional practice, but<br/>&gt;this is true of most composers, just trying things out at the keyboard,<br/>&gt;mostly, but also, and increasingly, Partch&apos;s unique instrument designs<br/>&gt;created a demand that the composer actually compose at each individual<br/>&gt;instrument.
