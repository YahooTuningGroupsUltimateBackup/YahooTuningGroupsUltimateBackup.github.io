It<br/> was played live/real time using my 24 note-per-octave<br/> scale (extremely close to quartertone).</p><p> File name is:</p><p> C-F#xm-Ax-Ex</p><p> Basically it is a 20 second piece in piano that uses these<br/> 4 chords.<br/> (Had to keep the &quot;F#xm&quot; horizontal in the file name. This<br/>  is not how I do it really when I write chord progressions<br/>  down at home.) So if you are interested,the &apos;x&apos; means the<br/>  &apos;note above&apos;. That is Ax is the &apos;note&apos; above A. In this<br/>  case it would be the harmonic 7th. The &apos;m&apos; means the chord<br/>  is minor. Since this scale is closely related to quartertone<br/>  the major and minor and perfect fifth ratios are exactly the<br/>  same as in 12 EDO.</p><p>  C            is C major chord<br/>  F#xm         is minor chord that has root at about 661 cents<br/>  Ax           is major chord that has root at about 961 cents<br/>  Ex           is major chord that has root at about 461 cents</p><p>  Comments are welcome.</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p></div>
