I think the switch buttons could be a bit larger and distinct to the touch, but that&apos;s because i have large hands. The more I use this box the handier it gets. Here&apos;s how a typical recording session might go, using the R-09&apos;s built-in mics.</p><p>With the box held in the right hand, the index finger finds the power switch and push/holds it for more than one half second which powers up the unit. 4.5 seconds elapse to boot the box. Press the REC button, which then flashes red and the bargraph meters in the backlit LCD display indicate the recording level. If OK, press REC again and you&apos;re recording. That simple. If the level needs adjustment, the up/down buttons are under the second finger of your right hand, and the level can be adjusted even during recording so there&apos;s really no need to hesitate in pushing the REC button twice to start without consulting the level meters first.</p><p>When adjusting the input level a small window appears in the display showing a numerical value for the level setting, from 0 to 30, but this is only visible while pressing the level adjustment buttons. I&apos;d like it better if this information were available all the time during recording. Also this information, along with most of the other alphanumeric display windows, is very small. I&apos;ll repeat, very small. I have to use my reading glasses to see it.&quot;</p><p>Taken from the review at:<br/><a href="http://www.audiomidi.com/aboutus/reviews/yentis_r09.cfm">http://www.audiomidi.com/aboutus/reviews/yentis_r09.cfm</a></p><p>Remember: Google is your friend. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=14790 href="#14790">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2006 7:23:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;Does anybody know if this .wav/.mp3 recorder can change recording<br/>levels &quot;on the fly?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;It takes some practice to find the switches with your fingers,<br/>but it&apos;s really not that complicated and a few hours of daylight<br/>practice in the field should be enough to permit a recordist to use<br/>it in complete darkness.

Some (more expensive) home decks had<br/>it, but the portable recorders never did.  There was a hack for the<br/>MZ-R50, which I sold for a song before I knew about.</p><p>They recently changed their ways.  Here&apos;s the first portable<br/>recorder with uninhibited digital out:</p><p><a href="http://www.minidisco.com/Sony-MZ-RH1?sc=7&category=10">http://www.minidisco.com/Sony-MZ-RH1?sc=7&category=10</a></p><p>It&apos;s actually still inhibited -- it only does digital out for discs<br/>that are marked as having been recorded from the mic jack.  As opposed<br/>to from the digital in or at a factory (yes, they used to sell music<br/>on MD).  The units have always had S/PDIF (optical digital) *in* for<br/>making MD copies of CDs.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=14798 href="#14798">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2006 1:11:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; db,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;I always thought the MiniDisk was digital.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While it includes it&apos;s own a/d convertor, it is difficult to get a<br/>digital signal out of them, save for special cables that only talk<br/>to certain (and these days obsolete) pieces of gear.
