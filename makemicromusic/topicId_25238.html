It was more like Medieval discant style where the voices move in lock step rhythmically. braodly speaking, it&apos;s polyphony, but not in the way one usually talks about polyphony, or more specifically, counterpoint. For me, contrapuntal music has on the most abstract level, near complete rhythmic independance for each voice.</p><p>I want to also point out that there seems to be an underlying assumption that counterpoint=&quot;reminds me of Bach&quot;=&quot;good music&quot;. A typical mediocre student fugue, in my book, doesn&apos;t overshadow &quot;a priori&quot; a masterfully done ambient piece. Or, for that matter, a masterfully done monophonic piece.</p><p>(BTW, strictly speaking, when Bach writes a &apos;monophonic&apos; piece like a violin partita movement, he&apos;s really unfolding multiple levels of counterpoint. So I disagree with Daniel Forro&apos;s assessment that certain Preludes and Toccatas of Bach aren&apos;t contrapuntal. There is *always* counterpoint/voice leading in Bach; it&apos;s just not always obvious on a surface level, and if you&apos;ve ever studied voice leading analysis ala Heinrich Schenker, you&apos;ll know what I mean.)</p><p>Back to ambient, and &quot;soundscapey&quot;--if good ambient music were easy, we&apos;d see a lot more of it. Sure, you could argue that there is more a focus on sensual timbres, etc., but I think the very best of this kind of things is as rare as the best of anything else.</p><p>Anyway, what is &quot;soundscapey&quot;---is there a general agreement about what it means? Someone mentioned Monroe Golden&apos;s piece was soundscapey, and that seems to me far-fetched, at least by my understanding of what that term means, but maybe I have the &quot;wrong&quot; definition. To me, Golden&apos;s piece is more like textural polyphony ala Ligeti, but a bit thinner than Ligeti tends to be. I would say that Golden&apos;s piece is somewhere between homophonic and polyphonic in conception. Melody is obviously not the large concern, but certainly there is rhythmic motion on many levels, and harmony via a chord progression.</p><p>When I think &quot;soundscape&quot; I think mostly of musique concrete, etc, and nothing to me from this competition fits that label. And I think &quot;ambient&quot; refers to a kind of mostly beatless slow-moving drone type music, often devoid of melody as well. I thinkg Dave Seidel&apos;s work is most often ambient. Lots of Kraig Grady&apos;s work I think could fit this description as well, like I mentioned---the &apos;Stolen Stars&apos; disc.</p><p>In the competition, I would say James Wyness and Soressa Garnder&apos;s pieces have a definite &quot;ambient&quot; nature, in that they &quot;take their time&quot;, and timbral elements come to the fore. Gardner&apos;s piece has an additional motivic/melodic element, too, which makes it harder to pin a label on.</p><p>AKJ</p></div><h3><a id=25242 href="#25242">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2011 9:19:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My two cents on the conversation(s) that happened earlier--<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl had a good list on the types of monophonic thru contrapuntal conceptions, but I would disagree except by the very broadest definition that Gene&apos;s piece was contrapuntal in the Bach sense.

It still doesn&apos;t sound like there&apos;s much in the way of rhythmic independence of the voices at all even remotely resembling the kind of complex poly-metrical or poly-rhythmic layering one sees in Ars Subtilior music. To me, it still was more loosely like discant, b/c the voices move in lock-step.<br/>To restate, it&apos;s polyphonic in an entry-level definition sense, but not &quot;highly contrapuntal&quot; a la Bach or Ockeghem.</p><p>I&apos;d be curious to see what you would do in a &quot;neo-subtilior&quot; style, though.

What I meant is either</p><p>A) With no obvious chords (don&apos;t matter if the chords are just or not).  BTW, if<br/>the chords are so drowned out by effects or timbre or dissonance you can&apos;t tell<br/>what they are...that also counts as &quot;no chords&quot;<br/>B) With no obvious motifs or leads in melody (IE nothing hummable or easily<br/>track-able)<br/>C) With almost no obvious verses...usually one part and/or two parts but with a<br/>vast majority of the song being only one part<br/>...and usually...<br/>D) Based more on texture than anything else IE fairly &quot;Ambient&quot;<br/>E) Avant Garde...and the side fact the groups that make it very rarely get<br/>enough popularity to perform live (either playing themselves or getting played<br/>by a DJ), even at very small venues.  If they pop up at all...it&apos;s usually in<br/>things like B movies, and people who buy soundtracks for those are few and far<br/>inbetween.</p><p>    The most obvious black and white example would be an acoustic pop/folk song<br/>vs. something from Brian Eno would make.  Ambient and &quot;sound-scapey&quot; often go<br/>hand in hand.  Avant Garde music is most often sound-scapey, and soundtracks are<br/>sometimes sound scapey.  But virtually nothing on the radio, at least in<br/>America, has ever been &quot;sound scapey&quot;...and during the 5 years I lived in<br/>Holland I never heard anything over there truly &quot;Soundscapey&quot;.</p><p>    I guess you could say my point is...making music that&apos;s so abstract,<br/>regardless of how wide a so-called &quot;vision&quot; it shows...is VERY VERY unlikely to<br/>ever gain much public momentum.  I never have heard anything like Monroe,<br/>Soressa, Joseph Post, or even Igliashon&apos;s piece (far as style) get any sort of<br/>mass publicity.  The closest thing I&apos;ve seen get fairly far is Brian Eno&apos;s work<br/>or some of the most abstract lounge music...but even stuff like Brian&apos;s work has<br/>much more obvious melodic and structural elements/verse than most of the work<br/>I&apos;ve seen in the Untwelve competition IE it&apos;s not as &quot;soundscapey&quot;.</p><p>    Don&apos;t get me wrong, a lot of the Untwelve work is very &quot;academically<br/>advanced&quot; and I can see clearly the amount of skill involved.<br/>But my point is, that alone matters little.   Having &quot;academically advanced&quot; as<br/>a goal often causes people to completely miss the universal goal in music of not<br/>skill or &quot;futurism&quot;, but fresh forms of emotional connection: it&apos;s like the guy<br/>at a beach party wearing a really impressively done Eskimo suit he knitted<br/>himself.</p><p>   As I read Igs&apos;s interview quote, he seems to echo this</p><p>Igs in his Untwelve Interview&gt;&quot;too much of the  scant music that exists is of an<br/>academically-expository nature,  lacking in artistic depth (and I include the<br/>vast majority of my own  microtonal music under this criticism). &quot;</p><p>    To be blatantly honest, part of me doesn&apos;t give a hoot about how<br/>&quot;academically advanced&quot; or &quot;daring&quot; any of us do if, out of the hundreds of us<br/>who compose...we can&apos;t even get a handful of us to write music I can manage to<br/>convince people of as &quot;well written &apos;normal&apos; music&quot;.  I can admire it far as<br/>knowledge, but not so far as emotional connectivity.   There&apos;s nothing I could<br/>even hand a DJ and have him give me a straight face about playing it....heck I<br/>doubt someone would even dare to play it as supermarket background music (even<br/>that junk, primitive as it is, seems to have more identifiable structure, and<br/>even identifiable emotion, then most of this).  And that, I think...is truly<br/>embarrassing.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=25248 href="#25248">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2011 10:43:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d be curious to see what you would do in a &quot;neo-subtilior&quot; style, though.

The other thing is...in<br/>the part where one and not two voices (different instruments) lead over a<br/>bassline and string backup (all on separate rhythms)...how are those parts not<br/>polyphonic?</p><p>&gt;&quot; To me, Golden&apos;s piece is more like textural polyphony ala Ligeti, but a bit<br/>&gt;thinner than Ligeti tends to be. &quot;</p><p>  The focus on textural and not clearly distinguishable notes within the voices<br/>that form the chords, IMVHO, is what makes it ambient.  Textured chords, to me,<br/>come across a whole lot more like timbres than individual notes.</p><p>   Tons of ambient music, mind you, has chords...but when they come, they comes<br/>in forms that are so &quot;blended&quot; and &quot;textural&quot;...they can almost be confused with<br/>timbres.  A good litmus test for that sort of thing is to give it to an<br/>experienced musician and have them figure out the underlying chords by ear....if<br/>they struggle, it&apos;s likely &quot;sound-scapey&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think ambient music is easy.  However I do think it&apos;s easier to use<br/>&gt;microtonally.&quot;</p><p>  I agree with what Cameron said on this...that using microtonallity as &quot;texture<br/>only&quot; is essentially a cop-out to keep the composer from facing the challenge of<br/>making microtonality work in non-timbre-like context.

Something I could hand over to my brother, a professional jazz<br/>&gt; guitarist, or the average listener and at least have them say &quot;that was decent&quot;<br/>&gt; if not good...would work.  A good example: Aerosmith.  A lot of people don&apos;t<br/>&gt; particularly like their stuff...but just about anyone would at least say they<br/>&gt; know what they are doing far as making emotional connection to listeners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Look up Sevish on <a href="http://Youtube.com">Youtube.com</a>...and note that he wasn&apos;t even in the top 50%<br/>&gt; in your last Untwelve competition...yet comments on his music show respect among<br/>&gt; general listeners<br/>&gt; &quot;Decent track for sure, the acid lines are slick... well&iuml;&raquo;&iquest; it&apos;s all slick<br/>&gt; really...!&quot;<br/>&gt; &quot;Definitely different. Sounds&iuml;&raquo;&iquest; good.&quot;<br/>&gt; &quot;Good experimental stuff&quot;<br/>&gt; ...............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Right now, if microtonality were even as popular and oft-performed as Messiaen,<br/>&gt; &gt;that would be a step in the right direction.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    True but this goes right back to my main gripe...that we&apos;re trying to<br/>&gt; &quot;popularize&quot; microtonal music by pleasing academics....which seems to be a<br/>&gt; straight line to capturing the attention of the, say, .01% of classical music<br/>&gt; fans into microtonality where classical music fans represent 5% of the<br/>&gt; population.  It&apos;s like training your arms in insanely hard workout trying to win<br/>&gt; a rowing race and then running the rowing race in a wooden barrel...great amount<br/>&gt; of skill but toward an obtuse goal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Meanwhile, it seems anyone who chooses to lean toward actual genres and styles<br/>&gt; that have significant respect among virtually all musicians (say, classic-style<br/>&gt; rock)  get thrown aside.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;That said, I see no problem with microtonal boy bands, as long as they  add a<br/>&gt; &gt;level of thought absent from them as per typical. Maybe the  addition of<br/>&gt; &gt;microtones would mean they start at a higher level of  thought from the get-go,<br/>&gt; &gt;who knows?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     True but, come to think of it, I think a genuine class pop/rock style band<br/>&gt; would get more attention.  The point is not that really abstract music is<br/>&gt; bad...but that it frustrates me how few people here seem to be looking at the<br/>&gt; issue of respect in the musical community so far as emotion conveyed...and how<br/>&gt; many just run an academic litmus test to see how &quot;advanced&quot; a piece is<br/>&gt; regardless of how much of its emotional effect is clear upon the first few<br/>&gt; listens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Say you put a boombox playing music on the street and watched the reaction of<br/>&gt; people walking by...is anyone moving to it, who is covering their ears...and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; pretty sure you&apos;ll see the problem.  Now many people likely wouldn&apos;t be jumping<br/>&gt; up and down over, say, Aerosmith...put they wouldn&apos;t be covering their ears or<br/>&gt; saying &quot;what the....is THAT?&quot; either...they&apos;d at least, well, respect it as<br/>&gt; emotionally identifiable as  music, even if shallow music. :-D  Heck, even with<br/>&gt; Vanilla Ice, you&apos;d get people moving...not because it&apos;s good...but because it<br/>&gt; has obvious structure/flow to both the melodies and beat.  You just can&apos;t get<br/>&gt; that with something that&apos;s too abstract,,,,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=25275 href="#25275">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2011 3:26:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I looked at the score of the midi file.

Strauss, or many developmental moments  in the<br/>&gt; many symphonies by Mahler...and I don&apos;t think this is what you  mean. I think<br/>&gt; you really mean to conflate two things: micro-polyphony (e.g.  Ligeti,<br/>&gt; Pendrecki, Lutoslwaski) and ambient (Briano Eno, Aphex Twin,  Robert Rich). They<br/>&gt; are very different phenomena, and should be  distinguished as such, in my book.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Firstly, I listened to Messiaen and the chords can still be made out clearly<br/>&gt; vs. a whole lot of the stuff in the competition...though I agree it&apos;s hard<br/>&gt; enough to elicit a &quot;what the...&quot; response from a whole lot of people.  Actually<br/>&gt; I&apos;d say Eno and Rich are probably a lot more &quot;digestible&quot; to most people as they<br/>&gt; have distinct themes: sometimes such themes involve repeated rhythmic patterns<br/>&gt; rather than motif...but there is definitely a sense of order there.   It&apos;s hard<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;THe other thing is &quot;popular to whom?&quot; If we want popular to 18-year old  girls<br/>&gt; &gt;in shopping malls, we&apos;d get microtonal boy bands as had been  mentioned.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Indeed.  When I say popular, I simply mean &quot;respected by average musicians<br/>&gt; and listeners&quot;.  Something I could hand over to my brother, a professional jazz<br/>&gt; guitarist, or the average listener and at least have them say &quot;that was decent&quot;<br/>&gt; if not good...would work.  A good example: Aerosmith.  A lot of people don&apos;t<br/>&gt; particularly like their stuff...but just about anyone would at least say they<br/>&gt; know what they are doing far as making emotional connection to listeners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Look up Sevish on <a href="http://Youtube.com">Youtube.com</a>...and note that he wasn&apos;t even in the top 50%<br/>&gt; in your last Untwelve competition...yet comments on his music show respect among<br/>&gt; general listeners<br/>&gt; &quot;Decent track for sure, the acid lines are slick... well&iuml;&raquo;&iquest; it&apos;s all slick<br/>&gt; really...!&quot;<br/>&gt; &quot;Definitely different. Sounds&iuml;&raquo;&iquest; good.&quot;<br/>&gt; &quot;Good experimental stuff&quot;<br/>&gt; ...............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Right now, if microtonality were even as popular and oft-performed as Messiaen,<br/>&gt; &gt;that would be a step in the right direction.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    True but this goes right back to my main gripe...that we&apos;re trying to<br/>&gt; &quot;popularize&quot; microtonal music by pleasing academics....which seems to be a<br/>&gt; straight line to capturing the attention of the, say, .01% of classical music<br/>&gt; fans into microtonality where classical music fans represent 5% of the<br/>&gt; population.  It&apos;s like training your arms in insanely hard workout trying to win<br/>&gt; a rowing race and then running the rowing race in a wooden barrel...great amount<br/>&gt; of skill but toward an obtuse goal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Meanwhile, it seems anyone who chooses to lean toward actual genres and styles<br/>&gt; that have significant respect among virtually all musicians (say, classic-style<br/>&gt; rock)  get thrown aside.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;That said, I see no problem with microtonal boy bands, as long as they  add a<br/>&gt; &gt;level of thought absent from them as per typical. Maybe the  addition of<br/>&gt; &gt;microtones would mean they start at a higher level of  thought from the get-go,<br/>&gt; &gt;who knows?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     True but, come to think of it, I think a genuine class pop/rock style band<br/>&gt; would get more attention.  The point is not that really abstract music is<br/>&gt; bad...but that it frustrates me how few people here seem to be looking at the<br/>&gt; issue of respect in the musical community so far as emotion conveyed...and how<br/>&gt; many just run an academic litmus test to see how &quot;advanced&quot; a piece is<br/>&gt; regardless of how much of its emotional effect is clear upon the first few<br/>&gt; listens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Say you put a boombox playing music on the street and watched the reaction of<br/>&gt; people walking by...is anyone moving to it, who is covering their ears...and I&apos;m<br/>&gt; pretty sure you&apos;ll see the problem.  Now many people likely wouldn&apos;t be jumping<br/>&gt; up and down over, say, Aerosmith...put they wouldn&apos;t be covering their ears or<br/>&gt; saying &quot;what the....is THAT?&quot; either...they&apos;d at least, well, respect it as<br/>&gt; emotionally identifiable as  music, even if shallow music. :-D  Heck, even with<br/>&gt; Vanilla Ice, you&apos;d get people moving...not because it&apos;s good...but because it<br/>&gt; has obvious structure/flow to both the melodies and beat.

Inevitably, this is coming from people whose music is a montage of cliches- complete slaves to theory without even realizing it. And that idea stinks because it prevents people from recognizing the superb achievement of, say, Ornette Coleman, in the &quot;intellectual&quot; avatar of music.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well said, you are right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 6 Feb 2011, at 9:47 PM, cameron wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not saying that there is no technical aspect to music- far from<br/>&gt; &gt; it. I&apos;m saying that the technical aspects and emotion, message,<br/>&gt; &gt; etc. are ultimately &quot;as one&quot;. They can&apos;t be seperated, except<br/>&gt; &gt; provisionally, in the process of making the music, or in analizing it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Put it this way: let&apos;s start changing notes and rhythms in a Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; piece. These are only &quot;technical&quot; differences, and according to the<br/>&gt; &gt; logic of people who think grimacing while noodling minor<br/>&gt; &gt; pentatonics constitutes &quot;soul&quot;, they can&apos;t make a difference. They<br/>&gt; &gt; are only &quot;technical&quot;! And perhaps for a few changes, these<br/>&gt; &gt; alterations won&apos;t make a difference in feeling etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But we keep going, changing notes and rhythms. In certain ways,<br/>&gt; &gt; the identity of the piece might be suprisingly durable, depending<br/>&gt; &gt; on the changes you make. You can deliberately swap all minors and<br/>&gt; &gt; majors in a piece (probably most of us have done this when we were<br/>&gt; &gt; young :-) ) and find that the piece remains somehow recognizable,<br/>&gt; &gt; if you don&apos;t change the rhythm, because the percieved structure of<br/>&gt; &gt; a piece isn&apos;t completely dependent on that single technical aspect.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The emotions the piece invokes are going to change quite quickly<br/>&gt; &gt; though, whatever &quot;technical&quot; changes you make. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; &gt; make very many &quot;technical&quot; changes at all to completely change the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;feeling&quot; of piece. Just altering the &quot;swing&quot;  of a four-four beat,<br/>&gt; &gt; on a micro-temporal level, can radically change the feeling. The<br/>&gt; &gt; technical differences can be in the milliseconds and the feeling is<br/>&gt; &gt; different.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The technical and the emotional are inseperable.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you don&apos;t think music has intellectual and technical aspect, why<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; do you use heterophony ... ornamentation ... rhythm ... voicing ...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; contour ... intervals ... notes ... major second ... third ... multi-<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tracking ...
