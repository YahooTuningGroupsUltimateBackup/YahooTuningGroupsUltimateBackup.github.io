The first synth is tuned to 19tet, second a 5-note sub-group of 22 (see note below), both loaded directly from Scala .scl files. I play the scale on the first, and then five note scale patterns on the second, and then both at the same time (all using the sequencer). Select both tracks and export to audio (this is the DAW version of &quot;mixing down&quot;).</p><p>That is all there is to it. You can plainly hear two different tunings (as well as two different sounds), and there are no external processors used - all reverb and delay is from the z3ta+ patches themselves. I believe this should answer your question(s)...</p><p>[Note from above: this is an EXAMPLE, and tunings were chosen arbitrarily to show a blatant difference between the instances of the synth. This is *NOT* a piece of music, and don&apos;t ever accuse me of saying it is/was!! :) ]</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6176 href="#6176">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2004 8:49:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
