This way, the octave becomes<br/>our natural period, and when pitches are viewed as on a circle, we are<br/>seeing a literal analog to the way leaves on many plants grow to maximize<br/>their exposure to sunlight...via the Fibonacci sequence. IOW, many plant<br/>leaves grow at angles which relate to each other by 2*3.1415/phi radians,<br/>maximizing their potential NOT to be blocked by higher layers as the plant<br/>grows. It&apos;s called the &apos;golden angle&apos; relationship.</p><p><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/27890/applications5.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/27890/applications5.html</a></p><p>One can derive scales from &apos;Fibonacci EDOs&apos; : 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55...<br/>I like 34. Interestingly, MOS scales occur when the subset is also a<br/>fibonacci number.</p><p>My current favorite is &apos;8of34 MOS&apos;:<br/>5 5 3 5 5 3 5 3 or L L s L L s L s</p><p>You can of course play around with the various rotations (modes) and get<br/>different moods and effects.</p><p>Having 8 notes in the scale is nice: more possibilities than 5, but less<br/>tension and information than 13 and up....it seems to be a sweet spot, just<br/>slightly more information than a typical diatonic scale. Try it!</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
