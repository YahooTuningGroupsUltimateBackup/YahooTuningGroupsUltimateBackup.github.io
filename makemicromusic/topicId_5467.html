But it is a lot of work, maybe<br/>some of the big companies will manage it first; surely they will<br/>if there is enough incentive to do so. Really needs a team of<br/>programmers, or one programmer who dedicates a number of years<br/>to it.</p><p>My plan is to start with a simple piano roll type layout<br/>with the scale ratios or cents values at the left, and<br/>maybe gradually develop it from there.</p><p>However, you can use your sequencer and retune it<br/>in another app such as FTS. Have you given this<br/>way of working a try? It isn&apos;t so hard.</p><p>Just install a loopback such as Midi Yoke,<br/>or for Win 2K / Xp / NT, if you use Giga, better to use<br/>Maple Tools from Marble Sound:<br/><a href="http://www.marblesound.com/">http://www.marblesound.com/</a></p><p>This lets you use all the existing capabilities of your sequencer,<br/>but microtonally. E.g. if it has a piano roll type layout,<br/>well now that can be a microtonal piano roll. Depending on your<br/>settings in your retuning programm e.g. Note 60 say is the 1/1,<br/>note 61 is the scale degree 1, 62 is degree 2 etc.</p><p>Or if you use notation software use that. As you enter notes on<br/>the score, you hear them played as you normally do - but now they<br/>are played in your chosen tuning rather than in twelve equal.</p><p>The way I usually work is to make a keyboard score. This shows<br/>a normal 12 equal layout, but the notes shown on the score<br/>indicate to the player which keys to use to play the score<br/>from a suitably tuned keyboard, rather than indicating<br/>the pitches used. This is by far the easiest score<br/>for a keyboard player to play from as you have nothing new to<br/>learn by way of hand / eye coordination.</p><p>Ideally a microtonal notation program should allow both<br/>- a keyboard player&apos;s score and a score with special<br/>symbols and microtonal accidentals for players of<br/>other instruments.</p><p>However, I don&apos;t have it in mind to develop such, certainly<br/>not straight away. A basic piano roll type sequencer, play through once, no flow control<br/>very simple, not much support for controllers, that is the kind of<br/>thing I have in mind to start with. Have to start somewhere.</p><p>To develop a fully featured sequencer would be a matter of a<br/>number of years probably. So basically the reason no-one has<br/>done it is simply the amount of time needed to program it<br/>- and considering that there are work arounds that let one<br/>compose microtonally already, then there isn&apos;t really so<br/>great an incentive to do it. After all that time, who knows,<br/>maybe you might get ten people buy it?? So how much would<br/>one charge for it?? Well if it is really excellent maybe<br/>then you will get lots of buyers, but then that needs<br/>even more time, and probably you will get scooped by one of<br/>the big companies too if there really is so much support for<br/>microtonal work by then as they can afford to employ a team<br/>of programmers, who will naturally get the work done<br/>much faster... So one needs to find stepping stones<br/>along the way to a microtonal sequencer - smaller more<br/>limited programs that are easier to develop, also interesting<br/>to develop, and that will generate a few sales to let one continue - or else<br/>you do it out of enthusiasm for it when you have the time<br/>to do soem work on it.</p><p>As a result it is something I have a mind to do but as I am<br/>doing this as a business, it is low priority. I plan<br/>to start with a piano roll edit for polyphonic seeds<br/>for the fractal tunes in FTS as that is a simple situation in which<br/>there is a clear need for it, fairly easy to program as one<br/>only needs to program the note ons and offs with no frills,<br/>and will be useful to the algo-comp users of FTS. So that<br/>is my first (next) stepping stone. But I imagine it will<br/>be a fair while before it is anything like as useful as<br/>the method of retuning the output from ones current<br/>sequencing program, or the methods involving retuning<br/>a synth or keyboard and using that.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
