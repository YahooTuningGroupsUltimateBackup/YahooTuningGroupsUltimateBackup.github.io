Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2004 11:17:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Listos,</p><p>I&apos;ve been remiss in not taking the time to publicly accolade all over Dan Stearns for his recent works. Dan, you&apos;ve always been a breath of fresh air, and all of your newest music making is threatening to turn the breath into at least a breeze, if not a downright gust (mind you, a very non-agressive gust).</p><p>I love that you approach music on *its* terms, as witnessed by the extremely different nature of the meditation on the Universe Symphony (&quot;no more next time&quot;) and the more recent 11edo piece, &quot;Over the Rivers&quot;. Dan, I&apos;m not sure what you are doing these days, and I&apos;d be the last to prod you on the technical details, but these don&apos;t sound like pieces you did on the computers down at the library!</p><p>The synth piece (using standard GM soundcard playback, I&apos;m guessing) reminds me a lot of the ensemble pieces that Frank Zappa did with his Synclavier, and I say that in context: I&apos;ve been listening to a couple of recordings of the Ensemble Moderne, where they have transcribed these pieces and perform them live - what I&apos;d give for that to happen for you (AFMM, maybe?).</p><p>But I always have a fondness for found sound music (&quot;foundness&quot;?) that your meditation reminds me of. You have such a fine grasp of sonic narative, and I love the gentle flow of the piece. The overlapping is a fine tribute to Ive&apos;s multi-layered approach to rhythm and other musical components. But most of all, this piece reminds me of your *writings*, which I have a few collected, especially your descriptions of places in New England where you&apos;ve been.</p><p>Dang, you didn&apos;t do another Jacky-collab on this piece, did you? :)</p><p>Keep it up, Dan. You seem like a self-powered rocket, ready to cross the next boundary...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2004 6:57:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks so much for the kind words Jon,they&apos;re much appreciated.<br/>Because of something you wrote me I&apos;ve decided to post this is a<br/>brief bit about the pieces I have up at:</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>This puts them in some order regarding when they were recorded and<br/>what they are and whether or not they are microtonal in content.<br/>Thanks again, dan</p><p>The Housatonic at Stockbridge<br/>Charles Ives--composer Dan Stearns--guitar synth, keyboard and<br/>arrangement<br/>An early 90s microtonal experiment that directly led to what I still<br/>consider to be my best piece, Day Walks In.</p><p>no more next time!<br/>Dan Stearns--guitar,bass Mike Sedadrums<br/>This was an early 90s collaboration with 17-year-old Bronx, NY<br/>drummer Mike Seda, and a mini homage to Hendrix.</p><p>ballad<br/>Dan Stearns  classical guitar Colin Malakie  bass Pete Zolli  drums<br/>Taken from a live mid 80s radio gig with the band Vertigo.</p><p>miniature no. 1<br/>Dan Stearns  classical guitar Jim Capone  Bb and bass clarinets<br/>In the mid 80s I wrote 30 duets for poet Michel Duncan Merle&apos;s book<br/>of cut poems, I have no deadlines.
