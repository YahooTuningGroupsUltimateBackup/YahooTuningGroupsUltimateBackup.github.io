As most of you will know, &gt; Praat can nowadays be downloaded freely from <a href="http://www.praat.org">www.praat.org</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There have been several big changes since 4.0, which was &gt; released in October 2001:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. There is an edition for MacOS X. This is preferred over the &gt; classical Macintosh editions, which were not capable of using &gt; all of the memory in your computer. Scripting geeks may like to &gt; know that they can use Unix commands and Unix-style path names.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Speech pathology: fully documented jitter, shimmer, and &gt; voice break measurements, directly available in the Sound &gt; window (and they are much more accurate than in that other &gt; program you have been using). The Voice tutorial overrides the &gt; discussions that you may have seen on the Praat Discussion List.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. Listening experiments: full support for identification and &gt; discrimination experiments, portable across platforms! Read the &gt; Experiment tutorial.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. Spectral slices become visible in the Sound window with a &gt; single mouse click (or Command-S).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5. Graphics: improved spectrograms on PostScript printers &gt; (explicit interpolation; no stripes anymore).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6. Manual: a rewritten Intro, which is the main tutorial. &gt; Manual searches are case-insensitive now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7. Scripting: many more possibilities to look directly into &gt; objects, and to use variables in formulas. Also the &quot;include&quot; &gt; statement, and functions to look up information in long &gt; strings. Note: if you use the sendpraat subroutine in your own &gt; C program, download a new version if you use Windows 2000 or XP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8. Optimality-Theoretic learning: interpretive parsing and &gt; learning from overt forms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9. David&apos;s gender changer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10. And lots of smaller improvements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best wishes,<br/>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Boersma<br/>&gt; Institute of Phonetic Sciences, University of Amsterdam<br/>&gt; Herengracht 338, 1016CG Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/">http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/</a><br/>&gt; phone +31-20-5252385<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To Post a message, send it to:   praat-users@...<br/>&gt; To Unsubscribe, send a blank message to: praat-users-<br/>&gt; unsubscribe@...<br/>&gt; To consult archives :&#x9;         <a href="http://egroups.com/list/praat-users/">http://egroups.com/list/praat-users/</a></p></div>
