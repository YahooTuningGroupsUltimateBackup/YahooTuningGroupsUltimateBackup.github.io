I&apos;m not familiar with Chris Squire&apos;s work<br/>beyond Yes - so that is a very surprising comment.<br/>My feeling is that, as usual after letting it out, the mix sounds too<br/>cluttered until about half way through the song.<br/>I need to *simplify* *simplify* for blues / rock music.</p><p>However, I was pleased I hit so few bad notes on the fretless. Unlike midi<br/>its a pain to fix bum notes - and at times can&apos;t even be done. Since this is<br/>in a non-12 equal tuning correction of audio presents a real challenge. I<br/>only messed with the frequency of one vocal note. As I remember I reset that<br/>back to the original anyway.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Dec 20, 2010 at 9:17 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds like something off a Chris Squire album, including the<br/>&gt; vocals.

The standards you/Carl site may have been<br/>true 30 years ago...but now are very rarely accepted (IE no one will buy<br/>anything with Beatles-level crappy production quality...unless it is itself old<br/>and classic IE an actual Beatles recording).  Even something like Herbie<br/>Hancock&apos;s old material rarely gets touched nowadays...it&apos;s like trying to<br/>convince today&apos;s kids to enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 without instantly turning it<br/>down due to shoddy graphics.</p><p>&gt;&quot;More than a few folks here make &quot;professional sounding&quot; music.<br/>Here is just one recent example off the top of my head:<br/><a href="http://www.seraph.it/dep/det/AutumnalModulations.mp3">http://www.seraph.it/dep/det/AutumnalModulations.mp3</a>&quot;</p><p>   It&apos;s a beautifully produced song and very clear...but the instrument used<br/>seem obviously not strong enough.  IE I&apos;m sure a few DJs I know (including those<br/>who play some lounge music) would listen to this plenty on their own time...but<br/>be embarrassed to play it live due to some of the Casio-like<br/>sounds/instruments.  Nowadays using tons of layered drum hits, songs with<br/>instruments each programmed from scratch and then filtered and then multi-tap<br/>delayed then compressed and much more...is considered standard.  Production<br/>quality standards nowadays requires every single instrument to sound<br/>monsterous-ly strong and not just very clear...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Many, if not most professional producers keep lo-fidelity speakers at hand to<br/>&gt;test their mixes.  It&apos;s a very common practice, precisely because what works on<br/>&gt;fine studio monitors doesn&apos;t always translate.&quot;</p><p>    Believable...but if they don&apos;t do both (high and low fidelity speaker<br/>testing)...they risk things like either getting strong low-bass (under 60hz)<br/>with missing mid bass (90-200hz) for testing only on high fidelity speakers<br/>(think a car stereo with sub woofers) or the other way around for low-fi<br/>speakers (think a car stereo without sub woofers).<br/>  One way I&apos;ve found to hack this, to an extent is to do a spectrum analysis on<br/>the track (in Audacity/free software) and make sure the lows (90hz down to 40hz<br/>or so), flatten between -5db and 3db.  This is essential to hit both the low<br/>bass areas of hi-fidelity live venue PA systems  and mid-bass areas of typical<br/>car stereos.<br/>    Then check of the highs between about 6khz and 18khz are steadily around<br/>-30db on the analyzer.  Many professional songs are able to hit these loudness<br/>levels (or higher, some nail the highs at up to -20db!)...just drag any<br/>professional electronic musician&apos;s CD release if you don&apos;t believe me.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23965 href="#23965">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2010 9:24:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>You and Marcel both seem to be to be promoting a one-size-fits-all concept of music.

The only two that I think come decently close are EWQL and<br/>VSL, which in my experience are a joke for microtuning.

It&apos;s absurd.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Wallow in your limitations, because as much as anything they define your aesthetic voice.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael&lt;djtrancendance@&gt;   wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marcel&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No offense meant at all, but even if the music/notes itself were suitable for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a general public, the sound / mix isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&apos;m hearing that without exception for all the music posted here by list<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; members.

Now, I know you have a preference for hearing common<br/>&gt; &gt; practice music tuned to more optimal meantones than 12-equal. If you<br/>&gt; &gt; are making a clear-cut distinction between ideas and presentation,<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t your meantone retunings fall into the presentation side of<br/>&gt; &gt; it? If you insist on using optimal tunings then why not optimal<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds (in some sense)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are two issues involved in tuning. One is the issue of a certain kind of quality of sound as such, which is what you are talking about. The other is an issue of intelligibility; a different tuning simply says something different, and it doesn&apos;t need to be taken as far as some people seem to think to start changing the meaning. If I tried to retune the kinds of things I write into 12 equal, all the meaning would be squeezed right out of them, and I never would have been able to write them that way in the first place in any case. I like retuning things precisely because I like to hear how the meaning of the music changes, and what about it stays the same.</p><p>One thing that is destroyed in 12-equal is the distinction between<br/>diatonic and chromatic semitones which I find surprisingly<br/>meaningful. I guess that is the sort of thing you are talking about.<br/>But I think we can make similar comparisons with the choice of sounds<br/>too, don&apos;t you think? Often a musical passage gets a different<br/>meaning depending on the instrumentation, if it is played on an organ<br/>or a piano for example. But the exact brand of the instrument is less<br/>important. The performance can completely destroy the meaning though.<br/>I have in mind certain fashionable playing styles where the player<br/>lingers on the first beat of the bar and accelerates the tempo after<br/>that. Sounds narcissistic and distracts from the music. Makes<br/>me almost prefer sequenced MIDI files instead.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=23990 href="#23990">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2010 6:12:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Are you, perchance, addressing to me or to Igs?</p><p>Oz.</p><p>--</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; It looked to me like you were both saying the same thing,<br/>&gt; so I&apos;m not sure why the disagreement.  -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Whatever you say my dear Igs.

Things like having an<br/>orchestral and premium recording microphones, an electronic music studio with<br/>premium software and a fortune in samples and good enough<br/>sound-mastering/arranging expertise to keep overtones in different instrument<br/>parts from competing for frequency space (and often to keep overall loudness on<br/>par with major-label releases).  I look at this aspect again in B) below...</p><p>  Drawing from what Mike B and Igs were saying about microphone and instrument<br/>quality being essential, though (something I agree with)...would it be fair to<br/>say that people would qualify professional music (at least for classical and<br/>electric):<br/>  A) It&apos;s in key and with perfect instrument timing<br/>  B) The instruments and mixing sound like they came out of a professional<br/>studio with a &quot;larger than life&quot; sound<br/>  C) The overall feel is very confident, almost as if &quot;the musician could play<br/>it in his/her sleep&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Despite the fact that for example royalties are artificially balanced by<br/>&gt;Author&apos;s Association and I have much more money in  royalties for orchestral<br/>&gt;symphony (which is performed only once) than  for pop song or incidental music<br/>&gt;or even jazz work (with many  performances).&quot;</p><p>    Admittedly I do not have the faintest clue how payments for orchestral<br/>symphonies work...could you tell me why orchestral symphonies make more?</p><p>   And indeed (you&apos;re right), I&apos;d think jazz work would get paid a lot more<br/>assuming much of the payment involves the aspect of the music being performed<br/>many times to audiences (IE also the way cover bands make money).</p><p>   My take so far is that, in general, live music has its success determined<br/>much by to how many people it is played and how wealthy/involved the audience<br/>is.

I&apos;m sure I&apos;m one of very few musicians on this group who is at all affiliated with what has come to be referred to as &quot;indie&quot; culture, but let me tell you that within &quot;indie&quot; culture some of the most influential bands and musicians have produced their music using low-to-no-budget equipment.  Daniel Johnston, for instance has garnered a humongous cult-following (to the point that a very professional and acclaimed documentary has been filmed about him) recording direct to hand-held cassette recorder or boom-box, just himself and a cheap guitar or chord-organ.  The band Guided By Voices records all their albums to tape 4-track...and that&apos;s cassette 4-track, not reel-to-reel.  The band The Shins, who have had music featured in a variety of major motion-picture soundtracks and even received a bit of commercial radio play, recorded their acclaimed debut album using a single SM-57 and Cool Edit Pro.  There is an entire avant-garde hip-hop movement based around the Anticon label, with artists like Themselves and Why? that have cheap lo-fi sounds as an integral part of their overall aesthetic.  There is also a huge subculture around 8-bit game music, especially .nsf compositions for Nintendo Entertainment System sound emulators--music based on two square waves, a triangle wave, a noise generator, and a rudimentary single-sample player (or something like that).  That music is about as lo-fi as it gets, and a lot of it is AMAZING.  What indie acts like these have proven is that there is no relationship between budget/fidelity and audience appeal (or aesthetic merit).  In other words, it is definitively NOT what you use, and perhaps not even HOW you use it, but rather WHY you use it and WHAT you are trying to do with it.</p><p>What I am getting at with all this ranting is that the reason most microtonal music sounds weak or unprofessional is because there is a mismatch between the chosen musical idioms of the composers and the means and media available to realize the music.  It&apos;s better advice to tell someone: &quot;recognize your limitations and learn to turn them to your advantage&quot; than it is to say &quot;get better equipment/spend more money on your setup&quot;.</p><p>&gt; though (something I agree with)...would it be fair to<br/>&gt; say that people would qualify professional music (at least for classical and<br/>&gt; electric):<br/>&gt;   A) It&apos;s in key and with perfect instrument timing<br/>&gt;   B) The instruments and mixing sound like they came out of a professional<br/>&gt; studio with a &quot;larger than life&quot; sound<br/>&gt;   C) The overall feel is very confident, almost as if &quot;the musician could play<br/>&gt; it in his/her sleep&quot;</p><p>I disagree that any of these are universal criteria, and have musical examples to illustrate why:</p><p>A.  Key and timing are irrelevant to many styles of electronic music--especially dub and dubstep (which are currently enjoying quite a bit of popularity).  In these styles, rhythms are *supposed to be* wobbly and off-kilter, and harmonic elements are seldom very tuneful or tonal.  To say nothing of noise music or ambient music, or...JAZZ.</p><p>B. &quot;Larger than life&quot; sounds are quite a detriment to most bands considered &quot;indie&quot;.  The band Modest Mouse, for instance, really went down-hill when they got major-label funding, and it is almost universally-agreed among their fans that their best work is their cheaply-produced early stuff.  Same can be said of folk music--the more &quot;larger than life&quot; folk sounds, the more it betrays its own idiom.  Not to mention that a lot of singers are done little favor by detailed high-fidelity recordings.  People like Neil Young and Bob Dylan would sound abysmal if produced in a manner similar to, I dunno, Alicia Keys.</p><p>C. Confidence comes from exhaustive rehearsing, and often the eradication of spontaneity. There are too many musical styles to name wherein the most acclaimed performances are those where it sounds like the musician (or musicians) are at the absolute threshold of their ability, barely hanging on...or following their &quot;soul&quot; on some spontaneous whim and maybe screwing up a bit but letting their passion show through more clearly than if they nailed every note perfectly.</p><p>Really, Michael, it seems that both you and Marcel have a very myopic conception of what can pass for professional (and even commercial) music.  Judging by his response to me, I&apos;d want to include Ozan as well, but I constantly see him praising music that either you or Marcel would categorize as &quot;poorly executed&quot; and/or &quot;unsellable&quot;...so I think he really has nothing against low-production-quality music.  He just likes contradicting me for the sake of it.</p><p>But to get back to a point relevant to this list: as Makers of Microtonal Music, we would all do the best &quot;service&quot; to the cause of microtonality NOT by writing pandering music for the masses with the slickest software tricks and the highest budget we can muster, but by writing HONEST music full of the same mad passion that drove each of us to abandon the comforting womb of common-practice equal temperament.  Music which does not try to create an illusion of being more than it (usually) is: the labor of a lone person at a computer, perhaps with a mic or two and a couple of cheap physical instruments.  Those of us with the means to access better equipment or orchestral ensembles or what-have-you should, of course, make use of those resources--but those of us who can&apos;t should forgo the envy and the self-delusion and find a way to make the best of what we&apos;ve got.  Demonstrating our passion and our freedom will surely earn our &quot;movement&quot; more followers than would the crafting of some slick pop music.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24010 href="#24010">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2010 8:58:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;The band The Shins, who have had music featured in a variety of major<br/>&gt;motion-picture soundtracks and even received a bit of commercial radio play,<br/>&gt;recorded their acclaimed debut album using a single SM-57 and Cool Edit Pro.&quot;<br/>   I admit, I have heard of them (The Shins), though not Daniel Johnston.  Also,<br/>admittedly,  I know Fat Boy Slim made a point of using samples from unpopular<br/>records to make popular songs...although he did, to an extent, add hi-fi<br/>elements to those lo-fi recordings and mixed them in a way that boosted loudness<br/>to professional quality levels.<br/>   I looked up Daniel Johnston...and it seems his career was token punk<br/>rock-indie style.  It&apos;s believable because, in punk and some Indie rock, low<br/>quality recordings are acceptable.

In fact, the first music format I composed in was .mod, limited<br/>to 4 channels! :-D  Then again, it&apos;s not exactly &quot;gold&quot; level either...it&apos;s<br/>about as &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;normally accepted&quot; as playing Dungeons and Dragons as a<br/>high schooler.</p><p>&gt;&quot;A. Key and timing are irrelevant to many styles of electronic music--especially<br/>&gt;dub and dubstep (which are currently enjoying quite a bit of popularity).&quot;<br/>   Dub may be &quot;off beat&quot; in a mechanical sense, but I&apos;d re-interpret it as being<br/>&quot;on-beat with swing/quantization&quot; in the same way much trance and breakbeat (not<br/>to mention big-beat!) music is.  It all goes back to C) the overall feel<br/>(including the rhythm) sounds very confident.</p><p>&gt;&quot;B. &quot;Larger than life&quot; sounds are quite a detriment to most bands considered<br/>&gt;&quot;indie&quot;.

Confidence comes from exhaustive rehearsing, and often the eradication of<br/>&gt;spontaneity. &quot;</p><p>   Again what to say...I love listening to music where I feel the musician is<br/>&quot;riding the edge&quot;..but most of what I see making commercial success sounds, yes,<br/>exhaustively rehearsed and, sadly, that seems to be what most people want to<br/>hear.

I limit myself to what I actually see going gold or better in record<br/>sales.  Much as I (like you and several others) wish it were broadened to<br/>include more...I&apos;m simply defining it by what I see most people reacting to.<br/>And, minus perhaps Punk and Folk (neither of which have that substantial an<br/>audience)...people seem to have little tolerance for &apos;non-sparkling&apos; production<br/>quality and/or music that doesn&apos;t sound effortlessly played/confident.</p><p>--------------back to microtonal music.............--------------</p><p>&gt;&quot;we would all do the best &quot;service&quot; to the cause of microtonality NOT by writing<br/>&gt;pandering music for the masses with the slickest software tricks and the highest<br/>&gt;budget we can muster, but by writing HONEST music&quot;</p><p>  Yes and no. :-D  Yes, we&apos;d do the best to stay with our roots ultimately but<br/>(also yes) I believe it&apos;s rather egocentric not to try (well at least a few of<br/>us) to let the rest of the world know we can play their game (commercial music)<br/>well also and we aren&apos;t using microtonal music as a crutch IE &quot;because it&apos;s all<br/>we can do well&quot;.   Again, I think we need at least a few good men to make a few<br/>good &quot;pro&quot; songs and then say &quot;btw, glad you like this, but my real passion is<br/>microtonality&quot;...and hope they follow.</p><p>  Again, I&apos;d give Neil Haverstick as an example...no he&apos;s not &quot;gold&quot; (yet?!)<br/>but, yes, he&apos;s a prominent live guitarist in Denver&apos;s music scene, yes he has a<br/>cult following in the blues and jazz scenes, yes he&apos;s been in Guitar World.<br/>And, again, listening to my music and bunch of the musicians on this list wasn&apos;t<br/>enough to &quot;convert&quot; my jazz guitarist brother...but after hearing Neil he&apos;s been<br/>looking into getting a fretless guitar. :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;Those of us with the means to access better equipment or orchestral ensembles<br/>&gt;or what-have-you should, of course, make use of those resources--but those of us<br/>&gt;who can&apos;t should forgo the envy and the self-delusion and find a way to make the<br/>&gt;best of what we&apos;ve got.&quot;<br/>  Agreed!  Hence in my Untwelve entry, I put in the bio section a snippet saying<br/>the equivalent of &quot;I this is good enough...that someone with better<br/>compositional skill and equipment picks this up and sees potential to make<br/>something much better that brings microtonal music in a stronger light to the<br/>rest of the world.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Demonstrating our passion and our freedom will surely earn our &quot;movement&quot; more<br/>&gt;followers than would the crafting of some slick pop music.&quot;</p><p>I guess that&apos;s where I disagree.
