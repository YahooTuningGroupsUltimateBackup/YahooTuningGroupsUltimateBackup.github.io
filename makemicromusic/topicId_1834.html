Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 10:15:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>What you need to learn depends on your goals.</p><p>I saw Jon&apos;s reply, which I feel is a good one. It&apos;s<br/>hard to advise without knowing more about your<br/>experience, your goals and what tools you may already<br/>have.</p><p>By &apos;be a microtonalist&apos; I assume a broad interpretation<br/>-- that you have become aware that the tuning system of<br/>12 equally divided tones per octave which is promoted<br/>and held up as a lofty perfect and final accomplishment<br/>of musical arts, is not the only tuning in the world in<br/>which music can be written. Thus you are open to the<br/>possibility of creating musical art in new and<br/>different worlds of intonation.</p><p>Am I right to suppose you have the Logic sequencer?<br/>And then, can I assume your interest is in electronic<br/>instruments and not acoustic?</p><p>If so, here&apos;s a starting point:</p><p>Do you have an instrument which can be retuned? Some of<br/>the older Yamaha ones have good features and can be<br/>gotten for very little money off ebay. Also, some<br/>soundcards, like many of those from turtle beach, can<br/>be retuned. And GM synths can often be retuned using<br/>software like FTS (assuming you are on the PC) which<br/>generates pitch bends; instruments with tuning tables<br/>can be retuned on the PC with programs like Scala, or<br/>on the Mac with JICalc or LMSO.</p><p>I might note that wavetable synths will generall<br/>produce sounds with a perfectly harmonic overtone<br/>series. It is good to have an instrument like an FM<br/>synthesizer which can produce sounds with inharmonic<br/>overtone series as well. You may find that different<br/>scales sound better to you with one type of instrument<br/>timbre rather than another.</p><p>OK - so lets say you now have a sequencer and at least<br/>one instrument (I myself am only using one instrument<br/>now - a Yamaha SY77, even though I have several<br/>instruments.) and a means of retuning it. And since you<br/>have a sequencer and an instrument, I can assume that<br/>you have some experience writing music.</p><p>Some people might advise you at this point to start<br/>studying about lattices or matrices of ratios and means<br/>of creating various forms of triads and which chord<br/>progressions are allowed and how to modulate from one<br/>scale mode to another.</p><p>That might work for you. Perhaps after years of study,<br/>you will have some results.</p><p>I advise differently.</p><p>Partly because that&apos;s not how I do it and partly<br/>because I have noticed that many (but not all) of the<br/>persons recommending that approach have little music<br/>they have written or can point to which was created<br/>using this approach. Years into their study, they still<br/>debate this or that lattice endlessly and argue about<br/>which tuning system is best and can never seem to<br/>actally start writting music because year after year<br/>they are still in the mode of &apos;getting prepared&apos; to<br/>write music. This entire trap can be avoided by simply<br/>remembering to actually write music. Music is not<br/>theory. Music is not numbers. Music is not mathematical<br/>techniques. Music is an artform. It is fine to be a<br/>theorist and try to describe what has been done in the<br/>past, but that is nothing like actually creating<br/>original art.</p><p>So... if your goal is to write music - if by &apos;being a<br/>microtonalist&apos; you mean you want to write microtonal<br/>music, then I encourage you to do so.</p><p>I posit the obvious -- can you learn to play the piano<br/>by reading a book and talking to piano players?</p><p>Can you learn to expertly carve a sculpture by reading<br/>a book and talking to sculptors?</p><p>Can you learn to paint a beautiful landscape or<br/> portrait by reading a book and talking to painters?</p><p>Of course not -- all these things can ONLY be learned<br/>by experience. By trial and error. By getting your<br/>hands dirty. Not by only thinking about it. Not my<br/>drawing diagrams or performing computer simulations or<br/>analyses.</p><p>So -- try out various scales on your instrument - try<br/>mapping them to your white keys or black keys or all<br/>keys to see how they work. Try improvising. Try playing<br/>various chords at random and see how they lay on the<br/>keyboard. Learn how they sound. Work on writing a song<br/>in some new tuning system. Try different things out in<br/>your sequencer, looping, hearing for yourself how they<br/>sound. Don&apos;t let anyone tell you which chords sound<br/>good and which sound bad. Find out for yourself. You<br/>may find that any chord can sound good OR bad,<br/>depending on the context.</p><p>Don&apos;t limit yourself to a particular tuning clique<br/>either. Some groups only compose in 12tET, as we know.<br/>Others insist that Just Intonation (JI) is the one true<br/>path and these scales are especially loved by the brain<br/>and the ears. Is it so? I don&apos;t think so, but maybe<br/>it&apos;s true for you. Listen and find out for yourself.<br/>Try to write music in equal divisions of the octave, as<br/>many have. Daring? Bold? Fearless? Move on to nonoctave<br/>tunings -- 88 cET (cent equal temperament), discovered<br/>by Gary Morrison is a good starting point, as are Wendy<br/>Carlos&apos; Alpha and Beta nonoctave tunings. Try out<br/>nonjust nonequal scales, like scales derived from the<br/>spectra of instruments which you have sampled and<br/>examined using a FFT program.</p><p>In short, instead of a study of words, I recommend your<br/>study, your class, your laboratory be the world of<br/>music and sound, of listening, of experimenting and<br/>trying out things for yourself. Let your ears be your<br/>guide. Microtonality is too young and undeveloped a<br/>field to have a theory yet anyway. Its like the wild<br/>west where you have the freedom to make your own rules<br/>and experience your own truths, freed from the<br/>domination of others.</p><p>You may even start to find out that the &apos;common sense&apos;<br/>ideas and &apos;universal truths&apos; you learned in music<br/>theory/common practice harmony class are merely<br/>descriptive of expression of one small style of music<br/>and that real musical art is not constrained at all by<br/>such limiting theories. If you do realize this, don&apos;t<br/>feel angry at your music teachers, but thrilled to have<br/>transcended the deafness of the earwashed masses.</p><p>Good luck; we all look forward to hearing some of your<br/>creations -- MMM is a good group to bounce music off<br/>other people who are also actively writing music.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1838 href="#1838">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 2:41:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;X.

As far as I can tell, the only<br/>reason you started mapping common-tone progressions on the lattice is<br/>because you liked Graham Breed&apos;s progression which was devised in<br/>this way. As you may recall, I recommended that you try progressions<br/>featuring _contrary motion_ (easily visible on the keyboard, not on<br/>the lattice), rather than always keeping common tones . . .</p><p>Personally, I like a combined ear/instrument approach to composing --<br/>I do use a little &quot;precompositional&quot; reasoning to decide on ways of<br/>exploiting the characteristic dissonances of a tuning to engender a<br/>sense of tonality, for example -- but then the music must &quot;flow&quot; off<br/>my fingers in something like real time for it to end up sounding<br/>musical to me. Others may be better at composing &quot;schematically&quot;, but<br/>after college courses in which I spent entire vacations _after_ the<br/>course was officially over completing rigorous Bach-style and Mozart-<br/>style compositions, which got good grades but didn&apos;t really &quot;flow&quot;, I<br/>decided that (for the time being) composing _on paper_ was not for<br/>me . . .</p></div><h3><a id=1854 href="#1854">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 11:08:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_1834.html#1850">/makemicromusic/topicId_1834.html#1850</a></p><p>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ****This is really a valuable commentary by Jeff Scott.<br/>Actually,<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; my own composing in Blackjack I was devising various progressions<br/>&gt; &gt; using the lattices.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seemed to work, but I don&apos;t want my work to sound &quot;stilted&quot; so<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; am now using a *much* freer approach based exclusively on the<br/>ear...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a much better approach, as I&apos;ve always maintained -- with<br/>the<br/>&gt; caveats that (a) you have to get the scale in your brain before you<br/>&gt; can imagine music in the scale, and thus rely exclusively on the<br/>ear;<br/>&gt; and (b) if you actually rely also on the _keyboard_ rather than<br/>&gt; exclusively on the ear, and if you _want_ lots of consonances<br/>(which<br/>&gt; seemed to be your main concern when you asked the questions that<br/>led<br/>&gt; to the construction of the Blackjack scale), it&apos;s good to have an<br/>&gt; easy way to _find_ them -- putting Dave Keenan-style stickers on<br/>the<br/>&gt; keyboard is probably the best way.</p><p>****Hi Paul,</p><p>Actually I probably overstated my case here.
