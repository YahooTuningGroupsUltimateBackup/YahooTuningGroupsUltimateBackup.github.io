Although it says some of<br/>the objects are based on csound objects, so you could think of it as<br/>an application of those objects to the Max gui paradigm...</p><p>There is some interesting functionality in CPS that you can&apos;t get in<br/>Max or Pd, like easy output to c++ and java to include in standalone<br/>programs (!!!) and the ability to use it in shockwave (as a web<br/>browser plugin, for example).  You could do some awesome stuff with<br/>that.  There probably aren&apos;t nearly as many objects as there are for<br/>Max or Pd, but ti seems like they have a good user-friendly system to<br/>brew your own.</p><p>My advice would be, if you&apos;d like to use the extra functionality<br/>listed above, check it out; but if you just want the basics and are<br/>new to the music programming world, try Max/MSP or Pd because you&apos;ll<br/>have more community support.</p><p>Either way, you&apos;ll have a kickass system for making microtonal music ;-D</p></div>
