I happened to be in the Chicago area when a friend<br/>of mine heard a radio announcement about the Midwest Microfest&apos;s<br/>premiere concert and passed the word along to me.  Naturally, I was<br/>interested in attending, because I had been working with<br/>microtonality many years ago and wanted to see what was happening<br/>these days.</p><p>Wow, was I impressed!  The program was all in 19-tone equal<br/>temperament, with which I&apos;m very familiar.  Moreover, I was<br/>absolutely delighted that two of the featured composers were<br/>individuals whom I had met some 30 years ago.  Easley Blackwood and<br/>Joel Mandelbaum each gave a brief explanation prior to the<br/>performance of each of their pieces (Mandelbaum&apos;s suite for two<br/>pianos was performed live, and Blackwood&apos;s 19-tone etude was the<br/>original electronic recording).  Another electronically recorded<br/>highlight of the program was Aaron Johnson&apos;s &quot;Juggler&quot;, which<br/>accompanied a live juggler!</p><p>In all there were 5 different pianists (Jacob Barton, Christopher<br/>Bailey, Aaron Krister Johnson, Saori Chiba, and Paul Dykstra), who<br/>played (in pairs) two pianos tuned to subsets of 19-ET.  Quite an<br/>impressive undertaking, to say the least!  This was something that I<br/>could only dream about back in the seventies, when I was last active<br/>in microtonality.</p><p>But there was an even bigger surprise awaiting me after the concert.</p><p>Sorry, I have cut this short now.  Somebody else wants to use the<br/>computer.  More later.</p><p>George Secor<br/>Godfrey, Illinois</p></div><h3><a id=17974 href="#17974">ðŸ”—</a>methane_george &#x3C;methane_george@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2007 12:52:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, I&apos;m back.

As it turned out, I happened to sit down next to Aaron<br/>Hunt (a member of this group), who was engaged in a long<br/>conversation with the fellow just across the aisle, so it was only a<br/>couple minutes before the program started that Aaron and I<br/>introduced ourselves to one another.  I was quite surprised that he<br/>had heard of me, but we weren&apos;t able to discuss this any further<br/>till afterwards.

He must have<br/>thought I had a severe memory problem, because he started trying to<br/>remind me about some temperament that the two of us had allegedly<br/>worked on, and he even asked me for a photo ID (I showed him my<br/>driver&apos;s license).  When I got the same confused reaction from both<br/>Christopher Bailey and Jacob Barton, I began to suspect that someone<br/>is impersonating me on the Internet.</p><p>Once I found this group, I started looking at the recent messages,<br/>and sure enough!</p><p>Sorry, I have to get off again!</p><p>George Secor</p></div><h3><a id=17979 href="#17979">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2007 11:31:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George!</p><p>Great to see you found your way to the<br/>MMM list, and I hope we can get this<br/>sorted out concerning you and your<br/>doppelganger. It was a great pleasure<br/>to meet you at the concert (we have<br/>pictures to prove it, folks).</p><p>I have been meaning to post a mini-review<br/>of the midwest microfest concert, but have<br/>not taken the time. Thanks, George, for<br/>touching on some of the key points of<br/>interest. I was very glad to see some friends<br/>there I knew, and some I only knew of from<br/>these lists, but most of ther audience<br/>appeared to be there just to take in something<br/>new, which was nice to see. For me, the<br/>event was well worth the long drive<br/>northward to my former stomping grounds<br/>of Chicago.</p><p>I met Easley Blackwood as I walked in,<br/>(whom I had met previously at the AES<br/>conference in Chicago in 2002 or 2001,<br/>can&apos;t recall). Not surprisingly, he did not<br/>remember me. But anyone who has met<br/>Dr. Blackwood knows well the power of<br/>his intellect, and his ability to discuss<br/>his work with tuning has not diminished<br/>since I last had the opportunity to hear<br/>him speak.</p><p>I admit I had my doubts as I entered the<br/>rather dank yellow-walled track-lit<br/>basement room housing two uprights,<br/>one of which was being tuned at the<br/>last minute by AKJ. I had rather imagined<br/>two baby-grands sitting in the normal<br/>dual paino arrangement on a stage in<br/>a small music hall. But this vaguely<br/>discomfitting impression soon faded<br/>as the performance began and my<br/>attention was immediately drawn to<br/>the main thing - the music.</p><p>I think everyone here is probably in<br/>agreement that old music which was<br/>written in meantone should be played<br/>in meantone. There could be no<br/>greater support for this point of view<br/>than playing meantone music oneself,<br/>and the next best thing is hearing it<br/>blayed by someone else live. This<br/>is how the concert opened, with a<br/>performance of several &quot;Elizabethan works&quot;,<br/>all compositions in meantone (which<br/>one of the pianos could handle alone<br/>according to the dual piano 19-tuning<br/>scheme) played with exceptional<br/>authority by AKJ. An obvious<br/>connesiour of the style, his execution<br/>conveyed that wonderful sense of<br/>improvised composition so characteristic<br/>of the music of the period, with rubato<br/>and ornamentation handled in very<br/>good taste. Needless to say, with the<br/>tuning and the performance both being<br/>correct, that little room lit up with the<br/>brilliant singing tones of the old masters.</p><p>Well, I do apologise this is only a beginning<br/>of a review, but as work beckons, I will have<br/>to continue at a later date...</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>P.S. Thanks to Kraig Grady (who was<br/>_not_ in attendance) and my laser<br/>printer and binding machine, I am now<br/>also the proud owner of an autographed<br/>copy of Joel Mandelbaum&apos;s thesis.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;methane_george&quot; &lt;methane_george@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, I&apos;m back.
