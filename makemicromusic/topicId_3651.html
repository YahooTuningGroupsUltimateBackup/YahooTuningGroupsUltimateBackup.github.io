It lets you re-partition the hard disk in many cases without even re-booting - it<br/>&gt; usually works within Windows. You could just continue working and let it re-partition in the background as you do so though that<br/>&gt; would be risky in case another program caused a crash - so I prefer to leave it to do its thing and go away and come back when it is<br/>&gt; finished. Never had any problems with it. You can also cancel when it is in the middle of re-partitioning. Sometimes it needs a<br/>&gt; re-boot for some types of changes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do always back up just before re-partitioning though - because if you got a power cut in the middle of it you could end up with an<br/>&gt; unusable hard disk and need to re-format. Not sure if that would happen with Partition Magic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I used another program before then however, and it was awful, because it actually messed up the partition with my Windows OS on it,<br/>&gt; with no way to recover from it that I could find, so that I had to re-format it and re-install windows. So one surely has to take<br/>&gt; care with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
