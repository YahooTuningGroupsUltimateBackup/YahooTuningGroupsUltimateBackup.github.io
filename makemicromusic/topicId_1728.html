The most recent &quot;service<br/>&gt; pack&quot; for Infinity 2.0 is supposed to have full keyboard retuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow! You did that?! A man of action indeed! That is encouraging<br/>that<br/>&gt; they listened to you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Apparently you can give it a list of note numbers &amp; frequencies,<br/>I<br/>&gt; believe from a file. However, I have not tried this out.<br/>&gt;</p><p>*****Hi Jacky!</p><p>I didn&apos;t see this anywhere in the manual, or manuals... Hope you&apos;re<br/>right.</p><p>&gt; Great! This is just what we need. Wonder if it can do cents as well<br/>&gt; as frequencies. Either is ok, but I&apos;m admittedly a little cents-<br/>&gt; centric.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have Infinity 2.0 here, in a box, awaiting a new machine...<br/>(The package arrived here at a very inopportune time in my life, and<br/>I &gt; have never gotten around to installing it...)<br/>&gt;</p><p>****You&apos;re point about somehow getting these separate *patches* to<br/>work in a sequencer is, obviously, important.</p><p>Let me know if you have any success with _Infinity_ in this regard.<br/>So far, it&apos;s been a complete mystery to me, except for the fact that<br/>I&apos;ve been able to make some really nice voltage-controlled sounds<br/>that I could use for &quot;sound effects...&quot;  :)</p><p>JP</p></div>
