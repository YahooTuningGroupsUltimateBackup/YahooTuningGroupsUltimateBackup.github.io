I<br/>myself have done such things in the two recordings<br/>mentioned earlier, and in my &quot;Branchings for<br/>Computer-Controlled Synthesizer&quot;--my PhD<br/>dissertation-composition.</p><p>You are welcome to contact me at<br/>harold_fortuin@... if you&apos;d like to swap<br/>recordings of any of my music for your work, and I can<br/>extend this offer to other interested parties on this<br/>list whose music intrigues me. But I&apos;m most likely not<br/>to be ready to burn one-off CDs until mid-Nov.</p><p>Soundly yours,<br/>Harold Fortuin<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin">www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin</a></p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
