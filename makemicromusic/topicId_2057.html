Nice vocal tone you<br/>&gt; have there! Got anymore tunes where you vocalize?</p><p>Well, not a &quot;new&quot; sound, really (given that this was me<br/>singing over ten years ago) but its true that I havent<br/>been singing a lot lately. The amazing thing about voice<br/>is how easy it is to retune. No need for scala, tuning tables,<br/>MIDI pitch bend, or sys ex!</p><p>And yes, I&apos;ll put up a 19-tet folk-rock piece soon.<br/>I hope its OK to do a microtonal love song.</p><p>Bill</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
