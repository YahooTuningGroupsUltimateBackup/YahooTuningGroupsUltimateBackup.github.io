For the most part, it was rather a &quot;ho<br/>hum...&quot;</p><p>Of traditional orchestral instruments, which I would use with<br/>Sibelius, *few* actually came out as nicely as I get with a simple<br/>Soundblaster 128.  This isn&apos;t even the &quot;Soundblaster Live&quot; with all<br/>the &quot;sound fonts&quot; and so on.</p><p>Could somebody please explain a bit to me about that &quot;sound font&quot;<br/>business??  I&apos;d appreciate it.</p><p>Regardless, it really seems that the card does every *bit* as nicely<br/>as the Proteus for traditional orchestral sounds.  In fact, I would<br/>say it does quite a bit better for certain of them.</p><p>Not to mention that the &quot;generic&quot; Proteus 2000 (I know there are<br/>sound expansion modules, I guess they&apos;re cards that slide in?? Dunno)<br/>doesn&apos;t have *many* of the orchestral instruments.  There was no<br/>bassoon, for instance, and I didn&apos;t see a harp.  The acoustic guitar<br/>didn&apos;t really sound so great (soundcard was better)...</p><p>Trumpet was pretty thin, oboe was *very* thin.  Clarinet and piano<br/>were both quite nice... probably the best of the conventionals.</p><p>It didn&apos;t really seem to have *all that* much percussion built in,<br/>either but, again, I would suppose expansion cards would have more...</p><p>I didn&apos;t see a French Horn among the generics.  Trombone was pretty<br/>good.</p><p>On the overall, though, it seems my Soundblaster 128 soundcard does<br/>better...</p><p>Am I dreaming??</p><p>Certainly the sounds of the Proteus 2000 don&apos;t seem to be worth the<br/>$800 investment, when the Soundblaster sounds as good if not better...</p><p>Anybody else have similar experiences??</p><p>Although it beats the TX81Z&apos;s out in certain categories, I have to<br/>say that even the TXs have some *much* better sounds than the Proteus<br/>2000.  As we know, the bells, celeste and such like on the Z&apos;s are<br/>really quite fantastic with the FM operators.</p><p>I guess the Proteus 2000 really has a better primary *piano* sound<br/>than the Z&apos;s, but the Z has a nicer trumpet and *has* a bassoon (I<br/>guess nobody knows what a bassoon *is* anymore... nobody needs<br/>*that* ...)</p><p>And, the bottom line is, really with all *three* methods, the halfway<br/>decent soundcard, the Z&apos;s and the Proteus 2000, it all *still* sounds<br/>synthesized and the improvements are marginal.</p><p>Without a doubt, *many* of the sounds of the Proteus 2000 are<br/>inferior to the Soundblaster 128 *and* the TX81Z&apos;s...</p><p>I&apos;m not anxious to make this particular *investment* at the moment<br/>after *hearing* the Proteus.  (It&apos;s not surprising that they got<br/>their tuning implementation wrong, as well... the synth is very<br/>*middle road...*)</p><p>Comments from anybody who has any experience with any of this would<br/>be *greatly* appreciated!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=3590 href="#3590">ðŸ”—</a>Stan Hoffman &#x3C;stanhoffman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2002 1:02:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joe--</p><p>If it&apos;s orchestral sounds you want, you should check out the *Virtuoso*<br/>2000, which is completely devoted to classical orchestral sounds.....<br/>For sketching/proofreading I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s more than adequate (I&apos;m using a<br/>Roland JV1010 which, I believe, is less so, although it is better supported<br/>by Sibelius).

I rarely here this in MIDI<br/>compositions.  In fact, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve ever heard it.</p><p>As for using MIDI to &quot;test&quot; instrumental compositions, I always just use<br/>piano sounds. . . even if the piece is for string orchestra.  MIDI strings<br/>are usually so awful, that I&apos;d rather listen to a MIDI piano play a string<br/>orc piece than MIDI strings.  I certainly wouldn&apos;t feel like I&apos;m getting<br/>the &quot;basic idea&quot; of the sound of the piece from the latter.  In fact, I&apos;m<br/>probably getting more of a dangerous distortion than with piano. Ditto for<br/>winds.</p><p>Actually, that Roland XV-5080, I mentioned in my past post, has some quite<br/>nice orchestral instrument timbres (and some bummers as well . . ).  Well,<br/>at least, there were some that didn&apos;t make me wince in pain.</p></div><h3><a id=3598 href="#3598">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2002 7:51:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_3586.html#3597">/makemicromusic/topicId_3586.html#3597</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph, didn&apos;t you once say that you don&apos;t want to &quot;emulate&quot; real<br/>sounds<br/>&gt; (i.e. orc insts.) but to have sounds playing the music that don&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessarily make people think &quot;oh this is supposed to be a<br/>clarinet.&quot;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Christopher!</p><p>Yes, you are correct.
