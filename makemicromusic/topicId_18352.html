Getting the second translating is<br/>a much greater task than the former. But have seen these guitar<br/>exercises which i don&apos;t think are really pieces.</p><p>Through the years a few of Novaro&apos;s students students have contacted<br/>me. None of them seem to have any direct knowledge or contact with<br/>Novaro&apos;s music.<br/> Since Erv is a natural Spanish speaker and i am not, i forward the<br/>info and contacts to him.</p><p>I remember there being only one record of Carillo at the time (60&apos;s)<br/>and maybe that turned off.
