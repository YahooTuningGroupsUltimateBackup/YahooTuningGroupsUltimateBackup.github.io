Pauline Oliveros, accordian; Philip Gelb, shakuhachi; and<br/>Dana Reason,<br/>piano.<br/>-------------------</p><p>The Arts Center for the Capital Region<br/>265 River Street Troy<br/>12-05-02<br/>8pm doors at 7:30pm<br/>$5/3 students<br/>-------------------<br/><a href="http://www.ir-music.org">http://www.ir-music.org</a></p><p>The final Impulse/Response of part one of our 3rd season is<br/>indeed an<br/>exciting one!</p><p> From three corners of our grand US of A, come three of the most<br/>sensitive<br/>and unique voices in contemporary improvisation.  The Space<br/>Between has been<br/>mystifying audiences with their unique blend of sonic exploration<br/>for over 7<br/>years.</p><p>The Arts Center will be a wonderfully intimate space to listen to<br/>this<br/>delicate, organic ensemble...come in from the cold and warm up<br/>your ears!</p><p>Group Bio:<br/>THE SPACE BETWEEN</p><p>The Space Between trio was formed in the winter, 1996 when<br/>the Dana<br/>Reason/Philip Gelb duet invited Pauline Oliveros to join them for<br/>a concert<br/>in San Francisco. Utilizing a unique combination of Just<br/>intonation<br/>accordion with shakuhachi and piano immediately puts the trio<br/>in a special<br/>sonic space. The trio employs timbre and texture as their main<br/>structural<br/>units for composition and improvisation. As a result the<br/>discrepancy in<br/>tuning systems of the instruments becomes an advantage rather<br/>than a<br/>disadvantage. Since the three members live in different cities,<br/>performances<br/>have been sporadic; highlights include the Opus 415 festival in<br/>San<br/>Francisco, Spruce Street Forum in San Diego and a two night<br/>stint at the<br/>Center for New Music and Audio Technologies where they were<br/>joined by Barre<br/>Phillips on bass.</p><p>Individual Bios:</p><p>PAULINE OLIVEROS</p><p>Pauline Oliveros has become a senior figure in American<br/>avant-garde. In the<br/>&apos;50s she was part of a circle of iconoclastic composers, artists,<br/>poets and<br/>such gathered loosely around John Cage. Oliveros has been as<br/>interested in<br/>finding new sounds as in finding new uses for old ones -<br/>nowadays she most<br/>often plays accordion, an unexpected visitor perhaps to musical<br/>cutting<br/>edge, but one which she approaches in much the same way that<br/>a Zen musician<br/>might approach the Japanese shakuhachi. Pauline Oliveros&apos; life<br/>as a<br/>composer, performer and humanitarian is about opening her<br/>own and others&apos;<br/>sensibilities to the universe and facets of sounds. Since the<br/>1960&apos;s she has<br/>influenced American music profoundly through her work with<br/>improvisation,<br/>meditation, electronic music, myth and ritual. Pauline Oliveros is<br/>the<br/>founder of Deep Listening, which comes from her childhood<br/>fascination with<br/>sounds and from her works in concert music with composition,<br/>improvisation<br/>and electro-acoustics. Pauline Oliveros describes Deep<br/>Listening as a method<br/>to listen in every possible way to everything possible to hear no<br/>matter<br/>what you are doing. Such intense listening includes the sounds<br/>of daily<br/>life, of nature, of one&apos;s own thoughts as well as musical sounds.<br/>Deep<br/>Listening is my life practice,&quot; she explains, simply. John Cage:<br/>&quot;Through<br/>Pauline Oliveros and Deep Listening I finally know what harmony<br/>is... It&apos;s<br/>about the pleasure of making music.&quot;</p><p>DANA REASON</p><p>Canadian born pianist, composer and improvisor Dana Reason<br/>has performed at<br/>the California Institute for the Arts, Colorado University, Guelph<br/>Jazz<br/>Festival, Frau Musica (Nova) Cologne, San Francisco Jazz<br/>Festival, Beyond<br/>the Pink Festival, (LA), Knitting Factory (NYC), Music Gallery<br/>(Toronto),<br/>and Newfoundland Sound Symposium. Ms. Reason has been<br/>featured on National<br/>Public Radio, Radio Canada and has recorded for Music &amp; Arts,<br/>Red Toucan,<br/>Deep Listening, Sparkling Beatnik and Ryokan labels. This past<br/>fall<br/>Musicworks magazine published a feature article titled The<br/>Piano Artistry of<br/>Dana Reaons by Dan Given. Ms. Reason is Ph.D candidate and<br/>scholarship<br/>recipient at the University of California San Diego where she<br/>studies with<br/>George E. Lewis and Anthony Davis. Her dissertation research<br/>is titled<br/>Playing like a Girl: Women Improvisors in the Second Half of the<br/>Twentieth<br/>Century: A Cross-Cultural Investigation into Musical<br/>Performativity. Ms.<br/>Reason is a freelance writer for the Twentieth Century Music,<br/>The Improvisor<br/>and Musicworks.</p><p>PHILIP GELB</p><p>Philip Gelb was born in Brooklyn, NY April 12, 1965. He has<br/>been studying<br/>shakuhachi since 1988, and performing professionally since<br/>1995.</p><p>Gelb began studying shakuhachi while a senior in college at the<br/>University<br/>of Florida where he recieved a BA in anthropology. His first<br/>shakuhachi<br/>teacher was Dr. Dale Olsen bai-o who introduced him to Kinko<br/>Ryu shakuhachi<br/>playing. He has also studied Meian Ryu shakuhachi with Ronnie<br/>Nyogetsu<br/>Seldin and with Kurahashi Yoshio. His traditional shakuhachi<br/>studies have<br/>concentrated on honkyoku, the solo Buddhist repetoire. In<br/>addition he always<br/>had a very strong interest in new and experimental music and<br/>improvisation.</p><p>He attended graduate school at the Florida State University<br/>School of Music<br/>studying ethnomusicology. While at FSU, he founded and<br/>directed the New<br/>World Ensemble. As director of this ensemble he was<br/>responsible for holding<br/>several artists in residence, including George Lewis, Richard<br/>Teitelbaum,<br/>Wadada Leo Smith, Davey Williams, Derek Bailey, Ladonna<br/>Smith, Shaking Ray<br/>Levis and Lawrence &quot;Butch&quot; Morris. The Butch Morris residency<br/>culminated in<br/>a CD that was released on New World/Countercurrents as part<br/>of Butch&apos;s 10 CD<br/>box set. The group also collaborated with several other great<br/>musicians<br/>including Kazue Sawai, Jill Burton, Gustavo Matamoros, Scott<br/>Walton, David<br/>Durant and Dana Reason. The New World Ensemble continues<br/>today at the FSU<br/>School of Music even though it has been several years since any<br/>of its<br/>founding members were there.</p><p>In November, 1996, Philip Gelb received a grant to attend a<br/>Japanese<br/>American artists interchange at the Atlantic Center for the Arts to<br/>study<br/>with the brilliant composer, Yuji Takahashi. During this residency<br/>some very<br/>important professional and personal connections were made;<br/>particularly<br/>meeting dancer, Eri Majima who has become a regular<br/>collaborator in Japan<br/>and the US.</p><p>Since 1995, Gelb has been performing nationally and<br/>internationally as a<br/>soloist and in ensembles. Performance highlights include the<br/>World<br/>Shakuhachi Festival, Lincoln Center, Yerba Buena Center for the<br/>Arts (San<br/>Francisco), Mills College (Oakland), Knitting Factory (New York),<br/>Session<br/>House (Tokyo), Tiara Koto Concert Hall (Tokyo) Munster Neue<br/>Musik Festival<br/>(Germany), Earshot Jazz Festival (Seattle), Music Gallery<br/>(Toronto), Center<br/>For New Music and Audio Technologies (Berkeley), Gainesville<br/>Jazz Festival,<br/>Subtropics New Music Festival (Miami), University Of California<br/>SanDiego,<br/>Bard College, Stetson College, Rollins College, University of<br/>Vermont, and<br/>Earlham College and two appearances as guest soloist with the<br/>Seattle<br/>Creative Orchestra.</p><p>Gelb&apos;s current projects include The Space Between (a trio with<br/>accordionist<br/>Pauline Oliveros and pianist Dana Reason), duets with<br/>interactive<br/>electronics composer Chris Brown, a trio with violinist Carla<br/>Kihlstedt and<br/>cellist Hugh Livingston. Other musicians with whom he<br/>frequently<br/>collaborates are koto master Shoko Hikage, multi<br/>instrumentalist Joe McPhee,<br/>and synthesizer player Tim Perkis.</p><p>Philip Gelb&apos;s recordings are available on various labels: Deep<br/>Listening,<br/>Sparkling Beatnik, New World/CounterCurrents, Leo, Music482,<br/>Ryokan, Abray,<br/>Twisted Village, Limited Sedition, and Cultural Labyrinth.</p><p>Gelb currently lives and teaches in the San Francisco Bay area.<br/>Apart from<br/>music, his interests include vegetarian cooking, organic<br/>gardening, and<br/>film.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Scott Smallwood - iEAR Studios Technical Director<br/>Clinical Assistant Professor of Computer Music<br/>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
