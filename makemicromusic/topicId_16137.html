If you&apos;ve got synthesizers<br/>and samplers going full tilt, this can warrant more &apos;verb.  If<br/>you&apos;re doing a harpsichord or piano solo, I find myself wanting<br/>a dryer sound -- even in terms of a real acoustic recording or<br/>high-tech convolution or 3-D modeled &apos;verb, but especially in<br/>terms of simplistic digital echo &apos;verb.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
