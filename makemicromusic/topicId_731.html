This is a meditation on the Love that has brought<br/>&gt; them together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This piece uses scale 7d from a set of Phi scales that I call the<br/>&gt; Lake of Golden Convergence. Named so because this structure reminds<br/>&gt; me of the reflection of a shore line on the surface of a lake. One<br/>&gt; image descending one ascending, and touching in the middle - it is<br/>&gt; symbolic of Golden Union in its myriad forms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Blessings to you my dear lovers, and best wishes! You are<br/>constantly<br/>&gt; in my thoughts and meditations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your Eternal Friend,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p><p>Jacky...</p><p>In several of your pieces, which I have been enjoying, I notice that<br/>there is a subtle interaction between the stereo channels of your<br/>work.</p><p>Is this some kind of &quot;flanging&quot; effect, or how do you do it??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
