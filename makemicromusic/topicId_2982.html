It was great sampler to learn on, but there are many frustrating aspects.. 12 note retuning, limited external midi control of parameters (only 1 external CC that controls only 1 of a few selected parameters), 20 bit A/D/A, filters are ok at best, limited to 256 megs RAM (can play from disk, but this is a limiting factor; SIMMS are expensive unless you know anyone who has 64meg ones laying around.)</p><p>Assuming you already have a PC I would highly recommend spending ~$1000 on the following upgrades (motherboard, CPU, RAM, Kontakt, &amp; audio device):</p><p>Asus A7V333 Via KT333 $112 <a href="http://www.qbitpc.com/">http://www.qbitpc.com/</a><br/>Athlon XP 2100+ $211  <a href="http://www.sonicparts.com/">http://www.sonicparts.com/</a><br/>PC2700 DDR RAM 512 megs $114 <a href="http://www.pcsupplysource.com/">http://www.pcsupplysource.com/</a><br/>$339 on NI Kontakt...  <a href="http://www.audiomidi.com">www.audiomidi.com</a> or numerous online stores.</p><p>All of the above for:<br/>~$776</p><p>For those running PCs<br/>~$437 is not &quot;that bad&quot; of an upgrade to the latest considering that your current MB/CPU/RAM could be sold for $100 to $150 depending on what it is..

The X has better tuning accuracy that<br/>the ASR 10 [0.37 cents compared to 1.56 cents] but it does not<br/>have a keyboard attached to it. It does have some bashable<br/>percussion pads on it . Only 13 of them though.</p><p>IMO the best option is to get some sort of softsampler like<br/>reaktor or some such and then use the hardware sampler to<br/>play all these sounds from. No softare sampler will give you the<br/>polyphony of a hardware sampler and no hardware sampler will<br/>give you as much sound design flexibility as a software sampler.</p><p>You need both!</p><p>Justin</p></div><h3>Jonathan Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 8:33:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike, Mike Mike - what would I/we do without you?</p><p>&gt;Well... since the Akai is basically a dedicated rack mount computer; you<br/>&gt;might as well get a rack mount case for a PC and call it a day... just as<br/>&gt;portable! ;)  You can always upgrade your PC, but you are out of luck with<br/>&gt;the S5000 and it is aging quickly.</p><p>OK, here goes. Yep, I figure the S5000 was either out or on it&apos;s way out, looking at online retailers for info/prices and they didn&apos;t have it. And it isn&apos;t that much fun investing in something that is neither &quot;right now&quot; or vintage technology.</p><p>But - sure, I&apos;m going to use this &apos;at home&apos;, but one of my primary reasons for the sampler is as follows: I play live, orchestral music. I&apos;m the head percussionist, and frequently there is need for the sound of instruments that we just don&apos;t have. The most recent one was the ambiguously described &quot;low bells&quot; in Mahler&apos;s Sixth Symphony. Yes, with a combination of about 3 hardware boxes and my sound system I put together a credible simulation of very low church bells, but sometimes there just isn&apos;t a substitute for the real timbre of something, even if you end up transporting the pitch up or down. I know, because I&apos;ve rented/borrowed equipment and done some sound design.</p><p>Not to mention sounds that can&apos;t be described but you know can be put together with samples or samples and synthesis together. And very occasionally, like for the Opera company, I contract to do a sound or sound design that one of their people will perform: I program, set up the gear, and they have to play it.</p><p>Do I have faith these days in hardware boxes? Yes.</p><p>Do I have faith these days in operating systems and software design. Not when it has to work every time, all the time!</p><p>You get my dilemma.</p><p>If you have any thoughts on the stability (hey, I&apos;m sure running these software samplers could be done with my P4 laptop running W2000 Pro, but...</p><p>But - and that&apos;s a humongous but - I value the thoughts about software solutions and won&apos;t go forward without thinking some more about it.</p><p>&gt;12 note retuning</p><p>Never mind... !!!</p><p>&gt;$339 on NI Kontakt...  <a href="http://www.audiomidi.com">www.audiomidi.com</a> or numerous online stores.</p><p>This is just starting to be discussed on the list, so I&apos;m definitely going to check it out.

My last &quot;top of the line system&quot; sported an Echo Gina card, but for whatever reason my latest computer (with an Asus MB and other stuff) keeps locking with a hardware conflict.
