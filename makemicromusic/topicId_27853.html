He converted it to 17edo.  Really nice job done.  He selected some nice wood for the fretboard that matched the guitar well and the new fretboard matches up with the existing neck really well.  I am quite happy with his work.  He periodically sent me emails informing of progress without me having to &quot;prod&quot; him.  If I get time, I may post some pictures somewhere, but since I live in the tornado torn area of north Alabama, and trying to get back to normal life here, it may be awhile before I get to it.</p><p>Now, I need to figure out what to do with 17edo!</p><p>Jay</p></div><h3><a id=27854 href="#27854">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2011 6:16:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Great you had an excellent experience with Ron -</p><p>When I deal with him he said he wasn&apos;t going to be doing any more<br/>conversions for other people - I&apos;m glad he changed his mind.<br/>The more places to get microtonal guitars the better.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, May 4, 2011 at 8:46 AM, &lt;jrinkel@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since Chris Vaisvil has recently mentioned the great job done on his<br/>&gt; guitar, I thought I&apos;d mention that I recently received my Seagull<br/>&gt; guitar back from Ron Sword.
