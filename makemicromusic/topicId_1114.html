Nicely shows off how good the diatonic<br/>&gt;scale&apos;s harmonies sound in 19-tET, as Woolhouse was trying to tell us<br/>&gt;back in 1835. I can imagine some prominent folk singer refretting a<br/>&gt;Martin to 19-tET and turning on the masses . . .</p><p>Thanks, Paul,</p><p>It is pretty diatonic, isnt it?</p><p>As you surmised, it is not a &quot;real&quot; guitar, though it was played on<br/>a guitar controller (one of the ztars by starr labs).<br/>Basically I played it twice through, and then edited out the mistakes<br/>(guitar controllers are somewhat unreliable at times, not to mention<br/>my technique). I also dubbed the &quot;bass melody&quot; in the middle separately.</p><p>The tone was a sampled guitar (actually 8 separate samples spread out<br/>across the fretboard), and looped. The sampler was an ASR-10, which has<br/>a nice &quot;mono-mode&quot; so that its easy to play it as if it were six<br/>mono-voiced synths, one for each string. I mapped the purely harmonic spectra<br/>to the (nearest) partials of 19-tet, but since 19-tet is so close to<br/>12-tet (and to JI) this didnt affect the sound of the individual<br/>samples much - the main difference was the slight &quot;phasing&quot; or &quot;chorusing&quot;<br/>effect you hear.</p><p>The glissandi were played by just sliding fingers between frets<br/>and having a very small portmento on the sound. All slides start<br/>at one 19-tet scale step and end at another (no bending strings).</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/23/2001 8:07:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi</p><p>I really liked it also.
