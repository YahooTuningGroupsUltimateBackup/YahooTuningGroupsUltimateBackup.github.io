The Squier is run through an Alesis mix into Sonar with Guitar Rig 4.</p><p>I took about 6 shots at the lead using Sonar&apos;s automatic multiple take function and then edited the takes to take what I wanted. The leads could be better - though this is the first time I tried something so microtonal in this idiom.</p></div>
