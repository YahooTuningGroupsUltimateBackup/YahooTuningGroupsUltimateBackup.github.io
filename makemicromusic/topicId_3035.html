We are, and will be for a long time, a small, small niche, and we have to think in those terms and work with those parameters to make music grow. If, and only if, we can develop a significant body of music that will move/convince enough people that it is worth investigating, only then will we start to see numbers large enough to sway markets and developments.</p><p>&gt;Not to get huffy here, but... I did so, and I continue to do so.</p><p>I&apos;ll second that. Rick has been a quiet background voice in these circles, but he has done yeomans work in getting a couple of generations of synths to bark out the microtones. Rick, your commitment is not in question in my eyes, that&apos;s for sure.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or learn C and get working on Timidity.</p><p>Oh balls. Musicians have the right to have instruments without learning to code! Sure, oboe players have to make reeds, but no other instrumental developments (correct me if I&apos;m wrong) would expect someone to actually learn how to build it before they could play it!</p><p>Graham, we need to keep our disciplines straight in this regard; the community is deeply enriched by those people who have both musical and software skills (you and Robert Walker spring to mind right away), but coding in C is not a burden I&apos;d put on any musician - they should be practicing, playing, or composing.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3042 href="#3042">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

It is a very unique<br/>&gt; instrument and capable of amazing expressivity as well<br/>&gt; as of course just about perfect tuning accuracy. These<br/>&gt; types of things are pretty much hand built by extremely<br/>&gt; talented craftsmen and the prices they charge are just<br/>&gt; barely covering their own costs. If it was profitable<br/>&gt; to build experimental musical instruments with esoteric<br/>&gt; features (and yes - tuning support IS esoteric, get<br/>&gt; real!), Capybara, Starr Labs and Buchla &amp; Associates<br/>&gt; all would have gone public some time ago to<br/>&gt; well-recieved IPOs. But that ain&apos;t never gonna happen!<br/>&gt; Take Harvey Starr for example -- please do not compare<br/>&gt; him with Bill Gates! He is not becoming rich selling<br/>&gt; handmade musical instrument controllers of interest<br/>&gt; only to microtonalists. Anyway, what I am saying is<br/>&gt; that you might say these things are &apos;overpriced&apos; or<br/>&gt; &apos;not worth it&apos; and if that is really so, then we should<br/>&gt; go home now because microtonality is not worth it then.<br/>&gt; This stuff costs money and time to develop and not a<br/>&gt; single person I have mentioned is doing more than<br/>&gt; barely getting by and selling these things at near<br/>&gt; cost. Don&apos;t agree? Fine -- anyone who does not think so<br/>&gt; should immediately form their own company and build<br/>&gt; their own inexpensive knockoff of Kyma or Uath 72 or<br/>&gt; Lightning and undersell the competition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So Graham and Joe and everyone else who supports the<br/>&gt; development of new instruments and tools are microtonal<br/>&gt; heros -- they are supporting the development of these<br/>&gt; fine new experimental instruments and making sacrifices<br/>&gt; in their lives to do so. What great credibility they<br/>&gt; have. Kudos to all of you in this category!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And can it have escaped anyone&apos;s notice that the people<br/>&gt; who sacrifice to support this field are also the ones<br/>&gt; *invested* in it creatively as well? The people who pay<br/>&gt; for their tools are the ones who value them enough to<br/>&gt; use them to create actual music that we all can hear!<br/>&gt; There is a definite connection here. These Real<br/>&gt; Composers write real music and that&apos;s what this is all<br/>&gt; about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that doesn&apos;t change the fact that for some of us,<br/>&gt; we can not afford to spend $8000 on an instrument. Even<br/>&gt; if it *is* worth it, we just don&apos;t have that kind of<br/>&gt; cash available. We can save up for what we want, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; one option. Also there is an option here too -- many<br/>&gt; old instruments on the used market have fine microtonal<br/>&gt; capabilities. They take time and motivation to learn<br/>&gt; how to use them as musical instruments, just like a<br/>&gt; violin! Look at all that Jacky has accomplished with<br/>&gt; his aging archaic instruments! What an exapmle and<br/>&gt; leader he is of what can be accomplished through modest<br/>&gt; means! There is no substitute for talent -- great music<br/>&gt; can be written with sticks and spoons. Anyone who can<br/>&gt; afford to be paying for internet access and can afford<br/>&gt; a web capable computer can afford the few hundred<br/>&gt; dollars it takes at most to get a reasonable set up.<br/>&gt; And new tools can be gradually added as one becomes<br/>&gt; proficient with old ones as one masters his craft.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>***Thanks so much for your nice words, Jeff, and I agree<br/>wholeheartedly with everything you say here.  My guess, though, is<br/>that probably *lots* more people pay shareware fees than one might<br/>initially guess, especially if they have even a glimmer enough of<br/>computers and computing to appreciate the work and ability of the<br/>creators...  And, of course, it makes obvious economic sense that the<br/>most *specialized* instruments that only see limited sales would have<br/>to have a steep price tag.</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3><a id=3087 href="#3087">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2002 9:56:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; We have a wishlist.<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.microtonalsynthesis.com/architectures.html">http://www.microtonalsynthesis.com/architectures.html</a>&gt;</p><p>On the wishlist... There are probably different things that should be said<br/>about software versus hardware synths, and the types of interfaces<br/>appropriate to each. There are different methods of tuning -- for hardware<br/>you have the &quot;spew-tuning-at-hardware&quot; interface and the front-panel<br/>interface. For software models, you have files.</p><p>I think also &quot;the bare minimum&quot; could say something about Scala &amp; software<br/>synthesizers, which is a different situation from hardware synthesizers.<br/>Take a look at VAZ. It has only a file load capability with no other<br/>interface. It has 1 cent resolution. It can use outputs of Scala to define<br/>tuning files. So it doesn&apos;t need any other editing interface.</p><p>Regarding this point:</p><p>&gt; tables can be selected using short SysEx messages or the MIDI<br/>&gt; Tuning Standard</p><p>Why not add &quot;or a simple text format&quot;? Scala has plenty of outputs that<br/>would be useful.</p><p>For software synthesizers, I don&apos;t see SysEx or the Midi Tuning Dump as<br/>being any kind of ultimate interface. Those are fine for spewing across<br/>lines to hardware devices... Straight-forward text files would be a much<br/>better interface for software synths -- the files could be edited by hand<br/>if necessary, and/or could be easily generated by home-brew software.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=3091 href="#3091">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2002 11:19:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh look, a straight piece of wood<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do think Cubasis works with VST/VSTi.</p><p>Not only straight, but quite long.</p></div><h3><a id=3093 href="#3093">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2002 12:55:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Oh look, a straight piece of wood<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do think Cubasis works with VST/VSTi.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;  Not only straight, but quite long.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I might suggest the VX3Z200EXL Pro Quantum Granuglanular Vaporization<br/>&gt; Nanomangrove VSTi 4 Plugin, from Hyperneurotechnoquarkologies Inc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has really neat vloorch, and makes a great snardcluk too.
