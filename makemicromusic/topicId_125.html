One thing that<br/>strikes me is that most of this music sounds not xenharmonic, but<br/>rather like finely-inflected 12-tET or diatonicism. For example, the<br/>scale steps in the scale above are (in cents)</p><p>        86.58<br/>       91.139<br/>       96.204<br/>       101.87<br/>       108.24<br/>       115.46<br/>       116.49<br/>       108.24<br/>       101.87<br/>       96.204<br/>       91.139<br/>        86.58</p><p>So in essence you have, in this instance, a 12-tET circle which is<br/>stretched on one side and compressed on the other side. Very organic,<br/>for the types of melodies you&apos;re playing. My question is, have you<br/>created any music using scales or intervallic structures which are<br/>incompatible with 12-tET or diatonic thinking? If so, can we hear it?</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 9:10:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I enjoyed listening to this piece, as I did to the music on<br/>&gt; _Galunlati_ (sp?) and on the Tuning Punks site.

Think of this as pro-active encouragement.<br/>In a reply, Mary suggested spending a little energy to a<br/>home/computer studio environment. Dan Stearns was in a similar<br/>situation, so I took a look at what I could find, not for cheap, but<br/>for _free_. In approximately a 1 meg zip file, I can send you both a<br/>simple to use PC recording program that will work with pretty much<br/>any sound card with a line in, and a public domain mp3 encoder. Both<br/>have instructions from me on how to set it up, and all you need is to<br/>run a line in to your sound card from a source (cassette, DAT,<br/>MiniDisc [CD could be taken right off the CD drive]) and you can get<br/>the file on the hard disk, do any editing you want, encode to mp3 and<br/>upload it.</p><p>It is both Easy and Free. How often does one come across this in life?</p><p>There you have it. Barring the bottle-neck, which should be easy to<br/>fix, you are good to go.
