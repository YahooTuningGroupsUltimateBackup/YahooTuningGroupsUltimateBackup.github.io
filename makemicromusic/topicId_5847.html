Composition is such a personal statement;<br/>who can really tell you what you want to say?  As for &apos;how to<br/>say it&apos;, there really isn&apos;t any precise terminology for<br/>describing musical structure.  You can say limited stuff like<br/>&apos;the transition into the bridge is too abrupt&apos;, but that&apos;s<br/>about the extent of it.  What makes a piece of music great is,<br/>despite the mathematical machinations of mice and men, a great<br/>mystery.  It&apos;s also personal and subjective.
