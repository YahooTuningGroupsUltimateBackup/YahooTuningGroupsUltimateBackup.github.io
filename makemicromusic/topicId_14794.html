I had prepared an eight-channel version especially for this venue, since the emphasis was on multi-channel electroacoustic music.  I&apos;m happy to say that the piece was well received, and it sounded great on their excellent sound system (expect for a low-frequency artifact that I was unable to hear on my home system -- but that was my fault, not theirs).</p><p>Of the many pieces played over the course of three days and five concerts, it was the only one that employed just intonation, and (as far as I know) the only one written using Csound and blue.</p><p>Thanks to Kevin Austin at Concordia for being a great host and encouraging me to prepare and submit the piece.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>[1] <a href="http://mysterybear.net/article/21/timewave-canon">http://mysterybear.net/article/21/timewave-canon</a></p></div><h3>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2006 5:02:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Congrats on that . . .my 19-tet/JI piece Sand (<a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sand.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sand.html</a>) was played on that festival last year,  and sounded awesome on that system.
