But<br/>&gt; I read the collection of his writings &apos;Style and Idea&apos; and I feel<br/>drained<br/>&gt; and exhausted. Yet coming back from a concert of Shoenberg, I am on<br/>fire and<br/>&gt; excited and ready to groove!<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Jeff,</p><p>We can refer to Monz, our Schoenberg &quot;expert&quot; on this, but my<br/>impression is that *many* of the books Schoenberg wrote, and it<br/>particularly seems that way with _Harmonielehre_ were really written<br/>for classes that were the way he made $.</p><p>Most of _Harmonielehre_ seems like he really didn&apos;t want to be<br/>writing it at all, but had to come up with things for his classes.<br/>My impression is that he would rather be composing, so the books,<br/>while interesting, could be taken in that light...</p><p>J.
