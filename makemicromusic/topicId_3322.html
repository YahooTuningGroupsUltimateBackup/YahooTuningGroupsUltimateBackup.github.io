If not, I&apos;ll<br/>refresh. Angelina is a soft synth VST plugin or standalone, which (quoting<br/>the blurb) &quot;uses formant synthesis to generate rich, breathy pads sound&quot;.</p><p>Angelina is distributed as shareware at a mere $40, and is currently in<br/>Beta. See the page here:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://bigtick.pastnotecut.org/index.php">http://bigtick.pastnotecut.org/index.php</a></p><p>and click on Angelina in the left column.</p><p>Here is a bit of news for the practicing microtonalists... I&apos;ve been in<br/>contact with &quot;Big Tick&quot; the author of Angelina and Rainbow soft synths.<br/>Big Tick is currently adding microtonal support to Angelina, using the<br/>same file format as the VAZ line (i.e., the &quot;.tun&quot; file). Yesterday<br/>afternoon I received a pre-alpha copy of Angelina with preliminary<br/>microtonal support. I was able to load &quot;.tun&quot; files that I have used with<br/>VAZ and produce a bit of doodling improvisation with Angelina, which I<br/>uploaded as an example:</p><p><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/Angelina-15-Tone-Test.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/Angelina-15-Tone-Test.mp3</a></p><p>(It&apos;s just goofing around, so don&apos;t expect music; but it illustrates<br/>Angelina with microtonal support.)</p><p>Rumor has it that micrtonal support might eventually make it into Rainbow<br/>as well... Hmmm! Well, I&apos;ve already signed up to support the effort!</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
