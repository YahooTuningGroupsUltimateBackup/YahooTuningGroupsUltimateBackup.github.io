Or would you reduce to another interval?</p><p>Anyway, it would take a lot of web space to do all those.<br/>However you can easily make them yourself - why not give it a go?</p><p>Easiest if you have Cortona installed, or another VRML client that can play waveform audio<br/>or midi clips.</p><p>Install Virtual Flower from <a href="http://virtualflower.co.uk">http://virtualflower.co.uk</a>, go to Output | Musical Geometry,<br/>choose the Hexany from the drop list of templates. Select .wav as the type<br/>of clip to make.</p><p>Start up FTS, use File | New and then select the voice you want to play<br/>it on from the Voice menu.</p><p>In Virtual Flower, click the button to make the clips and the model.<br/>Then a message will pop up in FTS asking if you want to record all<br/>the clips - say yes, and then wait while it plays all the notes and<br/>records them.</p><p>Now in Virtual Flower again, click the button to show the model, and<br/>there it is, the 1 3 5 7 hexany.</p><p>It&apos;s explained also in the help for Virtual Flower but that&apos;s it<br/>basically.</p><p>To make any of the other models, just change the list of factors first,<br/>then click the button to make the model and the clips as before.</p><p>So once one has done it the first time, it&apos;s then just two clicks<br/>for each model + wait for FTS to make<br/>all the clips + change the name of the save folder for<br/>each one.</p><p>It&apos;s faster to do them in Midi instead of waveform audio,<br/>and if you have an old version of Cortona<br/>or have Cosmo player you can do it that way too, but you can&apos;t make<br/>these models in midi in the latest version of Cortona because of a<br/>newly introduced bug in it (which they know about and I hope they<br/>fix it soon).</p><p>If you want to make the java applets, that&apos;s all explained in<br/>Virtual Flower | Help | Applets and also<br/> Virtual Flower | Help | Other Options | Musical Geometry<br/>- you need to save the clips in the Java type Sun Au format<br/>and so also need to install SOX for FTS to use to do that as<br/>explained in FTS | Help | FAQ | How do I convert audio formats....</p><p>Anyway once that is set up it is just the same as before,<br/>a couple of clicks of the button plus you also need to start<br/>up the Blaxxun wizard to convert your hexany into a<br/>format suitable for the java applet, but that is also<br/>very easy and straightforward to use.</p><p>I could put them all up easily if I could do them in Midi<br/>but unfortunately at the moment Cortona won&apos;t show them in midi<br/>correctly with the current version 4.0, so they have to be put up<br/>as audio clips, which takes a fair amount of space for each<br/>model, so one can only put up so many of them.</p><p>However, if you or anyone esle is particularly interested<br/>in some of the models, you could easily make them<br/>and them up yourself somewhere. The more the merrier :-).<br/>I&apos;ll be delighted to help if anything else needs to be explained<br/>for anyone who wants to do that.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3920 href="#3920">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2002 6:06:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Thought I&apos;d explain why I posted the hexany here.</p><p>I know its not a composition in the conventional sense. However<br/>I think of these models as a kind of musical sculpture - without<br/>the time element of a musical piece - the time part comes in from<br/>the viewer interactively playing with the model by clicking on the<br/>notes, diads and triads.</p><p>The maths of it is suitable to discuss over in tuning, but I thought<br/>the musical / compositional kind of aspect of it is relevant here<br/>- and anyway its the main thing I&apos;m doing in the way of that type<br/>of thing right now at this minute - though I hope to do more of the<br/>conventional composing again soon.</p><p>Of course the hexany and CPS sets get used for<br/>composition in Kraig Grady&apos;s pieces for instance - his<br/>Farewell Ring for instance :-).</p><p>I&apos;ve tried writing for hexany a little bit. I think I&apos;ve<br/>posted some of the things I did (like the hexany variations<br/>and my hexany recorder trio).</p><p>However with this model, I&apos;m just exploring them as musical geometry.<br/>Don&apos;t know for sure if it is appropriate here, but<br/>that kind of just fun playing around with the shapes<br/>and clicking on the notes aspect of it I thought possibly<br/>might be more appropriate here than the main list...?</p><p>Maybe on the lines of calling it a kind of java microtonal<br/>instrument - cum - geometrical sculpture, or something.</p><p>Maybe one could design more elaborate sculptures from<br/>chords, not necessariy always following maximally symmetrical<br/>geometrical forms, but when you have two notes in common the chords<br/>do have to share a diad. One could use squares for tetrads, as one<br/>of the projections of a tetrahedron into 2D is a square.</p><p>I think one could use pentagons for pentads similarly<br/>- there, maybe each edge could play the triad of those<br/>two notes plus the opposite point, and each vertex could<br/>play the triad of that note and its two neighbours to<br/>either side, then the centre of the pentagon plays<br/>the complete pentad. I&apos;ve been puzzling over<br/>whether there is a natural way to map pentads<br/>to the faces of a dodecahedron so that they all<br/>fit together with each sharing an edge with each of<br/>it&apos;s neighbours, but that now is<br/>more of a topic for the main list certainly.</p><p>:-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3923 href="#3923">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2002 8:11:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; HI Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wondered a bit about the powers of 2 in your list - I reduce<br/>&gt; everything to the octave, so they will all end up as same effect<br/>&gt; as putting a 1 there.
