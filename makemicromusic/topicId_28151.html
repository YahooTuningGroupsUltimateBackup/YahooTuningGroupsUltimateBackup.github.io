It&apos;s a very short jazz-combo sort of<br/>piece, though that wasn&apos;t what I originally intended.

I<br/>like proper scales, so I had to wedge a lot of notes in to make it<br/>flesh out all the little intervals properly. The resulting scale is<br/>here:</p><p>! C:\Program Files (x86)\Scala22\mostly-elevens-scale.scl<br/>!<br/>Scale derived mostly from elevens.<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 33/32<br/> 12/11<br/> 25/22<br/> 33/28<br/> 11/9<br/> 14/11<br/> 4/3<br/> 7/5<br/> 16/11<br/> 3/2<br/> 11/7<br/> 18/11<br/> 56/33<br/> 16/9<br/> 11/6<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>It looked like I should temper 540/539 and 441/440; I seem to remember<br/>them being quite prevalent when I looked at different interval<br/>combinations, though I blush to say I don&apos;t remember which ones they<br/>equated. As such, I tempered to 58 EDO. Looking deeper and comparing<br/>intervals in Scala showed that 9801/9800, 3025/3024, 43923/43904,<br/>5632/5625, and 42592/42525 were likely candidates. Looking into it, I<br/>discovered that 72 EDO tempers 540/539, 441/440, and all but the last<br/>two commas, so that&apos;s what I tempered it to, and that&apos;s what&apos;s in the<br/>MP3. Here&apos;s the scale:</p><p>! C:\Program Files (x86)\Scala22\mostly-elevens-scale-tempered-to-72-EDO.scl<br/>!</p><p> 17<br/>!<br/> 50.00000<br/> 150.00000<br/> 216.66700<br/> 283.33300<br/> 350.00000<br/> 416.66700<br/> 500.00000<br/> 583.33300<br/> 650.00000<br/> 700.00000<br/> 783.33300<br/> 850.00000<br/> 916.66700<br/> 1000.00000<br/> 1050.00000<br/> 1116.66700<br/> 1200.00000</p><p>It&apos;s pretty accurate. The 25/22 is the worst, at only 4.6 cents flat,<br/>which is about the best possible distinction my ears can make on very<br/>close listening in ideal circumstances. Also, note that 72 EDO equates<br/>33/28 with 13/11, and makes (14/11)*(33/28) = (14/11)*(13/11) = 3/2.<br/>The scale is only proper now, not strictly proper, but that&apos;s okay<br/>with me.</p><p>Note that 144 EDO gives the same exact result. I&apos;d be interested in<br/>any other ideas on how it could have been tempered.</p><p>I was going to write something a little spooky or ambiguous, so I<br/>settled on a chord progression like this:</p><p>1. 1/1 root, neutral chord<br/>2. 12/11 root, septimal minor chord<br/>3. 11/6 root, septimal minor chord<br/>4. 4/3 root, neutral chord</p><p>I wrote a bass line and rendered it with a harsh, deep square wave --<br/>but try as I might, I couldn&apos;t hear it as spooky. In fact, it seemed<br/>pretty darned happy, like a walking bass line from a jazz combo. After<br/>spending a half-hour trying to fix it, I gave up, changed the<br/>instrument to acoustic bass, added the guitar chops, and started to<br/>write a saxophone melody.</p><p>I thought the melody should cover a lot of notes in the scale to<br/>really call out its flavor, so I walk up and down the scale for the<br/>refrain. It&apos;s lazy, though, so I made sure it felt a little sloppy.<br/>Then I got little sillier in the verse -- I&apos;m terrible at writing<br/>solos, so I kept it short. If I had a real microtonal sax player, I&apos;d<br/>prefer to extend the solo, and have more solos with other instruments,<br/>and all that good stuff. In a sense, what I have here is a proof of<br/>concept of the piece more than what I&apos;d like the piece to be.</p><p>I thought about cutting out some of the repetition. The bass line<br/>walks through a complete chorus, and then the chords go through a<br/>complete chorus, and then the sax kicks in. But I decided I really<br/>like getting the bass on its own AND the sound of the chords, so I<br/>left them. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>In the end, almost all of the notes get used at least a few times, and<br/>the piece pretty successfully sounds non-twelve.</p><p>I also thought that everyone except the sax players would have killed<br/>me if I wrote them something this boring. When I tried making the bass<br/>player play passing tones, though, it sounded pretty harsh, so I<br/>limited them to the verse. I attribute that to a lack of subtlety in<br/>my control of LilyPond / Timidity. Again, in the real world, I&apos;d hope<br/>for some improv there to make the tune better.</p><p>Speaking of LilyPond, I&apos;d love to have or find a &quot;strum&quot; function. I<br/>have to write fairly complex expressions to get the sound I have here.<br/>I started with a simple chord, but I didn&apos;t get the strum / chop sound<br/>I do here, and I really wanted that, so I had to write a bunch of<br/>stuff with ties and... well, it was a nuisance. If anyone cares how I<br/>did it, I&apos;ll share the code.</p><p>Your thoughts are always welcome, of course.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2011 4:05:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 8/13/2011 10:53 AM, Jake Freivald wrote:<br/>&gt; This is called &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;.
