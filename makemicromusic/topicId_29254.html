It&apos;s a 10/7. I really liked the sound of that (1/1 - 10/7 -<br/>3/2) in the strings, and emphasized the 10/7 in the guitar part. It sounded<br/>right to me from the beginning, but I already knew the piece well enough to<br/>know that&apos;s what *had* to be there.</p><p>&gt; When the lower bell-like sounds happen, they are a magical weirdness.<br/>&gt; They&apos;re not bells exactly, not sure what they are.</p><p>Those are the tubular bells in the soundfont I use. They&apos;re not great as<br/>bells, but they have a nice non-harmonic quality to them. (The chimes that<br/>go in the B part of the piece are a nylon-stringed guitar being played<br/>impossibly high. I&apos;ve always liked that sound, but it&apos;s an abuse of the<br/>soundfont.) &quot;Magical weirdness&quot; is a wonderful thing.</p><p>&gt; When the piece finished, it jumped right into Mike Battaglia&apos;s first<br/>&gt; Comma pump in Hanson/Kleismic, which I also liked.</p><p>I like that too -- it has an interesting sound to it.</p><p>I have three more projects to do: One in Kleismic (Keemun, specifically),<br/>one in Magic, and one in extended Meantone. All four of these have nice<br/>thirds, so part of the job is comparing them compositionally.</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=29263 href="#29263">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2013 1:25:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 09/20/2013 02:24 PM, Jake Freivald wrote:</p><p>&gt; Actually, I should make sure I&apos;m using my terms right.
