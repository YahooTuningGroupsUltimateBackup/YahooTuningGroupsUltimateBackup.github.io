I am not adverse to having it truly be a sonic background blanket at times, but then again the music is appropriate to that. At the other end of the spectrum is a dedicated listening environment, where nothing is allowed (he says...) to disturb me, and I can sit there in the middle of a gorgeous soundstage and concentrate fully on the music itself.</p><p>But since part of the topic is mobile music, I have to say that the current generation of portable listening devices is really a boon. I listen mostly on extended evening walks (health), and there is something about moving out in the real world, with sounds floating in your head. It really is a different listening experience, neither worse nor better.</p><p>So much of this is apropos the genre of music one listens to as well. I have a pretty good suspicion you don&apos;t listen to a lot of pop, which frequently yields surface delights while not standing up to deep scrutinizing. Still good in my book.</p><p>Just one boy&apos;s listening experiences...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=17249 href="#17249">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2007 10:27:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt;db,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What do you need to know?

So when I listen to music it is directly and<br/>&gt;with the intention of focussing on it specifically.</p><p>I don&apos;t like background music either.  I never listen while<br/>working.  However, since high school I haven&apos;t had time to do<br/>much listening in-and-of-itself.  Driving is the best compromise<br/>I have, since on my commute, anyway, the driving part only takes<br/>two active brain cells.</p><p>But there are a lot of things working against me.  I drive<br/>a sports sedan, which isn&apos;t very quiet at highway speed.  And<br/>only two of the six speakers in my car stereo still function,<br/>and none of them were ever much good anyway.  So acoustic<br/>music is pretty much off-limits.  That&apos;s why I&apos;ve been listening<br/>to more rock and rap lately.  Bombastic piano music like the<br/>Sorabji works, but I wouldn&apos;t try a string quartet or a choir.</p><p>Also, my ability to me emotionally moved from listening to<br/>a recording seems to have diminished with age.  Like everything<br/>else, I suppose.  :)</p><p>&gt;I am aware of using music as sonic beautification:  in ugly<br/>&gt;soundscapes, the need arises to bring some beauty and this I<br/>&gt;understand fully.  So while driving, taking the bus or other activity<br/>&gt;in the sonic sewers of our urban environment, the use of music seems<br/>&gt;perfectly understandable.</p><p>I try to avoid ugly soundscapes at all costs!  My car&apos;s engine<br/>makes a delightful noise.  It&apos;s almost a shame to cover it up<br/>with music, but it&apos;s the best time I have to get in touch with<br/>that activity (music listening).</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve often thought of using three lawn mowers to make a composition<br/>&gt;of sliding tones, but since far too many hear that dreadful noise on<br/>&gt;Saturday and Sunday mornings, I don&apos;t feel the need to put it on a<br/>&gt;concert programme.
