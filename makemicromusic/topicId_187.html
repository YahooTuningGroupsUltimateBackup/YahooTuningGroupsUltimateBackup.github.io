It contained<br/>information on ways to get around purchasing and registering a nice<br/>piece of software, in a not-legal way (AFAIK), and it is the<br/>considered opinion that this is not the kind of thing we&apos;d like<br/>associated with our community.</p><p>I also want to say that I don&apos;t think the info was posted for any<br/>reason other than to be helpful, even if a little misguided. Let&apos;s<br/>not let that one post be anything more than the faint memory that it<br/>now is...</p><p>Back to the music, &apos;kay?</p><p>Yours,<br/>List-Mom</p></div>
