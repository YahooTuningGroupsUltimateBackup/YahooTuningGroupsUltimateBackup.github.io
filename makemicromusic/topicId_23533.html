We&apos;re wanting to get  a group of interested folks together to<br/>design around  microtonality -- instruments, concert formats, experiments,<br/>compositions....  You&apos;re invited to apply and join us in Urbana for the  12-week<br/>seminar!</p><p>Microtonal Design would be one of three Design Groups that would  be working<br/>near each other and cross-pollinating.  The others are  Feminist Composition and<br/>Design, and Connecting Cybernetics to Social  Change.</p><p>See the SDaS website for more information and to apply:<br/><a href="http://designingasociety.org/">http://designingasociety.org/</a></p><p>And here is a more specific description of the Microtonal Design  emphasis:</p><p>&ldquo;Microtonal&rdquo; refers to systems of pitch which functionally differ  from 12-tone<br/>equal temperament&mdash;the single acceptable tuning in the  current culture. That<br/>alternatives exist to the pitch systems hardwired  into keyboards and locked<br/>onto current guitars with 12-equal fretting,  is not only an uncommon idea, but<br/>potentially radical.  What one  discovers through working in Microtonal systems<br/>is that current usage of  &ldquo;in tune&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of tune&rdquo; hides distinctions which<br/>would permit the  generation of music otherwise considered impossible.<br/>Participation in  Microtonal Music-Making offers a &ldquo;freshening up&rdquo; of the ear,<br/>an  expansion of thinking around alternatives, and a rare chance to discover<br/>for oneself what has been inherited and what can be appointed.  To  design in<br/>microtonal systems is to offer an alternative to what everyone  already knows,<br/>to sing &ldquo;out of tune&rdquo; with conventional wisdom.  It is a  unique contribution to<br/>the question of designing a society.<br/>As Microtonality as a Doing is currently invisible, and in some  cases<br/>unthinkable, it needs Design.  There are existing Microtonal  Designs out there:<br/>modified or invented instruments, experimental  ensembles, workshops and study<br/>groups, email lists, and experiments in  concert format.  This seminar, taught<br/>at the Independent Media Center by  members of Oddmusic, is itself a Microtonal<br/>Design toward generating  new ones.  Participants at all levels of experience<br/>are welcome.  Come  with a project or come with an interest.</p><p>Hope to hear from you,<br/>Andrew</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2010 1:00:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fantastic news!
