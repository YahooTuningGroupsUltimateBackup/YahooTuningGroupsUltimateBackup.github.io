Have you tested<br/>the actual resolution on the /3 and above?  Yes, you can send finer<br/>resolution through MTS, but that doesn&apos;t mean the instrument will use<br/>all of that resolution.  A good way to check is to create the tuning in<br/>a MIDI patch editor, send it to the Proteus, then capture it back.

Often their tunings, however good the table, don&apos;t<br/>sound too good.</p><p>And of course in any acoustic instrument one is listening to many<br/>things besides the exact pitch of the fundamental. There are all the<br/>overtones, difference tones, resonances with other things, pitchless<br/>clatter. Some of it is as important as, or moreso than, the exct<br/>pitch of the fundamental.</p><p>And Jon&apos;s right, there are other uses for tuning tables. If you are<br/>using them in fancy engineering, for instance, there can be a big<br/>difference between things almost adding up to zero and things adding<br/>up exactly to zero. A good machine undoubtedly needs to reach a level<br/>of accuracy one can&apos;t hear, in and of itself.

For<br/>peaceable reasons, I hope, but I didn&apos;t ask.Some other engineer tried<br/>to model its flight and wound up dividing something by zero so that<br/>it appeared in the model to be going up in a sawtooth curve....<br/>Sounded like it would be quite hard to a shoot down, anyhow.</p><p>Judy</p><p>--<br/><a href="http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html">http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html</a></p></div>
