The Symph has taken a pay cut (and indeed, many Symphs around the country are having problems...Cleveland played without a contract for a while recently); the Denver Center, which is a superb regional theatre with 5 venues, has just dropped it&apos;s highly regarded conservatory program, and that means a bunch of artistic jobs are going; directors, vocal coaches, pianists, the plays they did every year (including a number of musicals); also, friends of mine have just had clubs cut their gigs this last week; and weddings, private parties, new years gigs...all are way down. There was a pic in the paper of a dude here who has sold out several venues lately...he&apos;s a DJ. Downtown Denver used to have a bunch of live venues; now most are clubs with sound systems/DJs...not so good here, and I&apos;m betting it&apos;s similar in a lot of cities. Indeed, live music, I believe, IS in trouble these days...many younger people have grown up with an astonishing array of ways to entertain/titillate themselves; not sure how a blues band can compete with something like Avatar, for many millions of folks (trying to make a point...you can dig both, of course). And, indeed, our current culture seems to be heading more and more towards mindless poo...the predominance of &quot;reality&quot; shows, and their simplistic content, should be proof enough of that.</p><p>   Chris used the word (s) religious conversion (I think I&apos;m close?) to refer to an attitude about getting more folks into non 12 tunings. That&apos;s not the way I feel about it...I think the field of tuning theory (and practice) is vast and profoundly beautiful, and there&apos;s no reason why it shouldn&apos;t be much more integrated into general musical practice. Why isn&apos;t the subject of tuning a part of every school music curriculum in the world? It should be, because how we structure our intervals has a profound effect on how music sounds...that&apos;s pretty obvious. Yet, it&apos;s virtually ignored, especially in Western oriented schools...and that should change, because we are overlooking a field which informs everything we do as musicians. I understand music on a much deeper level these days because of my understanding of such concepts as the Harmonic Series and Spiral of 5ths...again, these basic structures ARE where music itself originates...to not even know about this stuff means we are much less, as artists, then we could be. The dominance of the 12 eq system is way old and dated...getting harder and harder to hear much of interest in it these days, everything sounds sort of recycled (except for guys like Jeff Beck)....so the obvious answer to me is other systems. It&apos;s interesting....even overlooking the pop scene, I&apos;m somewhat amazed at the number of great jazz and classical folks I know (and many I don&apos;t) who think the concept of other systems is cool/hip, but they don&apos;t go the next step and compose/play in any of them. It&apos;s obvious (to me) that getting into other tunings would have a vast beneficial effect on the music of this planet, but it hasn&apos;t exactly caught fire yet...but, no reason why it can&apos;t, either. After the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan, music changed in an astonishing fashion almost overnight, and I, being a bit of a dreamer, still think something like that can happen again...why not? And, maybe tunings can be a part of that...why not? And I don&apos;t mean pop vs. classical, or anything like that...I mean MUSIC, overall.</p><p>   And, a real important point...I study/play in the field of tunings cause I personally LOVE doing it...whether or not anybody else does...that&apos;s the bottom line. And, I put out CD&apos;s of this love of mine cause I like to hear the music that can be created in this field..again, real simple. Sure, it&apos;s a hoot to know others who love it too, nice to share (and yes, this list is a real good thing), and hoping more artists will get into this...and I still believe they will. Again, why not?

I believe so...but certainly not if it (like the major music labels) prides itself on resting on it&apos;s laurels.  Truth is most people and &quot;kids&quot; don&apos;t care about the rich history of blues in the same way someone who owns a Playstation Portable gains little by knowing the history of the Gameboy.<br/>   For example, Neil, out of what I&apos;ve heard of your work, the only thing I think I could convince most kids is cool is your &quot;African Stick&quot; song because the rhythm sounds so organized and the mood so confident and energetic with so many free-spirited melodic hooks that it avoids feeling &quot;academic&quot;.  The rest I find often much more jittery feeling in mood, often more interesting to listen to but not &quot;decodable&quot; enough that I&apos;d be able to, say, explain my like for it to a friend and have them &quot;get me&quot; in most cases.  I call that &quot;litmus test&quot; the &quot;DJ test&quot; IE would you feel weird playing X song in front of a group of people...for an artist to truly have widespread influence among non-niche musicians, IMVHO, he has to consistently be able to pass the &quot;DJ test&quot;.<br/>   Then again I could say the same sort of things about artists like<br/>Steve Vai or Joe Satriani, both of who I think are fantastic.  Vai in particular, I believe, falls into the trap of being too hard to follow for too many people and, in fact, my favorite songs of his would get me frighteningly embarrassed to &quot;spin&quot;/play in public or spread word of mouth about.</p><p>  Perhaps the only artist I&apos;ve heard who consistently makes song-after-song with such qualities is Marcus Satellite...and it&apos;s not because he makes dance music (most micro-tonal dance I&apos;ve heard is actually pretty bad, sadly) but that he makes micro-tonal with the same sort of confidence and resolve in his songs you&apos;d expect from 12TET...and often better.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Why isn&apos;t the subject of tuning a part of every school music curriculum in the world&quot;<br/>    IMVHO, for the same reason I couldn&apos;t get credit for studying Dutch at an American school in Holland (pretty odd, right?)...there supposedly aren&apos;t enough places who use it (Dutch or Micro-tonal music) to make it worth teaching as applicable to the working world.</p><p>    Now so far as actually being able to quickly show even the low-attention span public how micro-tonal compares to 12TET...<br/>    ...I wonder what you all think would happen if someone made a program that would re-tune any mp3 to a fairly nearby (IE most notes within 25 cents) micro-tonal tuning?</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2010 4:52:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t think it would be bad if nobody in the world could make money from music.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be the listeners choice.
