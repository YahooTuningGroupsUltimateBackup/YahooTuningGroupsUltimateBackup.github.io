Even then it does<br/>cause a delay - I delayed downloading and listening to<br/>your .ogg file because I hadn&apos;t got a program that<br/>played them.</p><p>It&apos;s partly the techyness of the upload. Also though<br/>if one isnt&apos; a computer program downloading junky there<br/>is a tendency to not watn to make any change to your<br/>system once you know it works unless sure that you need<br/>it. Thi isnt&apos; the sort of thing to worry about in that<br/>respect but it is understandable. After all there is one<br/>thing about it that would concern a newbie user.<br/>In one of the dialogs there&apos;s a check box to associate<br/>all your media types with WinAmp and it is preset<br/>to selected.</p><p>But maybe you are quite happy with your existing palyer<br/>for mp3s, and movies and so on. I can imagine a newbie<br/>user mightn&apos;t understand the significance of that<br/>check box or mightn&apos;t even know that it is wise<br/>to check what a newly installed program will do to<br/>your file associations. So they might install it<br/>and then find that mp3s and everythign now show<br/>up in WinAmp and they may not know how to get it<br/>backto the wayit was before (may not even know<br/>the name of the program that played them before,<br/>just that it looked different).</p><p>That&apos;s just the sort of thing that can confuse<br/>and even alarm a newbie user. So they are wise<br/>considering their own way of looking at things<br/>and a realistic assesment oftheir own techy<br/>understanding of comptuers to be a bit<br/>cautious about installing a new player in order<br/>to play .ogg files.</p><p>So I think for the general public it is<br/>rather more of a tricky point - is the<br/>extra convenience of the smaller download<br/>size a reasonable offset against the possibliity<br/>of maybe causing problems for the users<br/>setup? I think at any rate one in the<br/>download link sectino of ones site one should<br/>warn them about the possbility that<br/>it wuold change your file associationas and<br/>tell them to unselect that check box unless<br/>they are sure they want to use WinAmp to play<br/>everythign on their p.c. Probably you do that<br/>I suppose.</p><p>Also for the general public, will they be<br/>techy enough to handle an install at all<br/>because for the first few months or maybe<br/>year or so of a first computer for a non<br/>techy user, they may never want to install<br/>anything new because it is all too techy<br/>for them, they dont&apos; even quiteunderstand<br/>the difference between a window, a program,<br/>a file and an image, never mind fully<br/>comprehending what it means to install<br/>a new program - easy as it seems later on.</p><p>But for a small group of users it seems<br/>a reasonable thing, certainly if there<br/>are say only two or three sharing by e-mail<br/>or a very small community. Between<br/>the two there will be some point where<br/>one decides the extra hassle of the install<br/>isn&apos;t worth it. But if one is a strong<br/>proponent of a new standard and are<br/>advocating a change of course that is<br/>another situation.</p><p>Anyway I&apos;d have thought MMM is possibly<br/>small enough apart frmo the matter of<br/>not being able to listen to fiels<br/>in libraries. If the librarian is<br/>techy enough and they have the authority<br/>to change their set up then fine.<br/>But if it is just a small branch library<br/>say, using a computer system rolled out to many<br/>libraries and no local computer support<br/>staff it isn&apos;t wisse for a local non techy<br/>librarian to mess around with the player<br/>of music files, and the file associations<br/>for all the library users I&apos;m sure, even<br/>if pretty confident it would work - but<br/>what if on the remote possibility that it<br/>doesn&apos;t work and something goes wrong,<br/>if not techy, what do they do then.... So<br/>would just depend.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
