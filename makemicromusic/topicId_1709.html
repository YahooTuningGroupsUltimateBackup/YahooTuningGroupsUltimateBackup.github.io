I&apos;ve been meaning to<br/>do it, but it&apos;s probably a whole days work.</p><p>An easier way with Reaktor 3 is to use the event tables.  These can even<br/>load text files, so the data entry should be easier.  It might be<br/>possible to generate a file from SCALA and use this as the input, but I<br/>haven&apos;t tried this yet.</p><p>Once you have the macro, you still have to insert it in the appropriate<br/>points into instruments that you want to use.  This shouldn&apos;t be too<br/>difficult, but does mean you&apos;ll have to edit every instrument that you<br/>use for microtunings.  You would want this macro to intercept the pure<br/>MIDI key data, then add pitch bend afterwards so any pitch bends are<br/>offset from the microtuning.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p><p>&gt; This is very interesting.
