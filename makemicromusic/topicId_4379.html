How many on this list actively host/manage/author web sites? If it is topical and needs to stay current, it is not always an easy proposition. The wide array of hardware/software that is available grows constantly, and it does so (mostly) ignorant of microtonal needs.</p><p>John L. has long kept his Microtonal Synthesis site as a resource for the community at large, and for this we should be grateful. We also need to be sharing and proactive, and if *you* find information about microtonal support, be it in soft or hard synths, post it with a note to John Loffink that it should be included in his survey, or at the least checked out.

Maybe a composer who is more interested in generating the music ahead of time and then entering it laboriously into a myriad of midi channels would be more complacent. Until and unless instruments support fully tuneable keyboards (as only a couple of mine do), I limit myself to scales/intonations that might fit into 12 slots.</p><p>I&apos;d be curious to hear other people&apos;s reactions, and this is only my take on it, but when the muse strikes, &apos;perfect&apos; (or near-perfect) is by far preferable to &apos;doable&apos;.</p><p>&gt;Maybe you might want to start a list of instruments that should be &gt;avoided, it might save people a little time.</p><p>I was thinking along alternate lines: John, if you still are attempting to maintain a somewhat comprehensive list (in the four pages), why not have a 5th page that lists *only* the microtonal synths, and simply put them in alphabetical order, broken out into tables of those that support full keyboard tuning, those that support single/repeatable octave tunings, and any other microtonal implementations?</p><p>And whether or not, in the coming days as we see the trends, you should have a separate page/table for soft synths as opposed to hard...</p><p>Any body have any other ideas?</p><p>Thanks to John, for the pages -<br/>Thanks to Mike, for wanting a new synth -<br/>Thanks to MMM, for people looking beyond the norm -</p><p>Cheers,<br/>ListMom</p></div><h3><a id=4411 href="#4411">ðŸ”—</a>Michael McGonagle &#x3C;fndsnd@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2003 12:35:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Loffink wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I can&apos;t find a reference to anything like that in the Q manual that I<br/>&gt; downloaded.
