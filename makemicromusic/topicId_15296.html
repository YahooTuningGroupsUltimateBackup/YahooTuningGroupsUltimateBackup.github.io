The up/downloads have *never* been reliable, and lots of people put stuff up and then walked away, leaving the space littered. Unless Prent can take it upon himself to get rid of the old stuff, you are probably better off using one of the temporary and/or free sites available. Others can chime in with recommendations.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2006 8:28:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have used (in order of satisfaction)<br/><a href="http://pages.google.com">http://pages.google.com</a> is quick, free, and relatively<br/>privacy-invasion free, especially if you already have an email<br/>account. 100Mb is enough to start.<br/><a href="http://tripod.lycos.com">http://tripod.lycos.com</a> is kludgey but it works<br/><a href="http://myspace.com">http://myspace.com</a> only lets you have 4 files<br/><a href="http://soundclick.com">http://soundclick.com</a> has more file space, but it requires<br/>registration for downloads.<br/><a href="http://zebox.com">http://zebox.com</a> only lets you have 3 (unless you pay) and makes the<br/>listener jump through more hoops than it should, like Soundclick.</p><p>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;I am trying to upload an MP3 file to the group, but even if I split it into three (largest is 2.8 MB), there&apos;s not enough room :(</p><p>--TRISTAN<br/>Dreaming of Eden is a Comic with no Pictures<br/><a href="http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com">http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com</a></p></div>
