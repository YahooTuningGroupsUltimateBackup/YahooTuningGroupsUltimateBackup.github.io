I&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt;be interested to hear any thoughts that any of you might have<br/>regarding<br/>&gt; &gt;these thorny and often contentious issues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would never put myself shoulder-to-shoulder with a deep human that<br/>I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; admired and been inspired by since the first time I heard him: Bob<br/>Moses.<br/>&gt; One of the most transcendent nights of music I have ever experienced<br/>was<br/>&gt; with Moses playing with Steve Swallow, Steve Kuhn, and Sheila<br/>Jordan. He is<br/>&gt; a deep and passionate non-drummer, and means a lot to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So all I can say is that the underlying tenor of his thoughts felt<br/>so<br/>&gt; extraordinarily close to what I&apos;ve had to talk about the last 6<br/>years<br/>&gt; regarding the works of Partch. That so many now choose to utilize<br/>&gt; transcriptions and arrangements, for the simple pleasure of adding a<br/>Partch<br/>&gt; work to their rep, with so little regard (or obvious disdain) for<br/>his<br/>&gt; personal, and idiosyncratic, aesthetic -  well, they are free to do<br/>so in<br/>&gt; the literal, but spiritually it is a bankrupt rendition. (I&apos;ve just<br/>had<br/>&gt; occasion to vent spleen on this issue, as myself along with Danlee<br/>Mitchell<br/>&gt; and a couple of other members of the Partch Ensemble were filmed and<br/>&gt; interviewed for a BBC documentary on Partch that will air in the<br/>spring.<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll have to see what flack I catch from naming names, if it<br/>doesn&apos;t get<br/>&gt; cut...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for sharing that, Dan - I&apos;m going to pass it along to members<br/>of the<br/>&gt; Harry Partch Foundation as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
