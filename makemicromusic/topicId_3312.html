I figured out how to<br/>&gt; retune it, and how to write my own tunings.<br/>&gt; Is there a way to get scala to [1] map the octave on to<br/>&gt; 127 notes [2] copy paste into a text file [3] directly save as this<br/>&gt; sort of file?</p><p>YES! Scala has built-in support for the VAZ file format. Just set your<br/>synth type to VAZ, and Scala can dump a tuning file for you.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>booeyschewy &#x3C;booeyschewy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2002 12:27:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; Todd B. wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Is there a way to get scala to [1] map the octave on to<br/>&gt; &gt;127 notes [2] copy paste into a text file [3] directly save as this<br/>&gt; &gt;sort of file?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems you need another reminder to read the docs.
