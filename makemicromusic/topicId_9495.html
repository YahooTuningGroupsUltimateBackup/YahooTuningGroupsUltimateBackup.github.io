I was mortified by the small numbers of people, knowing that this is the first full staging of one of Partch&apos;s &quot;Oedipus&quot; settings since 1954, and the musical preparation on this was really about as good as it gets. More detail later after I have absorbed and ruminated, but for anyone who can appreciate the artistic and musical goals of Partch, it would be criminal to miss a performance like this. Recommended, by someone who shelled out a trip from one coast to the other...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9496 href="#9496">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2005 12:21:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;List (and Joe),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;8 hours of flying time later, I get to post about Fridays performance<br/>&gt;*after* Joe has posted on Saturday&apos;s!

They need no details, save that they shouldn&apos;t wait another 50 years for a major Partch piece to be staged again.</p><p>And if anyone is lame enough to need an exact reason, I&apos;ll offer one: Partch initially had two reasons to examine pitches outside of 12 - and one of them was to have smaller intervals to set speech to. This production has leads (Oedipus, Jocasta, others) that are so adept at the microtonal intervals that they do achieve Partch&apos;s desired effect: one cannot tell where spoken word leaves off and intoned speech begins, and then leads into sung text. It is all one.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9498 href="#9498">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2005 12:10:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jonathan M.
