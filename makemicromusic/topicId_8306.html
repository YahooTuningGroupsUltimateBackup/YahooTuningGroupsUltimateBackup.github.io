Thanks very much to every one of you. I&apos;ve<br/>got quite a bit of homework now. You guys da best.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>It SEEMS very possible to fulfill this idea -- obviously it&apos;s been<br/>done before, as Mr. Fortuin has shown us.</p><p>    [By the way, Harold, I can&apos;t believe you went to the Hague!<br/>Seriously, that is my dream school. I briefly had a Dutch composition<br/>tutor who went there. I sincerely want to go there for composition, or<br/>perhaps SONOLOGY, as you did. Maybe you could email me and tell me a<br/>little about that place when you have time...?]</p><p>Still, I would like to create the interface (keyboard) with my hands<br/>and friends&apos; hands. Besides, previously designed layouts like the<br/>Starrlabs stuff (ie, the monster with 8,000 freaking buttons) cost<br/>about as much as Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Anyway, the information gap between building the electronics and<br/>encoding MIDI into them is sloooowly closing up for me. I found the<br/>CTM64 to be a good idea, although daisy-chaining many will be too<br/>expensive. At least it is apparently possible to stack the notes up<br/>high like the homemade MIDI pipe organ (which Carl Lumma provided the<br/>link to) with a &quot;merger&quot;. It would only take up a few channels -- no<br/>big sacrifice.</p><p>One main problem I see now is getting contacts that are VELOCITY<br/>SENSITIVE. More searching ahead.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>I started a profile on Soundclick, at Igliashon&apos;s suggestion.</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/codroid">http://www.soundclick.com/codroid</a></p><p>Hear my cheezy tunes.

Almost every region in Europe has its own repertoire, and many of those repertoires have unique keyboard layouts and timbral preferences (i.e. not every accordion in locked into vox humana voicings).  Regional accordion styles in the Americas -- from Cajun to Norte~no to Argentine are well known.  It is considered a classical instrument in much of Eastern Europe, and virtuosity there does not immediately mean a lack of musicality, and accordion is also taught as a &quot;classical&quot; instrumental subject in some conservatories in Germany and Italy. Hovhaness wrote a concerto for the instrument and Virgil Thomson&apos;s opera &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; features a prominent accordion. There are now a number of accordion virtuosi specializing in new (serious) music; IMHO Teodoro Anzelotti is perhaps the best.  (Pauline Oliveros has played an accordion tuned in two just intonation arrays for many years in both composed and improvised settings).  Add to this the rich repertoires for related instruments -- just think of English and Irish concertina music, or Argentine bandoneon (or Weill&apos;s use of Bandoneon in the original instrumentation for the Threepenny Opera, or contemporary works for bandoneon by Kagel, Mumma, Tudor or Oliveros)  -- and  we&apos;re talking a lot of good music.</p><p>I do have one question, though -- could there be some psychoacoustical connection between beer drinking and free-reed instruments?  It&apos;s been my experience -- from fieldwork in Ireland, Germany, and Hungary -- that the duration of tolerence for a free-reed timbre is remarkably parallel to the amount of beer consumed.</p><p>Happy New Year,</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p><p>Gordon Rumson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Greetings,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I was in Russia in 1978 (or so) I heard an accordionist play some<br/>&gt; movements of Pictures at an Exhibition.

The piano still has<br/>&gt; &gt;by far the largest body of repertoire of Western Classical music,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is a &quot;dead&quot; art, only slightly more popular than Latin.<br/>&gt;<br/>Mass popularity is by no means a measure of vitality or morbidity.  As long as a repertoire continues to be played with a spirit of adventure, with even an audience of one, it shows signs of life.  From the perspective performance practice there&apos;s no place more moribund than the so-called jazz program at North Texas or the Berklee School,  or anything that manages to escape from a major pop label.  On the other hand, the remarkable openings of attitudes towards performance practice that have taken place in many if not most of the traditional conservatories cannot be ignored.  Too, the dramatic reassesments of the extent and limits of the classical repertoire that have taken place in the past generation are signs of a dynamism that I just don&apos;t hear in pop music.</p><p>And as to the comparison with Latin, I just don&apos;t get it.  If the measure of popularity is whether or not Americans study it, then by that measure all foreign languages are unpopular in the US, as only a minority of Americans study a foreign language and only a sliver of those actually learn one with any competence.  I do know, however, a good handful of of fluent American Latinists, and most of them have shared compositions with me that are witty, often wise, and innovative within the tradition. And if the latest Vatican lexicon is any indicator, contemporary Latin continues to development and fill a(n important-to-some) niche as a legal standard. And the audience for piano recitals -- Franz Liszt played his recitals in halls seating a few hundred.  Nowadays, Koscis Zoltan plays his recitals in the orchestral hall at the Liszt Conservatory here in Budapest, seating a thousand or more. Always sold out.  Pogorelich seldom plays before a house with an empty seat, and there are a number of pianists with similar draws. The reports of the death of the piano recital are premature.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=8343 href="#8343">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2005 3:19:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The instrument of Dionysis was the Aulos<br/>Aulos is to wine what accordion  is to beer</p><p>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I do have one question, though -- could there be some<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;psychoacoustical &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;connection between beer drinking and free-reed instruments?
