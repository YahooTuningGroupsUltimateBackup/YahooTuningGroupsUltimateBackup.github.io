In the other movements of the piece there are some notated microtones.</p><p>juhani</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2011 11:42:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Some would include Carter&apos;s, some Chostakovitch&apos;s;</p><p>Some Prokofiev&apos;s... -Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2011 3:15:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Juhani wrote:<br/>&gt;Yes, and I&apos;ve written two myself, the second one of which is rather<br/>&gt;pretty, I think: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNKGD_wmeVc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNKGD_wmeVc</a><br/>&gt;But this is off-topic, as that&apos;s not microtonal; there are microtones<br/>&gt;in the second movement but that&apos;s not online, except in iTunes.</p><p>Wow, great work!
