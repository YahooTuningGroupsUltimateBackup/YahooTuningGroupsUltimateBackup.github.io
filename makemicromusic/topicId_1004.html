The<br/>&gt;greatest thinkers EVER in JI never even used electricity to learn. Ears<br/>&gt;work in the dark.</p><p>Well, I have to disagree.  Sure, acoustic instruments are the cat&apos;s<br/>meow, but twiddling electronic knobs is the best way to listen to<br/>various tunings precisely.  &quot;Rubbish&quot;?  Not in my book!  I can&apos;t claim<br/>to belong to the cadre of &quot;greatest thinkers ever&quot; (in JI or anything<br/>else), but I _can_ lay claim to having benefitted greatly from having<br/>tunable electronic synths under my hands.  If I can ever retrofit<br/>adaptive tuning to an acoustic piano, I&apos;ll be in heaven!</p><p>I guess I don&apos;t see why electronic and acoustic instruments should be<br/>pitted against each other, with one declared a &quot;winner&quot; by one camp,<br/>and a &quot;loser&quot; by the other.  I would rather encourage everyone to make<br/>use of all available instruments of every sort.</p><p>I agree that ears work best in the dark.  Luckily it is perfectly<br/>possible, even easy, to listen to music, acoustic or electronic, in any<br/>lighting conditions one desires.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=1041 href="#1041">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2001 4:21:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, George.  I definitely agree that spending a lot of money on<br/>electronic goodies is not necessary.  A $50 sound-card in a PC or Mac<br/>is plenty to start with, with a used 61-note keyboard a nice addition.<br/>Free software such as Midi Relay, Scala, and FTS (not quite free, but<br/>close) completes the picture for basic (or even not-so-basic) tuning<br/>exploration.</p><p>I guess your use of the word &quot;rubbish&quot; pushed my button.  Thanks for<br/>the clarification!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=1042 href="#1042">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2001 10:12:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>added a little improv. in Werckmeister III to my improvisations<br/>page, this time in 7/4 as 4/4 + 3/4 which is a favourite<br/>time sig.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm</a></p><p>Looks as if my p.c. may need to go in for repair;<br/>if so, may be off-line for a few days,...</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1043 href="#1043">ðŸ”—</a>Wally &#x3C;earth7@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2001 6:29:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George</p><p>Maybe I need to better explain myself. I believe it was I who started<br/>this string of posts when I mentioned some inexpensive way to get<br/>started with exploring tuning theory and JI using the computer.</p><p>I in fact have sat at my Hammond organ and sang scale steps to a<br/>drone and was very happy when I (for the first time) heard a true<br/>perfect fifth as well as a third. I then played the specific tone on<br/>the keyboard itself which was a third above the tonic and a fifth<br/>above the tonic and to my surprise they sounded different!</p><p>However, my ultimate goal aside from learning about JI is to<br/>MakeMicroMusic;) using the computer so I can upload my music to this<br/>group for others to hear. That&apos;s it in a nut shell!</p><p>You have a point when you said, &quot;Twiddle sound, not knobs.&quot; But I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure I&apos;ll eventually &quot;wind up like yourself - chest deep in<br/>state of the art &quot;software&quot; and gizmos, and loving every moment of<br/>it. You gotta admit, flicking on the computer is alot easier than<br/>hooking up rack load of audio gear!</p><p>I&apos;m going to settle in with Scala and FTS for now as well as a real<br/>inexpensive audio and midi sequencer by Power Tracks Called Power<br/>Tracks Pro Audio. It only costs $29 US dollars belive it or not. I<br/>don&apos;t think it allows for alternate tunings but at least its a start<br/>in sequencing.Check it out at,<br/><a href="http://www.powertracks.com/powertracks.htm">http://www.powertracks.com/powertracks.htm</a></p><p>Your correct in saying, &quot;The greatest thinkers EVER in JI never even<br/>used electricity to learn&quot;. Believe me I totally agree! I&apos;m reminded<br/>about it everytime I attempt to learn the math involved!</p><p>Please, don&apos;t get me started on the math, its Friday!:)</p><p>Stay Well<br/>Wally</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., George Zelenz &lt;ploo@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Wally et al,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; used to be a monocord and a small lyre/ harp were the bomb for<br/>getting<br/>&gt; started.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess thats just old school thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t recommend enough just picking up a guitar or making a<br/>cheesy harp<br/>&gt; and playing either open strings of fretted things, or plucking<br/>strings whose<br/>&gt; sound is found.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Train your ear?
