Source is available for the interpreter. Runs<br/>everywhere, and already handles MIDI data as a primitive data type. Has a<br/>piano-roll interface already. You can do operations like &quot;foo.pitchbend =<br/>n&quot; to set pitchbends. It can handle MIDI file I/O as well as real time.</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.nosuch.com/keykit/">http://www.nosuch.com/keykit/</a></p><p>The only drawback is that it&apos;s not *that* widely used, and support is<br/>minimal. Real time functions are apparently easy to write, such as:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.nosuch.com/keykit/mailarchive/msg02630.html">http://www.nosuch.com/keykit/mailarchive/msg02630.html</a></p><p>I haven&apos;t used it much, but it does work and is fast, and can handle<br/>real-time manipulations, and multiple MIDI device outputs. There are lots<br/>of examples provided with the source.</p><p>The more major question for anyone who wants to do this really seems to me<br/>whether anyone has any adaptive algorithms that they&apos;re willing to share.<br/>DeLaubenfels&apos; algorithms seem pretty good, as one can see by trying<br/>JIRelay, but the method is not well enough described for someone to<br/>implement without a lot of experimentation/re-invention. These days, if I<br/>have time for doing anything, I would rather do the music, not the<br/>programming...! My impression is that John D. was hoping to make some kind<br/>of commercial venture, and is working on his algorithms. But I haven&apos;t<br/>heard anything in years about it. Presumably, the product is dead, and the<br/>algorithms aren&apos;t available.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=10623 href="#10623">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 3:37:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The more major question for anyone who wants to do this really seems<br/>to me<br/>&gt; whether anyone has any adaptive algorithms that they&apos;re willing to<br/>share.<br/>&gt; DeLaubenfels&apos; algorithms seem pretty good, as one can see by trying<br/>&gt; JIRelay,</p><p>JIRelay was developed *before* the adaptive-tuning algorithms John<br/>ultimately put together, and is very simple in its logic.</p><p>&gt; but the method is not well enough described for someone to<br/>&gt; implement without a lot of experimentation/re-invention.</p><p>The adaptive-tuning algorithms were pretty clearly laid out by John in<br/>his various posts.
