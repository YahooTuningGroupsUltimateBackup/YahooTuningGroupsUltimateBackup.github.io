They send you around and around; the pointers to supposed<br/>price lists don&apos;t go to pages that give prices. I can&apos;t find any actual<br/>prices! In one place, I did find the phrase, &quot;Four Plug-Ins for about 500$&quot;<br/>for a pack of their effects. That&apos;s way out of my price range!</p><p>Also, their plug-in products are protected by hardware dongles, and I<br/>categorically won&apos;t buy any such software. That&apos;s unfortunate, because it<br/>looks like they have nice products.</p><p>So I&apos;m still looking... What I&apos;m looking for is a fairly simple in-line<br/>effect that works like the VAZ Modular&apos;s built-in oscillocope (which<br/>doesn&apos;t work as an &quot;effect&quot; only as a synth module). Midicode has a similar<br/>one, too, but it&apos;s not VST.</p><p>So I&apos;m still looking... Thanks!</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
