But that could be that I&apos;m<br/>not a fan of atonal jazz language very much, and I have to say I&apos;m not a big<br/>fan of 1/4 tone music, which I think might as well be 12-equal.</p><p>I can tell it was well written/thought out/arranged, so it must be my own<br/>personal predilections that made it less than exciting to me. Don&apos;t feel<br/>bad--lots of good/great music does this to me when I&apos;m not in the mood for<br/>it. So it says nothing about the quality of your work! ;)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p></div>
