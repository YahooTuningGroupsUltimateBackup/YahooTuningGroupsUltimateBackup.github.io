The fifths and fourths<br/>are very pleasing in the timbre you chose, and I would not have<br/>guessed that they were actually&#x9;almost 10 cents respectively narrow<br/>and wide of 4:3 and 3:2.</p><p>The modal flavor sounds Dorian or Aeolian to me, and your setting fits<br/>it nicely. Those beautiful minor thirds of around 277 cents are what I<br/>term _Monzian thirds_ (or in Latin _tertiae Monzianae_) after Joe<br/>Monzo, who for one of his pieces sought the ideal tuning for a certain<br/>third and selected 279 cents by ear, then deciding on a just ratio of<br/>75:64 or around 275 cents. Thus I use the term for a third somewhere<br/>around 274-280 cents, with 26-EDO right in the middle of the range.</p><p>A scale in 26-EDO with some neutral intervals occurs to me which could<br/>actually be seen as a tempered version of a beautiful JI tuning by the<br/>Persian theorist Ibn Sina with steps of 14:13-13:12-8:7 in each<br/>tetrachord (or 128-139-231 cents). Here the two neutral seconds are<br/>equal (3 tuning steps), and the 8:7 is virtually just, a notable<br/>interval as Herman Miller has described here.</p><p>0      138      277       508       692     831     969       1200<br/>0       3        6         11       15      18       21        26<br/>   138     138      231        184     138      138      231<br/>    3       3        5          4       3        3        5</p><p>! 26EDO-IbnSina.scl<br/>!<br/>Tempering of Ibn Sina&apos;s 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3-3/2-21/13-7/4-2/1<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 138.46154<br/> 276.92308<br/> 507.69231<br/> 692.30769<br/> 830.76923<br/> 969.23077<br/> 2/1</p><p>This includes the small neutral third of 18 steps at 831 cents, very<br/>close to a just 21:13, and a 3-step neutral second very close to<br/>13:12.

It could be interesting to start with a scale like this and fill in the other notes of a 12-note per octave keyboard to have a range of different scales to pick from. Here&apos;s one possibility I came up with, having a diatonic scale on the white keys; I&apos;m sure there are many other ways of filling in the extra notes that would make sense.</p><p>! 12of26-IbnSina-plus.scl<br/>!<br/>Tempering of Ibn Sina&apos;s 1/1-14/13-7/6-4/3-3/2-21/13-7/4-2/1<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 138.46154<br/> 184.61538<br/> 276.92308<br/> 369.23077<br/> 507.69231<br/> 553.84615<br/> 692.30769<br/> 830.76923<br/> 876.92308<br/> 969.23077<br/> 1061.53846<br/> 2/1</p></div>
