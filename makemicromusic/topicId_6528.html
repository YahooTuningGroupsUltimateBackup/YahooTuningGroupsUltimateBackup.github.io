Judged as a<br/>meantone it&apos;s in the region between 31 and 43, or 1/4 to 1/5 comma.<br/>Meantone[17] is simply what you get from 16 sucessive meantone fifths.<br/>If you take these meantone fifths to be those of 43 equal, you can get<br/>something quite close to the pitch bends of Mark&apos;s scale from a<br/>particular choice of 11 out of the 17 notes.</p><p>At this point if someone wants to verify my conclusions independently<br/>it would be nice; I&apos;d also like to hear from Mark concerning how,<br/>precisely, he tuned his scale, and if he knows why it seems more like<br/>43 than 19. In any case, the scale and tuning he used seems to work to<br/>produce actual music, which is the bottom line.</p></div><h3><a id=6545 href="#6545">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

Question-am I hearing the pitch bend sometimes adjusting<br/>*after* the attack of the note, or is the scale fooling my ear? This happens<br/>when an event scheduler doesn&apos;t give first priority to the bend data over the<br/>midi note data, and would indicate a bug in the software. (I know this<br/>because I wrote a midi file player in Python, and found this out by trial and<br/>error) The only way to confirm that this is happening in your rendition,<br/>Gene, would be to hear the .wav file slowed down somehow, with DSP software<br/>like &apos;sox&apos; or something...</p><p>I like seeing this kind of thing on MMM....it makes my day to hear good new<br/>music and collaboration like this !</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6560 href="#6560">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2004 12:52:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

Did Mark<br/>write these &quot;swoops&quot; into his piece (which I was otherwise quite<br/>enjoying, by the way)? Gene&apos;s &apos;piano&apos; piece _The 45000 fingers of Dr<br/>S_ also exhibited these effects, as I mentioned, but Gene didn&apos;t seem<br/>to think it was a problem.  I wonder if it isn&apos;t an artifact of<br/>Gene&apos;s rendering process . . . I know I&apos;ve heard these sorts of<br/>problems before when trying out various MIDI relaying programs . . .</p><p>Here&apos;s an experiment to try:</p><p>Two files.</p><p>One simply alternates between C and C# 50 times, using a single<br/>instrument and single channel.</p><p>The other alternates C -50 cents and C +50 cents, 50 times, using a<br/>single instrument and single channel.</p><p>Make them both the same speed, quite fast.</p><p>Do the two files sound like the same sound, 50 cents different from<br/>one other, or do they sound rather different?</p><p>This might help us test Aaron&apos;s question . . .</p></div>
