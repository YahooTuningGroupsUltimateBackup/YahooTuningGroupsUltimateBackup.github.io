That is my band.</p><p>Although the occasional microtonality of the band is indeed &quot;naive&quot;<br/>(rather, incidental), we do plan to do some ... more &quot;intentionally&quot;<br/>microtonal music. Avery loves that stuff. Since I joined the band<br/>about a year ago (when Kate &amp; Qarly left), I told them it would be<br/>very possible to do that.</p><p>Since we use homemade instruments more often than not, I&apos;s like to<br/>employ the TUBULON that Igliashon and I built. The tubulon is a subset<br/>of 22-tet, in the form of two overlapping scales: 1) a mode of<br/>Porcupine-8 and 2) a mode of static symmetrical major of Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>development.</p><p>If anyone is around the Bay Area of CA, please contact either the band<br/>for info, or me -- so we can MMM together sometime!</p><p>-Stevie Hryciw<br/>ps<br/>We also use a blender, but I haven&apos;t figured out what scale it&apos;s in<br/>yet. :$</p><p>--------------------------------<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A couple of years ago, I was in a local art gallery and there was<br/>this<br/>&gt; band called Corpus Callosum playing.
