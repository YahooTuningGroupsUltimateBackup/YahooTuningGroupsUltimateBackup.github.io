For<br/>example, think of what happens when you play a looped pitched sample<br/>with a very simple looping oscillator, like &apos;loscil&apos; in CSound. If you<br/>play a pure fifth, the rhythm of the sample will be 3:2. If it was a<br/>meantone fifth, it would be 1:1.4953</p><p>One could easily set up textures this way with a very simple sampler<br/>engine, and if you used multisamples, make sure that the various<br/>lengths of each .wav closely correspond to a theoretical ideal of<br/>temperament (or not fr JIers) by using the correct ratios between .wav<br/>files of the number of frames.</p><p>I&apos;ve done this type of thing with noise based samples, for instance ,<br/>I have a recording I did of someone cutting open a box with a<br/>boxcutter that I made with binaural mics, and I loaded it into CSound<br/>as a sample, and play it from a MIDI keyboard. Of course using one<br/>sample gets one into aliasing issues if it gets stretched to far, you<br/>can however use some interpolation features of CSound I<br/>think....anyway, you can get some nice &apos;summer evening with crickets&apos;<br/>or &apos;inside the clock shop with Ligeti&apos; type textures going, especially<br/>if you do some random panning of each instance...it would be nice to<br/>hear this kind of thing with wine glass or Tibetan bowl samples.</p><p>-AKJ</p></div>
