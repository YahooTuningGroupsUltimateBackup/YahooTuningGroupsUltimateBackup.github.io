This method enables the use of up to 24<br/>different pitches per octave, and further  notes can be retuned by<br/>repeating the procedure.</p><p>The perfect solution to this limit of 12 per octave is to allow<br/>different tunings to be assigned for different tracks simultaneously.<br/>I believe that Cubase can now do this, and I have been nagging the<br/>Apple developers to provide a similar capability in future updates of<br/>Logic Pro.<br/>BTW I have also been nagging them for microtuning capability to be<br/>added to Logic Express and Garageband.</p><p>You can find free downloads of many useful tuning codes for various<br/>applications (including Logic, Melodyne 2 &amp; 3, Cubase, and Cameleon) at:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com//midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com//midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@... ------------  Promoting global<br/>harmony through LucyTuning  ------- for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies, contest and Flash cartoon go to<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy CD from:<br/><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a><br/>Lullabies at iTunes (if you already have iTunes installed):<br/><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist">http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist</a>?<br/>a=5165209&amp;s=143441<br/>To install iTunes go to:<br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2006 12:34:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles Lucy wrote:</p><p>&gt;Setting up the microtuning values in the Melodyne interface can be  &gt;very confusing, as it is designed at present, for they have attempted  &gt;to make it &quot;idiot-proof&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sounds confusing.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
