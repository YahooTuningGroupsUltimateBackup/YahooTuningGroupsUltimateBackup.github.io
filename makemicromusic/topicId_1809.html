Retunes to scale entered as cents, ratios or whatever. Uses pitch bends and re-mapping of midi channels to do this rather than tuning tables - so it will work with any GM compatible synth or soundcard. Includes many of the SCALA scales and modes, and one can use it to make a searchable drop lists of all the SCALA scales and all the SCALA modes.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1812 href="#1812">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2002 1:04:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert!<br/>    This scale is really interesting to me in that it has a big overlap with my Centaur<br/> but takes a different turn see mine below his</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1<br/>&gt; from<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.telocity.com/~acanright/piano/index.htm">http://members.telocity.com/~acanright/piano/index.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>1/1 13/12 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 13/8 5/3 7/4 11/6 2/1 David&apos;s</p><p>1/1 21/20 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 7/5  3/2  14/9 5/3 7/4 15/8 2/1 Kraig&apos;s</p><p>It illustrates how a slight preference for something can cause such interesting musical<br/>shifts with David opting for higher harmonics and myself more 7-limit sub structures.</p><p>Possibly with some extra reeds i have around i can have his as an alternate on one of my<br/>pump organs.
