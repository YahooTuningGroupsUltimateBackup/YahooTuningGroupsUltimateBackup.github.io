How many people<br/>&gt;   on this list have created a genre that is new, and not at<br/>&gt;   all like any other? (yes,disco and rock are different).</p><p>I think we&apos;ve reached an impasse on this subject of genre; I can&apos;t<br/>agree with your definition of the word, because I don&apos;t think it makes<br/>a lot of sense.  I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any music that&apos;s &quot;not at all&quot;<br/>like any other music, regardless of genre.  On a physical level, all<br/>music is vibration, so every genre has that in common.  Perceptually,<br/>all of the music I can think of contains elements of melody, harmony,<br/>and rhythm.  Therefore, all music is fundamentally similar, and the<br/>similarities between any genre are vastly greater than the<br/>differences.</p><p>I think &quot;genre&quot; is a perceptual tool that people use to distinguish<br/>between that basic similarity:  if a large body of music contains some<br/>pieces that are slower (for example) and some that are faster, or some<br/>that have drums and backbeats and some that have string parts and<br/>waltz meters, we call them different genres.  An alien race 10,000<br/>years from now might classify &quot;western music&quot; as a single genre from<br/>Bach to Saturday Night Fever, and their classification wouldn&apos;t be any<br/>more right or wrong than ours.  Since the notion of genre is something<br/>that we impose on the music and not something which is inherent in the<br/>music itself, it doesn&apos;t make sense to use that as the basis for the<br/>potential of future creative endeavors.</p><p>&gt; +++++++++++++++Don&apos;t understand your big words. (I&apos;m not<br/>&gt;                a expert at this stuff.)</p><p>My apologies. I don&apos;t mean to put anyone off with &quot;big words.&quot;</p><p>&gt; ++++++++++++++I don&apos;t see how spending a small amount of one&apos;s<br/>&gt;   limited time in 15, and some in 17, and some in 19, and some<br/>&gt;   in 24, and some in 31, 32, 33, 38,51, 65,67,69,70 can result<br/>&gt;   in virtuosity or even competency.</p><p>It can, in the same way that playing rock music won&apos;t make you a worse<br/>classical player.  Playing many different kinds of music increases<br/>one&apos;s understanding of music *as a whole,* and playing in many<br/>different tunings will also (imo) increase one&apos;s understanding of<br/>tuning as a whole.  When you start playing music, you don&apos;t have to<br/>lock yourself into playing Bach or Metallica... why should you lock<br/>yourself into one tuning?  Expertise in one style of music comes<br/>*after* general knowledge, not vice versa; and the same can (and<br/>should) be true for tuning.</p><p>I think that&apos;s all I have to say, if you want to continue the<br/>discussion, feel free to e-mail me OL...</p><p>-Chris</p></div><h3><a id=12020 href="#12020">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 12:17:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot;<br/>&lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ++++++++++++++I don&apos;t see how spending a small amount of one&apos;s<br/>&gt;   limited time in 15, and some in 17, and some in 19, and some<br/>&gt;   in 24, and some in 31, 32, 33, 38,51, 65,67,69,70 can result<br/>&gt;   in virtuosity or even competency.</p><p>It&apos;s a great way to understand tuning *in general*.</p><p>Moreover, the greater the<br/>&gt;   number of divisions of the octave that are used by microton-<br/>&gt;   alists, the smaller the body of work for any given one.
