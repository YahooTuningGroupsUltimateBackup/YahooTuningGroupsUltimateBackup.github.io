I&apos;ve been studying the origin of the<br/>Pythagorean Scale. If you own the classic book titled, &quot;The Physics<br/>of Music&quot; by Alexander Wood 7th edition revised by J.M. Bowsher,<br/>please turn to page 184. On page 184 there is a table which looks<br/>like this:</p><p>Note ................  d    eb   d#    Fb    e    f    e#    gb    f#<br/>Interval above &quot;c&quot;     204  294  314   384   408  498  522   588   612</p><p>The table lists d# as being 314 cents. According to my calculations,<br/>d# should be 318 Cents. Can anyone verify this?</p><p>The method for figuring out the &quot;cents&quot; related to each frequency can<br/>be found starting at the bottom of page 182.</p><p>Thank you,<br/>Wally</p></div>
