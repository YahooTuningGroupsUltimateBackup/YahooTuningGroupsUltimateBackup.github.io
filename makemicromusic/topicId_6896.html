Pick a file and the instrument is tuned.</p><p>(This is in demo version 1.302)</p><p>It is a nice instrument, but almost all the patches they send with it are very spacey, ambient, trance-type patches. This is not a bad thing at all, and the instrument sounds very nice. But most of the patches wouldn&apos;t really matter all that much if you used a particular tuning, because they already contain so much pitch information in them already!</p><p>However, it is another synth that looks pretty deep, and if someone wanted to spend some time crafting patches that really shine in other tunings, it might be just the ticket. I can&apos;t remember how many presets it ships with, but there are probably useable ones in there.</p><p>Another micro-tuneable demo that anyone can try (my version is PC, can&apos;t remember if they support Mac OS)...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6945 href="#6945">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 3:20:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Another micro-tuneable demo that anyone can try (my version<br/>&gt; is PC, can&apos;t remember if they support Mac OS)...</p><p>Yes.

It&apos;s an interesting<br/>alternative to physical modeling as far as creating sounds that have<br/>an unusually &quot;alive&quot; quality.  The resysthesis features are also<br/>another point of interest for me.  Hopefully it will integrate better<br/>with Numerology as an AU than VirSyn Cube (the only other commercial,<br/>microtunable additive/resynthesizing soft synth), which reportedly<br/>crashes it.</p><p>BTW, with my 2nd orchestra, I&apos;m getting an education in tuning.  This<br/>is old hat to you seasoned arrangers, but I just learned that one<br/>rehearsal technique to fix a questionable passage is to have the<br/>players in the questionable section (e.g. horns, oboes, etc.) play a<br/>selected note from a selected measure and listen to the resulting<br/>chord.  Almost always, the source of the offending sound turns out to<br/>be beating going on.  The offender(s) are quickly identified and<br/>asked to correct their intonatino.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
