I posted about that<br/>before - that Alison Barr said they were particularly keen to have classical<br/>music, as they often get asked why they don&apos;t have more of it.</p><p>However, there&apos;s enough contemporary classical music for it to be<br/>encouraging that it came #1.</p><p>Someone is liking this music at first hearing.</p><p>Prob. if other members of the list posted music there, they would go to the<br/>top too. Yours for sure I&apos;d have thought.</p><p>Maybe we should all migrate to Australia... :-)</p><p>If anyone is interested, they have no auditioning of the pieces, except<br/>for a copyright check, and your music gets on the site usually the<br/>same day or next day after uploading it (except at weekends)<br/>- though they say on the site that it is within three days.<br/>So, it&apos;s a pretty good service.</p><p>Also the uploading seems to be smoother now than before - last two<br/>pieces I uploaded got there first time I tried (on 56 K modem<br/>connection).</p><p>A nice thing about it is that ones visitors don&apos;t need to join<br/>in order to listen to the music - you just give the url for the<br/>site and they can hear it straight away - while at <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> they<br/>have to join first before they can hear anything, and agree<br/>to receive a newsletter from them.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
