As you know, I don&apos;t like the AXiS much, because the<br/>buttons are configured in a way that makes it impossible to set up a<br/>Bosanquet layout, and I Don&apos;t Like That.</p><p>However, the fact that one row of the buttons goes completely<br/>horizontally does make it rather useful for setting up Porcupine[7]<br/>layouts, which I in fact Do Like Very Much. So I might do it. However,<br/>I heard a while ago that the iPad had a few interesting hex button<br/>apps out on it, and obviously despite that the iPad lacks tactile<br/>feedback, something like this would be infinitely more configurable<br/>than the AXiS-49. Furthermore, used iPads on eBay aren&apos;t expensive at<br/>all, especially the older iPad 1, and so they&apos;re about in the same<br/>price range as the AXiS.</p><p>So I ask, are the microtonal apps on iPad decent enough to consider a<br/>cheap iPad 1 instead of an AXiS-49? Are the generalized keyboard<br/>layouts decent enough to use? Does some option to interface them with<br/>MIDI or OSC exist, so that we can get microtonal sounds out of them?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=27637 href="#27637">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2011 11:36:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_90517.html#90519">/tuning/topicId_90517.html#90519</a></p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_94722.html#94738">/tuning/topicId_94722.html#94738</a></p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 11:15 PM 4/7/2011, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve been thinking about giving up on my hopes and dreams and just<br/>&gt;buying an AXiS.
