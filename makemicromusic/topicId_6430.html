Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2004 4:06:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>List,</p><p>Again, just a brief-housekeeping: it looks like with the up-tick in enthusiasm, there may be a desire for room for files on MMM. There is a lot of stuff that has been just _sitting_ there for quite a while, so...</p><p>In about a week&apos;s time I am going to remove files, and I think I&apos;ll just clear out anything that hasn&apos;t been uploaded in 2004. If there is anything that I am not *sure* about I&apos;ll write and ask, but I know there are items being stored by people who no longer are involved in the list. And I&apos;ll be asking people to make sure they make a folder to upload into.</p><p>This gives you plenty of time to make sure you&apos;ve got what you need, and after that we&apos;ll have room for the occasional file upload. Bear in mind that (in the past) we&apos;ve had trouble with files, esp. music/mp3 files bigger than 1mb trying to download, which is the main reason I put up the money for <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>. If you have an mp3 you want to share and don&apos;t have a place to upload it, write me offlist and I&apos;ll let you know what to do.</p><p>So: I&apos;ll be file cleaning around the 7th or 8th of the month, get what you need if you need to before then.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>ListMom</p></div>
