I figured<br/>atonality<br/>&gt; was best suited for an ET.  This was  based on some (obviously very<br/>&gt; spotty) experiments I had done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But after doing some more recent experiements, I&apos;ve completely<br/>changed my<br/>&gt; mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mentioned, for example, that tuning up the set &quot;014&quot; (in forte&apos;s<br/>&gt; set-theory notation) seemed pointless----   1/1: 16/15 : 5/4  just<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem that exciting.   This is the kind of thing I had tried in my<br/>initial<br/>&gt; experiments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul suggested 16:17:20 (I believe)</p><p>yes.</p><p>&gt; ,  and I thought about this.  The<br/>&gt; most powerful aural experiences I had had with JI were when I could<br/>really<br/>&gt; hear the caressing &quot;buzz&quot; of partials locking in together.</p><p>i think it&apos;s really the &apos;locking&apos; of the combinational tones and the<br/>virtual pitch, produced by the fundamentals and the partials, not<br/>the &apos;locking&apos; of the partials themselves. for if it were, a utonal<br/>chord like 1/(16:17:20) would lock just as well -- it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; so anyway, I took one of the chords from my string orc piece, namely<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Eb3, G3, Bb3, F4, A4, E5, F#5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (4=middle C octave.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried to make every tone an overtone of Eb.  Hence,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;     4:5:6:9:11:17:19<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It worked!!  It totally locked in.  by ear, I could tell that this<br/>is what<br/>&gt; I was trying to achieve in 12Tet.</p><p>cool! just as i suspected.</p><p>&gt; In fact, I realized that in spacing out all the chords in this<br/>piece, I<br/>&gt; was just composing out selections of the overtone series, often with<br/>&gt; (seemingly random) higher overtones (i.e.  13+)!!  It was a<br/>depressing and<br/>&gt; cool revelation at the same time!!  I thought I had some sort of<br/>unique<br/>&gt; sense of harmony, but no, I&apos;m just an overtone guy!!</p><p>i&apos;m glad i intuited your compositional motives correctly.</p><p>&gt; fun fun fun.  more experiments.  more music.  yay.</p><p>so glad i could push you in this direction, which is so different<br/>from my own interests. i no longer feel like i&apos;m wasting my time on<br/>this list.<br/>--- End forwarded message ---</p></div><h3><a id=2273 href="#2273">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
