Every now and then, I have to wonder why I subscribe to ALL of<br/>these lists, what with high bandwidth and little time. Last night I had the<br/>sort of experience that makes sifting through the emails all worthwhile.</p><p>Through the tuning list, I&apos;d met overtone singer Jim Cole, whose cassette I<br/>already had acquired a number of years ago. We&apos;d corresponded offlist a few<br/>times, and planned a visit when he was going to be on vacation here in New<br/>Hampshire where I live.</p><p>Last night we met up in person for the first time at the park next to the<br/>music store where I teach, we talked for a while and watched the almost full<br/>moon rise over the river. When it got buggy, we went inside the store with<br/>our instruments. We tuned up and improvised together for a while, Jim<br/>playing his backpacker tanpura and singing, and me with my recently acquired<br/>fretless acoustic guitar. Magical MicroMusicMaking at its absolute best!</p><p>This is the truly wonderful thing about the internet, and on lists such as<br/>these, to be able to find and build a community of artists and friends with<br/>similar interests all over the world. Here&apos;s to much more micromusicmaking<br/>with new friends!</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
