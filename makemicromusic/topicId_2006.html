Did I say *very??*  :)</p><p>This was *really* interesting.  I got it to work, and recorded in a<br/>piece with a cello line and another line with Just Intonation sounds<br/>that I didn&apos;t want reverbed.  The cello *had* some reverb.</p><p>How subtle!  And it made me a nice stereo wave file of the combined.<br/>It didn&apos;t seem too difficult to get things to &quot;line up&quot; either,<br/>although that might take a little practice in certain circumstances.</p><p>I downloaded *both* &quot;Producer&quot; and &quot;Studio&quot; but couldn&apos;t see much<br/>difference between the two except for the price tag... :)</p><p>My guess is that &quot;Producer&quot; has more &quot;plug in&quot; capabilities, etc?</p><p>However, most probably $400 is enough for me to spend, and I can<br/>get &quot;Studio&quot; to do what I need it to do.</p><p>Well, this is certainly the solution to my &quot;reverb&quot; problems.</p><p>Thanks *so* much for the tip!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
