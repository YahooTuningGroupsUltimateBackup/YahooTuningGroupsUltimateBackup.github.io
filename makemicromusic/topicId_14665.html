My problem &gt; is that once i choose a scale with more than 12 tones per octave i&apos;m &gt; only able to hear 12 of them in the Staff view. For instance, i choose &gt; 15-TET, set the meter to 5/4 in Staff view (so i can easily hear all &gt; 15 pitches, i.e. I should now have five different tones in three &gt; measures, right?)<br/>&gt; &gt; I am able to hear 12 of the 15 tones per octave when i insert flat(b)<br/>&gt; and sharp(#)signs on a standard 12-TET scale (e.g. c-C, for instance.) &gt; I don&apos;t know if Cakewalk&apos;s staff view recognises double flat, or &gt; double sharp signs. Is there a workaround for this? My question is &gt; whether FTS can output from multiple midi synths on different channels &gt; at the same time? For example, can it output my soundcard&apos;s synth on &gt; ch.1 and my hardware synth on ch.2, at the same time?   I&apos;m not familiar with that version of Cakewalk, but I suspect it doesn&apos;t really distinguish between sharps and flats: in MIDI, C# is the same note as Db. If you&apos;ve got a notated octave C-c, it should sound like an approximate 7/4 (a 960-cent interval) if you&apos;re using a 15-note per octave tuning. If that&apos;s the case, you may be better off using the piano roll instead of the staff view. I used an ancient version of Cakewalk Home Studio to write &quot;Mizarian Porcupine Overture&quot; in 15-ET (back in 1999), all using the piano roll (I didn&apos;t even have a practical notation for 15-ET yet by then).</p></div><h3><a id=14692 href="#14692">ðŸ”—</a>seskandari2003 &#x3C;seskandari2003@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2006 11:18:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt;Basically, if you set FTS to use a 15-tet scale, and send it, for<br/>example,<br/>15 different MIDI notes starting at note #60, you should hear 15<br/>different<br/>pitches.

I must &gt; admit i rarely use the piano roll view, except to insert complex &gt; rhythms, how can the piano roll view let me hear the 15 tones per &gt; octave, let alone more than 15 pitches? I guess it might not be immediately obvious that an octave above Middle C in a 15-note scale will actually be notated as E flat (or D sharp) in the higher octave. The thing to keep in mind is that Cakewalk is a MIDI editor; it just sends MIDI notes to an output device (or FTS in this case), and doesn&apos;t know anything about which notes are mapped to which pitches. Since probably 99%+ of users don&apos;t change the tuning, it probably never occurred to anyone to allow users to customize the staff notation.</p><p>What the piano roll gives you is a label for each note. Typically these are set so that MIDI note 60 is labeled as &quot;C4&quot; and so on, but in some versions of Cakewalk you can edit the names of these notes. In the ancient version of Cakewalk Home Studio I used to use, the Settings / Instruments dialog box has a &quot;Define Instruments&quot; button which opens up a new dialog box, which in turn has a &quot;Define Names&quot; button that lets you define your own note names. All you have to do then is define a label for each of the 128 MIDI notes (or fewer if you don&apos;t need to use the entire MIDI range).</p></div><h3><a id=14696 href="#14696">ðŸ”—</a>seskandari2003 &#x3C;seskandari2003@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2006 2:48:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman Miller wrote:</p><p>&gt;Cakewalk...doesn&apos;t know anything about which notes are mapped to<br/>&gt;which pitches.</p><p>So, am I supposed to know this?
