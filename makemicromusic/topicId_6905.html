One advantage of having<br/>computer audio capability is the opportunity to enjoy and share<br/>feedback on such efforts -- and this one, from remarks so far, sounds<br/>like a real classic!</p><p>In the meantime, I might say that a variation on HTT-29 that I call<br/>HTT-24 -- an unofficial variation, I would emphasize -- is a very<br/>attractive tuning to me. As noted, while it&apos;s structurally and<br/>mathematically a temperament, lots of the ratios are either just<br/>(e.g. 7:4, an important one for my style); virtually just to a<br/>tolerance of around 0.05 cents (e.g. 11:9, 13:11), in comparison with<br/>a typical synthesizer resolution of around a cent or more; or<br/>otherwise within about 3.248 cents of just.</p><p>I really want to hear that 15:13 in the improvisation, about 248<br/>cents. Often I tend to hear it as &quot;cool and charmingly different,&quot; but<br/>I can see how it could be notably dissonant if the context leads you<br/>to expect some other kind of third.</p><p>And to think, George, that you were doing this in 1975!</p><p>One of the charms of HTT-29 and a variation like HTT-24 is the<br/>combination of near-just intervals, regular chains of fifths, and some<br/>clever nuances of temperament adding a creative element of<br/>&quot;not-quite-regular&quot; structure.</p><p>Some of the same qualities also apply to a more obvious &quot;temperament&quot;<br/>like 17-WT, a more compact and less accurate system which nevertheless<br/>offers some similar types of isoharmonic sonorities.</p><p>Thus while the structures are obviously different, I would regard<br/>HTT-29 and 17-WT alike as representing an approach which permits more<br/>regular or &quot;quasi-regular&quot; features than a classic JI system<br/>representing three or more primes, while at the same time providing a<br/>greater variety of intervals and sonorities than would occur in an<br/>equal temperament of comparable size.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m much looking forward to hearing that improvisation,<br/>George!</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
