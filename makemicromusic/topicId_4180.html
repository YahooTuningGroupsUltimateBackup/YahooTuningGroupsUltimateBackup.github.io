All free, except for the computer.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well it&apos;s one thing to have a way to hear our microtonal pieces, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; another thing to get instruments in the hands of good musicians so<br/>&gt; that we can hear &apos;musical&apos; performances... Until we get that, we<br/>&gt; still have nothing but MIDI realizations in most cases...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keyboard bands playing softsynths? Could be the answer!</p><p>My piece was not a MIDI &quot;realization&quot;.  It was written<br/>specifically for computer-music instruments that I designed.  There&apos;s no<br/>way musicians could play it.  The timbres I used are rich in their own<br/>quirky ways, or when they&apos;re not, it&apos;s because I wanted them to be crude<br/>at that particular point.  I try to mix and match them rhythmically to<br/>bring out their best aspects, rather than highlighting weaknesses we<br/>wished didn&apos;t exist.  It&apos;s the same thing we do when writing for violin or<br/>timpani, except we&apos;re so used to it that we don&apos;t think about it.</p><p>Which maybe is a larger point : It&apos;s possible to write decent sounding<br/>music for MIDI or other computer-music instruments --- but you have to<br/>compose your music for the  MIDI instruments.   Too often, people write<br/>for &quot;string quartet&quot;, and then  listen to a &quot;MIDI realization&quot; and feel<br/>that&apos;s it&apos;s not the &quot;real thing.&quot;  Well, it&apos;s not.</p><p>But when Bjork (&amp; producer) start a tune with some coarse MIDI sound,<br/>that&apos;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be there.  It&apos;s not &quot;supposed&quot; to be a real clarinet.<br/>They&apos;re writing for the box.  They&apos;re orchestrating for MIDI/samples/etc.</p><p>I have no problem with people who want to write for live performers--I<br/>certainly do myself often---but I think we can write some great music with<br/>the computer tools that are currently available, and, unlike performers,<br/>can usually allow us to write in any tuning system we can imagine,  if we<br/>just give some thought to orchestration for those tools.</p><p>We are all so obssessed with pitch-structure, that when it comes time to<br/>make music, we&apos;ve only done 50% of the work--yet we just throw it into a<br/>MIDI file, and call it done.</p><p>What about the instruments?  What about the people/machines playing them?,<br/>and how are they played?</p><p>In a way, we could learn something from Brian Ferneyhough, annoying though<br/>he may be.  He always starts with the instrument, and works out from<br/>there.  Pitch-structure is secondary.</p><p>C Bailey</p><p>*********************************************************************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/</a><br/>new piece in 19tet and JI:<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/dissert.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/dissert.html</a></p><p>**********************************************************************</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2003 7:36:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4180">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4180</a></p><p>&gt; Which maybe is a larger point : It&apos;s possible to write decent<br/>sounding music for MIDI or other computer-music instruments --- but<br/>you have to compose your music for the  MIDI instruments.

In<br/>fact, I&apos;ve learned to intentionally *avoid* simulations of<br/>traditional instruments when I work that way, after encountering some<br/>criticism from some quarters.  Well, frankly I was not<br/>thinking &quot;clarinet&quot; (let&apos;s say) when I was using a MIDI sound of that<br/>nature, but was just using the sound the box made as *itself* but<br/>people tend to *hear* it as a poor emulation no matter what one<br/>does...</p><p>J.
