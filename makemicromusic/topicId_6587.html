Therefore,<br/>some of you may have already heard it.  Anyway, since it&apos;s been mentioned<br/>recently and there is some talk of 17tET, I will repost the link:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm</a></p><p>Vessels for Moving is second from the bottom of the list.  If you like, feel<br/>free to check out my other stuff there, too.  It&apos;s all open for discussion,<br/>if anyone thinks it would be worth discussing.</p><p>Peace,<br/>-Andrew</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
