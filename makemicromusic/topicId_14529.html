What drives me to do it?</p><p>If the answers which the artist finds do not, in the slightest<br/>measure, include the motives that Hillman imputes to artists, why<br/>then, that artist is a king among men, a mahatma, a great soul.  But<br/>most of us more ordinary mortals do enjoy the praise of others.<br/>This is the reward, of those Hillman lists, most likely to be met<br/>with today.</p><p>However, we do also take great pleasure in giving others pleasure.<br/>I don&apos;t think Hillman mentioned this motive or outcome, which is<br/>mutually beneficial to both artist and enjoyer.  (Unless that&apos;s what<br/>he meant by &quot;personalism&quot;, a term I&apos;m unfamiliar with, but which I<br/>take rather to be a shorthand for &quot;the cult of personality&quot;.)  These<br/>are the two rewards *involving others* which perhaps motivate me<br/>most to make music, to write poems and songs, and to make pictures<br/>and arrange objects in various ways (I can&apos;t say &quot;sculpt&quot;, since I<br/>don&apos;t).</p><p>Then there are the personal rewards.  These include my pleasure at<br/>practising and improving my skill and craft; pleasure in the works<br/>themselves, as it were anew, as if I were experiencing and enjoying<br/>them for the first time, which is perfectly possible because I often<br/>forget which of the several possible paths at each point on the<br/>journey of creation I actually took, rather than contemplated before<br/>discarding in favour of another; and of course, pleasure in the<br/>journey of discovery (*) itself.</p><p>But I rarely if ever think of my creative endeavours as being self-<br/>expression.
