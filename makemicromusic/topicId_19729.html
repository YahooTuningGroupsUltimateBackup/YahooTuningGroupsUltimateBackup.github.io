The problem (or<br/>at least, /a/ problem) appears to be that Yahoo does not declare the<br/>encoding of its web pages correctly. It&apos;s easy to fix though - just<br/>tell your web browser that the page is UTF-8.</p><p>The problem multiplies as soon as someone quotes the mojibake and<br/>re-posts it.
