It has phenomenal quality at the standard setting.</p><p>2. It doesn&apos;t give great compression at the standard setting.</p><p>3. The developers are dangerous maniacs. The encoder overwrites the<br/>wav files without even bothering to ask, an insane thing to do for a<br/>lossy encoder and something which should never be the default for any<br/>encoder.<br/>What is wrong with these people??</p><p>4. It is very badly supported, but the WinAmp plugin does work and of<br/>course in Windows you can associated the mpc extension to WinAmp.</p><p>5. It is, therefore, not yet ready for prime time, but worth keeping<br/>an eye on. If I want to overwrite a wav file for now, I&apos;ll use FLAC,<br/>thank you very much Mr. Loony-Tune programmers.</p></div>
