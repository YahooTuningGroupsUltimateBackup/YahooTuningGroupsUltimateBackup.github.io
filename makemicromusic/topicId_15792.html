First, here&apos;s an improvisation from last spring:</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This was actually based on only 12 notes of what was to become Zest-24<br/>later last year, but shows one side of the tuning: lots of intervals<br/>close to septimal, or generally in the Pythagorean-to-septimal region.<br/>By November, however, I had arrived at a full 24-note set in time to<br/>record this piece in honor of Shaahin&apos;s newborn daughter Baran, whose<br/>name means &quot;rain&quot;:</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This uses some septimal variations on the Persian dastgah-ha or modal<br/>families of Shur and Nava, and shows one new ingredient of the full<br/>24-note tuning: lots of neutral intervals!</p><p>I referred before to some &quot;paracompositional&quot; papers now available:<br/>that is, papers written &quot;around&quot; or &quot;along with&quot; experience in<br/>composing or improvising. Erv Wilson&apos;s writings released and made<br/>available at the Anaphorian Embassy site &lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a>&gt;,<br/>along with related documents there by Kraig Grady and others, have<br/>served as a creative spur.</p><p>Early this month, I discovered a paper by Wilson on various topics<br/>including a method for generating a 17-note just scale by<br/>transposition, and was led to a fascinating subset of Zest-24 relating<br/>to the septimal aspects of my adventure that I mention above. Here are<br/>links to Wilson&apos;s paper and my paracompositional response:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/genus.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/genus.PDF</a>&gt;<br/>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-septendecene.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-septendecene.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, having recorded the _Baran: Gift of Rain_ piece, I was excited<br/>to find another Wilson paper on a &quot;Rast/Bayyati matrix&quot; using Zalzal&apos;s<br/>neutral thirds of 27:22 and 11:9 to generate a just tuning system<br/>which, in its 24-note version, could serve as a kind of theme with<br/>Zest-24 as one tempered variation. Here are links to the Wilson paper<br/>and my curious appreciation of it.</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF</a>&gt;<br/>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-RastBayyati.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-RastBayyati.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Joe Pehrson&apos;s comments on composing in Blackjack -- and I wish I&apos;d<br/>posted in a more timely way to encourage him and promote more dialogue<br/>about his experience and methods, if he&apos;s inclined to discuss this<br/>here -- remind me that composing or improvising is indeed an<br/>adventure. Right now I have the partial satisfaction of having<br/>composed a new piece, and the challenge of performing and recording it<br/>so I can make it available here.</p><p>To conclude this note, I should give more credit where credit is<br/>due. The Zest in Zest-24 stands for Zarlino Extraordinaire Spectrum<br/>Temperament, and indeed Gioseffo Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone (1558),<br/>evidently the first known regular European temperament to be described<br/>with mathematical precision, is the basis. Eight fifths (F-C#/Db) on<br/>each keyboard manual are tuned as in this regular temperament, with<br/>the other four tuned equally wide to make a 12-note circle on each<br/>manual; the two keyboards are about 50.28 cents apart, the enharmonic<br/>diesis of Zarlino&apos;s regular tuning. Here&apos;s a Scala file:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>My paracompositional papers go into more detail: but I did want to be<br/>sure that Zarlino got due credit for his part in all this.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15970 href="#15970">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2007 8:06:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; To conclude this note, I should give more credit where credit is<br/>&gt; due.

Either of these would make for an interesting<br/>&gt;   alternative to 2/7-comma.</p><p>Please let me gently explain that Zest-24 differs from the regular<br/>24-note version of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma which you describe because it<br/>consists of two 12-note _circles_ each with eight of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>meantone fifths (695.810 cents) plus four wide fifths (708.379 cents)<br/>to close a circle. This is thus an _irregular_ 24-note temperament,<br/>rather than the chain of 23 identical fifths of which you write.</p><p>In other words, I had to be &quot;round-about&quot; because this a tuning with<br/>two &quot;roundish&quot; circles -- or ellipses, if you like that figure of<br/>speech.</p><p>By the way, for MMM purposes, people might ask, &quot;What difference does<br/>all this make for practical music with either of the tunings you folks<br/>are discussing?&quot;</p><p>With greetings to Shaahin, let&apos;s consider music in a Persian kind of<br/>style, for example. In a regular 24-note version of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>meantone, we&apos;d have two steps in the general &quot;neutral second&quot; area at<br/>around 141 and 171 cents. The first is close to 13:12, and the second<br/>a bit larger maybe than a typical neutral second -- almost identical<br/>to a 7-EDO step, and sort of in its own territory.</p><p>In Zest-24, we get these sizes and also some others at around 133,<br/>141, 146, 154, 159, 166, and 171 cents. This means we&apos;ll get subtle<br/>variations as we transpose a tetrachord or mode through different<br/>locations. That&apos;s why I call it Zarlino Extraordinaire Spectrum<br/>Tuning -- we get a spectrum with lots of interval sizes. It would be<br/>prudent for me to emphasize that while 2/7-comma is Zarlino&apos;s tuning,<br/>the irregular temperament and use of two circles is mine.</p><p>Maybe this discussion of the mathematics should be moved to another<br/>forum -- but I will include a Scala file so that you and others can<br/>confirm that this is an irregular tuning rather than a regular<br/>meantone. Also, here&apos;s a piece for Shaahin&apos;s daughter Baran that uses<br/>some of the neutral second steps I mention above.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>! zest24.scl<br/>!<br/>Zarlino Extraordinaire Spectrum Temperament (two circles at ~50.28c apart)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 50.27584<br/> 25/24<br/> 120.94826<br/> 191.62069<br/> 241.89653<br/> 287.43104<br/> 337.70688<br/> 383.24139<br/> 433.51722<br/> 504.18965<br/> 554.46549<br/> 574.86208<br/> 625.13792<br/> 695.81035<br/> 746.08619<br/> 779.05173<br/> 829.32757<br/> 887.43104<br/> 937.70688<br/> 995.81035<br/> 1046.08619<br/> 1079.05173<br/> 48/25<br/> 2/1</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15997 href="#15997">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2007 4:58:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Please let me gently explain that Zest-24 differs from the regular<br/>&gt; 24-note version of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma which you describe because it<br/>&gt; consists of two 12-note _circles_ each with eight of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; meantone fifths (695.810 cents) plus four wide fifths (708.379<br/>cents)<br/>&gt; to close a circle.</p><p>Sorry, my mistake; I made a mistake using Scala&apos;s &quot;compare scale&quot;<br/>command which made me think they were identical.</p><p>To make up for it, I&apos;ll mention that I was pointing out to Ozan<br/>recently that 764-edo was one of a number of equal divisions around<br/>704 in size which struck me as more recommendable than 704. 764,<br/>among its other talents, which includes excellent 11- to 17-limit<br/>approximations, does a near-perfect 2/7-comma meantone (443/764.)
