Two 19 tone clavichords have been made. They are fun to play.<br/>But one can change the reeds of a reed organ and with another keyboard you can make your own arrangements of white and black notes.<br/>The octaves become large then. If you split keys though it remains to be seen just how playable they are. At that point if they are just, make a smaller black and white keyboard.</p><p>J.Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz, Andrew H., Mr. Starret etc. --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Guys, have any of you manufactured -- or are aware of -- a 19-tone MIDI<br/>&gt; keyboard?

You won&apos;t have to fiddle with the MIDI<br/>note numbers, which pretty much assume octaves of 12.  One would supply<br/>the basic 12 notes and the other would supply the additional notes.  The<br/>two added accidentals between white notes on the main keyboard can be<br/>assigned to whatever notes are most comfortable to reach on the second<br/>keyboard, and can even be doubled. The problem would be getting the<br/>keyboards close enough together to reach both with either hand.  I hope<br/>that is feasible.  Good luck.</p><p>Howard Cornell</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>[<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of threesixesinarow<br/>Sent: Wednesday, September 12, 2007 8:43 AM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: Looking for Mr. Yasser</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz, Andrew H., Mr. Starret etc. --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Guys, have any of you manufactured -- or are aware of -- a 19-tone<br/>&gt; MIDI keyboard?
