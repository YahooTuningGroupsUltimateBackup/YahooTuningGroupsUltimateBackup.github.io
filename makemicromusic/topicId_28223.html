I like this tuning and what you did with it!</p><p>Thanks, Chris. I think I like the tuning more in theory than I do in<br/>practice -- it was hard as heck to make anything sound good with it, and<br/>though I like parts of the result I still feel like I could do better. On<br/>the other hand, I have difficulty making anything work with BP and other odd<br/>scales, so maybe I just need to keep noodling along. :) Regardless,  it was<br/>an experiment worth doing.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jake</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
