I was<br/>naturally, upset about this, and noticed that when I pushed the MIDI<br/>plug more securely in, it worked!</p><p>HOWEVER, I noticed there were *still* some events not coming out<br/>right.  Short MIDI notes occasionally did not speak, and I got some<br/>*cyphers* where the MIDI OFF data was obviously not received.  I had<br/>to shut the synth off in those cases!</p><p>I suspect it *still* has something to do with the cable, rather than<br/>with the MIDISPORT box, since there was the more *severe* problem<br/>initially.</p><p>I looked at these MIDI cables, and I noticed that the PINS have a<br/>*smaller diameter* than the MIDI cables that I had around.  They<br/>*look* really cheap and these pins are thin.  This makes me think<br/>that maybe these cables don&apos;t sit so securely in the plug and this is<br/>part of the problem.</p><p>I replaced these *new* cables with some older ones I had around with<br/>the larger diameter pins, so, hopefully everything will be OK now,<br/>although I haven&apos;t had time to test it yet.</p><p>Anybody else have any experiences with these &quot;thin pin&quot; MIDI cables,<br/>or similar experiences with not getting data through &quot;cheap&quot; cables??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=3331 href="#3331">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>6/7/2002 7:53:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;adqeu8+nt8s@...&gt;<br/>jpehrson2 wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anybody else have any experiences with these &quot;thin pin&quot; MIDI cables,<br/>&gt; or similar experiences with not getting data through &quot;cheap&quot; cables??</p><p>I have had trouble with MIDI cables.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because they<br/>were cheap or old.  It does make sense not to buy the cheapest, but don&apos;t<br/>overdo it and get the most expensive ones either.  Where digital<br/>communication&apos;s involved, you can&apos;t improve on perfection!  There should<br/>be no difference between &quot;home&quot; and &quot;studio&quot; use.  Either they work<br/>perfectly or they don&apos;t.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
