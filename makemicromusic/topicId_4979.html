The 1st section of my performance Live @ Felix Kulpa Gallery (<a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/06_06_03_Catharsis_Live@Felix_Kulpa_Gallery/">http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/06_06_03_Catharsis_Live@Felix_Kulpa_Gallery/</a>) was selected for the The Electric Rainbow Coalition concert at Dartmouth (<a href="http://music.dartmouth.edu/rainbow/">http://music.dartmouth.edu/rainbow/</a>)  Anyone else submit a work to this event? I can&apos;t attend, but I am trying to get DVD-Video together; 16/44.1 audio along with a video of my performance. I don&apos;t have a multi-colored mohawk anymore though, so I am afraid it will not be as exciting... ;P This might not happen though as I have to find a camera that handles Digital-8; have access to three Mini-DV cameras... doh...</p><p>Scream is coming along... lots of cool stuff... some &quot;temporary&quot; ??? disappointments (Java gripes; especially the Mac JDK! well... It just sucks; boo on Apple)..  I am doing a demo of some of my multichannel modules to JKSound (<a href="http://www.jksound.com">www.jksound.com</a>) next week..  If they dig it I&apos;ll be heading out to Burning Man with their crew to provide spatialization software for a massive 8 channel (huge tower/per channel) array they are setting up.. Should be wild.. ::crossing fingers here::</p><p>Just finished engineering my first hard techno record... Should have that back in a couple of weeks.. I&apos;ll post the tracks soon, but inquire with me as I probably won&apos;t post here about it... One of my tracks is very quirky and microtonal based. Neato... Production/engineering is stunning if I may say so myself... ;)</p><p>My next big series of performances I&apos;ll be at is Defcon 11 in Las Vegas (<a href="http://www.defcon.org">www.defcon.org</a>); I&apos;m headlining their event/party and also performing at a couple other events that weekend. Woot... My first out of state booking. Heck at this rate it won&apos;t take me long to have more out of state bookings than local ones (SF Bay Area)...</p><p>heh heh...

The 1st section of my performance Live @ Felix Kulpa Gallery</p><p>Hey, man, I&apos;ve tried to dl stuff before but your work is usually very large (and, I hasten to add, it *should* be), so I can&apos;t get it all downloaded. Don&apos;t you ever do limited-pressing CD-Rs or, later on, a DVD? I&apos;d really like to follow your progress!</p><p>&gt;Scream is coming along... lots of cool stuff... some &quot;temporary&quot; ??? &gt;disappointments (Java gripes; especially the Mac JDK! well...

It has been grown here in San Diego at the UCSD Center for Music and Technology by Peter Otto. It can do *amazing* things sonically, and apparently is getting around in usage. Boy, but it would be great to see an installation at BMan. Don&apos;t forget the sunblock (or mud)... :)</p><p>&gt;One of my tracks is very quirky and microtonal based.
