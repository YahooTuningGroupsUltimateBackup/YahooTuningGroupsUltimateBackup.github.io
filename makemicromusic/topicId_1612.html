If you want to upload files, take a look at the music page:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/members.html">http://www.microtonal.org/members.html</a></p><p>and you&apos;ll see how to prompt me for an email of instructions.</p><p>Just a bit more verbiage: I have (at this point) *not* included email addresses for members - I want *you* to be the judge of your privacy, and if someone sees that site and wants to join this forum, then they can easily contact you. I am also currently sending info on file uploading to you individually on an &quot;as need&quot; basis (once you have the instructions, you can just refer to them in the future); I don&apos;t want to publicly post info on how to ftp to the site (!), and this way we can keep the file sharing &apos;in the family&apos;. Just as here at Yahoo!, there is just under 20mb of space, so I&apos;ll keep tabs on how much is up there, and contacting me first (since I have to code the descriptions and make the links) will also help me keep track of disk usage.</p><p>OK?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div>
