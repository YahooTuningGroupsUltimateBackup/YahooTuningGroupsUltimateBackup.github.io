Both<br/>continue the current 3 and 7 based JI harmony obsession that Gene Ward<br/>Smith&apos;s &apos;designer scales&apos; have spawned.</p><p>It is a pay service--$0.99 per hi-fi ogg file. To try any file out before you<br/>purchase, you need to download their free software: I think it allows you<br/>audtion something 3 times. If you like something, you purchase your own copy<br/>of the ogg or flac files. Flac files I think are $1.98 or something. Then you<br/>can purchase an entire album for $6.99 in ogg, or $8.99 in flac.</p><p>I think it&apos;s an excellent business model, with the right files types being<br/>supported, so I signed on right away.</p><p>If anyone wants a flac file of either track, let me know; this early in the<br/>game, and without the completed album, I&apos;m just putting the .ogg files up<br/>while we assemble the album.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2005 4:21:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Friends,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Divide by Pi has two new tracks up at <a href="http://mindawn.com">mindawn.com</a>; more to follow.</p><p>There are three tracks now.

Either way I think<br/>I&apos;ll wait till its finished before checking these out, since I&apos;m<br/>a &quot;total package&quot; kinda guy.
