It&apos;s intended to demonstrate<br/>how different &quot;colors&quot; or &quot;moods&quot; might arise out of transposition in an<br/>unequal tuning.</p><p>Point your browser here and download the MP3 file:</p><p><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/temp/Morsel3-in-A-D-F-C-A.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/temp/Morsel3-in-A-D-F-C-A.mp3</a></p><p>This treats the same little piece of music in several &quot;keys&quot;.</p><p>The piece was composed with a tonic of &quot;A&quot;, and is played that way in the<br/>first rendition. The same piece is then played three more times, in 3<br/>different &quot;keys&quot;. Each key is in the same tuning *system* but based on a<br/>different tonic, without transposing the *notes* themselves. This keeps the<br/>music near the same actual frequencies, modulo the notes that are<br/>differently tuned in that &quot;key&quot;. The first 2 renditions are fairly similar.<br/>The third rendition, in &quot;F&quot;, however is radically different, as is the<br/>fourth in &quot;C&quot;. We finish up with the piece played again on the tonic of<br/>&quot;A&quot;, as composed.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
