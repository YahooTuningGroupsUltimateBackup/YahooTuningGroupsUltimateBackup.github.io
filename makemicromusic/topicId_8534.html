(hint, hint)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyway, I put another one up, this one is my biggest project to date,<br/>&gt;with strings, keyboards, voices, and computer.  It&apos;s called<br/>&gt;&quot;Beresheit.&quot;  The scale is made up of the first 24 unique overtones.<br/>&gt;(I picked 24 to get semi-octave equivalence on the keyboard)  I know<br/>&gt;there are lots of other exciting discussions going on, but I&apos;d<br/>&gt;appreciate some feedback!</p><p>Where?  Giving a link every time helps your readers.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
