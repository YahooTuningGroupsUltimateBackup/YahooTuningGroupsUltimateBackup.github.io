The commentary is a bit more personal and dire. The cymbals were hit as well as bowed with manipulation - such as three instances of lexicon reverb. I also used some stock samples.</p><p>If you go to <a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public">clones.soonlabel.com/public</a> and look in the metallic-stuff-samples folder for cymbals2 folder to get at a few of the processed and raw wavs I used.</p><p>A bit more pure on <a href="http://www.chrisvaisvil.com">www.chrisvaisvil.com</a> is the immediately preceding piece in a pure harmonic series with one instance of z3ta+2.1 - its very thick despite the plain jane production. Called The Core of Io.</p><p>Chris<br/>*</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Caleb Morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt;<br/>Sender: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Sat, 18 Aug 2012 10:24:40<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] And the Gods Were Against Us</p><p>Nice rich mysterious texture, and not unpleasant to listen to for He Whose Nerves Are Shot -- though barking dogs are borderline painful for this badger.<br/>The cymbals stubbornly remained cymbals, not quite transforming into something magically different in context.</p><p>A quest to take the kids to an open toy store -- ending in defeat?</p><p>--- On Sat, 8/18/12, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [MMM] And the Gods Were Against Us<br/>To: &quot;MMM&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Saturday, August 18, 2012, 10:55 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      hamonic series, unpitched inharmonic and found sound ambient piece</p><p><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=2583">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=2583</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
