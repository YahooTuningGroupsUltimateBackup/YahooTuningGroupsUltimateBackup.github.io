In some contexts, 25:18 and 36:25 are the simplest tritones, but a continuous fraction won&apos;t give them as an approximation to 600 cents.  Neither will walking the Stern-Brocot tree (I think this converges more slowly than a continued fraction, but all values of the continued fraction are there).  Which may be why Gene said on [tuning] that he goes straight to Farey sequences and removes intervals outside the prime limit.</p><p>                             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=4805 href="#4805">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2003 3:12:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Which<br/>&gt; may be why Gene said on [tuning] that he goes straight to Farey<br/>&gt; sequences and removes intervals outside the prime limit.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of any better algorithm, but this might be a fruitful<br/>area to research.
