My preference is to start a new group and migrate rather than a regime change :) but I&apos;ll give it a little more thought.</p><p>One thing I notice is that even though we say there are over 200 members (and that isn&apos;t too far off, because it looks like only about 20 members are seriously bouncing), only about a dozen have even spoken up at this point. The others? Asleep, tres occasional lurkers, or something else.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen. I still think there advantages and<br/>&gt;disadvantages for moving. I do like the idea of moving to google for the &gt;archiving ability. Can at least a few people try out the new group to see &gt;what we like/dislike?</p><p>I think that is a great idea. I took a look and it looks like it would work well. I like the ability to view in a couple ways.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2004 10:29:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.
