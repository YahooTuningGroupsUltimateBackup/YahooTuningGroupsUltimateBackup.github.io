The main exception is a friend of mine who makes and plays renaissance and baroque style lutes and guitars. He usually performs in pythagorean intonation, quarter comma meantone or sixth comma meantone. It was him that reminded me of pythagorean intonation and introduced me to quarter and sixth comma.</p></div>
