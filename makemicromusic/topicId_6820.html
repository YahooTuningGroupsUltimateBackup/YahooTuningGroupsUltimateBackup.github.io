For example, major thirds, relatively concordant but<br/>unstable in this kind of style, range from a rounded 408 cents in<br/>Pythagorean JI to 412 cents in 99-tET and 414 cents in HTT-29.</p><p>As it happens, 99-tET and HTT-29 also have available major thirds at<br/>or near 5:4 (~386.31 cents), as does Pythagorean if carried to enough<br/>notes, for example a 53-note circulating tuning almost identical to<br/>53-tET. If such thirds were used as the norm in a piece in any of<br/>these tunings, I suspect that the mood might be quite different than<br/>in my piece.</p><p>There would, as with my piece, be small differences between the<br/>tunings: pure 5:4 thirds in HTT-29; slightly narrow approximations of<br/>this ratio in Pythagorean (~384 cents), and slightly wide<br/>approximations in 99-tET (~388 cents).</p><p>Yet the contrast between a 384-388 cent range and a 408-414 cent range<br/>might affect the &quot;mood&quot; more than the small distinctions within each<br/>range.</p><p>Now for some comments which reflect this agenda and also suggest<br/>another kind of example which, as mentioned above, I hope to post<br/>soon.</p><p>Jacob:</p><p>&gt; For the life of me I can&apos;t tell the difference between these three.<br/>&gt; Anyone else?</p><p>Christopher:</p><p>&gt; I also plead lack of any ear-ability whatsoever . . . . . .  I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; only tried it on Quick time, maybe my synth at home would do more?<br/>&gt; :(</p><p>Aaron:</p><p>&gt; Yes, whatever difference is extremely subtle to me. I thought I<br/>&gt; might guess at the &apos;b&apos; example being a bit more towards just, but<br/>&gt; on relistening, I&apos;m not so sure......</p><p>&gt; Margo, can you enlighten us ?</p><p>Please let me confirm, as discussed above, that &apos;b&apos; is indeed<br/>Pythagorean JI. Your remarks, like those of Jacob and Cristopher,<br/>might support the view that fifths tempered by up to at least around<br/>1.62 cents, as in HTT-29, can sound &quot;not so obviously different from<br/>just.&quot;</p><p>As you propose, my agenda was indeed an &quot;example of the blurryness<br/>sometimes between JI and the appropriate ET/temperament.&quot; Here 99-tET<br/>represents the ET side of the question, while HTT-29 in this<br/>seven-note diatonic context where only a single chain of fifths is<br/>used can represent a regular temperament other than an equal division<br/>of a 2:1 octave.</p><p>Prent:</p><p>&gt; I listened to the a-b-c MIDI comparison files referred to in your<br/>&gt; post. I find them all equally valid and interesting, but that&apos;s only<br/>&gt; after listening to them for 3-4 times. Someone with access to the<br/>&gt; tuning information with an opportunity to explore the tunings in<br/>&gt; more depth would make a more complete response to the differences.<br/>&gt; They are just too subtle for my ears to assess a mood or feeling.</p><p>Thank you for this response which not only fits what others have said,<br/>but leads to your very interesting proposal that I would like to try<br/>here soon.</p><p>&gt; I would like to understand the differences though. To do that, I<br/>&gt; would recommend a single piece that highlights the differences. In<br/>&gt; other words, create a piece that makes the differences into<br/>&gt; musically interesting material. Make it more obvious to the casual<br/>&gt; listener that there is something going on here.</p><p>Actually, this gives me an idea for a piece that highlights the<br/>difference between two tuning systems with often similar interval<br/>sizes, but in different arrangements, so that applying them to the<br/>same piece might result in some notable contrast.</p><p>&gt; If one of the thirds, fifths, seconds is lower/higher than the other,<br/>&gt; make a piece that showcases the difference between them, so even a<br/>&gt; classically trained ear could hear it.</p><p>&gt; Just an idea.</p><p>With the three tunings in these examples, one way to carry out this<br/>idea might be to use what I might describe as augmented or diminished<br/>intervals with longer chains of fifths, where the sizes vary more than<br/>with regular diatonic intervals -- and I&apos;d like to try this idea also.</p><p>&gt; P.S. if pressed, I prefer C, since it seems more complex during the<br/>&gt; first 3-4 seconds. Less stark to my untrained ears.</p><p>Please let me respond to your composerly words: &quot;Would that my ears<br/>were similarly &grave;untrained.&apos;&quot; By the way, I&apos;m very interested in trying<br/>CSound for Linux, and look to your music as one outstanding source in<br/>this process.</p><p>George might score this remark about a &quot;more complex&quot; quality as<br/>support for his approach in a tuning such as HTT-29: often temper<br/>intervals just a bit to make them &quot;less stark&quot; -- or subtly less<br/>simple, at any rate.</p><p>Carl (quoting Aaron&apos;s remark about &grave;b&apos; as sounding nearer to just):</p><p>&gt; I had the same thing happen to me. I rerelistened just now, and<br/>&gt; A and C sound exactly the same, but B smoother.</p><p>Indeed for regular diatonic intervals like those used in my piece,<br/>99-tET and HTT-29 are very similar. For example, major thirds are<br/>around 412.12 cents and 414.13 cents respectively; and minor seconds<br/>around 84.85 and 82.11 cents.</p><p>Gene:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d propose a side-by-side of JI with atomic, but unfortunately this<br/>&gt; would require me to sharpen fifths and major thirds by 1/96 of an<br/>&gt; atom, which is approximately 1/38 of a mu.

This tuning<br/>gives near-just 15-limit otonalities on each tone in a chain of<br/>fifths from Bb to A.  Some of the 15-limit consonances are exact<br/>(5/4, 7/4, 7/5, and 13/9), and 11/9 and 13/11 are so close (~0.05c)<br/>that you&apos;ll never be able to hear that they&apos;re not exact.</p><p>I hesitate to call a this a temperament, because it has *very* low<br/>error at the 7-limit, which makes it extremely difficult to tell that<br/>it is, strictly speaking, a temperament.  To approximate the 15-limit<br/>consonances in its 6 best keys with an ET more accurately, you have<br/>to go over 100 tones (to 130-ET).  If you want to try it in Scala,<br/>then I strongly recommend reading the top part of the message for<br/>advice on how to set the notation for this tuning.</p><p>Better yet, maybe I should make available an mp3 file of a recording<br/>of a live performance I gave in San Diego in 1975, an improvisation<br/>on the Scalatron in 29-HTT.  Then you can all judge for yourselves<br/>whether it sounds like JI or a temperament.  (I should add that it<br/>wasn&apos;t hard to come up with Scaltron timbres that are highly<br/>effective in revealing the subtle differences between tunings.)</p><p>&gt; One point I wanted to make with these examples is that &quot;mood&quot; might<br/>&gt; reflect the style of a given piece at least as much as fine points<br/>&gt; about the structure of a given tuning system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, for example, I composed in more or less of a 13th-century<br/>&gt; European kind of style using diatonic Pythagorean or near-<br/>Pythagorean<br/>&gt; intervals. For example, major thirds, relatively concordant but<br/>&gt; unstable in this kind of style, range from a rounded 408 cents in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean JI to 412 cents in 99-tET and 414 cents in HTT-29.</p><p>In 29-HTT the thirds and sixths come much closer to simple ratios<br/>than in the other tunings.  The major thirds are ~14/11 and the minor<br/>thirds are ~13/11.  The net result is that, paradoxically, these<br/>intervals are close to points of local maximum harmonic *dissonance*,<br/>which (in conjunction with their excellent melodic effect) makes them<br/>very suitable for Margo&apos;s neo-medieval style of composition.  This is<br/>not what I had in mind when I devised this tuning, but I&apos;m delighted<br/>that it has worked so well for her and am grateful that I have been<br/>able to learn a thing or two about the relationships between melody<br/>and harmony from her music.</p><p>&gt; Prent:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I listened to the a-b-c MIDI comparison files referred to in your<br/>&gt; &gt; post. I find them all equally valid and interesting, but that&apos;s<br/>only<br/>&gt; &gt; after listening to them for 3-4 times. Someone with access to the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning information with an opportunity to explore the tunings in<br/>&gt; &gt; more depth would make a more complete response to the differences.<br/>&gt; &gt; They are just too subtle for my ears to assess a mood or feeling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for this response which not only fits what others have<br/>said,<br/>&gt; but leads to your very interesting proposal that I would like to try<br/>&gt; here soon.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; P.S. if pressed, I prefer C, since it seems more complex during<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; first 3-4 seconds. Less stark to my untrained ears.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; George might score this remark about a &quot;more complex&quot; quality as<br/>&gt; support for his approach in a tuning such as HTT-29: often temper<br/>&gt; intervals just a bit to make them &quot;less stark&quot; -- or subtly less<br/>&gt; simple, at any rate.</p><p>Yes, and it seems to me that I said something very recently about<br/>departing very slightly from exact mathematical relationships for<br/>artistic effect:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_6784.html#6833">/makemicromusic/topicId_6784.html#6833</a></p><p>BTW, hi Prent!  It&apos;s been quite a few years since we&apos;ve seen each<br/>other.  Good to see and hear that you&apos;re composing some very nice<br/>things.  Keep on!</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; By the way, as to 99-tET or HTT-29, I now realize that while my<br/>&gt; harpsichord timbre was intended to be &quot;bright&quot; (which can often<br/>&gt; highlight certain distinctions), a more sustained timbre might<br/>better<br/>&gt; bring out small nuances in the tempering of fifths, for example.</p><p>The problem with making tuning comparisons using sustained timbres on<br/>synths is that the tone is almost always modulated in some way<br/>(vibrato, chorus effects, phase shifting, etc.).  While this makes 12-<br/>ET more tolerable by covering up the rapid beating of the 3rds and<br/>6ths, it also makes it difficult to hear subtle differences between<br/>tunings.  I suggest trying the &quot;overdriven guitar&quot; patch on your<br/>synth to get relatively straight tones that are still rich in<br/>harmonics, yet more sustained.  I&apos;ve already prepared some midi files<br/>using this patch that clearly reveal subtle differences in a lot of<br/>different tunings (JI, ETs, and middle-path), which I hope to make<br/>available soon for all to hear.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=6848 href="#6848">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2004 9:29:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

The most famous example is<br/>meantone temperament, whose various varieties are solutions to the<br/>problem of best tempering out the syntonic comma (81:80) without<br/>regard to any other commas vanishing. Schismic (or schismatic)<br/>temperament is another classic example (q.v. Helmholtz, Groven, and<br/>Sabat-Garibaldi), while recently we have seen the discovery and<br/>rediscovery of quite a few other such schemes, such as Miracle,<br/>Hanson, and the &quot;Pajara&quot; system which forms the underpinning for my<br/>paper on the decatonic scales.</p><p>Like JI and ETs, middle path tunings are &quot;regular&quot; -- a given<br/>consonance is represented the same way no matter where it appears in<br/>the tuning system. It seems to me that if a property such<br/>as &quot;regularity&quot; is possessed by both JI and the ETs, then it ought to<br/>be possessed by any &quot;middle path&quot; between them.</p><p>My XH18 paper is a complete survey of 5- and 7-limit, two-dimensional<br/>(like those mentioned above) &quot;middle path&quot; systems within a certain<br/>boundary on error and complexity. In fact, the title of the paper is<br/>_The Middle Path. Part 1: Fifty Floragrams_.</p><p>It seems that you are now putting forth a different definition<br/>of &quot;middle path&quot;, similar to the &quot;well-temperament&quot; concept, which<br/>refers to closed systems (while mine refers to open systems) and<br/>irregular systems (while mine refers to closed systems). I can<br/>certainly see how a JI periodicity block might be created, then<br/>tempered first near the edges, and finally tempered uniformly<br/>everywhere to yield an ET, such that the middle step would be a well-<br/>temperament. However, I feel this unfairly omits the whole universe<br/>of possibilities where fewer of the periodicity blocks&apos; unison<br/>vectors are tempered out, and which are thus also in the &quot;middle&quot;<br/>between JI and ETs.</p><p>While I certainly respect your thinking process, and the musical<br/>value of well-tempered systems is unquestionable, I wonder if we&apos;re<br/>heading toward a terminological nightmare here.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=6855 href="#6855">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2004 6:04:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Prent and everyone.</p><p>Thank you warmly for converting my PostScript score to a PDF file,<br/>Prent, making the score easily available to many more users of the<br/>Internet.</p><p>Also, having posted these examples, I should note with due humility<br/>that my exercise of having Scala produce MIDI versions of a piece in<br/>three similar tunings doesn&apos;t imply that I could tell these tunings<br/>apart by ear better than those of you who responded.</p><p>The idea of trying to select or compose a piece where there&apos;s a<br/>distinction between the realization in two generally more or less<br/>&quot;similar&quot; tuning systems that _does_ make a substantial musical<br/>difference is engaging because it makes me ask, &quot;What do I consider a<br/>musically significant difference -- or what might I try to see if<br/>people might consider the difference a &grave;significant&apos; one?&quot;</p><p>Well, Prent, I am planning an example now, also an opportunity to get<br/>a piece I have on paper into MIDI format and post it here.</p><p>This discussion could also tie into other questions, like what does it<br/>mean to &quot;compose a piece for a given tuning&quot;?</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6857 href="#6857">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

Some of the 15-limit consonances are exact<br/>&gt; (5/4, 7/4, 7/5, and 13/9), and 11/9 and 13/11 are so close (~0.05c)<br/>&gt; that you&apos;ll never be able to hear that they&apos;re not exact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hesitate to call a this a temperament, because it has *very* low<br/>&gt; error at the 7-limit, which makes it extremely difficult to tell<br/>that<br/>&gt; it is, strictly speaking, a temperament.  To approximate the 15-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; consonances in its 6 best keys with an ET more accurately, you have<br/>&gt; to go over 100 tones (to 130-ET).

I thought you might have been referring to the<br/>pairs of tones a comma apart from 1:29-2:04, but I was pretty sure<br/>that would have been too early.</p><p>The only interval anywhere around the time range you mentioned that I<br/>would call &quot;non-just&quot; is the one at 2:42, where the lower note is a<br/>*wrong note* (drat!!!) -- you&apos;ll hear the intended interval, a 5:6,<br/>two dyads later.  The smallest intentional interval in this passage<br/>is a repeated 13:15 (~289 cents) at 2:46-2:48.  Except for the wrong-<br/>note interval (~240 cents, or a little wider than 7:8), the entire<br/>passage from 2:36-3:00 is nothing more than noodling on a single<br/>harmonic series on F, with the two upper voices two harmonics apart<br/>in the range of 7 to 15, i.e., 7:9, 8:10, 9:11, ... 13:15 above a<br/>drone fifth, 4:6 (F:C).</p><p>Anyway, I agree that the wrong note definitely makes the passage much<br/>more interesting -- the smaller wrong-note interval seems to<br/>anticipate the effect of the 13:15, which doesn&apos;t come across as a<br/>consonance, at least in this context.</p><p>&gt; Where these tuning puns, or were you going for non-just<br/>&gt; to show contrast.</p><p>There was a section (2:21-2:31) where I did intentionally use three<br/>somewhat dissonant triads with 11:14 (~major) and 11:13 (~minor)<br/>thirds (intervals that Margo often uses diatonically) for contrast,<br/>with the last 11:14 expanding into even more dissonant thirds, which<br/>shows that, like JI, this tuning can deliver a high consonance-<br/>dissonance contrast.  (BTW, I hope you haven&apos;t forgotten that I said<br/>that this tuning is actually a *temperament* that I claimed would<br/>sound like JI.  From your last comment I have gotten the impression<br/>that I succeeded.)</p><p>&gt; Neat stuff regardless.</p><p>Thanks for the brief critique.

This also gives very-near-just diatonic (5-limit) scales in 5<br/>&gt; different keys.</p><p>Followed up by</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10549">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/10549</a></p></div>
