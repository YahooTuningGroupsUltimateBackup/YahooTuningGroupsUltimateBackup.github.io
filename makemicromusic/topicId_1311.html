Note that the 7:6 is essentially pure in 9-tET.</p><p>Now tune the keyboards a perfect fifth apart.</p><p>You now have nine of your cherished 12:14:18:21 chords, essentially just! Also, there are nine 100-cent steps -- familiar semitones!</p><p>I&apos;d love to hear some crazy warped neo-Gothic music in this tuning.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p></div>
