I don&apos;t even need/want this to work with external synths, driving the soundcard would be fine. What I am looking for is very simple in concept:</p><p>1. Start with some default tuning; for ease, this could be 12tet<br/>2. Be able to play on a midi kbd input, and hold any note (0-127)<br/>3. Be able to change the pitch of any note in real time, using either graphic spin controls, knobs, widgets or anything else. Any way to alter the numeric value of the pitch would be OK, bonus points to have a &quot;midi learn function&quot; to allow programmable knobs/sliders on external devices<br/>4. Once tunings have been altered, the ability to save the tuning.</p><p>I&apos;ve gotten into this because of the amazing array of soft instruments out there, and it seems like there are so many people able to program these plug-in synths, and most of them have &apos;learn&apos; functions. To have something like this, to try creating tunings *without* generating numbers -&gt; sending midi data -&gt; playing something to hear it... That is what I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>Not saying *you* should try to do it, as Scala does so much else. Just wondering if anything is out there that *might* allow live polyphonic tuning experimentation.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5665 href="#5665">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2004 3:28:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>That makes it clearer, and it&apos;s indeed not possible in Scala.<br/>But if I can think of some way to implement it with little<br/>work then I&apos;ll do it.<br/>The midi relaying doesn&apos;t replay sounding notes when the scale<br/>changes, but it can be done.
