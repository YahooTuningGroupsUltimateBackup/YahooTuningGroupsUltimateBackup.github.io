For what it&apos;s worth I don&apos;t remember anyone ever dissing your scales like this, but I could be wrong.&quot;</p><p>   I remember one example where I made a scale using only 16th harmonic notes (harmonics 16-32) and a whole bunch of people claimed I was simply copying the harmonic series.  Same goes when I made a 9-tone PHI scale and someone said it was a subset of the infinite scale PHI^x/2^y.  An I&apos;ve seen John&apos;s music posted and then his formula fished out a compared to &quot;a bad/wrong version of Tenney Height&quot;.  In general, it&apos;s a problem with people forcing things to be pigeon-holed to the nearest known theory...rather than taken as their own (if unknowingly strongly influenced) ideas.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Can we start over? &quot;</p><p>  Of course.  My point isn&apos;t to hold a grudge with you or anyone else...but to express new ideas in peace and promote an environment where others are also free to do so.</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;Carl has flamed out at me countless times for &quot;false advertising&quot; when<br/>I said my &quot;scales take critical band dissonance into account (not to mention odd-limits), several people denied I make music despite my posting well over 10 total songs to this list...</p><p>Carl (in response)&gt;&quot;When you first joined we had a positive interaction.  I wanted to give you better terminology to describe your scales.  That backfired because you happily used it without understanding it, to the point of pseudoscience,&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did understand it just...not to your standards.&nbsp; For example, I know what odd-limit vs. prime-limit is but not countless historical interpretations, o-tonal vs. u-tonal but not everything about Harry Partch, implications of Harmonic Entropy and Tenney Height but not all the involved equations...<br/>    Plus...I know at least an acceptable definition (though there are different ones for different circumstances) for periodicity (IE one I double-checked with a physicist), I have long known what critical band dissonance is (even if I didn&apos;t use your preferred &quot;roughness&quot; term for it), etc.&nbsp; I&apos;m no expert, but I know a fair deal, enough not to make it productive for me to bury my head in the sand about it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I did get blatantly wrong in the past, as I recall, was what &quot;equal beating&quot; meant as I thought beating took place based on an exponential/logarithmic scale more over an arithmetic scale.&nbsp; IE my PHI scales at that time were the logarithmic equivalent of  equal beating.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This misunderstanding was much due to looking at Jacques Dudon&apos;s scale formulas and seeing they were exponential...plus the fact critical band dissonance only changes it&apos;s curve mildy between octaves (IE seems more on a logarithmic scale).&nbsp; I misused the term &quot;equal beating&quot; as being logarithmic and it took looking at a few of Mike B&apos;s posts to look at things like &quot;Drats&quot; the right way.&nbsp; You may well have also posted something about arithmetic vs. logarithmic...but, as I were call, you were so busy making posts about how I was deliberately false-advertising that I had a tough time finding any wheat in all the chaff.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Yes, that&apos;s how I remember it too- you never made such claims.  I&apos;ve been mad at you for making emotional replies to things I and others have written, seemingly before having careful read them.&quot;</p><p>  I had honestly carefully read a lot of the responses...and admittedly usually understood maybe 80% of what was said the first time around.  But that apparently didn&apos;t stop people from saying &quot;you must have never read it at all&quot; because I missed 20%.  The most obvious example of this would be the winding argument about how Noble Mediants were the same as my PHI scale...and it actually took Margo, one of the writers of the paper, to convince people what I was doing was NOT the same thing.  The sound samples and how different they sounded from other Noble Mediant examples apparently weren&apos;t enough, and even my own descriptions of my own theory weren&apos;t taken as honest.  No kidding I got emotional in such situations...people were coming at me as &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;...can you blame me?</p><p>&gt;&quot;To be fair to me you did show up here already using terminology you read in Sethares in a pseudoscientific or exaggerated manner.&quot;</p><p>   Honestly, I had read Sethares for months before joining the list, plus relay e-mailed to him.  And no, I did not get 100% of his theory right, but I did know a good proportion of it.  What I do remember getting &quot;wrong&quot; was applying his theory as-applies-to-sine-waves while most people, apparently, consider it as applying to full harmonic-series-containing instruments.</p><p>&gt;&quot;That was your first post, about your consonance maximizer program.&quot;<br/>  Which did and still does work.  It breaks all partials in the sound file into an array via FFT and then aligns them to the nearest harmonics in a scale (where the scale is repeated on octaves starting at around 40hz and going up to about 20500hz).  Furthermore, it aligns everything to a scale where all harmonics are about 12/11 or more apart...rather than the usual 17/16-ish apart of the 12TET semitones (which is close to maximum critical band dissonance) and puts every other partial going up in frequency on opposite stereo channels so the partials are twice as far apart in each ear.</p><p>    I showed a sample of this program on this list or the tuning list and Mike B thought it was an awesome DSP effect.  Other people may think otherwise but it does what it was designed to do: align timbre and tuning and then push notes further away from each other to avoid the critical band.  Look through my audio/example files...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Music theory will never be as impressive as physics, but it is a serious field nonetheless and you shouldn&apos;t expect to use the apparatus if you don&apos;t demonstrate competence.  It&apos;s really that simple.&quot;</p><p>   I think you are confusing my effort as an effort toward trying to achieve some sort of &quot;new psycho-acoustics&quot;, rather than what I&apos;m really aiming for which is making microtonal music more listenable for most people.  I&apos;m not trying to do a scientific survey on subjects any more than my brother (jazz guitarist&apos;s) band is every time they check for crowd response at a concert.  Admittedly though, I occasionally feel forced to use &quot;psycho-acoustic lingo&quot; to get across that I&apos;m looking for a common ground between most listeners...whereas on forums like this using terms like &quot;more relaxed sounding&quot; or &quot;more tense sounding&quot; or &quot;having more tonal color&quot; just don&apos;t cut it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I honestly think you should consider if the things that upset you so much actually exist.  Why get upset about something unless you have to?  I don&apos;t mean this to attack or disparage you.  I sincerely want to help.&quot;</p><p>   The flames people threw around when I committed &quot;grand theft&quot; by using the term &quot;song&quot; for a non-vocal piece, for example, certainly did exist.  I actually appreciate it when people correct me...so long as they don&apos;t do it with some nasty side comment along the lines of &quot;read x paper first, you ignorant moron&quot; or say &quot;you&apos;re wrong&quot; without providing &quot;right&quot; alternatives until far later.</p><p>  If I could get to the point I saw people saying, to me and others &quot;I like/dislike the sound of x sound example or scale you made&quot; and asked the composer why he did it said way (the scale or the composition) and only then moved on to comparisons/criticism vs. other &quot;theories&quot; and did so with the idea of presenting alternatives rather than a &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; attitude...I&apos;d feel I was in much safer waters.<br/>  Heck, I&apos;m pretty sure just about everyone here would...I get a strong sense a huge majority of people here are very intelligent and are trying to help this art grow, even the &quot;cranks&quot;. :-)  Hey, if they wanted money or fame...let&apos;s face it: microtonal music is probably about the least popular and least rock-star-ish alternative. :-P</p></div><h3><a id=26396 href="#26396">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2011 12:48:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael, I honestly wish you the best.
