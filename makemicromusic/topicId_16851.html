Your points about interval ambiguity and melodic integrity especially help to explain how a clearer mental image can be formed than in meantone which is inherently ambigious. And it is good to know I can safely work in JI without fearing to tire my ears :)</p><p>I find extended pythagorean works very well for me as shorthand for JI and also in practice it sounds the same. I use a \ to denote &quot;flat by a pyth comma&quot; and / to denote &quot;sharp by a pyth comma&quot;. I imagine Gene has similar advantages in his EDO of choice (what EDO is that?) too, especially if he is modulating a lot.

Even limiting myself to &quot;only&quot; 12 pitches per octave (to stay sane behind the keyboard) the possibilities are fascinating! 95% of what I need can be covered by 12 notes. I don&apos;t see why JI should be that impractical these days. Even if a performer can&apos;t reproduce it perfectly JI provides a great framework to think in. And hopefully with that ambiguity gone the performers will learn quickly to intonate it correctly.</p></div><h3><a id=16874 href="#16874">ðŸ”—</a>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2007 6:11:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wasn&apos;t aware of garibaldi, thanks.
