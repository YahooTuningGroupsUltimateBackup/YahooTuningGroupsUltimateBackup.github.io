Before my laptop (Windows XP) got scrubbed during repair I somehow managed to save scala files as  .mid or .syx files and fool FM7 into accepting them.

I can&apos;t make sense of the documentation so practical hands on advice would be most welcome.

That&apos;s number 107.</p><p>Use the &quot;export synth tuning&quot; command in Scala to save tuning files<br/>which can then be imported as sysex to FM7.</p><p>Kalle</p></div>
