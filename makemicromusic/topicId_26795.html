I hope I didn&apos;t appear to be too hard on<br/>Michael, and I&apos;m sorry if I was, Michael.</p><p>Ironic for me, this conversation as a whole. I had a college theory<br/>professor (who shall remain nameless), a monster musician, totally disown me<br/>a few months ago for what he perceived to be my less than pure taste in good<br/>music. My crime? Liking certain things that were beyond the pale to him---I<br/>wanted him to admit that certain rock music was high quality, that someone<br/>like Aphex Twin had a genius for sound in a way that he possibly would be<br/>unable to even grant or recognize....and that there were other great<br/>composers in the classical canon than the 3 B&apos;s that mattered (like Federico<br/>Mompou). To him, it was Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, Haydn, etc., etc.<br/>and 2nd tier things like Saint-Saens, Faure, Debussy, Vierne....a very<br/>arch-conservative classical diet. Getting him to admit that Stravinsky was<br/>an unparalled genius was hard enough. Then of course, I barely broached the<br/>subject of microtonality---I knew to him, it was all &quot;pure garbage&quot; that was<br/>a waste of my, or anyone&apos;s time.</p><p>And here I am, making an appeal to folks who don&apos;t know Bach to become<br/>familiar with Bach.

BACH! Of all things!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The universe is howling with laughter at me. :D</p><p>That&apos;s pretty funny.</p><p>It&apos;s nice to see the flames die down. For what it&apos;s worth, I played a fair amount of Bach when I was learning classical guitar in my teens, and I learned the Bach chorale style in high school (and I&apos;ve been thinking about how to apply that, or its principles, to microtonal scales), but I haven&apos;t been able to deal Bach very well -- or with baroque music in general -- for a long time.</p><p>I love ealier stuff like Dowland and Palestrina. (I just discovered Palestrina two years ago. And me a good Catholic boy, too. Who knew my life had such a gap?) I love a lot of late Classical music, and I love a lot of Romantic and Modern music. I could place the pillars of my musical psyche (in the classical arena, at least) at Palestrina, Beethoven, and Mahler. But Vivaldi and Handel tire me, and with few exceptions Bach quickly starts grating on my nerves. I could more easily sit through Schoenberg&apos;s Gurrelieder -- not the easiest piece to listen to, even though it&apos;s not in the 12-tone style -- than JS Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion.</p><p>So, I appreciate the fact that Beethoven and the Schumanns and Mendelssohn loved Bach and studied him deeply, but better them than me.</p><p>Another one I&apos;m supposed to love? Mozart. Sorry, just doesn&apos;t reach me much. I&apos;ve tried.</p><p>With respect to people who are like Igs and Michael, I think it&apos;s not worth arguing about their Bachiness or non-Bachiness. You don&apos;t need to study Hesiod to write Star Wars, even if it could, theoretically, help.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div>
