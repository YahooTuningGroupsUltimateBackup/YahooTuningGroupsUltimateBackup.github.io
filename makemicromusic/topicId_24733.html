And if my combinatorics calculations<br/>serve me correctly, gives the root note in a dyad is fixed at C and the other 2<br/>notes at other tones there are nCr = 11 choose 2 = 55 total combinations for<br/>triads starting at C.<br/>    Which would make about 47% of the possible triads in 12TET dissonant and 53%<br/>of them consonant...not far at all from a &quot;perfect&quot; 50/50 consonance/dissonance<br/>distribution far as balanced musical options for both consonance and dissonance!<br/>    That is...unless you&apos;d argue some of the triads I listed are consonant under<br/>12TET...let me know if you think any of the above triads sound consonant.  :-D</p><p>    My point...is that composition-ally 12TET may well be favored not because it<br/>is &quot;uncannily consonant&quot; (which it certainly is not)...but because it promotes a<br/>fairly even distribution between consonant and dissonant options.</p><p>    And that, perhaps, we should be on the lookout for microtonal scales and<br/>tunings that feature similar balance far as compositional options for &quot;tension<br/>and resolve&quot;...rather than use an excuse like &quot;people dislike microtonal<br/>scales...because of their unquenchable thirst for 12TET &apos;hyper-consonance&apos; &quot;.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
