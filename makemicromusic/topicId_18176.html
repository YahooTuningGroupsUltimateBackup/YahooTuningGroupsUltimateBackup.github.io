I doubt these days it&apos;d be worth it if cost is an issue (but I don&apos;t know what the current offering&apos;s like or what you plan to do with it).  Free software and commodity hardware are good enough for standard audio work.  Maybe Kyma&apos;s better at certain tasks.  It&apos;s aimed at professional studios where the cost doesn&apos;t matter as long as it does a better job or saves work time.</p><p>One problem is that it saves all your instruments in a proprietary format.  Now I use Csound and, although I can copy some ideas, I can&apos;t check what I did in Kyma because I don&apos;t have a copy of it installed. Whereas if I move away from Csound I have all the orchestra files showing my intentions and readable in a standard text editor.  I take the long view in that I don&apos;t want to keep relearning everything every few years as the technology moves on.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2007 6:37:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>How to use it for microtonal music, please?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot;<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joe&quot; &lt;tamahome02000@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For windows, osx, &amp; linux, does microtuning over sysex, plays giga,<br/>&gt; &gt; dls, &amp; akai samples.
