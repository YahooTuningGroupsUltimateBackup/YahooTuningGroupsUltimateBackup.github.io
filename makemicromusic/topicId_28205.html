When you enable &quot;identity vector&quot; in the Lattice pop-up menu it adds another dimension to the Lattice to show the identity-vector, so the lines and lattice-points do look a bit strange ... but i have never seen it give an error message, so apparently that is something caused by PD7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I personally never enable the identity-vector on the Lattice unless it&apos;s really an important part of the structure of the tuning. Examples of the latter would be the ancient Greek systems, which are based on tetrachordal similarity.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, it should be noted that we programmed into Tonescape a lot of &quot;hooks&quot; for future features which were never enabled ... one of these is the apparent ability to define any type of identity-vector: in reality Tonescape can currently only use the 2:1 ratio as an identity-vector.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I thank you for your willingness to help others to get Tonescape running on Mac. Most of the people who have queried me about using Tonescape are Mac users, and so all I have been able to tell them until now is that they need to buy a cheap Windows PC!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -monz<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Monz, there is indeed occasion to cheer.

Neat! Got to discover some more of this eye-candy now.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Bear in mind folks, that ToneScape&apos;s development was discontinued due to shortage of funds or whatnot, so one must acquire the exact specified software components to get it to launch and fully run. Whatever it was that prevented it from operating normally (without the 3D lattices) under PD6 seems to have been solved in PD7 (possibly the graphics improvements).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The setup-setdown details that lead me to the final happy solution for ToneScape are too gruesome a &quot;micro-horror nightmare&quot; to describe.

I look forward to it.</p><p>A point about the actual music production: As you know, development of Tonescape stalled at 2006. Our plan was to incorporate Csound as the method of producing studio-quality output, but development of the Csound-based instruments never got very far ... despite a _lot_ of arduous effort on my part!</p><p>Anyway, Tonescape is able to export the .tonescape Musical Piece files as either .mid (MIDI) or .csd (Csound unified format, combining both .orc and .sco). The only .orc part which we can make is a synthesized acoustic guita -- however, the entire Tonescape Musical Piece will be rendered as a regular Csound .sco file incorporated into the corresponding part of the .csd file.</p><p>If the user already has the desired Csound .orc files, those can simply be copied and pasted into the .orc section of the .csd file exported from Tonescape, and then the corresponding data in the .sco section edited to match the desired instruments.</p><p>The good news about this is that one does not need to travel too far along the steep Csound learning curve to learn how to do this! And there are already so many great Csound .orc files available for free on the internet that it is fairly easy to build up a collection of good sounds to use, without having to learn how to create your own Csound .orc files.</p><p>On the other hand, with the availability now of very high-quality sampled sounds that can be used with MIDI, the exported .mid files may also be used to produce high-quality audio output.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear monz, as the soon-to-be advisor to the Rectorate of Ishik (ISIK) University, I would gladly (and within the full extent of my influence) consider having you here in Istanbul for a series of lectures in the foreseeable future. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Spoiler: Such seances could/would be realized under the &quot;Techno-Sound Programme&quot; (with a heavy emphasis on microtonal Audio Production) which we are in the process of establishing under said university.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More possibilities are surely open for valuable guest speakers from the lists.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Assoc.
