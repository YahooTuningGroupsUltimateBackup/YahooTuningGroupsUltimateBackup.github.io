I actually liked this more than Earlight,<br/>but<br/>&gt;that&apos;s just me. I think you really nailed the bass line this time<br/>around - &gt;the sample and phrasing are so much like a &apos;stand-up&apos;<br/>player, I can almost<br/>&gt;see Christian McBride or Dave Holland playing it live (not to mention the<br/>&gt;couple of bars of Jan Hammer on Minimoog near the end :).</p><p>Thanks for that.. its always uplifting to hear praise...<br/>I, too was pretty pleased with the bass. In the first pass,<br/>when the bass is playing alone, it was basically in 12-tet (which was<br/>the default tuning). No adaptation of the pitches occurred because<br/>there was only one note at a time (this piece did not use any<br/>&quot;horizontal&quot; adaptation). So what I did was to play a second line<br/>(that you actually hear later during one of the repeats), do the<br/>adaptation with both lines present, and then delete the second<br/>line. So all the pitch bending is caused by the algorithm retuning<br/>against (an unheard) melody.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyway, I&apos;d be happy for any comments/critiques/thoughts about the<br/>piece...</p><p>&gt;Sure - maybe put the drums a little less hot in the mix, and maybe<br/>just a<br/>&gt;teeny bit drier. Right now it sounds like the band is spread out<br/>around one<br/>&gt;of those big vacant ballrooms in the off-season on the Jersey coast.</p><p>These are easily changed, since the reverberation is &quot;added on&quot; at the<br/>mix-down<br/>stage...</p><p>&gt;The other thing: I know you are inventive enough to frame this more as a<br/>&gt;piece - how about things come to a semi-close at one point, and then a<br/>&gt;contrasting episode comes in, either a different tempo/rhythmic feel,<br/>or a<br/>&gt;more stark tuning/instrumentation? Then up to you whether you rondo<br/>it out,<br/>&gt;in ABA form, or go somewhere else. Even with the changes in the drum kit<br/>&gt;voices, the &apos;death march&apos; of the basic groove undercuts (IMO) the<br/>changes<br/>&gt;going above it.</p><p>I guess youre saying that the rhythm track is too &quot;steady&quot; throughout.<br/>This is interesting. Maybe the simplest &quot;solution&quot; would be to mute<br/>the drums at various points, thus providing more contrast between<br/>sections. The other solution is to compose a &quot;new&quot; B section with which<br/>to alternate... I&apos;ll need to think about this.</p><p>&gt;And what a deliciously greasy clarinet thing you&apos;ve got happening!<br/>This is<br/>&gt;all so good - man would a double CD from you and Prent Rogers be a cool<br/>&gt;thing, with his proto-Mariachi/Norteno bands, and you are nearing<br/>virtual<br/>&gt;klezmer-from-Mars.</p><p>The &quot;clarinet&quot; sound comes from a Yamaha VL70m, though I&apos;m not sure I<br/>play it<br/>much like a clarinet is played...</p><p>&gt;As always, I&apos;m impressed.</p><p>much thanks....</p><p>Later, Joe said:</p><p>&gt;***I second Jon&apos;s comments.  It almost comes off as a series of jazz<br/>&gt;*solos...*  It might be nice to have it more *polyphonic* in parts...<br/>&gt;layering so that there is more contrast and structure.  (I know this<br/>&gt;might &quot;muck up&quot; the sophisticated tuning paradigm, but that can&apos;t be<br/>&gt;always forefront...)</p><p>It&apos;s great to get this kind of hearing... after working on a piece for<br/>several weeks, its nearly impossible to &quot;hear&quot; it as would a new<br/>listener.</p><p>You are making the (rather obvious in retrospect) observation that<br/>Excitalking does not have, strictly speaking,<br/>harmonies... rather, its more like a collection of 2 or 3<br/>melodies that happen to occur simultaneously.<br/>Very helpful, this is...</p></div><h3><a id=5626 href="#5626">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
