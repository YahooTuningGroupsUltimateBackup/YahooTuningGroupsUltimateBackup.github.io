What I gave Jacky was not easy to<br/>work with; he just makes it sound that way! It was a tune I had worked<br/>on for at least a couple of months that was probably more than 90%<br/>done (it was going to be vocal tune--kind of a Henry Cow meets<br/>Lifetime thing). But for whatever reasons, it was never completed and<br/>I lost it and completely forgot about it. Years later this mix turned<br/>up on an unlabeled cassette--at first I didn&apos;t know *who* it even was,<br/>it had been that long and was that much of a surprise!</p><p>Anyway, the difficult thing for Jacky was that I gave him a nearly<br/>complete, dense tune with no hope of separating anything out, this is<br/>a less than gracious way to work--and that&apos;s an understatement! But<br/>Jacky being the consummate pro he is, took at it and didn&apos;t let up<br/>until he had put his stamp on it and hammered it into a shape he was<br/>happy with.</p><p>Jacky is an extremely talented guy, and I&apos;d really love to start a<br/>live microtonal fusion band with him, that would be a serious gas!<br/>Anyway, thanks for listening... community and camaraderie sure can be<br/>a wonderful thing, and that&apos;s coming from a diehard hermit!</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Jonathan Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@...&gt;<br/>To: &quot;MMM&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, May 18, 2002 10:56 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Stearns/Ligon Fusion</p><p>&gt; Boys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, c&apos;mon, this thing is killin&apos; me! I had just a brief moment at<br/>home this<br/>&gt; morning, so that is when I put up the page, downloaded the mp3, and<br/>put it<br/>&gt; on a CD-RW. I&apos;m now at the place where I&apos;m staying, and listening to<br/>it<br/>&gt; with headphones on my laptop.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Seriously dangerous mix to listen on &apos;phones!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. That section that starts at 5:21? How cool is that?! Great use of<br/>space<br/>&gt; and a break in the flow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. It really is a wonderful melding of Dan&apos;s floating,<br/>&gt; stream-of-conscienceness compositional style with drop-dead beats<br/>from Jacky.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll second what Jeff said: Jacky, your talents as a producer are<br/>second to<br/>&gt; few if none. The only place I&apos;d differ is for you to do it<br/>full-time,<br/>&gt; because then you&apos;d end up having to work with musicians of a much<br/>lesser<br/>&gt; calibre than Dan. Music as a &apos;day job&apos; sucks hard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if you found a way to pick and choose your projects, you really<br/>would<br/>&gt; add immensely to anyone&apos;s work lucky enough to have you onboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This little place sure has some great people, and humble bravos to<br/>Dan and<br/>&gt; Jacky. Here&apos;s to more collabs in the future (he said, putting on his<br/>&gt; thinking cap and wondering how we can facilitate in the coming<br/>months...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Happy we are,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
