Nothing, nothing at all, can match playing acoustic instruments for immediate feedback, response to imperative and inspiration-of-the-moment, and the luxury of bathing in soundwaves. I think this is one of the reasons why even simple sound-sources/instruments have a power to move us, and to please us in both listening and playing. When I do outreach concerts for school kids, and take a vanload of percussion, they frequently ask my favorite instrument. And while that is hard to answer, I always tell them the last instrument I would part with are my conga drums.
