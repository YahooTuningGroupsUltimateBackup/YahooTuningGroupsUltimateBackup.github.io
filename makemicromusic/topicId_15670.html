The keyboard layout is essentially the same as on the<br/>Fokker-organ. The keys are closer to one another, making more rapid<br/>playing possible. Transistor oscillators are the tone source. It has<br/>some 40 different timbres, equally divided between the 8- and 4-foot<br/>&quot;stops&quot;.</p><p>The instrument was introduced on 1 november 1970 at Teyler&apos;s Museum.<br/>Anton de Beer had quickly written a demonstration piece with all kinds<br/>of puns with higher harmonics and natural thirds and sevenths. One<br/>scene of Joel Mandelbaum&apos;s opera The Dybbuk was also performed with<br/>the archiphone accompanied by a vocal quartet and violin duo.</p><p>The archiphones are now (1987) at the following locations:<br/>1-2. Haarlem (Huygens-Fokker Foundation);<br/>3. Blackheath, New South Wales, Australia (William Coates);<br/>4. St. Louis, Missouri, USA (Webster College).<br/>Several compositions have been written for the archiphone since 1970,<br/>for example by Adriaan Fokker, Henk Badings, Anton de Beer, and Joel<br/>Mandelbaum. An instruction method was written by Anton de Beer: Guide<br/>for the use of the archiphone (1976). &quot;</p><p>Another pickup from my daily RSS feed from Technorati on the word<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot;.
