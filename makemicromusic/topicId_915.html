Szanto&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hey List!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I just *know* that some of you are experienced with samplers,<br/>&gt; either<br/>&gt; hardware or software based; what I&apos;d like is any big tips on a<br/>&gt; purchase.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m leaning to an actual hardware box for now, as I can put it in my<br/>&gt; mobile<br/>&gt; rack for when I need to cobble sounds for the orchestra or opera<br/>&gt; (tuned<br/>&gt; gongs, large church bells, sound effects) without fussing with the<br/>&gt; laptop.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I&apos;m considering is what *was* near-top of the line, say, two<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; years ago. This way I&apos;ll be fairly current, compatability-wise, and I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have _huge_ demands to make of the box, but won&apos;t have to pay for the<br/>&gt; absolute cutting edge. Also, I&apos;ll probably plan on preparing the<br/>&gt; samples in<br/>&gt; the digital realm on the computer, rather then relying on the sampler<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; too much editing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any suggestions *gratefully* appreciated...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Go for the best you can afford, Akai, Kurzweil or Emu , with the most<br/>RAM you can stuff into it. You&apos;ll get as many opinions on these as there<br/>are individuals but if your need is for faithful renditions of sound<br/>sources (rather than producing cutting edge twisted jungle or techno)<br/>they all deliver the goods as well as each other.The Akai S5000 is an<br/>industry standard with up to 256meg. It retails at about &iuml;&iquest;&half;1K sterling.<br/>The Emu E5000 is the competition at about the same price. The Emu E-6400<br/>Ultra is dearer but very desirable. Or less expensive is the Emu ESI<br/>2000. All have SCSI to interface with your PC. These are real<br/>workhorses, designed to suit working pro musicians who bash them day in<br/>day out.</p><p>Good luck</p></div>
