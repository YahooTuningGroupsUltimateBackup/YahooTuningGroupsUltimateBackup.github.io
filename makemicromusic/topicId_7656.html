I believe that there is a consensus among musicologists that _The Art of the Fugue_ was written for the organ, but that actually supports your point if in a more subtle way, in that the individual organist is responsible for the registration, and that registration will necessarily vary from instrument to instrument (along with absolute pitch height and temperament -- not unlike _Karawitan_).   The more explicitly flexible consort instrumentations in early dance prints (Attaignant, Gervaise, Praetorius etc.) are perhaps even better examples.  And then may I also add the extensive alternatives suggested by Ives in his music for theatre orchestra. It&apos;s a rich tradition, and I hope that it continues to thrive.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=7686 href="#7686">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2004 2:00:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t see how one could really write a &quot;purely abstract&quot; music,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of only &quot;ideas&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;At some point, you have to decide, what instrument am I writing for?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Bach did not do this in the Art of the Fugue, so it is possible not<br/>&gt;&gt;to.

Clearly here the failure to specify<br/>&gt; instrumentation was deliberate.<br/>&gt;<br/>In the musical offering, the unspecified works are for solo keyboard. There are some real problems in making these pieces fit string or wind ensembles.  For strings, for example, the Art of the Fugue would require an instrument with a tenor-violin range, which is unlikely, and the chromatic possibilities of modern valved brass were hardly available to Bach.  (As a sometime cornetto player, I like to read through these pieces, and wish that he had had the cornetto in mind, but the cornetto was already in retirement by the time Bach wrote the late speculative pieces, and Bach&apos;s explicit use of the cornetto was limited to some early cantata writing).  &gt; &gt;but that actually supports your point if in a more subtle way, in<br/>&gt; &gt;that the individual organist is responsible for the registration,<br/>&gt; &gt;and that registration will necessarily vary from instrument to<br/>&gt; &gt;instrument  ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Bach&apos;s day instrumentation was much more flexible than even this<br/>&gt; suggests.

And in his late works I think we see an even more<br/>&gt; substantial move toward abstract, &apos;pure music&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>I think that there was probably less intermixing than we are now used to. The presence of the harpsichord, even as continuo instrument, in the church  has to carry a huge question mark, and the use of the organ for secular music-making is  likewise circumscribed. The private and pedagogical function of the clavichord is yet another distinction.  It is also useful to consider that although all three instruments share a common keyboard design, they each represent distinct lines of evolution and each have distinctive techniques that are neccesarily echoed in the repertoire.  I&apos;d bet that for any given work of Bach, it would be fairly easy to identify an instrument for which that work was most likely composed, or, that failing, an instrument for whcih that work was very unlikely to have been composed. Bach arrangements all require significant adjustments, of key, tessitura, contour, etc. and all show explicitly his mastery of idiomatic instrumental techniques.  I&apos;ve been playing the Brueggen transcriptions of the cello suites for recorder since &apos;77 or so, and as much as I enjoy playing and listening to them, and admire Brueggen&apos;s restrained editing, I always have the nagging feeling that the pieces are not quite recorder pieces.  The recorder has some great solo repertoire -- including Van Eyck and Telemann -- but the Bach cello suites, to my ears, are not yet among them...</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=7688 href="#7688">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2004 2:52:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My favorite recording hand down of the musical offering is an ensemble of predominantly  strings.<br/>karl muchinger ( sorry about spelling, but now erin is in love with this too, and she has the disk)</p><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;In the musical offering, the unspecified works are for solo keyboard. &gt;There are some real problems in making these pieces fit string or wind &gt;ensembles.  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p></div><h3><a id=7689 href="#7689">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2004 4:20:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have a large number of occasional/experimental pieces in various tunings and temperaments that I would like to put on line.

I am<br/>not<br/>&gt; interested in producing finished sound files of these, but, in the<br/>&gt; spirit of the open score much discussed today, would like to make<br/>them<br/>&gt; available in their &quot;raw midi&quot; format, allowing the individual user<br/>to<br/>&gt; tweak the performance as they see fit on their own axes. Most of<br/>these<br/>&gt; use mappings to a full keyboard tuning so are playable through<br/>either a<br/>&gt; synthesizer with a full keyboard tuning or a program like InTun or,<br/>I<br/>&gt; believe, MIDI Relay.  Are such programs ubiquitous enough that midi<br/>&gt; files would find some listenership?  Should I include the<br/>needed .scl<br/>&gt; and .tun files?  Or is this such a terrible idea that I should drag<br/>it<br/>&gt; back into the cave in which I found it?
