If<br/>you&apos;re using electronics, then what&apos;s the point?  Unless this<br/>instrument is battery-powered and has a self-contained amplifier and<br/>speakers, you&apos;ll still need an electrical outlet and external<br/>amplifier, so you might as well use a synth with a horizontal<br/>keyboard, which will also free you from the limitations posed by<br/>those prefabricated chords in the left hand.  (I abandoned the<br/>conventional Stradella left hand bass-and-chord setup in favor of the<br/>Moschino free-bass system 46 years ago, and never once have I even<br/>thought of going back, so a V-accordion doesn&apos;t appeal to me in the<br/>slightest.)</p><p>I&apos;ll grant that the right-hand button system (with a different black-<br/>white pattern) would be great for a 19-tone tuning, but it would be<br/>preferable to slant the rows to get a true Bosanquet setup, as I did<br/>in this proposal (for my 19+3 tuning):<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/</a><br/>See file KbAc19p3.gif<br/>(You need to be a member of tuning-math to access this.)</p><p>In either case, you would still need a decent free-bass setup for the<br/>left hand, which I&apos;ve previously addressed.  See files AcLH19p3.gif<br/>and BassComp.gif at the above link.  These detail a modified<br/>Bosanquet button arrangement that&apos;s highly suitable for applications<br/>in which the thumb can&apos;t be used (and consequently the ability to<br/>cross fingers over the thumb is lost).</p><p>If you could get me a 19-tone instrument with dual Bosanquet button<br/>arrangements such as I&apos;ve shown, then I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to<br/>contain my excitement. :-D</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2008 12:46:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 12:42 PM 2/8/2008, you wrote:<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Holy crap, I hadn&apos;t noticed this<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.aspx?ObjectId=931">http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.aspx?ObjectId=931</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (Most V-Accordion models are available in &quot;b&quot; versions, but I<br/>&gt;&gt; couldn&apos;t find a V-Accordion home page so I linked to this model.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; George S., have you got your ears on?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, Carl, I&apos;m still here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sorry, but I can&apos;t seem to get too excited about this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As I see it, the chief advantage of the accordion is that it&apos;s a<br/>&gt;keyboard instrument that&apos;s both acoustic and highly portable.</p><p>You don&apos;t see any potential for a MIDI button accordion?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ll grant that the right-hand button system (with a different black-<br/>&gt;white pattern) would be great for a 19-tone tuning, but it would be<br/>&gt;preferable to slant the rows to get a true Bosanquet setup, as I did<br/>&gt;in this proposal (for my 19+3 tuning):<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/</a><br/>&gt;See file KbAc19p3.gif<br/>&gt;(You need to be a member of tuning-math to access this.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In either case, you would still need a decent free-bass setup for the<br/>&gt;left hand, which I&apos;ve previously addressed.</p><p>The original V-Accordion, which we tested at Keybord magazine,<br/>had one (or maybe even two) free bass modes for the left hand.</p><p>&gt;If you could get me a 19-tone instrument with dual Bosanquet button<br/>&gt;arrangements such as I&apos;ve shown, then I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to<br/>&gt;contain my excitement. :-D</p><p>Presumably the MIDI from this accordion could be made to do<br/>what you want.

An additional complication is posed by the<br/>fact that, since the &quot;jumping&quot; vector would correspond to the<br/>separation of pairs of buttons sounding duplicate pitches, one&apos;s<br/>jumping technique would need to be adjusted according to the number<br/>of tones in the tuning.</p><p>A similar situation would occur with the right-hand button keyboard,<br/>where you would have a couple of additional problems.  The existing<br/>black/white pattern would be meaningless for non-12 divisions, and<br/>there would be only one row of duplicate pitches in 22, which is not<br/>enough for transpositional invariance.</p><p>So it would be a lot better to have a custom-built instrument to<br/>handle multiple tunings.</p><p>&gt; &gt;But I guess this is better than nothing.
