If no one else writes me (or the list) by<br/>&gt; &gt; Monday, I&apos;ll spend some time on Tuesday.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Breath to ten!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He he!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;ve know the reason. It&apos;s because there&apos;s a limit on the<br/>&gt; number of downloads that we can have happening at one time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try it again later. I&apos;ll leve it up for a few days, until everyone<br/>&gt; that wishes to hear has got a chance to get the entire composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looking forward to spectral tuning discussions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
