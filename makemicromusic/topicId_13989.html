I checked out some of those videos, which really is a trove of stuff and I&apos;m going to pass it on to colleagues and students, but... yes, comparisons are neither fair nor helpful. The players there, even within the larger &quot;jazz&quot; circle, encompass such a broad range of disciplines and histories that one is being false to call out a &quot;better&quot;. And I should have known better, as well! :)</p><p>&gt;... but  I always thought Jack DeJohnette should be up on the mountain with those guys.</p><p>Absolutely. I have often told my students about how he _walked_ onstage - covering about 20 feet - at an outdoor jazz festival blew me away. I realized then that the grace and flow of a great musician is something carried in their body at all times. He flowed on stage like a cheetah. And one of the greatest single musical moments of my life was a concert with his quintet, where Jack played a solo piano rendition of &quot;Naima&quot;. Devastating.</p><p>&gt;I heard Tony at the Bottom Line once with Jan Hammer. Woah! He was about 15 feet in front of me.</p><p>Oh, you lucky man. I never saw Tony live, to my regret.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2006 10:19:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;db,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s right to compare...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is so right.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t make much sense to me.
