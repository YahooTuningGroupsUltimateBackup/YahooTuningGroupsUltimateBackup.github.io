But friends, I have received some difficult personal news today. In spite of the commentary that has just started up, and with a number of things I&apos;d like to talk about, unfortunately I have to take leave for a while. My brain, and all the rest of me, needs to put energy in other areas, so I won&apos;t be taking part in this list or any other for the time being. If anyone has a particularly important something to tell me, just write me directly - I&apos;ll still be doing email.</p><p>I respect you all, and I love a good number of you. I&apos;ll be back at some point. Please, keep making music!</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div>
