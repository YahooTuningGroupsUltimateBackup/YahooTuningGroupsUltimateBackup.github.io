Your current website is in a subdirectory,<br/>so it won&apos;t work directly with a new domain.  But you could ask your ISP<br/>to manage the domain for you.  You may need to request it be transferred<br/>in writing to these UKReg people.  Or you can take control of the domain<br/>yourself, details at the Nominet site.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as frightening<br/>as they make out.  All you have to do is keep them up to date with the<br/>name servers and keep up the payments.  All of which has to be done in<br/>writing, which is a pain.</p><p>So you could cut your losses and get some American domains instead.  The<br/>host Jon mentioned looks excellent for a small site.  You can also take<br/>full control of the DNS at <a href="http://soa.granitecanyon.com">soa.granitecanyon.com</a>, but that does mean you<br/>have to edit the records yourself.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1479 href="#1479">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2001 3:16:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>graham@... wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Alison wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A bit off topic here Graham, but I wonder if you can help as you<br/>&gt; &gt; obviously know your stuff.
