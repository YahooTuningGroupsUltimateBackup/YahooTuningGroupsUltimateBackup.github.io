They also have a &quot;starving artist&quot; program for $15/month if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re  willing to fly their logo on your home page.  Having people pay<br/>&gt; some  fraction just gets complicated.  Best to try getting enough<br/>&gt; people to  &quot;pledge&quot; some amount for the first year and form a<br/>&gt; collective.  I&apos;d rather  not actually run such a website myself, but as<br/>&gt; I said, I&apos;ll thrown in some  cash to get it rolling, if someone wants<br/>&gt; to pick up the ball.  I&apos;ll even go  double and thrown in forty bucks<br/>&gt; for the first year.  (I just get so damn  sick of the advertising and<br/>&gt; hassles...)</p><p>I&apos;d pay $40 as well.  Collective web space would be a good idea if we can<br/>all pay our bit.  A second site of my own would be a bit much, though.</p><p>&gt; Oh, I just checked and Laughing Squid actually doesn&apos;t have good mail<br/>&gt; list  support; but they do forwarding, and have a few e-mail accounts;<br/>&gt; but they  can&apos;t run a list.  But it&apos;s a place to hang files, if<br/>&gt; anyone&apos;s into that.</p><p>I got through my Metatuning backlog without pop ups.  It looks like<br/>they&apos;ve been dropped as quietly is they were introduced.  It would be nice<br/>to have an escape route if anything like this ever happens as well.  But<br/>mailing-list only wouldn&apos;t be enough, because it&apos;s only the &quot;added value&quot;<br/>web interface that was a problem.</p><p>Do the download problems continue?</p><p>&gt; As of this moment, &quot;<a href="http://MicrotonalCollective.org">MicrotonalCollective.org</a>&quot; is available.</p><p>It looks like I&apos;ve already let <a href="http://meantone.com">meantone.com</a> lapse, as the WHOIS record&apos;s<br/>dated to expire a week ago.  I could try talking to my ISP and see if<br/>they&apos;ll set up <a href="http://collective.microtonal.co.uk">collective.microtonal.co.uk</a> for us, or let me manage the<br/>domain myself.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/17/2001 11:36:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Everyone</p><p>I&apos;d be glad to put up 40 dollars also.  My only concern is keeping it<br/>going - it would be a shame to start a site and have it collapse an<br/>year later because no one kept up collection efforts.</p><p>Rick thanks for sharing the site.  It is actually a lot cheaper than<br/>my current ISP for 500 mb and I probably will switch over at some<br/>point.</p><p>Here is my proposal.  We are close to covering the first year at the<br/>starving artist rate.  To keep it going I would propose that anyone<br/>publishing their musical work on <a href="http://microcollective.org">microcollective.org</a> pay an annual<br/>fee of 30 dollars.  then we only need 6 people to assure its<br/>continuing success.</p><p>The cons of this of course are that it becomes a barrier for some,<br/>but I have a hard time imagining that someone who is working on the<br/>web with their music is unable to afford 30 bucks a year for a clean<br/>spacious place to present their music.</p><p>I think it could work.  I would prefer not to be the organizer.<br/>Actually I would nominate our list mom who has already demonstrated a<br/>great ability to organize and shepard, as well as to design a first<br/>class web site.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div>
