And then you get about 10 varieties of &apos;difference&apos; tones IE between C and D...and C and E..etc...which would make about 1800 possible tones.<br/>  My guess is his ability came from an instinct to be able to separate the above from the base tone.  Someone with such an ability would likely be ace at aligning timbre/overtones and scales EVEN without needing to use Sethares formulas...in fact I would be interested to find if he did any work on aligning timbre with scale.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
