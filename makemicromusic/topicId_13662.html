Chords within the first 16 harmonics that, in 2002, had<br/>&gt; &quot;never been used<br/>&gt; before&quot;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, Ligeti did not get out much either.</p><p>But seriously, LG kept his ears out and was well aware of  everything<br/>from Partch to the French quarter-tone mapping spectralists.  Some of<br/>his students, Wolfgang von Schweinitz for example, actively use harmonic<br/>series and microtonal materials in their pieces.  Although he seems to<br/>be refreshingly candid about his autobiography, I find that anything<br/>that LG says his music in relationship to that of his contemporaries has<br/>to be taken with some salt.  He was not a modest person, and his<br/>estimation of his contemporaries, while often brutally honest, could be<br/>selective.  (One of the most painful moments in my life was watching him<br/>try to share a stage with Conlon Nancarrow for an intermission &quot;chat&quot; in<br/>Cologne. He was so full of himself, and Mr. Nancarrow was so modest,<br/>that with each of the many words that LG uttered, and each of the few<br/>that Mr. Nancarrow made, the audience quickly came to understand that LG<br/>was simply incapable of holding forth on anything but himself.  Score:<br/>Nancarrow 10, Ligeti 0.)</p><p>In any case, I think that it is simply worth noting that LG, a<br/>significant public figure in the new music community, used alternative<br/>tunings, and if as a result of his Hamburg Concerto (which is not to<br/>mention the greater influence of historically-informed performance<br/>practice), more orchestras will entertain the notion of playing with<br/>natural and handhorns, they bully for LG, better for us.  I wrote a<br/>horn-violin-piano trio in &apos;83 that stood unplayed for a long time,<br/>because the piece required a handhorn and a piano in meantone. Nowadays,<br/>asking for a handhorn is no big deal. Bully.</p><p>DJW</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=13679 href="#13679">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2006 2:36:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kylegann1955&quot; &lt;kgann@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, gang,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This statement that Ethan Iverson quotes by Ligeti, talking about<br/>&gt; his Hamburg Concerto of 2002, strikes me as totally implausible:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In the small orchestra there are four natural horns, each of which<br/>&gt; can produce the 2nd to the 16th overtone.
