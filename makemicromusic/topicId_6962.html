Message received :-). And, I&apos;ll look into those comb filters tool!</p><p>- Glenn</p><p>-------------<br/>It is happening more and more. In this case, kudos to Philippe for working on this, as well as past input from Jacky Ligon and X. J. Scott. There&apos;s another guy over in the Crystal users that has put in good words as well.</p><p>I&apos;ll have more news on related items as time permits. I think I&apos;ve also decided &quot;I&apos;ve had enough, I can&apos;t eat another bite&quot; - IOW, I&apos;m going to stop downloading new VSTs and concentrate on working with my setup as it is now. Really, I have enough that there isn&apos;t any reason I couldn&apos;t be making music instead of downloading, testing, tweaking, posting, etc.</p><p>Gotta get my priorities straight.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6969 href="#6969">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2004 2:00:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
