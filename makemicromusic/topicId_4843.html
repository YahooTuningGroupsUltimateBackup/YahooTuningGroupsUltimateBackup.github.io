These are applications, after all, that are calculating things on the fly, so what one is trying to do is shrink the time of computation--&gt;making-a-sound to the smallest amount. The factors affecting a delay from pressing a key to hearing a sound (latency) are:</p><p>- CPU power (a slow CPU can&apos;t compute fast enough)<br/>- soundcard/drivers (either the soundcard can be sluggish in passing data through, or the drivers can be old or slow and don&apos;t allow the data to move fast enough, causing a lag)<br/>- another level of &apos;abstraction&apos;, in this case Scala having to assign midi in a cyclic fashion as it relays to different channels (at least I am inferring that Scala&apos;s relaying functions are a real-time version of the channel/retuning algorithm - Manuel, I&apos;d be happy to hear just what is going on &apos;behind the scenes&apos;)</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t have any latency with Scala just playing it through a soundcard...</p><p>Well, there isn&apos;t a big lag going on with a softsynth trying to get things calculated in time to make a sound. And if you *don&apos;t* have a latency issue, consider yourself fortunate!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4848 href="#4848">ðŸ”—</a>Bonnie Goodwin &#x3C;goodwinbonnie@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2003 9:27:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>Latency can be a problem with soft synths, particularly when it is only one of about a dozen functions you are trying to do at the same time on that poor computer. It&apos;s best to remove as much overhead as possible off of the computer if latency is a problem, perhaps a faster computer, or change over to a pipe organ where latency is measured in much more than milliseconds!!</p><p>Bonnie *:&gt;</p><p>Joseph Pehrson &lt;jpehrson@...&gt; wrote:<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

A special driver has been developed for the &gt;Mac taht is used by many audio software companies called ASIO which goes &gt;for minimal latency through minimal buffering and bypassing the syste&apos;ms &gt;sound routines. Maybe there is something like that on the PC too</p><p>Most of the audio cards and apps support ASIO on the PC as well. There is also another driver format, WDM, that works with the latest Windows configurations, that is supposed to increase communication speed even more. The Aardvark card I&apos;m considering supports both modes of drivers, in addition to older DX and other type drivers.</p><p>&gt;Also, for LMSO and Scala, there will certainly be at least a 3 ms delay (1ms<br/>&gt;to Rx the note on, 2 ms to send the pitch bend and note on out) per note<br/>&gt;simply due to the speed of the MIDI serial protocol, but only when coming<br/>&gt;from and going to hardware. If going to a softsynth, the 2 ms delay on the<br/>&gt;output is eliminated, which is why softsynths can actually be faster han<br/>&gt;hardware synths.</p><p>I&apos;ve never looked to see how much, if any, the USB 1.0 or 2.0 midi interfaces (which is what I use) have improved on the throughput of the older parallel or serial midi ports.</p><p>Man, geek talk today... :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4852 href="#4852">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2003 12:08:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; - another level of &apos;abstraction&apos;, in this case Scala having to assign<br/>midi<br/>&gt; in a cyclic fashion as it relays to different channels (at least I am<br/>&gt; inferring that Scala&apos;s relaying functions are a real-time version of the<br/>&gt; channel/retuning algorithm - Manuel, I&apos;d be happy to hear just what is<br/>&gt; going on &apos;behind the scenes&apos;)</p><p>No the relaying function is much simpler than the retuning function.<br/>It really only does a little bit, so like Jeff I also don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>a major time consumer. The retuning function takes program numbers and<br/>controller messages into account, and the relaying function not.<br/>There&apos;s also the Windows process scheduling which can take some time.</p><p>I&apos;ve had an excellent result under Linux by the way, using a MIDI<br/>keyboard, Scala retuning and the ZynAddSubFX softsynth and I noticed<br/>not any latency. I used the special low latency Linux kernel patch,<br/>which people say gives much less latency than the Windows kernel.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
