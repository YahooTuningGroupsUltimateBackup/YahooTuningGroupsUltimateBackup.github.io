I&apos;m happy that the piece provoked that imagery for you.  A related thought: when I listen to it, it reminds me somehow of the signals monitored by the SETI project -- or maybe of the kind of signal they would *like* to find!  Wouldn&apos;t it make sense for an advanced civilization to make use of simple materials like these (sine waves and intervals based on prime numbers) in order to communicate their intelligence in a way that is based on objective numerical properties?  :-)</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Margo Schulter wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello, everyone, and congratulations to Dave Seidel for _The Gemini<br/>&gt; Nebula_, a composition that was for me a trip in interstellar space,<br/>&gt; with an absorbing and contemplative sonic environment including an<br/>&gt; element of what I would call consonant beating.<br/>&gt; &gt; One reaction: &quot;Wouldn&apos;t this make a great musical environment for one<br/>&gt; of those planetarium shows I enjoyed as a child?&quot; -- and I mean that<br/>&gt; as a deep compliment, Dave, because your piece evokes both beauty and<br/>&gt; wonder.<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you, Dave, also for the notes: it&apos;s interesting how the &quot;twins&quot;<br/>&gt; you selected cluster at the two ends of the octave, and one type of<br/>&gt; astronomical nebula can describe a galaxy (e.g. the Andromeda<br/>&gt; Nebula).
