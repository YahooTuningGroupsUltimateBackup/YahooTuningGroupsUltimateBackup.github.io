Select a new module, and choose AudioFile -&gt; Recorder -&gt; 02 Channels (assuming you want a stereo dump of your playing).

I ask for a very specific question: the aesthetic success of samplers is highly dependent on the up-front work you do, especially in the area of multi-sampling. Unless you want the &apos;munchkinization&apos; effect (where one sample in the mid-range is used, and you get groany, grainy sounds in the low range and R2D2 bleeps in the upper), you need to prepare notes, if not for every pitch, then for a broad range up and down. And that is only *one* kind of sound. If you want any kind of nuance from an instrument besides simply louder and softer, you need to do samples for differing dynamics that capture the timbral changes that occur in playing that changes from loud to soft.</p><p>Not to say you shouldn&apos;t buy a sampler!</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t understand the individual folders bit fully and have asked for &gt;clarification.

Not exactly. There are two things being mixed up here: the<br/>built-in waveforms and the additive waveform generator.</p><p>1. Rhino has a huge set of pre-cooked waveforms that you can use as basic<br/>oscillator waves, just by selecting them from a lsit. This includes sine,<br/>saw, pulse, etc. The traditional analog synth bunch, plus a long list of<br/>other more complicated waveforms.</p><p>2. There is an additive waveform generator utility that allows you to<br/>&quot;draw&quot; a waveform based on harmonics and phase. Incidentally, this utility<br/>allows you to &quot;import&quot; one cycle of a waveform as a WAV file, which it<br/>turns into harmonics that you can then manipulate. This allows you to<br/>expand the basic set of waves above.</p><p>3. Some of the basic pre-cooked waveforms in Rhino are one-shot &quot;attack&quot;<br/>waveforms that are sampled from things like syllables, taps, clinks,<br/>clanks, etc. You can&apos;t expand this set of things; it&apos;s built-in.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2003 9:57:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  <a href="http://www.applied-acoustics.com/tassman.htm">http://www.applied-acoustics.com/tassman.htm</a><br/>&gt;  You can build all sorts of nifty stuff with it as well.</p><p>The Tassman looks very cool and flexible.

Some of the basic pre-cooked waveforms in Rhino are one-shot &quot;attack&quot;<br/>&gt;waveforms that are sampled from things like syllables, taps, clinks, &gt;clanks, etc. You can&apos;t expand this set of things; it&apos;s built-in.</p><p>Well, I was close!
