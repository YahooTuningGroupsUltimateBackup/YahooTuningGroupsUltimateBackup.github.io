Just thought it was about time to introduce myself. I&apos;ve<br/>been privately composing music of all sorts for a number of years, and have<br/>only recently gotten a PC and Internet access. I discovered tuning theory<br/>through Partch&apos;s &quot;Genesis Of A Music&quot; while still in college and have been<br/>fascinated ever since, though I have only been able to devote myself to<br/>composing within the last year -- and brother, there&apos;s a lot of stuff in<br/>here just dying to see the light of day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I have to confess to an astounding ignorance of matters in general, so<br/>please bear with me should I ask apparently dense questions about tuning,<br/>software or the Internet. I&apos;ve just purchased the Orion Pro software (I&apos;ve<br/>been using the demo version for months) and have also downloaded Scala. Any<br/>help with figuring out some of Scala&apos;s finer points will earn my undying<br/>gratitude!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Interested parties will find a little of my music posted at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   <a href="http://artistgigs.com/artist.pl?id=1487">http://artistgigs.com/artist.pl?id=1487</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Listening/downloading is free, though registration is required (sorry!).<br/>A little techno, a little classical crossover.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Anyway, thanks for your help in advance. Glad to be here!<br/>&gt;<br/>[snip]</p><p>&gt; ... only the following three pieces employ non-standard tunings:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot;Ocean Of Fire&quot;           1/1  12/11  9/8  11/9  5/4  4/3  11/8  3/2<br/>18/11  5/3  11/6  15/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot;Dream In Overdrive&quot;     vina tuning of K.S. Subramanian<br/>(indian-vina3.scl)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot; &apos;Ud &amp; Nay&quot;                &apos;ud:  Paul Erlich&apos;s 12 of 22-tet Pythagorean<br/>(12-22a.scl)<br/>&gt;                                    nay:  12 of 24-tet<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Of the above three, only &quot;&apos;Ud &amp; Nay&quot; is short enough not to bore you.<br/>&gt;<br/>[snip]</p><p>&gt; In &quot;Ocean&quot; I wanted a non-Pythagorean JI rationalization of an<br/>&gt; Arabic mode, so I chose 12/11 and 18/11 (150.6 &amp; 852.6) to obtain<br/>&gt; the &quot;neutral second&quot; sound so prevalent in their music. A composer&apos;s<br/>&gt; choice based on the musical need of the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be happy to e-mail you an mp3 file of anything I have, to<br/>&gt; download at your leisure. BTW, please DO criticize my work! How am I<br/>&gt; supposed to continue growing as an artist without feedback? No<br/>&gt; offense will be taken: &quot;What does not kill me, will make me<br/>&gt; stronger.&quot; (Nietzsche).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me know where I can hear some of your own works!<br/>&gt; Presently I&apos;m working on a techno piece with F. Jedrzejewski&apos;s JI 11-<br/>&gt; tet, and a more lyric piece for two guitars and strings with that<br/>&gt; wonderful vina tuning.</p><p>[Gene Ward Smith]<br/>&gt; ... there are<br/>&gt; short descriptions to go with each piece. I think a few words about<br/>&gt; each of your pieces would be a great addition to your ArtistGigs page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Of the above three, only &quot;&apos;Ud &amp; Nay&quot; is short enough not to bore you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mahler&apos;s Third Symphony isn&apos;t long enough to bore me. What will bore<br/>&gt; me is not finding enough that my ear thinks is interesting. I did like<br/>&gt; &apos;Ud and Nay the best of these three; I think more happened in less<br/>&gt; space of time, and it had less of a pop sound to it. That is another<br/>&gt; tastes differ issue of course.</p><p>Hi Jon!</p><p>Pleased to have you here.  Even more pleased<br/>to _hear_ that you use microtonality as yet<br/>another musical resource.  You seem to have<br/>assimilated the technical lingo pretty well.<br/>I ask much dumber questions than almost<br/>anyone, but that way I keep on learning, so<br/>please feel free to ask about anything you<br/>think we may be able to help you with.</p><p>Before reading your message about which<br/>pieces are microtonal, I had already chosen<br/>three different pieces for download.  There<br/>is so much of your music avaialable there<br/>(NOT a bad thing!) that, as Gene said, it would<br/>be very helpful to have some kind of guidance<br/>from you as to what to expect.  That way,<br/>listeners who like pop sounds, or light classical,<br/>or Indian tunings, could try those straight<br/>away.  When bandwidth is an issue (as it was<br/>for me until very recently), most people will<br/>give up after one or two lengthy downloads that<br/>prove unrewarding.</p><p>So, now I have downloaded SIX of your pieces,<br/>and will listen to them when I take my lunch<br/>break later today.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>      Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>      Melbourne PC User Group<br/>      Convener, Graphics Interest Group<br/>      Convener, Music Interest Group<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.385 / Virus Database: 268.2.3/281 - Release Date: 14/3/06</p></div><h3><a id=12574 href="#12574">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2006 5:24:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, Jon (Lyle Smith), I&apos;ve just listened (twice<br/>or more each) to the six of yours I downloaded<br/>two days ago:</p><p>- Aurora<br/>- Crystalline<br/>- Valse<br/>- Dream In Overdrive<br/>- Ocean Of Fire<br/>- &apos;Ud And Nay</p><p>The first two I found competent and pleasant, if<br/>perhaps a little &quot;generic&quot;.
