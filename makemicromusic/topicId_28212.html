I did not use a KBM file for keyboard mapping.<br/>The fifths were on diagonals sw to ne so that made it easy to find my way<br/>around. I think it was note, skip, skip, skip, note for the 5ths.<br/>The software was Pianoteq standard 3.6 with a C 6 piano (I think) modified<br/>to increase harmonic content and sustain and not having enough sustain still<br/>the sustain pedal was kept down the entire time. I recorded it in pianoteq,<br/>saved the midi, edited the midi to take out a few bad notes in Sonar, fired<br/>pianoteq back up, loaded the edited midi and exported the wav file. The wav<br/>was converted to mp3 320kbps in audition. The wav was already &quot;normalized&quot;.</p><p>You can read about selfless mode here - and the picture is the orientation I<br/>played in.</p><p><a href="http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=prod_axis-49">http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=prod_axis-49</a></p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Sep 13, 2011 at 5:38 AM, manuphonic &lt;manuphonic@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This haunting, shattered-then-somber piece is well suited to my<br/>&gt; recollections of the disastrous change in course that history took on<br/>&gt; 2001-9-11.
