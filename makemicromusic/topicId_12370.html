It helps to have at least 4<br/>notes in Blackjack, C,G,D,A that are precisely shared with the piano.</p><p>Aside from that, I can build &quot;quasi just&quot; versions of &quot;regular&quot; 12-<br/>equal triads in the electronics that can mirror or &quot;improve&quot; the<br/>piano statements.</p><p>Most importantly, I think that electronics *greatly* enhances the<br/>tired piano timbre.  It&apos;s that timbre that has been so overworked, in<br/>my view.  There is nothing so deadly as solo piano music, IMHO.</p><p>I admit there have been a few innovative masters of it, Messiaen, La<br/>Monte Young... but think of all the completely deadly solo piano<br/>music that there is out there.  At least *I&apos;ve* heard it; I don&apos;t<br/>know about anybody else.</p><p>The &quot;prepared piano&quot; was one solution, but I can understand the<br/>reluctance of some people to want a fine instrument &quot;tampered&quot;<br/>or &quot;tempered&quot; with.  I&apos;m understanding that now later in life.  When<br/>I was young, I thought such people were just pussies... or rather<br/>sissies.</p><p>In any case, some nice electronics livens things up, in my view,<br/>PARTICULARLY if the electronics are microtonal.  That really makes a<br/>nice contrast to the &quot;black and white&quot; zebra cage of the tempered<br/>piano box.</p><p>I&apos;m coming to believe, though, that, at least in my own work, tuning<br/>only accounts for about 30% of the significance.  Of greater<br/>significance, is contour, contrast, timbre... lots of things.  Tuning<br/>is much more than just a &quot;seasoning&quot; or &quot;coloration,&quot; but it&apos;s less<br/>than the core of what I&apos;m doing, or so it seems.</p><p>Anyway, I will share some of this further down the road, and I hope<br/>to participate more in the online forums again, saving the readers<br/>from the tiresome (although true) excuses as to why I haven&apos;t been<br/>able to be around as much of late...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2006 8:40:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Most importantly, I think that electronics *greatly* enhances the<br/>&gt; tired piano timbre.

This *can* be a good thing<br/>in the right hands--not better or worse, but different.</p><p>Of course, the better electronic music is all about timbre, and the<br/>idea of transcription is totally moot, old-fashioned, and utterly<br/>transcended.</p><p>Stravinsky&apos;s orchestrations are very orchestra specific--listening to<br/>&apos;Le Sacre&apos; on the piano makes that point clearly. It&apos;s like a<br/>different piece entirely, although one recognizes the gestures, the<br/>way the piano squashes the colors emphasises the dissonances even<br/>more, to my ears.</p><p>-Aaron..</p></div>
