There are<br/>industries, different fields (neuroscience, machine learning)<br/>making measurable progress.</p><p>&gt;The reason<br/>&gt;why chess programs and automated theorem provers are actual AI and<br/>&gt;this nonsense isn&apos;t is because in those cases, a model of the question<br/>&gt;being considered is involved. Even so, my late brother Robin</p><p>Late!?  Geez, I&apos;m sorry to hear that.  As you know, I very much<br/>enjoyed his book.</p><p>&gt;the correspondence chess Grand Master was able to clobber people<br/>&gt;using computers because of his understanding of their defects.</p><p>Not any more, alas.  The reign of centaurs lasted only 2 years.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Intelligence seems to naturally arise<br/>&gt;&gt; in systems of sufficient complexity...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A statement of faith, not a scientifically ascertained fact.</p><p>I&apos;ve approached the question philosophically and concluded that<br/>there is no definition of &quot;intelligence&quot; (or of &quot;life&quot; for that<br/>matter) that is distinct from complexity.  And if you want me to<br/>define complexity, I believe a definition can be extracted from<br/>Legg&apos;s formula.</p><p>Adult humans are considered intelligent.  This is either because<br/>they are systems of sufficient complexity interacting with their<br/>environment, and/or they get a boost from their special design.<br/>That boost amounts to something like 700MB (or I think 1.4GB<br/>for diploid cells but don&apos;t quote me on that) of information.<br/>Anyway, it&apos;s small.  So even if my statement is wrong, we&apos;ll be<br/>able to copy the specific design.  I just gave you the brute-force<br/>neuroscience schedule (2021).

As Bill Gates says, it<br/>really only threatens the poorest 1B (mainly by drought), which<br/>would be tragic.
