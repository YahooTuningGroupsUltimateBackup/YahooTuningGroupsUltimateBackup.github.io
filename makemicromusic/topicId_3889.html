I approached Sam Ash here in New York<br/>filled with &quot;synth lust&quot; and with a wad of cash in my pocket.</p><p>Fortunately, I took the time to listen to the Proteus 2000.  I played<br/>just about every sound, until they kicked me out of the store.</p><p>I was not particularly impressed.  For *traditional* sounds, even my<br/>Soundblaster128 (hardly state of the art) seemed to do substantially<br/>better, and for &quot;electronic&quot;-type sounds my old TX81Zs seemed to have<br/>much more color and life.  The 2000 sounds sound &quot;cheapy...&quot; or<br/>something.</p><p>Before you plunk down the $, I would make sure you *listen* to the<br/>modules.  Maybe it was just the day and my ears were filled with wax,<br/>or such like, but I rather doubt it.  Perhaps I&apos;ll try to listen to<br/>the Proteus 2000 or the Virtuoso 2000 again sometime.  My guess is,<br/>though, based on past experiences, that my results will be the same.</p><p>As Jeff Scott states, though, the module is eminently tunable,<br/>probably about the best from that angle.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=3905 href="#3905">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2002 5:59:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Judith!<br/>    As someone who early on explored different inversion of even qq limit chords, i can testify that resolution of 1.56 athough small, quickly accumulate into very<br/>noticable errors. At best, one ends up with beating patterns that are divorced from the material one is looking at.
