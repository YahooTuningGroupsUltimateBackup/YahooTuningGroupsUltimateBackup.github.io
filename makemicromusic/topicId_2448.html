Over the years<br/>(since 97), when I want to do something simple with music, I&apos;ll sit<br/>and make drum rhythms, and so I&apos;ve amassed many gigs of beats this<br/>way.</p><p>Excellent. Sounds like you have quite a collection... err so when are you going to start all over at 24bit (and once again with all future audio standards?); just kidding.. ;)</p><p>&gt;This is why I think we need some more groove oriented tunes getting<br/>made (a personal goal among many).</p><p>Yes, I certainly am quite interested in rhythm; that is why I gravitated towards techno DJing instead of trance/house/jungle, etc. I can&apos;t wait to create a set of records with varying meters where creative overlaying and juxtaposition will be necessary to move from one to the next instead of just a 4 on the floor gig.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m an archiving obsessive. Learned the lessons long ago. Yes - I<br/>think that was when I first walked through &quot;The Bill Gates of Hell&quot;.</p><p>Speaking of &apos;97 and the above I was reminded of my time before becoming involved in electronic music production when I just had my guitar and a Dr. Rhythm... Old school Bossa Nova baby... then again, maybe not.. I only had a Pentium166 and the standard Soundblaster of the day (I had to borrow a second sound card for the one track I took multiple takes on as they were half duplex back then); oh yeah a Digitech RP-12 or something like that. I wished I had the software I have now, but then again things wouldn&apos;t have been the same. I constantly struggled with the inability of not being able to record and not having anyone to play with; nothing written down.. I recorded a few things, but I believe at one point my hard drive became unreadable and I lost it all. I just remembered about this one tape I dubbed with one guitar track for a car ride and I still had it tucked away. I mastered it from the tape today; this is the only thing that survived from &apos;94-&apos;97 for me. I didn&apos;t have a way to do overdubs, so each part was recorded in full, so creating something really complicated was too difficult to lay out in one take.. Thought I would share this in the spirit of Sethares and Monz guitar recordings; though it is not microtonal:</p><p><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/first_night.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/first_night.mp3</a></p><p>I now have 150gigs spread across 3 hard drives and mucho space on a server. I learned my lesson!</p><p>Joseph said:<br/>&gt;Since we were speaking of Cage and such like...<br/>Has anybody here thought about the fact that we now are experiencing<br/>a new &quot;silence??&quot; At least *I* am.<br/>It&apos;s the constant sound of computers humming.<br/>I&apos;m assuming other people are around this as much as *I* am.<br/>It seems to be the new &quot;silence...&quot; ??</p><p>You are coming around to the popular microsound area now. This is an idea that area has started to run with for the last 8-10 years; worship of the glitch (and lots of inflated egos; I had to jump ship on that area a few months ago). See the computer music journal article from Kim Cascone, <a href="http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Computer-Music-Journal/Documents/cmjlib/index.html">http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Computer-Music-Journal/Documents/cmjlib/index.html</a> basically the article just drops a bunch of names without going into much detail. Interesting and good music is coming from that area, but I don&apos;t like how it turned into a solidified &quot;movement&quot;.</p><p>There apparently is also a CD out in the last year with a bunch of takes on Silence 4&apos;33 from well silence; to full on digital noise.</p><p>Anyway...<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
