It is over 120 now.  Almost outdoing the SuperCollider and Music-DSP tribe combined!</p><p>I&apos;ve found the Myspace Music profiles to be handy in having &quot;yet another forum&quot; to put ones music up and randomly get more people to listen to it.</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
