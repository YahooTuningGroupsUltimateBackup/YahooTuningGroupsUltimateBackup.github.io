My<br/>only regret is that I didn&apos;t check my e-mail in a more timely fashion so<br/>that I could have replied with my permission more quickly, rather than<br/>only two days after your original inquiry was sent. However, it&apos;s a<br/>pleasure to say publicly what a service you are performing for us all.</p><p>More generally, anything I post here is available for podcasting under<br/>something like the GNU Public License, and I&apos;m wondering if I could give<br/>you some general permission that would apply to any future events of this<br/>kind. My concern is that if I were away from home, or simply happened not<br/>to see e-mail in timely fashion, I wouldn&apos;t want that to interfere with<br/>this most worthy endeavor or an opportunity to participate.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15365 href="#15365">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2006 1:55:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; More generally, anything I post here is available for podcasting under<br/>&gt; something like the GNU Public License, and I&apos;m wondering if I could give<br/>&gt; you some general permission that would apply to any future events of<br/>this<br/>&gt; kind.
