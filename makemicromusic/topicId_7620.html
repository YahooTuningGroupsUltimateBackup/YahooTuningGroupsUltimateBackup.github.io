And actually exists within<br/>&gt; &gt;midi itself, part of the midi spec but seldom implemented.</p><p>&gt; Whoa. . . . .IS this possible on any synth? I think my syth (Roland<br/>&gt; XV-5050) can only re-tune the 12 pitch-classes.</p><p>Unfortuunately no. A lot of the midi standard is optional - I think a synth<br/>doesn&apos;t even need to support pitch bending at all for instance to count as a<br/>midi synth. So this is one of the optional features and it<br/>is one that manufacturers rarely choose to implement.</p><p>It is perfectly acceptable for a midi synth to just retune the 12 pitch<br/>classes. Even that would be very useful if one could do the retuning<br/>in a standard way via midi, e.g. make a midi file that could be<br/>played on any synth that supports pitch class retuning - it<br/>would give far more &quot;pitch polyphony&quot;,<br/>but unfortunately rather than develop one way of doing it<br/>all the synths have different formats for the sysexes they use<br/>for changing the tuning tables - which is the reason for all<br/>the long list of supported synth types in SCALA.</p><p>So a midi file that lets you retune one synth won&apos;t work with<br/>others. A program that lets you retune via midi has<br/>to include a long list of supported synths and the user then selects<br/>from the list in order to retune - as SCALA does.<br/>Also as manufacturers make up their own<br/>sysex formats for retuning, you can&apos;t just look up and see how<br/>it works in the midi standard because how it works is<br/>up to the manufacturer and they can do it any way<br/>they please since they are using non standard custom<br/>defined sysexes anyway (which of course is also<br/>permitted in the standard).</p><p>It would be great if more were to support MTS.</p><p>Some hardware synths in the Proteus family support it<br/>apparently, and the FM7 does as do some other soft synths<br/>by Native Instruments. The FM7 certainly works well<br/>as I&apos;ve used that myself retuning it using FTS<br/>via MTS sysexes, in real time.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7639 href="#7639">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2004 4:10:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So a midi file that lets you retune one synth won&apos;t work with<br/>&gt; others.

The problem is that this official standard MTS<br/>tuning dump message is not often implemented.</p><p>&gt; Also as manufacturers make up their own<br/>&gt; sysex formats for retuning, you can&apos;t just look up and see how<br/>&gt; it works in the midi standard because how it works is<br/>&gt; up to the manufacturer and they can do it any way<br/>&gt; they please since they are using non standard custom<br/>&gt; defined sysexes anyway (which of course is also<br/>&gt; permitted in the standard).</p><p>So they can, but it is also possible for them to simply use the<br/>standard MTS tuning message, as Timidity for instance does. This is<br/>what Scala will put in your midi file if you ask it to.</p></div><h3><a id=7662 href="#7662">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2004 5:27:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;It lets you tune any of the 127 midi notes to any pitch you<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;like so completely eliminates the midi retuning one pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;per channel problems in Mdi.
