It&apos;s a great device, and Peterson is a<br/>great company.  I chose the 590 because it can produce audio<br/>tones for aural tuning.</p><p>In recent years, Peterson has developed digital modeling strobe<br/>tuners.  I bought the V-SAM in 2004 or -5 but sent it back,<br/>largely because the blue rubber boot it came with had a foul<br/>odor.  If I were to do it today I might consider using their<br/>StroboSoft software with a laptop.  But it can be nice to have<br/>a reliable, dedicated device just for tuning.</p><p>I think the 590 is probably the best tuning device you can get<br/>for that much money.  However, if you want really professional<br/>piano tunings, I recommend the Verituner</p><p><a href="http://veritune.com">http://veritune.com</a></p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 06:02 AM 10/18/2008, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Hello everyone<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which tuner should I get for<br/>&gt;tuning my piano and other<br/>&gt;instruments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was looking at the Peterson<br/>&gt;strobe tuners.
