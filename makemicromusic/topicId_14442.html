This is my first message to the group. I wanted to share<br/>with you some new sounds from my decaphonic guitar, which is based on the<br/>ten-tet scale discussed by Bill Sethares in Chapter 12 of his book Tunning,<br/>Timbre, Spectrum, Scale. What initially got me into this are, first, his<br/>comments of his composition &quot;Ten Fingers&quot;, using a sampled guitar [&quot;..a<br/>musical style from an unknown musical tradition&quot; (p.262)] and &quot;...there are<br/>no ten-ten guitars...&quot; (p.261). So I decided to have my luthier Mateo Crespi<br/>from Buenos Aires built me a tent-tet guitar and started experimenting with<br/>it.
