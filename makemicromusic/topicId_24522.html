All composers for centuries - be it Machaut,<br/>Scarlatti, Chopin, Stravinski or Ligetti - had to solve same basic<br/>tasks and fighted with same problems when creating music. These are<br/>independent from music style, or used material. Some of them:</p><p>- to select proper basic material for the work and find its features,<br/>what it offers and how long or how much or deep we can exploit it<br/>without recycling or information redundance (but even redundance can<br/>be used intentionally!)</p><p>- to found the optimal way how to work with selected material (but<br/>even wrong work with material can be used intentionally!)</p><p>- to found proper form for selected material and best balance between<br/>form and contents. Too much emphasized skeleton fo work is same<br/>painful like too detailed work with micromotifs without any frame.</p><p>- to found proper relation and balance between rational and emotional<br/>elements in music. Both extremes mean boring music, too much<br/>mechanically constructive or too much improvisational and amorph.<br/>(But both those extremes can be used intentionally on higher<br/>compositional level to get planned impact.)</p><p>- to found proper relation between chaos (randomness) and order. Both<br/>extremes mean boring music, too much random music (aleatorics or free<br/>improvisation) can sound very similar like too much organized music<br/>(multiserialism, computer music). Again - both extremes are sometimes<br/>applicable.</p><p>- to found proper balance between smooth processes or sudden changes<br/>and contrasts. Both is necessary, and can be combined in many ways.<br/>Or work can use only one of these structural principles.</p><p>- to found proper balance between known (older) and unknown (new,<br/>original) elements and parameters. Two much known means eclecticism<br/>(recycling) and danger that listeners will be bored from information<br/>redundance, two much new means danger that listeners will be shocked<br/>and tired from density of new information.</p><p>- to found optimal way for given work how to distribute information<br/>and its density, in all music parameters which we use in that work<br/>(not all of them must be always present)</p><p>- to try to be original, unique among the other composers of same<br/>times, try to bring something new, original, unique, some personal<br/>voice, something which differs us from the other.</p><p>Maybe someboidy will find more items...</p><p> From this is clear that the most important sciences for composer are<br/>information theory and psychology.</p><p> From this point of view it&apos;s clear that in music composition<br/>material is not so important, anything can be used as a base. Much<br/>more important is what we do with this material in time, how we work<br/>with it in the context.</p><p>All this started to be extremely important in 20th century, when all<br/>individual music parameters were deeply exploited to their extreme<br/>limits, and it seemed no older rules are usable for contemporary<br/>music and nothing new or surprising is possible to invent. Composers<br/>started to combine everything, and create individual and special form<br/>for each new work depending on used material.</p><p>Despite similar basic attitude the situation and position of<br/>contemporary composer is much more complex then situation of Mozart.<br/>He had one and the only mainstream style of its times, defined by<br/>clear, simple and strict rules for all music parameters, and a lot of<br/>space to forget about rules and invent something quite new (which he<br/>did in certain aspects, but not so much as experimenting innovative<br/>composers like for example Gesualdo, Scarlatti, Rejcha, Debussy or<br/>Sch&ouml;nberg). It was much easier to be genius those times.</p><p>Nowadays (exactly said after 70ies when the last significant music<br/>style in contemporary music came into the use) we have lot of music<br/>styles to our disposal, but almost nothing new to invent (oh sorry,<br/>there&apos;s a microtonality). So we can use all previous historical music<br/>styles and their rules including Multiserialism (50ies), Aleatorics &amp;<br/>Timbre music (60ies), Electronic &amp; computer music (since end of<br/>40ies), Minimalism (since 60ies), New simplicity (70ies) plus some<br/>usable and interesting elements of all pop music styles and world<br/>ethnic music styles. We can only try to combine all this.</p><p>This all is valid also for music using microtonality. We have to<br/>select basic material, found an optimal way how to work with it, and<br/>make some music from it. That&apos;s all, so simple it is. It&apos;s enough to<br/>use information theory, psychology and common sense.</p><p>Terms like &quot;effective cadences&quot;, &quot;resolving chord progressions&quot;, &quot;non<br/>diatonic scales&quot;, &quot;tonal center&quot;, &quot;resolution&quot; still are valid and<br/>can be used even for microtonal music, but not always. Why microtonal<br/>music should use tonal center when somebody will use something like<br/>atonal, dodecaphonic tone rows attitude? Also it doesn&apos;t mean such<br/>microtonal &quot;music will sound bad&quot;, why?</p><p>Once more I emphasize there are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; scales, chords,<br/>chord progressions, motifs or anything like this. Everything in music<br/>is context dependent. Even &quot;chaotic structures&quot; or &quot;awkward sound&quot; is<br/>usable in musical context, beg you pardon. Also I don&apos;t know any<br/>&quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; chords, that&apos;s nonsense. It must be judged in<br/>concrete musical context. Major triad with minor seventh will have<br/>different impact when used as dominant chord in Baroque, combined<br/>with tonic root in Classicism cadenzas, as subdominant chord in blues<br/>or in Janacek or Martinu work, or as timbral mixture in chains in<br/>some Debussy work.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 11 Jan 2011, at 5:45 AM, cityoftheasleep wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is lacking in the microtonal community is not good scales, but<br/>&gt; rather instructions on how to use them.  Compositional theory,<br/>&gt; basically.  The number one objection to microtonality I encounter<br/>&gt; among regular musicians is that they have no idea how to integrate<br/>&gt; new intervals and new scales into intelligible music.  Anyone<br/>&gt; trained in classical music theory has to throw out everything they<br/>&gt; know to deal with microtonal scales outside of the meantone family,<br/>&gt; and they are reluctant to do that when there are no analogous<br/>&gt; guiding theories for these new microtonal scales.  No one has<br/>&gt; worked out effective cadences or resolving chord progressions in<br/>&gt; non-diatonic scales, so even if you have a scale with lots of<br/>&gt; strong chords, if you don&apos;t know how to move between them in<br/>&gt; effective ways that create a sense of tonal center and a sense of<br/>&gt; resolution, the music will sound bad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is why I think your &quot;bad&quot; scales work about as well as your<br/>&gt; &quot;good&quot; scales: the focus on dyads (or even triads) obscures the<br/>&gt; relationships between the chords, giving your scales an overall<br/>&gt; chaotic structure where chord progressions sound awkward.  So<br/>&gt; regardless of how strong or weak individual chords are, what is<br/>&gt; more important is how to move between them--the overall web that<br/>&gt; connects the chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Spend more time studying the connections in your scales, and also<br/>&gt; studying the structure of other good scales--map out all the<br/>&gt; triads, tetrads, pentads, and figure out the intervals that connect<br/>&gt; them.  Then figure out how it &quot;feels&quot; to move by various<br/>&gt; intervals.  Consider this: if you have two strong, pure major<br/>&gt; triads--the most basic consonance possible--it feels very different<br/>&gt; in terms of resolution if they are separated by a 4/3, by a 3/2, by<br/>&gt; a 5/4, by an 11/10, by a 7/6, etc.  Movement by intervals like 7/6<br/>&gt; or 11/10 is weak in terms of creating resolution, even if you are<br/>&gt; going from one strong chord to another.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24567 href="#24567">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2011 11:32:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel wrote:</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s necessary some new theory of composition for<br/>&gt;microtonal music, why.

The same is truth about any other tuning or scales. There are many of them, some with interesting features which I can use or emphasize in my music or I can go against them and use tuning or scale some other way. For me tuning is only basic material, and it&apos;s necessary to work with it on higher compositional level. What is interesting for me are for example processual or sudden changes in size of intervals, steps used for melodic motifs or for building the chords. I can create melody which uses different step sizes in some very fine tuning like 84ET, for example 3-6-9-13-8-5-21-11 (some of them upwards, some downwards), and when this motif is used later in composition, it can be expanded for example to 6-9-12-16-11-8-24-14 (by adding 3), or compressed to 1-4-7-11-6-3-19-9 (by subtracting 2)...</p><p>This is constructive attitude, real composing, writing things in the score and later try to record it from the score. It can be laborious process, so of course we can use microtonal material also in improvisation on instrument, record it, edit in MIDI or audio and made score from it ex post (if we want to have score - in many cases it&apos;s not so much necessary). Or use some combination of both approaches, partly prepared improvisation or partly written score with places reserved for improvisation. Like in any other contemporary compositional work. I don&apos;t see big differences in this basic attitude between 12 tone and microtonal music, or even music based only on noises or written only for drums and percussions.
