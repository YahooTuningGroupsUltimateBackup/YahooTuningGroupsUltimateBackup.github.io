I think the development of the timbres<br/>would be *very* interesting, much more than worrying about the 7&apos;s.<br/>Not so many composers have done the interesting experiments in timbre<br/>that *you* have done, but *lots* of people have written in 7!</p><p>As I said, there is absolutely *nothing* wrong with the first<br/>version; I was just intrigued by the idea of taking it &quot;out&quot; the<br/>*other* way.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 10:20:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2969">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2969</a></p><p>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., sethares@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not only wasnt there any harmonic motion, there was only one NOTE<br/>&gt; &gt; in the whole piece!

I remember in that particular &apos;experiment&apos;<br/>&gt; getting to a point in creating the texture, and just<br/>thinking &quot;Well -<br/>&gt; this stands on its own, I&apos;ll take it no further&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Bill.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L</p><p>***Personally, I think it would be *ruined* if you messed around too<br/>much with it...</p><p>jp</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 10:27:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>J und B,</p><p>I like them both</p><p>in unison, and in 7</p><p>shunning the hex</p><p>I&apos;m transported to heaven</p><p>Danke,<br/>George</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2002 3:55:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., sethares@e... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;Anyway, I just mean by &quot;pop&quot; the kind of rhythmic regularity that<br/>&gt; kicks in at about 16 seconds into the piece, after the intro where<br/>&gt; the various sounds are &quot;let ring&quot; a bit.</p><p>i found bill sethares&apos;s piece to be very &quot;pop&quot; in other ways as well.<br/>can music in odd time signatures and shifting tonalities be pop? you<br/>bet! have you listened to stereolab? i&apos;d recommend the album _dots<br/>and loops_ though i&apos;m told _cobra and phases group_ is a great one.</p><p>as for tuning, bill&apos;s piece certainly could be transcribed in<br/>traditional notation without doing any disservice to its musical<br/>content. just as bob wendell&apos;s choral group and, say, Take 6, can<br/>sing traditionally notated pieces in adaptive tuning, so this<br/>particular adaptively tuned piece could be notated traditionally. so<br/>i can&apos;t reject the &quot;pop&quot; label on the basis of tuning.</p><p>finally, as an avid collector of fusion and progressive rock music, i<br/>enjoyed the piece immensely. it would be right at home on my CD rack,<br/>yet it clearly resembles no band or artist i&apos;ve heard before. it<br/>reminds me a tiny bit of some of bill bruford&apos;s solo work and his<br/>work in 1980&apos;s king crimson, of the dixie dregs, etc. . . but really<br/>it shines its own bright light of originality (who cares if an<br/>algorithm is or isn&apos;t the source of most of this originality) . . .<br/>so a big CONGRATULATIONS to you and a big ROCK ON -- i hope you&apos;ll<br/>pursue such original directions more in the future!!</p><p>&gt; I get it.

In no way could a composer who did both the Li Po song settings and the music of &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot; be considered mono-stylistic. One of the difficulties of introducing a new listener to Partch is... which Partch? The Partch of the intimate and personal early &apos;song&apos; period? The mid-period, &apos;Americana&apos; Partch of the &quot;Wayward&quot; cycle? The Partch of large-scale (and large &apos;orchestra&apos;) theatre-dramas?</p><p>Lot&apos;s o&apos; variety.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
