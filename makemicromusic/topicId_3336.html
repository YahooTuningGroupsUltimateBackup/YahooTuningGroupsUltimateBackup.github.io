Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 3:59:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Judith Conrad, and please let me add my welcome to<br/>MakeMicroMusic -- with thanks for your Web page on 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, including the practical comments on tuning by ear.</p><p>Here my comments relate mainly to the portion of the meantone era with<br/>which I&apos;m most familiar, the late 15th to early 17th centuries.</p><p>One factor which could have led a musician such as Francisco Salinas<br/>(1577) to lean toward 1/3-comma meantone is that this tuning is almost<br/>identical to 19-tone equal temperament as advocated by Guillaume<br/>Costeley (1570), who describes his circulating 19-tone keyboard with<br/>each diatonic whole-tone divided into three parts. His instrument has<br/>split keys for the five usual accidentals, plus extra keys for E# and<br/>B# to achieve a complete circulating temperament.</p><p>With 1/4-comma meantone, a circulating system involves a more<br/>elaborate instrument of 31 notes -- such as the _archicembalo_ or<br/>&quot;superharpsichord&quot; of Nicola Vicentino (1555), and the later<br/>instruments of Scipione Stella and Fabio Colonna (as described in<br/>Colonna&apos;s treatise of 1618).</p><p>While Zarlino considers 1/3-comma rather &quot;languid&quot; in comparison with<br/>1/4-comma or his own 2/7-comma (major and minor thirds equally<br/>impure), the 19-tone equal system has had considerable popularity in<br/>the 20th century -- in the compositions of Joel Mandelbaum, for<br/>example -- while the 31-tone system as advocated, implemented and<br/>composed for by Adriaan Fokker has served as the basis for a school of<br/>music in the Netherlands.</p><p>My own favorite practical tuning for the more esoteric side of<br/>meantone is two 12-note manuals in 1/4-comma meantone (Eb-G#<br/>arrangement) at the distance of an enharmonic diesis apart (128:125,<br/>~41.06 cents). This is, of course, much easier to implement with a<br/>synthesizer and two MIDI keyboards, with a reconstruction of a period<br/>instrument -- although one could possibly tune a two-manual<br/>harpsichord in this fashion. Here&apos;s a piece I composed that might<br/>illustrate this kind of style through some actual music:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a></p><p>I have an idea on how this _might_ be done in theory on a two-manual<br/>harpsichord, but as a practical harpsichordist you&apos;d be the person to<br/>say if it&apos;s feasible and/or wise -- I&apos;d love to share my idea, maybe<br/>via e-mail, and seek your real-world feedback. It basically involves<br/>placing the lower manual in a usual Eb-G# meantone, and simply<br/>carrying your method based on pure major thirds for another 12 notes,<br/>with each note on the upper manual a diesis higher than its<br/>counterpart on the lower manual.</p><p>Composers such as Vicentino and Colonna use the diesis or &quot;fifthtone&quot;<br/>as an expressive melodic interval, emulating the enharmonic genus of<br/>the ancient Greeks, where a semitone was divided into two dieses.</p><p>They also use novel kinds of intervals like neutral thirds and sixths,<br/>about halfway between the usual major and minor sizes. Mary Beth<br/>Ackerley, a gifted composer and performer, has expressed great<br/>interest in this music, for example sharing here a custom electronic<br/>instrumentation of a passage by Colonna; the discussion should be<br/>available in our archives at Yahoo.</p><p>Having this fifthtone music performed on historical instruments would<br/>give another side of the picture. Unfortunately, we have only a few<br/>complete pieces that I know of, but lots of examples and some sections<br/>of madrigals by Vicentino. While one piece by Colonna does call for a<br/>full circulating tuning of 31 notes, many of the pieces or examples<br/>can each fit on an instrument with two 12-note manuals a diesis apart,<br/>or 24 notes in all.</p><p>A fine point: 12-tone equal temperament could be called &quot;1/11-comma<br/>meantone,&quot; since each fifth is narrowed by about 1.96 cents, or<br/>roughly 1/11 of the syntonic comma (81:80 or ~21.51 cents). To achieve<br/>pure 5:4 major thirds, the full comma must be dispersed over a chain<br/>of four fifths -- as is done in 1/4-comma. In 12-equal or 1/11-comma,<br/>only about 4/11 of the comma is dispersed, leaving major thirds impure<br/>by about 7/11 comma, or ~13.69 cents.</p><p>Since meantone focuses so much on the purity of the thirds, the<br/>syntonic comma seems a natural unit of measurement. In 12-equal, each<br/>fifth is more precisely tempered by 1/12 of the Pythagorean comma<br/>(531441:524288, ~23.46 cents) by which 12 pure fifths exceed 7 pure<br/>octaves, thus making the 12-note circle close with each fifth equally<br/>impure. Since the syntonic comma is about 11/12 the size of the<br/>Pythagorean comma, this is equivalent to 1/11-comma meantone.</p><p>On meantone accidentals in the 16th century, I would say that at least<br/>by the second quarter of the century, C# and G# are quite routine and<br/>frequently used. They are often essential for cadential semitones, or<br/>for closing sonorities with major thirds above the lowest note -- as<br/>with E-G# in the Phrygian mode on E.</p><p>Your comments remind me, however, that around 1480-1520, there were<br/>evidently some differences on the best choice of accidentals for a<br/>&quot;standard&quot; 12-note tuning, with Ramos (1482) favoring Ab-C#, and<br/>Schlick describing a compromise where Ab-C is reasonably serviceable<br/>while E-G# is marginally accidental for quick ornamental use in<br/>cadences to A. Lindley cites some passages from Schlick&apos;s organ music<br/>to illustrate these usages.</p><p>By the 1520&apos;s, however, the increasing use of thirds in closing<br/>sonorities, and the preference that these thirds be major, may have<br/>favored G# as a routine inflection, and thus Eb-G# as the standard<br/>tuning for 12-note keyboards.</p><p>These are my general impressions, based on my experience with<br/>16th-century music. The Ab/G# question and Renaissance approaches to<br/>accidentals (written or unwritten) is something I also discuss a bit<br/>in a FAQ article at Todd McComb&apos;s fine Early Music FAQ Site of the<br/>Medieval Music and Arts Foundation:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a></p><p>By the way, having written this and then read the latest Digest which<br/>arrived in the meantone -- or meantime -- I might add that while indeed I<br/>regard the choice of intervals as a matter of style, the reactions of<br/>Renaissance musicians coming in the 16th century from their stylistic<br/>viewpoints is, at least in part, a matter of record as well as<br/>guessing.</p><p>In 1581, for example, Vincenzo Galilei, who regards the 12-note equal<br/>temperament of the lute as a special perfection of this instrument,<br/>nevertheless finds the same tuning less palatable on the harpsichord with<br/>its more &quot;vehement&quot; timbre -- and expresses a preference for the 2/7-comma<br/>meantone of his teacher Zarlino, even though he regards the distinction<br/>between Ab and G# in theory a &quot;defect&quot; of meantone.</p><p>There are some debates and discussions on this in the early 17th century,<br/>with Mersenne sometimes expressing mixed feelings. One comment is that<br/>equal semitones might not sound so strange if they were more familiar --<br/>but meantone was evidently the norm, in 12 notes or sometimes up to 31.</p><p>Mark Lindley suggests that Froberger, for example, wrote certain pieces<br/>which would actually sound best with equal semitones; but for the most<br/>part, this tuning was viewed as appropriate to lute rather than<br/>keyboards. Both the convenience of fretting a polyphonic lute so that the<br/>same step could be used as a major or minor semitone across strings, and<br/>the milder timbre, might explain this acceptance of equal semitones on the<br/>lute in a stylistic context where meantone for keyboards is the norm.</p><p>By the way, just as a few people proposed or experimented with something<br/>like 12-equal on keyboards (although a circulating meantone in 19 notes or<br/>31 provides a more idiomatic alternative), Galilei reports that some<br/>people added special frets to the lute to get purer thirds than the usual<br/>equal semitones would provide. While Galilei pokes fun at this as a<br/>gimmick not necessary for a truly talented performer (such as himself), he<br/>remarks suggest that the period predilection for 5:4 and 6:5 thirds<br/>prompted custom fretting by some performers even on the lute.</p><p>Again, welcome to MakeMicroMusic.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=3440 href="#3440">ðŸ”—</a>judithconrad@...</h3><span>6/21/2002 7:25:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 21 Jun 2002, at 3:59, M.

It&apos;s becasuse I want the focus of the page to be how easy it<br/>is to do this one tuning on your own instrument, by ear. So many<br/>people nowadays seem so intimidated out of even trying, partly by<br/>the fact that all the instructions come with electronically generated<br/>numbers to six decimal points, and they think that much accuracy<br/>is necessary. I submit that if you can&apos;t hear it, it doesn&apos;t matter, at<br/>least to you while you are learning. Training your ear does matter.</p><p>Which brings to mind Jeff&apos;s suggestion that 1/2 comma meantone<br/>is the easiest pf all to tune. The only way I can figure to do this<br/>other than to do the math and use a monochord is to tune a pure<br/>beatless 9/8 major second, 9/8 to the sixth power being very close<br/>to 2 (and therefore the sequence c-d-3-f#-g#-a#-c&apos; with all seconds<br/>pure gives quite close to an octave), then you split the difference<br/>between them making g to produce equally-beating 5ths with c and<br/>d&apos;, and the same with a, b, c# d# and f. Sounds neat. The problem<br/>is, I don&apos;t think I can do it. I&apos;ll try it on the harpscihord when I get a<br/>moment, but hearing a pure beatless 9/8 major second is not a<br/>skill I think I have. I have never seen beatless seconds given as a<br/>test in any tuning directions I can remember ever! Am I forgetting<br/>something?</p><p>&gt; My own favorite practical tuning for the more esoteric side of<br/>&gt; meantone is two 12-note manuals in 1/4-comma meantone (Eb-G#<br/>&gt; arrangement) at the distance of an enharmonic diesis apart (128:125,<br/>&gt; ~41.06 cents).</p><p>It sounds lovely. I own enough clavichords now that I could in fact<br/>stack them -- but there&apos;s quite a bit of variability in the pitch one<br/>gets from a clavichord. I am told  Bermudo actually said you get<br/>enharmonics on the clavichord by pushing harder, so you don&apos;t<br/>need split keys (which would prove he wasn&apos;t talking about quarter<br/>comma meantone, or that he strung his clavichords really light, I<br/>think -- Bermudo&apos;s treatise was published in Germany in the &apos;50&apos;s,<br/>but I haven&apos;t been able to find a copy, and the Stevenson<br/>paraphrase is wonderful but omits the parts on tuning...)</p><p>In any case, I now have a 17th century clavichord on order which is<br/>a copy of the only one I have found in copyable condition that has<br/>enharmonic splits, and what it has is split d#/e flat in every octave.<br/>Just one accidental between g and a, no choice of g sharp or a flat.</p><p>And by the way, finding a good builder who was willing to take on<br/>the task of building me that was a monumental soap opera. And I<br/>don&apos;t have it yet, the soap opera may continue yet a while. I own<br/>the Fabiano Colonna book on the Sambuca Lincea, but my best<br/>guess is that finding a reputable builder to build me that one is just<br/>not going to happen.</p><p>Best,<br/>Judy</p></div><h3><a id=3441 href="#3441">ðŸ”—</a>judithconrad@...</h3><span>6/21/2002 7:46:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 21 Jun 2002, at 10:25, judithconrad@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Which brings to mind Jeff&apos;s suggestion that 1/2 comma meantone<br/>&gt; is the easiest pf all to tune.
