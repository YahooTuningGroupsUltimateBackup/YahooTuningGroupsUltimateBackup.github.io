It seem to remember that Pierre took<br/>the first swing!<br/>I believe the meeting took place in nY and pierre mad come to see his<br/>instruments. Bow-laz pronounced quite loudly that &quot;these are the instruments<br/>that are supposed to replace the orchestra.   Harry said something back and<br/>yes p took a swing and harry swung back . They sere separated and supposedly<br/>the whole thing lasted 20 seconds. Maybe ben made it up but i didn&apos;t</p><p>As far as history records- history for the most part is written by people who<br/>were not there.</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.

I&apos;ll have to ask Danlee about it, since he was there in NY (assuming this was in the 60&apos;s, otherwise who knows?).</p><p>One thing for sure: he didn&apos;t suffer fools gladly!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
