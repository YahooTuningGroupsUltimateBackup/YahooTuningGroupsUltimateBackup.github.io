When it isn&apos;t full, that is.</p><p>Right now we&apos;ve got over 17megs of the 20 allowed in use. I don&apos;t think a lot of it is very recent, so I&apos;m asking politely:</p><p>If you&apos;ve put something in the files area that isn&apos;t germane at the moment, is dated in some fashion, or simply you forgot it was there, would you mind removing it? I could do it myself, yes, as my Power Over All Of You is quite pervasive. However, I&apos;d rather everyone else cleaned up their own toys.</p><p>Sound OK? That way everyone can upload the first minute of their new 22tet pieces they did last week for Paul...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>ListMom</p></div>
