As it turned<br/>&gt; out, it was one of those rare moments when you hit existential<br/>&gt; paydirt; when you get to bring home a souvenir from the netherworld!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anybody know what a &quot;whint&quot; or a &quot;wint&quot; is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometime before the alarm went off, I had carelessly climbed over a<br/>&gt; fence at my grandmother&apos;s farm trampling down some electric fence wire<br/>&gt; and stuff in the process. This in turn promptly segued into me trying<br/>&gt; to fix a light on the porch of the house which I&apos;d also broke climbing<br/>&gt; the fence--ah, who needs the niceties of linear and logical narratives<br/>&gt; anyway!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I asked my grandmother if she happened to have any small nails,<br/>&gt; something like a 6d or so, and she said, &quot;you need a whint&quot;, and then<br/>&gt; the alarm told me that it was 5:45 AM. So I groggily trudged in the<br/>&gt; direction of its incessant nag with the dream lagging about, still<br/>&gt; fresh for the taking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve had a lot of dreams that have given me oddball knickknacks like<br/>&gt; super bizarre number formulas and specific musics that I&apos;ve never<br/>&gt; heard before, but I can seldom bring anything back intact. Once awake,<br/>&gt; the dissipation rate is astonishing. Its speed and efficiency never<br/>&gt; fail to surprise me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So while a whint (or a wint) may seem a rather underwhelming trifle in<br/>&gt; the cocksure sobriety of the ambulatory state, it&apos;s been my experience<br/>&gt; that the netherworld is pretty stingy when it comes to sharing<br/>&gt; specifics with the waking world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, what&apos;s a whint? Well, it seemed to be some name for a nail, and it<br/>&gt; seemed no more odd at the time than just that either. However, it was<br/>&gt; my grandmother, someone I share many profound affinities with, and she<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t say a nail--she said a whint, so I&apos;ll take my chances and<br/>&gt; assume she didn&apos;t mean a nail... Oh what a curious marvel the<br/>&gt; slumbering mind is, and what far-flung corners of nowhere I can find<br/>&gt; myself in!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
