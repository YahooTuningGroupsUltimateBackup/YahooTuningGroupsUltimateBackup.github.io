These<br/>were played and recorded using a pair of Soundman binaural earpiece<br/>microphones. Then the bowls were given a good &quot;seeing to&quot; using Composer&apos;s<br/>Desktop Project (CDP) software. CDP was developed by electroacoustic<br/>composer Trevor Wishart over many years with help from IRCAM and UK and<br/>American researchers. In particular the software allows you to manipulate<br/>the spectrum of the sound source and to carry out precise pitch<br/>manipulation.
