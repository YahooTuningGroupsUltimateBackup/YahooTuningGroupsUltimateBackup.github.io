There&apos;s lots of potential here, and I&apos;ve just<br/>scratched the surface!  Thanks, also, for the specific commentary...</p><p>Your idea of working with other timbres is a good one.

Well, actually in *this* particular<br/>piece I tried to stay *away* from sounds of traditional instruments,<br/>except for the trombone, which I needed in the &quot;demo&quot; version.</p><p>Perhaps I didn&apos;t succeed as much as I would have liked, then, in that<br/>department.  A while ago a friend of mine made the same<br/>criticism:  &quot;Why do you use that &apos;funky&apos; clarinet sound, etc., it<br/>sounds so hokey...&quot;</p><p>Frankly, when I was using sounds like that, I was just taking them<br/>as &quot;found objects...&quot;  I really wasn&apos;t thinking of a clarinet at all,<br/>but was just using the electronic sound as the &quot;thing in itself.&quot;<br/>(Germans have a fancy phrase for that that goes like &apos;das ding en<br/>sich&apos; or such like, even though that may seem a bit &quot;off color...&quot;)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well... this fellow convinced me that, *regardless* of what *I* would<br/>happen to think, *other* people would hear the sound as a damn<br/>clarinet... so I changed my mind about all of this.</p><p>Ultimately, the *best* solution would be to create my own patches, or<br/>at least to modify some...

Not only have you gotten a good handle on the multi-timbral aspects of your boxes, but you are getting pretty deep into Miracle (isn&apos;t that what it is on this piece?).</p><p>I was wary at the beginning (more about that in a moment) but really liked the pyramid-style organ chords/clusters around 2:00 or so, and I REALLY liked what happened at the end! You seemed to be summing up a journey at that point, with fragments of the theme bouncing around in shorter segments, and then the fast &apos;mallet&apos; part comes out of nowhere.</p><p>OK, so you&apos;re the composer, but I had a thought: at the end, you&apos;ve spun out the material in a variety of ways, and during the very last part it seems to be &apos;cycling&apos; in an interesting, kaleidoscopic way. And then... you end with the big smear downward (trb gliss?). Me, I think another small amount of time of that cycling material, with a gradual fade, as if the colored bits are endlessly changing-but-not-changing until you don&apos;t hear it anymore.</p><p>At least that&apos;s how it struck *me* - a bit too abrupt of an end, in this instance.</p><p>There seem to be a lot of people on the list(s) that use the 81z&apos;s and 802&apos;s - I&apos;d like to find a good way to share sysex patch dumps! As long as we are still somewhat limited in full-kbd tuneable synths, we can make the most (music) of these old boxes. For instance, the organ that is so prominent in the beginning, a suggestion: if you stick with this traditional organ patch, with the quick attack, I would go back and tweak the start times of the notes so that you&apos;ve got good attacks for the entire chord (some notes speak early or late); whether you want to straighten up, or semi-clean up the releases is more debatable. What *might* be nice is an &apos;organ&apos; patch that has just a slightly gentler attack, which not only might make the chord changes less abrupt (unless you want them that way) but tends to make it sound a little less &apos;synthy&apos; and a little more organic. Only the slightest edge off the attack could be musical, I think.</p><p>Then again, if you are going to have the bulk of this as the accompaniment tape for the soloist, you&apos;ll probably do some post-production on it, and I see you&apos;ve gotten some good offers on the list. Even if, as you&apos;ve mentioned before, that you want &quot;focused listening&quot; to the tuning, it is really asking for just a wee bit of air around the sounds, and I think a good engineer (even yourself, maybe, with Samplitude?) could add a bit of breath and sheen to the static sounds. You also should consider a volume control pedal, which is *so* easy to use - you can record your track, and then go back and just overlay the pedal to let the phrases ebb and flow a bit, rather than being somewhat mono-dynamic.</p><p>All that said - and, typically, I&apos;ve said too much! - you have a very good piece here, and what is left is refinement, not new composition or wholesale revamping.

Yes, it&apos;s Blackjack, which is the 21-<br/>variant of the Miracle tunings.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was wary at the beginning (more about that in a moment) but<br/>really liked the pyramid-style organ chords/clusters around 2:00</p><p>****I believe that&apos;s where I&apos;m playing with alterations of<br/>the &quot;smaller&apos; Blackjack inflection of 33 cents.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so you&apos;re the composer, but I had a thought: at the end, you&apos;ve<br/>spun  out the material in a variety of ways, and during the very last<br/>part it  seems to be &apos;cycling&apos; in an interesting, kaleidoscopic way.<br/>And then... you  end with the big smear downward (trb gliss?). Me, I<br/>think another small  amount of time of that cycling material, with a<br/>gradual fade, as if the  colored bits are endlessly changing-but-not-<br/>changing until you don&apos;t hear it anymore.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least that&apos;s how it struck *me* - a bit too abrupt of an end, in<br/>this instance.</p><p>****Thanks, Jon, for your observation.  In this case I wanted it to<br/>sound a bit like someone was &quot;pulling the plug&quot;... but I&apos;ll think<br/>about your alternative.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There seem to be a lot of people on the list(s) that use the 81z&apos;s<br/>and 802&apos;s</p><p>****Probably because these older boxes were actually *FULLY TUNABLE*<br/>yes??</p><p>- I&apos;d like to find a good way to share sysex patch dumps! As long as<br/>&gt; we are still somewhat limited in full-kbd tuneable synths, we can<br/>make the most (music) of these old boxes. For instance, the organ<br/>that is so prominent in the beginning, a suggestion: if you stick<br/>with this traditional organ patch, with the quick attack, I would go<br/>back and tweak the start times of the notes so that you&apos;ve got good<br/>attacks for the entire chord (some notes speak early or late);<br/>whether you want to straighten up, or semi-clean up the releases is<br/>more debatable. What *might* be nice is an &apos;organ&apos; patch that has<br/>just a slightly gentler attack, which not only might make the chord<br/>changes less abrupt (unless you want them that way) but tends to make<br/>it sound a little less &apos;synthy&apos; and a little more organic. Only the<br/>slightest edge off the attack could be musical, I think.</p><p>****Well, this is a valuable observation, Jon.  Actually I used that<br/>particular patch... 8-16-32 or something it&apos;s called (I&apos;m not at home<br/>at the moment) because it is the patch that has the *least* beating<br/>of anything on the TX81Z, so I was hoping to emphasize the Just<br/>Intonation that way...  I *did* clean up some attacks here and<br/>there.  Of course too much &quot;clensing&quot; might make things a<br/>bit &quot;mechanical&quot; sometimes, but it depends, surely.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then again, if you are going to have the bulk of this as the<br/>accompaniment  tape for the soloist, you&apos;ll probably do some post-<br/>production on it, and I see you&apos;ve gotten some good offers on the<br/>list. Even if, as you&apos;ve mentioned before, that you want &quot;focused<br/>listening&quot; to the tuning, it is really asking for just a wee bit of<br/>air around the sounds, and I think a good engineer (even yourself,<br/>maybe, with Samplitude?) could add a bit of breath and sheen to the<br/>static sounds.</p><p>****I think part of the problem with this, Jon, was that I really had<br/>a misconception of &quot;reverb.&quot;  I believe I was thinking more of &quot;In<br/>the Boom Boom Room...&quot;</p><p>It didn&apos;t occur to me that just a *very, tiny tiny* amount of reverb<br/>could really enhance matters... even just barely audible.  So I guess<br/>my approach to reverb is developing the more I work with it.</p><p>Certainly _Samplitude_ could do a lot in this direction, but I think<br/>there is even more that I can do with _Sound Forge_ now that I have a<br/>different &quot;conception&quot; of reverb...</p><p>You also should consider a volume control pedal, which is *so* easy<br/>to use - you can record your track, and  then go back and just<br/>overlay the pedal to let the phrases ebb and flow a  bit, rather than<br/>being somewhat mono-dynamic.</p><p>****This might be *very* valuable, but I&apos;ll have to figure out how to<br/>get it to work with the &apos;Z...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; All that said - and, typically, I&apos;ve said too much!</p><p>****Hardly.

I like it, and I like where you are going with<br/>the tunings: you&apos;ve not only found some wonderful chord progressions,<br/>but I just wish I could hear them on harmonic canons!</p><p>****Well, that would be fun, indeed, to write pieces for the Partch<br/>instruments like Elizabeth Brown and Muhal Richard Abrams (who lives<br/>in my building) did...

It may be that you could, alternately, program one of the sliders or knobs to send the volume controller (I believe it is controller #7) to do this in lieu of a foot pedal. If you want to inflect a line live (like a woodwind line, which seems more intuitive this way than with key pressure/touch) you can do it while playing; otherwise you can overlay the data on a second pass and not have to worry about playing the notes, but merely massaging the phrasing.</p><p>If this is an electronic piece, then all this tweaking is going to seriously affect your end result, as will experimenting with different patches.

I downloaded the demo and worked with it for about 30 minutes last night, very nice indeed, *especially* if one wants to mix midi and audio together.

Generally speaking, I&apos;ve been adjusting volume using &gt;different &quot;velocities.&quot;  Is that a common approach??</p><p>No, in a couple of ways. I don&apos;t know your sequencer, but most of them will let you at least alter the midi data like velocity, and at best will let you draw curves. But the &apos;velocity&apos; parameter refers to not volume but is a measure of the velocity of the keystroke, and while the volume of the sound is one component, lower and higher velocities are very frequently used to change the timbre of the sounds as well, just as a loud piano strike &apos;sounds&apos; different (it *is* different) than a soft piano strike.</p><p>The actual midi volume control message affects the literal volume of the output of that patch, so even if you had banged on the kbd FFF for ten bars, cause &apos;loud&apos; and bright sounds to come out, if you then go back in and slowly close down a volume control foot pedal (or slider) it will gradually diminuendo, still having the bright attack that came from the velocity.</p><p>I think.</p><p>In any event, it is a good way, *in addition to good use of touch on the kbd*, to add subtleness to the phrasing, and is (I think) paramount to take &apos;keyboardness&apos; out of string and woodwind parts in sequences.</p><p>There are add-on boxes that have sliders and midi outputs, but maybe you have - or someone else does - a spare midi synth or keyboard that *does* have a VC foot pedal input (it is a 1/4 inch mono jack just like the sustain pedal). You could simply put the midi cable onto that board if you wanted to go back and inflect; probably a dozen ways to get this done.</p><p>None of this is show-stopper, because you are obviously getting good work done. It&apos;s just the next logical (and musical) step.</p><p>&gt;Sometimes I&apos;ve had trouble when changing &quot;volume levels&quot; in a track.

I was *entirely* wrong!  It works like a charm!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Voyetra Digital Orchestrator Pro).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All I have to do is go back in there and draw curves!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you check the TX81Z programming manual, you&apos;ll find there are<br/>special  settings for dealing with (I think) breath control and<br/>aftertouch.  If  you&apos;re happy drawing things in, these are as easy to<br/>do as volume control.<br/>&gt;  One trick is to set the LFO to alter different FM oscillators<br/>differently  as you change the setting.  It&apos;s not something I&apos;ve<br/>played with, as I  don&apos;t have a breath controller, but I can see it<br/>as a great way to get the maximum expressivity out of the synthesizer.</p><p>****Thanks, Graham.  Actually, I *was* reading the manual over again,<br/>and I saw some of these options.  Altering the LFO can, of course,<br/>radically change the sound, particularly in the *pitch* domain, but<br/>maybe it can be set in a different way, according to the parameters<br/>you suggest.  I noticed right &quot;off the top&quot; that I could do some<br/>interesting &quot;pitch bend&quot; effects by &quot;drawing in&quot; so I&apos;ll probably try<br/>that as well...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I&apos;ve moved towards is getting the key velocity to control<br/>timbre rather than volume.  You can do this by turning down the<br/>velocity response for oscillator 1.  Then, you can play expressively<br/>from the keyboard and adjust the balance using a controller.</p><p>***Thanks, Graham.  Well, basically that&apos;s what I was doing *wrong*<br/>since I didn&apos;t know how to control volume other than by changing key<br/>velocity settings.</p><p>&gt; As far as sharing patches go, I&apos;ve had my standard bank available<br/>for a long time from &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/xx991203.zip">http://x31eq.com/xx991203.zip</a>&gt;.<br/>It&apos;s a MIDI file that resets all your user patches, so make sure<br/>you&apos;ve backed up first.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Thanks, Graham.
