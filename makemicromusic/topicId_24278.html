And rhythm typically<br/>sounds more confident than melody/harmony...unless said melody/harmony is very<br/>simple and effortless...so the easy path (especially among not-so-talented<br/>musicians) is lots of rhythm and little melody (IE lack of stress on tone is a<br/>symptom, not a cause).

I think people would subtly notice a difference. I<br/>don&apos;t think that people are really paying attention to that, though,<br/>when they&apos;re listening to deadmau5 mostly to dance.</p><p>On a related note, there&apos;s a lot of amazing rhythmic innovation going<br/>on these days as well. People are doing ridiculous things with<br/>polyrhythms, as well as deliberately introducing rhythmic error that&apos;s<br/>the same every bar (like the bass drum is slightly ahead of the beat<br/>every time it comes around). People are also doing I guess something<br/>similar to rhythmic tempering, and here&apos;s an example:</p><p>If you accent every third sixteenth note, and you&apos;re playing in 5/4,<br/>you get something that is only slightly faster than quarter note<br/>septuplets. That is, if the frequency of the bar is 1, then the<br/>frequency of each beat is 5, and the frequency of each sixteenth note<br/>is 20, then to accent every third 16th note would be a frequency of<br/>20/3. Meanwhile, septuplets would be a frequency of 7.</p><p>So people exploit similarities like this to temporarily &quot;transform&quot;<br/>the time feel into something completely different; at first they&apos;re<br/>playing something in 3 against 5 and suddenly you transform into the<br/>septuplet world where beats are flying left and right and wheels are<br/>spinning around you and then bam, you&apos;re back in on the 1. You would<br/>slightly drag the 7 so that the frequency of the bar doesn&apos;t change.<br/>So they&apos;re equating 20/3 and 7, which means they&apos;re tempering out<br/>21/20.</p><p>If you do this with too simple a rhythm, like if you screw up and<br/>equate quarter note triplets with sixteenth groups of 3, it doesn&apos;t<br/>sound &quot;cool,&quot; it just sounds sloppy and like you don&apos;t know what<br/>you&apos;re doing. This is because quarter note triplets would have a<br/>frequency of 6, and sixteenth groups of 3 would have a frequency of<br/>16/3, and to equate the two would be tempering out 16/15, and father<br/>temperament doesn&apos;t work too well for rhythms.</p><p>There&apos;s also a lot of rhythmic innovations that I&apos;m not sure have a<br/>specific microtonal correlation, like turning sixteenth note groups of<br/>3 into the new &quot;time feel&quot; temporarily by playing a faux-backbeat over<br/>it; this tempts your brain to think the tempo has switched, but if you<br/>continue to explore the space between the two times, you can get your<br/>brain to think that there are two harmonically related tempos<br/>occurring simultaneously. Tony Williams and Vinnie Colaiuta pioneered<br/>this but they&apos;re taking it to a whole new levels these days.</p><p>Anyway, this is off topic, but thought it was interesting enough to share... :)</p><p>&gt; The 17-EDO piece sounds more concordant than either of those. The 22-EDO piece sounds like rubbish; too bad he didn&apos;t know about Pajara[10]. The 19-EDO piece occasionally lapses into some rather jarring passages whenever it slips out of 5-limit harmony.

I actually like his<br/>14-EDO piece a lot, but think it would have sounded cleaner if he<br/>hadn&apos;t put so many dense closed voicings in the lower register.

It&apos;s that all tunings can sound likable, if given the right touch. &quot;Smooth and harmonious&quot; is only good for so much, especially when 12-tET is smooth and harmonious *enough* for the great masses of Western ears. It&apos;s not hard to achieve that level of smoothness with a lot of different tunings.</p><p>Then I suppose my modus operandi at this point is to theoretically<br/>formalize what it is that you&apos;re doing, at least until I get my own<br/>synths set up. &gt;:|</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2011 12:17:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The most popular form of music in the world in the past 20 years<br/>has been hip-hop.

I really think we all get a  bit carried<br/>away with the whole &quot;emancipation of pitch&quot; thing--it does  not make the &quot;worlds<br/>of difference&quot; it is often claimed to!&quot;</p><p>    Agreed!  Usually when I either make a tuning that &quot;works&quot; or pick a subset<br/>of tones from any tuning (including terrible ones) that works, it sounds at<br/>least 65-70% like 12TET (IE far as diatonic feel).  Intervals like 11/6, 11/7,<br/>13/8, and 7/6 do sound to me very uniquely different than 12TET...but most dyads<br/>I&apos;ve found end up sounding a lot more like variations on 12TET, even if that<br/>means &quot;notes that can swap between sounding major and minor&quot;, than their own<br/>identities.  Especially in that latter case, microtonallity seems to focus on<br/>giving more options to the composer despite sounding often similar to the<br/>listener: it&apos;s like being able to program a computer with C#.net instead of the<br/>old Visual Basic 6 language: same looking result, more ways to get there.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The 17-EDO piece sounds more concordant than either of those.  &quot;<br/>    Agreed!  I&apos;m beginning to wonder why 17TET hasn&apos;t gained more<br/>traction...particularly on things like guitars.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Is &quot;smooth and harmonious&quot; all there is to music?  There is a place for  it,<br/>&gt;and there is a place for dissonance, and there is a place for  everything in<br/>&gt;between.&quot;</p><p>     I&apos;ve always thought that music is a balancing act...like building a bridge<br/>where the supports at the end are consonance and the parts in between are<br/>dissonance.  Dissonance adds the variety, but consonance keeps it all steady and<br/>standing.  Thus, I think an ideal way to compose involves both...but the common<br/>problem becomes having &quot;too heavy a bridge for the supports&quot; IE too many<br/>dissonance options per consonant option.  You can, of course, take a bad tuning<br/>and use fewer notes or fewer combinations of notes to &quot;take weight off the<br/>bridge&quot; and balance it...but then you are often left with less options as a<br/>composer, although often also a rather unique mood.  Yes, you can do moods in<br/>odd-&quot;disharmonious&quot; TET scales you can&apos;t in &quot;normal&quot; scales...but the options<br/>that sound &quot;stable&quot; in such scales are often far and few between: by simply<br/>choosing such &quot;bad&quot; scales...you often define most of the mood of your song<br/>leaving little room for deviation from said mood.  And thus, if you want to<br/>write many different moods in songs you&apos;d need many different tunings if they<br/>are all &quot;bad&quot; tunings...but often only one of two if you are using &quot;good&quot;<br/>tunings.</p><p>&gt;&quot;&quot;Smooth and harmonious&quot; is only good for so much, especially when  12-tET is<br/>&gt;smooth and harmonious *enough* for the great masses of Western  ears.&quot;<br/>   12TET as smooth and harmonious enough for most (IE untrained) ears, yes.<br/>Fresh...not really.  I think that&apos;s another reason composers are leaning<br/>increasingly toward texture and rhythm rather than melodies (especially in<br/>electronica)...a majority of the options so far as chord progressions and<br/>melodies in 12TET have already been done, so they aim for originality in<br/>rhythm/phrasing/effects...of their music rather than original melodies: in fact<br/>it&apos;s most often rhythm, not melody and harmony, that separates genres (minus<br/>things like blues and country where simple chord progressions are by and large<br/>pre-defined for the genres).  Perhaps we can help change that... :-)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2011 9:11:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;So people exploit similarities like this to temporarily &quot;transform&quot; the<br/>time feel into something completely different; at first they&apos;re playing<br/>something in 3 against 5 and suddenly you transform into the<br/>septuplet world where beats are flying left and right and wheels are spinning<br/>around you and then bam, you&apos;re back in on the 1.&quot;</p><p>   Right, so they &quot;intersect&quot; at beat 15 (3*5)...if I follow what you are<br/>saying?</p><p>  One of my favorite beat tricks is to constantly alternate gaps of all drums<br/>for a fairly long duration.

It&apos;s a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when<br/>you play a JI chord - you might hear a periodic amplitude fluctuation<br/>or &quot;buzzing&quot; somewhere along the upper register of the chord. It<br/>happens most intensely when the chords are tuned precisely in JI, with<br/>harmonic ratios, with no tempering; however, as Carl pointed out, it<br/>also happens with sines too.</p><p>Let&apos;s take 8:9:10:11:12.</p><p>So start with 8:10 by itself, which is 2:3.

I&apos;ve compared 17 and 19 extensively in diatonic frameworks, and while 19-EDO sounds significantly better dyadically, there is an odd sort of coherence in 17-EDO played triadically or tetradically that I find lacking in 19-EDO.  I can&apos;t put my finger on what it could be, though, but I&apos;ve done randomized listening tests on myself of 7th chords ascending the major scale (with a piano timbre) in 12, 17, 19, 22, 26, and 27-EDO and found both 17 and 19 to be sweeter than any of the others--but for very different reasons.  Classical music (especially guitar music) in 17-EDO never sounds wrong, sour, or off to me, despite the fact that it looks like it should, whereas in 19-EDO there is something that always feels a little &quot;weird&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Yes, the 19-tone etude (and don&apos;t forget the Fanfare) have<br/>&gt; contrast.  That&apos;s because there&apos;s something to contrast against.</p><p>As someone who&apos;s played extensively in both ETs, I really think there&apos;s as much contrast in 17 as in 19.  It&apos;s a very different sort of contrast, yes indeedy, and all told I do like 19 quite a bit more than 17 (mostly because I&apos;m rather averse to neutral chords and find the 19-EDO 5-limit chords *more* xenharmonic than the chords in 17-EDO), but to say that 17-EDO lacks contrast is really dead wrong.</p><p>&gt; That was Paul&apos;s assessment but I strongly disagree.  I love<br/>&gt; the piece but even if you hate it, that the chords are consonant<br/>&gt; is undeniable.</p><p>I still say: no more consonant than in the 17-EDO piece.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Or go ahead and write a basic SATB ditty in 11-ET, that sounds<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as smooth or harmonious as one in 19.  I double DOG dare you.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Is any of this really open for debate?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Is &quot;smooth and harmonious&quot; all there is to music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course not.
