Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2001 6:15:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Prologue<br/>--------</p><p>Hi.</p><p>A list must start somehow, mustn&apos;t it? So here are two stories that are really just one...</p><p>Story #1<br/>--------</p><p>Many years ago I started writing, performing, and recording music for dance. I had the good fortune to work with some talented dancers/choreographers while with the Harry Partch Ensemble, and it seemed like an interesting way to do music. And, most of the time, it was.</p><p>I worked most frequently with Patricia Sandback, and one of the works she commissioned was a dance entitled &quot;Stain&quot;. Best I can track, this would be around 1983 or so. Before software-based sequencers, heck, before the PC (for me, at least). And microtonality? For me, it was what I could make, the microtones in my percussion arsenal, and my trusty Sequential Circuits Prophet 5. I am not shy to say that I *didn&apos;t* do a lot of non-12-tET, but simply focused on making music.</p><p>&quot;Stain&quot; was a three-part work; some day I&apos;ll share a section of the first part, where I tuned chords on the Pro5 to match harmonics in three gongs, and recorded on separate tracks. But the end section is one of my rare dabbles off the piano-scale, and involves truly era-specific lo-tech: all done with a TEAC 4-track; the &apos;dumbek&apos; sound is a water jug recorded at half-speed, and when the drum machine part (an old Emu Drumulator) and jug were run through a ring modulator it was tuned in the scale I used; the Pro5 was slightly altered from 12, but the main micro stuff was a &apos;vocal&apos; line that used two patches and all micro-intervals were &apos;done&apos; in realtime with the pitch wheel.</p><p>The dance ended in a similar manner to Salome&apos;s famous dance of ripping-off-the-veils, with a real whirling dervish finish. IOW, accelerando and crazy.</p><p>Story #2<br/>--------</p><p>When I first went online in 1995 to do Partch work, I quickly found a few individuals of inspiration. One was a young woman who was a wonderful raconteur/story-teller, who occasionally wrote little, odd fables. One night I was taken by a quirky post:</p><p>No one knows<br/>how the knives<br/>were introduced<br/>into the dance</p><p>That led to a story, and while reading it I was reminded of the music I had written over a decade earlier. At the time I was also honing my web design skills, and so I combined her story with both an allegorical myth and the fragment of my music. It went in a little, personal corner of my site, where it still sits today:</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/bandi/knife.html">http://www.corporeal.com/bandi/knife.html</a></p><p>At the top of the story &quot;The Knife Dancers&quot; you will find a link to the original fable (a good, twisted read) and at the bottom you will find a link to a RealAudio file. If more than one or two people aren&apos;t RA enabled, I&apos;ll upload an .mp3 to the files section here...</p><p>Epilogue<br/>--------</p><p>Yes, I do still write music (but mostly I&apos;m a performer). Microtonal? Not always, not often, but that will be changing, and this list is, to be honest, partly selfish! But to prove that I have bent a pitch in my time, that I actually have *made* music, I am finally overcoming fear of juvenilia and offer those of you who have wondered just one sliver of my output - don&apos;t hold it against me, and certainly not against the new baby on the block, Creating Microtonal Music.</p><p>I sure am glad to be here. I hope you will be, too.</p><p>Creatively,<br/>Jon (the List-Mom)</p></div><h3><a id=13 href="#13">ðŸ”—</a>Jim Cole &#x3C;jimcole@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2001 10:17:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Jon and All,</p><p>Thank you very much for creating this list Jon (and Margo and Jacky<br/>too!!!) and for all the wise patient constructive efforts along the<br/>way towards its genesis.  The atmosphere seems ripe here for some<br/>high quality communication and exchange of ideas.  I mostly have<br/>lurked on the other lists, wanting to keep in touch with these tuning<br/>communities because I&apos;m fascinated by these areas of music, &quot;lurking<br/>mostly&quot; because so far I&apos;ve not understood very much within the posts<br/>(theory AND actual sounds of various scales/music created from them)<br/>to comment intelligently.  I hope to learn much more...</p><p>My passion is harmonic singing, and while I am very interested in<br/>microtonal music made by whatever means, right now I am keen to<br/>experience alternate tunings through vocal production - to train my<br/>voice to sing different scales and intervals accurately.  I&apos;ve worked<br/>with guitar and tamboura using open strings and harmonics to tune to<br/>lower limit JI&apos;s, but now I&apos;m eager to experience and practice a wide<br/>range of tunings, first to experiment and feel them, then -<br/>hopefully - to make music through some of them.</p><p>The question is:</p><p>What are some ways that I can train my voice to sing (with the<br/>fundamentals) these tunings/scales?  I&apos;m thinking something like a<br/>tunable keyboard or some software with home computer to generate/tune<br/>them up so I can &quot;follow along&quot; with voice.  I basically would like<br/>to have a ready source of reference tones in the moment to compare my<br/>voice with that can be retuned to another set fairly quickly/easily.<br/>I&apos;m not even sure which tunings I want to start with.  There were<br/>posts recently on one of the lists about various feeling-states<br/>evoked with different EDO&apos;s that caught my fancy - so did miracle<br/>scales, higher limit JI&apos;s etc.  The lower cost/tech the solution, the<br/>better in my case - I don&apos;t have a lot of $$$ to use and I&apos;m fairly<br/>limited (so far!) technical-wise.</p><p>Thanks to any and all help,</p><p>~jim cole</p><p><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=16 href="#16">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2001 2:22:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jim Cole&quot; &lt;jimcole@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What are some ways that I can train my voice to sing (with the<br/>&gt; fundamentals) these tunings/scales?

I use Robert<br/>Walkers Fractal Tune Smithy on a laptop (PC only) open my list of<br/>scales from scala, and simply play the tuning I pick on the laptop<br/>keyboard.  Its great for singing cause you don&apos;t need any other<br/>equipment and its highly portable.  Then you can just explore and<br/>hear what you like - and what&apos;s relatively easy to sing.  I use it<br/>for singing even when I&apos;m using midi programs written in LISP on the<br/>Mac and record it all into ProTools because  its foolproof - it<br/>always works without a whole lot of diddling with midi channels and<br/>ids and studio setups and such.</p><p>When I&apos;m traveling I use these little harman/kardon speakers  that<br/>are really light , the built in midid in my dell and I&apos;m a happy<br/>camper.  You could easily duplicate this setup for under a grand.</p><p>There are midi relay programs on the Mac side if that is your<br/>preference, and I own most of them but use primarily FTS.  Its like a<br/>Swiss Army Knife of microtuning :-)</p><p>I also sing to your CD&apos;s quite regularly hoping that someday my false<br/>vocal chords strengthen.</p><p>Also John Starret recently posted the mp3 site of a great Indian<br/>female vocalist.  I bought her CD and am getting a lot out of it.</p><p>Hope this is helpful.</p><p>Mary<br/><a href="http://www.elucida.com">http://www.elucida.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=45 href="#45">ðŸ”—</a>Jim Cole &#x3C;jimcole@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 2:03:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Mary and Paul for your help - I will get in touch with<br/>Robert about his Fractal Tune Smithy program.</p><p>(Mary:)<br/>&gt; My passion is also singing and here&apos;s what I do.
