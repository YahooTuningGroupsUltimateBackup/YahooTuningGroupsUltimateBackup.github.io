This book came across to me as authentic and<br/>&gt; well researched. There were only a few instances where it seemed like the<br/>&gt; author made comments that stemmed from hindsight or a biased perspective.<br/>&gt; This book really got me excited about Partch; I have yet to hear much of<br/>&gt; his work. I certainly feel that this book bridges the gap for me and will<br/>&gt; allow me to approach Genesis of a Music eventually.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
