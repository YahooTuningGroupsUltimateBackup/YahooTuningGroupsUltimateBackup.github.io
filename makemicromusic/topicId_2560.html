Once i get into &quot;thirds&quot; above the treble clef for example! With<br/>the 1-3-7-9-11-15 vibraphone i used to play mary had a little lamb all in<br/>difference tones with really strange combinations. With low pitches, the<br/>result becomes rhythms. I finally have the full 12 pitches of my slendro,<br/>hope to take it up to an octave and a fourth or fifth,</p><p>jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; KG:<br/>&gt; &gt; I do quite a bit of work with difference tones and notice that<br/>&gt; range has a lot to do with this.

Doesn&apos;t this have<br/>&gt; allot to do with volume too? I can sure hear something going with Mt.<br/>&gt; Meru in this regard!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
