Jacob Barton&apos;s<br/>contribution reminds me of something I&apos;d do if I had two grand<br/>pianos at right angles...  Graham&apos;s piece really surprised me.<br/>Graham, if this is a one-off, I&apos;d love to hear a two-off.  Or<br/>even just another one-off.  But the biggest surprise for me was<br/>Jon Szanto&apos;s piece.  Jon, similar comments as for Graham apply.<br/>Dzam!  This is much more than &quot;Do Something&quot;.  I think it&apos;s one<br/>of my favorite parts of the compilation.  You rock glitch beats<br/>like a 20-year-old from LA!  It was great to hear the rest of<br/>Rick&apos;s symphony.  Who knew he could orchestrate like that?</p><p>There&apos;s so much talent here.  And, comparing this to the tape<br/>swap or even the Tuning List CD, it&apos;s immediately obvious how<br/>far music has come.  The timbres and sounds heard in this<br/>compilation were simply unimaginable in 1997.  And the<br/>instruments are so much more flexible when it comes to retuning.<br/>Bravo to the digital realm, and to sticking with it.  Here&apos;s<br/>to another 9 years!</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/music/MMMDayMixup.mp3">http://lumma.org/music/MMMDayMixup.mp3</a><br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_12886.html#12886">/makemicromusic/topicId_12886.html#12886</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=12902 href="#12902">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2006 4:17:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

It&apos;s a one off using instruments I&apos;ve prepared for a suite of 5 simple pieces.
