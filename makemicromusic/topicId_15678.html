To make things clear, I am on the tuning lists to chat about tuning, music, and related issues...and that&apos;s all I&apos;m here for. If I happen to strike up a personal friendship with someone in the process, that&apos;s a bonus, and I have indeed met some wonderful folks here, and I&apos;m grateful for that. On the other hand, occasionally someone will take issue with something I&apos;ve said about tuning or music, and rather than stay on the subject at hand, they tend to cross a line, and make it into something more personal...and THAT I will not tolerate, in any way, shape, or fashion.</p><p>   I have very strong feelings about my privacy and personal relationships...for example, if I should ever say something about someone in a personal way, call them a name or whatever, then by all means, they have a right to be angry and let me know about it, I can accept that. But, when I am just talking about music/tuning, and they choose to go beyond the subject, and start commenting on my personal character because they see some sort of need in themselves to do that, again, that is NOT why I am here.</p><p>   A couple of weeks ago, a gentleman on the forum sent me a personal email about something I said on the list...but, I felt he stepped over the line, and started interfering in my personal life, and I told him so. Well, Daniel Wolf, I believe, is on the verge of doing the same sort of thing, and I want it to stop now. Mr. Wolf, I saw your post in my box today, but I did not open it. In light of your post here a couple of days ago, which was not very friendly, I was not interested in letting you into my home in that fashion. If you have something to say to me about tuning/music, by all means, say it...but, do it here. Let me say that, at my advanced age, I am not interested in wasting my time on meaningless debates/arguments...I consider every minute of my time precious at this stage of my life, and I have pretty much weeded most of the people out of my life that I don&apos;t want to deal with. I also realize that, when someone is chatting on a forum such as this, that they are not in control of everyone else, and there may well be people here who I would never care to meet in real life...again, no problem.</p><p>   Out side of music, I have other passionate interests, and one is martial arts. I studied for many years with some heavyweight maestros, some of who are still close personal friends. And, one important lesson I learned was respect for others. These teachers were unfailingly polite and peaceful with others, and most of the time you would never have guessed they were such dangerous people. But, if you chose to insult them, especially for no good reason, there&apos;s a good chance you would be in some serious trouble. There are people on this (and I am sure other) list who seem to delight in occasionally starting a ruckus for no good reason, and I certainly can&apos;t stop them. But, I can say that I don&apos;t want them in my life, and I don&apos;t want them posting me at home...it&apos;s no different than if they came to my front door, and started dissing me. I have a saying...the aggressor is always wrong. And, we all have a right to defend ourselves against unwanted aggression. If someone opens the door to a conflict, then they shouldn&apos;t be surprised if the person they are dissing gets pissed, and throws it back at them.</p><p>   Anyway, as I said, I shouldn&apos;t have had to write this. But, over the years on these forums, I&apos;ve seen folks say things that were totally inappropriate to others...and I think that needs to stop. Since it&apos;s happened to me twice now in a couple of weeks, I&apos;m here to say: keep your comments to music and tuning, don&apos;t call names, and don&apos;t post me personally unless you come with friendship in your heart. And don&apos;t read stuff into my posts that isn&apos;t there. I am not interested in whatever personal issues anyone here has. If you don&apos;t like me personally, no biggie, I don&apos;t expect everybody to. But,<br/>we don&apos;t have to air our personal views to others, especially on a forum such as this...and, this should be the last time I have to talk about this...I&apos;d rather discuss tuning and music...best...Hstick</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=15680 href="#15680">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2007 9:13:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>We&apos;ve got your back.

If he chooses not to read that message, fine,<br/>but I wish to make it clear that I was not saying anything unfair,<br/>but pleading for a bit more measure on his part. I won&apos;t waste<br/>bandwidth with the whole thing, but here&apos;s the sum of it:</p><p>*****</p><p>Neil wrote:</p><p>&quot;I thought I would share my thoughts on that subject...which is<br/>exactly what I did. And, I do, indeed, hope everyone here who makes<br/>music, or talks about the theory involved, will try and do their best<br/>to do what they do with a great deal of soul...why not?&quot;</p><p>I answered:</p><p>Why not make a simple act of goodwill and assume that those on this<br/>list are doing precisely that?</p><p>******</p><p>A final comment, and this is personal:</p><p>Everyone I have encountered in this community appears to have a deep<br/>a serious committment to making music in one way or another, and<br/>there are many paths towards that end.  Some like to work<br/>intuitively, others look deep into the toolbox of music theory, some<br/>are highly experienced, others are just beginners, some compose or<br/>improvise generating hours and hours of music, others work for hours<br/>and hours and end up keeping only minutes or even seconds of their<br/>work, some concentrate on a single tuning, others have voracious<br/>appetites for ever new tuning adventures.  Not one of these paths<br/>guarantees either success or failure, even if one of us could come up<br/>with a definition of success of failure that anyone else would agree<br/>upon.  We all come to the alternative tuning community with our own<br/>ears, our own musical autobiographies, our own tastes and<br/>preferences, and the likelihood of finding agreement on aesthetic<br/>matters is mighty small. If we get into the business of aesthetic<br/>critiques here, I guarantee that we will inevitably have bad<br/>feelings. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s in anyone&apos;s soul, or if they even<br/>possess such a thing, and I don&apos;t particularly want to know in a<br/>context like this: that would breach an intimate sphere that deserves<br/>better than ascii-coded words. But a forum like this is a perfect<br/>place for talking about the nuts and bolts of music-making -- finding<br/>pitches, mapping routes among them, and figuring out how to get<br/>voices, instruments, machines, to make them sound. Talking about<br/>those nuts and bolts is a long, hard, struggle with words and<br/>numbers, all of them provisional, but it is a sign of deep respect<br/>and engagement for our common interest, and that should be<br/>acknowledged.</p><p>Some years back, I was playing in the gamelan accompanying an all-<br/>night shadow play, high up in the mountains in Wonosari, in Java. It<br/>started suddenly to rain, and my row of instruments was on the ground<br/>without a roof. Soon I was squatting cross-legged and waiste-deep in<br/>a flood of muddy water, struggling to hold onto my mallet, a lone six-<br/>foot-floor blonde yankee on the wrong side of the planet, playing the<br/>accompaniment to a battle between the leather figures of a noble hero<br/>and demon. One voice in my head said: &quot;What the hell am I doing<br/>here?&quot; Another answered quickly: &quot;Is there any place on earth you&apos;d<br/>rather be?&quot;</p><p>We all carry on a balancing act between the rational and something<br/>very much other than the rational, and you never know what your<br/>potential will be to go to extremes in one direction or the other,<br/>but that potential is always with us, every one of us.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=15684 href="#15684">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2007 10:39:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I have a saying...the aggressor is always wrong.</p><p>In practice, the problem with this is that deciding<br/>who is the aggressor often leads to fighting.</p><p>&gt;But, if you chose to insult them, especially for no<br/>&gt;good reason, there&apos;s a good chance you would be in<br/>&gt;some serious trouble.</p><p>Sounds like a recipe for fighting.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15685 href="#15685">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2007 11:41:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i am going to put two more cents into this situation.

I love and respect the persons and music of<br/> Neil, Kraig, etc., everybody here who would talk about music in terms<br/>of soul, etc.---but really I find discussions about &apos;soul&apos; in music<br/>distracting. I guess I think the best things about music and great<br/>music in particular don&apos;t need or deserve labels. That said, it is<br/>sometimes fun trying, so carry on. But I just thought I&apos;d share this<br/>personal note:</p><p>I&apos;m not a believer in metaphysics. Or religion. Or spirituality in its<br/>various New Age incarnations. And I don&apos;t believe in the human soul.<br/>Or any &apos;soul&apos;...what is it? That said, I am open to being wrong. The<br/>truth is, I find the idea of the existence of the &apos;soul&apos; kind of<br/>aesthetically unappealing. Not only does it not ring true for me when<br/>I look into the nature of things, I don&apos;t even find it beautiful to<br/>*want* thing to be that way.</p><p>But, I don&apos;t think any of us knows the truest bottom nature of reality<br/>to say. However, I think love, passion, depth, etc. are all possible<br/>without a &apos;spirit&apos; or &apos;soul&apos;, whatever they mean. The &apos;soul&apos; camp<br/>insists that none of these things are possible without &apos;soul&apos;, but to<br/>me, that&apos;s like saying ethics is not possible without &apos;God&apos;, it&apos;s<br/>utter nonsense. To me, the basic story of the physics and reality of<br/>the evolution of the universe and the beings within it are a powerful<br/>enough &apos;myth&apos; for me. I mean, watching a documentary like<br/>&apos;Microcosmos&apos; and seeing how insects have this little universe and<br/>society going on is more a trip for me than any typical way people<br/>connect to the &apos;One&apos;. This is not a swipe at those who get their<br/>groove on going to Church or sitting and touching crystals or going to<br/>Mosques or Temples or Ashrams or whatever, but I *am* saying I don&apos;t<br/>think I&apos;ll ever understand *that* way of thinking, ever. In fact, it<br/>gets more alien to me all the time.</p><p>Also, I think I at the same time have *some* understanding of what<br/>Neil means by &apos;soul&apos;. I definately have had moving experiences of<br/>music that defy intellect and tap into a very real primal place. So, I<br/>feel like I am in the middle camp, and I wonder why we have to split<br/>so much between brain hemisphere points-of-view. I like intuition<br/>*and* I like intellect. I am not convinced yet by any side that argues<br/>only for on or the other.</p><p>Anyway, my two cents. BTW, Kraig---I&apos;m glad you mentioned Xenakis,<br/>esp. &apos;Legende d&apos;Er&apos;. One of my favorite pieces, and Xenakis is an<br/>example of an apparantly intellectual composer, if you believe the<br/>press, and it&apos;s somewhat justified to label him that way, given the<br/>mathematical, highly rational descriptions he gives for his<br/>compositional processes; however for me, his music hits a very primal<br/>space in me---I mean a really beautiful, ancient feeling wells up in<br/>me hearing that piece. So I think that there *is* a space where the<br/>division between heart and head doesn&apos;t matter....</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i am going to put two more cents into this situation.

In fact, it<br/>&gt; gets more alien to me all the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I think I at the same time have *some* understanding of what<br/>&gt; Neil means by &apos;soul&apos;. I definately have had moving experiences of<br/>&gt; music that defy intellect and tap into a very real primal place. So, I<br/>&gt; feel like I am in the middle camp, and I wonder why we have to split<br/>&gt; so much between brain hemisphere points-of-view. I like intuition<br/>&gt; *and* I like intellect. I am not convinced yet by any side that argues<br/>&gt; only for on or the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, my two cents. BTW, Kraig---I&apos;m glad you mentioned Xenakis,<br/>&gt; esp. &apos;Legende d&apos;Er&apos;. One of my favorite pieces, and Xenakis is an<br/>&gt; example of an apparantly intellectual composer, if you believe the<br/>&gt; press, and it&apos;s somewhat justified to label him that way, given the<br/>&gt; mathematical, highly rational descriptions he gives for his<br/>&gt; compositional processes; however for me, his music hits a very primal<br/>&gt; space in me---I mean a really beautiful, ancient feeling wells up in<br/>&gt; me hearing that piece. So I think that there *is* a space where the<br/>&gt; division between heart and head doesn&apos;t matter....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Aaron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; i am going to put two more cents into this situation. One is that i<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; took &gt;   &gt;&gt; Daniel post as defending in part all those works that are not easily &gt;&gt; comprehensible, although often is so by it creators.<br/>&gt;&gt;  I like wise find allot a music soulless.<br/>&gt;&gt;  But this includes allot of blues artist as well, and have to admit , &gt;&gt; personally the genre produces much in the way of enlightenment to<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; myself &gt;   &gt;&gt; at all.<br/>&gt;&gt;  In high School i would play nothing else, and was a formable step<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; in my &gt;   &gt;&gt; development. I was downright obsessive with it<br/>&gt;&gt;   Much work which i found useless in my youth i no find some of my &gt;&gt; favorites and speak to my soul while other wells seem to have gone dry.<br/>&gt;&gt;  Unlike the spirit which is impersonal and universal , the soul is by &gt;&gt; its very nature personal and subjective and lives so much in our own &gt;&gt; valleys of existence.<br/>&gt;&gt;  The soul is allot more than just living through ones depression or &gt;&gt; hardship.<br/>&gt;&gt;  It is often say an expression of say, of fearlessness to go where &gt;&gt; others fail to touch upon. Bartok is a good example of this and &gt;&gt; personally i find Xenakis in this corner, although i am sure there are &gt;&gt; those that might be bewildered by such a work as &apos;La legende d&apos;Eear&apos;.<br/>&gt;&gt;  My life is far removed from say Robert Johnson&apos;s and only by a &gt;&gt; dishonesty to myself could i find my self saying the same things as<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; him. &gt;   &gt;&gt; I seriously doubt , if alive today he would have little use of the<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; forms &gt;   &gt;&gt; he did 100 years ago.<br/>&gt;&gt;  I find Zappa soulless, as &apos;progressive&apos; as he is.<br/>&gt;&gt;  I have no idea who he really is and was from his music, he seems to &gt;&gt; hide among his own pseudo-outlandishness which strike me as either &gt;&gt; obvious or shallow.<br/>&gt;&gt; at best acrobatic . Stevie Ray Vaughn and Winston Marsalis are even &gt;&gt; lower on the totem pole.<br/>&gt;&gt;  All to illustrate how subjective soul is and am glad there are people &gt;&gt; out there that can find some use in it.<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt; -- &gt;&gt; Kraig Grady<br/>&gt;&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt;&gt; KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
