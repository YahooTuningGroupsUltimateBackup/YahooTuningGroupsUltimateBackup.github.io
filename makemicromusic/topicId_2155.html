It was titled &quot;Rational Music for an<br/>Irrational World&quot;, and there were a number of cool pieces<br/>that let me know I wasnt alone in my love of alternately tuned<br/>music... My contribution to the cassette was called<br/>&apos;Joyous Day&apos;, and here&apos;s what I wrote about the song at the time.</p><p>****************</p><p>Ann and I were in the Hari Krishna restaurant in La Paz<br/>(about the only vegetarian food you can find anywhere in<br/>Bolivia) and a tape was playing &quot;new age&quot; versions<br/>of the traditional hari krishna chant. You can probably imagine<br/>it... hari krishna, hari hari, hari rama, krishna krishna...<br/>interspersed with soft electric guitar solos, synthesized<br/>bells, and arpeggiated organs. I thought it might be fun<br/>to imitate this style, but I worried that it might be<br/>insulting to steal the lyrics - so I made up my own<br/>traditional chant. Maybe someday I&apos;ll get around to<br/>making up a religion to go along with the chant.</p><p>********************</p><p>The music uses a just intonation created by Lou Harrison for his<br/>&apos;Joyous Procession&apos;, which focuses on the ratios</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 3/2 15/8 2/1</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
