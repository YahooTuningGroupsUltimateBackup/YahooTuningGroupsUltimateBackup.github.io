The beauty of their song and<br/>&gt; playing<br/>&gt; was of exquisite beauty.</p><p>Jacky &amp; Gerry,</p><p>There is no region with a greater variety of harps than<br/>Africa. They are played in more than fifty separate<br/>cultures, each with its own separate musical style.</p><p>Jacky, if you could describe the harps you saw I might<br/>be able to tell you their names.</p><p>Here are some possibilities:</p><p>1) ardin, Mauritania<br/>2) ennagna, Uganda</p><p> -- both these are &apos;spoon in a cup&apos; designs. A long<br/>stick coming into a bowl with a skin across it. A cross<br/>bar attaches to the long stick and goes across the<br/>bowl. Looks a bit like a sailboat, with the strings as<br/>the sail coming down from the long stick (neck or mast<br/>I suppose) and attacking to the short cross stick (the<br/>boom! :-) ). Tuning pegs on the mast.</p><p>3) simbingo, Gambia - spike harp design</p><p>-- think banjo in terms of a hoop with a skin and a<br/>neck. But the neck is a bit curved and the strings<br/>attack to a vertical string holder that comes sticking<br/>straight out of the neck through the center of the skin<br/>of the hoop.</p><p>I think its probably #2 above you saw; if not<br/>describe and I&apos;ll have more possibilities; I can<br/>further describe:</p><p>4) tang, Sierra Leone, shiplike design<br/>5) kori, C&ocirc;te d&apos;Ivoire<br/>6) kora, Gambia<br/>7) kinde, Lake Chad Area - cork in a bottle design<br/>8) ngombi, Gabon &amp; Central African Republic - shelf<br/>design<br/>9) seperewa, Ghana</p><p>---</p><p>We recently mentioned the aspects of spiritual<br/>experience that musical instruments represent.<br/>No more active examples can be found than in Africa.<br/>Harps are used to communicate with the gods, to<br/>represent aspects of the gods personalities, and<br/>to represent aspects of metaphysical experience.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1773 href="#1773">ðŸ”—</a>jacky_ligon &#x3C;jacky_ligon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2002 9:29:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;X.

Have you ever tried to make a harp? I&apos;d like to try<br/>my hand at it actually. A little known fact about your Brother here,<br/>is that I&apos;ve got some pretty good carpentry skills, and access to the<br/>whole range of woodworking tools it would take to make it happen.</p><p>I want to try to grow some gourds this year too for this purpose.</p><p>J:L</p></div>
