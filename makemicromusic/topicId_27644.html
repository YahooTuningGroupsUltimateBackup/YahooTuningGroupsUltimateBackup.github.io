And, those peasant melodies/rhythms became the backbone of his style, of course. He always spoke very highly of the depth and vitality of folk music...sorta reminds me of the statement by Sam Phillips I posted a while back...when he first heard Howlin Wolf, he said &quot;This is where the soul of man never dies.&quot; I believe Bartok would understand that attitude 100%. Blues is one of the folk musics of America, and it still has a lot of places it can go.</p><p>   Many European classical composers drew on folk melodies/rhythms, from Debussy to Grainger to Stravinsky...nothing unusual there. After all, music is about the expression of the human condition...at the end of a song, all I care about is what it made me feel; did the artist communicate something of depth, or no? It doesn&apos;t matter whether or not it&apos;s a cat with one guitar, or an 80 piece orchestra. The ability to write a symphonic work is indeed a great gift...but, the real issue is, was it a GOOD symphony? When Hank Williams sang &quot;I&apos;m so lonesome I could cry,&quot; that&apos;s the shit...he nailed it forever. And I was listening to some Hugh Tracey CD&apos;s of African music from the early 1950&apos;s...the music is, on the surface again, &quot;simple;&quot; maybe one chord, a few lines. But...is it &quot;difficult?&quot; If you can&apos;t sing in the language of those tribes, it would be not difficult, but impossible, to duplicate this music. Perhaps for those that grew up in those cultures, it is not a difficult thing...but for an outsider, not so easy. Same with blues/country...it may appear simple to those who don&apos;t live that life, but it isn&apos;t really.</p><p>   But...no biggie...this list is basically not made up of folks who have spent a lot of time playing blues/country/folk, whatever, from what I&apos;ve seen...so most comments will not be from an informed perspective as to just what these styles of music are all about. Be glad to have a blues contest with any list members ever in the Denver area...lets say the prize for winning would be a guitar in a microtonal tuning (I&apos;m open to discussion on that). And hell, after you get your rear toasted, I&apos;ll take you to get lunch at a great Thai place to help you recover...can&apos;t beat that, eh?
