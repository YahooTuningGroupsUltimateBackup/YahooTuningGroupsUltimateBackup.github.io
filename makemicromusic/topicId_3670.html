A nice mix opf people from various sorts of<br/>backgrounds, including both a member of this list with a doctorate<br/>in composition and an 80-year-old lady who worked in textile mills<br/>her whole working life, who is now making bobbin lace for a hobby<br/>and was ecstatic at sight of the portrait of Holy Roman Emperor<br/>Ferdinand III, with his lace collar. &quot;You know how much that stuff<br/>costs per inch?&quot; she asked. It was a rhetorical question, I still<br/>don&apos;t. But it was a good mix of people, who seemed quite attentive<br/>and interested. There was even a photographer from teh Fall River<br/>Herald News, who is middle aged and black and goes by the name<br/>&apos;Omar Bradley&apos;, who showed up on his day off (having photographed<br/>on orders of his boss a number of my concerts before and found<br/>them interesting) and smapped roll after roll of film, with a clicking<br/>noise which in the sonic world of the clavichord sounds rather like a<br/>gunshot and did not always happen on the downbeat -- but he<br/>meant it as a compliment. Nothing was in the paper today, but if it<br/>appears later I shall send the URL.</p><p>The tuning? Well, bad news here. Yesterday, in the course of the 4<br/>hours before the concert the temperature rose 30 degrees and the<br/>humidity rose 40 percentage points or more. So things were not<br/>perfectly stable (and alas a number of keys on the instrument got<br/>quite sluggish). Life is like that, and you just have to live wtih it. I<br/>tuned a half hour before the concert started, and then I did the best<br/>I could. If I had spent the last 10 minutes before I started to play<br/>touching up the tuning and easing a few keys, while making the<br/>audience sit perfectly still, perhaps the absolute sound would have<br/>been better; but at what cost in creation of discuomfort?</p><p>It went well. Rollicking good party afterwards too, with Bach violin<br/>sonatas and some atonal works too!</p><p>On 29 Jul 2002, at 22:39, Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Judy,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just wondered how the concert went on Sunday.</p><p>Judith Conrad clavichordist<br/><a href="http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html">http://home.mindspring.com/~judithconrad/index.html</a></p></div>
