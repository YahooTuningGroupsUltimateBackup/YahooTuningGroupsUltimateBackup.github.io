During my somewhat busy and distracted schedule this month, I<br/>have unfortunately confused the date of the extended deadline -<br/>thinking the contest was going to end on the 21st. Silly me being so<br/>absent minded. That and some minor problems with prolonged lack of<br/>concentration and mental slowness... If it is not yet too late to post<br/>the &quot;thus-far-ready&quot; two pieces I have been working on using the<br/>Ethno2 sounds, here is a quick link to them:</p><p><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/misc/nisabureynpesrev_ethno2.mp3">www.ozanyarman.com/misc/nisabureynpesrev_ethno2.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultansofthedance_ethno2.mp3">www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultansofthedance_ethno2.mp3</a></p><p>The first piece is an incomplete intro of my now-famous Nishabureyn<br/>Peshrev utilizing three 12-tone tuning tables. The instruments used<br/>are Indian Flute v2 (to imitate the ney), Oud, Veena (to imitate the<br/>tanbur with much tweaking), Dilruba (to resemble the bowed tanbur),<br/>Santur 2, Maghreb Violins and the usual array of percussions like<br/>bendirs, darbukas, etc...</p><p>The scales used in succession throughout the minute are:</p><p>|<br/>  16/15<br/>  9/8<br/>  32/27<br/>  32/25<br/>  7/5<br/>  17/12<br/>  3/2<br/>  8/5<br/>  128/75<br/>  16/9<br/>  48/25<br/>  2/1</p><p>|<br/>  16/15<br/>  9/8<br/>  32/27<br/>  81/64<br/>  4/3<br/>  17/12<br/>  3/2<br/>  8/5<br/>  27/16<br/>  16/9<br/>  48/25<br/>  2/1</p><p>|<br/>  16/15<br/>  9/8<br/>  6/5<br/>  320/243<br/>  4/3<br/>  17/12<br/>  405/256<br/>  8/5<br/>  5/3<br/>  27/16<br/>  256/135<br/>  2/1</p><p>This piece is hardly complete, due mostly to my inability to work with<br/>the 24-tone tuning tables in Ethno2 and my computer system frequently<br/>overloading with the 12-tone replica-instruments setup. In any case,<br/>the intro fits the minimum 50 seconds requirement. With some more<br/>effort and patience, and if I am given the oppurtunity to do so, I<br/>would like to conclude the Ethno2 rendition of the Nishabureyn Peshrev<br/>in the near future.</p><p>The second piece, again half-complete, and missing at the moment the<br/>most important (and gorgeous) microtonal melody part in the not-<br/>included second minute section, is a grandiose rehash of my &quot;Sultans<br/>of The Dance&quot; intro demo song which I had composed in 2001. It was not<br/>used back then for certain reasons and I grabbed the oppurtunity to<br/>prepare a re-make using the beautiful sounds of Ethno2.</p><p>A rescued (but a little damaged) recording from those days where I<br/>amateurisly dared to haphazardly pitch-bend the notes to acquire that<br/>wonderful Karjighar melody can be heard here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultan.mp3">www.ozanyarman.com/misc/Sultan.mp3</a></p><p>It is a pity that I couldn&apos;t complete it in time, but it should be<br/>understandable since brass sounds (trombones, horns, trumpets) are<br/>absent in Ethno2 and I had to combine several akin instruments<br/>cleverly to imitate a huge brass section and even a make-shift clarinet!</p><p>The scales so far used are, a Segah-Rast type tuning and Comptine<br/>according to Jacques&apos; formulation:</p><p>|<br/>  14/13<br/>  9/8<br/>  75/64<br/>  210/169<br/>  4/3<br/>  56/39<br/>  3/2<br/>  128/81<br/>  280/169<br/>  16/9<br/>  315/169<br/>  2/1</p><p>|<br/>  256/243<br/>  21995/19683<br/>  32/27<br/>  8192/6561<br/>  4/3<br/>  1024/729<br/>  9808/6561<br/>  128/81<br/>  10960/6561<br/>  16/9<br/>  4096/2187<br/>  2/1</p><p>The projected Nadhaswaram Karjighar tune will rely on this 12-tone<br/>tuning of mine based on Comptine:</p><p>|<br/>  14/13<br/>  800/729<br/>  32/27<br/>  210/169<br/>  4/3<br/>  56/39<br/>  3/2<br/>  128/81<br/>  280/169<br/>  16/9<br/>  315/169<br/>  2/1</p><p>Instruments thus far used in &quot;Sultan&quot;: Piano Bastringue, Amazona5,<br/>Chimes1, Triangle2, Addiction (warped to produce a Clarinet timbre),<br/>Balkanish Saxophone (to reinforce the Clarinet timbre), Chamber<br/>Machine, Wait in Space, Grand Canyon, Lost Impression, Ominous Pad,<br/>Magreb Violin+Strings, Typical Jupiter /Brassy Mood /Bright Analogic<br/>(combo tweaked for Full Brass effect), Gu 1 Bass, Aboriginal Perc<br/>Bass, Chinese Gong 14.5&quot; / Cambodian Gong 18&quot;  1&amp;2 / Belltree<br/>(hardpanned duo), Shakers Rolls (hardpanned duo)... and more to come<br/>if I can get it complete.</p><p>Once again, I would very much like to finish this piece too in the<br/>near future using Ethno2. I hope to be given such an oppurtunity if it<br/>is possible.</p><p>My apologies for being so absent minded and neglectful with the dates.<br/>I hope everybody will understand.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget to vote for the &quot;Son Bir Kez&quot; H&uuml;zzam Sharki!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Jul 20, 2010, at 1:43 AM, Jacques Dudon wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi friends,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is to let you know my internet line has been repaired a few<br/>&gt; days ago.<br/>&gt; I am able to read the wonderful tuning list messages again -<br/>&gt; and hear the last Ethno demos (surprising works !) :<br/>&gt; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9grkajrdg7uo6ds">https://www.dropbox.com/s/9grkajrdg7uo6ds</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And to share with you the totality now of my own 3 Ethno demos -<br/>&gt; You can hear and read about them at<br/>&gt; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay9ktuh93lcunxo">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay9ktuh93lcunxo</a><br/>&gt; I am glad, even if an amateur on that type of instrument, that I<br/>&gt; could finalize this test<br/>&gt; and could gain to keep my own software !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, Ethno2 microtonal demo competition has arrived at its end<br/>&gt; yesterday.<br/>&gt; Again, my thanks to all the participants !<br/>&gt; The AEH Jury will now meet for the deliberation and the award<br/>&gt; ceremony Thursday evening 22nd of July at 19h., and results should<br/>&gt; be published on this list this week-end.<br/>&gt; Until then and even after the dropbox can receive the last demos and<br/>&gt; the last versions.<br/>&gt; Thanks to precise the tunings and write your presentation if it has<br/>&gt; not been done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the meantime anyone who wishes (that has listened to ALL the<br/>&gt; titles in the dropbox, per favor !) can send me - perhaps better<br/>&gt; offlist, or I would be called a spammer - a vote for a list of any<br/>&gt; number of titles presented by preference order (ex. with numbers 1 2<br/>&gt; 3 4 5...) and we will try to sort out of it an additionnal *Tuning<br/>&gt; List* prize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Candidates themselves can also vote, by two special ways :<br/>&gt; - by sending the same kind of list but non-including themselves ;<br/>&gt; - by saying what is their own prefered demo(s) according to them, if<br/>&gt; they have some.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bye for now, sorry for the disgression,<br/>&gt; - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; Jacques<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
