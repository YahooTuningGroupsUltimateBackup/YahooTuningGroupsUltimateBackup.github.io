The soundtrack album for Drawing Restraint 9 is not really<br/>a Bjork album per se. The cremaster movies can only be seen when they are<br/>being shown locally in theatre or museum. However, they are all easily<br/>obtained on p2p, not the greatest quality but good enough to see what<br/>they&apos;re about. There is one offical DVD release of a segment of Cremaster 3<br/>that takes place in the Guggenheim, but i wouldn&apos;t say that it is<br/>particularly representative of the series in general. Hopefully Drawing<br/>Restraint 9 will be released in some kind of wider distribution. He doesn&apos;t<br/>distribute his movies widely on DVD becuase he sells the DVDs in homemade<br/>constructions through his art dealer for like $100,000 each. I guess he&apos;s<br/>more interested in one person seeing the movie and making alot of money off<br/>that one person than selling them at average DVD prices and letting alot of<br/>people see the movies. Also it is an attempt to create a mystique around the<br/>movies, since you have to make an effort to find out when they&apos;re playing,<br/>go see them etc. Ideally, the movies are shown in a museum in conjunction<br/>with an exhibit of his vaseline sculptures etc. Like his stuff or hate his<br/>stuff, you have to at least give him credit for carrying through with the<br/>big projects. Lots of us have good ideas but how many of us have the energy<br/>or discipline to create on such a large scale like Barney or Wagner.</p><p>&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;[<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of Jon Szanto<br/>&gt;Sent: Thursday, March 23, 2006 2:16 PM<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Subject: Re: [MMM] Cremaster<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;db,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;&gt;I knew what you were talking about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Passing it on for Rozencrantz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve listened to the CD a few times.
