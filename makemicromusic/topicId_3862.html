Book called &apos;Physics and Music&apos; by Sir<br/>James Jeans (whose wife played the clavichord....) is also good for<br/>basics. History of temperament, well, mostly unreadable, alas, but<br/>there&apos;s Mark Lindley, &apos;Lutes, Viols and Temperament&apos;,  and a quite<br/>new little book by Stuart Issakoff called &apos;Temperament&apos; which is<br/>fairly readable but alas gets mountains of things wrong. Piano<br/>tuning, best book I have is &apos;Piano Tuning, Servicing and Rebuilding&apos;<br/>by Arthur Reblitz. And there is a huge book on the history of<br/>temperament in pianos, sort of, called &apos;Tuning&apos;, by Owen Jorgenson,<br/>which is fascinating, but expensive, specialized and I fear quite<br/>misleading in many ways.</p><p>Judy</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Your Life on the Net<br/>&gt; DreamWiz Free Mail @ <a href="http://www.dreamwiz.com/">http://www.dreamwiz.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
