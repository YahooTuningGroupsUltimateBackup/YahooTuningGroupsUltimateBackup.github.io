More details and audio can be<br/>found at <a href="http://www.untwelve.org">www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>Fresh off the heels of UnTwelve&apos;s first annual composition competition, we<br/>announce an exciting collaboration with 60x60 (<a href="http://www.voxnovus.com">www.voxnovus.com</a>) at the<br/>Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art on April 27th, 2010. We hope some of you<br/>will write a one-minute concert to be heard at the event. Here&apos;s the press<br/>release:</p><p>######################</p><p>60x60 is calling for works for its first &quot;UnTwelve&quot; Mix</p><p>On April 27th, 2010, Vox Novus in collaboration with UnTwelve<br/>(<a href="http://www.untwelve.org">www.untwelve.org</a>) will present a special microtonal mix of the 60x60<br/>project at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.  In this particular<br/>instance, the 60 works will have an UnTwelve slant, as the emphasis will be<br/>on microtonal music.</p><p>Submission to this will be done through the general online submission<br/>process (Details below).  Participants who wish to be considered for this<br/>mix should indicate the microtonal aspect in their program notes with the<br/>submission.</p><p>For the 60x60 UnTwelve mix the work MUST be microtonal, meaning that there<br/>is prominent use of pitches outside the standard 12-tone equal temperament.</p><p>Examples of acceptable entries would include pieces in any division of the<br/>octave which is NOT 12...(e.g.  7, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 31, etc.,<br/>for scales which have a recognisable 5th, so are capable of recognisable yet<br/>novel diatonic scales, with varying degrees of &apos;exotic resources&apos;; and 8, 9,<br/>11, 13, 16, 18, 23, etc., for more exotic scales WITHOUT good 5ths, and thus<br/>much less capable of traditionally recognisable diatonic scales), various<br/>just (pure) intonation or rational intonation systems, non-just, non-equal<br/>tuning systems, and non-octave based systems (e.g Bohlen-Pierce scale, Wendy<br/>Carlos&apos; Alpha, Beta or Gamma, etc.).</p><p>You should not feel the need to use every pitch in a given tuning system&apos;s<br/>gamut; feel free to construct scales from subsets of a given &apos;larger&apos;<br/>system.  The overall sound of your piece should reflect a contrast to the<br/>standard tuning of 12-tone equal temperament in color and mood, and ideally<br/>should be a model and inspiration to others of the yet under-explored<br/>possibilities and beauties of expanding the &apos;pitch palette&apos;. The goal is to<br/>excite others about the freshness and possibilities for composition and<br/>production values outside of a default pitch norm.</p><p>Vox Novus is inviting composers to submit recorded works 60 seconds or less<br/>in length to be included in its eighth annual 60x60 project.</p><p>For 2010 60x60 is doing a special collaboration with ICMC (International<br/>Computer Music Conference) 360 degrees of 60x60.  For ICMC we will be<br/>selected 360 one minute works for a 6 concert presentation of the wide world<br/>of electronic music.  All submissions to 60x60 will be considered for both<br/>the 60x60 International mix, the 360 degrees of 60x60 at ICMC, and the<br/>UnTwelve Mix.  However, only works that fit the UnTwelve mixes&apos; definition<br/>will be eligible for the UnTwelve concert in Chicago (see<br/><a href="http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/submission/UnTwelve">http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/submission/UnTwelve</a> for details).  As with all<br/>previous years, if 60x60 receives enough submissions of a specific region or<br/>theme, 60x60 will create an alternate mix to accommodate those submissions.</p><p>Submission to the 60x60 project will be done online as .wav and .aiff files.</p><p>(No MP3s)</p><p>Submissions to the 60x60 project can be done online at:</p><p><a href="http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/Submission">http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/Submission</a> (note: NOT UP UNTIL NOVEMBER!!!!)</p><p>During the concert each of the 60 pieces selected will begin precisely at<br/>the beginning of the minute, this will mark the end of one piece and the<br/>beginning of another.  There will be no pause between the pieces.  Works may<br/>be less than 60 seconds in length, but may not exceed 60 seconds.  Works<br/>selected that are less than 60 seconds long will be &quot;padded&quot; with silence<br/>either before, after, or surrounding the composition.  Please note that the<br/>total duration of the work including silence may NOT exceed sixty seconds.</p><p>The 60x60 project&apos;s definition of a record work is as follows: any work<br/>created as a musical composition which is captured on recorded media, which<br/>does not require live performers for its production in broadcast at concert<br/>halls, radio, multi-media, etc.  Its creation can include but not limited to<br/>acoustic instruments, voice, environmental sources, and computer (Sampling,<br/>MIDI, Csound, ProTools, etc.) Acoustic created electronic works should be<br/>submitted with the understanding that it is their recording that is of prime<br/>importance and is what will be used to determine its selection.</p><p>60x60 is a project of &quot;signature works&quot; and short works created specifically<br/>for the 60x60 project.  Excerpts of larger works are strongly discouraged.<br/>Works generated from procedures (i.e.  mathematical matrices, organisational<br/>systems, or computer programs,) remixed works, or themes and motives<br/>recomposed from other of the composer&apos;s own work are acceptable.</p><p>The call is open to composers of any nationality, age, or career stage.<br/>Works submitted must not have been previously performed or broadcast.<br/>Works must be submitted online.  DO NOT EMAIL submissions to Vox Novus.<br/>Emailed submissions will not be opened nor accepted to the project.  Works<br/>may only be submitted online.  Only one work may be submitted.  Works will<br/>be included in the 60x60 archive and may be performed in subsequent<br/>performances after the debut concert.  All submissions must be submitted<br/>online by December 31st, 2009.
