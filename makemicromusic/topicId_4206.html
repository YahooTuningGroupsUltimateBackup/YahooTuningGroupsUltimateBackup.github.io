It&apos;s a pretty nice intstrument. If you&apos;re looking for a MIDI interface for it, there&apos;s a company called Wavefront that makes one for about $675. It&apos;s a Theremin to MIDI converter unit in its own box. So you can get a theremin and a MIDI converter for about $1000 insteaed of $5000...</p><p>By the way, I have found the theremin is really really hard to play. It is not a piece of cake, even though Clara Rockmore makes it look like a piece of cake. Heck, it&apos;s so hard to play, I&apos;d consider sending you mine for a lot less... ;-)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
