It was gratifying to get responses<br/>from others who are far more experienced with microtonal music than I<br/>am. I found it especially interesting to hear how dissonant or not<br/>dissonant it sounded to others.</p><p>I was pleased that Margo Schulter brought up the subjects of<br/>dissonance and ambiguity. I am very interested in these subjects and<br/>would be pleased to hear other people&apos;s comments, either here or at a<br/>different discussion. I have great respect for justly tuned intervals<br/>and those who make music with them, but I find myself increasingly<br/>drawn to temperaments with various degrees of dissonance. I am<br/>excited when this results in ambiguity and multiple possible<br/>interpretations of the same musical material. I don&apos;t usually like<br/>music that sounds dissonant, but I think it&apos;s really cool when<br/>dissonance can be made to sound nice or even pretty.</p><p>Thanks again,<br/>Daniel Thompson<br/><a href="http://danielthompson.blogspot.com">http://danielthompson.blogspot.com</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me thank you warmly for the mp3, which I was able to find<br/>&gt; and download with the Lynx browser starting at your blog.
