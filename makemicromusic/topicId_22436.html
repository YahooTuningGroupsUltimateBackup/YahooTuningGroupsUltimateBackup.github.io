Hell, Mahavishnu was popular at one time, so was King Crimson, Yes, Hendrix, Deep Purple, the Yardbirds, and many others who made interesting and profound music. I cannot believe how insignificant pop music has become these days...and it is indeed often more social in meaning than musical. Maybe we&apos;ll help change that...best...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>The New Busy think 9 to 5 is a cute idea.

For example the Kinks&apos; early work such as All Day And All Of The Night, You Really Got Me, Wicked Annabella, the many folk songs and popular tunes that you only need two chords to play such as Molly Malone, Lilly The Pink, The Red Flag, Jingle Bells. A lot of Renaissance Tunes stay in one major mode and only use three chords. Many many blues and blues based tunes use the same chord sequence. Even Beethoven&apos;s 5th symphony, one of the most famous pieces of classical music, is to a large extent just variations on the main theme, which only has two notes, one played 3 times then the other once, with a steady monotonous beat.</p></div>
