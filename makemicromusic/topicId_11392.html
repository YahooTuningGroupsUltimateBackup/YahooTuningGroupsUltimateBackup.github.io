(Please see earlier<br/>messages in this thread if you haven&apos;t been following.)</p><p>Robert&apos;s FTS implementation has now progressed to a basically &quot;bug-free&quot;<br/>state such that I&apos;m able to use a larger orchestra and work on more than 1<br/>MIDI device, and the GPO keyswitches all work properly, so it can do<br/>pizzicato and all that stuff.</p><p>Here is an orchestra of 5 winds, 4 brass, and strings in GPO. I also added<br/>a piano using one channel of Wusik in 15-tet.</p><p><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/temp/GPO-FTS-15tet-Test4.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/temp/GPO-FTS-15tet-Test4.mp3</a></p><p>The music is a slight expansion of the same &quot;messing around&quot; I posted back<br/>on December 14.</p><p>Balance and panning leave something to be desired, but you get the basic<br/>idea.

And do you have to be a beta<br/>&gt; &gt; tester for FTS?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think if you write to Robert Walker he could tell you. He has a 30-day<br/>&gt; free trial, which would help you determine if FTS meets your needs. FTS is<br/>&gt; not very expensive anyway. GPO itself, however, is pretty expensive. You<br/>&gt; also need a MIDI loop driver like &quot;Midi Yoke&quot; to do any of this, because<br/>&gt; you have to connect the output of some MIDI player to FTS, and then<br/>connect<br/>&gt; FTS to GPO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FTS: <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a><br/>&gt; GPO: <a href="http://www.garritan.com">http://www.garritan.com</a><br/>&gt; MIDI Yoke: <a href="http://www.midiox.com">http://www.midiox.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a bit of a hassle to set up FTS with all of the right options and<br/>&gt; windows to do this, but once you&apos;ve done it, the software remembers your<br/>&gt; settings, and then all you have to do is point it at different tuning<br/>&gt; files. At some point, when Robert releases the next FTS version, I had<br/>&gt; planned to write up some pointers about how to set up FTS properly for<br/>this<br/>&gt; kind of re-tuning.</p><p>Rick,</p><p>Thanks for the info.
