Ten feet before I<br/>stopped, i noticed a not un-pretty young woman smiling at me with a sort</p><p>of earnest, but vacuous intent. She was slouching in a folding metal<br/>chair just left of the doors, holding with both hands a coffee can with<br/>a homemade pasted on paper label.<br/>    Opening my door, i stare at the ground while exiting. I&apos;m trying to<br/>avoid eye contact with her, but the cigarette butts, gum blobs, and<br/>rainbow glinting oil stains have once again upstaged the best in<br/>post-war art. Even though this living museum of the quotidian is viewed<br/>in an instant, it makes a big impression. Swinging around the door while</p><p>closing it in one fell swoop of grace, I step over the curb and commit<br/>to the inevitable. I knew from the first instant that she wanted<br/>something. She wasn&apos;t selling chocolate or anything, probably just<br/>asking for a donation to aid in whatever cause a pretty young women<br/>might find herself engaged. My desire to avoid and/ or repulse contact<br/>meets with the curiosity and attraction that a not un-pretty young woman</p><p>can muster in a man that spends alot of time looking intently at street<br/>and sidewalk surfaces. Split second contemplation (so many things to see</p><p>and do on this short walk to the door!) has me deciding to allow her<br/>whatever social interaction she has up her sleeveless baby-T.<br/>    &quot;Woo you like to donate to the hurried mumble mumble?&quot; Ugh. It<br/>breaks your heart. You can&apos;t decide if you just want to give them a<br/>buck, or tell them that no matter how many times they give the pitch,<br/>they have to make it sound like the first.<br/>Looking her straight in the eyes, feeling a bit conned by her innocent<br/>and sweet yet earnest but vacuous smile, i tell her I&apos;ll think about it<br/>as I enter the store.</p><p>Five weeks later.</p><p>&quot;Jake, it&apos;s George&quot;<br/>&quot;What&apos;s up man?&quot;</p><p>So starts a conversation that has my friend Jake meeting me at Yucca<br/>Valley High School for the first football game of the season. I got<br/>there a little early, nervous with anticipation. Sitting in metal<br/>bleachers for the first time in 16 years or so, I&apos;m amazed at how the<br/>little raised rows of anti-slip design, still make my butt feel wierd.<br/>Tempted to buy a YVHS TROJANS bleacher cushion, I pass. This is the only</p><p>game I&apos;m going to. Jake finds me and sit&apos;s down to my right.</p><p>&quot;What am I doing here?&quot;<br/>&quot;It&apos;s football Jake. What more could you want?&quot;<br/>&quot;Uhh.&quot;</p><p>Ten minutes before the players take the field, the YVHS Trojan<br/>cheerleaders set up arms length apart and begin the first cheer.</p><p>(with expected movement of synchronized pom-poms)</p><p>&quot;Y.V.H.S. Trojans won&apos;t, take no mess&quot;.</p><p>(then in a completely unexpected departure from traditional cheer<br/>choreography)</p><p>&quot;Humpin&apos;. Funkin&apos; jumpin&apos;. Gig around, shakin&apos; your rump&apos;n when a doodle</p><p>point rubber nosed visitor fronts, you tell&apos;m to STEP OFF! Were doin&apos;<br/>the hump&quot;.</p><p>This newish sort of hip-hop cheering has half the crowd on it&apos;s feet,<br/>screaming an attitudinal approvement.</p><p>&quot;You look tense man, what&apos;s up?&quot;<br/>&quot;I hope we win&quot;.</p><p>Pretending to be sitting in imaginary chairs, the cheerleaders began the</p><p>next cheer.</p><p>&quot;Like Beckett like Partch like Ubu Roi, rhythm in rhymes do we deploy,<br/>like Paul Revere at his silver forge, we just wanna say THANK YOU<br/>GEORGE!</p><p>The crowd goes absolutely crazy. In motionless silence. I feel my face<br/>turning infra-red.</p><p>&quot;They talking about you G?&quot;<br/>&quot;Uhh, yeah. Let&apos;s split.&quot;</p><p>Embarrassed but still fairly proud of my transaction, i walk to my car<br/>with a binary glow. Five weeks previous, i had come out of the<br/>convenience store and made the not un-pretty young woman an offer. &quot;I&apos;ll</p><p>give your group twenty bucks if you mention my name in a cheer at the<br/>first game.&quot;<br/>&quot;You got it. What&apos;s your name?&quot; I almost said Richard Fellashio, but<br/>instead told her &quot;George&quot;.</p><p>Absolute vanity corrupts absolutely.</p></div>
