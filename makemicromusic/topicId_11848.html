I beg to differ. Anyone can put holes in a piece of<br/>paper, but Conlon Nancarrow&apos;s near-autistic devotion and mathematical<br/>precision lead to some of the best music in *any* ET. Part of his<br/>genious was in abandoning the short-sighted view of consonance-good<br/>dissonance-bad. By treating very short dissonant figures as<br/>indeterminate percussion, he could add timbral layers that, while they<br/>didn&apos;t sound like a piano, were still incredibly evocative. In this<br/>way he transcended not only the traditional limitations of his<br/>instrument (including its tuning) but also the &quot;soulless&quot; nature of<br/>mechanically aided music in general.</p><p>I feel like a broken record, I seem to be telling everyone these days:<br/>Don&apos;t knock it &apos;till you&apos;ve tried it. Listen to &quot;The Contest of<br/>Pleasures&quot; by Butcher, Dorner, and Charles. They manage to pull<br/>endless subtlety out of only 12 notes. &quot;Good Morning/Good Night&quot; pulls<br/>even deeper intricacy out of (seemingly) 3 notes.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard the saying &quot;It isn&apos;t the size of the dog in the<br/>fight, but the size of the fight in the dog.&quot; I think it applies well<br/>here. The tuning system, I believe, has only a minimal impact on the<br/>expressiveness of a piece, whether it be Slendro, Adaptive JI, or<br/>12-tet. What matters is the size of the soul that wrestles the song<br/>out of Platonic Unbeing and pins it to the page for people to hear.</p><p>On 1/15/06, Yahya Abdal-Aziz &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In _my_ opinion, such insults are out of place here;<br/>&gt; as a community of interest, we should be able to<br/>&gt; encourage and _gently_ correct each other when<br/>&gt; we perceive mistakes in this difficult (and sometimes<br/>&gt; subjective) work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Besides, let&apos;s look at the term &quot;amateur&quot;.
