I&apos;ll be writing more about this, and for now would<br/>just remark that what I&apos;ve taped so far may mainly illustrate the<br/>potentials of 13-tET and the imperfections of my keyboard techniques.]</p><p>Hello, there, everyone, and my special best wishes to Mary, whose<br/>artistry with timbres and orchestration provided a bit of inspiration<br/>for me today as a rank beginner in the art of sound design.</p><p>Over the last couple of days, I&apos;ve realized that an especially term<br/>for this process in the setting of 13-tET (or 13-EDO or 13ED2, if you<br/>prefer) is &quot;Chowningization,&quot; in honor of John Chowning, whose music<br/>speaks to both the tuning and timbre sides of the equation.</p><p>Today was an occasion for me to celebrate and honor the contributions<br/>of John Chowning both as the composer of _Stria_ (1981), a piece based<br/>on a division of Phi into nine equal parts almost identical to 13-tET,<br/>and as the inventor of FM synthesis and the algorithms on the TX-802<br/>synthesizer that I am now learning about in developing timbres for<br/>this temperament.</p><p>Could it be that the Yahama preset &quot;Piccolo&quot; voice (A27) was developed<br/>for Chowning&apos;s Phi-based scale, or some similar tuning with a fifth<br/>around 8/9 Phi, or 8/13 octave -- around 738 cents in 13-tET?</p><p>One high point happened when my &quot;Chowningization&quot; -- taking a preset<br/>voice and playing around with the FM algorithms or operators to see<br/>how it affects the timbre/tuning fit for 13-tET.</p><p>Already I had happily found a &quot;Celeste&quot; voice (B22), made a minor<br/>adjustment or two on the FM operators, and found that it fit<br/>beautifully both with the tuning and with some other organ-like<br/>timbres that I had.</p><p>Now I was editing a timbre called &quot;Lady Vox&quot; (A62), changing a couple<br/>of operators from fixed to ratio mode -- that is, from a fixed<br/>frequency for all notes to one forming a ratio with the frequency of a<br/>given note.</p><p>When I tried a ratio mode setting of 1.53, very close to the ratio of<br/>the 13-tET fifth (somewhat larger than a pure 3:2, or 1.5), I noticed<br/>that the effect was indeed a kind of &quot;partial,&quot; and maybe around now<br/>had a moment of recognition.</p><p>This was the kind of timbre that really reminded me of your music,<br/>Mary -- floating, &quot;spacy,&quot; and also very pleasant. It would give my<br/>music a side that I have admired both in your pieces and in those of<br/>Bill Sethares, and would also blend neatly with an organ timbre,<br/>distinguishing melodic lines while fitting together harmoniously.</p><p>Of course, Mary, I also had to include Phi in a timbre dedicated to<br/>you -- reflecting also on John Chowning&apos;s role mentioned by Graham --<br/>so I adjusted another operator to a ratio mode setting of 1.62, the<br/>nearest approximation to Phi at around 1.618. This is also the best<br/>match for the 13-tET interval of 9/13 octave or about 1.616, around<br/>830.77 cents, very close to Phi at around 833.09 cents.</p><p>It&apos;s a wonderful timbre, and I&apos;m just about ready to record a tape<br/>using it and some other timbres for music in 13-tET.</p><p>Mary, thank you for your music, so that when I heard that timbre I<br/>could recognize it, say to myself, &quot;Mary Beth Ackerley,&quot; and know that<br/>it was right. It&apos;s wonderful for a timbre to stand at once for a new<br/>kind of musical adventure, and for a friendship of the kind this group<br/>fosters.</p><p>With peace and love for all,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=746 href="#746">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/28/2001 9:07:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo</p><p>I can&apos;t wait to hear your new piece.  And I&apos;ve delighted in reading<br/>about your adventures with a new tuning because you are so clearly<br/>enjoying yourself.  And I think that without that element of joy ,<br/>that spark that just loves to create because it can, music remains<br/>robotic and devoid of artistry, although technically proficient.</p><p>I am also learning from you.  Whenever I tweak sounds I tend to just<br/>go in and fiddle with knobs (usually virtual) till I like what I<br/>hear.  Now I think I will pay more attention to partials and their<br/>ratios in the tuning that I am using.</p><p>I just got some gorgeous samples of European Baroque organs.  They<br/>are six organs from Italy, France and Holland that are sampled by<br/>someone who clearly loved what he wa doing.  Each organ has such a<br/>distinct personality, and I suspect it has a lot to do with its<br/>characteristic partials.  I plan, of course, on giving them &quot;more<br/>personality&quot; but your writing has inspired me to tune them for my own<br/>favorite tunings.</p><p>Anyway thank you Margo for demonstrating that it is very possible to<br/>push oneself a bit and move into creating music as well as writing<br/>about it.</p><p>MAry</p></div>
