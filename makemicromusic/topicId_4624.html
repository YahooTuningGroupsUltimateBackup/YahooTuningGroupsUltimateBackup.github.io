WHEN PUSHING A BUTTON (OR FLIPPING A SWITCH) OF A CERTAIN<br/>KEY, THAT KEY (ON ALL OCTAVES OF THE KEYBOARD) GETS LOWERED BY A<br/>QUARTER TONE (-1/4). SO IF YOU WANTED E AND B TO BE LOWERED YOU WOULD<br/>SIMPLY PUSH THE TWO RESPECTIVE BUTTONS, AND SO ON...THE CANCEL BUTTON<br/>IS SIMPLY THE SWITCH THAT CANCELS ANY ACTIVE QUARTER TONE BUTTONS.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/mosiqaar">http://www.geocities.com/mosiqaar</a>&quot;</p><p>I take this  idea one step further.</p><p>A built-in tone box with plus or minus (or normal) settings may look<br/>as shown.</p><p>SEE FILE: Arabic Tone Box</p><p>Note: C, C+, C#-, C# or Db, Db+, D-, and D are seven different<br/>pitches (each one tunable) for a total of 36 preset tones.</p><p>Your comments please.</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Jim</p></div>
