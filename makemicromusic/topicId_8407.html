If a generalized<br/>keyboard works with this scale, then any of you could merely have<br/>suggested building a keyboard BASED ON the generalized mapping of<br/>22.  Since the generalized keyboard is made to play in also much<br/>larger tuning systems, I presume I could make a specialized keyboard<br/>simply by mapping it to 22 and then &quot;cutting away the fat&quot;, and then<br/>reshaping what is left into something with traditional key shapes.<br/>George suggested that for 22 to be utilized effectively in a<br/>generalized design, you only need 9 repeat keys to keep a uniformity<br/>of voicing.  Seeing as how this is less than 2 manuals, I would<br/>imagine I could use this subset to make a more compact and<br/>specialized version of the generalized design.  I imagine that using<br/>this design the keyboard layout would be asymmetrical, and if I used<br/>keys shaped like those on Fokker&apos;s 31-tone organ in rows of varying<br/>height, there would also be tactile landmarks just as functional as<br/>in any other design.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s all or nothing, why no one has suggested this<br/>type of compromise.  Nor do I see anyone addressing my argument for<br/>tactile landmarks.  Are you all honestly telling me that being able<br/>to feel where you are on the keyboard by touch alone is a *bad*<br/>thing?</p><p>Rick, I must also say that your justification of Microtonality&apos;s<br/>hiddenness seems to me both defeatist and illogical.  You seem to be<br/>arguing that no one should DO anything except keep sitting at their<br/>desks writing theory papers and making MIDI files while nature takes<br/>its course.  I don&apos;t expect everyone to get behind a specific system,<br/>but it would sure help if at least SOME people got together behind<br/>SOME system for a long enough time to establish it as a viable<br/>alternative to 12.  How will anything evolve if no one is pushing for<br/>it?</p><p>Honestly, folks, there is no perfect system.  Yet at this point in<br/>the musical development of our culture, ANY alternative is a good<br/>alternative.  If I so happen to like 22-equal, and I want to make a<br/>bid at bringing this tuning into the cultural consciousness by means<br/>of specialized instruments (not to mention by forming an ensemble to<br/>use them), is that wrong?  Do I have my head on backwards?  Should I<br/>just be content to sit back and wait for everyone to have their own<br/>epiphanies (as I did) and come trickling into this forum seeking the<br/>same things I have?</p><p>I think you guys underestimate the importance of having a well-<br/>implemented music system that is understood and utilized by a large<br/>number of people.

I tried to defend your choice of velocity insensitivity.<br/>As for tactile feedback, there are two people I know of that<br/>have achieved some degree of proficiency on uniform keyboards:<br/>George Secor and Paul Vandervoort.

Maybe, maybe not.

Yet at this point in<br/>&gt; the musical development of our culture, ANY alternative is a good<br/>&gt; alternative.</p><p>Hmm. Must we make up our minds? I like the notion of Johnny<br/>Reinhard&apos;s polymicrotonality and the coexistence of different<br/>systems.  I recall reading a snippet about him on 31-tone bassoon<br/>doubling Jon Catler in 7-equal or something; perhaps the alternative<br/>I&apos;d be happiest with would be the union of all conceivable tuning<br/>systems. We are limited only by what we are able to hear. (Of course,<br/>this is the worst for fixed-pitch beasts like keyboards!, but I was<br/>thinking maybe a clavichord where the keys are completely moveable,<br/>or something along the lines of Aaron Hunt&apos;s gooseplex or tonal<br/>plexus)</p><p>But I must clarify. I like to think of clean versus messy<br/>microtonality. Clean is well-defined, consciously created systems,<br/>each perhaps with their own characteristic sound reflecting their<br/>unique construction.  Messy is free pitch, relying excessively on<br/>your ears, and *perhaps* not caring so much that this or that note be<br/>right where you planned it; messy is perhaps its own characteristic<br/>sound. Of course, both are of great value musically, and both are<br/>equally tricky to get at.  With clean, you often need further<br/>technical apparatus; with dirty you need more familiarity with<br/>whatever instrument, it would seem.</p><p>Where was I?</p><p>Ah, but what is easiest for people? One clean system? Perhaps, though<br/>I fear the one we have gives enough people ample trouble. Two clean<br/>systems?  To me, this is only an (inductive) hop away from all<br/>systems! The building block of any scale at all is the interval, and<br/>if folks can get a grasp on a reasonable interval resolution, a world<br/>of scales comes into reach.</p><p>If the question is what most people can quickly comprehend, I don&apos;t<br/>know.  It took me less than a year to internalize the basics and<br/>begin to draw my own conclusions, and that&apos;s short in proportion to<br/>my musical life thus far. If this is all it takes for the average<br/>musician, I would try and convince every musician I know to undergo a<br/>microtonal quest... to become capable of at least an intellectual<br/>understanding of any tuning. Though it&apos;s undoubtably harder for some.</p><p>Although no matter how perfectly a pianist understands 22 equal,<br/>he&apos;ll still need a special keyboard. Oy. Pardon my irrelevance.</p><p>&gt; I think you guys underestimate the importance of having a well-<br/>&gt; implemented music system that is understood and utilized by a large<br/>&gt; number of people.  Part of the joy of music is playing it with<br/>other<br/>&gt; people.  There are few things I find more exhilirating than a good<br/>&gt; jam session.  How many of you have experienced the feeling of total<br/>&gt; spiritual connection that comes via musical dialogue with others?</p><p>Not me so much :(. But may I ask how much this spiritual connection<br/>relies on the criterion that the parties involved are in the same<br/>tuning system, i.e. &quot;speaking the same language&quot;?  My only<br/>polymicrotonal jam session involved two musical saws, turntable, and<br/>some weird electronics. The connection was dubious.  Anyone else?</p><p>&gt; And if there is not at least some large-scale acceptance<br/>&gt; of your tuning, you&apos;re pretty much S.O.L. unless you can convince a<br/>&gt; few friends to shell out big bucks to modify their own instruments.</p><p>If you&apos;re going for clean microtonality, this is more true. But worth<br/>considering, especially financially, is the necessity-driven<br/>creativity of the dirty mind. Take a ukelele, tune pairs of strings<br/>quartertones apart, or tune whole thing to a 7-limit tetrad, wham!<br/>Instant xenharmony.</p><p>&gt; Either way, I&apos;m not going to<br/>&gt; post asking for any more opinions on a specialized 22-equal<br/>&gt; keyboard.  It&apos;s been made abundantly clear that I will get no<br/>&gt; constructive criticism here.</p><p>Sorry we couldn&apos;t be helpful.  I just thought to mention one thing<br/>about keyboards that I like. It has to do with touch.  Specifically,<br/>it&apos;s nice to be able to bang out a pan-diatonic something-or-other on<br/>the white keys of a piano.

Otherwise i am not sure why you were dismissing the idea so quickly.<br/>On more than 2 post i mentioned you could have keys shaped however you want them.<br/>Personally i don&apos;t like the idea of using 22 out of the 31 keyboard. When i came down to mounting a 22 tone vibraphone out if a 31 master set. This did not look easy to play. Now it might be a good idea for you, but do you want me the recommend bad ideas?

Why do you care what they do, it is what YOU do that matters. The problem is that even if this your concern, everyone who comes  to it feels that everyone else who has been doing it has doing it wrong, otherwise the whole world would be doing the same thing. What this has lead to is each person comes in and reinvents the wheel, this has slowed things down with mircotonality more than anything. There is and have been many very brilliant people who have thought out these problems quite extensively. At this point  (nothing would make me happier to be disproved in this statement, really) I think things have developed beyond the point that  one is not going to make their mark in the fundamentals in this field. There are ample amounts of scales, and designs to choose from we all know that at this point of the game the idea of a single tuning is not going to happen ,nor is it even a good idea. The only way to make such a thing come about is by musical fascism and force people into a single choice. If such a decision comes about , it cannot be made by the theory , it has to be made by how music actually grows, not how we think it is going to grow. The idea of &apos;musical evolution&apos; is dangerous, for it leads to the idea that music has an ultimate goal, which in term means any deviation from this is wrong. To prevent these wrong steps one has to use force of some kinds or just dismiss all other alternatives.

The name of the group wasn&apos;t chosen idly: it was determined that there was a NEED - a forum for those who want to MAKE microtonal music. I should know: I started this place.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean that everyone makes it the same way, and I&apos;m glad we don&apos;t. All I know is that there are quite a few here who *do* make microtonal music, and they are a subset of those who do the same out in the big world. And a lot of them read, and don&apos;t post often. So, I want you to stay, and be a new voice in this particular chorus. Take all of the following in that particular positive light.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I think all of you have missed a point, right from the get go. All I &gt;wanted was a specialized 22-note keyboard.</p><p>I certainly understood the point. I also note the opening comments from you in the two main threads on this:</p><p>#1. &quot;Any comments on the design are welcome, as are any suggestions on building one in real life (materials we should use, etc.).&quot;</p><p>#2. &quot;All in all, I think it&apos;s a decent blend between innovation and tradition. What do y&apos;all think?  Might this one be serviceable?&quot;</p><p>You really did solicit peoples opinions and ideas, and you are addressing a crowd that has had more than the usual experience with the difficulties of trying to coax non12 music out of a 12centric world. Even when there was in-depth talk in support of something a little different - say, the generalized kbd area - it was (knowing these people) from the standpoint of attempting a solution that might yield even more than you hoped for. No one would wish you ill if you went your own way and built a 22tet only kbd, and we&apos;d look forward to the results.</p><p>&gt;Nor do I see anyone addressing my argument for tactile landmarks.  Are you &gt;all honestly telling me that being able to feel where you are on the &gt;keyboard by touch alone is a *bad* thing?</p><p>I&apos;m sure they aren&apos;t. Then again, a harpist doesn&apos;t have anything they can *feel* differently on all those strings, but with practice they find the right ones.</p><p>&gt;You seem to be arguing that no one should DO anything except keep sitting &gt;at their<br/>&gt;desks writing theory papers and making MIDI files while nature takes its &gt;course.</p><p>I won&apos;t actually speak for Rick, but he&apos;s been involved in this music for a long time, most commonly creating non12 music for theatrical and dance productions. NO ONE on this list would argue against making music (if you&apos;ll allow that in any form), as it is the reason this list exists. Do keep in mind that live performance is one area of microtonality - I&apos;m a performing person, and that is my focus and livelihood. Some people around here aren&apos;t performers, but create music to be listened to.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t expect everyone to get behind a specific system, but it would sure &gt;help if at least SOME people got together behind SOME system for a long &gt;enough time to establish it as a viable alternative to 12.  How will &gt;anything evolve if no one is pushing for it?</p><p>Hmmm. You aren&apos;t really thinking this hasn&apos;t occurred, are you? As just one example, there is Joe Maneri. He has been working in 72tet for a number of decades, and through his work at the New England Conservatory (and the jazz environments of Boston and NY) has developed not only a body of work, but a group of dedicated students, performers, and composers all thinking along the same lines. Music composed, performed, written about in important journals :( - the whole nine yards. If you don&apos;t believe me, check out the Boston Microtonal Society:</p><p><a href="http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/Pages/OpeningFrameset.html">http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/Pages/OpeningFrameset.html</a></p><p>Johnny Reinhard, with the American Festival of Microtonal Music, has created a place for composers to present their works for over 20 years. Johnny is broad in his tastes, and likes all (I guess) tunings. See his group at:</p><p><a href="http://www.afmm.org/">http://www.afmm.org/</a></p><p>Not to mention, right in your neighborhood, the Just Intonation Network. David Doty and others have been dedicating their activities for many years to the exploration of *that* particular branch of microtonality. While long periods may go by without active concertizing, I&apos;d urge you to note their information on the upcoming 20th anniversary music festival this spring - especially their focus on building both public awareness and building performance groups. JIN is at:</p><p><a href="http://www.justintonation.net/">http://www.justintonation.net/</a></p><p>This is just off the top of my head, but remember: 12tet is just one thing, *non12* is _everything_ else. Is it any wonder it is scattered? While Harry Partch may have settled on one particular tuning, did Lou Harrison have to settle on just one tuning to make a lasting (and beautiful) body of music on this world? And with his own hand-built gamelans to perform it?</p><p>No, there probably won&apos;t be any new monolithic systems. You need to find what works for you, dig in, and make it happen.</p><p>&gt;If I so happen to like 22-equal, and I want to make a bid at bringing this &gt;tuning into the cultural consciousness by means of specialized instruments &gt;(not to mention by forming an ensemble to use them), is that wrong?</p><p>No. After any consideration to the advice you&apos;ve received here and elsewhere, you should just go off and Do It. With blazing passion, too!</p><p>&gt;Music is so much more than an abstract art.  It is a form of communication &gt;that can be deeper than any human language.  It can change lives.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find anyone arguing with you on that. As I mentioned before, I happen to be a performer. But to be a fair and compassionate person, I&apos;ve had to make myself realize that everyone who loves music may not actually _play_, and it is unfair to consider that they care for music less than you or I.</p><p>&gt;I mean, I don&apos;t expect that I&apos;m going to change the world.</p><p>But I hope you think you can.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s got to start somewhere, right?</p><p>We&apos;re looking to people like yourself.</p><p>&gt;Either way, I&apos;m not going to post asking for any more opinions on a &gt;specialized 22-equal keyboard.  It&apos;s been made abundantly clear that I &gt;will get no constructive criticism here.</p><p>I hope I&apos;ve been able to shed some light on the commentaries you&apos;ve received, and to slightly convince you that this group is on your side if your intent is to make microtonal music. I&apos;ve got to leave you with one final thought (and pardon me, fellow MMM&apos;rs, who know this all too well).</p><p>I got into this thing through the music of Harry Partch. And, to be more exact, through the *person* of Harry Partch (see: <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/how.html">http://www.corporeal.com/how.html</a> ). Think about something: you can sit down at a computer, start Googling on microtonality, and come up with a lot of links to information, people, groups, forums, music, concerts... a world of stuff that has gone on and *is* going on with non12 music.</p><p>Now go back to the 1920&apos;s when all there was was... 12tet. And someone felt they needed something else. And how hard it must have been to find out what that *Something* might be.</p><p>&quot;That Harry Partch is no ordinary person is obvious. If his accomplishments in music had been slight, perhaps it could all end here -- but on the contrary, his accomplishments have been considerable. Anyone who has sat in a room, surrounded by Partch&apos;s many instruments, and listened to his music -- this complete and, to many, alien world of sound and drama -- knows what an intimidating experience this can be. The very thought of adopting a philosophical position diametrically opposed to a well-entrenched existing tradition, building a theory of tonal relationships and the instruments to realize this theory, composing the music, staging the drama, rehearsing and bringing it all to performance, recording the result -- all in the face of an uncomprehending public -- and then having the perseverance (perhaps obstinacy would be a better word) to continue all this for the better part of a lifetime, is a staggering thing to contemplate. Perhaps it is not so staggering if you consider Harry Partch&apos;s ideas about music. Partch and his music are very close to being one and the same thing.&quot;<br/>- Arthur Woodbury</p><p>Igliashon, I sincerely hope you are &quot;no ordinary person&quot;. I hope that you and your music are strong enough for the staggering task you set for yourself. It sounds like you are, and only time will tell.</p><p>With great respect for what we all wish to do,<br/>And the best wishes for your path,<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8415 href="#8415">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2005 3:33:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Jacob,</p><p>Please, allow me to clarify myself a little.  I did not mean to<br/>suggest that the whole community get behind one tuning system.<br/>That&apos;d be like making the 12-equal mistake all over again.  But right<br/>now no one is really pushing for any tuning in specific, except for<br/>maybe Neil Havestick and John Starrett for 19-equal.  Yasser had a<br/>good philosophy of it, IMHO, when he spoke of 19-equal being a good<br/>starting point to immediately increase the tonal resources available<br/>to musicians.  I&apos;d probably be a 19-toner as well, since there is a<br/>pretty large base for it, but I just like 22-equal so damn much.</p><p>I think I may have been a little harsh towards the group, it&apos;s just<br/>that so far most people have been only expressing one thought on my<br/>design: scrap it and get a general keyboard.  I know everyone is just<br/>trying to help and they think I&apos;m making a mistake putting this much<br/>emphasis on one tuning system, but I&apos;ve already made my mind up as to<br/>the route that I want to take.  I think things are also getting a<br/>little heated in this forum, not just with me but with that<br/>whole &quot;accordion wars&quot; thing, and the last thing I want is freakin&apos;<br/>flame war.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Honestly, folks, there is no perfect system.  Yet at this point<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; the musical development of our culture, ANY alternative is a good<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm. Must we make up our minds? I like the notion of Johnny<br/>&gt; Reinhard&apos;s polymicrotonality and the coexistence of different<br/>&gt; systems.  I recall reading a snippet about him on 31-tone bassoon<br/>&gt; doubling Jon Catler in 7-equal or something; perhaps the<br/>alternative<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be happiest with would be the union of all conceivable tuning<br/>&gt; systems. We are limited only by what we are able to hear. (Of<br/>course,<br/>&gt; this is the worst for fixed-pitch beasts like keyboards!, but I was<br/>&gt; thinking maybe a clavichord where the keys are completely moveable,<br/>&gt; or something along the lines of Aaron Hunt&apos;s gooseplex or tonal<br/>&gt; plexus)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I must clarify. I like to think of clean versus messy<br/>&gt; microtonality. Clean is well-defined, consciously created systems,<br/>&gt; each perhaps with their own characteristic sound reflecting their<br/>&gt; unique construction.  Messy is free pitch, relying excessively on<br/>&gt; your ears, and *perhaps* not caring so much that this or that note<br/>be<br/>&gt; right where you planned it; messy is perhaps its own characteristic<br/>&gt; sound. Of course, both are of great value musically, and both are<br/>&gt; equally tricky to get at.  With clean, you often need further<br/>&gt; technical apparatus; with dirty you need more familiarity with<br/>&gt; whatever instrument, it would seem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where was I?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, but what is easiest for people? One clean system? Perhaps,<br/>though<br/>&gt; I fear the one we have gives enough people ample trouble. Two clean<br/>&gt; systems?  To me, this is only an (inductive) hop away from all<br/>&gt; systems! The building block of any scale at all is the interval,<br/>and<br/>&gt; if folks can get a grasp on a reasonable interval resolution, a<br/>world<br/>&gt; of scales comes into reach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the question is what most people can quickly comprehend, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know.  It took me less than a year to internalize the basics and<br/>&gt; begin to draw my own conclusions, and that&apos;s short in proportion to<br/>&gt; my musical life thus far. If this is all it takes for the average<br/>&gt; musician, I would try and convince every musician I know to undergo<br/>a<br/>&gt; microtonal quest... to become capable of at least an intellectual<br/>&gt; understanding of any tuning. Though it&apos;s undoubtably harder for<br/>some.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although no matter how perfectly a pianist understands 22 equal,<br/>&gt; he&apos;ll still need a special keyboard. Oy. Pardon my irrelevance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you guys underestimate the importance of having a well-<br/>&gt; &gt; implemented music system that is understood and utilized by a<br/>large<br/>&gt; &gt; number of people.  Part of the joy of music is playing it with<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; people.  There are few things I find more exhilirating than a<br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; jam session.  How many of you have experienced the feeling of<br/>total<br/>&gt; &gt; spiritual connection that comes via musical dialogue with others?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not me so much :(. But may I ask how much this spiritual connection<br/>&gt; relies on the criterion that the parties involved are in the same<br/>&gt; tuning system, i.e. &quot;speaking the same language&quot;?  My only<br/>&gt; polymicrotonal jam session involved two musical saws, turntable,<br/>and<br/>&gt; some weird electronics. The connection was dubious.  Anyone else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And if there is not at least some large-scale acceptance<br/>&gt; &gt; of your tuning, you&apos;re pretty much S.O.L. unless you can convince<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; few friends to shell out big bucks to modify their own<br/>instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re going for clean microtonality, this is more true. But<br/>worth<br/>&gt; considering, especially financially, is the necessity-driven<br/>&gt; creativity of the dirty mind. Take a ukelele, tune pairs of strings<br/>&gt; quartertones apart, or tune whole thing to a 7-limit tetrad, wham!<br/>&gt; Instant xenharmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Either way, I&apos;m not going to<br/>&gt; &gt; post asking for any more opinions on a specialized 22-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard.  It&apos;s been made abundantly clear that I will get no<br/>&gt; &gt; constructive criticism here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry we couldn&apos;t be helpful.  I just thought to mention one thing<br/>&gt; about keyboards that I like. It has to do with touch.<br/>Specifically,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s nice to be able to bang out a pan-diatonic something-or-other<br/>on<br/>&gt; the white keys of a piano.  And I would absolutely love to have<br/>that<br/>&gt; same bangability on a porcupine.

I think you&apos;ve got me.  Indeed I suppose I have<br/>underestimated this forum.</p><p>But let me clarify just a little of what I meant (for the internet is<br/>the most ferile ground for misunderstanding that I have yet<br/>encountered).  I never meant that the whole microtonal world should<br/>unite around a single system.  That would be ridiculous.  I know<br/>everyone here has different ideas, and for most everyone here (myself<br/>included!) multiple tuning systems are required and thus are<br/>generalized designs.  Not to mention that I&apos;m sure you are correct<br/>that everyone who makes their way here has their own ideas on how to<br/>reinvent the wheel (I must be a classic example of this).</p><p>I think the reason I am so stuck on this is that I am actually a<br/>*fan* of limitation.  When faced with the infinity of possibilities<br/>in the microtonal world, I am daunted, and my creativity drops<br/>through the floor.  It becomes so easy to get lost in theorizing and<br/>never to get any music made.  Unless I narrow it down to a tiny<br/>subset of possibilities, I will spend my life making &apos;etudes&apos; in<br/>every tuning system.</p><p>I don&apos;t want the world to go from one fascist musical regime to<br/>another.  I want the world to open up to more possibilities.  And I<br/>know damn well that I have no control over that, and there&apos;s not a<br/>whole lot I can do except throw my 10 cents into the pond.  In<br/>setting out to change the world, I do not expect to accomplish it, or<br/>even to make a dent.  But I want to start building the possibilities.</p><p>So far it takes a special breed of person to become interested in<br/>microtonality.  It really is amazing that any of us are here at all,<br/>given the oppressive system that is in place with 12-equal.  But I<br/>think more people would be interested if there was some kind of<br/>a &quot;package&quot; that could be handed to them, a sort of seed that could<br/>be planted.  That&apos;s what I am trying to create.  Others are doing it<br/>with 19 (Haverstick and Starrett, Elaine Walker, Yasser, etc.), while<br/>others are doing it or have done it with JI (Jon Catler is the first<br/>to come to mind, and he&apos;s doing a hell of a job, too!).  Now I want<br/>to do it with 22.  Thankfully I have Paul Erlich&apos;s immense knowledge<br/>to draw on, and he has been extremely supportive of my ideas.<br/>Believe it or not, he actually thinks my first design is not only<br/>feasible but a good ideal for the tuning.</p><p>But I digress.</p><p>You must remember that I am a guitar player, and there is<br/>no &quot;generalized guitar&quot;, except perhaps a fretless.  Microtonal<br/>guitars are already fairly easy to acquire, but microtonal keyboards<br/>are another beast altogether.  The generalized design is pretty much<br/>the only thing going right now in that field, and there is good<br/>reason for that.  I do not dispute this.  I have no argument against<br/>the design, and in fact the only reason I am trying to develop an<br/>alternative at this point is because I am starting an ensemble, and<br/>Stevie wants to start with a specialized instrument to help him<br/>become familiar with the tuning.</p><p>Kraig, I like both the ideas you linked to (the modulus-22 and the 5-<br/>12-5), but they both seem to have their problems.  I&apos;m trying to make<br/>a synthesis of those two ideas, something that will minimize the<br/>difficulties by compromizing the two extremes.  The designs I put up<br/>are not my final product, they&apos;re just ideas I&apos;m throwing out.  The<br/>reason I said I&apos;m getting &quot;no constructive criticism&quot; is because so<br/>far most of the people commenting have dismissed the idea of a<br/>specialized keyboard out of hand and told me that general is the way<br/>to go, and that I should stop wasting my time.  I don&apos;t consider that<br/>constructive.</p><p>However, you have just given me some darn good ideas, and you have<br/>made a lot of good points.  Somehow my initial request for friendly<br/>critiques turned into a huge battle between my self-important<br/>idealism and the well-established and experienced traditionalism of<br/>you older guys.  I never meant for it to blow up like this.</p><p>Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to hammer out a design soon that meets the<br/>expressed criticism and yet still fits Stevie&apos;s criteria.  I think<br/>something based on the modulus-22 that involves rows of keys at<br/>different heights will be able to provide the tactile landmarks he<br/>desires, and will preserve a certain type of uniformity.  Though I<br/>think the only way to really preserve the uniformity of the general<br/>keyboard is to have rows an octave deep as well as several octaves<br/>long.

Do I have my head on backwards?  Should<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;just be content to sit back and wait for everyone to have their<br/>own<br/>&gt; &gt;epiphanies (as I did) and come trickling into this forum seeking<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;same things I have?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;  Why not. Why do you care what they do, it is what YOU do that<br/>matters.<br/>&gt; The problem is that even if this your concern, everyone who comes<br/>to it<br/>&gt; feels that everyone else who has been doing it has doing it wrong,<br/>&gt; otherwise the whole world would be doing the same thing.

There is and<br/>have<br/>&gt; been many very brilliant people who have thought out these problems<br/>&gt; quite extensively. At this point  (nothing would make me happier to<br/>be<br/>&gt; disproved in this statement, really) I think things have developed<br/>&gt; beyond the point that  one is not going to make their mark in the<br/>&gt; fundamentals in this field. There are ample amounts of scales, and<br/>&gt; designs to choose from we all know that at this point of the game<br/>the<br/>&gt; idea of a single tuning is not going to happen ,nor is it even a<br/>good<br/>&gt; idea. The only way to make such a thing come about is by musical<br/>fascism<br/>&gt; and force people into a single choice. If such a decision comes<br/>about ,<br/>&gt; it cannot be made by the theory , it has to be made by how music<br/>&gt; actually grows, not how we think it is going to grow. The idea of<br/>&gt; &apos;musical evolution&apos; is dangerous, for it leads to the idea that<br/>music<br/>&gt; has an ultimate goal, which in term means any deviation from this<br/>is<br/>&gt; wrong. To prevent these wrong steps one has to use force of some<br/>kinds<br/>&gt; or just dismiss all other alternatives.

Take all of the<br/>&gt; following in that particular positive light.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;I think all of you have missed a point, right from the get go. All<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;wanted was a specialized 22-note keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I certainly understood the point. I also note the opening comments<br/>from you<br/>&gt; in the two main threads on this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #1. &quot;Any comments on the design are welcome, as are any suggestions<br/>on<br/>&gt; building one in real life (materials we should use, etc.).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #2. &quot;All in all, I think it&apos;s a decent blend between innovation and<br/>&gt; tradition. What do y&apos;all think?  Might this one be serviceable?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You really did solicit peoples opinions and ideas, and you are<br/>addressing a<br/>&gt; crowd that has had more than the usual experience with the<br/>difficulties of<br/>&gt; trying to coax non12 music out of a 12centric world. Even when<br/>there was<br/>&gt; in-depth talk in support of something a little different - say, the<br/>&gt; generalized kbd area - it was (knowing these people) from the<br/>standpoint of<br/>&gt; attempting a solution that might yield even more than you hoped<br/>for. No one<br/>&gt; would wish you ill if you went your own way and built a 22tet only<br/>kbd, and<br/>&gt; we&apos;d look forward to the results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Nor do I see anyone addressing my argument for tactile landmarks.<br/>Are you<br/>&gt; &gt;all honestly telling me that being able to feel where you are on<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;keyboard by touch alone is a *bad* thing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sure they aren&apos;t. Then again, a harpist doesn&apos;t have anything<br/>they can<br/>&gt; *feel* differently on all those strings, but with practice they<br/>find the<br/>&gt; right ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;You seem to be arguing that no one should DO anything except keep<br/>sitting<br/>&gt; &gt;at their<br/>&gt; &gt;desks writing theory papers and making MIDI files while nature<br/>takes its<br/>&gt; &gt;course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t actually speak for Rick, but he&apos;s been involved in this<br/>music for a<br/>&gt; long time, most commonly creating non12 music for theatrical and<br/>dance<br/>&gt; productions. NO ONE on this list would argue against making music<br/>(if<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll allow that in any form), as it is the reason this list<br/>exists. Do<br/>&gt; keep in mind that live performance is one area of microtonality -<br/>I&apos;m a<br/>&gt; performing person, and that is my focus and livelihood. Some people<br/>around<br/>&gt; here aren&apos;t performers, but create music to be listened to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t expect everyone to get behind a specific system, but it<br/>would sure<br/>&gt; &gt;help if at least SOME people got together behind SOME system for a<br/>long<br/>&gt; &gt;enough time to establish it as a viable alternative to 12.  How<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt;anything evolve if no one is pushing for it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmm. You aren&apos;t really thinking this hasn&apos;t occurred, are you? As<br/>just one<br/>&gt; example, there is Joe Maneri. He has been working in 72tet for a<br/>number of<br/>&gt; decades, and through his work at the New England Conservatory (and<br/>the jazz<br/>&gt; environments of Boston and NY) has developed not only a body of<br/>work, but a<br/>&gt; group of dedicated students, performers, and composers all thinking<br/>along<br/>&gt; the same lines. Music composed, performed, written about in<br/>important<br/>&gt; journals :( - the whole nine yards. If you don&apos;t believe me, check<br/>out the<br/>&gt; Boston Microtonal Society:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/Pages/OpeningFrameset.html">http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/Pages/OpeningFrameset.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard, with the American Festival of Microtonal Music,<br/>has<br/>&gt; created a place for composers to present their works for over 20<br/>years.<br/>&gt; Johnny is broad in his tastes, and likes all (I guess) tunings. See<br/>his<br/>&gt; group at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.afmm.org/">http://www.afmm.org/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not to mention, right in your neighborhood, the Just Intonation<br/>Network.<br/>&gt; David Doty and others have been dedicating their activities for<br/>many years<br/>&gt; to the exploration of *that* particular branch of microtonality.<br/>While long<br/>&gt; periods may go by without active concertizing, I&apos;d urge you to note<br/>their<br/>&gt; information on the upcoming 20th anniversary music festival this<br/>spring -<br/>&gt; especially their focus on building both public awareness and<br/>building<br/>&gt; performance groups. JIN is at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.justintonation.net/">http://www.justintonation.net/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is just off the top of my head, but remember: 12tet is just<br/>one thing,<br/>&gt; *non12* is _everything_ else. Is it any wonder it is scattered?<br/>While Harry<br/>&gt; Partch may have settled on one particular tuning, did Lou Harrison<br/>have to<br/>&gt; settle on just one tuning to make a lasting (and beautiful) body of<br/>music<br/>&gt; on this world? And with his own hand-built gamelans to perform it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, there probably won&apos;t be any new monolithic systems. You need to<br/>find<br/>&gt; what works for you, dig in, and make it happen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If I so happen to like 22-equal, and I want to make a bid at<br/>bringing this<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning into the cultural consciousness by means of specialized<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; &gt;(not to mention by forming an ensemble to use them), is that wrong?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. After any consideration to the advice you&apos;ve received here and<br/>&gt; elsewhere, you should just go off and Do It. With blazing passion,<br/>too!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Music is so much more than an abstract art.  It is a form of<br/>communication<br/>&gt; &gt;that can be deeper than any human language.  It can change lives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find anyone arguing with you on that. As I<br/>mentioned<br/>&gt; before, I happen to be a performer. But to be a fair and<br/>compassionate<br/>&gt; person, I&apos;ve had to make myself realize that everyone who loves<br/>music may<br/>&gt; not actually _play_, and it is unfair to consider that they care<br/>for music<br/>&gt; less than you or I.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I mean, I don&apos;t expect that I&apos;m going to change the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I hope you think you can.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s got to start somewhere, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re looking to people like yourself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Either way, I&apos;m not going to post asking for any more opinions on<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;specialized 22-equal keyboard.  It&apos;s been made abundantly clear<br/>that I<br/>&gt; &gt;will get no constructive criticism here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope I&apos;ve been able to shed some light on the commentaries you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; received, and to slightly convince you that this group is on your<br/>side if<br/>&gt; your intent is to make microtonal music. I&apos;ve got to leave you with<br/>one<br/>&gt; final thought (and pardon me, fellow MMM&apos;rs, who know this all too<br/>well).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got into this thing through the music of Harry Partch. And, to be<br/>more<br/>&gt; exact, through the *person* of Harry Partch (see:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/how.html">http://www.corporeal.com/how.html</a> ). Think about something: you can<br/>sit<br/>&gt; down at a computer, start Googling on microtonality, and come up<br/>with a lot<br/>&gt; of links to information, people, groups, forums, music, concerts...<br/>a world<br/>&gt; of stuff that has gone on and *is* going on with non12 music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now go back to the 1920&apos;s when all there was was... 12tet. And<br/>someone felt<br/>&gt; they needed something else. And how hard it must have been to find<br/>out what<br/>&gt; that *Something* might be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;That Harry Partch is no ordinary person is obvious. If his<br/>accomplishments<br/>&gt; in music had been slight, perhaps it could all end here -- but on<br/>the<br/>&gt; contrary, his accomplishments have been considerable. Anyone who<br/>has sat in<br/>&gt; a room, surrounded by Partch&apos;s many instruments, and listened to<br/>his music<br/>&gt; -- this complete and, to many, alien world of sound and drama --<br/>knows what<br/>&gt; an intimidating experience this can be. The very thought of<br/>adopting a<br/>&gt; philosophical position diametrically opposed to a well-entrenched<br/>existing<br/>&gt; tradition, building a theory of tonal relationships and the<br/>instruments to<br/>&gt; realize this theory, composing the music, staging the drama,<br/>rehearsing and<br/>&gt; bringing it all to performance, recording the result -- all in the<br/>face of<br/>&gt; an uncomprehending public -- and then having the perseverance<br/>(perhaps<br/>&gt; obstinacy would be a better word) to continue all this for the<br/>better part<br/>&gt; of a lifetime, is a staggering thing to contemplate. Perhaps it is<br/>not so<br/>&gt; staggering if you consider Harry Partch&apos;s ideas about music. Partch<br/>and his<br/>&gt; music are very close to being one and the same thing.&quot;<br/>&gt; - Arthur Woodbury<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igliashon, I sincerely hope you are &quot;no ordinary person&quot;. I hope<br/>that you<br/>&gt; and your music are strong enough for the staggering task you set<br/>for<br/>&gt; yourself. It sounds like you are, and only time will tell.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With great respect for what we all wish to do,<br/>&gt; And the best wishes for your path,<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt; Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8419 href="#8419">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

Harry Partch is my hero.  The importance of his<br/>&gt; works is simply inexpressible, and I would give nearly anything if I<br/>&gt; could have known him when he was alive.  It is his spirit I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; trying to evoke, for much like him I have ideas that I want to bring<br/>&gt; to the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just that the response I got from a few people here did not seem<br/>&gt; either positive or encouraging.  When I asked for criticism, I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; expect to be told that I should completely reject the idea of a<br/>&gt; specialized keyboard.  That, to me, is a little beyond the realm of<br/>&gt; criticism.  That is a condemnation, and I was not expecting it from<br/>&gt; anyone here.  I know it was made with the best intentions, and I know<br/>&gt; it was probably the result of my own ambiguity, but it struck me in a<br/>&gt; rather harsh way.  I know I&apos;m young and EXTREMELY inexperienced<br/>&gt; compared to almost everyone else here, but I don&apos;t like being talked<br/>&gt; down to, and that&apos;s what it felt like.  Perhaps it is due to the<br/>&gt; impersonal ambiguity of internet forums; misunderstandings are so<br/>&gt; easy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to make it clear that I did not mean to devalue the<br/>&gt; contributions of anyone here.  I know that there is much that has<br/>&gt; been built, and that I am a very late arrival to the field.  All I<br/>&gt; have are vauge impressions of everyone here, and I am regrettably<br/>&gt; ignorant about what everyone here has done.  If I have made wrongful<br/>&gt; estimations of anyone, I cannot apologize enough.  I should now<br/>&gt; acknowledge what I have failed to before: everyone has an important<br/>&gt; role to play, and my self-importance about my own role (that of the<br/>&gt; rebellious performer) has been getting in the way of constructive<br/>&gt; discourse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no right to demean anyone here.  We are all in the same boat,<br/>&gt; more or less, and we need to stick together.  Some of my comments<br/>&gt; have been overly harsh, and for that I apologize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps, if it please the forum, I may post another design attempt,<br/>&gt; one that is closer to finished.

Except that I think I may<br/>have given myself an inappropriate characterization--I&apos;m not married<br/>to 22.  I completely agree with you that every tuning system has its<br/>own special and unique character.  I&apos;ve become a huge fan of 15<br/>lately, as well as 26 and 29.  My goal is to amass a Darregian<br/>arsenal of many differently-tempered guitars.  I&apos;ve had an idea to<br/>also make a fretless guitar with different-colored fret lines for<br/>multiple less harmonic systems, most likely 14 and 20 EDO (I&apos;ve been<br/>listening to a lot of Dan Stearns lately, and he&apos;s really sold me on<br/>these tunings).  So I myself will likely be acquiring a general<br/>keyboard some day as well, since there are at least a few groups who<br/>are developing them for sale.  For the purpose of playing in multiple<br/>systems, I indeed think that is the ideal design, and since I&apos;m not a<br/>keyboard player anyway I think it&apos;d suit me just fine.</p><p>But there&apos;s a difference between my own personal experimentation and<br/>what I want to do with an ensemble.  I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that<br/>it would simplify my efforts to get a group together if I based the<br/>group on one specific tuning, and after much analysis I&apos;ve decided 22<br/>is ideal for that goal.  I think 22 is the most perfect compromise<br/>tuning for what I want to do, since it contains a vast wealth of<br/>tonalities (diatonic, decatonic, and porcupine to name my top 3<br/>faves), has a broad spectrum of consonance and dissonance, and does<br/>good approximations of several JI intervals up to an 11 limit, all<br/>while keeping the number of notes very manageable.  It&apos;s the kind of<br/>tuning that I can see people getting into.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m so gung-ho<br/>about it.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

I admire and envy you that 22 speaks to you so much<br/>that you<br/>&gt; want to dig into it deeply enough to make instruments based on it<br/>and only on<br/>&gt; it, but I can understand that those of us who love *all* tunings<br/>might be<br/>&gt; personally shy to the idea of boxing ourselves in to one and only<br/>one tuning.<br/>&gt; I would not take this personally, and if you&apos;ve found a complete<br/>marriage<br/>&gt; with 22 compelling, by all means, commit to it unreservedly! ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good luck on you endeavors, and let me know what the final design<br/>will be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Aaron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thursday 06 January 2005 07:14 am, Igliashon Jones wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Mr. Szanto,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It may be that I am horribly sleep-deprived and thus emotional<br/>right<br/>&gt; &gt; now, but you nearly brought a tear to my eyes.

If I have nothing else it is passion, which I hope is<br/>&gt; &gt; apparent by now.  Harry Partch is my hero.

When I asked for criticism, I<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; expect to be told that I should completely reject the idea of a<br/>&gt; &gt; specialized keyboard.  That, to me, is a little beyond the realm<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; criticism.  That is a condemnation, and I was not expecting it<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone here.  I know it was made with the best intentions, and I<br/>know<br/>&gt; &gt; it was probably the result of my own ambiguity, but it struck me<br/>in a<br/>&gt; &gt; rather harsh way.  I know I&apos;m young and EXTREMELY inexperienced<br/>&gt; &gt; compared to almost everyone else here, but I don&apos;t like being<br/>talked<br/>&gt; &gt; down to, and that&apos;s what it felt like.  Perhaps it is due to the<br/>&gt; &gt; impersonal ambiguity of internet forums; misunderstandings are so<br/>&gt; &gt; easy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would like to make it clear that I did not mean to devalue the<br/>&gt; &gt; contributions of anyone here.  I know that there is much that has<br/>&gt; &gt; been built, and that I am a very late arrival to the field.  All I<br/>&gt; &gt; have are vauge impressions of everyone here, and I am regrettably<br/>&gt; &gt; ignorant about what everyone here has done.  If I have made<br/>wrongful<br/>&gt; &gt; estimations of anyone, I cannot apologize enough.  I should now<br/>&gt; &gt; acknowledge what I have failed to before: everyone has an<br/>important<br/>&gt; &gt; role to play, and my self-importance about my own role (that of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; rebellious performer) has been getting in the way of constructive<br/>&gt; &gt; discourse.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have no right to demean anyone here.  We are all in the same<br/>boat,<br/>&gt; &gt; more or less, and we need to stick together.  Some of my comments<br/>&gt; &gt; have been overly harsh, and for that I apologize.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps, if it please the forum, I may post another design<br/>attempt,<br/>&gt; &gt; one that is closer to finished.  Or maybe a couple of different<br/>&gt; &gt; ideas, just to get some perspective on them?  Hopefully everyone<br/>&gt; &gt; understands now what I am trying to accomplish, that I&apos;m trying to<br/>&gt; &gt; sort of establish &quot;my&quot; own sort of system (though it is based<br/>HEAVILY<br/>&gt; &gt; on the ideas of others), and that my approach is different from<br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonalists.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Igliashon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=8427 href="#8427">ðŸ”—</a>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2005 1:12:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;<br/>igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So I myself will likely be acquiring a general<br/>&gt; keyboard some day as well, since there are at least a few groups who<br/>&gt; are developing them for sale.  For the purpose of playing in multiple<br/>&gt; systems, I indeed think that is the ideal design, and since I&apos;m not a<br/>&gt; keyboard player anyway I think it&apos;d suit me just fine.</p><p>But wait. Here&apos;s one idea of mine that I hope to pursue. An alternating<br/>black/white keyboard in which various black-white configurations could<br/>be made by pushing un-needed keys into the instrument, out of sight.<br/>The feel would probably be substantially different; the keys might be<br/>more like drawbars. What do you think?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there&apos;s a difference between my own personal experimentation and<br/>&gt; what I want to do with an ensemble.</p><p>Aha! Me too. In personal experimentation I&apos;ve hit up equal tunings from<br/>1 to 19. See foum [complete] and Moods on my Fun with Xenharmonicity<br/>page. In real life I&apos;ve been slower getting off the ground.  Last<br/>spring I tried 72-tet in this cool composing-performing class they have<br/>at Rice.  We&apos;re talking basically strings and clarinet.  The strings<br/>had a hard time hearing that micro so quickly, and/or making sense of<br/>any of it.  I made this webpage &lt;<a href="http://brown-1111.brown.rice.edu/~jb/">http://brown-1111.brown.rice.edu/~jb/</a><br/>ooks/&gt; but that didn&apos;t do much good unfortunately.  All I ended up<br/>doing with 72-edo was some silly harmonic series scale doodling - not<br/>worth it! Recording of that someday.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that<br/>&gt; it would simplify my efforts to get a group together if I based the<br/>&gt; group on one specific tuning, and after much analysis I&apos;ve decided 22<br/>&gt; is ideal for that goal.  I think 22 is the most perfect compromise<br/>&gt; tuning for what I want to do, since it contains a vast wealth of<br/>&gt; tonalities (diatonic, decatonic, and porcupine to name my top 3<br/>&gt; faves), has a broad spectrum of consonance and dissonance, and does<br/>&gt; good approximations of several JI intervals up to an 11 limit, all<br/>&gt; while keeping the number of notes very manageable.  It&apos;s the kind of<br/>&gt; tuning that I can see people getting into.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m so gung-ho<br/>&gt; about it.</p><p>My gung-ho choice for tuning is 31. Mainly I got attached to the<br/>thirds. A large historical trend - see the Huygens-Fokker foundation,<br/>if that ain&apos;t a push for one tuning, I don&apos;t know what is. Also, Johnny<br/>Reinhard has online bassoon fingerings for it, which I wrote out in<br/>index cards and did one short solo piece so far but hope to eventually<br/>churn out an entire 31-tone bassoon method book with duets and quartets<br/>and all the modes fit to print. Wooo! I&apos;m hoping to get that same<br/>ensemble this semester to do 31.  But if there are a lot of strings, it<br/>might be easier to do a more pythagorean 22 for them, huh?</p><p>Which theoretical idea do you think would be more imposing on normal<br/>theory? 1) Exaggerating the difference between the pythagorean and just<br/>major thirds, writing them as two separate notes (22), or 2) Meantone<br/>with its thirds-mandated flat fifths (31)? Let&apos;s all go out and try one<br/>or the other on our unenlightened friends and figure this out.</p></div><h3><a id=8429 href="#8429">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2005 4:42:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;You must remember that I am a guitar player, and there is &gt;no &quot;generalized guitar&quot;, except perhaps a fretless. &gt;<br/>actually a guitar is a genralized pattern. look how the bar chords are transposed up and down the neck</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Kraig, I like both the ideas you linked to (the modulus-22 and the 5-<br/>&gt;12-5), but they both seem to have their problems.  I&apos;m trying to make &gt;a synthesis of those two ideas, something that will minimize the &gt;difficulties by compromizing the two extremes. &gt;<br/>Let me just state these are not my ideas. You asked for examples of some genralized 22 tone patterns and i grabbed some that were immediately available. I BTW on my 22 tone instruments used neither one of these and there is absolutely no way that the one i do use could i have gotten to by strickly  theoretical means.<br/>   For me i would have to start with exactly what type of instrument i was going to build, out of what mechanism, size etc. Then i would see which layouts would work best.

Just some assumptions  about the bosanquet i felt were not quite true.</p><p>&gt;Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to hammer out a design soon that meets the &gt;expressed criticism and yet still fits Stevie&apos;s criteria.  I think &gt;something based on the modulus-22 that involves rows of keys at &gt;different heights will be able to provide the tactile landmarks he &gt;desires, and will preserve a certain type of uniformity.  Though I &gt;think the only way to really preserve the uniformity of the general &gt;keyboard is to have rows an octave deep as well as several octaves &gt;long.

Do I have my head on backwards?  Should &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;I &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;just be content to sit back and wait for everyone to have their &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;own &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;epiphanies (as I did) and come trickling into this forum seeking &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;the &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;same things I have?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why not. Why do you care what they do, it is what YOU do that &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;matters. &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The problem is that even if this your concern, everyone who comes  &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;to it &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;feels that everyone else who has been doing it has doing it wrong, &gt;&gt;otherwise the whole world would be doing the same thing. What this &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;has &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;lead to is each person comes in and reinvents the wheel, this has &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;slowed &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;things down with mircotonality more than anything. There is and &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;have &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;been many very brilliant people who have thought out these problems &gt;&gt;quite extensively. At this point  (nothing would make me happier to &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;be &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;disproved in this statement, really) I think things have developed &gt;&gt;beyond the point that  one is not going to make their mark in the &gt;&gt;fundamentals in this field. There are ample amounts of scales, and &gt;&gt;designs to choose from we all know that at this point of the game &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;the &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;idea of a single tuning is not going to happen ,nor is it even a &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;good &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;idea. The only way to make such a thing come about is by musical &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;fascism &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;and force people into a single choice. If such a decision comes &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;about , &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;it cannot be made by the theory , it has to be made by how music &gt;&gt;actually grows, not how we think it is going to grow. The idea of &gt;&gt;&apos;musical evolution&apos; is dangerous, for it leads to the idea that &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;music &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;has an ultimate goal, which in term means any deviation from this &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;is &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;wrong. To prevent these wrong steps one has to use force of some &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;kinds &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;or just dismiss all other alternatives. YOu can&apos;t even get those on &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;this &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;list to agree  which i guess in your case you would have to reject &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;all &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;of us as being &quot; lead astray in the wilderness&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you guys underestimate the importance of having a well-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;implemented music system that is understood and utilized by a &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;large &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;number of people. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I think you greatly underestimate all the thinking and living with &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;these &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;ideas the thousands before have done<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Part of the joy of music is playing it with other &gt;&gt;&gt;people.  There are few things I find more exhilirating than a good &gt;&gt;&gt;jam session.  How many of you have experienced the feeling of &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;total &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;spiritual connection that comes via musical dialogue with others?  &gt;&gt;&gt;Music is so much more than an abstract art.  It is a form of &gt;&gt;&gt;communication that can be deeper than any human language.  It can &gt;&gt;&gt;change lives.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; i would assume you are a fan of Cornelius Cardew or perhaps would &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;be.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why do you assume that any one on this list has not experienced &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;this?<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet you can&apos;t really experience that unless you have other people &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;to &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;play with.  And if there is not at least some large-scale &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;acceptance &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of your tuning, you&apos;re pretty much S.O.L. unless you can convince &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;a &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;few friends to shell out big bucks to modify their own instruments.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I mean, I don&apos;t expect that I&apos;m going to change the world.  It&apos;s &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;not &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;my intent to start a company to manufacture microtonal &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;instruments, &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;or to get microtonalism all over the news or any such thing.  I&apos;m &gt;&gt;&gt;merely trying to focus on establishing a base around one scale, so &gt;&gt;&gt;that those looking for an alternative to 12 will have more to draw &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;on &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;than a few research papers.  It&apos;s got to start somewhere, right?  &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You fail to acknowledge it has already started . It is everywhere &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;and &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;thousands are doing it<br/>&gt;&gt; and like other great musical traditions, it will be a verbal one &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;for &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;quite some time when it gets right down to it.<br/>&gt;&gt; Go ahead and pick YOUR base and let others decide from themselves<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;*sigh* perhaps I am wasting my breath.  Either way, I&apos;m not going &gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;to &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;post asking for any more opinions on a specialized 22-equal &gt;&gt;&gt;keyboard.

Look for instance George &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;and &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Harold and i all do and have done very different music.

I would surely be daunted to compose in it.  31<br/>is hard enough!</p><p>&gt; My gung-ho choice for tuning is 31. Mainly I got attached to the<br/>&gt; thirds.</p><p>Actually, 31 was originally my first choice, until I began thoroughly<br/>exploring it and other systems.  I still like it a whole lot (my 31-<br/>tone Gibson SG is quite fun to play, as well), as it is a very serene<br/>tuning, and I kind of consider it a complementary system to 22.  The<br/>whole reason I opted for 22 is because I find it pushes my playing in<br/>a more Xenharmonic direction.  31 seems to be perfect for 5-limit<br/>diatonic/meantone playing, so that&apos;s that groove I tend to fall in<br/>with it.  Though I&apos;m working on some 12- and 10-note scales for it<br/>that hopefully will push me out of that.</p><p>&gt;But if there are a lot of strings, it<br/>&gt; might be easier to do a more pythagorean 22 for them, huh?</p><p>Quite likely, if only because the smallest step size in 22 (54 cents)<br/>is much bigger than the smallest in 31 (38 cents), and will allow<br/>your strings to play chromatic behavior easier.  However, their ears<br/>might have an easier time with 31...</p><p>&gt; Which theoretical idea do you think would be more imposing on<br/>normal<br/>&gt; theory? 1) Exaggerating the difference between the pythagorean and<br/>just<br/>&gt; major thirds, writing them as two separate notes (22), or 2)<br/>Meantone<br/>&gt; with its thirds-mandated flat fifths (31)?</p><p>Well, both can be compatible with normal theory (though diatonic 22<br/>behavior favors the 7-non-5-limit 4 4 1 4 4 4 1 MOS major, which<br/>gives it an interesting character), and both contain both just and<br/>pythagorean-style major thirds, but in a blindfold test I think 22<br/>sounds more overtly xenharmonic.  31 is real easy to disguise, but 22<br/>almost always has that bizarre little twist that pricks up the ears<br/>of the &quot;uninitiated&quot;.  Though 31 can do that to, when used certain<br/>ways.  Hmm, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a pretty even split.

You asked for examples<br/>of<br/>&gt; some genralized 22 tone patterns and i grabbed some that were<br/>&gt; immediately available. I BTW on my 22 tone instruments used neither<br/>one<br/>&gt; of these and there is absolutely no way that the one i do use could<br/>i<br/>&gt; have gotten to by strickly  theoretical means.<br/>&gt;     For me i would have to start with exactly what type of<br/>instrument i<br/>&gt; was going to build, out of what mechanism, size etc. Then i would<br/>see<br/>&gt; which layouts would work best. I am overly practical in this way</p><p>That&apos;s actually how I&apos;m trying to approach it, as well.  Though not<br/>being an experienced instrument builder like yourself, I&apos;m sure I<br/>easily overlook things, which is why I came here for criticism in the<br/>first place.  I know I came off as opposed to the generalized design,<br/>but I&apos;m really not.  It just doesn&apos;t seem optimal for what I want to<br/>do with 22.  Any general arrangement that facilitates diatonics seems<br/>to make decatonics and porcupines difficult (and vice versa for the<br/>others).  That 22-lattice in the first Wilson paper you linked to is<br/>a great example of it: to play porcupine scales well, you would need<br/>the lattice to be almost as long vertically as it is horizontally.<br/>And Decatonic scales are pretty much all over that map.  My latest<br/>designs sidestep almost all of these problems, and also provide<br/>intuitive tactile and visual landmarks unique to each.

Since the generalized keyboard is made to play in also much<br/>&gt; larger tuning systems, I presume I could make a specialized<br/>keyboard<br/>&gt; simply by mapping it to 22 and then &quot;cutting away the fat&quot;, and<br/>then<br/>&gt; reshaping what is left into something with traditional key shapes.</p><p>While there is quite a bit of latitude for key shape and aspect ratio<br/>(more about this below), I have the feeling that what you&apos;re looking<br/>for is rectangular key shapes with perfectly horizontal and vertical<br/>sides.

Am I correct in assuming this?</p><p>You also mentioned tactile landmarks below.</p><p>Anything else?</p><p>&gt; George suggested that for 22 to be utilized effectively in a<br/>&gt; generalized design, you only need 9 repeat keys to keep a<br/>uniformity<br/>&gt; of voicing.</p><p>I said that I thought you could &quot;get by&quot; with 9 duplicates for<br/>uniformity of *fingering*, because that&apos;s how many I have had to make-<br/>do with on my Scalatron (which used 1975 technology).  Although there<br/>are 50 keys/octave on the instrument, 19 of these are permanently<br/>hard-wired as duplicates for 31-ET, that particular number,<br/>approximately 1.6 times 31, being arrived at by determining how many<br/>keys would be needed to play various microtonal scales and chords in<br/>all 31 keys with the same patterns.  When I&apos;m using a tuning of N<br/>tones with fewer than 31/octave (such as 19 or 22), my usable<br/>duplicates are limited to 31 minus N.  For 19-ET the 12 duplicates<br/>have proved completely satisfactory (12 being 19 times 1.6, rounded<br/>upward).</p><p>For 22-ET you could do quite a bit with 9 duplicates.  The instances<br/>where you&apos;d be coming up short would be in certain remote keys, so<br/>you might have to use some awkward alternate fingerings.  That&apos;s why<br/>I&apos;d consider 36 keys/octave optimal for 22.  But if you were building<br/>this yourself, I guess you could always add more duplicate keys later<br/>on.</p><p>&gt; Seeing as how this is less than 2 manuals, I would<br/>&gt; imagine I could use this subset to make a more compact and<br/>&gt; specialized version of the generalized design.</p><p>There&apos;s no &quot;official&quot; specification for how many keys/octave should<br/>be on a Bosanquet keyboard, nor how far apart the key centers should<br/>be along the x or y directions, nor what the x:y aspect ratio should<br/>be (all of which would influence the size and shape of the keys).  I<br/>would *strongly* recommend that keys an octave apart be at exactly<br/>the same position along the y-axis (unlike the Fokker keyboard), even<br/>though this causes the rows to slant.  But it&apos;s still possible for<br/>the rows to slant without having diagonal sides on the keys.</p><p>An example of a different x:y aspect ratio is in my design for a<br/>generalized accordion treble keyboard (with 2-cm round keys):</p><p><a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbAc19p3.gif</p><p>Something you should take note of in this diagram (as well as the<br/>others in my postings) is the vertical generator ruler immediately to<br/>the left of the lowest-pitch keys.  The key center for C lines up<br/>with 0G on the ruler, G is +1, D is +2, etc., according to the<br/>location of the tone (relative to C) in the sequence of fifths.  The<br/>number of generators (fifths, in this case) that a tone is distant<br/>from C (or whatever tone of origin) thus determines its y-axis<br/>placement on any generalized keyboard, regardless of type (or<br/>generating interval).</p><p>I&apos;m not suggesting that you use circular keys -- the above is just an<br/>illustration of how the aspect ratio can be altered.</p><p>&gt; I imagine that using<br/>&gt; this design the keyboard layout would be asymmetrical, and if I<br/>used<br/>&gt; keys shaped like those on Fokker&apos;s 31-tone organ in rows of varying<br/>&gt; height, there would also be tactile landmarks just as functional as<br/>&gt; in any other design.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s all or nothing, why no one has suggested this<br/>&gt; type of compromise.  Nor do I see anyone addressing my argument for<br/>&gt; tactile landmarks.  Are you all honestly telling me that being able<br/>&gt; to feel where you are on the keyboard by touch alone is a *bad*<br/>&gt; thing?</p><p>No, quite the contrary, I think tactile landmarks are essential.  I<br/>play the accordion (a special free-bass type with no chord buttons),<br/>and for the left hand (which it is impossible for me to see) I depend<br/>on having some of the buttons marked with dimples in the center,<br/>which helps me to find my way around.</p><p>Unless you read my generalized keyboard description very closely:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407</a><br/>you probably missed the phrase &quot;employment of touch coding on the<br/>sharp and flat keys&quot;, which I also referred to here:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_50065.html#50101">/tuning/topicId_50065.html#50101</a></p><p>The touch-coding that I referred to involves some sort of variation<br/>in the *feel* of a key surface.  On the Scalatron I would have liked<br/>a textured key surface to identify the sharp and flat keys (which<br/>occur in twos and threes), but that would have required a second mold<br/>for the keytops (too expensive), so we settled for a pair of brass<br/>pinheads set into small holes drilled in the key surfaces, which<br/>proved to work okay -- even with the bedsheet thrown over the<br/>keyboard!  So I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s not necessary to have an irregular<br/>pattern of keys in order to have useful tactile landmarks -- either<br/>on the generalized-keyboard Scalatron or on the bass buttons of an<br/>accordion.</p><p>With a heterogeneous keyboard one generally plays by *note* (i.e.,<br/>absolute pitch), but with a generalized keyboard one may play by<br/>note, by *interval* (relative pitch), or by a *combination* of the<br/>two.  When playing by interval, one easily learns to associate each<br/>type of interval with a different vector (having a unique distance<br/>and direction) in several ways: by sight, by feel (i.e., relative<br/>position of fingers), and by kinesthetic memory (hand/arm movement).<br/>I&apos;ve found these interval patterns so useful that I&apos;ve often used the<br/>generalized keyboard as an interval calculator to figure out such<br/>things as the notes in a harmonic eleventh chord built on some remote<br/>root.  From this it should also be obvious that you don&apos;t even need<br/>to memorize the notes in all possible harmonic eleventh chords in the<br/>tuning -- just memorize the pattern (finger positions) for the<br/>voicing you want, and move your fingers into position as you move<br/>your hand into the proper place to select one of those notes with the<br/>appropriate thumb or finger, and all of the rest automatically fall<br/>into place.  This makes improvisation a breeze -- but you lose this<br/>feature with any heterogeneous design!</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; *sigh* perhaps I am wasting my breath.  Either way, I&apos;m not going<br/>to<br/>&gt; post asking for any more opinions on a specialized 22-equal<br/>&gt; keyboard.  It&apos;s been made abundantly clear that I will get no<br/>&gt; constructive criticism here.</p><p>Igliashon, I hope to prove to you that, if you were to make the<br/>necessary improvements, one by one, to arrive at the<br/>best &quot;specialized&quot; 22-ET design, you would in fact end up with a<br/>*generalized* design!</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=8435 href="#8435">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2005 9:44:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Okay, George.  I think I understand you much better now.  Interesting<br/>idea about differently textured keys...I shall have to ask Stevie<br/>about his opinion on that.</p><p>I think 22 is a little more of a challenge to make a lattice for than<br/>22, though.  In 22, I desire to use 3 systems as different bases for<br/>tonality: Paul&apos;s Pajara-based Decatonics, Super-pythagorean<br/>Diatonics, and Porcupine-8 Octatonics.  In the first system, one<br/>constructs 10-note scales using 8 2-degree steps and 2 3-degree<br/>steps.  In Diatonics, the scales are 2 1-degree steps and 5 4-degree<br/>steps.  And in Porcupine, it is 1 1-degree step and 7 3-degree<br/>steps.  This makes designing a keyboard INSANELY difficult.  I<br/>examined a suggested lattice for 22-based Diatonics, but that one<br/>makes playing in the other two systems (Porcupine especially!) very<br/>difficult.  I haven&apos;t attempted one based on a decatonic scale yet,<br/>but one based on the Porcupine seems to work quite well.  If it was<br/>mapped to a hex lattice, going &quot;up&quot; would ascend one degree,<br/>going &quot;right&quot; would ascend 3, and going &quot;diagonal&quot; would be 4.  It&apos;s<br/>almost exactly the same as the Wilson idea, now that I think about<br/>it, except that the axes are switched around.  It is precisely that<br/>design I applied to my keyboard (though the last design I posted did<br/>not feature the 4th row of duplicate white keys at the top that I<br/>later added), but modified to fit in one dimension.  This removes<br/>some of the uniformity a lattice provides, since at one point the<br/>horizontal ascends by 1 degree instead of 3 (though I may yet find a<br/>way around this), but this seems like the best compromise between<br/>traditional and general.</p><p>Would it be possible, do you think, to use rectangular (or even<br/>square) keys that would feel fairly traditional to make a lattice<br/>that could ascend uniformly without needing to stretch too far in the<br/>vertical dimension?  Indeed it seems that a uniform design might help<br/>in allowing multiple systems to be played on the same keyboard.  I<br/>must admit that I have lost a little enthusiasm for the traditional<br/>design since considering that three systems need to be accomodated by<br/>one design.</p><p>Rest assured, too, that I am not dead-set on anything yet; I&apos;m trying<br/>to avoid making a mistake as well, since it will be tremendous effort<br/>to build this thing ourselves.  If I seem stubborn, it&apos;s because I<br/>don&apos;t want Stevie to be stuck with something that he doesn&apos;t want to<br/>play.  Also, one thing I think we ought to keep in mind is that this<br/>will be a MIDI controller; as such, the potential difficulty of<br/>transposing to some keys may feasibly be avoided simply be retuning<br/>the synthesizer.</p><p>Apologies should be made for my earlier attitude; the internet makes<br/>misunderstanding easy, and I&apos;m all too accustomed to the &quot;flame wars&quot;<br/>that occur on other forums.  Your input is greatly appreciated, since<br/>you have a perspective that both Stevie and I are lacking.  Please<br/>remember too that we are young, and we sort of have to learn at our<br/>own pace.  Before we give in and go general, we first must make sure<br/>that there are no alternatives that would be more favorable, and this<br/>could take awhile (if it is indeed the case).</p><p>Regards,<br/>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

Although<br/>there<br/>&gt; are 50 keys/octave on the instrument, 19 of these are permanently<br/>&gt; hard-wired as duplicates for 31-ET, that particular number,<br/>&gt; approximately 1.6 times 31, being arrived at by determining how<br/>many<br/>&gt; keys would be needed to play various microtonal scales and chords<br/>in<br/>&gt; all 31 keys with the same patterns.  When I&apos;m using a tuning of N<br/>&gt; tones with fewer than 31/octave (such as 19 or 22), my usable<br/>&gt; duplicates are limited to 31 minus N.  For 19-ET the 12 duplicates<br/>&gt; have proved completely satisfactory (12 being 19 times 1.6, rounded<br/>&gt; upward).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For 22-ET you could do quite a bit with 9 duplicates.  The<br/>instances<br/>&gt; where you&apos;d be coming up short would be in certain remote keys, so<br/>&gt; you might have to use some awkward alternate fingerings.  That&apos;s<br/>why<br/>&gt; I&apos;d consider 36 keys/octave optimal for 22.  But if you were<br/>building<br/>&gt; this yourself, I guess you could always add more duplicate keys<br/>later<br/>&gt; on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Seeing as how this is less than 2 manuals, I would<br/>&gt; &gt; imagine I could use this subset to make a more compact and<br/>&gt; &gt; specialized version of the generalized design.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s no &quot;official&quot; specification for how many keys/octave should<br/>&gt; be on a Bosanquet keyboard, nor how far apart the key centers<br/>should<br/>&gt; be along the x or y directions, nor what the x:y aspect ratio<br/>should<br/>&gt; be (all of which would influence the size and shape of the keys).<br/>I<br/>&gt; would *strongly* recommend that keys an octave apart be at exactly<br/>&gt; the same position along the y-axis (unlike the Fokker keyboard),<br/>even<br/>&gt; though this causes the rows to slant.  But it&apos;s still possible for<br/>&gt; the rows to slant without having diagonal sides on the keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An example of a different x:y aspect ratio is in my design for a<br/>&gt; generalized accordion treble keyboard (with 2-cm round keys):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>&gt; math/files/secor/kbds/KbAc19p3.gif<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Something you should take note of in this diagram (as well as the<br/>&gt; others in my postings) is the vertical generator ruler immediately<br/>to<br/>&gt; the left of the lowest-pitch keys.  The key center for C lines up<br/>&gt; with 0G on the ruler, G is +1, D is +2, etc., according to the<br/>&gt; location of the tone (relative to C) in the sequence of fifths.<br/>The<br/>&gt; number of generators (fifths, in this case) that a tone is distant<br/>&gt; from C (or whatever tone of origin) thus determines its y-axis<br/>&gt; placement on any generalized keyboard, regardless of type (or<br/>&gt; generating interval).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not suggesting that you use circular keys -- the above is just<br/>an<br/>&gt; illustration of how the aspect ratio can be altered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I imagine that using<br/>&gt; &gt; this design the keyboard layout would be asymmetrical, and if I<br/>&gt; used<br/>&gt; &gt; keys shaped like those on Fokker&apos;s 31-tone organ in rows of<br/>varying<br/>&gt; &gt; height, there would also be tactile landmarks just as functional<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; in any other design.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s all or nothing, why no one has suggested<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; type of compromise.  Nor do I see anyone addressing my argument<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; tactile landmarks.  Are you all honestly telling me that being<br/>able<br/>&gt; &gt; to feel where you are on the keyboard by touch alone is a *bad*<br/>&gt; &gt; thing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, quite the contrary, I think tactile landmarks are essential.  I<br/>&gt; play the accordion (a special free-bass type with no chord<br/>buttons),<br/>&gt; and for the left hand (which it is impossible for me to see) I<br/>depend<br/>&gt; on having some of the buttons marked with dimples in the center,<br/>&gt; which helps me to find my way around.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless you read my generalized keyboard description very closely:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407</a><br/>&gt; you probably missed the phrase &quot;employment of touch coding on the<br/>&gt; sharp and flat keys&quot;, which I also referred to here:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_50065.html#50101">/tuning/topicId_50065.html#50101</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The touch-coding that I referred to involves some sort of variation<br/>&gt; in the *feel* of a key surface.  On the Scalatron I would have<br/>liked<br/>&gt; a textured key surface to identify the sharp and flat keys (which<br/>&gt; occur in twos and threes), but that would have required a second<br/>mold<br/>&gt; for the keytops (too expensive), so we settled for a pair of brass<br/>&gt; pinheads set into small holes drilled in the key surfaces, which<br/>&gt; proved to work okay -- even with the bedsheet thrown over the<br/>&gt; keyboard!  So I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s not necessary to have an<br/>irregular<br/>&gt; pattern of keys in order to have useful tactile landmarks -- either<br/>&gt; on the generalized-keyboard Scalatron or on the bass buttons of an<br/>&gt; accordion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With a heterogeneous keyboard one generally plays by *note* (i.e.,<br/>&gt; absolute pitch), but with a generalized keyboard one may play by<br/>&gt; note, by *interval* (relative pitch), or by a *combination* of the<br/>&gt; two.  When playing by interval, one easily learns to associate each<br/>&gt; type of interval with a different vector (having a unique distance<br/>&gt; and direction) in several ways: by sight, by feel (i.e., relative<br/>&gt; position of fingers), and by kinesthetic memory (hand/arm<br/>movement).<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve found these interval patterns so useful that I&apos;ve often used<br/>the<br/>&gt; generalized keyboard as an interval calculator to figure out such<br/>&gt; things as the notes in a harmonic eleventh chord built on some<br/>remote<br/>&gt; root.  From this it should also be obvious that you don&apos;t even need<br/>&gt; to memorize the notes in all possible harmonic eleventh chords in<br/>the<br/>&gt; tuning -- just memorize the pattern (finger positions) for the<br/>&gt; voicing you want, and move your fingers into position as you move<br/>&gt; your hand into the proper place to select one of those notes with<br/>the<br/>&gt; appropriate thumb or finger, and all of the rest automatically fall<br/>&gt; into place.  This makes improvisation a breeze -- but you lose this<br/>&gt; feature with any heterogeneous design!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; *sigh* perhaps I am wasting my breath.  Either way, I&apos;m not going<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; post asking for any more opinions on a specialized 22-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard.  It&apos;s been made abundantly clear that I will get no<br/>&gt; &gt; constructive criticism here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igliashon, I hope to prove to you that, if you were to make the<br/>&gt; necessary improvements, one by one, to arrive at the<br/>&gt; best &quot;specialized&quot; 22-ET design, you would in fact end up with a<br/>&gt; *generalized* design!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p></div>
