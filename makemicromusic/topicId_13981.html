GUIs and command-line interfaces are in principle<br/>functionally equivalent.  As for customization, Windows (for example)<br/>allows plenty of customization of its GUI, as do various linux desktop<br/>systems.</p><p>&gt;This is perfectly fine, right and proper. It adequately explains -- to<br/>&gt;me, at any rate -- why GUIs might simply be redundant, when individual<br/>&gt;users can re-configure to their heart&apos;s content on a daily basis.</p><p>It isn&apos;t a matter of configuring, it&apos;s a matter of which is faster.<br/>There&apos;s faster for new users and faster for practiced ones.  Done<br/>right, GUIs are generally faster for new users.  The answer for<br/>practiced users is harder.  An interesting experiment performed by<br/>Apple during their research for the Lisa found that skilled users<br/>reported doing tasks more quickly with a command line, but the<br/>actual time elapsed was the same!  The cognitive psych. explanation<br/>is that the mind is kept busier by command line use and hence time<br/>seems to pass more quickly.</p><p>Though in principle a GUI can be made to express any feature set<br/>available with a command line system, in practice GUIs are faster<br/>for some tasks and the command line faster for others.<br/>A good example of GUIs being faster is drawing software.  Try<br/>entering vector paths in a command line and get back to me!</p><p>One of the major slowdowns associated with GUI use is the mouse.<br/>Specifically, the time it takes to &quot;context switch&quot; your hand<br/>between the keyboard and mouse.  This can be reduced by about<br/>an order of magnitude by using IBM&apos;s &quot;Trackpoint&quot; pointing<br/>stick (red eraser thing in the middle of the keyboard).</p><p>&gt;Another thing illuminated: Time to move on. Lots of music still<br/>&gt;left to write, you know. Good luck to you all.</p><p>Don&apos;t let this guy turn you off.  Anyone who says stuff like<br/>that is either a moron, or just trying to upset you.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&quot;There is no political solution<br/>To Our Troubled Evolution...&quot;  -- The Police</p></div>
