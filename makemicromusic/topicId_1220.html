By the 12th century, composed<br/>organa take a Gregorian chant and often draw out each note to a kind<br/>of a moveable pedal point, with a florid melody woven above and about<br/>it. This piece, using a timbre named in Mary Beth Ackerley&apos;s honor and<br/>optimized for the 13-tET &quot;fifthlike&quot; interval or 8-step and its<br/>near-Phi interval or 9-step, is inspired by such styles, along with an<br/>&quot;organ&quot; timbre based on FM Algorithm 32 of the TX-802 (with a<br/>&quot;drawbar-like&quot; mix of partials).</p><p>Here I might add that the 9-step interval of 13-tET at ~830.77 cents,<br/>is quite close to the Golden Section or Phi at ~833.09 cents, and even<br/>closer to the ratio 13:21 (~830.25 cents) formed from two of the<br/>numbers in the famous Fibonacci series (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55...)<br/>where successive pairs form ratios more and more closely approximating<br/>Phi.</p><p>In neo-Gothic tuning systems of a more conventional kind, this<br/>interval typically serves as a &quot;supraminor sixth&quot; or augmented fifth,<br/>a highly valued effect; but in 13-tET, which has its own categories,<br/>such conventional names may or may not fit the &quot;harmonic geometry&quot; of<br/>a beautiful and different system.</p><p>Often the 9-step is more or less equivalent in its &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot;<br/>role to a usual minor sixth, the intervals &quot;adding up&quot; in their own<br/>way.</p><p>Again, thanks to Mary, Robert, and everyone for your encouragement and<br/>support as we share our music together.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
