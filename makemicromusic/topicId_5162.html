A great artist. She also happen to do an article on<br/>my own work back in the 80&apos;s for a  Korean magazine which is in all Korean , so i have never really know &apos;exactly&apos;<br/>what she said. Although Koreans have told me it is quite good. (the article is buried in my resume on line, if one<br/>needs a cure for insomnia ).<br/>    JVC put out quite a good collection of this music as well as King record. (not records) both of which i play alot<br/>on my show below. Byong Kon Kim who i studied with before Erv Wilson had quite a bit of &apos;spiritial&apos; influence upon<br/>me. There is a very big Korean community in LA but is very segregated here. For instance i was once thrown out of a<br/>stationary store just walking and being told &quot;no paper, no paper for you&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Stan Hoffman &lt;stanhoffman@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Microtonality at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes--Korean music, both &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;classical,&quot; is amazing and wonderfully<br/>&gt; microtonal. I tried to find a teacher to learn kayagum, komungo, or ajaeng<br/>&gt; in the Boston area, but the nearest I could find was a three-hour drive in<br/>&gt; Connecticut (Kim Jin Hi or, Americanized, Jin Hi Kim). If anyone know of any<br/>&gt; practitioners of Korean music (any instrument, not necessarily at a<br/>&gt; professional level) in the Boston, Massachusetts area, please let me know!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
