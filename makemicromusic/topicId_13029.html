The following ideas are submitted as one possible step<br/>toward a new consideration of our mission and a building of consensus<br/>as we seek to lend our creative energies to each other and to<br/>newcomers.</p><p>         (1) Focusing specifically on musical pieces posted<br/>             by members, or on precompositional sketches and<br/>             the like, would emphasize our mission to _make_<br/>             microtonal music.</p><p>         (2) Having theoretical comments or discussions tied<br/>             to specific pieces would at once reinforce this<br/>             focus on making music, and place the accent on<br/>             what people are actually doing and can explain<br/>             with the benefit of first-person experience.</p><p>         (3) More generally, directing comments to what we are<br/>             actually ourselves doing -- with tuning systems,<br/>             computer operating systems, etc. -- can make our<br/>             posts more informative while avoiding the kind of<br/>             conflicts which can arise from general comparison,<br/>             stereotypes, and open-ended debates.</p><p>         (4) If MMM were distinctive as a tuning forum in its<br/>             emphasis on first-person sharing and assistance --<br/>             not that these are bad elsewhere! -- this would<br/>             allow other groups to continue to serve as forums<br/>             for open-ended theoretical discussions or debates<br/>             not necessarily tied to a specific musicmaking<br/>             project or endeavor.</p><p>         (5) If we had a norm of responding to questions about<br/>             a given tuning system or family of systems by posting<br/>             examples of pieces we like in the queried system(s),<br/>             possibly with theoretical commentaries closely tethered<br/>             to the pieces, and tending toward private e-mail or<br/>             other forums for more general discussions, we might<br/>             underscore the uniqueness of this group.</p><p>Often the sport of &quot;microtonal debate&quot; seems akin to assessing the<br/>&quot;goodness to fit&quot; of a given outfit of apparel without knowing who is<br/>wearing it or why. An alternative ethos, which I hope people in MMM<br/>will consider, is: &quot;If the shoe fits in a composition I&apos;ve written, or<br/>that someone else has written and made available, post it.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, if I write an account of what musicmaking is like with a<br/>command-line Linux system, this wouldn&apos;t necessarily serve as a direct<br/>example for someone using or seeking a GUI system (Windows, Mac,<br/>Linux, etc.) -- but might at least be amusing, and give an idea of the<br/>diversity of solutions out there. Of course, that account would be<br/>made possible by incredibly generous people such as Jon Szanto, Aaron<br/>Johnson, and Jacky Ligon, who have helped get me to where I am.</p><p>A final point: while the original idea of MMM was to keep posts rather<br/>short, longer essays of an expository kind that tie in with musical<br/>pieces or sketches might actually promote the special purposes of this<br/>forum as defined almost five years ago. Telling how one came to write<br/>a composition in a certain way can encourage others to share their<br/>perspectives on their own pieces -- or possibly to comment on<br/>something said by a performer or composer of a piece that strikes a<br/>chord as to their reaction as a listener.</p><p>Maybe some discussion could reveal what directions a consensus might<br/>run in; and again, thanks to all who made MMMDay possible!</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=13030 href="#13030">ðŸ”—</a>akjmicro &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2006 9:40:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo,</p><p>I like all of your ideas here---brava!!!</p><p>Warmly,<br/>Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&lt;snipped for bandwidth saving&gt;</p><p>link to original message:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_13029.html#13029">/makemicromusic/topicId_13029.html#13029</a></p></div>
