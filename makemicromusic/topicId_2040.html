Namely innocence<br/>and the liberation and abandon that are part and parcel.</p><p>Bryan&apos;s playing is amazing. He plays everyday and the sound is<br/>alarmingly confident and completely lacking in anything resembling<br/>timidity--I had him leave a live playing message on my friend&apos;s<br/>answering machine, and he thought it was his friend Bret, a strange<br/>but accomplished guitar veteran. Bryan listens to very little music,<br/>and he has no fear or even recognition of doing it right or doing it<br/>wrong. I have all I can do to keep up! It&apos;s fresh in a way that can&apos;t<br/>last, how strange.</p><p>So far, I&apos;ve kept my distance... I&apos;ll show him this or that, but only<br/>occasionally and only when we&apos;re not playing music--his music. He<br/>knows what he&apos;s doing and it shows! It may not always be what his pops<br/>would do if he had is druthers, but it&apos;s also almost always something<br/>his pops couldn&apos;t do if wanted to--if only he knew! Truth is, it would<br/>be a shame to &quot;teach&quot; him now because he&apos;s in the zone, but I do<br/>occasionally worry that he&apos;ll acquire a lot of bad (habits technique<br/>wise. Oh well, I&apos;m doing what I feel is right.</p><p>We&apos;re going to &apos;rehearse&apos;--i.e., get him on a big amp and see if he<br/>can handle the volume increase that comes with playing with a drummer,<br/>and see if he can get the hang of singing into a microphone--next<br/>week, and we hope to gig soon. It&apos;s wild. Kind of like those old SST<br/>guitar bands but a lot more nuts; more rhythmically spastic like<br/>Drumbo era Beefheart. None of those guitarists were ever as free and<br/>fresh as he is either, and only a few were ever any more interesting.<br/>(Okay, I&apos;m his dad, and maybe I can&apos;t be held accountable for that<br/>last statement, but we&apos;ll see! BTW, I play fretless bass and he&apos;s been<br/>playing my fretless Kramer since he broke a string on his guitar a<br/>couple of weeks ago, so I guess we&apos;ll be a microtonal punk band--see<br/>this post was on topic after all!)</p><p>Should be fun, and interesting too... we&apos;ll see. As it is, it&apos;s<br/>enough.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=2073 href="#2073">ðŸ”—</a>kpeck77 &#x3C;kris.peck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2002 10:57:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been playing a lot with my seven-year-old son Bryan lately--he<br/>&gt; wanted one thing for Christmas, an electric guitar, and he got it.<br/>&gt; This has offered me a rare glimpse into what I already intuitively<br/>&gt; knew.</p><p>Dan-<br/>Thanks for sharing this!  As a daddy myself, I can relate to a lot of<br/>your feelings here, although my girls are only 3-1/2 and 22 months<br/>and not quite at an age to be real musically expressive.  I&apos;ve been<br/>VERY gently encouraging them to play with a few instruments, and it&apos;s<br/>a joy to watch and listen to.  (Although sometimes painful when all<br/>they want to do is randomly pound...)  I wish I had a recorder going<br/>when I recently showed Lydia how to sing into a microphone with a<br/>digital delay.  She talked, giggled, screamed into the mic and stared<br/>in thrilled amazement every time it looped back around.</p><p>I&apos;m edging closer to completing a simple &quot;golden meantone pentatonic&quot;<br/>tubulong as a gift for Lydia.  (It was originally supposed to be a<br/>Christmas present, but there&apos;s only just so much time in a day to<br/>work on it...)  We&apos;ll see how much interest she takes in playing it<br/>once it is ready.  I know, too, sometimes these things sit dormant<br/>for years before the interest suddenly awakens...</p><p>I will try to resist the temptation to post an mp3 of Lydia singing<br/>&quot;The Itsy Bitsy Spider&quot;.  Well, it certainly is microtonal!  Maybe we<br/>need another spinoff list, tuning_parenting...<br/>kp</p></div>
