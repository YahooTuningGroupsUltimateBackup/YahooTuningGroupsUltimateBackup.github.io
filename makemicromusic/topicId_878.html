This is the type of thing you may want to discuss<br/>on the main tuning list. Very quickly: N-limit JI means that the<br/>frequency ratios are fractions of numbers whose odd or prime factors<br/>are all N or less. N-tET means that the frequency ratios are all<br/>irrational; specifically, they are all 2^(x/N), where x is an integer.</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2001 12:18:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May I inquire if you have ever explored polymetrical structures in<br/>&gt; your compositions?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, alot.

For<br/>example, many people use those particular ETs which approximate JI<br/>well: e.g. 19-tET and 34-tET for 5-limit JI; 22-tET and 31-tET for 7-<br/>or 11-limit JI . . . Also, don&apos;t forget there&apos;s a &quot;middle path&quot;<br/>between ETs and JI: linear temperaments, planar temperaments, etc.</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
