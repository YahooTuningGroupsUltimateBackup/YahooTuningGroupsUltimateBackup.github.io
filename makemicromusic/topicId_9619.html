Although the ratios in the score are exact, notes in higher<br/>octaves are _very_ sharp.  Substituting with pluck or oscil fixes the<br/>problem.  Does anyone know why this is, or more importantly, how to<br/>correct it?  wgpluck seems pretty useless otherwise...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-Chris</p></div>
