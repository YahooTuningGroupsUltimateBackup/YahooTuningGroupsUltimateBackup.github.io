When you charge the entrants $20 for the privilege of competing, it&apos;s more of a lottery than an award. Perhaps you should make it interesting, and make the prize $20,000, but charge $1,000 to enter. The possibilities are endless. Now we are just arguing over the price.</p><p>&quot;a non-refundable Paypal fee of $20, payable from this page, see below&quot;</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to announce UnTwelve&apos;s first annual composition competition!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There will be a $200 cash prize for your winning 3-5 minute electronic,<br/>&gt; acoustic, or electro-acoustic piece, entries are due by Oct. 1st, and you<br/>&gt; can find out all the rules and regulations by checking out our webpage for<br/>&gt; the event:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.untwelve.org/competition.html">http://www.untwelve.org/competition.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On behalf of UnTwelve, I can say we look forward to seeing your<br/>&gt; contributions!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Aaron Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2009 12:39:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all,</p><p>Thanks for your feedback re:the competition.</p><p>There are valid points on both sides of the issue regarding entry fees.<br/>However, ultimately, our position is one that we all are comfortable with as<br/>it stands.</p><p>We feel strongly that the competition will be a net positive for the music<br/>community in general, but it was started out of fondness for this community.<br/>Our hope was to spark some creative activity, giving people some incentive<br/>to give their best work for the benefit of microtonal music awareness<br/>everywhere.</p><p>We have received numerous queries already from excited parties outside the<br/>tuning list, so our mission of expanding such awareness has already begun,<br/>and as such, we consider this a successful project already.
