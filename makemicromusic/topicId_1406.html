I&apos;d &gt;be interested to hear any thoughts that any of you might have regarding &gt;these thorny and often contentious issues.</p><p>I would never put myself shoulder-to-shoulder with a deep human that I&apos;ve admired and been inspired by since the first time I heard him: Bob Moses. One of the most transcendent nights of music I have ever experienced was with Moses playing with Steve Swallow, Steve Kuhn, and Sheila Jordan. He is a deep and passionate non-drummer, and means a lot to me.</p><p>So all I can say is that the underlying tenor of his thoughts felt so extraordinarily close to what I&apos;ve had to talk about the last 6 years regarding the works of Partch. That so many now choose to utilize transcriptions and arrangements, for the simple pleasure of adding a Partch work to their rep, with so little regard (or obvious disdain) for his personal, and idiosyncratic, aesthetic -  well, they are free to do so in the literal, but spiritually it is a bankrupt rendition. (I&apos;ve just had occasion to vent spleen on this issue, as myself along with Danlee Mitchell and a couple of other members of the Partch Ensemble were filmed and interviewed for a BBC documentary on Partch that will air in the spring. We&apos;ll have to see what flack I catch from naming names, if it doesn&apos;t get cut...).</p><p>Thanks for sharing that, Dan - I&apos;m going to pass it along to members of the Harry Partch Foundation as well.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1410 href="#1410">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
