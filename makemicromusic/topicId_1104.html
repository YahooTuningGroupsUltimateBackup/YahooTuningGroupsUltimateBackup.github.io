Maybe I can briefly tell the story, taking the occasion<br/>to thank Jacky not only for all this inspiration and assistance, but<br/>for helping along with Jon and many others to make this special forum<br/>possible.</p><p>I wanted to mention you, Jacky, in my previous message, but I realized<br/>that I hadn&apos;t gone through the etiquette of asking your permission.<br/>Now, however, to borrow an old phrase, &quot;it can be told.&quot;</p><p>In fact, part of the story has already been published in TMA, another<br/>forum you have made possible, and one which, like MMM, seeks to<br/>integrate discussions about musicmaking with actual music.</p><p>This summer, when looking for timbres which might maximize the<br/>consonance of certain intervals in the manner of William Sethares and<br/>others, I hit on a certain built-in timbres on the Yahama TX-802<br/>synthesizer which made a Renaissance style pleasant, at least to me,<br/>in 22-tET. As is well known, the regular thirds and sixths of this<br/>tuning are quite different than the usual 16th-century ratios at or<br/>near 5:4 and 6:5, so I was curious about what might be happening.</p><p>You then found in one of the timbres a partial at around 744 cents, in<br/>contrast to the usual third partial or harmonic at or near 3:2 (around<br/>702 cents). This led me to try an experiment in which I found that a<br/>Renaissance meantone diminished sixth at around 738 cents in a<br/>1/4-comma tuning with pure 5:4 major thirds, for example -- usually<br/>known as a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; because of its proverbial dissonance &quot;like the<br/>howling of wolves&quot; -- could in this timbre have an effect like that of<br/>a usual concordant fifth.</p><p>Since this &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; was very close to the size of an interval of<br/>8/13 octave, also rounding to 738 cents, I found it natural to try<br/>13-tET, and the tape followed from there.</p><p>Please let me caution everyone here in advance, Jacky, that while your<br/>intonational artistry as well as technical skills are widely<br/>acclaimed, my tape is a first crude effort in xenharmonic music, amply<br/>documenting both my inexperience and my imperfect keyboard technique.<br/>This makes your generous assistance at this early stage all the more<br/>valuable.</p><p>Deeping thanking, you, Jacky, for all this, I would like also to thank<br/>you, Jon, and others, who have likewise come forward offering their<br/>musical experience and expertise. I hope that I can return this gift<br/>appropriately in some way.</p><p>Such a generous community naturally leads to friendly and fruitful<br/>collaborations of various kinds. For example, John deLaubenfels, you<br/>and I did a Tuning List presentation comparing a progression I came up<br/>with in JI and an adaptively tuned version of yours with more even<br/>melodic steps, letting people compare the musical results.</p><p>Jon, your response reminds me that you have a very special musical<br/>perspective to offer, not to mention your technical resources and<br/>skills. An issue I&apos;m dealing with now is striking a balance between<br/>&quot;getting some material out there&quot; and quality control, if I might use<br/>that term, especially for something that might be taken as a &quot;serious&quot;<br/>release.</p><p>One thing especially important that you represent to me is respect for<br/>an uncompromising commitment to a musical vision, as represented by<br/>Harry Partch, combined with a lot of practical musicianship and<br/>wisdom. Those are precious things for our community.</p><p>Mary, your timbres and the &quot;science fiction&quot; quality of some of your<br/>music has also been an infiuential element: maybe an illustration of<br/>the axiom that to perform well is also to teach and inspire others.</p><p>Then, Paul, there are your &quot;puzzles&quot; and also your musical practice<br/>(e.g. 22-tET), both of which can lead in many musical directions, by<br/>analogy or sometimes by a bit of contrast.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned only some of the people who have helped in my own<br/>recent endeavors; and if we considered all the worthy things be done<br/>by people here and in other forums of our tuning community, the<br/>catalogue of mutual assistance and generosity would be a very long<br/>one.</p><p>Thank you all.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
