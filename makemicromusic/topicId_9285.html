I&apos;ve mulled it for a while, and really don&apos;t want this to &apos;start&apos; anything, but I also don&apos;t feel right about keeping it inside of me, because it affects me as an artist (hey, if the word &quot;artist&quot; comes off as stuffy or whatever, just substitute &quot;musician&quot; or something).</p><p>A few days ago Paul had occasion to comment on a snippet of my playing in a subset of 22. The talk went like this, with the first statement mine:</p><p>&gt;&gt; - didn&apos;t think I&apos;d ever play around in this: 22tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not ever? A bit prejudicial, perhaps?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Not really consonant enough for me<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What timbres did you try it with?</p><p>So here is what feels junky to me: Why is my statement about not wanting to use 22 &quot;prejudicial&quot;? I&apos;ve read Paul&apos;s paper, and I&apos;ve listened to most any piece of music I&apos;ve found posted that was in 22. 100 position papers wouldn&apos;t convince me of a tuning as much as one good piece, and I frankly haven&apos;t ever really liked anything in 22. And I *don&apos;t* mean that each and every piece was a monument to suckage, just that they didn&apos;t work on me the way music I like does.</p><p>Not to mention that it was one of the first ETs I set up, going on all the &apos;press&apos; we&apos;ve gotten about it over the years. A couple progressions and no melodic stuff that felt comfortable to me was all I got. So, as a matter of fact, I don&apos;t tend to use it, and am not drawn to it as a listener as well.</p><p>Lastly is Paul&apos;s suggestion about timbre (I don&apos;t mean to speak in the 3rd person as rude gesture, but it seems the best way to address this generally): that isn&apos;t how I go about making music. I&apos;m drawn to sounds and palettes that connect with me in some way; maybe similar to instruments I&apos;m familiar with in expressing myself live, maybe sounds that evoke a particular mood, or maybe sounds that just make me want to find a way to use them.</p><p>What I don&apos;t seem to do is pick a tuning and decide I&apos;ll use it no matter what. Maybe that is something that comes from getting an instrument refretted: you damn well better want to make music on it!</p><p>It should be obvious that I don&apos;t fill a Traditional Composer mold, as they might pick a tuning and right away start scoring out things; I tend to work more by playing material that could develop into something, so I have a feedback-loop workstyle that tends to find it&apos;s own way to what it likes.</p><p>Well, shit, I&apos;m wandering now. I don&apos;t feel badly towards Paul (got that, Paul?!), and I know in his way he must mean well. But I don&apos;t plan on chasing timbres to justify a use of a tuning, either. I just want to make some music in a manner - and intonation - that feels comfortable to me.</p><p>The funniest thing about all this?

And that&apos;s why it&apos;s worth a go at<br/>playing around with it, I think. Perhaps my awful attempts at<br/>microtonal music prejudiced you away from thinking you&apos;d ever even<br/>try it (let alone my awful paper).

See, there are the perils of internet<br/>communication: we have little clue, through manner, inflection, etc.,<br/>how literally to take things. My response to what I thought you were<br/>saying seemed &quot;junky&quot; because you were in fact saying something<br/>different, and the most reasonable fit to what you intended to say</p><p>&gt; A couple progressions and no<br/>&gt; melodic stuff that felt comfortable to me was all I got.</p><p>Well, there&apos;s certainly no diatonic stuff that fits comfortably in<br/>the tuning, so that&apos;s not an unusual reaction at all. It took me many<br/>years to find anything that sounded musical to me in it at all. Not<br/>that I&apos;d expect anyone to spend all those years with a tuning they<br/>didn&apos;t like. But I thought you said you thought you&apos;d never even try<br/>it.</p><p>&gt; So, as a matter of<br/>&gt; fact, I don&apos;t tend to use it, and am not drawn to it as a listener<br/>&gt;as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lastly is Paul&apos;s suggestion about timbre (I don&apos;t mean to speak in<br/>the 3rd<br/>&gt; person as rude gesture, but it seems the best way to address this<br/>&gt; generally): that isn&apos;t how I go about making music.</p><p>It wasn&apos;t a suggestion, Jon -- I simply asked what timbres you had<br/>tried with it.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m drawn to sounds and<br/>&gt; palettes that connect with me in some way; maybe similar to<br/>instruments I&apos;m<br/>&gt; familiar with in expressing myself live, maybe sounds that evoke a<br/>&gt; particular mood, or maybe sounds that just make me want to find a<br/>way to<br/>&gt; use them.</p><p>That&apos;s perfectly fine.</p><p>&gt; What I don&apos;t seem to do is pick a tuning and decide I&apos;ll use it no<br/>matter<br/>&gt; what. Maybe that is something that comes from getting an instrument<br/>&gt; refretted: you damn well better want to make music on it!</p><p>I don&apos;t understand. If you have an instrument refretted, you probably<br/>had a good idea of the range of timbres that instrument could produce<br/>before you refretted it.

Szanto wrote:</p><p>&gt;Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Something I wanted to get off my chest.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Jon --</p><p>A nice posting, a nice piece.</p><p>The basic job of a composer is to make choices, asserting her/his own preferences. If anything has been accomplished by the alternative tuning community, it is at least a serious multiplication of choices, which -- like consumer choice -- can create a certain anxiety.  I have known more than one musician involved in the intonation world to get so overwhelmed by the landscape of choices, that they adapt a radical indifference.  In effect, they say that since every tuning has its own qualities, they can make their music in any tuning.  In the end, they&apos;re just constantly changing the setting on their synths and noodling around, something akin to, but not quite, composition.  In some cases, some musicians give up composing altogether; while I know that improvisation has an attraction of its own, often I suspect it is a kind of retreat, the result of a refusal to make the commitments a composer must make.</p><p>I understand the anxiety well, and sometimes have real envy for composers who have not had to face such choices.  In the vast space of potential tunings, some set of potentially musical tunings exists with unknown parameters and an unknown magnitude. Within that set is a much smaller subset of tunings with which I -- as a composer -- can begin to make music. (I have found that Erv Wilson has an uncanny talent for selecting out tunings with greater potential musicality). But even within any single tuning, I personally need to spend a lot of time and attention navigating and listening around before I begin to feel comfortable with making composerly commitments. Sure, music theory and my experiences of tunings with analogous qualities can provide some shortcuts, but a commitment of a certain amount of time for exploration is inevitable, and there are bound to be cul de sacs, tunings that just don&apos;t work for you.  Going straight for the tunings where the attraction is immediate (or avoiding the tunings where the attraction is remote) is a perfectly valid tactic.   I recently made the mistake of trying to compose in some tunings (15-tet, 18-tet) with which my attraction and affinity were particularly low; even just playing around with them was a drudge,  and the music suffered, the pieces are now withdrawn, fate unknown.</p><p>I understand Paul&apos;s disappointment with your remark. He has a lot invested in 22-tet and a lot of well-thought-out enthusiasm for the tuning. But as a musician, I hope that his response will eventually be in the form of some new music in 22-tet of his own -- he&apos;s dazzled us with his theoretical imagination; a bit of dazzling with some more composition in 22-tet would be welcome. In the meantime, keep making music of your own, however you find it, and thanks for sharing it.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=9303 href="#9303">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2005 12:08:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

And they are<br/>coming together, little by little, so unless I meet an untimely<br/>death, I can promise you decades of honest effort in this direction<br/>to come!</p><p>In the meantime, Daniel, to restate an earlier, unrelated question:<br/>is there a forum suited for discussing Everett&apos;s recent MTO article<br/>on rock?</p></div><h3><a id=9307 href="#9307">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2005 1:35:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the meantime, Daniel, to restate an earlier, unrelated question:<br/>&gt; is there a forum suited for discussing Everett&apos;s recent MTO article<br/>&gt; on rock?</p><p>Maybe the SMT list?</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=9308 href="#9308">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2005 1:40:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf1@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I recently made the mistake of trying to<br/>&gt; &gt; compose in some tunings (15-tet, 18-tet) with which my attraction and<br/>&gt; &gt; affinity were particularly low; even just playing around with them<br/>&gt; was a<br/>&gt; &gt; drudge,  and the music suffered, the pieces are now withdrawn, fate<br/>&gt; &gt; unknown.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are examples of tunings where your attraction and affinity are high?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve composed happily in a large number of just arrangements, 1/5 comma temperament, all the ETs between 7 and 23 except for 15 and 18 (my 10tet piece isn&apos;t very convincing, now that I think about it), Central Javanese slendro-pelog and saih-7 selonding.

IMO 14tet is swell. It certainly sent me down a path I rarely travel, and methinks that my example is just scraping the top of an iceberg with a teaspoon. I&apos;m not sure whether to keep the ostinato as is (it repeats exactly), or add more virtuosic riffs to it as it repeats. I don&apos;t know what would be more idiomatic (said as if I knew what idiom it belonged to).  (One great aspect of internet &quot;publication&quot; is that work in progress can really be honestly presented as &quot;in progress&quot; without the kinds of time pressures that old fashioned publication required).</p><p>DJW</p></div>
