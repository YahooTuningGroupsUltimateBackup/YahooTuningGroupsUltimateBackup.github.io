Here it&apos;s realized in<br/>Zest-24, an irregular 24-note temperament based largely on Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>Also, my intention was very much to &quot;pull the rug&quot; from under the<br/>listener&apos;s ear -- and your comment is especially valuable to me<br/>because I know that you are a master of this art, as in &quot;The Juggler,&quot;<br/>to cite one example.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/juggler.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/juggler.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>What&apos;s happening in _Invocation_, in either 1/4-comma meantone or<br/>Zest-24, is that resolutions are moving to vertical or harmonic<br/>sonorities at or fairly close to the usual meantone sizes for major<br/>and minor thirds at or near 5:4 and 6:5, for example -- but with the<br/>notes of those sonorities transposed higher or lower than expected by<br/>about 40 or 50 cents! In 2005, we each did a version of a Vicentino<br/>piece using this effect in the closing section, mine with more<br/>sustained timbres and yours a beautiful harpsichord realization, which<br/>people might enjoy hearing:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MusicaPriscaCaput.ogg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MusicaPriscaCaput.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MusicaPriscaCaput.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MusicaPriscaCaput.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/musica_prisca_caput.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/musica_prisca_caput.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>Actually the Zest-24 version of _Invocation_, unlike a version in<br/>1/4-comma, does through its irregular temperament alter the sizes of<br/>some vertical thirds and sixths like E-G# at 396 cents and Bb-G at 900<br/>cents -- rather than the usual 383 and 887 cents for a meantone major<br/>third or sixth in Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma (or 386 and 890 cents in<br/>1/4-comma). However, I&apos;d suspect that it&apos;s the shifts that have the<br/>most noticeably &quot;different&quot; effect.</p><p>A good test, of course, would be to do a version in 1/4-comma, also,<br/>and let people compare.</p><p>Finally, your &quot;super-pythag-ish&quot; intuition is correct on two counts.<br/>First, the small melodic semitones in _Invocation_ at 58 and 71 cents<br/>are in the same size range as those of super-Pythagorean tunings with<br/>fifths tempered wide, for example 17-EDO or a 17-note unequal<br/>temperament like George Secor&apos;s (64-78 cents).</p><p>Also, while it doesn&apos;t come out so much in this particular piece, a<br/>lot of Zest-24 is precisely a super-Pythagorean temperament on account<br/>of the four wide fifths in each 12-note circle, with lots of thirds<br/>and sixths in a range from Pythagorean to around septimal (or beyond,<br/>if we mix notes from the two circles). My next piece posted will show<br/>this side of the system.</p><p>Peace and love, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=15853 href="#15853">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 4:02:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/juggler.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/juggler.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>Speaking of which, AKJ was going to make me an mp3 of this, but I can&apos;t<br/>find it.</p></div><h3><a id=15855 href="#15855">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 7:46:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/juggler.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/juggler.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speaking of which, AKJ was going to make me an mp3 of this, but I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; find it.</p><p>Sorry, Gene, I thought I already sent it to you.

Thanks for providing me with an occasion!</p><p>Finally, for now, why don&apos;t I quickly suggest something you could try<br/>in your 1/6-comma, if you haven&apos;t already. As I recall, you&apos;re using a<br/>regular Eb-G# tuning, where Eb-G# (used in your piece as a narrow<br/>fourth Eb-Ab) is somewhat like 21:16. If so, try playing Eb-Bb-C# (I&apos;m<br/>using regular meantone spellings), then F-Bb-C (with Bb held from the<br/>previous sonority as a suspension as the outer voices contract from<br/>the augmented sixth or minor seventh Eb-C# to the fifth F-C), then a<br/>usual 4-3 resolution of Bb to A, and then a cadence to Bb-Bb-D. Hoping<br/>that at least with a nonproportional font, people may be able to read<br/>this, and using C5 as middle C:</p><p>              C#5    C5            D5<br/>              Bb4        A4 G4 A4  Bb4<br/>              Eb4    F4            Bb3</p><p>This progression is very typical of Monteverdi and the early 17th<br/>century, with the caution that I&apos;m not aware of any period precedent<br/>for a specifically septimal intonation, so that it&apos;s more a familiar<br/>historical idiom in a &quot;xenharmonic&quot; color. If you played this with<br/>regular meantone sizes for the outer seventh and upper third of the<br/>opening sonority, of course, then it would just be a beautiful example<br/>of the Manneristic style around 1600:</p><p>              C5   B4              C#5<br/>              A4      G#4 F#4 G#4  A4<br/>              D4   E4              A3</p><p>I wonder what kind of color this would have in 1/6-comma, and how you<br/>like it -- or maybe have already used it in some of your music.</p><p>Peace and love, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=15966 href="#15966">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2007 6:55:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;               C#5    C5            D5<br/>&gt;               Bb4        A4 G4 A4  Bb4<br/>&gt;               Eb4    F4            Bb3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This progression is very typical of Monteverdi and the early 17th<br/>&gt; century, with the caution that I&apos;m not aware of any period precedent<br/>&gt; for a specifically septimal intonation, so that it&apos;s more a familiar<br/>&gt; historical idiom in a &quot;xenharmonic&quot; color.</p><p>If Monteverdi was doing it, wouldn&apos;t it likely be something close to<br/>1/4-comma?

The example which follows, with<br/>everything a semitone lower and usual meantone spellings, shows the<br/>kind of thing I&apos;m aware of Monteverdi actually writing -- but it&apos;s<br/>quite natural that a reader might suppose that by &quot;This progression is<br/>very typical of Monteverdi&quot; I meant specifically this spelling with<br/>the augmented second and sixth.</p><p>When I added &quot;I&apos;m not aware of any period precedent for a specifically<br/>septimal intonation,&quot; I mean precisely this, that the transposition<br/>was mine rather than Monteverdi&apos;s as far as I know from the examples<br/>I&apos;ve seen. However, that&apos;s not necessarily so obvious to someone other<br/>than the author &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>It&apos;s a lesson for me on the possible hazards of casually chatting<br/>about MMM matters like, &quot;Hey, Magnus, this might be fun to try in your<br/>1/6-comma tuning&quot; rather than practicing defensive musicology and<br/>realizing that an unsuspecting reader could very well conclude that<br/>Monteverdi wrote the augmented second and sixth rather than me!</p><p>If only I had put Monteverdi&apos;s normal version first, and mine second,<br/>with a clear disclaimer that this is a 21st-century rather than<br/>17th-century transposition, you might have been spared this<br/>explanation.</p><p>Anyway, to return to your question -- _if_ Monteverdi had written<br/>something like this with the augmented meantone intervals, I&apos;d agree<br/>that 1/4-comma or 31-EDO would be very close to just ratios of 7:6 and<br/>7:4. This was precisely the point that Christian Huygens made in 1691<br/>in recommending 31-EDO (which he saw as almost identical to<br/>1/4-comma): you get near-pure septimal intervals, which he strongly<br/>recommends as useful consonances.</p><p>However, I should caution that early 17th-century sources, to my best<br/>knowledge, don&apos;t make this kind of observation about septimal ratios<br/>and how to approximate them in meantone -- although there&apos;s a love for<br/>chromaticism, new dissonances, and other &quot;special effects&quot; that might<br/>have people trying a lot of things. If we do (or someone already has)<br/>found the kind of transposition I use above, it would indeed be<br/>interesting evidence for further consideration.</p><p>My point to Magnus was that although this version of Monteverdi&apos;s<br/>progression might not have been in use in the early 17th century, he<br/>might, as I do, enjoy it as a bit of &quot;alternative history.&quot; While<br/>1/4-comma or 31-EDO, as you have observed, is indeed within the<br/>optimal region for 7:6 and 7:4, anything from Magnus&apos;s 1/6-comma to<br/>around 2/7-comma should have a generally &quot;septimal&quot; cast. Indeed the<br/>1/6-comma augmented sixth at around 984 cents isn&apos;t too far from<br/>22-EDO at about 982 cents, which people often consider a reasonable<br/>representation of 7:4.</p><p>Of course, people could also do this in your Cauldron temperament, in some<br/>ways a bit like a single 12-note circle of Zest-24, with Eb as the<br/>starting note in the bass for what looks like a neat transposition with a<br/>virtually just 7:6 at the opening and 5:4 at the end (let&apos;s hope I<br/>figured this correctly -- with corrections invited):</p><p>        D6    C6              D6<br/>        Bb5       A5  G5  A5  Bb5<br/>        Eb5   F5              Bb4</p><p>        978   695             1586<br/>        711   497 378 189 378 1200</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=16215 href="#16215">ðŸ”—</a>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2007 10:18:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 8 Feb 2007, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Finally, for now, why don&apos;t I quickly suggest something you could try<br/>&gt; in your 1/6-comma, if you haven&apos;t already. As I recall, you&apos;re using a<br/>&gt; regular Eb-G# tuning, where Eb-G# (used in your piece as a narrow<br/>&gt; fourth Eb-Ab) is somewhat like 21:16. If so, try playing Eb-Bb-C# (I&apos;m<br/>&gt; using regular meantone spellings), then F-Bb-C (with Bb held from the<br/>&gt; previous sonority as a suspension as the outer voices contract from<br/>&gt; the augmented sixth or minor seventh Eb-C# to the fifth F-C), then a<br/>&gt; usual 4-3 resolution of Bb to A, and then a cadence to Bb-Bb-D.
