Lots of useable things in there for people locked into 12tet, but there are a few sounds I&apos;d like to liberate. First and foremost is a cool pizz acoustic bass. Naturally, the synth doesn&apos;t accept non-12 tuning.</p><p>It looks like I&apos;ll have to go through this laborious process:</p><p>1. Record a midi part with a bass sound on a tuneable synth (so I can hear what I want, pitch-wise)</p><p>2. Save that track as a midi file</p><p>3. Open Scala, set the tuning I want, import the file, retune it, save as new midi file.</p><p>4. Load new midi file into Sonar, load up the Roland bass, make sure it sounds right, export it to an audio file.</p><p>5. Dump the bass midi tracks, import the audio file as the new bass track.</p><p>Yeah, no one said it would be easy. But I&apos;m wondering if anyone out there can come up with a way to streamline this; I&apos;d love any suggestions. If you&apos;re curious about the sound of the bass, I did a quick-and-dirty groove:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/groove_temp2.mp3">http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/groove_temp2.mp3</a>  (~0.5mb)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
