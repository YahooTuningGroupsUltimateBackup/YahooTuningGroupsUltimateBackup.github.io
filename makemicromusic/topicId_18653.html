Let me show you some calculations to find consonant intervals.  Is this what you are trying to accomplish?  Jumping around in consonant intervals that exist starting on every note?</p><p>A 2 step ET octave has the square root of 2 close to<br/>99/70.  Not a very useful fraction to<br/>work with there!</p><p>Go to this reference if you want to play along:<br/><a href="http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html">http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html</a><br/>I&rsquo;m cutting up octaves into equal steps on the exponential<br/>scale to see what kind of consonance I can come up with.  I&rsquo;ll stay within two cents of equal<br/>temperament.  That seems to be the gold<br/>standard.</p><p>3 TET for three tone equal temperament;  34/27 63/50 121/96 29/23<br/>27/17 46/29 100/63.  Excuse me for not including the cents.  They are obviously 400 and 800.  Similar calculations are used for whatever number of steps/1200.</p><p>Let me skip ahead to 22, 24, and 44 TET.</p><p>22 TET<br/>0  1/1<br/>1  33/32 32/31<br/>2  33/31 49/46<br/>3  11/10<br/>4  17/15<br/>5  75/64<br/>6  35/29 29/24<br/>7  96/77<br/>8  9/7<br/>9  85/64<br/>10  63/46<br/>11  99/70<br/>12  99/70<br/>13 &ndash;<br/>14  14/9<br/>15  77/49<br/>16  48/29 53/32 58/35<br/>17  128/75<br/>18  30/17<br/>19  20/11 51/28<br/>20  62/33<br/>21  31/16<br/>22  2/1</p><p>So it appears that in 22 TET three 11/10, eight 9/7,<br/>fourteen 14/9 and nineteen 20/11, step intervals are useful intervals.  The beauty of this is that you can jump<br/>around the equal temperament and all the 3, 8, 14, and 19 step intervals are<br/>going to be OK.  Not my cup of tea, but<br/>is that the idea?</p><p>For 24 TET the two 18/17, three 12/11, ten 4/3, eleven 11/8,<br/>thirteen 16/11, fourteen 3/2, twenty one 11/6, and twenty two 17/9, step<br/>intervals work.</p><p>For 44 TET you don&rsquo;t gain anything by splitting the<br/>intervals in 22 TET into two, and you get a whole bunch of useless intervals to<br/>keep track of.</p></div><h3>Jacob &#x3C;tricesimoprimalist@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2008 12:04:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Bernard &lt;danielbernard13@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are ya&apos;all trying to accomplish with oddball ET divisions?</p><p>Politically, one thing I&apos;m doing is trying to deconstruct what is considered &quot;oddball&quot; by<br/>doing it over and over and over again, enough for patterns and tendencies and archetypes<br/>of use to emerge from what was a mere open field for pioneering.  (I do have in my head<br/>some horrible metaphor of European expansion westward in North America, and it really<br/>doesn&apos;t fit!  An alternative tuning isn&apos;t an indigenous ecosystem waiting to be<br/>colonized/homogenized, though many can be and have been treated insensitively...)</p><p>(freedom is in the choosing, the further constraining)</p><p>For example, now that so much 17-equal music has been written and performed, we can<br/>listen and ask what some people thought was possible with 17, and we can write music<br/>that takes that into consideration, whether by taking it for granted, challenging it, or<br/>parodying it, or...?  Eventually, there grows a tradition which, because it has a name and<br/>adherents who identify with it, is at least legitimized in the sayscape of liberal correctness<br/>(but only if it does not remain invisible from within the status quo, as microtonality<br/>sometimes seems yet).</p><p>Another cue I&apos;m taking is one from Ivor Darreg, who wrote about the characteristic sound<br/>or &quot;mood&quot; particular to each different tuning, that &quot;there are no bad scales&quot;, that each one<br/>is able to do something that the others can&apos;t.  And I like this way of thinking, this musical<br/>practice, in the face of the monoculture pushed by the institutions of this society, with its<br/>insistence on objectivity and dichotomizing and causal explanations.  (I&apos;m still trying to<br/>find language that makes these distinctions effectively.)</p><p>Why ET&apos;s?  I bask in the mood-variety of so many systems which sound so different but<br/>were constructed, as lazily as possible, with the same type of organization.</p><p>&gt; Let me show you some calculations to find consonant intervals.</p><p>Be not so quick to equate small-number-just with &quot;consonance&quot;, or even usefulness.

It&apos;s pushing the phenomenon.  And I like difference tone progressions created in<br/>this manner - &lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/DifferenceToneProgressions">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/DifferenceToneProgressions</a>&gt; - but<br/>there often arises the problem (perhaps no problem at all) that the difference tone isn&apos;t<br/>also present in the tuning.  E.g. if an ET nails 11/10, there&apos;s no guarantee of it nailing<br/>11/8 and 5/4 such that it can accurately do a chord like 1:10:11.</p><p>~./<br/>Jacob</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2008 1:12:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot;<br/>&lt;tricesimoprimalist@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Daniel wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Let me show you some calculations to find consonant intervals.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Jacob wrote:<br/>&gt; Be not so quick to equate small-number-just with &quot;consonance&quot;, or<br/>even usefulness.

I do not think there is any culture though that is based on NOT doing something. What the something is that they go for is often unsolved, in which simple ratio explain only a few.<br/>The investigation into Phi where the desire was to find the most dissonant merely lead to other type of phenomenon. So while i would agree with Ricks premise of waves, there are also other &apos;patterns&apos; that humans and likewise the universe might serve as points of attraction.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> &gt; &lt;mailto:MakeMicroMusic%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &quot;Jacob&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;tricesimoprimalist@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me show you some calculations to find consonant intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacob wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Be not so quick to equate small-number-just with &quot;consonance&quot;, or<br/>&gt; even usefulness.
