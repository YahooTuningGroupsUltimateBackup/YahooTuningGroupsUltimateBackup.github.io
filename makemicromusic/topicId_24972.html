As far as the blues beginning/ending with him...I would assume from that statement that you are not a blues afficionado...besides Robert, there are T Bone Walker, Johnny Otis, Esther Phillips, Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Patton, Muddy, Wolf, BB, Albert and Freddie King, John Lee Hooker, Bessie Smith, Eric Clapton, Blind Blake, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Wille Johnson (and McTell), Bonnie Raitt, Count Basie, Cleanhead Vinson, Son House, Skip James, Charlie Parker (inventor of several blues forms), Stevie Ray Vaughan, Elmore James, Miles Davis, George Benson, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, Billie Holiday, Mississippi John Hurt, Roosevelt Sykes, John Hammond Jr, Ma Rainey, John Mayall, Duane Allman, Big Bill Broonzy, Buddy Guy, Willie Dixon, Earl Hooker, Robert Jr Lockwood, Sonny Boy Williamson, Little Walter, James Cotton, Otis Spann, Bob Lohr, Johnny Winter, Jimmie Smith, Bobby Bland, Albert Collins, Joe Houston, Jimmie Vaughan, Jimmy Reed, Little Milton, and so many more I could be here all day.</p><p>   I have studied and copped ideas from many of those mentioned above. Blues, although a relatively young art form, is as deep as any music ever played in any culture in any time period. And it is indeed American, but with far reaching roots that extend to Africa and Islamic music...and microtonal as all getout. Where it goes in the future is wide open...but using other tunings to compose with is a very fruitful avenue...there&apos;s a lot yet to be done with this most beautiful of forms...best...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24973 href="#24973">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2011 10:26:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 10:01 AM 1/26/2011, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Carl...was just listening to Johnson the last couple of days...have<br/>&gt;semi adapted his &quot;Preachin&apos; Blues&quot; as an oud piece, we&apos;ll see how it<br/>&gt;turns out.</p><p>Hi Neil- this sounds like an excellent idea!</p><p>&gt;As far as the blues beginning/ending with him...I would<br/>&gt;assume from that statement that you are not a blues<br/>&gt;afficionado...</p><p>That&apos;s very true, I know very little about it.</p><p>&gt;besides Robert, there are T Bone Walker, Johnny Otis,<br/>&gt;Esther Phillips, Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Patton, Muddy, Wolf, BB, Albert<br/>&gt;and Freddie King, John Lee Hooker, Bessie Smith, Eric Clapton, Blind<br/>&gt;Blake, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Wille Johnson (and McTell), Bonnie<br/>&gt;Raitt, Count Basie, Cleanhead Vinson, Son House, Skip James, Charlie<br/>&gt;Parker (inventor of several blues forms), Stevie Ray Vaughan, Elmore<br/>&gt;James, Miles Davis, George Benson, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell,<br/>&gt;Billie Holiday, Mississippi John Hurt, Roosevelt Sykes, John Hammond<br/>&gt;Jr, Ma Rainey, John Mayall, Duane Allman, Big Bill Broonzy, Buddy Guy,<br/>&gt;Willie Dixon, Earl Hooker, Robert Jr Lockwood, Sonny Boy Williamson,<br/>&gt;Little Walter, James Cotton, Otis Spann, Bob Lohr, Johnny Winter,<br/>&gt;Jimmie Smith, Bobby Bland, Albert Collins, Joe Houston, Jimmie Vaughan,<br/>&gt;Jimmy Reed, Little Milton, and so many more I could be here all day.</p><p>I don&apos;t think of Hendrix, Basie, Miles, or Charlie Parker as blues<br/>artists but I guess there&apos;s no hard line.

I just meant<br/>that there seems to be a big jump between Delta and later styles.<br/>Delta blues feels like a natural phenomenon, like an indigenous<br/>traditional form.  The offshoots seem more... I don&apos;t know how to<br/>put it into words.  What&apos;s the spark that I hear in traditional music<br/>the world over, which is missing in Westernized forms?

Jazz took<br/>the approach of blending this with traditional meantone tonality, as<br/>well as exploring some novel musical territory. Hendrix, on the other<br/>hand, could not get enough of the 96/95 unison vector. That is,<br/>assuming that C,,,-C,,-C,-C-E-Bb-Eb in 12-tet is in the field of<br/>attraction for 1:2:4:8:10:14:19, which seems like a reasonable guess<br/>to me.</p><p>Whether this characteristic is enough of a genre-defining<br/>characteristic to still keep calling music using these harmonic<br/>features &quot;the blues&quot; is a very valid debate, but not what I was<br/>originally getting at.</p><p>Lots of people also took influences from &quot;the blues,&quot; one of which is<br/>that they started exploring whatever limited glimpse into higher-limit<br/>harmonies that 12-tet afforded them, and in a functional and tonal<br/>context. I&apos;ve often wondered if there&apos;s a way to generalize what the<br/>blues is doing, in a similar way that the blues extended 5-limit<br/>tonality, for 11-limit and 13-limit harmonies.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=24985 href="#24985">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2011 4:47:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hendrix, on the other<br/>&gt; hand, could not get enough of the 96/95 unison vector.
