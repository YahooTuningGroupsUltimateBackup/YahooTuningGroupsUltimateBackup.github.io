So there<br/>you go.

You can have up to 1000 divisions per octave, that can be<br/>user-defined. Metatrack, another uisoftware product, can used to combine<br/>Metasynth images successively and simultaneously, each with a different tuning,<br/>so there&apos;s a workaround if you want non-octave-repeating scales, and I&apos;d really<br/>recommend getting Metatrack if you&apos;re going to make music with Metasynth.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also as far as I gather it&apos;s non-real-time - you can&apos;t play it from a<br/>&gt; keyboard or anything; seems that real-time is becoming sort of a essential<br/>&gt; requirement for being a soft synth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any one know for sure? This is from my reading their documentation.</p><p>By itself it&apos;s non-real-time. Some members of the uisoftware list have<br/>enthusiastically reported using Ableton Live to trigger Metasynth sounds in<br/>live performance. I&apos;ve never tried this.</p><p>For me, the Metasynth/Metatrack combination has been great fun and a powerful<br/>sound design tool.
