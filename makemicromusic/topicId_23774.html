Every musician knows about its problems.</p><p>Then there are many other questions connected to tuning - melodic/polymelodic music versus harmonic music, tonality versus atonality (for example dodecaphony), simple chords versus complex chords...</p><p>From this point of view what is &quot;the perfect tuning&quot;? JI? Maybe for simple chords, but for more complex chromatic chords probably not... And how to judge or evaluate unusual xenharmonic chords, how composer should work with them? They are not inferior to 12 JI. We are just in the very beginning of microtonal composition theory.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 2 Dec 2010, at 8:17 PM, Giancarlo DALMONTE wrote:</p><p>&gt; In the description of the site is written MakeMicroMusic, inter alia,<br/>&gt; that the system 12tET &quot;dominated the Western music for the last 150 &gt; years. &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I understand the meaning of this phrase, but do not agree with<br/>&gt; the wording.<br/>&gt; If you go back 150 years, approximately, we arrive at the english<br/>&gt; musicologist Alexander J.

What the statement means is that 12 notes an octave equal temperament has been almost exclusively used in the &quot;Western&quot; musical tradition for 150 years. This date has nothing to do with when 12 note equal temperament was invented. After all, it has been invented many many times by different people and is a natural tuning for fretted instruments.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Giancarlo DALMONTE &lt;giancarlodalmonte@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the description of the site is written MakeMicroMusic, inter alia,<br/>&gt; that the system 12tET &quot;dominated the Western music for the last 150 years. &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I understand the meaning of this phrase, but do not agree with<br/>&gt; the wording.<br/>&gt; If you go back 150 years, approximately, we arrive at the english<br/>&gt; musicologist Alexander J.
