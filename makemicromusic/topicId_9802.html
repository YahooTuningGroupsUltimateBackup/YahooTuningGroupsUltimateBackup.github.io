You want a<br/>concert, I have a concert...</p><p>Microtonal.... Hmmm. Let&apos;s see... Hmmm... Oh yes, Brian<br/>Ferneyhough, &apos;way microtonal.</p><p>The others.... I guess it depends on the performance... :) (I be<br/>bad..)</p><p>Here&apos;s the scoop:</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>On Tuesday, May 24, 2005, 8PM, the Composers Concordance hosts the<br/>final concert of our 2004-2005 season with a varied concert at the<br/>New York University Loewe Theatre, 35 W. 4th Street (between<br/>Washington Square East and Greene Street).</p><p>Partially a homage to American composer Meyer Kupferman, who died<br/>last year at the age of 77, this concert will feature two of his<br/>works: the first is the dynamic Moonsticks for solo marimba as<br/>performed by Peter Jarvis, an active reflection on the medieval tune<br/>L&apos;Homme Arme (&quot;the armed man&quot;). The second is Five Flicks, performed<br/>by Esther Lamneck, clarinet, and Paul Hoffmann, piano. This is a<br/>piece of five contrasting sections, almost movie vignettes, which<br/>show the full range of Kupferman&apos;s eclectic style, even including a<br/>hint of klezmer.</p><p>Erin Lesser on solo flute will navigate the impenetrable but engaging<br/>shoals of Cassandra&apos;s Dream Song by Brian Ferneyhough. Ferneyhough<br/>writes rich, complex music that challenges and engages the performer<br/>in a kind of self-analysis rarely seen before.</p><p>Alla Borzova will be featured in her usually ebullient style in<br/>Images Francaises for new music enthusiast Ana Milosavjevic, violin<br/>and the composer at the piano. Borzova writes emotionally compelling<br/>and substantial music that has the power to convince and please any<br/>new music skeptic.</p><p>Patrick Hardish continues his exploration of influences of jazz and<br/>popular culture in his Fantasy Swing for piano and drum set,<br/>performed by Paul Hoffmann on piano with Tom Goldstein on drums.<br/>Although the piano part is mostly in Hardish&apos;s &quot;classical&quot; style, the<br/>addition of drums creates an entirely different effect.</p><p>Saxophonist Paul Bro will be coming from Chicago to perform Libby<br/>Larsen&apos;s Bid Call with Kurt Fowler, cello. This piece has elements of<br/>whimsy with the rhythmic patterning of a country auctioneer in<br/>Larsen&apos;s exceptionally competent mix.</p><p>And Marc Antonio Consoli will present his Sciuri Novi IV with horn<br/>player Karl Kramer. This unusual piece will have three pre-recorded<br/>horn tracks by Mr. Kramer and the addition of a fourth live part. The<br/>concept behind Sciuri Novi IV is to create a piece that involves<br/>clones of one instrument, hence making a &quot;super-instrument.&quot; In this<br/>case we are using horn in a &quot;supersized&quot; environment.</p><p>Tickets are $12, $8 students, seniors, TDF accepted. Information can<br/>be found at <a href="http://www.composersconcordance.org">www.composersconcordance.org</a> (212-564-4899). We look<br/>forward to seeing you at the concert!</p></div>
