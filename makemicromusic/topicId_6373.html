Johnson &#x3C;akjmicro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 9:03:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey,</p><p>If no one else feels the way I do about this, I&apos;ll shut up and let nature take<br/>it&apos;s course.</p><p>I&apos;m getting a little disturbed, however, that the Tuning List vibe of<br/>math/theory issues is becoming the prevalent &apos;gestalt&apos; even over here on MMM,<br/>where I used to love to come for a breath of non-technical fresh air,<br/>right-brained intuitive thinking, sharing of works, aesthetics, etc. Now, it<br/>seems like there is no difference (that I can tell) between MMM and the old<br/>tuning list. It only took a week.</p><p>Now, I bring up the old conundrum--theory vs. practice, and why we can&apos;t<br/>incorporate both into one list, etc. Let me be brief and say that the math<br/>has always dominated the Tuning List, and MMM was a nice place to come to get<br/>that &apos;tempered&apos; by aesthetic, compositional, and hardware/software concerns.</p><p>I don&apos;t know the answer here folks. Just thought I&apos;d risk raising my alarm and<br/>see if anyone else felt the same.</p><p>I&apos;d almost propose the insane (or is it--it might be a wonderful change)<br/>solution of a composition-only list (I thought MMM would be that candidate),<br/>a theory-only list, and a hardware/software discussion list.</p><p>What I&apos;d like to see is people discussing actual microtonal works, and theory<br/>in that case would only be relevant where it concerned the work(s) under<br/>discussion. Any general discussions of microtonal aesthetics would also be<br/>considered relevant. Again, I admit a problem with drawing the line, but I<br/>woud say as soon as the terminology of &apos;ennalimmeal&apos;, &apos;monzos&apos; and &apos;vals&apos;<br/>pops up on MMM, I feel MMM is no longer MMM.</p><p>For instance, a subject thread might be Kyle Gann&apos;s &apos;Custer&apos;s Ghost&apos; and it&apos;s<br/>use of &apos;just dissonance&apos;, and how he used that resource in that particular<br/>work, etc., and the effect of that on the listener.</p><p>For now let me say that I don&apos;t take much interest in many of the recent<br/>trends and threads of MMM, which are indistinguishable from the standard<br/>tuning list. I think those topics are fine and interesting to some, but<br/>should stay over there, IMO, where they are more on topic, and not here,<br/>where they are much less so.</p><p>Something funny is happening to the community--an internal rupture of some<br/>sort. Carl leaving; Jon saying he won&apos;t post anything but announcements;<br/>flaming and ego battles; -- all these things are making a lot of people who<br/>should be friends very bitter (it seems) at each other. It&apos;s sad--the tuning<br/>community right before Peter Wakefield Sault was at a nice point, right after<br/>he came and left, he left a nasty tone and division in his wake, it seems.<br/>And now McLaren has stirred up a nasty vibe at metatuning as well. At least<br/>that&apos;s how I recall the history of how I&apos;ve felt about the community.</p><p>Now I&apos;ll duck under a boulder while the bullets fly at me and across me, and<br/>the &apos;camps&apos; split into two or three. (It would be great to see a potentially<br/>sensitive post receive a measured response where this didn&apos;t happen !!!!<br/>Let&apos;s try it...)</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6376 href="#6376">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 10:42:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

My last making microtonal music session, on Tuesday, was<br/>entirely focused on 15-equal. It&apos;s easy on the Korg Karma: just set<br/>the &quot;pitch slope&quot; on the oscillators to 0.8.</p><p>&gt; Questions I<br/>&gt; really would love to ask:<br/>&gt; 1) What 15-equal pieces are there, which have you heard, which do<br/>&gt;you like and why?</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of stuff. Out of Blackwood&apos;s, I like the electronic<br/>etude more than the guitar suite, but the open strings in the latter<br/>form the juicy 5-equal pentad. I&apos;ve enjoyed Herman Miller&apos;s &quot;Mizarian<br/>Porcupine Overture&quot; in several versions, and that&apos;s in 15-equal.<br/>Randy Winchester did something nice with it, as did other tuning list<br/>people I can&apos;t recall at the moment. I haven&apos;t heard Clem Fortuna&apos;s<br/>music yet, but I hope to.</p><p>&gt; Which would in fact be &quot;essential&quot;?</p><p>I plan to create some :)</p><p>&gt; 2) What are your successes/failures in getting average musicians to<br/>hear and play the<br/>&gt; intervals found within 15 (which I find myself categorizing as [1/1<br/>16/15 12/11 8/<br/>&gt; 7 6/5 5/4 21/16 11/8] plus their octave-inversions)?</p><p>I think different intervals can be heard in different ways, depending<br/>on context. So I don&apos;t think such a &apos;rationalization&apos; is useful at<br/>all -- particularly intervals as complex as 21/16. For example, the 3-<br/>step interval is close to 8/7, but can even be easily heard as a<br/>functional 7/6 in some contexts -- such as the music we were making<br/>on Tuesday. I&apos;d be happy to go a lot further on this on the tuning<br/>list, if you ask.</p><p>&gt; How do they react to the<br/>&gt; absence of anything resembling a whole tone?</p><p>You don&apos;t want to try anything too diatonic-scaley in 15 -- this is<br/>one of the major failings of Blackwood&apos;s guitar suite, in my opinion.<br/>Either keep the modulations flowing faster than the scale can<br/>complete itself, or use other scales -- I especially like<br/>the &apos;porcupine&apos; scales (3 2 2 2 2 2 2 and 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 -- also try<br/>replacing the &apos;3&apos; with 2+1 or 1+2) and the &apos;blackwood&apos; scale (2 1 2 1<br/>2 1 2 1 2 1, variations possible). These are rich in triads and make<br/>for nice smooth alien melodies . . . they also have unique chord<br/>progressions and modulations that can&apos;t be done in 12-equal . . .</p><p>&gt; 3)  What, from your experience, is 15 *good* at?  How does it<br/>&gt;affect form, rhythm,<br/>&gt; affect? (This is, of course, the only thing that people mean by<br/>&gt;the &quot;mood&quot; of a scale.)</p><p>15 keeps you moving fast, since most of the intervals are pretty far<br/>from JI, and sitting on them can be &quot;painful&quot;. Notable exceptions are<br/>the 4- and 11-step intervals (which are great approximations of 6:5<br/>and 5:3).</p></div>
