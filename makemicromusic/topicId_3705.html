J. Scott</p><p>Over Seas, Cyberenaissance, Vol. 6 by Marc Jones</p><p>--</p><p>It is my distinct privledge to introduce to you a rare treat.</p><p>Imagine an album of electroacoustic microtonal music played with an electric<br/>string quartet. Imagine a four movement suite navigating the worlds of 32<br/>tone Equal Temperament (tET), followed by a suite with 49tET played against<br/>22, then 29, then 31, then 26tET.</p><p>No synthesizers. No tuning software. Only raw, bare-metal musicianship.<br/>Human fingers touching strings and holding wood.</p><p>So far we are looking at some extreme musicianship and certainly a worthy<br/>technical accomplishment in the world of live performance if nothing else.</p><p>But what if on top of this, the music was fantastic, sublime, reminescent of<br/>the days when men were men wearing wigs and women were women drinking bowls<br/>of coffee and composers were real composers walking hundreds of miles to<br/>hear the latest in pipe organ technology?</p><p>Marc Jones&apos; Over Seas is about alien familiarity. About the strange and<br/>unimaginable in the context of the familiar. He describes one track as the a<br/>dance in which the middle east meets flamenco. Another track captures his<br/>experiences in Judo attacking imagined opponents. The first suite is about a<br/>sea voyage, the second about foreign lands. But that is just a small part.<br/>The music travels the world and explores the world beyond, as familiar as a<br/>travel movie while intouchably unknowable at the same time.</p><p>Without even a remote competitor, this is the best microtonal album<br/>released so far in 2002.</p><p>Only 25 minutes long? Big deal I say. I would much rather pay $12 for 25<br/>minutes of outstanding music than $17 for an album with one good 4 minute<br/>song and 81 minutes of dull stuff I never want to hear again.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;m saying:</p><p>There are eight tracks on this album and every one of them is intricately,<br/>meticulously and artistically hand-crafted. There is not a single dud track<br/>on the album. Just try and find 25 minutes of prime tracks on any other<br/>album.</p><p>I&apos;ve played it a lot and have not gotten bored of it at all. That&apos;s quite an<br/>accomplishment in itself.</p><p>Amazingly, it&apos;s also something that satisfies my cravings for extreme and<br/>radical experimentalism while being able to pass as extremely conventional<br/>and pleasant to those who simply do not know what is happening on this<br/>album.</p><p>What to compare it to? It is as good as Beauty in the Beast. Yes! It&apos;s that<br/>good.</p><p>But Beauty was Carlos&apos; Swan Song, where as this is Orphon Soul&apos;s first<br/>public release. I can only imagine (no I can&apos;t) what Marc&apos;s got on the<br/>burner next.</p><p>But wait! Beauty was composed using synthesizers and MIDI sequencers. Here<br/>we have an entirely electro-acoustic album. Marc playing electric violin and<br/>guitar himself in a variety of uncommonly used scales that would give<br/>graduates from Julliard, Stanford, or U. of Illinois screaming nightmares,<br/>cold sweats, inexplicable fears and ultimately -- raw terror. So from a<br/>performance standpoint this album kicks the best in the field down into the<br/>dirt. I love Carlos&apos; work dearly but I know she can&apos;t play like Marc can.</p><p>The mix is not exotic, it&apos;s pretty straightforward. So last year&apos;s top<br/>offering Galunlati by maestro Jacky Ligon does have more going for it in<br/>terms of the beauty of the mix and the wide variety of instruments but those<br/>things would probably be over the top for New Baroque music like Over Seas.</p><p>I hear Bach. I hear the Beatles. Amazingly though it does not sound like a<br/>school counterpoint exercise, which is what most would-be Baroque composers<br/>sound like. No, Marc has absolutely mastered the Art of Counterpoint in a<br/>way that has not been heard for 300 years. Here again I could compare to<br/>Carlos&apos; work. She has written enjoyable Classical style music but it just<br/>doesn&apos;t touch the level of the Old Masters. But that&apos;s OK; there&apos;s nothing<br/>wrong with that because we know that that Knowledge was lost a long time<br/>ago.</p><p>Is Marc the reincarnation of a Baroque Master? How else could he do what he<br/>does?</p><p>--</p><p>Over Seas; Cyberenaissance, Vol. 6 - by Marc Jones, 2002</p><p>Available for $10 + $2 S/H at <a href="http://orphonsoul.com/">http://orphonsoul.com/</a></p><p>(Note: this is a professionally produced and shrink-wrapped CD, not a CD-R.)</p></div><h3><a id=3707 href="#3707">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

It&apos;s only a frolic.&quot;  :X</p><p>Thanks Jeff.</p><p>I had&apos;t announced the CD formally or forcefully yet because our web swiper<br/>was creating ghost sales.  It would say thank you for your order, NOT charge<br/>your credit card, and NOT email us the sale.  And there were a good 20-30<br/>people I KNOW for a fact were going to buy it as soon as the page went up.<br/>We should be ironing that all out in the next day or two finally but in the<br/>meantime, yeah we can take PayPal, check or money order.</p><p>I&apos;ll also be putting up a few soundbytes and stuff soon, you know, an<br/>*actual* web page.  And the big question, why is Cyb Volume 6 the first one<br/>shrink wrapped?  It&apos;s the first one finished.  Now that I have most<br/>production specs the way I want them, We should be putting out music at a<br/>fairly good rate for awhile, at least at first finalizing everything that&apos;s<br/>already half way there.</p><p>I haven&apos;t been posting to any lists for awhile because I&apos;d pretty much<br/>gotten tired of trying to explain the depths of theories THAT I ACTUALLY USE<br/>in practice.  I thought better, a bit inspired by this list, just work on<br/>the music and let the music do the talking.</p><p>It started feeling useless to describe the methods used in a music no one<br/>really knew about.  Know what I mean.  So at this point I can start just<br/>putting the music out and if anyone has any questions on scales and whatever<br/>else I put behind the scenes I&apos;ll leave myself available to answer.</p><p>Besides that, I may get more social again here soon anyway.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3><a id=4239 href="#4239">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2003 1:41:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Headline:  MAN SEARCHES FOR CHECKBOOK FOR FIVE MONTHS.</p><p>On 8/21/02 8:29 PM, &quot;Jonathan M.
