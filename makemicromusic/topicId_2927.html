You mean by calling them &quot;marimbas&quot;?

The root is &quot;Rimba&quot;, which<br/>means &quot;note&quot;.  Ma- is plural.  Thus, &quot;many notes&quot;.  Same goes for<br/>other instruments like Timbila (plural of Mbila) etc. etc.  At one<br/>point in time in Zimbabwe&apos;s past, the word marimba was used for the<br/>instrument now referred to as Mbira or kalimba (plural of Limba),<br/>which as we all know is a lamellophone.</p><p>     Xylophone is a greek word, Xylo = wood, Phone = sound.</p><p>     Marimbas can be made of wood, metal, glass, stone, or whatever.</p><p>     Xylophones are made of wood.</p><p>     Metallophones are made of metal.</p><p>     Around 100 years ago, the words xylophone and marimba started to<br/>depart from one another in orchestral usage.  Marimba became known as<br/>the lower of the two instruments, always with resonators, the tuning<br/>of the second partial eventually evolving to two octaves above the<br/>fundamental (4/1), and the third partial, three octaves and a major<br/>third (10/1).  Xylophones became known as the higher of the two,<br/>almost always overlapping in register, sometimes having resonators,<br/>sometimes not.  The second partial eventually became standardized at<br/>the octave and a fifth (3/1).  I don&apos;t know about the third partial,<br/>or if it was just too high a pitch to worry about.  Tuning of the<br/>third partial on a marimba is abandoned at the upper end.</p><p>     This is all Western usage.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t tell you how many times people ask me about my &quot;xylophone&quot;.</p><p>     I play traditional Zimbabwean mbira.  I can&apos;t tell you how many<br/>times people ask me about my &quot;thumb piano&quot;.  Do I care?</p><p>&gt; B) for those making or considering making aluminum tubed things,<br/>&gt;6061-T6 is the best alloy I have found. Works easy, but stays in<br/>&gt;tune.</p><p>     I have yet to hear aluminum tubing sound as nicely (to my ear)<br/>as steel.  What is this tubing you mention and where can I obtain it?</p><p>     Jon again:<br/>   (SVG)&gt;The ideal striking point is the anitinode, which the ends<br/>&gt;come just a bit short of reaching.</p><p>&gt;Is this a typo, and it should read &quot;antinode&quot;? I haven&apos;t heard of<br/>&gt;the term (in either spelling), and the concept of &apos;mystery points&apos;<br/>&gt;of striking are fascinating. Is there a source on this somewhere?</p><p>     Yes, antinode.  This is the term used to refer to &quot;the point of<br/>maximal vibration&quot; for the particular mode in question.  Here we are<br/>trying to coax out the fundamental mode, as opposed to the upper<br/>partials.  On a stringed instrument, the antinode is the center of<br/>the open string.  A piece of conduit will have its nodes roughly<br/>around 2/9ths of the length.  The antinode is then &quot;two-and-a-half<br/>ninths&quot; away from the nodes (meaning the center of the bar), while<br/>the ends fall short of the antinodes by half of 1/9th.  I am using<br/>lay persons math here so as not to confuse any but the mathemeticians<br/>in the crowd :)</p><p>     SVG&gt;Fortunately, conduit does respond well to being struck on<br/>&gt;the ends, though less so in the lower regions.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Good to know; how low in pitch can conduit instruments be effective?</p><p>     My work was mostly with 3/4&quot; conduit.  I found it to be more<br/>musically useful (again, to my ear) than either 1/2&quot; or 1&quot;.  Middle C<br/>is a great stopping point, and I have gone down as far as F below<br/>that (as in the 53 ET instrument).  This low F is beginning to sound<br/>too weak on its own.  Softer mallets are useful in bringing out the<br/>fundamental, as is striking the center.  Still I wouldn&apos;t want to go<br/>much lower.</p><p>     Jon again: &gt;&gt;as well as the tubes being open on both ends -<br/>&gt;solid bars are definitely helped by resonators.</p><p>     Yes, solid bars are helped by resonators.  Though the open ends<br/>of the conduit neither add to nor detract from anything.  The fact<br/>that they are round is the main reason that resonators don&apos;t help<br/>much.  A square tube of the same size will respond much more readily<br/>to a resonator than a round tube.</p><p>&gt;&gt;.....Hmmm. You mean by calling them &quot;marimbas&quot;? Well, there is<br/>&gt;nothing about the word marimba that is intrinsically about wood,</p><p>     Correct.</p><p>     ...and<br/>&gt;Deagan themselves made, for a short period in the 1920&apos;s, what they<br/>&gt;called a &quot;Steel Marimba&quot;.

Just because Deagan used the word, doesn&apos;t mean<br/>they were using it correctly.  They *were* using it correctly, I&apos;m<br/>just trying to undermine the logic that &quot;just because so-and-so calls<br/>it that...&quot;</p><p>     I call it a conduit marimba in part because of my African roots,<br/>and in part because I can&apos;t stand the term tubalong (merrily we<br/>tubalong...) or even tubulong, as Erv calls it.  (With due respect to<br/>EW.)</p><p>     One last point is this whole discussion...  Adding reflectors or<br/>resonators to a conduit marimba gives it more amplitude.  And this<br/>increase in amplitude comes at the expense of sustain (robbing Peter<br/>to pay Paul).  This is a good thing in my book.  Also, any conduit<br/>marimba can be played with a damping technique, either devoting an<br/>entire hand to the task (as with most Javanese and Balinese<br/>metallophones), or developing damping techniques with both playing<br/>hands.  This is done with the Gender type of Balinese and Javanese<br/>instrument (not for the timid).</p><p>     SVG</p></div><h3><a id=2940 href="#2940">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Just some brief items...</p><p>One thing I noted in general from Jeff&apos;s questions (about marimba and xylophone) was the &quot;why&quot; part of it, and I thought about the ways the two terms could have become used in the vernacular that would blur their true identities.

Empirical/experimental testing, or is this a standard<br/>&gt; &gt; physical/acoustic phenomenon?</p><p>     The latter.  A resonator responds to air being displaced near<br/>the proximity of the opening.  A round tube tends to vibrate not only<br/>in the direction it was struck, but in all directions.  Thus it is<br/>not directing the displaced air in two directions (towards the<br/>resonator and away from it), but rather in all directions equally.  A<br/>square tube will also have that tendency, though it will displace air<br/>in four directions, one for each surface.</p><p>     I have made several mentions recently of two issues of<br/>Experimental Musical Instruments which contained a wealth of<br/>information about all things conduit.  (Vol. 10 #2 and Vol. 10 #3)<br/>Also Vol. 2 #2, and various mentions interspersed from issue to<br/>issue.  One of the suggestions that came forth about using resonators<br/>with conduit, was to attach a small slightly concave piece of sheet<br/>metal, about the size of a half dollar, to the center of the note,<br/>just over the resonator.  This effectively transfers some of the<br/>vibration of the bar into air moving in the direction of the<br/>resonator.  This is similar to using square tubing.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve seemed to find that rounded<br/>&gt; &gt; objects, both tubes and circular plates, have fewer harmonics,<br/>&gt; &gt; and wonder how square bars would sound...<br/>&gt; &gt; Definitely something worth looking into, someday.</p><p>     I believe &quot;partial&quot; is the word you&apos;re looking for<br/>here.  &quot;Harmonic&quot; refers to partials that are contained within the<br/>harmonic series.  Usually though not always, contained in wind and<br/>string sounds.</p><p>     I have never made this observation (of lower partial content) in<br/>rounded vs. non-rounded objects, and my experience does not support<br/>it.  Perhaps you have some clear examples?  Conduit tubes have an<br/>extreme amount of high partial content, it just depends on what you<br/>hit it with.  (I know some neighborhood cats with high partial<br/>content, but that&apos;s another story...)</p><p>&gt; I read somewhere that square section tubes have tuning problems. I<br/>&gt; took this to mean uncertainty or a wavering in their pitch above<br/>&gt; and beyond the usual inharmonic partials when played. Anybody<br/>&gt; experienced this?<br/>&gt;<br/>     Many years ago, Erv Wilson made an instrument using brass square<br/>tubes.  With this relatively soft metal, and the fact that the<br/>playing surface was flat, the notes eventually became dented and<br/>dropped in pitch because of that.  Perhaps this story has trickled<br/>down to you in some form?  The same thing would have happened with<br/>round brass tubing, though the flat surface was especially vulnerable.</p><p>     I made mention in a previous posting of using a reflector under<br/>the notes to bounce back some of the sound.  I forgot to mention<br/>another quality that a reflector can have.  If the material is thin,<br/>like 1/8&quot; masonite (hardboard) or plywood, and the reflector is not<br/>sitting on the floor, it has a chance to vibrate as well, becoming a<br/>radiator in the process.  This is the concept that applies to the<br/>back of an acoustic guitar.  If the guitar is not held tight to the<br/>body, the back has a chance to radiate the sound as well as reflect<br/>it and the sound it noticeably improved.  Even lifting it an inch off<br/>the floor can have dramatic results.</p><p>     SVG</p></div><h3><a id=2981 href="#2981">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 1:39:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Steven!<br/>    This brass instrument was used in the TV Series -Kung Fu.
