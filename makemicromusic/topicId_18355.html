I might as well kill two birds with one stone if you guys can<br/>get me in touch anybody related to Novaro and his work<br/>so I can get in touch well in advance.</p><p>I would also like to visit the library of the Conservatoire in Mexico<br/>City and some of Carrillo&apos;s relatives who I have been in touch with<br/>for a while.</p><p>As for the Carrillo and Novaro matter,<br/>Two quotations from:</p><p>Jean-Charles Fran&ccedil;ois, 1990. &apos;Fixed Timbre, Dynamic Timbre&apos;<br/>Perspectives of New Music, Vol.28, Nol2 (Summer 1990), pp.112-118</p><p>1) &quot;In music of the western tradition, before the electronic era,<br/>timbre was considered secondary, as an ornamentation of pitch&quot;</p><p>And so did Novaro who was supported by Carlos Ch&aacute;vez, who wrote<br/>several articles against Carrillo. This might have<br/>turn off Carrillo&apos;s ideas of supporting such an innovative young<br/>composer who might have paid the price of this confrontation.<br/>Novaro&apos;s lack of formal training might have also been a problem in<br/>the Conservatoire and Carrillo was certainly surprised<br/>he got a Guggeheim grant (which gave him a chance to develop his ideas)</p><p>Ch&aacute;vez was the other leading figure of Mexico&apos;s contemporary music at<br/>the time, together with Carrillo. That is all it comes<br/>to I would guess, but I should enquire a bit further, specially after<br/>Novaro came back to Mexico completing his Guggeheim<br/>research.</p><p>I have been informed by Ernesto Sol&iacute;s Winkler that Carrillo never<br/>tried to monopolize the Sound 13 theories since Carrillo<br/>always trained his students to play in all the microtonal systems and<br/>promoted their musics too! For example the microtonal<br/>works of Rafael Adame, Jer&oacute;nimo Baqueiro and Elvira Larios were<br/>played in 1924 together with his works for sound 13<br/>which had also just been completed.</p><p>This might have all been a politic matter against the Carlos Ch&aacute;vez<br/>group, but nothing to do with music.</p><p>As for the music of Juli&aacute;n Carrillo and I would also include here the<br/>work of Johnny Reinhard,<br/>the large division of the octave is not a matter of going as far for<br/>the sake of comparison to the<br/>others but for the sake of timbre.</p><p>2) A second quotation from the same article:</p><p>&quot;Since it can be measured very precisely by ear, pitch is better<br/>equipped in its capacity to articulate a logical language&quot;</p><p>and in the case of Novaro, the language of ratios, but in the case of<br/>Carrillo it was more a matter of a language for the perception.</p><p>Let me give you a 3rd quotation:</p><p>Cornelia Fales 2002. The Paradox of Timbre. Ethnomusicology, Vol.46,<br/>No.1 (Winter, 2002). pp.56-95</p><p>3) &quot;...while timbre is a dimension of central importance to<br/>identifying sources. it is also the dimension that is most divergent<br/>from the<br/>sound in the physical world.&quot;</p><p>Juli&aacute;n Carrillo was indeed aware of the acoustics (physical world),<br/>but a hundred years ahead of the discoveries<br/>to come through electronic music in the area of timbre.</p><p>Now you get a continuum keyboard with a piano sound and you can do<br/>even better than Carrillo in his Balbuceos piece (with chromatic<br/>passages<br/>if you can get 192 ET to work or any higher than that (maybe not<br/>enough MIDI notes, right? ... so maybe we cannot even go beyond his<br/>imagination predicted<br/>yet 100 years after)</p><p>Carrillo did explore new timbres through his tunings and pitch theory<br/>and there are indeed many other areas of timbre that<br/>he neglected as we all do but the fact that he was ahead of the<br/>electronics in this matter made him unique.</p><p>I respect a lot the work of Novaro as far as pitch is concerned, and<br/>I am sure ithat if he had the technology available today he would<br/>have taken care of timbre too!</p><p>QUESTION</p><p>Did Novaro absorved the ideas of Harry Partch during his visit to the<br/>US and then combined them with Carrillo&apos;s ideas to end up with his<br/>theories???</p><p>Now let&apos;s get things right. Carrillo considered<br/>timbre to be the most important perception<br/>and he indeed succeed in his field</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
