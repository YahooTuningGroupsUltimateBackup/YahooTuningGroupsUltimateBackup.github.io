It was like being at the premiere of the rite of spring in Bali. On top of it I doubt more than a handful of western players could approoach playing this stuff. two notches above Kebyar.<br/>( their Cd which i have one does not compare unfortunately, but give one a good i dea of what they are coming out of.<br/>After hearing the full versiion of Takemitsu&apos;s In a n Autumn Garden and this, i hcan only sadly observe that IMHO the real innovation in music is no longer centered into the west.</p><p>Some people expect and hence are dissapointed that Anaphorian is not indonesian. They do us a similar scale that has some features in common , outside of that they are far more interested in developing their own idenity than in imitating something they have had only passing contact with.</p><p>Jonathan M.
