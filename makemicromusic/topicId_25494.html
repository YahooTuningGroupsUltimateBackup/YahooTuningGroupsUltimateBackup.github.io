In the beginning,<br/>when he&apos;s doing the Emaj7-sounding chord, he&apos;s using 15\16 for that<br/>major 7, which means that the difference between the major third and<br/>the major 7th is 10\16, or 750 cents, whereas the fifth he&apos;s using<br/>over the root of the chord is 9\16, or 675 cents. A very nice sound<br/>indeed.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Feb 8, 2011 at 8:57 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Just saw this on the xenharmonic wiki, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s ever been<br/>&gt; posted here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ronsword.com/sounds/Ron%20Sword%20-%2016-tone%20acoustic%20improvisation.mp3">http://www.ronsword.com/sounds/Ron%20Sword%20-%2016-tone%20acoustic%20improvisation.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So much for high-error tunings being unusable.
