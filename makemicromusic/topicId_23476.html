I get 20+ messages from the tuning list everyday, and far less from<br/>MMM (here) and Tuning-Research...and see consistently more useful (to actually<br/>making micro-tonal music)  info coming from &quot;these&quot; two lists.<br/>      If I&apos;m complaining about anything, I&apos;m complaining about people<br/>(especially Carl, but also a couple of others) whining on things like the Tuning<br/>list (all the while generating tons of outgoing messages/&quot;interest&quot;) and the<br/>corresponding lack of output and focus on lists like this one.  IMVHO<br/>something&apos;s got to give, something&apos;s got to change...and best we get the good<br/>people out of there before they get so discouraged they just give up interest in<br/>making microtonal music from their bad experiences.</p><p>&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt;- You want to talk math?

Go or don&apos;t go, there is no try.&quot;</p><p>   Right.  But apparently if you go on tuning and don&apos;t basically restrict<br/>yourself to tuning-math, you get flamed.  IMVHO people who want to talk tuning<br/>math should stick on that list instead of complaining about the lack of tuning<br/>math on other lists.  I don&apos;t know what Tuning really is supposed to be<br/>either....perhaps &quot;Carl (and Gene?)&apos;s Academic Microtonal E-mailling List&quot;<br/>(CAMEL) would be more appropriate.</p><p>&gt;&quot;- THIS place is all about *music*, and it&apos;s production. You know, MAKING<br/>&gt;microtonal music? Not lists of books, not lists of numbers, etc.&quot;<br/>  Right...and I, for one, am writing these messages in hopes of getting THIS<br/>list more active...namely getting the people who post productively on the Tuning<br/>list to post here and on other new/less-whiney groups like tuning-research more<br/>often.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Carlo is a shining example.&quot;<br/>    Agreed...and that song sounds great.  I don&apos;t think I can name much anything<br/>from either Carlo Serafani or Cameron Bobro (IE from this list in particular)<br/>that I haven&apos;t thought sounded/sounds great.  Same goes for Jacky Ligon and<br/>Marcus Satellite (though they aren&apos;t on this list so far as I know).  As for me,<br/>I wish I had more to show...but all my effort (as it has been for the last month<br/>and a half) is going into tweaking my Untwelve entry and making the melodies not<br/>repeat at all for all of its 5 minutes IE creating a true &quot;journey track&quot;.  That<br/>and exploring constant modulation between Arabic/Persian-type chords involving<br/>things like neutral second and diminished fifths and the typical 31TET &quot;quarter<br/>comma meantone-like&quot; common-practice-theory purity in a scale that includes lots<br/>of both interval types all played in tall and sustained chords.  Begs the<br/>question: how many of you have experimented with using both &quot;common practice<br/>theory&quot; 31TET chords and more Arabic-style non-common-practice chords in a<br/>single song?...I&apos;m eager to hear what others have done on that front as I&apos;m sure<br/>I&apos;m not the only one who has tried this trick....</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
