The accidentals are the Tartini-Couper set, which is built in abcm2ps. It is interesting that, in a chordal context, the intervals of 31-EDO are just noticeable, and allows very subtile transitions between the chords. For instance, listen to this piece following the score, and pay attention to the pitches F F&gt; F# at the begining and at the end.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p><p>P.S.: To play the MIDI files, disable Pseudo Reverb; with timidity, this can do:</p><p>timidity -R9 --reverb=d --reverb=g,40   file.mid</p><p>--<br/>  &apos;-------------------------------------------------------------------.<br/>Hudson Lacerda &lt;<a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/">http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/</a>&gt;<br/>*N&iuml;&iquest;&half;o deixe seu voto sumir! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&iuml;&iquest;&half;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a></p><p>                    == THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS ==<br/><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182">http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182</a><br/>  .-------------------------------------------------------------------&apos;<br/>--</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ O Yahoo! est&iuml;&iquest;&half; de cara nova.

A real gem<br/>&gt; among very interesting works here on MMM.<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; Thanks, Carl.</p><p>Actually, my only musical posts before that were an improvisation in 99-EDO to ilustrate some topics I was discussing with Yahya, and a (unfinished) score of a quarter-tone piece for clarinet and guitar which I used as microabc example some months ago. The 99-EDO improvisation could be used as basis for a composition, and, about the clarinet and guitar pieces (they are two), they cannot be emulated in MIDI, due to subtleties on timbre.</p><p>And, yes, Chris Bryan is correct about Chroma (31). It is an unfinished piece because it was not started. :-) I could wait until to have a complete movement, but since I found that &grave;&grave;excerpt&apos;&apos; was sounding interesting, I decided to show it as is currently. Later on I can develop it, adding more events and a harmonic elaboration.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Novidade no Yahoo!

But the velocity values are high indeed: from 85 to 120. BTW, doesn&apos;t your MIDI player have any volume control so that you would need modify the files with another program?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Clicking on, I enjoyed the sonorities in the third mid file - but I &gt; can&apos;t relate the three files to the two names you discussed, except to &gt; guess 1 = New, 2 = Old, 3 = Chroma?</p><p>I just suppose that people would check the scores. They are two pieces: Neo-Old(19) (musicmid1.mid) and Chroma(31) (musicmid3.mid), and a test file with a few 19-EDO chords (musicmid2.mid).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p><p>PS.: Why is your mailer sending doubled messages?</p><p>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Voc&#xFFFD; quer respostas para suas perguntas?
