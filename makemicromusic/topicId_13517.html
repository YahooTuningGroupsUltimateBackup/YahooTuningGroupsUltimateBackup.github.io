Of course, these intervals have rich<br/>possibilities for variations on Near Eastern styles, so this is only a<br/>brief glimpse of one side of 17-equal.</p><p>An important factor, both for this setting and the contest, is the<br/>matter of timbre and its interplay with the tuning. Depending on the<br/>timbre, an interval such as the regular major third at 6/17 octave or<br/>about 423.53 cents (close to 143:112 or 23:18) could have an effect<br/>ranging from very &quot;spicy,&quot; as has already been said, to sweetly rich.</p><p>Melodically, chromaticism in 17-EDO can become &quot;different&quot; and<br/>charming because the chromatic semitone (e.g. C-C#) is twice the size<br/>of the diatonic semitone (e.g. C#-D). The sample piece uses some<br/>progressions illustrating this contrast (e.g. D-C#-C in the opening of<br/>the lowest voice).</p><p>Jacob, as you have said, people who compose at the instruments to be<br/>used in the contest, or at least similar ones, might submit the most<br/>apt entries. My purpose is simply to spur people on to try 17-EDO, if<br/>they haven&apos;t already started to explore it, and enter your event.</p><p>Of course I would welcome any dialogue about this short piece, or<br/>about 17-EDO generally; thanks again for a contest that should bring<br/>out lots of creativity, and I&apos;ll try to contribute more in this<br/>tuning.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2006 10:24:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; To use the Scala .seq file, you&apos;ll need a scale file defining 17-tET<br/>&gt; (or 17-EDO), given the name in the .seq file of 17-tET.scl, like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! 17-tET.scl</p><p>It&apos;s much easier and I think better all around to simply put a line in<br/>the headers saying:</p><p>0  equal 17</p></div>
