Why not convince someone near you to do the singing if you are too shy? I like the &apos;period&apos; feel of it, but would you also like to share something about the tuning(s) used?</p><p>Then, for the first course, early this morning I get a note from Kraig Grady about a small gem he has unearthed. A lovely paean on hammered dulcimer in twin tunings, everyone should go take a listen to &quot;Untitled Love Song&quot;, found over at:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a></p><p>Thanks, Kraig; it seems impossible for you to do un-lovely music.</p><p>And lastly, today&apos;s mail arrived with the entree, Bill Sethares CD &quot;Exomusicology&quot;. I&apos;ve given each track a quick listen, and while I&apos;ve been a fan of Bill&apos;s for quite a while, the variety and quality is remarkable. I will definitely post more on this one, and I&apos;ll be asking Bill to answer - publicly - questions about a couple of the pieces. But mostly:</p><p>BILL! Would you mind posting to the list the best way for people to order a copy of the CD? I would recommend it very highly to all...</p><p>Man, just when I was about to give up on music,<br/>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=3937 href="#3937">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>11/26/2002 5:38:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;5.1.0.14.2.20021125150004.00a0ac30@...&gt;<br/>Jonathan M.

It was<br/>a real shame to stop the counterpoint sounding too exciting, but it was<br/>still fairly easy to write which is why I started with it.</p><p>I&apos;m also trying not to make it so dull that it sounds depressing.

There are 3 more I can remember now<br/>that I&apos;ve worked out the tune, but not how to write it down.
