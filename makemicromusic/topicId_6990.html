This piece is just a jump-start to writing...</p><p>Grouping replies together, he types:</p><p>To Kraig - thanks, you know I value your ear. As for the fact that it could go on, if it were real music it might. And change along the way. But that will come later.</p><p>To Dante - yeah, that little box is pretty interesting. It goes a bit farther than a standard sample-widget, and I give them high marks for ingenuity in designing a product that really attempts to do One Thing Well. I hope to do a little piece-let with one of the bagpipes.</p><p>To Robt - thanks for liking the setting as well! I&apos;ve gotten to a point in my life where plain old music (at least when it comes from my pen/mind/fingers) doesn&apos;t interest me as much as little audio stories. I&apos;ll try not to over-do the style, but I look around at the world and realize that all the sounds fascinate me, not just musical sounds. I&apos;d like them to live together in small versions/visions.</p><p>To Aaron - you wrote: &quot;I was hungry for this to be an alap, so that we could eventually have a tabla enter and groove with it.... The scale was delicious, as was the sample, which didn&apos;t tire my ears out.&quot; Funny, after I did it I *almost* went back and added some percussion, but I&apos;m trying to avoid that - not dogmatically, but... - if only because percussion is the thing I most expect I can do, and I won&apos;t grow if I don&apos;t attempt other things. See the Carl note on scale/alap...</p><p>To Kalle - you mentioned some Hindustani music (yes, I&apos;ve seen quite a few people using those &quot;sruti boxes&quot;!) I wonder if it wouldn&apos;t make sense to have one that is solar powered (maybe not in Scandinavia, but...).</p><p>To Carl - thanks for the ears. The scale? Damn, I wish I could tell you! I just turned on the music computer, but for some reason this synth doesn&apos;t show up automatically in a saved project - you have to reload it (might be a fluke of the timed demo). And I was trying different scales, and don&apos;t know if it was the scale that was programmed with the patch or another - sorry.</p><p>You mentioned: &quot;My only complaint is too much reverb on the oud, and perhaps also on the whole mix.&quot; I agree, and some of that came as an anomoly of headphone mixing. Trying to set the instruments in a virtual space without listening &apos;in the room&apos; hosed that one. I almost fixed it, but I Cheneyed the thing and shut off the box...</p><p>*****</p><p>Again, I appreciate the downloading and ear squinting. I&apos;ll keep working to put to rest the idea that Jon is all talk and no music...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7019 href="#7019">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2004 6:56:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>&gt; To Robt - thanks for liking the setting as well!

I&apos;d like them to<br/>&gt; live together in small versions/visions.</p><p>Sounds interesting :-).</p><p>I remember reading some poems by a Japanese poet Matsuo Basho<br/>- he used a mixture of prose and poetry, so the prose setting<br/>described the situation and events leaading into the poem,<br/>so each poem had a little story about it. I gather<br/>that it was a traditional Japanese way of setting<br/>out poems. By a story there, it means something very<br/>simple, just a few lines possibly, paragraph or<br/>two - that he went to a particular place, and then<br/>while listening to the waterfall beneath<br/>a cherry blossom tree he wrote this poem or<br/>something, then it gives the poem he wrote.</p><p>Maybe the same idea can be used for audio stories<br/>with audio settings leading into music<br/>then on and out in some sort of story?</p><p>So not the same as music that tells a story because<br/>the music is a kind of musical moment set within the story,<br/>rather than a story itself, with the story<br/>itself told in the audio setting, something<br/>very simple too, just the sun rising or<br/>a rain shower begins and you see a rainbow,<br/>or some such. There for instance I suppose<br/>the audio setting could be the sound of rain<br/>gradually falling more and more heavily in some<br/>audio setting, and the music blends into it<br/>and then somehow evokes the rainbow,<br/>that kind of a thing.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
