What programs do you use? Does anyone have a decent<br/>workflow set up?</p><p>I was thinking of compiling a list of different Linux DAWs and seeing<br/>how they compare with the following features</p><p>AUDIO<br/>1) has audio support<br/>2) has VST and/or AU and/or RTAS support<br/>3) can export to or import from other commercial DAWs</p><p>MIDI<br/>1) has MIDI sequencing support<br/>2) has MIDI realtime recording support<br/>3) has some way to route MIDI output to custom softsynths<br/>4) has MTS support<br/>5) has OSC support<br/>6) has some sort of notation editing capabilities<br/>6a) notation has custom accidental support</p><p>I doubt there&apos;s any single program on the planet which has all of<br/>these things, but there may be a few linux programs which have a good<br/>amount of them, letting you come up with a good workflow that way.<br/>Anyone have any insight? I was gonna spend some time comparing Ardour,<br/>LMMS, Rosegarden, and whatever else is out there with these things<br/>later.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=28811 href="#28811">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2012 12:38:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So I wanted to ask, does anyone have experience with<br/>&gt; making microtonal music on Linux?

It<br/>worked reasonably well, but I didn&apos;t like Rosegarden&apos;s<br/>interface as much as Cubasis Audio.  I wish I could find<br/>something like Cubasis Audio on Linux.  I don&apos;t think I got<br/>Rosegarden&apos;s audio functionality to work.  At least, I<br/>didn&apos;t use it, I only wanted a MIDI sequencer.  ZynAddSubFX<br/>can record its audio directly.</p><p>These days, I&apos;ve stopped using Rosegarden because I<br/>upgraded to a version that doesn&apos;t run comfortably on my<br/>machine.  If you have something more powerful to run it on<br/>it should still work for you.  I can see it would be an<br/>advantage to write music in Lilypond, then bounce it into<br/>Rosegarden to edit and clean up the performance, and maybe<br/>bounce it back into Lilypond for printing.  I haven&apos;t<br/>looked into hacking Rosegarden to work with different<br/>notations.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking of compiling a list of different Linux<br/>&gt; DAWs and seeing how they compare with the following<br/>&gt; features</p><p>I&apos;m still not sure what a DAW is.  I did look for a<br/>sequencer a few years ago.</p><p>&gt; AUDIO<br/>&gt; 1) has audio support<br/>&gt; 2) has VST and/or AU and/or RTAS support<br/>&gt; 3) can export to or import from other commercial DAWs</p><p>I remember certain applications not explicitly supporting<br/>VST for legal reasons.  But it&apos;s possible to run a LADSPA<br/>to VST bridge.  I see there&apos;s been movement on this front:</p><p><a href="http://linux-sound.org/plugins.html">http://linux-sound.org/plugins.html</a></p><p>DSSI was an unimaginative format that duplicated the MIDI<br/>pitch model.  That&apos;s fine if you&apos;re working with MIDI, of<br/>course, all you do is lie about what the pitches mean and<br/>tune at the synth level.  But what would be really nice is<br/>to have a synth format that took flexible pitches and so<br/>that you could do the tuning at a higher level.</p><p>&gt; MIDI<br/>&gt; 1) has MIDI sequencing support<br/>&gt; 2) has MIDI realtime recording support</p><p>I remember Rosegarden being the only thing I could find to<br/>do these adequately.  Maybe that&apos;s changed now.  Let me<br/>know what you find.</p><p>&gt; 6) has some sort of notation editing capabilities<br/>&gt; 6a) notation has custom accidental support</p><p>Once you have something free that you think is good, we can<br/>look at adding (6a).</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=28818 href="#28818">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2012 12:10:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Aug 25, 2012 at 5:07 PM, Tobias Schlemmer<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:Tobias.Schlemmer@tu-dresden.de">Tobias.Schlemmer@tu-dresden.de</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve some experience, but maybe not in the sense you have in mind: I&apos;m the current developer of Mutabor <a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor/">http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor/</a>. Packages for certain distributions are availlable (just ask for them). Though it is not originally a Unix program it fits more or less into the Unix philosophy: Do one thing and do it well. Our aim is retuning music including mutable tunings.</p><p>Thanks, looks very interesting! Are there any screenshots of it? I<br/>can&apos;t download it until my Mint install is up and running again,<br/>unfortunately.</p><p>&gt; As I already said: The unix philosophy is different. So you are propably right. But the problem can be solved in another way: JACK is an audio framework that routes audio and MIDI data. Clients can be Sequencers, ports, audio players/recorders and many more. One feature is that certain plugins can ask other clients to provide there session settings and to store them. There exist such programs that store and restore your session, but I haven&apos;t used them so I don&apos;t know much about the real challenges with them. (BTW. Jack is availlable for other OSs too).</p><p>So is the idea that it enables multiple applications to communicate<br/>with one another? Does this actually work, in practice, to have a MIDI<br/>sequencer routing its output to a standalone softsynth which then goes<br/>into an audio-only DAW, or something?</p><p>I&apos;m really curious how possible it is to use Linux to make<br/>high-quality, professional audio - which I don&apos;t think should be hard.<br/>As long as there&apos;s some way to run VST plugins and get audio and MIDI<br/>all working together, whether it&apos;s in one program or multiple<br/>programs, it should be possible to do professional work.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
