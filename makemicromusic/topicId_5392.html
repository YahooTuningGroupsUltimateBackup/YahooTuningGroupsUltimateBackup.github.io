And, unlike going to a store, buying a rack synth or kbd synth and then... that&apos;s it, you work with it, this other world is fluid and will always be changing.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;So, what is a &quot;decent&quot; computer speed for softsynths??  My present &gt;computer is only 350mhz, which I take it is &quot;way behind the curve...&quot;</p><p>I think so. At every point (I&apos;m only talking PCs) along the way there are a variety of speeds of CPUs available, the slowest costing the least, the fastest costing the most. And if you spend some time or - better yet - make friends with someone who is &apos;into computers&apos; for real, you can find the break point between cost and speed. Usually you will see a little ledge in price, where it starts to jump up.</p><p>All I can say, when you are using a computer for cpu- and/or ram-intensive use: get as much as you can afford, get as fast as you can afford. There is no other way to say it.</p><p>When I started looking at all this soft stuff last year, I figured &quot;hell, what a bunch of crap - latency so bad I could make a recording of my fingernails hitting the keys and then you would hear the synth *after* the clicking&quot; and a host of other problems. Since having a beefier box, almost all those problems went away.</p><p>The other thing is: if you want to get into this area you need to accept the fluidity of the situation and you have to be comfortable tweaking and getting &apos;under the hood&apos; a bit, in understanding some of the hardware/software interactions. You don&apos;t have to be a total tech-head, but I really don&apos;t look at this as different from the centuries of composers studying what instruments could, and could not, do and knowing that this orchestration would work and this one would fail. Studying the instruments and the players was &apos;tech&apos; in those days.</p><p>&gt;Composer Patrick Grant sent me a softsynth called the FM7 that had some &gt;nice FM sounds, but it didn&apos;t install *drivers* so there was no way to run &gt;it from my sequencer...</p><p>All I know at this point is your computer, which is probably not going to give you much satisfaction in softsynth areas; what I *don&apos;t* know about is your audio hardware - the sound card that you reproduce this on. I mention this because all the newer audio cards are the ones that support the methodology and drivers necessary for fast audio creation/reproduction: most notably is the form known as ASIO, and there are also WDM drivers (we don&apos;t need to get into detail on this).</p><p>Just as people who build dedicating gaming computers know, you identify the areas on the computer that are critical to key functions (for them it is cpu, ram, and the *video* card, for us the first two and the *audio* card) and maximise them.</p><p>I&apos;m going to start telling people that unless they have current hardware them might as well look at other solutions for making music, because trying to run softsynths on old hardware will only frustrate, and no one needs more frustration in life.</p><p>&gt;I had better success with Peter Frazier&apos;s *Midicode* synth, which *can* be &gt;run through drivers on different channels from my sequencer.</p><p>But that is not the kind of synth that will take your music to the next level. It is a good thing, indeed, and I&apos;ve reserve my old computer, which will soon have all the junk taken off the hard drive, reformatted, and then will be a test bed for microtonal solutions *specifically* for those people who can&apos;t or won&apos;t get a faster box. I would like to have at least a couple of scenarios to recommend to those folks, and Midicode will probably be one of them.</p><p>&gt;The only problem is that when I do that the sound &quot;breaks up...&quot;</p><p>That could be the cpu, but it is most likely the audio card. See above. Older cards, with older drivers (the little software pieces that communicate between the cpu, the application, and the hardware device - in this case, the audio card) can&apos;t cut multiple streams of audio.</p><p>&gt;I take it one needs quite a fast machine to do all this softsynth stuff &gt;since the<br/>&gt;poor machine is *both* sequencing and making the sounds.</p><p>*Bingo*. Sorry, but that is true.</p><p>&gt;So, again, what is an *optimal* speed for softsynth stuff??</p><p>The fastest, biggest you can afford.</p><p>&gt;I guess the newest computers are running from 2-3 GIGAhz.</p><p>My current system has a 2.53 cpu. I&apos;d probably call that around the minimum, but it is almost exactly what I was looking for, as described in the price-break above, to build a new system. I just happened to luckily find someone on eBay selling a system that was virtually *identical* to the individual components I had been shopping for. Saved me a lot of time and a few dollars as well. I am shopping to increase ram from 512mb to 1Gig, but I&apos;m watching ram prices to see a good time to get it.</p><p>Lastly: I hope you and others on the list will let me (and others) know if we get too far into tech-talk. I don&apos;t want people leaving or falling asleep because it has all veered too far from music; that would be no different than endlessly posting tuning tables or something. I think some of this is necessary to get over the hurdle of making our kind of music in a new way, but I really do want feedback if I or anyone else is just simply getting in too deep!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5399 href="#5399">ðŸ”—</a>Rick Taylor &#x3C;ricktaylor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2003 5:51:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Jonathan M.

Actually, at the moment I&apos;m pretty happy with my<br/>ideosyncratic working methods.  For example, for the current woodwind<br/>quintet in Blackjack I use the *sequencer* to actually compose the<br/>piece and then &quot;translate&quot; it manually to written 72-tET notation<br/>(since, of course, the actual *playing* note names on my piano roll<br/>keyboard are *not* the same as the &quot;real&quot; notated note names -- that<br/>would be impossible since, in Blackjack, there are 21-notes per<br/>octave, of course...)</p><p>After that, I use Sibelius to engrave the work.

Then if it doesn&apos;t<br/>work I suppose you just uninstall it and re-install<br/>your sound card&apos;s standard drivers.</p><p>Maybe there are asio drivers etc for other sound cards too.<br/>Anyway just suggesting this in case anyone maybe hasn&apos;t<br/>come across this link yet and finds it useful.</p><p>Unfortunately I can&apos;t install it on my current setup<br/>as it is, though, so unable to test it. Would be a dramatic<br/>reduction in latency if it worked to maybe 10 ms for the FM7.<br/>A reason to upgrade something or other at some point<br/>here too, though it is only for my composing, works<br/>fine enough for program debugging as it is which is<br/>my main focus at present really.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=5433 href="#5433">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2003 2:45:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_5392.html#5410">/makemicromusic/topicId_5392.html#5410</a></p><p>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Caveat: I can&apos;t speak from my own experience, but I gather that<br/>installing<br/>&gt; Asio drivers can make quite a difference with the soft synths on<br/>&gt; older computers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can get a special Sound Blaster compatible installer for<br/>musicians for anyone who has<br/>&gt; the SB Live, or Audigy etc (but not Extigy) from:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://kxproject.lugosoft.com/index.php?skip=1">http://kxproject.lugosoft.com/index.php?skip=1</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - its free.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks, for the info., Robert!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
