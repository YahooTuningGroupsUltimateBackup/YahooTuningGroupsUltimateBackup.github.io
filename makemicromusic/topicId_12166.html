For instance, appreciaters<br/>of<br/>&gt; pop music insist that good music must have a groove, whereas a<br/>&gt; theorist like Adorno damns the groove as a function of the<br/>&gt; mind-anaesthizing capitalist machine.  More to the point, lots of<br/>&gt; people (mostly musicians!) would dismiss microtonal music as<br/>&gt; &quot;out-of-tune&quot; rather than let their perception of &quot;in-tuneness&quot; be<br/>&gt; questioned or altered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, even if a certain music has qualities that should make it<br/>valuable<br/>&gt; and appreciable by others, it may not be if it falls outside of<br/>&gt; others&apos; fundamentalist frameworks.  My opinion, then, is that if<br/>&gt; nobody likes your music, and you do, you&apos;re just going to have to<br/>&gt; spend the rest of your life convincing a few people that their<br/>&gt; perceptual framework needs some adjusting. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (All that is predicated on the assumption that good music has<br/>&gt; intrinsic value, even if no one appreciates it.  The other<br/>&gt; alternative, that value is imposed by the observer, is not<br/>something<br/>&gt; that I&apos;m confortable with.  I think the above is relevant to the<br/>list,<br/>&gt; but I&apos;ll stop here...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -chris<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cmbryan.com">www.cmbryan.com</a><br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=12389 href="#12389">ðŸ”—</a>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2006 6:01:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot;<br/>&lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, c.m.bryan &lt;chrismbryan@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;     Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I have no idea where or when I heard this but it goes<br/>&gt;   something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   It was noticed that old (very old) couples when they were<br/>&gt;   in a dance hall, ( or just a place they had some room to<br/>&gt;   dance ) and there was the music playing that they danced<br/>&gt;   to when they were teenagers, perked up.
