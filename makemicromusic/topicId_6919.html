There&apos;s a huge amount of work on<br/>Csound, but it seems the emphasis is on making strange and exotic<br/>sounds. I&apos;m not interested in exotic; I want musicality. There is a<br/>book out on Csound recipes for woodwinds, but I have never heard the<br/>results and don&apos;t know if it would be worth it. I don&apos;t think much of<br/>the waveguide instruments built into Csound, nor of FM synthesis, and<br/>additive synthesis of sine waves is OK, but limited.

I&apos;m simply pointing &gt;out there is interest in any exceptions.</p><p>I see (sorry about the &apos;confusion&apos; - it isn&apos;t rare that people get things a bit mixed in a new environment). There *may* be exceptions, which we should be on the lookout for. But virtually all the development in these soft instruments cater to people who make music either in realtime or in a sequencing environment. Stand-alone rendering engines are not going to pop up often.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d be interested if anyone has anything to report on using this method to &gt;create microtonal music.</p><p>It is pretty much all I&apos;ve used for the last year or so. If all you are doing is ending up with a midi file out of Scala, you could do this with all the big/common DAWs. And, if you are doing as has been done so much - having Scala spit a single musical line onto multiple midi channels and using pitch bend to create a tuning - you will *have* to render/export, because with multiple instances of a softsynth/sampler you&apos;ll quickly tax the cpu. For similar reasons Csound is not (essentially) a realtime environment.</p><p>&gt;Surely I can&apos;t be the only one currently employing the Scala to midi to &gt;rendered wav file method. I know a number of us are now using Scala, since &gt;I&apos;ve looked at some of the midi files people provide.</p><p>I think most everyone else is a little more hands on in the creating of the sequence itself, before passing it to Scala. And an awful lot of these seem to end up simply as GM midi files (like Herman Miller&apos;s). It&apos;s only an opinion, but I find this method very unfulfilling, and not a good representation of the music that should be there.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s a huge amount of work on Csound, but it seems the emphasis is on &gt;making strange and exotic sounds. I&apos;m not interested in exotic; I want &gt;musicality.</p><p>They aren&apos;t mutually exclusive, but I don&apos;t think you meant it that way anyhow. But the musicality of the end sound source is only part of the issue, because I&apos;ve heard people make the best, most well-crafted samples sound like a Speak-and-Spell toy. The musicality comes before the rendering as well.</p><p>&gt;Maybe I&apos;m just cranky.</p><p>If you say so, but you are demanding as well, and there is nothing wrong with that when you are applying it to your music! The demands I place on my own work is similar to what George Secor recently remarked: I have a hard time being satisfied with my results, and end up fussing and tweaking, over and over.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6929 href="#6929">ðŸ”—</a>Philip &#x3C;philippe.gruchet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2004 3:35:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jonathan,<br/>&gt; &gt;FreeAlpha is always available as freeware,<br/>&gt; &gt;but without microtuning support.<br/>&gt; &gt;The only way to test the microtuning feature of Alpha2<br/>&gt; &gt;is to pay for!?!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LinPlug has always had demos of current software -<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll check it out, but if there isn&apos;t a current Alpha2 demo<br/>&gt; with tuning I&apos;ll drop Peter a line.

There are most definitely circumstances where the sound architecture of an instrument will be of interest and importance to a composer/performer (as in additive vs subtactive), but there is nothing to stop you from deciding what the sonic qualities are like, and how they may or may not fit in with your music making.</p><p>For instance, I recently put FreeAlpha up on my computer for two reasons: to see if it had a small memory footprint for possible use in guide tracks, and to just hear how it sounds. And it didn&apos;t take long for me to find that I wouldn&apos;t have any use for the instrument itself, even if it was tuneable. That is simply my taste, not necessarily anyone else&apos;s. On the other hand, there is a softsynth from a small developer that I like Very Much, and I&apos;m going to approach him privately to see if he could add tuning to it.</p><p>(Phi, could you email me off list regarding the code resources you&apos;ve come up with, as this is a SynthEdit instrument and he might be able to add it easily)</p><p>So, I&apos;ve gone through pretty much all the soft instruments that offer microtuning, and only some of them match up with the sounds I want to hear. Naturally, there are a couple that don&apos;t tune but I&apos;d love them too!</p><p>Bottom line: it isn&apos;t just the tuning that makes the music, and everyone needs to evaluate the musicality, the nuances, the programming interface, and many other aspects of an instrument. It can certainly be figured out if you are going to like an instrument even from a 12tet version.</p><p>At least I *think* so.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6946 href="#6946">ðŸ”—</a>Philip &#x3C;philippe.gruchet@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2004 10:28:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jonathan,<br/>&gt; Hi Phi, (been wanting to do that for a while...)</p><p>I got your post.
