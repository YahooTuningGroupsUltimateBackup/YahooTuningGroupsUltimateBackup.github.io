The FR-7/-5 are the first<br/>instruments of their type to successfully integrate powerful<br/>Physical Behavior Modeling (PBM) technology into a traditional<br/>accordion design, combining the familiar sounds and nuances of a<br/>traditional accordion with the versatility of a modern digital<br/>musical instrument. You can instantly select and switch between a<br/>wide range of sounds and/or types of accordions, or customize your<br/>own unique timbres. Because it doesn&apos;t depend on moving parts for<br/>sound generation, the V-Accordion is always in tune, and both<br/>keyboards can be transposed to play across a wide range of octaves.<br/>For sound output, the V-Accordions can plug directly into a sound<br/>system, recording device, or plug in a pair of headphones for silent<br/>practice.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s sound engine:<br/>&quot;Physical Behavior Modeling uses complex algorithms (as opposed to<br/>sampled sounds) to accurately model an acoustic accordion&apos;s sound<br/>characteristics. The result is an engine that faithfully recreates<br/>the actual physical behavior and expressive nuances of an acoustic<br/>instrument.&quot;</p><p>The same issue includes a feature on Kobayashi &quot;Coba&quot; Yasuhiro,<br/>apparently a champion accordionist from Japan who has played on<br/>Bjork&apos;s &quot;Homogenic&quot; CD amongst other things.

Our editor in chief<br/>Ernie Rideout used to play squeezebox in a klezmer band.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s sound engine:<br/>&gt;&quot;Physical Behavior Modeling uses complex algorithms (as opposed to<br/>&gt;sampled sounds) to accurately model an acoustic accordion&apos;s sound<br/>&gt;characteristics. The result is an engine that faithfully recreates<br/>&gt;the actual physical behavior and expressive nuances of an acoustic<br/>&gt;instrument.&quot;</p><p>This is incorrect.  It&apos;s still a sampler, but with modeled effects<br/>on top.</p><p>&gt;Unfortunately, I can&apos;t tell from the info provided whether this<br/>&gt;device has any support for microtonality, though I&apos;d hope the the<br/>&gt;free bass keys could be individually programmed for MIDI pitch<br/>&gt;values.</p><p>It does, in fact, have the 12-tone tuning implementation typical<br/>of Roland instruments.  It has about 3 built-in scales and 1 or 2<br/>user scales... or does it even have user scales?... I forget.  At<br/>any rate, I filled the halls of the MusicPlayer group with<br/>quartertone accordion one day.  But it ain&apos;t anything unusually<br/>useful to the microtonalist.</p><p>&gt;In any case, I&apos;m quite ignorant about all things accordion-esque,<br/>&gt;so don&apos;t ask me more about this.</p><p>Ernie had two top-notch local (Bay Area) accordionists come in<br/>and try it out.  He recorded their observations, as well as<br/>MIDI of their playing.  I sat in on one of the interviews.  The<br/>bottom line is that for the price, you could have a very nice<br/>real accordion, like a used Petosa.  $5K is right around where<br/>you start to get into custom instruments, where any tuning (though<br/>fixed) could presumably be obtained if you spoke enough Italian.</p><p>Further, most accordions at this level have several sets of reeds<br/>to enable &apos;stops&apos;, like on an organ.  They could instead be tuned<br/>to, say, different roots.  One could have multi-key JI, for<br/>example, at the push of a button (which real players can already<br/>switch in the mid-piece with as much virtuosity as they use on the<br/>rest of the instrument).</p><p>Anyway, interviewee #1 reported that the keyboard is crap -- slow,<br/>too much key travel.  Like a student-model Hohner.  It is also<br/>velocity sensitive -- something no real accordion is -- but this<br/>can be switched off.</p><p>The thing is also heavier than a real accordion of comparable<br/>physical size.</p><p>The bellows were unusually tight on our test model, and not as<br/>responsive as interviewee #1 expected.</p><p>It does sound like the real thing.  Nobody could hear the difference<br/>for single notes -- it&apos;s got a killer built-in speaker system.  But<br/>for phrases, the lack of responsiveness of the bellows could apparently<br/>be heard.</p><p>Basically, wait for version 2.0.  Or better yet, get a real reed<br/>box.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
