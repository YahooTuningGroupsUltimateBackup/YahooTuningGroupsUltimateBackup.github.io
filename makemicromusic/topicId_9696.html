I have a question for you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have started using just intonation and microtones recently and<br/>&gt; playing a fretless guitar.</p><p>And welcome to our world. I do fretless bass myself.</p><p>&gt; I feel the need to change my vocabulary for describing music to<br/>&gt; myself. At the moment, I&apos;m trying to find notes mainly by ear<br/>&gt; rather<br/>&gt; than from theory. From a &grave;tonic&apos; note I get around 20<br/>&gt; distinct<br/>&gt; intervals.</p><p>What are those twenty intervals? I didn&apos;t even start with just intonation; the first tuning I used was 19-tone equal temperament. In JI or near-JI, I probably use up to 41 pitches in practice (and winging it with 53- or 72-equal).</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t seem to make sense any more to use terms like<br/>&gt; &grave;7th&apos;<br/>&gt; or &grave;2nd&apos; as they describe the function within a system of<br/>&gt; harmony<br/>&gt; that I&apos;m not using, and frame the way I think of using the note.</p><p>Well you can&apos;t vaguely call anything a &quot;major second&quot; or &quot;minor seventh&quot; anymore, since a major second can be either 9/8, 10/9 or even 8/7. So I think of things being one or two commas up or down, or &quot;small&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;grave&quot; or &quot;acute&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Improvising is ok as you just work with the sound itself, but when<br/>&gt; composing or figuring things out I do feel the need for a way to<br/>&gt; think about how notes are related in abstract terms.</p><p>In a song I&apos;m writing right now, I came up with this chord: G# B D F C (G#o7b11). No problem in 12-tone or any meantone, but I&apos;m contemplating how that should be tuned in JI. In 5-limit, a diminished seventh with all-equal minor thirds would be [1/1 6/5 36/25 216/125], but you might prefer [1/1 6/5 64/45 128/75] instead. Or in 7-limit, [1/1 6/5 10/7 12/7].</p><p>Anyway, I think the best advice for a beginner is to draw a lattice first in 5-limit, then move on to 7, then 11 if you want. See how everything is related to each other. I was told the same thing by some of the veterans.</p><p>(And familiarize yourself with Scala, if you can run it on your computer.

At the very<br/>least, you may end up with some memorable song that, indeed,<br/>helps you remember what you&apos;ve discovered.</p><p>I&apos;ve spent some time playing with a fretless Chinese instrument<br/>before this, and love how you can always invent the right note<br/>to fit the mood of the music.  But I&apos;ve not spent enough time<br/>with it to start to systematise it, nor have I recorded any of<br/>the improvisations.</p><p>In my youth, I tried to notate some &quot;wordless songs&quot; that I<br/>improvised, very fluid and melismatic, with lots of bends and<br/>glides and no pitch very definite except the tonic.  The best I<br/>could do was to make a rough graph of pitch against time -<br/>rather like a piano roll with lots of notes falling between the<br/>keys.  Went to read them back several months later, and found<br/>that the graphs were indeed very rough - too rough to be very<br/>useful.  Obviously, I would have been better off with a tape<br/>recorder!</p><p>But I wonder - unless you&apos;re actually going to _use_ those<br/>names systematically, say to create a theory of melody or<br/>harmony, or to tell some other musician what pitch or interval<br/>to play - are you any better off with names (or notation)?<br/>Do you, in fact, _need_ to &quot;talk to yourself&quot;?  Or might you<br/>make better music, explore more freely, without such a<br/>system of names?

It also came<br/>without a bow.  Still, it&apos;s possible to make music out of anything,<br/>even tin cans!</p><p>It rather resembles a p&apos;i-p&apos;a (old style, Wade romanisation)<br/>or pi-pa (modern, or Pinyin romanisation), the Chinese lute,<br/>because of its flat, shallow resonator and flat fingerboard.<br/>However, the pi-pa has very thin steel frets set in high mounts<br/>or bridges of ivory (or a plastic substitute).  On the pi-pa, you<br/>have to hear the bends to believe them! :-)  You can bend the<br/>string (thin steel wire) very rapidly, making for some<br/>excellent and idiosyncratic ornamentation.  With practice,<br/>you can also play an alternate tuning on the pi-pa without any<br/>noticeable glide or pitch bend, but not at great speed.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.11.8 - Release Date: 10/5/05</p></div>
