Kind<br/>of<br/>&gt; surprised me too, in that this has neutral thirds!</p><p>Jacky, I have an excellent ear, am intimately familiar with the<br/>Mohajira scale you&apos;re referring to, and I&apos;m absolutely certain there<br/>were no neutral thirds in the beginning section of that piece. You<br/>must have done something wrong (not musically speaking of course,<br/>just in terms of implementing the tuning).</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2001 7:40:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky,</p><p>Paul and I are honored to have such a beautiful piece of music<br/>dedicated to us, no matter what tuning it is in.
