My CSound orchestra is extremely simple -<br/>just one instrument that plays in 53-equal. With these two inputs,<br/>CSound spits out a .wav file.</p><p>My approach to generating the note sequence is based on statistical<br/>mechanics. It&apos;s pretty easy to set up a simulation of a system with a<br/>phase transition - the classical simplest model is called an Ising<br/>model, from the 1920&apos;s I think.</p><p>So I build a big matrix of all the possible notes that could be<br/>played. I then have a cost function that wants notes close in time to<br/>be close in pitch. The fun part is in defining what it means to be<br/>close in time and what it means to be close in pitch! Of course I<br/>define perfect fifths, major thirds, etc. to be close in pitch. Close<br/>in time has a similar folded structure - I am putting a toroidal<br/>structure on time to force a roughly repetitive note sequence.</p><p>Then there&apos;s an &quot;annealing schedule&quot; on top of all this. The program<br/>randomly teaks the note sequence and checks if the cost goes up or<br/>down as a result. In the beginning the choice is made quite randomly.<br/>Then gradually the weighting is changed so that moves are preferred<br/>that decrease the cost.</p><p>It&apos;s well known (in theoretical physics) that a system like this will<br/>exhibit fractal fluctuations in the vicinity of its phase transition.<br/>So I stop the annealing when I see the signs of the phase transition.</p><p>I haven&apos;t coded the thing very efficiently. It&apos;s several hours of cpu<br/>time to sift down to the sequence in this file.</p><p>That&apos;s probably more than you wanted to know! Is this anything at all<br/>like what you&apos;re experimenting with, JayTee?</p><p>Jim</p></div><h3>Chris Bryan &#x3C;melandchris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2005 7:19:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey, I just wanted to say that it was pretty cool.
