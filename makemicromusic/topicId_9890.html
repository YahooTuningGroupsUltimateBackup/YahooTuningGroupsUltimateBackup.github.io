You know, one of the things that has become clear to me over time is that, while we know Kraig as an adventurous and evocative composer, he has some prodigious performance talents as well! Kraig, I may like &quot;Haiti&quot;, but I am still getting a lot of listening pleasure from the recent mini-CD of yours, &quot;Without R &amp; R&quot;. A complete experience in just a few minutes.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
