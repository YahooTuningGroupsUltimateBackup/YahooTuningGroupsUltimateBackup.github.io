But I stuck to my guns, despite<br/>&gt; his filling up my inbox with fake obituaries &apos;Serious gentle-tempered<br/>&gt; violinist killed by meanness blah blah blah...&apos; So I&apos;m playing<br/>&gt; harpsichord with him in a concert on HIS turf Nov. 30, I assumed I<br/>&gt; would tune to his liking that time. But he sentme the flyer and it<br/>&gt; made a selling point about Ms Conrad and her MEAN TEMPERED<br/>&gt; HARPSICHORD. Apparently he took a liking to it!</p><p>That sounds great. Quarter comma meantone is a sympathetic<br/>tuning for an accompanist to use, nice to play with and so<br/>I&apos;m sure musicians will get won over to it with time :-).</p><p>It is after all what everyone used at the time too, with good<br/>reason.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
