Recently, prompted by Jacky&apos;s post about the tuning capability<br/>of the VAZ synth line, I bought VAZ 2001 (by the way the product has now<br/>been morphed into VAZ 2010 for some reason).</p><p>So I was diddling around with VAZ 2010 this evening and made a couple of<br/>voices &amp; modified a few that came with it. It does come with a pretty nice<br/>pipe organ sound... I whipped out a little 5-part organ blurb (in half an<br/>hour, so caveat emptor, eh; and hold the comments on counterpoint). It&apos;s in<br/>the Ganassi tuning.</p><p>Here it is -- 30 seconds, 500k:<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/GanassiTest1.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/GanassiTest1.mp3</a></p><p>This was produced only with VAZ2010 and nothing else. I scored/sequenced<br/>it with Finale and sent the output to VAZ via Midi Yoke, and captured it to<br/>a WAV file. Converted to MP3 with CoolEdit...</p><p>The tuning is explained here, by Monz:<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ganassi/ganassi.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ganassi/ganassi.htm</a></p><p>Anyone know how to get better control of velocity/volume on these analog<br/>type synth emulators???</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=3075 href="#3075">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

I&apos;ll try and find the link that I posted once for Joe Pehrson: it was an article by composer James Newton Howard in Kbd mag that had a fairly lengthy treatment on how to massage the midi data to make the instruments more expressive.</p><p>Off to download...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3076 href="#3076">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

It has good support for continous MIDI data and<br/>velocity, volume, controllers, start/stop time, etc. I used some of that in<br/>this piece.</p><p>I had said:</p><p>&gt; Anyone know how to get better control of velocity/volume on these<br/>&gt; analog type synth emulators???</p><p>The problem I was referring to in this piece is that, being new to this<br/>analog-synth, I don&apos;t know how to get the VAZ to have velocity sensitivity<br/>in the patch. On the TX802 (FM), which I&apos;ve used extensively, you just set<br/>the amplitude mod sensitivity high, and then you get decent volume control<br/>via MIDI velocity (and you can get timbral control also). It doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to work that way in VAZ. There&apos;s no &quot;velocity sensitivity&quot; control knob.<br/>Maybe someone who&apos;s worked with this synth knows the answer...</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks for the pointer to the article in Keyboard mag.

And thanks for your little &apos;piece-let&apos;. Sounds like vintage McGowan, esp. since I somehow expected *only* the pipe organ timbres, and then you pop in those &apos;other&apos; voices. I&apos;m going to go read about the Ganassi thing on Joe&apos;s site, but to tell the truth, you didn&apos;t really have to apologize for the counterpoint: esp. for the short work-up time, it was pretty convincing!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=3081 href="#3081">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2002 9:16:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky asked...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Here it is -- 30 seconds, 500k:<br/>&gt; &gt; &#x9;<a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/GanassiTest1.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/GanassiTest1.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like it.
