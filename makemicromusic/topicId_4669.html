Luckily some program or other<br/>does a reset.  Lucky because, the keyboard reset method didn&apos;t work.</p><p>I am willing to buy integrated software. Is there one product that is<br/>well documented, covers or links to notational software (I have<br/>Allegro 2001 and have considered getting Finale) and gives a good<br/>selection of tools for MMM.  Finale is supposed to support 1/4 tone<br/>notation.  But can they be microtuned to sound right?  Finale also<br/>is said too suppport sysex commands, but can they really be in<br/>hexadecimal?</p><p>  I&apos;m tempted to use my keyboard as an input device only; I would<br/>like to hear keyboard notes on my computer&apos;s speakers.  I hope to<br/>somehow feed into my home stereo.  If I cann&apos;t go from speaker out to<br/>audio in, I have a headphone out to a tape cassette emulator.</p><p>Any ideas or am I doomed to 12 tet for life?? I had  hoped to do hard<br/>stuff like putting my own order to Arabic notation (which is not an<br/>exact science).  At present I mightt settle for 12 just intonation.</p><p>Jim Nagy</p></div>
