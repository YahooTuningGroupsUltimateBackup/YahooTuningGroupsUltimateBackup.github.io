So I&apos;ll try to briefly<br/>comment on various threads of the last week or so.</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson - enjoyed your music for Clash By Night.<br/>Listening to this prompted me to roll out your other music I<br/>heard over the last year or so.  I still like it all!  If I had  to<br/>pick a favourite, it would be the Madwoman variations, but it&apos;s<br/>a close contest.</p><p>Margo, what can I say but it&apos;s always a pleasure to hear your<br/>music - and almost always a surprise, too.  Others have commented<br/>on the timbres (your eloCello, I think?), and I&apos;ll just say I enjoyed<br/>it.</p><p>On experimenting vs maths vs psychoacoustic: there is no contest!<br/>Different people arrive at the same place following different<br/>routes, and using different means of transport.  If, in the end, we<br/>are all transported by the music, does it matter how we arrived?</p><p>Dan Stearns, I always listen to your new stuff and always find it<br/>a challenge.  Thank you!</p><p>And as for Johnny Reinhard&apos;s concert, I&apos;m waiting for the video<br/>to incorporate the hifi sound, so I don&apos;t spoil the experience. ;-)</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to do an extended work soon, using natural sound<br/>samples.  To get what I&apos;m after will require a fair bit of research<br/>to accumulate, and then usefully classify, a bank of relevant<br/>samples, so it may be some time before &quot;music&quot; results.  I guess<br/>that most natural sounds could be classified as both microtonal<br/>and richly-timbred, so I&apos;m going to have to be very selective in<br/>regards to timbre.  The results will definitely NOT be &quot;musique<br/>concr&iuml;&iquest;&half;te&quot; ... ;-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.392 / Virus Database: 268.6.0/341 - Release Date: 16/5/06</p></div>
