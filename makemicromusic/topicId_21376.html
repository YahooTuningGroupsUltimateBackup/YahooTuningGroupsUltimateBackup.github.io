It&apos;s full of very knowledgeable and inspired<br/>people who are passionate and willing to share their ideas and talk<br/>about this stuff for hours.</p><p>So it would suck if this argument ends the usual way, which is that<br/>everyone decides to leave the lists. Being as we&apos;ve seen this happen<br/>like three times in the last year alone, how many active members will<br/>we be left with? Just me and Marcel?</p><p>All of you have valid reasons to be upset and I can certainly see<br/>everyone&apos;s point of view here. That being said, I hope everyone can<br/>resolve their differences, because I don&apos;t think these lists will<br/>survive another mass exodus. And if that happens, I&apos;ll probably have<br/>to take up another avant garde hobby, like home improvement or<br/>knitting or something. So let&apos;s keep the lid on, yes?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
