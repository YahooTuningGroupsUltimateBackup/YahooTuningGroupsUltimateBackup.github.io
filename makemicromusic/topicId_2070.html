I tend to resolve to<br/>the neutral thirds instead.</p><p>However you can get quite astonishingly convincing cadences<br/>in 7-tet using movement up and down by neutral thirds in the<br/>place of fifths. Kind of classical feel to it.</p><p>I do that in my 7 equal trio in one of the movements, but<br/>here is a better example (attached)</p><p>Also includes example of a 7-tet fourth used as a slight<br/>dissonance (sort of like a dominant seventh)<br/>rather than a point of relative rest. All diads.</p><p>Also thought I&apos;d have a go at the spheres. Calling the three diads<br/>spheres as well gives us seven 7-tet spheres. I may have a go at<br/>writing pieces in them some time, but meanwhile here is a rough<br/>attempt so that one can hear what they sound like. Playing is quite<br/>slow as at present, I have to think about what one can and can&apos;t<br/>play in each sphere!</p><p>Attached - 7-tet cadences, and seven 7-tet spheres.</p><p>I think this is going to be a pretty useful technique actually<br/>for learning n-tets for small n.</p><p>I feel already that they are distinct sound worlds</p><p>Sphere 5 is the diad with the 11/9 and sphere 7 is the one<br/>with the flat fifth / sharp fourth, with lots of beating.</p><p>Robert</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
