I definitely enjoyed the lo-fi; it&apos;s an<br/>effect I often use myself, though rarely as successfully as your use<br/>here.  That sound, combined with your extreme high-speed rhythmical<br/>precision/&quot;arpeggiator-gone-haywire&quot; phrasing, had me wondering if<br/>that lead instrument was in fact a guitar!  Very cool.  I&apos;m quite<br/>curious as to how you approach the 20-edo guitar from a compositional<br/>standpoint.  Do you base your playing around specific modes/quasi-<br/>tonal ideas, or do you just let go and have at it?  A lot of it<br/>sounded very free-form, but then again my natural interpretation of<br/>complex solo passages is to assume that they were improvised (unless<br/>I know differently).</p><p>I&apos;d also like to throw my two cents into the aesthetics debate, since<br/>this is something I spend a lot of time thinking about.  I whole-<br/>heartedly agree with you that there should be no rules except what<br/>sounds good to the composer.  The concept of repetition has taken on<br/>new meanings these days, and I&apos;ve certainly found that cohesiveness<br/>is very possible without specifically repeating any phrases.  Also,<br/>where is the line drawn between a &quot;variation on a theme&quot; and a<br/>completely new idea?  It seems sometimes that completely and<br/>simultaneously changing a phrase&apos;s key, mode, tempo, and meter is not<br/>enough to avoid the feeling of repetition, and other times changing<br/>but a single note can lead to the feel of a completely new idea.<br/>Sometimes a simple re-occurring unique timbre can be enough to bring<br/>cohesiveness to a piece.  And yet sometimes even extreme repetition<br/>does not bring a feeling of cohesiveness; if the listener cannot<br/>discern one part from another, how can s/he tell when a part is<br/>repeated?   I often find this true of both exceedingly simple ambient<br/>music and extremely technical metal, as well as many genres in<br/>between.  It all comes down to two things: where the music wants to<br/>take you, and whether or not you want to be taken there.
