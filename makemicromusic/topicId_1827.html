Never have known of it, but it seems that<br/>&gt; Graham likes some &quot;less than 12 tunings as well&quot;! Neutral thirds are<br/>&gt; sweet - not surprising that he finds this a favorite.</p><p>I did mention when I found them on the main list.  Perhaps you were away<br/>then.  So &quot;less than 12&quot; simply means a scale with less than 12 notes?<br/>I&apos;ve been mostly been interested in scales with around 7 notes to<br/>something like an octave, and temperaments with an open number of notes.<br/>Since the miracle rediscovery, I&apos;ve been mostly working with that, and I<br/>haven&apos;t found any 7-ish subsets I&apos;m really happy with.  Contrapuntal ideas<br/>seem to work if you think of 10 nominally equal, fuzzily tuned notes to<br/>the octave, and use miracle to remove the fuzziness.</p><p>Neutral third scales are linked to miracle.  They both involve a 10 note<br/>MOS and 31-equal.  You can think of miracle as three interlocked neutral<br/>third chains.</p><p>The original reason I started looking at neutral third scales was because<br/>I wanted tetrachordal scales with only 2 step sizes that weren&apos;t based on<br/>5-limit triads.  Equally divided fifths were a good way of making that<br/>work.  It also means using 7 as 4+3 instead of 5+2, which is another idea<br/>I&apos;d been thinking of.  The 11-limit approximation started as a bonus, but<br/>it&apos;s what drew me into 11-limit harmony.</p><p>The MOS also fulfils a lot of Paul&apos;s criteria for being a generalised<br/>diatonic, if you define neutral triads as primary consonances and the rest<br/>of the 11-limit as the next consonance limit up.</p><p>So, Jacky, what tuning are you actually using?  I missed it in all the<br/>bustle, and I find the Yahoo! interface obnoxious these days.  Doesn&apos;t it<br/>involve a stretched octave?</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1895 href="#1895">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2002 9:15:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been mostly been interested in scales with around 7 notes to<br/>&gt; something like an octave, and temperaments with an open number of notes.<br/>&gt; Since the miracle rediscovery, I&apos;ve been mostly working with that, and I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t found any 7-ish subsets I&apos;m really happy with.</p><p>Did you try the 7 and 8 note scales I posted?

It seems to actually work.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how that became *your* proposal, because that&apos;s how I&apos;ve been<br/>using them all along.  The consonances in 31 or 24 aren&apos;t as compelling as<br/>those in a more optimal miracle.  I haven&apos;t tried 55 yet.  But a system in<br/>which neutral triads are consonances and the characteristic dissonances<br/>approximate 6:5 and 11:8 does remain promising.</p><p>The 11:8 approximation is common to all scales with a 3:2 fifth and 11:9<br/>neutral third, the 6:5 approximation only to the meantone-like ones.  With<br/>the rast-like scales, 6:5 and 5:4 become consonances, and the 5-limit<br/>chords will tend to dominate.  I think that leaves 11:8 as the only<br/>characteristic dissonance.  Oh, and 16:11, of course.</p><p>The seconds are more problematic because they&apos;re small, complex and not<br/>well tuned in 31-equal.  But even without the SSSes, you can get<br/>8:9:10:11:12 from them.</p><p>I looked at a chord make up of 11:8, 6:5 and 11:8 in relation to Margo&apos;s<br/>neo-Gothic ideas.  Taking this mohajira:</p><p>C  D  Ev F  G  Av Bv C<br/>  T  t  t  T  t  T  t</p><p>It&apos;d be Av-D-F-Bv.  F-Av and Bv-D are regular neutral thirds and Av-Bv<br/>could be either 9:8 or 10:9.  It contains all the characteristic<br/>dissonances, and so uniquely defines the scale.  If you resolve to C-Ev-G<br/>you&apos;re using all the notes of the scale, and strongly marking it as a<br/>tonic.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1902 href="#1902">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>1/24/2002 5:57:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;a2ns2j+35is@...&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L<br/>&gt; When you say &quot;something like an octave&quot; I get all goosepimply!</p><p>Well, partly I mean that scales I define as &quot;octave equivalent&quot; needn&apos;t<br/>have the octave tuned to 2:1, although that is how I&apos;ve tuned them so far.<br/> But also that I&apos;ve looked at the Bohlen-Pierce and O&apos;Connell scales where<br/>the equivalence interval isn&apos;t an octave, but works the same way.</p><p>&gt; GB:<br/>&gt; &gt; Since the miracle rediscovery, I&apos;ve been mostly working with that,<br/>&gt; and I haven&apos;t found any 7-ish subsets I&apos;m really happy with.<br/>&gt; Contrapuntal ideas seem to work if you think of 10 nominally equal,<br/>&gt; fuzzily tuned notes to the octave, and use miracle to remove the<br/>&gt; fuzziness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have to take your word on this, because I&apos;m not sure what you<br/>&gt; mean by &quot;fuzzy&quot; exactly. I do enjoy the sound of having a stretched<br/>&gt; or compressed octave in these varieties though. I also enjoy complex<br/>&gt; intervals as well. I do realize what the invervallic attributes of 72<br/>&gt; are.</p><p>You can think of traditional tonal or contrapuntal music as using 7 notes<br/>to the octave, with key signatures and accidentals to specify how those 7<br/>notes should be tuned.  I&apos;m doing the same kind of thing with 10 notes,<br/>but so far no sense of mode or tonality, so it&apos;s all accidentals.  That&apos;s<br/>a very different approach to taking 7 specific notes and signalling<br/>deviations, which is another way of looking at the tradition I mentioned<br/>before.  I don&apos;t specifically tune to 72-equal, but all miracle tunings<br/>have similar properties to subsets of 72.</p><p>&gt; GB:<br/>&gt; &gt; Neutral third scales are linked to miracle.  They both involve a 10<br/>&gt; note MOS and 31-equal.  You can think of miracle as three interlocked<br/>&gt; neutral third chains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Seems there are many ETs besides 72 which have some worthy Neu-3rd<br/>&gt; structures too (not to mention other generator sizes which give<br/>&gt; scales with &quot;less than 12&quot; tones). My interest is predominantly in<br/>&gt; Rational MOS though, and here they mostly have stretched or<br/>&gt; compressed octaves.</p><p>72-equal as a neutral third scale simplifies down to 24.  I was thinking<br/>31 and 41 is the miracle/neutral third unification.  I haven&apos;t looked at<br/>tempered octaves yet, because I can only take so many revolutions per<br/>calendar year.</p><p>&gt; GB:<br/>&gt; &gt; The MOS also fulfils a lot of Paul&apos;s criteria for being a<br/>&gt; generalised diatonic, if you define neutral triads as primary<br/>&gt; consonances and the rest of the 11-limit as the next consonance limit<br/>&gt; up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; When you say &quot;the MOS&quot; do you mean &quot;MOS&quot; in general, or the Neu-3rd<br/>&gt; type MOS? Sorry!</p><p>The 7-note neutral third MOS, like Mohajira.</p><p>&gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_unknown.html#1840">/makemicromusic/topicId_unknown.html#1840</a></p><p>Ah, right, that&apos;s fairly clear about it being a neutral third MOS.  And I<br/>only had to navigate two obtrusive adverts to get to it!</p><p>So 27:22 is the complement of 11:9 with 3:2.  And the equivalence interval<br/>is this 59049:29282?  Ah, and all the steps are 9:8 or 12:11.</p><p>&gt; This is one of many of its ilk. If interested, I&apos;m going to be<br/>&gt; showing another here soon of this variety.</p><p>Have you looked at 60:49 and 49:40 as neutral thirds?</p><p>&gt; Very interesting to find that we share some common fascination with<br/>&gt; these kinds of structures.</p><p>Quite a few people have bumped into them for different reasons.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
