The website is in the form<br/>of a wiki, which allows for collaborative creation of content.</p><p>If you want to contribute, obtain a wikispaces account (don&apos;t even<br/>need an email I believe) and be sure to click &quot;Join this space&quot; at<br/>some point so we&apos;ll know you&apos;re there.</p><p>What&apos;s new? I made a FAQ-like page here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Ask+Questions">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Ask+Questions</a>&gt; and I asked some<br/>questions and maybe some of you would like to ask or answer some<br/>questions. That&apos;s an invitation.</p><p>Here&apos;s an additional line of thought I just thought of today.</p><p>How does microtonal music fit into your happiness? To what degree does<br/>microtonality make you excited to be alive?</p><p>Is it so easy to turn this creative, often status-quo-challenging<br/>habit of ours into its own micro-status-quo?</p><p>I&apos;m going to assume everybody is being boring right now because they<br/>are too busy with sad-making timesucking boring jobs.  (I have one<br/>too, now! packing packages into trucks...)</p><p>I have yet to see a poem about microtonality. Do any poets care? Are<br/>too compartmentalized to be poets?</p><p>(Disclaimer: This critical line of thought is made in full<br/>appreciation of all the wonderful things that Are happening; it does<br/>not dwell on complaining but points to additions not yet made. Also,<br/>sorry if I&apos;m talking funny, it&apos;s the darn school for designing a society.)</p><p>Jacob</p></div>
