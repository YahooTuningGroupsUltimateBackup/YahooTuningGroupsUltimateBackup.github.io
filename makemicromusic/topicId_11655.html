I&apos;m hoping this will become a trend;  and I&apos;m trying to get them to let me write a more full blown article on tunings, but it&apos;s slow going. Any mainstream press is a good thing, and perhaps the guitar community will become a leader in the recognition of non 12 tunings. Go to <a href="http://unfretted.com">unfretted.com</a> for a look at a large group of fretless guitarists, most of whom are good to excellent players...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>newbiebrad &#x3C;bradley_g_smith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2006 11:26:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I hope you will succeed getting that article published. Not to veer<br/>off about fretless guitars, but I&apos;m happy Guitar Player printed its<br/>shorty article on the New York Fretless Guitar Festival and<br/><a href="http://Unfretted.com">Unfretted.com</a>&apos;s &quot;Village Of The Unfretted&quot; cd in the GP December<br/>issue... and now this how-to expository article in the February<br/>issue. Small but imortant PR steps for the fretless guitar.
