Three composers, Martin Bresnick, Frank Oteri and Dan<br/>Cooper will be present and will be interviewed by actress Linda Past.</p><p>We present Martin Bresnick&apos;s Songs of the Mouse People, based<br/>upon a surreal short story of a tiny mouse diva by Franz Kafka with<br/>Jennifer DeVore, cello and Ingrid Gordon, vibraphone.</p><p>Virgil Thomson&apos;s String Quartet No. 2 is a peaceful and &quot;laid<br/>back&quot; work that is considered by some a precursor of minimalism.<br/>It will be performed by Curtis Macomber, Lynn Bechtold, violins,<br/>Edmundo Ramirez, viola, Jennifer DeVore, cello.</p><p>The ethereal Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho, who combines the<br/>science of sound with the otherworldly will be performed with her<br/>Nocturne for solo violin rendered by Lynn Bechtold.</p><p>We will be premiering Frank Oteri&apos;s microtonal woodwind quintet,<br/>circles mostly in wood in quartertones. This is a work which spans a<br/>wild stylistic range, from pop to minimalist. This work will be<br/>played by the Pentasonic Winds.</p><p>We will premiere the very urban String Quartet by Dan Cooper, a NYC-<br/>native composer whose fixations range from Calamari to Herald Square<br/>(performers same as the Virgil Thomson quartet).</p><p>Troy Rinker, doublebass and Thea Reynolds, flute will perform two<br/>works which were originally scheduled for our fall concert. Duo by<br/>Ben Johnston and Lumiere Noir by Hayg Boyadjian. The Johnston work<br/>is an important early microtonal piece, a precursor to his<br/>explorations of just intonation. Hayg Boyadjian&apos;s piece is a<br/>romp of contrasts between the large doublebass and the darting flute.</p><p>Warm to the glow of sonic airwave explorations as the Composers<br/>Concordance takes you on a trip to the unheard in the historic and<br/>acoustically superior Washington Square United Methodist Church.</p><p>Tickets are $12, $7 students and seniors. TDF accepted. For further<br/>information phone 212-564-4899. Composers Concordance P.O. Box 20548<br/>PABT, New York, NY 10129</p></div>
