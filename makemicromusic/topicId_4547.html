I haven&apos;t looked at the websites Joel listed, but there&apos;s a ton of stuff, most of it&apos;s relatively inexpensive and /or cheap...They can also be fussy and costly if you develop the appreciation for it. I think the most inviting prospect is amplifier simulation software, Sonar comes with rudimentary ones that work, I think...for ProTools there&apos;s Line Six&apos;s Amp Farm which may not be cheap but it covers the spectrum in its way.  It&apos;s The Pod on your computer, and then some... I like to go with what attracts me if it&apos;s not a lot of money...and sometimes even when it IS... But with something as common as electric guitar these days, what could fall into your lap as a loan or a freebie could be plenty.  Don&apos;t spend ANY money if you don&apos;t have to on something that the market has been flooded with for a long time! Direct signals (as in the guitar straight into your mixer) are most often combined with some processed signal, eg an amp mic&apos;ed, with &quot;stomp-boxes&quot;, etc. preamping (tubes are hard to beat, in almost any application, because solid-state and digital distortion tend to make you to want to turn the thing off, if you didn&apos;t already.)  Those funky &apos;pedals&apos; usually don&apos;t work without some electro-acoustic intervention on the part of an amp and a microphone... I haven&apos;t checked lately, but it used to be that a $25 pawn-shop &quot;practice amp&quot; could produce the most wonderful electric guitar tone you ever heard, where the guitarist begins to pick like a violinist would know how to bow! Best of luck, and try to borrow something before you buy it, on account of it&apos;s common as dirt.  But there are some who can really find the nuance in the paper the speakers are made of, and work back from there to the actual circuitry in the amplifiers, caps and resistors and tubes and transformers... Again, this is not to discourage you by any means, just to say, &quot;Take what you can get with some degree of reverence&quot;, and you&apos;ll probably like what you hear without much cash investment, especially if you try a &apos;slide&apos;, and as you already have been doing for a while, consider what the frets don&apos;t imply, really.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson &lt;jpehrson@...&gt; wrote:I need some help concerning the electric guitar of which I have,<br/>obviously, limited knowledge.</p><p>I was astonished to find all the different kinds of sounds and kinds<br/>of &quot;distortion&quot; that are possible with this instrument.
