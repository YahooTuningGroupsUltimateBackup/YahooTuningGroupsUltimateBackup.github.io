Pehrson</p><p>Gubaidulina was born in Chistopol, in the Tatar Republic. In her youth<br/>she would spend much time praying in the fields near her home that she<br/>may one day become a composer. She studied composition and piano at the<br/>Kazan Conservatory, graduating in 1954. In Moscow she undertook further<br/>studies at the Conservatory with Nikolay Peyko until 1959, and then<br/>with Shebalin until 1963.</p><p>During her studies in Soviet Russia, her music was<br/>labeled &quot;irresponsible&quot; for its exploration of alternative tunings. She<br/>was supported, however, by Dmitri Shostakovich, who in evaluating her<br/>final examination encouraged her to continue down her &quot;mistaken path&quot;.</p></div>
