If you&apos;ve tried to play or compose music with two little<br/>toddler-age kids running/crawling around screaming, you would know what I<br/>mean.  The idea of having a two-hour block of quiet time to myself is an<br/>almost unthinkable utopia!!  The little bit of playing I do currently is<br/>usually playing around on a few scales, trivial improvising, finger<br/>exercises, etc. usually for just a few minutes before bed, maybe once a<br/>week or so.  I hope this situation will improve once the kids get slightly<br/>more independent (i.e. don&apos;t need supervision literally every second), but<br/>that could be a couple years!  ...I&apos;ve always got music ideas swirling<br/>around in my head that can&apos;t get out!  In the meantime I&apos;m always trying to<br/>learn more about how other people go about creating their music, and<br/>gaining new insight and ideas.  Hopefully this somewhat explains my lurking<br/>tendencies. &quot;</p><p>And there&apos;s my usual litany of excuses!  So... I&apos;m sure many of you are<br/>very busy people, have jobs, spouses, kids, etc.  (Although I get the idea<br/>many of you are in the wonderful position of having large blocks of time to<br/>devote to music creation.  Don&apos;t take for granted how lucky you are!)<br/>Obviously personal organization and self-discipline are major factors, and<br/>I don&apos;t claim that I always manage my time optimally.</p><p>Any thoughts?

I did exactly that for several years.  I have two.  Now<br/>they&apos;re teenagers &amp; don&apos;t want ol&apos; Dad around anyway.  When they were tiny<br/>tots, I used to discipline myself religiously to work on composition for an<br/>hour or two in the very late evening after the kiddies bedded down -- say<br/>from 9:00 or 9:30 until bedtime.  Little blocks of time like that will add up<br/>if you keep at it in a disciplined way.</p><p>No time for music?  At one point I decided that our modern commercial<br/>culture is mostly a wasteland.  I cut all TV, newspapers, magazines, and<br/>other stupid stuff that&apos;s full of trashy advertising anyway (and is only<br/>really designed to get people to consume more dreck).  If you watch any<br/>television regularly, but you also want time for music, that&apos;s my first<br/>suggestion.  Turn off the evening news, the late show, and the re-runs of<br/>Star Trek.  My motto is: &quot;if it&apos;s really important news, I&apos;ll hear about it<br/>eventually by word of mouth, just like my Great-Great-Grandparents did&quot;.<br/>They had time for the good stuff.  Now I&apos;ve backslid and I do watch a few<br/>movies &amp; read a lot when I should be composing or writing novels...</p><p>The other thing I did earlier this spring was take a lower-stress job at 3/4<br/>time instead of the more lucrative, life-blood sapping &quot;full-time-plus-plus&quot;<br/>Silicon Valley job.  ;-)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=81 href="#81">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Beyond keeping up a web site and now a list, I sometimes (like YESterday) have two rehearsals and a concert, meaning I leave in the morning and come home after 11:00 pm.

Another thing is to have your &quot;workspace&quot; set up and ready to go: this could mean pencil and score paper, a small computer/soundcard/keyboard setup, a 22tet guitar -- doesn&apos;t matter. What you need to be able to do is go there, sit down and *immediately* start into the flow; any amount of time for patching, moving things, etc. will not only sap the energy for thinking and writing and making music, but will more pragmatically steal actual minutes that could be devoted to creating.</p><p>Have everything ready for you.

My<br/>girls Emily and Amanda are 6 and 4 now so it&apos;s much easier.<br/>Somewhere around the time after Amanda was born I started to<br/>ritualize the times I lulled them to sleep with spontaneous singing.<br/>It wasn&apos;t always pretty nor even remotely &quot;lullaby&quot; stuff in the<br/>usual sense (even forays into Tuvan &quot;Kargiraa&quot; style occurred).  I<br/>remember being very depressed during that period of life how little<br/>time I had for &quot;me&quot; to rejeuvenate (plus performing music was just<br/>starting to happen and it never seemed that I was ready because of<br/>lack of practice time, sleep, etc.) and yet as that was happening<br/>these moments of creative music making for my daughters took on a<br/>life of their own and fed me infinite-fold.  I still do it every<br/>night though it&apos;s only at &quot;bedtime&quot; now (rarely any &quot;3:30AM-please-<br/>try-to-get-the-baby-back-down-dear&quot; scenarios anymore - though I&apos;d<br/>have to say that the trance brain dead states I was in sometimes led<br/>to some very productive/creative improv&apos;s - if I could only remember<br/>for sure!!!) - and I don&apos;t plan on extinguishing this habit anytime<br/>soon.  In fact, I remember hankering for the $$$ and time to<br/>multitrack/loop and compose with more &quot;sophisticated&quot; equip. so I<br/>could really refine the ideas and layer the music.  Now that I have<br/>some of that stuff (and value/use it greatly) I still find myself<br/>preferring these simple purely acoustic moments connecting directly<br/>with the girls/myself/the muse singing them to sleep - I guess I&apos;m<br/>lucky to be able to do my music virtually anywhere since most of what<br/>I prefer to do is harmonic singing.</p><p>&gt; The idea of having a two-hour block of quiet time to myself is an<br/>&gt; almost unthinkable utopia!!</p><p>...ahh well, that still is to me too! :)</p><p>I like what Jon wrote:</p><p>&gt;What works for me is to actually *schedule* time for this, just as<br/>if it<br/>were an appointment.

Whenever you can sleep, do.  Cumulative lack of<br/>sleep has a dehibilitating effect.  And hire a sitter , even if its<br/>justfor a few hours, once a week and spend some quality time with<br/>another adult, like your spouse:-)</p><p>Use a little portable tape recorder for ideas and hum in it whenever<br/>a tune comes to you.

If your practice area is near your computer, and if<br/>you have plenty of disk space - little excuse not to since it has<br/>gotten so cheap - you can use the built-in sound recorder and the<br/>cheap little mic that comes with it to capture the magic moments.<br/>This allows you to organize individual, named sound files in folders,<br/>and to hear them back more-or-less instantly, rather than searching a<br/>cassette with forward-rewind.  You might even want to leave it running<br/>the whole time, then go back and cull the good stuff later, freeing up<br/>space.  I like to do that esp. when I begin falling into that<br/>transcendental state where I&apos;m not fully aware of anything but the<br/>flow of the music around me - not a likely scenario with kids to<br/>watch, of course, but it might apply anyway.  Hey, Kris, come to think<br/>of it, you could record you and kids and all for a Cage-esque<br/>aleatoric thing!  Little kids are incurably microtonal :-)</p><p>David</p></div>
