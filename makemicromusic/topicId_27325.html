My idea is that you<br/>&gt; should never need to look at the .orc file anyway, since it will work on a<br/>&gt; .sco file which has a standardized format. Messing about with .csd cleans<br/>&gt; things up in some ways, but it&apos;s extremely geeky, and I want to see CSound<br/>&gt; de-geekified. I would be happy to be a tester for this plan, though my rate<br/>&gt; of music production is on the slow side and someone like Chris might be<br/>&gt; better; I think this group would be a great place to try it out on.

There are 3 p-fields which are<br/>guaranteed in a .sco file: instrument number, onset beat, duration. The rest<br/>are user definable. Why? Not every conceivable instrument uses or needs<br/>extra p-fields. So no standard is or should be enforced. Now, one can make a<br/>private standard, as I, or Michael Gogins, have done, where you define a few<br/>other expected positional parameters, etc. But to try to &apos;enforce&apos; that<br/>standard across the user base of Csound would be ludicrous. It&apos;s designed to<br/>be open and flexible sound programming, doing whatever general sound problem<br/>one can devise.</p><p>So, the answer in this domain, MIDI-like but flexible microtonal composition<br/>realization, is a standardized *front-end*, which is what you have with my<br/>script, microcsound.</p><p>&gt;  So, I<br/>&gt; &gt; would go with learning how to get this going, and help me make it<br/>&gt; &gt; better...I&apos;m open and friendly about taking feature requests.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean getting your program to work on Windows? That will entail some<br/>&gt; considerable amount of work and neither of us is up to the task.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t think so. I think if we can put it in some standard places and make<br/>a .BAT file for Windows that follows the functionality of my existing<br/><a href="http://install.py">install.py</a> file, we&apos;re set, and then other Windows users cold follow suit,<br/>should they choose. I&apos;m not motivated to do this, b/c I don&apos;t have/like/use<br/>Windows. But I&apos;m willing to help you get up and running.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The other reason you don&apos;t want to go .sco file editing by hand is that<br/>&gt; it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; a PITA anyway, and you can&apos;t see counterpoint horizontally like you can<br/>&gt; &gt; clearly in an .mc file.

A format that closely<br/>&gt; followed .seq would be terrific, and pretty natural for CSound.</p><p>.seq and .sco are very easy to translate one to the other. They are both<br/>vertical formats. Why anyone would want to type directly a .sco file is<br/>beyond me, but some people do. More power to them. It would just slow me<br/>down.</p><p>&gt; I really don&apos;t see it as a PITA. What I would see as a PITA would be<br/>&gt; symbols allegedly making things easier, rather than numbers.</p><p>You can use symbols OR numbers freely in microcsound.</p><p>&quot;c d e f g a b c&apos;&quot; is the same, in 12-equal, as &quot;0 2 4 5 7 9 11 12&quot;</p><p>&gt; What is really, really, REALLY a PITA is the lack of a fixed standard for<br/>&gt; .sco files.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Again, this isn&apos;t a problem, it&apos;s a feature --- it&apos;s called generality.<br/>Besides, it&apos;s not even true---.sco files have a definite standard and<br/>expected syntax. But anyway, certain p-fields would be meaningless in<br/>certain instruments whereas others need dozens and dozens. So this<br/>generality, it allows people to create their own domain space to work in.<br/>It&apos;s also not a problem in your domain, because you&apos;ve been presented with a<br/>solution. The only problem in your case is getting scripts on your<br/>exectuable path! :)</p><p>Isn&apos;t there a way to install something manually by copying it to an<br/>exectuables directory, registry be damned?</p><p>What the hell is the point of the registry, anyway?....it&apos;s like an /etc<br/>directory, done badly, I think.

There are extra parameters here, but they are safely<br/>ignored holdovers from a global &quot;extra parameter&quot; variable that microcsound<br/>holds in its memory. If a .sco file has such extra parameters, but the<br/>called instrument doesn&apos;t use them, they are safely ignored. They come from<br/>the top, where i202 is called. i202 in my .orc is a mixer control<br/>instrument, and these are mixer control parameters: Dry level, Wet level,<br/>Reverb size, Reverb filter cutoff.</p><p>So, the meaning of the extra parameters, if any, is set by you, the user,<br/>because being forced to say, always, that slot 11 is filter cutoff level<br/>when your sound has nothing to do with that or doesn&apos;t need that, is a kind<br/>of fascism. ;)</p><p>Here&apos;s the input to microcsound that produced this .sco file:</p><p>1: div=0 i=201 1 &amp;0 i=202 &quot;.7%.27%.5%8000&quot; 1 &amp;0<br/>1: div=31 t=96 i=1 pan=0.7<br/>2: div=31          pan=0.4<br/>#<br/>1: 1/4   e   d  c     d  |     .e .e e2 |<br/>2: 1/8 c,3 .c, g,,2 g,,2 | 1/4 c, g, 1/8 c,b,,c,2 |<br/>#<br/>1: 1/4  d  d   d2         |    e g g2  |<br/>2: 1/8 g,2 zg, g,,2a,,b,, |1/4 c,g,c,g,,|<br/>#<br/>1: 1/4   e   d  c    d   | .e .e        e2 |<br/>2: 1/8 c,3 .c, g,2 g,,2  | 1/4 c, g, 1/8 c,b,,c,e,, |<br/>#<br/>1: 1/4 d d        e     d      |     c3 z &amp;-4 z [f,a,] [e,g,] z ||<br/>2: 1/4 g,,g,, 1/8 g,,a,,b,,g,, | 1/4 a,,f,,c,z ||</p><p>You tell me, what&apos;s easier to think about or look at?</p><p>AKJ</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; What is really, really, REALLY a PITA is the lack of a fixed standard<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; .sco files.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, this isn&apos;t a problem, it&apos;s a feature --- it&apos;s called generality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s called unusability so far as most people are concerned, I am sure.<br/>&gt; Which is why I think a For Dummies project here would be a good idea. But<br/>&gt; your reaction is the typical CSound one, acting as if I am proposing a Czar<br/>&gt; take over rule of all the Csound orchestras.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>You are making up battles with people in your head.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Besides, it&apos;s not even true---.sco files have a definite standard and<br/>&gt; &gt; expected syntax.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To a certain point, and then it stops. And people can take those standards<br/>&gt; and screw around with them because in CSound you can screw around with<br/>&gt; anything.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yup, and that&apos;s the point.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But anyway, certain p-fields would be meaningless in<br/>&gt; &gt; certain instruments whereas others need dozens and dozens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And a typical CSound orc file doesn&apos;t document how they get used, much less<br/>&gt; provide examples.<br/>&gt;</p><p>One wouldn&apos;t necessarily need to document one&apos;s own instruments if one knows<br/>what they do, and one has learned Csound.</p><p>I didn&apos;t write my orchestra file and say to myself: I wonder if this is<br/>going to confuse Gene someday---better comment it!!!</p><p>Do you comment your math work so I can grok it?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Isn&apos;t there a way to install something manually by copying it to an<br/>&gt; &gt; exectuables directory, registry be damned?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This isn&apos;t making sense in Windows terms, but I get the impression maybe I<br/>&gt; can just edit the Python script.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I think so!</p><p>AKJ</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=27384 href="#27384">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2011 10:59:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How do you know it&apos;s a big task until you try it?</p><p>Forget about it.
