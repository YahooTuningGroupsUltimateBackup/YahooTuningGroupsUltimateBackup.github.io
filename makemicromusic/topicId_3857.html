It pecked around in there but it had chosen to go in in the first place,<br/>so I think can&apos;t have been out of distress, though must surely have been a bit frustrating to<br/>peck away at the metal throughout the winter and never make any impression on it.</p><p>You saw it fly in and out of the little hole on occasion (blue tits are particularly<br/>renowned for taking up residence in such like places).</p><p>I thought perhaps it was a bird that we were expected to know - but will be interesting<br/>to know the name anyway.</p><p>Perhaps I should try and do a piece for my little bird too :-) - but it was a number of years<br/>ago now.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
