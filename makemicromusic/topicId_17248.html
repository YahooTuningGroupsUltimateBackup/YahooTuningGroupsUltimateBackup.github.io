I&apos;m reading the new paper now...</p><p>The abstract is apparently a bit of salesmanship.  They don&apos;t<br/>go into the &apos;12 tones is universal&apos; claim in the text.  Instead<br/>they say that &apos;pentatonic and diatonic subsets of the chromatic<br/>scale&apos; are universal.  There&apos;s some truth to this, but the text<br/>still seems to state it much too strongly.</p><p>Another part of the text is worth quoting at length:</p><p>&quot;&quot;<br/>...the present results are pertinent to the longstanding argument<br/>in music about which of several tuning systems is &quot;natural&quot;.  In<br/>so far as the observations here inform this argument, the observed<br/>ratios in speech spectra accord most closely with a just intonation<br/>tuning system. Ten of the 12 intervals generated by the analysis of<br/>either English or Mandarin vowel spectra are those used in just<br/>intonation tuning, whereas 4 of the 12 match the Pythagorean tuning<br/>and only 1 of the 12 intervals matches those used in equal<br/>temperament. The two anomalies in our data with respect to just<br/>intonation concern the minor second and the tritone. The interval<br/>ratio of the minor second defined by F2/F1 in speech is 1.0625<br/>whereas, in just intonation (which is based on maintaining perfect<br/>fifths and major thirds in each octave), this interval is 1.0667.<br/>This difference occurs because 1.0667 is the ratio of 16:15, which<br/>does not occur in speech because the range of maximum intensity in<br/>the first formant peak extends only up to the 10th harmonic. Our<br/>value of 1.0625 for the minor second arises from formant ratios<br/>of 17:8, 17:4, and 17:2 (see Fig. 3 and Methods). Similarly, our<br/>value for the tritone is 1.400 whereas the just intonation value<br/>is 1.406. This difference arises because 1.406 is the ratio of<br/>45:32, which again does not occur in speech, in this case because<br/>the range of maximum intensity in the second formant peak extends<br/>only up to the 26th harmonic. The values 1.400 in speech arise<br/>from the F2/F1 ratios in the database of 7:5, 14:5, 21:5, 14:10,<br/>and 21:10 (see again Fig. 3 and Methods). In summary, just<br/>intonation tuning closely fits the chromatic scale defined by<br/>speech data. The fact that instruments in just intonation tuning<br/>are widely agreed to sound &quot;brighter&quot; than in the equal temperament<br/>tuning used for the last three centuries (a compromise that allows<br/>multiple instruments to play pieces that include notes in more than<br/>one key) is in keeping with our conclusion that the chromatic scale<br/>arises from formant ratios in speech.&quot;&quot;</p><p>So they actually do reach the right conclusions, but they frame<br/>it in a language that makes it sounds wrong.  They find that JI<br/>is a better fit than ET, even though they aren&apos;t giving themselves<br/>credit for 7:5 and 17:16!  And they say that ET has been used for<br/>300 years, which is wrong.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=17259 href="#17259">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2007 12:33:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ....the present results are pertinent to the longstanding argument<br/>&gt; in music about which of several tuning systems is &quot;natural&quot;.
