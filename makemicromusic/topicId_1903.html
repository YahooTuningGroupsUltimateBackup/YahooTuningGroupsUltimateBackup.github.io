Were you just being playful<br/>&gt; Graham?</p><p>I had posted the previous two messages to this list before your critical<br/>one arrived.  I find some of your posts to be unduly aggressive, and I<br/>thought I&apos;d point that out in a playful way.  From other comments you&apos;ve<br/>made, I think maybe you don&apos;t intend them to come across that way.</p><p>I also like a lot of the music you&apos;ve posted.  So it&apos;s a shame you seem to<br/>set yourself up as an opponent to some of the things I do or believe in.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, my post was merely intended as a &apos;Go Team!&apos;<br/>&gt; cheer emitted in the excitement of all the recent REAL<br/>&gt; MUSIC action on the list lately, like you might hear at<br/>&gt; a Big Game - &quot;Rock em Sock em Knock em down!
