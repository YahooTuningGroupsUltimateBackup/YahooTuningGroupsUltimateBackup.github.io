Then I use a synth where each midi channel can be retuned<br/>separately, tuned to one of the 12-subsets of 19. And, last, the sound<br/>assigned to the lower half of the keyboard must be a few octaves<br/>higher than the soumnd assigned to the upper half, so I can play all<br/>19 tones in the same octave range.</p><p>This way, composing can be done on the instrument, and the results can<br/>be tested under conditions that are reasonably close to the concert<br/>situation.<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
