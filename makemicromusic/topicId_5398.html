Their product is pumped out of them by the machinery of the record<br/>contract and pastuerized by the censorship of mass-produced pop culture and<br/>compressed by the corporate marketing machine into hard cheese for everyone<br/>except for the blue vein of the corporate elite.<br/>Who benefits from this industrial treatment of music? Not the artists, who<br/>must sell the rights to their work in order to gain access to the means of<br/>distribution which the six major media corporations monopolize. Not the audiences<br/>who must pay for over-inflated CDs and concert tickets and can access only<br/>those forms of music which are considered marketable by the gatekeepers of popular<br/>culture.<br/>    The only class which seems to benefit from the dominant form of musical<br/>manufacture are the shareholders of the major labels and their<br/>pseudo-independent subsidiaries. The commericalization of music, like so many other aspects of<br/>modern society, is a tool for the concentration of wealth and the majority of<br/>musicians are as exploited as any other industrial worker.<br/>    So what forms of resistance exist to this rampant commodification?<br/>Firstly there is the immediatist response - to make music only for the pleasure of<br/>the players and never perform it publicly or record it. Then there is the DIY<br/>movement championed by punk bands like Crass, where bands are encouraged to<br/>manage themselves, organise their own shows in whatever venue is available -<br/>ideally all-age, non-commercial ones - make their own records and run &apos;distros&apos; to<br/>trade them with other bands. The DIY philosophy has been remarkably<br/>successful within the various punk subgenres with warehouse venues, garage rehearsal<br/>rooms, home studios and small scale labels and distros springing in and out of<br/>existence all over the world. To some degree the same DIY ethos can be seen at<br/>work within other musical subcultures such as the underground dance party<br/>movement or the lo-fi and indie pop genres. But although DIY has kept an<br/>independent musical muse alive it has yet to become a publicly-accepted alternative to<br/>the corporate world and thousands of young music writers and performers are<br/>still trapped into exploitation by the promise of fame, fortune and album sales.<br/>    As well as DIY there are also the independent labels often run by cult<br/>celebrities. Examples include Alternative Tentacles run by Jello Biafra of Dead<br/>Kennedys&apos; fame and Epitaph run by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. The major<br/>problem with the &apos;indies&apos; being that they are still businesses, bound by the<br/>structural injustices of the state-corporate system. Each indie could potentially<br/>become a major of the future, be bought up by one of the majors or turn out<br/>to be a sub-label created by a major to niche market more edgy musical<br/>commodities to more skeptical alternative music consumers.<br/>    If the hands of the corporate ogre are to be removed from the neck of the<br/>music world, there needs to be a way for all of the people involved in these<br/>anti-corporate organisations to pool their resources and form a transnational<br/>co-operation that I have dubbed Indymusic. I envision a global network of open<br/>content websites that showcase independent music along the lines of the way<br/>Indymedia currently provides alternative news.</p><p>Each site would include:</p><p>*   Features on non-corporate bands, venues, labels etc.<br/>*   An open-publishing &apos;music-wire&apos; down the right-hand side of the page<br/>which artists could use to announce the release of a single, tour dates or any<br/>other news about their musical activities<br/>*   A database of music encoded using .ogg (the open source Ogg Vorbis format<br/>(<a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">http://www.vorbis.com/</a>) with info on the artist and how to donate to them (a<br/>la <a href="http://www.adoptaband.com">www.adoptaband.com</a>) or buy their recordings. Artists could put the song<br/>and their artist info in the database for music fans and even radio stations to<br/>download for their playlists. Ideally that archive would also be linked to<br/>some of the popular file-sharing networks, especially the open source Gnutella<br/>network (<a href="http://www.gnutella.com/">http://www.gnutella.com/</a>).</p><p>    Another part of the concept is for each local Indymusic group to also be<br/>affiliated to a community recording facility - an Independent Sound Centre -<br/>where the music can be produced, converted to .ogg and audio CDs made, recycled<br/>cardboard cases and slicks made, etc. This facility could also involve video<br/>artists making music videos and burning them to DVD. The Independent Sound<br/>Centres could fund themselves by burning and selling compilations and albums of<br/>each other&apos;s local artists. The concept would be communicated in a &apos;copyleft&apos;<br/>open content license (<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">http://www.creativecommons.org/</a>) that would mirror the<br/>way open source software licenses guarantee the freedom of anyone to distribute<br/>the content free or for a fee negotiated with the buyer.<br/>    The Indymusic network could also help bands tour, providing accomodation<br/>and help with finding venues, support bands etc. If the costs and stress of<br/>touring can be reduced to the point that playing live becomes a viable and<br/>enjoyable living for artists, they can stop stressing about shifting units and<br/>celebrate the fact that fans anywhere in the world can download their music free<br/>or buy it cheap from their local Indymusic centre.<br/>    How can you help? It depends on what skills and resources you can offer.<br/>The first thing you can do is help to circulate and develop this proposal. If<br/>you have access to computer equipment, especially internet servers and<br/>bandwidth we are going to need that to run the indymusic sites. We will need<br/>graphical designers and web language programmers to build and maintain the sites. We<br/>will need sound-proof spaces or space in no-noise-control areas for the<br/>Independent Sound Centres. We will need instruments, amps, microphones, mixers,<br/>cables, computers and other equipment as well as the engineering and teaching time<br/>of capable sound recordists for the recording, digitizing and CD-making<br/>aspects of the ISCs. We will need people to help raise funds and promote the concept<br/>to the community.<br/>    At the moment I&apos;m looking for input from artists about the proposal and<br/>to see how they would feel about using such a system. I would really appreciate<br/>it if you could talk to any musos you know and pass my email address<br/>strypey@... around for feedback. If the level of freedom in a supposedly<br/>democratic society can be guaged by looking at the independence of its artists,<br/>journalists and historians then we have a lot of work to do before we should<br/>presume to call ourselves a free people.</p><p>Anti-Copyright July 2003 by Danyl Strype.
