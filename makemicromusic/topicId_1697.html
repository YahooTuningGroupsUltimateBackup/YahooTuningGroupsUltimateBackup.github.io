I can<br/>understand it though.  You live in D.C. and have not<br/>had the opportunity to experience the true pain of<br/>what being around Bob Moses is like.  I have seen him<br/>DESTROY countless gigs (playing original music with<br/>local musicians) through almost any means imaginable.<br/>&apos;Although I&apos;m new to the list and I&apos;m sure this is now<br/>an old topic, I feel the need to select a Moses story<br/>to share.  Bob tells his version of this story in his<br/>letter; here&apos;s what it looked like from the audience.<br/>Jared Sims, who was attacked in Bob&apos;s ill-informed<br/>article, performed with Bob Moses on Brenda Hopkin&apos;s<br/>show at Ryle&apos;s Jazz Club.  Moses didn&apos;t know any of<br/>the tunes.  In fact, he played through almost every<br/>single ending, and then turned it into a five-minute<br/>drum solo where he would sing along with himself.  It<br/>was great the first time, but as the night went on,<br/>Bob made it more and more obvious that he had no<br/>interest in doing anything but playing alone, and<br/>furthermore that he didn&apos;t care very much about making<br/>the songs work.  After about five of Bob&apos;s song ending<br/>solos, Jared (sax) and the other horn player decided<br/>to start trying to play along.  They didn&apos;t play just<br/>random shit either; they played the melody that Bob<br/>was singing!  He hated it, grimaced, and in general<br/>made a real idiot out of himself.  Bob Moses cleared<br/>out a full room with a bad attitude.<br/>&apos;In direct reference to his article, Bob may make a<br/>few decent points, but he obliterates them with his<br/>personal examples.  James Merenda doesn&apos;t make money<br/>off of Mingus&apos;s name!  Has anyone been to see<br/>&quot;Portrait of Mingus&quot; at Lincoln Center lately, no,<br/>maybe at the Choppin&apos; Block!!  James Merenda also<br/>plays plenty of original music, and furthermore plays<br/>it with a spirit and passion that I think even Bob<br/>Moses would like if he took the chance to listen! And<br/>there is the catch! Bob Moses does not listen to young<br/>musicians in Boston; he makes assumptions about them<br/>based on the color of their skin.<br/>&apos;Moses personal examples of the saintly musical lives<br/>of the members of Medeski Martin and Wood further<br/>illustrate how dark it was where he was typing.  I<br/>believe I know every single musician Bob trashes<br/>personally.  Bob couldn&apos;t have picked a more dedicated<br/>group of people.  The readers of this list must know<br/>Taylor Bynum and the skills and passion with which he<br/>performs.  James Merenda is a fire on the sax!  I can<br/>speak for the band The Slip (who was added to this<br/>glorious article because of a one night concert in<br/>Boston) and tell you that contrary to what Bob thinks<br/>these guys attend &quot;Eskola de Samba&quot; and explore so<br/>many musical opportunities with nothing but love for<br/>doing it.<br/>&apos;I must add two great ironies to Bob&apos;s article.<br/>Miracle Orchestra, who Bob slays in passing, took a<br/>group lesson with Moses about four years ago.  I was<br/>the drummer, and I left the lesson first.  After I<br/>left the lesson, Bob asked the other members to kick<br/>me out so he could be in the band!  What a great<br/>teacher.<br/>&apos;Also, the best concert I&apos;ve ever seen Bob Moses<br/>perform on was a tribute to the music of Bob Marley.<br/>And unlike James Merenda with the Mingus group, I do<br/>believe that Bob did that gig for the money. If I was<br/>to hold Bob to his own standards the questions I would<br/>have to ask are,<br/>&apos;Bob do you have a deep understanding of Bob Marley?<br/>Have you been deeply involved in the culture of<br/>Rastafari?  Did you know Bob Marley personally?  Do<br/>white Jewish musicians like yourself really feel that<br/>you have a right to perform this music?  Do you plan<br/>to perform Bob Marley&apos;s music forever?  What will it<br/>be next week, the music of John Lennon, Paul Schaffer?<br/>&apos;If it were only his students and the younger<br/>generation that Bob so despised, I would understand.<br/>The &quot;Archie Bunker&quot; syndrome seems to be a natural<br/>thing.  But it&apos;s not the case.  Bob spent most of my<br/>time during drum lessons talking shit!  Bob refers to<br/>Joey Baron as &quot;The Groove Destroyer.&quot;  Brian Blade<br/>just isn&apos;t good enough for him.  One day Bob was<br/>actually tearing apart John Abercrombie&apos;s guitar<br/>playing and John walked in the room.  &quot;John what&apos;s up<br/>man, we got to play!&quot;  HmmmÂ…<br/>&apos;Bob Moses has boiled the legacy of Mingus down to a<br/>bad attitude. I wonder if Charles REALLY wants Bob to<br/>be down here on earth as his mediator?  After all,<br/>wasn&apos;t Bob 12 years old when they were friendly?  If<br/>Mingus is waiting in heaven to kick James Merenda&apos;s<br/>ass, I&apos;ve got to think that there&apos;s a long line of<br/>people upstairs with Bob&apos;s number. His whole article<br/>reeks of jealous question &quot;Why wasn&apos;t I the one in<br/>that article?&quot; The answer: You&apos;ve pissed off every<br/>musician you&apos;ve played with in the last ten years.&apos;</p><p>Well, he never pissed me off . . . but I do feel bad for the writer<br/>of this response, who I know to be one of the most humble people on<br/>earth and an astoundingly soulful musician.</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

He definitely has music inside him real deep,<br/>but were he a nicer guy to be around, he may actually be on alot more albums<br/>than he is. When I met him, he seemed like a nut. A good nut, but a nut none<br/>the less. Nutty people can be like Paul&apos;s friend describes Moses. I doubt they<br/>mean to be mean or rude, they probably have some deep self-esteem issues to<br/>deal with. Those who may think that his arrogance is evidence of high<br/>self-esteem, should consider the fact that often, arrogance is a sign of inner<br/>criticism, and the boasting is an attempt at spirit elevation. Dejohnette and<br/>other top (busy) drummers have all impressed me as humble and down to earth.<br/>Drummers, perhaps above all other musician groups, tend to be a close knit<br/>group, with little of the petty crap we see between some guitar players for<br/>example. Bob is an anomoly as far as I am concerned.</p><p>For Mingus, I think anyone with love and respect for him, is doing a fine job<br/>of protecting his whatever. Same for Ives and other MMM Martyr&apos;s.</p><p>Too bad about Moses, I really like his music.</p><p>Thanks for sharing Paul.</p><p>GZ</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 3:49:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, life is complicated, and some people even see that as a good<br/>thing, and maybe it is. But it always seems to me that messy public<br/>airing of the private dirty laundry always makes everyone worse off<br/>for it. In his initial editorial, Moses himself opened the door for<br/>these things, and, even if it was with noble intentions and colored by<br/>overly personal connections regarding Mingus, it was his tact that<br/>steered it in this direction more than need be.</p><p>These are adult foibles and they&apos;re like a great contagion that knocks<br/>everything in its path down a notch or two. Kids are indoctrinated<br/>young and have no concerns for noble pretence... it&apos;s a wonderful<br/>life.</p><p>While I&apos;m firmly pessimistic, I&apos;ve known people who bite their tongue,<br/>and some who don&apos;t even need to. So who knows, maybe eternity won&apos;t<br/>rid itself of humans. I can&apos;t see any scenarios where that&apos;s anything<br/>but bad management however!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Jonathan M.
