No problem<br/>to my ears.  My Magic temperament demo at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/magicpump.mp3">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/magicpump.mp3</a>&gt; varies the tuning between and<br/>beyond 19- and 22-equal, not perfectly in synch between instruments, also<br/>without problems.  So maybe you could get away with 12 and 19 together.  I<br/>haven&apos;t tried because meantones a bit mundane for me right now :-)</p><p>A lot depends on how important consonance is.  If you can write in<br/>13-equal, you can write in 13-equal with something else at the same time,<br/>as Dan seems to have demonstrated.  One trick is to get all instruments to<br/>agree on the tonic, so that at least the resolutions will work.</p><p>              Graham</p></div>
