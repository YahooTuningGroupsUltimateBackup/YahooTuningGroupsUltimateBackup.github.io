There isn&apos;t a single way of mapping this scale to note names that&apos;s<br/>clearly better than any other way, but here&apos;s one possible way:</p><p>C=0 D=3 E=5 F=7 G=9 A=12 B=14 C=16</p><p>Note that most of the major and minor thirds are spelled the same as in<br/>traditional notation, except that B-D is a major third. The notes in<br/>between can be notated with sharps and flats.</p><p>C C# Db D Eb E Fb F F# G G# Ab A Bb B Cb C</p><p>And you can easily add the cents notation to these written notes as<br/>necessary:</p><p>C+0 C#-25 Db+50 D+25 Eb+0 E-25 Fb+50 F+25 F#+0 G-25 G#-50 Ab+25 A+0 Bb-25<br/>B-50 Cb+25 C+0</p><p>Another way of mapping the scale is like this:</p><p>C=0 D=2 E=4 F=7 G=9 A=11 B=13 C=16</p><p>This gives you minor thirds on C-E, F-A, and G-B (the traditional major<br/>thirds) and major thirds on the other four (the traditional minor thirds):<br/>the exact opposite of standard notation.</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@...</h3><span>3/11/2002 5:31:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Markus,</p><p>If you have a Windows or Linux pc, you can download<br/>Scala, <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala</a><br/>Then if you select &quot;Options&quot; in the Edit menu and<br/>press the &quot;Select&quot; button in the &quot;Note naming<br/>options&quot; area, you will find three different notation<br/>systems for 16-tET, from Easley Blackwood,<br/>Herman Miller and Erv Wilson, E16, M16 and W16<br/>respectively.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
