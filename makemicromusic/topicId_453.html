What can Sound Forge do<br/>that Cool Edit cannot??  I have both programs but can&apos;t figure it<br/>out.  It *looks* like Sound Forge comes out a bit differently for<br/>reverb and so forth, but the tools in Cool Edit are pretty good for<br/>that too, and the &quot;audition&quot; feature seems superior.  Anybody with<br/>both programs have any comments??

I&apos;ve always found you very reliable. :) But it&apos;s good to<br/>see/hear you say this, because I&apos;ve always felt one should offer both<br/>lo- and hi- bandwidth versions, just for people like yourself (and<br/>some of our UK and European members, who pay by the second, etc.).</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t mind the lack of quality, so long as i can hear the intent<br/>&gt; of the music</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt; Second, as list-mom, you could whip that tyranical bird finger into<br/>&gt; a file deleting frenzy, making space for your piece.</p><p>Well, I wouldn&apos;t do it just for me...</p><p>&gt; Or, you could make an announcement of some sort, and we could all<br/>&gt; delete our stuff from the files area.

I&apos;m pretty stoked by<br/>how much music has been / is being shared, and Monz mentioned he&apos;d be<br/>taking down his 5 meg symphony. We&apos;ll all have to keep tabs on the<br/>file space usage and if stuff has been up for a while, clean out your<br/>lockers.</p><p>&gt; At regular bit-rate compression, how big is your file anyway?</p><p>I have no idea, but will find out. The piece is around 10 minutes, so<br/>it would add up.

SF Noise Reduction is also an add-on, or at least the industrial strength version is. The tool I referred to I use a lot to split up tracks: when importing something from a minidisc, it finds the &apos;blank&apos; spaces and then I can break up into separate files for making CDs.</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=478 href="#478">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2001 10:59:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Easy to set up and minimal spam.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a><br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Jonathan M.

Then after they are removed from the files here they<br/>  &gt;will still be available there. I have added a text file with the address<br/>  &gt;of the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site where I will be putting my old examples.</p><p>  Very smart idea, John! I&apos;ll try doing that myself, but could you answer<br/>  this: does putting up a site start an avalanche of spam or unwanted emails?<br/>  And is setting up a site fairly straight-forward?</p><p>  Cheers,<br/>  Jon</p><p>  Your use of Yahoo!
