Although I pushed for a patch to get rid of a<br/>clicking problem--an old TiMidity developer has self-published a patch<br/>to fix that issue. And, from the TODO file, it looks like the next<br/>FluidSynth version may contain MTS functionality.</p><p>AKJ<br/>--</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p></div>
