They really do sound quite a bit superior to &gt;MIDI.  I&apos;ll have to learn more about all these synths sometime...</p><p>Remember: MIDI is *not* a sound. MIDI is only a specification for controlling sound *sources*. The quality of the resulting music certainly depends on the composition/improvisation as it is &apos;encoded&apos; in MIDI, but the entire sound spectrum of the resulting music is rendered entirely by the end sound-producing medium - be it a computer soundcard, a hardware synth, a software synth, a sampler, or an application of sounds/samples to a MIDI file by another program (as in a MIDI-to-Wav application).</p><p>But you are correct: a dedicated sound source, with a lot of parameters to control (before or during the recording/playing of the sound) will, ultimately, bring a much higher quality to the end-product piece of music.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
