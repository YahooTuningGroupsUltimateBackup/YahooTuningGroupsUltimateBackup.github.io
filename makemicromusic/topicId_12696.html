(You can read more about this on the site).</p><p>Although it&apos;s written in MAX/MSP,  you don&apos;t need the application to run it. You can download a &quot;standalone&quot;,  or else use it with the &quot;RunTime&quot; (free) version of the application.  You&apos;ll need a broadband/DSL connection to download,  as the files are pretty big.  Also,  it definitely works on Mac OS X,  and a random duude in Italy assured me that he got it to work on PC.</p><p>G&apos;Day,<br/>C Bailey</p></div>
