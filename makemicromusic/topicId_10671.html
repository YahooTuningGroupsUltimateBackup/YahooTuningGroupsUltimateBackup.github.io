In this<br/>&gt;case, I&apos;m referring to a Janko-layout mechanical action that uses a<br/>&gt;(patetend) mechanical parallelogram linkage to equalize the key<br/>&gt;travel from the front to back of the keyboard.  Norman Henry and I<br/>&gt;have one of these actions here in the Bay Area, but it&apos;s designed to<br/>&gt;fit a Knabe (IIRC) grand, which we don&apos;t have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl</p><p>Paul writes...</p><p>&quot;&quot;Actually, I know of no in-force patent on the parallelogram linkage.<br/>This is an old idea, going back at least as far as Leslie F. Astell&apos;s<br/>United Kingdom patent #737,268, published in 1955.</p><p>And Raffali&apos;s U.S. patent from 1968 is long expired:<br/>*<a href="http://tinyurl.com/bane7*">http://tinyurl.com/bane7*</a><br/>&quot;&quot;</p></div><h3>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2005 7:36:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think it was Astell&apos;s in the Jennings Univox, a kind of English<br/>monophonic pushup organ like a Hammond Solovox, but the action was<br/>assigned to and probably manufactured by Herrburger Brooks. It&apos;s a<br/>four link mechanism like a pantograph, a stationary flange is screwed<br/>to a rail and a moving flange fixed to a projection on the key<br/>connected by two indentical, parallel abstracts pinned at both ends.<br/>The patent illustrates a single coil spring acting between the key and<br/>the rearward placed stationary flange, and incorporates a simple<br/>switch. There will be some small rotary motion but it is a compact<br/>arrangement that allows uniform motion to the entire surface of the<br/>key.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
