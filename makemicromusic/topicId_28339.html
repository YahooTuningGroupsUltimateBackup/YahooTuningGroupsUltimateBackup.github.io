Took me quite a while to write it, as short as it is... Writing counterpoint is not a piece of cake - Jake, you are not alone...</p><p>BTW, the system I sketched is sort of simplified compared to classical counterpoint - there is, e.g., a rule that there must be no series of imperfect consonances longer than 2 notes, which would translate into a rule not only involving an, bn and a(n+1) but also b(n-1). Mathematically, the system can be described as a Markov process - my simplified system would be a first-order Markov process while classical counterpoint would be a second-order one.</p><p>Besides, in classical counterpoint rules the absolutes values of the an matter while in my system it is only the difference (the interval from one cantus firmus note to the next). But all these things could be modeled in a very similar ways, if desired.</p><p>For me, even in this simplified form, the system is starting to work quite well now - it is, however, rather a rough framework giving merely hints on how to proceed.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds good Hans!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Nov 15, 2011 at 3:26 AM, hstraub64 &lt;straub@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have been working on a counterpoint system for 17edo for some time now.<br/>&gt; &gt; The basic idea is sketched here:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_16475.html#16573">/makemicromusic/topicId_16475.html#16573</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The principle works for any tuning.

The resulting system for 17edo (still<br/>&gt; &gt; in development) includes the intervals known from classical counteproint<br/>&gt; &gt; adding fourths, major seconds and minor sevenths, it has also fifth<br/>&gt; &gt; parallels. For BP this would undoubtedly look different again - would be an<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting endeavour to do.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is an example how it sounds in 17edo - not that &quot;unusual&quot;, though...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="https://share.ols.inode.at/OGBUK5NNMW6JJRI4V8HDT9WDAXFS8F7VVHQFLD39">https://share.ols.inode.at/OGBUK5NNMW6JJRI4V8HDT9WDAXFS8F7VVHQFLD39</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=28348 href="#28348">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2011 9:06:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is another one I forgot - this is in 88 cent ET tuning composed<br/>purposefully to study counterpoint.<br/>It comes with a score.</p><p><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=951">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=951</a></p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Nov 14, 2011 at 5:46 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone done counterpoint studies in BP or another very unusual scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Traditional counterpoint used the unison, octave, and fifth as perfect<br/>&gt; consonances, thirds and sixths as imperfect consonances, and other<br/>&gt; tones as dissonances.
