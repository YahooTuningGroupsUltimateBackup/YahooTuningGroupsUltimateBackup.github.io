Here&apos;s the deal... you listen to<br/>the piece and suggest an appropriate name or two.<br/>After a week or three, our esteemed panel of judges<br/>(that&apos;s my cat Fiji and myself) will pick a winning<br/>name and presto, it will be so.</p><p>Everyone who enters the contest will receive a free copy<br/>of EXOMUSICOLOGY (when its released in late August).<br/>The winning entry will also receive an extra special<br/>microtonal bonus...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 7:36:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;sethares&quot; &lt;sethares@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; nameless.mp3 is a (simulated) guitar and flute duet<br/>&gt; (along with assorted percussion)<br/>&gt; played in a Just Intonation major scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, would you like to help me name the song?</p><p>You bet.
