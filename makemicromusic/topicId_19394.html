Select<br/>or (de-select) the rules you want and see what you get. This<br/>software is particularly valuable when it comes to using external<br/>midi devices (eg Kurzweil) which can be tuned to any 12note sets of any<br/>temperament and in any note order. Thus the original notes are<br/>known, the pathway can be set, and the destination notes can be heard<br/>in real life. A scientifically controlled musical experiment is the<br/>result. Check out the manual which is on-line for more details. I am<br/>still very new to this software.</p></div>
