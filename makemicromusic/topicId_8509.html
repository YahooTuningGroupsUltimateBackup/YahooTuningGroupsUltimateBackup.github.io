I&apos;ve been playing with the latest<br/>version of Harmony Assistant from Myriad. It has reasonable microtonal<br/>support for many purposes. Each note that can be notated can be assigned an<br/>offset from 12-tET, up to 200 cents + or -. Enharmonics can be differently<br/>tuned, and it supports a number of extra accidental signs besides just<br/>sharp and flat. It seems to handle tunings well if they can be expressed in<br/>terms of ordinary notation, with a few kinds of accidentals. Should handle<br/>various kinds of JI. Handles 19-tET with an example shipped.</p><p>I made a 17-tET tuning table for it. It is rather excruciating to edit the<br/>microtonal adjustments... You have to make a new set of &quot;rules&quot;, then<br/>drill down through 2 levels of pop-up panels for each element of the tuning<br/>(rule) that you&apos;re going to work with, then fuss with a slider. But it<br/>works.</p><p>I made the virtual singer sing a 17-tET chromatic scale and saved the<br/>&quot;rules&quot; for that in a file. Each staff can have a different set of rules,<br/>so multiple simultaneous tunings are possible.</p><p>The program can also handle MIDI out, simultaneous with its internal sound<br/>rendering, so I was able to use Virtual Singer in one channel and send<br/>another channel to VAZ Modular and Rhino, and hear the mix. It can also<br/>apparently handle output of alternatively tuned MIDI via pitch bends on<br/>channels, so it&apos;s one method that could be used to tune other MIDI<br/>instruments, for people comfortable working with scores and standard<br/>notation.</p><p>For the price, it&apos;s a very nice piece of software.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2005 3:35:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There&apos;s also a lower-priced version called Melody Assistant that seems<br/>to have the full microtonal capability.  It is, as Rick said, a pain<br/>to set it up but once you have a suitable rules set you can reuse it.<br/>(Post rules sets to this groups files area, maybe?)  A factor to keep<br/>in mind is that MA/HA does use standard notation; you can attach<br/>nonstandard accidentals but it&apos;s a little awkward, and you have to use<br/>the symbols they&apos;ve got.</p><p>- Rich Holmes</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2005 5:43:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Three remarks --</p><p>1. A quick way to set up microtonal rules is just to tweak the sets packaged with HA for 19tet and for natural horn and barbershop quartet (both are JI rule sets).</p><p>2. The developers have set up a forum for voting on modifications. I hope that some of you will add votes to the proposal to increase tuning accuracy, and maybe someone has ideas on the open question about how to change a scala file into a rule set. If a handful of MMM readers get on this, we could probably shape HA into a very useful product.</p><p>3. You are not restricted to the Stoccata font set -- from the online help:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Each staff in your document can use a different character set. The same character set can blend several fonts.</p><p>To change the character set related to a staff, edit the staff display options (&quot;Staff&quot; menu) and select a character set in the pop-up menu. To apply this set to the whole score, check the &quot;Apply to all staves&quot; box.</p><p>If the character set you are selecting uses a font that is not installed on your computer, an alert message is displayed. Correct display of the staff will then only be possible on a computer that owns this font.</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
