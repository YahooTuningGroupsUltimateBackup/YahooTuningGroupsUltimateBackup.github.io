He saw my name in a program when I did Reinhard&apos;s fest in 1994, and called me out of the blue, asking if I would be interested in looking at the 34 tone electric guitar. Of course, I said yes, and he sent it right away. Well, I couldn&apos;t even tune it at first, didn&apos;t yet know what a comma was, but got that straightened out, and started learning the system. Then, he also sent the electric bass, and later financed the building of an acoustic bass guitar, and the refretting of an acoustic guitar as well (both done by John Starrett).<br/>   Not only that, but he was instrumental in getting John Schneider&apos;s Microfest rolling...he suggested to John that he do a concert, and offered to pay my way out to LA to play, which I did in 1997. But, Larry was already too ill to attend, so I went to the hospital, and played 34 tone acoustic for him, which may have been the first and only time he heard the guitar he envisioned actually being played. I believe he was pleased, and he passed away soon after. I remember him with great fondness, he was a good man with a big vision, and he put both his $$$ and his heart into getting the 34 tone system up and running. Plus, he had some really interesting keyboard ideas, which were featured in Xenharmonicon some years ago. He is still missed...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
