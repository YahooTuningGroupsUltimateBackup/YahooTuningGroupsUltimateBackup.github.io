Someone named Hudson Lacerda<br/>has done some postscript extensions. I downloaded the packge and it<br/>looks promising: as Margo Schulter and I at least agree, abcm2ps is a<br/>neat little program, packing professional looking ASCII music<br/>typesetting in a flexible small package with an elegant syntax and<br/>room (as proven here) for extensions.</p><p>Here&apos;s a message Mr. Lacerda posted showing his links:<br/><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/abcusers@yahoogroups.com/msg00093.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/abcusers@yahoogroups.com/msg00093.html</a></p><p>The above extensions include Sagittals!! (among others)</p><p>It should be noted that the current development version of abcm2ps<br/>supports some built-in microtonal accidentals already---I think I<br/>posted about this at one point already on this list, but it&apos;s worth<br/>reiterating.</p><p>I&apos;d like it to be able to do Huygens-Fokker style 31-tet notation,<br/>like one sees here:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/pics/notatie.png">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/pics/notatie.png</a></p><p>Yes, I know that I could write using traditional sharps, flts, and<br/>doubles, but it&apos;s problematic to know that Gbb is lower than F# in<br/>Pythagorean notation--and it would bother me to see the base-letter<br/>rise on the staff as the pitch fell.</p><p>Someday, I&apos;m going to extend &apos;et_compose&apos; or write an entirely new<br/>Python script for using abc syntax to micro-midi. It&apos;s nice and<br/>intuitive to work with letter names.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=11202 href="#11202">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2005 5:22:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot;<br/>&lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sorry if this was announced already, but it appears that for a while,<br/>&gt; abcm2ps has had microtonal accidentals.</p><p>That&apos;s great!
