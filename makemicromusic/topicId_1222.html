Enrique and Aislinn (and<br/>Paul Roger, who&apos;s no longer with the group) are friends of mine, and<br/>they&apos;re extremely talented musicians and just super nice folks to<br/>boot. Enrique and Aislinn have a keen interest in microtonality as<br/>well, and that&apos;s an area that they&apos;re starting to pursue with their<br/>powerhouse band Absolute Zero--I can&apos;t wait!</p><p>Ken Rubenstein is a guitarist (okay, quite a guitarist) who I&apos;ve<br/>written about before on these forums and elsewhere. This is recent<br/>interview and it has a bunch of audio samples and a nice picture of<br/>his extended Pythagorean acoustic too.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=1223 href="#1223">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2001 5:25:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is recent<br/>&gt; interview and it has a bunch of audio samples and a nice picture of<br/>&gt; his extended Pythagorean acoustic too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>He&apos;s almost got a Dinarra there!</p><p>Those frets look tied-on.
