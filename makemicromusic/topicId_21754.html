There are potentially an infinite number of ways to tune...I myself have greatly enjoyed the few I&apos;ve explored so far, and I have plans to continue this path for the rest of my life...only wish there was more time. There are no rules or limits for artistic expression...as soon as someone starts applying rules, or saying &quot;this is the only correct path,&quot; I know they do not know what they are talking about. Tuning theory is exactly that...if a person thinks all notes must be derived from the Harmonic Series, no problem for me...but, that doesn&apos;t mean that person has skills as a composer, player, arranger, or anything else....and hate to say it, after being on these forums for many years, I&apos;m a bit underwhelmed by quality of the music I&apos;ve heard from folks who come here. But, my opinion is just one of many, and if cats are having a good time composing and sharing what they do, that&apos;s a positive thing.<br/>   I just hosted a very successful blues show here in Denver, 3 bands, all killer musicians, and a remarkable lack of drama. There was no ego posturing, everybody did what they were supposed to do, and we sold it out, standing room only. My old friend Bob Lohr played with my band....he&apos;s been Chuck Berry&apos;s pianist for many years, and has recorded and produced many more excellent blues CD&apos;s over the years. In his solo on the slow blues &quot;Goin&apos; Down Slow,&quot; there was a moment when the feeling was so deep that it made me weep...as we might say, it was the real thing, and I was fortunate to be a part of it. If his piano had been tuned in JI, I don&apos;t think it would have made any difference...it was the expression of profound human feelings that moved me. If you can do that in JI, then that&apos;s what I wanna hear...and if you do it in 12 eq, I&apos;m happy as a little piglet. You folks who worry about decimal points as applied to music might be better advised to learn how to convey those deep and profound emotional states...cause that&apos;s what music is all about, in the long run....best from the willage...Stickman</p><p><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Hotmail: Trusted email with powerful SPAM protection.<br/><a href="http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/201469227/direct/01/">http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/201469227/direct/01/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21756 href="#21756">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 11:38:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>&gt;&quot;First of all...music supercedes tuning.&quot;<br/>Of course...but at the same time I swear lack of possibilities so far as tuning can be a huge bottle-neck/limitation on music.<br/>  For example, a half-tone (as in 12TET) is not used as a consecutive note in a chord IE C C# F G is not a &quot;resolved&quot; chord because of the C# coming only a half-step after a C.  Why not use something like a &quot;C#&quot; of 12/11 or 1.090909 instead of about 15/14 and make it feel at least resolved enough to be used commonly as a chord?   To me tuning is about finding creative ways past musical constraints imposed by tunings like 12TET: it&apos;s about &quot;the rules toward breaking rules&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Tuning theory is exactly that...if a person thinks all notes must be<br/>derived from the Harmonic Series, no problem for me...but, that doesn&apos;t<br/>mean that person has skills as a composer, player, arranger, or<br/>anything else&quot;<br/>   Agreed.  For one, I write music IE <a href="http://www.traxinspace.com/song/40893">http://www.traxinspace.com/song/40893</a> (partially micro-tonal) and <a href="http://www.traxinspace.com/song/37440">http://www.traxinspace.com/song/37440</a> (19TET).<br/>   However I&apos;ve recently stepped back to tuning due to frustration over having trouble finding the chords I want in my existing tunings and am just now getting back to composing with a 14-tone tuning that I believe solves the above problem IE making &quot;resolved-sounding half-step-based chords&quot; and enables several other types of typically-against-the-rules consonances...giving me more ways to nail the right/intended emotion (in addition to phrasing, arrangement, and other aspects of composition, of course).</p><p>&gt;&quot;If his piano had been tuned in JI, I don&apos;t think it would have made any<br/>difference.. .it was the expression of profound human feelings that<br/>moved me.&quot;<br/>     Of course, a great enough composer or performer can make freshness ooze out of any tuning.Or even out of a single tone via creative phrasing and attack patterns (African drummers anyone?)<br/>      For us who are only semi-gifted though...one particularly easy way to get inspiration toward making something fresh seems obvious: experiment with new tunings (especially intervals distinguishably different than 12TET).  To me it functions much like arrangement and choosing what types of timbre to use in an electronica piece: it can freshen and sometime completely change the mood of a tune.  I certainly don&apos;t go around saying &quot;oh that must be boring b/c it&apos;s in 12TET&quot;...but if I see someone&apos;s using a scale with completely new chords that does not seem to mathematically imply out of control dissonance, it does lead me to think &quot;this probably sounds fresh...definitely for the sake of the scale used and perhaps for a lot more...I should at least check it out&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If his piano had been tuned in JI, I don&apos;t think it would have made any difference&quot;<br/>      True, if you mean JI with all steps approximating typical JI chords like 3:4:6.  But if he were allowed chords like 11:12:14...I&apos;m pretty sure there would be an extra bit of wow in the audience&apos;s reaction.  To me, tuning can&apos;t turn ok into great far as music...but it can at times turn good into great or great into otherworldly great.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You folks who worry about decimal points as applied to music might be<br/>better advised to learn how to convey those deep and profound emotional<br/>states...cause that&apos;s what music is all about, in the long run&quot;<br/>   Right...but what happens when you literally end up thinking the note between C and C#, say....would add just the right flavor to your chord to recreate the emotion you want?   Sure you can estimate to the nearest 12TET option...but, to me at least, micro-tonal will always be the icing on the cake.<br/>  Note though...I do think it&apos;s kind of ridiculous when people argue and ego-tize about things like is 3/2 or 74/49 a better ratio when they both sound almost exactly the same (this applies to meantone, certain types of JI, or just about any tuning within 13 cents or so of 12TET...mere hundredths of decimal points &quot;off&quot;).</p><p>-Michael</p><p>_,_._,___</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21829 href="#21829">ðŸ”—</a>ALOE@...</h3><span>2/20/2010 12:07:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 11:06 AM 2/9/10 -0700, Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   There are potentially an infinite number of ways to tune.</p><p>True, alongside an infinite number of color combinations.

That&apos;s a multiple of 1.025.  But while the color sounds distinct, it doesn&apos;t sound drastically different.  BTW, that just about matches the difference between two tones in 28TET.<br/>    However, to make the tone color sound signiificantly different (IE you can tell the difference without forcing yourself to listen for it)  I&apos;ve found you need around a 29/28 difference in tone...which amounts to a bit over a half a 12TET semitone difference (not too far from Arabic quarter tones).  To me eighth tones sound more like distorted/&quot;slightly bent&quot; quarter tones than new tonal colors.</p><p>   Granted...this &quot;test&quot; I did assumes the tones you are using are in the C5-C6 range.  Go to the C7 range and you may well be able to differentiate between smaller ratios...while in low ranges you may need larger ones for different color...just because the critical band of human hearing is curved.  But it should prove fairly valid for most melodies within the commonly used starting at C4 ending at C7 range.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
