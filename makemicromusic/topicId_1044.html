This was a small sample, meant to<br/>show some of things I&apos;m doing rather than how they could be done if my<br/>keyboard technique were more accurate and my familiarity more<br/>assured.</p><p>The last month has been a time of tragedy, violence, terror, and also<br/>of reflection, prayer, nonviolence, and a search for peace and trust.</p><p>Now it feels about the right time to share a few of these directions,<br/>and to thank those of you who have expressed the theme of peace in<br/>words and music.</p><p>As I mentioned around late August or early September, 13-tET really<br/>has me excited: it permits some beautiful progressions with a<br/>13th-14th century Western European flavor, when timbres are chosen to<br/>make the 8/13 octave interval (around 738 cents) a 3:2-like concord.</p><p>While many standard _progressions_ can apply, the usual interval<br/>arithmetic doesn&apos;t. If were to count in traditional European terms,<br/>then two &quot;fourths&quot; (5/13 octave, ~462 cents) would make an excellent<br/>&quot;major sixth,&quot; (10/13 octave, ~923 cents) while the same interval of<br/>5/13 octave might represent either a near-4:3 &quot;fourth&quot; or a &quot;large<br/>major third&quot; often expanding to a &quot;fifth.&quot;</p><p>I find it simplest to count scale steps, and let 13-tET have its own<br/>beautiful &quot;harmonic geometry&quot; and character.</p><p>Another really exciting tuning is George Secor&apos;s 17-tone<br/>well-temperament going back to 1978. It has nine closer fifths (Ab-B)<br/>at around 707.22 cents, and the other eight fifths at around 704.38<br/>cents, for some pure 11:7 or 14:11 ratios. There are also some<br/>near-pure 11:6 &quot;neutral sevenths,&quot; and more generally an abundance of<br/>neutral intervals, as well as lots of major and minor thirds fairly<br/>near 9:7 and 7:6, very nice as it happens for a &quot;neo-medieval&quot; style.</p><p>This is a tuning connected to a lot of history in our microtonal<br/>community. George Secor, together with Erv Wilson and Dick Harasek,<br/>developed the keyboard for the Generalized Keyboard Scalatron, an<br/>instrument which advanced the state of the art, and which, today, is<br/>still making beautiful music.</p><p>It&apos;s a tuning with immense potential for many kinds of music, with my<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; approach suggesting just one angle on this. I hope that<br/>it will become much better known in the coming months and years.</p><p>My timbral experiments with 13-tET led me to try a bit neo-Gothic and<br/>&quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; music in 23-tET, and I found that both styles could<br/>be pleasant. From John Chowning to Bill Sethares and Jacky Ligon,<br/>people have shown that concord/discord is often largely a matter of<br/>timbre, and my experience with these tunings maybe confirms this<br/>point.</p><p>There are other tunings that I want to get to, for example<br/>Sesquisexta, with two 12-note Pythagorean chains at a pure 7:6 apart.<br/>This has a keyboard layout like a lattice: play C-G on the lower<br/>keyboard and C-G on the upper keyboard at the same time, and you get a<br/>pure 12:14:18:21 (around 0-267-702-969 cents).</p><p>It&apos;s amazing what&apos;s out there, and thank you for all sharing with me<br/>in this community of music and friendship.</p><p>With peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=1082 href="#1082">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2001 1:25:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Robert Walker, and thank you for your encouragement and<br/>your many contributions here.</p><p>I should explain that what I need to do is to get that tape cassette<br/>out to someone who has very generously offered to lend assistance in<br/>making the material available in appropriate formats, of which I&apos;d<br/>certainly consider audio formats accessible via the Web a very<br/>important set.</p><p>These improvisations are by no means perfect, or even polished, but<br/>they do show a process in progress, and that&apos;s the point, most<br/>especially the point of this group.</p><p>Over the last month, I&apos;ve had some strange reactions, like: &quot;Might<br/>mailing an audio cassette somehow have security complications?&quot; For<br/>some time, there have been restrictions here on the sizes of envelopes<br/>that can be mailed without inspection, or the like -- but it affects<br/>large packages rather than tape cassettes, if I&apos;m correct, and going<br/>down to a post office if necessary to sure shouldn&apos;t be a problem<br/>either.</p><p>Psychologically, I feel a bit like maybe mailing out that cassette is<br/>&quot;returning to something more like normal,&quot; because finishing this set<br/>of improvisations (and one brief composition in 13-tET) was something<br/>I was celebrating just before September 11. This is maybe hard to<br/>explain, and thank you for offering such generous support (I say this<br/>to you, Robert, and everyone reading this).</p><p>At some point I need write notes on the pieces and tunings, but maybe<br/>I shouldn&apos;t take that as a precondition to mailing the cassette<br/>itself, since I can also mail or e-mail that information later.</p><p>Anyway, there&apos;s no reason why I shouldn&apos;t get that tape out, and with<br/>the help of a very generous person (one among many) make this music<br/>available for listening on the Web.</p><p>Thank you so much, Robert, for reminding me of this just at the point<br/>where overcoming a bit of inertia would be very helpful.</p><p>Most appreciatively, in peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=1083 href="#1083">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
