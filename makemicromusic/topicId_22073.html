Microtonal scales can be used with any<br/>style (and has been used with these three).  Partch was an interesting<br/>composer for his use of rhythm, lyrics and many other elements, of<br/>which microtonality was one.</p><p>There are also MANY different forms of microtonality.  The term<br/>simply means &apos;anything other than 12-tone equal temperament&apos; so you<br/>can imagine it includes everything from historical keyboard<br/>temperaments to crazy scales with hundreds of notes per octave, and<br/>even scales without any octaves at all.</p><p>If you use Finale, there are folks here who can tell you how to<br/>create microtonal accidental systems with it.  Then you can<br/>experiment and discover the scales that let you achieve your musical<br/>goals.  Then come back and share some of your music!</p><p>In particular, Rick McGowan, Torsten Anders, and Daniel Wolf are<br/>people who know about Finale&apos;s microtonal capabilities.

Similarly, just intonation sounds more in tune to most &quot;normal&quot;<br/>listeners here than 12 note equal temperament as long as you play in the key it is intended for.&quot;</p><p>    Agreed.  One thing I&apos;ve found about micro-tonality is that standard notation works fine when all notes are, say, within 15 cents or so of JI-perfect intervals.<br/>   On the other hand IMVHO, where it starts to get really interesting is when you are dealing with notes over 15 cents away from 12TET and yet the combination of notes/dyads causes them to &quot;feel&quot; normal and put each other into what feels like a familiar context.  And, in such cases, standard notation can be very deceiving as something my look very off key in standard notation, but indeed be on-key relative to, say, the last tone (which is likely also fairly far off key and perhaps transitions from a tone before that which is fairly &quot;on key&quot; relative to 12TET).  Hence tones can &quot;warp&quot; over frequency space and trying to analyze how well they follow the &quot;straight line&quot; of 12TET can make things more, and not less, confusing.</p><p>    Personal experience in micro-tonality tells me I can only trust a combination of math and tuning by ear.  If I use all math and try to force fitting to a framework (standard notation or otherwise), I often find myself creating scales that sound like what they are; tense and trying to be/imitate something they are not.  The only real &quot;frameworks&quot; I recommend following to some extent all the time are periodicity and critical band (the two main psycho-acoustic principles) and, on a more personal note, mirroring of tones (though that terminology is not widely accepted and is an experimental venture of mine).<br/>   An example with periodicity: any scale with a dyad interval with a fractional representation over about 18 IE x/18 or a numerator over 27 is likely to begin to sound sour.  An example with critical band: any two tones closer than the interval 13/12 are likely to sound sour...unless they are so close (IE under 10 cents apart) that they seem to blend into a single tone.  In part you can numerically analyze scales to see if they fit such conditions (diatonic JI has mostly dyads that fit in x/12 format and just one interval, the minor second, that is closer than 13/12).</p><p>    Whether my scales or others combine historic theories properly or fit JI very strictly is not of high relevance to good scales through my experience...what is, instead, is making scales you can actually just sit down and play without having to strain your mind to find the right math to make smooth-sounding chords and little to worry about concerning things like &quot;correct notation&quot;.  The best scales, IMVHO, are simply the easiest and most flexible to just pick up and play, the ones that resolve tonal conflicts themselves without the need for lots of theory on top to &quot;find the right/sweet chords&quot;.</p><p>_,_._,___</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2010 3:18:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The question was about microtonal COMPOSITION, not re-tuning.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Mark,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My experience is that to most &quot;normal&quot; listeners where I live (Southern<br/>&gt; &gt; England, United Kingdom) Quarter Comma Meantone sounds much more in tune<br/>&gt; &gt; than 12 note equal temperament, as long as don&apos;t use the 4 major chords it<br/>&gt; &gt; is not intended for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For some music it will, but for other music it will be worse than 12tet<br/>&gt; (atleast to my ears and understanding of tunings)<br/>&gt; You give an example with the 4 major chords allready, but I think there are<br/>&gt; many more chords etc that&apos;ll do the trick.<br/>&gt; And it&apos;s hard even to know if a piece will work or not beforehand as normal<br/>&gt; music theory is very inadequate for this purpose.<br/>&gt; You can simply say it&apos;s a piece written in C major and then expect it to<br/>&gt; work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But agreed, with (conservative) meantones, if you know what you&apos;re doing<br/>&gt; it&apos;ll sound better than 12tet most of the time, and not very offensive at<br/>&gt; the times it sounds worse than 12tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, just intonation sounds more in tune to most &quot;normal&quot; listeners<br/>&gt; &gt; here than 12 note equal temperament as long as you play in the key it is<br/>&gt; &gt; intended for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I must strongly dissagree with this.<br/>&gt; By far most pieces written in a certain key will not work at all with any<br/>&gt; fixed 12 tone just intonation tuning.<br/>&gt; Normal listeners ears will absolutely go &quot;eww that note sounds way out of<br/>&gt; tune&quot; very often when you do this.<br/>&gt; Take as an example the drei equale I&apos;ve been working on.

All of them can be used when music stream composed in<br/>tonal or extended tonal style needs it. All of them are nice. So what<br/>are you talking about? Your example is the most used one, so much<br/>used we can call it banal.<br/>Have you heard about Janacek&apos;s resolution when he was a student and<br/>wanted to provoke his teacher? He did &quot;G-B-D-F&quot; to &quot;Ab-Db-Db-F&quot;. This<br/>I call creativity. He was expelled of the school after this as his<br/>teacher was oversensitive and limited (how often these two features<br/>are found in one person), and maybe even angry that he didn&apos;t have<br/>enough creativity to find it himself and publish in his textbook. He<br/>couldn&apos;t imagine there are more ways how to resolve this chord.

Nor in the microtonality itself. Microtonal music can<br/>be implanted on the most various music styles.</p><p>&gt; Sure people can criticize them.<br/>&gt; But the way cameron criticized them came across to me as<br/>&gt; respectless and<br/>&gt; hostile.<br/>&gt; And made general statements (not &quot;I think&quot; but &quot;you ARE wrong&quot; etc).<br/>&gt; So then it&apos;s my right to criticize his reponse yes? ;)</p><p>If I see well, he just wrote your opinion is not true, which is of<br/>course true. Then he wrote &quot;it also reflects a deep non-understanding<br/>of music as an action, not a &quot;thing&quot;&quot; which is also true. I don&apos;t see<br/>any hostility or respectless attitude. Just a small advice: if you<br/>want to be respected, you must show deep and wide knowledge, and try<br/>to find something really new. And maybe write the names with the<br/>first character capitalised.</p><p>&gt; Btw you come across somewhat hostile to me too.<br/>&gt; Calling my approach and attitude to microtonality very limited the<br/>&gt; way you<br/>&gt; do.</p><p>It is limited. You are interested  only in retuning existing music,<br/>and what&apos;s worse - without a proper knowledge of what&apos;s behind that<br/>music historically. Just because you think all existing tonal music<br/>is out of tune, and only your way is THE way which with finally make<br/>order in that chaos. There are many other approaches to making real<br/>microtonal music.</p><p>&gt; I can say the same to you as I said to cameron...</p><p>Of course you can, but it&apos;s ridiculous. Any person can easily compare<br/>what I did and do in my life and what you did. And I don&apos;t mean<br/>finished formal education or such, no, just work done.

Another advice: listen carefully and with great respect<br/>advices and well meant opinions of more clever, more educated, more<br/>experienced colleagues, try to accept them, and maybe one day you can<br/>learn something from it.

I&apos;m going to pass on this one.<br/>Will only mention that the Drei Equale tuning competition is a good<br/>competition where people can vote for what&apos;s &quot;in tune&quot; to their ears.</p><p>&gt; Second, chords can be distuned, detuned.<br/>&gt; Contrast between tuned and detuned chords can be also one of the<br/>&gt; expressive means of (microtonal) music. It&apos;s not necessary to have<br/>&gt; all chords just tuned. Besides it&apos;s impossible to tune more complex<br/>&gt; chords, or chords with different structure than triadic in this way.</p><p>I see a difference between sound and the language of harmony / melody.<br/>To distune a unison is something in the area of a sound &quot;effect&quot;.</p><p>As for triadic structures, I&apos;ve explored this and beyond this in perfect<br/>consonant ways with permutations of the harmonic series.<br/>But I also think a chord like for instance 9/8 4/3 5/3 is perfectly in tune<br/>in the proper places.<br/>So no, I&apos;m not limited or limiting &quot;in tune&quot; to simple chords at all.</p><p>&gt; Ah but I think there&apos;s a reason why for instance the dominant 7th can<br/>&gt; &gt; resolve so nicely to the tonic major etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; But too long a story to go into this deeply now.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know 22 ways how to resolve this chord to other triads, nothing to<br/>&gt; say about much more progressions to resolve them to the other, more<br/>&gt; complex chords. All of them can be used when music stream composed in<br/>&gt; tonal or extended tonal style needs it. All of them are nice. So what<br/>&gt; are you talking about? Your example is the most used one, so much<br/>&gt; used we can call it banal.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My point wasn&apos;t just that V7 to I is nice.<br/>But also for instance that V7 to many other chords isn&apos;t as nice as to I.</p><p>Have you heard about Janacek&apos;s resolution when he was a student and<br/>&gt; wanted to provoke his teacher? He did &quot;G-B-D-F&quot; to &quot;Ab-Db-Db-F&quot;. This<br/>&gt; I call creativity. He was expelled of the school after this as his<br/>&gt; teacher was oversensitive and limited (how often these two features<br/>&gt; are found in one person), and maybe even angry that he didn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; enough creativity to find it himself and publish in his textbook. He<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t imagine there are more ways how to resolve this chord. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; not without reason Janacek became one of the most original composers<br/>&gt; of all times.</p><p>You&apos;ve called me oversensitive and limited in you previous post.<br/>Are you comparing me to Janeck&apos;s teacher? :)</p><p>If I see well, he just wrote your opinion is not true, which is of<br/>&gt; course true.</p><p>Lol, no it isn&apos;t :)</p><p>&gt; Then he wrote &quot;it also reflects a deep non-understanding<br/>&gt; of music as an action, not a &quot;thing&quot;&quot; which is also true.</p><p>That one isn&apos;t either :)</p><p>It is limited.

For example chromatic 12tone system was known theoretically few thousand years ago but not in general use. And how will you explain such strange chromatic things like Ars subtilior, Italian chromatic madrigal in Rennaissance? We can find similar jumps and again regressions in using some parameters in music. And regressions in one parameter could be caused by progress in another parameter.  For example Neoclassicism was in certain sense return back, but it was birth of new esthetics. Or timbre music od 60ies was step back in the comparison with complexity of multiserialism of 50ies, but it helped to develop sonic aspect of music (BTW sonically it&apos;s not so far from prescribed overcomplexity of multiserialism to the chaotic randomness of aleatoric music).

It then<br/>&gt; developed towards the tuning compromise of 12edo to afford more note useage.<br/>&gt; So I don&apos;t see a problem to be solved.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I see many problems in tuning common practice music to JI.<br/>First problem is that the normal view of JI where all major triads are 1/1<br/>5/4 3/2 and all minor triads are 1/1 6/5 3/2 is a mathematical impossiblity.<br/>In large chords like 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8 9/4 8/3 10/3, there&apos;s no way possible<br/>to tune it with only perfect major and minor triads.<br/>Look at the 9/4 8/3 10/3 minor triad. When trying to make it a perfect minor<br/>by tuning 9/4 27/10 27/8 then you&apos;d get a 1/1 27/10 27/8 major triad, etc.<br/>This is the same problem as with chord progressions. Some people have<br/>thought the solution to this was to &quot;comma shift&quot; by for instance 81/80 a<br/>held note, or some adaptive JI method.<br/>But these solutions have a terrible sound to my ears, and they don&apos;t work<br/>with large chords as in my example above which is really the same problem.<br/>Then there are other solutions like extended JI, but it gives more problems<br/>than it solves etc and also doesn&apos;t sound good with common practice music.<br/>And then there are many other problems as to how to tune a certain chord or<br/>melody etc etc.<br/>Basically 95% of common practice music won&apos;t work in classic JI.<br/>And 12tet isn&apos;t how music works in my opinion and simply sounds bad.<br/>But I&apos;ve been working hard at finding real solution to tune common practice<br/>music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be great if you could explain your JI theory because I can&apos;t see<br/>&gt; how common practice theory is inadequate.<br/>&gt;<br/>As mostly explained above, common practice theory kind of works in 12tet but<br/>not in JI.<br/>My theory is too big to explain here.<br/>I&apos;ll put it on my website in time.<br/>But basically it is based on permutations of the harmonic series.<br/>Which will lead to all kinds of insights into chords.<br/>I can tell you the harmonic model of 6-limit harmonic permutation JI.<br/>It is 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 (when reduced to one<br/>octave)<br/>For normal tonal common practice music all chords will fit in this scale.<br/>The &quot;root&quot; of this scale moves in simple intervals, like 3/2, 6/5, 15/8.<br/>Melody comes from harmony but also indicates harmony.<br/>When a chord progression is such that melodies move parallel while retaining<br/>equal distance, the melodies stay in the same ratio to eachother.<br/>(though this is a tricky one, as a chord can invert and a melody can take<br/>over from another melody)<br/>For instance 1/1 5/4 3/2 -&gt; 1/1 4/3 8/5 -&gt; 1/1 3/2 9/5 and not 1/1 3/2 16/9.<br/>One has to read the music well though to make sure that it isn&apos;t indeed 1/1<br/>3/2 16/9 and it&apos;s some inversion with clumsy melody movement.<br/>For instance 4/3 15/8 9/4 -&gt; 5/4 5/3 2/1 is good.<br/>8/5 9/4 8/3 -&gt; 3/2 2/1 12/5 isn&apos;t. Notice the 32/27 between 9/4 and 8/3, and<br/>the 6/5 between 2/1 and 12/5.<br/>However, it&apos;s too simple to say it isn&apos;t good. It can happen for sure, but<br/>the melody would want to go from 8/3 to 3/1, not to 12/5, and 3/2 is octave<br/>equivalent to 3/1 so one could say that it does, and the 9/4 could be said<br/>to go to 12/5, then it is ok. But this inversion is a much more complex way<br/>to see it and if you look at the music it&apos;ll tell you which one of the 2 it<br/>is.<br/>Much much more to tell, and probably the above doesn&apos;t make much sense to<br/>you right now because of lack of info, etc.<br/>And I&apos;ll probably get some replies from some people telling me I&apos;m all<br/>ignorant and wrong :) But I don&apos;t care, here you have some of my findings<br/>atleast untill I publish more on my website :)</p><p>Marcel<br/><a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2010 6:38:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel&gt;&quot;Wild tunings for common practice music.

By turning down Marcus&apos;s music as in tune you seems to be, for example, indirectly saying Wilson&apos;s tuning theories (used to generate scales used in Marcus&apos;s music) are wrong.  And by turning down Ozan&apos;s music you seem to indirectly be saying Maqam&apos;s are wrong.  It&apos;s not to far a step to say that anything that&apos;s not very close to 12TET is &quot;wrong&quot; and that your theories (to the untrained ear) seem to go in a loop &quot;from 12TET almost back to 12TET&quot; in that sense.</p><p>   Granted, you have given some interesting examples of why chords do/don&apos;t work well in 12TET and different ways to purify them plus posted a very smart and fluent &quot;random chord progression generator&quot; program about half a year back.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But I cannot help but to hold the belief that there is ingerent logic to<br/>harmony and melody etc. And that it&apos;s &quot;true&quot; form is JI.&quot;</p><p>   The one thing I think we can both agree on is that periodicity between root tones and harmonics is a way to aid development of consonance and that JI is based much on that premise.</p><p>  It seems obvious to me though, that periodicity is only one issue in what makes scales which can be used to make music feel &quot;normal&quot; to most people and not the whole game.<br/>  What about critical band resolution?  What about difference tones?  What about symmetry between intervals?  What about sub harmonics?   These issues are not directly addressed/solved by JI and often to optimize such issues you have to compromise periodicity.<br/>    And, furthermore (even assuming JI along could solve virtually all issues regarding tonal purity), what about the fact JI (at least extended JI) can easily include chords like 10:11:12:13 which have intervals that don&apos;t exist in &quot;common practice&quot; music theory (yet, of course, are still JI)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I wish I could say &quot;hey people look here I&apos;ve found a way to tune common practice music in pure JI&quot;, and on the other hand say &quot;but all other tunings are pure too&quot;, but I can&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>    I take the position that JI isn&apos;t necessarily pure either.  Easy example: take the chord 12:13:14:15, which includes the pure minor second of 15/14.<br/>  Hear the critical band dissonance from tones being too close even within these &quot;pure&quot; intervals?   Even &quot;pure JI &quot; can sound dissonant, both by math and otherwise.  What combination of concepts exactly makes true &quot;purity&quot; I am unsure of...but I am very confident is a balance of many factors of which periodicity and JI is only one.  To me,saying JI is the solution is like saying a single tree composes the framework for the whole forest.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt;<br/>To: MakeMicroMusic@...m<br/>Sent: Sun, March 28, 2010 9:03:35 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Re: Microtonal music</p><p>Hi Michael,</p><p>I don&apos;t believe that for a second.

Although I would throw in<br/>that the stereotype of jazz as using 4:5:6:7 as the I chord is just a<br/>stereotype for the vast majority of jazz standards.</p><p>There is actually an interesting parallel between jazz and classical<br/>music in that sense. V chords or dominant chords in general tend to be<br/>more pentadic (or sometimes hexadic), as that&apos;s where people start<br/>screwing around with the octatonic scale, the altered scale, lydian<br/>dominant, etc. Some of these can roughly approximate other otonal<br/>harmonics of the root of the V chord: the #11 is sort of like 11/4,<br/>the natural 9 is like 9/4, the b9 and #9 are sort of like 17/8 and<br/>19/8 (although the b9 can be other things as well), and the b13<br/>sometimes sounds really good tuned as 13/4 (although it sometimes also<br/>functions rather diatonically as an 8/5).</p><p>Well, classical music is the same way. The basic structure is triadic,<br/>but dominant chords often tend to be tetradic. And the basic structure<br/>of the dominant 7 chord very roughly approximates 4:5:6:7.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what it reflects about western music that the V chord<br/>tends to be an even more enriched unison than the I chord, but that<br/>pattern seems to be all over the place.</p><p>&gt; Yeah, this kind of thing happens all the time. But it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; systematic yet. Probably consonant 3rds were occasionally heard<br/>&gt; in monasteries, I don&apos;t know.

The Burgundian school?</p><p>&gt; It seems likely, but honestly, I don&apos;t know how I would analyze a<br/>&gt; piece of music and say for sure. Maybe you should ping Paul and see<br/>&gt; if you two can figure it out.</p><p>We had a discussion about it on my facebook wall a while ago actually<br/>(<a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/MikeBattagliaMusic?v=feed&story_fbid=296159197506">http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/MikeBattagliaMusic?v=feed&story_fbid=296159197506</a>).</p><p>The basic idea was that<br/>- tritone substitution is basically the quintessential tempering out of 50/49<br/>- the tempering out of 64/63 is sort of reflected in the &quot;jazz&quot;<br/>incarnation of the 12-bar blues, as well as in chord progressions like<br/>||: Csus9 | C9 :||<br/>- equals pajara in jazz.</p><p>The duality between the dominant 7 chord as a very emotionally bright<br/>5-limit structure (possibly wanting to &quot;go somewhere&quot;) and the<br/>dominant 7 as a more complex and stable I chord (possibly well-tuned<br/>as 4:5:6:7) is a very prominent feature of the transition from the<br/>blues in its traditional sense towards the blues as used in later jazz<br/>compositions.</p><p>Monk, for example, tended to use the dom7 chord (and #11) more in an<br/>&quot;overtonal&quot; sense (albeit mistuned. and that&apos;s precisely the vibe he<br/>gave off, dirty overtones). For example, check out the strongly<br/>implied higher-limit chords he plays right at the beginning of<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfEddS41nM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfEddS41nM</a> (once they start talking<br/>about chords you can stop).</p><p>In contrast, post-bop composers tended to explore the dom7 chord more<br/>as a complex 5/7-limit structure - check out Freddie Hubbard&apos;s Arietis<br/>for an example of this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7r6qWuI1Wc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7r6qWuI1Wc</a> -<br/>you can sort of &quot;feel&quot; the m7 interval as consisting of 2 fourths,<br/>while at the same time sort of functioning as a stable I chord, thus<br/>implying a tempering out of 64/63.</p><p>Of course, meantone tendencies are very present in jazz as well,<br/>especially in &quot;jazz standards&quot; (many of which were influenced by<br/>Gershwin&apos;s ideas, think about that for a second). And the only<br/>possible 7-limit temperament containing both meantone and pajara is<br/>12tet (or some 12 note well temperament).</p><p>So at this point I view the entire 20th century as a systematic<br/>exploration of other sub-temperaments (or perhaps more properly,<br/>&quot;super-temperaments&quot;) existing within 12-tet besides meantone. In this<br/>context, generalized regular mapping would basically be the next step,<br/>as most of the obvious choices in 12-tet have been well-plowed through<br/>by now.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rhythm gets a bigger piece of the pie, and this necessarily means<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; there are fewer pitches that begin and end at the same time.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Parallel writing in jazz is less dense.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There is a strong parallel writing tradition in jazz as well, check<br/>&gt; &gt;out some of the instrumental big bands.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good point. As you know, I played trumpet in high school.</p><p>Ah, I didn&apos;t know that.

Of course Varese is exceptional in this, and also he inspired many European composers after WWW II. Another wave came in 60ies with timbre and aleatoric music, another one with &quot;world music&quot; inspiration before the end of 20th century, so I wouldn&apos;t say there&apos;s less drums and percussions in European classical contemporary music in comparison with American authors. Some composers like them (including me - in my orchestral works I always have at least 4 or more performers, in Double Concerto for pipe organ an percussions 7 performers with hundreds of instruments, some of them very special). There are many drum &amp; percussions ensembles in Europe playing only such music.

There is a rhyme and reason to your interpretation. It is a kind of &quot;extended JI&quot; and your notation describes it exactly.

I&apos;ve told myself I<br/>wasn&apos;t going to do it again, but yet it happened again.<br/>Sorry.<br/>(strange thing is I never lose my temper in real life.. I guess tuning gets<br/>to me in ways real life doesn&apos;t lol)</p><p>I unsubscribed for a few days from the lists but I read the following<br/>message from Cameron on the web interface:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve showed that perfect tuning makes perfect sense with a 9/8 4/3 &gt;5/3<br/>&gt; minor<br/>&gt; &gt; triad sometimes, and that this takes nothing away from the &gt;perfection.<br/>&gt; &gt; Infact it is part of the perfection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you see, that is just sticking the syntonic comma into a minor chord<br/>&gt; (the<br/>&gt; difference between 6/5 and 32/27 being 81/80). Nothing new there. Let&apos;s<br/>&gt; see...<br/>&gt; heh, it took me 30 seconds (literally) to find this approach even on the<br/>&gt; internet &quot;... the major sixth, or its inversion the minor third, is not an<br/>&gt; interval where distonation is very noticeable.&quot;, from an online article on<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of many approaches. It is not perfect, universal, or new. I agree with<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; that it can work very nicely.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I do think it&apos;s perfect, but I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s new.<br/>Btw I also think this wolf can be in the major chord, making a 1/1 5/4 40/27<br/>major.<br/>My method is not just about these chords but also about when they occur.<br/>I&apos;m glad you agree it can work nicely though :)</p><p>&gt;  You don&apos;t agree with yourself though- some time<br/>&gt; ago I made a Lasso example which was tuned exactly like yours except for a<br/>&gt; couple of tones, and you did not point out those chords: you simply<br/>&gt; dismissed<br/>&gt; the whole thing as &quot;out of tune&quot;. Of course I did this deliberately, and I<br/>&gt; think<br/>&gt; &quot;everyone&quot; noticed. LOL.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m sorry but I no longer have this version.<br/>So I can&apos;t say if I said out of tune in error, a few notes different can<br/>make a lot of difference though, and if I read your message correctly you<br/>yourself say it sounded &quot;out of tune&quot; aswell?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I tuned the Drei Equale in PURE PERFECT JI, and you can HEAR it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;correct<br/>&gt; &gt; and much better than 12tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your Drei Equali is mostly 5-limit triads, which sound lovely of course,<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; with sudden grating Pythagorean intervals in strange places. It would make<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; perfect example for someone who wanted to give a lecture &quot;Wolves and<br/>&gt; commas: why<br/>&gt; we use the 12-tET compromise&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>There are no Pythagorean intervals in my tuning. Except for 27/16 which I<br/>consider a normal 5-limit interval, there&apos;s never an 81/x or something like<br/>that.</p><p>&gt; Your approach works out to be exactly that of trying to force 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; 12-tET enharmonicity via ham-fisted 3-limit distortions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think you&apos;re crazy or deaf. There is a rhyme and reason to your<br/>&gt; interpretation. It is a kind of &quot;extended JI&quot; and your notation describes<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; exactly. For example you treat d minor as a kind of harmonic mode 10:9 from<br/>&gt; C,<br/>&gt; and you really do use 30:18, not 5:3, as &quot;A&quot;, etc., and I think you are<br/>&gt; completely consistent throughout.<br/>&gt;</p><p>First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to look at it, and see<br/>that it&apos;s consistent.<br/>As for D minor from C, I only wrote the JI ratios relevant to C (C as 1/1)<br/>to make it easy to read.<br/>Most people are used to seeing JI ratios with C as 1/1.</p><p>But.. I&apos;ve since done more thinking about which rules are at play in<br/>determining how a chord progression is tuned out of it&apos;s many many<br/>possiblities.<br/>One of the things that accepting wolfs does it gives a much greater number<br/>of possiblities for chord progressions, and I&apos;ve been fighting for a long<br/>time to find the rules that determine the right path through all of these<br/>possiblities.</p><p>Now here I agree a lot with what you just said.<br/>You mention the key d minor.<br/>I&apos;ve come to the realisation what importance the tonic makes in music (yet<br/>again, and better this time), and realised I allready had a tonal model.<br/>The Drei Equale I&apos;ve posted I&apos;ve now seen is almost correct in the key of G<br/>(with a couple of exceptions).<br/>So that means my old method is too prone too error, and I was yet again<br/>wrong with my interpretation (though it got real close to correct JI this<br/>time I think)<br/>I&apos;ve now rewritten the Drei Equale to be in the key of D. I have not yet had<br/>the time to render it, I&apos;ll do that tomorrow (for now I&apos;ve removed the old<br/>version).<br/>And I also have thought of another new trick to make the key audible I think<br/>everybody will like :)<br/>Oh and btw I&apos;ll also remove the Lasso example, as I&apos;m yet to check if that<br/>one&apos;ll change to when I look at the key.</p><p>A far far better approach, both historically and acoustically, is very<br/>&gt; obvious,<br/>&gt; but why bother showing it to you, when it is obvious that anything that is<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; identical (in result) to 5-limit+wolves you&apos;ll simply dismiss as &quot;out of<br/>&gt; tune&quot;.<br/>&gt; Sad, because Drei Equali happens to have an excellent example of something<br/>&gt; really cool, and very JI indeed.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh no, theoretically I can&apos;t see the Drei Equale work in higher than<br/>5-limit.<br/>But if someone makes a version that sounds correct, I&apos;m not rejecting it.<br/>I&apos;ll embrace it and will try to understand it.<br/>But right now I don&apos;t think it can be done, but please prove me wrong.<br/>It&apos;s for a large part what the whole competition is about.</p><p>On 2 April 2010 12:29, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Okay, quick and dirty (watching Star Trek on mute, with<br/>&gt; subtitles :-) ) apologies sloppiness and for my &quot;bom-bom&quot; tromboney kind of<br/>&gt; sound, LOL.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; measures 1-21 of Drei Equali, 7-limit Just.

There are too many goofy note movements<br/>&gt; of which I am sure the maestro LVB would not approve.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, to listen to individual voices solo is a good listening aid.<br/>I do it myself to.</p><p>Btw, I can give you some easy advice as to how to get rid of all except one<br/>of the wolfs.<br/>Chords 5 - 15, and 61 - 71 are basically the same structure as chords 33 -<br/>43.<br/>You can go low or high with these chords.<br/>To go low without wolfs simply make chord 8:: 10/9 16/9 20/9, and chord 9:<br/>32/27 (and then likely also drop the following 7th in the high melody to<br/>64/27 too), same for chords 61-71 offcourse.<br/>And for chords 33 - 43 drop the 3/2 to 40/27 in chord 41, and in chord 45<br/>make 64/27.<br/>And chord 96, make it 8/9.<br/>Now all wolfs are gone except the one at chord 50, which you can&apos;t get rid<br/>of in prime-5-limit without either a comma shifting melody, or by creating<br/>another wolf.<br/>As for the above version without wolfs (except one) I don&apos;t like how it<br/>sounds, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an improvement over my version at all.</p><p>There&apos;s one other way to do it in prime-5-limit without wolfs.<br/>That is to go high.<br/>I used to go high myself when I didn&apos;t have my theory finished enough to<br/>tell me how to go.<br/>To go high go to 27/10 in chord 7, then a simple I-V-I on 9/5, then 12/5<br/>27/10 3/1 in chords 16-18, and then the way it is allready again.<br/>One can do the same sort of thing in chords 33-43, go high, resulting in<br/>9/10 in the bass before the diminished 7th chord.<br/>Petr Parizek did a good wolfless (one comma shift) version this way which is<br/>pretty good.<br/>But overall I like the high wolfless version less than the low version<br/>without wolfs.</p><p>As for 7-limit.<br/>Well, I don&apos;t think a 7-limit can sound as right in this song as my 6-limit<br/>tonal-ji version.<br/>And where the possibilities are pretty limited in prime-5-limit without<br/>wolfs, the possibilities are almost endless when going to 7-limit.<br/>I wish you good luck with this, as it&apos;ll be impossible to try out all<br/>possiblities. I can&apos;t give any advice here.<br/>My advice will be limited in any case I&apos;m afraid, as I personally think my<br/>tonal-ji version is correct in a certain absolute sense (but I do not expect<br/>other people to think so too btw ;) so if you think you can improve it go<br/>ahead)</p><p>I did just do a 7-limit version for fun.<br/>I&apos;ll quote from my own post on the tuning list:</p><p>&quot;<br/>Just for fun I did a little experiment with the drei equale no1.<br/>I interpreted the chords and their position to the root alternatively (in a<br/>crazy and wrong way), to give 7-limit music.<br/>I&apos;m NOT saying this is what it was ment to be (as it clearly isn&apos;t) or<br/>anything like that.<br/>And I just did it quickly, and the second half and especially the ending<br/>aren&apos;t logical at all even in the crazy interpretation way I should&apos;ve done<br/>them differently but not putting the time in now.<br/>But anyhow, again just for fun, here it is:</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%287-limit_test_19-04-2010%29.mid">http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%287-limit_test_19-04-2010%29.mid</a></p><p>I think people here will enjoy it :)<br/>Strong 7-limit chords.<br/>&quot;</p><p>Happy retuning :)<br/>Marcel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
