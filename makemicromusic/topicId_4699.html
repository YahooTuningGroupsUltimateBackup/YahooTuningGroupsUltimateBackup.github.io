FTS is also able to call Lame<br/>to do it itself.</p><p>For instruments I usually use Giga, or the FM7 or the SB Live! Add a little reverb<br/>using the SB Live to give a feeling of atmosphere / location to it.</p><p>When improvising, just improvise in FTS and record to midi - then if I want waveform audio,<br/>play the midi file back using the same setup as I had when improvising,<br/>and record it to waveform audio.</p><p>Can&apos;t think of anything else to say right now - unless anyone wants to know<br/>details of something.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
