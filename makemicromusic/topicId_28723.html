This composition was created per a request in the<br/>Xenharmonic Alliance as a response to my piece in 32 edo tuning. This is my<br/>first piece in 25 EDO which is an interesting tuning. My approach to the<br/>composition was to develop melodic material first and then fill out the<br/>harmonies. After about half way through I started writing both together<br/>though there is application of some contrapuntal techniques like imitation.<br/>The score is also<br/>available.&lt;<a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/25edo/fantasy_for_piano_in_25_edo%20.pdf">http://micro.soonlabel.com/25edo/fantasy_for_piano_in_25_edo%20.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=2377">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=2377</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
