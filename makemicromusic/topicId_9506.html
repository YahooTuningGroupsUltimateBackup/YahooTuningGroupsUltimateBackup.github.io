It&apos;s basically a vocalise<br/>with electronics in Blackjack.</p><p>There&apos;s also other great music by the &quot;Electric Music Collective&quot;<br/>which consists of Timothy Polashek, Douglas Geers, &quot;our own&quot;<br/>Christopher Bailey and Marcus Alessi Bittencourt.</p><p>There are several *live* instruments on this program, in addition to<br/>the soprano for my piece, including violin, ring-modulated piano,<br/>voice and saxophone.</p><p>From the program notes, it sounds as though these pieces will be<br/>quite varied, exploring many new microtonal approaches to interaction<br/>between live performers and electronics.</p><p>Don&apos;t miss it!  Should be a great time.  See you there!</p><p>Here&apos;s a bit more from the AFMM website:</p><p><a href="http://www.afmm.org/noframeix.php?rurl=microfest2005.html">http://www.afmm.org/noframeix.php?rurl=microfest2005.html</a></p><p>Concert II: Friday April 8th</p><p>Friday April 8th is a presentation of the Electric Music Collective<br/>and features combinations of electronic and acoustic settings.<br/>Timothy Polashek opens the evening with polymicrotonal computer<br/>generations of HOT-TEMPERED ARPEGGIOS. Marcus Alessi Bittencourt<br/>introduces BATHYSCAPHE for piano and live electronics. Christopher<br/>Bailey is represented by two works, OOOGAAH: DUNGEONY SPECIMEN<br/>SPACESHIP for computer-generated sound and samples, with scales and<br/>tunings based on spectral analyses, and MGESAHRED EFFLEWD BQNOUSSK in<br/>23-limit Just Intonation for baritone saxophonist Matthew Polashek<br/>and the composer at the piano.
