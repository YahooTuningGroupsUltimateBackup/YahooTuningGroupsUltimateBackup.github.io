Bartok insisted on first solving the musical problems and then the pianistic ones. In fact, he was not deeply interested in pianistic problems. He had a natural technique and although he was recognized in time as a virtuoso, virtuoso problems did not interest him.&quot;</p><p>   Nice...this is kinda how I feel about composing with various tuning systems...I seem to hear musical ideas I want to explore, and then I&apos;ll find a way to integrate the system that expresses what I&apos;m hearing. The tuning figures in, for sure, but it&apos;s not the primary issue for me...the creation of the music is foremost.  Also...there are countless ways to use any one system, especially the ones with more options (good 3rds/5ths/etc). If we think of the astonishing amount of music written in 12 eq, from Bach to Hank Williams, what are the possibilities for 19, 31, Pure tunings of various types, whatever? Limitless...best from Denver...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
