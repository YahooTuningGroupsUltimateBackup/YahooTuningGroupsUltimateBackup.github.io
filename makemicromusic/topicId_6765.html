In June, 2004, two concerts featuring major,<br/>large-scale works of Sorabji will take place at Merkin Concert Hall in<br/>Manhattan.</p><p>On June 20th at 4pm, Jonathan Powell will perform Sorabji&apos;s most famous<br/>work, Opus Clavicembalisticum. In the past few years, Mr Powell has<br/>established himself as one of the major champions of Sorabji&apos;s music. His<br/>&quot;First Sorabji Series&quot; in London included a number of major works, including<br/>the Concerto per Suonare da me Solo, the 4th Piano Sonata, &quot;Villa Tasca&quot;,<br/>&quot;Passeggiata veneziana&quot; and Toccata No. 1, all of which he has recorded for<br/>Altarus Records. The first three CDs are available now, the next will be<br/>released in mid-2004, and two more will follow later in 2004.</p><p>Opus Clavicembalisticum stands a little apart from the predominant trends of<br/>Sorabji&apos;s compositional career, while including many of the forms and styles<br/>that he particularly espoused (Passacaglia, Theme and Variations, Fugue). A<br/>fugue sequence, admittedly indebted to the example of Busoni&apos;s great<br/>Fantasia contrappuntistica, O.C. is tightly organised in a multiple-movement<br/>structure of a kind not typical of Sorabji&apos;s large-scale works. A remarkable<br/>feature of O.C., in common with the other extended works of Sorabji that<br/>have so far been performed, is the degree to which it grips listeners,<br/>whether they be newcomers to the composer&apos;s music or long time enthusiasts.<br/>This despite its unusual timescale (for a solo piano work), of substantially<br/>more than 4 hours. Apparently paradoxically, many listeners have commented<br/>that the work seems dramatically compressed, and that the passage of time is<br/>irrelevant.</p><p>Mr Powell performed Opus Clavicembalisticum in September at London&apos;s Purcell<br/>Room, South Bank Centre, to a packed audience which afforded him an<br/>enthusiastic standing ovation at the end. He has plans to perform it on a<br/>number of occasions in the UK and USA in 2004 and 2005.</p><p>See concert flyer:<br/><a href="http://www.altarusrecords.com/ConcertflyersJune%2004.html">http://www.altarusrecords.com/ConcertflyersJune%2004.html</a></p><p>On June 17th at 8pm, Donna Amato will give the world premi&egrave;re of Sorabji&apos;s<br/>Piano Symphony No. 5. The shortest of his symphonies for solo piano, this<br/>piece nevertheless weighs in at an impressive 2 hours or more. A major work<br/>of Sorabji&apos;s later years (composed in 1973), the 5th Piano Symphony is<br/>divided into movements which include many of the composer&apos;s trademark forms:<br/>an extended &apos;tropical nocturne&apos; slow movement, two fast toccata-like<br/>movements, a fully worked fugue leading to an immense coda stretta (followed<br/>by an unexpected epilogue which heightens the tension already established by<br/>the fugue), all preceded by the familiar expository first movement in vastly<br/>expanded sonata form which (as it turns out, now that the large-scale works<br/>are beginning to become more familiar) is typical of Sorabji&apos;s symphonic and<br/>sonata structures of his mature career.</p><p>Donna Amato has made a special study of Sorabji&apos;s music, and has performed<br/>and recorded a number of world premi&egrave;res to great public and critical<br/>acclaim. In March, 2003 she gave the world premi&egrave;re of Sorabji&apos;s 5th Piano<br/>Concerto, with the Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ed<br/>Spanjaard. The concert was broadcast on Netherlands Public Radio. Her<br/>recording of shorter solo piano works of Sorabji (Altarus AIR-CD-9025) makes<br/>an ideal introduction to the composer&apos;s music for listeners unfamiliar with<br/>his highly individual style, and affords an opportunity to hear a selection<br/>of his most accessible works, played with the requisite effortless<br/>virtuosity. She has also recorded other works of Sorabji, Alistair Hinton,<br/>Edward MacDowell, Ethelbert and Arthur Nevin and Ronald Stevenson (for<br/>Altarus) and Dutilleux, Balakirev and MacDowell (for Olympia).</p><p>See concert flyer.</p><p>(for music techies:<br/>Reinier Van Houdt in the Canadian new music mag &quot;Musicworks&quot; says the<br/>following about Sorabji &quot;Horizontal juxtapositions of 8 to 12 pitches may<br/>span more than 3 octaves and often seem pasted together from fragments of<br/>common scales. (Reiterated juxtapositions within an octave, suggestive of<br/>common scales, rarely exist.) Busoni-like vertical juxtapositions of pitches<br/>create open-ended branching chains of random inner harmonies, as though by a<br/>process of fractal arborescence.)</p></div>
