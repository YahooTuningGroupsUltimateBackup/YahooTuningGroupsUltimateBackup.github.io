Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 6:57:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Kraig and Robert, and thank you both very warmly for<br/>your comments on my automated counterpoint example -- which, of<br/>course, grew out of your post, Kraig, with a bit of inspiration from<br/>your CD, also, Robert, to keep Sesquisexta &quot;on the radar screen,&quot; to<br/>use a curious expression.</p><p>Kraig, your idea of parallel sonorities with fifths and minor<br/>sevenths, like D-A-C or G-D-F, led me to do a MIDI example of this in<br/>Sesquisexta, where these minor seventh sonorities are a just 4:6:7,<br/>using the same chantlike melody as in the last example:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/seskg002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/seskg002.mid</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the Sesquisexta notation for this three-voice style:</p><p>A4  B}4  D}5  E}5  D}5  C}5  B}4  A}4  G}4  A4<br/>A4  B4   D5   E5   D5   C5   B4   A4   G4   A4<br/>D4  E4   G4   A4   G4   F4   E4   D4   C4   D4</p><p>In this notation, a curly brace } shows a note on the upper keyboard,<br/>raised by a pure 7:6 (in theory -- actual tuning tables involve some<br/>approximations). At cadences, the outer 7:4 seventh very nicely<br/>contracts to a fifth, and the upper 7:6 third to a unison.</p><p>Your three-voice parallels happen to be a subset of a four-voice<br/>texture I have often used in Sesquisexta, with parallel 12:14:18:21<br/>sonorities -- 7:6 third, 3:2 fifth, and 7:4 seventh above the lowest<br/>voice, and with a 9:7 major third between the middle voices. To use<br/>one popular terminology, these thirds are actually subminor/supramajor<br/>or septimal thirds -- although they&apos;re often so much the norm for me<br/>that I just call them major and minor.</p><p>Before giving the four-voice version, please let me say that I really<br/>like the flavor of yours, a bit different, and in some tunings easier<br/>to improvise on keyboard. There&apos;s a bit more emphasis with 4:6:7 or<br/>the like on that seventh, while 12:14:18:21 has more on the thirds.<br/>Either sounds &quot;way cool&quot; and jazzy to me.</p><p>Here&apos;s a four-voice version:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/seskg003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/seskg003.mid</a></p><p>along with the Sesquisexta notation:</p><p>A4  B}4  D}5  D}5  D}5  C}5  B}4  A}4  G}4  A4<br/>A4  B4   D5   E5   D5   C5   B4   A4   G4   A4<br/>D4  E}4  G}4  A}4  G}4  F}4  E}4  D}4  C}4  D4<br/>D4  E4   G4   A4   G4   F4   E4   D4   C4   D4</p><p>This is identical to the 4:6:7 version, except that the next to lowest<br/>voice is added in parallel fifths below the highest voice, and in<br/>parallel 7:6 minor thirds above the lowest voice except at cadences<br/>where this third resolves to a unison.</p><p>On a Sesquisexta keyboard, this is very easy to play: for the parallel<br/>passages, play the same set of parallel fifths in visual &quot;unison&quot; on<br/>the two manuals. Kraig, for your parallel 4:6:7 sonorities, it&apos;s just<br/>a question of playing in fifths on the lower manual, and the upper<br/>note of these fifths in visual unison on the upper manual.</p><p>With your inspiration, Kraig, I tried playing in parallel fifths and<br/>minor sevenths in George Secor&apos;s 17-tone well-temperament (17-WT as we<br/>call it) where the minor thirds and sevenths in the nearer keys or<br/>transposition are rather close to 7:6 and 7:4. I really like it there,<br/>also -- not quite so &quot;lush&quot; as 12:14:18:21, but with its own<br/>character, a bit more econonmic, and very pleasantly floating,<br/>announcing &quot;This is somewhere else.&quot;</p><p>Like you, I very much like &quot;time machine&quot; effects, and with either the<br/>(super)major sixth parallels I did the first time or either of these<br/>(sub)minor seventh textures, there&apos;s a neat connection.</p><p>When I played in Sesquisexta for the first time, I hit on four-voice<br/>parallels within maybe ten minutes, and felt that somehow it was very<br/>21st-century. At the same time, those 7-based intervals can nicely fit<br/>into a 14th-century kind of cadential ethos: the 7:4 very efficiently<br/>contracts to a fifth, and the 7:6 to a unison, while the 9:7 likewise<br/>expands to a fifth, and the 12:7 to an octave, and the 8:7 to a<br/>fourth.</p><p>Maybe this is a bit like 4:5:6:7 in a different kind of style:<br/>sometimes it&apos;s advocated because it&apos;s a &quot;just&quot; or &quot;consonant&quot; tuning,<br/>and sometimes because that 5:7 diminished fifth can very neatly<br/>resolve to a major third in an 18th-century European fashion.</p><p>One term I have for this kind of thing is &quot;streamlining&quot;: the sonority<br/>is smooth, and it resolves efficiently, also, when that&apos;s the pattern<br/>in a style of interest.</p><p>By the way, Kraig, you also mentioned parallel sonorities with fifth<br/>and major sixth above the lowest note -- I really like this kind of<br/>sound, and in Sesquisexta we get a pure 14:21:24 (pure 3:2, 12:7, and<br/>upper 8:7). In one naming approach, this would be a &quot;supermajor added<br/>sixth&quot; kind of sonority. I find that in various tunings, the effect is<br/>very vibrant.</p><p>Robert, now I need to get to my notes on your CD, and post some<br/>comments.</p><p>Thanks to you both for giving me an occasion to make a bit of music,<br/>and those parallel 4:6:7 sonorities are something that I can use in a<br/>range of tunings.</p><p>With peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p><p>P.S. Joe, thank you for your encouragement, and I should explain that<br/>these quick examples are rather like examples from a treatise -- they show<br/>the basic technique, but indeed invite expansion into larger pieces. What<br/>I really need to do, speaking of &quot;play,&quot; is to record an improvisation in<br/>Sesquisexta and make it available here -- as Jacky so helpfully assisted<br/>me in doing with some 13-tET (or 13-EDO) improvisations. I&apos;d love to hear<br/>some of your Blackjack pieces -- I have the means to generate MIDI files<br/>with Scala, and to proofread the output in an ASCII translation (a bit<br/>like checking a score), but not to listen to them.</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 7:47:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; P.S.
