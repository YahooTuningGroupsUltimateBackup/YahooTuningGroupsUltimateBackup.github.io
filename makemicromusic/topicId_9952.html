As usual, there are MP3 and OGG versions for download, as well as the Csound orchestra/score.</p><p>From the web page: &quot;Pitches start at the perfect fifth and simultaneously glide up to the octave and down to tonic, and an everchanging chord emerges from the reinforced difference and summation tones.  A slowly changing ambient landscape of relative consonance and dissonance.&quot;</p><p>Comments are welcome.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>--<br/>Dave Seidel<br/> [blog] <a href="http://superluminal.com/dave/weblog">http://superluminal.com/dave/weblog</a><br/>[music] <a href="http://mysterybear.net">http://mysterybear.net</a></p></div>
