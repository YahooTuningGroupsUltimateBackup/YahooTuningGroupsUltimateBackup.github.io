Did you tune your<br/> keyboard and then noodle around to find something you liked, or did you<br/> have some theoretical basis for what you did?</p><p>Well, having played in 11 edo in Urbana last Saturday at Jacob and<br/>Andrew&apos;s  microtonal class class I knew I liked the sound of the minor<br/>6th, and the octave is of course a given. What I played with today was<br/>what worked melodically and what I found was that the whole tone scale<br/>as played on a &quot;rregular&quot; keyboard more or less worked.</p><p>Prior to the competition I decided on the instrumentation - organ,<br/>pizz. and arco strings, brass, and percussion. There is a core here of<br/>string, brass, and percussion I&apos;ve been using a lot.<br/>I played an organ (a combined 5 organs) section on my midi controller<br/>- but I decided I didn&apos;t like that and deleted it.</p><p>Then I wrote the opening percussion measure and then the 4 whole note<br/>chords for organ. The placement of the organ notes were a combination<br/>of what I heard in my mind and what the instrument sounded and making<br/>the appropriate adjustments. The melody came later after I felt the<br/>organ was too sparse. The opening arco string chord is simply the last<br/>organ chord held for 4 measures. The brass melody here was again<br/>written as an approximation of what I heard and then adjusted to what<br/>I liked. Then I wrote the pizz. strings part using a cut n paste and<br/>adding to what I had to build complexity. About this time I cheated<br/>and imported a midi percussion loop for the orchestral percussion<br/>which I subsequently modified and used in various forms in the score.</p><p>Now at this juncture I am hearing additions (such as more brass) to<br/>the music that exists and am working on extending it. At 1:40 I felt<br/>the need for a break and wrote one. By 2:04 the exit to the piece is<br/>pretty apparent - I combine a number of motives from the other<br/>instruments in the percussion and then take that lock, stock, and<br/>barrel and plop that into the pizz. strings.</p><p>Is this type of information you are looking for?</p><p>The short of it is - I&apos;m following what I hear much more than any<br/>theoretical plan. Depending on the person I guess that could be seen<br/>as good or bad. I&apos;m trying to put down in the score what I hear in my<br/>head but I don&apos;t hear many specifics, I just feel - increase tension,<br/>decrease tension, add brass, change in texture needed - etc.</p><p>=&gt; Jake<br/>Also, did you use all the<br/> notes in the scale, or did you focus on a quasi-diatonic subset?</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure if you examined this in detail you&apos;d find I mostly use<br/>a subset - but strayed from it. It is how I write in 12 equal as well.<br/>However, trying to analyze a score that looks like 12 that is actually<br/>in 11 - or any other non-12 tuning - is a mind bending experience for<br/>me so I can&apos;t say for sure.</p></div><h3><a id=26761 href="#26761">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 9:06:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;christopherv&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;As a subject matter suitable for the strident music that my muse handed me I chose the serial killer &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer</a>&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Dahmer&lt;/a&gt;, a very scary person indeed who somehow got his own PBS cooking show.</p><p>Woo, scary stuff!
