The guy was a great player to start, and the sound<br/>&gt;was unbelievable...it was a transcendent  moment for me, I&apos;ll never forget<br/>&gt;it.</p><p>Though in some sense the organ was Bach&apos;s principle instrument (pun<br/>intended), he was also a master of the orchestra (Mass in Bmin, for<br/>example) and voice (cantatas and motets), the harpsichord (the WTC),<br/>of the cello and violin (unaccompanied works for those), and even of<br/>music for which no instrumentation is specified (Musical Offering and<br/>Art of the Fugue).</p><p>I think VoxBox is probably still selling the organ book stuff with<br/>Anthony Newman (recorded when he was a young man).  It&apos;s two volumes,<br/>two discs each.  To this day the definitive Bach organ recordings,<br/>and I picked them up for like $10 each in the mid &apos;90s.  Great for<br/>your next acid trip.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10487 href="#10487">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2005 12:41:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;And, I&apos;ve always liked &quot;Live-Evil&quot; cause it&apos;s very raw, not very<br/>&gt;polished...you can hear electronic hums from the amps at times, Keith<br/>&gt;Jarrett&apos;s keyboard had a bad key or two, and the solos are really exciting<br/>&gt;to me cause they sound so spontaneous, like the players are really coming up<br/>&gt;with stuff on the spot...which improvisation should always be, of course,<br/>&gt;but this session has an immediacy that I like a lot...talk about jam bands,<br/>&gt;this one is hard to best...best...HHH</p><p>This, I would like to hear!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10492 href="#10492">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2005 1:34:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Live-Evil is one of my favorite albums ever.
