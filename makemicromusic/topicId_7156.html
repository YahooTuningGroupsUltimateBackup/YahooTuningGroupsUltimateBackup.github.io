I posted this question on the tuning list, but since<br/>this list looks like it will be closing down soon :-(  I will go ahead and<br/>repeat my question(s) here.</p><p>I am interesting in having guitars refretted for various tunings such as 19edo,<br/>22edo, and lucy tuning.  I have already found one luthier who does this sort of<br/>work (in Massachusettes), and I have already sent him a guitar to modify for<br/>lucy tuning -- I sent him all of the necessary details.  I was just wondering<br/>if anybody else knows of other luthiers / guitar repair people who are capable<br/>of doing this sort of work.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be happy with the work from this one<br/>luthier, but it never hurts to know of other resources in case one person gets<br/>too busy to be able to do a refret for me.</p><p>Any ideas from people on this list?</p><p>Jay</p></div>
