I&apos;d also presume that having a supercomputer do it instead of what is on your desktop would cancel the &quot;just barely&quot;, so if you have a Cray X1 handy you should try it and report back.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2003 2:46:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;In his chapter in the Csound Book Smaragdis tells us that<br/>&gt;&quot;Modern computer hardware allows us just barely to reach<br/>&gt;the level of performance of modern synthesizers&quot;, and I<br/>&gt;presume he knows what he is talking about.</p><p>Yeah, funny enough, that is true.

I rendered a nine-minute piece by Pavan called &quot;Amber&quot; which took more than a day.
