Honestly I prefer hearing this to the retuned<br/>&gt; masterpieces of others.  Its real and its you.</p><p>Well said. Thats exactly what I meant to say.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham thanks for the link to Stina Nordenstom.  I always like<br/>&gt; hearing new female vocalists.  I wish she had some sound bytes on<br/>&gt; Amazon but I&apos;m going to trust your judgement and order away, along<br/>&gt; with some Terry Bozio stuff Jon recommended last week.</p><p>About Terry Bozzio.  I, as a &quot;drum-set artist&quot;, differ much from J.Z.&apos;s<br/>admiration of Terry B.</p><p>I have found him to be a pompous ass, hiding behind an unbeleivable amount<br/>of percussion &quot;baggage&quot;.</p><p>True, he is a technique phenomenon, but the tech. says ZILCH musically. I<br/>find his &quot;ostinatos&quot; tepid, and undeserving of the attention he gets for<br/>them. He plays a kit with something like twenty toms, four bass&apos;s and a<br/>billion cymbals. He still can&apos;t say as much as Vinnie Colaiuta, or Max<br/>Roach, Or Elvin Jones. I think he&apos;s severely over-rated as of recent. He has<br/>done some amazing work with Zappa, and Missing Persons. Oh well, I&apos;m a<br/>drummer. Rant rant rant.</p><p>Hear for yourself. As always.</p><p>GZ</p></div>
