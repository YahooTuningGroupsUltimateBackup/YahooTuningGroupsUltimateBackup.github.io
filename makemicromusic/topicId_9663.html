In addition to preserving<br/>&gt; ancient and rare forms of Balinese music and dance, the ensemble composes and<br/>&gt; performs new works. &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani is under the direction of I Dewa Putu Berata, an<br/>&gt; accomplished musician, composer, dancer and visual artist who excels in<br/>&gt; traditional Balinese genres as well as new forms of theatre and music.<br/>&gt;  &gt; The program, Odalan Bali (temple festival ceremony), includes ritual dances;<br/>&gt; Legong Gering; Barong; Truna Gandrung, in the popular kebyar style; and<br/>&gt; Rerejangan, a new work inspired by the communal sacred Rejang temple dances.<br/>&gt; The works are choreographed by the award-winning I Nyoman Cerita. New music<br/>&gt; has been composed by I Dewa Ketut Alit, one of Balis greatest young composers,<br/>&gt; as well as I Dewa Putu Berata and I Dewa Putu Rai. The program will open with<br/>&gt; ambient sounsdcapes by Wayne Vitale, the director of the California-based<br/>&gt; Gamelan Sekar Jaya.<br/>&gt;  &gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani comes from Pengosekan, a village well known for its community of<br/>&gt; painters, weavers and musicians. The ensemble was formed in 1997 by I Dewa<br/>&gt; Putu Berata (director), I Dewa Ketur Alit (artistic director), and I Dewa Putu<br/>&gt; Rai (music coordinator) and other dedicated artists as an alternative to the<br/>&gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;professional&iuml;&iquest;&half; groups that were performing for tourists. &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani maintains<br/>&gt; that the vitality of Balinese arts relies on the connection of performance to<br/>&gt; the religious and social life of the village. Many of the members have<br/>&gt; graduated from STSI, the degree-granting academy of music and dance in<br/>&gt; Denpasar. Senior members teach gamelan and dance to over 100 youth and<br/>&gt; children ranging in age form 5-18. &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani is one of the very few<br/>&gt; organizations in Bali that teaches young girls to play gamelan, a realm that<br/>&gt; was until recently, reserved for men.<br/>&gt;  &gt; &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani is a &iuml;&iquest;&half;Semarandana&iuml;&iquest;&half; ensemble, which is still rare in Bali; the group<br/>&gt; is at the forefront of work in this style.  The tuning system contains seven<br/>&gt; notes as opposed to five, thus allowing the group to perform pieces from<br/>&gt; Angkling, Smar Pegulingan and Gong Kebyar on the same set of instruments.<br/>&gt;  &gt; In 2000, the &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani childrens group was selected to represent Bali in the<br/>&gt; first National Childrens Performing Arts Festival in Jakarta. In 2001, the<br/>&gt; group received a grant from the Ford Foundation for its work in preservation,<br/>&gt; innovation and education. It made its U.S. debut at the World Festival of<br/>&gt; Sacred Music-Los Angeles in 2002. In 2003, it appeared in Greece as part of<br/>&gt; the Cultural Olympiad, appearing at the Kalamata Dance Festival and the Athens<br/>&gt; Festival at the Herodion (at the Acropolis).  The ensemble is currently<br/>&gt; touring the US and will appear at the World EXPO in Aichi, Japan this summer.<br/>&gt;  &gt; This tour of &iuml;&iquest;&half;udamani is made possible by a grant from the Mid Atlantic Arts<br/>&gt; Foundation in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts Regional<br/>&gt; Touring Program.<br/>&gt;  &gt; This program is made possible in part by the Asian Cultural Council and Meet<br/>&gt; The Composer (Global Connections Program). Funding for Global Connections is<br/>&gt; provided by the Ford Foundation.  Additional support is provided by the New<br/>&gt; York State Council on the Arts, a State agency.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
