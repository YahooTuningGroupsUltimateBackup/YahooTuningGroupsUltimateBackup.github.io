Besides being a porcupine temperament, 37-ET has excellent approximations of the 11th and 13th harmonics. It has a 12-note MOS of the passion temperament, which could be useful for converting ideas from 12-ET, and it also tempers out the W&iuml;&iquest;&half;rschmidt comma if that&apos;s at all useful.</p><p>I actually had a similar idea once; I wrote something with a meter of 21/16 back when I was 21. I wasn&apos;t yet doing anything with alternative tuning.

I think its pretty cool. It<br/>got me thinking that, perhaps, I could someday be known as an<br/>advocate of a temperament or two. Of course, that means that I would<br/>have to start advocating. I thought I would start today.</p><p>I think 29 is a lovely temperament. It has a fifth that is very close<br/>to just. This makes it an interesting tuning for experimenting with<br/>quintal harmonies. It also seems to have some interesting<br/>ambiguities. I have begun some sketches for a large scale work in<br/>this temperament, but I&apos;m afraid that it will be a long time before<br/>its finished.</p><p>I think my second favorite temperament is probably 26. It&apos;s not an<br/>especially consonant temperament, but its dissonances are intriguing<br/>to me. I just like the sound of them. I especially like some of its<br/>minor sounding modes. I&apos;m pretty far along on a large scale work for<br/>orchestra and hope to make a little piece available soon.</p><p>I enjoy many other tunings and temperaments, but I could happily<br/>spend the rest of life composing in these two.</p><p>Daniel Thompson<br/><a href="http://danielthompson.blogspot.com">http://danielthompson.blogspot.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=15924 href="#15924">ðŸ”—</a>J.Smith &#x3C;jsmith9624@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2007 10:38:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As far as temperaments go, I suppose you could call me an advocate for<br/>19-edo first and foremost, followed closely by 31-edo. I like 19 because<br/>of its simplicity and utilty, and I can certainly see it as the next<br/>most logical step up from 12. 31 would be my other choice of<br/>temperament, because of its meantone qualities and accurate<br/>approximations of 7/6 &amp; 7/4. (I&apos;ve got a certain fondness for 11 and 17,<br/>but not such that I would call myself an advocate on their behalf.)</p><p>Speaking personally, my only real objection to 31 and most other<br/>larger-than-12 temperaments is their difficulty of complete adaptation<br/>to keyboards (my major musical vice, unfortunately), not to mention<br/>other instruments. No real problem there with 17, 19 or even 24<br/>pitches-per-octave, tempered or otherwise -- but beyond that I see<br/>practical mechanical and manual problems.</p><p>I try very hard to compose music which has a real chance at being<br/>performed tomorrow by available (and un-complicated) acoustic<br/>instruments with a minimum of adaptive reconstruction, and not in some<br/>future period when our present orchestra is entirely replaced by<br/>astounding microtonal gizmos. (I&apos;m loath to see my music imprisoned<br/>inside a PC forever, or only performable by electronic substitutes.) On<br/>the other hand, there&apos;s little objection to using 12-24 pitch subsets of<br/>large-number temperaments, and it certainly makes more sense for<br/>practical applications.
