You&apos;ll see them change in<br/>FTS as they are sent - show the portamento / legato window<br/>again to watch the values as they change.</p><p>The midi controller numbers are:</p><p>Portamento on / off 65<br/>Portamento slide value 5</p><p>The on /off controller follows the Midi convention that any value<br/>of 64 or greater is on, so to switch portamento on you send<br/>midi controller 65 with value 127 say (or 64 often used)<br/>and to switch it off, send any value less than 64, e.g. 0, say.</p><p>The amount of the slide controls how quickly each note slides to the next.</p><p>The thing to watch out there is that you need to switch portamento on<br/>to use it - if you just set the slide time without switching it on as well,<br/>it will probably have no effect.</p><p>Your synths / soundcards also needs to support portamento - some don&apos;t have it.</p><p>Also you&apos;ll need to set that part to Mono mode, either by a midi controller<br/>message again (controller 126 to change to mono mode and 127 to go back<br/>to poly mode) or do it in fts from the portamento / legato<br/>dialog - that&apos;s because the portamento slide is done from the previously<br/>played note in the channel so if it has several notes played at once, or if<br/>they get retuned to other channels, the portamento effect gets confused<br/>- you still get the slides but probably not from the intended note<br/>- especially in FTS when you are also remapping the notes to other channels<br/>as well..</p><p>Alternatively, your sequencer may generate a glissando using pitch bends - if so<br/>FTS will relay that too, but when done that way you are limited to a slide<br/>of at most two tones if you are using the default pitch bend range of<br/>+- one tone, otherwise the note will need to be resounded in the middle of<br/>the note. You&apos;d do a two note slide by playing a note in the middle of<br/>the range and doing a linear sweep of the pitchfrom one tone below it to<br/>one tone above.</p><p>I&apos;ve no idea how it&apos;s done in Sibelius so you&apos;ll need to find out.<br/>In NoteWorthy Composer, which I use, you can set a portamento<br/>controller or a linear sweep pitch bend, and both work fine.</p><p>Tremulo is also a midi effect, so that could be played just by setting the<br/>controller again.</p><p>Parts | More | Modulation and Tremulo in FTS, and controller number 92 in your<br/>sequencer. Modulation is vibrato which can be a pitch bend vibrato, but<br/>can sometimes be a tremulo type vibrato too - vibrato on the flute is a tremulo<br/>effect usually, so ones flute voice may be set up to play a tremulo for<br/>modulation.</p><p>If you want marcatto and pizzicato, then you need a Midi sound bank with<br/>pizzicato or marcatto voices, and to switch the voice when you get to that<br/>point.</p><p>The Dan Dean solo strings for Giga use an ingenious method where you<br/>can play the strings within the range of the instrument normally,<br/>and change the style by playing a note below the natural range of the<br/>instrument, which lets one change the style without changing the<br/>patch. I used this in the last movement of my string quartet<br/>near the end to do a pizzicato section.</p><p>It was here:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/330/robert_inventor.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/330/robert_inventor.html</a></p><p>I&apos;ve just been trying to show it<br/>and keep getting an error message.
