And, you also said &quot;The burden is on you to show people who have encountered in their own music the limitations of JI.&quot; Actually, there is no burden on me to show anything...I stated my feelings about a certain aspect of tunings, and that&apos;s that. I&apos;m not trying to prove anything to anybody, and you don&apos;t have to prove anything to me, either. I&apos;m always open to other opinions about just about any subject, and as a lifetime student of music, there&apos;s always more to learn...and I study constantly. All any of us can do is try to be open minded and receptive to new ideas. The things I say about music/tunings arise from my practical experiences as a performing musician, and my ongoing quest to learn as much as I can. I think that&apos;s the best I can do...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=17318 href="#17318">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2007 9:00:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,<br/>&gt;but, in relation to how JI and Eq temps have been generally used<br/>&gt;throughout history, I said what I believe to be true.</p><p>And in terms of history/statistical occurrence, I agreed with you.  It<br/>is an undeniable statistical fact that composers in those styles have<br/>worked primarily (nearly exclusively) in 12-tone equal temp.</p><p>&gt;Actually, there is no burden on me to show anything...I stated my<br/>&gt;feelings about a certain aspect of tunings, and that&apos;s that.</p><p>Sorry.  I&apos;m a philosopher, I&apos;m used to dealing with language on a<br/>rigorous level.  So when someone says &quot;if one wants to play xxx style,<br/>you&apos;re going to be dealing with a temperament&quot;, I don&apos;t tend to read<br/>that as an expression of personal feeling, but as a generalization<br/>about the world.  When I see someone make a generalization about the<br/>world which happens to conflict with my own experience, my natural<br/>response (because I am an argumentative person...why else would I have<br/>spent 6 years of my life studying philosophy?) is to challenge that<br/>generalization.</p><p>However, I can&apos;t disagree with anyone&apos;s personal feelings, of course;<br/>that would be absurd.  And I wouldn&apos;t want to.  So if you&apos;re just<br/>stating your feelings, and not trying to claim anything substantive<br/>about JI, then that&apos;s that.  I&apos;ve got my own feelings about it too,<br/>and I think to a large extent they match your own.  I wish you&apos;d have<br/>said that earlier, though, would have saved me lots of keystrokes!</p></div>
