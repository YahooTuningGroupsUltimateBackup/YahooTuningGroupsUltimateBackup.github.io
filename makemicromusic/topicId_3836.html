Would be interested<br/>if anyone knows about others. I have also tried Wingroove<br/>and about Timidity - maybe I will mention those too<br/>- just happen to prefer Yamaha and Roland sounds. I know that<br/>some composers like Timidity too.</p><p>Also know of the Beatnik but not tried it out.</p><p>- and have Quicktime, but don&apos;t like that as much as the<br/>Yamaha + Roland either, not sure how you can<br/>relay midi notes to it either - here it just seems<br/>to work as a plug in for the web browser, but maybe<br/>there is some setting or check box I don&apos;t know about<br/>that will make it avaible to applications too.</p><p>Don&apos;t know of any others - plenty of soft synths<br/>but the GM ones are rather few and far between.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3837 href="#3837">ðŸ”—</a>electricwally77 &#x3C;earth7@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 6:35:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert</p><p>Thanks for testing and recommending a good softsynth for the windows<br/>2000 platform. FTS is an amazing product and I&apos;ve been looking for a<br/>good synth to work with your program for quite some time.</p><p>I will download the Roland SoftSynth and install the trial version<br/>for win2k.</p><p>How is the delay factor? Is there much of a lag time between when I<br/>actually hit a note and actually hear it?</p><p>Thanks for your support.</p><p>Regards<br/>Wally</p></div><h3><a id=3838 href="#3838">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 9:15:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Wally,</p><p>&gt; How is the delay factor? Is there much of a lag time between when I<br/>&gt; actually hit a note and actually hear it?</p><p>Yes, there is on my computer - but it is a 400 Mhz Celeron so getting<br/>a bit old now.</p><p>When playing the fractal tunes you can set the delay as high as you like<br/>but when playing from keyboard one needs to set it low and eventually<br/>you get artefacts when it is too low - I think gaps in the sound<br/>if I remember right.</p><p>Managed to set it low enough to be quite playable with a bit<br/>of delay in the action which one can get used to. I think it&apos;s a<br/>bit slower than the Yamaha in that respect (prob. should have<br/>said something about that in the review).</p><p>However, I think with a not much more recent computer it will<br/>probably have very little delay. I remember there was a<br/>dramatic difference for the FM7 when I tried it out<br/>on a more recent XP machine earlier this year<br/>- could set the delay right down to the minimum.<br/>So perhaps one could do the same with the Roland Sound Canvas<br/>- would be interested to hear what your findings<br/>are on that.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3840 href="#3840">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 9:42:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Just to correct what I said before about those many small peaks.</p><p>I&apos;ve found out that what caused it is that I&apos;d been doing the<br/>fft for repeated notes repeating every second for the percussive<br/>instruments to get enough data - of course the repetition period<br/>of once a second shows up in the FFT results along with all its<br/>overtones. This was easily demonstrated because when I changed<br/>the repetition rate, the positions of the peaks shifted t<br/>be closer or further apart.</p><p>Then for the non percussive instruments such as violin<br/>or oboe etc (which I did as single long contiuous<br/>notes for the entire sample) - then what it shows I&apos;m pretty sure<br/>are overtones of the vibrato frequency -<br/>because all those voices get recorded in the<br/>wave tables with a very slight but audible<br/>vibrato - that surely must show up in the<br/>results along with its overtones. It&apos;s not an<br/>artefact of the FFT as the positions of the peaks<br/>remain the same when you use larger time intervals.</p><p>Possibly none of them are actually to do with the<br/>actual timbre of the instrument.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
