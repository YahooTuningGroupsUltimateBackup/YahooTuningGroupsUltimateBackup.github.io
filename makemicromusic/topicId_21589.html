Although I am a composition student and have been composing music that contains microtones for some time, I still find myself new to using programmes for microtonal composition. It&apos;s difficult to compose without hearing how the result would sound, especially if one has devided the octave into 48 equal eighth-tones. I used Finale for a while, but with it one gets a kind of &quot;puls&quot; in the pitch with each pitch-bend, which is so disturbing.</p><p>So I want to ask if someone of you out of his/her experience could recommend some programme or combination of programmes that didn&apos;t have this problem and that could easily connect to a good sound library.</p><p>                               All the Best.<br/>                                 Shergo.</p></div><h3><a id=21597 href="#21597">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2009 8:44:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;shergodakouri&quot; &lt;shergodakouri@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello everybody!</p><p>How do!</p><p>&gt; I am very pleased to be here with you.

Maybe Timidity isn&apos;t your idea of  a &quot;good<br/>sound library&quot; but it handles the pitch bends cleanly.  I<br/>find the biggest problem with the combination is that the<br/>score is interpreted mechanically.  Given that it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter much how good the sounds are.</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=21598 href="#21598">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2009 8:54:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To shergodakouri and Graham Breed,</p><p>FWIW... Finale certainly can output to synths such as Big Tick&apos;s Rhino. Use MIDI Yoke to connect up. I use VAZ Modular as my VST engine and insert many channels of Rhino or other synths into it. Both of those VSTs handle &quot;.tun&quot; files for tuning; and Scala can make those .tun files for you.</p><p>The latest version of Garritan Personal Orchestra, which works with Finale 2009 and 2010, has built-in Scala support. So it is directly micro-tunable. It works much better than pitch bend, especially with the strings. (It has a drawback or two regarding instrumental range, but basically works.)</p><p>See also the slightly out of date:<br/><a href="http://azuma-asobi.com/FTS-HowTo/MicroOrchestra.html">http://azuma-asobi.com/FTS-HowTo/MicroOrchestra.html</a></p><p>Rick</p><p>-------------</p><p>Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;shergodakouri&quot; &lt;shergodakouri@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; Hello everybody!<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;<br/>&gt; How do!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; I am very pleased to be here with you.
