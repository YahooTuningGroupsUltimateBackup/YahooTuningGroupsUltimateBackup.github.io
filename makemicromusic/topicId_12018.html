Sample formats should not rely on the samples<br/>&gt;&gt; being<br/>&gt;&gt; actually in-tune, even to 12-tet. The sample *format* should store<br/>&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; actual nominal frequency of each sample, and the software that<br/>&gt;&gt; uses it<br/>&gt;&gt; should properly tune it as needed, with reference to the specified<br/>&gt;&gt; frequency. I think this is a big source of errors in existing<br/>&gt;&gt; sample sets,<br/>&gt;&gt; as Jon can probably attest. If you start with a slightly out-of-tune<br/>&gt;&gt; instrument, even by a small amount that&apos;s not really noticeable if<br/>&gt;&gt; used<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;straight&quot; in 12-tet it may sound *very* out of tune when you start<br/>&gt;&gt; modifying its frequency (resampling) for use with other scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sound Fonts have a field for the actual frequency.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=12026 href="#12026">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 3:34:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Charles,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;from the original jsz posting I had understood that he intended to generate the audio using C Sound</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&gt;or some other audio source, and that he was asking what pitches/tunings he should generate to be used as samples.</p><p>Nope. I referred only to Prent&apos;s use of samples *within* Csound, and mentioned the McGill University sample sets (these may or may not still be available). I know that Prent spent time, either in the code to implement them, or in resampling, to get them to the right pitches. I, myself, won&apos;t be using Csound, and have a need to create my own sample libraries. I&apos;m looking at ways that people have taken sample sets that exist (and which, for obvious reasons, are almost universally laid out in 12tet) and adapted them to their own use, much in the way that Rick is working out a scheme.</p><p>&gt;BTW I see that there is a new product KeyMap coming out soon from Redmatica to simplify the sample mapping process.</p><p>Hope that helps any of the Mac platform people out there...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
