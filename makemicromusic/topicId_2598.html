Now it appears even<br/>quicker than a Windows file box. On my home pc I measured a<br/>speed increase of about a factor 100 for the archive directory.<br/>It might not have the exact bells-and-whistle-set to satisfy<br/>Joseph, but it will give an info line when a file is selected<br/>of the common types like scales, keyboard mappings, midi files,<br/>etc. You can also have a preview in the main window without<br/>actually loading by pressing the Show button.<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@...</h3><span>6/20/2002 9:15:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve added MIDI relaying to Scala now. There are already a handful<br/>of programs that can do that, but I thought it would be practical<br/>to have it integrated in Scala. It&apos;s quite basic, monotimbral, and<br/>without the advanced features that Fractal Tune Smithy has. I have<br/>tested it with a MIDI keyboard and with loopbacked MIDI files.<br/>You can change the scale while it&apos;s relaying, like in FTS.<br/>The feature is in the Tools menu.<br/>Additionally, if you open the chromatic clavier, you can view the<br/>notes there. (Is that of use to anyone?) You can even use it<br/>simultaneously, playing a duet with MIDI keyboard and mouse. If<br/>you use a keyboard mapping, you can for example have quarter comma<br/>meantone on the keyboard, and 31-tET on the screen.</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2002 5:39:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Manuel,</p><p>Congratulations!</p><p>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>oljare &#x3C;oljare@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 2:44:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Any plans to support the Oasys tuning file format? /&Ouml;</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>6/22/2002 4:33:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Mats:<br/>&gt; &gt; Any plans to support the Oasys tuning file format? /&#xFFFD;</p><p>Jeff:<br/>&gt; Do you know where it is described?</p><p>In the archives for this group?
