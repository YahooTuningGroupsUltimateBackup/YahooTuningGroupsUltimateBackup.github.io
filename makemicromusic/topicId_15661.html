This is true even in Pop music. Anytime someone finds themselves too far in a new direction, others can be bewildered by what is in front of them. A good example of how one might be able to see such forces is in the case of Schoenberg, whose practice of atonal music he attempted to balance with some conventional forms, even when these forms might not serve him. I believe he did so to keep to both avoid being ahistorical and a desire to do work that was relevant to his tribe. Some of his earlier work, say the &apos;Five Pieces for Orchestra&apos; are more adventuresome in form than his later work, so it does not appear that he was just stuck with what he had inherited. On the other hand we can take a composer like Shostakovitch who was forced to use more conventional material and would push his forms to extremes. I am thinking of his fourth especially<br/>I read a fascinating quote of Bartok once  to the effect that he heard new music of his day as not a move away from emotions , but as finally being free from the few he thought Romanticism was stuck with. Finally composers were free to explore other subtler and emotions we probably have not the words for, maybe other languages do. But it seems in part that only some emotions might exist because of their occurrence in music. Even a composer like Cage i find will break new ground along these lines, even if not his concern. Artist do inadvertent things which is a whole other issue. Surely we can say things outside of that we are sad.</p><p>We live at a time where Art is considered irrelevant which makes those who  find themselves compelled to go further out requiring more courage to do so. Some others are naturally inclined to stay close to home and add little gems.<br/>Even a simple of a practitioner as Dylan has on occasion taken 1-1V-V and used it in a way where the tonic is IV. or LaMonte use of the blues adds something to that language both in elongating it progressions and introducing rhythmic ideas outside of what he grew up with.  I have a thing for Scott Walker who will take a Berman film, &quot;The Seventh Seal&apos; and make a song version of it, or the murder of Pasolini which he does as a love song to a young boy (who ends up killing him but it never happens in the song) , or not being addicted to Herion but being surrounded by those that are, and on top of this being a victim of abuse and having all the making of someone inclined to go this direction. One of the most talented younger composers i have met is obsessed with Britney Spears because of her arrangements, done by an arranger from India who worked in the pop music in that country. I really have never heard her (somehow) to comment but just mention it in the context that like a tree , branches can start to fill in in any space sunlight can get too.</p><p>There are many music makers who because of the time they live inherit situations in the overall language where while their work might not be what we call the best, it laid the groundwork for others to build upon.<br/>Here we are apart of one research and development dept and we should not be hard on ourselves if we do not solve all the problems we are confronted with.<br/>Take the first artist who used glass or did collage, they might try to use it like steel or paper and only by doing so do those or those who follow them can so easily see what it is that glass does.<br/>At least those after us will not have to retrace our steps far but will inherit it, only to be confronted with the dilemmas of their time.<br/> Daniel Wolf wrote:<br/>&gt;       &quot;microstick@...&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Why I&apos;m posting this here is because I hope that we who study, play, &gt; and compose non 12 tone music can aspire to create music where the soul &gt; of man never dies.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was going to let this ride, but reading through it twice and having &gt; read many posts from you over the years, I&apos;ve decided not to.
