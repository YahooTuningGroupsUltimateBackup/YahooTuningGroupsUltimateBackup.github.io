I used Scala to make a 31-tone &quot;scale&quot; base on LMY&apos;s &quot;The Base 9:7:4 Symmetry...&quot;, and then used this within Steven Yi&apos;s blue with Csound on the back end.</p><p>MP3 and Ogg versions are available on the page.

Naturally, getting wind and string instruments to play in 11-tet is a tall order, but the piece has lots of ostinati, repeated, and sustained notes, so it shouldn&apos;t be entirely out of the question. I&apos;m wondering if any list members play any of the instruments above, and if so, can you play a reasonable (accuracy + reliability) 11tet scale based on either c=523.3 or a=440?  [ i.e. c, db+9, d+18, eb+27, e+36, f+45, g-45, ab-36, a-27, bb-18, b-9 or a, bb+9, b+18, c+27, c#+36,  d+45, e-45, f-36, f#-27, g-18, g#-9]</p><p>Are any pitches or melodic intervals particularly difficult?</p><p>For clarinet, would it be better with an A or Bb instrument? (I can manage it on my Eb clarinet, but it&apos;s a simple system instrument, and the piece needs the lower range).</p><p>For the strings, does it help to tune the open strings to 11-tet pitches?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>DJW</p></div>
