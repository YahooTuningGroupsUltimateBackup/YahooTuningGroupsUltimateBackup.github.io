See<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers</a> and look for &quot;Chain of Flowers&quot;. A<br/>short description follows:</p><p>This is a piece that uses more material from the Partch Tonality<br/>Diamond. The title is taken from the web page of the Museum of<br/>Jurassic Technology, the work of David Wilson. Mr. Wilson recently<br/>won a MacArthur Foundation grant to continue the work of his museum.<br/>On his web page is a quote from Charles Willson Peale, &quot;...guided<br/>along as it were a chain of flowers into the mysteries of life.&quot; This<br/>refers to the technique of guiding visitors to a museum along a path<br/>towards what you want them to learn by entertaining them along the<br/>way, like a path of flowers. Mr. Peale&apos;s museum was one of the first<br/>American museums in the early 19th century. He would lead visitors<br/>from familiar objects toward the unfamiliar, sometimes horrific in<br/>his exhibits. I use a technique of repetition to highlight the unique<br/>sounds of the tonality diamond, kind of like a chain of flowers. Each<br/>flower is made up of petals, which are made up of smaller parts, and<br/>built into a complete structure. The musical material consists of<br/>chords and arpeggios using the otonality, moving to other chords by<br/>steps in the utonality. For example, if C major is 1:1, the chord for<br/>C major consists of 4:5:6:7:9:11, called C : E : G : A++ : D+ : F++<br/>in the score. This moves to an Ab major with the intervals<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11 as Ab : C : E-- : F# : Bb : D- . Then to F major as F :<br/>A- : C : D# : G : B- , then to D++, A#, and G-- major. This C major,<br/>Ab major, F major, D++ major, A# major, G-- major is the basis of the<br/>piece. I also use the sub-minor variant of each. I call the 6:7:9<br/>chord the sub-minor: G : A++ : D+ . Each of the major chords has a<br/>subminor complement. G complements C, E-- sub-minor complements Ab<br/>major, and so on. There is a great deal of indeterminacy in the<br/>piece. The specific chords in the key are chosen more or less at<br/>random, within a list of allowable choices. Limitations on the order<br/>of choice contribute to consistency. Sort of. A second version of the<br/>piece, realized a few minutes after this one, will also be available<br/>on this web site as soon as they approve it.</p><p>Set the Riff-mobile to &quot;Triademonium&quot;.</p><p>I use Csound to generate this piece. Samples were taken from the<br/>McGill University Master Samples CD-ROM. I created a program in<br/>Pascal that is kind of a macro pre-processor for the Csound input<br/>files. The preprocessor takes a text file as input and creates a .csd<br/>file that Csound processes. More details, including source code, is<br/>available on my web site at <a href="http://members.home.net/prodgers13/">http://members.home.net/prodgers13/</a> .</p><p>Descriptions of Mr. Wilson&apos;s Museum is at <a href="http://www.mjt.org/">http://www.mjt.org/</a> .

For<br/>discussions of the Csound program used to generate the piece, see<br/><a href="http://www.csounds.com/">http://www.csounds.com/</a> and other Csound sites found in Google.</p><p>I recently bought a CD burner, and have been hard at work creating<br/>high quality CD&apos;s of my latest 11 songs. 74 minutes long. All were<br/>made using Samples and Csound. I&apos;ll ship a copy off to the first 20<br/>who ask, no charge. Just promise me you will listen to some of the<br/>songs and place a note somewhere with what you thought of the music.<br/>Like maybe here, or the tuning group, or the New York Times....</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p><p>Home Page: <a href="http://home.attbi.com/~prodgers13/">http://home.attbi.com/~prodgers13/</a><br/>MP3 Examples: <a href="http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers</a></p><p>&quot;It&apos;s cold, but it&apos;s a damp cold.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=1362 href="#1362">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
