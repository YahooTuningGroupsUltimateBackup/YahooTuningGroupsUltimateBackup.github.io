A lot of this I got verbally from Patrick and<br/>others involved.  Unfortunately, I got there late and missed the<br/>demonstrations.</p><p>What they have now is two modified trumpets with an extra valve to give<br/>either 24- or 19- equal.  That valve is activated by a solenoid, because<br/>it was thought that the performer&apos;s little finger wouldn&apos;t be strong<br/>enough to control a valve directly or something like that.  They expect to<br/>have a complete brass quintet by the middle of this year.</p><p>They&apos;re also looking at wind instruments with a large number of holes or<br/>valves, so that the normal hand doesn&apos;t have enough fingers to control<br/>them.  Instead, there&apos;s be some kind of digital interface, and a computer<br/>decides which holes to block.  This can be used for new timbres as well as<br/>new tunings, depending on the software.  Some multiple of 12 tuning (not<br/>72, unfortunately) is planned, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s under construction.</p><p>And there are the 19-equal recorders.  I don&apos;t know who has them.  And a<br/>31-equal harpsichord I did see once but wasn&apos;t in working order last I was<br/>there.</p><p>In addition to these &quot;headline&quot; projects, some of the students are making<br/>alternatively fretted guitars, and on the tour I saw a monochord with JI<br/>and Pythagorean frets on it.  I saw a Wilson-style marimba on a previous<br/>visit as well.  That may have been Tony Salinas&apos; work; it was him who<br/>showed me it.  He&apos;s in Japan now, did post to the big list recently, and<br/>may be returning to LGU some time.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>2/28/2002 6:31:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;3C7D57A3.2B4AD61D@...&gt;<br/>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; This seems very practical! I appreciate the info on the latter, do you<br/>&gt; know<br/>&gt; if it was used and the response! With any slide one can put marks by<br/>&gt; attaching a rod which goes over a place where the player can see. I saw<br/>&gt; John<br/>&gt; Crawford (who worked with Partch on Delusion at least) with square organ<br/>&gt; pipes with a slide put inside. he added a part that went extended over<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; body so when you blew you could mark on the body where you wanted to<br/>&gt; slide<br/>&gt; to, or whatever.  It worked well, a talented man who you NY people have<br/>&gt; now!</p><p>You&apos;ll have to ask Patrick!  I only have this footnote.  It says the<br/>Firebird is &quot;no longer commercially available&quot; which suggests it was once.</p><p>&gt; I will have to remain skeptical as the mixture of spit and electronics<br/>&gt; seems<br/>&gt; like a big problem :-). It also seems it is going to drive the price up</p><p>I see you have a smiley, but this is really no more dangerous than a<br/>kettle.  The price may go up, but horns are already expensive whereas<br/>electronics are cheap and getting cheaper.  My solution is to use<br/>electronics for everything, but people keep on with their acoustic<br/>instruments.</p><p>&gt; I have looked into this deeper than given credit for as i have worked<br/>&gt; both<br/>&gt; with Trumpets and more recently  French horn, retuning the valves to<br/>&gt; different just ratios with good results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     It seems that Partch might have gain much by tuning his diamond to<br/>&gt; Bb or<br/>&gt; a related key, thereby being able to incorporate brass instruments. On<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; other hand the less western instruments the better his ensemble sounded</p><p>I don&apos;t see how you can get further west than California without falling<br/>in the ocean.  And I can&apos;t think of anything less appropriate than shiny,<br/>machined brass instruments to be on Partch&apos;s stage.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
