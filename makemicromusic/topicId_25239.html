Students of music who wonder &quot;Why these notes on the piano, and not some others?&quot; are all too often answered with &quot;Those are the only correct notesanything else is out of tune!&quot;</p><p>A world of more satisfying answers to this question unfolds to those looking for it: millennia-old traditions of music tuned differently; surprising inquiries &amp; insights into how we hear; proposals for new systems yet untried. This camp is for those who want to dream up and realize new, thoughtfully-tuned music and contexts which support it.</p><p>We use the term &apos;xenharmonic&apos; after microtonal pioneer Ivor Darreg, to refer to these unfamiliar-yet-hospitable musical terrains.  We use the term &apos;praxis&apos; after radical educator Paolo Freire, to refer to an ongoing dialectic between theory and practice, between action and reflection, each process informing and completing the other.</p><p>We envision a Xenharmonic Praxis Summer Camp where musicians from a variety of backgrounds converge and suspend the need for &quot;one true answer&quot; for long enough to get deep into a new, unpopular proposal; where distinct roles of audience, composer, theorist, performer, designer are inhabited temporarily, not reserved for experts or assumed as an identity.</p><p>-------- BASIC INFO --------</p><p>WHEN: July 25-August 5, 2011<br/>WHERE:  The Gesundheit!
