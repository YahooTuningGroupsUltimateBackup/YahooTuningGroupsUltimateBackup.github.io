And one reader wants you to sourceforge<br/>your pymidichaos code...</p><p>&quot;&quot;<br/>I&apos;d like to see the guy who was interviewed put his<br/>python program up on sourceforge... it&apos;s neat and small<br/>and could do with more exposure... currently, there are<br/>precisely 4 links on Google for it, and one&apos;s in the<br/>article and I haven&apos;t a clue what licence he&apos;s got for<br/>it as there&apos;s nothing mentioned in the actual code or<br/>anywhere... I really want to know what licence he plans<br/>to let us use it under before I start messing with<br/>it myself...<br/>&quot;&quot;</p><p>For all of you joining in, I interviewed Aaron for<br/>this piece, and discussed the creation of his microtonal<br/>music in the article.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
