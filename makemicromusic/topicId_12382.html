So I don&apos;t know that there evil comes into play when used<br/>that way.</p><p>I suppose I take a different stance then the critics at those sites..&nbsp; As an<br/>artist what I&apos;m trying to do is find a new way to relating to the market place<br/>in order to make a more avant guard type art form commercially viable.&nbsp; To do<br/>this I&apos;m going to use guerrilla business strategy and tactics empowered by<br/>new media tools.. &nbsp;</p><p>In many cases I see the major labels as more of an evil then iTunes.. it&apos;s<br/>the majors that are taking such a big&nbsp;chunk out of the recording income pie.. If<br/>I deal directly with iTunes, cutting out the label..&nbsp; I get a bigger piece of<br/>the pie..&nbsp; So I feel empowered by iTunes.&nbsp; I think it&apos;s entirely possible to<br/>make real art, find a way of distributing it, find an audience to sell it to /<br/>etc.. without dealing with the Major labels.. and i think the more artists<br/>find more ways of doing this.. the more things will change to the way we would<br/>probably all like things to be.</p><p>It&apos;s certainly true that if you buy music from iTunes you get compressed<br/>music..&nbsp; So I have never downloaded any music from the iTunes store..&nbsp; Because I<br/>care about that sort of thing..&nbsp; But the iPod is not about high def audio, it&apos;s<br/>about&nbsp;convenience and simplicity.. and that&apos;s what people are saying when<br/>they buy them and use them..</p><p>What I see as sort of evil about Apple has to do with branding strategy where<br/>we see, more and more, people building there identities via brand loyalty..&nbsp;<br/>When you become an iPod user you become a part of a kind of tribe...&nbsp; On some<br/>level this is just the sort of postmodern issue..&nbsp; Were we largely build our<br/>identities out of the raw material of popular culture..&nbsp; sort of doing a Warhol<br/>like, or Jeff Koons like..&nbsp;appropriation of it..&nbsp; I think of&nbsp;Reservoir&nbsp;Dogs<br/>and the conversation about&nbsp;Madonna&apos;s &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot;&nbsp; Or for that matter<br/>Slackers conversation about the&nbsp;Madonna&nbsp;pap-smear...</p><p>Other evils I see inside of Apple has to do with Apple using the power of<br/>there market position.. Instead of innovating.. An example of this can be seen in<br/>the platform wars where we now see the labels putting piracy protection on<br/>there CDs, because they want to be able to charge more for there music through<br/>iTunes..&nbsp; and so they are trying to leverage there position.. but the fans cry<br/>fowl.. and blah blah blah...&nbsp; Anyway I think the degree to which we see this<br/>happen.. is the degree to which we might see Apple (and others) going down<br/>hill..&nbsp; I say this because everything I see inside of the information revolution<br/>tells me that it&apos;s all about power defusion..&nbsp; which will, over time..<br/>fundamentally change the way the market operates..&nbsp;</p><p>So I guess I&apos;ll leave that at that..</p><p>On the issue of the&nbsp;Audibility in my podcast..&nbsp; I think there are a few<br/>things going on..</p><p>#1.&nbsp; I&apos;m trying to do a kind of Godardian thing.. In rethinking film and<br/>video syntax..&nbsp; Traditionally if you where scoring a film.. you&apos;d want the score<br/>to never be self conscious...&nbsp; Or to compete with other elements. In an early<br/>sequence in my video podcast I&apos;m talking about something.. While the music<br/>starts to build beneath..&nbsp; not yet in any way masking what I&apos;m saying.. but it<br/>does, clearly.. start to compete for your attention..&nbsp; In my sound work there is<br/>often more then one path you can follow through a composition..&nbsp; This making<br/>it a little... well Picasso or maybe Xenokis like..&nbsp; But what I think is sort<br/>of&nbsp;interesting about the video podcast is you feel like you&apos;re supposed to be<br/>paying attention to what I&apos;m saying.. but maybe you&apos;d rather listen to the<br/>music..&nbsp;</p><p>I want the cast to have a consumption pattern where you would listen to it<br/>multiple times.. In order to &quot;get everything&quot; and inside of that context.. The<br/>game of diverting your attention, it seems to me..&nbsp; means that there will be<br/>more reasons to come back to it for repeat viewing / listening.</p><p>#2.&nbsp; There are quite a few times where the music&nbsp;masks the dialog..&nbsp; My hope,<br/>at least, is that most of the time this happens with &quot;unessential dialog&quot;<br/>that is.. that you can still get the desired impact of the podcast without<br/>hearing everything.. It&apos;s a little bit like listening to some song where it might<br/>take you many listens to hear exactly what is going on in it.. What is being<br/>said..&nbsp; So at least some of the masking is intentional...&nbsp; and may not be<br/>problematic..&nbsp; From this perspective it&apos;s more a question of if the &quot;key parts&quot; are<br/>not masked..&nbsp;</p><p>#3.&nbsp; The video iPod is really the target platform for this podcast...&nbsp;<br/>Meaning that there is an expectation that the target audience is listening in<br/>stereo.. with ear buds on..&nbsp; And viewing it on that small screen..&nbsp; This way.. I<br/>don&apos;t have to worry about making it &quot;sound as good as possible on a many<br/>different systems as possible&quot; as much.. because I say &quot;I know what system they are<br/>viewing this in...&quot;&nbsp; From what testing I have done...&nbsp; It seems to be much<br/>easier to make out what&apos;s going on an iPod then when you look at / listen to it in<br/>other scenarios.</p><p>The reason this makes sense to me is..&nbsp; That the video podcast is a bit like<br/>an add for music to eventually be sold inside of iTunes.. &nbsp;</p><p>Now that said.. I am thinking that I&apos;d like to make it viewable on PDA&apos;s,<br/>Cell Phones.. and other such devices.. And I don&apos;t, in the long term, plan to<br/>only target &quot;the pod people.&quot;&nbsp; So this maybe an important issue to work out.</p><p>yeah.. it is surely a huge file.. 94 MB.&nbsp; I&apos;ve been trying to get it down<br/>smaller via MPEG compression.. to use that instead of the iPod&nbsp;proprietary<br/>format..&nbsp; But I have a slow computer.. and it takes a long time compress things down<br/>just to find out that it&apos;s too compressed or not compressed enough.. (I&apos;ve<br/>already waisted more then a full day on just this.) so I&apos;ll be working on this..<br/>and hopefully I can get something a little smaller..&nbsp; But I&apos;m afraid I tend<br/>to get easily married to the higher production value..&nbsp; But on a more positive<br/>note.. the podcast does go on for about 16 minutes..&nbsp; So it maybe wroth it..&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;I&apos;m planning on making future casts smaller in length.. in part because I&apos;m<br/>worried about the 94 MB being&nbsp;prohibitively large for some people.. Or at the<br/>very least it probably makes it.. not worth checking out.. for some..<br/>especially if you expect it to be nothing worth looking at in the first place.. Or you<br/>know.. that it&apos;s a gamble...&nbsp; The second reason why I want to make them<br/>smaller being that they will then take less time and effort to produce..&nbsp; And from<br/>what information I&apos;ve gotten.. It seems that frequency of posting new episodes<br/>is one of the biggest determining fact for audience size.</p><p>Anyways..&nbsp; I want to thank you for the feed back and stuff..

Bands like Clap Your<br/>Hands Say Yeah came out of nowhere but got covered by the indie<br/>blog scene.</p><p>And you don&apos;t need iTunes.  You can make a website with downloads<br/>and:</p><p>() Sell ads there.  Google makes it easy.<br/>() Take donations.  Amazon makes it easy.<br/>() Sell the downloads.  Your code generates a random filename<br/>for each payment (PayPal makes it easy).<br/>() If you want to be a dick, you can even add your own<br/>DRM.</p><p>This way, you&apos;d keep 100% of the dough.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying you shouldn&apos;t use iTunes too.  But to make your<br/>work only available through iTunes is to make it unavailable to<br/>people like me.</p><p>Also, you might be interested in Weed (aren&apos;t we all?)...<br/><a href="http://weedshare.com/">http://weedshare.com/</a><br/>...here, your fans help popularize your music, and get a kickback<br/>in the process.</p><p>And, are you doing video?  You can use sites like revver and<br/>youtube to make a buck.</p><p>&gt;#3.  The video iPod is really the target platform for this podcast...</p><p>You can also use vimeo, which lets you keep your files in<br/>m4v format (or whatever godforsaken format the iPod plays).</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
