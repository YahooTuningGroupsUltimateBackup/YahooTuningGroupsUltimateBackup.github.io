In fact, one area that I have done my own research and found it to be in conflict with your own is in the case of minor keys.</p><p>It is my conclusion that the search for a rooted minor triad that can be a tonic in a minor key is actually a wild goose-chase.  The minor chord can NEVER truly be a place of rest, and the only reason that minor keys &quot;work&quot; in common-practice music is because the authentic V-i cadence utilizes the harmonic minor, and the resolution melodically by the leading tone temporarily creates the illusion of being in a major key, &quot;hoodwinking&quot; the brain into accepting a minor tonic as a point of resolution.  No matter how you tune the third in a minor chord, it is entirely the 3/2 in the chord that &quot;roots&quot; it.  The only third that can actually enhance the rootedness of a triad is the 5/4 major third.  All other thirds weaken the rootedness on account of creating difference tones other than octaves of the fundamental.  19/16 leads to a 1/1-19/16-3/2 triad, which would be harmonics 16, 19, and 24, creating difference tones of 3 and 5, suggesting a 3, 5, 16, 19, 24 series, where only the 3 and the 24 are in octave relations with each other.  In other words, this emphasizes the fifth of the chord more strongly than the root, leaving the root frequency weak.  I do not see how, after all your years of research, you have not realized this.</p><p>Instead, I think you should remain with the two chains of 3/2s a 5/4 apart (well, actually, there is also the infinite chains of 2/1&apos;s going up and down from every note in each chain of 3/2s; we can&apos;t neglect the octave in musical geometry).  The proper minor tonic has to be related to a 1/1-5/4-3/2 triad; if we are in A minor, the relative major is C.  For C to have a 5/4 major third, the A must be tuned 1/1-6/5-3/2.  The major dominant implied by the harmonic minor should of course be tuned as a Pythagorean triad, so the proper JI minor scale (with the raised VII in parentheses) would be:</p><p>1/1-9/8-6/5-4/3-3/2-8/5-9/5(243/128)-2/1</p><p>Which of course only defines notes in relation to the tonic and can move and shift with the music functionally.  But in this tuning of the minor tonic it acts as harmonics 10, 12, and 15 of the relative major tonic, which (despite what some fools would have you believe) is the true tonic of any piece of minor-key music.

It is not rooted because it is 1/1 6/5 3/2 seen from the root. Indicating a 1/5 as it&apos;s true root. (making a major 7th chord)</p><p>The 1/1 19/16 3/2 is a rooted minor.<br/>You provided your own math already for this. The difference tones reinforce the root. It doesn&apos;t matter that the 5th harmonic is one of the difference tones, only good.<br/>Btw, I see the difference tones as less important than the &quot;beating&quot; / &quot;periodicity of the combined waveforms&quot;. We&apos;re not dealing with sines in actual music and the overtones of the actual tones create a wealthy combination of difference tones, which all interfere. And the most audible end result is the &quot;beating&quot; / &quot;synchronicity of the waves&quot;.<br/>The 19th harmonic gives a pretty strong 1 as it&apos;s &quot;beating root&quot;.<br/>Is the 19th harmonic as strong and clear a reinforcement of the root as the 5th or 3rd harmonic, no, but it&apos;s much better than 1215/1024 :)</p><p>2 reasons I had to reject the 19th harmonic in the past were that through error I had thought the 405/256 was also reinforcing the root and was combinational with 1215/1024. I see now this was wrong.<br/>The other reason was that I thought I could connect the 1215/1024 in several circle progressions with 5/4, I found I was wrong about this too. (the number of errors I&apos;ve made are countless haha).<br/>In fact, I found I can&apos;t connect the 45/32 with the 135/128 without moving the base scale in the chain of fifths.</p><p>Btw, one other thing, if you play along Drei Equale no3 with my JI score, you&apos;ll see how incredibly fast a minor chord roots! No need to include a 3/2 even.<br/>It does this just as well as a 5/4, only slightly more subtle.<br/>If you listen closely to Drei Equale no3, you&apos;ll still hear the emotional &quot;minorness&quot; when 19/18 4/3 19/12 chords play. (yes, minor &quot;major&quot; chords).</p><p>&gt; Instead, I think you should remain with the two chains of 3/2s a 5/4 apart (well, actually, there is also the infinite chains of 2/1&apos;s going up and down from every note in each chain of 3/2s; we can&apos;t neglect the octave in musical geometry).  The proper minor tonic has to be related to a 1/1-5/4-3/2 triad; if we are in A minor, the relative major is C.  For C to have a 5/4 major third, the A must be tuned 1/1-6/5-3/2.  The major dominant implied by the harmonic minor should of course be tuned as a Pythagorean triad, so the proper JI minor scale (with the raised VII in parentheses) would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1-9/8-6/5-4/3-3/2-8/5-9/5(243/128)-2/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you for your care to keep me on the straight path :)</p><p>Yes this minor scale is part of the JI scale.<br/>The relative minor indeed, it&apos;s on 15/8 as 1/1. (reason why so many pieces are not really in relative minor but in parallel minor while normal theory says they&apos;re in relative)</p><p>&gt; Which of course only defines notes in relation to the tonic and can move and shift with the music functionally.

For 10, 12, and 15, we have difference tones of 2, 3, and 5.  For 16, 19, and 24, we have 3, 5, and 8.  However, for a septimal minor of 6, 7, and 9, we have 1, 2, and 3--it is the most rooted of all of them, and also has the simplest periodicity of wave interactions.  I once considered deriving this chord from a harmonic series dominant 7th chord with a major 9th, of 1/1-5/4-3/2-7/4-9/8, but the scale that resulted seemed unworkable.  It required treating (in the key of C) F as 21/16, which meant that the subdominant would have a 64/63-sharpened wolf fifth.  Unacceptable.</p><p>&gt; The relative minor is 5/4 3/2 15/8 (or 5/3 2/1 5/2 when you tip the scale a fifth). It is<br/>&gt; not rooted because it is 1/1 6/5 3/2 seen from the root. Indicating a 1/5 as it&apos;s true<br/>&gt; root. (making a major 7th chord)</p><p>Yes, this is correct!  The 1/5 IS the true root, because minor chords are nothing but major 7th chords stripped of their root.</p><p>&gt; The 1/1 19/16 3/2 is a rooted minor.<br/>&gt; You provided your own math already for this. The difference tones reinforce the root. It &gt; doesn&apos;t matter that the 5th harmonic is one of the difference tones, only good.</p><p>The reinforcement is too weak to be audible.  Compare 1/1-19/16-3/2 with harmonics 4, 5, and 6: the latter produces difference tones of 1, 1, and 2, giving an incredibly strong reinforcement of 4 as an octave of the fundamental.  Yet even this phenomenon is subtle to the most attentive of ears unless blared in perfect tune by a brass trio.  1/1-19/16-3/2 simply does not produce even remotely the same effect.</p><p>However, I understand the reasons why you so much want this to work: even the most unschooled musician has an intuitive feeling that minor chords exist on the same musical footing as major chords, that they are equally strong and can fulfill the same &quot;functions&quot; so far as setting the key of a piece is concerned.  Sadly this is utterly misguided, and studying Just Intonation reveals this.  The only rootedness in a minor chord (other than the septimal minor) comes from the fifth, and varying the tuning of the 3rd has a negligible effect on the end result.  In fact, you yourself have proven this by virtue of your long history of indecision of how to tune the minor tonic!  If a man can study tuning so deeply as you have, with the best reproducing equipment and the keenest ears, and over many years of study still be flip-flopping over which tuning is correct, the only logical explanation is that your ears cannot decisively select a victor.  I came to this conclusion after much less time of studying, because I trust my ears to tell me where there is significance and where there isn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Btw, I see the difference tones as less important than the &quot;beating&quot; / &quot;periodicity of the<br/>&gt; combined waveforms&quot;. We&apos;re not dealing with sines in actual music and the overtones of &gt; the actual tones create a wealthy combination of difference tones, which all interfere.<br/>&gt; And the most audible end result is the &quot;beating&quot; / &quot;synchronicity of the waves&quot;.</p><p>I agree that this is true, and this favors either 6, 7, and 9th harmonics or 10, 12, and 15th harmonics as the tuning of a minor triad.  Consider that in most musical timbres, the 19th harmonic is inaudible, and in fact it is only up to the 16th harmonic that we can have any hope of hearing clearly.  On the cello, for instance, one can apply minute pressure to the string at different fractions of its length to isolate the harmonics of the vibrating string.  The clearest harmonic is 1/2 the length of the string, and this is the 2nd harmonic; next is 1/3, 1/4, and 1/5.  1/6 and 1/7 are barely audible and devilishly tricky to sound with volume.  When bowing the open string, the lowest harmonics overpower the higher ones by such a great deal that the higher ones provide only color to the sound.  How can it be that the 19th harmonic, used as an interval, can compete with the periodicity of the intervals between the 6th and 7th or 10th and 12th harmonics?  This I have studied with great intensity, initially to investigate the claims of radical &quot;JI-ists&quot; who speak of &quot;17-limit&quot; or &quot;23-limit&quot; (ad infinitum) &quot;JI&quot;.  If harmonics 7, 11, 13, and 17 do not fit into the common practice, I simply do not see how you can suggest the 19th harmonic.  It is no comparison to the tonic major triad at all, compares unfavorably with 1/1-7/6-3/2 in terms of rootedness, and unfavorably with 1/1-6/5-3/2 in terms of beating.</p><p>&gt; The 19th harmonic gives a pretty strong 1 as it&apos;s &quot;beating root&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Beating root&quot;?  I do not know how to interpret this except as &quot;difference tone&quot;.  Beating and difference tones are the same thing--beating refers only to a difference tone that is too low to be heard as a tone and instead is heard as a rhythmic pulsation.</p><p>&gt; In fact, I found I can&apos;t connect the 45/32 with the 135/128 without moving the base<br/>&gt; scale in the chain of fifths.</p><p>If you are using 45/32 and 135/128, that implies that you are either modulating to another key or else trying to tonicize the Locrian mode (which is impossible to do).</p><p>&gt; Btw, one other thing, if you play along Drei Equale no3 with my JI score, you&apos;ll see how<br/>&gt; incredibly fast a minor chord roots! No need to include a 3/2 even.</p><p>I respectfully must disagree.  The &quot;rooting&quot; is again more to do with the melodic devices employed--i.e. the movement of chord roots.</p><p>&gt; It does this just as well as a 5/4, only slightly more subtle.</p><p>Again, I disagree: the difference between them is hardly subtle at all.</p><p>&gt; If you listen closely to Drei Equale no3, you&apos;ll still hear the emotional &quot;minorness&quot; when &gt; 19/18 4/3 19/12 chords play. (yes, minor &quot;major&quot; chords).</p><p>In this case, I do agree that the chords do not sound properly &quot;major&quot;; they sound quite like Pythagorean triads--bordering tension and relaxation, having a slightly unpleasant (though not necessarily musically-inappropriate) roughness that is very distinct from a 1/1-5/4-3/2.  Whether this gives them &quot;minorness&quot; I am reluctant to say; they don&apos;t sound sad or dark like a minor chord, but they don&apos;t sound happy, calm, and bright like a major chord either.</p><p>&gt; Thank you for your care to keep me on the straight path :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes this minor scale is part of the JI scale.<br/>&gt; The relative minor indeed, it&apos;s on 15/8 as 1/1. (reason why so many pieces are not really &gt; in relative minor but in parallel minor while normal theory says they&apos;re in relative)</p><p>I believe you may be misusing the term &quot;relative minor&quot; if you say it uses 15/8 as the tonic.  The relative minor to a tonic of 1/1 would begin on 27/16, but because the true tonic of the minor scale is the 8 in an 8, 10, 12, and 15th harmonic chord, that would mean that the tonic is the 4/3 of the major scale.  However for that chord to be tuned properly, we have shift the 27/16 down to a 5/3.  This shift indicates to us how chord progressions must be restructured to allow root- and melodic movements to create the proper illusion of tonicizing the minor tonic.</p><p>Of course, this may also indicate that music theorists have had it wrong to consider the Aeolian mode the &quot;relative minor&quot; of the major/Ionian mode.  If we treat the Phrygian as the relative minor instead, there is no need to shift anything by a comma, and in point of fact if the I of the Phrygian is tune 10, 12, and 15, the 8 will be the I of the Ionian--as it should be, for the Ionian is the only true tonal mode.</p><p>Regardless, I should say that the distinction between relative minor and parallel minor is illusory.  All parallel minors are the relative minors of some other key.  Using the 19th harmonic will necessitate some very intricate three-dimensional movements to modulate between one of your &quot;parallel minors&quot; and its relative major tonic.  To modulate implies tonicizing a different chord, and it is not possible to tonicize a major chord other than a 1/1-5/4-3/2.  For the tonicization to work, we will have to swap the 19/16 chain of 3/2s for the 5/4 chain of 3/2s--in composition I could probably accomplish this gracefully, but in retuning another&apos;s work where such a modulation occurs would be difficult indeed.</p><p>In conclusion, I think the evidence is overwhelming that the existence of &quot;minor keys&quot; is illusory, or at best cannot be explained by the harmonic properties of any tuning of a minor triad.</p><p>--Dr. Gilbert.

For 10, 12, and 15, we have difference tones of 2, 3, and 5.  For 16, 19, and 24, we have 3, 5, and 8.  However, for a septimal minor of 6, 7, and 9, we have 1, 2, and 3--it is the most rooted of all of them, and also has the simplest periodicity of wave interactions.  I once considered deriving this chord from a harmonic series dominant 7th chord with a major 9th, of 1/1-5/4-3/2-7/4-9/8, but the scale that resulted seemed unworkable.  It required treating (in the key of C) F as 21/16, which meant that the subdominant would have a 64/63-sharpened wolf fifth.  Unacceptable.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You math in this area is not sufficient.<br/>Let take difference tones of two sines, in 3:5 ratio.<br/>The difference tones arise from nonlinear distortion on the combined wave.<br/>It gives a difference tone of 2 in the case of 3:5 sines.<br/>This difference tone is an actual tone. It is a real sine wave in itself, measurable and recordable.<br/>Therefore the difference tone itself also forms difference tones with the 2 other sines.<br/>In this case producing 2:3 difference tone 1, and 2:5 difference tone 3.<br/>Difference tones making new difference tones etc, it all points to 1 in the end.<br/>Difference tones fill out the lower harmonics of any harmony till 1.<br/>But.. difference tones in most circumstances are extremely weak, and inaudible.</p><p>There something else much much more important and audible.<br/>It&apos;s called &quot;beating&quot; I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re familiar with it.<br/>It&apos;s the &quot;buzz&quot; of a JI 1/1 5/4 3/2 chord for instance.<br/>It&apos;s very audible.<br/>Even if there&apos;s not a strong buzz, beating is still audible, and has been tested to be audible in a wide range, from far subsonic till fairly high into the audio range.<br/>Beating is caused by the phase cancellation of waves.<br/>It is very strong when sounds have rich overtones (most sounds)<br/>It is the reason why with sines it&apos;s much harder to tell how in tune something is than with a sawtooth wave for instance.<br/>As I said, beating is due to phase cancellation, also of the harmonics of the waves, and results in an &quot;amplitude wave&quot; in the total waveform.<br/>The lowest beating frequency is the periodicity of the waveform (the beating itself is a amplitude waveform with &quot;harmonics&quot; as well btw)<br/>The periodicity of the waveform is all ways the 1 of the harmonic series.<br/>(In the case of tempered intervals or very large ratios it will be hard to hear the fundamental beating though, and you&apos;ll tune into the strongest closest beat frequency harmonic and experience &quot;phase drifting&quot; on it)<br/>So in the case of a just 1/1 19/16 3/2 with a sawtooth the beating clearly points to 16/1 8/1 6/1 4/1 etc. Clearly rooted on 1.<br/>It sounds to you like it is &quot;in phase&quot; which it literally is.<br/>Very close you&apos;ll find the &quot;in phase&quot; of 32/27, which points to a different root, and close you&apos;ll also find 6/5 &quot;in phase&quot; which points to yet another root.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The relative minor is 5/4 3/2 15/8 (or 5/3 2/1 5/2 when you tip the scale a fifth). It is<br/>&gt; &gt; not rooted because it is 1/1 6/5 3/2 seen from the root. Indicating a 1/5 as it&apos;s true<br/>&gt; &gt; root. (making a major 7th chord)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this is correct!  The 1/5 IS the true root, because minor chords are nothing but major 7th chords stripped of their root.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The 1/1 19/16 3/2 is a rooted minor.<br/>&gt; &gt; You provided your own math already for this. The difference tones reinforce the root. It &gt; doesn&apos;t matter that the 5th harmonic is one of the difference tones, only good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reinforcement is too weak to be audible.  Compare 1/1-19/16-3/2 with harmonics 4, 5, and 6: the latter produces difference tones of 1, 1, and 2, giving an incredibly strong reinforcement of 4 as an octave of the fundamental.  Yet even this phenomenon is subtle to the most attentive of ears unless blared in perfect tune by a brass trio.  1/1-19/16-3/2 simply does not produce even remotely the same effect.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No it is audible.<br/>It is &quot;in phase&quot;. Beating is important, difference tones not but as as showed above even difference tones tell the same story.<br/>But even with sounds where it is not clearly audible.<br/>Our mind knows :)</p><p>&gt; However, I understand the reasons why you so much want this to work: even the most unschooled musician has an intuitive feeling that minor chords exist on the same musical footing as major chords, that they are equally strong and can fulfill the same &quot;functions&quot; so far as setting the key of a piece is concerned.  Sadly this is utterly misguided, and studying Just Intonation reveals this.  The only rootedness in a minor chord (other than the septimal minor) comes from the fifth, and varying the tuning of the 3rd has a negligible effect on the end result.  In fact, you yourself have proven this by virtue of your long history of indecision of how to tune the minor tonic!  If a man can study tuning so deeply as you have, with the best reproducing equipment and the keenest ears, and over many years of study still be flip-flopping over which tuning is correct, the only logical explanation is that your ears cannot decisively select a victor.  I came to this conclusion after much less time of studying, because I trust my ears to tell me where there is significance and where there isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well actually, I had done test with 2 chord progressions where it was most clear to me the 6/5 minor was way too high.<br/>And then testing the 19/16 and other in it&apos;s place.<br/>I found 19/16 to be slightly too high, but very consonant.<br/>Only just now, when I got real close to the correct way of doing things, was I able to tell that the 2 progressions I used for testing should have a 32/27 minor there in correct JI! (no wonder the 6/5 stuck out most there)<br/>So I had been testing the 19/16 in the wrong place!<br/>Errors like this happen all the time in this field of research.<br/>The 19/16 in the correct place sounds absolutely 100% perfect.<br/>Perhaps you conducted listening tests in the wrong way as well (for instance be careful what you play before)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Btw, I see the difference tones as less important than the &quot;beating&quot; / &quot;periodicity of the<br/>&gt; &gt; combined waveforms&quot;.

(reason why so many pieces are not really &gt; in relative minor but in parallel minor while normal theory says they&apos;re in relative)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe you may be misusing the term &quot;relative minor&quot; if you say it uses 15/8 as the tonic.  The relative minor to a tonic of 1/1 would begin on 27/16, but because the true tonic of the minor scale is the 8 in an 8, 10, 12, and 15th harmonic chord, that would mean that the tonic is the 4/3 of the major scale.  However for that chord to be tuned properly, we have shift the 27/16 down to a 5/3.  This shift indicates to us how chord progressions must be restructured to allow root- and melodic movements to create the proper illusion of tonicizing the minor tonic.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No I don&apos;t see this as a fixed thing.<br/>Relative minor can be from 5/3, 27/16 with 1/1, or 27/16 with a 513/512.<br/>The base JI scale does not corresponds 1 on 1 with what normal music theory considers to be a &quot;key&quot;.<br/>Normal music theory is based not only on practice but also for a large part on the Pythagorean system and it&apos;s chain of fifths.<br/>There are so many errors in it that it can&apos;t translate well to JI without serious re-interpretation.</p><p>&gt; Of course, this may also indicate that music theorists have had it wrong to consider the Aeolian mode the &quot;relative minor&quot; of the major/Ionian mode.  If we treat the Phrygian as the relative minor instead, there is no need to shift anything by a comma, and in point of fact if the I of the Phrygian is tune 10, 12, and 15, the 8 will be the I of the Ionian--as it should be, for the Ionian is the only true tonal mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regardless, I should say that the distinction between relative minor and parallel minor is illusory.  All parallel minors are the relative minors of some other key.  Using the 19th harmonic will necessitate some very intricate three-dimensional movements to modulate between one of your &quot;parallel minors&quot; and its relative major tonic.  To modulate implies tonicizing a different chord, and it is not possible to tonicize a major chord other than a 1/1-5/4-3/2.  For the tonicization to work, we will have to swap the 19/16 chain of 3/2s for the 5/4 chain of 3/2s--in composition I could probably accomplish this gracefully, but in retuning another&apos;s work where such a modulation occurs would be difficult indeed.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Aaah noo, but here we hit a very important point.<br/>You say &quot;all parallel minors are the relative minors of some other key.&quot;<br/>Yes this may be true in 12tet.<br/>But in actual music it is not the same.<br/>The feeling is different and the tuning is different.<br/>It depends veyr much on how you get there in how it will feel.<br/>There is musical coherence / continuity to take into account. This means no comma shifts. It is part of what my base JI scale sets rules / limit for.<br/>And if you manage to break these rules, you break musical continuity.<br/>play for instance a piece in B major, and then all of a sudden in the middle of the piece pitch that piece to F major. Musical continuity / coherence is surely broken there.<br/>Or play 2 random different pieces in different keys at the same. They do not form a coherent whole, a single piece.</p><p>&gt; In conclusion, I think the evidence is overwhelming that the existence of &quot;minor keys&quot; is illusory, or at best cannot be explained by the harmonic properties of any tuning of a minor triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dr. Gilbert.

Yes, of course of COURSE in other roles there are different minor chords.  The main tenet of your theory that so initially intrigued me (and to this day keeps me thinking) is that there are multiple varieties of both major and minor triads, and the particular tuning of these triads is dictated by their functionality IN MUSIC.</p><p>My point is merely that there is no minor triad whose tuning is compatible with common practice that can serve as a tonic with equal or comparable psychoacoustic properties to the major triad.  All possible tunings of the minor tonic chord are thus to be determined as secondary concern to the tunings of the majors and their functions within the JI framework.  If you look at the three major chords in a major scale, they define the entire scale: I-III-V, IV-VI-I, V-VII-II.  There is no need to take the minor chords into account at all.</p><p>Now, to me it seems like your suggestion of the 19th harmonic as the third in the tonic minor triad is really a tacit assertion that ALL major chords in a minor key must be stripped of their restfulness in order to allow the minor tonic to seem restful by comparison.  This is workable, yes, but also artificial.  It is more sensible to admit simply that the minor key is an illusion, one which works because of the power of melody and certain root-movements.</p><p>This, I think, is reason for you to study academic common-practice music theory.  It is full of fallacies, yes, but before we can understand how to functionally tune triads, we have to understand how single-note progressions create tension and relaxation.  Playing only single notes, there is a major difference (no pun intended!) between moving by 16/15, by 4/3, by 3/2, by 5/4, by 27/16, etc.  We must build our understanding of JI from the ground up, not the top down!  Then and only then will we be able to understand how first to tune dyads and then to tune triads to follow and enhance the functions of the root movements.</p><p>And after all, I do recall you posting an example progression using neutral third triads using the 39th harmonic awhile back, perhaps on another list--do you recall it?  It sounded exceptionally strong despite the fact that triads involving the 39th harmonic cannot be considered &quot;Just&quot; in any meaningful sense of the word: with harmonics 32, 39, and 48, we have difference tones of 7, 9, and 16--very cloudy, root-wise, if one ignores the effects of the perfect fifth--and the periodicity is off the charts bad.

Yes,<br/>of course of COURSE in other roles there are different minor chords. The<br/>main tenet of your theory that so initially intrigued me (and to this day<br/>keeps me thinking) is that there are multiple varieties of both major and<br/>minor triads, and the particular tuning of these triads is dictated by their<br/>functionality IN MUSIC.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point is merely that there is no minor triad whose tuning is compatible<br/>with common practice that can serve as a tonic with equal or comparable<br/>psychoacoustic properties to the major triad. All possible tunings of the<br/>minor tonic chord are thus to be determined as secondary concern to the<br/>tunings of the majors and their functions within the JI framework. If you<br/>look at the three major chords in a major scale, they define the entire<br/>scale: I-III-V, IV-VI-I, V-VII-II. There is no need to take the minor chords<br/>into account at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, to me it seems like your suggestion of the 19th harmonic as the third<br/>in the tonic minor triad is really a tacit assertion that ALL major chords<br/>in a minor key must be stripped of their restfulness in order to allow the<br/>minor tonic to seem restful by comparison. This is workable, yes, but also<br/>artificial. It is more sensible to admit simply that the minor key is an<br/>illusion, one which works because of the power of melody and certain<br/>root-movements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This, I think, is reason for you to study academic common-practice music<br/>theory. It is full of fallacies, yes, but before we can understand how to<br/>functionally tune triads, we have to understand how single-note progressions<br/>create tension and relaxation. Playing only single notes, there is a major<br/>difference (no pun intended!) between moving by 16/15, by 4/3, by 3/2, by<br/>5/4, by 27/16, etc. We must build our understanding of JI from the ground<br/>up, not the top down! Then and only then will we be able to understand how<br/>first to tune dyads and then to tune triads to follow and enhance the<br/>functions of the root movements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And after all, I do recall you posting an example progression using<br/>neutral third triads using the 39th harmonic awhile back, perhaps on another<br/>list--do you recall it? It sounded exceptionally strong despite the fact<br/>that triads involving the 39th harmonic cannot be considered &quot;Just&quot; in any<br/>meaningful sense of the word: with harmonics 32, 39, and 48, we have<br/>difference tones of 7, 9, and 16--very cloudy, root-wise, if one ignores the<br/>effects of the perfect fifth--and the periodicity is off the charts bad. Yet<br/>with these unJust chords you created a perfectly functional progression that<br/>worked on the strength of the 3/2&apos;s and the root movements you selected.

It is a real sine wave in itself, measurable and<br/>&gt; recordable.<br/>&gt; Therefore the difference tone itself also forms difference tones with the 2 other sines.<br/>&gt; In this case producing 2:3 difference tone 1, and 2:5 difference tone 3.<br/>&gt; Difference tones making new difference tones etc, it all points to 1 in the end.<br/>&gt; Difference tones fill out the lower harmonics of any harmony till 1.<br/>&gt; But.. difference tones in most circumstances are extremely weak, and inaudible.</p><p>Yes, I am aware of all of this.  I fail to see what bearing it has on my argument.  Difference tones are not all weak in the case of bowed strings.  Playing a perfect 4th vs a perfect 5th on the cello for instance sounds very different: C-F as 1/1-4/3 creates a difference tone that reinforces the F, whereas C-G as 1/1-3/2 creates a difference tone that reinforces the C.  In the case of the former, you can actually hear the lower F (which is lower in pitch than the C in the latter case) and as a result the dyad sounds actually deeper!  It is not subtle at all.  Even on an acoustic guitar the effect is audible, to say nothing of a church organ.</p><p>&gt; There something else much much more important and audible.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s called &quot;beating&quot; I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re familiar with it.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)</a></p><p>&quot;In acoustics, a beat is an interference between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, perceived as periodic variations in volume whose rate is the difference between the two frequencies.&quot;</p><p>Beating thus occurs only between two sounds that are close in pitch, e.g. those that are out-of-tune.  You are thinking of &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;.  They are different phenomena and I am surprised the distinction is not familiar to you!</p><p>&gt; It is very strong when sounds have rich overtones (most sounds)<br/>&gt; It is the reason why with sines it&apos;s much harder to tell how in tune something is than with &gt; a sawtooth wave for instance.</p><p>Yes, that is because the partials also beat with each other, and the loudest partials have the most audible beating.  This is why 12-ET sounds out of tune: when playing a major third of 400 cents, it causes the 5th partial of the fundamental to beat strongly with the 4th partial of the major 3rd.  Similarly with a minor 3rd of 300 cents, it causes the 6th partial of the fundamental to beat with the 5th partial of the minor 3rd.  This is the reason Pythagorean triads are tense and 5-limit triads are relaxed: low-pitched beat-frequencies that sound like a tremolo are unpleasant to the ear.  19/16 too causes beating in the same way the 12-ET minor 3rd does, especially obvious in the baritone range.</p><p>&gt; The periodicity of the waveform is all ways the 1 of the harmonic series.</p><p>Is that what you meant by &quot;beating root&quot;?</p><p>&gt; So in the case of a just 1/1 19/16 3/2 with a sawtooth the beating clearly points to 16/1 &gt; 8/1 6/1 4/1 etc. Clearly rooted on 1.<br/>&gt; It sounds to you like it is &quot;in phase&quot; which it literally is.<br/>&gt; Very close you&apos;ll find the &quot;in phase&quot; of 32/27, which points to a different root, and close &gt; you&apos;ll also find 6/5 &quot;in phase&quot; which points to yet another root.</p><p>Of these I decidedly DO NOT hear the first two as &quot;in phase&quot;.  They all sound like they are phase-drifting to my ears.  Only the 6/5 sounds in phase.  But that is not the point, of course.  Phase-drifting chords have musical significance because of the logical structure they arise from.  Pythagorean chords do not sound in-phase the way 5-limit chords do, and the difference in that quality is the reason Pythagorean chords are appropriate in places 5-limit chords are not.  But I still am not convinced that 19-limit chords are ever appropriate.  The difference between 19/16 and 32/27 is scarcely 3 cents, and simply the act of moving one&apos;s head during listening would be enough to disturb the impinging waveforms enough so as to blur one interval into the other.  Are you really so sure that you are hearing the difference and not imagining it?  The case for 32/27 as a tonic minor triad seems to me to be stronger--it does not require adding an extra dimension to music, it preserves Pythagorean logic, it explains more about how the roots are moving.  And it makes a negligible difference in sound.</p><p>&gt; No it is audible.<br/>&gt; It is &quot;in phase&quot;. Beating is important, difference tones not but as as showed above even<br/>&gt; difference tones tell the same story.<br/>&gt; But even with sounds where it is not clearly audible.<br/>&gt; Our mind knows :)</p><p>How can the mind &quot;know&quot; if the ears do not?  If I cannot hear a difference, how can I &quot;know&quot; what is happening?  And again, I refer you to the Wikipedia article on beating to remind you that beating and difference tones are the same phenomenon, the only difference is in the frequency of the waves that result from the combination of the two sounds.</p><p>&gt; Well actually, I had done test with 2 chord progressions where it was most clear to me<br/>&gt; the 6/5 minor was way too high.</p><p>Too high for what?  I thought the issue here was beating and/or difference tones.  Now you are saying that is simply a matter of being too high in pitch?</p><p>Are you quite sure that the reason it sounds too high is not simply because of the tuning of the other chords in the progression?  Or that you were tonicizing the right chord?  I ask you again to consider my hypothesis that the true &quot;relative minor&quot; is the Phrygian mode, not the Aeolian mode (that would be the mode of E in the key of C major, as opposed to the mode of A, if you are not familiar with the names of the modes).</p><p>&gt; So I had been testing the 19/16 in the wrong place!</p><p>And thus, the 6/5 as well.  Perhaps you should test 6/5 again, in the right place?</p><p>&gt; The 19/16 in the correct place sounds absolutely 100% perfect.</p><p>I disagree.  It sounds familiar, it sounds Pythagorean...it sounds like 12-ET.  I am not convinced you are not another hapless victim of a lifetime of 12-ET acculturation.  I have been fortunate enough to have been educated as first and foremost a cellist, and have long known to avoid the wrongly-intoned pitches of 12-ET.  I can assure you my ears know<br/>true JI; it is only my mind that is still struggling to formalize and articulate what I have long experienced in my own playing.</p><p>&gt; Yes I&apos;ve investigates extended JI as well. It&apos;s how I started when I got interested in<br/>&gt; alternative tunings 5 years or so ago.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not just about the periodicity.<br/>&gt; Not all intervals are created equal :)<br/>&gt; The fifth divides into 5/4 and 19/16 consonantly.</p><p>It is difficult to say what the fifth divides into consonantly, because the fifth itself is such a powerful consonance.  It is on the strength of its fifth that 12-ET has triumphed and endured for so long.</p><p>&gt; Ah thanks for telling.<br/>&gt; I really know too little of normal music theory.<br/>&gt; I found this out the hard way lol.</p><p>You are in the Netherlands, no?  A friend of mine once studied at the Royal Conservatory of the Hague.  According to her, there are people there very interested in Just intonation.  Perhaps a few e-mails might find you a sympathetic ear with someone who could fill in the gaps in your &quot;normal music theory&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The first chords are Pythagorean, they sound very different to me.<br/>&gt; Also if you look in that part where those chords are at the melody and resolution of the &gt; phrase you&apos;ll see that he&apos;s really harmonizing minor in relative major chords (19/18 4/3 &gt; 19/12 etc).</p><p>Yes, I see what he is doing, but you still have not sold me on the 19th harmonic.  Do you have a rendering where Pythagorean minors are used in place of the 19th harmonic?  I would like to compare it if so.</p><p>&gt; No I don&apos;t see this as a fixed thing.<br/>&gt; Relative minor can be from 5/3, 27/16 with 1/1, or 27/16 with a 513/512.<br/>&gt; The base JI scale does not corresponds 1 on 1 with what normal music theory considers &gt; to be a &quot;key&quot;.</p><p>Ah, I see.  This then is probably why my own composition fell short.  I do not yet fully understand how the JI scale diverges from what is considered to be a key.  Perhaps you can explain: supposing a piece of music which in 12-ET uses only 7 notes, what is the maximum number of JI notes you would need in a scale to render that same piece in True JI?</p><p>&gt; Aaah noo, but here we hit a very important point.<br/>&gt; You say &quot;all parallel minors are the relative minors of some other key.&quot;<br/>&gt; Yes this may be true in 12tet.<br/>&gt; But in actual music it is not the same.</p><p>Is it not?  In actual music, one can modulate, changing keys in the middle of a piece, in the middle of a phrase even.  There are progressions--root movements--which can tonicize different chords in a scale.  Look at tritone substitutions, for example.  It is not uncommon at all to modulate between a relative minor and major.  Playing in C major, one can modulate to A minor for instance with a simple I-V-IV-III-vi progression at any point in a composition, and then once in A minor, one can get back to C major with a simple i-V-VI-VII-III (where i is A minor and III is C major).  It is absolutely the simplest thing in the world to do, but it loses all sense if we are going back and forth between 19th harmonics and 5th harmonics.  Because--consider this: we might start a piece in A minor, using (by your rules) the 19th harmonic, but then modulate to C major at some point.  Unless the C major is rendered as a 5-limit triad, we have not truly &quot;modulated&quot; and the effect will not be as intended.</p><p>&gt; Also, really load up:<br/>&gt; 1/1 19/18 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 19/12 27/16 16/9 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; And start improvising some, using the 19 for minors.<br/>&gt; Trust me, really do it! :)</p><p>I will post the unmastered results of my foray, though I am not much of a pianist so I cannot vouch for the performance quality.</p><p>--Dr. Sullivan</p></div><h3>purest_intonation@...</h3><span>3/6/2011 9:33:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HEY GUYS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/metatuning/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-research/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-research/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you not figured out that you&apos;re driving everybody nuts yet?</p><p>I apologize if you interpret these posts as being irrelevant to making music.

There are other forums for that. Go there.&gt;  Now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the forum that Marcel DeVelde uses to advance his theories, so this is the forum I decided to join.  If he will consent to join me elsewhere, then I will leave you people to stew in your bad attitudes.  If no one here is interested in exploring the laws of music through actual composition, then I have nothing to gain from being here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But perhaps I have sown a few seeds of introspection and some of you may come to learn something from my time here.  If nothing else, some humility perhaps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dr. Sullivan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2011 3:11:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Mar 7, 2011 at 6:04 AM, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You, whoever the hell you are as the impersonator of a Mr. Dr. Gilbert &amp;<br/>&gt; Sullivan, are just one step shy of me activating my filters on you, lest<br/>&gt; the moderators spare me the indignation and hurl you out themselves with<br/>&gt; your dime-worth theories off of these forums.</p><p>Better watch out, Gilbert, things are getting serious around here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
