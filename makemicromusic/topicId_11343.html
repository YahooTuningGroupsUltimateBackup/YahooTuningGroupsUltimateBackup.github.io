On a qwerty keyboard, the G<br/>button (for typing the letter &apos;G&apos;) is roughly in the middle of the<br/>keyboard. I have assigned this button on my Qwerty keyboard to play<br/>Scale Degree zero in whichever tuning is loaded.</p><p>If you want the center pitch (the one that you play with the G button)<br/>to be A440, then you&apos;ll have to set Scala&apos;s defaults to tune scale<br/>degree zero (that&apos;s the one that the G button plays) to A440.</p><p>You have to load the equivalent tuning into Scala, too. You could use<br/>the 55tet keyboard with a Slendro tuning, and the G button would still<br/>play scale degree zero, but all of the other keys would play<br/>pseudorandom notes from many different octaves.</p></div><h3><a id=11396 href="#11396">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2005 9:09:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles Lucy wrote:<br/>&gt; One of the eternal shortcomings that I have found with the .scl list  &gt; of intervals format is that the reference pitch is not necessarily  &gt; accurately defined.<br/>&gt; &gt; I appreciate the various arguments for using C as the basis, as 12edo  &gt; C or 256 Hz, and matching to diverse tempo or physical/biological  &gt; references etc<br/>&gt; &gt; Yet it has always seemed to me that agreeing on a single standard  &gt; A=440Hz would make the most sense.</p><p>A=440 makes sense if you&apos;re notating the pitches of each note in cents in a score. On the other hand, A wasn&apos;t always tuned to 440 Hz, so you&apos;ll need the flexibility to tune A to different pitches for early music if nothing else. And for whatever reason, various composers specify certain pitches that aren&apos;t based on A=440. Easley Blackwood specifies middle C tuned to 264 Hz, for instance. Recently, I&apos;ve been using D=290 Hz. I don&apos;t expect that anyone else will necessarily want to tune D to 290 Hz, but it&apos;s nice that Scala gives me the option to do that (since D is the center of symmetry of meantone notation, it makes sense to use it as the center for other temperaments, and I picked 290 Hz because it&apos;s a nice round number that still sounds like a D).</p></div><h3><a id=11410 href="#11410">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2005 10:51:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A=440 makes sense if you&apos;re notating the pitches of each note in cents<br/>&gt; in a score.</p><p>The trouble with 440 is that it isn&apos;t divisible by three.
