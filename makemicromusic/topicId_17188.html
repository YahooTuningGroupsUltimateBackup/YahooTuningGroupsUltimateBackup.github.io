What&apos;s not-so-great is his tendency to noodle aimlessly in development sections, and his wrapping-himself-in-the flag (not bad in itself maybe, but it made him political enemies on the Left post WWII...then he went to Russia and made Useful Idiot comments that didn&apos;t endear him to the Right either). Still, an unjustly neglected composer. The work of his that I&apos;m most curious about his Symphony 11, which is supposedly the least optimistic of the Harris symphonies. It was written during the troubles of the late &apos;60s.</p><p>More stuff coming out now though...symphonies on Naxos (3,4,7,9 IIRC), 2,8,9 on Albany, a nice new recording of chamber music by 3rd Angle.  I&apos;m quite fond of Symphony 6 myself.</p><p>--<br/>Jeffrey Quick<br/><a href="http://www.en.com/users/jaquick">www.en.com/users/jaquick</a><br/><a href="http://blog.case.edu/jeffrey.quick/">http://blog.case.edu/jeffrey.quick/</a><br/>If your Renaissance band has a dumbek, the terrorists have won.</p></div>
