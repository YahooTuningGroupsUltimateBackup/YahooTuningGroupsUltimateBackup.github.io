I believe people posted the link when the first episode aired, but I believe the 2nd was on the 10th, so I guess it has been done as well. I was disappointed in the first episode to a degree, as they tended to highlight some people that haven&apos;t done much for *music* microtonally, at the expense of some who have, but to most people I&apos;m sure this is just a quibble.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
