seemed like an incredibly inefficient, if effective, way of learning. :-D</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possible answers for the question of the forces on a basketball right after leaving the player&apos;s hand were<br/>A) upwards and constant<br/>B) upwards and decreasing<br/>C) downwards and constant<br/>D) downwards and decreasing<br/>E) tangent to the ball&apos;s path</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously the force is downwards, otherwise the basketball&apos;s upward motion would not be decelerating.<br/>&nbsp; However, many students may not know the difference between force and kinetic energy and thus state the &quot;force&quot; is upward because the motion is upward when they are actually discussing kinetic energy.&nbsp; Defining kinetic energy in this context would solve this confusion...plus be useful elsewhere (they learn an extra definition in the process).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People may also be confused into thinking the force is not constant as the motion appears to be moving slower and slower upward.</p><p>&nbsp; However, virtually no beginning physics course explains that the force is the derivative/slope of the motion...which just happens to be a straight line slope AKA a constant slope.&nbsp; If people understood how derivatives work there would be no need for tons of counter examples to explain what&apos;s going on, IMVHO...plus people would gain a visual understanding of derivatives and, yes, be able to use them elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, to note, why my calculus teacher did not explain derivatives visually as slopes of sorts is beyond<br/> me...&nbsp; As soon as my father did so I had an AHA moment and could visually explain things like why trigonometric derivatives were shaped as they were.</p><p>---------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, well I DO believe counter-examples work in things like physics for learning, I believe they work by memorization of &quot;what not to do&quot;, which makes learning new things slower.&nbsp; I also firmly believe the answer in fast and attentive learning lies in detailed explanations of WHY something works exactly how it does.</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2011 9:24:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
