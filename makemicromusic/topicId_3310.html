I figured out how to<br/>retune it, and how to write my own tunings. The way it does it is it<br/>maps the tuning out in cents on notes 0-127. (i.e. note0=0<br/>note1=50...) Is there a way to get scala to [1] map the octave on to<br/>127 notes [2] copy paste into a text file [3] directly save as this<br/>sort of file?</p><p>Also I noticed on vaz [2.1] the quarter tone scale is difficult to<br/>hear. It is not as dramatic, for some reason, a difference with the<br/>patches I am using. Or may I am too used to microtonality in synths<br/>(i have only composed and dealt with electronic music I started<br/>writing for piano and what not this year)</p><p>todd</p></div>
