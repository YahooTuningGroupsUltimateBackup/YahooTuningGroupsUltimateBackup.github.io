May I quote you in future press releases<br/>(yeah, I&apos;m serious)?</p><p>&gt;&gt;(In some places I think I might be hearing<br/>some GRM Tools in there...?)</p><p>You&apos;re not. Most of the synthesis on that recording<br/>was done on my Kurzweil K2000 with sampler.<br/>(Branchings and all the Clavette pieces used it). I<br/>almost always start with a standard Kurzweil ROM sound<br/>and edit the tuning and occasionally some other<br/>parameters. Aki No Iro was done using a Yamaha TX802.<br/>Untitled #3 was done with 2 Yamaha PF80 (FM)<br/>electronic pianos, Yamaha effect processor, and<br/>(obviously) sequencer. Some of the synthesis effects<br/>in Branchings and Untitled #3 result from the speed of<br/>attack of the notes, sometimes up 50/second (50 Hz),<br/>all done via sequencer.</p><p>Thanks of course to my ol&apos; co-conspirator Kris Peck in<br/>Minneapolis for his guitar work (and 20-tone JI elec.<br/>guitar) on the Endangered Species recording.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Am I the first to hear it?<br/>You&apos;re one of the few to get this noncommercial<br/>edition, along with Ezra Sims, the Cambridge, MA<br/>72-ish composer. But I had the pleasure to visit with<br/>Paul Erlich Thurs. night, and left him a copy.<br/>    And of course I have all of these pieces in one or<br/>another live show I&apos;ve done over the years.<br/>    I hope to release a for-sale album including most<br/>of those pieces by late 2003, and then tour a few<br/>places with it. But I&apos;d hope to play live here and<br/>there over that period as well.<br/>    I also hope to put some sizeable excerpts of these<br/>pieces up to my website later this year.</p><p>Yours truly,<br/>Harold</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Try FREE Yahoo!
