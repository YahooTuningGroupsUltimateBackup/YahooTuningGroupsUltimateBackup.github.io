I think<br/>listeners love drones for the same reason composers do - for the stability they impart and<br/>melodic subtlety they allow. And the world music tradition I envy most is Indian. The final<br/>scene of my Custer and Sitting Bull is over a drone, and I chose that because I thought<br/>audiences would respond to it powerfully - which they seem to. I&apos;m just too Western and<br/>too figured-bass trained to want to do *only* that.</p><p>I&apos;m with you - let every possible kind of tuning flourish. You could have told me that<br/>&quot;Study for KG&quot; was 79-limit with a hexadecimal eikosany in a 23-29-31-37-41-43<br/>diamond, and how would I have known different? :^D</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2005 6:08:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 15 Nov 2005, Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As soon as I posted I realized of course, that the answer would be<br/>&gt; Debussy/Ravel type parallelism of the 13-limit chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I think we agree that using inversions with these upper partials as<br/>the<br/>&gt; lowest note is out of the question unless we enjoy making people cringe at<br/>&gt; the though of microtonal music.</p><p>Aaron,<br/>Not necessarily!  I think that the amount of cringe depends largely<br/>on the satisfaction the listener gets from the _relative_ resolution<br/>of discords.  Anything that ends more discordantly than it began is<br/>usually unsatisfying, and vice versa.</p><p>Also, the relative consonance of any of these chords depends on<br/>how many of the chord notes are present and how many omitted;<br/>more open chords have fewer intervals and may appear more<br/>restful.  For example, in jazz a 13th chord rarely has all of tonic,<br/>third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh and thirteenth present, does<br/>it?  All that&apos;s required is that the most _characteristic_ intervals<br/>of the chord are present.  This works for all inversions of those<br/>chords.  I think the same would apply to higher limit chords; there&apos;s<br/>no reason in principle why even two- or three-part writing might not<br/>employ chords of various limits up to a stated maximum, with both<br/>partial and full cadences crafted by moving form higher to lower<br/>limits.</p><p>A particular kind of bass line for such music, as I described<br/>earlier in reply to Kyle, that &quot;walks&quot; the scale or the chord - rather<br/>than walking the cycle of fifths (or substitutes) as in 3-limit music<br/>- seems to me particularly appropriate as a foundation for creating<br/>such a harmonic flow.  I think I may have to find a spare week (over<br/>Christmas?) to try to realise these ideas in composition ... :-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.362 / Virus Database: 267.13.3/172 - Release Date: 15/11/05</p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;petesfriedclams@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2005 7:17:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>for the record, both<br/>&gt; modes of thinking are really cool and really useful and really<br/>adorable and<br/>&gt; cuddly)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t that tend to make them popular?  ;-)</p><p>-P</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2005 6:56:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tuesday 15 November 2005 9:48 am, Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; I think some of Lou Harrisons gamelan ensembles does exactly this type<br/>&gt; of thing and doesn&apos;t make us cringe at all.</p><p>I can see why not, too---metallaphones can make anything sound reasonably<br/>good!</p><p>I should have said a typical bright timbre like a harpsichord or sawtooth wave<br/>would do the trick...</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;But I think we agree that using inversions with these upper partials as<br/>&gt; &gt; the lowest note is out of the question unless we enjoy making people<br/>&gt; &gt; cringe at the though of microtonal music.</p></div><h3>George D.
