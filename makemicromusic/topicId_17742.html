If you go<br/>with a publishing house, you have to be prepared to share 1/2 of the<br/>fees collected by the performance rights organization. I would only<br/>advise this if (a) you don&apos;t want to deal with the hassle of renting<br/>parts, (b) the publisher, at their expense, creates beautiful<br/>editions, extracts parts, etc.., and (c) the publisher is<br/>contractually obliged to promote your music. If a publisher cannot<br/>provide all of these, there is no sense in not publishing your<br/>materials yourself, and several composer colleagues of mine make a<br/>substantial part of their income from their rental business (enough<br/>in at least two cases to be able to give up day jobs teaching).</p><p>If you publish your music yourself, there is really no good argument<br/>against placing your scores online. If a score is online, it has a<br/>public presence, and can be perused by potential performers. If<br/>someone does perform your work, the important thing is that<br/>performers and presenters register the performance with you as well<br/>as with the local performance rights organization.  Most musicians<br/>will respond with goodwill to a composer&apos;s request to be notified of<br/>performers. In most cases, presenting institutions have blanket<br/>licenses with these organizations, so your fee has, essentially,<br/>already been collected, but cannot be claimed unless the performance<br/>is registered.</p><p>Placing a score online, unlike a recording, also preserves a certain<br/>amount of control for the composer.  A composer retains the right for<br/>only the first recording or broadcast of a work (which is the legal<br/>basis for &quot;covers&quot; in pop music) and with the publication of a score<br/>a composer does not automatically license the score user to do as<br/>they please.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3><a id=17754 href="#17754">ðŸ”—</a>Doctor Oakroot &#x3C;doctor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2007 5:39:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you release your CD on <a href="http://CDbaby.com">CDbaby.com</a>, they can get you on iTunes.

Seriously, the only composers I know who<br/>quit their day jobs were married to the bread-winner.</p><p>The only way I know of that a composer can make any<br/>money with sheet music is to write band music and/or pedagogical<br/>music. Forget orchestral music. Try solo flute. And even then, the<br/>income is sad. There is some money in marching band music. (Always<br/>keep in mind anything connected with college sports has money in it,<br/>as anyone who has ever had anything to do with academia knows. The<br/>marching band director can easily make twice as much money as<br/>a tenured musicologist).</p><p>&gt; If you publish your music yourself, there is really no good argument<br/>&gt; against placing your scores online.</p><p>A good compromise to placing the score online (which essentially makes<br/>it totally free and reproducible for anyone and you get nothing for it) is<br/>to place only part of it online, and put a watermark on that. Then put an<br/>option to buy the complete un-watermarked pdf for some $.</p><p>&gt; If a score is online, it has a<br/>&gt; public presence, and can be perused by potential performers. If<br/>&gt; someone does perform your work, the important thing is that<br/>&gt; performers and presenters register the performance with you as well<br/>&gt; as with the local performance rights organization.  Most musicians<br/>&gt; will respond with goodwill to a composer&apos;s request to be notified of<br/>&gt; performers. In most cases, presenting institutions have blanket<br/>&gt; licenses with these organizations, so your fee has, essentially,<br/>&gt; already been collected, but cannot be claimed unless the performance<br/>&gt; is registered.</p><p>This is also the way ASCAP works.</p><p>&gt; Placing a score online, unlike a recording, also preserves a certain<br/>&gt; amount of control for the composer.  A composer retains the right for<br/>&gt; only the first recording or broadcast of a work (which is the legal<br/>&gt; basis for &quot;covers&quot; in pop music) and with the publication of a score<br/>&gt; a composer does not automatically license the score user to do as<br/>&gt; they please.</p><p>If you decide to put it up there complete and unwater-marked, it<br/>would probably be wise to also put a notice for fair use, etc.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=17761 href="#17761">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2007 12:03:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think this touches upon that if one in going to do a recording, one might consider how the work manifests in that medium.<br/>The great advantage of recordings is that many more people have access to them, beyond just players. Often scores cannot convey all the information in performing a piece. If a composer has a &quot;definite&quot; recording of a piece, it can be quite useful to performers. I admit to a certain &quot;Samuel Becket&quot; attitude of not allowing performances unless i am personally involved. Compositions are like Children in a way and one likes to look over their early life. Their is an ensemble here that does wonderful performances of many of the S. Reich pieces. Some where actually the first live performances of the pieces i heard. But they cannot do paid public performances without dealing out hundreds. So in this case publishing becomes more of an obstacle than an advantage!</p><p>danieljameswolf wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I dislike recordings of music not intended specifically<br/>&gt; for recorded media, so I discourage recordings.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=17763 href="#17763">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2007 12:23:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Everyone acts like putting &quot;all this work&quot; into music automatically<br/>makes it valuable.

It&apos;s not becausee they aren&apos;t good enough, believe me.<br/>If they are doing fine in music, it&apos;s usually because they have a<br/>spouse who works in another field (often that does not even<br/>require a college education) who is making the real money!</p><p>But maybe music as a profession has always been an absurdity.<br/>I don&apos;t quite buy the comparison with farmers, doctors and<br/>lawyers, because it&apos;s much easier to show how those things are<br/>necessary.

Art in general gives reasons why. Living without becomes intolerable and the lack of it on some level is part of the discontent we find where cultures that are poorer often have a more enjoyable life. Who do you see smiling on a downtown street. One has everything one could want just around the corner. But it is ugly in order to be &quot;efficient&quot;. Tourism has dropped drastically all though the US. Why? cause there isn&apos;t anything worth seeing and when it is , guess what it is.

On the other end there is not a bar in Louisiana that doesn&apos;t give the band some money. One of the poorest states.

If we&apos;d<br/>do it for free, just for the fun or the love of it, how can we DEMAND<br/>that people pay us for it?</p><p>&gt; So, gigging musicians are unscrupulous? What planet are you from?<br/>&gt; Are farmers who don&apos;t give tomatoes away unscrupulous?</p><p>Again, you misunderstand.  What I was referring to is that,<br/>statistically speaking, it is hard to make money as a gigging musician<br/>if you have a lot of artistic integrity (unless of course your<br/>artistic vision happens to be exactly what most people want to hear).<br/> The most money to be made is in playing shameless popular music,<br/>which for a lot of musicians, would be a compromise of their artistic<br/>scruples.  Hence, &quot;unscrupulous&quot;.</p><p>&gt; You are placing a false dichotomy before us: either love it, or make<br/>&gt; money at it. Ever considered that both are possible?</p><p>No, I&apos;m NOT placing a *false* dichotomy.  The dichotomy is not &quot;make<br/>money, or do it for love&quot; as you have grossly mis-stated it.  The<br/>dichotomy is &quot;demand money, or don&apos;t.&quot;  Never did I mention anything<br/>wrong with *accepting money*, which is a VERY different<br/>process/concept than *demanding* or *requiring* money.</p><p>&gt; Again, what&apos;s the value of a tomato or potato? You&apos;ll pay for those,<br/>&gt; no<br/>&gt; problem, you need to eat....but apparantly if no music were free,<br/>&gt; you&apos;d<br/>&gt; simply not listen to music, right?</p><p>Depends on the cost.  I&apos;d certainly listen to a lot less.  It&apos;s supply<br/>and demand, basic economics.  If music got too expensive to buy<br/>(which, for me, it frequently is), I&apos;d just make my own.  That&apos;s what<br/>people did before recorded music anyway.</p><p>&gt; Think about all the things you pay for more expensive than a 99cent<br/>&gt; download per day. What&apos;s happening is that the market is overcorrecting<br/>&gt; for the value of music in the opposite direction---it is undervalueing<br/>&gt; it. CDs were overpriced for years, mostly to line the pockets of record<br/>&gt; company execs and producers. Very little to the artist. And now you are<br/>&gt; telling me that the artists deserves it--nno---you are telling me that<br/>&gt; the artists&apos; fragile ego should be thankful that anyone is listening at<br/>&gt; all, and just accept that people will leech off of their existence.</p><p>It&apos;s not a matter of deserving things or what we should be &quot;thankful&quot;<br/>for.  The market is given.  As artists, we have choices: we can demand<br/>money and lose listeners, or we can give it away and reach as many<br/>ears as we can.  As I see it, if we already make the music for fun,<br/>i.e. the music would exist regardless of economic incentives, i.e. WE<br/>CAN ALREADY SUPPORT OURSELVES without charging for the music, why not<br/>make it free and reach as many people as we can?  It has nothing to do<br/>with putting the common good over our own good: the music is ALREADY<br/>valuable to us, whether it is part of an economy or not.  It&apos;s<br/>something we make for ourselves, so its very existence has worth to<br/>us.  So I don&apos;t even think of it as giving my music away for free.  In<br/>actuality, the act is not an act of giving, it&apos;s an act of allowing<br/>people to take.  I don&apos;t stand on a corner handing out CDs, I upload<br/>my music to free websites and let people come download it.</p><p>&gt; Bullshit. I don&apos;t know when you were born, but I was born in 1970,<br/>&gt; before the internet. When people wanted music, they bought a thing<br/>&gt; called an LP.<br/>&gt; Music started being free because people started giving it away, and<br/>&gt; because big labels stopped catering to niche tastes. It became all<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt; money. Big money.</p><p>Yeah, well in the 1970s--pre-internet--there was also EXPONENTIALLY<br/>more music going on in the world than you could hear about.  Finding<br/>out about new music was limited to record stores, radio, TV, and<br/>magazines--and for one to get one&apos;s music exposed through any of those<br/>mediums required a great deal more luck, effort, time, and promotion.<br/> Nowadays the amount of music that I can discover is functionally<br/>LIMITLESS.  Any jack ass with a computer and access the internet can<br/>create music and make it available to everyone else with a computer<br/>and access to the internet.  Being that I tend to encounter new<br/>artists at a rate of hundreds per week, if all of them charged money<br/>for their music, I would have to ignore vast amounts of them.</p><p>&gt; Plus, are you seriously saying you can&apos;t afford to buy a CD, ever?</p><p>Oh, I still buy CDs occasionally, of artists I really love...but only<br/>maybe 5 CDs every few months.  Not because I can&apos;t afford it, per se,<br/>but because it&apos;s such a luxury item and I have to ask myself: is this<br/>REALLY the best thing I can spend money on?  It usually isn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Again, the false dichotomy. And prospective listeners take what they<br/>are<br/>&gt; given. I&apos;m sure if everyone everywhere stopped giving away free music,<br/>&gt; it wouldn&apos;t be that all of a sudden no-one would be listening to any<br/>&gt; music, as you seem to think.</p><p>No, that is not what I think, and I never even suggested such a<br/>ridiculous extreme.  People would listen to LESS music, but not NO<br/>music.  And not even &quot;LESS&quot; music, they would still obviously spend<br/>the same amount of time listening, just to a smaller diversity of<br/>artists.  You can&apos;t possibly believe that people would intake the same<br/>quantity of new music if the price went up, can you?</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s this terrible idea that we&apos;ve been sold that as creators, it&apos;s our<br/>&gt; priviledge to be listened to, and that&apos;s enough. The consumer of free<br/>&gt; music enjoys the situation, and is not about to let the artist know<br/>that<br/>&gt; they are being taken advantage of. But for the artist to think this?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a sort of suicide, or at best a low-grade masochism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should a dentist provide free fillings? Should lawyers always work pro<br/>&gt; bono? Should potato farmers just give away their potatoes? You&apos;ve<br/>bought<br/>&gt; the myth of the worthless creator, hook, line, and sinker, just like<br/>the<br/>&gt; pigs who started it (the record labels and iTunes execs who take 90% of<br/>&gt; the royalties) want you to. *That* is what&apos;s sad to see.</p><p>Again, you have misunderstood and misrepresented my views, and made<br/>one REALLY inappropriate analogy.  Do dentists fix teeth for fun?  Do<br/>lawyers go to court for fun?  Do potato farmers farm for fun?  No,<br/>they don&apos;t.  Do musicians make music for fun?  Yes, they do.  A more<br/>proper analogy would be, if a potato farmer who grew for himself and<br/>his family ended up with more potatoes than his family could consume,<br/>should he give away the rest rather than let them rot into compost?<br/>YES!</p><p>And you haven&apos;t answered my question: if it was never possible for you<br/>to earn money making music, WOULD YOU STILL MAKE IT?</p></div><h3><a id=17783 href="#17783">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2007 2:48:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>there are all type of jobs where people have fun doing it!<br/>Barter is also an option though so you don&apos;t think it is about cash.

You&apos;ll pay for those,<br/>&gt; &gt; no<br/>&gt; &gt; problem, you need to eat....but apparantly if no music were free,<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; simply not listen to music, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Depends on the cost. I&apos;d certainly listen to a lot less. It&apos;s supply<br/>&gt; and demand, basic economics. If music got too expensive to buy<br/>&gt; (which, for me, it frequently is), I&apos;d just make my own. That&apos;s what<br/>&gt; people did before recorded music anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Think about all the things you pay for more expensive than a 99cent<br/>&gt; &gt; download per day. What&apos;s happening is that the market is overcorrecting<br/>&gt; &gt; for the value of music in the opposite direction---it is undervalueing<br/>&gt; &gt; it. CDs were overpriced for years, mostly to line the pockets of record<br/>&gt; &gt; company execs and producers. Very little to the artist. And now you are<br/>&gt; &gt; telling me that the artists deserves it--nno---you are telling me that<br/>&gt; &gt; the artists&apos; fragile ego should be thankful that anyone is listening at<br/>&gt; &gt; all, and just accept that people will leech off of their existence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not a matter of deserving things or what we should be &quot;thankful&quot;<br/>&gt; for. The market is given. As artists, we have choices: we can demand<br/>&gt; money and lose listeners, or we can give it away and reach as many<br/>&gt; ears as we can. As I see it, if we already make the music for fun,<br/>&gt; i.e. the music would exist regardless of economic incentives, i.e. WE<br/>&gt; CAN ALREADY SUPPORT OURSELVES without charging for the music, why not<br/>&gt; make it free and reach as many people as we can? It has nothing to do<br/>&gt; with putting the common good over our own good: the music is ALREADY<br/>&gt; valuable to us, whether it is part of an economy or not. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; something we make for ourselves, so its very existence has worth to<br/>&gt; us. So I don&apos;t even think of it as giving my music away for free. In<br/>&gt; actuality, the act is not an act of giving, it&apos;s an act of allowing<br/>&gt; people to take. I don&apos;t stand on a corner handing out CDs, I upload<br/>&gt; my music to free websites and let people come download it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bullshit. I don&apos;t know when you were born, but I was born in 1970,<br/>&gt; &gt; before the internet. When people wanted music, they bought a thing<br/>&gt; &gt; called an LP.<br/>&gt; &gt; Music started being free because people started giving it away, and<br/>&gt; &gt; because big labels stopped catering to niche tastes. It became all<br/>&gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; money. Big money.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, well in the 1970s--pre-internet--there was also EXPONENTIALLY<br/>&gt; more music going on in the world than you could hear about. Finding<br/>&gt; out about new music was limited to record stores, radio, TV, and<br/>&gt; magazines--and for one to get one&apos;s music exposed through any of those<br/>&gt; mediums required a great deal more luck, effort, time, and promotion.<br/>&gt; Nowadays the amount of music that I can discover is functionally<br/>&gt; LIMITLESS. Any jack ass with a computer and access the internet can<br/>&gt; create music and make it available to everyone else with a computer<br/>&gt; and access to the internet. Being that I tend to encounter new<br/>&gt; artists at a rate of hundreds per week, if all of them charged money<br/>&gt; for their music, I would have to ignore vast amounts of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Plus, are you seriously saying you can&apos;t afford to buy a CD, ever?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I still buy CDs occasionally, of artists I really love...but only<br/>&gt; maybe 5 CDs every few months. Not because I can&apos;t afford it, per se,<br/>&gt; but because it&apos;s such a luxury item and I have to ask myself: is this<br/>&gt; REALLY the best thing I can spend money on? It usually isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, the false dichotomy. And prospective listeners take what they<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; given. I&apos;m sure if everyone everywhere stopped giving away free music,<br/>&gt; &gt; it wouldn&apos;t be that all of a sudden no-one would be listening to any<br/>&gt; &gt; music, as you seem to think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, that is not what I think, and I never even suggested such a<br/>&gt; ridiculous extreme. People would listen to LESS music, but not NO<br/>&gt; music. And not even &quot;LESS&quot; music, they would still obviously spend<br/>&gt; the same amount of time listening, just to a smaller diversity of<br/>&gt; artists. You can&apos;t possibly believe that people would intake the same<br/>&gt; quantity of new music if the price went up, can you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s this terrible idea that we&apos;ve been sold that as creators, it&apos;s our<br/>&gt; &gt; priviledge to be listened to, and that&apos;s enough. The consumer of free<br/>&gt; &gt; music enjoys the situation, and is not about to let the artist know<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; they are being taken advantage of. But for the artist to think this?<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s a sort of suicide, or at best a low-grade masochism.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Should a dentist provide free fillings? Should lawyers always work pro<br/>&gt; &gt; bono? Should potato farmers just give away their potatoes? You&apos;ve<br/>&gt; bought<br/>&gt; &gt; the myth of the worthless creator, hook, line, and sinker, just like<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; pigs who started it (the record labels and iTunes execs who take 90% of<br/>&gt; &gt; the royalties) want you to. *That* is what&apos;s sad to see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, you have misunderstood and misrepresented my views, and made<br/>&gt; one REALLY inappropriate analogy. Do dentists fix teeth for fun? Do<br/>&gt; lawyers go to court for fun? Do potato farmers farm for fun? No,<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t. Do musicians make music for fun? Yes, they do. A more<br/>&gt; proper analogy would be, if a potato farmer who grew for himself and<br/>&gt; his family ended up with more potatoes than his family could consume,<br/>&gt; should he give away the rest rather than let them rot into compost?<br/>&gt; YES!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And you haven&apos;t answered my question: if it was never possible for you<br/>&gt; to earn money making music, WOULD YOU STILL MAKE IT?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=17787 href="#17787">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2007 4:33:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; there are all type of jobs where people have fun doing it!</p><p>It&apos;s not about whether you have fun, though.

Music,<br/>for me, has never been *work*.  It is, has, and hopefully will always<br/>be, a *leisure* activity.  It&apos;s what I do *for fun*.  Some people play<br/>sports, other people customize cars, other people collect stamps, etc.<br/>etc.  I make music.  It&apos;s my hobby.  I put time and money into it for<br/>no reason other than that I love it.  I feel indeed privileged to be<br/>able to take such a light-hearted view of this art when there are so<br/>many people that take it deadly serious.  I presumed that more people<br/>on this list viewed music as a hobby, or at least microtonal music as<br/>a hobby.  To get paid for your hobby strikes me as absurd--you&apos;re<br/>getting paid to play for yourself, basically, considering the<br/>negligible cost of making your music available for the enjoyment of<br/>others.  To demand to be paid for your hobby is...beyond absurd.  Art<br/>made for art&apos;s sake should not be a commodity.  Art made for the sake<br/>of commerce obviously IS and SHOULD BE (naturally) a commodity.</p></div>
