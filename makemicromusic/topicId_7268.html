I&apos;ve always thought the distinction very well encapsulated in the following:</p><p>&quot;One spring when I studied cooking with Simone Beck at her house in Provence, she said some things I never forgot. Another student, a caterer and cooking teacher, kept asking Simca for the technique for everything. She had a notebook and furiously wrote down every word Simca said. The other four of us were mainly interested in eating what we&apos;d prepared. When she asked one time too many, Simca said crisply, &quot;There *is* no technique, there is just the way to do it. Now, are we going to measure or are we going to cook?&quot;</p><p>Let&apos;s cook!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7272 href="#7272">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2004 1:35:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot;<br/>&lt;prentrodgers@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kyle Gann has a weblog where he posts interesting ideas about modern<br/>&gt; music, composers, musicians, and other topics of interest to a working<br/>&gt; critic, composer, microtonalist, and educator.</p><p>I think he misses the point about Brahm&apos;s jackass comment, since he<br/>recalls it as being in response to a claim that his first sonanta<br/>sounds like the Hammerklavier.
