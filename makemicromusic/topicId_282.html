OK.  Phunderphonia, in general, is predominantly what I would term a<br/>craft.  Taking some raw materials, one produces a woven tapestry.  There is<br/>certainly a modicum of creativity involved.  But to elevate that from a &quot;mere<br/>craft&quot; to an Art with a capital &quot;A&quot;, one should also produce the raw<br/>materials oneself.</p><p>I&apos;ve done various of these kinds of &quot;on tape&quot; works for 30 years, starting<br/>as a wee young-un with my first reel-to-reel tape recorder.  But I always use<br/>only raw material that I produce myself: with my own instruments playing my<br/>own music, with my friends, or recordings of live household sounds, or my own<br/>voice.  No rip-offs of other people&apos;s recorded material.</p><p>Here is a recent example, from October 2000, right about Halloween time.<br/>It&apos;s called &quot;Baked Alaska&quot;.  It&apos;s a very conservative piece in classic sonata<br/>allegro form, condensed into 2 minutes 14 seconds, using (of course) an<br/>entirely original text and my own voice.  No instruments of any kind were<br/>used; just my voice, manipulated with CoolEdit.  &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; begins with a<br/>brief introduction, followed by the thematic exposition.  There is only one<br/>theme, since it is, after all, such a brief movement.  There follows an<br/>extended thematic development using ONLY materials found in the exposition.<br/>The development is rounded off by the traditional recapitulation and a brief<br/>coda.</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/BakedAlaska.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/BakedAlaska.mp3</a></p><p>H-Ha-Ha-Happy L-Li-Li-Listening...</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=288 href="#288">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2001 5:04:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>D.

It&apos;s either amusing<br/>stuff or not.  But I do hold that what differentiates art from craft or even<br/>dabbling is in the degree of workmanship and the extent of workmanship --<br/>raw sweat and toil -- which is involved in the production of the end product.<br/> Not in the raw materials.  But there isn&apos;t necessarily much of a<br/>correlation between the interest or beauty of an end product for the<br/>viewer/listener and the amount of toil involved in making the product.</p><p>If I were going to argue, I would argue about degrees.  Certainly there is<br/>nothing black &amp; white.  But it&apos;s my opinion, which anyone is free _not_ to<br/>share, that there is a difference of degree here.  Art is on one end and<br/>Chaos is on the other.  But Chaos can also be amusing, viewed as Art.</p><p>&gt; If you accept that say the turntable is an instrument (I do), then<br/>&gt; it&apos;s kind of counterproductive to then say but only play your own LPs<br/>&gt; on it, or it ain&apos;t really real</p><p>I&apos;m not arguing whether the turntable is an &quot;instrument&quot; or not.  Certainly<br/>it is as much of a musical instrument as a garbage can, a file cabinet, a<br/>block of wood, etc.  Anyone is free to play it, or not; to listen to it, or<br/>not; to like it, or not.</p><p>My primary objection to much of the &quot;quotation phenomena&quot; is the plundering<br/>of extensive pieces of &quot;works clearly and recognizably copyright by other<br/>people&quot;.  And it is purely an aesthetic objection, based in my own personal<br/>respect for the social framework of law-making and law-keeping.  It has<br/>nothing to do with whether the end product is interesting or not.</p><p>We live in a culture which is obsessed with squeezing every possible penny<br/>of profit out of any piece of &quot;intellectual property&quot; no matter how small.<br/>It is increasingly controlled by large corporations and the lawyers thereof,<br/>and their special interest is in keeping as much stuff -- everything -- as<br/>tightly held as possible.  So that they can squeeze out that profit and<br/>increase their own riches.  I find _that_ far more abominable a practice than<br/>ripping off a few minutes of someone else&apos;s music -- with documented<br/>attribution -- for amusement and artistic expression.  In my mind,<br/>attribution and credit, as well as length and recognizability, and perhaps<br/>payment of micro-royalties, are what separates right from wrong in the realm<br/>of quotation.  And as always it is a continuum, ripe for legal sparring: in<br/>this case &quot;right&quot; being entirely within respectfulness of others&apos; property<br/>rights, &quot;wrong&quot; being blatantly outside it, or illegal.</p><p>I personally believe that most musical materials are part of the culture --<br/>the moreso the older they get -- and if, overall, intellectual property were<br/>not so jealously guarded, and we were not as a culture so litigious-minded,<br/>greedy, and arrogant... we would all as musicians and citizens be better off.<br/> If people could take these snippets or samples, then pay a little to a fund<br/>if they sold the products, that would be peachy, and everyone would probably<br/>benefit nicely.  But that&apos;s not the way it works in our modern society.<br/>Holders of intellectual property tend to guard it over-jealously, and<br/>over-long.</p><p>As long as I live in a culture that is so paranoid with regard to<br/>dissemination and use of intellectual properties, I will sidestep the issue<br/>by not becoming engaged in it.  If things are copyrighted by someone else,<br/>and the boundaries are so guarded by the rabid intellectual property-ists...<br/>Then I&apos;ll make my own stuff, and when opportunies arise, vote to change<br/>relevant laws.  Others can do what they like, and hold their own opinions.</p><p>&gt; I just don&apos;t get the &quot;that&apos;s not music --<br/>&gt; those aren&apos;t musicians&quot; type of paranoia!</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that at all.  Music is, stripped of all cultural biases,<br/>&quot;controlled sound pressure changes over a span of time&quot;, and people who<br/>produce that kind of spatio-temporal structure, with even the most<br/>rudimentary intelligence behind it, are called &quot;musicians&quot;.  Some of such<br/>spatio-temporal structures amuse me more than others.</p><p>Anyway, sorry this is a bit long, but I feel justified, since _I_ have<br/>already posted some &quot;music&quot; today. ;-)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=298 href="#298">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2001 7:11:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, August 04, 2001 5:04 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [MMM] Re: Plunderphonics</p><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>A lot of good points in this post, and I agree with many.</p><p>&gt; I personally believe that most musical materials are part of the<br/>culture --<br/>&gt; the moreso the older they get -- and if, overall, intellectual property<br/>were<br/>&gt; not so jealously guarded, and we were not as a culture so<br/>litigious-minded,<br/>&gt; greedy, and arrogant... we would all as musicians and citizens be better<br/>off.<br/>&gt;  If people could take these snippets or samples, then pay a little to a<br/>fund<br/>&gt; if they sold the products, that would be peachy, and everyone would<br/>probably<br/>&gt; benefit nicely.

Stearns asked (pertaining to another quote about my reaons for aesthetic<br/>objection to plunderphonia...):</p><p>&gt; Interesting (and well put), but it seems to contradict your other<br/>&gt; comments about art and &apos;not art&apos;,</p><p>In what way doest this contradict what other opinions?  I&apos;m not following, I<br/>think.  I have an opinion of what is &quot;Art&quot;; an opinion of &quot;what I would<br/>listen to&quot;, and another about what is &quot;Right&quot; to do with what materials<br/>because of legal or ethical questions, and so forth.</p><p>&quot;X&quot; doesn&apos;t have to be legal, or right, to be Art.  It doesn&apos;t have to be<br/>&quot;Art&quot; to be interesting or amusing.  It doesn&apos;t have to be legal to be Art.<br/>Etcetera.  These are orthogonal issues.  Think of a Venn diagram with several<br/>mutually intersecting circles, or an independent set of axes... The extent<br/>to which a piece unethically or illegally utilizes some raw materials is an<br/>axis independent of the axis of artistic worth.</p><p>For instance, I could find amusing or interesting a piece of stuff that I<br/>would consider &quot;Art&quot; which I may think was produced through unethical or<br/>illegal use of materials.  Would I produce such a piece myself?  I doubt it.<br/>Would I pay money for such a piece?  Possibly; it depends on how much I<br/>liked it.</p><p>Enough rant for the evening.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=315 href="#315">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2001 11:55:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mary asked...</p><p>&gt; Do you remember the techniques and plugins you used and care<br/>&gt; to share some of them?</p><p>Fairly straightforward techniques.
