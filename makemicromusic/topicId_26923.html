I think that it hasn&apos;t<br/>been progressive in years. Furthermore, I think that the music from<br/>the 90&apos;s that I really liked, much of which I would definitely<br/>consider progressive, is stuff that most people on here would probably<br/>think just plain sucks, so it&apos;s probably subjective.</p><p>I think it&apos;s a bit relative, and has to do with an asymmetry between<br/>these two processes that develop as one learns more Things:<br/><a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/assimacc.htm">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/assimacc.htm</a></p><p>Accommodation predominates for much of the beginning of life, or<br/>perhaps it could be better said that the two are in balance. At some<br/>point, however, one may start to develop the prideful notion that one<br/>has learned &quot;enough&quot; to make judgments about the world, at which point<br/>one starts assimilating things too much; discarding information for<br/>the sake of being able to conceptualize it in the half-formed schemata<br/>that one has so far. Then one may actually forget that one is doing<br/>this, which is almost like a complete failure of different<br/>higher-level cognitive functions to communicate with one another. The<br/>side effects of this may range from a drive to self-medicate with<br/>various substances on an individual level, a divide in taste for music<br/>on a generational level, and a push towards nuclear warfare on a<br/>species level. Well, maybe.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s my theory on why I hate Nickelback so much. Maybe some<br/>day I&apos;ll find a forward-thinking mailing list on the internet called<br/>philosophy and philosophy-math which will consist of a bunch of people<br/>trying to learn the theory put forward by a guy in his 20s who has<br/>since left the list, a wise mathematician who continues to explore<br/>more of the philosophical landscape while we struggle to figure it the<br/>meaning of it all, a scientifically-minded type who ensures that<br/>quality control is kept high, an occasional bunch of numerological new<br/>age cranks who like to talk about how the meaning of life is encoded<br/>in the many-worlds hypothesis of quantum mechanics, etc. And there<br/>will also be a community of enlightened individuals who are more into<br/>practice, and there will be a small divide between the practitioners<br/>and the theorists, which will have reached a peak divide a few years<br/>before I joined and who are slowly coming together because of guys<br/>with weird names like Electroencephalogram Smith. Until I find all<br/>that, I&apos;ll keep reading Kant and listening to Paul Simon and<br/>meditating on the sound of one hand clapping, which I&apos;m certain is the<br/>sound of you just taking your fingers and smacking them against the<br/>palm of the same hand.

This song appears to have two and one of those two only appears in the 30 second breakdown....plus the first/main theme is very very short and repetitive.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; To note...I don&apos;t mean progressive as in &quot;having acoustic and electronic instruments together&quot; IE the 90&apos;s electronica definition.&nbsp; Again I think such sub-genres are excessively categorized.</p><p>&nbsp; Usually, anything without at least two fairly evolved chord progressions tends to bug me.&nbsp; An example of two fairly evolved parts, to me, is the instrumental &quot;Offshore&quot; by Chicane <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAv2s4Q2wwI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAv2s4Q2wwI</a>.&nbsp; Another is &quot;Mindcircus&quot; by Way Out West <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfqiuEc3egA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfqiuEc3egA</a>.&nbsp; I usually have at least 3 distinct chord progressions in my own pieces.&nbsp; The idea is to take the listener on a journey, not &quot;have a party in one place&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Funny, I thought you&apos;d like it.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen to the above pieces/youtube links (which I do like) and note the difference of style.&nbsp; Yes they (vs. the pop song you posted) both have beats, they both use some electronic instruments (drum or otherwise)...but the similarities end there; and the links I posted, arguably, are not even vaguely pop but pure underground electronica (big difference).&nbsp; The Chicane one, at one time, was relatively popular music (in Europe only)...but it was not pop as in the genre &quot;pop&quot;.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2011 8:07:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

However I have nothing against &quot;popular music&quot; which, as Jake said, is a different beast entirely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is anything I do like that people often call &quot;pop&quot;, it&apos;s stuff like the Smashing Pumpkins (with is a mix of goth rock, shoegazing, grunge, new wave, metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock and some electronica (after their third album)), Blink 182 (which is really pure punk rock with more polished production), Guns and Roses (which is pure metal mixed with countless orchestral influences -&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbUC-UaAxE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbUC-UaAxE</a>) and underground electronica that just happens to be fairly popular (BT, some Chicane, Way Out West, some Hybrid, some Chemical Brothers, some Astral Projection (well, it&apos;s popular in Arab countries)...&nbsp; And all of the above are rather complex...pretty far from the formulaic melodic hook-basis of much &quot;pop&quot; genre music.</p><p>&nbsp; And, of course, I like the Beatles...but the Beatles took inspiration from so many genres I would hesitate to call them &quot;pop&quot;

Most obvious reason why not: both of the above DO have obvious multiple themes so far as the chords, if not also multiple main melodic themes.<br/>&nbsp; Neither of the songs you mentioned have both the chords and melodies, melodically speaking, enforcing the same main melody to be &quot;catchy&quot;.&nbsp; Rather, they have chords going in different progressing ways, presumably to add variety and &quot;tint&quot; the mood in different ways, rather than repeating the melody&apos;s theme.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I need to make a clarification...in POP (the genre), by and large, the melodic theme and chords follow each other IE the chords don&apos;t change to different themes...or, if they do, they only change very shortly IE for a few bars before reverting to the main &quot;catchy&quot; hook/theme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of the above songs you mentioned have a very long, evolving theme...even if it&apos;s a single one (at least in the case of &quot;Pachelbel&apos;s Canon in D&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Bolero&quot; has so many variations, extra notes and such thrown into in...I&apos;d hesitate to call it a single theme...while &quot;Canon in D&quot; rotates chords to the point that, while the melody repeats the same theme, the chords often don&apos;t.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;

of the piece dramatically between.</p><p>&nbsp; To also note, I by no means consider &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; pop (as in the genre), but definitely consider it &quot;popular music&quot;...and hopefully this will finally make it obvious to you what I see the difference between &quot;popular music&quot;

He hints to me that, perhaps, a similar sense of evolution could be obtained by using the same theme in different scales...hinting at similar production tricks with xentonality.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Producers take note...what he/Sash does by using timbre to change the mood is artsy as anything (at least to my ears)...and it&apos;s a rare example of &quot;formulaic pop&quot; that I actually enjoy.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2011 6:02:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

The first such doubling involves a horn playing the melody in C, while a celeste doubles it 2 and 3 octaves above and two piccolos play the melody in the keys of G and E, respectively. This functions as a reinforcement of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th overtones of each note of the melody. The other significant &quot;key doubling&quot; involves sounding the melody a 5th above or a 4th below, in G major. Other than these &quot;key doublings&quot;, Ravel simply harmonizes the melody using diatonic chords.</p><p>*****</p><p>I&apos;ll end with a personal note: while it might seem like the easiest task in the world to repeat that drum rhythm endlessly for 12+ minutes (it clocks in differently depending upon the conductor), it is one of the worst things to have to do. Not the concentration, or the control needed to go from ppp to fff over that long a time... no, it is because Every Single Entrance of the melody is a chance for that soloist to emote, which means slowing down.</p><p>The principal percussionist I played under for 25 years described it as trying to swim through an Olympic pool filled with 10-40 motor oil.

I&apos;m not in favor of changing musical terminology to reduce it down to meaningless levels. The word &quot;variation&quot; is used in many contexts in many subject areas, and can be used in many ways. When used in musical analysis and musical construction, it has developed a meaning over hundreds of years:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)</a></p><p>That the word can mean a lot of other things is evident:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(disambiguation)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(disambiguation)</a></p><p>I&apos;ll stick with something that has a concrete discretion to it. If you want to start using terms like &quot;surface changes&quot;, that is perfectly acceptable, and actually means something.</p></div>
