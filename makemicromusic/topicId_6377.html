I will post, if not tomorrow then certainly by the weekend, my intentions for where this list should be/focus, and in fact where it was intended from day one. Most all of it is quite clear from the home page of MMM in the preamble, but I will clarify as best I can.</p><p>And I&apos;m going to make it a web page, as well, so I can simply point to it in the future in case anyone is not clear on the reason this list lives.</p><p>Very best to you all,<br/>Jon / ListMom</p></div>
