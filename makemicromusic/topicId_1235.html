It&apos;s very energetic.  I resonate best early in the morning, when<br/>I&apos;m feeling most feisty.  Wow: what do I have to do to make _my_ voice<br/>sound like that?</p><p>I like the idea of making music that&apos;s kind of ... silly.  Musical, of<br/>course, but also silly.  Whimsical.

Helps to shake away a few cobwebs<br/>I feel.</p><p>I&apos;ve been spending a few days on the html newsgroup archiving<br/>program and not doing so much in the way of music recently,<br/>until today.</p><p>Just heard from <a href="http://mp3.com.au">mp3.com.au</a>. Or rather, just discovered an<br/>e-mail from them that had been sitting in my <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> folder<br/>since the 1st of this month (because of the way I set<br/>up my messages rules, and I hardly ever look in that folder<br/>as it is mostly adverts for music to listen to that isn&apos;t of<br/>very special interest to me).</p><p>I&apos;d uploaded the file in the wrong rate, 22 kHz instead<br/>of 44 khz. JUst uploaded it again today.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a few bug fixes to upload for FTS, prob. tomorrow<br/>as it is a bit late for today.</p><p>I realise that a bug I fixed on 6th Nove. will affect anyone<br/>who used the FTS Beta to record directly to midi file using a keyboard<br/>with aftertouch. It recorded any unrecognised midi events<br/>as two byte ones, which included aftertouch. That&apos;s okay<br/>when playing through the Windows API as Windows knows<br/>the appropriate number of bytes to send on and does<br/>it all automatically, and in fact always has two data bytes<br/>as arguments even if the second one is sometimes not used.</p><p>HOwever it is no good for the save to midi - the second data<br/>byte is treated as part of the delta time for the next event and<br/>causes glitches in playback.</p><p>So, if anyone has recorded to midi with aftertouch in FTS<br/>(not polyphonic aftertouch as that is two byte) they<br/>need to change the channel pressure messages all to one byte messages.</p><p>If desired I could write a little program to do that. Meanwhile,just<br/>added a tick box to FTS. When ticked, the retuning midi<br/>player will expect the channel pressure to be this two byte<br/>incorrect format and so will play them correctly.</p><p>One will then be able to re-record them in correct format<br/>in FTS too as it plays, since when ticked it will only read<br/>them as two bytes, and still save as the correct one byte messages.</p><p>I havent had any bug reports about it at all, but FTS users<br/>may like to check any clips they may have made by recording<br/>directly to midi in FTS from keyboard with aftertouch<br/>and not polyphonic aftertouch.</p><p>I&apos;ve also programmed the midi save now to deal with all<br/>the possible values for the status byte all with the<br/>correct number of data bytes, so it shouldn&apos;t happen again.</p><p>This goes right back to when I first programmed in the midi save<br/>in the beta, though it doesn&apos;t affect the release which<br/>doesn&apos;t have a save to midi as you play.</p><p>I&apos;ll do a post about it to the main list when I upload<br/>the fix for it.</p><p>Thanks for crediting Manuel and I as part of the band.<br/>It is nice to feel involved in the wonderful music<br/>you create.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
