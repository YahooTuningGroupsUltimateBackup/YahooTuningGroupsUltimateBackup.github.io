I see that the Yamaha CP1 provides a menu of alternate tunings, including Pythagorean. What this must mean is that eleven of the twelve fifths is 2 cents sharper than an equal tempered fifth... but then the last fifth must be 22 cents flat. I didn&apos;t see a mention in the CP1 user manual of which fifth was flat.</p><p>I was then charting out what just intonation should look like. For example in a C major scale, the series F-C-G-D would all be just tuned fifths. A-E-B would also be just tuned fifths. But the D-A interval would not be a just tuned fifth. Instead, it&apos;s the F-A, C-E, G-B intervals that are just major thirds, i.e. 14 cents flatter than equal tempered.</p><p>Starting say from F as a reference point, D would be 6 cents sharper than equal tempered, while A would be 14 cents flat. Thus the D-A interval is 20 cents flatter than equal tempered.</p><p>So that is my big AHA! Pythagorean tuning and just tuning are almost identical! They each have this funky flat fifth. In Pythagorean tuning, you try to avoid that flat fifth. In just tuning, it&apos;s that flat fifth that makes the major thirds just! OK, the exact size of that flat fifth is slightly different - about two cents. Hey, in Pythagorean tuning, one could just spread that two cents out across the eleven fifths so the twelfth fifth came out what&apos;s need for just thirds that cross that gap.</p><p>Here&apos;s a picture that might help:</p><p><a href="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/justpythagorean.jpg">http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/justpythagorean.jpg</a></p><p>I expect this has been observed a thousand times already... but it&apos;s a big surprise for me!</p><p>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=22866 href="#22866">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 6:55:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jim K&quot; &lt;kukulaj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/justpythagorean.jpg">http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/justpythagorean.jpg</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>Another way to interpret this picture - I have (re)discovered the schisma - 5 * (3**8) = 32805 is might close to 2**15 = 32768.</p><p>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=22867 href="#22867">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 7:37:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jim K&gt;&quot;In just tuning, it&apos;s that flat fifth that makes the major thirds just!<br/>OK, the exact size of that flat fifth is slightly different - about two cents.&quot;</p><p>   My two cents: the academic world seems to have made the whole 12TET vs.<br/>mean-tone vs. pythagorean tuning system differentiation very confusing when it<br/>is for the most part quite simple (unless you want to get deep into details on<br/>why it is the way it is mathematically).<br/>     I view it as either you have fairly flat fifths in a perfect circle (12TET)<br/>or all virtually perfect 5ths except one (Pythagorean or JI) or variations<br/>in-between (Mean-tone).</p><p>   What bugs me about it all is that to do this you end up with a fifth of<br/>around 40/27.

However, if you stack down 5 fifths<br/>from D you get Gb, a completely different pitch if you are stacking up a<br/>fifth other than 700 cents (like about 702 cents, i.e., the just fifth in<br/>Pythagorean tuning). If you are only given 12 notes to work with, you have<br/>to choose one versus the other. In one situation, the fifth above B will<br/>sound terrible because it will be Gb instead of F#, and in the other, the<br/>note a fourth above Db will sound terrible because you will be using F#<br/>instead of Gb. Given the opportunity to continue stacking up fifths however<br/>and use them all, you will not run into wolf fifths, because they are a<br/>product of *musical keyboards*; they are not inherent to the tuning itself.</p><p>John</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22874 href="#22874">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2010 4:24:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, John Moriarty &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; a just major scale could look like this:<br/>&gt; 1/1<br/>&gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; 5/4<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; 5/3<br/>&gt; 15/8</p><p>I&apos;m not sure exactly what John is responding to.

I see that the Yamaha CP1 provides a menu of alternate tunings,<br/>&gt; including Pythagorean. What this must mean is that eleven of the twelve<br/>&gt; fifths is 2 cents sharper than an equal tempered fifth... but then the last<br/>&gt; fifth must be 22 cents flat. I didn&apos;t see a mention in the CP1 user manual<br/>&gt; of which fifth was flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was then charting out what just intonation should look like. For example<br/>&gt; in a C major scale, the series F-C-G-D would all be just tuned fifths. A-E-B<br/>&gt; would also be just tuned fifths. But the D-A interval would not be a just<br/>&gt; tuned fifth. Instead, it&apos;s the F-A, C-E, G-B intervals that are just major<br/>&gt; thirds, i.e. 14 cents flatter than equal tempered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Starting say from F as a reference point, D would be 6 cents sharper than<br/>&gt; equal tempered, while A would be 14 cents flat. Thus the D-A interval is 20<br/>&gt; cents flatter than equal tempered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that is my big AHA! Pythagorean tuning and just tuning are almost<br/>&gt; identical! They each have this funky flat fifth. In Pythagorean tuning, you<br/>&gt; try to avoid that flat fifth. In just tuning, it&apos;s that flat fifth that<br/>&gt; makes the major thirds just! OK, the exact size of that flat fifth is<br/>&gt; slightly different - about two cents. Hey, in Pythagorean tuning, one could<br/>&gt; just spread that two cents out across the eleven fifths so the twelfth fifth<br/>&gt; came out what&apos;s need for just thirds that cross that gap.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a picture that might help:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/justpythagorean.jpg">http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r6/kukulaj/justpythagorean.jpg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I expect this has been observed a thousand times already... but it&apos;s a big<br/>&gt; surprise for me!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jim<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22879 href="#22879">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2010 7:40:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Try comparing 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3   15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; with          1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1.<br/>&gt; The first one doesn&apos;t sound &quot;right&quot;, second one does.</p><p>Thanks for your observations, Marcel.</p><p>I think what really draws me into all this is a fascination with the way tuning is intertwined with its musical use.

Going from C Major to G Major, it&apos;s just F that gets sharpened, the other 6 notes of the scale are unaltered. Similarly, with a Pythagorean tuning, at one time one might have D-A-E-...-F-C-G all perfect fifths, with G-D the flat fifth. Hit a switch, and just D gets sharpened by a Pythagorean comma, so now G-D is also a perfect fifth, but D-A becomes the flat fifth.</p><p>The broader class of non-Pythagorean JI opens up an infinite variety of choices one might make to pick 12 notes per octave. I am just exploring the switching game. Mostly folks would want to switch a selection of notes up or down a fifth, i.e. whatever role was played by the C note in one choice might now be played by F. What&apos;s fun is to think through - in making that shift of harmonic relationships, one or more notes can keep the same pitch - it&apos;s like the fixed reference point of the tuning switch. It&apos;s just an added dimension to the tuning puzzle - how two tunings might best be related, if one is switching from one to another on the fly in performance.</p><p>&gt; And one would need to indicate with the score of<br/>&gt; when the switches must happen.</p><p>Yes, exactly, just like a convention change of key signature.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=22891 href="#22891">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2010 7:41:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jim K&quot; &lt;kukulaj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; My current exploration of 53-edo is very much not JI.

There are classical temperaments other than<br/>&gt; 12tet with a solid history of use. There are non-European scales. Then there<br/>&gt; are folks like Harry Partch or La Monte Young or Michael Harrison. OK, none<br/>&gt; of these are mainstream, but I don&apos;t care much about mainstream! I just like<br/>&gt; building bridges between theory and practice... exploring new musical<br/>&gt; possibilities.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t know about Partch etc. Better not get into that before I get<br/>the list angry at me again hehe :)</p><p>But you&apos;re right about temperaments other than 12tet.<br/>They can make music slightly more in tune overall (or slightly more out of<br/>tune).<br/>I was thinking more along the lines of JI or Pythagorean with what I said.</p><p>&gt; Ah, thanks, I didn&apos;t know about pianoteq. That looks interesting. I see<br/>&gt; that I can load a scala file to tweak the tuning. Do you know, can I somehow<br/>&gt; flip from one tuning to another on the fly with pianoteq?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t think that&apos;s possible with pianoteq.<br/>However, if I&apos;m correct the new version of pianoteq will respond correctly<br/>to pitch bends (thanks to h-pi talking to them), and then one could use for<br/>instance Scala to do the tuning for pianoteq with MIDI relay, and use Scala<br/>to do the switching.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I am trying to do is to leave as many of the 12 notes the same across<br/>&gt; any particular switch. Maybe just switch one of the 12, or anyway as few as<br/>&gt; possible. It&apos;s like a key change. Going from C Major to G Major, it&apos;s just F<br/>&gt; that gets sharpened, the other 6 notes of the scale are unaltered.<br/>&gt; Similarly, with a Pythagorean tuning, at one time one might have<br/>&gt; D-A-E-...-F-C-G all perfect fifths, with G-D the flat fifth. Hit a switch,<br/>&gt; and just D gets sharpened by a Pythagorean comma, so now G-D is also a<br/>&gt; perfect fifth, but D-A becomes the flat fifth.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Aah ok yes that would be the way to switch I think so too.<br/>Btw I belief there&apos;s also a script available for the Kontakt sampler written<br/>by a tuning list member that implements this way of switching.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Marcel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22929 href="#22929">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2010 8:37:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 30 Aug 2010, at 11:21 PM, Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; berg did not become the poster boy, webern did.</p><p>???</p><p>&gt; can you suggest some music you find interesting based on &quot;intervals<br/>&gt; and rows created from certain selected intervals only&quot;?</p><p>This quotation looks strange when it&apos;s put together this way.

Correct me if I&apos;m wrong but I don&apos;t see a whole<br/>&gt; lot being done using irregular temperaments and multiple generators before then<br/>&gt; (before then, as I&apos;ve seen, it&apos;s been by and large about taking circles formed<br/>&gt; by a single generator).  The option of creating scales by comparing errors of 1)<br/>&gt; individual dyads or 2) triads or greater ALA adaptive JI just were not around to<br/>&gt; the best of my knowledge.   Another example: Sethares &quot;tuning to timbre&quot;<br/>&gt; algorithm in the Basic and Matlab programming languages: implementing such a<br/>&gt; proof of concept I strongly suspect would take ages without computers.&quot;</p><p>Mark: I was thinking on a longer time scale and greater width of geography. Although I don&apos;t always trust what I read of music history, there used to be a tuning system called &quot;Ordinair&quot; in which the musician tunes 12 notes to a meantone such as quarter comma or six comma, then, leaving 7 notes unchanged as a major scale, retunes the other notes individually to give more please harmonies when modulating to other keys. This is a general technique rather than a specific scale, but it gives irrular temperaments with up to 7 different sizes of fifth and was popular before the time of Johan Sebastian Bach.</p><p>Bach and other musicians such as Kimberger and Werckmeister developed more irregular temperaments, such as the &quot;Well temperaments&quot; used for Bach&apos;s &quot;The Well Tempered Clavier&quot;.</p><p>Mechanical computers such as the one I made can be used to make complicated arithmatic visual in a way that makes it much easier to understand.

I found<br/>&gt; &gt;that this mechanical computer made a difficult problem easy to solve. People<br/>&gt; &gt;could use wood or other materials instead of cardboard. I am tempted to make<br/>&gt; &gt;another mechanical computer to solve your 7 note problem (with 7 disks) or to<br/>&gt; &gt;attempt to solve the 12 note problem (with 12 disks).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Michael: Fascinating...now how to these discs work exactly?  I&apos;d be fascinated to see<br/>&gt; what such a system comes up as the answers for 7 and 12 discs.  Your above<br/>&gt; problem doesn&apos;t sound to hard as it&apos;s optimizing the accuracy of &quot;just&quot; interval<br/>&gt; sizes.  My computer program, meanwhile, considers all interval sizes: second<br/>&gt; (major/minor), third (major/minor), fourth, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>Mark: Basically, it works like a slide rule: You mark a reference point on each disk (In my picture, this is a filled in circle with another circle arroung it), then mark intervals relative to this point, as fractions of an octave, so a 12 tet minor third is 90 degrees, and a just 5/4 major third is about 115.89 degrees and so on. What intervals you mark out depends on what problem you are trying to solve. A more permanent system would be to have disks marked out in cents, or with almost all commonly used intervals and then have movable colour markers.</p><p>Moving one disk relative to another shows how the intervals fit together.</p><p>To solve your 7 note problem, each disk would be marked out with all the intervals you find acceptable (such as 15/14, 16/15, 10/9 and so on) aswell as the ones you desire (such as 6/5, 5/4, 7/5 and 3/2). The disks could also be marked out with an area fo 7 cents or so each side of every interval (but not the reference point).</p><p>Then, slide the disks relative to each other to some starting point (For example a natural major scale, so the reference points on the disks would be seperated by the intervals tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone).</p><p>Next, you move the disks relative to each other while observing how the reference point on each disk matches up with the desired and acceptable intervals on the other disks.</p><p>If you can make all the reference points fit into desired or accpetable areas on all the other disks then you have solved the problem.</p><p>You can then measure the angles, or, if the disks are marked out in cents, read off the intervals directly.</p><p>It might help to explain things if I filmed the process, but I have returned my best camera to the shop to have it fixed.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Mark: The intonation known as Quarter Comma Meantone, when limitted to 7 notes,<br/>&gt; &gt;meets the requirements you list (all dyad intervals within 7 cents of the pure<br/>&gt; &gt;intervals 16/15, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5). It is directly derived from<br/>&gt; &gt;Pythagorean intonation. You just flatten all of the &quot;perfect&quot; fifths from 3/2 to<br/>&gt; &gt;the fourth root of 5.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Alas, that assumes a single generator.  The funny thing is, looking at the<br/>&gt; numbers, the two (1/4 comma and my scale) do seem to be within a few cents of<br/>&gt; each other so, I stand corrected, they are virtually the same scale.  I knew the<br/>&gt; two had somewhat similar numbers...but had no idea they were that<br/>&gt; close...especially since that same program also came up with the completely<br/>&gt; different answer</p><p>Mark: I appologise. I myself was wrong here. Whereas Quarter Comma does approximate to the intervals 16/15 (or better still, 17/14), 6/5, 5/4, 4/3 and 7/5 (and their respective 7ths, 3rds and 5ths), very well, it fails when it comes to the intervals 9/8 and 10/9. The 7 note quarter comma tone is halways between 10/9 and 9/8, making it wrong by 11 and a half cents.</p><p>Your scale approximates the tones better and has better minor 3rds, while having almost as good major thirds. I have very much enjoyed exploring the mathematics of your scale. I would write more but I am running out of time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------best dyad combination scale for not allowing half-steps (wider intervals<br/>&gt; only for better critical band dissonance ratings)----------<br/>&gt; 1.12<br/>&gt; 1.2222<br/>&gt; 1.338<br/>&gt; 1.5<br/>&gt; 1.674<br/>&gt; 1.83<br/>&gt; 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Mark: I find the challenge very exciting.

You can give an exact<br/>&gt; mathematical expression for the fraction of a comma that 12 edo subtracts from<br/>&gt; the pure 3/2 fifth).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Michael:    What bugs me about it all is that to do this you end up with a fifth<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; around 40/27.   Which isn&apos;t just sour, but so sour that (at least to me), it&apos;s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; virtually unusable.  Same goes with the tri-tone and sour 6th that result from<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it in the 7 note scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark: for my taste the pythagorean wolf 5th (almost 2 cents flatter than 40/27)<br/>&gt; is still usable, but I have unusual tastes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Michael:     I&apos;ve experimented with using several different size slight sharp or<br/>&gt; flat<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5ths within a scale to maximize the average purity of all possible dyads.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Technically the result is an &quot;irregularly tempered scale&quot; as calculated by<br/>&gt; &gt;a<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; computer by scanning all possible dyad constructions of a 7-note scale and<br/>&gt; &gt; looking for one that gives all nearly-pure dyads.  Note musicians in the<br/>&gt; &gt; pre-computer era would have had a tough time doing it this way...and I&apos;m fairly<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; sure the result can&apos;t be easily reduced back to something near &quot;Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark: When exactly was the &quot;pre computer era&quot;? People have been using mechanical<br/>&gt; computers for millennia. I personally made myself a mechanical computer that was<br/>&gt; 4 cardboard disks which was a great help in solving a related problem of how to<br/>&gt; have 8 pure 5/4 major thirds in all possible patterns in a system of 12 notes<br/>&gt; while reducing the deviations from 3/2 fifths as much as possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Link to picture of my mechanical computer:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=6942582&l=48e6b494aa&id=536589255">http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=6942582&l=48e6b494aa&id=536589255</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the picture, the computer is being used to solve the problem of how to<br/>&gt; arrange the notes to allow pure major thirds with roots on the notes E, G, G# A,<br/>&gt; B flat, B, C# and D, while reducing deviations from just 3/2 fifths.

It sounds a bit like<br/>adaptive JI in some ways.  But it does indeed follow the same up to &quot;7 different<br/>sizes of fifth&quot; logic my program does.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Bach and other musicians such as Kimberger and Werckmeister developed  more<br/>&gt;irregular temperaments, such as the &quot;Well temperaments&quot; used for  Bach&apos;s &quot;The<br/>&gt;Well Tempered Clavier&quot;.&quot;<br/>I looked at the Wiki for it and it seems to say<br/>     &quot;The syntonic comma was distributed between four intervals, with most of<br/>the comma accommodated in the sol&sharp; to mi&flat; diminished sixth, which expands to<br/>nearly a minor sixth. It is this  interval that is usually called the &quot;wolf&quot;,<br/>because it is so far out of  consonance.&quot;<br/>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_temperament</a></p><p>     ...in other words (same problem I noted before): the consonance/dissonance<br/>is not evenly distributed at all.  1/4 comma mean-tone indeed seems evenly<br/>distributed (perhaps a lucky fluke...since it appears to seek to optimize the<br/>lowest possible maximum dissonance between thirds and fifths AKA &apos;mini-max<br/>dissonance&apos; and ends up also optimizing several other intervals &apos;by chance&apos;).<br/>So it seems 1/4 comma mean-tone has one part of the puzzle (&apos;mini-max&apos;) and<br/>well-tempered the other (&apos;irregular tempering&apos;)...but neither has both.  Plus<br/>1/4 comma, if I understand it well, misses mini-max in a way because the octave<br/>is well over 7 cents off if you keep just multiplying that 1/4 comma-off fifth.</p><p>     Again my point becomes...it seems very hard if not virtually impossible to<br/>make scales with optimum mini-max dyadic dissonance among all intervals without<br/>using irregular temperament and doing so in a way that calculates all possible<br/>dyads against all others without using a computer since there are so many<br/>possibilities when you deal with alternating generators (IE 1.494 * 1.51 * 1.5 *<br/>etc.).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Also, competent musicians can tune the strings of a harp or a zither, or  the<br/>&gt;pipes of an organ, or the frets of a lute, to the intervals of an  irregular<br/>&gt;temperament by ear without having to bother with the  arithmatic at all.  &quot;</p><p>  I can believe it.  But that still doesn&apos;t seem to explain how one can run a<br/>dyadic comparison/optimization among, say, about 50 possible dyads within a two<br/>octave range for a 7-tone scale.   As I understand it 1/4 comma meantone only<br/>does the &quot;mini-max&quot; dyadic optimization between the 5th and 3rd...so that&apos;s two<br/>variables instead of 50.  So I pity the fool who has to calculate the &quot;optimum<br/>limit&quot; on all 50 by hand (possible yes...but very very time consuming)...and<br/>have my doubts anyone in history would have the patience to do so and/or<br/>construct and equation set clever enough to greatly simplify the problem.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Moving one disk relative to another shows how the intervals fit<br/>&gt;together.&quot;...&quot;If you can make all the reference points fit into desired or<br/>&gt;accpetable  areas on all the other disks then you have solved the problem.&quot;<br/>    Ah so if two lines on two disks are greater than a certain rotation % apart<br/>you know they are off tune....say....more than 8 cents off?  Makes sense...but<br/>it seems you&apos;d still be drawing lines somewhat at random and re-calculating the<br/>fractional/&quot;just intonation&quot; values for each until you found something that<br/>visually matches.  So it seems to quickly tell you how well a scale works but<br/>not how to make a scale the works well...so to speak.  That echoes the &quot;If you<br/>can make all the reference points fit into desired or acceptable  areas&quot;<br/>statement you made.</p><p>   Funny thing...my program does almost exactly the same process...only it<br/>solves the &quot;random reference points&quot; issue by running a loop of all possible<br/>reference points &quot;for each disk&quot; (say, it has 5th values n1*n2...*n7 with each n<br/>ranging from 3/2 minus 7 cents to 3/2 plus 7 cents independently).<br/>  By hands I could imagine it could take hours or more.  By having the computer<br/>loop through all possible values, it takes less than a minute.  I cheat. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;Mark: I appologise. I myself was wrong here. Whereas Quarter Comma does<br/>&gt;approximate to the intervals 16/15 (or better still, 17/14), 6/5, 5/4,  4/3 and<br/>&gt;7/5 (and their respective 7ths, 3rds and 5ths), very well, it  fails when it<br/>&gt;comes to the intervals 9/8 and 10/9. The 7 note quarter  comma tone is halways<br/>&gt;between 10/9 and 9/8, making it wrong by 11 and a  half cents.&quot;<br/>   Actually, I somewhat ignored seconds in my program/scale as well as I&apos;ve<br/>found that I can barely hear a difference between 10/9 and 9/8 and everything in<br/>between.  But it&apos;s interesting they apparently came out better nonetheless. :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;Your scale approximates the tones better and has better minor 3rds,  while<br/>&gt;having almost as good major thirds. I have very much enjoyed  exploring the<br/>&gt;mathematics of your scale. I would write more but I am  running out of time.&quot;<br/>    Well it should be impossible to achieve a lower mini-max than that scale<br/>assuming the alternative generators (hence irregular temperament) must be within<br/>8 cents of 3/2...because the program reviews all possible errors of all possible<br/>7-tone scales using that generator range and compares the results of all dyads<br/>to find the minimax.

So if<br/>you use the octave as a period and &quot;adjust&quot; that last fifths, you don&apos;t end up<br/>destroying the dyadic relationships that note has with other notes.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23018 href="#23018">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2010 12:10:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;What you&apos;re missing is that in 1/4-comma meantone, you don&apos;t have just<br/>&gt;one generator.

That seems to be the gist of<br/>&gt; &gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;No. A meantone is anything where 81/80 is eliminated.&quot;<br/>&gt;    When I said meantone I meant short for (1/4 comma) Meantone.  As in quarter<br/>&gt; comma meantone is a 31-tone scale, not a 12-tone scale.</p><p>But quarter-comma meantone is not a 31-tone scale- it&apos;s not a scale at all, it&apos;s a temperament. Historical meantone scales were generated but going up and down a half-dozen fifths, octave-reducing when desired of course. Or down a few fifths and up a few more from a central tone; there are different schemes. There&apos;s also another by-ear way of tuning a quarter-comma meantone scale using mostly Just thirds. You don&apos;t have to go to twelve notes, and you don&apos;t have to stop at twelve, either. Handel&apos;s organ supposedly had 4 extra keys to the octave, probably 16 tones of quarter-comma meantone (don&apos;t know if anyone knows for sure how he tuned). At any rate, having split keys is a typically meantone thing, increases your number of key signatures with Just intervals.</p><p>Notice that there is a direct comparison with the &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; and historical quarter-comma meantone practice. For example there are 21, 31, and so on, tone scales of &quot;Miracle temperament&quot;. Taking Miracle out all the way to where it reasonably closes will give you a scale that&apos;s realistically indistinguishable from 72 equal divisions of the octave, just as taking quarter-comma meantone all the way out to where it realistically closes will give you a scale very close to 31 equal divisions of the octave. Also notice that 72 equal divisions of the octave is not Miracle, and 31-edo is not quarter-comma meantone. You could for whatever reason have a temperament which was based on 8/7 tempered a tiny bit sharp (just an example). Let&apos;s say you tempered it a cent sharp, because you dig the extra slow beating, whatever, and took it out all the way (modulo 2) to where it realistically speaking closes. You&apos;d be even closer, much closer, to 31-edo than quarter-comma meantone is. So is 31-edo an &quot;8/7 system&quot;? No. 31 is not an 8/7 system, and it&apos;s not a meantone system. You can just use it those ways, and other ways.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The octave isn&apos;t &quot;generated&quot; by 31 fifths. The octave counts as a -separate-<br/>&gt; &gt;generator. Separate.&quot;<br/>&gt;   I get that.  Essentially taking 31 1/4 comma mean-tone fifths almost 100%<br/>&gt; meets the octave...but not quite (misses by a fraction of a cent, as Cameron<br/>&gt; said).</p><p>That&apos;s not what I said. It is just- as I said- your leftover &quot;wolf&quot; fifth happens to be just that amount wide of the generating (1/4-comma flat) fifth so as to handily be practically identical to a Just fifth.</p><p> Using the octave as a separate generator makes it 100% perfect.  I &gt;was<br/>&gt; getting at that it appears the reason it works so well is the 31 &gt;fifths<br/>&gt; &quot;essentially&quot; generate the octave....meaning they get darn close to &gt;it.<br/>&gt; So if<br/>&gt; you use the octave as a period and &quot;adjust&quot; that last fifths, you don&apos;t end up<br/>&gt; destroying the dyadic relationships that note has with other notes.</p><p>So, it&apos;s like hands going around the face of the clock in jumps of a certain amounts of hours. Depending on how many hours the hands jump, you may or may not wind up eventually hitting all the hours. Jumps of six hours will hit just 12 and 6 repeatedly, and nothing else, on a 12-hour clock. The 12-tone tritone will do the same- tritone, octave, forever. It&apos;s not a generator. Jumps of five hours will hit every hour and return to twelve. In equal divisions of the octave, it&apos;s the scale steps which are coprime numbers (numbers made of different primes, like 12 is made of 2 and 3 while 5 is a prime) which will do this, which means you&apos;re set when your equal division of octave is itself a prime, for every scale step will eventually generate the entire thing.<br/>Only steps 1, 5, 7 and 11 will do this in 12-edo, for all other steps share primes with 12. 31 is a prime, and a pretty big number as far as number of tones, so you see it could be generated by a big pile of different intervals and that it is especially silly to say &quot;it&apos;s a meantone&quot;. The only way you can say that is to take the Harry Partch stance that all equal temperaments are Pythagorean in nature, which is pure bullshit, as many equal temperaments are not generated by an approximate fifth, and many can be generated by a huge number of alternative, non-Pythagorean, intervals.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=23281 href="#23281">ðŸ”—</a>Mark &#x3C;mark.barnes3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2010 7:57:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mark:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;As for the 7ths, this maybe just how I think (pitches in a circle with  one<br/>&gt; &gt;revolution equalling an octave, instead of a straight line), but it  seems to me<br/>&gt; &gt;that if you don&apos;t care about the accuracy of 9/8 and 10/9  then you also don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;care about the accuracy of 16/9 and 9/5.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Michael:    That assumption seems to assume a constant interval size for the second, so<br/>&gt; that any 6th plus any second in the scale can be added to produce a single size<br/>&gt; of 7th, for example.<br/>&gt;   Mine has no such constant size, hence it is an &gt;&gt;irregular&lt;&lt; temperament.</p><p>Mark: No. It doesn&apos;t assume a constant interval size for the major 2nd.

As for the others, they vary.  For example one of the other &quot;9/5&apos;s&quot; may<br/>be more like 11/6...in which case 2/1 over 11/6 is 12/11 and not 10/9.  I<br/>understand the &quot;octave inverse of 7th = second&quot; idea, but am quite sure it<br/>doesn&apos;t apply to my scale as the 7ths vary in size and, thus...so do the &quot;octave<br/>inverse&quot; seconds.</p><p>   Also (again going back to a mistake I made a while ago concerning how I<br/>though 1/4 comma meantone was generated), the scale I created does not have two<br/>consistent generators as mean-tone has a slightly flat 5th and a 2/1 as separate<br/>constant generators.</p><p>  The bizarre thing, again, is that 1/4 comma meantone acheives a very similar<br/>overall result to my scale despite being generated through constant generators.<br/>Correct me if I&apos;m wrong but it appears to try and &quot;balance&quot; between a pure third<br/>and fifth, thus making incredibly pure triads possible.
