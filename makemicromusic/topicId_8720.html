Out of curiosity, what hardware/software are you using?</p><p>BTW, I played your Klingon tune last night for my 14yo daughter, and she dug it.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Bill Sethares wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello Microtonalites,<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve just put up a newish piece -- as with some of my<br/>&gt; other recent things it is done adaptively, though this &gt; one evolves more slowly than most...

The time-stretched drums are great, they<br/>totally add to the unnatural feel...the whole song feels stretched<br/>and &quot;extrapolated&quot; to me.  It reminds me of being stuck in<br/>traffic...all that sliding around is like trying to get in the fast<br/>lane but then having it slow down as soon as you get into it.  It&apos;s<br/>very clever in that it reminds me of feeling frustrated without<br/>actually frustrating me.</p><p>-Igliashon</p></div><h3><a id=8782 href="#8782">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

I found it creepy, not maximally creepy, but moderately creepy.</p><p>I&apos;d really like for you to re-do this piece, in a version where the tempo was 1/2 the original so that the moves between notes were still slow (I really LIKE it in adaptive pieces when you can hear the adaption going on), but with the percussion recorded in 1/1 time - the time stretching robs the attack transients of any kind of power they have. Creepy, but powerless.</p><p>Funny how forging yourself into a different tempo can alter your musical similarities. I found it both difficult and rewarding when I did a number of pieces for one particular choreographer: she worked out choreography to tempos and meters (a LOT of mixed meters) and then after she had finished some part or all of the choreography she gave me the tempos and meters and said &quot;write some music for this&quot;. It usually ended up as &apos;me&apos;, but in differing ways than &apos;I&apos; would normally do. Pretty creepy.</p><p>Did I mention your piece was creepy? :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=9006 href="#9006">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2005 9:42:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>this reminds me of McLaren&apos;s music quite a bit<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Sethares&quot;<br/>&lt;sethares@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Microtonalites,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve just put up a newish piece -- as with some of my<br/>&gt; other recent things it is done adaptively, though this<br/>&gt; one evolves more slowly than most...
