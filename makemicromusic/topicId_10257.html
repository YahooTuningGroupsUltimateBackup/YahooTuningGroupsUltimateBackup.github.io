The idea is to have a<br/>continuing<br/>sound rich enough to defy easy analysis into particular pitches; and from<br/>this sound, to periodically subtract one or more of the partials.  This is<br/>the<br/>opposite of the usual compositional procedure, whereby we add sounds to<br/>silence.  It&apos;s a negative, rather than a positive composition.  In a wall of<br/>sound rich enough, I suspect it may take quite a bit of practice to even<br/>begin hearing a &quot;negative melody&quot; or &quot;anti-melody&quot; - and even more to hear<br/>&quot;anti-harmonies&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.15/82 - Release Date: 25/8/05</p></div><h3><a id=10277 href="#10277">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Sethares &#x3C;sethares@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2005 12:51:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to Jon and Kraig and Yahya (among others)<br/>who replied with thoughts about the mappings to 65 Hz...<br/>Jon wrote:<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t readily imagine how this expands into more wide-spread<br/>&gt; compositions.

In the first, all<br/>&gt; the partials are moved (as before) to multiples of 65 Hz.<br/>&gt; The piece is also slowed down significantly.

I like both<br/>of them, particularly the first one.</p><p>The era of electronics conferred new dimensions of possibilities on<br/>the &quot;thema and variatons&quot; idea. The theme can be an entire piece of<br/>music, whether traditional or newly-composed and from any source -<br/>or for that matter any source of found or generated sound. The<br/>variations can be various electronic manipulations of the course<br/>sounds. I am imagining the first part of a straight rendition of<br/>Maple Leaf Rag followed by a series of Bill&apos;s &quot;experiments&quot; on it,<br/>ending up with the original again.</p><p>Here is another idea for those of you who, unlike me, are actually<br/>making micro music. This is inspired by Bill&apos;s &apos;many tet&apos; example.<br/>Take some equal temperaments, say 12-, 13-, 15-, 17- and 19-tone for<br/>example, and combine them. Play with this set of pitches in a way<br/>that seems fun to you, until you discover some favorite<br/>simultaneities and sequences. Then derive a scale featuring the<br/>subset of tones that underlie your favorite passages and use those<br/>as well as your favorite segments to create a fully-realized<br/>composition. (Possibly some of you have done this already.)</p><p>This is all manifestly so much fun that I wish I could play too -<br/>maybe someday; meanwhile, thanks for letting me watch and listen to<br/>you all working and playing.</p><p>Regards,<br/>George</p></div><h3><a id=10304 href="#10304">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Sethares &#x3C;sethares@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2005 2:28:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the comments and thoughts about the recent<br/>pieces.</p><p>Kraig wrote:</p><p>&gt; i can&apos;t say i hear the rag in the first one, but the second one reminds<br/>a bit of the stretching and compressing i have heard with short ways<br/>that is just slightly out of tune...<br/>In Example how some of the different notes in the original get<br/>compressed into unisons.</p><p>Indeed -- there are choices that must be made when doing such mappings<br/>-- for instance, if two source partials want to be mapped to<br/>the same destination frequency then you need to decide whether<br/>to do one, the other, or to somehow combine them.<br/>In most of the experimentation so far, I have just used the<br/>simple rule: map the largest (in amplitude) and drop the<br/>smaller one.</p><p>Kraig continued:</p><p>&gt;I kind of like the more aggressive use of say the harmonic series here.<br/>It sounds like what de Sade might have done with it, with what sounds so<br/>much like whipping going on.</p><p>Thanks -- I like the image of the Marquis de Sound<br/>perverting the harmonic series -- though I suppose this<br/>should be reserved for those that do violate the<br/>harmonic series!</p><p>Paul wrote about SlowTick65:</p><p>&gt; I actually would have been *shocked* if that one *didn&apos;t*<br/>come from a recording of human vocals.</p><p>I&apos;m not too surprised because parts of it do retain the<br/>vocal qualities... the reason I was responding was because<br/>Kraig thought he heard the voice say &quot;peace now&quot; where it was<br/>saying &quot;tick tock&quot;! BTW -- have you heard Diana Deutch&apos;s<br/>latest illusions? One channel contains a voice repeating<br/>some phrase. The other channel contains the same phrase<br/>but with a variety of (short) time shifts. What is fascinating<br/>is that when you listen to it you can hear many many different<br/>words and phrases being spoken, even though they are not<br/>&quot;actually&quot; present. Perhaps Kraig&apos;s &quot;peace now&quot; is of this same<br/>ilk...</p><p>Geroge wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m listening to the mutations of Joplin at the moment.
