I&apos;ve long enjoyed Persian classical music (I<br/>purchased my first CD of this lovely music in 1988), and frequently<br/>return to the study of its modes and rhythms. I wish to so absorb the<br/>use of modality  -- &quot;pan-modality&quot; in the widest sense, in whatever<br/>scale and tuning I use -- that it becomes an integral part of my musical<br/>thought and language.</p><p>I&apos;m pleased that the fruits of my studies, and their incorporation into<br/>my works, haven&apos;t gone un-noticed by those intimately familiar with the<br/>source!</p><p>Best,</p><p>jls</p></div>
