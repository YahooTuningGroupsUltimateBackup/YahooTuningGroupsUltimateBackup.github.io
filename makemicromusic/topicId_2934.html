It&apos;s probably something I should<br/>know...</p><p>Anyway, I just mean by &quot;pop&quot; the kind of rhythmic regularity that<br/>kicks in at about 16 seconds into the piece, after the intro where<br/>the various sounds are &quot;let ring&quot; a bit.</p><p>At 16 seconds a &quot;beat&quot; kicks in and there is certainly nothing wrong<br/>with that.  In fact, most people would probably like the piece better<br/>*because* of that.</p><p>So, I&apos;m not suggesting there is anything wrong with the piece at all.</p><p>I was just saying, I would be interested in a version that went the<br/>*other* direction, perhaps making longer time spans with the more<br/>consonant sounds, *without* the repetitive percussion beat.  I<br/>realize there is little harmonic motion there, but there is still<br/>*lots* of variation possible.</p><p>A good example is the recent post by Jacky Ligon, the _Tritonica_.<br/>There was almost *no* harmonic motion in that piece; it was<br/>incredibly static.  However, it still held interest in the timbral<br/>variations.</p><p>You initial premise, up to 16 seconds was *so* interesting that it<br/>prompted me to want to hear an &quot;alternate&quot; version of it; that&apos;s<br/>about all.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
