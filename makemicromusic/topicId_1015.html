It&apos;s pretty stupid for the person that started<br/>the list to not put up some music, so here it is (until I get<br/>writing/playing again, it&apos;s &apos;mine the archives&apos; time). After the<br/>opening of the piece, which was for an extended mallet ensemble (you<br/>hear a bit), there is a section for what is essentially a trio. I<br/>made three nearly-identical percussion setups, with only the<br/>size/pitch of instruments varying. I then wrote this ensemble section<br/>with cross-rhythms, melodies (sic) passed amongst the parts, and so<br/>on. Recorded late one night in marathon session of overdubbing<br/>(c&apos;mon, could I get anyone to do this with me?), it was performed<br/>live with the dance company.</p><p>Enjoy?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1131 href="#1131">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>10/23/2001 8:59:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_1015.html#1015">/makemicromusic/topicId_1015.html#1015</a></p><p>&gt; Anyway, there had been discussions about rhythm, about some<br/>hocketing<br/>&gt; stuff, and whatnot.

I was wondering why that was &gt;so different from the rest of the piece??</p><p>I must have not made it clear: this was an *excerpt* from a long-ish piece. The mallet section you heard was the tail end of about 4-5 minutes of that kind of stuff, and after the excerpt came about a 3 minute coda of very ethereal nature, also not included. The tripartite, and quite varied, structure of the piece was dictated by the episodic nature of the choreography.</p><p>(Besides, I only uploaded the excerpt that was microtonal - the opening and closing were, by use of traditional mallet instruments, strictly in 12tET...)</p><p>&gt;By the way, it took me *forever* to download this piece.  Being the &gt;preeminent Webmeister that you is, can&apos;t you arrange to &quot;stream&quot; this stuff??</p><p>mp3 files only stream from a server running streaming software on the server side; <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> would be an example of this. Yahoo doesn&apos;t do this, and the only alternatives would be RealAudio or Flash audio, and everybody around here seems to want to download mp3 files (I use RealAudio on the Partch site, for other reasons). As for time to download, thank the overloaded servers at Yahoo (and it wasn&apos;t a small file anyway...).</p><p>&gt;OH... and by the way, what happened to all of Jacky Ligon&apos;s music in the &gt;files section.</p><p>He periodically removes it, as is probably a good thing around here to preserve the 20mB limit.</p><p>&gt;And where is Jacky, anyway??  OK, I hope...</p><p>Jacky is just being quiet, I think. We needn&apos;t worry right now.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
