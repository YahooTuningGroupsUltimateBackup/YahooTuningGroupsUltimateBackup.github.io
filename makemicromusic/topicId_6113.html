For example, to some extent I can run unix commands right now within my e-mail app, within the e-mail I&apos;m typing. It would be interesting if there was a way to do something musically useful at the spur of the moment without having to first launch the actual application - even as much as run a Scala, Csound, or Common Music command on a whim. Actually I think this may be currently possible.
