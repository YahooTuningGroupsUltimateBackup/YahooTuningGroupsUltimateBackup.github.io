I don&apos;t see any relevant subsets or supersets of it in the Scala archive, so perhaps it&apos;s essentially unused.</p><p>! C:\Program Files (x86)\Scala22\2011-may-31.scl<br/>!<br/>May 31, 2011 scale -- based on 5.11.31 subgroup<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 125/121<br/> 33275/29791<br/> 34375/29791<br/> 31/25<br/> 155/121<br/> 1331/961<br/> 1375/961<br/> 961/625<br/> 961/605<br/> 1331/775<br/> 55/31<br/> 29791/15625</p><p>Note that it&apos;s actually three chords of 125/121, 33275/29791, 34375/29791, and 31/25, stacked with an intervening 125/121. Clearly, as a non-octave scale, you could split it up at any chord boundary, but I found it convenient to keep it to twelve notes.</p><p>It&apos;s strictly proper, and Scala&apos;s SHOW DATA function shows a bunch of other stuff I don&apos;t know much about. (Vogel&apos;s harmonic complexity is too high to compute? Should that intimidate me? What about the fact that the Rothenberg Stability is 1, but the Lumma Stability is only 0.55?) I figured that, since it contains tones with Tenney Heights as high as 1024065625, I shouldn&apos;t worry about the theoretical calculations much if I were going to try to compose with it.</p><p>It has three interval sizes, but I figured I shouldn&apos;t temper them, for three reasons: First, because people with golden ears might miss the 31-ness of it all, instead hearing 7-based ratios or some other interval; second, because I couldn&apos;t find any advantage to tempering, though perhaps someone else could see something worthwhile; third, because I think the different interval sizes add something to the character of the scale.</p><p>I started writing a few faster pieces using bongy-gongy inharmonic timbres, since people talk about those being useful for this for high-prime scales, but I didn&apos;t like anything I was doing. I started over, this time with a Warm Pad slowly playing the most harmonious chords I could find. Those include things like two stacked 31/25ths, a 55/31 split by a 31/25 on the bottom, and an 11/5 split by a 55/31 on the bottom. Since they have crazy ratios like 15625:19375:29791 (the two 31/25ths), I didn&apos;t bother to compute them.</p><p>I set up chord progressions in an A-B-A structure, and I decided to give a theme to a saxophone (A) and a somewhat rambling solo to a nylon-string guitar (B). I also doubled the Warm Pad with strings and added tubular bells as an accent.</p><p>The Warm Pad might be a cheat -- it sounds deeper than the string sample I have, so I&apos;m guessing it doubles down an octave -- but I like it, so I&apos;m keeping it. After all, every timbre has some tones in it that aren&apos;t part of the scale, right? :)</p><p>I wrote it using LilyPond and rendered it with Timidity++.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p><p>P.S. Yes, I know 5/29/11 was just yesterday, but I thought of 31 first, and didn&apos;t think I&apos;d have time to write something for 5/29. I did try to generate a scale for it, but I didn&apos;t like it as much as this one anyway.</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2011 10:14:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like especially the portions with the saxophones and the tubular bell<br/>works rather effectively.<br/>Overall a nice other worldly sound.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, May 30, 2011 at 11:41 AM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a new composition in honor of tomorrow, May 31, 2011.
