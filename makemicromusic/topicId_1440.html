Then I add a second<br/>&gt; line. 4 parts takes much longer. And you&apos;re right - often traditional<br/>&gt; counterpoint gives way to new &apos;rules&apos;. But there are many harmonic<br/>&gt; moves that we seem to like, such as cadences, and movement within the<br/>&gt; cadences as the tonic approaches. Exploring different temperaments<br/>&gt; allows you different flavours as you move harmonically. Some would<br/>&gt; argue that Just Intonation gets to the source of what temperaments are<br/>&gt; trying to reach.</p><p> The problem lies in the seemingly infinite number of scales in the<br/>microtonal universe. It&apos;s easy to spend too much time tinkering and not<br/>actually producing music.  IMHO I&apos;d recommend getting to know one or two<br/>really well if you&apos;re interested in counterpoint and harmony. Remember<br/>how long it took to get inside 12 tet?  Some will disagree but I think<br/>you need at least a year studying a new temperament or J.I. set to get<br/>familiar.</p><p>Check out previous postings by Margo Schulter. She&apos;s one of the few who<br/>offers illustrated solutions to simple cadences using mainly different<br/>flavours of thirds and fifths and so on. The next step would be to use<br/>these contrapuntally in composition.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or do y&apos;all take a more shotgun approach and just<br/>&gt; &gt; program your computer/keyboard of choice to play the<br/>&gt; &gt; new scale, and just start messing around with it and<br/>&gt; &gt; see what happens?</p><p>That&apos;s good too but you&apos;d still have to spend quality time to get inside<br/>the harmonic and contrapuntal workings.

Those composers who churn out works in all kinds of tunings,<br/>seem to always leave me disappointed. And start simple -- I think<br/>somewhere around 20 notes per octave (or whatever near-octave<br/>interval you may have) is enough to completely break away from 12-tET<br/>thinking while giving you a chance of actually, after a year or two,<br/>being able to begin the experience of being a real musician in the<br/>system. (Prent Rodgers uses the Tonality Diamond of 29 notes, but<br/>really tends to stick to 6-note subsets for each section, in his<br/>music that I&apos;ve heard so far) Otherwise you&apos;ll just end up<br/>translating your ingrained patterns into the new tuning system, and<br/>though I hear quite a lot of that, it&apos;s not something that I,<br/>personally, find appealing.</p></div><h3><a id=1470 href="#1470">ðŸ”—</a>xbrianskix@...</h3><span>12/22/2001 3:24:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks very much to all who responded to my post!
