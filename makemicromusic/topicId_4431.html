Could someone help me out? I am looking for a simple<br/>code in pascal that lets me hand over a frequency and duration to a<br/>sound card so that it will produce a tone. It would also be great to<br/>be able to have several tones generated at the same time. There is a<br/>lot of software out there, that lets you bend pitch in a midi file,<br/>but I&apos;m looking for a solution that will give me the greatest<br/>flexibility. Can anybody help me? I&apos;ve got W98 running on my computer<br/>and have a soundblaster card in a PCI slot.</p></div>
