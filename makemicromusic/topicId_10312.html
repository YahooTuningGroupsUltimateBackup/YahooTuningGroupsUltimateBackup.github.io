Not to mention all the work that James Newton Howard has done that has stealthily utilized microtones. But beneath all this is whether or not you are making music to make music, or making music to make microtonal music. In this regard, I am stubbornly a musician, and not an evangelist. Let the music stand on the soapbox by itself, because it frequently fails when it&apos;s creator starts waving banners.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
