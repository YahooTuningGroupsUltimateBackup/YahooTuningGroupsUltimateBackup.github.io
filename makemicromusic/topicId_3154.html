The Nord is a fantastic synth. I wonder if these<br/>&gt; are the only choices one has for retuning? One would imagine that if<br/>&gt; it can do 31, it might be fully retunable. Perhaps Manuel, Jeff, or<br/>&gt; John can shed light on the issue.</p><p>From what I can discern, it&apos;s probably possible to do other equal-spaced scales. Many synths can do some sort of microtuning almost by accident; the Waldorf Microwave XT is one. Take a look at the downloadable manual, I think it can do 1 through 100 cents per step in 1 cent increments.</p><p>What I think would be an astounding fantasy instrument is if IRCAM&apos;s excellent Modalys physical modeling software were to someday run in real-time. Perhaps the also fantasized about (see <a href="http://www.macosrumors.com/index.php?view=recent">http://www.macosrumors.com/index.php?view=recent</a>) quad 1.4GHz processor PowerMacs would be capable, but even the more likely dual 1.4GHz G4s may bring it closer, if IRCAM ever considers it...</p><p>&gt;&gt; It lists 5 through 31 EDO/tET.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Groucho: When is and EDO not an EDO ?<br/>&gt;&gt; Chico  : When an octave isn&apos;t an octave.<br/>&gt;&gt; Harpo  : That&apos;s a stretch...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is great!! These are like the Pitch Koans!</p><p>Does seem to get the point across, doesn&apos;t it ? I&apos;d love to see someone come up with something really zen-like (pun intended) about &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; and such. I just had to screw up the spelling though - that&apos;s &quot;When is _an_ EDO not an EDO ?&quot; of course.</p><p>Does this work ? :</p><p>Groucho: An EDO isn&apos;t always an ET.<br/>Chico  : *Just* what do you *mean* ?!@#<br/>Harpo  : Now, now. Temper, temper...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Joel</p></div>
