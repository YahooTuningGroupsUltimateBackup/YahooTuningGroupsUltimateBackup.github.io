That would explain why modem dialup users, taking longer for the data to arrive, would get cutoff and you wouldn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;Wonder why others have trouble. I&apos;m on the opposite side of the country &gt;too from the Yahoo servers.</p><p>They&apos;re on the backbone, so location should be an issue. But how about it, folks? If you&apos;ve had trouble downloading and you are either a cable modem user or have a DSL line, report in! I&apos;m betting that download speed may be the culprit here, and if that is the case then I have further issues with Yahoo! to deal with...</p><p>&gt;Strange!</p><p>No, that thing in the Tupperware in the back of my fridge is strange; this is just technology.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=978 href="#978">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/8/2001 3:15:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon</p><p>I am on cable modem and also got cut off for Talismandala, so I don&apos;t<br/>think tht is the full solution.</p><p>Went back just now to try redownloading it and can&apos;t find it.
