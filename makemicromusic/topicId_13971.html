Instrumentations have sometimes been<br/>revised.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-pourquoy-pep12.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-pourquoy-pep12.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b11-pep12.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b11-pep12.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b12-pep12.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b12-pep12.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b25-pep12.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b25-pep12.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b35-pep12.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Machaut-b35-pep12.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>I chose these pieces especially in response to a question by Gene Ward<br/>Smith as to medieval pieces with prominent thirds. Machaut often uses<br/>them, for example as a &quot;pregnant pause&quot; at the end of a phrase or<br/>section of music where their instability creates a feeling of forward<br/>motion or &quot;suspense&quot; as we await some resolution. Either the third or<br/>the sixth, or both together in a piece with three or more voices, can<br/>play this role.</p><p>The first piece, actually a lament on domestic violence and abuse from<br/>a woman&apos;s point of view, has lots of expressive unstable intervals.<br/>The next to last, Machaut-b25-pep12.mid, has an opening with a pause<br/>on a prolonged sonority of a third and sixth above the lowest voice,<br/>maybe an &quot;interrupted cadence&quot; that might bring out the qualities of a<br/>tuning.</p><p>Interesting questions are how clearly or distinctly the Scala pitch<br/>bend adjustments make the sound &quot;neo-medieval&quot; -- and how successful<br/>the result is for different listeners. I know that I loved Aaron&apos;s<br/>arrangements, which were based on tuning tables rather than pitch<br/>bends, sometimes a more reliable and efficient solution.</p><p>In Peppermint the regular major and minor thirds are around 416 and<br/>288 cents, close to 14:11 and 13:11; the whole tone is around 208<br/>cents, a bit larger than 9:8, and the semitone around 80 cents, close<br/>to 22:21. Thus as applied to regular diatonic steps and intervals, it<br/>is mostly a form of &quot;accentuated&quot; Pythagorean tuning, with the fifths<br/>slightly impure (~2.14 cents) in the wide direction.</p><p>Again, thanks to Aaron for his fine midi renditions.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
