Porcupine is great for scales but<br/>chords are much more stretched and uncomfortable.  All in all, Stevie<br/>seemed to prefer George&apos;s orignal Bosanquet-based design as the best<br/>compromise between chords and scales; his fingers are much longer<br/>than mine so chords that I thought would be unplayable he has no<br/>problem with (though that&apos;s probably just as much due to his 13+<br/>years of piano training as his finger size).  Also, we decided that<br/>we&apos;re not going to use buttons directly over the key switches, but<br/>rather use a type-writer/cash-register-esque system of levers and<br/>fulcrums, with square shaped keys at on end, springs at the other,<br/>and a pivot axle in the middle.  We&apos;ll have parallel pivot axles<br/>running along one of the diagonal pitch axes, and they will be<br/>vertically offset to allow for full key motion.  This will allow for<br/>square-shaped keys that still have the action of regular piano keys.</p><p>However, we&apos;re going to build a stryofoam model before making any<br/>committments.</p><p>We are also going to re-key an old MIDI controller to the<br/>Pentadecaphonic 8-white 7-black layout for use with 15-equal, or<br/>maybe even Porcupine-15 from 22.</p><p>Meanwhile, Stevie is busy building sample patches on his Korg Triton<br/>that are tuned to 22-equal...god bless the retunability of samplers.</p><p>-Igliashon</p></div><h3><a id=8748 href="#8748">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2005 9:38:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Alright Carl (and anyone else who was curious), I&apos;ve restored Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt;designs to my photo-space:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://photobucket.com/albums/v170/igliashon_jones/">http://photobucket.com/albums/v170/igliashon_jones/</a></p><p>Swweeet!</p><p>Paul:</p><p>() Heavens, did you draw these with the voronoi cell function?  :)</p><p>() And say, how are you turning temperaments (&apos;porcupine-based&apos;)<br/>into x/y values?</p><p>&gt;This weekend I&apos;ll upload the square-based designs that Stevie and I<br/>&gt;worked with last weekend...</p><p>Cool.

Note also<br/>that much of what we perceive as &quot;action&quot; is actually &quot;response&quot;.<br/>The biggest reason those actions are so bad is that many of their<br/>responses don&apos;t do anything to the sound.</p><p>&gt;Maybe we should talk objectively: give an example of a keyboard<br/>&gt;with an action you admire. I like weighted, yet light and<br/>&gt;repetitive piano keys like on a fine Steinway or Baldwin grand.</p><p>Piano keys are weighted only to counterbalance the weight of the<br/>action parts -- in other words, to make them feel less &quot;weighted&quot;.</p><p>My favorite keyboard actions ever can be found on any piano at<br/>Faust Harrison pianos, 58th near Broadway, New York.  If you get<br/>a full Stanwood job on a good grand you can come close.</p><p>It&apos;s probably true that our fingers can achieve the finest amounts<br/>of control when pushing against a force -- which all keyboards have<br/>to have if the keys are to come back up.  In fact, many &quot;synth&quot;<br/>actions require a breakaway force much higher than that of a fine<br/>piano, even though it may not feel that way.</p><p>My position on &quot;weighted&quot; synthesizer actions is that they are<br/>utter crap.  The only exception is the semi-weighted action made<br/>by Fatar and now found only on Kurzweil keyboards.  The worst is<br/>Roland&apos;s fully-weighted action, which is unbelievably slow and<br/>klunky -- the keys actually percuss violently several times in a<br/>cycle.</p><p>&gt;And by my book, the Yamaha P-200 digital piano has the best action<br/>&gt;and sound of any digital piano, bar none, including Kurzweil.<br/>&gt;That&apos;s why I bought a Yamaha. Unfortunately, no microtuning tables<br/>&gt;or 12-note scales :(</p><p>I don&apos;t remember playing the P-200 by name, but I suspect it&apos;s the<br/>same action they use in their S90, which is middle-of-the-road for<br/>these things.
