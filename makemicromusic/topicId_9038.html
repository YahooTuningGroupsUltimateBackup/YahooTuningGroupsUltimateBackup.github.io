(caveat below)</p><p>caveat: For some people (Jon?), the iPod argument is enough to be wary of not<br/>providing mp3 files. Not enough for me, since there are competitive players<br/>that do offer Ogg-playing capabilities out there right now...maybe what Apple<br/>needs to do is start releasing players with Vorbis ability.</p><p>mp3&apos;s by the way, are shitty with metadata: If I&apos;m a co-composer with someone<br/>else of a work, and we both want to write our full-names to be scrolled by<br/>WinAmp, XMMS, or whatever, we are SOL.
