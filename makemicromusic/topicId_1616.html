What&apos;s the state of the art<br/>&gt;in sampler technologies these days? Are there keyboard samplers, or PC<br/>&gt;board samplers, that can manipulate samples on the computer and/or accept<br/>&gt;WAV or other file formats for download or playing or via floppy?</p><p>Akai has just released a couple of 24bit/96khz samplers; if I recall on my<br/>brief overview of them they only have stereo input/output. This seems a little<br/>silly to me as it defeats live performance where you shuttle all the separate<br/>outputs to a mixing board and play the board. I can understand the 2 channels<br/>though for cost if they are really good A/D/A converters.</p><p>I have an Akai S6000. It is nice; especially with the USB add on board which<br/>enables you to communicate directly with the sampler from your computer<br/>screen/mouse. You can drag and drop.wav files onto a graphic keyboard to create<br/>keygroups and transfer the samples at the same time; plus edit all the other<br/>menus with nice graphics. The new samplers have the USB connection as well. I<br/>have not created much microtonal material with the sampler, but you can retune<br/>it based on the 12 key layout; no global map if I recall.</p><p>If you were to go to Akai route check out getting a used Akai S5000 (only<br/>functional difference between this and the S6000 is the detachable front<br/>faceplate, but that is moot with the USB connection). You can pick an S5000 up<br/>used for $800-$900 used on Ebay and with the USB board it should work like a<br/>charm... check the next item first though...</p><p>For a software sampler check out the Virtual Sampler<br/>(<a href="http://www.virtualsampler.de/">http://www.virtualsampler.de/</a>). It is the most functional software sampler I<br/>have seen yet for the price ($75). It is highly recommended. Not sure about<br/>microtonal usage; otherwise this is a mighty fine piece of software.</p><p>Kraig Grady said:<br/>&gt;I&apos;d been sampled, that&apos;s all<br/>&gt;jacky_ligon wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.fallt.com/artists/electric.html">http://www.fallt.com/artists/electric.html</a><br/>&gt; Genius instrument builder Kraig Grady guests on bass bars and</p><p>hee hee... yeah this caught my eye as fallt hosts a series called Invalid<br/>Objects from the popular microsound area...</p><p>&gt;Very important point: of *our* time. If we ape the past, if we emulate the<br/>&gt;academic or prosaic precursors, we will fail to connect.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p>Jonathan M. Szanto:<br/>&gt;Wait another millenium, see if people are listening to Boulez or Ives. If<br/>&gt;not neither, then I&apos;ll wager on the latter...</p><p>I just finished reading an interesting book on the early history of IRCAM and<br/>Boulez. Rationalizing Culture by Georgia Born. It really met with my<br/>sensibility and provided some great information from my perspective and<br/>experiences. If anyone is familiar with this book and has any suggestions for<br/>something in this direction that would be splendid. I appreciated that Born<br/>contrasted modernism vs postmodernism in regard to IRCAM history.</p><p>I&apos;m gnawing on some more technical acoustics and computer music stuff<br/>currently...</p><p>I unfortunately did not accomplish what I hoped with the Kyma system. I had 60<br/>hours with a fully loaded one this fall. By the time the system was upgraded to<br/>the latest version (5.18) I had 30 hours remaining; until that occurred I could<br/>not run several examples relating to FFT/convolution; so that gave me 30 hours<br/>to work with it. Turns out that my ideas were incorrect anyway. Since the FFT<br/>functionality is windowed and overlapped I ended up creating something like an<br/>EQ instead of being able to accurately suck away harmonic/inharmonic partials.<br/>That is ok though, I learned a lot; IE Kyma is neat, but it is a passing system<br/>entering into later stages in regard to lifecycle. Even with the next big<br/>upgrade within 2-3 years such as system will be obsolete for all intents and<br/>purposes (basically once there are minimal latency direct connections between<br/>computers for audio processing; 2 years min... can&apos;t wait). Another pain about<br/>my experience is that the studio at my uni is in poor shape and I found it<br/>limiting to work inside Kyma only. I lugged my computer into the studio to send<br/>out and record material from my machine, but only had the patience to do that<br/>for one day.  I&apos;m going to be working on some audio I processed, but that will<br/>be a while still...</p><p>I just upgraded to an Athlon XP 1900 and I must say I like it. There is one<br/>musician in my area that I am waiting on to hear back if my previous setup is<br/>spoken for otherwise I am willing to send the mobo (Asus K7V), 512 megs SDRAM,<br/>and Athlon-950 Slot A to someone here for $150. Recipient should be able to<br/>swap parts and have a decent system.</p><p>I recently finished a trance track that is on the deep and somewhat tech side<br/>(you don&apos;t hear much stuff like this on the west coast at least). I think this<br/>is the best sounding track (3rd one) I have created to date. I was able to work<br/>with a phenomenal musician (Chris O&apos;Connell) to record a flute part. I was also<br/>able to take my track up to a post house in the SF area (have a friend that<br/>works at one) to process my material with a Manley Massive Passive EQ, Oram<br/>SonicComp, and Empircal Labs Distressor. Also got to check out the Sony<br/>DMX-R100 mixing board (very very cool!). I then finished the mixing/mastering<br/>in Nuendo. I recorded the flute in my kitchen with one SM57; how does it sound<br/>to you guys? ;)</p><p><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/just_trance.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/just_trance.mp3</a></p><p>also available from:<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/</a> if you need a link...</p><p>You guys are the first to hear the final version, so I would love some<br/>feedback. The flute is a little sharp; I couldn&apos;t find a pitch shift<br/>functionality that did not mangle it in some way or another, so I left it as is<br/>(closest we could match direct). The synths are tuned to a basic JI scale. I<br/>recommend the Native Instruments FM7 (all synths in this track are done with<br/>it).. It is the coolest soft synth I have bought ever and it supports<br/>microtonal tuning in a pinch... This is actually my first time using FM<br/>synthesis in a track. I like... I like... The FM7 even reads sysex dumps from<br/>the DX/CX Yamaha line!</p><p>I look forward to the microfest (hope it is happening again this year). I think<br/>it would be fabulous if we could have a musicians pow wow of sharing<br/>instruments and make some recordings to take back and incorporate in music<br/>after the event. I could bring my computer and recording setup and pass around<br/>CDs to everyone after the session. It would be fun to have a little remix<br/>contest.</p><p>I am willing to remix anyones work here for fun if they can provide me with a<br/>multitrack session. At the same time I will master both the original and remix<br/>for free... Just get in contact...</p><p>I am still tied up with that school thing, so I must disappear shortly.</p><p>And thus ends my early morning rambling....<br/>Cheers,<br/>--Mike<br/>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
