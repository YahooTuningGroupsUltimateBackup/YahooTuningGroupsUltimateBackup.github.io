I gave this piece to three friends who had never played<br/>microtones before, and after five minutes of notational explanation<br/>and a couple weeks of practice, I was *fairly* happy with the<br/>intonation.  I did have to keep them from freaking out the first time<br/>they looked at it, though ;)</p><p>If one is still unconvinced, I would recommend the recording of<br/>Partch&apos;s &quot;U.S. Highball&quot; done by the Kronos (string) quartet.  I am<br/>absolutely amazed by their intonational precision!  Anyway, it seems<br/>that most of the composers here are doing electronic stuff, which is<br/>still the easiest route.  But if you ever want a cello player who<br/>understands a little about microtonal aesthetic...

A ten-thousandth part of a<br/>day is ~1.1574 of our present seconds, so that would be a metric<br/>second.  A &quot;metric hour&quot; would be 4 centidays, giving us 25 hours per<br/>day, or an extra hour every day.  However, this would affect our<br/>measurement of frequency, since any numbered frequency (such as 440<br/>cycles/metric second) would now be ~253 cents lower than at present.<br/>(Just thought I&apos;d throw that last comment in to keep this posting on<br/>topic.)  :-)</p><p>--George</p></div>
