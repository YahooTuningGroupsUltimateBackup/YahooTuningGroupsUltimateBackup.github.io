Here is a list<br/>&gt;of contents and an excerpt from the introduction by guest editor Jarrad<br/>&gt;Powell. The 235-page score anthology allowed longer scores to be published<br/>&gt;in their entirety, unlike the previous issues of BALUNGAN. The back cover<br/>&gt;art is by Heri Dim, on a poem by Taufiq Ismail. Further information can be<br/>&gt;found at <a href="http://www.gamelan.org/">http://www.gamelan.org/</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;=====CONTENTS OF VOL. 7-8=====<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;SCORES<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Waves, by Michiharu Matsunaga<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ghosts, by Daniel J.

Subono<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;=====FROM THE INTRODUCTION=====<br/>&gt;  by Jarrad Powell<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;... The pieces in this anthology generally reflect [a] Javanese bias,<br/>&gt;although I would say that the influence is more in the areas of<br/>&gt;instrumentation and tuning than in compositional style. Stylistically the<br/>&gt;pieces represent quite divergent approaches and interests. For example,<br/>&gt;Balinese stylistic influence is found in Jeff Morris&apos; Rain and John<br/>&gt;Keliehor&apos;s Gong Kundali Shakti, even though these two pieces were written<br/>&gt;for Javanese gamelan.  It is worth noting that this kind of<br/>&gt;cross-pollination is common in Indonesia too, where, for example, Balinese<br/>&gt;musical styles often finds a way into contemporary pieces for Javanese<br/>&gt;gamelan. This raises the question: is &quot;gamelan&quot; a type of instrumentation<br/>&gt;or a style of playing? Is a kotekan considered Balinese gamelan, even when<br/>&gt;played on Javanese instruments? ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;... Is there an &quot;American style&quot; or &quot;Japanese style&quot; of composing music for<br/>&gt;gamelan? Probably not. Are there some aspects to these compositions that<br/>&gt;reveals them as non-Indonesian? Probably. In fact the difference can be<br/>&gt;striking. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since this anthology was compiled, gamelan composition has proceeded on<br/>&gt;many fronts. Today we find a variety of pieces that amalgamate different<br/>&gt;stylistic conventions, particularly cross-pollination of Javanese and<br/>&gt;Balinese influences. Some composers still continue to explore the<br/>&gt;possibilities of writing non-idiomatically for the instruments.<br/>&gt;Interestingly, the sort of collage approach to composition that is often<br/>&gt;used by contemporary Indonesian composers has not dominated in the west.<br/>&gt;Perhaps  the formal structures that provide large-scale compositional<br/>&gt;coherence  have interested western composers, more than the stylistic<br/>&gt;diversity of the musical material.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Performance practice also continues to cross-pollinate. Recently in Jakarta<br/>&gt;I heard gamelan pieces performed on a Javanese gamelan by a group from<br/>&gt;Holland called Ensemble Gending. The pieces were all through-composed in<br/>&gt;western notation and performed by percussionists (some trained in<br/>&gt;traditional gamelan performance practice, others not) with a conductor who<br/>&gt;did not know how to play gamelan music at all. Yet even in this context the<br/>&gt;instruments were traditional, and despite the scores and conductor, many<br/>&gt;idiomatic musical ideas could be heard. There is always some connection<br/>&gt;between what is new and what is traditional. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think working with gamelan is best approached as a more complete musical<br/>&gt;experience than just the writing of a piece. While composers who do not<br/>&gt;play gamelan instruments do write pieces for gamelan, the preponderance of<br/>&gt;successful compositions have been by those individuals who have direct<br/>&gt;involvement with the instruments and see that involvement in several<br/>&gt;dimensions, rather than just the dimension of composition. Yet it is a<br/>&gt;standard practice in western composition to write for instruments that one<br/>&gt;does not play. Such an undertaking requires special study and extra effort<br/>&gt;on the part of composers; they must work with musicians in order to know<br/>&gt;the range of performance practice possible on the instrument or<br/>&gt;instruments. Will this approach to writing for gamelan become more widely<br/>&gt;accepted in the future? Is the gamelan amenable to outside understanding<br/>&gt;from an orchestration standpoint?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;... One might well ask: can gamelan become a bona fide medium of expression<br/>&gt;for the non-Indonesian, one that does not require validation outside of<br/>&gt;itself? ? Or now, at the close of the century, has the gamelan already<br/>&gt;become that to some extent?  Goethe claimed that Orient and Occident could<br/>&gt;no longer be separated. He made a rule of staying in a conscious balance<br/>&gt;between the two worlds, thus always choosing to move between East and West.<br/>&gt;This balance seems to be one of the most overriding, challenging, and<br/>&gt;trying aspects of music for the contemporary composer, no matter what the<br/>&gt;idiom. Certainly in the realm of contemporary music for gamelan it is<br/>&gt;fundamental. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Jarrad Powell<br/>&gt;Seattle, 2000<br/>&gt;American Gamelan Institute (AGI)<br/>&gt;Box 1052, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA<br/>&gt;phone/fax: 603 448 8837<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Visit our website:  <a href="http://www.gamelan.org">http://www.gamelan.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Listen to gamelan and other Indonesian musics: <a href="http://www.gongcast.net">http://www.gongcast.net</a><br/>{...end of forwarded msg}</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div>
