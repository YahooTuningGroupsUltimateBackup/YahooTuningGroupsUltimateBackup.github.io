The target audience would be students, performers, and even instrument builders.</p><p>Just brainstorming at the moment, and so would be happy to hear from you if you have ideas for the app, would like to be involved in testing, or even if you just want me to let you know when it&apos;s released. If other people are excited about the concept it will give me incentive to write it!</p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;m thinking:<br/>* virtual left/right needle like gStrings (<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings</a>)<br/>* user library of scales (probably in scala format) with custom naming schemes<br/>* scala import<br/>* simple scale builder for EDOs, diamonds, and whatever people fancy<br/>* notation support, i.e. Sagittal?<br/>* built for Android (but can do IOS if there is demand)<br/>* [add your feature request here] ;)</p><p>Let me know if you&apos;re interest in being involved in any capacity! If there is interest I&apos;ll start by making a wiki where we can discuss further.</p><p>Thanks everyone!<br/>-Chris Bryan</p></div>
