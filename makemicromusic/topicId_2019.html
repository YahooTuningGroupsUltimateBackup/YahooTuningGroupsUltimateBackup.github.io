(but I hope it doesn&apos;t *sound* like that... :) )</p><p>So, naturally, I was coming as close to Just Intonation intentionally<br/>as Blackjack would permit.  Of course, the pitches are about 3 cents<br/>off from just, and since I was using a keyboard they weren&apos;t &quot;bent&quot;<br/>in that direction.  However, in the recent trombone piece that I<br/>wrote also in Blackjack, I wouldn&apos;t be too surprised if the live<br/>player wouldn&apos;t make those small adjustments going along...</p><p>&gt; BTW . . . what does the title mean, if anything?<br/>&gt;</p><p>****The title is simply an abbreviation of &quot;Blackjack Electronic...&quot;</p><p>JP</p></div>
