No, microtonality won&apos;t be a huge popular uprising and sweep away everything in its path, but I am heartened that an outsider not only wants to know more, but assumes that other outsiders will give a listen. I won&apos;t say that the medium is the message, but if an alternative delivery system like Podcasts ends up expanding the audience for different musics, who could complain?</p><p>Thanks again, Prent, for not only doing it but for doing it so well!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
