Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2004 10:41:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And another thing:</p><p>One line in the review really caught my eye: &quot;...he does give some details in most &apos;casts, but sometimes they assume more of a basis in the ideas behind microtonal music than his potential podience is likely to have.&quot;</p><p>Outside of the awkward &quot;podience&quot; attribution, what is fascinating is that here is a listener *totally outside of our niche*, who is also assuming that Prent&apos;s potential audience is *also* outside of these little microtonal communities. No, microtonality won&apos;t be a huge popular uprising and sweep away everything in its path, but I am heartened that an outsider not only wants to know more, but assumes that other outsiders will give a listen. I won&apos;t say that the medium is the message, but if an alternative delivery system like Podcasts ends up expanding the audience for different musics, who could complain?</p><p>Thanks again, Prent, for not only doing it but for doing it so well!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
