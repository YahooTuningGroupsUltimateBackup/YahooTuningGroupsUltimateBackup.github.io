You stated something that I found, as I said, ridiculous...so I told you why. I did not insult you, but yes, I said your statement was &quot;silly,&quot; which I think it is. And I also told you that I thought you have been honorable and respectful on the list, which you have. As far as the blues challenge in our personal email...I have seen many tuning challenges on this list, where listeners were made to try and figure out what tuning was being played...well...if you think blues is not difficult, try to learn those solos I mentioned, perhaps you will change your mind. Only a person who has not seriously studied blues could say it&apos;s not difficult...or any other folk oriented music, for that matter.</p><p>   I could care less what music folks like/dislike, and I was not commenting on that. If I said something ridiculous about a tuning icon, believe me, I would fully expect the collective wrath of the folks here to descend upon my wittle head. But...I try to only talk about that which I know, helps keep one out of trouble. And I do, indeed, know the genre of blues, as well as most other American forms of folk expression....and from what I see of the comments here, not many other folks do.</p><p>   And BTW...I think it was Igs&apos;s comment, that today, blues is diluted and not much like the real thing...couldn&apos;t agree more. But, that changes nothing about the power and depth of the true art form. Personally, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much going on today in jazz/rock/blues/country/folk, whatever...and the classical station here is unlistenable as well, playing a lot of music that sounds like it was written for trained bears in the circus, or the emperor&apos;s tea party...I call it deedle deedle music, cause it goes deedle deedle deedle. But, that takes nothing away from what classical music can and may someday be again...best...Hstick<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
