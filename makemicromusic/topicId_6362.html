You simply use a module that generates a test tone and automate the frequency slider. Set the initial and end values, and how long you want it to run, set it to record the output to a wave file, and you&apos;re done.</p><p>Let me know if I can be of more help in this...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6380 href="#6380">ðŸ”—</a>tentothe99 &#x3C;tentothe99@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 2:32:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks jon,<br/>i should have specified, but I&apos;m running a Mac G4.

It lets you patch together various modules and<br/>is very flexible as to what MIDI messages it sends, if you think<br/>continuously rising MIDI pitch bend might do the trick for you.  It<br/>can also host Audio Units.</p><p>It&apos;s not free, but you can download a demo and the manual from<br/><a href="http://www.five12.com">http://www.five12.com</a>.  The developer, Jim Coker, mulled over<br/>introducing microtuning features to Numerology (I suppose it would do<br/>the tuning via pitch bend... either way Jim is really open to new<br/>ideas for his product).</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
