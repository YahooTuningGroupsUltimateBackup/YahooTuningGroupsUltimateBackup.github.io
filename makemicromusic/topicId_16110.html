Very, very<br/>lightweight. No aftertouch, unfortuantely.</p><p>So, it&apos;s the UMX to the laptop, Scala doing the retuning relay, then<br/>back out through the UMX, which has a MIDI out to the Waldorf Pulse<br/>analog monosynth. Fortunately, the MIDI out on the UMX is set up<br/>intelligently, I was afraid it might be hardwired to the keyboard so<br/>to speak, but it is not. Scala sees UMX as a MIDI in and out.</p><p>The latency is stunningly low, imperceptible (the UMX comes with<br/>some hotrod ASIO driver). Now of course, all synths except for no-<br/>MIDI analogs have some latency; the near-lightspeed quality of a<br/>discrete analog is a special and palpable thing, especially when<br/>tweaking the filters live.</p><p>But, whatever, in the year 2007, MIDI latency can be made a non-<br/>issue for cheap and that&apos;s great news.</p><p>The keyboard mapping in Scala has to be set to &quot;linear&quot;, at least in<br/>this case, or I get strange dead keys here and there. I&apos;m not<br/>getting the queasy spongy feeling we all have had to battle when<br/>retuning via MIDI.  As the Pulse is a 3-osc synth, I tune one osc at<br/>12&apos;oclock and the other two osc, a little lower in level, to either<br/>side- say, 2 cents high and 1 cent low, or 3 and 2 cents. This<br/>softens the point, so to speak, and since I&apos;m not working with<br/>deadpan sines, the issue of tuning accuracy can also be rendered a<br/>non-issue.</p><p>As far as sequencing, I&apos;m getting note-off problems, this is<br/>something I&apos;ll have to poke at a bit. Even if I can&apos;t solve that<br/>problem I&apos;m still happy.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
