Even your higher-resolution version is pretty<br/>&gt;lean, which I think is a very good thing (I hate the cluttered,<br/>&gt;ad-laden sites that seem to be the norm these days).  Very<br/>&gt;nice photos and layout.</p><p>&gt;-Carl</p><p>thanks carl, glad you enjoy them.</p><p>in general, the free-sites with pop-ups are considered<br/>&apos;amateurish&apos;, and many professionals won&apos;t bother looking<br/>at them. of course, the $100/year and the work on the site<br/>and i can see why lots of people decide it&apos;s better than<br/>nothing.</p><p>personally, i don&apos;t like &apos;flash presentations&apos;, since if<br/>i go to an artist site, i want info about the music and not<br/>some &apos;flash&apos; with no content. not that there are some okay<br/>ones, but it&apos;s like going into a shoe store and having them<br/>try and sell you a tie !!!!</p><p>the lean novosonic site is about trying to cram as much as<br/>possible into 25megs of space. whereas, the look and feel<br/>of buzz at the nonoctave site is due to x.j. scott. at this<br/>point it&apos;s a time and money problem, jeff doesn&apos;t have the time<br/>and i don&apos;t have the money. well at least, i much prefer to<br/>spend my &apos;megere music money&apos; on myself  :&gt;)</p><p>hope this is of help to some of you. also i won&apos;t comment<br/>on certain other things because i&apos;m trying to leave<br/>&apos;crusty behind&apos;, although i&apos;m certain a few people won&apos;t<br/>believe that !!!</p><p>                           hope/peace/luv        buzzy^</p><p>*****************************************************************<br/>microtonal music of buzz kimball -international lo bandwidth site<br/><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~gregmcleod/novosonic.html">http://home.comcast.net/~gregmcleod/novosonic.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/novosonic">http://www.soundclick.com/novosonic</a><br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/8/novosonicmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/8/novosonicmusic.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/heroes/buzz">http://www.nonoctave.com/heroes/buzz</a><br/><a href="http://psychevanhetfolk.homestead.com/expmu2.html">http://psychevanhetfolk.homestead.com/expmu2.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/lyrics.cfm?BandID=167053&songid=1138389">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/lyrics.cfm?BandID=167053&songid=1138389</a></p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
