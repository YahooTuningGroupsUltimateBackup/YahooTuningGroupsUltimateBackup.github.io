Instead, it seems best described in terms of the scale<br/>[-8, -5, -3, -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8] of meantone. The tuning is<br/>slightly irregular, sometimes 1/5 comma, sometimes closer to 1/4 comma.<br/>74 or 105 would be good choices, especially the latter, but there<br/>doesn&apos;t seem much reason why we would need to stick to this region of<br/>meantone.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2004 2:38:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 74 or 105 would be good choices, especially the latter, but there<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t seem much reason why we would need to stick to this region of<br/>&gt; meantone.</p><p>Another good choice is a tuning I recently mention on tuning-math in<br/>connection with 17 notes of meantone, (8192/13)^(1/16), which is<br/>697.467 cents, right in the correct range. The idea behind this is<br/>that it makes an exact 13/8 one of the intervals of the scale.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2004 4:08:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I analyzed the tuning information Mark Gould used in his recorder<br/>&gt; duet, and it doesn&apos;t seem to have anything much to do with either<br/>&gt; 19-equal</p><p>Really . . . well, perhaps it would be helpful for you guys to sort<br/>out the differences between what Mark intended and what he got.<br/>Surely if anything technical should get discussed on this list, it&apos;s<br/>how to implement the tunings you want and get the scales you want.<br/>The more theoretical stuff belongs elsewhere.</p></div>
