I&apos;ve got a Roland box that only wants to know about single-octave tuning changes (not the whole keyboard). When I set Scala for that synth, I notice that I can&apos;t create the midi file with the sysex if the scale doesn&apos;t explicitly have 12 pitches.</p><p>I discovered this when trying to utilize some pelog scales, and it made me wonder: is there a quick-and-dirty command to &apos;pad&apos; a scale out to 12 pitches (even if they are duplicates)? I realize I could probably just duplicate the ratios by hand and re-save the scale, but wondered if there was a one command wizard that would do it for me.</p><p>TIA,<br/>Jon</p></div>
