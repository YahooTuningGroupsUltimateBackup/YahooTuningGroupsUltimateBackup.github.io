Notable is &apos;Over Venus&apos; for its beautifully alien take on overtones and<br/>&gt; drones. An instrument the liner notes calls a &apos;Klein trumpet&apos; has a strange<br/>&gt; disembodied sound to it that is quite striking. &apos;When everything was<br/>&gt; simultaneous&apos; and &apos;Temporal Consciousness&apos; use speech elements in a uniquely<br/>&gt; strange and spectral way. This listener has heard nothing quite like it.</p><p>OK. I admit -- it&apos;s not really a trumpet made from a Klein bottle.</p><p>It started as a pretty generic flute sample (I can&apos;t remember whether<br/>it was an &quot;alto flute&quot; or whether I just didn&apos;t use the upper octaves).<br/>Anyway, I played the piece (about 30-40 seconds of a sustained droney effect)<br/>in an overtone tuning using a WX-5 wind controller.<br/>It sat around for quite a while because it didn&apos;t really sound all that good.</p><p>Then I was developing some FFT based routines which do the following:<br/>(1) break the piece up into (roughly) 1/2 second segments (sometimes overlapped).<br/>(2) take the spectrum (FFT)<br/>(3) locate the largest n peaks (n might be 2 or 5 or 20, depending on the source).<br/>(4) move those peaks to the nearest harmonic series<br/>(5) invert the changed spectrum back into a time signal</p><p>So - what you hear in &quot;Over Venus&quot; is the same 30-40 seconds repeated<br/>several times (cut and paste) but each time using a different set of parameters<br/>in the routines (e.g., different segment sizes, different n, different overlaps).</p><p>You hear all the high tinkly stuff? All of that is unintended byproducts or artifacts of<br/>the algorithm. Very often when you do analysis/resynthesis methods, you get weird<br/>tinkley and jangley things going on... this is especially true when the length of the<br/>analysis segments is large (like the 1/2 second used here). I&apos;ve actually spent a<br/>ridiculous amount of time attempting to remove the artifacts from the process,<br/>but in this case, I decided that the artifacts themselves were quite cool.</p><p>In fact, this is the same kind of algorithmic manipulation used in both<br/>&quot;Temporal Consciousness&quot; and &quot;When everything was Simultaneous&quot; though of course<br/>it was applied to vocal based samples (and a didgeridoo sample) rather than<br/>the flute. The artifacts are quite striking -- in both of these what happens<br/>is that when you do the FFT segmenting and change the phase, it<br/>scrambles up the signal. Using different size segments changes the scrambling from<br/>rapid to an almost stuttering effect.</p><p>As I was writing this message, I remembered another piece using (more or less)<br/>the same technique. It&apos;s called &quot;VarMixUp&quot; because it&apos;s all variable and mixed up (this is a<br/>&quot;working title&quot;). For a variety of reasons, &quot;VarMixUp&quot; didn&apos;t make it onto<br/>Exomusicology.
