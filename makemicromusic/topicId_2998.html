I had just a brief moment at home this morning, so that is when I put up the page, downloaded the mp3, and put it on a CD-RW. I&apos;m now at the place where I&apos;m staying, and listening to it with headphones on my laptop.</p><p>1. Seriously dangerous mix to listen on &apos;phones!</p><p>2. That section that starts at 5:21? How cool is that?! Great use of space and a break in the flow.</p><p>3. It really is a wonderful melding of Dan&apos;s floating, stream-of-conscienceness compositional style with drop-dead beats from Jacky.</p><p>I&apos;ll second what Jeff said: Jacky, your talents as a producer are second to few if none. The only place I&apos;d differ is for you to do it full-time, because then you&apos;d end up having to work with musicians of a much lesser calibre than Dan. Music as a &apos;day job&apos; sucks hard.</p><p>But if you found a way to pick and choose your projects, you really would add immensely to anyone&apos;s work lucky enough to have you onboard.</p><p>This little place sure has some great people, and humble bravos to Dan and Jacky. Here&apos;s to more collabs in the future (he said, putting on his thinking cap and wondering how we can facilitate in the coming months...)</p><p>Happy we are,<br/>Jon</p></div>
