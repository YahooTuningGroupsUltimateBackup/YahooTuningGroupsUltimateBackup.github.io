Vernon &amp; Brimmer Sts. on Beacon Hill)</p><p>Peter Warren and Matt Samolis will be giving a rare public concert on<br/>Friday, October 18 in the spacious and reverberant sanctuary of The Church<br/>Of The Advent. The concert will consist of a single continuous performance<br/>of acoustic drone music played on their own modified &#xFFFD;steel cello&#xFFFD;.</p><p>&quot;Peter Warren&#xFFFD;s and Matt Samolis&#xFFFD;s work on their modified steel cellos is<br/>in<br/>part a blending of the harmonic and drone traditions. The steel cello is a<br/>remarkably resonant and sympathetic assemblage of cymbals and tuned steel<br/>rods, that once set into vibration, produces a huge variety of subtly<br/>shifting timbres and harmonic intervals. The unfolding of the music is<br/>patient and meditative, as the sounds gradually reveal a succession of<br/>overtones and timbral nuances. The process of acoustical sympathy between<br/>pitches is an active organizational force that promotes sustained pitch<br/>relationships, whether they be consonant or dissonant. What results is the<br/>creation of very unusual &#xFFFD;chords&#xFFFD; that progress through various harmonic<br/>series and timbres, each with its own sense of musical suspension or<br/>resolution, until a final concluding episode emerges, creating a natural<br/>endpoint.&quot;</p><p>Matt Samolis<br/>Somerville  MA</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos, &amp; more<br/><a href="http://faith.yahoo.com">faith.yahoo.com</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
