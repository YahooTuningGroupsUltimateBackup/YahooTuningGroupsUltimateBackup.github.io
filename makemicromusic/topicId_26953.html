The serialists were fond of having these<br/>examples on hand to perhaps &apos;justify&apos; their experiments. Perhaps they<br/>shouldn&apos;t have felt the need to be defensive, although they came under such<br/>attack from the conservatives that it was of course understandable.

However as I understand it, it is not a true tone row<br/>because notes are repeated before all are introduced.</p><p>Here is a nice page on this wonderful fugue<br/><a href="http://www2.nau.edu/tas3/wtc/i24.html">http://www2.nau.edu/tas3/wtc/i24.html</a></p><p>The theme is what Lady Gaga turns off, with a disapproving look,<br/>at the start of her music video for &quot;Bad Romance&quot;.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;   From Keyboard mag, March &apos;85 (a special Bach issue)...Rosalyn<br/>&gt;Tureck said &quot;And when I was studying composition with Schoenberg, he<br/>&gt;told me that Bach was the first twelve-tone composer.
