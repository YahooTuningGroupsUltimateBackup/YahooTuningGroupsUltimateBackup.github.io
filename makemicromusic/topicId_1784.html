I see that Jim has a new book out on instruments, and the home page of their shop (above) has details on both that and a former book. Doubt that he loves music? Both books have CDs with them! I met Jim when he wanted a photo of Partch (and the Gourd Tree) for the first book, and he gave me a tour of the premises, along with all the material he was collating for the book. I should also mention that he is a very good photographer, and the photos in the book(s) are beautiful.</p><p>Of interest to a number of people on this list (knowing your ears and musical activities) were his &quot;Pidgeon Flutes&quot;, which I had not known about. Of Chinese background, they are small fipple flutes made of gourds, which are tied to the back of carrier pigeons. As the pigeons take flight, and circle, the various notes (many of the flutes are multple/chordal flutes) start singing, in varying amplitudes and pitches. If ever one wanted &apos;clouds of sounds&apos; to surround them, the ethereal harmonies of these birds in flight is completely magical. I believe there is a recording in the first book.</p><p>Rather amazing. And better than strapping my old Prophet V to my wolf/dog Clancy as he runs in the park...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div>
