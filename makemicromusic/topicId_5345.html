Even if I did a killer sample of a middle C on the best Steinway in town, it is going to sound terribly dumb by at most an octave up or down. Not to mention that a good sampler would not only have multiple notes sampled, but each of those with a variety of volume and timbre, so the you could work out the cross-fading on the velocity to &quot;approximate&quot; the nuances of a good piano.

In fact, I don&apos;t want it<br/>to sound like a real piano, I just want it to have a piano-like sound. Ideally, it would<br/>be a sample of ONE STRING of middle-C to eliminate the added inharmonicity of the<br/>chorus effect. Also, all the other strings on the piano would be muted to eliminate<br/>any 12tet sympathetic resonances in the sample. The sample would be given a little<br/>bit of reverb and then used as a one-shot sample. I&apos;d do it myself if I knew how. -<br/>Justin</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I know that Justin had purchase some additional sounds, but the only sound banks I had were not so emulative as they were creative, so this really was a quicky experiment to see how like a sampler one could make it. I may take another stab and tweak it more &apos;away&apos; from creative and really focus on just sample reproduction. We&apos;ll see.</p><p>&gt;Did you try a variable bit rate for the MP3?</p><p>Didn&apos;t mess with it.

In fact, the strings will<br/>interact physically and often pull each other into exact synchrony,<br/>like Kepler&apos;s pendulum clocks mounted on the same wall. In such<br/>cases, there will be no beating or chorusing at all, and instead one<br/>may observe an amplitude envelope with a considerable sustain<br/>portion, something not possible with a single string alone.</p><p>See<br/><a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/weinreic/mistuned.html">http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/weinreic/mistuned.html</a><br/>and the surrounding articles.</p><p>Happy New Year,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2004 2:21:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; In fact, the strings will<br/>&gt;interact physically and often pull each other into exact synchrony,<br/>&gt;like Kepler&apos;s pendulum clocks mounted on the same wall.</p><p>Wasn&apos;t that Huygens, or someone other than Kepler?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2004 3:38:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; In fact, the strings will<br/>&gt; &gt;interact physically and often pull each other into exact<br/>synchrony,<br/>&gt; &gt;like Kepler&apos;s pendulum clocks mounted on the same wall.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wasn&apos;t that Huygens, or someone other than Kepler?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>A quick web search says it was Huygens.
