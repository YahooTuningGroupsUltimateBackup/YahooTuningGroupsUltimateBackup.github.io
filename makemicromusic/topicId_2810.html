The nails, otherwise known as duplex nails or<br/>scaffolding nails, have two heads on them and are readily available<br/>at any hardware store.  I then wrapped two lengths of 1/8&quot; shock cord<br/>around each nail head in a way that would allow the conduit to be<br/>inserted and held without the cord popping off the head of the nail.<br/>Shock cord is nothing more than a thin bungee cord, available at<br/>mountaineering stores and even some hardware stores.</p><p>     Finding a way to wrap the cord around the nail heads securely<br/>was a bit of a trick.  Much of this was detailed in the March 1995<br/>issue of Experimental Musical Instruments, volume 10 #3.  Several<br/>other writers offered their unique views of conduit marimbas in this<br/>issue as well as the previous issue volume 10 #2 (December 1994).</p><p>     The cord then goes through a hole in the frame wall and wraps<br/>around the outside of the frame in a narrow trough that was cut into<br/>the wood.</p><p>     The rear frame rests in the two &quot;h&quot; legs, and along the top<br/>edge.  The front frame also rests in the two &quot;h&quot; legs and yet the<br/>only thing holding it upright is the tubes themselves (the friction<br/>that comes from the tubes being held firmly in the shock cord<br/>mounting system).  One of the added benefits of this mounting system,<br/>is that the tubes do not rotate while being played, something that<br/>plagues a conduit marimba that rests on foam.  Since the pitch of a<br/>bar is different when struck upon the seam (or directly opposite the<br/>seam) as opposed to 90 degrees off the seam, consistency in tuning<br/>can be maintained.</p><p>     I remember tuning this whole instrument by ear.  This was in the<br/>early days before I had a strobe tuner.  I went down to the local<br/>music store where they had a tuner, and I brought a synthesizer and a<br/>tape deck.  I tuned an oscillator to each of the 53 tones in each<br/>octave and recorded that onto a cassette tape.  I then took it back<br/>to the shop and tuned each bar painstakingly to the tape.  Don&apos;t try<br/>this one at home kids...</p><p>     I also remember how much I wanted to build this instrument.  It<br/>was a commissioned piece and neither of us had any idea how elaborate<br/>the frame would become.  I so wanted to do it &quot;the right way&quot; that I<br/>offered my services for a mere $3/hour.  Still it ended up costing<br/>quite a bit.</p><p>     Since that time, the instrument has moved to Boston and I am no<br/>longer in contact with the owner.  I do have a few recordings on<br/>cassette tape, which someone else asked about.  I have no idea how to<br/>transfer an audio signal to a wav. file or whatever I&apos;d need to<br/>upload something to the internet.  Perhaps someone would be kind<br/>enough to run me through this process?

I think people should be aware of this: unresonated conduit tubes (i.e. if you don&apos;t put resonators under them) do not have a big, carrying tone. Suitable for chamber-musics, etc. One other thing I&apos;ve found frustrating (at times) with them is a lack of a large dynamic range as well as limited degrees of timbral variation (of course, good composers can work with these limitations, but one should know of them before building). Also, bear in mind that large numbers of tubes, if they aren&apos;t constructed so that one may actively hand-damp (a la gamelan technique), you will get a ringing haze of tones; again, in certain circumstances that can be a _good_ thing, but I&apos;ve also been frustrated by it as a listener (Dean Drummond&apos;s Zoomoozaphone comes to mind...).</p><p>&gt;But Jon, I know their is a guy who makes wind chimes down in your neck of<br/>&gt;the woods-Stanard?</p><p>Nope!</p><p>&gt;who i noticed he had some large diameter tubes that looked like could be &gt;used for aluminum vertical chimes. do you have any info on him? or on the &gt;metal spec. or maybe you might know what the professional brass alloy is</p><p>I&apos;ll see if I can&apos;t find out some info in the future on this, Kraig.

The ideal striking<br/>point is the anitinode, which the ends come just a bit short of<br/>reaching.  Fortunately, conduit does respond well to being struck on<br/>the ends, though less so in the lower regions.  Good thing too, as<br/>the alternatives don&apos;t seem very appealing...</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Kraig wrote:</p><p>&gt;I have found that when mounting tubes, i have had to have the slope<br/>&gt;at least 45 degrees in order to get good access to striking them.<br/>&gt;Once i was able to get bars , I had to abandon tubes due to their<br/>&gt;lesser volume.

I don&apos;t remember if it was a 10 or 15 degree angle,<br/>nothing like the 45 degree that Kraig recommends.  I found it to be<br/>very accessable as it turned out.  Playing rapid passages<br/>and &quot;finding my way around on it&quot; became second nature in a short<br/>amount of time.  If I had to do it all again, I wouldn&apos;t change a<br/>thing.  (Well maybe one or two things, see the next section.)</p><p>     Then Jon again:<br/>&gt;Yes! I think people should be aware of this: unresonated conduit<br/>&gt;tubes (i.e. if you don&apos;t put resonators under them) do not have a<br/>&gt;big, carrying tone. Suitable for chamber-musics, etc.</p><p>     Resonators help somewhat.  Though since conduit does not have<br/>much of a surface with which to push air, especially since it is<br/>round and pushes air without the same focus that a vibraphone bar<br/>might, resonators help only a little.  I have found that a more<br/>dramatic increase in amplitude (and much simpler to build) is found<br/>by installing a reflective surface about two inches away from the<br/>tubes.  My first conduit marimba was built a la Erv, with foam rubber<br/>cut to accept the tubes and then placed on a sheet of plywood.  When<br/>I later built a frame for the tubes from 2x2&apos;s and then put it back<br/>on the plywood, the sound more than doubled in amplitude.</p><p>     Of course you could always build reflectors and resonators on<br/>the same instrument.  The 53 tone instrument only has enough room for<br/>the reflective surfaces to be built in.  On smaller conduit marimbas<br/>I have done both.  It seems to make the largest difference in the low<br/>end, below middle C.  Otherwise I&apos;d just stick to reflectors.</p><p>        SVG</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I haven&apos;t heard of the term (in either spelling), and the concept of &apos;mystery points&apos; of striking are fascinating. Is there a source on this somewhere?</p><p>&gt;Fortunately, conduit does respond well to being struck on the ends, though &gt;less so in the lower regions.</p><p>Good to know; how low in pitch can conduit instruments be effective?</p><p>As to reflectors/resonators, it may also have to do with both the range of the instrument (the higher the pitch, the less apparent help the resonator gives), as well as the tubes being open on both ends - solid bars are definitely helped by resonators.</p><p>Again, thanks for all your background on this. I&apos;ve spent my life behind bars (a phrase borrowed from Emil Richards) and mallet instruments are where I feel most at home. It&apos;s good to hear other ideas/viewpoints/insights as well...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
