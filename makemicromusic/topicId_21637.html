It&apos;s an annual call for all musicians to get off the couch and make a CD of 10 songs or 35 minutes of music in one month. I&apos;ve done it for the past two years, and it really does help focus the mind on getting it down on paper (or computer) and getting it done.</p><p>From the RPM description: <a href="http://www.rpmchallenge.com/">http://www.rpmchallenge.com/</a></p><p>We&apos;ve got 7 more days left until the official start of RPM 2010! It&apos;s our 5th year anniversary and we want YOU!</p><p>We&apos;ve tripled our sign-ups in a week and we want to triple them again before Feb 1!  We can do this! YOU CAN DO THIS!</p><p>If you have already signed-up for 2010 - YOU ROCK!! You can help us even more now by spreading the word about RPM and encouraging your non-RPM musician and band friends to sign-up.</p><p>Join our Facebook Page - Follow us on Twitter - Become a friend on MySpace or for the really good stuff - Hang out in our Forums!</p><p>If you have been thinking about taking the Challenge again, are debating, or haven&apos;t even considered it - LET&apos;S DO IT! :)  Registration is easy, and painless - SIGN UP HERE - JOIN THE RPM REVOLUTION!</p><p>Need a refresher????</p><p>This is the challenge: record an album in 28 days, just because you can.</p><p>That&apos;s 10 songs or 35 minutes of original material recorded during the month of February. Go aheadÂ… put it to tape.</p><p>Don&apos;t wait for inspiration - taking action puts you in a position to get inspired. You&apos;ll stumble across ideas you would have never come up with otherwise, and maybe only because you were trying to meet a day&apos;s quota of (song)writing. Show up and get something done, and invest in yourself and each other.</p><p>Anyone can come up with an excuse to say &quot;no,&quot; so don&apos;t. You have your orders - now let&apos;s get this party started!!</p><p> Want to get involed?? We are always looking for help!

I mean, it is *really* comfortable. It takes a hell of a lot to get me off of it. Just the other day, Selma Hayek walked by the house (I can see out the front window from the couch) in a halter top, handing out cash to passers-by from a wheelbarrow. I stayed put.</p><p>&gt; This is the challenge: record an album in 28 days, just because you can.</p><p>&quot;Just because you can&quot;? I think this is what is wrong with music (and writing, etc) these days: too many people making something for no other reason than they *can*.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. For anyone who might have missed it, the above is all in good fun. If I had the time, I&apos;d consider this project. I don&apos;t, so I won&apos;t, but YMMV.</p></div><h3>prentrodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2010 10:02:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>:}&gt;</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Prent,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;prentrodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s time again for the RPM Challenge.
