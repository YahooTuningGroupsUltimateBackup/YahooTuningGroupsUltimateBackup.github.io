This way changing scales<br/>will be as simple as clicking a &quot;from&quot; preset button and &quot;to&quot; preset<br/>button.</p><p>Another issue I see that could make micro music a LOT easier is<br/>the use of a tonally-capable synth. It would use an underlying<br/>consonance algorithm, like Bill&apos;s, to judge consonance between all<br/>notes in a chord and move each note in the chord to the nearest note<br/>that would produce the same or less as a 12-tet chord.<br/>And in addition use instruments with timber that match the pre-<br/>existing tunings harmonically (Bill has theory for this and software<br/>for timber-to-harmonic- matching- scales, but I have yet to see<br/>software for scales-to-matching- timber released).<br/>There are such wonderful technologies and theoretic discoveries<br/>available we really have no reason to blame instrument architecture<br/>for barring us from microtonal capabilities.</p><p>Why would this be important?</p><p>Well, let&apos;s face it, much of the public has come up with the<br/>misconception that microtonal music is less consonant than 12 note<br/>equal temperment chromatic (when, especially considering JI, this is<br/>a lie)...and that microtonal music HAS to be harder to listen to in<br/>that sense than 12-tet.</p><p>Along with this is the myth that learning the new theories<br/>associated with it would be overkill for trained musicians and<br/>nullify any value of their training (including ear training/&quot;perfect<br/>pitch&quot;)...so it becomes an unnecessary ego issue.</p><p>Such software would eliminate to consonance/pop- markettability<br/>issues...and, when this happens, software synth and guitar<br/>manufacturers will be encouraged to go microtonal for<br/>profitability. This could be an only mildly long-term end to<br/>our &quot;emerging (music) technology&quot; problem, and it sure beats doing<br/>the Beethoven thing and having people figure out you were right long<br/>after you died. :-P</p><p>-Michael</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
