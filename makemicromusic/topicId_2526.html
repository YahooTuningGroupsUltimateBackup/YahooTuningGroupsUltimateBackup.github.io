Schulter&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Hello, there, Alison, and please let me try to answer your question<br/>&gt; about JI in large part from experience, first giving just a bit of<br/>&gt; background on Partch and also Kathleen Schlesinger.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An important caution, which I add after reading your question again,<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; that my experience is with synthesized sound rather than acoustical<br/>&gt; instruments -- a very big distinction that should be pointed out early<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; often. However, Kathleen Schlesinger built flutes using her arithmetic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; series, as well as tuning some of the ratios on piano, while Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; interest in a 17-limit system was connected with his experiences with<br/>&gt; custom instruments and tunings also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I find it important to mention that while Harry Partch often<br/>&gt; focused on an 11-limit system of 43 notes, he also produced some<br/>&gt; beautiful diagrams for a 17-limit system which I saw in a recent<br/>&gt; collection from his manuscripts and correspondence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kathleen Schlesinger, in her _The Greek Aulos_ (1939), describes<br/>&gt; arithmetic divisions using many ratios with these higher factors, and<br/>&gt; people like Erv Wilson and Jacky Ligon have developed these ideas<br/>&gt; further.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Turning now to my own musical experience, an appropriate main focus<br/>&gt; for MMM, I can say that just ratios such as 14:17:21 or 46:56:69<br/>&gt; (23:28 below, 56:69 above) are beautiful and very musically effective<br/>&gt; in the kind of style I often favor. Also, I love melodic steps such as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14:13 (~128.30 cents) for a large semitone or &quot;2/3-tone,&quot; nicely<br/>&gt; contrasting with small semitones or thirdtones such as 28:27 (~62.96<br/>&gt; cents).</p><p>Yes, one of my favourite tetrachords with 14:13 is from Avicenna. I have<br/>especially noticed the effect of this step on other people. Several<br/>react immediately and want to hear it again.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my view, the &quot;debate&quot; here is mostly theoretical: is there<br/>&gt; something &quot;special&quot; about a large minor or small neutral third at<br/>&gt; precisely 17:14 (~336.13 cents), in contrast for example to 63:52<br/>&gt; (~332.21 cents) or to 28:23 (~340.55 cents)? Or are they all examples<br/>&gt; of a general kind of interval around 330-341 cents, say, without any<br/>&gt; special significance for the exact integer ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Either way, they can be used to make some beautiful music, so I<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t be too concerned about this kind of theoretical question --<br/>&gt; maybe I&apos;d consider it while making and enjoying the music, a curious<br/>&gt; kind of contemplation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please note that in using these just ratios, I tune a subset of them<br/>&gt; rather than a complete system of the kind that Partch describes for<br/>&gt; ratios of 11 or 17.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I&apos;m often looking at certain categories of ratios from either a<br/>&gt; melodic or harmonic point of view. Thus something like 14:17:21<br/>&gt; suggests to me a three-voice sonority often resolving to a stable<br/>&gt; fifth, while 14:13 suggests a melodic step, although it might also be<br/>&gt; used as a vertical interval, as I use 13:7 (~1071.70 cents).</p><p>I have foolowed your postings on cadential resolutions very carefully<br/>and with great interest. As a lover and student of chant and early<br/>polyphony medieval music myself I particularly appreciate your approach.<br/>Many of the cadences you have offered  are simple but not easy, if you<br/>know what I mean, and many are just the sort of moves we&apos;d all like our<br/>choirs to be able to sing in three or four parts. One of my aims is to<br/>burrow into this treasure trove of &quot;suggestiveness&quot; around these<br/>cadences and incorporate them into my own particular style, at the<br/>moment with my own instruments, but ultimately with voices.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, Alison, please let me lend you lots of encouragement in<br/>&gt; exploring these higher just ratios.</p><p>Thank you kindly.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For my own music, I already have a certain historical paradigm in<br/>&gt; 13th-14th century European music -- but one subject to lots of<br/>&gt; revisions and additions. Devising a music with these ratios involving<br/>&gt; fewer stylistic preconceptions -- if that&apos;s possible -- could be a<br/>&gt; very interesting direction, with Erv Wilson&apos;s CPS kind of approach as<br/>&gt; one example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, in reference to Harry Partch&apos;s system, I would caution that<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s music is far more than just ratios or JI theory -- it&apos;s music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with its own custom instruments as well as the presence of the<br/>&gt; performers and often the element of the text, and so forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, if the question is whether one can and should make<br/>&gt; beautiful music with just ratios having factors such as 13, 17, 19,<br/>&gt; 23, and so forth, I would say &quot;Yes!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly how or why this music can be so beautiful, I leave to a more<br/>&gt; theoretical discussion, emphasizing that theoretical explanations are<br/>&gt; at best partial and imperfect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively, with peace and love,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo</p><p>As always, sound advice and inspiration.</p><p>Kind regards.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
