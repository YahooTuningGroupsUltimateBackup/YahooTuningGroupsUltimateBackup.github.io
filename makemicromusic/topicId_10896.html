My ways of using<br/>13-intervals are often not so dense (e.g. a simple 22:26:33 or<br/>26:33:44), but even in such a style something like 7:9:11:13 can be<br/>powerfully compelling and &quot;different.&quot; One I find intriguing is<br/>11:16:21:26. By the way, thank you for introducing me to these chords!</p><p>The first brief snippet is a three-voice texture in what is called<br/>conductus style, popular around 1200, realized in JOT-17, a &quot;Just<br/>Octachord Tuning&quot; where each each fourth is divided into seven steps,<br/>and thus an &quot;octachord&quot; of eight notes, for example Bb-A#-B-C-Db-C#-D-Eb.<br/>Here&apos;s the MIDI:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/jot17ex1.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/jot17ex1.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>and here&apos;s the Scala file for JOT-17 (if you have Scala, try the</p><p>KEY 14</p><p>command to see the scale in a Bb-Bb range revealing the largely<br/>superparticular step structure of the octachords based on the<br/>arithmetic or subharmonic series of 28:27:26 and 24:23:22:21):</p><p>! jot17.scl<br/>!<br/>Just octachord tuning -- 9:8-4:3-9:8 division, 17 steps (7 + 3 + 7), C-C<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 91/88<br/> 273/253<br/> 273/242<br/> 13/11<br/> 364/297<br/> 14/11<br/> 117/88<br/> 91/66<br/> 63/44<br/> 3/2<br/> 273/176<br/> 819/506<br/> 819/484<br/> 39/22<br/> 182/99<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s something a bit freer in mixing old and new elements: a piece<br/>called _For Kathleen Schlesinger: Forms of Tonality_, again realized<br/>in a MIDI version in JOT-17. Actually I originally composed this in<br/>another just scale, but it &quot;ports&quot; easily to JOT-17.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/kathton3a.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/kathton3a.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Another mostly note-against-note piece, _Cantilena for George Secor_,<br/>has four-voice harmony, featuring some suspension idioms which might<br/>be taken as mixing 14th-century and 16th-century idioms (a creative<br/>process which unfolded as part of a delightful dialogue with George on<br/>his 17-tone well-temperament or 17-WT, from whom I have learned much<br/>indeed).</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/cantigsj.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Please let me caution that the two versions of the three-voice _O<br/>Europae_ which follow are in the tempered Peppermint system rather<br/>than a just tuning: however, I would consider many of the<br/>approximations of just ratios, including those of 11 and 13, as close<br/>enough to illustrate many of the qualities of the just versions also.<br/>The opening and closing portions draw on typical voice-leading<br/>techniques around 1400, while the middle is more &quot;xenharmonic.&quot;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/o_europ09.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/o_europ09.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/o_europ09.mid">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/o_europ09.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s the Peppermint tuning:</p><p>! peprmint.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint 24: Wilson/Pepper apotome/limma=Phi, 2 chains spaced for pure 7:6<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 58.679693 cents<br/> 128.669246 cents<br/> 187.348938 cents<br/> 208.191213 cents<br/> 7/6<br/> 287.713180 cents<br/> 346.392873 cents<br/> 416.382426 cents<br/> 475.062119 cents<br/> 495.904393 cents<br/> 554.584086 cents<br/> 624.573639 cents<br/> 683.253332 cents<br/> 704.095607 cents<br/> 762.775299 cents<br/> 832.764852 cents<br/> 891.444545 cents<br/> 912.286820 cents<br/> 970.966512 cents<br/> 991.808787 cents<br/> 1050.488479 cents<br/> 1120.478033 cents<br/> 1179.157725 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=10898 href="#10898">ðŸ”—</a>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2005 4:04:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you, that was wonderful and informative.
