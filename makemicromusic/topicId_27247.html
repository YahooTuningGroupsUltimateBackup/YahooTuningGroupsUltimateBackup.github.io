(&quot;Canton&quot; is named after the city in Ohio, by the way, not the one in China.) I don&apos;t hear people talk much about what their methods for composing are, so I figured I&apos;d write this up. The write-up is to focus my own thoughts as much as anything, so feel free to ignore this whole thing. :) But maybe there&apos;s a n00b or two out there who might find this interesting.</p><p>I used Lilypond to generate the score and a 12-TET MIDI file, and Scala to retune that.</p><p>Here are my files:</p><p>MIDI: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese-tuned.mid">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese-tuned.mid</a><br/>Lilypond: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.ly">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.ly</a><br/>PDF score: <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.pdf">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/cantonese.pdf</a></p><p>I hate the MIDI rendering, and would really prefer that the main melody be a violin and the harmony be something reedy, like an English horn. But I got what I got.</p><p>-----<br/>The scale<br/>-----</p><p>Here&apos;s the original &quot;Canton&quot; scale:</p><p>! canton.scl<br/>A 2.3.11/7.13/7 subgroup scale<br/>12<br/>!<br/>14/13<br/>9/8<br/>13/11<br/>14/11<br/>4/3<br/>39/28<br/>3/2<br/>11/7<br/>22/13<br/>16/9<br/>13/7<br/>2/1</p><p>...and here&apos;s the tempered version.</p><p>! cantonpenta.scl<br/>Canton scale in 13-limit pentacircle (351/350 and 364/363) temperament, 271et<br/>12<br/>!<br/>128.41328<br/>208.11808<br/>287.82288<br/>416.23616<br/>495.94096<br/>575.64576<br/>704.05904<br/>783.76384<br/>912.17712<br/>991.88192<br/>1071.58672<br/>1200.00000</p><p>For scoring, it was convenient to label these as if 0 cents were C, and the rest of the names went up just like in 12-TET.</p><p>-----<br/>Analysis phase<br/>-----</p><p>I was attracted to this scale just because it sounded good when I played with it. I have a throwaway Csound file I use to test out some scales, just to get a feel for how some of the notes interact, and I think the 13/11 m3 and 14/11 M3 are pretty cool. I don&apos;t like the 435-cent septimal M3 much, but this 416-cent 11-limit M3 sounds pretty good. The 288-cent m3 is a little less dark than the 266-cent septimal m3, but still not as perky as the 5-limit m3. (My ears have clearly been corrupted by 12-TET: They definitely think a pure 6/5 sounds almost happy.) In fact, playing with the scale made me think that I should try an all-minor scale with a choice of 7/6, 13/11, or 6/5 minor thirds in it for each chord I&apos;m targeting. But I digress.</p><p>The tempered scale makes a 13/11 m3 + a 14/11 M3 add up to a perfect fifth (just slightly sharp at 704 cents), and gives a lot more modes of the scale that have a P5 in them. I decided to work in C minor, so my main chord is 0-288-704 cents, or approximately 22:26:33.</p><p>It was interesting for me to see that in the original scale, the m3 of the iv and v chords would have been off: 5 cents flat on the iv chord, 5 cents sharp on the v chord. The tempering fixed that, and I could do a standard i-iv-v progression with consistent intervals.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t only interested in minor chords; I thought I might use a harmonic minor equivalent, or i-iv-V progression, and the possibility of using other major chords interested me as well. In the just version, there were several different flavors of M3, depending on which root note you chose. For example, the IV chord would be 33/26 instead of 14/11, or about four cents flat; the V chord would be 26/21, or 370 cents. The tempering also helped that out, giving me either 416-cent M3s to approximate the 14/11, or 368-cent M3s on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 8th degrees of the scale (i.e., the Db, D, E, and G major chords). Since those are fully 18 cents flat of a 5/4, and 32 cents flat of a 12-TET M3, I figured they could add some microtonal character to the piece if I chose to use them.</p><p>In short, by just analyzing the heck out of the differences between the just and tempered versions of the scale, I could see a lot about what benefits the tempering gave me, and some of the quirks the scale had relative to 12-TET.</p><p>-----<br/>Composition<br/>-----</p><p>I started with the Cm chord I mentioned above, but didn&apos;t presume I&apos;d stick to a traditional three-flat &quot;diatonic&quot; (albitonic?) version of the scale. To keep things simple, I chose a short motive based on the three notes of the tonic triad, figuring I could adapt it to different chords if I needed variation.</p><p>My first attempts at chord progressions were really just stumbling around. Type some notes into the .ly file, double-click, ctrl-shift-R in Scala to retune, double-click the MIDI file. Tedious. Makes you appreciate having a piano or a guitar around.</p><p>I decided I liked the Cm-Fm sound, just like in traditional harmony. The m7 in the Fm7 chord is 992 cents, so it&apos;s pretty close to what I&apos;m used to in 7th chords anyway, so I used that in a &quot;countermelody&quot; (really just a fast arpeggio) when I played the F chord.</p><p>I was going to do a repeat and move to the v or V chord instead of the iv chord, and quickly realized that sounded too ordinary -- it was just an out-of-tune version of 12-TET. So I decided to use one of the other flattish M3 chords; where the melody stepped C-Eb-G and a half-step up to Ab, I could make it go C-Eb-G and a half-step down to F# instead, which is the 368-cent M3 of the D chord (i.e., this is approximately 42:52:63). I like having the three notes, F#, G, Ab, all prominent in the melody at various points. Weird enough to be not-really-12, not so weird that it sounds like I&apos;m hitting wrong notes.</p><p>That&apos;s a little remarkable when I think about it. I&apos;m 33% down from where I &quot;should&quot; be in 12-TET, and I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m hitting wrong notes. Cool.</p><p>Also worth noting: The II chord would have sounded slightly different from the other chords if not for the tempering, because in the just scale it had a slightly sharp fifth (707 cents).</p><p>Anyway: If I&apos;m at the II, it should sound reasonable to go II-v-i, right? Miracles, it does.</p><p>Lather, rinse, repeat.</p><p>But at the end of the repeat, use II-V-i instead, because I want to transition to a new section.</p><p>Only, since this is a new section, go to VI (Ab major) instead of i. Then use a traditional two-step move down to iv (Fm), again to Dm, then to G: VI-iv-ii-V. Repeat. Close on the i, declare victory.</p><p>-----<br/>Conclusion<br/>-----</p><p>This was an experiment that generated about 40 seconds of music, and I&apos;m wondering if it isn&apos;t too repetitive as it is. :) That said, it showed me how important tempering is, and specifically regular tempering. It led me to see how to use a 13-limit scale in a way that didn&apos;t sound like I was doing something wacky. I guess one could say that it let me be boring in the 13-limit. :)</p><p>What was remarkable about all of this is how similar it seemed to composing in 12-TET. I&apos;m not a composer, but the rules I tried all worked. That actually led me to feel like I wasn&apos;t &quot;composing microtonally&quot;, even though I was using notes up to 28 cents off of 12-TET. The character of the sound is different, though, so I suppose I shouldn&apos;t worry about it too much.</p><p>That&apos;s it for now!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=27250 href="#27250">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2011 10:02:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I finished the ditty that I was working on with the Canton<br/>&gt; pentacircle-tempered scale Gene posted a while back.
