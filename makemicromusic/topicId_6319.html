I have the ability to consume and enjoy consuming large amounts and wide varieties of capiscum. I would characterize capiscum as among my essential foodstuffs.  My wife cannot consume or enjoy large quantities of capiscum. I doubt that she would even call capiscum a spice, let alone a foodstuff.  But somehow, we have managed to find a way of integrating our varied palates within a single kitchen and at the same table.  I find that Capiscum has a quality shared with musical tuning systems: they both directly address our relatives senses, preferences, and capacities for pleasure or pain!</p><p>The question of &quot;any tuning&quot; and how an individual composer or listener is going to deal with it is far from simple and practically bound to be contentious.  This is due to the immediacy of the problem of a getting a useful handle on the huge number and variety of known and potential tunings.  But this is also because music itself is far from simple, as music is made from a volatile mix of sonic pleasure and pain, which mixture has varied over time and geography, and the thresholds of which differ from artist to artist as well as from listener to listener.  Our immediate problem, as a community of musicians committed to opening a Pandora&apos;s box of intonational alternatives: how do we maintain civility in our discourse about music -- and musical tunings -- when our musical values or tastes appear to differ so greatly? The classification and characterization of a tuning can be loaded with assumptions about what music is or does, and we might well benefit as a community  from being honest about those assumptions. I have learned much from research in the natural sciences about music, but at the same time I have often been highly skeptical about the particularity and universality of that research.  On the one hand, knowing what the average listener does when she listens can be useful, but I&apos;m not at all certain that I compose for the &quot;average listener&quot;.  I&apos;d rather compose for the extraordinary listener, someone who is willing to stretch her ears and imagination.  I&apos;d like more research about potential abilities than existing and average abilities!   On the other hand, any research that seems to confirm the universal superiority of musical characteristics unique to the European (or the Chinese or the Indian or the...) tradition, I can only identify as worthless.</p><p>Nevertheless, when the best current neuroscience indicates that among sounds with harmonic spectra, we have a preference for a small set of simple ratios,  in that the brain apparently processes these with greater facility than more complex structures (and within certain neighborhoods of tolerance, insists when possible on a reading as simple ratios), increasing the pleasure of the listeners, this  strikes  me as both  musically  reasonable and  a useful way into organizing my approach to any given tuning.  But -- and again, this is just me speaking -- it&apos;s not the abundance of  the pleasurable that makes a tuning musically useful, it&apos;s the distribution and balance between the pleasurable and the painful.  Consonance and dissonance are qualities that define themselves only relative to one another.  I remember that Erv Wilson did not become particularly enthusiastic about 72-tet until he realized that it had not only good representations of small integer ratios through the 11-limit, but that it also had an excellent representation of Phi, the ratio perhaps furthest away from the JI pleasure garden. At the same time, those who object most strenuously to quantitative analysis of tunings should also recognize that the quantitative information is useful to other musicians, and if they are indeed committed to an anti-numerical program, they owe the rest of us some insight into what that program might be like, or just silence on the topics we find useful.  In my opnion it is insufficient if not meaningless to simply say -- as Ivor Darreg did -- that each tuning has its own &quot;mood&quot;.   12-tet surely has many &quot;moods&quot;, and I will even predict that the potential for new moods within 12-tet is as yet unexhausted, moreover I will even contend that &quot;mood&quot; is more essentially an attribute of composition than of material.   But let&apos;s say for the moment that we wish to embrace the Darregerian typology head on:  what speech acts can we usefully bring to our descriptions other than those embracing numbers or mathematically describeable spaces?   (I write &quot;speech acts&quot; here because the issue irritating this community, now, really concerns the contents in a mailing list, executed mostly in some form of English or another).  Even if we were to agree to a particular distribution of adjectives among the tunings most familiar to this community,  I submit that our supply of adjectives will be swiftly depleted, by the number and variety of tuning environments we wish to characterize.  Or, failing exhaustion, the list will be reduced to a kind of poetry, or to a non-technical discussion that rapidly addresses every topic but the music itself (a la &quot;rock journalism&quot;).  I don&apos;t reckon that many of us are particularily gifted poets and such a peripheral discussion is missing the point about tuning systems -- they are material for music making and independent of any genre. Put another way, one of the reasons that there are so many postings to the various tuning lists with mathematical contents is simply because mathematically oriented discussions are well-suited to the format.  Announcements about concerts, pointers to web pages or recordings, descriptions of instruments or notations, and a bit of history all fit, too.</p><p>With deepest apologies for the prolixity,</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>kylegann1955 &#x3C;kgann@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2004 7:15:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Morton Feldman used to have a standing offer that he&apos;d buy dinner for<br/>the student who could come up with the worst orchestration.

I&apos;ve been teaching a tuning class<br/>&gt; since January, and we&apos;ve learned all the JI 3-limit intervals,<br/>&gt; 5-limit, 7-limit, 11-limit, and now we&apos;re on 13, 17, and 19. Next<br/>&gt; week, after three months, we&apos;ll finally look at some ET tunings and<br/>&gt; see which ones offer what intervals we&apos;ve already learned. I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; imagine going about it backwards and teaching 17tet, 19tet, 22tet,<br/>and<br/>&gt; so on first - it would feel like teaching people to read first and<br/>&gt; then the alphabet later.

And no<br/>interval means any more or any less than any other -- it&apos;s just that<br/>some intervals and chords are harmonically *clearer* than others.</p><p>When you get up to scales, even this clarity criterion no longer<br/>*necessarily* maximized by JI tuning.

People have strong and widely varying opinions on the desireability and proportion of chili peppers in their diet, likewise on dissonance in music.   I happen to be as disastisfied with bland food as with bland harmony.  (And &quot;bland&quot; is itself contextual -- a 12-(or 13- or 14- ...) tone piece with an undifferentiated surface* may be just as bland as  a chorale composed only of the simplest triads).</p><p>I have no doubt that the &quot;cognitive&quot; dimension is also important, and in the right settings, perhaps more important.  One feature in some early works of Satie is a reversal in the consonance/dissonance classification of vertical intervals; thirds, fifths, sixths occur on weak beats and &quot;resolve&quot; into fourths, seconds and sevenths.  Whether through compositional skill or sleight-of-hand, he appeals to cognition over sensation and manages to overide the usual consonance/dissonance regime.  But I have to say this with a caveat -- part of my enjoyment of Satie is recognizing that he is subverting the usual order of things,  but in my recognition of that subversion, am I not simultaneously reifying that usual order?</p><p>Alvin Lucier was my dissertation advisor, so your description strikes me as right on -- but isn&apos;t it the contrast to the flatness of the unisons that makes the beating so vivid?</p><p>DJW</p><p>* This is more an observation for the SpecMus list than for here, but could it be that the greatest failing in a lot of 12-tone music is its egodic character: any random sample is going  to sound statistically pretty much like any other sample;  in contrast, in a work of La Monte Young or Alvin Lucier, the focus on the most local scale of activity forces the listener to locate contrasts more readily.  So the paradox of the working containing everything becoming more boring with longer exposure, while the work with nearly nothing just gets more interesting all the time!</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 8:42:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; When you get up to scales, even this clarity criterion no longer<br/>&gt; *necessarily* maximized by JI tuning.
