That&apos;s basically correct.  I simulated twenty equally-spaced<br/>point masses beginning at rest, and rolling along each of four<br/>Sethares-like dissonance curves.  The integrator has a velocity term,<br/>as well as a first-order friction term.  But there are no collisions:<br/>all the particles&apos; paths are computed independently.  (It might be<br/>very interesting to do something more sophisticated.)  To be as<br/>concrete as possible, here is the very naive integrator code, written<br/>in the programming language Haskell:</p><p>g p m dx dt fc v x = (v&apos;,x&apos;)<br/>    where dp = (p x - p (x+dx))/dx -- approx. change in potential<br/>&#x9;  f = dp  - fc * v -- the force exerted by the field and friction<br/>&#x9;  a = f / m -- Newton&apos;s law (f=ma)<br/>&#x9;  v&apos; = v + a * dt -- approx. velocity in dt seconds<br/>&#x9;  x&apos; = x + v * dt + (v&apos;-v)*dt/2 -- approx. position in dt seconds</p><p>As is typical for such integrators, the simulation thus relies on<br/>constants dt and dx, as well as the mass m of the particle, and the<br/>friction constant fc.  The function p is the potential field, in this<br/>case the dissonance curve.  The constant dt determines the time<br/>resolution of the simulation.  Think of the simulation&apos;s output as<br/>still frames obtained from a strobe light that flashes every dt<br/>seconds, except that at each frame, the simulation also provides the<br/>particles&apos; velocities.</p><p>For each movement, I ran the system for two-hundred frames, and<br/>interpreted the particles&apos; positions as pitch.  But rather than using<br/>the literal time of the frames to determine rhythm---this would be<br/>boring, just twenty simultaneous notes every dt seconds---I used the<br/>particles&apos; velocities: I set the duration of each note to k/(c+|v|),<br/>where k and c are positive constants which I chose by ear.  This is<br/>not an altogether artificial approach, for in this way, the faster a<br/>particle moves, the more rapid are its notes.  However, an additional<br/>consequence of this scheme is that, since I sampled only two-hundred<br/>frames, the quickly moving particles exhaust their frames sooner, and<br/>drop out of the piece.</p><p>It is perhaps natural to wonder to what extent this rhythmic scheme<br/>affects the perceived dynamics of the system.  After some<br/>investigation, I discovered that it is, in fact, very significant.<br/>The particles which dominate the opening of the piece are those with<br/>the greatest initial acceleration, and these are the particles whose<br/>initial positions lie along the dissonance curve&apos;s sharpest slopes.<br/>Conversely, the particles which become dominant only toward the end of<br/>the piece are those which initially accelerate slowly, for instance<br/>those close to the minima corresponding to Just intervals, but also<br/>those close to maxima, where dissonance is greatest!  The latter tend<br/>to begin slowly, but then accelerate dramatically and vanish, while<br/>the former remain relatively slow, and are active until the end of the<br/>piece.</p><p>I hope this response was not unnecessarily technical.  I&apos;ve also<br/>copied this message to the Alternative Tuning list, in case it is a<br/>more appropriate forum, and in case any of its subscribers would find<br/>this interesting.</p><p>Carl</p><p>&gt; If I understand correctly, you&apos;ve taken those Sethares dissonance<br/>&gt; curves, and essentially dropped some balls into them and we&apos;re<br/>&gt; hearing them bouncing around. . . . yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/ripples">http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/ripples</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; studied through William Sethares&apos;s 1998 book.
