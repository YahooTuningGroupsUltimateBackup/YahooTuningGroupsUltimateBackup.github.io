Far from being horrified by &quot;electronic means&quot; (if ever there was a vague description!), I&apos;ve actively worked with three different developers in encouraging (and in one instance, actively working on the beta/debugging team) the implementation of microtuning capabilities. I&apos;m pleased to see that one of the companies, LinPlug, has just announced a new hybrid FM VST synth that is the third instrument they have released that contains microtonal support through direct importing of .tun files.</p><p>I find an awful lot of things in this world &quot;clearly musical&quot;, and a lot of them relate to how, and how well, those resources are used. I wouldn&apos;t want anyone on this list to get the impression wrongly (as I believe in the power of truth) from Gene.</p><p>Thanks for the mention, Gene, and the opportunity to clear this up.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=11163 href="#11163">🔗</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2005 10:14:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I find an awful lot of things in this world &quot;clearly musical&quot;, and a<br/>lot of<br/>&gt; them relate to how, and how well, those resources are used.
