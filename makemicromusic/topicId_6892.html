(this<br/>does have application to the forum, but i have to tell the whole<br/>method)</p><p>basically, i take a large, complicated, wide spectrum noise, and<br/>use a skinny band pass filter tunable to hz.  whereas before i<br/>would have tuned chunks of noise, i want something which has<br/>a bit of movement to it now.  And i don&apos;t want to use a vocoder,<br/>because i can widen the filter and even introduce another for a<br/>variety of cool sliding effects/ harmonic events which turn quickly<br/>and controllably into nonharmonic events.</p><p>so, basically, the application to this forum is that now i have to<br/>use a calculator to figure out the ratios between my hz, and<br/>music theory has become way more complicated for me, now<br/>just dealing with ratios.  the rub is that it&apos;s actually easier now to<br/>figure out the exact ratios then it would be to &quot;devise a<br/>temperament.&quot;  I&apos;m not working with a tonic, per se, that i would<br/>go back to, more of just a theme, and i don&apos;t really mind where in<br/>the spectrum it ends up.</p><p>pretty wacky!</p></div>
