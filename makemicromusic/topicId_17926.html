There is no<br/>need to register.  They simply cannot force you to do that.  I<br/>personally have not had any issues with this, however I have heard<br/>that some are having issues.  I will contact Live365 and try to get<br/>to the bottom of it.  Again, I hope that you will not have any more<br/>issues.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jarod</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jarod,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As explained in my previous rant, when I earlier tried to access<br/>81/80<br/>&gt; radio, I got everything but music -- after 20 minutes of trying to<br/>do so<br/>&gt; and clicking every button and link offered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having successfully registered, I was able to upload the feed right<br/>&gt; away.
