It seems once you have to finger scales at a slant , there is no reason not to make the layout consistant.<br/>One could just as easily introduce a slight slant to the rows of traditionally shaped keys to bring this about. But either way th it is fiunny that the compromise was already in your design.<br/>One of the big problems with the 22 is that it is much more removed from diatonic music than is  acknowledged here. You stated that 22 was closer to a harmonic hexad than 31 which is not the case. the size of a 10/9 for instance could not be further away landing almosst dead in the middle  between two units of this tuning. It has it eccentricies which make it interesting, but as a bridge traditional harmony  or as a close to just scale is stretching the idea as far as one can go. Of course that does not take away from it features as possible scale to use. the less tones one uses the better cause this makes it easier to move around and 22 is thus easier han 31, having played  on both types of instruments.<br/>.</p><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It is a bosonquet layout starting at D# and proceeding to D+ where &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;it &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;is shifted down.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yep.

I don&apos;t recall that, especially because I do not know what a<br/>harmonic hexad is.  Either way, I&apos;m certainly familiar with the fact<br/>that 31 approximates JI much better than 22, which was why 31 was the<br/>first temperament I explored (using my first refretted guitar), so I<br/>don&apos;t think I would have argued anything inconsistent with that.</p><p>&gt;but as a bridge traditional harmony  or as a close<br/>&gt; to just scale is stretching the idea as far as one can go.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d go so far as to say that.  22 is compatible with<br/>diatonicity, except that the thirds are 7-limit instead of 5.  One of<br/>the reasons I prefer 22 is that it has this &quot;septimal&quot; diatonic MOS<br/>scale, whereas in 31 to get a scale using the 7-limit thirds requires<br/>using 3 interval sizes and causes the occurrence of 2 dissonant<br/>triads instead of just one.  Not to mention 22 does 33/32, 9/7,<br/>11/10, 11/8, 64/33 and 16/11 better than 31, and 5/4, 3/2, 4/3,<br/>16/15, 15/8, and 8/5 are only slightly farther off than in 31.  In a<br/>sense 22 is almost a complement of 31 as far as diatonics go.</p><p>Of course<br/>&gt; that does not take away from it features as possible scale to use.<br/>&gt;the  less tones one uses the better cause this makes it easier to<br/>&gt;move around<br/>&gt; and 22 is thus easier han 31, having played  on both types of<br/>&gt;instruments.</p><p>I concur.

It seem if i am understanding you here that if you have more different size intervals this is a bad thing.  One of my problems with temperments in general is that the lack of differentiation between ratios it is supposed to appoximate. It is pretty hard to say just what is consonant and disonant is a scale which , for me, has such a high tolerance. The 9/8 such a bed rock interval in a diatonic ,7 limit or otherwise is pretty sharp. 15 cents, this is as bad as a third in 12 ET. I do prefer a sharp whole tone to a small one and i guess i will not pursuit what the limit of tolerance might be. i guess my point that if i were to use such a scale i would just use it for what it is as opposed to what it appoximates.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!

There is indeed a<br/>scale like that, but I&apos;m not so fond of it.  In fact the whole reason<br/>I am using temperaments is because I like my scales to have only two<br/>interval sizes, since they are consistent that way and easier to<br/>conceptualize.  I&apos;m sure that I&apos;ll eventually develop the patience to<br/>work up some JI theory, but for now I&apos;m keeping it (relatively)<br/>simple (for microtonality).</p><p>&gt;i guess my point that if i were to use such a scale i would just use<br/>it<br/>&gt; for what it is as opposed to what it appoximates.</p><p>Aye, I&apos;m certainly not disputing that.  I didn&apos;t mean to suggest<br/>anything by mentioning the intervals that 22 approximates well.  I am<br/>well aware of how temperaments by definition cause various JI<br/>intervals to converge into one, for example the 163 cent 3-degree<br/>interval in 22 IS close to a Just 11/10, but it is also thought of as<br/>both a 12/11 and a 10/9.</p><p>I think what Jacob was suggesting was that you CAN &quot;think about&quot; 22<br/>as something similar to Just because it does offer a non-MOS major<br/>scale with 3 sizes of 2nd, even though the 2nds don&apos;t really<br/>approximate JI.

He passed this on to me on the tuning list some years ago and<br/>the funny think was that i compared it to some of the bars on my bass<br/>instrument. It was sometimes more than 2&apos;  off but that was not because<br/>of the formula we concluded , but that some of the added bars were a<br/>different run of metal which taught us that the same type of metal can<br/>vary allot. you have to get it all at once and it should be the same<br/>run, which normally what it is.</p><p>this might give you a good idea. basically it is about 2 octaves for<br/>half the length and Partch has a chart of this.</p><p>6061 T6 ( of T5 too i think) aluminum. I have used one inch . i tried<br/>1.5&apos;&apos; for when i tuned up the full hebdomekontany but really was not<br/>pleased with the overall sound.<br/>I have seen a few 2&apos; tubalong which gives you more volume but the price<br/>goes way up and the tone i am not sure is as pure, but it is an option.<br/>best to cut a few sample pieces to make sure you like the sound.</p><p>If the tubes are too long , you start to get the harmonics of the b<br/>tubes instead of the fundamental</p><p>you can use different metal but you have to make sure there are no<br/>seams in it. I made my full dallesandro CPS (36 pitches) out of brass<br/>which i really liked, but in recent years i have not been able to find<br/>seamless brass, and often the places could not tell me if it were or not<br/>so i did allot of driving around, it was not fun.</p><p>   You basically have to cut the tubes long and work your way up<br/>slowly. filing the last bit. If you go too high , use it for the next<br/>pitch up. if you are just barely, barely over you can sand the tubes in<br/>the middle, but this is only a last resort. Sawing or filing will heat<br/>up the bar which LOWERS the pitch, most of the time very slightly,<br/>dipping in water and drying them off or coming back in a few minutes<br/>will take care of this. This phenomenon is more pronounced in bars. With<br/>my bass bars i would wait till the next day to get the last few cents.<br/>which also brings up the influence of temperature. i tune only when it<br/>is 72 degrees  ( ok i will keep going if i am within a degree or two) as<br/>the average.</p><p>   I should mention that if you are going to build acoustic<br/>instruments, you should know that Cris Forster is the person who knows<br/>the most about instrument building. Much of what he knows,  he has put<br/>into his book, and  probably if everyone on the tuning list sent his<br/>foundation $75 each he might have enough funds to  be able to publish it<br/>himself. When i does come out, it will be the definitive book on the<br/>subject.</p><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:</p><p>&gt;Wow.  I think this is going to be quite a learning experience!
