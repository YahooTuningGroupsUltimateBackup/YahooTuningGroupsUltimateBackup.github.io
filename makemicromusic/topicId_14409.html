Also this scale has at most two perfect fifths E-B and (A#=)Bb-F, yet has three tritones built in.</p><p>I&apos;ve written a small piece in this &quot;D minor tritonic hexatonic&quot; scale, emphasising this progression in &quot;thirds&quot;, and scored it for two (MIDI) flutes, not worrying overmuch about playability on analogue instruments.  As a fan of Bartok, I&apos;ve called it, naturally enough, &quot;Deux Chalumeaux&quot;.  I will post it to the files shortly.  [I have posted &quot;Trois Chalumeaux&quot; instead.]</p><p>Question is: what is the &quot;best&quot; JI tuning for this scale, to maximise the consonance of the &quot;thirds&quot;, and keep all the tritones as equal as possible (ie I want two low-limit rational approximations to the square root of 2)?  I want minor and major thirds to be exactly 6/5 and 5/4, and all tritones to be one of two ratios.  Suppose I make D-G# = E-A# = F-B = m/n. Then:<br/>G#-D = A#-E = B-F = (2/1) / (m/n) = 2n/m, and we want m/n ~=2n/m, ie m^2 ~= 2n^2.<br/>D = 1/1<br/>E = 4x/1<br/>F = 6/5<br/>G# = m/n = (4x/1) (5/4) = 5x/1  -&gt; x= m/5n (1)<br/>A# = (4x/1) (m/n) = 4mx/n<br/>B = (6/5) (m/n) = 6m/5n<br/>(1) -&gt; E = 4m/5n, A# = 4m^2/5n^2.</p><p>So the scale is:<br/>D = 1/1, E = 4m/5n, F = 6/5, G# = m/n, A# = 4m^2/5n^2, B = 6m/5n, with m^2 ~= 2n^2.</p><p>Interestingly, E-B is a perfect fifth, whatever m and n we choose.</p><p>Check:<br/>G#-D&apos; ~= m/n and also = (2/1) / (m/n) = 2n/m, consistent with m^2 ~= 2n^2.<br/>A#-D&apos; ~= 5/4 and also = (2/1) / (4m^2/5n^2) = 5n^2/2m^2, consistent with m^2 ~= 2n^2.<br/>B-D&apos; = 6/5 and also = (2/1) / (6m/5n) = 5n/3m, giving m/n = 25/18, and (25/18)^2 ~= 1.93.</p><p>So a tuning for this scale is, when m/n = 25/18:<br/>D = 1/1, E = 10/9, F = 6/5, G# = 25/18, A# = 125/81, B = 5/3.</p><p>The interval E-B is 5/3 x 9/10 = 3/2, a perfect fifth.<br/>The interval A#-F&apos; is 12/5 x 81/125 = 972/625, or 648/625 times a perfect fifth.  That is, it is a &quot;quintal comma&quot; greater than a perfect fifth.</p><p>(Note: For A#-F&apos; to be a perfect fifth, we would have to tune A# as 2 x (6/5) / (3/2) = 8/5.  But A# = 4m^2/5n^2, -&gt; m^2 = 2n^2.  This would produce the tuning: G# ~= 1.4142 = 7071/5000 ~= 1.414 = 707/500 ~=1.41 = 3x47/100 ~= 1.4 = 7/5, none of which are 5-limit tunings of the tritone.)</p><p>The &quot;D minor tritonic hexatonic&quot; scale, in 12-EDO, uses the step numbers:<br/>D = 0, E = 2, F = 3, G# = 6, A# = 8, B = 9, (D&apos; = 12)</p><p>The &quot;D minor tritonic hexatonic&quot; scale, in 5-limit JI, uses the ratios:<br/>D = 1/1, E = 10/9, F = 6/5, G# = 25/18, A# = 125/81, B = 5/3, (D&apos; = 2/1)</p><p>I note that Jon Smith has extended this 5-limit tuning to a 12-note scale, which he might like to tell us about - Jon?<br/>_________________</p><p>Now, I would like to invite you all to use the same &quot;minor tritonic hexatonic&quot; scale to write some music, simple or complex.  Unlike Jacob, I can&apos;t promise a performance on specially-tuned instruments!  Still, it would be instructive to learn what others can make from the same, small tonal resource.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.394 / Virus Database: 268.10.5/403 - Release Date: 28/7/06</p></div><h3><a id=14410 href="#14410">ðŸ”—</a>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2006 7:43:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Yahya.</p><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz escreveu:<br/>&gt; Hi,<br/>&gt; &gt; [I wrote the following before adding a third part to produce the<br/>&gt; piece called &quot;Trois Chalumeaux&quot;, which I posted today.
