And it isn&apos;t that I think (as I hope I made at least a little clear) that there is less need for the single-focus dedication of the traditional C. But if, as you said at the end of your one message that we must look to the end result - the Music - for the ultimate validation, then I think we can hear what we can call a Composition, and its creator - in whatever mode, fashion, or implementation they used - has served the ultimate purpose a C can strive for: fashioning sound into a communication that reaches people, in a way that no other form can, and with information and experience that can&apos;t be conveyed otherwise.</p><p>An aside (gad, I hope I haven&apos;t written this before): after this recent concert, where Steve and I performed an improvisation for about 4-5 minutes, I was spoken to by the C who had just had a World Premier (WP). He asked how we developed our &apos;materials&apos; for the C we had played, and almost refused to believe that we had made it up on the fly. &quot;But it was so structured!&quot; he implored. I then had to disappoint him with the fact that prior to mounting the stage (love that expression), time constraints had conspired against us to the point that we had only played on the Found Sound constructed instruments for a total of about 60 seconds.</p><p>Of course, I owe most of the credit to the incredible musicianship embodied in Steve Schick, but there you have it: a real life C, fully believing our &apos;music of the moment&apos; was a through-composed piece.</p><p>Life is interesting.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2930 href="#2930">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>5/14/2002 4:55:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;5.1.0.14.2.20020513153148.02cd4d80@...&gt;<br/>Jonathan M.

The problem brought up by that recently<br/>quoted article is that it isn&apos;t obvious how computer-based musicians are<br/>contributing to the live experience.  So either the audience will learn to<br/>understand what&apos;s happening, or the interfaces will improve and become<br/>easier to understand.  If you want to experience musicians interacting in<br/>a complex way, the nature of composition or improvisation doesn&apos;t really<br/>change.</p><p>What the musicians are doing might change drastically, and the composers<br/>will have to adjust to that.  You may find (and already do) that composers<br/>spend time preparing audio samples instead of giving instructions to<br/>performers.  But for the result to differ from a (cheaper) recording,<br/>there has to be some kind of improvisation or composition.

One of the greatest &apos;musical&apos; environments I&apos;ve ever experienced was Tudor&apos;s &quot;Rainforest&quot; at the Berlin New Music Festival in 1980. A large room filled with an array of big, metal &apos;sculptures&apos;, many incorporating junk and found metal objects. They all had transducers attached, and were being fed sounds from a collective of performers operating tape decks with the composer and others mixing live (the sounds coming from the sculptures *rarely* resembled the source material, as the transducers were causing the objects to act as vibrating &apos;speaker cones&apos;, as it were).</p><p>The sound was **incredible**, and as you walked among the creations (including one rotating overhead) it was hard not to believe you weren&apos;t in some other-worldly rainforest environment, filled with many species of sounds. This was all captured on an LP that I found later that year, recorded binaurally, so a headphone experience is eerily like being there.</p><p>Improvised? To a degree. Composed? To a pretty fair degree.</p><p>Yet another (thankfully) grey area...</p><p>&gt;You could define it that way, but what&apos;s wrong with the word &quot;improviser&quot;?</p><p>Oh, nothing at all. I find it easily as estimable as &quot;composer&quot;.</p><p>&gt;We don&apos;t need such people to make good music and never have done.</p><p>No, but one thing I&apos;m thinking is that maybe they should be getting some philosophical credit even if they aren&apos;t, categorically, &quot;composers&quot;. Dunno, just musing...</p><p>&gt;some kind of composition will always be required if you want to make good, &gt;complex<br/>&gt;music as a live performance.</p><p>I don&apos;t know that I can whole-heartedly endorse that statement.

I certainly don&apos;t want to beat an expired equine, but the corporeal nature of live music - the visual, visceral aspects - are not only what sets it apart from recordings, but also from those performances that are simply not visceral: a person manipulating music from a laptop computer, or about 95% of a symphony orchestra concert. While the wall of sound that an orch can pump out is hard to duplicate (and bear in mind I sit in the middle of that sound on a weekly basis), it is *painfully* clear to me, from *attending* orch concerts that it is deadly dull to watch those players play soaring, involved music, all while looking like they are strapped into their seats with pencils rammed up their rears.</p><p>No wonder I enjoy being in the back banging on drums.

The work you do<br/>before a performance is composition, and what you do in performance<br/>that wasn&apos;t planned is improvisation.  This distinction doesn&apos;t make<br/>sense for a recording as a thing in itself.</p><p>&gt; So true! I certainly don&apos;t want to beat an expired equine, but the<br/>&gt; corporeal nature of live music - the visual, visceral aspects - are<br/>not<br/>&gt; only what sets it apart from recordings, but also from those<br/>performances<br/>&gt; that are simply not visceral: a person manipulating music from a<br/>laptop<br/>&gt; computer, or about 95% of a symphony orchestra concert.

Apparently,<br/>it&apos;s something to do with instinct, so that&apos;s okay.  The visual is a<br/>red herring.  You can record pictures as well as sound.  Films of live<br/>performances are much less popular than live performances themselves.<br/> There&apos;s a big emphasis over here on live relays (even &quot;live<br/>recordings&quot;) on the radio.</p><p>The thing that most impressed me at my first orchestral concert was<br/>how much better the music sounded than it looked.  It was a wondrous<br/>thing that such a beautiful sound could be produced by such an<br/>unlikely group of people.  It shows they really were working on that<br/>extra 5%.</p><p>The best band I&apos;ve seen were the Boredoms in 1995.  They were a<br/>strange mixture from the corporeal viewpoint.  On the one hand they<br/>did have two drummers pounding away at the back.  But a lot of the<br/>sound, especially at times the vocals, was so heavily processed I<br/>didn&apos;t know where it was coming from.</p><p>You may think a laptop can&apos;t be used instinctively as a musical<br/>instrument.  But if somebody told you 30 years ago that people would<br/>become millionares by playing records in public, would you have<br/>believed them?  The visual aspect is easily fixed -- use a projector<br/>or a plasma screen.  For it to work as a performance, the audience<br/>need to have some idea what the performer&apos;s doing.  Because they don&apos;t<br/>now doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t ever.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what &quot;corporeal&quot; should mean in this context.  It&apos;s tied<br/>up with one particular theorist who was a doctrinaire modernist in<br/>many ways.  Truth to materials and all that.  Computers are profoundly<br/>post-modern devices.  A computer has no natural connection with the<br/>human body, so any interface you give it is a facade.  You can get<br/>them to respond to human instinct on a highly intellectual level.</p><p>You could use an interface that can be bashed and stroked like a<br/>physical instrument.  But it&apos;s an illusion of corporeality.  Bashing<br/>doesn&apos;t make a sound (or not one the audience hears) it only gives the<br/>computer instructions for making sound.  As far as making music is<br/>concerned, this isn&apos;t a problem, so long as you don&apos;t cling to your<br/>modernist ideals.</p><p>Or something like that.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2943 href="#2943">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2002 7:54:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;x31eq&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_2916.html#2941">/makemicromusic/topicId_2916.html#2941</a></p><p>&gt; The thing that most impressed me at my first orchestral concert was<br/>&gt; how much better the music sounded than it looked.

When you &gt;get 10 or more people on stage, they have to follow stereotyped patterns, &gt;or some kind of<br/>&gt;arrangement, or you end up with a mess.</p><p>In a sense, yes. But there are other forms of collaborative composition that lie somewhere between total, chaotic improvisation and strict adherence to a written score. For example, traditional New Orleans-style jazz, which may be on a tune done millions of times, but being freely elaborated on by all members of the band (which can easily be 10 or more in a second-line funeral march) simultaneously. Definitely more towards improvisation, but just as a yin-yang to the classical symphony item.</p><p>&gt;Okay, I&apos;ll define &quot;composition&quot; and &quot;improvisation&quot;.  The work you do &gt;before a performance is composition, and what you do in performance that &gt;wasn&apos;t planned is improvisation.</p><p>Fair enough. What about a composition that relies on improvisation for its main body of construction? (no need to answer, just tossing things around...)</p><p>&gt;I had to look up &quot;visceral&quot; to see exactly what it means.  Apparently, &gt;it&apos;s something to do with instinct, so that&apos;s okay.  The visual is a red &gt;herring.</p><p>I disagree. I believe that in many forms of live music, the visual element *as well as* the aural element is important. Note that I don&apos;t believe this in a &apos;knee-jerk&apos; response to my having worked with Partch, although that certainly nailed it. I happen to have been excited by performers that were physically involved long before that (I mean, I got into playing drums from watching the very first Beatles performance on the Ed Sullivan show as a wee laddy!).</p><p>&gt;You can record pictures as well as sound.  Films of live performances are &gt;much less popular than live performances themselves.</p><p>Yes, and that is because the visceral, flesh-and-blood energy of a live performance is hard to transmit (I&apos;m getting pretty OT here, so I&apos;ll try to curve back...)</p><p>&gt;The thing that most impressed me at my first orchestral concert was how &gt;much better the music sounded than it looked.</p><p>No kidding: we look like a bunch of stiffs.</p><p>&gt;It was a wondrous thing that such a beautiful sound could be produced by &gt;such an<br/>&gt;unlikely group of people.</p><p>I still feel that way, sitting on stage. It is a pretty weird disconnect at times.</p><p>&gt;You may think a laptop can&apos;t be used instinctively as a musical instrument.</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean to give *that* impression, because I firmly believe that they already can, and will only improve in the future. *However*, while they may be *musically* valid, I think that - now and forever - as a *performance* vehicle, any &apos;instrument&apos; that is manipulated in a non-physically-involving manner will always leave an audience cold, certainly if they have alternatives.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know what &quot;corporeal&quot; should mean in this context.  It&apos;s tied up &gt;with one particular theorist who was a doctrinaire modernist in many ways.</p><p>Well, I hope we can go more to the root of the word - &apos;of the body&apos; - in this instance, because I&apos;m talking about the physicality of a medium that goes far beyond an American hobo. And I believe that humans, given a choice, will always prefer a more-involved (physically) than a less-involved experience.</p><p>That said, there are many &apos;composers&apos; that aren&apos;t especially interested in this, and that makes sense as well. Again, I&apos;m wandering...</p><p>&gt;As far as making music is concerned, this isn&apos;t a problem, so long as you &gt;don&apos;t cling to your modernist ideals.</p><p>I prefer to think of them as primitivist ideals. :)</p><p>&gt;Or something like that.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2947 href="#2947">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
