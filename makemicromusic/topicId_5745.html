I&apos;ve recorded many improvisations in non-twelve equal<br/>temperaments since then, so I&apos;ll probably continue to upload them at my<br/>leisure.  I think they&apos;re getting better, but let me know if you disagree.</p><p>I&apos;m currently student teaching with a couple of music teachers in Syracuse.<br/>It&apos;s going very well, and I&apos;m having much more fun than I expected.  I have<br/>decided to focus more on student teaching than xenharmonics for a few<br/>months, so if I record more improvisations they will be few.  I was doing<br/>both, but I&apos;m finding it&apos;s a lot of new stuff for me to have in my brain at<br/>once, and it&apos;s sometimes overwhelming.</p><p>Tonight is also the first chance I&apos;ve had to listen to the pieces by &quot;pfly&quot;<br/>and Prent Rogers, both of which I think are great.  Before I started doing<br/>any of this stuff myself, I found music by both of you and it inspired me.<br/>These pieces have been a treat for me tonight.  Thank you.</p><p>Merry musicmaking to all,<br/>Andrew Heathwaite</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
