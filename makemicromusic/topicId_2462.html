Now with this musical scenario, was the difficulty from<br/>&gt; &gt; the irregular pulses, or was it the cycle in itself?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If the latter, do you find that the more remote a rhythmic cycle is<br/>&gt; &gt; from a 2 based cycle, it becomes more difficult to play?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Like - would you say that 13 is more difficult than 17?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just curious,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Jacky<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Feral one,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, any meter is easy, as long as whatever the part is makes sense<br/>&gt; melodically. By that I mean, If there is a loop or repeating figure, I just<br/>&gt; keep that in my mind, or sing along with the part (inaudible) as I play. No<br/>&gt; matter what the meter/s, I&apos;m on track because I&apos;m listening to the structure<br/>&gt; melodically, not just counting combo&apos;s of 2 and 3, which is a kind of<br/>&gt; crutch, and leads many composers to (imho) stilted odd time music. Zappa is<br/>&gt; a good for instance. Whether its 19/16 or 7/8, Zappa always had his odd time<br/>&gt; broken down into those 2 and 3 combos. It all starts to sound the same to me<br/>&gt; after awhile. Dave Holland does this alot, although I forgive him because he<br/>&gt; is such a beautiful person, and not a shabby composer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Get out yer manuscript paper, and dig this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1   an   2   an   3      4  e  an  ah    5     6     7<br/>&gt;                        Q.

Once you get the &quot;song&quot; or &quot;melody&quot; of it, its<br/>&gt; easy to know where you are, and feel comfortable. The quarter rest at the<br/>&gt; end of this ex. is important, becauseto me, its like the gong tone in a<br/>&gt; gamelan balungan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Doo doo daa daa                 da-boom       boom     (gong)   Rinse,<br/>&gt; lather, repeat.<br/>&gt; 1       an   2     an   3, 4 e an ah   5              6             7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, that 7 is like a one. I can throw down there, the absence is so<br/>&gt; strong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m glad I found a more painful way to notate than normal western practice.<br/>&gt; Everybody should learn Indonesian cipher and get on with it. IMHO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could write a book about rhythm here, but then everyone would quit the<br/>&gt; list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Viva tenacity!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]-------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More music files from MMM are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music/">http://www.microtonal.org/music/</a><br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
