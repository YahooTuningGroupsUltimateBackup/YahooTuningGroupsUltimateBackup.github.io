Only problem is:<br/>I am unable to control the softsynth remotely with my Roland HP-2800G. I&apos;m really<br/>not sure what the problem is or how to diagnose it. I know the HP-2800G works fine<br/>as a MIDI controller since I have it correctly hooked to the Mac via a TASCAM US-428<br/>MIDI interface-- the connection is confirmed working since I use it all the time to<br/>input notation with Sibelius. I put an email into LinPlug, but I bet somebody here<br/>knows the answer. Also: I&apos;m not quite sure how to load patches, but I&apos;ll read the<br/>manual more thoroughly.

I&apos;ve got CronoX set up with Ugly VSTi and they work together<br/>&gt;beautifully.</p><p>Yaya! Now let&apos;s diagnose...</p><p>&gt;I am able to hear the sounds from the softsynth through the computer &gt;speakers and the microtonal scales load without a hitch-- amazing. Only &gt;problem is:<br/>&gt;I am unable to control the softsynth remotely with my Roland HP-2800G.</p><p>You mean &quot;when I play the kbd it doesn&apos;t activate the synth&quot;, right? I say this because one of the things you can do is automate the knobs and sliders by sending info from a midi kbd, etc. But you mean just play, right?</p><p>So when you hear sounds from the synth, is that by using the mouse and clicking on the on-screen kbd?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m really not sure what the problem is or how to diagnose it. I know the &gt;HP-2800G works fine as a MIDI controller since I have it correctly hooked &gt;to the Mac via a TASCAM US-428 MIDI interface-- the connection is &gt;confirmed working since I use it all the time to input notation with Sibelius.</p><p>I have a funny feeling it might be the Ugly VSTi host. If you have any chance of trying out another softsynth, even if it isn&apos;t microtonal, you might want to do that - if neither is getting input from your Roland, then it is the host that is not working properly. You might try Crystal:</p><p><a href="http://www.greenoak.com/crystal/index.html">http://www.greenoak.com/crystal/index.html</a></p><p>A completely free softsynth that sounds very nice and has OSX versions for both VST and AU.</p><p>&gt;I put an email into LinPlug, but I bet somebody here knows the answer. &gt;Also: I&apos;m not quite sure how to load patches, but I&apos;ll read the manual &gt;more thoroughly.</p><p>It&apos;s possible you have to download some preset patches separately, I think I did. When you have patches extracted to a folder somewhere, the window under &quot;Presets&quot; shows a patch name, and left/right arrows surrounding a folder icon. The arrows go to the prev and next patches in that folder, and the folder icon opens up a list that you can pick from or change to another folder. Pretty straight-forward.</p><p>BTW, I thought of you and your pals tonight as I was looking for stuff. Are you already aware of:</p><p><a href="http://www.osxaudio.com/">http://www.osxaudio.com/</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5259 href="#5259">ðŸ”—</a>John Loffink &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2003 8:33:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It sounds like you need to select/enable the MIDI port from within Ugly VSTi<br/>or Cronox.
