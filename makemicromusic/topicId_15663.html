We could really<br/>use such art now, as the world is in a bad bad place, and appears to be<br/>getting worse real soon. And, I&apos;ve long believed that great art is a<br/>wonderful balance to the madness that occurs in the world, and can give<br/>people hope for better times, and a more peaceful planet on which to<br/>live. I&apos;d like to be part of such art/music, and hoping there is a lot<br/>of it in the near future...&quot;</p><p>Amen, brother. Couldn&apos;t have said it better.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>jl</p></div>
