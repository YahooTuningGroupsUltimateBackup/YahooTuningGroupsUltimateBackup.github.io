The<br/>durations need to be written measure by measure as they read on score,<br/>and there is no support for durations that cross bar lines or like. In<br/>its turn, LilyPond can break down strange/complex durations into valid<br/>(tied) figures.</p><p>If you want just write scores with ABC, use the Sagittal character<br/>code in the accidental: ^/196A is A#, _/134E is E\, etc. ; and<br/>instruct abcm2ps to load sagittal.fmt or sagittal-pfb.fmt. This case,<br/>microabc is not required, but the ABC cannot be converted to MIDI,<br/>only to PS.</p><p>However, you could use Sagittal macros for microabc ([A#], [E\] etc.);<br/>that allows converting the ABP (ABC Before Processing) file to both PS<br/>and MIDI.</p><p>There are some additional issues (like key signatures and hidden<br/>accidentals), but we can broach them in their time.</p><p>The microtonal support in ABC uses extensions which are specific to<br/>abcm2ps and abc2midi. To understand how the things work, it is<br/>recommended to read the documentation of both programs (in special<br/>abcm2ps*/features.txt and abcmidi/doc/abcguide.txt).</p><p>Some links:</p><p><a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/</a><br/><a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abctools">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abctools</a></p><p><a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abcMIDI">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abcMIDI</a><br/><a href="http://ifdo.pugmarks.com/%7Eseymour/runabc/top.html">http://ifdo.pugmarks.com/%7Eseymour/runabc/top.html</a></p><p><a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abcm2ps">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#abcm2ps</a><br/><a href="http://moinejf.free.fr/">http://moinejf.free.fr/</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/format.html">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/format.html</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/abcm2ps-html-en.zip">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/abcm2ps-html-en.zip</a></p><p>.</p></div><h3><a id=18266 href="#18266">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2008 2:32:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello all,</p><p>Good news:</p><p>I managed to compile a DOS version of microabc, using gcc4dos on a<br/>FreeDOS operating system (running inside qemu on Debian GNU+Linux).

You guys have my utmost respect for your<br/>expertise using computers in these amazing ways.</p><p>When I make a naive comment like I did about a front-end,<br/>as a programmer I come from the other side of the universe,<br/>in a way. Comments I make about programming usually drive<br/>real programmers bonkers, because I have only done high-<br/>level programming myself and have never had the inclination<br/>or patience to get into low-level work. I design programs<br/>starting with a GUI in an environment which hides all the<br/>low-level work from me. And I also hide everything I<br/>possibly can from the user, to make it all as point and click<br/>as possible. Working this way has its trade-offs, such as<br/>unnecessarily bulky programs, but the result is basically a<br/>point and click multi-platform package.</p><p>It appears to be a problem with all the Linux open-source etc.<br/>projects (which can be amazing in terms of what they<br/>accomplish) that they don&apos;t work easily. Most people expect<br/>drag and drop, point and click, plug and play stuff, and<br/>relatively few folks will want to take the time to do anything<br/>else. I guess on Windows everyone still expects an installer,<br/>but on Mac everyone expects one-step installation. Personally,<br/>anytime I have tried to install something that requires<br/>putting many things in many places, and configuring some<br/>of them, I _never_ have success. I think first most people will<br/>never even try something like that and if they do they<br/>probably have an experience like mine, and so most people<br/>never try anything that is being done this way; there just<br/>isn&apos;t time and patience enough to go around.</p><p>But in no way do I want to be discouraging. On the contrary,<br/>I just want to see software that is packaged and works<br/>without the user having to worry about _any_ low-level tasks.<br/>That has become a practical requirement for me from software<br/>that I use, and it is what I want to accomplish in the software<br/>that I write. I try, anyway.</p><p>I applaud your work and I&apos;m sure it will continue to become<br/>more streamlined in future releases. Maybe something I said<br/>is useful. If not, please just ignore it and keep working your<br/>own way!</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good news:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I managed to compile a DOS version of microabc, using gcc4dos on a<br/>&gt; FreeDOS operating system (running inside qemu on Debian GNU+Linux).

Nothing better!

It will<br/>be a sort of IDE.</p><p>Here are a few screenshots of the first sketch (just the window:<br/>commands are not implemented yet):</p><p>TKmicroabc:<br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc.png">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc.png</a></p><p>TKmicroabc (the two small windows top/right), Jef Moine&apos;s tkabc (the<br/>top window, editing quartertone accidentals), scala (bottom/right), gv<br/>(showing a PostScript score) and timidity++ (using XAW interface):<br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc2.png">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc2.png</a></p><p>The irony of the first screenshot is that a typical microabc session<br/>may be written as a bash script with 3 ~ 8 lines...</p><p>The session represented in that first figure will correspond (in its<br/>essence) to the commands:</p><p>abc2alias &lt; <a href="http://input.abc">input.abc</a> &gt; sagittal.abp<br/>microabc -iinput.txt -S1 -Psagittal.abp -ooutput-ps.abc<br/>abcm2ps <a href="http://output-ps.abc">output-ps.abc</a> -Fsagittal.pfb -Ooutput.ps<br/>microabc -iinput.txt -S1 -Msagittal.abp -ooutput-mid.abc<br/>abc2midi -RS <a href="http://output-mid.abc">output-mid.abc</a> 1 -o output.mid<br/>gv <a href="http://output.ps">output.ps</a> &amp;<br/>timidity output.mid</p><p>(TKmicroabc will supply the full paths for the programs and files, and<br/>handle temporary files.)</p><p>I am planning to export the commands as bash scripts or Makefiles<br/>(besides saving the sessions as tcl scripts), so that the users can<br/>get rid of the point-and-click torment and just issue a simple command<br/>on a terminal window as soon as the script is generated! 8^D</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It appears to be a problem with all the Linux open-source etc.<br/>&gt; projects (which can be amazing in terms of what they<br/>&gt; accomplish) that they don&apos;t work easily. Most people expect<br/>&gt; drag and drop, point and click, plug and play stuff, and<br/>&gt; relatively few folks will want to take the time to do anything<br/>&gt; else.</p><p>Problem with all the projects???</p><p>There are programs which are not easy to _configure_, but finding and<br/>installing packaged programs for GNU+Linux is rather simple, for<br/>example, by using Synaptic. (Have you tried Debian or Ubuntu?)</p><p>Yet, all the best distributions install by default the most commonly<br/>required dependencies, like tcl-tk and ghostscript. abc2midi and<br/>abcm2ps also are available in the repositories of several &apos;distros&apos;.</p><p>...and they have the advantage of to respecting the user freedom and<br/>being morally correct. ;-)</p><p>&gt; I guess on Windows everyone still expects an installer,<br/>&gt; but on Mac everyone expects one-step installation.</p><p>Interested programmers always can create such installers, since the<br/>programs related to microabc are all multi-plataform and free<br/>software. I am not in either OSes, so don&apos;t expect more than FreeDOS<br/>binaries or GNU Makefiles from me... some day I might create a *.deb<br/>package...</p><p>Note that there are ABC installers for Windows out there. For<br/>instance, ABCEdit &grave;&grave;is a Windows program that integrates abcm2ps,<br/>abc2midi and GhostView in a single package.&apos;&apos;:<br/><a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#ABCEdit">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#ABCEdit</a></p><p>It only misses microabc :-) (and the optional abcpp).</p><p>&gt; Personally,<br/>&gt; anytime I have tried to install something that requires<br/>&gt; putting many things in many places, and configuring some<br/>&gt; of them, I _never_ have success.<br/>&gt; I think first most people will<br/>&gt; never even try something like that and if they do they<br/>&gt; probably have an experience like mine, and so most people<br/>&gt; never try anything that is being done this way; there just<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t time and patience enough to go around.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The front-end TKmicroabc will not change too much the things in this<br/>respect, since it will depend on a Tcl-Tk interpreter installed on the<br/>system.</p><p>By the other hand, the choice of tcl-tk is intended exactly to make<br/>TKmicroabc plataform-independent, with no need of compiling. Another<br/>advantage is that the configuration of programs (paths, auxiliary<br/>files) may be centralised, and stored in a resource file.</p><p>(There are ways to make stand-alone executables from tcl-tk scripts.<br/>See for instance <a href="http://www.equi4.com/tclkit/">http://www.equi4.com/tclkit/</a> . But that is not a task<br/>I would put in my TODO list.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But in no way do I want to be discouraging. On the contrary,<br/>&gt; I just want to see software that is packaged and works<br/>&gt; without the user having to worry about _any_ low-level tasks.<br/>&gt; That has become a practical requirement for me from software<br/>&gt; that I use, and it is what I want to accomplish in the software<br/>&gt; that I write. I try, anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I applaud your work and I&apos;m sure it will continue to become<br/>&gt; more streamlined in future releases. Maybe something I said<br/>&gt; is useful. If not, please just ignore it and keep working your<br/>&gt; own way!</p><p>Thanks for you inputs.

At least this way<br/>the user can keep track of each of the components and exactly<br/>what commands are being sent to them at all times.</p><p>Maybe the most important question fo you to consider as you<br/>work on this is whether you want to make a tool mostly for your<br/>own use, or for use by the open-source community, or for use<br/>by the greatest number of people.</p><p>It sounds like you really want as many other people as possible<br/>to be able to use this, or you would not be putting so much<br/>effort into changing the interface at all, since you prefer<br/>command line. But then it should be recognized that most<br/>people who want to get music notation and playback from<br/>a computer do not want to have an experience at the machine<br/>which feels like programming, and the ideal is to have<br/>an interface which feels essentially like a graphic design<br/>tool for music. Thus, ideally all of the processing in its various<br/>components should be hidden from the user, who is not<br/>interested in how they fit together or what they do, or how<br/>they must be configured. They just want to see and hear<br/>music, so the program should take care of all those<br/>low-level tasks.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are writing for the open-source<br/>community, the opposite is true. People who use Linux and<br/>open-source software tend to be at least hobbyist<br/>computer programmers who actually enjoy tinkering<br/>around with every last component of the system. I think it<br/>should be emphasized that is a minority community, and<br/>most people absolutely do _not_ want to tinker with the<br/>system - on the contrary it is the last thing they want to<br/>worry about.</p><p>But then it could be said that the general user (who is not<br/>a computer programmer of any kind) will just buy Finale<br/>or Sibelius. Maybe that is true, but those programs are<br/>very expensive, of course.</p><p>Regarding user interface for music notation, I think<br/>relatively few notation programs feel like writing music<br/>with a pencil. Finale has never felt that way (it&apos;s a terrible<br/>interface in my opinion). Sibelius is a lot better. A program<br/>called Overture (which fewer people use and which is quite<br/>poorly supported by its designer, at least on Mac) is closest<br/>to what I am talking about. It essentially works like a graphic<br/>design program, giving postscript and MIDI output. I realize<br/>now that these examples are way beyond what you are aiming<br/>for with your microabc work, particularly when this is just your<br/>hobby! But, I think even so it is probably helpful to have well<br/>in mind that the majority of folks who would be interested<br/>in trying out some notation software want something that<br/>feels a lot like writing music with a pencil, so to minimize<br/>the command-line feeling of it, to hide as much of the<br/>inner workings under the hood, so to speak, and to package<br/>it so that it installs easily will increase the user pool, I think.</p><p>Again, this is just my opinion and I highly commend your<br/>efforts!</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;aaronhunt@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dear Hudson (and Prent),<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am always amazed when such tremendous effort goes into<br/>&gt; &gt; the creation of tools and ways to get microtonal music to<br/>&gt; &gt; happen, especially when there is so much low-level work<br/>&gt; &gt; being done.

It will<br/>&gt; be a sort of IDE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are a few screenshots of the first sketch (just the window:<br/>&gt; commands are not implemented yet):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TKmicroabc:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc.png">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TKmicroabc (the two small windows top/right), Jef Moine&apos;s tkabc (the<br/>&gt; top window, editing quartertone accidentals), scala (bottom/right), gv<br/>&gt; (showing a PostScript score) and timidity++ (using XAW interface):<br/>&gt; <a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc2.png">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tkmicroabc2.png</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The irony of the first screenshot is that a typical microabc session<br/>&gt; may be written as a bash script with 3 ~ 8 lines...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The session represented in that first figure will correspond (in its<br/>&gt; essence) to the commands:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; abc2alias &lt; <a href="http://input.abc">input.abc</a> &gt; sagittal.abp<br/>&gt; microabc -iinput.txt -S1 -Psagittal.abp -ooutput-ps.abc<br/>&gt; abcm2ps <a href="http://output-ps.abc">output-ps.abc</a> -Fsagittal.pfb -Ooutput.ps<br/>&gt; microabc -iinput.txt -S1 -Msagittal.abp -ooutput-mid.abc<br/>&gt; abc2midi -RS <a href="http://output-mid.abc">output-mid.abc</a> 1 -o output.mid<br/>&gt; gv <a href="http://output.ps">output.ps</a> &amp;<br/>&gt; timidity output.mid<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (TKmicroabc will supply the full paths for the programs and files, and<br/>&gt; handle temporary files.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am planning to export the commands as bash scripts or Makefiles<br/>&gt; (besides saving the sessions as tcl scripts), so that the users can<br/>&gt; get rid of the point-and-click torment and just issue a simple command<br/>&gt; on a terminal window as soon as the script is generated! 8^D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It appears to be a problem with all the Linux open-source etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; projects (which can be amazing in terms of what they<br/>&gt; &gt; accomplish) that they don&apos;t work easily. Most people expect<br/>&gt; &gt; drag and drop, point and click, plug and play stuff, and<br/>&gt; &gt; relatively few folks will want to take the time to do anything<br/>&gt; &gt; else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Problem with all the projects???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are programs which are not easy to _configure_, but finding and<br/>&gt; installing packaged programs for GNU+Linux is rather simple, for<br/>&gt; example, by using Synaptic. (Have you tried Debian or Ubuntu?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet, all the best distributions install by default the most commonly<br/>&gt; required dependencies, like tcl-tk and ghostscript. abc2midi and<br/>&gt; abcm2ps also are available in the repositories of several &apos;distros&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...and they have the advantage of to respecting the user freedom and<br/>&gt; being morally correct. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I guess on Windows everyone still expects an installer,<br/>&gt; &gt; but on Mac everyone expects one-step installation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interested programmers always can create such installers, since the<br/>&gt; programs related to microabc are all multi-plataform and free<br/>&gt; software. I am not in either OSes, so don&apos;t expect more than FreeDOS<br/>&gt; binaries or GNU Makefiles from me... some day I might create a *.deb<br/>&gt; package...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that there are ABC installers for Windows out there. For<br/>&gt; instance, ABCEdit &grave;&grave;is a Windows program that integrates abcm2ps,<br/>&gt; abc2midi and GhostView in a single package.&apos;&apos;:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#ABCEdit">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/#ABCEdit</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It only misses microabc :-) (and the optional abcpp).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Personally,<br/>&gt; &gt; anytime I have tried to install something that requires<br/>&gt; &gt; putting many things in many places, and configuring some<br/>&gt; &gt; of them, I _never_ have success.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think first most people will<br/>&gt; &gt; never even try something like that and if they do they<br/>&gt; &gt; probably have an experience like mine, and so most people<br/>&gt; &gt; never try anything that is being done this way; there just<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t time and patience enough to go around.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The front-end TKmicroabc will not change too much the things in this<br/>&gt; respect, since it will depend on a Tcl-Tk interpreter installed on the<br/>&gt; system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the other hand, the choice of tcl-tk is intended exactly to make<br/>&gt; TKmicroabc plataform-independent, with no need of compiling. Another<br/>&gt; advantage is that the configuration of programs (paths, auxiliary<br/>&gt; files) may be centralised, and stored in a resource file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (There are ways to make stand-alone executables from tcl-tk scripts.<br/>&gt; See for instance <a href="http://www.equi4.com/tclkit/">http://www.equi4.com/tclkit/</a> . But that is not a task<br/>&gt; I would put in my TODO list.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But in no way do I want to be discouraging. On the contrary,<br/>&gt; &gt; I just want to see software that is packaged and works<br/>&gt; &gt; without the user having to worry about _any_ low-level tasks.<br/>&gt; &gt; That has become a practical requirement for me from software<br/>&gt; &gt; that I use, and it is what I want to accomplish in the software<br/>&gt; &gt; that I write. I try, anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I applaud your work and I&apos;m sure it will continue to become<br/>&gt; &gt; more streamlined in future releases.

I<br/>&gt; have started TKmicroabc from your suggestion of &grave;&grave;a simple front-end<br/>&gt; to generate scripts&apos;&apos;, also considering that Windows users might<br/>&gt; prefer use it rather than running the programs in that awful<br/>&gt; &grave;&grave;Command&apos;&apos; interpreter (TKmicroabc will save the paths for the<br/>&gt; programs to execute them).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Sagittal engine of microabc can save work for many users/uses (it<br/>&gt; can do equal/linear temperaments, as well as just intonation notated<br/>&gt; relative to pythagorean fifhts, with no need to write settings files).<br/>&gt; In TKmicroabc, that couple of commands above should be available<br/>&gt; ready-to-use as a project template, so that a newbie could start using<br/>&gt; it with no need to understand the commands before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, people need learn ABC to use microabc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...as simple as possible, but not simpler!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Hudson Lacerda<br/>&gt; <a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-about.html">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-about.html</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-tutorial.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/microabc-tutorial.pdf</a><br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=18278 href="#18278">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2008 10:37:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot;<br/>&lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Hudson.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This becomes more and more interesting!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I want to point out that what you say about Sibelius here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The flexibility for non-conventional notation I need<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot be achieved with Finale or Sibelius. These<br/>&gt; &gt; programs are difficult to use and require too many<br/>&gt; &gt; tweaks to do almost anything which is not 12-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; and common time. Typically, most work has to be<br/>&gt; &gt; redone for every piece. And their file formats are<br/>&gt; &gt; impossible to use along other programs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is not quite accurate. Sibelius can work with musicxml files.<br/>&gt; Finale used to export enigma files, I don&apos;t know if it<br/>&gt; now outputs musicxml.</p><p>I know of that, but have you tried to read or to write a musicxml<br/>file, or to implement it in any program? Are you sure it is able to<br/>represent every feature of Finale or Sibelius? That representation is<br/>documented so that users can explore it?</p><p>musicxml seems like designed to be a fake standard. Is is not suitable<br/>for real usage. ENIGMA (a binary format) also seems too complex for<br/>users who want just, for example, to import/modify/export a music file<br/>with a automated-composition environment.</p><p>We need a transparent, high-level, easy-to-use, yet powerful form of<br/>notation.</p><p>&gt; Changing the time signature<br/>&gt; is certainly not a problem in these programs.<br/>&gt; As for<br/>&gt; tuning, AFAIK you are correct.</p><p>Til some time ago it was difficult to get independent time signatures<br/>for each voice with programs like Finale, Sibelius or Encore. I don&apos;t<br/>know about the actual stage of development.</p><p>ABC also has its limitations in this issue (abcm2ps cannot align<br/>voices with different tempi), but Lilypond is really flexible:<br/><a href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.10/input/proportional">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.10/input/proportional</a></p><p>Sibelius has a script language which may be useful, though. Finale<br/>supports plugins, but it seems that only in binary form. However,<br/>those programs are not free software, they belong to that evil group<br/>of software packages that are subject to _artificial scarcity_ and<br/>enclose users into proprietary cages. Their secret and incompatible<br/>native file formats are part of the cages. They are not made for the<br/>users, but for their owners. They are not in the &grave;&grave;right direction&apos;&apos;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could bet that to do anything complicated in<br/>&gt; something like abc will be more trouble than doing it in<br/>&gt; a WYSIWYG program like Sibelius, but as I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; actually use either of these programs, this is<br/>&gt; mere conjecture coming from me.</p><p>All my experiences with Sibelius and Encore were completely<br/>frustrating. I haven&apos;t used Finale for any real work, though.</p><p>Complex things may be labourious to do with abcm2ps, but so far I am<br/>happy with the results. The tasks can be automated, and it is<br/>practical to reuse customised extensions in other files. Also it is<br/>easy to mix text and music in a single file, or to include music<br/>excerpts in LaTeX documents, as I did in microabc-tutorial.pdf.</p><p>Here are some examples made with abcm2ps:<br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tab.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/tab.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/19et.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/19et.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/flauta.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/flauta.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/flutepie.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/flutepie.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/24et.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/24et.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/alterego1.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/alterego1.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/sagittal-examples.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/sagittal-examples.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/shapednotes.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/shapednotes.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/special.pdf">http://br.geocities.com/hfmlacerda/abc/special.pdf</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks so much for the examples and additional<br/>&gt; information; your messages are all very helpful.<br/>&gt; The web script input is amazing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Part of the reason all of this interests me is that I am<br/>&gt; looking for a text scripting format for MegaScore files.<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/MSCintro.html">http://www.h-pi.com/MSCintro.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Presently files are text but are not very human<br/>&gt; readable.

George?</p><p>It&apos;s the newer, less expensive model of the Scalatron tuner, which I<br/>described here:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_67422.html#67428">/tuning/topicId_67422.html#67428</a></p><p>We called it the &quot;consolidated tuner&quot;, since it combined both the<br/>original programmable tone generator and (video-display) pitch<br/>monitor in a single box.</p><p>&gt; My comments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Motorola Scalatron was a dual rank keyboard based upon organ<br/>divide down<br/>&gt; technology, built into home organ type packaging, and invented by<br/>George<br/>&gt; Secor in the early 1970s.</p><p>I didn&apos;t invent it.  It was the idea of Herman Pedtke, an organist<br/>and faculty member of the School of Music at De Paul University,<br/>Chicago.  Herm discussed the idea with his friend, Dick Harasek, who<br/>subsequently started the Scalatron company as a &quot;New Venture&quot;<br/>subsidiary of Motorola.</p><p>The Scalatron already existed as a two-manual electronic organ (with<br/>no pedalboard) at the time that I contacted the company to explain my<br/>idea of using a generalized keyboard to better exploit the resources<br/>of alternative tunings.</p><p>I also recommended adding filtering and enveloping, by which the<br/>instrument became a microtonal polyphonic synthesizer.</p><p>I&apos;ve discussed the generalized-keyboard Scalatron at various times on<br/>the tuning lists, e.g. here:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407</a></p><p>&gt; It had a cassette interface.</p><p>Well yes, sort of.  You could connect a cassette recorder to either<br/>the input or output jacks of the two-piece version, but those were<br/>normally used for a microphone and for the video display (pitch)<br/>monitor, respectively.  I don&apos;t know whether the consolidated tuner<br/>had an output jack.</p><p>&gt; I am not aware of a<br/>&gt; video interface, but it is possible it was added later.</p><p>The pitch monitor displayed the pitches as horizontal black bars.<br/>(See the above link.)</p><p>&gt; This auction is just<br/>&gt; for the monitor, not the keyboard, which would be a real find as<br/>less than<br/>&gt; 20 Scalatrons were ever made. Some versions of the keyboard used a<br/>hexagonal<br/>&gt; array rather than the standard piano style keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Adding to this, one of the patent numbers does appear to match a<br/>pedal tone<br/>&gt; decay patent that is now reassigned to Yamaha, who went through a<br/>splurge of<br/>&gt; activity in patenting microtonal technology. So the device may be a<br/>&gt; legitimate attachment to the Scalatron.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Patent 4085643 - Truncated decay system</p><p>Although the company did offer an accessory pedalboard, AFAIK none<br/>was ever made.  That particular patent might have had something to do<br/>with that.</p><p>&gt; As the first knob on the monitor is labeled with a note symbol, I<br/>wonder if<br/>&gt; this was used to assist in retuning the microtonal scales in the<br/>Scalatron.</p><p>As I explained in the above link, the newer (consolidated) tuner<br/>(shown on eBay) is not very microtonal.  It&apos;s capable of only 12-<br/>equal, although it does give you the ability to shift the pitch<br/>upward or downward by roughly 4-cent increments within a limited<br/>range: the knob allows you to set the note &quot;A&quot; in 1-cent increments,<br/>from 438 to 445 Hz.  There&apos;s another knob to select the chromatic<br/>tone that sounds, and a third one to select the octave.  (Of course,<br/>there was also an on-off/volume control knob.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=18280 href="#18280">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

In fact a good part of the software industry actively<br/>&gt; supports rolling your own -- compilers, development<br/>&gt; environments, etc.</p><p>Sure, I agree.  But if you say, &quot;Who wants to write software?<br/>Only freaks&quot; (as you seemed to say earlier), I&apos;m going to say<br/>that&apos;s a pretty grim view of the 21st century.  When a<br/>disruptive technology like literacy or computer programming<br/>comes along, I really do think that it&apos;s so powerful that you<br/>either control it or are controlled by those who do.  And I&apos;m<br/>not looking forward to a &apos;clergy&apos; of programmers.  Or maybe<br/>more accurately, of IP owners, who employ programmers as the<br/>church did guilds.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When the fate of a huge body of<br/>&gt; &gt; information rests with one company, that&apos;s not good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there isn&apos;t any &quot;fate&quot; resting with the Finale company.<br/>&gt; The software will continue to exist and run even if the<br/>&gt; company goes out of business; and so will the data.</p><p>Not when it&apos;s no longer supported by any OS or hardware.<br/>Then it&apos;s either lost or there&apos;s a burden on content owners<br/>to shift it over (which is often illegal, thanks to the<br/>DCMA).</p><p>&gt; The  bigger problem is that when the hardware wears<br/>&gt; out and the upgrade path doesn&apos;t support the old software<br/>&gt; *then* you are  screwed. This isn&apos;t actually a problem that<br/>&gt; is *caused* by Finale having a proprietary file format, and<br/>&gt; it isn&apos;t their fault.</p><p>It&apos;s a fact of life that we need to take into account when<br/>choosing software, and when debating ideal software industry<br/>setups.</p><p>&gt; And, can you prove that they &quot;fear&quot; open file formats?<br/>&gt; After all, they do support exporting to XML and they support<br/>&gt; 3rd party plugins. Not making one&apos;s file formats publicly<br/>&gt; open, in my experience, has more to do with the resulting<br/>&gt; support and documentation burdens on the development<br/>&gt; organization than it does with inherent fear of such formats.<br/>&gt; (Having said that, however, of course companies want to have<br/>&gt; some competitive edge so that all of their work isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; immediately stolen or pirated and they go out of business<br/>&gt; in a month.)</p><p>It&apos;s useful to think about what the &apos;proprietary binaries&apos;<br/>market rewards.  Software companies have incentives to lock<br/>their data formats, yes.  And they have incentives to add<br/>features with every release.  And they have incentives to<br/>make their software hard to use.  And they have incentives<br/>to encourage piracy of their software.  Perhaps it&apos;s the<br/>last two that are the most counter-intuitive...</p><p>Hard to use:<br/>Different application niches function in different ways.<br/>But the music DAW niche is a typical kind of niche: there<br/>are several large, expensive packages with rough feature<br/>parity, which are mainly distinguished by having different<br/>groups of loyal users.  The users stick to their package.<br/>Subsequent versions of the software are released mainly<br/>to capture upgrades, and so features have to be added.<br/>Left unattended, this process will create arcane, hard to<br/>use software (interfaces must be &apos;refactored&apos; every time<br/>features are added to prevent this).  And that&apos;s dandy,<br/>because the more arcane the interface is, the harder it<br/>will be for any user to switch to the competition.  They&apos;ve<br/>already invested in learning the bizarre tricks and traps<br/>of one package, so they&apos;re not about to do it again unless<br/>forced.<br/>Something similar happens with cars.  It&apos;s isn&apos;t a steep<br/>learning curve that keeps people loyal to a brand and<br/>model, but rather fear of making a huge investment on an<br/>unknown (this has actually been studied).  But the bottom<br/>line is people are loyal, they go to get the new Civic,<br/>and to sell it to them Honda makes it bigger and fancier.<br/>So cars go &quot;upmarket&quot;.  The Civic today is bigger than the<br/>Accord was in 1990 (I&apos;m making up this example).  Hyundai<br/>is the new Honda, and Kia is the new Hyundai.</p><p>Encourage piracy:<br/>I can&apos;t think of a successful software package that did<br/>anything serious about piracy until the 3rd or 4th release.<br/>There&apos;s now ample evidence, from multiple high-level people<br/>within Microsoft, that they actively encouraged piracy of<br/>Windows and Office throughout the &apos;90s.  It&apos;s really quite<br/>a trick; they get the &apos;spread&apos; benefit of free software<br/>without giving up legal ownership.  They can come along<br/>later and try to monetize those users (and MS has in fact<br/>done this).</p><p>So the question is: Can we imagine markets that would provide<br/>incentives for better software?  Having open source is an<br/>interesting try, but it&apos;s far from a complete picture and I&apos;m<br/>not saying an approach with closed source won&apos;t wind up being<br/>the answer.  But open, standard data formats seem like a<br/>no-brainer.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, but we hope art can move beyond Bach.  If not in absolute<br/>&gt; &gt; quality, then in some cultural sense that&apos;s meaningful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, so can&apos;t we do that whether the disk format of some software<br/>&gt; package is proprietary or not? How does that really matter in<br/>&gt; the production of the resulting art? Every age lives with the<br/>&gt; limitations of available tools.  And if the individual won&apos;t or<br/>&gt; can&apos;t do that, then they can make their own tools. Software or<br/>&gt; violins or chromeloeons.</p><p>I think the benefits of data portability on the creative space<br/>are obvious.  There are limitations to technology, and then<br/>there are social limitations imposed on technology.  It&apos;s the<br/>latter I think we should examine.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=18288 href="#18288">ðŸ”—</a>kraiggrady@...</h3><span>1/7/2008 2:27:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks for clearing this up George.<br/>The thing i enjoyed about the scalatron when i would play with it atErv&apos;s is that being based on a high crystral , if you chose the rightkey you could get absolute tuning.<br/> By this completely dead on just intonation.<br/> the psychological effect is astonding although not good for everything.<br/> It has also made me realize that the closer you get the more differances on can detect between absolute and near absolute.</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: George D.

Free as in freedom!</p><p>  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>&grave;&grave;Free software&apos;&apos; is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the<br/>concept, you should think of &grave;&grave;free&apos;&apos; as in &grave;&grave;free speech&apos;&apos;, not as in<br/>&grave;&grave;free beer&apos;&apos;.<br/>Free software is a matter of the users&apos; freedom to run, copy,<br/>distribute, study, change and improve the software.<br/>  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what is &quot;artificial scarcity&quot;? We&apos;re talking about software, not<br/>&gt; diamonds! Just buy a copy.</p><p>There are no significant reproduction costs in simply copying streams<br/>of bits. If you want to know what is artificial scarcity, just search<br/>in the web. You will find information there.</p><p>BTW, artificial scarcity also occurs in the material world, as one can<br/> see in statistics on, for instance, homeless families X unused<br/>properties, or hungry people X produced food.</p><p>There are severe &grave;&grave;bugs&apos;&apos; in the economical market system, which cause<br/>and increase such social problems. The example of the programmer who<br/>needs to write proprietary software to live may be compared to that of<br/>a worker who destroys native trees to live. I can understand that such<br/>problems are too complex to get a rapid solution, but this is not the<br/>same to say that these are not problems. Those individual workers may<br/>have no alternative for a while, but there are other people that _can_<br/>do choices to make the world better.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s as easily available as anything else that<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t quite &quot;free&quot;, and since it&apos;s software it can be replicated<br/>basically<br/>&gt; infinitely. What you pay for is the development cost.</p><p>Don&apos;t agree with the argument. Restricting further copies, obfuscating<br/>the sources/binaries/files, installing spywares, etc. -- all those<br/>very common practices in the proprietary software world --, are not,<br/>in my opinion, justified by the &grave;&grave;development cost&apos;&apos;. The opposite:<br/>several of those practices make the development costs higher.</p><p>Development costs can be shared without affecting other people<br/>negatively. There are several ways to fund software.</p><p>And, after all, I should point out again that free software is not<br/>gratis. Any software has a development cost :-0 , and it is not<br/>uncommon today that people pay for copies of free software.</p><p>I can say for myself: I have bought _several_ copies of free software<br/>packages in _several_ circumstances. I have paid for free software.<br/>Haven&apos;t you?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for proprietary formats, well... Who cares what it looks like on<br/>disk?<br/>&gt; Some miniscule percentage of dilettantes? Nobody can make a viable<br/>business<br/>&gt; out of producing software for a vanishingly small audience who wants<br/>to<br/>&gt; diddle the disk format. (And, in case you&apos;ve never worked in a<br/>production<br/>&gt; software shop: once you make a format public, you have to document and<br/>&gt; support it, and that can eat up development &amp; documentation budgets<br/>that<br/>&gt; might be better spent working on features and bug fixes.)</p><p>I am a profesional musician. I do programming just for fun and for<br/>personal needs, as I said in a previous message.</p><p>There are many programs which native formats are plain text (sometimes<br/>compressed as zip or equivalent). This may be taken as a sort of<br/>self-documented format, which is easy for programmers to figure out<br/>how to use, even when there is no formal documentation. There are also<br/>binary formats which are not too difficult to analyse (that is not the<br/>case of obfuscated binaries).</p><p>BTW, I read recently that Microsoft announced the end of support for<br/>&grave;&grave;old&apos;&apos; files by Microsoft Office. This will affect a large number of<br/>those people that didn&apos;t care how their files look in the disk :-0.<br/>Meanwhile, I just continue using my files in open formats, with no<br/>problems... 8-)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finale and other packages can export to PDF and print onto paper.</p><p>LOL... :^D</p><p>Here is a related link:<br/><a href="http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byorg/abbey/an/an21/an21-8/an21-807.html">http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byorg/abbey/an/an21/an21-8/an21-807.html</a></p><p>&gt; What<br/>&gt; more open and compatible format does the musician want? Wasn&apos;t paper<br/>good<br/>&gt; enough for Bach?</p><p>From the perspective of a proprietary-software owner, the user should<br/>never wish any feature that is not already implemented: anything the<br/>user needs is ready-to-use... until the next update, when the &grave;&grave;user<br/>needs&apos;&apos; change suddenly to match the new features!</p><p>&gt; And if it doesn&apos;t do what you want, then just get<br/>&gt; something else.</p><p>That is what I do.</p><p>(I believe I have also the right to make public the reasons for that,<br/>mainly when I am asked about, as it was the case. You have also the<br/>right to disagree with me.)</p><p>&gt; And if you can&apos;t find the right software for money or free,<br/>&gt; I guess you could write it yourself and give it away instead of<br/>&gt; complaining about how much software costs.</p><p>Yes! That is exactly what I do! ;-D</p><p>But, again: &grave;&grave;free as in freedom&apos;&apos;!</p><p>And I am not complainting about any software prices.

So why would they knowingly make a &quot;fake&quot;<br/>&gt; standard? Do you really think that standards people set out to make<br/>&gt; something that isn&apos;t useful, at least for some restricted purposes?</p><p>My criticisms were addressed to the lack of transparency and<br/>flexibility to inter-operate with the _native_ secret formats of<br/>certain software.</p><p>Then, I pointed out that -- in my opinion, of course -- those<br/>supported open formats cannot solve, in a satisfactory way, that<br/>inter-operability problem for the end user (in special the composer).</p><p>&gt; Just<br/>&gt; because it isn&apos;t as flexible as paper &amp; pencil doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t<br/>work<br/>&gt; for some musicians for some purposes.</p><p>Indeed. Aaron and I were concerning to certain special purposes, and<br/>how those purposes could (or not) be arrived by using certain programs.</p><p>&gt; When was the last time you personally<br/>&gt; tried to solve all music notation problems in one big software system?</p><p>Why should I do it? Why should anyone do it?</p><p>I am extending the possibilities of use of _existing_ free software,<br/>which uses _open_ formats, rather than building a new big software<br/>system from scratch.</p><p>Complex tasks should be split in manageable parts; these parts may be<br/>worked out by different people, and their programs, using<br/>inter-operable formats, may be combined in a harmonic way to<br/>accomplish that complex task.</p><p>Several free/open-source projects work this way. Recall: we had<br/>Xwindow, we had LaTeX, we had Emacs, then GNU Bash, GCC, GhostScript,<br/>then Linux, ALSA, Jack... at the end, we have a complete software<br/>system for both general and specific use. Why should anyone write a<br/>complete OS and software collection from scratch? There are people<br/>that do it, but it is not necessary for most of us. Ask Richard<br/>Stallman why the &grave;&grave;GNU Hurd&apos;&apos; kernel is not a high priority for Free<br/>Software Foundation and he will reply: why we already have a free<br/>kernel we can use.</p><p>Therefore, I would not spent time writting a complete new notation<br/>software when I can explore to its limits a very good existing program<br/>-- abcm2ps. I am doing just what I need (and can) do.</p><p>&gt; Why not joint the Music XML development community and work on making<br/>it better?</p><p>That might be a possibility if at least I had the required expertise<br/>for that.</p><p>Anyway, as far as I can do within my limitations, I do test software<br/>programs, I do send bug reports, I do send suggestions to developers,<br/>I follow and share information in some userlists.</p><p>The time and effort I devote to such activities also counts, of<br/>course, as development/maintainment/distribution/(...) cost of the<br/>respective (free) software. And the output is available for everyone<br/>who wish use it (and perhaps help to improve it too).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, enough of that.

Actually<br/>many cultures do not have a written language, or if they do,<br/>it&apos;s sort of a separate thing from the spoken language (Chinese<br/>for example).  Even in the West our writing system is only<br/>a rough approximation of how we speak.  The problems with<br/>tone-of-voice in e-mail are case and point.  Similarly,<br/>programming is only a rough approximation of how we think.  But<br/>if I suddenly invented a black box that could do whatever you<br/>could think of, that&apos;d be pretty amazing.  And if half of the<br/>Earth&apos;s six billion people carried the boxes in their pockets,<br/>that&apos;d be even more amazing.

And we do have the power to create<br/>markets that do what we want, if we can figure out how.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s not the fault of company X that they make something that<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t portable to the next generation of operating system (or<br/>&gt; hardware, or whatever)... That is a side-effect of the general<br/>&gt; problem that our tools keep changing incompatibly. As they get<br/>&gt; &quot;better&quot; some things get left behind.</p><p>It&apos;s not their fault, but it&apos;s their fault for not doing<br/>everything they can to help people help themselves.  It&apos;s no<br/>different with books.  What percentage of books published in<br/>1910 have any value at all to a modern reader?  1810?  1010?<br/>Ideas move fast, and they&apos;re moving faster than ever.  This<br/>is a good thing.  The ideas even provide technologies that<br/>let us keep up.  Software can be copied and updated and kept<br/>current.  New interfaces can talk to old APIs.

This is surprising<br/>&gt; for lilypond when their creators make such bold claims<br/>&gt; about typesetting propriety in their &quot;essay&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, if it can be done and you are interested, please<br/>&gt; let&apos;s discuss off-list about megascore implementation in<br/>&gt; microabc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Aaron Hunt<br/>&gt; H-Pi Instruments<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Graham,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; [...]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 9 note magic notation, which will generalize to any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament with 225:224 as a unison vector and these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; nominals (use fixed-width font for maximum satisfaction):<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; * 5/3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *-----------------14/9---------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; * 35/24<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; * 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *------------------5/4---------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; * 7/6<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; * 16/15<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *------------------1/1---------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; * 14/15<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Relative to that you can use whatever sagittal accidentals<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you need.

I&apos;m wondering about raising note 9 of the tripod notation from 5/3 to, er, 12/7.

They sent<br/>out a survey to numerous university music departments to determine<br/>what level of interest there might be in such an instrument, and the<br/>response was nothing short of phenomenal: the response rate was<br/>around 90% and the reaction was overwhelmingly positive.  (He<br/>explained that in a typical market survey you&apos;re doing well if you<br/>get even 10% returned.)  Around 1973 the Scalatron company was set up<br/>as a &quot;New Ventures&quot; subsidiary of the Motorola corporation, with Dick<br/>Harasek as president.</p><p>I first visited the Scalatron facility in the fall of 1974, when I<br/>explained my idea of using a special &quot;generalized&quot; keyboard on their<br/>instrument in place of the two conventional keyboards.  The<br/>generalized keyboard had been invented by Robert H. M. Bosanquet in<br/>London around 1875, but I had independently arrived at the same<br/>arrangement of keys (but with a different key shape) and was not yet<br/>aware that the two were essentially the same.  A short time later Erv<br/>Wilson of Los Angeles learned of our plans and informed us that the<br/>idea was originally Bosanquet&apos;s, and he also presented his idea for<br/>an even better (hexagonal) key shape.  An elliptical key shape was<br/>eventually adopted, because hexagons posed the aesthetic requirement<br/>that the sides of the keys be exactly parallel.  Three generalized<br/>keyboard Scalatrons were made, each unique and having one or more<br/>features not possessed by the other two.  As you may conclude from<br/>the second link above, the keyboard completely lived up to my<br/>expectations.</p><p>However, Scalatron sales came nowhere near expectations, because<br/>those individuals who answered the market survey were generally not<br/>the same ones who controlled the purse strings of the music<br/>department.  After several years and less than two dozen Scalatrons<br/>sold, the parent company pulled the plug on the operation.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=18322 href="#18322">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2008 8:45:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hfmlacerda wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Graham,<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; hfmlacerda wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not easy to explain, as it has to do with current microabc<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; features.

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I worked on a 96ET(EDO) staff for the &apos;conic bellophone&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not using accidentals, so the chromatic passages look<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;
