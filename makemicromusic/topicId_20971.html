The work premieres Thursday at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University and will be performed by Newband, the Artist-Ensemble-in-Residence at the Harry Partch Institute.</p><p>With music by Dean Drummond, director of MSU&apos;s Partch Instrumentarium, and a libretto by Charles Bernstein, &quot;Cafe Buffe&quot; will feature a wide variety of unconventional instruments, including inventions by Partch and Drummond. Paul Hostetter conducts, and singers include baritone Daniel Keeling, mezzo-soprano Blythe Gaissert, bass Robert Osborne, soprano Beth Griffith, soprano Charlotte Tucci and baritone Jeremy Brauner.&quot;<br/>......<br/>&quot;Among the instruments being used are Drummond&apos;s Zoomoozophone, which he describes as a huge metallic percussion instrument played by four people, and his Juststrokerods, metallic rods coated with rosin and played by hand to produce a long-lasting, ethereal sound. Both instruments have 31 notes per octave, instead of the typical 12.&quot;</p><p>More here: <a href="http://peakperfs.org/performances/newband_2009">http://peakperfs.org/performances/newband_2009</a></p><p>World Premiere<br/>Newband<br/>Thursday September 10, 2009 Â• 7:30PM</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
