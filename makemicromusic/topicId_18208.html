One of the inventors of<br/>the synthesizer, Bob Moog, was a &apos;nerd&apos;, the computer you like to use,<br/>was invented by Steve Jobs, a &apos;nerd&apos;, and you are a &apos;nerd&apos;, too, with<br/>your talk of the importance of an esoteric topic for most, tuning. You<br/>also forget that some of these non-corporate, open source tools hold<br/>the keys to innovation (Ogg-Vorbis, for example, which in spite of<br/>less popularity is much more technically accomplished that mp3 for<br/>audio). Ardour, on Linux, is a totally amazing piece of software,<br/>comparable to any multitrack professional environment, impressive<br/>considering it&apos;s development model. If you don&apos;t like the way they<br/>sound or the interface, etc, just don&apos;t use them.</p><p>Sometimes, a steep learning curve (CSound, MAX) is rewarded by power<br/>and flexibility. Learning anything worth doing, and doing well, takes<br/>time and effort (like playing an instrument with mastery). That said,<br/>I can understand you points about certain software for beginners, but<br/>I think it&apos;s important to give a broad picture of *all* the ooptions,<br/>to let the beginner chosse their path, and not be so smug and<br/>dismissive about the so-called &quot;difficult&quot; options.</p><p>I wonder, why do feel so co-dependant on what tools people use...can&apos;t<br/>you just leave people alone to work in the environment they are<br/>confortable producing music with? Like it has been said, some tools<br/>that you despise make certain paradigms of music-making possible that<br/>would be otherwise impossible or extremely inefficient in other ways.</p><p>We get it, you love Apple&reg; and Logic&reg;...unfortunately, in your<br/>forcefulness, you might to some sound like a pastor at a megachurch<br/>trying to &apos;save&apos; people. It would be nice if you would cease this<br/>stance, and consider fully that there *might* be some value to the<br/>approaches you personally don&apos;t take.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;makemicro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you Chris, for demonstrating my point so well about &quot;academic<br/>&gt; nerds&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am using the same MacBookPro model that the &quot;rookie&quot; was asking<br/>&gt; about, and to play your ogg files I had to download a third party<br/>&gt; application, as it failed to load on any of my usual audio players or<br/>&gt; analysis tools.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The rookie is starting out, not looking for esoteric ways to modify<br/>&gt; audio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If s/he should wish to make modifications to input data or playing<br/>&gt; instruments and samples, there are many plug-ins, and adjustments that<br/>&gt; can be made from within Logic, including ReWire and bridges, which can<br/>&gt; be routing back into the Logic..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Maybe even one for MAX)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using Logic (with or without GarageBand) newbies can immediately<br/>&gt; produce some music intuitively instead of having to download and<br/>&gt; install the Unix converters that I had to use the last time I looked<br/>&gt; at MAX/MSP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tuning resolution within Logic may not be as accurate as some of<br/>&gt; us would like, yet it does work and the new Logic 8 GUI is much easier<br/>&gt; to learn and use than earlier versions<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=18215 href="#18215">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Bryan &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2007 11:30:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 15/12/2007, Charles Lucy &lt;makemicro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you Chris, for demonstrating my point so well about &quot;academic<br/>&gt;  nerds&quot;.</p><p>Any time :)  And thanks for demonstrating my point that you have no<br/>idea what pd/max is actually used for.</p><p>&gt;  I am using the same MacBookPro model that the &quot;rookie&quot; was asking<br/>&gt;  about, and to play your ogg files I had to download a third party<br/>&gt;  application, as it failed to load on any of my usual audio players or<br/>&gt;  analysis tools.</p><p>My bad, I actually meant to like to the mps:</p><p><a href="http://cmbryan.com/Dialogue.mp3">cmbryan.com/Dialogue.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://cmbryan.com/ensemble_sample.mp3">cmbryan.com/ensemble_sample.mp3</a></p><p>And holy crap let&apos;s not start another codec war!!!!</p><p>&gt;  The rookie is starting out, not looking for esoteric ways to modify<br/>&gt;  audio.</p><p>Saying that max/pd is an &quot;esoteric audio modifier&quot; is like saying<br/>Logic is a midi sequencer.

How about, could you use Logic to make a computer<br/>improvise on a hebdomekontany?

I started using max in 2002, and there was no<br/>trace of unix by then.  I didn&apos;t even need a terminal to run PD in<br/>2002.</p><p>Logic is more intuitive than max in the same way that a molded plastic<br/>fire truck is more intuitive than a set of legos.  One hardly replaces<br/>the other.</p><p>By all means, use Logic for midi sequencing and multitracks and fx<br/>plugins!
