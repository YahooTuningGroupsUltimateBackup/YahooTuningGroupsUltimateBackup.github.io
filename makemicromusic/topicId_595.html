I&apos;m really excited about your orchestration ideas<br/>and projects both for the Colonna example of fifthtones -- your aria<br/>-- and my piece.</p><p>This kind of experimentation and creativity might not only produce<br/>some beautiful music, but get people interested in an era of<br/>experimental European music maybe not so well known. When it comes to<br/>bringing together the old and new, your technique and art should lend<br/>a very special viewpoint.</p><p>Of course, this process is enriched all the more by your awareness,<br/>and that of this group generally, that there are a wealth of world<br/>musics and intonational systems.</p><p>There&apos;s a fascinating passage in an advertisement Vicentino published<br/>in 1561 for his _arciorgano_ that having the enharmonic or fifthtone<br/>steps available would make it possible to follow the inflections<br/>called for in setting to music the words of various languages --<br/>Hebrew or Turkish, for example. Whether he was referring to melodic<br/>inflections practiced by singers of those traditions, or to the ideal<br/>steps for following the patterns of these languages, his statement is<br/>a reminder, at least for me, to think and hear globally as much as<br/>possible even while composing from a unique &quot;local&quot; viewpoint.</p><p>Jon, thank you for such a careful statement on the question of the<br/>relation of composer to performance, not only moving in its empathy<br/>for my viewpoint but also providing an example for me to follow in<br/>qualifying some of my own remarks.</p><p>My comments about the very flexible nature of much medieval and<br/>Renaissance music -- and also neo-Gothic or Xeno-Renaissance music --<br/>shouldn&apos;t distract from the other side of the question. Some effects<br/>on which I rely can be quite timbre-specific, and indeed the choice of<br/>timbre may be the basis for the whole consonance/dissonance structure<br/>of a piece.</p><p>This is an area where General MIDI files have frustrating limitations,<br/>and for that very reason one not represented well by a sampling of the<br/>MIDI files I post.</p><p>For example, in an article in the latest issue of _The Microtonal<br/>Activist_ (TMA), so ably edited by Jacky Ligon, I discuss a system of<br/>&quot;meantone well-timbrement&quot; inspired by Bill Sethares and others who<br/>have explored new kinds of consonance through matching timbre with<br/>tuning.</p><p>The timbre/tuning connection is more generally a major theme of the<br/>issue, with excellent articles by Jacky and by Jeff Scott on tunings<br/>with stretched or compressed octaves or other intervals.</p><p>For a beautiful example of timbre/tuning artistry with voices,<br/>acoustical instruments, and synthesizer sound, of course, Jacky, your<br/>CD _Galunlati_ would be hard to outdo -- although you and the other<br/>musicians just might manage.</p><p>Anyway, the point here is that with this kind of music, the timbre is<br/>often as basic to the statement as the choice of notes and intervals.</p><p>Curiously, at the other side of the spectrum, I find that often<br/>with Gothic or Renaissance styles and the like, there&apos;s not<br/>necessarily any distinction between writing for acoustical or<br/>electronic performance. The same piece might be performed by four<br/>singers, or by a small instrumental consort, or live on synthesizer,<br/>or through some kind of MIDI realization.</p><p>Of course, if that piece happens to include some enharmonic or<br/>fifthtone inflections, then a performance by singers and/or acoustical<br/>instruments might confront me with the same problems Vicentino faced<br/>in the 16th century: how to help the performers find and get used to<br/>those unfamiliar intervals.</p><p>One fascinating part of this TMA is the transcription of a lecture by<br/>Joe Pehrson in Russia on microtonality, ranging from 48-tET to 19-note<br/>JI systems to a hexany composition.</p><p>Joe, your prediction that singers and instrumentalists may become<br/>fluent with these new intervals and sonorities reminds me of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s similar prediction in 1555: maybe the technologies, the<br/>means of global communication, and the kind of community celebrated in<br/>this forum can make it happen.</p><p>Also, an appreciation of various world musics where small intervals<br/>and inflections are routine may lend a perspective precious both for<br/>its own sake and for the sake of liberating all world musics. May this<br/>forum serve as one small model of sharing and community through<br/>diversity,</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=601 href="#601">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/13/2001 9:04:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_595.html#595">/makemicromusic/topicId_595.html#595</a></p><p>&gt; Joe, your prediction that singers and instrumentalists may become<br/>&gt; fluent with these new intervals and sonorities reminds me of<br/>&gt; Vicentino&apos;s similar prediction in 1555: maybe the technologies, the<br/>&gt; means of global communication, and the kind of community celebrated<br/>in this forum can make it happen.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hello Margo!</p><p>I&apos;m hoping that the fact that the &quot;prediction&quot; was in 1555 doesn&apos;t<br/>mean we&apos;re in for a long wait!</p><p>Just kidding... it&apos;s great to see the relationship between visionary<br/>thinkers of both the past and the present!</p><p>________ _______ _________ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
