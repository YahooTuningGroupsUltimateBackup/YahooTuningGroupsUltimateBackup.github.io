The only one of its kind in Canada, it looks like an ordinary piano but sounds extraordinarily different. The instrument is pitched in sixteenth-tone intervals from key to key, instead of the semitones of conventional pianos. It has 97 keys instead of the usual 88, yet the instrument spans only one octave from top to bottom. Within this range, delicate waves of sonorities are created as the performer moves between the intervals.</p><p>Bruce Mather is the featured artist as Sudbury&apos;s 5-Penny New Music Concert series launches its 2009-10 season. The concert is on Friday, October 16, 2009, at 8 p.m. at St. Peter&apos;s United Church in Sudbury. Admission is $15 and $10 for students. Tickets will be available at the door or at Black Cat, 96 Durham Street, Sudbury.&quot;</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
