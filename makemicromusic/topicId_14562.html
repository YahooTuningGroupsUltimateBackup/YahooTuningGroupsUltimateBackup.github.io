Eg,<br/>a 17-note scale in any tuning might supply a series, which could be<br/>used as the raw materials of a 17-note tone sequence, against a 17-<br/>beat duration sequence, the two together creating a melody in a<br/>particular rhythm.</p><p>b)  The composer&apos;s choices may deliberately expose or obscure the<br/>connections between the numbers.</p><p>c)  Generally, simpler uses of the raw material will expose, and<br/>more complex manipulations will obscure, these connections.</p><p>d)  Only the simplest uses of numerical materials are at all likely<br/>to give rise to connections which hearers may apprehend directly.<br/>This is because we do not have an innate sense of exact number,<br/>although we can probably distinguish &quot;few&quot; from &quot;many&quot; without any<br/>specific training.</p><p>e)  For similar reasons, only those with a developed (ie trained)<br/>sense of exact number are likely to perceive connections arising<br/>from the more complex uses of numerical materials.</p><p>f)  In practical terms, some hearers will probably resolve (become<br/>consciously aware of) 2 in tone against 2 in metre, and 3 in tone<br/>against 3 in metre.  Some fewer hearers will resolve 5 against 5;<br/>very few will ever resolve larger groupings.  As evidence, I adduce<br/>the fact that very few pianists ever manage to make the playing of 7-<br/>note diatonic scales in equal notes appear *musical* as distinct<br/>from mechanical.</p><p>g) The simplest way to expose such connections is to play ascending<br/>or descending scales exemplifying your chosen numbers, in notes of<br/>equal duration.  This way has correspondingly the greatest chance of<br/>having the resulting metre being perceived as equalling in number<br/>the full set of tones chosen.  Eg, in 5/8 metre, playing figures<br/>consisting of all 5 steps of a pentatonic scale in ascending<br/>sequence, in equal notes and repeated several times without pause,<br/>may establish both the metre and scale unequivocally.</p><p>h)  Very small departures from an established pattern are enough to<br/>disrupt its coherence in the hearer&apos;s mind.  This seriously limits<br/>what the composer can do to continually expose a numerical<br/>connection for the length of even a typical short piece of two to<br/>three minutes.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried doing this kind of thing before, with very limited<br/>success; however your question, and the opportunity for reflection<br/>it gave me, spur me to consider a fresh attack on &quot;number made<br/>manifest&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=14589 href="#14589">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2006 5:09:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks a lot for your comments!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yahya_melb&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good stuff!

As for listeners (and performers), that&apos;s<br/>a quite different matter...</p><p>&gt; c)  Generally, simpler uses of the raw material will expose, and<br/>&gt; more complex manipulations will obscure, these connections.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; d)  Only the simplest uses of numerical materials are at all likely<br/>&gt; to give rise to connections which hearers may apprehend directly.<br/>&gt; This is because we do not have an innate sense of exact number,<br/>&gt; although we can probably distinguish &quot;few&quot; from &quot;many&quot; without any<br/>&gt; specific training.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; e)  For similar reasons, only those with a developed (ie trained)<br/>&gt; sense of exact number are likely to perceive connections arising<br/>&gt; from the more complex uses of numerical materials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; f)  In practical terms, some hearers will probably resolve (become<br/>&gt; consciously aware of) 2 in tone against 2 in metre, and 3 in tone<br/>&gt; against 3 in metre.  Some fewer hearers will resolve 5 against 5;<br/>&gt; very few will ever resolve larger groupings.</p><p>Training is a good keyword. An analog question arises already when we<br/>just consider classical motif manipulations, such as inversions or<br/>retrogrades - especially (but not only) the latter is not very likely<br/>to be recognized directly/consciously by &quot;untrained&quot; listeners.</p><p>One of the key question behind all this is: How much of music<br/>perception is &quot;training&quot; (and hence dependent on culture), and how<br/>much is &quot;universal&quot;? Maybe initiatives like the seventeen tone piano<br/>project can contribute something here - the greater the number of<br/>persons exposed to involved in microtonal music, the better the<br/>question can be investigated!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3><a id=14627 href="#14627">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2006 4:20:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, I saw there are still some minor errors in the score (this is<br/>&gt; what happens invariably as soon as something is rolled out...)<br/>&gt; Eventually there will be an improved version later.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So, I have corrected a few things - especially: errors in measure 14<br/>ff. and 45 ff., and also inserted some more articulation marks.</p><p><a href="http://homepage.hispeed.ch/hsstraub/musik/sharks_2006-09-02.pdf">http://homepage.hispeed.ch/hsstraub/musik/sharks_2006-09-02.pdf</a><br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
