I&apos;ve been rather heads-down lately, and am just starting to emerge, now that I have some vacation time coming up, so I will try to do better.</p><p>Anyway, I have just posted a new piece called TimeWave Canon, which I describe as &quot;a mensuration canon in just intonation based on Terence McKenna&apos;s TimeWave Zero&quot;.

I find that process can be a good starting point, but then I spend a lot of time making sure that I&apos;m satisfied with the result.  In this piece, the notes *sequences* were all completely predetermined, but I chose the scale, and where in the scale to start the sequence.  I made several adjustments along the way on both choices before I settled.  And of course I tried different instrumental timbres, and played with balances and so on.</p><p>It&apos;s neat that you hear it as moody and dark, I actually hear it as rather light.  :-)</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Rozencrantz the Sane wrote:<br/>&gt; This kind of formalism is something that I find very exciting.

Could be, though not deliberate; I&apos;ve like Riley&apos;s stuff a lot, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he&apos;s used scales/modes like this one.  It&apos;s also a little bit like hicaz maqam, which has always been one of my favorites.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:<br/>&gt; Very nice. It reminds me of Terry Riley.
