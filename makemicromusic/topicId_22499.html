I&apos;m not sure how much exactly he<br/>transcribed, probably not too much, I don&apos;t think he was interested<br/>in microtonality. His works are in standard 12 ET.</p><p>Also Leo&scaron; Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek notated some bird songs but just as a part of his<br/>notating of all sounds and speech intonation mainly. Again - no<br/>interest in microtonality, he composed in 12 ET.</p><p>Then Hungarian musicologist P&eacute;ter Sz&odblac;ke did bird songs recording,<br/>analyzing (with the help of slow down the record} and<br/>transcriptions. You can find some info about his work easily.</p><p>Daniel Forr&oacute;</p><p>On 23 May 2010, at 12:35 PM, Michael wrote:</p><p>&gt; Not exactly, it says<br/>&gt; &quot;Surprising are also songs of many tropical birds, some of them are<br/>&gt; singing in major or minor scales up (a) or down (b) &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, but it doesn&apos;t say, for example, how close the Myiophoneus<br/>&gt; caeruleus&apos;s notes are to the F G# B C# D# E indicated as one of<br/>&gt; it&apos;s &quot;songs&quot;.
