When I started out in 1989, someone gave me a 19 tone guitar, so the choice was easy...that&apos;s where I started, and it went from there. I started meeting a lot of the tuning folks, and found out how vast the field could be. Some basic advice I got was very helpful...first, there are tunings with &quot;good&quot; 3rds/5ths, and those without...if a person likes chordal music, than perhaps tunings with better 3rds/5ths would be a good idea, and there are a number of those. There are some folks who don&apos;t like tempered tunings, so they may choose to stay with Pure intervals (just intonation)...it&apos;s harder to do complex chords and modulations with those sorts of tunings, but maybe that&apos;s ok. And Ivor Darreg was fond of pointing out that different tunings have different moods of their own that need to be taken into consideration as well. I think that&apos;s true, but maybe a tuning can have a number of different moods, depending on the composer using it.</p><p>   And indeed, the kind of music one wants to create has a big effect on the tunings they work with. Modal based music doesn&apos;t rely on chords, so you don&apos;t have to be as concerned with the harmonic aspects of the music. And, the number of notes makes a difference, too...I have guitars with 31, 34, and 36 notes/octave, that&apos;s a lot, and on a guitar it gets mighty teensy; you might wanna think about that as well. Try and listen to a lot of micro music too, see what sounds good to you...can&apos;t hurt. Best of luck, check <a href="http://www.myspace.com/microstick">www.myspace.com/microstick</a> to hear samples of my 19, 34 tone, and fretless work...best...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
