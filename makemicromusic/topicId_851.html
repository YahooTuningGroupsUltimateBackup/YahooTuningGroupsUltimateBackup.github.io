I understand that other programs exist as<br/>&gt; well and to be honest, I&apos;m overwhelmed with all the choices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am a member of the Just Intonation Network and enjoy studying the<br/>&gt; science of &quot;Tuning&quot;. I am running two computers one with Windows 2000<br/>&gt; and the other with Windows 95. I can get a system utilizing Windows<br/>&gt; 98 if need be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that C-Sound is not an easy program to learn. However I<br/>&gt; heard that this program is one of the most powerful out there. Before<br/>&gt; I spend the time and energy learning a specific program, I would just<br/>&gt; like to make sure that the choice I make is right way to go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks and Peace to All<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wally</p><p>The best software for cooking up tunings and sending them to your synth<br/>is definitely (and without a doubt) Jeff Scott&apos;s L&apos;il Miss Scale Oven<br/>(LMSO). I can give you his email address if you email me privately. It<br/>won&apos;t help you write or compose and in fact I don&apos;t think any software<br/>can help with that. If you want to be more specific as to your needs<br/>I&apos;ll try to be more helpful. My recommendation is to get a hold of a<br/>Yamaha DX7 series synth or a TX 802 module (both fairly cheap) or an<br/>Ensoniq ASR 10 sampler (I&apos;m sure others will recommend their favourites)<br/>and Jeff&apos;s LMSO. This will allow you to make microtonal music by the<br/>bucketload. You could then invest in Cubase for  sequencing your<br/>compositions.</p><p>If you&apos;re a guitarist try having a guitar refretted to 19 or 22 or 31<br/>instead of 12 tet. I had a classical refretted to 22.</p><p>But if you really want microtonality, build your own instruments, write<br/>for them and perform - you&apos;ll never look back.</p><p>Best Wishes</p><p>&gt;</p></div>
