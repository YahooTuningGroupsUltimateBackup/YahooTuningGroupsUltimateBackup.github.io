There a probably thousands of studios that are based around this platform, and anyone in the recording industry has Pro Tools chops.

It is one of many, many types of ways to record things. Sonar is another. One editor looks like most any other editor and must have the same features. A multitrack recorder must have the same features, perhaps the same amount of tracks or more.</p><p>Everyone and his dog is advertising Pro Tools training these days. You can get similar systems from Mackie, TASCAM, and many others that are every bit as good. Select your bit width and sampling frequencies to suit your taste and budget and end usage and start using it!</p><p>I&apos;ve been using digital recording and editing since  1992 using a Spectral Synthesis system (16 track 48kHz), these folks got bought out by Euphonix and developed their stand alone 48 track digital recording system called the R-1 used in many of the finest recording studios in the world. Note that few of the finest studios use Pro Tools, but may have a &quot;Pro Tools Suite&quot; somewhere in the building because many people are familar with that system.</p><p>I might add that optional control surfaces and extra monitors are often more valuable than having a Pro Tools system itself. Many manufacturers make control surfaces for Sonar, Cubase, etc. and having more real estate for the desktop on monitors has been a great help in getting excellent productivity. I now customarily use at least two monitors on most of my computers, or more, especially when needing to see the timeline, the mixing, effects I&apos;m fiddling with, etc. One monitor gets very crowded in the midst of a big production.</p><p>Bonnie *:&gt;</p><p>Joel Hickman &lt;joelhickman_1999@...&gt; wrote:<br/>Pro Tools is the best recording<br/>engineering program out there!!<br/>They give you a sample of it from<br/>their website to try out.<br/>I have Pro Tools and so do my<br/>friends!

One feature where most other platforms give you free plug ins, they<br/>charge up to a 100 bucks a pop. also there set up doesn&apos;t interfacew with most other stuff. it is above my head, but<br/>i know more people who do not use it , than do.

DAW (digital audio workstations) are all over the place, and Bonnie is right: many can offer a path to your final product, and you simply need choose the one you feel comfortable working with *and* contains all that you need. If you already have Sonar, then from what I know of your work you won&apos;t need to look any further. If in the future, however, you end up collaborating with a composer or engineer that has a Pro Tools setup, it is valuable to have the free demo just so that you can get familiar with the interface and not waste time figuring it out instead of collaborating.</p><p>There are hundreds of word processors. What matters are the words that come out the other end...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2003 6:21:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
