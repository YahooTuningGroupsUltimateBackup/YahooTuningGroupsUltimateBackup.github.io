It&apos;s in a mostly diatonic sounding JI, and the link is:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTVV2NDQiYI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTVV2NDQiYI</a></p><p>Here is the blurb describing the song:</p><p>The Popol Vuh tells the story of a pair of brothers who journey to a neighboring realm ruled by evil Gods. The Gods challenge them to a game... how they outwit the evil lords to return victorious is an epic story in the spirit of the Odyssey. But the Popol Vuh is much more than an adventure story. It is a creation myth, a chronicle of astronomical observations, a story of human nature, of peoples place in the universe, of the relationships between the animate and the inanimate. The characters of the Popol Vuh are adept at reading the signs of the world around them... the voice of a crow that directs them on their journey, the messages of insects that give them the true names of the evil ones, the meaning of the painted eye, the importance of the arrangement of the clouds, the significance of a rustling in the night. By reading the signs of their world, the way becomes clear, and their path to victory is opened.</p><p>Comments and critiques welcome... and thanks for listening!</p><p>-- Bill Sethares</p></div>
