Your egocentric approach to a community of people who are both passionately devoted to non-12 musics, along with your film-thin knowledge of the subject matter is stunning to behold.

What you&apos;ve said seems to communicate &quot;do whatever you like, but make sure you do it right&quot; IE a sort of double-standard single true open-exchange is bound to have ideas which annoys a good few people if not the majority; that&apos;s the nature of the beast.  Anything where the issue of popularity of ideas is involved in trying to make certain members &quot;shut up more&quot; isn&apos;t true open-exchange.</p><p>  Yes I&apos;ve seen him/Marcel post to multiple lists several time in the past and am sure you&apos;ve given him warnings.<br/>   I don&apos;t see any problem with how you&apos;ve warned him in and of itself (IE you&apos;ve given him fair chance to correct what you see as his mistakes), but to see a problem in how it conflicts with the groups posted &quot;mission statement&quot; on it&apos;s homepage (IE the group policy does not say they are mistakes or provide reason to enforce against them to &quot;promote the group&apos;s mission&quot;).<br/>-------------------------<br/>  Though I have dished out this argument countless times on the tuning list I&apos;ll say it here: if you want there to be strict rules IE &quot;if X person keeps on sending messages about ideas Y many people think are over-rated, that person&apos;s posting ability will be limited/moderated&quot;, you should also have the integrity to list it on the tuning/MMM homepage so people joining know that from the get go and it does not become &quot;a rule only some people have to follow&quot;.<br/>  So, if there were such a rule posted on the homepage, I&apos;d say you were justified, say, censoring him even upon his second mistake...but since there is no written rule and he&apos;s still on topic (if annoying, in your opinion), I don&apos;t see why he&apos;s guilty unless/until there is one posted.</p><p>   My overall point: either this IS a restricted group or not: and that, IMVHO, should be made clear from the moment someone signs up for it.  It can&apos;t be both a restricted and non-restrictive group (non-restrictive meaning anything is game, &quot;wrong or right&quot;, so long as it stays on the topic of tuning and away from advertising commercial products/services).</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: jonszanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Mon, November 2, 2009 11:56:17 AM<br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] A couple of thoughts from the founder of MMM</p><p>Michael,</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;ve followed the majority of Marcel&apos;s posts, but I do take issue with the substance and tone of them.

Now I&apos;m hearing &quot;F-you&quot; on this list among members?!  That&apos;s pretty sad, man.</p><p>  Personally I think Marcel has made a LOT of progress in tuning (his harmonic JI in particular sounds much better than any of his previous theories and, IMVHO, significantly better than 12TET). ....And his &quot;egocentricity&quot; can just as easily be explained as honest, if overshot in some people&apos;s opinions, approach to the art.  I&apos;ve been in the same boat...the fact is neither him, nor myself, nor virtually anyone else are getting paid and/or famous for our efforts.</p><p>  It is common knowledge that those who want fame and money are much better off doing 12TET music, publicity stunts for the media, signing with major labels, performing in orchestras, movies, on broadway, etc. ...than doing anything that&apos;s been done on this list or micro-tonallity as a whole.  If you (or anyone else) honestly think the guy is doing all the work he does to please his ego, it just shows how out of touch you are with the point of this list.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    On the flip side, I recently started a few topics concerning micro-tonal scales and artists that could help introduce micro-tonal music in a positive like to the general public...but both threads, while very honestly intended, failed miserably to generate much response.  Yet hate mail, apparently, does generate a response here.</p><p>  Again, I swear the elitism here (including elitism in the form of people calling people putting honest work toward microtonality &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;egotistical&quot;), this time around in the case of Marcel, is not helping the development of micro-tonal music at all.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: touchedchuckk &lt;BadMuthaHubbard@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Tue, November 10, 2009 5:06:45 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: A couple of thoughts from the founder of MMM</p><p>Two tears in a bucket.</p><p>-Chuckk (it)</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@... &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Yeah, I played *that* card...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

I would give Marcel as a prime example here and myself as well.  There are some people who just aren&apos;t popular...and, IMVHO, they should not have to lie about their intentions (IE say they are worse then they actually are) just to get people to stop bullying them.<br/>    I&apos;ve found, when people feel they can give huge positive efforts and have those efforts consistently taken as negative, they eventually quit and thus give the bully the satisfaction of making them leave.  And I don&apos;t consider that a helpful outcome...even on this list I&apos;ve seen many innovators get thrown out for little more than a few tiny &quot;unprofessional&quot; errors in their work and the fact they weren&apos;t accepted as &quot;for real&quot; micro-tonalists....and that&apos;s pretty sad for a so called (open-to-all) group.<br/>*******************************************************************************************************</p><p>&gt;&quot;3) If somebody appears as a jerk to you, it is usally wise not to kick<br/>him in the ass.

If everyone says that the other has to stop first, it never stops.&quot;</p><p>    B) People who simply don&apos;t fight back IE ignore them or, worse, say &quot;oh I&apos;m so sorry&quot; and give up most or all influence.  AKA people who don&apos;t respect themselves.  You may think that not fighting back helps...until you figure out said person who has started it has gained others respect for being &quot;a leader&quot; and &quot;keeping things clean&quot; whereas you could have well had something decent, if not great, to contribute and find yourself censored out as &quot;not strongly smart, hard working, and determined enough&quot;.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    My personal opinion is that there is a middle ground for confronting online flames, which is something along the lines of saying &quot;Why on earth are you doing this?  Who do you think you are helping?...I/she/he certainly doesn&apos;t deserve this&quot; without resorting to name calling back.  There&apos;s a huge difference between saying, for example, even &quot;F you&quot; and &quot;What the F?...although cursing in general doesn&apos;t help.</p><p>   But it&apos;s a crying shame the Soon contest, for example, died down in such a bad light and so many people, apparently, complained about it who did not participate (IE they gave complaints but failed to even vaguely offer positive solutions).  Same goes for my own threads about the best consonant micro-tonal scales / artist to help introduce micro-tonality to the masses (I maybe got 2 responses from that), Ozan&apos;s &quot;Saba Storm&quot; scale/tuning description response, and other, I still believe &quot;could have been incredibly useful if  so many people weren&apos;t (apparently) too proud to take them seriously&quot; threads.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: hstraub64 &lt;<a href="mailto:straub@datacomm.ch">straub@datacomm.ch</a>&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Thu, November 12, 2009 7:10:47 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: A couple of thoughts from the founder of MMM</p><p>I have to say I am starting to lose my patience, too.
