If you mean that then<br/>&gt; on this recording I used two instruments:</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s what I meant. Sorry I didn&apos;t make it clear.</p><p>&gt; 1. Alto Bonang with 9 notes.<br/>&gt; 2. Gong with 4 notes.</p><p>Okay, and we are still kept guessing, fine :-)</p><p>I&apos;ll be interested to see what guesses you get.<br/>I did wonder about the slow vibrato too, but that<br/>is a puzzle about individual notes.</p><p>with the melody what puzzles me is that the notes<br/>are so uniform in timbre so that either you<br/>have a single sound producing source that can vary in<br/>pitch or several very identical ones<br/>at different pitches.</p><p>With a fixed number of notes, sounds like<br/>the second guess is the right one, so I<br/>wonder even more what it can be.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
