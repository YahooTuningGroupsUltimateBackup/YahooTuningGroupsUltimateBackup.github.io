I hope for clarity on this issue - the reason MMM exists and how it runs - and yesterday I thought it was all going to be just fine with you. Let me just settle a couple of issues.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Now I know that we like to talk a lot about how this group is not just any<br/>&gt;group but it is a very particular group because it has rules and these rules<br/>&gt;are posted on the front page and we must obey the rules...</p><p>And the rest of it. Yep, it&apos;s all there. You can like it or not, and there are probably millions of places that work in other ways that you could check out. I spent a good bit of time, in conjunction with my two colleagues, thinking up a preamble that would give me a *fair* way to have a sensible dialogue without huge blow-ups and name-calling and the like. It has worked pretty well.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;d like it if people followed those guidelines, and I don&apos;t think it is too much to ask.</p><p>As for people making music, I allow them to do that on their own time and on their own schedule. If the discussions happen to assist them in making music, and they take their sweet time about it, I don&apos;t have a problem. We exist to facilitate the act of creating new microtonal music, but there is no minimum amount of posting or timeframe anyone need follow.</p><p>&gt;we hear now how Jon had the idea to create a group about making micro &gt;music which is of course not really true. Jon&apos;s idea was to create a list &gt;which was the same<br/>&gt;as the other one but in which one single person would be banned from &gt;posting and that was a very desirable thing to most all of the people.</p><p>Jeff, that is not only completely false but hurtful. This list was started, upfront, with certain guidelines, and no one was kept from joining. If anyone wants to, they can join, and only behavior that reduces a positive s/n ratio on the list, as well as personal insults, will give me pause to remove a member.</p><p>To date, this has happened once: a person came and started spamming about a non-micro band, totally inappropriate. They were gone. That is it.</p><p>&gt;So I am going to post an example.</p><p>I&apos;ll give it a listen.</p><p>&gt;I used that free FM7 synth demo to write a little piece of music. I did &gt;not use a midi keyboard or a sequencer. No MIDI was attached to this &gt;computer during this piece.</p><p>Gee, that&apos;s great. I&apos;ve tried two nights now to find a host sequencing application to use that charming FM7 module so that I can have even the remotest experience of hitting a key and hearing a sound sometime before I grow a beard (that is a bit of an exaggeration, but the latency issue is still a big one. I almost thought about taping what it sounds like, where you can hear two sounds: my finger tapping the key, and then the sound coming after that). To a person who has spent his life refining rhythmic ability, this doesn&apos;t work for me.</p><p>I haven&apos;t given up. I&apos;ve also decided to work on it a bit and experiment before I blather to the list about how it completely doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>&gt;And so you can hear an example, here it is, using an ethnic Thai scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/thai1.mp3">http://www.nonoctave.com/thai1.mp3</a></p><p>Downloading now. Why don&apos;t you take some time and think about what I&apos;ve written.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4139 href="#4139">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2003 1:08:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;X.

I want to use a sequencer to create a piece of music that has multiple parts, recorded in multiple passes, with differing patches so I can achieve a semblance of interesting instrumentation. That it works in the stand-alone mode, and that one can play it that way to hear sounds, took me all of one minute to figure out. Had I wanted to release the results of playing with the different patches, in the mode of uploading an mp3, I could have done dozens of them.
