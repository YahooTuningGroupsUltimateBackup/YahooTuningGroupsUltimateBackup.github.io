My first intro<br/>into him was a book called Phillip K. Dick: The Dream Connection which i<br/>have never seen copies of. Outside of interviews with PKD it has testimonies<br/>of visitations by PKD  to different ones of his friends giving them the same<br/>info that they only verified after the fact. I was in des moine Iowa with<br/>nothing to do and went into the only used book store there and there was<br/>this copy of UBIK which starts off there in des moine Iowa. After that, his<br/>hard back books started to fall into my lap.<br/>    My friend Fred Tominselli, a well known artist in NY now, used to go<br/>visit him when he lived near Disneyland. He ended up not liking him for his<br/>political views, so be it.<br/>    Personally i have liked reading him especially when in the middle of<br/>composing, he has freed my mind up to jump in any direction,  reformulate<br/>the material i am working with, One can only do so many process pieces<br/>before the predictability becomes unbearable, at least for me. i am really<br/>trying to get away from them. To compose a piece of music like UBIK, now<br/>that would be something to aspire too!</p><p>jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Somehow, I&apos;m not surprised that you seem to like my favorite SF<br/>&gt; writer!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you ever meet him before he died?</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
