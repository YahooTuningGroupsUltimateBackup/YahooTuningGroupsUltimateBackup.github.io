I happened to be thinking about how it<br/>is quite easy to recognize and even assimilate the mysticism of the east and<br/>how  those resonating elements from africa seems to partake to a much lesser<br/>degree. i don&apos;t think the root of this is racial as much as cultural where<br/>we associate passivity with spirituality. I remember how much i was taken<br/>back for the first time by the sufi use of motion and action. The other<br/>worldly aspects in african culture come often is a just such a similar form</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.
