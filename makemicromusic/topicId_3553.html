When art seizes an individual powerfully,<br/>it draws him back to the views of those times when art flowered most<br/>vigorously; then its effect is to form by retrogression. The artist comes<br/>more and more to revere sudden excitements, believes in gods and demons,<br/>imbues nature with a soul, hates science, becomes unchangeable in his moods<br/>like the men of antiquity, and desires an overthrow of all conditions that<br/>are not favorable to art, and this with the vehemence and unreasonableness<br/>of a child. Now, the artist in and of himself is already a laggard creature<br/>because he still plays a game that belongs to youth and childhood;<br/>in addition, he is gradually being formed by retrogression into former<br/>times. Thus between him and the other men of his period who are the same<br/>age a vehement antagonism is finally generated, and a sad end just as,<br/>according to the tales of the ancients, both Homer and Aeschylus finally<br/>lived and died in melancholy.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
