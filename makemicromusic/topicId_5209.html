It improves the look and feel, and is generally &gt;less buggy.</p><p>Since I wrote (on the *other* list) earlier this morning, I had a chance to download and install 2.2 - big improvement! Thank you so much for keeping working on the GUI, even though I know it isn&apos;t your focus.</p><p>BTW, I was having a problem finding out how to save in the .tun format, but fortunately Jacky Ligon has a very nice 3-4 page tutorial in the CronoX manual on just how to do that.</p><p>Now that my &apos;playing field&apos; is getting pretty well set, I&apos;m looking forward to using Scala more to explore the music and tunings...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
