I&apos;ve only started to scratch the surface of what is possible with either of them.</p><p>For Csound, I recommend the Csound5.02.1-win32-d.exe installer[1], which is capable if 64-bit floating-point samples, for the high-quality output.  There are online tutorials at <a href="http://www.csounds.com">http://www.csounds.com</a>.  I don&apos;t know about you, but I learn best by example, so I recommend reading and running other peoples&apos; compositions.  I have a bunch of them at <a href="http://mysterybear.net">http://mysterybear.net</a>, and they are generally pretty simple.</p><p>For Blue, you need to have Java installed first, then download the latest installer[2].  It&apos;s a beta, but don&apos;t worry about that; Steven writes good stuff.  If you have Java properly installed, you should be able to just double-click on the installer file to run it.  Blue ships with some sample projects (including one of my pieces), and I have other pieces (like TimeWave Canon) that were written in Blue that you can open up and try out.</p><p>Both programs have mailing list where you can ask question and get help, and you should feel free to ask my questions too.  Good luck!</p><p>- Dave</p><p>[1] <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/csound/Csound5.02.1-win32-d.exe?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/csound/Csound5.02.1-win32-d.exe?download</a></p><p>[2] <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bluemusic/blue_0.106.0_beta3_installer.jar?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bluemusic/blue_0.106.0_beta3_installer.jar?download</a></p><p>J.Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; Well done, Dave. I&apos;ve been thinking about breaking into composition &gt; with something like Csound. I looked at the links to both Csound and &gt; Blue, but I&apos;m a bit bewildered at all the different file options. I &gt; have Windows XP...what files would a rank beginner like myself need &gt; to download to begin experiments with Blue and Csound? (The less &gt; command line input, the better. I really, really, really would &gt; prefer a GUI interface, if possible.)</p></div>
