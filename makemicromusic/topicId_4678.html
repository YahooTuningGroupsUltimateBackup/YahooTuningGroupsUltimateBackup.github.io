I  got FTS to talk to<br/>my keyboard, but the keyboard made percusion sounds on some keys and<br/>double tones on others.  The synth must have a different instruction<br/>set than expected.</p><p>I down loaded MIDICode and MIDIyoke.  I don&apos;t understand, if Allegro<br/>was sending MIDI commands to my keyboard didn&apos;t I already have a<br/>yoke?   I still need MIDIyoke if I want MIDIox and I reason I do so<br/>that I can see what does and doesn&apos;t work with my keyboard.</p><p>I installed MIDI yoke but it still needs connected some how I was<br/>expecting a GUI setup control panel, but it looks like I pick<br/>channels, as if they were instruments, from Allegro and MIDIcode and<br/>MultiMedia perhaps I&apos;m not real clear on this part.  Is there<br/>and &quot;in&quot; side and an &quot;out&quot; side with these channels or are they just<br/>connecting terminals?  If they just connect what is the point of<br/>confusing us by stating &quot;out&quot; goes to &quot;out.&quot;  No wonder people get<br/>confused and make feedback loops.</p><p>MIDIcode looks easy to use.  If the tutorial/manual didn&apos;t come all<br/>winzipped up I might even be able to get it to work.  Please spot me<br/>the way in: what do I do with whichfile to get it started.</p><p>Lastly Win98 se is currently silent.  Is that because MIDI yoko is<br/>not hooked up?  Bad weather better go now...</p><p>Jim</p></div><h3>Peter Frazer &#x3C;paf@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2003 4:05:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jim,</p><p>To use the Midicode Synthesizer Tutorial unzip it to any convenient directory then open Index.html</p><p>Rick,</p><p>Thanks for your recent comments, I am often well behind in reading these lists.</p><p>Peter<br/><a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div>
