Not long after I started MakeMicroMusic, I spent a lot of time in the KVR forums, tracking the progress of the soft instrument world, trying to prod developers into including microtonality, and it was there that I met Tim.</p><p>He epitomized the qualities we would want in a musician within a community: endless sharing of work and information, boundless enthusiasm, and what appeared to be a life-long fascination with the sheer magic of creating music. He was one of the most positive people I&apos;ve ever met in years on various forums, and it was reflected in his helping others. On top of all that, he was a uniquely gifted sound designer, and there are an awful lot of instruments that owe their success to his initial patch designs.</p><p>Thanks you for remembering him in music, and may his spirit be free to do as it pleases.</p><p>With respect,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=20761 href="#20761">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2009 4:41:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since I get the list in digest form, I only just received this post, and it was the first I had heard about Tim&apos;s untimely passing. Oh, dear... This shocker didn&apos;t register until John Szanto&apos;s reply. I didn&apos;t know Tim, but he and I were both involved with the early development of Rhino, and I&apos;ve used and abused some of his Rhino patches for years. Wow... Hope he&apos;s now designing patches and playing with the immortals upstairs!</p><p>   Rick</p></div><h3><a id=20762 href="#20762">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2009 6:23:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carlo,</p><p>I meant to say this before, but since I&apos;ve given it (already) a couple of listens, that is a lovely piece.
