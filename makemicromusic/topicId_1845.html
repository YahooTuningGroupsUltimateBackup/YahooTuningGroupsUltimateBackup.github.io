J. Scott<br/>Neutral 3rd MOS tuning on bamboo xylophone.</p><p>The primitive instrument breathes in and out violently;<br/>it falls back and forth, precipitously. Rumbling, it<br/>tears through the thin, cold evening air. Plucked, it<br/>resonates, calling forth the yellow-orange presence<br/>unseen, yet felt, heard and tasted.<br/>==================================================</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1847 href="#1847">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

With your choice of timbre, I can really hear this scale tuned up on some acoustic mbiras, and then let some people who know that particular vernacular start making some new pieces. Maybe George Z. will make some, once he gets his hands on some gourds!</p><p>P.S. Jeff: you seem to have the same little bug that Monz had: your posts came in dated from 2001 -  I thought they got filtered to the trash, but they we just waaaaaay back at the beginning of my CMM mailbox!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who&apos;s up late with Partch web site updates...)</p></div>
