She is nice person, and she has H-Pi Tonal Plexus keyboard. As far as I know they don&apos;t continue under this name.... Maybe we will do some out od tune music together if there&apos;s some opportunity. But IMHO there&apos;s no market, no interest in microtonal music in Japan. There are enough out of tune notes from koto, shakuhachi and Theremin performers here :-)</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 16 May 2010, at 1:42 PM, Michael wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Syzygys">http://www.last.fm/music/Syzygys</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t know how they manage it...but this group from Japan not only &gt; makes 43-tone based pop music, but manages to make it sound &gt; confident and catchy.
