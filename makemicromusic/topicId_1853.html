The first one I recorded last year,<br/>and I thought I may as well put it up now I&apos;ve got more web space.  In<br/>fact, listening back to it I found it was better than I thought.</p><p>The other one I recorded this weekend.  I noticed I hadn&apos;t let anything<br/>escape for a while, and didn&apos;t want any of you to think I&apos;d given up on<br/>the sound-producing part of music.  It might be okay with strict editing,<br/>but I&apos;m not inclined to do that, so it&apos;s all or nothing.  Anybody who<br/>wants proof of continuing musical activity can listen to it as penance.</p><p>Whatever you think about the music, I might be interested in comments<br/>about the effects programming.  It&apos;s all algorithmically constructed from<br/>first principles.  As I don&apos;t have hands-on experience of conventional,<br/>high quality equipment I don&apos;t know what I might be missing.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=1882 href="#1882">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

But of course the only way for you to hear what I&apos;m doing is for<br/>me to record and upload something like this.  The guitar&apos;s only a<br/>sideline, so I don&apos;t need to be precious about what people get to hear.</p><p>&gt; You got a really crunchy distortion on the guitar, but that wasn&apos;t an<br/>&gt; outboard effect?

There are a couple of tricks<br/>beyond straight clipping, but I don&apos;t use response curves of tube<br/>amplifiers or anything like that.  It means I can tweak the sound, and<br/>also get it crisper than a real guitar amp would be.</p><p>The MIDI pieces are mostly recorded into the sequencer.  Sometimes I<br/>record a pattern over and over and loop the best one.  If it&apos;s a full<br/>melody, I record it in and adjust anything that sounds wrong.  I&apos;m<br/>generally trying to avoid the quantised sound I&apos;d get by drawing<br/>everything in, or the work it&apos;d take to draw everything in the way I want<br/>it.</p><p>With the guitar, there&apos;s no way of editing out the mistakes, and there are<br/>a few of them in both examples, particularly the mellow one.  That can be<br/>too pedestrian rhythms as well as too wayward ones, and misfingerings.  As<br/>there isn&apos;t any backing, the looseness isn&apos;t really something I think<br/>about.</p><p>&gt; Or something.</p><p>Indeed, for dance music it is good to have at least one instrument holding<br/>a precise rhythm.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, thanks for posting that stuff - I hope you keep nurturing this<br/>&gt; side of your self as well...</p><p>I can record something every now and then if you like.  I&apos;m also working<br/>on thought-out compositions.  I should be better at them, but they take a<br/>lot longer to finish.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
