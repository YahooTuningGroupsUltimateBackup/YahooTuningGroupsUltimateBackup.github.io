I think that the negative connotations surrounding<br/>overanalyzing music theory spring partially from the fact that there<br/>are a lot of things about common practice theory, for example, that<br/>are counterintuitive and really just the parlance of the day. If you<br/>applied classical common practice music theory to jamming out over<br/>some Dead tunes, you probably won&apos;t get very far. The same applies<br/>with jazz theory and all kinds of other theories. God forbid we ever<br/>see a rock theory. And to be honest, that&apos;s a fault that I attribute<br/>to the nature of the music &quot;theories&quot; that we&apos;ve seen so far. They are<br/>simply guesses and as a result they are crude and ineffective, and the<br/>people who swear by them are often the people who write the most<br/>lifeless music.</p><p>That being said, deep down, everyone has their own music theory. They<br/>already have an idea of how things work. Even if you&apos;re the type who<br/>gets so into the zone while improvising that you stop all thinking<br/>entirely, you will still be hearing what to play in your head or<br/>finding it on your instrument or something. And the way that you find<br/>out what to play, whether it&apos;s subconscious or not, is the REAL music<br/>theory. And everyone has access to it already - it&apos;s called just<br/>playing.</p><p>Real music theory doesn&apos;t distinguish between microtonal and<br/>macrotonal and 12tet music. Real music theory accepts that there is no<br/>way to fit every possible musical effect into one neat box. Real music<br/>theory might describe a 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord as &quot;resonant&quot; without<br/>necessarily going into where it &quot;fits&quot; or whether or not it sounds<br/>&quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; It&apos;s so different from formal music theory that it&apos;s<br/>almost not worth calling music theory. It&apos;s almost more of a mixture<br/>of acoustics, psychoacoustics, and psychology.</p><p>In fact, if you ever go take lessons from a private teacher on an<br/>instrument or for composition, you might get some brilliant insights<br/>from watching or listening to this person do what they do. And that&apos;s<br/>really just you learning their theory. It produces those &quot;aha&quot;<br/>moments, and so you expand your own internal music theory. So all I&apos;m<br/>really suggesting is we figure out what that&apos;s all about! Study that,<br/>take THAT music theory and just put it into words.</p><p>And while it&apos;s certainly not a substitute for just sitting down and<br/>playing, it&apos;s certainly going to be a step up from the confusing mess<br/>that is music school right now, and interesting to think about.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Jun 19, 2008 at 2:14 AM,  &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey, just following up on the mention of science a minute ago...I really<br/>&gt; enjoy science, it&apos;s a hoot, and good fun stuff.

Besides being<br/>mostly untrue it demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge of what<br/>science is and what it is for which sadly puts it at a similar level<br/>of comprehension to most American adults. Fortunately science is<br/>seldom important for a musician so this kind of blather doesn&apos;t hurt<br/>much but lets not glorify this kind of ignorance.</p><p>By the way, Einstein is not important because of his pithy quotes. He<br/>is important because he &quot;explained&quot; some complex and subtle parts of<br/>how the world works. If those explanations didn&apos;t work no one would be<br/>quoting him. No one would know who he was or care. He had no<br/>particular expertise in weighing the relative value of knowledge vs<br/>imagination in solving any particular random problem and should not be<br/>quoted as an expert on that subject. He happened to be working on<br/>problems that could only be understood if you rejected your intuition<br/>and believe the math. That doesn&apos;t describe most problems. For most<br/>problems intuition is a powerful tool. It took imagination for<br/>Einstein to figure out what the apparently bizarre math results meant.<br/>However Einstein always started with data and math. He used<br/>imagination to think of non intuitive possibilities and then came back<br/>to boring data and math to test those possibilities.</p><p>You can&apos;t truly be a fan of Einstein unless you understand his work.<br/>If you don&apos;t understand his work then anything you take from him is<br/>out of context and showing him disrespect. Einstein would have<br/>disagreed with everything in this post. In particular contrary to the<br/>poster&apos;s view he believed that the universe is largely explainable by<br/>science. Using his words to justify any other conclusion is offensive<br/>to him and his ideas.</p><p>I speak as someone does understand much of Einstein&apos;s work in the<br/>language he described it to his fellow scientists, namely mathematics.<br/>His pithy quotes were directed at the popular press. In fact I<br/>understand the physics of that era well enough that I can usually make<br/>it clear to an intelligent layman if they are patient enough. I won&apos;t<br/>waste the time of this list with that off topic discussion but if<br/>anyone is curious I am wiling to discuss it off line. It is a<br/>fascinating story and an extreme case of not being able to trust your<br/>own experience.</p><p>Here is what Einstein might have said if he was trying to teach<br/>instead of entertain:</p><p>- You can be a scientist with knowledge but limited imagination.</p><p>- You cannot be a scientist with plenty of imagination but no<br/>knowledge. Sorry. Knowledge is required to be a successful scientist.</p><p>- You cannot be a Great Scientist with out both. This is the real<br/>point Einstein was trying to make to young physicists. Remember that<br/>he was educated in Germany and Austria, notorious in those days  for<br/>the most gruesomely dry and boring treatment of all education but<br/>especially math and science. He wanted students to occasionally lift<br/>their heads out of their books and lectures and let the mind roam. He<br/>didn&apos;t say (because it was obvious) that you then needed to put your<br/>head back in the book, after you were done roaming.</p></div><h3><a id=19071 href="#19071">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 8:24:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Steve Morris&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; By the way, Einstein is not important because of his pithy<br/>&gt; quotes.

Another straw<br/>man fallacy. Certainly those words don&apos;t appear in my post. Are you<br/>sure you read it? Perhaps you just skimmed it.</p><p>Einstein was well qualified to have opinions in his areas of expertise<br/>which was using the the scientific method to explain the world. He<br/>would have strongly disagreed with the original post which said that<br/>science doesn&apos;t explain much about the world.</p><p>Many smart people make fools of themselves by making strong statements<br/>in areas where they have no particular expertise. This is a common<br/>failing of many Nobel lauriats. The great unwashed masses often<br/>blindly accept these statements in a kind of uncritical hero worship.<br/>In his area of expertise Einstein was well qualified to have opinions<br/>that must be taken seriously. Outside his area of expertise he was<br/>just a smart guy like many smart guys. It is a fallacy to say that<br/>since Einstein was brilliant in one area of expertise we should<br/>believe him when he speaks on subjects where his qualifications are<br/>not as special. Calling on Einstein like some kind of deity is not a<br/>useful way to arrive at truth. He was a smart man but he was not<br/>infallible and the farther away he was from his area of expertise the<br/>more fallible he was.</p><p>If you read the trail of papers which culminate in his relativity<br/>paper you realize that Einstein didn&apos;t invent much at all. instead he<br/>was mostly a synthesist like many great scientists before him<br/>(including Newton and Darwin.) He took the scattered ideas of his<br/>time, integrated them and tightened them up and gave them back as a<br/>consistent and complete theory. Newton explained this process by<br/>saying &quot;If I have seen farther than others it is because I have stood<br/>on the shoulders of giants.&quot;</p><p>The Einstein legend has been blown way out of proportion partly<br/>because of his own clever self promotion but mostly because we want<br/>our heros simple and solitary. We want to believe that they did their<br/>work single handed against the resistance of the world. He was a great<br/>man but he couldn&apos;t have done what he did without the help of many<br/>collaborators and correspondents. He was not a particularly good<br/>mathematician. He knew most of the great physicists and mathematicians<br/>of his time and was in frequent communication with many of them. He<br/>went to conferences where he gave and listened to papers. He wrote a<br/>survey of the critical problems of his day and in the process worked<br/>closely with the people working on those problems. He drew on their<br/>ideas and expertise. For two of his three great contributions (the<br/>photoelectric effect and special relativity) he was only a little<br/>ahead of some of his more clever peers. The General was a bigger leap.</p></div><h3><a id=19076 href="#19076">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 12:19:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Replied offlist.

If you don&apos;t understand where<br/>&gt;he is coming from you are a fan not of Einstein but of some incomplete<br/>&gt;projection of Einstein you have created in your mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If he would have taken disrespect at my reading of his essays,<br/>&gt;&gt; why did he write them?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hmm.... where the heck did this come from. Straw man fallacy. I never<br/>&gt;said that he would take disrespect at your reading his essays. You are<br/>&gt;inventing that argument and putting those words in my mouth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Einstein would have disagreed with everything in this post.<br/>&gt;&gt; I thought you said he wasn&apos;t qualified to pass judgments on posts!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am puzzled why you would think such a bizarre thing. Another straw<br/>&gt;man fallacy. Certainly those words don&apos;t appear in my post. Are you<br/>&gt;sure you read it? Perhaps you just skimmed it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Einstein was well qualified to have opinions in his areas of expertise<br/>&gt;which was using the the scientific method to explain the world. He<br/>&gt;would have strongly disagreed with the original post which said that<br/>&gt;science doesn&apos;t explain much about the world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Many smart people make fools of themselves by making strong statements<br/>&gt;in areas where they have no particular expertise. This is a common<br/>&gt;failing of many Nobel lauriats. The great unwashed masses often<br/>&gt;blindly accept these statements in a kind of uncritical hero worship.<br/>&gt;In his area of expertise Einstein was well qualified to have opinions<br/>&gt;that must be taken seriously. Outside his area of expertise he was<br/>&gt;just a smart guy like many smart guys. It is a fallacy to say that<br/>&gt;since Einstein was brilliant in one area of expertise we should<br/>&gt;believe him when he speaks on subjects where his qualifications are<br/>&gt;not as special. Calling on Einstein like some kind of deity is not a<br/>&gt;useful way to arrive at truth. He was a smart man but he was not<br/>&gt;infallible and the farther away he was from his area of expertise the<br/>&gt;more fallible he was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If you read the trail of papers which culminate in his relativity<br/>&gt;paper you realize that Einstein didn&apos;t invent much at all. instead he<br/>&gt;was mostly a synthesist like many great scientists before him<br/>&gt;(including Newton and Darwin.) He took the scattered ideas of his<br/>&gt;time, integrated them and tightened them up and gave them back as a<br/>&gt;consistent and complete theory. Newton explained this process by<br/>&gt;saying &quot;If I have seen farther than others it is because I have stood<br/>&gt;on the shoulders of giants.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Einstein legend has been blown way out of proportion partly<br/>&gt;because of his own clever self promotion but mostly because we want<br/>&gt;our heros simple and solitary. We want to believe that they did their<br/>&gt;work single handed against the resistance of the world. He was a great<br/>&gt;man but he couldn&apos;t have done what he did without the help of many<br/>&gt;collaborators and correspondents. He was not a particularly good<br/>&gt;mathematician. He knew most of the great physicists and mathematicians<br/>&gt;of his time and was in frequent communication with many of them. He<br/>&gt;went to conferences where he gave and listened to papers. He wrote a<br/>&gt;survey of the critical problems of his day and in the process worked<br/>&gt;closely with the people working on those problems. He drew on their<br/>&gt;ideas and expertise. For two of his three great contributions (the<br/>&gt;photoelectric effect and special relativity) he was only a little<br/>&gt;ahead of some of his more clever peers. The General was a bigger leap.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=19077 href="#19077">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 12:22:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; On Fri, Jun 20, 2008 at 11:24 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Quite the contrary.

Einstein,<br/>especially, is a personal hero...and, of course, he said &quot;Imagination<br/>is more important than knowledge.&quot; I couldn&apos;t agree more; and, of<br/>course, a very important  thing to keep in mind, when we mention<br/>science, is: just what science CAN do, and what it CAN&apos;T. Of course,<br/>that is a subject open for some chatting; but, I tend to think that<br/>the Universe is not largely explainable by &quot;science.&quot; Or logic. Death<br/>is a pretty good example of that; ain&apos;t much that science can do about<br/>that, overall. And, I feel the same way about music, of course, being<br/>a musician. Talk about numbers and fractions with music all you want;<br/>but, that&apos;s not the SOUND of music, and that&apos;s what is most important.<br/>In tune, out of tune, consonance, dissonance...these are at the<br/>service of the artist, and may play different roles in the overall<br/>vision of a statement, a composition. In themselves, they do not<br/>define actual music in any way. A ratio between notes can be used in<br/>many ways in a piece of music...to express profound ideas through<br/>music may require very creative uses of basic frequencies, of which<br/>there are untold trillions; and there are just as many ways to apply<br/>those frequencies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I had a friend tell me a while back that &quot;science is my<br/>religion.&quot; That&apos;s ok by me, and I think that many folks today feel the<br/>same way, to one degree or another. But, it isn&apos;t mine...I think<br/>there&apos;s wayway more to the mysteries of the Universe than what science<br/>(or any sort of &quot;organized&quot; religion) thinks it can explain. When<br/>scientists can create a planet, not to mention a star, I&apos;ll be more<br/>impressed. Crap, we can&apos;t even time our streetlights right, or send a<br/>guy to Mars...just how powerful is science anyway? And speaking of<br/>anyway, creating music is what I love best, and learning to use the<br/>concepts of tuning theory helps me deepen as a composer/player.<br/>Applying these concepts to create real music, though, requires a lot<br/>of time and energy...and the end result has nothing to do with what<br/>something looks like on paper; you gotta HEAR<br/>it...best...Hstick...myspace.com/microstick   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=19084 href="#19084">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 7:06:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; I agree, although I think there&apos;s nothing wrong with asking &quot;why&quot; in a<br/>&gt; musical context. I think that the negative connotations surrounding<br/>&gt; overanalyzing music theory spring partially from the fact that there<br/>&gt; are a lot of things about common practice theory, for example, that<br/>&gt; are counterintuitive and really just the parlance of the day. If you<br/>&gt; applied classical common practice music theory to jamming out over<br/>&gt; some Dead tunes, you probably won&apos;t get very far. The same applies<br/>&gt; with jazz theory and all kinds of other theories. God forbid we ever<br/>&gt; see a rock theory. And to be honest, that&apos;s a fault that I attribute<br/>&gt; to the nature of the music &quot;theories&quot; that we&apos;ve seen so far. They are<br/>&gt; simply guesses and as a result they are crude and ineffective, and the<br/>&gt; people who swear by them are often the people who write the most<br/>&gt; lifeless music.<br/>&gt;   There&apos;s definitely a rock theory, at least for certain types of rock, namely that of Yes, ELP, Peter Gabriel-era Genesis, Dream Theater, that sort of thing.
