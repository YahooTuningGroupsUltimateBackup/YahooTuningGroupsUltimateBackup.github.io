I thought the program had<br/>actually<br/>&gt;locked up. Is the latest release, as far as you know, pretty much<br/>bug-free?</p><p>I noticed this too. It&apos;s very slow when the directory contains many files.<br/>So I don&apos;t use it much, but use the DIR and LOAD commands. You can keep it<br/>open however if you go to Edit-&gt;Options-&gt;Misc and tick (check) &quot;Do not<br/>close<br/>Open File dialog&quot;. You can also use Robert&apos;s dialog instead, invoke it with<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/open">@open</a>.<br/>The problem is in the GUI code, which is being improved, so I&apos;m just<br/>waiting<br/>for the next release. If that doesn&apos;t solve it, I might write a better<br/>dialog myself.<br/>The code that I wrote is indeed pretty much bug-free I think. There are<br/>about 20 downloads per day and I seldomly get a bug report.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

There are people who use the<br/>Linux version but indeed only few. Another GUI toolkit is<br/>not a thought for a number of reasons:<br/>- The most important user (me) uses the Tru64 Unix version<br/>for an important reason: development.<br/>- There are not so many other GUI builders which produce Ada.<br/>- GTK is open source, if I really need to improve some part,<br/>I could do it.<br/>- GTK is powerful.<br/>- I&apos;m not working on a Mac version, but Gimp is being ported<br/>to MacOS X, so a Mac version will become a possibility.<br/>- I don&apos;t like the way where Windows is going.</p><p>&gt;But only a thought, as I know what development is like! :)</p><p>With Ada a lot of fun, really!</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
