This can, among a great<br/>many other things, produce midi files with microtonal pitch bends.<br/>Such a midi file is, of course, already microtonal music, and can be<br/>converted to an audio file which sounds better by means of a midi<br/>renderer.

This, I am afraid, is a huge topic,<br/>and even when you&apos;ve chosen a scale you need to learn how to make it<br/>work. A popular choice of late has been a scale of 21 tones out of 72<br/>called Blackjack. You could look at the archives on the tuning group,<br/>and ask questions. Joseph Pehrson is a composer, not a tuning wizard,<br/>and he uses Blackjack, so I am sure you could also.</p><p>One question we might ask is what sort of microtonal music would you<br/>prefer to make?</p></div><h3><a id=4666 href="#4666">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2003 10:05:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>&gt; My name is Toni Ahvenainen and I&apos;m new in this list.

My views on how it can be<br/>made are overly simplistic and should spark some objections but here<br/>goes.  Study music from other countries (PBSU  Has a telecourse<br/>call &quot;Exploring the World of Music&quot;). The different regions all have<br/>rules or guidelines.  You will want your own set of rules and<br/>guidelines (which you will amend by project).  Start with music from<br/>India perhaps.  Start with scales you can make using the 12 tet<br/>system you have.  Keep C (tonic), G (fifth) and F (natural fouth) or<br/>use F# (augmented fourth) pick any two out of the four notes between<br/>C and F also G and C.  Now using only the notes in your scale just<br/>selected, construct a monophonic melody.  To make a  &quot;Raga&quot; make a<br/>fixed lenght rhythmic pattern with a beginning, middle, and end.  As<br/>the rhythm cycle repeats start at the tonic (C) again.  Add a drone<br/>for color and you are at least getting a feel for what&apos;s possible.</p><p>LOL,<br/>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=4668 href="#4668">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xD6;ljare &#x3C;oljare@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2003 2:44:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; somewhere else, that I need some programs to feed midi to cubase sx<br/>&gt; (since cubase only has 12 notes in octave).
