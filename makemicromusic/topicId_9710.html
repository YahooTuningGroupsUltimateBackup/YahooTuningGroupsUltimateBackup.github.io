See how everything is related to each other. I was told<br/>&gt;&gt;the same thing by some of the veterans.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Didn&apos;t Jay say he wanted a non-theoretical approach, based<br/>&gt;on listening to his playing and talking to himself?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl</p><p>My approach to JI is not to think in terms of limits,  but rather, just go<br/>straight to the raw Overtone Series.

I&apos;d say these<br/>two added tones were the &quot;juiciest&quot;, first the minor 13th on C - the<br/>13-limit note, then the minor 9th on the F - the 17-limit note.

It defines the scale in the sense that as soon as you hear g&amp; or B dim you know where you are in the scale. Of course composers moved away from the obvious resolutions rather quickly</p><p>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;My point being that the more dissonant such chords might be as the<br/>&gt;&gt;result of how they occur in a scale, the more definable they might be.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;[YA]  ... definable ...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>yes it is the dissonances that tell us where we are in the scale. Since there are a few major and minor chords, one cannot be sure.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
