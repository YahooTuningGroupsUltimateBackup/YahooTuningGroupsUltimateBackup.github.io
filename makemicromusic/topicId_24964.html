My concern was not with the judging, but with claims about it. It is simply not a fact that the ranking the contest came up with is a ranking by quality or value, and hence no such claim should be made, explicitly or implicitly. It *is* a fact that you lost the contest. It is equally a fact that both Carl and I, as it happens, ranked you number 1. That&apos;s not a criticism of the judging, it&apos;s a criticism of inflated claims, implicitly or explicitly made, about what such a judgment is and what result it produces. I hope and expect not to see such things in the future, but if I do, I reserve the right to comment.</p><p>  If you like, you can read about my reason for entering and my thoughts in the aftermath:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/21403">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/21403</a></p><p>Interesting, but most microtonal music strikes me as more minimal than I like.

If you want to<br/>&gt; &gt; engage the listener in your composition, then you should have both<br/>&gt; &gt; expected and unexpected things occurring, but these must be<br/>&gt; &gt; carefully balanced.  If there are too many expected things, then<br/>&gt; &gt; the piece will tend to become tiresome, but if there are too many<br/>&gt; &gt; unexpected things, then the listener will find it difficult to<br/>&gt; &gt; follow the piece and is apt to lose interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Was it me, that someone?
