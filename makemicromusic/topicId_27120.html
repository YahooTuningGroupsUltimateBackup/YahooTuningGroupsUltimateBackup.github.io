If I have 11 divisions getting me to less than an<br/>&gt; &gt; octave, how can 22 of those divisions get me to 3 octaves?</p><p>Igs:<br/>&gt; 8/1=3600 cents. 3600/22=163.6363... You said 11 equal divisions of 1800 cents.</p><p>Me, now:<br/>Um, yeah. That&apos;s called me being a bonehead.</p><p>I could have chosen (and almost did) a more off-kilter number, like 1715. That wouldn&apos;t be a multiple of 1200 cents for 343 iterations. But I think we can agree that the number probably wouldn&apos;t matter, because there would still be consonances inadvertently lurking in there somewhere.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Only if you&apos;re trying to make tonal music. If you&apos;re trying to make<br/>&gt; &gt; atonal music, then it&apos;s no easier or harder to use the scale in, say,<br/>&gt; &gt; serial construction, but you&apos;re less likely to hit an accidentally<br/>&gt; &gt; strongly tonal interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is probably true. But the same could be said of 8-EDO.</p><p>If you consciously ignore the octave. I&apos;ll ignore that since we currently seem to have a difference of opinion about what an octave is in relation to the word &quot;consonance&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I guess that&apos;s where my idea of &quot;consonance&quot; differs from others. I see<br/>&gt; consonance as something that sounds &quot;good&quot;, not something that sounds...<br/>&gt; unnoticeable. I&apos;ll grant that the octave is a very important ingredient in how<br/>&gt; we make music. But the idea that the &quot;most consonant&quot;--i.e. &quot;most pleasant<br/>&gt; -sounding&quot; interval is 1/1, followed by 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, and 5/1, and THEN 3/2,<br/>&gt; etc.--seems ass-backwards to me.</p><p>I don&apos;t think &quot;consonant&quot; as used on these lists really CAN mean &quot;pleasant-sounding&quot;, regardless of whether that&apos;s the way it&apos;s often used. After a half-hour drone on 1/1, I&apos;ll bet most of us would find any change to any other interval more pleasant-sounding than more 1/1. And, as someone said -- Kyle Gann, maybe? I read his Web site several times a few months ago -- the 386-cent M3 often sounds &quot;sad&quot; to people who are used to hearing the 400-cent version. I also agree that it&apos;s foolish to say that 1/1 sounds &quot;better&quot; than 2/1, and saying that 2/1 sounds &quot;better&quot; than 5/4 is simply off-base.</p><p>&quot;Consonance&quot; seems to be a term of art that means &quot;more closely related to&quot;. 1/1 is most closely related to itself; 2/1 is next closely related to 1/1. 3/2 seems next, and 4/3 and 5/4 seem to be closely related to 1/1, similar in distance to each other but both farther away from 1/1 than 3/2 is. Regardless of what measure might be useful for that distance -- Tenney Height seems like something close but perhaps not perfect -- the fact is that some intervals seem to be less closely related to a given root tone than others are.</p><p>Does that mean that any of these &quot;sound better&quot; than the others? I don&apos;t think so. Debussy sounds better to me than Mozart, generally speaking. Rush sounds better to me than bubble-gum pop music. Rush and Debussy use a lot more dissonant notes than Mozart and Britney Spears.</p><p>In some cases, you want very closely related notes because they impart a restful or clear or rooted quality, in some cases you want distantly related notes because you want a tense or more ambiguous or unrooted quality. But is ambiguity &quot;worse&quot; than clarity? Not in most art, and certainly not in music; &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; depends on context. Fish sauce is awesome in Thai food, but not so much on ice cream. Or so I&apos;d guess. :)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div>
