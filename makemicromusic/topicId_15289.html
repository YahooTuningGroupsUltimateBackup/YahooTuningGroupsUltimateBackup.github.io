When I create a Max/Msp object using<br/>MaxMagicMicrotuner, it only outputs truncated<br/>frequencies (no decimal) - even into float objects.</p><p>2.  I tried using coll to get around problem 1, but<br/>the same thing happened</p><p>3.  Assuming that I will eventually fix #1, how do I<br/>convert frequencies back into a midi signal - This is<br/>the only way I&apos;ve thought of, but there should be a<br/>simpler way (right?...) - ftom seems to just round<br/>everything to the nearest midi note, so if I use two<br/>coll objects - one with the desired frequency for each<br/>keyboard pitch, and one with the actual frequency -<br/>then take the difference and pass that out to a<br/>bendout, while the original midi note goes to a<br/>noteout on the same channel.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Want to start your own business?<br/>Learn how on Yahoo!

I ask because in about 5 years of this list, I can really remember anyone mentioning using max/msp (well, maybe one person), and certainly not in the paradigm you are talking about. Seems like it should be able to be done, but... Besides, the synths you mention facilitate microtuning through tuning tables, no? I don&apos;t know that there is any way to send them a midi message for microtuning (unless you are talking about implementing all this with pitch bends, in which case the synth doesn&apos;t have to be micro-capable).</p><p>Sorry, that probably isn&apos;t much help. Check with Victor, developer of the tuning app, and see if he has any ideas. OTOH, maybe someone new to the list is lurking and just waiting to answer a question like this.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
