A lot of the material in _Bitches<br/>Brew_ was derived from the Augmented (3-1-3-1-3-1) scale; one of the<br/>few instructions given by Miles to the players had to do with<br/>combining the E major, Ab major, and C major triads. Clearly this<br/>scale has no inherent tonal center either. The same structure can be<br/>derived from 5-limit JI if the 128:125 &apos;diesis&apos; is understood or<br/>tempered to vanish and octave equivalence is assumed. For those who<br/>don&apos;t have my &apos;Middle Path&apos; paper, a way of tuning this scale which<br/>does &apos;minimal damage&apos; in the 5-prime-limit is</p><p>0<br/>305.87<br/>399.02<br/>704.89<br/>798.04<br/>1103.91<br/>(1197.06)</p><p>Which one can understand as having an interval of equivalence of<br/>1197.06 cents, a period one third of that (399.02 cents), and a<br/>generator of 305.87 cents, if one wishes.

A lot of the material in _Bitches &gt;Brew_ was derived from the Augmented (3-1-3-1-3-1) scale; one of the &gt;few instructions given by Miles to the players had to do with &gt;combining the E major, Ab major, and C major triads. Clearly this &gt;scale has no inherent tonal center either. The same structure can be &gt;derived from 5-limit JI if the 128:125 &apos;diesis&apos; is understood or &gt;tempered to vanish and octave equivalence is assumed. For those who &gt;don&apos;t have my &apos;Middle Path&apos; paper, a way of tuning this scale which &gt;does &apos;minimal damage&apos; in the 5-prime-limit is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;0<br/>&gt;305.87<br/>&gt;399.02<br/>&gt;704.89<br/>&gt;798.04<br/>&gt;1103.91<br/>&gt;(1197.06)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which one can understand as having an interval of equivalence of &gt;1197.06 cents, a period one third of that (399.02 cents), and a &gt;generator of 305.87 cents, if one wishes. Unfortunately, this is &gt;going to sound awfully close to the 12-equal version, so it&apos;s not &gt;very &quot;microtonal&quot; I guess . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;11&apos;s definitely pushes us away from the 12 tone matrix, which makes &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;them &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;hard to take at first.<br/>&gt;&gt; I have gotten used to them yet i find a rather urgent foreboding &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;in &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;them sometimes.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The eikosany , since it has no real tonal center, or if one is &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;formed it &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;is easily undermined  by just moving anywhere a step or two, that &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;it &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;tends to have a certain &quot; ungroundedness&quot; to it.<br/>&gt;&gt;It reminds me more of Bitches Brew in a weird way, which was done &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;at the &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;time this structure came about.<br/>&gt;&gt; a constant becoming and unbecoming.<br/>&gt;&gt; i imagine Tibetan might like it as preparatory for dealing with &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;the bardo.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; one is standing nowhere but surrounded by or standing inside a &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;great jewel.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A myriad of facets<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Chris &amp; Melissa Bryan wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;On 9/20/05, Magnus Jonsson &lt;magnus@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What is the intended effect on the listener?

One of the cool things I found with the tetrad cycles is that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;they have interesting patterns alternating between otonal and utonal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;harmonies, which you can listen for.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Let me know what you think!

I much prefer an economy of pitch, picking a set beforehand<br/>and sticking to it, whether it be derived from a diamond or mandala or<br/>whatever. I was concerned about his approach that it would be more or less<br/>undecipherable to the listener. But he&apos;s written some cool stuff. So maybe<br/>it proves the afore-mentioned point that the complexity balance matters less<br/>than the composer&apos;s ability to work within whatever balance is chosen. It&apos;s<br/>interesting, my unscientific observations suggest that a person&apos;s preference<br/>for complexity or minimality is pretty strongly defined... perhaps it has<br/>its root in personality traits or worldview. I think and respond pretty<br/>slowly, and I tend to prefer minimalism...

Well spotted, that man! :-)  But I&apos;ve gotta say, for mine, I really<br/>very<br/>much prefer his early string quartets - particularly the Cminor (Op 18 No4),<br/>which seems to me to ring the death-knell for classicism.  That for me is<br/>about the sweet spot of complexity; it has just enough repetition to feel<br/>formally classical, while at the same time delivering enough emotion to be<br/>decidedly outspoken.  But I doubt you could really call it either sparse or<br/>efficient.  Much of Mozart seems remarkably sparse to me - I&apos;ve been<br/>studying the Eb Quintet KV 407 for Horn and strings recently, and it looks<br/>like the reputed complaint of &quot;too many notes, Herr Mozart!&quot; is here totally<br/>unjustified - it&apos;s hard to see how such sparse textures can generate the<br/>impression of so much sound.  I think he&apos;s the bee&apos;s knees when it comes to<br/>an eloquent simplicity.</p><p>&gt; ... Second to him, is actually Bach.  His<br/>&gt; slow movements are also right up there.</p><p>You know, after several decades, I&apos;m still learning new things about<br/>voicing and part-writing every time I work through Bach&apos;s Two-Part<br/>Inventions - proof positive that &quot;less is more&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  Easily the equal of these<br/>&gt; masters in terms of sparse efficiency is much traditional music,<br/>&gt; especially that of the Middle-East and India.</p><p>Seconded!  I may have mentioned before that I&apos;m also partial to<br/>Bollywood music.  While much of it is overblown, some of it is way<br/>up there with the best of classical Indian music for the skill of the<br/>artists in setting a beautiful melody simply.  When combined with<br/>the power and beauty of a voice like Lata Mangeshkar&apos;s, the result<br/>is as good as it gets.</p><p>&gt; As for Davis, it just<br/>&gt; sounds like bad lounge music to me.  But whatever.</p><p>Haven&apos;t heard enough Miles Davis to know.

Just last week heard Carla Bley - it&apos;s been 20 years since she played here - with only a quartet (instead of her usual big band/large ensembles), and it was as good as sounds in the air get. Conservative? She came out and, in her completely dorky (and disarming) way, announced &quot;Tonight won&apos;t be any different from any other night. We&apos;ll start with the National Anthem&quot;.

And<br/>all his symphonies.  And ultra-hard-to-get recordings of his string<br/>quartets.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;On the other end of things, the sparser end, I can only listen to much<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;minimalism for so long, than I get sleepy.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s an interesting question... what is minimal?  Is trance (as in,<br/>&gt;&gt; the techno subgenre) minimal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, I love things like Aphex Twin. It&apos;s so good, it becomes compositional.<br/>&gt;Most of that type of thing seems kind of trashy to me, though.</p><p>I am pretty blown-away by some of the cutting edge electronica I&apos;ve<br/>heard.  You NYers, check out Brian Charrette for one... incredible<br/>musician with an incredible range... everything from Jazz-infused<br/>Drums &apos;n Bass to straight ahead jazz (but with a twist).

See my response re:Sibelius elsewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; New-agey?</p><p>That&apos;s not the word I would use to describe Sibelius one whit. What have you<br/>actually heard really well? Listen to &apos;Tapiola&apos;, close your eyes as you do<br/>so, and tell me that that is not the most magical piece of music. The<br/>transcendent depth of it is astounding....how could you even say &apos;New Age&apos; so<br/>glibly? Yanni is &apos;New Age&apos;. Sibelius is just a Scandanavian musical Buddha.</p><p>It takes a bit to dig into what he has done, but it is well known that<br/>underneath his music&apos;s rare and ethereal beauty and originality lies some of<br/>the most sophisticated sense of musical form to have emerged from any<br/>composer at any time, period. Nothing in Sibelius&apos; finest work is at all<br/>superficial, hence the problem many have relating to it: you have to go into<br/>it, enter its world fully.</p><p>He was subtle, and didn&apos;t put his music into pre-defined formal molds such as<br/>sonata form without a whole lot of organic feeling-out. In this way as a<br/>formal innovator he perhaps even surpasses Beethoven, who was no slouch at<br/>the same thing. One could spend hours studying the subtle stuff going on in<br/>any of his works. Analysis of &apos;Tapiola&apos; reveals that the entire length of it<br/>is organically derived from the opening couple of measures. It never even<br/>leaves B minor, but still creates a vast and magnificent canvas. There are<br/>harmonies in there that are so original and alien to anything else that was<br/>happening in Europe at the time. Furthermore, he had the good sense not to go<br/>into megomaniacal proportions and length, like some other Germanic composers<br/>who shall remain nameless, but instead, stuck to saying what needed to be<br/>said with concision, without sacrificing a sense of cosmic time.</p><p>That having been said, he *did* write some trite salon-type pieces, and some<br/>of his earlier tone poems don&apos;t do it for me. But his best music ranks up<br/>there with anything by anyone else, and puts him in the top drawer of all<br/>composers ever for me. I could live without Stravinsky on a desert isle for<br/>sure, if I could keep Sibelius.</p><p>Brilliant composer, one of my favorite spirits that the Earth ever produced.</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=10491 href="#10491">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2005 1:29:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sunday 25 September 2005 1:06 pm, Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; AKJ,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;On Saturday 24 September 2005 7:31 pm, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Debussy I like less because it just sounds like sassy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pop-tune arrangements, but I recognize that he was a good composer and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably his stuff is fairly efficient also.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What Debussy could you possibly be referring to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, my word, he certainly has never heard &quot;La Mer&quot;.

It appears all you&apos;ve been listening to<br/>&gt; are the young lion artists that only the record companies promote (from<br/>&gt; Wynton on down). I go to hear as much live as I can, and continue to be<br/>&gt; inspired by not only the language but the skillful artistry of a great<br/>&gt; improvisor, something most classical &apos;performers&apos; should give their<br/>&gt; eye-teeth for. Just last week heard Carla Bley - it&apos;s been 20 years since<br/>&gt; she played here - with only a quartet (instead of her usual big band/large<br/>&gt; ensembles), and it was as good as sounds in the air get. Conservative? She<br/>&gt; came out and, in her completely dorky (and disarming) way, announced<br/>&gt; &quot;Tonight won&apos;t be any different from any other night. We&apos;ll start with the<br/>&gt; National Anthem&quot;. Pause. &quot;It is in seven movements.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then followed a suite, with motifs taken from fragments of the melody and<br/>&gt; harmony and then completely turned inside out. Recognizable, but not. And a<br/>&gt; rather big gamble to start, as this wasn&apos;t easy listening. Ended in a<br/>&gt; stroke of brilliance on solo piano, and brought down the house. It went up<br/>&gt; from there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could be wrong, but at least your written comments give as short a shrift<br/>&gt; to the challenging and talented jazz artists of today as Carl&apos;s did to the<br/>&gt; music of Debussy. Oh well, that&apos;s why mileages vary...</p><p>Well, in my defense, I do love *some* jazz artists immensely: Oscar Peterson,<br/>Monk, Coltrane, Brad Meldau, Tatum, Stan Getz.</p><p>What I should say is that these days, I don&apos;t find myself in the mood to<br/>listen to a lot of jazz, period.

I had the complete symphonies, which felt<br/>&gt;&gt; like, if I played them on a DX-7 I could sell it to Windham Hill.<br/>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I was a 19-year-old little snot at the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Playing anything on a DX-7 is pretty lame.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I can agree with that.</p><p>&gt;Are we to judge music by how well it comes off on a DX-7?</p><p>I judge music on a 3-dimensional scale: notes, performance, and<br/>intent.  The composer (in the classical sense) is only in complete<br/>control of the first, but retains a majority holding in the last<br/>and a contribution to the middle one as far as specifying<br/>instrumentation.  Debussy didn&apos;t specify a DX-7, so the idea *is*<br/>a bit unfair, but as far as notes alone go... one of the only ways<br/>to assess notes *is to imagine a transcription*.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10500 href="#10500">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/25/2005 5:57:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;Are we to judge music by how well it comes off on a DX-7?<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I judge music on a 3-dimensional scale: notes, performance, and<br/>&gt;intent.  &gt;</p><p>At least no one will call Carl one dimensional.</p><p>--</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3><a id=10501 href="#10501">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2005 7:31:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt; Yahya,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;Seconded!  I may have mentioned before that I&apos;m also partial to Bollywood<br/>&gt; &gt;music.  While much of it is overblown, some of it is way up there with<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;best of classical Indian music for the skill of the artists in setting a<br/>&gt; &gt;beautiful melody simply.  When combined with the power and beauty of a<br/>&gt; &gt;voice like Lata Mangeshkar&apos;s, the result is as good as it gets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you recommend a couple of recordings, or maybe a site to do some<br/>&gt; exploration? This is one of those very large musical worlds (and film,<br/>&gt; obviously) that I am at a point of almost complete ignorance. What little<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve heard has certainly seemed like there must be some very cool stuff,<br/>&gt; but I am overwhelmed.</p><p>Please forgive me; the only recordings I have are now decades old, on<br/>reel-to-reel tape (transcribed for me by friends in Malaysia in the early<br/>70s, when I first lived there) and I haven&apos;t looked for any since, certainly<br/> not on the net.  Tho I did happen across a stall selling Indian CDs in a<br/>market some years ago, and bought one on spec, called Best of &apos;96 - Sabse<br/>Badkar - which was definitely not up to the standard I remembered;<br/>partly, I think, due to the CD being a low-quality pirate copy, despite its<br/>apparently good packaging.</p><p>What I would suggest, tho, is to take your musical sensibilities with you<br/>and go visit your nearest Indian grocery (food, spices &amp; video) store.  Or<br/>go and watch one or two of the Bollywood films - any of them.  There&apos;s<br/>some dross, of course, but there is also much beauty and power.  If that<br/>is not practical, please bear with me a while until I can the tapes and the<br/>recorder out of storage - it may be in a week or two.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Hmmm ... don&apos;t know Nancarrow - what should I listen to first?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how you would listen to it &apos;first&apos;, that is a hard one. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; guessing you might know that virtually all of his work was for player<br/>&gt; piano, that he developed his own punching machines to create piano rolls<br/>of<br/>&gt; inhuman complexity, allowing for things that there aren&apos;t enough fingers<br/>&gt; (and fingers fast enough) to play.  I don&apos;t know if there are small<br/>&gt; collections of his recordings, as I until recently only had an old<br/>&gt; double-LP of some of the pieces, but in the last couple of years Wergo<br/>&gt; released a box set of all the player piano music with very deep and<br/>&gt; extensive notes by James Tenney:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/79tav">http://tinyurl.com/79tav</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can also get a good start on the composer by seeing Kyle Gann&apos;s page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.kylegann.com/index2.html">http://www.kylegann.com/index2.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Thanks for this information!

What I&apos;ve heard of his works simply didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; hold my attention.  I guess I could say that his music seems rather<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious.  In fact, I&apos;d label it &quot;wallpaper music&quot; - it&apos;s impossible to<br/>&gt; &gt; keep one&apos;s attention on it, and as it fades in to the background,<br/>&gt; &gt; one finds onself looking around for someone to strike up a REAL<br/>&gt; &gt; conversation with.  Of course, I could be entirely wrong!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my opinion, you are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sibelius&apos; true inspiration is nature, in particular the nature of Northern<br/>&gt; Scandanavia. If you are in bliss on a mountain hike, or in the winter<br/>forest,<br/>&gt; you &apos;get&apos; Sibelius, because he conjures up that non-human world so<br/>&gt; beautifully. It is music by and of solitude. I don&apos;t think one can say<br/>that<br/>&gt; any other composer&apos;s music is so in tune with the idea of northern<br/>wilderness<br/>&gt; as Sibelius&apos;.</p><p>Thank you for the correction.</p><p>&gt; Of course, I&apos;m Scandanavian-American, maybe it&apos;s genetic! ;) What can I<br/>&gt; say? I agree with Glenn Gould when he says &quot;I couldn&apos;t go on living with<br/>&gt; Sibelius&apos; 5th symphony&quot;.
