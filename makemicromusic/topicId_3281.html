I just used their online form to inquire about the microtonal support in FM7, in particular about whether it at least supported TX-802/DX-7II type tuning tables &amp; resolution. I got a reply the next day from Daniel Richter            , Native Instruments Online Marketing Assistant, saying that the FM7 did support microtunings to a &quot;high resolution&quot; and that I should try the demo.</p><p>By this time I&apos;d found out it only supported 12 note tunings, and I&apos;d seen that there&apos;s been previous communication between members of this list &amp; NI regarding implementation of the MIDI Tuning Standard. So, I responded by letting him know about this and that besides considering implementing the MIDI Tuning Standard, FM7 should be able to import &amp; implement tuning tables that exist in Yamaha&apos;s SY, DX, &amp; TX machines, which I pointed out were still very much in use by microtonalists &amp; others.</p><p>I also pointed him to this list &amp; the Tuning list as places to find people who are seriously interested in this sort of thing.</p><p>Daniel replied thanking me for my input. So, the more voices that they hear asking for this kind of support, the better the chances they&apos;ll make the effort.</p><p>So, give it a shot, go to <a href="http://www.native-instruments.de">http://www.native-instruments.de</a> &amp; send them a message using the feedback form.</p><p>I don&apos;t think sample-playback synths are good for microtonality, which (I believe) by it&apos;s nature requires pure synthesis - FM, additive, physical modeling, analog, whatever. My perception is that it&apos;s purer from fundamental to overtones. Sounds that are born at their designated pitch behave more realistically, like actual acoustic instruments, which is a good thing if you happen to write for acoustic instruments. I&apos;m speaking from an end-user, low-technical-speak threshold, just-want-to-turn-it-on-and-make-music point of view.</p><p>While I&apos;m at it, just want to let any French footie fans on the list know I still have my fingers crossed. Of course the fingers on my other hand are crossed for Portugal. You never know... Ooh, Germany just made 8-0...!!!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

If you go back through the archives I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find some of the conversations, including those from someone in development with NI.</p><p>One other thing:</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think sample-playback synths are good for microtonality, which (I &gt;believe) by it&apos;s nature requires pure synthesis - FM, additive, physical &gt;modeling, analog, whatever. My perception is that it&apos;s purer from &gt;fundamental to overtones.</p><p>While &apos;pure&apos; synthesis solves some of the problems you mention, I think you need to open up to the wide possibilities of music that can be done microtonally. And I say that specifically because we&apos;ve had examples from people on this list that extensively use samples, both for emulation of real instruments (Prent Rodgers) and for morphing into new territories (Bill Sethares / Jacky Ligon) and everything in between.</p><p>They are all tools, and some may require more work, but in the right hands music will occur.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
