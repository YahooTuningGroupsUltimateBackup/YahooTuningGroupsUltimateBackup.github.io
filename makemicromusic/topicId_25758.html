Yes, 24--it&apos;s an awesome 2.3.11 subgroup with some interesting 13 implications, and it&apos;s got two of my favorite xenharmonic MOS scales: 0-200-350-500-700-850-1050-1200 &quot;Mohajira-ish&quot; 3L+4s, and 0-200-250-450-500-700-750-950-1000-1200 &quot;Island&quot; or something, 5L+4s.  I&apos;m contemplating going for 24 at some point soon, too, just because there&apos;s so much nasty quartertone music out there and it&apos;s high time someone attempted to do something accessible and xenharmonic with it.  Or, if you&apos;re feeling really adventurous and are ready to get away from a near-pure 3/2, I&apos;d say 15 and 18 are the strongest contenders.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve heard you do anything in 15, so you should try it out first, but I really liked that one piano piece you did in 18.  Some time in the next few months, I&apos;m gonna get in touch with the guy who did your 17 refret and send him a guitar to convert to 18 for me.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think what I&apos;m going to do is ask Brad to make this into a neck to replace<br/>&gt; the neck on the fretless squire.

I probably would&apos;ve gone ahead and had the work done anyway, because sending the neck back to Maine, waiting for it to get fixed and then mailed back would probably have taken forever.  But it&apos;s good to know he stands behind his products, and if I lived on the east coast I probably would have taken him up on it.  I suppose it&apos;s possible that the fretwork on the neck was fine when it left the factory, but the temperature changes during shipping may have caused things to go a little out-of-whack.  I know that when I&apos;ve had conversions done by Ron Sword, they&apos;ve arrived in dire need of a setup, despite the fact that he sets them up meticulously before sending them out from Florida.</p><p>So, my final verdict is: Freenote is good to do business with, but if you live on the west coast, it may or may not be a hassle depending on variables beyond Freenote&apos;s control.  I can&apos;t fault the company since they offered to repair or replace for free.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Update:<br/>&gt; So I took the guitar into my repair guy, turns out he has a guy on staff by the name of Benjamin Strange who&apos;s actually into microtonality and he knew exactly what was up with the neck (so that saved me the &quot;why are there so many frets?&quot; spiel).
