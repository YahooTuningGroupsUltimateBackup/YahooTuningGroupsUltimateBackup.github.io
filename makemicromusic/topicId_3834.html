Here one<br/>runs into a problem that the sounds are probably based on good<br/>acoustic samples and if you look at them in detail you see many<br/> tiny peaks in the spectrum super-imposed on the main peak - common<br/>with acoustic instruments. The problem there is that the main<br/>peak may have a tiny peaklet at the top offset to one side of the<br/>centre - so the highest point may not be quite the perceived pitch<br/>(it is only a tiny bit higher, a very minute peaklet). In fact it<br/>has dozens of those on top and to either side. So which do you<br/>take as the pitch of the partial - or do you try and find the pitch<br/>of the main peak instead (which seems best).</p><p>I use a mean value method in FTS to deal with this situation<br/>- find the sum of the products of teh amplitudes with the<br/>frequencies over a region within say ten percent from the<br/>peak to either side - and divide by the sum of all the<br/>amplitudes to get the mean frequency (just like finding the<br/>mean of a population in statistics). Works quite well<br/>- suitable if the peak isn&apos;t too asymmetric.</p><p>The Roland also has a recorder voice that has very<br/>clear isolated partials, and that was easier to<br/>measure.</p><p>General concluson from testing several instruments in this way<br/>is that it seems to be accurate to within less than a cent.</p><p>This was my measurement for the recorder (preliminary):<br/>0.0          386.714842   702.75635<br/>for just intonation triad, one minute sample.</p><p>Also, the different voices seem to be accurately pitched<br/>to within a cent of middle C - that is nice because<br/>in the SB Live, different instruments, or<br/>even different samples of the same instrument often<br/>vary by two or three cents to either side of concert<br/>pitch. May just be a matter of the amount of care taken<br/>with the pitch of the original samples - I think that is what<br/>it is - and could be fixed with the SB LIve! by retuning the<br/>samples in the sound font.</p><p>Hard to say whehter it is more accurate than that<br/>because of the complexity of acoustic sounds,<br/>maybe not. Certainly not as clear cut a situation<br/>as the FM7 which is probably accurate to within the limitations<br/>of single precision floating point arithmetic (got quite close<br/>to that with a one minute recording)<br/>(which is pretty fine compared with normal<br/>human hearing pitch discrimination).</p><p>Some other comments:</p><p>One thing the Yamaha has which the Roland doesn&apos;t is that<br/>it has true monophonic legato where the repeated notes of the trill don&apos;t<br/>re-trigger the attack - only get the attack at the start, then<br/> overlapping notes are played true legato. You get that by setting the<br/>portamento slide to 0 in combination with legato monphonic.</p><p>The  Roland has portamento too - but always with attack at the start of<br/>the slide.</p><p>The Yamaha also has a very slight hiss accompaniment<br/>to all the instruments (which you only hear while they are playing,<br/>most noticeable during decay of a quiet plucked sound - stops<br/>just after the sound has finished dying away to silence) - while the<br/>Roland doesn&apos;t have this at all as far as I can hear.</p><p>The Roland I think also needs a slightly faster computer than the Yamaha.</p><p>Nice quality sound. Well, the recorder doesn&apos;t sound much like<br/>a recorder to me - but one is always more critical of ones<br/>own instrument. Come to think of it, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever<br/>heard a satisfactory midi recorder (haven&apos;t tried it with Giga which<br/>might be reasonable I expect), though other instruments often seem<br/>quite passable to me.</p><p>The other instruments sound pretty good to me so I think you should<br/>ignore that as the bias of a player who will never be satisfied<br/>with a wave table version of his own instrument.</p><p>Certainly as good as many wave table synths anyway.</p><p>Also you can save the midi files directly to waveform audio -<br/>though I&apos;m not able to test this as I haven&apos;t<br/>bought it yet, and you need to buy it to use this feature.<br/>But at $20 it seems a pretty good buy and I&apos;ll almost<br/>certainly get it for myself, and am also recommending<br/>it for FTS users who need a soft synth in order to<br/>hear the tunes.</p><p>At present still in the 30 day trial period, but I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure I&apos;ll buy it at the end of that time (or maybe<br/>before if I need the midi to audio conversion).</p><p><a href="http://www.edirol.com.au/downloads.asp">http://www.edirol.com.au/downloads.asp</a></p><p>General conclusion - a nice wave table soft synth<br/>to have on ones out menu!!</p><p>:-).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
