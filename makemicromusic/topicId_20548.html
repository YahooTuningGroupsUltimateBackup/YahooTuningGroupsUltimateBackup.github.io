This would give best results,<br/>but then there has to be a processor for MIDI input to<br/>route to the channels, and if you&apos;re going to have one of<br/>those, you might as well go with pitch bending per channel<br/>since that always gets the best sample and it also gives<br/>output in a from that is GM compatible (if you stick to<br/>16 channels and give an option for percussion 10), whereas<br/>this new crazy multi-channel Fluid method would be<br/>Fluid-only compatible.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other (if you use Csound) would be to<br/>&gt; write a complex instrument in Csound using<br/>&gt; midi opcodes that would basically have conditional<br/>&gt; statements thatwould pick samples.

The<br/>&gt;&gt; demo has no date expiration, so you can get a good idea of<br/>&gt;&gt; whether scripting will fit your purpose before plunking down cash.<br/>&gt;&gt; - Robert<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2009 12:47:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi (other) Aaron,</p><p>One more thing--I think the old (deprecated) soundfont opcodes<br/>in Csound can take an arbitrary cps or oct or midinotenumber from a .sco or .csd p-field value and automagically use the correct sample within the standard MIDI note number value...i.e. the opcode sfplay I think will determine that the pitch being requested is usually handled by a certain sample under normal 12-equal usage, and will use that sample if a close-enough pitch is requested.</p><p>This might make using Csound as a soundfont engine more attractive as opposed to FluidSynth. However, for live realtime-MIDI, I think FluidSynth is more robust, and handles sustain pedal messages without dropouts and meltdowns much better, in my experience.</p><p>For non-realtime, though, I would go with using Csound for it&apos;s generality and flexibility here.</p><p>Best,<br/>the other Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a question for anyone here using Kontakt scripts<br/>&gt; to retune sample libraries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you retune in Kontakt using the scripts, does<br/>&gt; Kontakt choose the closest sample for each pitch, or does<br/>&gt; it just take whatever sample is there for the normal MIDI<br/>&gt; note and bend it to the pitch you have programmed for<br/>&gt; that MIDI note?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously the former gives best results while the latter<br/>&gt; sounds terrible unless you are just tweaking a 12 tone<br/>&gt; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been recently fiddling with the FluidSynth API<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://fluidsynth.resonance.org/trac">http://fluidsynth.resonance.org/trac</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; and discovered that FluidSynth uses the latter method to<br/>&gt; realize their non-standard tuning tables, so everything<br/>&gt; sounds terrible unless you are just tweaking a 12 tone<br/>&gt; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have Kontakt, so can&apos;t find this out directly<br/>&gt; for Kontakt (for their also non-standard tuning tables),<br/>&gt; without contacting their tech support, which has not<br/>&gt; proven useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last, has anyone been able to make Gervill work on<br/>&gt; their PC or Mac system?<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://gervill.dev.java.net/">https://gervill.dev.java.net/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unlike FluidSynth which has totally non-standard<br/>&gt; architecture from a MIDI point of view, Gervill is very<br/>&gt; well structured and it implements MTS.
