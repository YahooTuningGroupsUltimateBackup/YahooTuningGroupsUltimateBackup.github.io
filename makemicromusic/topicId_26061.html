After calling your piece &quot;dance music&quot; or something else, you offered this:</p><p>&quot;Secondly, the type of music I make, is NOT dance. Dance is full of simple themes (IE 1 melody or 2 at most), aggressive sharp/punchy synthesized leads, and often 4-on-the-floor beats. I almost always make abstract breakbeats, not 4-on-the-floor, use more organic/less-noisy/more-legato sounding instruments, and have at least 4 melodic themes. Maybe you just don&apos;t have much experience in electronica and are jumping to easy stereotypes?</p><p>Anyhow, what I make is much more in-line with &quot;ambient/abstract breakbeat&quot; than dance and many of the solos cross into jazz territory (and jazz is anything but normal in pop/dance style music). You could make a stretch and say it&apos;s IDM, but IDM is nothing like pop/dance music either.&quot;</p><p>And you get upset at making a distinction between a piece of music that has lyrics and a singer, and instrumental music of other configurations? That simply identifying a &quot;song&quot; as it was intended is too much bother, compared to the above in your own work?</p><p>C&apos;mon, man, own it.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2011 6:16:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; C&apos;mon, man, own it.</p><p>You&apos;ve got a point.
