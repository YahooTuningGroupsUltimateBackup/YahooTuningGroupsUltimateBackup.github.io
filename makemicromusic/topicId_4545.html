Do you<br/>remember suggesting I listen out for coach music.<br/>It has rather transformed some of my journeys<br/>into a most pleasurable experience - you never know what<br/>kind of a music it will make.</p><p>Using the good old FM7 for the voice, tweaked<br/>one of them to sound as much as I could make it<br/>coach sounds. But you need to imagine really a<br/>lot of other notes and sounds from the engine<br/>going on as well and this was quite a subtle<br/>effect on top of it, quite quiet and gentle<br/>- it was most beautiful :-).</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll try to do the rest of the noises<br/>though!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
