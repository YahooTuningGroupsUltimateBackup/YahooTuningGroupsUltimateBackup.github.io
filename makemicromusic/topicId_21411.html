The conversation covers a lot of ground, like the fact that he doesn&apos;t consider Delusion of the Fury to be an opera because his musicians are onstage with painted bellies. He sees &apos;opera&apos; as an Italianate term, although he wouldn&apos;t mind being lumped into the same operatic category as Mussorgsky (good man). Partch also says that &apos;according to Bell Laboratories&apos; the average ear can distinguish 600 pitches in an octave.</p><p>The interviewer also meets Partch at the theater where Delusion of the Fury is being premiered and catches the horrendous collapse of a kithara on tape, which brings the interview to an end.&quot;</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div><h3><a id=21414 href="#21414">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2009 8:41:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Prent,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;prentrodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;A Closet of Curiosity posted an interesting interview with Harry Partch.</p><p>... which is from the CD that accompanies the book &quot;Harry Partch: An anthology of critical perspectives&quot;, ed.
