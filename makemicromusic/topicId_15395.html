One is to borrow a resonator -- set your instrument on a table or cabinet or any other resonant object with a cavity.  Ceramic vases can make great Helmholz resonators (the Javanese gong komodong uses a ceramic pot, often reinforced with cement; Alvin Lucier does amazing things with microphones place in sympathetically resonating vases).

(Or for a private concert, suspend the grill by two pieces of string or cord, wrapping the loose ends around a finger on each hand. Place the fingertips in your ears and then strike the grill.)</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2006 7:21:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Magnus Jonsson &lt;magnus@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some qustions for those of you who build your own instruments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes I play with making stupid string instruments from various<br/>&gt; household items in my house... but they all lack loudness.
