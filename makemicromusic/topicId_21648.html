Split Notes is an online label, digital releases only, of free microtonal music.</p><p>The album has an open submission. Composers of all kinds are encouraged to submit a track or song (or as many as you like) to be considered for inclusion on the compilation. We&apos;ll try to be as inclusive as possible, and of course &quot;popular music genre&quot; is a relaxed-enough restriction that we can get a good variety of music going.</p><p>Once made, the album will be released and be spread far and wide across the &apos;nets. If you share the same view as I do, which is that microtonal music deserves to be on more people&apos;s ipods, then I&apos;m eager to collaborate with you. Please consider getting involved! :)</p><p>All the details for submission are at the following web page: <a href="http://split-notes.com/compilation2010.php">http://split-notes.com/compilation2010.php</a><br/>The final deadline is April 30th.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Sean</p></div>
