I also got N5 sysex messages and I learned how to<br/>tune it by it and use it in a midi file. But it still seems kind of<br/>complicated, and too much work.</p><p>Thaks a lot, yes, I set it to 108 and it work, now I gotta learn more<br/>on jow to use this limitation, is it too much of a limitation or is<br/>it ok to work with 12 notes tuning tables on Scala?</p><p>anyway, I guess I gotta learn how to work with the<br/>keyboard mapping, that&apos;s what I&apos;m trying to do now...</p><p>I wasn&apos;t able to use the set adjustment command, I didn&apos;t get it, on<br/>the help file it direct me to other settings as show mapping, and set<br/>middle, and set map_freq. I didn&apos;t get how this helps me keeping<br/>inside my detuning limitation, damn. Actually it was confusing, it<br/>sounded like if I change this things around I could expand my limits,<br/>is it?</p><p>Oh Yes, I read something on the N5 manual that said that<br/>RPN messages could detune a note in a range of -100 to<br/>+100 cents. That&apos;s gotta be better than the -63 +63<br/>SysEx range. But I&apos;ve just NEVER heard about RPN<br/>messages and I did&apos;nt find any information on it, is<br/>it easier to work than with SysEx messages?</p><p>Well, so if you can help me a bit more or redirect me somewhere, or<br/>even if you can&apos;t that&apos;s ok.

It&apos;s not so complicated. For example you have a note<br/>which is +80 cents from ET, then the &quot;set adjustment&quot; command will<br/>move C (and all other notes) down a bit, let&apos;s say -20 cents, and<br/>then the other note will be +60 cents, so within range.<br/>So this will change the pitch of all notes. If you need a<br/>specific pitch, then you have to set the master frequency on the<br/>N5 by hand, taking the Scala C offset into account.</p><p>&gt;Oh Yes, I read something on the N5 manual that said that<br/>&gt;RPN messages could detune a note in a range of -100 to<br/>&gt;+100 cents.</p><p>I didn&apos;t get that impression. I only see that detuning for the<br/>OSC1 frequency. Hadn&apos;t heard about RPN messages too.</p><p>You can best study the keyboard mapping by choosing<br/>Edit mapping in the Edit menu.<br/>Good luck,</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=3679 href="#3679">ðŸ”—</a>Eric Viking &#x3C;decuritiba@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2002 11:08:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow, that&apos;s been helpful, if you can&apos;t help me any<br/>longer that&apos;s good enough for me, I finally got out of<br/>the limb and could start retuning the N5! :)</p><p>&gt; &gt;it ok to work with 12 notes tuning tables on Scala?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, you can work with scales of 12 notes and less.</p><p>Yeah, sorry, that was a bit stupid, but that&apos;s the<br/>begginer&apos;s life, that can be limiting, I can take<br/>limits for now, but if I feel like getting into it for<br/>real that&apos;ll be a problem in a while...</p><p>Do you know how I can find out wich ones of those<br/>synths on the synth list are capable of full keyboard<br/>tunning? Or how can I find out if a particular synth<br/>or midi controler that&apos;s not on that list can do it?</p><p>&gt; Sorry. It&apos;s not so complicated. For example you have<br/>&gt; a note<br/>&gt; which is +80 cents from ET, then the &quot;set<br/>&gt; adjustment&quot; command will<br/>&gt; move C (and all other notes) down a bit, let&apos;s say<br/>&gt; -20 cents, and<br/>&gt; then the other note will be +60 cents, so within<br/>&gt; range.</p><p>yeah, great, i had a scale and one note was supposed<br/>to be detuned -80 cents, then I realized it didn&apos;t<br/>detune at all cause it was out the range, after<br/>setting the adjustment it retuned.</p><p>&gt; So this will change the pitch of all notes. If you<br/>&gt; need a<br/>&gt; specific pitch, then you have to set the master<br/>&gt; frequency on the<br/>&gt; N5 by hand, taking the Scala C offset into account.</p><p>Now I noticed that ( C ) the first step of the scale,<br/>(and all the others) were de-tuned a bit, so you mean<br/>that I have to change the fine tuning on N5 to<br/>compensate the Scala C offset, right? But how can I<br/>precisely do that?</p><p>&gt; Good luck,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel</p><p>thanks, best for you too lad.<br/>cheers<br/>alex</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
