During that time the<br/>environment changed (wind, rain, sleet, snow) and I changed the tuning of<br/>the harp. The project is unfinished actually. I got to the point where I<br/>questioned if the relatively short segments was really giving the listener<br/>the experience I have when I put in the ear buds and listen to my harp<br/>live. So, I&apos;m working on a better presentation of a collection of DIY<br/>electric aeolian harp recordings. *Warning!! This has a very large dynamic<br/>range!!*</p></div>
