But &quot;edo&quot; is<br/>just a little acronym for Equal Division of the Octave that I coined<br/>back in the late 1990s because I started using tunings like 11 and 13-<br/>tone equal temperament, tunings that were so far removed from common<br/>practice that they could hardly really be seen as having anything to<br/>do with temperament in the true historical and practical sense. So<br/>EDO is just a synonym for the acronym TET (tone equal temperament, as<br/>in 12-tone equal temperament, or 12-tet) that I thought was more in<br/>line with what I was doing with these tunings at the timethat is<br/>taking them at face value with no meaningful attachment to the common<br/>practice, tempered past. To my surprise this term EDO seemed to<br/>resonate with the community (cult) , and has since taken on a life of<br/>its own.</p><p>When I say &quot;NON-just/octave/equal tuning&quot; I simply mean that these<br/>pieces use a tuning that is neither Just Intonated, an equal division<br/>of a given periodicity (like the octave or the twelfth, etc), or even<br/>tunings with octaves. That might sound awfully convoluted or whatnot,<br/>but all of those particular tunings I came about empirically by<br/>improvising with the fretless guitar and making notes of the tunings<br/>and preferences as I did so. Then I flew these tunings over to a<br/>tuning table and composed music rather intuitively with them. So it<br/>might sound complex or academic or even silly, but it was really a<br/>quite simple, if unusual, process.</p><p>&quot;overtone series 10 and 14&quot; means that the tuning is based on these<br/>two overtone series:</p><p>10:11:12:13:14:15:16:17:18:19:20<br/>1/1, 11/10, 6/5, 13/10, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 17/10, 9/5, 19/10, 2/1</p><p>14:15:16:17:18:19:20:21:22:23:24:25:26:27:28<br/>1/1, 15/14, 8/7, 17/14, 9/7, 19/14, 10/7, 3/2, 11/7, 23/14, 12/7,<br/>25/14, 13/7, 27/14, 2/1</p><p>So I combined these two series and mapped them to two octaves on the<br/>keyboard.</p><p>By &quot;real-time adjustable intonation&quot; I mean that these pieces (and<br/>these interestingly enough for anybody here, are jazz pieces) use<br/>four turntables and two separate recordings. So the turntables are<br/>set in pairs and each pair has the same record as its paired partner,<br/>yet each pair&apos;s recording is unrelated. By using the pitch knob in a<br/>manner somewhat analogous to a dimmer switch, each pair tries to keep<br/>their recording synched to the other pairs, as well as their<br/>partners! And this requires a constant gradual sharpening and<br/>flattening of the recording resulting in a real-time adjustable<br/>intonation.</p><p>By &quot;free intonation&quot; I mean intonation without predetermined theory<br/>or design, and here that refers to two things, 1) pieces for<br/>instruments (like the trombone or the violin or the human voice, etc)<br/>without fixed pitch, and 2) pieces featuring little modest homemade<br/>instruments with an intonation of their own unfortunate construction!</p><p>Performance is another thing altogether, and in some ways<br/>microtonality forces a lot of its practitioners off to islands of<br/>their own design .There are performers and organizations that<br/>specialize in just this very thing, the AFMM (American festival of<br/>microtonal music) being the most accomplished and varied proponent ,<br/>but I myself have been involved in microtonality for almost 20 years<br/>now and have never had any performance or recording where I wasn&apos;t<br/>either doing it all myself or training ,bribing, coercing and begging<br/>others to at least have a look and a listen</p><p>Thanks again, Dan</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2006 11:07:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To my surprise this term EDO seemed to<br/>&gt; resonate with the community (cult) , and has since taken on a life of<br/>&gt; its own.</p><p>It turns out to be a useful term in tuning theory, since an edo does<br/>not claim to be a temperament, whereas an tet/et does.</p></div><h3>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2006 2:04:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 4/26/06, Gene Ward Smith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To my surprise this term EDO seemed to<br/>&gt; &gt; resonate with the community (cult) , and has since taken on a life of<br/>&gt; &gt; its own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It turns out to be a useful term in tuning theory, since an edo does<br/>&gt; not claim to be a temperament, whereas an tet/et does.</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking about this distinction a lot lately.

I&apos;ve always connected temperament with the term temper, as in to temper the intervals of a given tuning to accomplish some goal. One tempers intervals from Pythagorian or just intonation to spread them out equally over 12 half-steps to avoid wolves and play in all keys (assumedly) equally well. In this instance, the tempering - or alteration of existing intervals - is what generates the temperament.</p><p>When I think of 5 EDO, I&apos;m not considering those 5 pitches in relation to anything else but the octave, and that they are simply splitting the interval of an octave into 5 equal parts.</p><p>The philosophical point to this, I suppose, it to look at an EDO as conceptually and aesthetically different from a scale that is, a priori, tempered for a purpose. EDOs seem more &quot;blank slate&quot; to me.</p><p>Then again, this is all pretty hilarious, since I tend to avoid EDO tunings and composing (but not necessarily other people&apos;s music) like the plague! Just my personal choice, but I believe very strongly that in the making of music - as in the making of any artistic creation - the choice of initial materials is not only very important, but can have very personal and philosophical relevance.

I&apos;ve always connected temperament with the term temper, as in to temper the intervals of a given tuning to accomplish some goal. One tempers intervals from Pythagorian or just intonation to spread them out equally over 12 half-steps to avoid wolves and play in all keys (assumedly) equally well. In this instance, the tempering - or alteration of existing intervals - is what generates the temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I think of 5 EDO, I&apos;m not considering those 5 pitches in relation to anything else but the octave, and that they are simply splitting the interval of an octave into 5 equal parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The philosophical point to this, I suppose, it to look at an EDO as conceptually and aesthetically different from a scale that is, a priori, tempered for a purpose. EDOs seem more &quot;blank slate&quot; to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then again, this is all pretty hilarious, since I tend to avoid EDO tunings and composing (but not necessarily other people&apos;s music) like the plague! Just my personal choice, but I believe very strongly that in the making of music - as in the making of any artistic creation - the choice of initial materials is not only very important, but can have very personal and philosophical relevance. This is one area where I diverge completely from those who would measure an intonation and say &quot;but you could just as well...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I couldn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!

But<br/>&gt;I&apos;m still curious if the distinction I&apos;ve drawn, as what I understand<br/>&gt;from others, is essentially accurate. That is, the difference between<br/>&gt;something that is tempered and something that is merely divided<br/>&gt;equally without context.</p><p>Yes, I think there&apos;s a valid distinction there.  One could argue that<br/>everything is a temperament, no matter how bad.  But 11, while a fairly<br/>bad temperament, could be a great EDO.  As as I think atonal serial<br/>music shows, even the best temperaments can be bad EDOs!  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
