This is<br/>&gt;something I&apos;ve worked very little with but I know it&apos;s an important<br/>&gt;tool.<br/>&gt;Can you help out a Brother with some guidelines and suggestions about<br/>&gt;using this? Been wanting to ask you for a while.</p><p>I do not use multiband compression very often. I fiddled around with the C4, but preferred to not use it for much as I received better results elsewhere (without multiband compression). You can think of it as having dynamic control on separate bands of the audio whereas a normal compressor controls wideband dynamics. For electronic oriented music you can use it as a creative device; otherwise I would place multiband compression under the band aid category.</p><p>The cool thing with it is that if you just want to compress or expand one band you can do that without effecting the others. If you have some material that is too boomy in the bass (bad dance mixes from those that don&apos;t have good monitoring) you can compress just the bass and leave the rest untouched. Or if you have a strong peak in particular area that is tripping your limiter then you can target that one area and tame the peak. It can be very useful if you an FFT plugin running so you can get some sort of visual reference. You can also use it for band specific expansion and &quot;uncompress&quot; over compressed material. I have never tried this, but this would definitely fall in the band aid category.</p><p>Essentially the big thing with this new Waves plugin is that it eliminates phase inconsistencies that occured at the crossover points in the C4.</p><p>Similar deal with the linear phase EQ; that the delay incurred is equal across the whole spectrum and you don&apos;t have a change in phase that other EQs add; then again that might be a very big source of the character of an EQ! ;) I still need a better monitoring environment to pick up on most of this stuff..</p><p>The user manual is very informative and will really clear things up in regard to using multiband compression; then there is always loading it up and just using it and learning by ear.</p><p>&gt;This was *really* interesting. I got it to work, and recorded in a<br/>piece with a cello line and another line with Just Intonation sounds<br/>that I didn&apos;t want reverbed. The cello *had* some reverb.</p><p>Awesome! Samplitude was the first audio editor that I came across that absolutely blew me away in terms of the interface, ease of use, and high quality functionality. Apparently Sequoia from Magix is Samplitude and then some in regard to a post production tool. I believe they are coming out with version 6 of Sequoia very soon. Also, I read that Steinberg remodeled their interface for Wavelab 4 to look and respond like Samplitude, so that says a lot.</p><p>Several mastering engineers use Samplitude and the &quot;tricks&quot; that I mentioned a month ago or so, should be applicable, but I haven&apos;t tested them in anything besides Nuendo.</p><p>Check out that Mastering bundle and apply the L2 to your mix and you will be shocked at how much it really boost the volume.</p><p>&gt;How subtle! And it made me a nice stereo wave file of the combined.<br/>It didn&apos;t seem too difficult to get things to &quot;line up&quot; either,<br/>although that might take a little practice in certain circumstances.</p><p>A little trick especially since you are using a midi rig is to place a sound with a sharp attack (drum) at the beginning of the recording and then shift all of you other material over a bar. That way every line that you record into the computer will have the intro drum hit which will allow you to line up all of your tracks without having to give it a second thought. Then once you have everything recorded and lined up you can delete that first bar.</p><p>Also now that you are recording each line individually to record each line at maximum volume into the computer then mix down or apply that limiting trick.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>I am going to stick around until I can get word on possible tools for modifying midi tuning files, but I am getting hammered right now in a chemistry class (second in a series where I took the first class 3 years ago; doh! My degree requirement was recently changed where I could take the remaining two chem course or take 3 in physics) I live in a perpetual Charlie Brown episode where the professor basically says, &quot;Wonh wonh, waaanh (repeat indefinitely)&quot;. ;)</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
