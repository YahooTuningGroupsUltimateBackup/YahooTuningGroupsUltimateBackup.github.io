Johnson &#x3C;akjmicro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2004 12:26:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MMM friends,</p><p>Since Bill has so kindly written up my &apos;Divide by Pi&apos; effort with Andy<br/>Hasenpflug, I thought I would return the favor by reviewing both of his<br/>recorded CD&apos;s, first &apos;Xentonality&apos;, then &apos;Exomusicology&apos; in another post on<br/>some later date....many of you (the majority I&apos;m sure) are familiar with<br/>Bill&apos;s seminal works already, and they rightly stand as important landmarks<br/>in the specific study of how tuning and timbre are intimately related.</p><p>Briefly, my first encounter with Bill&apos;s music was through the internet via<br/>John Starrett&apos;s site about important microtonal composers and links to info<br/>and musicians in the microtonal scene. I remember the delight upon finding a<br/>sample of &apos;The Turquoise Dabo Girl&apos;, enjoying the strange futuristic sound of<br/>a world that for me conjured Kubrick&apos;s plastic nightmare world of the &apos;Milk<br/>Bar&apos; in &apos;A Clockwork Orange&apos;.</p><p>Speaking of &apos;Clockwork Orange&apos;, where Bill Sethares is not yet the razor-sharp<br/>producer/composer the likes of a Wendy Carlos, (how many mortals are?, and<br/>bear in mind I still have to hear most of the 2nd disc, &apos;Exomusicology&apos;) the<br/>best tunes are quite strong indeed, and he makes up for what I feel are the<br/>weaker parts with a very studied encyclopedic survey of various tunings, and<br/>more specifically and most importantly, how tuning and timbre should fit<br/>together, a field of expertise in which he is known in these parts as an<br/>undisputed master researcher. In this sense, this is one of the more<br/>important microtonal disks out there, and to top it off, the music at its<br/>best is delightful.</p><p>The &apos;Xentonality&apos; disk is 16 tracks full (yes, a cornucopia !) of what I would<br/>call &apos;etudes&apos;, not in the 19th-century virtuoso-performer sense, but in the<br/>&apos;study&apos; sense, of tuning.  In general, all the tracks are well worth the<br/>hearing, but since there are *16* of them, and I write this review at 1 in<br/>the am, let me briefly describe the ones I felt were standouts for me, (which<br/>were mostly the ones furthest from being modelled on pop style writing--I<br/>reveal my style bias). It *is* impressive what a variety of masks Bill wears<br/>stylistically, not to mention the technical importance of his work in tuning<br/>and timbre.</p><p>We are thrown into the Marrekesh marketplace, I feel, with the opener &apos;Ten<br/>Fingers&apos;, where 10-tet never sounded so harmonious! There is also great use<br/>of stereo field in this track. However, sometimes the performance is a bit<br/>marred by unsimultaneous attacks and loose time, creating a certain<br/>intoxicated looseness of tempo feel. Or was this deliberate? (humanizing<br/>function in a sequencer? -- without details of the production process it&apos;s<br/>hard to tell) This looseness was sometimes noticeable on other tracks as<br/>well.</p><p>&apos;Circle of Thirds&apos; (track 2) is like a 10-tet rotating kaleidescope with a<br/>spacious, almost ominous middle section. It ends abrubtly and delightfully,<br/>and features a kind of portamento synth lead that I&apos;ve since noticed is a<br/>sort of Sethares trademark. &apos;PentaFunk&apos; (not from this album) and &apos;Turquois<br/>Dabo Girl&apos; (from this album) use it.</p><p>My favorite track on the album, &apos;Duet for Morphine and Cymbal&apos; is so vastly<br/>unique in the microtonal recording oeuvre, as well as for this collection,<br/>with it&apos;s eerie organic pulsing and hallucinogenic quality, that it might be<br/>the most important musical statement of all of Bill&apos;s output that I&apos;ve heard.<br/>This to me was pure magic, a deftly and simply conceived work which reminded<br/>me of the best electronic music put on record to date, from the likes of<br/>Morton Subotnick or Tod Dockstader. It definately has a great &apos;retro-sci-fi&apos;<br/>feel, and is very tightly performed as well. The fascinating liner notes<br/>indicate that the timbres are derived from the x-ray diffraction patterns of<br/>a morphine crystal !! Bill, please do an LSD piece for us !!! (or even THC?)</p><p>Ditto the next track &apos;Tingshaw&apos; which was so delightfully and gently metallic,<br/>I listened to it three times in a row. The scale is derived from the tuning<br/>of the bell sample. This track is up there, perhaps next to, the high musical<br/>level of &apos;Duet...&apos; Again, wonderful stereo field and use of percussive drum<br/>elements as well. Here, the timing was not at all marred in the way some of<br/>the other, more pop-oriented tracks were. Bill seems &apos;In his element&apos; or &apos;In<br/>flow&apos; on this and the previous track. There&apos;s also a neat little place where<br/>the music unpredictably stops and restarts it&apos;s momentum. Very delicious...</p><p>A problematic track for me was &apos;Incidence and Coincidence&apos;--it&apos;s starts out as<br/>an innocuous sounding, almost dopey little tune, and then rips into a nice<br/>prog-rock type theme, worthy of King Crimson or Yes, 44 seconds into it. My<br/>problem is I *love* the &apos;heavy&apos; second theme where it occurs, but don&apos;t care<br/>all that much for the surrounding material. Perhaps a track of the &apos;heavy<br/>theme&apos; alone, entitled &apos;Coincidence&apos;, remixed for yours truly? ;) The piece<br/>*does* have a fascinating genesis--the study of how 19-tet and 12-tet can<br/>coexist.</p><p>Two pieces for Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-cent tuning come next, &apos;Haroun in 88&apos; and<br/>&apos;88 vibes&apos;, of which the latter stands out for its fragile, explosive, and<br/>pleasantly glassy vibraphone arpeggios, which flank a stately middle section<br/>reminiscent of a royal processional with a pop music slant.</p><p>&apos;Truth on a Bus&apos; is simply a 19-tet guitar piece--the liner notes allude to Ry<br/>Cooder style, I heard a bit of Leo Kottke&apos;s delicious style in there as well.<br/>Wonderfully simple and moving, and one of the strongest tracks on the record.</p><p>&apos;Imaginary horses&apos;, in a Lou Harrison 5-limit minor hexatonic scale, has a<br/>wonderful disarming simplicity to it, and a good use of &apos;galloping piano&apos;<br/>texture.</p><p>Finally, also one of the top 5 or so tracks for me, the &apos;Turquoise Dabo Girl&apos;<br/>(11-tet) relishes, as I alluded above, the world of the futuristic night-club<br/>perhaps. We seem to swim in a nightmarish room of purple and lavendar with<br/>robotic women waitresses and lava lamps, art deco furniture and silver space<br/>boots. Very vivid, darkly humorous, too!!!!</p><p>In short, a wonderful disc containing some delicious pieces of music<br/>illustrating a seminal concept from a leading composer/theorist that deserves<br/>every bit of its reputation as a landmark in the field. Bravo, Bill !!!!</p><p>(more to come on &apos;exomusicology&apos;)</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6454 href="#6454">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
