Mr.<br/>Belodubrovsky, the organizer of the acclaimed festival of<br/>contemporary music in Bryansk, Russia, is conversant with many<br/>contemporary trends and here he offers a work, Four Poems, inspired<br/>by the poetry of German poet J. Eichendorf.  This piece, which will<br/>also include text to be recited, sounds practically electronic in its<br/>use of bowing behind the bridge and extended sonorities.  It will be<br/>performed by new music virtuoso Curtis Macomber.</p><p>The Composers Concordance is honored to present a WORLD PREMIERE of a<br/>new piece, Concerto Piccolino, by Milton Babbitt for vibraphone<br/>solo.   As ever, Mr. Babbitt&apos;s music presents a special challenge to<br/>any performer.  Vibraphonist Peter Jarvis will show all his talents<br/>in rendering this new piece.</p><p>Jean Luc Darbellay is a Swiss composer who is well-known throughout<br/>Europe.  We will be presenting his Spectra, a work originally<br/>designed for &quot;natural&quot; horn.  The &quot;natural&quot; horn, which has no<br/>valves,  is an earlier version of the modern instrument.  Gregory<br/>Evans, a new music regular, will be adapting it for the contemporary<br/>instrument.  The piece features, logically enough, sonorities related<br/>to just intonation, the tuning of the &quot;natural&quot; horn.</p><p>Our two Meet the Composer recipients are Daniel Godfrey and Carson<br/>Cooman.  They will both be interviewed by actress Linda Past.  Daniel<br/>Godfrey is quite an exceptional composer, since he is somehow able to<br/>take traditional tonal elements, in our &quot;regular&quot; tuning system, and<br/>come up with something fresh.  His work  is simultaneously<br/>conservative and radical, and it shows that traditional tonal music<br/>is still possible if done carefully in our jaded age.  We are<br/>featuring his Serenata Ariosa, a trio for clarinet, viola and piano.<br/>It will be performed by Lone Madsen, clarinet, Olivia Koppell, viola,<br/>and Judith Olson, piano.</p><p>Carson Cooman is a gifted composer and tireless advocate of<br/>contemporary music through his worldwide organ performances.<br/>Recently he has been receiving some of the recognition he deserves.<br/>We are offering his Sonata for Violin and Piano, a recent piece<br/>inspired by Appalachian folk songs.  The first movement unfolds this<br/>nostalgic material, and the second, faster, movement develops it.<br/>Virtuoso Curtis Macomber will be performing this work, with Judith<br/>Olson at the piano.</p><p>Lone Madsen, clarinetist, will perform Joyce Ellen Ornstein&apos;s Three<br/>Pieces for Clarinet, an attractively lyrical piece in an early<br/>serialist style, and acclaimed guitarist William Anderson will render<br/>Meyer Kupferman&apos;s Exordium with piano accompaniment by Joan Forsyth.<br/>Kupferman is noted for his extensive works for guitar, several with<br/>orchestra, and this piece reflects the talents of a composer<br/>intimately familiar with that medium.</p><p>For our finale, we will present the energetic and varied Brass<br/>Quintet by William Mayer.  This piece, also featured on Mayer&apos;s<br/>recent CRI recording, shows Mayer at his best:  his humor, his solid<br/>harmonic writing and the lyrical variety which is his hallmark.  This<br/>landmark piece in this native New Yorker&apos;s output will be performed<br/>by the Manhattan Brass Quintet.</p><p>Tickets are $12, $7 students, seniors, TDF vouchers are accepted.<br/>For further information phone 212-564-4899.</p></div>
