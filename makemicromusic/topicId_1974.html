[Picture long hair, scraggly<br/>beard, and an earnest look on my face.]</p><p>I was making copies of some old music and uncovered<br/>some compositions from 1990-1. These were composed and<br/>recorded on a &quot;portastudio&quot; (a 4-track cassette based recorder)<br/>and then mastered onto cassette. Last weekend I transferred<br/>them to my computer and then ripped them into mp3s.<br/>It then took about a week to gather up the courage<br/>to post them.</p><p>Anyway, for your amusement, I&apos;ve uploaded the first of these,<br/>which is a song called &quot;Signs&quot;. The lyrics summarize an episode<br/>in the Popol Vuh. Here&apos;s what I wrote about it at the time:</p><p>***</p><p>The Popol Vuh is one of the primary Mayan religious texts. At the<br/>simplest level, the Popol Vuh tells the story of a pair of<br/>brothers who journey to a neighboring realm that is ruled by<br/>a dozen evil Gods. The Gods challenge them to a ball game and<br/>they accept, only to lose their heads. Years later, their sons,<br/>also ball players, journey to avenge their fathers... how they<br/>outwit the evil lords time after time and return victorious is<br/>an epic in the spirit of the Odyssey.</p><p>But the Popol Vuh is much more than an adventure story. It is<br/>a creation myth, a chronicle of astronomical observations, a<br/>story of human nature, of people&apos;s place in the universe, of<br/>the relationships between the animate and the inanimate.<br/>The characters of the Popol Vuh are adept at reading the<br/>signs of the world around them... the voice of a crow that<br/>directs them on their journey, the messages of insects that<br/>give them the true names of the evil ones, the meaning of<br/>the painted eye, the importance of the arrangement of the<br/>clouds, the significance of a rustling in the night. By<br/>reading the signs of their world, the way becomes clear,<br/>and their path to victory is opened.</p><p>***</p><p>The song is recorded in one of the tunings of Archytas,<br/>so it is a tetrachordal-based tuning closely related<br/>to certain Just Intonations.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2002 10:25:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., sethares@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; Every once in a while someone on MMM (or one of the other tuning<br/>&gt; lists)de-lurks and says something like, &quot;Why doesnt anyone make<br/>&gt; normal sounding music using all these weird scales and techniques&quot;?</p><p>What is wrong with people like that?
