I have nerve damage in my hands and<br/>trying<br/>to<br/>play the guitar with any subtlety is getting increasingly difficult.<br/>But<br/>moving into composition and electronic music would enable me to<br/>gratify<br/>my<br/>need for music while finessing the hand problem.</p><p>So can you recommend a web site where I could read up on software,<br/>what<br/>my<br/>options are, all that sort of thing?</p><p>TIA for any ideas you might have.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Max</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

But things have gotten so big and deep, it is hard to know exactly where to point. If nothing else, he can get a start at the KVR site:</p><p><a href="http://www.kvraudio.com/">http://www.kvraudio.com/</a></p><p>...if for no other reason than it is a very populous place with a lot of activity in the forums, pretty good place for a noob to ask questions. A bonus is that the music software in action there contains a big supply of freeware/inexpensive-ware.</p><p>I also offer my services/opinions to Max to give him a leg up sorting out a new direction for himself. Just give him my email address and we can correspond. I lobbied a while back for a page, where each person that wanted to contribute could give a detailed write-up on the tools and scenarios they use to produce music; alas, it didn&apos;t have many people who wanted to take the time.</p><p>So, have Max drop me a line, and hopefully others will chime in as well!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
