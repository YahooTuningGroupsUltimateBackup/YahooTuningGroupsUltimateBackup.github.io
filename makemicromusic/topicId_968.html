The group was formed to facilitate the creation of new<br/>&gt; (classical and related) music, so we use the &quot;Files&quot; area to share<br/>&gt; these. We carefully avoid using, or even approaching, the 20mb limit<br/>&gt; imposed by Yahoo! Groups; this limit is entirely reasonable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Virtually every attempt yields a server out before the entire file is<br/>&gt; downloaded, and this is entirely unrelated to mode of connection,<br/>&gt; system being used to connect, etc. -- i.e. it seems to be a *very*<br/>&gt; common problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can Yahoo! Groups please inform me, the moderator, either what might<br/>&gt; be causing this, or if you have some unwritten or unstated actual<br/>&gt; size limit on file downloading?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We/I appreciate your prompt response on this matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Respectfully,<br/>&gt; Jon Szanto<br/>&gt; Moderator: Creating Microtonal Music<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
