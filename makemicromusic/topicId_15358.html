And, one of the shows was the fretless fest in NYC; <a href="http://nycfretlessguitarfestival.com">nycfretlessguitarfestival.com</a> has a lot of audio/video stuff, check it out. Catler&apos;s workshop was a highlight, as was David Fiuzsynski&apos;s solo at his workshop, and his band was probably the best there. Hope you find something you like...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
