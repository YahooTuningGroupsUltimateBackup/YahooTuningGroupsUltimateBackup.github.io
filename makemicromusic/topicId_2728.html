I like this quote immensely.<br/>&gt;Sometimes it&apos;s as though Partch speaks my thoughts from beyond the<br/>&gt;grave.</p><p>It seems Partch embodied several unbounded qualities seldom found within the mediated human spirit (whether this mediation is religious, regional culture, nationalist, consumer/commercialist, or the &quot;dark side&quot; of the academy). I do believe these qualities can be witnessed in every generation; the hard part is making connections that fall outside the boundaries of a mediated context between generations (up or down).</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m working diligently on the next CD and other surprises. Spent the<br/>&gt;entire weeked in the studio working on more groove based microtonal<br/>&gt;compositions.</p><p>Excellent! I will be excited to hear it when you have it completed.</p><p>&gt;I really enjoyed this! It&apos;s deep and ambient sounding. In a way your<br/>&gt;feedback technique reminds me of self oscillating filters with a<br/>&gt;sample-and-hold modulator - except different. Very creative!</p><p>Thanks for the kind words.</p><p>&gt;Hello Mike !  I would recommend  Delusion of the Fury<br/>as the best place to start with Partch and i think you might find his own book<br/>&quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; possibly more confrontational that Gilmores excellent book but much more fun.</p><p>It certainly is on the top of my list. I plan to tackle it this summer + a lot more.</p><p>In regard to getting new music. This is a frustrating area for me currently as I am spending any money saved on audio equipment. I haven&apos;t bought much music since last summer and this dead period is uncomfortable. I can&apos;t find what I want online without a lot of searching, but even then what I am looking for is seldom available.</p><p>&gt;It looks like you are in LA also!</p><p>I have been based in San Luis Obispo for the past 6 years. It really doesn&apos;t surprise me that Partch was held in jail here. What happened then could certainly happen now..  I really am looking forward to getting back to the SF area in June.</p><p>Here is a link to my latest little study. Now remember I am not an official harp performer.<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/density/d-01.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/density/d-01.mp3</a></p><p>I am going to create a series based on density that will lead up to hopefully a first piece using this harp and a contrabass guitar. Of course I am going to have a hand in manipulating things too..</p><p>I recorded this with my Distressor. It has changed my life. One goes for $700 with no bidder at Digibid on the 23rd. Seriously, someone should spring for it...</p><p>Oh yeah.. One more review I forgot to post last week. My &quot;information net&quot; ;) picked up on an excellent A/D/A converter for the price. It is the Lynx Two (<a href="http://www.lynxstudio.com/lynxtwo.html">http://www.lynxstudio.com/lynxtwo.html</a>). It has amazing specs for something that retails at about $1000. The analog inputs/outputs have a dynamic range of 115db. It also supports AES inputs and ADAT. This would be a killer card to install for its own capabilities and for use with an external converter. The Lynx Two will support 8 AES connections (coming out this summer); standard support is 2. Oh yeah.. It can support up to 192khz sampling rate too! I am upgrading to this guy<br/>once I sell my live sound equipment after my final event in May.</p><p>Cheers..<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
