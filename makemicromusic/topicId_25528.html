I am starting to hate <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> and will probably be releasing future albums on bandcamp, so I apologize if any of you have trouble streaming or downloading the tracks.  Some of you may have already heard these, but if not, here you go!</p><p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/City+Of+The+Asleep/Xenning">http://www.last.fm/music/City+Of+The+Asleep/Xenning</a></p><p>Two tracks each in 15, 16, and 18-EDO (in that order).  The 15-EDO tracks in particular show off just how smooth 15 can sound; the 16-EDO tracks are pretty weird, and I think Mike in particular will get a kick out of &quot;Citric Haze&quot;, which is all over the map and heavily chromatic (which is unusual for me).  The 18-EDO tracks show off the weird combination of smoothness and tension/restlessness that 18-EDO is so good at, and they don&apos;t sound at all out of tune to my ears despite often employing some pretty zany intervals.  All are done on guitar except for &quot;Droned&quot; which uses fake guitar/dulcimer sounds from the EXS-24 sampler in Logic 8.</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
