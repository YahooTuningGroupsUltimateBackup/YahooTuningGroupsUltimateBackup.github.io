John Loffink<br/>&gt; should know more. Additive synthesis no ploblem. (Back in my<br/>&gt; time, the synthesizer and the sample mangler were separate<br/>&gt; products.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like to have a tool that would allow me to at least<br/>&gt; &gt; get to the<br/>&gt; &gt; door step of Sethares&apos; world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Reaktor can, you can probably bend partials every which<br/>&gt; way in realtime, detune them along an envelope... Forget<br/>&gt; sample retuning by mathlab :O).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Reaktor has three resynthesis modules:  Sample Resynth, Sample Pitch<br/>Former and Beat Loop.</p><p>Sample Resynth allows you to control the pitch and sample playback speed<br/>independently.  This means you could slow down or freeze the playback<br/>and continue controlling the pitch.  There&apos;s no bending of partials<br/>here, though this would allow you to pick out the partials at any<br/>instant in time and play them continuously.</p><p>Sample Pitch Former is similar to Sample Resynth but allows absolute<br/>control of pitch, just like an oscillator, not adjustment relative to<br/>the original pitch.  It also has a formant shift control that allows you<br/>to shift the formants of the original sound independently from the<br/>pitch, but it appears that this won&apos;t actually move the partials.</p><p>Beat Loop is a resynthesizer for synchronizing beat loops.</p><p>So Reaktor has some resynthesis modules, but they may not offer to<br/>amount of control that you desire.  You might want to look at NI&apos;s<br/>Spektral Delay.  It breaks a sound into as many as 1024 frequency bands<br/>and allows independent adjustment of each band, but again this adjusts<br/>the levels of the partials, not the pitches.</p><p>It sounds like you might be able to use a frequency shifter, but I know<br/>of no implementation of one in software except probably CSOUND or Kyma.<br/>Look on the web for Moog, Bode or Serge frequency shifters for more<br/>information.  I worked on a frequency shifter macro for Reaktor, but I<br/>never completed debugging of it to fix some problems I encountered.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p></div>
