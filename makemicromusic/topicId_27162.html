In this climate of intonational  monoculture, those who  oppose the<br/>status quo with fresh and oddly-tuned  musics need DESIGN.</p><p>Microtonality  (or Xenharmonics) is a proposal to sing out of tune  with<br/>conventional  wisdom and offer a badly-needed alternative to what  everyone<br/>already  knows.  The School for Designing a Society is  currently holding<br/>meetings  to &ldquo;unstick the ear&rdquo; in a seminar called  Microtonal Design, taught by<br/>members of Oddmusic U-C.  Its participants  seek to collaborate and share  what<br/>they care about in an experimental  format we&rsquo;re calling an  Unconference.</p><p>The  &lsquo;un&rsquo; in &lsquo;unconference&rsquo; refers to a non-hierarchical  organization.  To<br/>start, we&rsquo;ll use a collaborative wiki to share plans  and desires, and  the<br/>events will take shape from there.  It&rsquo;s an  opportunity to present  &amp;<br/>collaborate on what we are calling  Microtonal Design  (compositions,<br/>instruments, performances, and other  media) in a variety  of formats, as<br/>determined by the desires of  participants.  We imagine an  intensive filled<br/>with jams, recording  projects, collaborative  composing, manifestos, instrument<br/>building,  brainstorming for the  future, research, etc.</p><p>The event is free and there are many capacities in which you might participate:<br/>&#x9;* You  may decide to come to Urbana for the entire five days of the<br/>Unconference, which begins in the afternoon on Tuesday, April 19, when   we<br/>finalize the schedule with our special guests and current students   and<br/>organizers.<br/>&#x9;* Or  you may decide to come on Friday, April 22, for an all-day<br/>interdisciplinary intensive which lasts until Saturday (IMC-OMNIA).<br/>&#x9;* Or  may decide to come on Saturday, April 23, for a culminating  event: a<br/>three-hour gala with workshops, performances, and various  other showings  and<br/>events related to Microtonal Design, which will be  publicized in  Urbana.  You<br/>may prefer to show up for the event and  participate as a  casual event-goer; or<br/>you may bring something to  present.  In the latter  case, please get in touch<br/>ahead of time.<br/>If  you would like to participate in any capacity other than casual  event-goer<br/>on Saturday, April 23, please start by editing the wiki page  for the<br/>Unconference (anyone may edit, with or without a Wikispaces  account) and add<br/>your name to the list or participants.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
