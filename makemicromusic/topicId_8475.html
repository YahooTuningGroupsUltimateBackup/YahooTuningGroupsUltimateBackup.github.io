I think I understand you much better now.<br/>Interesting<br/>&gt; idea about differently textured keys...I shall have to ask Stevie<br/>&gt; about his opinion on that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think 22 is a little more of a challenge to make a lattice for<br/>than<br/>&gt; 22, though.  In 22, I desire to use 3 systems as different bases<br/>for<br/>&gt; tonality: Paul&apos;s Pajara-based Decatonics, Super-pythagorean<br/>&gt; Diatonics, and Porcupine-8 Octatonics.  In the first system, one<br/>&gt; constructs 10-note scales using 8 2-degree steps and 2 3-degree<br/>&gt; steps.  In Diatonics, the scales are 2 1-degree steps and 5 4-<br/>degree<br/>&gt; steps.  And in Porcupine, it is 1 1-degree step and 7 3-degree<br/>&gt; steps.  This makes designing a keyboard INSANELY difficult.  I<br/>&gt; examined a suggested lattice for 22-based Diatonics, but that one<br/>&gt; makes playing in the other two systems (Porcupine especially!) very<br/>&gt; difficult.  I haven&apos;t attempted one based on a decatonic scale yet,<br/>&gt; but one based on the Porcupine seems to work quite well.  If it was<br/>&gt; mapped to a hex lattice, going &quot;up&quot; would ascend one degree,<br/>&gt; going &quot;right&quot; would ascend 3, and going &quot;diagonal&quot; would be 4.<br/>It&apos;s<br/>&gt; almost exactly the same as the Wilson idea, now that I think about<br/>&gt; it, except that the axes are switched around.  It is precisely that<br/>&gt; design I applied to my keyboard (though the last design I posted<br/>did<br/>&gt; not feature the 4th row of duplicate white keys at the top that I<br/>&gt; later added), but modified to fit in one dimension.  This removes<br/>&gt; some of the uniformity a lattice provides, since at one point the<br/>&gt; horizontal ascends by 1 degree instead of 3 (though I may yet find<br/>a<br/>&gt; way around this), but this seems like the best compromise between<br/>&gt; traditional and general.</p><p>Almost makes you want to build 3 different keyboards for 22, eh?  ;-)</p><p>&gt; Would it be possible, do you think, to use rectangular (or even<br/>&gt; square) keys that would feel fairly traditional to make a lattice<br/>&gt; that could ascend uniformly without needing to stretch too far in<br/>the<br/>&gt; vertical dimension?</p><p>More about square keys below.</p><p>From my experience with 22 on my Scalatron, I think you&apos;re being<br/>overly concerned about y-axis issues.  The keys on my Scalatron could<br/>have been made smaller, in my opinion, by foreshortening the aspect<br/>ratio along the y-axis, but even so, I haven&apos;t found 22 to present<br/>any problem with vertical stretching, as long as I have duplicate<br/>keys, which allow me to choose in which *direction* I will be<br/>reaching.  I&apos;ve found that the y-dimension can even be used to<br/>advantage by playing the closer keys with the thumb, e.g., the second-<br/>lowest note of a chord may be played by crossing the right-hand thumb<br/>under the fingers.  This is a new technique, but that&apos;s to be<br/>expected with new music and new tunings.</p><p>This statement from a later message of yours brings up another<br/>concern with the y-axis:</p><p>&gt; On Wilson&apos;s design, the Y-axis = 3 increments,<br/>&gt; so a porcupine scale would be totally vertical.  Decatonics go in a<br/>&gt; series of staggered &quot;W&quot; shapes, and diatonics go on that nice<br/>&gt; staggered horizontal pattern.</p><p>I infer that you think it&apos;s undesirable to play a scale in which many<br/>of the intervals are along a vertical.  On the Bosanquet keyboard<br/>tones separated by a single degree of 31-ET are not only directly one<br/>above the other, but are two rows distant, but playing a panchromatic<br/>scale (one involving all of the tones) in 31-ET is, unexpectedly, a<br/>piece of cake.  Even though the fingering pattern is very different<br/>from anything I had ever done before (at least with the right hand),<br/>it took me about 30 seconds to figure it out, and only about 2<br/>minutes of practice to be able to play it quickly (i.e., as sixteenth<br/>notes).</p><p>With Porcupine you&apos;re in a similar situation with the Bosanquet<br/>geometry.  When you&apos;re playing a two-dimensional keyboard, you have<br/>to expect that *some* things are going to occur along the y-axis.  On<br/>the left-hand button system of my accordion (which I learned ~14<br/>years before working on a Scalatron keyboard design) *all* scales (in<br/>12-ET) are played with intervals frequently taken along the<br/>equivalent of the y-axis (i.e., the axis parallel to the fingers),<br/>while octaves are located along the x-axis (with all buttons being in<br/>a single plane), so I already had quite a bit of 2-dimensional<br/>experience behind me and therefore wasn&apos;t afraid to think outside the<br/>x-axis.</p><p>The huge advantage offered by a homogeneous key layout is that even<br/>seemingly weird fingering patterns aren&apos;t very difficult to learn,<br/>because you&apos;re simultaneously learning them in every key.</p><p>&gt; Indeed it seems that a uniform design might help<br/>&gt; in allowing multiple systems to be played on the same keyboard.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure exactly how you&apos;re using the word &quot;systems&quot;, but yes,<br/>that&apos;s true regardless of whether you&apos;re referring to multiple scales<br/>(diatonic, porcupine, and decatonic) within a single tuning (22-ET),<br/>or multiple tunings (and multiple scales within those tunings) on a<br/>single (generalized) keyboard.  Transpositional invariance in a<br/>keyboard has a lot to be said for it, and if you&apos;re seriously<br/>considering a non-uniform arrangement of keys, then I think that<br/>statement is worth repeating again, and again, and again -- if only<br/>to drive home the point that you&apos;ll be doing a lot of practicing<br/>again, and again, and again to achieve the same facility on a<br/>heterogeneous layout.  ;-)</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; must admit that I have lost a little enthusiasm for the traditional<br/>&gt; design since considering that three systems need to be accomodated<br/>by<br/>&gt; one design.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rest assured, too, that I am not dead-set on anything yet; I&apos;m<br/>trying<br/>&gt; to avoid making a mistake as well, since it will be tremendous<br/>effort<br/>&gt; to build this thing ourselves.  If I seem stubborn, it&apos;s because I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want Stevie to be stuck with something that he doesn&apos;t want<br/>to<br/>&gt; play.  Also, one thing I think we ought to keep in mind is that<br/>this<br/>&gt; will be a MIDI controller; as such, the potential difficulty of<br/>&gt; transposing to some keys may feasibly be avoided simply be retuning<br/>&gt; the synthesizer.</p><p>That&apos;s also a way of reducing the number of duplicate keys you might<br/>need.  The GK Scalatron that Paul Rapoport got for McMaster U.<br/>(Hamilton, Ontario) has 56 keys/octave, but he can play 41 and 53-ET<br/>on it by toggling the entire keyboard up and down by 2 commas on the<br/>fly by means of a foot switch.  (But I don&apos;t think that you really<br/>need anything like that for 22.)</p><p>&gt; Apologies should be made for my earlier attitude; the internet<br/>makes<br/>&gt; misunderstanding easy, and I&apos;m all too accustomed to the &quot;flame<br/>wars&quot;<br/>&gt; that occur on other forums.</p><p>Oh, they occur around here too, from time to time (more often than<br/>any of us would like).  :-(</p><p>&gt; Your input is greatly appreciated, since<br/>&gt; you have a perspective that both Stevie and I are lacking.  Please<br/>&gt; remember too that we are young, and we sort of have to learn at our<br/>&gt; own pace.  Before we give in and go general, we first must make<br/>sure<br/>&gt; that there are no alternatives that would be more favorable, and<br/>this<br/>&gt; could take awhile (if it is indeed the case).</p><p>The best advice I could give is to take your time and think<br/>everything through so you do it right the first time.  Here are a few<br/>things to think about:</p><p>1) For whatever reason, there may not be a second time.<br/>2) One of the most difficult things about learning a new keyboard is<br/>*unlearning* habits acquired on an existing one, so try to make your<br/>*first* new one the *only one* you&apos;ll ever need.  While it may be<br/>economical to build your own keyboard, it will be very &quot;expensive&quot; in<br/>terms of effort (i.e., inconvenient, frustrating, or daunting) later<br/>on to do it all over again.<br/>3) A transpositionally invariant keyboard will accommodate more<br/>tunings than a non-uniform keyboard.<br/>4) A Bosanquet generalized keyboard will accommodate more tunings<br/>than a porcupine-generalized keyboard.<br/>5) For whatever reason, there may not be a second time, so choose<br/>wisely.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay folks, that about does it.

Eliminate the gaps and you have almost square<br/>keys.</p><p>Regardless of which keyboard layout you choose, I would suggest<br/>coloring the keys more traditionally: flats red, naturals white,<br/>sharps black, and the remaining 5 light blue or cyan (with textured<br/>surfaces on the sharp and flat keys).  (What&apos;s traditional about the<br/>coloring is that it&apos;s already been used on the Scalatron -- if you<br/>care about maintaining any links to the past.)  You don&apos;t need<br/>coloring to emphasize a Porcupine pattern, because the layout already<br/>does that for you, but when you&apos; want to play C, D, E, etc., it&apos;s<br/>very helpful to know they&apos;re white keys.</p><p>IMO the greatest downside to the trad-porc design is that the octaves<br/>are not in the same rows, which means that some things will have to<br/>be fingered differently in different octaves.  This could be greatly<br/>remedied by another row of duplicate keys, but that&apos;s more work<br/>and/or expense.  With laterally placed octaves the number of<br/>duplicate keys drops, but in order to have that (and at the same time<br/>a reasonable octave distance) you would need to have slanting rows.</p><p>Your insistence on using rectangular keys has severely limited your<br/>options for an arrangement with transpositional invariancy.<br/>Evidently this is a result of your desire to have key-levers that<br/>operate switches, rather than having the key surfaces directly atop<br/>the switches (which is what I suspect to be the reason for your<br/>wanting a specialized keyboard).  Are there any key switches<br/>available with square tops that might be acceptable as key surfaces?<br/>That would greatly simplify the construction, for you could then have<br/>all of the keys in a single plane (which works just fine on the GK<br/>Scalatron).</p><p>If you use square keys and can eliminate the constraint against<br/>slanting rows (but keep the vertical columns) you could have<br/>something like this (for best viewing zoom to 100%):</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/secor/GKbd22Sq.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/secor/GKbd22Sq.gif</a></p><p>I realize that movement along the y-axis is quite a bit more than you<br/>desired, but I think that the shortened octave distance more than<br/>makes up for that.  Why don&apos;t you and Stevie work out some patterns<br/>on it and see what you think.  Some things may seem a bit unorthodox<br/>at first, but that&apos;s what alternate tunings are all about.  I&apos;m<br/>confident that, with a few minutes of practice, Stevie could easily<br/>play a porcupine scale with a thumb and 2 fingers on this keyboard.</p><p>Should you locate switches with square tops, there would also be a<br/>possibility of orienting the edges along diagonals, which I suspect<br/>would allow a better arrangement of keys (less spread out in the y-<br/>direction, with keys staggered in adjacent rows).</p><p>Lastly, this is a true Bosanquet arrangement, so in addition to<br/>transpositional invariance you also have the ability to use it for a<br/>lot of other divisions (including 17, 19, 29, and 31).  And its<br/>NUMBER ONE ADVANTAGE is that whatever the time spent building and<br/>learning can be applied toward those other divisions -- in other<br/>words, you&apos;re not starting from scratch when (notice that I didn&apos;t<br/>say &quot;if&quot;) you want another tuning.  And if you&apos;re ever called upon to<br/>play someone else&apos;s generalized keyboard or decide to purchase one,<br/>the previous time invested will pay *big* dividends.</p><p>Igliashon, Stevie:  May you choose carefully and wisely, my friends.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=8484 href="#8484">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2005 2:04:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George:</p><p>looking at that design picture of yours, I am SOLD.

This is a new technique, but that&apos;s to be<br/>&gt; expected with new music and new tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This statement from a later message of yours brings up another<br/>&gt; concern with the y-axis:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Wilson&apos;s design, the Y-axis = 3 increments,<br/>&gt; &gt; so a porcupine scale would be totally vertical.  Decatonics go in<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; series of staggered &quot;W&quot; shapes, and diatonics go on that nice<br/>&gt; &gt; staggered horizontal pattern.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I infer that you think it&apos;s undesirable to play a scale in which<br/>many<br/>&gt; of the intervals are along a vertical.

When you&apos;re playing a two-dimensional keyboard, you have<br/>&gt; to expect that *some* things are going to occur along the y-axis.<br/>On<br/>&gt; the left-hand button system of my accordion (which I learned ~14<br/>&gt; years before working on a Scalatron keyboard design) *all* scales<br/>(in<br/>&gt; 12-ET) are played with intervals frequently taken along the<br/>&gt; equivalent of the y-axis (i.e., the axis parallel to the fingers),<br/>&gt; while octaves are located along the x-axis (with all buttons being<br/>in<br/>&gt; a single plane), so I already had quite a bit of 2-dimensional<br/>&gt; experience behind me and therefore wasn&apos;t afraid to think outside<br/>the<br/>&gt; x-axis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The huge advantage offered by a homogeneous key layout is that even<br/>&gt; seemingly weird fingering patterns aren&apos;t very difficult to learn,<br/>&gt; because you&apos;re simultaneously learning them in every key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Indeed it seems that a uniform design might help<br/>&gt; &gt; in allowing multiple systems to be played on the same keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure exactly how you&apos;re using the word &quot;systems&quot;, but yes,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s true regardless of whether you&apos;re referring to multiple<br/>scales<br/>&gt; (diatonic, porcupine, and decatonic) within a single tuning (22-<br/>ET),<br/>&gt; or multiple tunings (and multiple scales within those tunings) on a<br/>&gt; single (generalized) keyboard.  Transpositional invariance in a<br/>&gt; keyboard has a lot to be said for it, and if you&apos;re seriously<br/>&gt; considering a non-uniform arrangement of keys, then I think that<br/>&gt; statement is worth repeating again, and again, and again -- if only<br/>&gt; to drive home the point that you&apos;ll be doing a lot of practicing<br/>&gt; again, and again, and again to achieve the same facility on a<br/>&gt; heterogeneous layout.  ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; must admit that I have lost a little enthusiasm for the<br/>traditional<br/>&gt; &gt; design since considering that three systems need to be<br/>accomodated<br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; one design.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rest assured, too, that I am not dead-set on anything yet; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; trying<br/>&gt; &gt; to avoid making a mistake as well, since it will be tremendous<br/>&gt; effort<br/>&gt; &gt; to build this thing ourselves.

Before we give in and go general, we first must make<br/>&gt; sure<br/>&gt; &gt; that there are no alternatives that would be more favorable, and<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; could take awhile (if it is indeed the case).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The best advice I could give is to take your time and think<br/>&gt; everything through so you do it right the first time.  Here are a<br/>few<br/>&gt; things to think about:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) For whatever reason, there may not be a second time.<br/>&gt; 2) One of the most difficult things about learning a new keyboard<br/>is<br/>&gt; *unlearning* habits acquired on an existing one, so try to make<br/>your<br/>&gt; *first* new one the *only one* you&apos;ll ever need.  While it may be<br/>&gt; economical to build your own keyboard, it will be very &quot;expensive&quot;<br/>in<br/>&gt; terms of effort (i.e., inconvenient, frustrating, or daunting)<br/>later<br/>&gt; on to do it all over again.<br/>&gt; 3) A transpositionally invariant keyboard will accommodate more<br/>&gt; tunings than a non-uniform keyboard.<br/>&gt; 4) A Bosanquet generalized keyboard will accommodate more tunings<br/>&gt; than a porcupine-generalized keyboard.<br/>&gt; 5) For whatever reason, there may not be a second time, so choose<br/>&gt; wisely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay folks, that about does it.

They are all there, in<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; 22-equal Keyboard Designs folder of the Photos section.  I can<br/>&gt; think<br/>&gt; &gt; of no other ways to apply this scale to a traditional keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; concept.  This last one was suggested by Paul Erlich, though I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; sure if I got it right.  It&apos;s based on the C Standard<br/>Pentachordal<br/>&gt; &gt; Major.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If anyone sees a clear winner among these designs, or can think<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; something that I haven&apos;t thought of, please let me know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of these, I think that your &quot;generalized trad porc-colored&quot; would<br/>be,<br/>&gt; in the long run, the easiest to learn, because it&apos;s the only one<br/>&gt; having transpositional invariancy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that there are larger gaps between the top two rows of<br/>keys<br/>&gt; (which, as far as I can tell, serves no real purpose and detracts<br/>&gt; from the appearance).  Eliminate the gaps and you have almost<br/>square<br/>&gt; keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regardless of which keyboard layout you choose, I would suggest<br/>&gt; coloring the keys more traditionally: flats red, naturals white,<br/>&gt; sharps black, and the remaining 5 light blue or cyan (with textured<br/>&gt; surfaces on the sharp and flat keys).  (What&apos;s traditional about<br/>the<br/>&gt; coloring is that it&apos;s already been used on the Scalatron -- if you<br/>&gt; care about maintaining any links to the past.)  You don&apos;t need<br/>&gt; coloring to emphasize a Porcupine pattern, because the layout<br/>already<br/>&gt; does that for you, but when you&apos; want to play C, D, E, etc., it&apos;s<br/>&gt; very helpful to know they&apos;re white keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IMO the greatest downside to the trad-porc design is that the<br/>octaves<br/>&gt; are not in the same rows, which means that some things will have to<br/>&gt; be fingered differently in different octaves.  This could be<br/>greatly<br/>&gt; remedied by another row of duplicate keys, but that&apos;s more work<br/>&gt; and/or expense.  With laterally placed octaves the number of<br/>&gt; duplicate keys drops, but in order to have that (and at the same<br/>time<br/>&gt; a reasonable octave distance) you would need to have slanting rows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your insistence on using rectangular keys has severely limited your<br/>&gt; options for an arrangement with transpositional invariancy.<br/>&gt; Evidently this is a result of your desire to have key-levers that<br/>&gt; operate switches, rather than having the key surfaces directly atop<br/>&gt; the switches (which is what I suspect to be the reason for your<br/>&gt; wanting a specialized keyboard).  Are there any key switches<br/>&gt; available with square tops that might be acceptable as key<br/>surfaces?<br/>&gt; That would greatly simplify the construction, for you could then<br/>have<br/>&gt; all of the keys in a single plane (which works just fine on the GK<br/>&gt; Scalatron).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you use square keys and can eliminate the constraint against<br/>&gt; slanting rows (but keep the vertical columns) you could have<br/>&gt; something like this (for best viewing zoom to 100%):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/secor/GKbd22Sq.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/secor/GKbd22Sq.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize that movement along the y-axis is quite a bit more than<br/>you<br/>&gt; desired, but I think that the shortened octave distance more than<br/>&gt; makes up for that.  Why don&apos;t you and Stevie work out some patterns<br/>&gt; on it and see what you think.  Some things may seem a bit<br/>unorthodox<br/>&gt; at first, but that&apos;s what alternate tunings are all about.  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; confident that, with a few minutes of practice, Stevie could easily<br/>&gt; play a porcupine scale with a thumb and 2 fingers on this keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should you locate switches with square tops, there would also be a<br/>&gt; possibility of orienting the edges along diagonals, which I suspect<br/>&gt; would allow a better arrangement of keys (less spread out in the y-<br/>&gt; direction, with keys staggered in adjacent rows).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lastly, this is a true Bosanquet arrangement, so in addition to<br/>&gt; transpositional invariance you also have the ability to use it for<br/>a<br/>&gt; lot of other divisions (including 17, 19, 29, and 31).  And its<br/>&gt; NUMBER ONE ADVANTAGE is that whatever the time spent building and<br/>&gt; learning can be applied toward those other divisions -- in other<br/>&gt; words, you&apos;re not starting from scratch when (notice that I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; say &quot;if&quot;) you want another tuning.  And if you&apos;re ever called upon<br/>to<br/>&gt; play someone else&apos;s generalized keyboard or decide to purchase one,<br/>&gt; the previous time invested will pay *big* dividends.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igliashon, Stevie:  May you choose carefully and wisely, my friends.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p></div><h3><a id=8485 href="#8485">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2005 4:03:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Heya George,</p><p>Just wondering... what is your no-holds-barred favorite<br/>22-tET layout?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8496 href="#8496">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

Ay dios mio, I<br/>&gt; totally underestimated this design.  Not only is this one 10x<br/>easier<br/>&gt; to play, it also would be 10x easier to build since we&apos;d only need<br/>to<br/>&gt; make 1 key shape: a square.  Heck, we could probably find somewhere<br/>&gt; to BUY the keys.</p><p>When we checked out momentary switches in the 1970&apos;s we found that<br/>many of them were not very good for a synthesizer keyboard.

Also, find out<br/>what colors are available for key-tops.  And get samples to try<br/>before you buy anything.</p><p>&gt; I mean, if we get around to building an acoustic piano we&apos;ll<br/>probably<br/>&gt; have to go with one of our more traditional-looking designs, but<br/>for<br/>&gt; a MIDI controller I think this is it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Heck, with a good 6 or 7 octaves of that design laid out, it<br/>wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; even look too un-keyboard like.</p><p>One minor concern I have with this design is that there&apos;s no &quot;white&quot;<br/>space separating the groups of 2 and 3 sharp and flat keys, so the<br/>visual 2-and-3 pattern is not as obvious -- on the GK Scalatron it<br/>almost jumps out at you.  I&apos;d like to see if I can remedy this by<br/>slanting the vertical columns counter-clockwise a bit (and also<br/>allowing the columns to &quot;slide&quot; past one another so as to keep the<br/>octaves perfectly lateral), while increasing the octave distance to<br/>about 140 mm (as on the GK Scalatron, which is still one key less<br/>than on a piano).  Another significant benefit that I would expect<br/>from this is a shorter reach in the y-direction, which I know will be<br/>important to you.</p><p>The keys would still be square, but the sides would all slant.  You<br/>can decide whether that&apos;s aesthetically acceptable after I&apos;ve made a<br/>diagram (which will take at least a few days, so more patience,<br/>please).

I&apos;m completely stunned!  :-}</p><p>Actually, so was I.  I&apos;ve been mapping scales to the various layouts<br/>Stevie, Paul and I came up with, and each one involves a hefty<br/>compromise for at least one of the 3 systems.  (To see what I&apos;m<br/>talking about, take a look at:</p><p><a href="http://photobucket.com/albums/v170/igliashon_jones/">http://photobucket.com/albums/v170/igliashon_jones/</a></p><p>On 3 of our designs, I placed different colored dots to denote<br/>members of various types of C major scales (the 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3<br/>porcupine-8 major, the 4 4 1 4 4 4 1 diatonic major, and the 2 2 3 2<br/>2 2 3 2 2 2 Std. Pentachordal major).  For my traditionally-shaped<br/>general-esque design, I did seperate versions for each scale.</p><p>Looking at those designs, I couldn&apos;t imagine anyone trying to learn<br/>to play all 3 systems on one keyboard.  Just one of them would be<br/>hard enough.</p><p>Then, compare them with the same scales mapped to your version.<br/>Really, there&apos;s just no contest.</p><p>What really sold me though was the actual act of putting my fingers<br/>to the screen and trying to finger chords and scales.  Now, I have<br/>scarcely any experience on the keyboard, but I found that I could run<br/>my fingers up and down any scale pattern at a good 16th-note clip on<br/>your design, and that was without even being able to feel keys under<br/>my fingers!  I tried to do that with other designs and found them way<br/>too awkward.  It just goes to show that you can&apos;t tell how playable<br/>an instrument is just by looking at it.</p><p>Plus, I&apos;ve been thinking about the sheer plethora of scales and modes<br/>available in 22.  The variety is exponentially greater than 12-equal,<br/>so without transposable invariance, that could add up to hundreds of<br/>patterns to memorize.  Think about it: 7 diatonic modes + 10<br/>pentachordal modes + 10 symmetric modes + 8 porcupine modes = 35<br/>modal patterns x 22 possible key centers = *770* patterns, and that&apos;s<br/>only with the BASIC patterns of 3 systems...when you add altered or<br/>semi-chromatic scales...I don&apos;t even want to imagine!  And what about<br/>chord voicings?  It hurts my head to think about it all.  With a<br/>system as rich as 22, I&apos;ve come to realize that transpositional<br/>invariance is really necessary to get the most out of an instrument.</p><p>&gt; When we checked out momentary switches in the 1970&apos;s we found that<br/>&gt; many of them were not very good for a synthesizer keyboard.  It<br/>took<br/>&gt; a bit of looking to find one having both an appropriate amount of<br/>&gt; resistance (most were too &quot;heavy&quot;) and key travel.  Also, find out<br/>&gt; what colors are available for key-tops.  And get samples to try<br/>&gt; before you buy anything.</p><p>Yeah, the actual construction is going to be the hard part.  I&apos;m sure<br/>once we get to that phase we&apos;ll have more questions for you.</p><p>&gt; One minor concern I have with this design is that there&apos;s<br/>no &quot;white&quot;<br/>&gt; space separating the groups of 2 and 3 sharp and flat keys, so the<br/>&gt; visual 2-and-3 pattern is not as obvious -- on the GK Scalatron it<br/>&gt; almost jumps out at you.</p><p>For 22, I think a slightly different color scheme would be<br/>appropriate.  Since flats and sharps are always a single step from<br/>the nearest white key, I think they should BOTH be &quot;colored&quot;--red for<br/>flat, cyan for sharp (or possibly vice-versa)--so that the semi-<br/>sharps/semi-flats create a row of blacks between the colors.  This<br/>would help when using decatonic scales, I think.  One thing I&apos;ve been<br/>thinking about too is that it might be useful to use semi-transparent<br/>uncolored keys with colored LEDs underneath them.  That way, you<br/>could program different colorschemes to correspond with different key<br/>mappings and tunings that you could activate with the flick of a<br/>switch.  Of course this would be more difficult and expensive and we<br/>probably won&apos;t bother to do it ourselves (since this will be a<br/>primarily 22-based instrument), but for future generalized keyboards<br/>it could be an option.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d like to see if I can remedy this by<br/>&gt; slanting the vertical columns counter-clockwise a bit (and also<br/>&gt; allowing the columns to &quot;slide&quot; past one another so as to keep the<br/>&gt; octaves perfectly lateral), while increasing the octave distance to<br/>&gt; about 140 mm (as on the GK Scalatron, which is still one key less<br/>&gt; than on a piano).  Another significant benefit that I would expect<br/>&gt; from this is a shorter reach in the y-direction, which I know will<br/>be<br/>&gt; important to you.</p><p>I look forward to seeing how this iteration turns out.  As it stands<br/>I think the design is perfectly fine, but who knows?  This may be<br/>even better.  I certainly don&apos;t think slanted keys should pose a<br/>problem for us, though i&apos;ve yet to speak with Stevie on the matter.<br/>I&apos;m fairly confident that he will be easily persuaded with a quick<br/>demonstration, though.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-Igliashon</p></div><h3><a id=8502 href="#8502">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2005 1:15:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Yikes!

When Erv<br/>Wilson and John Chalmers heard about what we doing, they each made a<br/>trip from California to the Chicago area to see the keyboard while<br/>the instrument was still under construction.  Erv&apos;s input regarding<br/>key shape and dimensions proved to be indispensable.</p><p>Of course, no one knew about a Porcupine or Decatonic subset of 22 at<br/>the time, so your testing of this latest (square-key) proposed<br/>incarnation has gone a step farther.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; One minor concern I have with this design is that there&apos;s<br/>no &quot;white&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; space separating the groups of 2 and 3 sharp and flat keys, so<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; visual 2-and-3 pattern is not as obvious -- on the GK Scalatron<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; almost jumps out at you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For 22, I think a slightly different color scheme would be<br/>&gt; appropriate.  Since flats and sharps are always a single step from<br/>&gt; the nearest white key, I think they should BOTH be &quot;colored&quot;--red<br/>for<br/>&gt; flat, cyan for sharp (or possibly vice-versa)--so that the semi-<br/>&gt; sharps/semi-flats create a row of blacks between the colors.  This<br/>&gt; would help when using decatonic scales, I think.</p><p>The long-standing tradition established by Bosanquet is alternating 7-<br/>white and 5-black, as one proceeds along a chain of fifths (the<br/>generating interval).  Even though we employed additional key colors<br/>on the Scalatron (5 on two of the GK instruments, and 9 colors on the<br/>third one), we still retained an alternating 7-light-5-dark pattern<br/>that would be meaningful for multiple tunings (e.g., red is &quot;dark&quot;<br/>and pink is &quot;light&quot;).  I would encourage you to abide by that<br/>tradition, for two reasons:</p><p>1) While I do see some logic in choosing complementary colors for<br/>sharps and flats (opposites), the strong contrast between alternating<br/>light and dark rows of keys are very effective in helping one to<br/>perceive the coloring pattern.  I have observed that cyan (or light<br/>blue) and white are less easily distinguished in subdued lighting, so<br/>I would want to avoid having them on adjacent keys.</p><p>&gt; One thing I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; thinking about too is that it might be useful to use semi-<br/>transparent<br/>&gt; uncolored keys with colored LEDs underneath them.  That way, you<br/>&gt; could program different colorschemes to correspond with different<br/>key<br/>&gt; mappings and tunings that you could activate with the flick of a<br/>&gt; switch.  Of course this would be more difficult and expensive and<br/>we<br/>&gt; probably won&apos;t bother to do it ourselves (since this will be a<br/>&gt; primarily 22-based instrument), but for future generalized<br/>keyboards<br/>&gt; it could be an option.</p><p>The key switches that we used on the GK Scalatron were also capable<br/>of being lighted.  We briefly discussed the possibility of having<br/>patterns of lights that could change along with the tuning, but we<br/>didn&apos;t pursue it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I&apos;d like to see if I can remedy this by<br/>&gt; &gt; slanting the vertical columns counter-clockwise a bit ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I look forward to seeing how this iteration turns out.  As it<br/>stands<br/>&gt; I think the design is perfectly fine, but who knows?  This may be<br/>&gt; even better.</p><p>I expect that it would definitely be better if you ever decided to<br/>use the keyboard for other tunings, 19 or meantone, for example.  The<br/>current diagram is very definitely biased toward 22 in that adjacent<br/>keys in each column differ in pitch by 1deg22 (~55 cents), but for<br/>most other tunings this interval will be larger.</p><p>I colored the extreme keys in the diagram as duplicates specific to<br/>22, but I don&apos;t think that would be a serious drawback if you used<br/>the keyboard for other tunings, because I&apos;ve found that, most of the<br/>time, playing is done by interval-patterns (as you enthusiastically<br/>observed in your test report).  My Scalatron keyboard has 31-specific<br/>coloring, but I can find the 22-ET duplicate keys without any trouble.</p><p>Anyway, we&apos;ll see what I can come up with.  This is going to take a<br/>bit more time to do than the current diagram, because figuring out<br/>the dimensions and angles will be a little more complicated.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=8515 href="#8515">ðŸ”—</a>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2005 10:45:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;George D.

The<br/>location of a particular key along the y-dimension is a direct<br/>function of the location of its pitch in the chain of fifths.</p><p>&gt; &gt;-- size and shape of<br/>&gt; &gt;keys, angles of rows and columns open to interpretation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And your choice is ovals on a plane,</p><p>On the GK Scalatron we used ellipses.  Erv Wilson&apos;s hexagons were my<br/>first choice (because the key surfaces make more efficient use of<br/>available area), but it was anticipated that there might be a problem<br/>getting the key switches aligned sufficiently parallel with one<br/>another, so for aesthetic reasons a shape having no straight edges<br/>was chosen.</p><p>Erv judged the shape of Bosanquet&apos;s keys as relatively inefficient,<br/>because the back half of each key surface can be played only by<br/>putting the finger or thumb between two adjacent keys that are higher<br/>in elevation (which can get a bit tricky).  Otherwise, the shape of<br/>the keys isn&apos;t too critical, and the &quot;best&quot; choice then probably<br/>comes down to whatever is most practical to manufacture.  I&apos;m still<br/>working on a slanting-square design for Igs (which is turning out<br/>better than I expected) that has almost exactly the same key-axis<br/>dimensions as the GK Scalatron, the biggest difference (apart from<br/>the key shape) being that the octave distance is 3 mm shorter.  Once<br/>I finish this, I&apos;ll have to send Erv a copy.</p><p>&gt; inclined slightly up<br/>&gt; and away from the player, right?</p><p>Right.  An angle of about 17 degrees allows a natural arm motion as<br/>one moves along the y-direction.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Rows of keys are right-rising, according to the precedent set by<br/>&gt; &gt;the inventor (and followed by Erv Wilson and myself in the<br/>Microzone<br/>&gt; &gt;and Scalatron, respectively).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right-rising, so that the octaves come out parallel to the body<br/>&gt; of the player?  ...</p><p>So that a line parallel to the x-axis passes through all octaves of<br/>the same pitch.  Left-rising with a fourth as generator would have<br/>been possible, but that results in different scale fingerings.  A<br/>right-rising layout allows one to use the conventional sequence of<br/>fingers for a right-hand C major scale for the meantone family of<br/>tunings.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The complicated answer would involve an explanation of the<br/>Bosanquet<br/>&gt; &gt;keyboard geometry, which I think you can find somewhere in<br/>&gt; &gt;Helmholtz/Ellis _Sensations of Tone_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really?  I have a 1950&apos;s hardcover of that, but it&apos;s in storage.<br/>&gt; But I have Bosanquet&apos;s book.</p><p>That&apos;s even better!</p><p>&gt; But I don&apos;t remember this term.</p><p>It&apos;s not in his book.  He simply named his keyboard a generalized<br/>keyboard because it possesses these very desirable characteristics:</p><p>1) It accommodates multiple tunings (as opposed to being a<br/>specialized keyboard for a single tuning);<br/>2) It does not require special fingering patterns for different keys.</p><p>Since that time, others, such as Erv Wilson, have observed that<br/>various other generating intervals may be used to define a keyboard<br/>layouts having the above characteristics.  Some of these will<br/>accommodate divisions not possible on the Bosanquet layout; e.g.,<br/>using a hemi-fifth as generator will accommodate 10, 14, and 24 (in<br/>addition to 17, 31, and 41), but not 19, 22, 29 or 46, while using a<br/>hemi-fourth as generator will accommodate 10, 14, 24 (in addition to<br/>19 and 29), but not 17, 22, 31, 41, or 46.</p><p>Since many different kinds of generalized keyboard layouts (or<br/>geometries) are possible, I employed the term &quot;Bosanquet layout&quot; to<br/>specify the one that Bosanquet originated -- the one using a fifth as<br/>the generating interval.  The Bosanquet geometry is the closest thing<br/>to a &quot;universal&quot; layout, because it accommodates more of the &quot;best&quot;<br/>divisions than any other, and it&apos;s the easiest to learn, because it<br/>allows one to retain many fingering patterns used on the conventional<br/>keyboard.</p><p>&gt; He doesn&apos;t discuss 22, but in the forward, Rasch includes a diagram<br/>&gt; from one of Bosaquet&apos;s later papers, in which the scheme had to<br/>&gt; be changed to accommodate 22.</p><p>Yes, I was rather surprised that Bosanquet overlooked 22 when I read<br/>his book, but I understand that he realized this shortly thereafter.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=8577 href="#8577">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

A 0, 8, 13, 18 tetrad feels much easier but of course isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; what&apos;s wanted.</p><p>Yeah, it is the 7 that makes it hard, but it&apos;s do-able if you don&apos;t<br/>have to add the 18 since you can use your pinky for the 13 (or the 0<br/>for the left hand)</p><p>&gt; The minor tetrad is 0, 6, 13, 17 and is worse; I have to stretch<br/>&gt; further to pick up the 6, and the close proximity of 13 and 17 makes<br/>&gt; it hard for me to hit both with my fourth and fifth fingers -- due<br/>to<br/>&gt; the difference in the lengths of those fingers -- while also<br/>reaching<br/>&gt; for the other two notes.  (And I can&apos;t reach the 6 at all if I use<br/>the<br/>&gt; third and fourth fingers for 13 and 17.)</p><p>Exactly...those minors are what kill me.</p><p>&gt; I notice the tetrads on 2 (2, 9, 15, 20 and 2, 8, 15, 19) are easier<br/>&gt; if I use 2 in the lower cyan row and the 15, 19, and 20 in the upper<br/>&gt; cyan and black rows.  The minor tetrad especially.  But crossing<br/>that<br/>&gt; many rows would make for difficult scales, I&apos;d think.</p><p>&gt; The Bosenquet-style design seems to me to be biased not so much<br/>toward<br/>&gt; diatonic scales as toward scales composed mainly of &quot;major seconds&quot;,<br/>&gt; i.e. steps of about 200 cents.</p><p>Yeah, that&apos;s a better way to put it, though most popular scales that<br/>consist primarily of major 2nds are reasonably diatonic (or<br/>hexatonic, I suppose).</p><p>&gt; (tilted to put octaves on a horizontal line and with notes added to<br/>or<br/>&gt; subtracted from columns as needed); but this not only involves a lot<br/>&gt; of duplicate notes, it also nearly doubles the octave stretch.</p><p>I think the ideal layout isn&apos;t necessarily one that would put the<br/>scale in a line, but would put the tetrads in lines (or nearly<br/>lines).  When you consider that a triad in 22 will be formed with a<br/>root, fifth, and one of 4 thirds (or a root, fourth, and one of 4<br/>sixths), and that the most consonant triads will be formed using<br/>the &quot;prime 5-limit&quot; thirds (i.e. degrees 6 and 7), a layout that puts<br/>the 9/7 supermajor (degree 8) nearly on a line from the root makes<br/>little sense.</p><p>BTW, Paul Erlich just uploaded a bunch of tentative diagrams for<br/>generalized 22-et keyboards based on several different generators,<br/>but they seem to be too small to read on my screen.

For the utonal tetrads I give two different<br/>fingerings:</p><p>G=13deg22 (Bosanquet)<br/>Octaves 6 key-widths distant<br/>Usable divisions of the octave:  12, 17, 19, 22, 26, 27, 29, 31, ...<br/>Otonal tetrad (C-E\-G-Bb):  0G, +9G, +1G, -2G<br/>Total spread:  11G<br/>Utonal tetrad (C-Eb/-G-A):  0G, +14G, +1G, +3G or 0G, -8G, +1G, +3G<br/>Total spread:  14G or 11G</p><p>G=3deg22 (Porcupine)<br/>Octaves 7.5 key-widths distant<br/>Usable divisions of the octave:  15, 22, 23, 29, 31, ...<br/>Otonal tetrad (C-E\-G-Bb):  0G, -5G, -3G, +6G<br/>Total spread:  11G<br/>Utonal tetrad (C-Eb/-G-A):  0G, 2G, -3G, +9G or 0G, 2G, -3G, +9G, -13G<br/>Total spread:  12G or 15G</p><p>Total spread for each tetrad is calculated as the difference between<br/>the largest and smallest G-values.  Considering that the total spread<br/>for the Porcupine layout is not significantly better (or worse) than<br/>the Bosanquet, the only real advantage it would seem to have is that<br/>it gives you 15-ET with transpositional invariance.  (And although I<br/>also list 31 as a &quot;usable&quot; division in a &quot;Porcupine&quot; layout, it would<br/>not be very suitable: an otonal tetrad comes up 0G, -13G, -11G, -17G.)</p><p>Getting back to 22, I looked at a 7deg22 (major-third) generator but<br/>didn&apos;t even bother to finish tabulating that one, since 3/2 is +5G<br/>and 7/4 is -10G, for a spread of 15G (which is awful).</p><p>&gt; When you consider that a triad in 22 will be formed with a<br/>&gt; root, fifth, and one of 4 thirds (or a root, fourth, and one of 4<br/>&gt; sixths), and that the most consonant triads will be formed using<br/>&gt; the &quot;prime 5-limit&quot; thirds (i.e. degrees 6 and 7), a layout that<br/>puts<br/>&gt; the 9/7 supermajor (degree 8) nearly on a line from the root makes<br/>&gt; little sense.</p><p>Hmmm, sounds like you&apos;re attaching little or no importance to the<br/>subminor (6:7:9) triad, which is not only better approximated in 22<br/>than the major triad, but also one of the most consonant chords<br/>beyond the 5-limit.

And if you ever get around to utilizing the<br/>&gt; full<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic potential of 22 by taking it to the 11-limit, you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; observe<br/>&gt; &gt; that 8 degrees also represents 11:14.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t mean to ignore the 6:7:9 triad, it&apos;s just in 22 my<br/>two<br/>&gt; favorite tonal systems (Porcupine and Decatonic) don&apos;t really make<br/>&gt; use of it.  It&apos;s still very important and we&apos;re certainly not going<br/>&gt; to ignore 22&apos;s diatonic possibilities, but we&apos;d rather make<br/>&gt; decatonics and porcupine easier at the expense of diatonics than<br/>vice-<br/>&gt; versa.

Did you try these tetrads in<br/>&gt; all of their inversions?</p><p>George, have you *looked* at the diagram that I linked to?  I don&apos;t<br/>know what your calculations are based on, but I can tell you that<br/>your statements blatantly contradict what I observe with my own two<br/>eyes.  In 22, otonal tetrad = degrees 0 7 13 18.  7 degrees =<br/>approximately the Magic generator and is immediately adjacent to 0; 6<br/>is right above it.  13 is adjacent to both 6 and 7, such that a<br/>diagonal line connecting the center points of keys 0 and 13 would<br/>pass exactly between keys 6 and 7.  18 is the only &quot;disjoint&quot; key but<br/>is still within easy reach, accessible easily in one of two places.<br/>I can post pictures highlighting this tetrad and the utonal one<br/>(which varies only slightly in fingering) if you like.  You don&apos;t<br/>even *need* a thumb to play either of them, and the 6:7:9 triad is<br/>only a tiny little bit more out of the way (but just as easy as on<br/>the Bosanquet-style keyboard).  Heck, we could even substantially<br/>enlarge those keys without sacrificing playability given how close<br/>they are.  In fact, let me post some pictures comparing otonal and<br/>utonal tetrads on some of these designs.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s my feeling that, in order<br/>&gt; for a microtonal keyboard to have any chance of getting a wider<br/>&gt; acceptance in the musical world, the diatonic things are going to<br/>&gt; have to be at least as easy as they are on a conventional keyboard,<br/>&gt; because that&apos;s the comparison that most musicians will be making<br/>from<br/>&gt; the very start.

What you really mean is that the Bosanquet design is good<br/>for the &quot;best&quot; diatonic or Pythagorean EDO&apos;s, assuming that most<br/>people who would want to play microtonally would start from the base<br/>of traditional music.  I have no problem with that; we all have our<br/>own ambitions within this field.  But I count myself a member of<br/>the &quot;no bad tunings&quot; school of thought.  Every tuning has its own<br/>infinity of possible expression, within the framework of its own<br/>unique limitations, tendencies, and colors.  I tend to actually<br/>prefer the more unusual ones, because they push my playing in a more<br/>novel direction. And I have to ask: how can you argue &quot;marketability&quot;<br/>as a reason Stevie and I should accept a design?  We&apos;re not going to<br/>mass-produce anything.  The most we&apos;re hoping for is a design that<br/>will inspire us to make novel music, which hopefully will in turn<br/>inspire others to break out of their 12-equal shells.  Who&apos;s to say<br/>what&apos;s most likely to catch on?  It all really depends on who/what<br/>produces the most compelling music, which is defined not by us as<br/>composers but by the public as listeners...and we all know how fickle<br/>and unpredictable they are.  If any of us really cared about<br/>compatibility, universality, or the mass application of a design, we<br/>probably wouldn&apos;t be here.  Yes, it would be convenient to have a new<br/>system to replace 12-equal.  But as I&apos;ve been told many a time by<br/>many people on this list, that would really be making the same<br/>mistake twice.  Variety is the goal, correct?  And while the<br/>Bosanquet design does very well for a lot of temperaments, there are<br/>others that it does very poorly for.</p><p>It is possible that the &quot;Magic&quot; design isn&apos;t the absolute best, but<br/>as far as 22-equal is concerned it&apos;s a good few steps up in<br/>versatility from Bosanquet.  In fact, both the Porcupine and<br/>Doublewide designs are improvements as well.  If you recall, our<br/>concern here is for making the best possible *22-equal* keyboard.  If<br/>it turns out to accomodate other systems, that&apos;s a plus, but it&apos;s not<br/>a requirement.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>-Igliashon</p></div><h3><a id=8649 href="#8649">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2005 5:50:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>it really seems like you like Paul&apos;s suggestions so much, almost universally and yet you keep asking o advice, then dismiss it.

Really the only thing that comes across is the<br/>approximate patterns that would be used, but I think that is a pretty<br/>fair basis to compare (though there are LOTS AND LOTS of factors I&apos;ve<br/>not gotten around to taking into account).

I.e. which design does which patterns the most<br/>ergonomically.</p><p>&gt;I would suggest though of when displaying keyboards that you might<br/>&gt;include the mapping of the harmonic material in the tuning (or since<br/>in<br/>&gt;your case the particular scales you seem to be set on ) as seen in<br/>this<br/>&gt; paper.</p><p>I suppose I could do that, but it&apos;d be a lot of work since each<br/>system based on a specific generator should have its own musical<br/>alphabet...I don&apos;t really like naming everything in 22 according to<br/>diatonic names since they don&apos;t work very well notating tonalities<br/>based on other generators.  That&apos;s kind of why I wanted to know if<br/>anyone had come up with an alphabet for Magic or Doublewide, that way<br/>I could color and name the keys to correspond to the generator that<br/>produced them which would make the most visual sense.  I mean all the<br/>diagrams in that paper you linked to are based on a roughly diatonic<br/>nomenclature with varying accidentals, whereas I&apos;m coming from the<br/>idea you should have as many letters in the alphabet as there are<br/>notes in the generator&apos;s &quot;natural&quot; scale (say A-H for porcupine, A-J<br/>for Pajara, etc. to name the obvious possibilities).

Did you try these tetrads in all of their inversions?  If<br/>so, then you might have observed that they don&apos;t fall into a nice,<br/>neat 4-finger row after all.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know what your calculations are based on, but I can tell you that<br/>&gt; your statements blatantly contradict what I observe with my own two<br/>&gt; eyes.  In 22, otonal tetrad = degrees 0 7 13 18.  7 degrees =<br/>&gt; approximately the Magic generator and is immediately adjacent to 0;<br/>6<br/>&gt; is right above it.  13 is adjacent to both 6 and 7, such that a<br/>&gt; diagonal line connecting the center points of keys 0 and 13 would<br/>&gt; pass exactly between keys 6 and 7.</p><p>Right -- no problem with these.

It only *appears* to be<br/>within easy reach because:<br/>1) It&apos;s not unreasonably far from tone 13; and<br/>2) The keys in the picture are very (unrealistically, IMO) squat in<br/>the y-dimension, which gives it a compressed appearance in that<br/>direction.  You would have trouble playing these keys with the thumb<br/>unless you were to stair-step them rather steeply (and even then I<br/>would have doubts).</p><p>If you&apos;re going to have elongated keys, it&apos;s much more useful to have<br/>the long dimension in the y-direction, but it doesn&apos;t appear that the<br/>Magic geometry would allow that.  (And the same goes for<br/>Srutal/Pajara and Doublewide.)  Paul has come up with some clever and<br/>imaginative layouts, but I fail to see how any of them would be<br/>better than the Bosanquet geometry.</p><p>&gt; I can post pictures highlighting this tetrad and the utonal one<br/>&gt; (which varies only slightly in fingering) if you like.  You don&apos;t<br/>&gt; even *need* a thumb to play either of them, and the 6:7:9 triad is<br/>&gt; only a tiny little bit more out of the way (but just as easy as on<br/>&gt; the Bosanquet-style keyboard).  Heck, we could even substantially<br/>&gt; enlarge those keys without sacrificing playability given how close<br/>&gt; they are.  In fact, let me post some pictures comparing otonal and<br/>&gt; utonal tetrads on some of these designs.</p><p>I&apos;m looking at them as I write this.  If you draw a line parallel to<br/>the x-axis between two keys for tone 0 (an octave apart), you&apos;ll<br/>notice how much of a reach tone 18 really is, particularly in the<br/>direction you specified for playing this chord.  Essentially what you<br/>have are 3 tones reasonably lateral from one another and the fourth<br/>at a relatively large y-displacement from the other 3.  With the<br/>Bosanquet layout you have the same thing (actually a little better in<br/>terms of generators!), with tones 0, 13, and 18 in a lateral<br/>placement (better than Magic) and tone 7 with a larger y-displacement<br/>(but smaller than Magic, in terms of generators):</p><p>G=13deg22 (Bosanquet)<br/>Octaves 6 key-widths distant<br/>Otonal tetrad (C-E\-G-Bb):  0G, +9G, +1G, -2G<br/>Total spread:  11G<br/>Utonal tetrad (C-Eb/-G-A):  0G, +14G, +1G, +3G or 0G, -8G, +1G, +3G<br/>Total spread:  14G or 11G</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s my feeling that, in order<br/>&gt; &gt; for a microtonal keyboard to have any chance of getting a wider<br/>&gt; &gt; acceptance in the musical world, the diatonic things are going to<br/>&gt; &gt; have to be at least as easy as they are on a conventional<br/>keyboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; because that&apos;s the comparison that most musicians will be making<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; the very start.  As far as I&apos;m concerned, that, plus the fact<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; the Bosanquet layout accommodates the greatest number of<br/>the &quot;best&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; octave divisions, puts it way ahead of anything else in terms of<br/>&gt; &gt; usefulness and probable success -- particularly since I believe<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; reducing the key size would make the technique a bit easier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George, with all due respect, I disagree with your use of the<br/>&gt; term &quot;best&quot; in reference to certain EDO&apos;s, and I think many on this<br/>&gt; list would be inclined to concur.  &quot;Best&quot; is all too relative to be<br/>&gt; used here.  What you really mean is that the Bosanquet design is<br/>good<br/>&gt; for the &quot;best&quot; diatonic or Pythagorean EDO&apos;s, assuming that most<br/>&gt; people who would want to play microtonally would start from the<br/>base<br/>&gt; of traditional music.</p><p>By &quot;best&quot; (notice that I did put the word in quotes) I mean those<br/>divisions that most accurately approximate the small-number ratios of<br/>just intonation (especially above the 5-limit) and which thereby<br/>offer the widest range of consonance to dissonance.  This does not<br/>necessarily restrict one to an expansion of traditional harmony.  For<br/>example, 17 (one of my favorites) offers 13-limit harmony *without*<br/>the 5-consonances.</p><p>Divisions such as 15-ET were, to the best of my knowledge, never<br/>seriously considered for harmony until Easley Blackwood wrote his<br/>electronic etudes around 1975.  In many different cultures and<br/>localities, over many centuries, those divisions that have generally<br/>been considered &quot;best&quot; are those that represent the fifth, 2:3, (and<br/>after that, the next most consonant ratios) most accurately, an<br/>observation that I don&apos;t consider &quot;all too relative.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I have no problem with that; we all have our<br/>&gt; own ambitions within this field.  But I count myself a member of<br/>&gt; the &quot;no bad tunings&quot; school of thought.  Every tuning has its own<br/>&gt; infinity of possible expression, within the framework of its own<br/>&gt; unique limitations, tendencies, and colors.  I tend to actually<br/>&gt; prefer the more unusual ones, because they push my playing in a<br/>more<br/>&gt; novel direction.</p><p>While I understand (and somewhat agree) with your opinion that there<br/>are no &quot;bad&quot; tunings, I would say that some are &quot;better&quot; than others<br/>(for whatever purpose).  ;-)  -- but each to one&apos;s own taste.</p><p>&gt; And I have to ask: how can you argue &quot;marketability&quot;<br/>&gt; as a reason Stevie and I should accept a design?  We&apos;re not going<br/>to<br/>&gt; mass-produce anything.</p><p>That thought was presented as part of my response to your objection:</p><p>&lt;&lt;   &gt; It would be learnable in time, but the whole point of having a<br/>&gt; &gt; generalized keyboard is that it&apos;s supposed to be EASY, and this<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; definitely not.</p><p>The whole point is that it&apos;s supposed to be EASIER than a<br/>heterogeneous layout.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt; The most we&apos;re hoping for is a design that<br/>&gt; will inspire us to make novel music, which hopefully will in turn<br/>&gt; inspire others to break out of their 12-equal shells.  Who&apos;s to say<br/>&gt; what&apos;s most likely to catch on?  It all really depends on who/what<br/>&gt; produces the most compelling music, which is defined not by us as<br/>&gt; composers but by the public as listeners...and we all know how<br/>fickle<br/>&gt; and unpredictable they are.</p><p>Very true!</p><p>&gt; If any of us really cared about<br/>&gt; compatibility, universality, or the mass application of a design,<br/>we<br/>&gt; probably wouldn&apos;t be here.</p><p>I can confidently disagree with you on that point, because that&apos;s one<br/>of the main reasons I&apos;m here.</p><p>I, for one, would dearly love to see alternate tunings break out of<br/>its niche and begin to catch on with a wider group of listeners.<br/>That, in turn, would bring more musicians into our midst who would<br/>desire to get involved.  First thing they ask: what tuning(s) do I<br/>use?  If I commit to one and learn an instrument and notation for it,<br/>what if I decide to use a different sort of tuning later on?  Will I<br/>need another instrument?  Will the other notation have anything in<br/>common with the first one, or will they conflict?  In other words,<br/>are there already any standard ways of doing things, or is everyone<br/>pretty much doing one&apos;s own thing, which means that I&apos;m going to have<br/>to sort through it all and perhaps (re-)invent my own wheel before I<br/>get around to making any music.</p><p>If we aren&apos;t ready with some acceptable answers to these questions,<br/>then we&apos;re going to be caught with our collective pants down if<br/>ever/whenever) this happens, and many are going to be turned away<br/>with the idea that we haven&apos;t been able to get it together.  So I&apos;m<br/>determined to do my best to ensure that others aren&apos;t confronted with<br/>the same obstacles that I&apos;ve had to face over the past 42 years.</p><p>Sure, you can go ahead and design your own keyboard or whatever, but<br/>with a standard generalized solution you&apos;re not required to do that.<br/>Or with a generalized microtonal notation, instrumentalists wouldn&apos;t<br/>be required to learn a new system for every tuning (or even multiple<br/>systems for the same tuning, as has often been the case).  In case<br/>you&apos;re not aware of it yet, Dave Keenan and I have spent the past 3<br/>years on such a notation:</p><p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/</a></p><p>(And please check out the *mythical introduction* for a discussion of<br/>relevant issues.)</p><p>&gt; Yes, it would be convenient to have a new<br/>&gt; system to replace 12-equal.  But as I&apos;ve been told many a time by<br/>&gt; many people on this list, that would really be making the same<br/>&gt; mistake twice.  Variety is the goal, correct?  And while the<br/>&gt; Bosanquet design does very well for a lot of temperaments, there<br/>are<br/>&gt; others that it does very poorly for.</p><p>But I still don&apos;t believe that 22 is one of them.  :-)</p><p>&gt; It is possible that the &quot;Magic&quot; design isn&apos;t the absolute best, but<br/>&gt; as far as 22-equal is concerned it&apos;s a good few steps up in<br/>&gt; versatility from Bosanquet.  In fact, both the Porcupine and<br/>&gt; Doublewide designs are improvements as well.  If you recall, our<br/>&gt; concern here is for making the best possible *22-equal* keyboard.<br/>If<br/>&gt; it turns out to accomodate other systems, that&apos;s a plus, but it&apos;s<br/>not<br/>&gt; a requirement.</p><p>Having said about as much as (and perhaps more than) I ought, let me<br/>wish you and Stevie well in your quest for the best.  Although I&apos;ll<br/>continue to follow the developments in this thread, I need to get<br/>back to other things (such as working on my latest composition), so<br/>I&apos;ll chime in only if asked for my opinion, or if there&apos;s something<br/>important that hasn&apos;t already been said.

Did you try these tetrads in all of their inversions?  If<br/>&gt; so, then you might have observed that they don&apos;t fall into a nice,<br/>&gt; neat 4-finger row after all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; know what your calculations are based on, but I can tell you that<br/>&gt; &gt; your statements blatantly contradict what I observe with my own<br/>two<br/>&gt; &gt; eyes.  In 22, otonal tetrad = degrees 0 7 13 18.  7 degrees =<br/>&gt; &gt; approximately the Magic generator and is immediately adjacent to<br/>0;<br/>&gt; 6<br/>&gt; &gt; is right above it.  13 is adjacent to both 6 and 7, such that a<br/>&gt; &gt; diagonal line connecting the center points of keys 0 and 13 would<br/>&gt; &gt; pass exactly between keys 6 and 7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right -- no problem with these.  As my evaluation indicates, they<br/>are<br/>&gt; 0, 1, and 5 generators distant from tone 0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G=7deg22 (Magic)<br/>&gt; Octaves 7 key-widths distant<br/>&gt; Otonal tetrad (C-E\-G-Bb):  0G, +1G, +5G, -10G or 0G, +1G, +5G, +12G<br/>&gt; Total spread:  15G or 13G<br/>&gt; Utonal tetrad (C-Eb/-G-A):  0G, +4G, +5G, -7G<br/>&gt; Total spread:  12G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 18 is the only &quot;disjoint&quot; key but<br/>&gt; &gt; is still within easy reach, accessible easily in one of two<br/>&gt; places.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This one&apos;s the problem -- in the chain of generators:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 10 11 12<br/>&gt; 0 .7 14 21 .6 13 20 .5 12 19 .4 11 18<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s +12 or -10 (not shown above) in the chain, which is about as<br/>far<br/>&gt; displaced in the y-direction as possible.  It only *appears* to be<br/>&gt; within easy reach because:<br/>&gt; 1) It&apos;s not unreasonably far from tone 13; and<br/>&gt; 2) The keys in the picture are very (unrealistically, IMO) squat in<br/>&gt; the y-dimension, which gives it a compressed appearance in that<br/>&gt; direction.  You would have trouble playing these keys with the<br/>thumb<br/>&gt; unless you were to stair-step them rather steeply (and even then I<br/>&gt; would have doubts).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re going to have elongated keys, it&apos;s much more useful to<br/>have<br/>&gt; the long dimension in the y-direction, but it doesn&apos;t appear that<br/>the<br/>&gt; Magic geometry would allow that.  (And the same goes for<br/>&gt; Srutal/Pajara and Doublewide.)  Paul has come up with some clever<br/>and<br/>&gt; imaginative layouts, but I fail to see how any of them would be<br/>&gt; better than the Bosanquet geometry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can post pictures highlighting this tetrad and the utonal one<br/>&gt; &gt; (which varies only slightly in fingering) if you like.  You don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; even *need* a thumb to play either of them, and the 6:7:9 triad<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; only a tiny little bit more out of the way (but just as easy as<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; the Bosanquet-style keyboard).  Heck, we could even substantially<br/>&gt; &gt; enlarge those keys without sacrificing playability given how<br/>close<br/>&gt; &gt; they are.  In fact, let me post some pictures comparing otonal<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; utonal tetrads on some of these designs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m looking at them as I write this.  If you draw a line parallel<br/>to<br/>&gt; the x-axis between two keys for tone 0 (an octave apart), you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; notice how much of a reach tone 18 really is, particularly in the<br/>&gt; direction you specified for playing this chord.  Essentially what<br/>you<br/>&gt; have are 3 tones reasonably lateral from one another and the fourth<br/>&gt; at a relatively large y-displacement from the other 3.  With the<br/>&gt; Bosanquet layout you have the same thing (actually a little better<br/>in<br/>&gt; terms of generators!), with tones 0, 13, and 18 in a lateral<br/>&gt; placement (better than Magic) and tone 7 with a larger y-<br/>displacement<br/>&gt; (but smaller than Magic, in terms of generators):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G=13deg22 (Bosanquet)<br/>&gt; Octaves 6 key-widths distant<br/>&gt; Otonal tetrad (C-E\-G-Bb):  0G, +9G, +1G, -2G<br/>&gt; Total spread:  11G<br/>&gt; Utonal tetrad (C-Eb/-G-A):  0G, +14G, +1G, +3G or 0G, -8G, +1G, +3G<br/>&gt; Total spread:  14G or 11G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s my feeling that, in order<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for a microtonal keyboard to have any chance of getting a wider<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; acceptance in the musical world, the diatonic things are going<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; have to be at least as easy as they are on a conventional<br/>&gt; keyboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because that&apos;s the comparison that most musicians will be<br/>making<br/>&gt; from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the very start.  As far as I&apos;m concerned, that, plus the fact<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Bosanquet layout accommodates the greatest number of<br/>&gt; the &quot;best&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octave divisions, puts it way ahead of anything else in terms<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; usefulness and probable success -- particularly since I believe<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reducing the key size would make the technique a bit easier.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; George, with all due respect, I disagree with your use of the<br/>&gt; &gt; term &quot;best&quot; in reference to certain EDO&apos;s, and I think many on<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; list would be inclined to concur.  &quot;Best&quot; is all too relative to<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; used here.  What you really mean is that the Bosanquet design is<br/>&gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; for the &quot;best&quot; diatonic or Pythagorean EDO&apos;s, assuming that most<br/>&gt; &gt; people who would want to play microtonally would start from the<br/>&gt; base<br/>&gt; &gt; of traditional music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By &quot;best&quot; (notice that I did put the word in quotes) I mean those<br/>&gt; divisions that most accurately approximate the small-number ratios<br/>of<br/>&gt; just intonation (especially above the 5-limit) and which thereby<br/>&gt; offer the widest range of consonance to dissonance.  This does not<br/>&gt; necessarily restrict one to an expansion of traditional harmony.<br/>For<br/>&gt; example, 17 (one of my favorites) offers 13-limit harmony *without*<br/>&gt; the 5-consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Divisions such as 15-ET were, to the best of my knowledge, never<br/>&gt; seriously considered for harmony until Easley Blackwood wrote his<br/>&gt; electronic etudes around 1975.  In many different cultures and<br/>&gt; localities, over many centuries, those divisions that have<br/>generally<br/>&gt; been considered &quot;best&quot; are those that represent the fifth, 2:3,<br/>(and<br/>&gt; after that, the next most consonant ratios) most accurately, an<br/>&gt; observation that I don&apos;t consider &quot;all too relative.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have no problem with that; we all have our<br/>&gt; &gt; own ambitions within this field.  But I count myself a member of<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;no bad tunings&quot; school of thought.  Every tuning has its own<br/>&gt; &gt; infinity of possible expression, within the framework of its own<br/>&gt; &gt; unique limitations, tendencies, and colors.  I tend to actually<br/>&gt; &gt; prefer the more unusual ones, because they push my playing in a<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; novel direction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I understand (and somewhat agree) with your opinion that<br/>there<br/>&gt; are no &quot;bad&quot; tunings, I would say that some are &quot;better&quot; than<br/>others<br/>&gt; (for whatever purpose).  ;-)  -- but each to one&apos;s own taste.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I have to ask: how can you argue &quot;marketability&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; as a reason Stevie and I should accept a design?  We&apos;re not going<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; mass-produce anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That thought was presented as part of my response to your objection:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;   &gt; It would be learnable in time, but the whole point of having<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; generalized keyboard is that it&apos;s supposed to be EASY, and this<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The whole point is that it&apos;s supposed to be EASIER than a<br/>&gt; heterogeneous layout.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The most we&apos;re hoping for is a design that<br/>&gt; &gt; will inspire us to make novel music, which hopefully will in turn<br/>&gt; &gt; inspire others to break out of their 12-equal shells.  Who&apos;s to<br/>say<br/>&gt; &gt; what&apos;s most likely to catch on?  It all really depends on<br/>who/what<br/>&gt; &gt; produces the most compelling music, which is defined not by us as<br/>&gt; &gt; composers but by the public as listeners...and we all know how<br/>&gt; fickle<br/>&gt; &gt; and unpredictable they are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very true!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If any of us really cared about<br/>&gt; &gt; compatibility, universality, or the mass application of a design,<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; probably wouldn&apos;t be here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can confidently disagree with you on that point, because that&apos;s<br/>one<br/>&gt; of the main reasons I&apos;m here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I, for one, would dearly love to see alternate tunings break out of<br/>&gt; its niche and begin to catch on with a wider group of listeners.<br/>&gt; That, in turn, would bring more musicians into our midst who would<br/>&gt; desire to get involved.  First thing they ask: what tuning(s) do I<br/>&gt; use?  If I commit to one and learn an instrument and notation for<br/>it,<br/>&gt; what if I decide to use a different sort of tuning later on?  Will<br/>I<br/>&gt; need another instrument?  Will the other notation have anything in<br/>&gt; common with the first one, or will they conflict?  In other words,<br/>&gt; are there already any standard ways of doing things, or is everyone<br/>&gt; pretty much doing one&apos;s own thing, which means that I&apos;m going to<br/>have<br/>&gt; to sort through it all and perhaps (re-)invent my own wheel before<br/>I<br/>&gt; get around to making any music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we aren&apos;t ready with some acceptable answers to these questions,<br/>&gt; then we&apos;re going to be caught with our collective pants down if<br/>&gt; ever/whenever) this happens, and many are going to be turned away<br/>&gt; with the idea that we haven&apos;t been able to get it together.  So I&apos;m<br/>&gt; determined to do my best to ensure that others aren&apos;t confronted<br/>with<br/>&gt; the same obstacles that I&apos;ve had to face over the past 42 years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, you can go ahead and design your own keyboard or whatever,<br/>but<br/>&gt; with a standard generalized solution you&apos;re not required to do<br/>that.<br/>&gt; Or with a generalized microtonal notation, instrumentalists<br/>wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; be required to learn a new system for every tuning (or even<br/>multiple<br/>&gt; systems for the same tuning, as has often been the case).  In case<br/>&gt; you&apos;re not aware of it yet, Dave Keenan and I have spent the past 3<br/>&gt; years on such a notation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (And please check out the *mythical introduction* for a discussion<br/>of<br/>&gt; relevant issues.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, it would be convenient to have a new<br/>&gt; &gt; system to replace 12-equal.  But as I&apos;ve been told many a time by<br/>&gt; &gt; many people on this list, that would really be making the same<br/>&gt; &gt; mistake twice.  Variety is the goal, correct?  And while the<br/>&gt; &gt; Bosanquet design does very well for a lot of temperaments, there<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; others that it does very poorly for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I still don&apos;t believe that 22 is one of them.  :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is possible that the &quot;Magic&quot; design isn&apos;t the absolute best,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; as far as 22-equal is concerned it&apos;s a good few steps up in<br/>&gt; &gt; versatility from Bosanquet.  In fact, both the Porcupine and<br/>&gt; &gt; Doublewide designs are improvements as well.  If you recall, our<br/>&gt; &gt; concern here is for making the best possible *22-equal*<br/>keyboard.<br/>&gt; If<br/>&gt; &gt; it turns out to accomodate other systems, that&apos;s a plus, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; a requirement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having said about as much as (and perhaps more than) I ought, let<br/>me<br/>&gt; wish you and Stevie well in your quest for the best.  Although I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; continue to follow the developments in this thread, I need to get<br/>&gt; back to other things (such as working on my latest composition), so<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll chime in only if asked for my opinion, or if there&apos;s something<br/>&gt; important that hasn&apos;t already been said.

The minor tetrad especially.  But crossing that<br/>&gt;many rows would make for difficult scales, I&apos;d think.</p><p>All the more reason to add more duplicates, which I believe George<br/>is in favor of?</p><p>&gt;&gt; It seems that your current design, while not<br/>&gt;&gt; prohibitive of different scales, is fairly biased toward diatonic<br/>&gt;&gt; scales, favoring meantone temperaments and scales with 7-note LLsLLLs<br/>&gt;&gt; scales.  Do you have any different types of mapping up your sleeve<br/>&gt;&gt; that might be more suited to a decatonic or &quot;porcuponic&quot; approach?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The Bosenquet-style design seems to me to be biased not so much toward<br/>&gt;diatonic scales as toward scales composed mainly of &quot;major seconds&quot;,<br/>&gt;i.e. steps of about 200 cents.  Scales with smaller intervals then<br/>&gt;necessarily have notes fairly far out of line with one another.  I<br/>&gt;guess I could imagine a Bosenquet-like layout with adjacent notes<br/>&gt;differing by something closer to 100 cents, with a 22-note layout<br/>&gt;looking very roughly something like (view this in a monospaced font)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                  1  3  5  7 ...<br/>&gt;                  13 14 16 18 20  0  2  4  6 ...<br/>&gt;    1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19 21  1  3  5 ...<br/>&gt;    0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20<br/>&gt;   21  1  3  5  7  9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(tilted to put octaves on a horizontal line and with notes added to or<br/>&gt;subtracted from columns as needed); but this not only involves a lot<br/>&gt;of duplicate notes, it also nearly doubles the octave stretch.</p><p>Yeah, seems maybe 2 and 3 or more would be advisable.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8693 href="#8693">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2005 9:30:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Igliashon, I already replied to Paul off-list before I read your<br/>&gt;message, and I&apos;ll forward a copy to you.

How hard would it<br/>be<br/>&gt; for you to prepare diagrams of such keyboards?</p><p>Determining appropriate angles and dimensions for a &quot;pretty and<br/>proper&quot; keyboard layout in which all of the rows or columns slant is<br/>pretty time-consuming, involving a bit of trial and error,<br/>particularly if you&apos;re constrained to using a particular (i.e.,<br/>square) key shape.  In this particular case I&apos;ve taken the time to do<br/>it, because I felt very strongly that Igs and Stevie were heading in<br/>the wrong direction.</p><p>But I guess if you only need something quick and dirty to experiment<br/>with, it might not be too hard to do a few of these.  My main problem<br/>is that my time is going to be very limited the rest of this year, so<br/>it might be better to tell you how I prepared these diagrams (without<br/>using any special or expensive software) so that you or Igs could do<br/>them yourselves.  (As Terry Pratchett put it, &quot;Build a man a fire and<br/>you&apos;ll keep him warm the rest of the day; set a man on fire and<br/>you&apos;ll keep him warm the rest of his life.&quot;  ;-)</p><p>I believe that, in general, you&apos;ll find that any transpositionally<br/>invariant keyboard in which the octaves are laterally positioned at a<br/>reasonable distance will be fairly easy to use, as long as there are<br/>a sufficient number of duplicate keys.  The only application I&apos;ve<br/>found in which the requirements are more critical is for the left<br/>hand of an accordion, where the thumb cannot be used (making cross-<br/>over fingering both clumsy and difficult), in which case the solution<br/>is a special arrangement of buttons that works well for the left hand<br/>(but would work very poorly for the right hand, unless it were mirror-<br/>imaged).</p><p>&gt; Like you yourself said<br/>&gt; on this list last year, 4 different tuning systems can and should<br/>be<br/>&gt; enough for a lifetime of exploration, so I really think we can&apos;t<br/>give<br/>&gt; the particularities of systems like 22 and 15 short shrift here.</p><p>By &quot;4 different tuning systems&quot; I meant 4 *completely* different<br/>*tunings*.  By my reckoning, Superpythagorean, Porcupine, and<br/>Decatonic in 22-ET count as one, not three.  [Paul subsequently<br/>replied that he agreed with me about this.]  Other possibilities<br/>would be a tuning in the meantone family or a JI set (or some sort of<br/>temperament very close to just).  Sure, one alternate tuning could<br/>last you a lifetime or more, but having the experience of working<br/>with several tunings gives you the opportunity to take time off from<br/>one tuning to work with another and then return afresh to the first<br/>with a broader perspective -- as when one spends a few weeks in a<br/>foreign land, upon returning taking notice of things about which one<br/>was previously unaware.</p><p>I would not be one to encourage the building of alternate keyboards<br/>not based on the Bosanquet (fifth-generator) geometry for tunings<br/>that can already be accommodated on the Bosanqet, for a couple of<br/>reasons:</p><p>1) One would end up investing time, money, and effort building and<br/>learning a keyboard that very likely no one else will ever have.  It<br/>would be wiser to invest in the microtonal keyboard most likely to<br/>become the standard one (provided, of course, that it&apos;s a very good<br/>one).</p><p>2) There are important tunings that would not be accommodated on<br/>these alternates.  You think, perhaps, that you can always build<br/>another keyboard, but then you get married, start a family, and then<br/>wonder when you&apos;ll ever have the time, money, and energy to go<br/>through all of that again.  ...</p><p>Personal circumstances do not always turn out the way you<br/>expect.  ... Through all of this I&apos;m often surprised that I even have<br/>a chance to think about microtonality (I&apos;m trying to make some<br/>headway on a new composition) -- but then I count myself fortunate in<br/>that I haven&apos;t had to experience anything on the order of a tsunami.</p><p>Anyway, getting back to the subject, I wouldn&apos;t consider 15-ET<br/>important enough to warrant a non-Bosanquet keyboard.  If you&apos;ve<br/>already gone ahead and built the Bosanquet, you can, in a pinch, use<br/>8deg15 (a narrow false 5th) as the generating interval and have<br/>transpositional invariance.  A lot of the intervals may turn up as<br/>rather strange vectors, but it will be playable.</p><p>I don&apos;t even consider 72-ET important enough to warrant a non-<br/>Bosanquet keyboard, even my decimal keyboard design (at least at the<br/>present time).  If you want Blackjack, Canasta, or Stud-loco, you can<br/>play them in a 31 or 41 mapping on the Bosanquet.</p><p>Just some advice from someone who&apos;s been there and done that (which<br/>you may pass along to Igs and Stevie, if you think it will be<br/>helpful).</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=8724 href="#8724">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

It&apos;s often easy for me to see that the loss of not considering Erv&apos;s advice is great, but the investment of musical-intellectual time and energy into the program is simply too far advanced to start again.

This message got lost in my outbox when<br/>I was at NAMM.  But I&apos;ve updated it...</p><p>&gt;&gt; I never know what the term &apos;Bosanquet geometry&apos; meant.  Is it<br/>&gt;&gt; just that fifths should.... do what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A Bosanquet keyboard geometry or layout is simply a generalized<br/>&gt;keyboard that uses the fifth as the generating interval.  The<br/>&gt;location of a particular key along the y-dimension is a direct<br/>&gt;function of the location of its pitch in the chain of fifths.</p><p>Aha!</p><p>&gt;Erv judged the shape of Bosanquet&apos;s keys as relatively inefficient,<br/>&gt;because the back half of each key surface can be played only by<br/>&gt;putting the finger or thumb between two adjacent keys that are<br/>&gt;higher in elevation (which can get a bit tricky).</p><p>The multi-tiered aspect does offer tactile feedback about what&apos;s<br/>going on (reduces the symmetry of the keyboard).  And fitting<br/>fingers between keys on the piano hasn&apos;t been fatal to the art,<br/>though piano technique doesn&apos;t involve turning the hand (at all)<br/>or curling fingers (as much) as any generalized design is likely<br/>to require.</p><p>The rectangular aspect potentially gives more ways to reach a<br/>multi-note target (chord or sequence).  In the simplest case...</p><p>|     |     |          |   |   |   |<br/>|  a  |  c  |          |   |   |   |<br/>|     |     |          |   |   |   |<br/> \   / \   /    vs.    | d |---| f |<br/>  \ /   \ /            |   |   |   |<br/>   |  b  |             |   | e |   |<br/>   |     |             |   |   |   |</p><p>...without turning the hand, curling the fingers or using the<br/>thumb, d &amp; e can be reached from more places than a &amp; b.  The<br/>player can sustain d &amp; e while moving his hand into better position<br/>for the next target.  Rectangular keys do have to be made thinner,<br/>but with multiple tiers we make it easier to select subsets of the<br/>keyboard, even if the keys are thin (by creating empty holes around<br/>targets).</p><p>Another approach is to ask which motions are faster and/or more<br/>accurate and/or less stressful to the body: finger extensions/curls,<br/>or depressing a sequence of different fingers?  Clearly the latter.<br/>This suggests our keys should be long and narrow rather than<br/>short and fat.</p><p>Michael Zarkey, who built a multi-tiered 19-tone harpsichord<br/>based on Erv&apos;s design (like the layout on the left), felt that for<br/>muli-tiered keyboards at least, rectangular was better.  After<br/>playing his instrument for 2-3 hours, I agreed.  But I could have<br/>been wrong (2-3 hours ain&apos;t nothin&apos;).</p><p>Another approach would be just to make tiny round buttons really<br/>close together, like the bass keys on an accordion.  Any reason<br/>why this wouldn&apos;t be optimal?  Does it exile the thumb?</p><p>&gt;&gt; inclined slightly up and away from the player, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Right.  An angle of about 17 degrees allows a natural arm motion as<br/>&gt;one moves along the y-direction.</p><p>Anything that angles my wrists up/back (computer mice, keyboard racks<br/>with an inclined upper tier) winds up putting the hurt on my tendons.<br/>It seems to me that Derek Sherinian has the right idea, angling his<br/>keyboards down and away from the player, so the hands can be flat with<br/>the arms when playing in a standing position.</p><p>How do you move your hands along y?  From the shoulders only, or<br/>with elbows too?  I don&apos;t see how the arm motion would be an arc...</p><p>&gt;&gt; But I have Bosanquet&apos;s book.<br/>//<br/>&gt;&gt; But I don&apos;t remember this term.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s not in his book.  He simply named his keyboard a generalized<br/>&gt;keyboard because it possesses these very desirable characteristics:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) It accommodates multiple tunings (as opposed to being a<br/>&gt;specialized keyboard for a single tuning);<br/>&gt;2) It does not require special fingering patterns for different keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since that time, others, such as Erv Wilson, have observed that<br/>&gt;various other generating intervals may be used to define a keyboard<br/>&gt;layouts having the above characteristics.  Some of these will<br/>&gt;accommodate divisions not possible on the Bosanquet layout; e.g.,<br/>&gt;using a hemi-fifth as generator will accommodate 10, 14, and 24 (in<br/>&gt;addition to 17, 31, and 41), but not 19, 22, 29 or 46, while using a<br/>&gt;hemi-fourth as generator will accommodate 10, 14, 24 (in addition to<br/>&gt;19 and 29), but not 17, 22, 31, 41, or 46.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since many different kinds of generalized keyboard layouts (or<br/>&gt;geometries) are possible, I employed the term &quot;Bosanquet layout&quot; to<br/>&gt;specify the one that Bosanquet originated -- the one using a fifth as<br/>&gt;the generating interval.  The Bosanquet geometry is the closest thing<br/>&gt;to a &quot;universal&quot; layout, because it accommodates more of the &quot;best&quot;<br/>&gt;divisions than any other, and it&apos;s the easiest to learn, because it<br/>&gt;allows one to retain many fingering patterns used on the conventional<br/>&gt;keyboard.</p><p>Aha.

Don&apos;t guitarists have to<br/>do that as well, in order to play chords?</p><p>&gt; The rectangular aspect potentially gives more ways to reach a<br/>&gt; multi-note target (chord or sequence).

The<br/>&gt; player can sustain d &amp; e while moving his hand into better position<br/>&gt; for the next target.  Rectangular keys do have to be made thinner,<br/>&gt; but with multiple tiers we make it easier to select subsets of the<br/>&gt; keyboard, even if the keys are thin (by creating empty holes around<br/>&gt; targets).</p><p>There is another a trade-off:  Rectangular keys will have 2 adjacent<br/>neighbors on each side, while hexagonal keys will have 3.</p><p>&gt; Another approach is to ask which motions are faster and/or more<br/>&gt; accurate and/or less stressful to the body: finger extensions/curls,<br/>&gt; or depressing a sequence of different fingers?  Clearly the latter.<br/>&gt; This suggests our keys should be long and narrow rather than<br/>&gt; short and fat.</p><p>Another trade-off with long and narrow keys is that distances in the<br/>y-direction will tend to be farther, which seems to negate much of<br/>the advantages offered by their length.</p><p>&gt; Michael Zarkey, who built a multi-tiered 19-tone harpsichord<br/>&gt; based on Erv&apos;s design (like the layout on the left), felt that for<br/>&gt; muli-tiered keyboards at least, rectangular was better.  After<br/>&gt; playing his instrument for 2-3 hours, I agreed.  But I could have<br/>&gt; been wrong (2-3 hours ain&apos;t nothin&apos;).</p><p>I have found that shorter &amp; fatter keys eliminate the need for<br/>multiple tiers, so the keys (or buttons) can all be in a single<br/>plane, as on the Scalatron and left hand of the accordion.</p><p>&gt; Another approach would be just to make tiny round buttons really<br/>&gt; close together, like the bass keys on an accordion.

Don&apos;t guitarists have to<br/>&gt;do that as well, in order to play chords?</p><p>Dunno.  There&apos;s nothing wrong with it, but it is a different<br/>type of hand-use.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another approach is to ask which motions are faster and/or more<br/>&gt;&gt; accurate and/or less stressful to the body: finger extensions/curls,<br/>&gt;&gt; or depressing a sequence of different fingers?  Clearly the latter.<br/>&gt;&gt; This suggests our keys should be long and narrow rather than<br/>&gt;&gt; short and fat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Another trade-off with long and narrow keys is that distances in the<br/>&gt;y-direction will tend to be farther, which seems to negate much of<br/>&gt;the advantages offered by their length.</p><p>It&apos;s just like, where do you want the extra notes: in front and<br/>back, or left and right?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Michael Zarkey, who built a multi-tiered 19-tone harpsichord<br/>&gt;&gt; based on Erv&apos;s design (like the layout on the left), felt that for<br/>&gt;&gt; muli-tiered keyboards at least, rectangular was better.  After<br/>&gt;&gt; playing his instrument for 2-3 hours, I agreed.  But I could have<br/>&gt;&gt; been wrong (2-3 hours ain&apos;t nothin&apos;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have found that shorter &amp; fatter keys eliminate the need for<br/>&gt;multiple tiers, so the keys (or buttons) can all be in a single<br/>&gt;plane, as on the Scalatron and left hand of the accordion.</p><p>Yes, my guess is that round/hex keys work best on a plane, though<br/>I&apos;ve never actually played a planar hex keyboard (aside from<br/>Accordion left hand).  Note: In 2001, I asked Scott Hackleman if<br/>the multi-tiered aspect was a problem on his hex-keyed clavichord,<br/>and he said no, he was absolutely satisfied with his keyboard.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another approach would be just to make tiny round buttons really<br/>&gt;&gt; close together, like the bass keys on an accordion.

It seems to me that Derek Sherinian has the right idea,<br/>&gt;&gt; angling his keyboards down and away from the player, so the hands<br/>&gt;&gt; can be flat with the arms when playing in a standing position.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How do you move your hands along y?  From the shoulders only, or<br/>&gt;&gt; with elbows too?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Both shoulders and elbows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t see how the arm motion would be an arc...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s not an arc; it&apos;s a flat plane inclined around 17 degrees.  If<br/>&gt;you put your hands into playing position and then move your arms<br/>&gt;forward in a natural, comfortable manner without changing the angle<br/>&gt;at which your hands are positioned (without any wrist movement), your<br/>&gt;fingertips should remain at a fairly constant distance above the<br/>&gt;plane of the keyboard.</p><p>Hmm... if I move my arms at the shoulder with my elbows and<br/>wrists locked, my hands move in an arc.

From the shoulders only, or<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with elbows too?<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Both shoulders and elbows.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t see how the arm motion would be an arc...<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;It&apos;s not an arc; it&apos;s a flat plane inclined around 17 degrees.  If<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;you put your hands into playing position and then move your arms<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;forward in a natural, comfortable manner without changing the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;angle at which your hands are positioned (without any wrist<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; movement), your fingertips should remain at a fairly constant<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;distance above the plane of the keyboard.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hmm... if I move my arms at the shoulder with my elbows and<br/>&gt;&gt; wrists locked, my hands move in an arc.  If I use my elbows too,<br/>&gt;&gt; I can get my hands to move along a plane at any angle, but<br/>&gt;&gt; parallel to the floor seems most natural.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It sounds like the keyboard would be at a rather low height -- no<br/>&gt;higher than your waist.  The 17-degree determination was made seated<br/>&gt;in front of the actual cabinet in which the Scalatron generalized<br/>&gt;keyboard was going to be built, which was about the same height as a<br/>&gt;piano keyboard.  Carl, do you always play the piano while standing?</p><p>Never.  I try to sit with my thighs and forearms parallel to the<br/>floor.
