It sure does not just for 22TET, but for 17TET (e.g. dissonant major third...) as well as for 19TET (e.g. major third too small, semitone too large...). But I don&apos;t think this is a problem. Sooner or later, something will &quot;bite&quot; in any case, and that exactly is the interesting part, IMHO. Otherwise people could just stay in 12TET. The most important thing IMHO is the availability of music, preferably great music, that shows the possibilities of the tuning. If there are shining examples, there is a good reason to overcome any &quot;biting&quot;. So the first and most important advice must be: MAKE MORE MUSIC!</p><p>As for &quot;intro to microtonality&quot; tuning, I think that any tuning with property A) and not too many notes can work well. 16TET, 17TET, 19TET, 22TET and 24TET all qualify undoubtedly.
