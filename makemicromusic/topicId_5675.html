Those are some really nifty timbres.  And<br/>&gt; by using 10, 11, and 13-tET, you&apos;re actually being quite pertinent<br/>&gt; to a theoretical discussion we&apos;re having right now on the tuning<br/>&gt; list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Thank you, Carl!  I am happy to hear that you liked my work!  Any pertinence<br/>it might have to anything at all is purely coincidental.  ;&lt;)</p><p>I was on the tuning list for a little while, but I unsubscribed because<br/>there were too many new emails in my box everyday!  I also don&apos;t get the<br/>point of most of the mathematical topics.  Perhaps I take a more intuitive<br/>than intellectual approach.  I&apos;d rather hear a song in a new scale then read<br/>the theory behind  it.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m still on MMM: Make Microtonal Music!<br/>A good credo, for sure.  :&lt;)</p><p>--- Steve Langford &lt;s@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Andrew&apos;s musical snippets at<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/andrewheathwaitemusic.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; are well worth hearing and make for enjoyable listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Thank you, Andrew.

I plan to add new<br/>pieces regularly, and I hope you continue to enjoy them.  When I have the<br/>time, technology and experience, I plan to make longer compositions as well,<br/>but that won&apos;t be right away.</p><p>Thanks again to you both for taking the time to listen and comment!</p><p>-Andrew Heathwaite</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
