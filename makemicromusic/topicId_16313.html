And she&apos;d earned it.<br/>First by learning to play a short-scale nylon-string acoustic I bought<br/>her, and then my full size steel-string acoustic. And so I was<br/>thinking about building one. But the thought of all that work shaping<br/>a wooden neck, and accurately setting the height of all those frets by<br/>hand, was too horrible to contemplate. And buying the blank parts<br/>would end up costing more than an entire good quality Chinese guitar.<br/>Besides, I decided that a neck-thru-body design was the only way to<br/>go. From an engineering perspective, when you need something rigid to<br/>hold strings in constant tension It seems crazy to make it in two<br/>pieces and then bolt (or heaven forbid, glue) them together.</p><p>In the end I bought her an Epiphone Les Paul Special II and the Roland<br/>Microcube you see in the photo, but it had got me to thinking, there<br/>must be a better way.</p><p>&quot;Our life is frittered away by detail. ... Simplify, simplify&quot; - Henry<br/>David Thoreau.</p><p>I had some pieces of PVC pipe in various diameters lying around from<br/>my swimming-pond filtration-system development.<br/><a href="/swimming-ponds/">/swimming-ponds/</a></p><p>I thought, &quot;I wonder just how bad it would be to have such extreme<br/>curvature on a fingerboard&quot;. I picked up some 40 mm and thought, &quot;Well<br/>it&apos;s about the same thickness as a guitar neck but there&apos;s no way you<br/>could make chords with that curvature&quot;. I picked up some 65 mm and<br/>thought, &quot;No problem about the curvature there, but it&apos;s just too big<br/>to grip comfortably&quot;. Then I picked up some 50 mm and thought, &quot;That&apos;s<br/>ju...st right&quot;, and then I fell asleep and a little while later the<br/>bears came home and father bear said ...</p><p>Oops. No. Wrong story. I thought, &quot;That might be bearable&quot; (no pun<br/>intended).</p><p>There was no way conventional tuning machines were going to work with<br/>this. Then I came across Ned Steinberger&apos;s in-line designs on the net<br/>and went out and bought some 1/8&quot; brass screws and drilled holes<br/>through their heads and got a nut driver to adjust them with.</p><p>Rather than using double ball strings, like Stenbergers, I just<br/>clamped the other end with electrical screw terminals. The bridge and<br/>saddle were easy -- just some pipe offcuts slit and expanded and<br/>sprung on top of each other around the pipe. Since the strings pass<br/>thru holes in the pipe near the ends, no nut was needed, only a zero fret.</p><p>Frets took me longer to figure out. I initially wrapped a short length<br/>of steel fencing tie-wire around the pipe and twisted its ends<br/>together. But the sharp ends were dangerous. However I played it for a<br/>while like this, as a very quiet acoustic guitar with only three frets<br/>(zero, second and third). This was enough to prove that it _was_<br/>playable. Really surprisingly so.</p><p>But I think friends and family who visited the house at this time<br/>though I was completely mad. I&apos;d say &quot;See my new guitar design&quot;, and<br/>they&apos;d see this bit of grey drainpipe with bits of fencing-wire<br/>twisted around it and say things like &quot;In what sense is that a<br/>guitar&quot;. Hee hee. No imagination :-)</p><p>For fretting I eventually hit on something so simple it made me laugh.<br/>I used one long piece of hard nylon monofilament. This is sold either<br/>as game-fishing leader or as cutting line for weedtrimmers. I just<br/>drilled matching holes on opposite sides of the pipe, at the required<br/>fret positions, and laced it up! I start with a knot on the inside at<br/>the 24th fret and put enormous tension on it as I go, and then clamp<br/>it off inside at the zero fret in the same way I do the strings, with<br/>an electrical screw terminal.</p><p>Next problem was the pickup. Obviously no standard magnetic pickup<br/>would match the curvature. I considered winding my own -- 8000 turns<br/>of very fine wire -- no thanks. And they would have to be exremely low<br/>profile since cutting into the pipe would weaken it too much. I<br/>considered optical methods. I looked at ads for flexible<br/>piezo-electric pickups for mounting under the saddle on acoustic<br/>guitars, but they were US$250. I tried putting a condenser mike inside<br/>the tube, but the feedback was awful.</p><p>In the end, another hilariously simple solution. I had no idea if it<br/>was going to work equally for all strings or if it was going to need a<br/>preamp to boost the level or what, but I took the 20 mm piezo-electric<br/>disk out of a $3.50 alarm buzzer, filed a flat area on the pipe under<br/>the middle of the bridge, glued the piezo disk there, glued a disk of<br/>PVC on top of it and glued the curved PVC bridge back on top of that<br/>so it was supported about 0.5 mm above the pipe. I hooked it up to the<br/>Roland Microcube with alligator clips and it sounded awesome! Cleaner<br/>than any magnetic pickup, all strings equal and bright and plenty of<br/>volume, no preamp needed.</p><p>I was so thrilled at the sound I took it to work (electronics design<br/>and repair) with the alligor clips still connecting it to the<br/>Microcube and handed it to one Anthony Pink at morning tea time. He&apos;s<br/>a far more accomplished guitarist than I. I thought to myself, &quot;It&apos;s<br/>probably good enough for me, but a real guitarist will find the<br/>fingerboard curvature and neck thickness too awkward to deal with&quot;.<br/>But I, and everyone else there, were totally blown away by what Anto<br/>could do with it. I swear it took him no more than a minute to<br/>accomodate to the unfamiliar shape. Geez humans are amazing.</p><p>Then it was onto sorting out the ergomomics (balance, strap anchors,<br/>leg rest, anti-rotation), and aesthetics. Then an internal truss-wire<br/>system to counteract bending of the PVC tube. But I won&apos;t bore you<br/>with further details of the development process.</p><p>As you can see, it now looks like something from outer space. The<br/>whole guitar is only 130 mm longer than its scale length and weighs<br/>only 1.3 kg. Almost half of that weight is in wet sand, as ballast and<br/>acoustic mass/damping, inside the bottom quarter of the pipe. There is<br/>no impediment to playing far down the neck and you can play it with a<br/>violin bow thanks to the curvature. It also has a road case which is,<br/>you guessed it, a larger diameter pipe with screw on inspection cap<br/>and padding.</p><p>Development is ongoing. I&apos;m currently fitting a neon tube inside one<br/>to light up its clear frets at night. It will be powered via the spare<br/>channel of a stereo cable.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=16662 href="#16662">ðŸ”—</a>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2007 9:10:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &quot;Our life is frittered away by detail. ...

The truss is critical to turning a short lived prototype<br/>into a (hopefully) long lived instrument. Not enough time has passed<br/>yet to know just how effective the current design is.</p><p>The PVC tube is rigid enough that when first constructed it does not<br/>bend significantly under string tension. Just enough to give a<br/>fingerboard &quot;relief&quot; of about 0.5 mm. But without some counteracting<br/>forces it will slowly creep (over a period of weeks or months). The<br/>rate depends on temperature.</p><p>The current truss design involves two steel wires 1.25 mm in diameter.<br/>Two wires lets you control bending in two dimensions. The truss wires<br/>are treated in a similar way to the strings. i.e. At the nut end they<br/>pass through the end cap and are clamped with electrical-type screw<br/>terminals (painted gold). And they are tensioned at the bridge end in<br/>the same way the strings are tuned -- by turning the nuts on the ends<br/>of brass screws poking out of the end cap. The truss wires are<br/>threaded through holes in the screw heads.</p><p>Except of course the truss wires are _inside_ the tube and the screws<br/>and nuts are larger than those used for the strings.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t become a truss until you add compression elements to push<br/>on the inside of the tube and try to make it bend the other way (the<br/>analog of the bridge and nut). There are two. One is just past the<br/>24th fret and doubles as a wall of the ballast chamber. It is a PVC<br/>end cap for a smaller diameter pipe that has grooves cut near one edge<br/>for the two truss wires and is solvent-cemented into place inside the<br/>tube. The other is positioned between the 7th and 8th frets and is a<br/>20 mm long piece of approximately 30 mm dia PVC pipe cemented to the<br/>inside of the fingerboard, with grooves in one edge for the truss wires.</p><p>I&apos;m happy to give more detail, but I&apos;ll wait to see if you want it. Or<br/>if you have specific questions.</p><p>-- Dave K</p></div>
