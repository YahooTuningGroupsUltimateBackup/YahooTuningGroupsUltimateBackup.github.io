It&apos;s been a feature<br/>&gt; since Finale 97, I think.</p><p>The notation stuff they provide in Finale is mind boggling and really<br/>poorly documented with no real examples, etc. I looked at the documentation<br/>and gave up on it very quickly.</p><p>Besides, for me, I can make the eye/hand connection between piano key and<br/>note on page for standard common music notation, and I don&apos;t want to<br/>struggle with a notation that doesn&apos;t match my 35+ years of experience with<br/>that connection, learned in childhood.</p><p>There is no &quot;standard&quot; microtonal notation that can handle all the various<br/>tuning systems and still allows one to make the simple eye/hand connection<br/>that is taught universally in our musical culture. Until there is such,<br/>various microtonal notations won&apos;t be worth learning -- at least that&apos;s my<br/>opinion for my own purposes.</p><p>I use something that works for me during composition, and nobody has to<br/>read it or reproduce it because I do exclusively electronic work performed<br/>by the machine direct do disk. And if anyone ever does want to look at it<br/>or reproduce it on another setup, they could use a standard keyboard and<br/>the standard learned-in-childhood eye/hand coordination suffices.</p><p>That&apos;s my rationale,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
