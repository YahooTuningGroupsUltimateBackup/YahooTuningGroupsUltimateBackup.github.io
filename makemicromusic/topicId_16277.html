So when I went to edit and mix it<br/>was very natural to stick one in the middle, one<br/>on the left, and one on the right.<br/>There were also a couple of places where I had<br/>made mistakes and I duplicated what was on one<br/>channel, delayed it a bit, and panned it to the other<br/>(so that one side wouldn&apos;t just disappear).</p><p>&gt; &quot;J.Smith&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; Always nice to hear another one of your works, and 31-edo is a nice<br/>&gt; tuning to work with.

I really don&apos;t feel like I understand 31-edo yet.<br/>In one sense it&apos;s easy to play because there are so many<br/>ways to play familiar sounding things... but in another<br/>sense, that makes it hard because you need to make choices.</p><p>&gt; &quot;aum&quot; (Milan) wrote:<br/>&gt; Nice relaxing music, pleasing sound, 31-edo sound very good here.<br/>&gt; Natural sounding instrument, good stereo image - individual parts are<br/>&gt; firmly located.</p><p>The instrument itself is nicely made, and has good intonation.<br/>The fretting only goes up to the ocatve on each string,<br/>but that still gives an awful lot of notes.</p><p>&gt; But I hear too much disturbing noises in background - breathing?<br/>&gt; manipulation noise? mp3 artifacts?</p><p>Ah... yes I noticed about 2/3 of the way through the recording<br/>process that I was breathing fairly loudly in some places...<br/>(breathing is a habit I picked up over the past couple of decades).<br/>I suspect that&apos;s what you&apos;re hearing... the post-processing<br/>was minimal -- there was a bit of reverb (I tried to keep it<br/>subtle) and a bit of filtering to adjust for the boominess<br/>of the microphone in the low frequencies (I had the mic positioned<br/>very close to the sound hole).</p><p>Anyway, thanks for listening!</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2007 7:41:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi - in a few days I have to present something to a class using someone else&apos;s set-up that I can&apos;t examine until it&apos;s time to use it.
