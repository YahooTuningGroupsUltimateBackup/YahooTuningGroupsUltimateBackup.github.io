The piece was metered, and has both metric and tempo changes in sections; therefore, the bulk of the piece already had an existing tempo/meter format.

If you<br/>want to have something for people for whom downloading &gt; 128kbps is<br/>a burden, then use ogg for the low bitrate, as it will sound better.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2005 9:08:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Wild asked,</p><p>&gt; how I can add a decent reverb to a .wav file.</p><p>If you&apos;re on Windows...

It looks like a very good program. Thanks.</p><p>Jon - if you do get the chance to write about free options for this, I will probably need to do this again at some point after 30 days have passed, so feel free to let me/the list know.

(Adobe Audition is $300)</p><p>Aha, I *knew* I could do it!</p><p>I originally thought of Audacity, which has gotten good marks for not only being free, but supporting 3 major computing platforms (Win, Mac, Linux). However, even though they &apos;support&apos; VST plugs, it is somewhat funky. So I kept looking, and...</p><p>Found a nice, completely free multi-track audio recorder/sequencer/mixer that completely supports VST plugins (so we have access to some very nice effects plugs in the freeware community). Point your brower to the Krystal Audio Engine:</p><p><a href="http://www.kreatives.org/kristal/index.php?section=details">http://www.kreatives.org/kristal/index.php?section=details</a></p><p>It was a completely painless install, and on startup you have multiple tracks of audio, a mixer, and a transport control bar. But before you run the program, you next want to go to two places; since you initially asked about adding reverb, there is a really, really nice convolution reverb called &quot;GlaceVerb&quot; from a company called DaSample:</p><p><a href="http://www.dasample.com/index.php?show=glaceverb">http://www.dasample.com/index.php?show=glaceverb</a></p><p>Mind you, it is a quality free product from a company that develops commercial software. Also, when I was investigating VST support in Audacity, I came across a pack of free plugs that you can use with that program that contains (among a lot of other interesting looking plugs that I didn&apos;t try out) another nice verb called Anwida Soft DX Reverb Lite:</p><p><a href="http://www.tsof.edu.au/resources/sound/installers/Plug-Ins.zip">http://www.tsof.edu.au/resources/sound/installers/Plug-Ins.zip</a></p><p>As with the GlaceVerb files, you simply unzip this to the &quot;plugins&quot; directory below the Krystal directory. (note that Krystal has a few plugs that come with it) As with most VST plugs, both Glace and Anwida have a drop-down list at the top of the respective GUI that will give you access to many presets, like &apos;medium room warm&apos; or &apos;large bright space&apos;.</p><p>I&apos;ll leave it to you to learn to work Krystal, but you simply open a file in the first audio track, and then go to the mixer and load one of the plugs in a slot right at the top of the console. Tweak to your hearts content, and that&apos;s it.</p><p>I also remember that you wanted to extract audio files from a CD; there are millions of apps like this, probably no need to look further than FreeRip:</p><p><a href="http://www.mgshareware.com/frmmain.shtml">http://www.mgshareware.com/frmmain.shtml</a></p><p>I hope this helps you out, let me know if you futz around with this if you have any problems! I also want you to know that I don&apos;t operate with just free/shareware, and I have lots of commercial apps at my disposal. But I continue to be amazed and delighted at the tools out there for musicians that can come at little or no cost, and that is why it is fun to do exploration like this.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2005 6:27:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>KG,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;great stuff JS!</p><p>Aw, thanks man - you know your ears mean a lot to me!</p><p>&gt;especially the ending...</p><p>You know, that is the definition of serendipity. The end section came very late, and was the only part (save for the first 10 seconds) that could be anything I wanted, no meter, etc. I saved that for late in the process, feeling stressed about getting out the stuff they needed to count. I&apos;m definitely going to take that direction in some upcoming music I write just for _me_.</p><p>&gt;i like how the water turned in a rhythmic part at the beginning. Sampled?</p><p>Yes, in a way. I actually pulled some of the splashs from a video of a performance we did of Tan Dun&apos;s &quot;Concerto for Water Percussion&quot;, and also trolled the net for water drips, etc. I did some tweaking of the various clips, edited them as one-shot samples, and loaded them into a software drum machine called RMIV. Since what I wanted was a variety of sounds, not one sound pitched on different keys, this worked well. I added a particular kind of reverb to give it a feel of the sound bouncing off of rocks or walls instead of just a room reverb.</p><p>In all honesty, I would have backed away on the water quite a bit, and not done as much rhythmic stuff, if it were just a piece of music. But this needed to facilitate the events and moods on-stage, so one tries to be accomodating.</p><p>Thanks Kraig, your &apos;dedicated&apos; piece will be coming down the road!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2005 7:12:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Ten minute score for the dance company &quot;forward to breath&quot;, to<br/>choreography<br/>&gt; by Terri Shipman.

For me as a listener, it is helpful to<br/>know a composer&apos;s goals and constraints as well as the intended<br/>context of the music. As well as enjoying your piece in the abstract,<br/>I feel that I would appreciate the combining of it with bodies in<br/>motion and all of the visuals / physicality associated with the water<br/>theme.</p><p>Regards,<br/>George</p></div><h3>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2005 8:01:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon - great post.

The drag of the TTS-1, which has some awfully nice sounds, is that I can&apos;t readily apply tunings to it (hence this section being in 12tet).
