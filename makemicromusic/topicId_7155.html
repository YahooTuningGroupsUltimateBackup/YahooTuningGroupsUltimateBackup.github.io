Perhaps this list has evolved away<br/>from its original tenets, but that should be no reason to close it down. I<br/>moved off tuning list because of the flame wars, to the relative quiet and<br/>calm statements made on MMM.</p><p>If MMM goes, I shall no longer post to any microtonal lists. If anyone<br/>wishes to keep in contact with me, can they send a message to my normal<br/>mark dot gould at argonet address, and I&apos;ll put you in my address list.</p><p>I&apos;ll stay on the list till the list stops, but then I&apos;ll unsubscribe.</p><p>Otherwise, this constitutes my last posting to this list.</p><p>and it&apos;s goodbye from him... :)</p><p>Mark</p></div>
