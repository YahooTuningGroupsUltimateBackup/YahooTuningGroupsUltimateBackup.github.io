Although I have been using this software for a<br/>couple of years now (I wrote &apos;Juggler&apos; with et_compose), I feel confident<br/>that it is mature and stable and bug-free enough to release to the public<br/>with a &apos;beta&apos; label.</p><p>You can find explanation and the actual source at</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/pub">http://www.akjmusic.com/pub</a></p><p>Caveat:</p><p>The current version is aimed t Linux-platform users. It might work as well on<br/>Mac OS-X, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Windows users might seek out my guidance with altering the Python source. In<br/>fact, I&apos;d be willing to go through some beta-testing procedures with a<br/>Windows-using volunteer, and offer a second version specifically for Windows.<br/>The issue is that the file structure referred to in the Python source is *nix<br/>file structure, referring to a typical *nix file tree, and with correct,<br/>forward slash-style file tree syntax (Windows uses the ugly, misguided<br/>backslash syntax). So there would have to be some minor changes to the Python<br/>source, including the libraries, for it to work without a hitch on Windows.<br/>If you are running a Windows platform, and would still like to use<br/>&apos;et_compose&apos; or &apos;ji_compose&apos;, contact me and I can walk you through the<br/>process. This will help me offer an alternative script for Windows users.</p><p>Also, Windows users might seek out the binary executable for &apos;mf2t&apos; and &apos;t2mf&apos;<br/>by themselves: I think Windows doesn&apos;t come with a free C-language compiler,<br/>i.e. you&apos;d have to shell out cash to develop your own software you wanted to<br/>give away.</p><p>Best,<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2005 8:05:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Windows users might seek out my guidance with altering the Python source.<br/>&gt;In fact, I&apos;d be willing to go through some beta-testing procedures with a<br/>&gt;Windows-using volunteer, and offer a second version specifically for<br/>&gt;Windows.
