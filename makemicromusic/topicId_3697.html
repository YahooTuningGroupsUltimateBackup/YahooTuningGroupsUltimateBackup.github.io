But Yahoo Groups<br/>acted a bit funny with my e-mail addresses.</p><p>&gt; Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 11:17:41 -0400<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Judith shouldn&apos;t have to review her own concert :)<br/>&gt; The following message should&apos;ve gone into a previous<br/>&gt; digest, but I had to fix my YahooGroups settings. My<br/>&gt; apologies for the delay.<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if any other list members made it, but<br/>&gt; it was well worth my while to drive an hour S. of<br/>&gt; Boston to hear Judith Conrad&apos;s expressive<br/>&gt; performances of the Baroque master Froberger in<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone, in Fall River, MA just a short<br/>&gt; ways from Providence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; She really brought out the counterpoint very nicely,<br/>&gt; and made expressive use of tempo. Plus, I certainly<br/>&gt; enjoyed hearing Baroque music in this tuning for the<br/>&gt; first time in years (live), the last time being at<br/>&gt; the Teyler Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands on the<br/>&gt; Fokker 31-ET organ.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; She not only performs admirably, but she repairs,<br/>&gt; rebuilds, as well as tunes clavichords,<br/>&gt; harpsichords, and apparently monochords too--she has<br/>&gt; a Clavi-monochord that was fun to experiment with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was also a pleasure to enjoy the cookout<br/>&gt; afterwards, and her very interesting artistic and<br/>&gt; intellectual friends.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope she&apos;ll continue to keep us informed of her<br/>&gt; activities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Soundly yours,<br/>&gt; Harold Fortuin</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>HotJobs - Search Thousands of New Jobs<br/><a href="http://www.hotjobs.com">http://www.hotjobs.com</a></p></div>
