I wish you had the money.<br/>  Lambdoma is a name associated with the Pythagorean version of the Tonality Diamond, in my case taken to the 17 Limit. It is also the name used by Barbara Hero for her matrix keyboard, which connects to a PC via the serial port and to MIDI via Fractal Tune Smithy.</p><p>  Best,</p><p>  Denny</p><p>Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>  On 3/8/06, Denny Genovese wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello, All<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of you may remember me.<br/>&gt; Inspired by Partch back in the 1970&apos;s I built a JI Orchestra in Hawaii and began to experiment and compose with the hope of developing some interesting music and a theory for using extended Just Intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Later I built a more advanced ensemble in Florida and tought some musicians to play them, recorded a CD and performed for several years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In more recent times, I&apos;ve been travelling a lot and my instruments have been in storage.

The HammerStrings reminds me of a work for Piano, Harp and Piano Harp by Denis ApIvor, which calls for the action to be removed from an upright and the strings to be played with a variety of beaters.  It is however, a serial work, composed in EQ in the 1960s...</p><p>If you are looking to sell -- and sad thought that is --  try the Cantos Music Foundation.  Though there&apos;s hardly a reason to do it, don&apos;t mention my name:)</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p></div><h3><a id=12449 href="#12449">ðŸ”—</a>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 7:03:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Denny Genovese<br/>&lt;dennygenovese@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   In more recent times, I&apos;ve been travelling a lot and my<br/>instruments have been in storage.
