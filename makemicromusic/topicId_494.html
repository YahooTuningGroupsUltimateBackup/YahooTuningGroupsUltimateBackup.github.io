I&apos;ll take em down within a couple<br/>days.  &quot;IPA.mp3&quot; is one minute of noodling around on the guitar very<br/>late last Friday night, multitracked on a cheap Tascam cassette<br/>recorder.  Yes, I have heard of computers, and yes, I will record<br/>digitally when it&apos;s feasible for me.  So please forgive (at least for<br/>the moment) the sloppy playing, poor mixing, bad levels, and general<br/>noisiness.  Isn&apos;t this the place to run around naked and all that<br/>kind of thing?  Anyway the poor quality lends a certain blues<br/>authenticity, like it was recorded in 1925.  (BTW Does anyone know of<br/>any noise reduction freeware to check out?)</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll hazard a guess no one has ever simulated a 12-bar blues<br/>in 11ET.  I think a warped but convincing blues could certainly be<br/>made in this tuning.  (This file probably isn&apos;t it...)  I also think<br/>the likes of Tom Waits or Capt Beefheart would have a ball in this<br/>tuning.  (This file probably doesn&apos;t get that across either...)</p><p>And the title may or may not have anything to do with the locally<br/>microbrewed extra-hoppy beverage I was sipping at the time...</p><p>kp</p></div>
