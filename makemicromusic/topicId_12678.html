Some<br/>of the schemes are the Hermode tuning (which adjusts the tunings<br/>towards a set of nearest JI intervals), John deLaubenfels physical<br/>analogy of connecting notes with &quot;springs&quot; connected to a JI lattice<br/>that can then move the pitches around, and my own work minimizing the<br/> sensory dissonance by adjusting the pitches.</p><p>Recently, I&apos;ve been looking into the idea of adapting the complete<br/>spectrum of the sound (rather than just the pitches). This is a kind<br/>of adaptive timbre. There are some tricky issues, but the gist of it<br/>is to suppose that there is a (momentarily fixed) field against which<br/> the overtones of the notes will adapt and to use the same idea (that<br/>of minimizing the sensory dissonance) to guide the motion of the<br/>partials.</p><p>For these examples, I decided to use some multiphonics from a clarinet<br/>as the &quot;field.&quot; Then, the &quot;melody&quot; is a solo clarinet played over this<br/>field, and adapted. Already there are some interesting sounds. Perhaps<br/>most obviously, the &quot;clarinetness&quot; of the melody is compromised --<br/>sometimes there is a hint of it, but often it is annihilated. Why is<br/>this? The essence of clarinet-sound is the alternation between large<br/>and small harmonics -- the large being the odd harmonics and the small<br/>being the even. In the mapped sounds, the large-small pattern is<br/>retained, but they no longer occur on the harmonic series (rather,<br/>they are moved towards the partials of the multiphonics, which are<br/>inharmonic). Apparently, this is enough to compromise the<br/>&quot;clarinet-nature&quot; of the melody in most cases. On the other hand, it<br/>still has the character of some kind of melody.</p><p>Anyway, here are some preliminary results:</p><p><a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/clari/clariphonicsgroup2.mp3">http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/clari/clariphonicsgroup2.mp3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/clari/clariphonicsgroup2b.mp3">http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/clari/clariphonicsgroup2b.mp3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/clari/clariphonicsgroup4.mp3">http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/clari/clariphonicsgroup4.mp3</a></p><p>All three are the exact same melody, adapted to three different<br/>sets of multiphonics.</p><p>I would be happy for any feedback, criticism, or thoughts...</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=12686 href="#12686">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 7:22:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill,<br/>This is fun stuff!
