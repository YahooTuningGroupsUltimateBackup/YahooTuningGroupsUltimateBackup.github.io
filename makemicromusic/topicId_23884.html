The standard model is 8x8 = 64 keys. Doubling this to<br/>make 128 keys would probably be really productive. The keys also have LED&apos;s<br/>in them, so you can color them black and white in a Janko/Fokker/etc layout<br/>if you want.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
