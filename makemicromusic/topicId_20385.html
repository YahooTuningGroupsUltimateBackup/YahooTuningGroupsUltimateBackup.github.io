I<br/>currently have this new version on my SoundClick page at:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/jayrinkel">www.soundclick.com/jayrinkel</a></p><p>Pick the title &quot;The Painter&quot; if you are interested in this song.  It is<br/>performed with two acoustic guitar parts accompanying a vocal.  I will<br/>probably keep it up for at least a few weeks.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jay Rinkel</p></div>
