Make me weep, laugh, make me feel something of great depth if possible. Of course, we&apos;re all wired differently, and the meaning of art is usually pretty subjective. But, there is music with depth, and there is music that has little depth...my opinion on a lot of &quot;modern&quot; music, including much of the non 12 tone eq music I&apos;ve heard over the years, is that it doesn&apos;t reach those deep levels of spiritual meaning that I am wanting to hear. I am not here to name names, cause I&apos;m not attacking anybody personally, but when we say we don&apos;t like someone&apos;s art, I&apos;m not surprised if feelings get involved; but, I&apos;ve never assumed everybody was going to like what I do either, so it&apos;s the way the criticism is delivered that&apos;s important. When I hear something I don&apos;t like, I say &quot;I don&apos;t live there,&quot; meaning that particular music doesn&apos;t appeal to me. We don&apos;t have to insult someone personally if their music doesn&apos;t move us.</p><p>   And speaking of deep spiritual meaning, I have rarely seen anybody on the tuning forums discuss music in these terms. It&apos;s mostly about decimal places and subtle shades of commas...no problem, but the true meaning of music is in it&apos;s great power to express astonishing levels of feeling. That&apos;s what I am looking for in my art, and I believe that the use of different tunings can help in that process. That&apos;s why I like Danielou&apos;s book &quot;Music and the Power of Sound&quot; so much; regardless if he gets the numbers right all the time, he gives great insight into the deeper meanings of music. That has been almost totally lost in our &quot;modern&quot; American culture, and that&apos;s too bad. And I agree about Bach; he continually touches me on the deepest human and spiritual levels, he is my ideal as a musician...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
