But we all know it is well nigh onto impossible. I&apos;ve deleted a member and his post (I&apos;ve written to them in the past, trying to work in a positive way to resolve the issue), and I&apos;m sorry for the excess noise.</p><p>I&apos;ll keep an eye on stuff in the near future, but if we get any more repeats I may institute one of those membership approval things, which will be just a tad more work for me but will make joining the list less likely for non-MMM oriented humans.</p><p>Back to ratios, temperaments, and whatever else you want in your MMMusic...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
