It&apos;s all over<br/>the 5th symphony as well.</p><p>One thing I notice about young student composers is that their music<br/>sounds sometimes to &quot;down-beaty&quot;.  When I was a student I went through a<br/>phase wehre pretty much every note I wrote was on an upbeat,  everything<br/>was tied over into the next beat.  You&apos;re just shifting things over a bit,<br/>but somehow it works,  the music really does seem more floating.</p><p>So back to topic:  how do we re-tune him????????</p></div>
