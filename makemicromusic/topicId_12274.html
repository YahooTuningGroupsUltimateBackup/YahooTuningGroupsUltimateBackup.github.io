I recently met a guy, Ken Field, and he has a radio show on WMBR 88.1 in Boston, from 2-4 on Fridays. I gave him my CD&apos;s, and the &quot;tuning@eartha&quot; disc, and he&apos;s played cuts from both in the last couple of weeks. The show, &quot;New Edge,&quot; consistently features pretty avant stuff, if you&apos;re in the area give a listen. And, a big thanks to Ken for digging the micro stuff...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2006 5:48:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot;<br/>&lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Hey all...

Congratulations and this is great news. Too<br/>bad the 1996 Tuning List Tape Swap tape was never made into a CD,<br/>though!</p></div>
