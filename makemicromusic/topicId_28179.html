Recently I haven&apos;t done much microtonal music, but I do keep checking in to follow and see what everyone else is doing.</p><p>I&apos;m in the process of significantly changing my music setup and down-sizing. Big hardware crash which caused me to &quot;upgrade&quot; recently. Age and upgrade are also causing me to question what I&apos;m doing or not doing, etc, with equipment I have...</p><p>Part of my consolidation effort means that I&apos;m looking for a good home for an old TX802 synth. I&apos;m not really a performer, and I just haven&apos;t been making good use of this box. Details here, with some microtonal samples, in case anyone is interested:</p><p><a href="http://azuma-asobi.com/temp/tx802-4-sale.html">http://azuma-asobi.com/temp/tx802-4-sale.html</a></p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a vintage instrument, but hopefully someone out there in microtonal land might be interested in using it for live performance...</p><p>You can also e-mail me (*off list* please).</p><p>Cheers,<br/>    Rick</p></div>
