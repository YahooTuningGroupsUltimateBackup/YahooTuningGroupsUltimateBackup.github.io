So you&apos;d better get started already.  I have a<br/>brainstorm at &lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MMMMonth07">xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MMMMonth07</a>&gt;:</p><p>Microtonal concerts in May 2007</p><p>    * NYC&apos;s American Festival of Microtonal Music, under the direction<br/>of Johnny Reinhard, presents 3 New York Concerts at the Bowery Poetry<br/>Club, located at 308 Bowery at Bleeker Street. The series begins on<br/>April 29, continues on May 2, and concludes on May 8. All three<br/>concerts start at 10 PM. General admission is $10 at the door.<br/>Internationally recognized bass trombonist Dave Taylor is the AFMM&apos;s<br/>featured performing artist this year. <a href="http://www.afmm.org/">http://www.afmm.org/</a><br/>    * MICROTONAL FAYRE, at York University, UK, is a day of concerts,<br/>presentations, panel discussions on May 2. It is free. I guess it&apos;s<br/>over by now. &lt;<a href="http://music.york.ac.uk/conferences/microtonal/">http://music.york.ac.uk/conferences/microtonal/</a>&gt;<br/>    * MICROFEST (the west coast manifestation) has four of its<br/>concerts in May: Gamelan &amp; Guitars; James Tenney with Strings;<br/>Anaphorian Shadow Play: The Follies of Dr. Placebo; and Parch &quot;On the<br/>Road.&quot; Various locations in LA area; &lt;<a href="http://www.microfest.org/">http://www.microfest.org/</a>&gt;<br/>    * 17 tone Piano Project Phase Three at Rice University, Houston,<br/>Texas, May 7th. &lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/SeventeenTPPPhaseThree">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/SeventeenTPPPhaseThree</a>&gt;<br/>    * (another completely self-promotory event in Houston) 31 tone<br/>singin&apos; camp May 8-18 &lt;<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/31tsc.pdf">http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/31tsc.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Suggested Microtonal-awareness-promoting activities for May 2007<br/>a brainstorm, admittedly western-biased -- augment as you see fit.</p><p>   1. Make a T-shirt with the anti-12th-root-of-two logo or a logo of<br/>your own invention. Wear it daily.<br/>   2. For your friends with May birthdays, give a slide whistle, or an<br/>udderbot or balloon flute you made yourself, or...?<br/>   3. Call into your local or not-so-local freeform radio station and<br/>request Neil Haverstick and Jon Catler and Warren Burt and Astroid<br/>Power-Up! and Ellen Fullman and...?<br/>   4. Blast some Ben Johnston or Tony Conrad or La Monte Young from<br/>the subwoofers of your pimped-out auto as you ride through the suburbs.<br/>   5. Engage yourself in an EtudeProject: bend your ears further,<br/>learn 31-tone solfege, etc.<br/>   6. Make your one-of-a-kind or unusual microtonal instrument<br/>available for the learning and experimentation and noodling of<br/>lay-musicians for a day, or a weekend, or the whole month.<br/>   7. Make a pilgrimage en masse to the nearest known one-of-a-kind or<br/>unusual microtonal instrument and demand (or ask nicely) that it be<br/>made available for public use for a day, or a weekend, or the whole month.<br/>   8. Climb Mt. Meru. Climb your nearest scale tree. Climb a ladder<br/>with more than twelve rungs and make a fuss about it.<br/>   9. Plan a flash mob of microtonalized recorders (put tape over the<br/>holes a la Reinhard) to attack the nearest establishment that blares<br/>12-equal muzak the most annoyingly.<br/>  10. Record an album of microtonal easy listening and smuggle it into<br/>a record store.<br/>  11. Replace your (and others&apos;) clock faces with non-12 ones. Attempt<br/>to use a 26-hour day. (That&apos;s a tricky one to shake, believe me!)<br/>  12. Go into your local piano store and...no, that wouldn&apos;t be nice.<br/>Or terribly easy to do clandestinely.<br/>  13. That&apos;s all I got but I really couldn&apos;t stop at number 12!</p><p>More to come. Fight boredom.</p><p>-Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=16898 href="#16898">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2007 8:02:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   1.
