IMHO, the best way to honor someone is to take<br/>bits of their<br/>work and reconstitute them in new ways.  When old<br/>works become museum<br/>pieces, they become brittle and eventually lost.  This<br/>is not honoring,<br/>this is killing.</p><p>I do hope that faithful renditions of old works remain<br/>in our ears, as<br/>a point of comparison if nothing else.<br/>-----------</p><p>With that great intro, now my 2.5 cents...</p><p>I became a real partisan for the use of 4:5:6:7<br/>dominant sevenths about as soon as I could tune them<br/>up with my Kurzweil and Clavette some 8 years ago.</p><p>We should remember the context in which past revered<br/>musical theorists didn&apos;t find the harmonic 7th useful.<br/>Most of them did not live at a time in which the<br/>chromatically available harmonies and melodies in the<br/>commonly used tunings had all been well-explored (as<br/>is now the case with 12-ET), and they could not often<br/>easily build instruments (or train choirs) for<br/>reasonably easy &gt;12-ET performance--practicality was<br/>certainly a big factor</p><p>While it&apos;s fair to say that one can&apos;t easily<br/>substitute this sonority for the dominant seventh<br/>chords in most common practice music without<br/>adjustments, this DOES NOT mean that we can&apos;t make NEW<br/>pieces that sound as euphonious as music that period<br/>using JIs or &gt;12-ETs that represent them well.</p><p>As suggested by JdL, those of us on this list with<br/>strong common practice harmony skills should also<br/>consider &apos;desecrating&apos; the &apos;holy writ of the musical<br/>Masters&apos; by taking some of those works, whether by<br/>Monteverdi or Wagner or whomever else, moving &apos;em to<br/>say 22-ET, and making musically appropriate<br/>adjustments and corrections to create an aesthetically<br/>satisfying transcription of the original into another<br/>tuning domain.</p><p>Amongst the adjustments I make in musical context with<br/>22-ET:</p><p>Descending major scales: from major scale degree 3,<br/>the 5:4 match (7/22), I continue with 10:9 (3/22), not<br/>9:8 (4/22).<br/>Ascending: reverse the rule: 9:8 in place of 10:9<br/>(the major scale here can be conceived of as &quot;melodic<br/>major&quot;)</p><p>My ears have no problem with melodic motion in 22-ET<br/>that puts the minor 7th above the dominant, followed<br/>by the harmonic 7th. You can even resolve from the<br/>harmonic 7th with further hyperchromatic voice-leading<br/>through the 9/7 (8/22) to the 5/4 (7/22).</p><p>We can also distinguish the top tone of the<br/>minor-minor 7th chord from the top tone of the<br/>4:5:6:7--in 22-ET these are 1/22 apart. Rich grounds<br/>for investigation with jazzy styles.</p><p>-------------<br/>Some recent quotes of Paul E. that deserve response:</p><p>&gt;&gt;...No one even conceived of music as a<br/>set of &quot;chord progressions&quot; like we do today. Listen<br/>to Victoria. What&apos;s the &quot;chord progression&quot;?</p><p>One way or the other, Victoria must have carefully<br/>chosen his harmonies, even if German 19-century<br/>harmonic theory was not known. We can hear &apos;chord<br/>progression&apos; because the music can fairly be heard<br/>that way--just as we might label Martin Luther&apos;s<br/>theology as Protestantism although perhaps no one in<br/>1525 would understand that concept. Most Western music<br/>is inextricably harmonic-melodic, or<br/>melodic-harmonic--something like the way light can be<br/>seen today by physicists as waves, or photons--but it<br/>really is something of both, as well as being the kind<br/>of brightness that we know as physical creatures with<br/>sense organs.</p><p>&gt;&gt;...The meaning of the V7 chord is primarily<br/>_melodic_ (&quot;linear&quot;), rather<br/>than harmonic. The notes of the diminished fifth<br/>always resolved in<br/>contrary motion to a tonic third.</p><p>Even in common practice music the V7 frequently<br/>resolves to a vi, and if reinterpreted as an augmented<br/>7th it obviously resolves outward. (The moment of<br/>reinterpretation obviously being as one hears the<br/>resolution of what was first heard as a V7.)</p><p>Of course the &quot;dominant seventh&quot; chord is also the<br/>basic harmony of the blues, and is generally the<br/>&apos;triad&apos; of swing and later jazz. Although of course in<br/>most of those functions, it&apos;s not a dominant seventh,<br/>but a major-minor 7th chord.</p><p>I think you&apos;ve taken too seriously the Schenkerian<br/>ideology handed down in most US college music<br/>departments today. If these analyses really revealed<br/>so much about the structure of the masterworks from<br/>which they&apos;re derived, why aren&apos;t we hearing new works<br/>of brilliant tonal music from such theorists who after<br/>all have unveiled &apos;everything&apos; about, say, Beethoven&apos;s<br/>5th? There is some value to Schenkerian theory, but<br/>there is insufficient consideration of the interaction<br/>of short and large-scale rhythm, orchestration,<br/>dynamics, melodic shapes, the dramatic development of<br/>tonal music: the surprises vs. the &apos;continuing&apos;, etc.<br/>I found it quite interesting to look at 16th &amp; 20th<br/>century pieces in  a Schenkerian way--music which<br/>supposedly shouldn&apos;t be analyzed with his concepts.</p><p>-------------<br/>Also: I don&apos;t find the conception of n-limit useful.<br/>I&apos;m not very interested in 7-denominator intervals<br/>like say 10/7 or 25/49, while I find 7:4, 7:5, 7:6<br/>really intriguing for the extension of common practice<br/>harmony into &gt;12 ETs.<br/>==============<br/>I look forward to all thoughtful critiques, and hope<br/>to show you the fruits of my theorizations with more<br/>music live and on the web in the near future.</p><p>Soundly yours,<br/>Harold</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Terrorist Attacks on U.S. - How can you help?<br/>Donate cash, emergency relief information<br/><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/</a></p></div>
