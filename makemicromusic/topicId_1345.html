If only the former, then you can probably include software based samplers in the survey; if the latter, unless you have a completely reliable and beefy laptop or rackmount, I wouldn&apos;t (right now) trust a software based sampler for live performance.</p><p>Seems many of the creative types, esp with regard to microtonal music, do at least *some* work on the computer to process/prepare samples.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Anyone out there use samplers for microtonal stuff?</p><p>Both Jacky Ligon and Mary Beth Ackerly leap to mind, so I&apos;ll let them answer. You might also want to check out Bill Sethares recent mp3 uploads to see what he has done in the software realm for microtuning of samples...</p><p>I&apos;ll do a search in my archives for the initial msg I posted about samplers a couple months ago, and you can read the archives...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 7:07:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick!<br/>It is my understanding that there is a large corporation that is planning to<br/>take DNA samples of famous artists which will then be able to perform for<br/>you. So it you want a Tony Williams Drum part , you take a DNA chip taken<br/>from Tony and slip it into your sampler and sit and listen back. They are<br/>also working on blending and mixing where one can combine DNA as well as<br/>having one fade out and another fade in. They have found though that some<br/>mixtures result in a complete lack of DNA reconciliation and fail to produce<br/>anything by internal overheating</p><p>Rick McGowan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Just got a question from a friend of mine...

I have a page<br/>at my web site explaining how.  While you can technically use keymaps in<br/>any sampler to map microtonal scales, I consider this too painful and<br/>time consuming to be considered &quot;microtonal support.&quot;  There is no<br/>intonation table for the entire keyboard.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>microtonal@...</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Jonathan M.

I haven&apos;t tried it<br/>with live music. I create input files that are processed by Csound to<br/>create a wave file that I listen to after the fact. Csound is by far<br/>the most flexible and powerful way to use samples. You have complete<br/>control over the pitches, with no artificial limitations on how many<br/>different instruments you use, or how many tones per octave. You can<br/>also manipulate pitch, sample, envelope, velocity, glissando,<br/>location, and any of a dozen other parameters for each and every note<br/>individually.</p><p>That said, Csound is a bear to learn. Take a look at my web page for<br/>a dozen pieces I have made using samples and Csound. Some recent ones<br/>use samples I made myself from some instruments I built.
