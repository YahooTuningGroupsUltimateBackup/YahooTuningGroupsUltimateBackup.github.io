I put Debussy up there somewhere in<br/>the top 3 for me as well... my list would probably have the likes of<br/>Stravinsky and Gershwin up there as well. In many regards Debussy is a<br/>favorite of mine.</p><p>I start putting together a 72-tet version of Reverie a long time ago,<br/>but I found that I just could not get it to sound good. The piece is<br/>so full of comma pumps (even simple 5-limit ones) that I don&apos;t even<br/>know where to begin if my goal is really to make the pieces all fit<br/>together just right.</p><p>That being said, there were a few times where throwing intervals like<br/>7/4 in sounded absolutely incredible... The interesting thing for me<br/>is how effectively he can communicate 7-limit harmonies within a<br/>12-tet context.</p><p>All the best,<br/>Mike</p><p>On Wed, Oct 14, 2009 at 6:15 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Debussy, after Bach, is my favorite composer...in a year, I listen to those two more than anybody else.
