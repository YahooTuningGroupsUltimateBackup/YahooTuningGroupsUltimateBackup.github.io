This is the kind of stylistic medley, and<br/>harmonization, that is an &quot;AKJ&quot; trademark.</p><p>_Eat My Two-Against-Three_ had a certain quartal/quintal flavor for me<br/>in the opening, maybe suggesting something from Bartok -- and very<br/>pleasantly carried off. It suggests to me that a &quot;Bartokian&quot; style has<br/>various nuances of melody and rhythmic which can, for example, take<br/>place in 12-equal -- but in also tunings like this one also.</p><p>_ADD Crisis Center_ (is ADD here Attention Deficit Disorder, or<br/>&quot;hyperactivity&quot;?) sounds to me like a delightfully &quot;switched-on&quot;<br/>variation on Elizabethan keyboard music, or possibly, more<br/>specifically, that of John Bull, whose ebullient ornamentations have<br/>attracted both admiration (my reaction) and less enthusiastic<br/>responses in some quarters. Is this, both stylistically and<br/>intonationally, a kind of coda to the famed AKJ Bull rendition in<br/>19-equal -- if so, it&apos;s a worthy one! This is way cool indeed.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>Why don&apos;t I start my &quot;theoretical&quot; remarks with a Scala file for a<br/>12-note tuning in 2/5-comma meantone:</p><p>! mean2-5.scl<br/>!<br/>2/5-comma meantone, Eb-G#, C-C<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 53.46740<br/> 186.70497<br/> 319.94254<br/> 373.40994<br/> 506.64751<br/> 560.11491<br/> 693.35249<br/> 746.81988<br/> 880.05746<br/> 1013.29503<br/> 1066.76243<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s a 19-note version, Gb-B#, also C-C:</p><p>! mean2-5_19.scl<br/>!<br/>2/5-comma meantone, Gb-B# (19)<br/> 19<br/>!<br/> 53.46740<br/> 133.23757<br/> 186.70497<br/> 240.17237<br/> 319.94254<br/> 373.40994<br/> 426.87734<br/> 506.64751<br/> 560.11491<br/> 639.88509<br/> 693.35249<br/> 746.81988<br/> 826.59006<br/> 880.05746<br/> 933.52485<br/> 1013.29503<br/> 1066.76243<br/> 1120.22982<br/> 2/1</p><p>In historical meantones, the fifth is made somewhat narrow of pure in<br/>order to get regular major and minor thirds at or close to ratios of<br/>5:4 and 6:5, the 16th-17th century Renaissance/Manneristic standard of<br/>&quot;justness.&quot; However, even in the most heavily tempered meantones, this<br/>narrowing was generally limited to 1/3-comma, producing pure 6:5 minor<br/>thirds with both fifths and major thirds narrow by this amount (1/3 of<br/>a syntonic comma at 81:80 or 21.51 cents, about 7.17 cents), as<br/>discussed by Salinas (1577), or very slightly more in 19-equal (about<br/>7.22 cents), described and advocated by Costeley (1570).</p><p>Aaron has used 19-equal in a great original composition, &quot;The<br/>Juggler,&quot; and also in his outstanding electronic rendition of John<br/>Bull&apos;s chromatic hexachord piece using a sampled harpsichord timbre.</p><p>However, 2/5-comma meantone carries this temperament process further,<br/>resulting in something fascinatingly &quot;xenharmonic&quot; -- a meantone with<br/>minor thirds rather _larger_ than a pure 6:5, and regular diatonic<br/>semitones of around 133 cents, getting into the territory where a<br/>large semitone could be also be heard as a small neutral second. From<br/>a viewpoint of Renaissance theory, one might note that this interval<br/>is actually a just 27:25, a step occurring in 5-limit JI; from another<br/>viewpoint, it could be called a small neutral second about midway<br/>between 14:13 (about 128 cents) and 13:12 (about 139 cents).</p><p>A neat touch like 19-equal, but even more so: augmented seconds are<br/>somewhere between a usual major second and minor third, here about 240<br/>cents, which suggests a very wide major second but also in some<br/>contexts a very small minor third. Diminished thirds (C#-Eb, G#-Bb)<br/>are virtually pure 7:6 minor thirds!</p><p>An augmented third or &quot;Wolf fourth&quot; (Eb-G#), as in other typical<br/>meantones, is quite distinct from a usual perfect fourth -- and here,<br/>indeed, at about 427 cents, a neat very large major third of the 32:25<br/>or approximate 9:7 variety (like a diminished fourth in 1/4-comma, for<br/>example). A diminished fourth (e.g. C#-F, F#-Bb) is close to 13:10,<br/>like a Wolf fourth in Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma.</p><p>The _chromatic_ semitone at about 53 cents -- about 10 cents smaller<br/>than in 19-equal -- is very close to 33:32, a &quot;quartertone&quot; type of<br/>interval that can also serve as a small semitone.</p><p>Here the major third at around 373 cents, or 13 cents narrow of 5:4,<br/>is dramatically more impure than in typical historical meantones,<br/>although slightly less so than in 12-equal (in the opposite<br/>direction): any smaller and we might consider it also as a &quot;submajor&quot;<br/>third (just as 12-equal can be considered to approximate either<br/>5-limit or Pythagorean).</p><p>Paul Erlich and others have discussed some of the properties of<br/>26-equal, which carries the tempering yet further than in 2/5-comma,<br/>another &quot;neo-meantone.&quot;</p><p>(An aside on the 19-note version of 2/5-comma meantone: here an<br/>interesting variation on 4:5:6:7 is available, e.g. C#-E#-G#-Bb at<br/>around 0-373-693-960 cents.)</p><p>Anyway, this is an exciting tuning for exciting pieces: the<br/>&quot;quasi-neutral&quot; intervals, for example, might be used for variations<br/>on Near Eastern styles (although here without any close equivalent of<br/>a neutral third), and the diminished thirds as slendro-style steps:</p><p>         (proportional font suggested)</p><p>          Bb   C#   Eb    F   G#    Bb<br/>          0   240   507  693  933  1200<br/>           240   266  187  240  267</p><p>          C#  Eb   F#    G#   Bb    C#<br/>          0   266  507   693  960  1200<br/>           266   240  187  267  240</p><p>Anyway, Aaron, congratulations on your intrepidity in using a great<br/>&quot;modern&quot; meantone for some great pieces with your usual stylistic<br/>acumen.</p><p>This is a quick review, then back to Los Angeles, where Mom has been<br/>doing very well. Thanks to everyone for your support and encouragement<br/>for us both.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
