I&apos;ve played the Continuum and I loved it -- it<br/>is really a fantastic instrument for bending pitches around.<br/>But having no keys, it certainly is a different beast to play.<br/>I tried to convince the inventor to let me write software for<br/>it that would allow the user to map the surface into any<br/>number of regions for discreet microtonal scales, but he<br/>didn&apos;t take to the idea. He told me he conceived of it as a<br/>continuous pitch instrument, and that&apos;s how he wants it<br/>to stay.</p><p>Also, Aaron, I remember you mentioned wanting some<br/>kind of dynamic retuning for TBX1. EPC1 allows dynamic<br/>retuning, although it is not algorithmically based, it<br/>allows realtime control for regular keyboards connected<br/>to a TPX.</p><p>At any rate, I know you and others have good ideas<br/>about what you want from microtonal products, and<br/>I really want to encourage everyone to share ideas.<br/>I know it&apos;s a pain to join another forum and it may<br/>seem like TL or MMM is the best place to discuss such<br/>things, but I hope more of you will join and post on<br/>the H-Pi Prototypes and New Product Ideas forum:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=7">http://www.h-pi.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=7</a>&gt;<br/>It will help maintain focus and keeps all the information<br/>available to everyone all in one place.</p><p>The more I hear from people, the more I can design<br/>things people really want, and sell at prices people can<br/>really afford.</p><p>That reminds me I should announce that the price for<br/>TBX1 has dropped again from 329 to 299 USD. This is<br/>the second drop, as it started at 349. So, with more<br/>people buying, the prices do come down! Now, if I<br/>could just get them in stock... the shipping from<br/>Bulgaria has been delayed already 2 weeks behind<br/>schedule!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m interested in this sort of thing, but I have reservations about<br/>&gt; the lack of velocity sensitive weighted action...what you describe<br/>&gt; might be fine for organ style playing, but I&apos;d miss my pianist side<br/>&gt; view of the world....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m curious, Carl, what you found positive and negative besides the<br/>&gt; price, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone else played this hardware?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, I think it&apos;s great what you are doing, Aaron, I just think I need<br/>&gt; to hold out on this kind of thing until money and space allow me to<br/>&gt; have the right equipment, and for me that means some velocity<br/>&gt; sensitivity as well...the Haken Continuum is damn expesive, but looks<br/>&gt; more like the kind of thing I would want to go for.

A short set of short videos<br/>was made for this but the quality was bad. The plan<br/>is for a whole set of tutorial videos.</p><p>I comment on Plexus action here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28faq.html">http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28faq.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Plexus technique is different from a piano,<br/>for sure, which is to be expected since an<br/>array of buttons is not a lever action<br/>Halberstadt. Let&apos;s please refrain from making<br/>statements such as &quot;going back 500 years&quot;.</p><p>As for playing chords, of course you can still<br/>play chords, but they do not feel the same as<br/>chords on a piano, because a Plexus is not a<br/>piano. On a piano there are certain chord<br/>voicings which are more comfortable to play<br/>than others. Same for a Plexus, but the voicings<br/>which may be comfortable are not necessarily<br/>the same as the voicings which are comfortable<br/>on a piano. What&apos;s nice of course is that you<br/>can play chords that _aren&apos;t_on_ a piano:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/video/13thchords.mov">http://www.h-pi.com/video/13thchords.mov</a>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t anticipate rewriting of piano pieces for<br/>the Plexus. It is a new instrument which will<br/>engender new music. The videos showing Bach<br/>and Pachabel may be a bit misleading; they are<br/>up there because they are things people know<br/>which I had practiced a little and could play at<br/>the time while the camera was rolling. Again,<br/>a lot more new and better videos need to be<br/>made. There is only so much time in a day, but<br/>I will try to get some new things up.</p><p>To answer your last remark about remapping and<br/>changing the graphics of the key layout, the<br/>idea is that the layout doesn&apos;t need to change<br/>and shouldn&apos;t change. It is actually an adaptive<br/>tuning layout, meaning that if you select 205ET<br/>or 19ET or 17ET or 72ET and play the same<br/>pattern on the keyboard, you play the same<br/>melodic contour with the pitches taken from<br/>the tuning in question. To get a better sense of<br/>that, you can download TPXE and take a look at<br/>what are called &quot;region maps&quot;.<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a>&gt;<br/>The region map list is the box in the upper<br/>right corner of the screen, as shown here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28software.html">http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28software.html</a>&gt;<br/>If you check the boxes and click the arrows<br/>you will see the region maps change.<br/>Moreover, the structure of the keyboard is<br/>theoretically unified with a systematic<br/>taxonomy for all pitches and intervals and<br/>has a 1 to 1 key correspondence with<br/>MegaScore, so if you write in MegaScore<br/>for a tuning map other than 205ET or a<br/>variant thereof, it is true scordatura.</p><p>As for the idea of overlaying some other graphics<br/>over the keys, this could be done if you had a<br/>template, but the colors of the keys would remain<br/>the same. Moreover, it would be a lot of work,<br/>require that you send us files, cost money,<br/>and probably not look very good.

Let&apos;s please refrain from making<br/>&gt; statements such as &quot;going back 500 years&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for playing chords, of course you can still<br/>&gt; play chords, but they do not feel the same as<br/>&gt; chords on a piano, because a Plexus is not a<br/>&gt; piano.

There is only so much time in a day, but<br/>&gt; I will try to get some new things up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To answer your last remark about remapping and<br/>&gt; changing the graphics of the key layout, the<br/>&gt; idea is that the layout doesn&apos;t need to change<br/>&gt; and shouldn&apos;t change. It is actually an adaptive<br/>&gt; tuning layout, meaning that if you select 205ET<br/>&gt; or 19ET or 17ET or 72ET and play the same<br/>&gt; pattern on the keyboard, you play the same<br/>&gt; melodic contour with the pitches taken from<br/>&gt; the tuning in question. To get a better sense of<br/>&gt; that, you can download TPXE and take a look at<br/>&gt; what are called &quot;region maps&quot;.<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; The region map list is the box in the upper<br/>&gt; right corner of the screen, as shown here:<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28software.html">http://www.h-pi.com/TPX28software.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you check the boxes and click the arrows<br/>&gt; you will see the region maps change.<br/>&gt; Moreover, the structure of the keyboard is<br/>&gt; theoretically unified with a systematic<br/>&gt; taxonomy for all pitches and intervals and<br/>&gt; has a 1 to 1 key correspondence with<br/>&gt; MegaScore, so if you write in MegaScore<br/>&gt; for a tuning map other than 205ET or a<br/>&gt; variant thereof, it is true scordatura.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the idea of overlaying some other graphics<br/>&gt; over the keys, this could be done if you had a<br/>&gt; template, but the colors of the keys would remain<br/>&gt; the same. Moreover, it would be a lot of work,<br/>&gt; require that you send us files, cost money,<br/>&gt; and probably not look very good.
