I am working on this subject as a</p><p>project and will be privileged to hear your interpretations on the<br/>following</p><p>questions:</p><p>1. The light coming from an object is transformed into electrical<br/>signals by</p><p>the cells in the eye and then transmitted to the center of vision in<br/>the</p><p>brain. And the electrical signals there are turned into an image. For</p><p>example you actually see this message in your brain. Then who is the<br/>one</p><p>that sees and perceives the image of this message in the brain? How<br/>do you</p><p>define the consciousness that can see this image in the brain without<br/>the</p><p>need of an eye?</p><p>2. Brain is a piece of flesh composed of lipids, proteins and other<br/>various</p><p>molecules. Could the consciousness that sees this image be this piece<br/>of</p><p>flesh? Or could the brain cells make up a consciousness that sees<br/>these</p><p>electrical signals as a sea view or an e-mail message?</p><p>3. No light penetrates the skull, which means the brain is entirely<br/>in</p><p>darkness. Then how does such an illuminated, clear image is formed in<br/>this</p><p>pitch-dark place? For instance how are the rays of the sun seen over<br/>the</p><p>unlit brain cortex?</p><p>4. Also no sound enters the brain. This means there is deep muteness<br/>where</p><p>the brain exists. However, people listen to all different sounds<br/>inside the</p><p>brain. The sound waves are turned into electrical signals inside of<br/>the ear</p><p>and then transmitted to the center of hearing. And the consciousness<br/>inside</p><p>the brain listens to these for instance as a melody. Then who is it<br/>that</p><p>listens to the loud music aired from powerful loudspeakers and how?</p><p>5. The image is formed inside a miniature spot in the brain. Then how<br/>is the</p><p>three-dimensional image with depth is formed on this diminutive<br/>screen? For</p><p>instance when I look at the horizon or the sky, how is such an image<br/>with</p><p>vast depth is formed at this tiny spot of center of vision just as<br/>identical</p><p>to its original with the same depth and sense of distance? What is it<br/>that</p><p>gives me the feeling of distance and space?</p><p>6. When a person sees a glass of water, in fact he does not see its<br/>real</p><p>form but only a copy of it in his brain. The coldness that he feels<br/>when</p><p>touching the glass surface is not the real coldness of the glass but<br/>only a</p><p>copy of it. This means nobody is ever able to feel that he touches<br/>the real</p><p>glass. Since it is not his fingers that feel the sense of touch, but<br/>merely</p><p>the sense of touch in the brain. Should we not in this case conclude<br/>that</p><p>people are never able to reach the reality of objects and can never<br/>touch</p><p>the reality of a glass? But not every person knows this fact.<br/>Everyone</p><p>thinks they touch and see real objects. Is it not strange that people<br/>are</p><p>not aware of this and they never think about this?</p><p>7. Nothing changes when a person is hit by a bus or comes across a<br/>lion.</p><p>Since, just like the image of the bus, the sense of collision or the<br/>fear</p><p>while running away from a lion, all form in the brain. When I see a<br/>bus, I</p><p>see it at the center of vision inside my brain. If I go and hold the<br/>door of</p><p>the bus, I feel the coldness of the metal inside my brain. Then I<br/>cannot</p><p>discriminate from this fact what happens when I feel pain if a bus<br/>hits or a</p><p>lion bites. Then is it not very illogical when people say &apos;it shows I<br/>am in</p><p>contact with the bus or the lion because I feel pain when the bus<br/>hits or</p><p>the lion bites&apos;?</p><p>8. We live the entire period of our lives inside our brains. In a<br/>similar</p><p>way, we also have dreams in our brain. For instance when we touch a<br/>piece of</p><p>ice in our dream, we feel it is wet and cold. Or, when we smell a<br/>rose, we</p><p>get the wonderful scent of it. We again sense the feelings of fear,<br/>pain,</p><p>anxiety and panic in a similar fashion. Then are the dreams and the<br/>real</p><p>life the same in this sense?</p><p>9. The person&apos;s own body is also included in the images a person see.<br/>So, a</p><p>person only sees the copy of his own body. This means every person<br/>all</p><p>through his life lives in the cave in his skull where he never knows<br/>what is</p><p>outside, including his own body and other objects. Now think over<br/>this</p><p>happening once more: Right now are you inside of the room you are<br/>present or</p><p>is the room inside of you? Isn&apos;t the second alternative the right<br/>answer</p><p>scientifically?</p><p>10. Let us imagine 5 different people who look at a garden of roses.<br/>Since</p><p>every one of these people see the rose garden in his own brain, then<br/>aren&apos;t</p><p>there 5 different rose gardens in the brains of every one of the 5<br/>people?</p><p>Is the color red that each one sees the same with the other&apos;s<br/>perception of</p><p>red? Would there be any possibility to compare these?</p><p>11. We say that the original objects we see the copies of in our<br/>brain exist</p><p>outside, but what if nothing exists outside? Because we never have<br/>the</p><p>ability to test this or observe this. Then is it not dubious that the</p><p>original objects are outside? At least there is a 50-50 percent<br/>possibility.</p><p>Then how can we be sure that the original objects are outside? If<br/>there is</p><p>no original object outside, then what is the entity that makes the<br/>images</p><p>and the senses in our brain?</p><p>12. If we are living an illusion that has the possibility of not<br/>having any</p><p>reality outside, then we may be existing in a very different place.<br/>For</p><p>instance is it not possible for the entire humanity to exist right<br/>over a</p><p>piece of crystal? Or is it not possible that the complete history of</p><p>humanity has been experienced in a place not bigger than the head of<br/>a pin?</p><p>Would there be anything to stop us thinking in such a broad extent?</p><p>13. Some people are incredibly afraid when these topics are<br/>discussed? What</p><p>do you think the reason for this may be?</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Greg</p></div><h3><a id=1298 href="#1298">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>11/29/2001 6:58:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., greg_donald2000@y... wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_1297.html#1297">/makemicromusic/topicId_1297.html#1297</a></p><p>&gt; 6.

You&apos;ve touched on one of the most fundamental &quot;philosophical&quot;<br/>questions existing in the entire field of philosophy.  Philosophers<br/>have debated this question since practically the beginning of<br/>time...  from Plato onward, anyway.</p><p>This is, however, essentially a *practical* music forum, though, so<br/>your thoughts would be much better placed on a forum<br/>called &quot;metatuning...&quot;</p><p><a href="/metatuning/messages">/metatuning/messages</a></p><p>You should repost this discussion over there.  I can think of a few<br/>people who might be interested in it... but not on *this* particular<br/>forum.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
