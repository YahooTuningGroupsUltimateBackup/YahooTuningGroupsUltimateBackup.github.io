And that&apos;s<br/>certainly the case with these two cuts. The first one started as an<br/>intended collaboration with Scott Dakota, but he was unable to<br/>participate at that time so I ended up just finishing it. The second<br/>cut is the unfinished instrumental parts to an intended collaboration<br/>with vocalist Debra Shea for the band AzayKoÂ—-see clang on this site<br/>for an example of a finished cut with this project. Though both are<br/>different from their intended ends, and one is incomplete, I think<br/>both hold up very well and represent a style or sound I call<br/>oldworld/otherworld.</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I think these things are cyclic in a way and I see much<br/>light at the end of my tunnel. Sometimes life picks you up and drops<br/>you off and it takes a while before can get your bearings and find<br/>your way back home...<br/>here&apos;s a couple more uploads from the same timeframe.<br/>They&apos;re two short vocal quartets:</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/>wajahejah<br/>taKmak</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
