And that&apos;s<br/>certainly the case with these two cuts. The first one started as an<br/>intended collaboration with Scott Dakota, but he was unable to<br/>participate at that time so I ended up just finishing it. The second<br/>cut is the unfinished instrumental parts to an intended collaboration<br/>with vocalist Debra Shea for the band AzayKoÂ—-see clang on this site<br/>for an example of a finished cut with this project. Though both are<br/>different from their intended ends, and one is incomplete, I think<br/>both hold up very well and represent a style or sound I call<br/>oldworld/otherworld.</p></div><h3><a id=8267 href="#8267">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
