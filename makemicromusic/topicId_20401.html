This comes with a hexaphonic<br/>guitar pickup which picks up each string and converts your playing to<br/>midi.</p><p>Using that and a soft synth I played my guitar in Carlos Alpha tuning<br/>with a piano sound. The output is glitchy (I&apos;ve only had about an hour<br/>playing time) but not too bad. All I did was increase the tempo by<br/>twice to make this improvisation flow better. All of the weird bends<br/>are there even though they shouldn&apos;t be... I&apos;m working on that.</p><p>This of course opens a new avenue for me and microtonal because the<br/>construction of the guitar makes certain intervals easier to play.</p><p>Chris</p><p>(Mike, it&apos;s been a really long day and I didn&apos;t want to fight scala<br/>with your scale just yet)</p></div>
