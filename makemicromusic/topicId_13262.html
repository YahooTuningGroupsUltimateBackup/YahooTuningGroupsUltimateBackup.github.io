I have learned many things from all and<br/>tried to find my way.</p><p>These days I&apos;m thinking about modes in 24-edl and 12-ado. Last night I<br/>was testing something , I found that we can have 3 different system due<br/>to size of their adjusent steps :</p><p>1- systems with equal steps = edo system</p><p>2- systems with un-equal steps:</p><p>  Like Edl system and systems with different algorithm, = - Steps with<br/>Increasing sizes</p><p>- Steps with decreasing sizes=like Ado system and systems with different<br/>algorithm.</p><p>So we can have 2 region for equalness and unequalness of systems steps<br/>which their border is edos. Steps of equal-degree edl and ado systems<br/>are the same size but in reverse order.</p><p>I talked about modes in 24-edl and 12-ado , some of my tests shows good<br/>sounding.</p><p>Edl with cardinality as k*12 show tetrachord with different <a href="http://steps.in">steps.in</a><br/>24-edl , the first has (cardinality/4) steps and second ,<br/>(cardinality/6) steps.</p><p>A new system which I found is ADL ( arithematic divisions of length )<br/>wich is a subset of edl.</p><p>But dear margo,about your work on talai ,</p><p>Can you tell me more about pepperment temperament , although I believe<br/>that temperament related to edl systems in lutes are kinds of irregular<br/>.</p><p>I refretted my setar in 24-edl and saw that for string tuned fourth or<br/>fifth apart , we have 2 different trend of steps starting from 4/3 or<br/>3/2 . this is also seen in different tunings of strings :</p><p>1/1  :  24/23  12/11  8/7   6/5   24/19  4/3   24/17  3/2   8/5   12/7<br/>24/13  2/1</p><p>4/3  : 18/17  9/8   6/5   9/7   18/13  3/2   36/23  18/11 12/7  9/5<br/>36/19  2/1</p><p>24/17: 17/16  17/15  17/14  17/13 17/12  34/23  17/11  34/21  17/10<br/>34/19  17/9   2/1</p><p>3/2  : 16/15  8/7   16/13  4/3   32/23  16/11  32/21  8/5   32/19  16/9<br/>32/17  2/1</p><p>So adapting these to real orchestral style is very difficult !!!</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Shaahin Mohaajeri</p><p>Tombak Player &amp; Researcher , Composer</p><p>My web site : <a href="http://240edo.tripod.com/index.html">http://240edo.tripod.com/index.html</a><br/>&lt;blocked::<a href="http://240edo.tripod.com/index.html">http://240edo.tripod.com/index.html</a>&gt;</p><p>My tombak musics in Rhythmweb: <a href="http://www.rhythmweb.com/gdg">www.rhythmweb.com/gdg</a></p><p>My articles in Harmonytalk:</p><p><a href="http://www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000296.html">www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000296.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000288.html">www.harmonytalk.com/archives/000288.html</a></p><p>My article in DrumDojo:</p><p><a href="http://www.drumdojo.com/world/persia/tonbak_acoustics.htm">www.drumdojo.com/world/persia/tonbak_acoustics.htm</a></p><p>My musics in Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia :</p><p>- A composition based on a folk melody of Shiraz region, in shur-dastgah<br/>by Mohajeri Shahin &lt;<a href="http://www.xenharmony.org/mp3/shaahin/shur.mp3">http://www.xenharmony.org/mp3/shaahin/shur.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>- An experiment in Iranian homayun and chahargah modes by Mohajeri<br/>Shahin &lt;<a href="http://www.xenharmony.org/mp3/shaahin/homayun.mp3">http://www.xenharmony.org/mp3/shaahin/homayun.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2006 7:15:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Shaahin,</p><p>Please let me try very briefly here to answer your question about<br/>Peppermint, and to say that your comment about composing in the style<br/>of the year1200 was very humorous to me because often that&apos;s very much<br/>what I&apos;m doing. This is a great era of classical music, both Near<br/>Eastern and European.</p><p>&gt; Can you tell me more about pepperment temperament , although I believe<br/>&gt; that temperament related to edl systems in lutes are kinds of<br/>&gt; irregular .</p><p>First, please let me be sure that I&apos;ve clarified that Peppermint is a<br/>temperament rather different than the kind of just EDL system you are<br/>discussing in terms of fretting ratios, although it has close<br/>approximations of EDL ratios such 14:13:12 or 13:12:11.</p><p>The best way for me to answer your question would be to post some new<br/>music in Peppermint here, and especially music in a maye like Shur or<br/>a Maqaam such as Bayyati or Husayni, say.</p><p>That&apos;s just what I want to do, and in the meantime I can give some<br/>links to articles that I&apos;ve also posted on the newsgroup<br/>rec.music.early regarding Peppermint and classic 13th-14th century<br/>music, both Near Eastern and European:</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1p4pe.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1p4pe.txt</a>&gt;<br/>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1t4pm.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1t4pm.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>There&apos;s also a quick point I would make about EDL or arithmetic<br/>tunings: John Chalmers investigated this, and pointed out that while<br/>people like Kathleen Schlesinger and Elsie Hamilton focused on an<br/>arithmetic series, Ptolemy and other Greek theorists seem very focused<br/>on tetrachords. John therefore suggested the use of &quot;triaphonic&quot;<br/>scales, for example, which combine the two approaches, like this<br/>17-note example from the Scala archives:</p><p>! triaphonic_17.scl<br/>!<br/>17-tone Triaphonic Cycle, conjunctive form on 4/3, 7/6 and 9/7<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 28/27<br/> 14/13<br/> 28/25<br/> 7/6<br/> 28/23<br/> 14/11<br/> 4/3<br/> 112/81<br/> 56/39<br/> 112/75<br/> 14/9<br/> 21/13<br/> 42/25<br/> 7/4<br/> 42/23<br/> 21/11<br/> 2/1</p><p>One big caution: I want to be very careful about discussing tunings of<br/>instruments I haven&apos;t played myself. That&apos;s why I might leave<br/>questions about string frettings to people who have actually tuned or<br/>played them.</p><p>Again, my best response to many of your questions is to record and<br/>post some music -- and I hope to do so soon.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2006 7:51:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/16/06, Margo Schulter &lt;<a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Shaahin,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me try very briefly here to answer your question about<br/>&gt; Peppermint, and to say that your comment about composing in the style<br/>[...]</p><p>Hey!

Therefore I call the basic regular temperament the<br/>&quot;Wilson/Pepper temperament.&quot;</p><p>In June of 2000 or so, I got the idea of two 12-note chains<br/>yielding some pure 7:6 thirds, and it turned out this<br/>arrangement produced a fine 2-3-7-9-11-13 JI approximation.</p><p>Again, here are two articles originally posted to Usenet&apos;s<br/>rec.music.early on Peppermint for European and Near Eastern<br/>styles:</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1p4pe.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1p4pe.txt</a>&gt;<br/>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1t4pm.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/rme1t4pm.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m preparing some new music in Peppermint, but in the<br/>meantime here&apos;s a piece in my typical classical medieval<br/>European style in MIDI or ogg:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop020.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop020.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop001.ogg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/coop001.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>and another piece in this kind of style taking advantage of<br/>some sonorities like a near-7:9:11 in two MIDI registrations:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/o_europ08.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/o_europ08.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/o_europ09.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/o_europ09.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, I find Peppermint a wonderful temperament for styles<br/>inspired by Near Eastern music -- although I&apos;d be interested<br/>in the opinions of people for whom this music is a &quot;first<br/>language.&quot; Here&apos;s a setting that might fit the Persian<br/>Dastgah Shur or the Arabic Maqaam Husayni:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/huscond6.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/huscond6.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here the basic scale, with C4 as middle C and an asterisk *<br/>indicating a note on the upper keyboard raised by 58.68<br/>cents, is:</p><p>    E   F*   G   A   B   C*  D   E<br/>    0  138  287 496 704 842 992 1200</p><p>This approximates 1/1-13/12-13/11-4/3-3/2-13/8-39/22-2/1.</p><p>Please let me add that generally I&apos;d rather post actual<br/>keyboard performances rather than MIDI files, and am getting<br/>ready to record some Peppermint pieces.</p><p>It&apos;s appropriate in this thread warmly to thank Shaahin for<br/>discussions about Persian music and intonational systems,<br/>including Peppermint as one possibility. My recordings of<br/>live keyboard pieces will, I hope, provide an opportunity to<br/>share some of the aspects of these discussions in a context<br/>of actual music -- a gift which, as Aaron and I have just<br/>noted, Shaahin has most generously and vibrantly bestowed on<br/>our group.</p><p>Peace and love, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p><p>P.S.

And the terminology just makes it a turn-off (speaking<br/>personally, although I know I&apos;m not the first to say so).</p><p>All this being said, I&apos;m quite certain that the tuning world would be further<br/>back without Gene&apos;s (and others on tuning-math) work!</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2006 9:53:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/18/06, daniel_anthony_stearns &lt;<a href="mailto:daniel_anthony_stearns@yahoo.com">daniel_anthony_stearns@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; gene, you&apos;re free to post whatever you like, and i&apos;m sure me saying so<br/>&gt; or not saying doesn&apos;t matter one bit to you. But have ever considered<br/>&gt; what this reads like to &quot;lingo&quot; outsider--or even a non-tuning forum<br/>&gt; microtonalist? Why is that important? Well, it&apos;s probably not, and i&apos;m<br/>&gt; actually NOT hostile to the work you&apos;re doing and it&apos;s probably better<br/>&gt; tohave little names and tags and titles than it is mathematical<br/>&gt; equations and lengthy notes to explain every new term.....but in the<br/>&gt; same way that you will NEVER see the tuningmath list overrun with<br/>&gt; people posting music--has there ever even been one?--I think it&apos;s at<br/>&gt; least worth wondering why there&apos;s a tuning-math list and a make<br/>&gt; microtonal music list .For an anyone but a diehard internet forum<br/>&gt; cultist, this much condensed jargon is like a forcefield shutting out<br/>&gt; any simple inquiry or even the idea that maybe if you studied the<br/>&gt; terminology for the next couple years you might have some idea what is<br/>&gt; microtonal music. I know it&apos;s not your style, but Margo probably lays<br/>&gt; just as much alien jargon on the average non-member of the cult as you<br/>&gt; do, but she usually goes to some length to add a narrative that at<br/>&gt; least makes you feel you have a chance to know what any of it&apos;s about.<br/>&gt; just some thoughts...</p><p>These are good points, Dan, especially about the idea of tuning-math<br/>&quot;overrun with people posting music&quot;, that&apos;s hilarious because it&apos;s<br/>dead-on. I&apos;m going to take it as a challenge and compose something in<br/>Leapday, now that I know what it is.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested, [1 21 15 11 8] means the third harmonic is one<br/>fifth, 5 is 21 fifths, 7 is 15 fifths, 11 is 11 fifths, and 13 is 8<br/>fifths. A very complex temperament for my taste, but I&apos;ll write<br/>something in it anyway. I think I can at least wrap my mind around the<br/>minor third being 13/11 and the major third 14/11.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2006 6:45:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plopper6&quot; &lt;billwestfall@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; gene, you&apos;re free to post whatever you like, ....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d agree and say as a fan I&apos;d sure like to HEAR some more music and<br/>&gt; examples.
