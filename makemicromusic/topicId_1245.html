Mats, would you care to share a little about Radiant Slab - is &gt;it a collective, and artists website, a company, a ??? Great collection</p><p>As far as i know, it&apos;s a site. I am not affiliated with RS other than that<br/>i&apos;ve been posting in the collaboration projects since a long time.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Ever experiment with any of the granular synthesis programs out there? &gt;&gt;Granular is one of my faves. Just amazing what you can do with this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Pass along any tips, as I&apos;m interested in granular for a future project...</p><p>Well i haven&apos;t been using granulation a lot because it gets too regular in<br/>the long run. Just recently i have used the Audiomulch granulator for pitch<br/>shifting effects-as i can be set to any cent value, i can use several in<br/>cross-mixing which creates a varying complex out of a static note input.</p><p>I have been using DFX Transverb a lot, and most recently the Deconstructor<br/>by Toby Bear,which is an 8-step sequencer and sampler/reorderer with<br/>different effects. I use 2 of them in parallel with cross feedback, and i<br/>will post some pieces made with this on RS soon.</p><p>/&#xFFFD;</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></p></div>
