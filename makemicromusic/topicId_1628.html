A company called Grey Matter Response<br/>created an amazing add-on board for the original DX7<br/>which supported oxtrea patch memory and a number of<br/>additional features, including 16 full-keyboard<br/>programmable tuning tables with a resolution of 4096<br/>units per octave. Programming could occur from the<br/>front panel or via sysex. The E! board also had a<br/>couple of macros built in to generate EDO scale tables<br/>and also 12t octave scales with quarter-tone detuning.</p><p>The DX7II was when Yamaha started featuring built-in<br/>retuning support.</p><p>Perhaps owners of the FM7 software could request that<br/>the company add support at least for the Grey Matter<br/>tuning table message, or perhaps even the TX802 tuning<br/>table sysex format.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
