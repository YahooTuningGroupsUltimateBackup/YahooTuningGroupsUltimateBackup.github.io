Creating Microtonal Music does not have a ban on posting tuning issues, on discussing the required mathematics behind some of what we do here. *All* of the discussion relating to &quot;Peace Gongs&quot; is well and good. Why? Because it relates directly to a piece of music!</p><p>We have the main tuning list for more general discussions, especially when brainstorming or exploring the edges. We have tuning-math for the intense and specific investigations into the numerical, topological, and spread-sheet-ological matters musical (or tuning, at least). And here, we just try to either look at what has happened in a piece of music, or look at what _can_ happen in a piece of music.</p><p>You are *all* intelligent, sentient beings. Mom trusts your good judgement in all these matters, and (as always) Mom will love you no matter how you choose to behave. Mom might give you a &quot;Time Out&quot;, but Mom will love you! :)</p><p>Jon (who hopes a future sample will replace the list administrator...)</p></div>
