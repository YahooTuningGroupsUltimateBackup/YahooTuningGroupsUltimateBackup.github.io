It can do it already if the music is on a wind<br/>instrument of suitable timbre such as a flute,<br/>or something which is very amenable to the technique.</p><p>&gt; May I ask, how do you cope with note transitions? How do you decide<br/>&gt; what discrete pitches to choose? Surely the thrush does not sing in<br/>&gt; discrete pitches.</p><p>Yes you are right, that&apos;s maybe not so very reaalistic of it<br/>to make it into a scale, though it is interesting as a kind<br/>of found scale coming out of the interaction between the<br/>program and the bird song.</p><p>It takes the average pitch during a glissandi and when it<br/>slides far enough makes a new pitch. You can play it with<br/>pitch glides between them all I suppose strictly speaking<br/>it should try and transcribe it using continuously varying<br/>pitches.</p><p>I just tried slowing down the thrushes song and it does have<br/>many large pitch glissandi. Some other birds are a bit more discrete<br/>in the pitches they sing.</p><p>&gt; My suggestion for extracting scales from melodic performances is as<br/>&gt; follows. Normal audio signals plot energy over time. After continuous<br/>&gt; pitch extraction, we have pitch over time. If we apply a time-domain<br/>&gt; transform to *that*, we have &apos;pitch frequencies&apos; -- the amount of time<br/>&gt; the performer spent playing each pitch in the entire performance (the<br/>&gt; duration of musical tones is typically great compared to the period of<br/>&gt; musical pitches, so I think we&apos;re OK here). We can now slice the pitch<br/>&gt; continuum into octaves, and in each octave hopefully see a manageable<br/>&gt; number of Gaussian lumps (if not, we might say there is no discrete<br/>&gt; scale abstraction used in the performance). When we superimpose these<br/>&gt; octave slices, a majority of lumps hopefully coincide. Finally, the<br/>&gt; local maxima of this summed function are written to a Scala file.</p><p>Does this make sense? Perhaps we should take this to the tuning<br/>list...</p><p>Yes could do that. FTS extracts the notes as a sequence<br/>of volume, time and frequency triples. So one could analyse<br/>those however one wants to try and extract the scale.</p><p>At present it just analyses them by using a tolerance<br/>factor. It orders all the pitches in ascending order,<br/>using an interval of equivalence set by the user,<br/>or it can just use the highest pitch found as the interval<br/>of equivalence if that is appropriate.</p><p>Then it walks up the scale and bundles the pitches<br/>using the tolerance limit as it finds them.<br/>So you set the tolerance limit high enough to allow<br/>for variability in pitch but low enough to distinguish<br/>pitches that should be distinguished so will depend on<br/>the context. Or one could just use all the pitches<br/>found in ascending order by making the tolerance<br/>level 0.</p><p>I don&apos;t do anything about weighting by the duration of the pitches, but one<br/>could do that too, especially since longer duration pitches<br/>are perhaps likely to be pitched more exactly, or heard<br/>with more exactness of pitch too, I mean a grace note<br/>of just a hundredth of a second for instance may not<br/>be so exactly pitched as a one second note for instance.<br/>So maybe one could take that into account. I could<br/>add an option to FTS to print out all the pitches found<br/>as pitch / volume / duration triples for anyone to analyse<br/>as they please using their own software too.<br/>Well it is visible in the interface but<br/>as three rows of numbers - you could just<br/>use those too copy / paste and use them<br/>as input to ones program.</p><p>I&apos;ve cc&apos;d this reply to the main tuning list.</p><p>I&apos;ll take a look at the next few digests<br/>in case there are any replies on this<br/>particular thread. It&apos;s relevant to what I&apos;m working<br/>on in the programming right now so for me it&apos;s<br/>&quot;work&quot; :-). But with the high volume of posts<br/>there I&apos;ll probably miss some replies if it<br/>gets followed up much - that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m<br/>uninterested, just working hard that&apos;s<br/>all right now on the FTS 3.0 release.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message ----- From: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, April 13, 2005 10:20 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Digest Number 1187</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are 3 messages in this issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      1.

This basic type of pattern is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      0   2   4   6   8   9   11<br/>&gt;      0  218 436 655 873 982 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Part of the fun was finding synthesizer timbres so that the 6-step<br/>&gt; interval (about 654.55 cents) would serve musically as a &quot;fifth.&quot; The<br/>&gt; fact that it&apos;s considerably narrow of 3:2 makes possible a special<br/>&gt; effect: when the excellent 11-tET major third (just wide of a pure<br/>&gt; 9:7) expands to a fifth, both voices move by a semitone of 1 step<br/>&gt; (about 109.09 cents), a progression I use to open the piece. This<br/>&gt; progression calls for some steps outside the above basic hexatonic<br/>&gt; scale, here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     5   6<br/>&gt;     1   0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the final cadence formula is available within the basic<br/>&gt; scale:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      9  11<br/>&gt;      8  6<br/>&gt;      2  0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This might be approximately described as a xentonal variation on a<br/>&gt; 13th-century European formula where an outer minor sixth (here very<br/>&gt; close to a just 14:9) expands to an octave and an upper minor second<br/>&gt; to a fourth. Both the original and this 11-EDO variation are very<br/>&gt; moving and and powerful and beautiful, each in its own way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, sooner or later I wanted to document this tuning/timbre, but<br/>&gt; the desire for a &quot;change of pace&quot; gave me an immediate incentive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, thank you both for your response to this piece, and for your<br/>&gt; beautiful music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peace and love,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 2<br/>&gt;   Date: Wed, 13 Apr 2005 20:08:21 +0100<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Improvisation on pitches from a recording of a song thrush<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/improvisation_on_thrush_song_pitches.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/improvisation_on_thrush_song_pitches.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [4 Mb]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 3<br/>&gt;   Date: Wed, 13 Apr 2005 13:34:20 -0700<br/>&gt;   From: Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Improvisation on pitches from a recording of a song thrush<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Hi there,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/improvisation_on_thrush_song_pitches.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/improvisation_on_thrush_song_pitches.mp3</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[4 Mb]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fascinating!
