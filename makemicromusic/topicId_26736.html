And yes, I&apos;m a layman. I&apos;m so far from professional I can&apos;t even see amateur from here. My entire &quot;corpus&quot;, mostly of unfinished experiments, can be found here:<br/><a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/music.html">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/music.html</a> . If you like &quot;neo-classical&quot; music, then you might like &quot;Resolve&quot;, which uses all twelve tones but isn&apos;t in the Schoenbergian style. There are some other classical-ish pieces there, but they&apos;re a little too typical to be interesting.</p><p>&gt; More importantly, I think the opinion of the non-professional musician, if<br/>&gt; that&apos;s what you are, as you claim, is pertinent. Speaking for myself, I find<br/>&gt; that I would rather write a piece that I felt had a deep craft that I<br/>&gt; appreciated, yet spoke to the largest possible population. Like Mozart said:<br/>&gt; &quot;great music has something for the connoisseur and the commoner both&quot;.</p><p>Well, if you&apos;re focused on neoclassical music, then you&apos;re not exactly reaching for the mass market. But I hear what you&apos;re saying; there&apos;s something special about reaching someone who&apos;s not an expert in the field, without pandering to them with a saccharine &quot;product&quot;. We want to write things that we can be proud of *and* that lots of people like. It&apos;s a tall order, but a worthwhile goal.</p><p>On another matter, I can see why Michael Sheiman took offense to your language; it&apos;s similar to the kind of thing &quot;literary&quot; authors and reviewers say about &quot;genre&quot; fiction (science fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, etc.). Some of the best science fiction is of the highest literary quality, and some literary fiction is offal (pun intended). Sometimes literary authors will write stories that clearly fall into some genre, but because they&apos;re not &quot;genre&quot; writers, it will get acclaim that well-written science fiction will never see. Similarly, even if you see what Michael does as &quot;pop/dance&quot; (which he clearly doesn&apos;t), that doesn&apos;t mean his aspirations aren&apos;t similarly broad or artistic.</p><p>Not that it sounded like you meant to offend him.

From that you could deduce that calling a piano piece a &quot;song&quot; might not be understood by everyone. The same dictionary has many definitions for &quot;pop&quot;, none of them relevant, and no definition for &quot;pop music&quot;. The Free Online Dictionary has &quot;Of, relating to, or specializing in popular music&quot;. This definition is of no use at all in determining what your objection is to &quot;pop&quot; as an adjective in your case.</p><p>&gt;just don&apos;t send me on a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; trying to look up the term myself (especially when, chances are, many online sources ALSO misuse the term...Lord knows how many web pages I&apos;ve seen mention &quot;instrumental songs&quot; with no singers).&nbsp;</p><p>I&apos;ve just proven it&apos;s easy to look up &quot;song&quot; and see that &quot;song&quot; in classical music is simply the ordinary English meaning you will find in any dictionary. What&apos;s hard, and may be impossible, is looking up whatever fine distinctions you have in mind.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However you do not have the right to go around expecting me to learn most terms in classical music in advance considering it&apos;s not one of the genres I want to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>People might expect you to know ordinary English. However, I agree flaming you was not the best response. But you have NO right whatsoever to expect people to know all the obscure terminology of whatever genre you like, whose name I may not even pronounce since I don&apos;t know what it is and you&apos;ve ruled out both &quot;pop&quot; and &quot;rock&quot;. People complain I expect them to know what, for instance, an &quot;abelian group&quot; is, but at least I give links and definitions. You just sit back and expect, and then flame people for not knowing something they will not find in a dictionary nor in any easy manner, if at all, online.</p><p>&gt; Occasionally I will make mistakes, no big deal...give me a clear link to an answer and I will read it.&nbsp; But don&apos;t expect me to have psychic powers to guess what you mean in advance by saying things like &quot;It&apos;s not a song*(&amp;^&amp;*(!!!...&quot; (which only tell me I&apos;m wrong but doesn&apos;t give me the faintest clue what the right term is).</p><p>Carl tends to be quick on the draw. However, did it not occur to you to look the word up? When people flame you for what they see as bad diction, that can help. You might even be able to come back with a suitably snotty reply.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Also, knock on wood...genre definitions are fairly easy to find and consistently defined (almost anywhere online<br/> while the definitions of terms like Motet, Polyphony vs. Hetrophony...are not (often different sources have different definitions for such terms).</p><p>Actually, the complete opposite is true. You ain&apos;t gonna find out what &quot;pop&quot; means by grubbing about online. The Wikipedia article says its a special kind of popular music, featuring short, simple songs often oriented to the young and inclusive of at least some rock or soft rock and roll. Which doesn&apos;t help me much, presuming it is even accurate. Your music, you say, isn&apos;t pop. What about the Beatles? The Lovin&apos; Spoonful? The Carpenters? U2? How the hell do I know? On the other hand the definitions of classical subgenres seem to me to be much more helpful.</p><p>&gt; And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s exactly a fair comparison...looking up the historical terms proves much more challenging.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&apos;t think you tried, or you would have discovered that, unlike pop, it&apos;s actually not challenging.</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 2:36:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Mar 10, 2011 at 4:03 PM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I basically, at the outset, wouldn&apos;t respect a musician (beyond basic<br/>&gt; human<br/>&gt; &gt; courtesy) anyone who ignored something so vastly great as Bach&apos;s music,<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; for being ignorant of it---no, because we are all ignorant about lots of<br/>&gt; &gt; things---but for knowing it&apos;s there, knowing that just about every great<br/>&gt; &gt; musician in history has bowed to Bach&apos;s genius, and deciding that it was<br/>&gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; worth their time.

You wouldn&apos;t be the first, and you&apos;re not likely<br/>&gt; to be the last.</p><p>But I&apos;m *not* proud of it!  I was going to add that the reason I haven&apos;t listened to any Bach in entirety is because I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m musically intelligent enough to appreciate Bach in any meaningful sense, but I left that part out.  *Most* classical music is as vast and incomprehensible to me as the night sky; I don&apos;t understand its patterns, I can&apos;t parse its layers, and the only way I can respond to it emotionally is to let it wash over me like a wave of sound and see if the overall texture of the piece moves me or not.  I can&apos;t relate to it and it makes me feel stupid.  The only exception to this for me is minimalism, which I can understand and therefore relate to.</p><p>For me to relate to a piece of music, I have to understand how it is put together enough to put something similar together myself.  I can&apos;t compose classical music, I don&apos;t understand even basic counter-point, and when I&apos;ve tried to learn, it has gone very poorly.  I can&apos;t even fake it the way I can sometimes plausibly fake jazz (another universe of music outside my comprehension).</p><p>Put it this way: to say classical music is &quot;Greek&quot; to me would be a gross understatement; it&apos;s more like &quot;Cantonese&quot;.</p><p>&gt; My opinion is that you&apos;d only stand to gain and benefit from changing that<br/>&gt; path.

I&apos;d have to go back to school for it, no question.  Taking private lessons is not nearly immersive enough for me to learn the language.  Given that my music serves primarily my leisure and perhaps also my narcissism, expending effort to improve my compositional techniques and what not would not really be of any value to me as a human being, since I can already write (more or less) the sort of music that I am interested in writing.</p><p>Yet, unlike some people, I begrudge people neither their ignorance nor their education.  I don&apos;t see any form of music as being superior or inferior to any other.  I don&apos;t see a 3 minute pop song as having any more or less aesthetic value as a 4-movement symphony.  To me that would be like saying Spanish is a &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; language than Mandarin Chinese.  I listen to and write what I can relate to, and I expect that it is the same for all musicians.  If someone cannot relate to a certain musical idiom and is not willing to take the time to learn to appreciate it, that&apos;s no more reprehensible than refusing to learn a language in order to read the works of that language&apos;s great poets.  I could care less how many people speak the same musical language that I do, or whether my works are in a musical language intelligible to the majority of my countrymen.</p><p>But I also don&apos;t care if I&apos;m paid for my music, I don&apos;t care if I get a reputation for my music, and I don&apos;t care about how my music serves any social or political goals.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 3:42:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/</a></p><p>I remember that site!
