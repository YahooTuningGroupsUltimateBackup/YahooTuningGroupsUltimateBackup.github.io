This performance at the Oddmusic Convergence used the same tuning (19 ET), equipment and software as GR-20 Hexaphonic 19-ET Guitar Improvisation with the exception that Session Drummer 3 was added.</p><p>Using that video and the original midi I combined video effects plus the output of &quot;Marktxt&quot; to the original performance</p><p>I applied that program to a large number of lyrics by Evan Harrington and myself and used the output as the basis of the text<br/>in this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4</a></p><p>All of the media associated with this project is here:<br/><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/</a></p><p>including the high quality version of the video (230 megs)<br/><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/performance-enhanced.wmv">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/performance-enhanced.wmv</a></p><p>Details can be found on my blog post <a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=68">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=68</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chris</p></div>
