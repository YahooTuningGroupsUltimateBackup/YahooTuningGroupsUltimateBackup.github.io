My initial thoughts were<br/>to set up a website, get an URL, put it up on my space, and just for now have<br/>an online mission statement, and et it grow as response to it does. Part of<br/>the mission statement would be to bridge the east/west coast divide with<br/>something central, as well as to make the Chicago megapolis more &apos;micro/JI&apos;<br/>aware and concert lively, pehaps with a grant-supported concert series<br/>someday?</p><p>My thought(s) for an acronym was MiMiExMa or MiMiMa--the &quot;Midwest Microtonal<br/>and Experimental Music Association&quot; or the latter without the &apos;experimental&apos;<br/>part, which makes it seem to have more specific and narrower goals. (Although<br/>I like the idea of microtonality being a major but not total part of the<br/>picture, in other words, it&apos;s nnot my only interest to push)</p><p>I know this requires *major* work, but I can dream can&apos;t I?</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p><p>-Aaron.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p></div>
