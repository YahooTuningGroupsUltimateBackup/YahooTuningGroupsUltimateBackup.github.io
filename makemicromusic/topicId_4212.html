Too<br/>&gt;&gt;often, people write for &quot;string quartet&quot;, and then  listen to a &quot;MIDI<br/>&gt;&gt;realization&quot; and feel that&apos;s it&apos;s not the &quot;real thing.&quot;  Well, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;n.ot.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt;***This is an important point and when I&apos;m doing a piece in, let&apos;s<br/>&gt;say Sibelius that is for &quot;real&quot; instruments, it&apos;s a far different<br/>&gt;idea that using electronics as an *integral* part of a work.  In<br/>&gt;fact, I&apos;ve learned to intentionally *avoid* simulations of<br/>&gt;traditional instruments when I work that way, after encountering some<br/>&gt;criticism from some quarters.  Well, frankly I was not<br/>&gt;thinking &quot;clarinet&quot; (let&apos;s say) when I was using a MIDI sound of that<br/>&gt;nature, but was just using the sound the box made as *itself* but<br/>&gt;people tend to *hear* it as a poor emulation no matter what one<br/>&gt;does...</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2003 7:55:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4212">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/4212</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I suppose the solution is to &quot;process&quot; the sounds enough so that<br/>the ear can&apos;t immediately &quot;slot&quot; them into some familiar timbral<br/>category.
