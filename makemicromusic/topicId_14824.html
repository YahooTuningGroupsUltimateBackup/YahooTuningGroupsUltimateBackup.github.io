May I be so bold to ask, though I do<br/>&gt;  &apos;get&apos; your point, and it makes sense to me now, and I<br/>&gt;  agree it is unlikely to be satisfactory, how might<br/>&gt;  this be done in a Just scale also?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  You first need to decide which Just Intonation<br/>&gt;  intervals you wish to use. 3/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 7/4.<br/>&gt;  ......  etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Ask someone else about this, as they will know more<br/>&gt;  than I do about &quot;this week&apos;s JI flavour&quot; ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Your site, by the way, Lucy Tuning is fantastic, nice<br/>&gt;  work!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Thanks<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  best regards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Dan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Your question is paradoxical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Neither Just nor Pythagorean tuning will have a<br/>&gt;  CIRCLE of fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Pythagorean fifths result in a spiral, as do all<br/>&gt;  non-equal meantone-<br/>&gt;  type tunings e.g. LucyTuning. Phi, 1/4 comma etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Just intonation won&apos;t result in a circle; in fact<br/>&gt;  all that it results<br/>&gt;  (in my opinion) is postings on the tuning list about<br/>&gt;  how many angels<br/>&gt;  can dance on the head of a grasshopper;-) - but the<br/>&gt;  answer is always<br/>&gt;  in the form of integer:integer.  (whole number<br/>&gt;  ratios).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Unless you particularly enjoy playing numerology, I<br/>&gt;  suggest that you<br/>&gt;  avoid Just Intonation, as it doesn&apos;t even produce<br/>&gt;  interesting or<br/>&gt;  harmonious music from my experience and<br/>&gt;  experimentations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Circles of fifths and fourths only occur in some<br/>&gt;  equal temperaments<br/>&gt;  e.g. 12 edo; 19 edo; 31 edo; 53 edo etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  You could include other equal systems as being<br/>&gt;  circular, but that<br/>&gt;  creates the problem of defining what you consider to<br/>&gt;  be a fifth;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  As far as I can see, the problem that you are having<br/>&gt;  is in finding a<br/>&gt;  consistent connection between notenames and<br/>&gt;  frequencies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  The solution that I use is very simple:<br/>&gt;  multiple sharps and flats A to G derived from<br/>&gt;  A4=440Hz,<br/>&gt;  and the Large interval (i.e. between the fourth and<br/>&gt;  fifth) is:<br/>&gt;  the ratio of the two pi root of 2.<br/>&gt;  i.e. 2^(1/(2*pi))<br/>&gt;  or the radian angle in geometric terms = 360/2pi<br/>&gt;  degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Sorry to be evasive, yet I believe that you need to<br/>&gt;  re think and<br/>&gt;  restate your problem in order to be able to find a<br/>&gt;  solution<br/>&gt;  to getting your various instruments to play in tune<br/>&gt;  with eachother.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  Answer to your puzzle is easy for 12 edo, just<br/>&gt;  multiply the<br/>&gt;  reference frequency in Hz. by 2^(1/12) twelfth<br/>&gt;  root of 2 to give<br/>&gt;  all the other 11 frequency values.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  If you wish to really understand how tuning,<br/>&gt;  harmony etc. works in<br/>&gt;  the practical world of multiple microtuned<br/>&gt;  instruments playing<br/>&gt;  together, check out the <a href="http://lucytune.com">lucytune.com</a> site.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Using A4 = 440 Hz, as your reference pitch; all<br/>&gt;  the other LucyTuned<br/>&gt;  notes and instruments will play exactly in tune<br/>&gt;  with themselves and<br/>&gt;  eachother for as many notes per octave you choose<br/>&gt;  to use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Charles Lucy - lucy@... ------------<br/>&gt;  Promoting global<br/>&gt;  harmony through LucyTuning  ------- for<br/>&gt;  information on LucyTuning<br/>&gt;  go to:<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt;  for LucyTuned Lullabies, contest and Flash cartoon<br/>&gt;  go to<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>&gt;  Buy CD from:<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a><br/>&gt;  Lullabies at iTunes (if you already have iTunes<br/>&gt;  installed):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist">http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist</a>?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  a=5165209&amp;s=143441<br/>&gt;  To install iTunes go to:<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  All new Yahoo!
