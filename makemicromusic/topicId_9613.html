I used to use gigasampler le to play<br/>it on my old p.c. But it was rather limited in polyphony on my old 400 Mhz machine, only about<br/>two  note polyphony though it would be better with a better soundcard.</p><p>Gigasampler  won&apos;t run in XP though so for<br/>now I&apos;m using VSampler on my new laptop.<br/>It&apos;s 2.4 GHz, and even with a very lack-lustre standard<br/>sound card on the laptop it has plenty of processing<br/>power for quite a bit of polyphony. I plan to get<br/>an external soundcard. One of the ones I&apos;m looking at<br/>is the Tascam 122. That actually comes with GigaStudio LE<br/>bundled with the soundcard (though one reviewer found<br/>it only works with the soundcard, so perhaps the giga le uses the<br/>soundcard as a dongle) and it has had good reviews,<br/>and it also supports 24 bit recording.<br/>(FTS 3.0 supports reading and saving 24 bit and 32 bit audio files and I can probably<br/>get it to record them and play them back too if<br/>with a suitable soundcard to test it on - well<br/>24 bit anyway, maybe 32 bit is a bit specialised<br/>still).</p><p>Yes they record each note for a really long sample,<br/>and because each one is subtly different, in the<br/>way it sounds and the slight differences of performance,<br/>that really helps it to sound like the real thing<br/>and the vibrato is real and not mechanical like the<br/>kind of vibrato you get on a short looped wave sample.</p><p>I played it from a midi keyboard plugged into my laptop.<br/>Just got myself the 88 key M-audio keystation with half<br/>weighted keys which has better velocity control than<br/>the keyboards I used before for my improvisations.</p><p>So it just needed the Dan Dean solo strings CD, VSampler, FTS which I used to retune to the scale,<br/>and the keyboard and my laptop of course.</p><p>BTW FTS 3.0 is now getting good enough at recognising<br/>recorder tunes, so that I can play a tune and record<br/>it and then it can play it back on any other voice,<br/>e.g. this violin sound :-). It even gets the little<br/>grace notes in the scottish dance tunes I play.<br/>But it really brings out any flaws in my intonation<br/>to hear it played back on a violin and such a nice sounding one too :-).</p><p>The recorder is particularly easy for it. Also flute<br/>and such like instruments. It&apos;s also not doing too<br/>badly at other things - managed recordings of<br/>quite a variety of instruments from web pages the<br/>other day including some Vietnamese percussion ones<br/>I tried it on, though only for slower notes not as fast as the ones it can manage on the recorder.<br/>Ocarina is particularly easy for it.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
