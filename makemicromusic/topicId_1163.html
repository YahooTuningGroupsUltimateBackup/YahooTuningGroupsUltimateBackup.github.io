What happens when I try to download something from your website is<br/>&gt;that it begins downloading but the &quot;time remaining&quot; never decrements -<br/>&gt;- it keeps &quot;downloading&quot; forever.</p><p>Bummer... Im sorry about the bad downloads. Whats weird is that I can download<br/>them fine from either work or home. Could you do me a favor... Id like<br/>to try and figure out if its a problem with downloading all files, or<br/>just mp3 (ie. is it some kind of firewall-type problem that effects<br/>everything, or is it a format problem that only effects mp3s).</p><p>So, would you please try downloading one of the pdf&apos;s, for instance</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/alternatetunings/alltunings.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/alternatetunings/alltunings.pdf</a></p><p>(its a collection of (guitar) tunings I put together years ago)</p><p>Then try downloading one of the mp3&apos;s from</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html</a></p><p>And let me know what works and what doesnt...</p><p>Thanks... its useless to have music on the web if<br/>no one can download it!</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I downloaded one successfully, but just clicking on the above link started a download process and I dropped out when it appeared nothing was happening -- of course, when I check the directory I was that alltunings.pdf was a 2mB file.</p><p>&gt;Then try downloading one of the mp3&apos;s from<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html</a></p><p>Successfully got the Stein piece, which was cool since I had just finished a profile on her.
