It&apos;s<br/>pretty simple: you type in (for each note) what pitch you want it to play the sample at.<br/>The downside is that there is no obvious way to copy a full microtuning from one<br/>instrument to another. (The workaround is to build the instrument from a template<br/>that has the microtonal scale already built in.)</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
