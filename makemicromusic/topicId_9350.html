It should allow multiple parts. Preferably interval-<br/>based than scale-based. My music generally rise or fall in pitch, so<br/>the &quot;tonic&quot; isn&apos;t the same in the start and the end. I can of course<br/>solve this by doing a scale with many steps, but a program that focus<br/>on interval would be even better. If there is possibility to compose<br/>in a classic note system and then playback it, it would be great!</p><p>I downloaded Fractal Tunes, but found it very hard to use. Not<br/>because of the acoustics, which I&apos;m familiar to, but in which window<br/>things are. I&apos;m still trying to find the window where I can compose<br/>my own scale. The online help tells how to do it, but not where it is.</p><p>regards<br/>Johan Westman</p></div><h3><a id=9353 href="#9353">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2005 11:35:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>johanwestman2003 wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m looking for an easy program to compose midi files with<br/>&gt; microtonality.

There&apos;s a free tryout download -- look at the rules that come with the package for Barbershop and horns in JI; you can write similar rules for your own schemes.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=9354 href="#9354">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

It can re-tune each note up to 200 cents away from nominal<br/>12tet, so you can&apos;t have quite arbitrary tunings. And, setting up a<br/>different tuning can be *really* time consuming, and non-obvious, and<br/>painful. The only way to do it is with a series of pop-up panels for each<br/>note class; no easy file-based method of definition. Also, rules are set<br/>per score, and stored in rule files which you can read in. But once you<br/>have set  a composition to e.g., one kind of meantone, you can&apos;t reset it<br/>to some another tuning without a lot of work... it seems. (Someone with<br/>more experience than I might have a different opinion.)</p><p>(On the bright side, Harmony Assistant *can* distinguish between flats and<br/>sharps, and give you different pitches, so working with 17tet can be<br/>fairly easy. And the &quot;Virtual Singer&quot; can give you a fair idea of what your<br/>songs might sound like. I&apos;ve used Finale to export song sheets in<br/>Music-XML, then imported into Harmony Assistant, which can then &quot;sing&quot; the<br/>song. Much cheaper than Cantor, for example.)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
