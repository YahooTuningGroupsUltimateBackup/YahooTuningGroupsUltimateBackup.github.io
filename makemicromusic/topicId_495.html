Please dont lead people to believe that<br/>one scale fits all frogs... as you can hear in my piece<br/>&quot;Frog Planet&quot;, frogs from Sumatra (I was in a rice field<br/>somewhere outside Bukatingi) sound very different from<br/>other frogs, and hence the scale in which they sing most<br/>consonantly is also different.</p><p>You can find Frog Planet at:</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/Frog_Planet.mp3">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/Frog_Planet.mp3</a></p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
