None of these styles are &quot;easy,&quot; whatever that means; and blues least of all.

Don&apos;t know why you think it&apos;s easy, cause it&apos;s far far from that...best from sunny Denver...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microwstick.net">www.microwstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=27619 href="#27619">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2011 11:03:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>What I meant by that comment is that one can write passable blues without a<br/>great deal of difficulty. But to play the blues with the expressiveness of<br/>Buddy Guy - that is hard to do.</p><p>You seem to be arguing for the equivalency of all art.<br/> Equivalent as art I can agree - But few blues compositions could be seen as<br/>having the same degree of complexity as say The Rite of Spring.</p><p>My take on the blues, and I *have* listened to quite a bit since my wife<br/>loves the blues, is that it isn&apos;t what you play its how you play it. Around<br/>last Christmas time I dragged my family to a Taylor guitar clinic and there<br/>was an excellent guitarist (and his daughter singer - song writer and<br/>mandolin player) as the main event - besides the guitars themselves. And he<br/>spent a couple hours playing and explaining what he was playing and he<br/>played lick after lick - this is from Chet Atkins, this is from so and so,<br/>and so on he told us. What his particular signature was playing rapid<br/>harmonic arpeggios anywhere on the fret board with bar chords. Very pretty<br/>sound and difficult technique. Nonetheless it became clear that all of these<br/>famous people he was quoting, and he was an encyclopedia of these riffs,<br/>had developed some piece of the puzzle - &quot;their style&quot; and really great<br/>ones, like Les Paul I imagine, more than one. Its all fine and good but its<br/>not the same thing as what I learned in classical guitar.</p><p>Have you noticed just how many Beatles songs use a descending line as the<br/>basis of the composition? Especially later Beatles =&gt; Dear Prudence, Cry<br/>Baby Cry, While My Guitar Gently Weeps just off the top of my head from one<br/>album. If you look for them you will find a lot more.</p><p>Don&apos;t misunderstand me- I really really like the Beatles - but there is a<br/>qualitative difference between them  and say &quot;Reflets dans l&apos;eau&quot; by Claude<br/>Debussy - within which I hear lots of premonitions  of jazz.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9wqAzqKYyg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9wqAzqKYyg</a><br/>and a better player but noisier video<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLbpQl1cCl8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLbpQl1cCl8</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflets_dans_l%27eau">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflets_dans_l%27eau</a></p><p>Bands like Mahavishnu Orchestra - are awesome and can be tremendously<br/>complex <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQG7XpCiSVA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQG7XpCiSVA</a>   But still don&apos;t in my<br/>mind equate to The Rite of Spring or Shostakovich&apos;s 14 th symphony.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffafkWtFUcY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffafkWtFUcY</a></p><p>You probably don&apos;t know that I taught myself guitar - mostly learned on<br/>Beatles, Zeppelin and  Sabbath - and then somehow pulled off being a<br/>classical guitar major at a college level without previous classical lessons<br/>(and only 1 rock guitar lesson). So I stand in both worlds. There is no lack<br/>of respect on my part. However, I see a qualitative difference between the<br/>vast majority of &quot;popular&quot; music and &quot;serious&quot; music.  Not even John<br/>McLaughlin can best Andr&#xFFFD;s Segovia in my mind. But perhaps I have to declare<br/>my bias on the basis of his recording of Bach&apos;s Chaconne in D<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNXlslzL8EY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNXlslzL8EY</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRhorozjEEg&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRhorozjEEg&feature=related</a></p><p>But the thing is - no one needs to have a problem with the division. As my<br/>wife says - sometimes its nice just to have a fun song. And I agree. And in<br/>my house we play music together - folk and pop songs. So a song has just<br/>two  chords - so what? If its what you want to do - fantastic.  But I&apos;m not<br/>going to call it equivalent to Beethoven.</p><p>I hope you don&apos;t take offense to this. I think we might have differing<br/>views.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Thu, Apr 7, 2011 at 12:58 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:microstick@msn.com">microstick@msn.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey Chris...sensa humor here...just saw your line that &quot;blues is not the<br/>&gt; most difficult genre around...&quot; Wow...astonishing indeed.

BTW, Tower of Power (the band) is awesome...<br/>   So what are the difference between the blues sub-genres...and what makes each one difficult to play?  The one thing I know...is quarter-tone bends and soaring vocals play a role in a lot of blues and getting either of those to sound as clean and soulful a sound as the &quot;masters of blues&quot; is not easy.</p></div><h3><a id=27631 href="#27631">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2011 7:16:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Apr 7, 2011 at 12:58 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey Chris...sensa humor here...just saw your line that &quot;blues is not the most difficult genre around...&quot; Wow...astonishing indeed.
