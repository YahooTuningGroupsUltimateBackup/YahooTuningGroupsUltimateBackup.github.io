The irony of course is that there is no more cliched and<br/>homogeneous sounding way of writing than typical 12-tone academic<br/>serialism. He clearly was thinking along the lines of the 12-eq<br/>semitone or whole tone being divided: 18- 24- and 36-, etc.</p><p>I like your last statement in commentary:<br/>&quot;If the cultural acceptance of greater numbers of pitches depends upon<br/>historical necessity, then microtonality is an idea whose time has<br/>clearly arrived.&quot;</p><p>BTW, Chris and I appreciate you coming up from Charleston to see the<br/>show! More later when I&apos;m not so exhausted!....</p><p>-A.</p></div>
