It would be churlish and desultory, and what better reason to stay up until 4:30 in the morning?</p><p>(not to mention that I spent the earlier part of the evening accompanying Marvin Hamlisch. I keep wondering: what did I do in a previous life to deserve *this*?)</p><p>OK, so we have just a couple minutes of cruft entitled &quot;Do Something&quot;. I figured I&apos;d stick to that theme. A few musical and aural clues in there as well. When I&apos;ve had the rare time to sit down and play, I&apos;ve been living inside of one of Al-Farabi&apos;s scales, the Greek genus chromaticum forte. But I decided to fill out 12 notes, and utilized Kyle Gann&apos;s chart to find likely candidates for an interesting - and decidedly non-ET - grouping of pitches.</p><p>(Pleasepleaseplease don&apos;t tell Carl you are taking these files ahead of time)</p><p>You can find the ditty at:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music/Do_Something.mp3">http://www.microtonal.org/music/Do_Something.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music/Do_Something.ogg">http://www.microtonal.org/music/Do_Something.ogg</a></p><p>(Carl will know that there is a file there with the appropriate flac extension)</p><p>Thanks to Jacob for sticking his neck on this one, Carl for compendiumization, and Prent for his ever-present podcastedness. At first I was ranting internally about having to mix with headphones (so excuse the mix already), but then I thought &quot;hell, maybe a bunch of people will be *listening* on phones!&quot;. I&apos;m going to load it onto my player as well.</p><p>Enough. I need sleep.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
