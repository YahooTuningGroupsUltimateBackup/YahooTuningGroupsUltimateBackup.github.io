At the time my only instrument was a conventionally fretted 6 string bass guitar, so I thought up a slightly awkward &apos;double chromatic&apos; tuning that allowed me to play the quartertone scale and a few simple Just Intonation scales. Some of you have seen my &apos;bichromatic tuning&apos; thread on the Not Only Music forum.</p><p>Recently I improved the tuning to &apos;double chromatic thirds&apos; and have been surprised by how usable the tuning is. When the intervals between the strings are all adjusted to neutral thirds of 3.5 semitones the quartertone scale can be played, also the fretboard becomes isomorphic: the shapes of scales, chords, melodies, intervals etc. are the same at any point on the fretboard.</p><p>The modification is cheap and reversible, only requiring a custom set of single strings. This is &apos;stealth microtonality&apos;, no-one would know by looking at your guitar it is microtonal.</p><p>Download the pdf document here ...<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/mat_cooper/Neutral%20thirds%20tuning%20for%20quartertones%20on%20conventionally%20fretted%20guitar.pdf">http://micro.soonlabel.com/mat_cooper/Neutral%20thirds%20tuning%20for%20quartertones%20on%20conventionally%20fretted%20guitar.pdf</a></p><p>Thanks to Chris for hosting it ;)</p><p>MatC</p></div><h3><a id=27694 href="#27694">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2011 10:01:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Double chromatic thirds JI ...</p><p>Retuning every other string up or down by 35 cents creates alternating JI major third and JI minor third intervals between the strings.

The relative tuning of the 2 chains can be easily adjusted to any value by micro-retuning 1 group of strings. So it&apos;s possible to play a 10 tone JI tonal lattice constructed from fifths and 1 other freely chosen interval. I was playing the JI septimal subminor and supermajor scales recently on my 6 string bass.</p><p>MatC</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So it&apos;s like two chains of 12-tet that are<br/>&gt; offset by a just 5/4.</p></div><h3><a id=27787 href="#27787">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2011 7:32:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ixlramp&quot; &lt;ixlramp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Download the pdf document here ...</p><p>The 24EDO pdf is now out of date, the revised guide can be found in this thread at muzicforums ...</p><p><a href="http://www.muzicforums.com/music-theory/53860-neutral-thirds-tuning-quartertones-conventionally-fretted-guitar.html">http://www.muzicforums.com/music-theory/53860-neutral-thirds-tuning-quartertones-conventionally-fretted-guitar.html</a></p><p>MatC</p></div><h3><a id=27796 href="#27796">ðŸ”—</a>Caleb Morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2011 10:42:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just saw this post by Mike B., and was struck by how clear his explanation is.<br/> I&apos;m not trying to make work for you, but you&apos;re good at putting things simply,<br/>in a way I can understand.</p><p>-c</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Mon, April 25, 2011 9:49:46 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Re: How to retune a conventionally fretted guitar to play<br/>24EDO (pdf document)</p><p>Thanks for all the info Mat, I&apos;ll check this out.
