In the first half the adding part to the steady part duration ratio is 1200/34, in the second half the steady to the subtracting are in golden ratio.</p><p>All tones have the same amplitude and constant frequency. Frequencies are equally distributed on log. scale - 1234 notes in 8 octaves.</p><p>The piece is a result of my experiments with mixing sine waves to obtain the noise. If you mix many sine waves with frequencies equally distributed on linear scale, the result should be similar to the white noise. If you mix many sine waves with frequencies equally distributed on logarithmic scale, the result should be similar to the pink noise. And since obtaining the pink noise is not an easy task, I performed this experiment but forgot to randomize the phases of generators. The result was a gliding tone slowly dissolving in the noise. I am curious in mathematical description of it.</p><p>For the simplicity (I was lazy to clean up the code) the halves of the piece were generated separately, both from the middle (all generators in-phase) to the ends. First part was then reversed (in time) and inverted (in amplitude) and spliced with the second part.
