They say that &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot; and &quot;Where<br/>  the Bee Sucks&quot; are &quot;cover songs&quot; and under Harry Fox copyright.</p><p>  I just explained to them that these are totally *original* songs, and<br/>  the reason the titles have been used by other people is that<br/>  the &quot;lyrics&quot; are by Shakespeare!</p><p>  Ah... <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>...</p><p>  I&apos;ve indicated a willingness to change the *titles* of these original<br/>  pieces... so we&apos;ll see where it goes from there.</p><p>  I thought that was pretty funny, anyway.</p><p>  Please keep in mind that most of this is &quot;background&quot; for the play...<br/>  not a major artistic effort... but some may enjoy it anyway...</p><p>  It&apos;s all in meantone...</p><p>  best,</p><p>  __________ _______ ________<br/>  Joseph Pehrson</p><p>        Yahoo!
