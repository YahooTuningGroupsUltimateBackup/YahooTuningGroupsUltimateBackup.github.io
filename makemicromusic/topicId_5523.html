Wherever I compose, I try to run away from notation. I use bar view, for me that is more like wysiwyg, I have trouble trying to think in notes.</p><p>What you describe as working way is pretty much the thing I do in Cakewalk. Yes, it&apos;s very detailed and time-consuming. Anyway, for me it&apos;s the only way I do know at present time to ~directly~ enter pitch values, so that one second later I can hear them...</p><p>Does Finale have a bar view? Maybe I should confront myself doing it the &quot;tone height to midipitchbendnote to sequencernote and back&quot;-way to train my mind, but somehow I fear, the flow gets lost. What you told about Carlos Family tunings makes me curious - can you recommend a good web-source related to his work? Do you work with them?</p><p>By the way, is there something like a commission for tunings standards in electronic instruments, to make sure something like midimessages for changing tuning tables, and the tuningtables itself, can become a midi-standard in some future years? I guess that&apos;s in the hand of the Midi-standard people itself, but I also think there would be enough participants to form a club of easy message handling for all systems (forgetting the fact that there may be things the major hardware producers do not want to be a more universally usable standard).</p><p>All the best,<br/>Clemens</p><p>  If you want to hack notation, you could do that with Coda&apos;s &quot;Finale&quot;.<br/>  Finale supports sending of very specific pitch-bend messages based on<br/>  articulations applied to the written notes. But it would be time-consuming<br/>  to actually do such things for anything large scale. You have to make up<br/>  the articulations and the particular messages, then apply them to the notes<br/>  you want. A very detailed process, but one which would work with any synth<br/>  that supports standard pitch-bend.</p><p>  &gt; Considering all the people busy with microtonal music, why did noone<br/>  &gt; invent such a thing? Do you think it is useful at all?</p><p>  For my purposes, it doesn&apos;t seem very useful unless it&apos;s really<br/>  well-integrated with the notation package.Finale can do it, yeah, but it&apos;s<br/>  not easy enough to do, nor well-integrated enough. You can&apos;t just define a<br/>  set of frequencies easily in the score, and a set of notations to go with<br/>  them, and have it play the right frequencies at the right time. It&apos;s much<br/>  more complicated than that.</p><p>  &gt; Or are you happy and satisfied working with the tuning tables of your<br/>  &gt; instruments (assuming we talk about midified instruments)?</p><p>  Pretty happy with them, yes. (Speaking of Rhino, VAZ, and Midicode.) I<br/>  would like the ability to easily change tuning tables on-the-fly by using<br/>  MIDI messages. That would be particularly useful with &quot;family&quot; tunings,<br/>  such as Carlos&apos; Harmonic scale where you may want to modulate between<br/>  related scales.</p><p>        Rick</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
