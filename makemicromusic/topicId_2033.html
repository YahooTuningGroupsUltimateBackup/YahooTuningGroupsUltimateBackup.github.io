Remo makes some good Fiber-Skin 3 &gt;drums that stay in tune even in the most humid conditions.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind a percussionists advice, here goes: if you want to stick with synthetic heads, do it mainly on drums that have small heads and high pitches. Some of the heads they are making for congas these days come close. But a djembe really does, at this point, beg for a true skin. Find someone in your area that can pick out a good drum. The djembes I&apos;ve played on with Fibreskin or Mondo heads have a very, very artificial high end, and they are &apos;hard&apos; feeling to play on. No give under the hand, and very little variety in timbre/pitch in the spectrum, very different in this regard from a good natural djembe.</p><p>This is one instrument where putting up with some of the inconsistencies yields far more in musicality in the long run. I&apos;m no djembe master, but I&apos;ve worked with two of them, pretty world-class, and this is what they&apos;ve shared with me.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
