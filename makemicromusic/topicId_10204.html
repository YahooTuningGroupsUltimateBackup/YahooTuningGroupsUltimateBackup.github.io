Since I&apos;d memorized the<br/>Bach Well-Tempered Clavier Prelude #1 in C (arpeggiated chords on the &quot;Ave Maria&quot;<br/>changes) on the standard keyboard, I tried it on Hackleman&apos;s instrument. To my own<br/>surprise, I played it through with remarkably few mistakes on my first try.</p><p>But for anyone with free bass accordion technique, perhaps it&apos;s worth investigating the<br/>new Roland synthetic accordion, or perhaps retuning an existing instrument, since the<br/>rows of back buttons on this instrument are offset in a way conducive to a generalized<br/>keyboard treatment.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I think Harold design is well done and i have found that it took me no<br/>&gt; time at all to play on a bosanquet. like minutes<br/>&gt;  on a regular keyboard with a different tuning i find i have to think<br/>&gt; even more and having both 22 and at one time a 31 tone scale laid out in<br/>&gt; this fashion was just almost impossible to really to do much<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;[much clipped]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Harold,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Thank you for the information.
