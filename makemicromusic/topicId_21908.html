It seems to me that the &quot;Wild Thing&quot; of their scale could be Smoke On The Water by Deep Purple or a tune by 808 State that goes G G F# Eb C, since you can play both riffs with the 1st 5 notes of their 12 note scale. The complete infinite scale has all the natural harmonics. It just happens to have lots of other notes added in between. You could find all the notes for the chords of Wild Thing in just intonation in their scale. The last note you need would be shortly after the 35 trillionth note in their scale. More reallisticly, the third octave of their scale has more notes in than most people need.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This is neat: <a href="http://www.applesinstereo.com/pythagorean.php">http://www.applesinstereo.com/pythagorean.php</a></p></div>
