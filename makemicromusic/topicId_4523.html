You have good reasoning.  My limit seems to be two products &gt; that work together out of the box.  I am considering sibelius or &gt; finale for music notation (replacing allegro 2001).  I think my &gt; Yamaha PSR-340 will need to be replaced too.  Any suggestions for &gt; either choice?<br/>&gt; &gt; Best Wishes,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Jim</p><p>I use Finale and it&apos;s pretty darn good. It&apos;s more widely supported than Sibelius and has basically the same main features.<br/>I have a small Roland keyboard controller connected to MIDI port...<br/>And for synthesis itself, you could go with Rhino... ;-)</p><p>But you need a sound card with little latency, etc.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
