See:</p><p><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; To produce pro music, hardware required is a Mac G5 +  good six or &gt;&gt; more<br/>&gt;&gt; channel sound card or similar + a midi in through a decent keyboard +<br/>&gt;&gt; useful item is a six or more channel mixer + microphones and electric<br/>&gt;&gt; and acoustic instruments + build/collect yourself a good sample<br/>&gt;&gt; library.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I hope this is helpful.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It will even (horrors of horrors) microtune JI (if that&apos;s your bag) &gt;&gt; -;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;-) I saw a drama about longitude Harrison. It was very interesting!</p><p>It was probably the Granada film called &quot;Longitude&quot; from the Dava Sobel book, directed by Charles Sturridge of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; fame, with Jeremy Irons, and Michael Gambon playing Harrison<br/>I worked on that production here in Ham, near London and with one of the Oxford University choirs in 1999.<br/>The action jumps between Harrison&apos;s era (1700&apos;s) and the 1920/30&apos;s, as his clocks are restored.<br/>(I took more money in lieu of credits;-)<br/>The result was a very good film biography of Harrison, which showed the scientific politics and intrigues of 18th and 20th century Britain in an interesting form.<br/>Twenty-first century Britain still has many similarities;-)<br/>It is now available on DVD from the public libraries here in UK, so prolly also elsewhere too, well worth watching if you are interested in scientific, naval, and political history, or like a good historical drama.<br/>More info on it is at:</p><p><a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/lsd/granada.html">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/lsd/granada.html</a></p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div>
