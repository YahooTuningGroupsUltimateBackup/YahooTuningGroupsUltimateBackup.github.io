Thank you very much for taking the time and making the effort to review my email and respond.  Your comments are very helpful.</p><p>  If I may, I will elaborate further.  There is a scale called &apos;Primasounds&apos;, that apparently has extremely unusual characteristics. There scale is proprietary, which is fine.  I do not need to nor wish, to &apos;crack&apos; their secret scale.  However, the anomalous effect they claim their scale to have, this I would like to replicate.  My understanding is that, this should be doable using a scale of similiar properties and principals.  The trick however is discovering and understanding this enough to replicate the effect.  Your knowledge of music and tuning exceeds mine. Thankfully.  Below are some snippets realtive to understanding more about this scale and also some links that contain relevant specific info on all this.  I would very much love to hear your thoughts on all this and any additional comments and insights.</p><p>  I would speculate, that we would know we are on the right track with a tuning (scale) were the same phenomenal characteristics (described below) present.</p><p>  Best Regards</p><p>  D</p><p>  Chapter 14: The Physics of PrimaSounds?<br/>By R.C.L.</p><p>&quot; It appears as if PrimaSounds produce standing waves - a wall of sound effect - that is not tied to the acoustics of the room itself. Instead, it appears to have more to do with the people in the room and their energy fields.&quot;</p><p>  The evidence which initially led to this circular or vortex sound wave theory was the discovery that an unusual number of &quot;standing waves&quot; are always created in any room when PrimaSounds is played. This unusual acoustic phenomenon was noticed right away by the Keyserlings when the music was first performed in 1971. It sounds as if all of the PrimaSound tones are standing waves. This phenomenon in turn suggested circular waves.<br/>  For normal longitudinal sound waves, this kind of multiple standing wave phenomenon would not be possible, or at least very rare and uncommon. A standing wave is one which remains in place, with clear position and form. A few, and only a few, standing waves are always created with longitudinal waves in any enclosed room. Which particular frequencies of longitudinal sound will become standing waves is based on the size of the room, and the interaction of the sound waves. Specifically it is based on the distance between the walls, and the phase effects, or interactions, between the waves. For example, if the room is fifteen feet long, then the sound wave which has a frequency that makes it fifteen feet long will be reinforced by the room itself. The sound wave ends at the wall and bounces back to the other wall, touching the wall just when it is reversing direction. Waves the size of one-half the room size, one-fourth, one-eighth, etc., will do the same. The waves as they<br/> pass back going the opposite direction to the originating source cancel it out, or reinforce it according the resonance. This is known as a phase effect, and it can create a standing wave.<br/>  You can walk around a room and hear where the standing waves are resounding. They have a definite location, and since they are reinforced by the structure of the room itself, they play or resound longer. These are natural, acoustically produced standing waves. They cannot exist outdoors, barring only natural caverns or mountain wall echo effects, where the waves can reverse direction.</p><p>  This is difficult to understand in the abstract, but starts to make sense when you visualize what is happening. Again, we are indebted to Professor Russel. See his animated gif below and also his web page on Superposition of Waves for a further, and better explanation.</p><p>  Many investigators have reported that when PrimaSounds are played, many more standing waves can be heard in a room than when other sound frequencies are played. (Moreover some report hearing standing waves outside, but this is more problematical due to the interference of many other factors, such as wind, other sounds, etc. and is more difficult to detect.) It appears as if PrimaSounds produce standing waves - a wall of sound effect - that is not tied to the acoustics of the room itself. Instead, it appears to have more to do with the people in the room and their energy fields. The standing waves are not acoustically produced by reflection from the walls and phasing. They are produced by interaction with the life form energy fields in the room - the chakras. Thus with enough people in a room, all of the PrimaSound tones become standing waves, moving in various rotational patterns.<br/>  The rotational wave phenomenon allows us to understand this. If the sound waves become circular by interaction with the energy fields of the observers, they would naturally create more standing waves. In fact, the inherent nature of circular waves would be static, just like standing waves caused by interaction with the walls. Again the example of the ducks on water show this. The ducks are not pushed along following the movement of the wave on the water. They basically remain in one position traveling in a circular motion. First they go up and forward, then down and back. The ducks are like a PrimaSounds wave when in contact with chakra energy. They become circular standing waves.</p><p>  <a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch14.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch14.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch13.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch13.html</a></p><p>  index: <a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/index.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/index.html</a></p><p>  intro: <a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch0.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch0.html</a><br/>  Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>On Fri, 19 Aug 2006 <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Posted by: &quot;dar kone&quot; zarkorgon@... zarkorgon<br/>&gt; Date: Thu Aug 17, 2006 9:09 pm (PDT)</p><p>&gt; This gave me a listing of the ratios (fractions) for the complete musical scale.<br/>&gt; HOWEVER,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to do the same thing for a completely different type of scale, an unsual one;<br/>&gt; (what are the commands to use?

Thank you very much for taking the time and making the effort to review my email and respond. Your comments are very helpful.</p><p>If I may, I will elaborate further. There is a scale called &apos;Primasounds&apos;, that apparently has extremely unusual characteristics. There scale is proprietary, which is fine. I do not need to nor wish, to &apos;crack&apos; their secret scale. However, the anomalous effect they claim their scale to have, this I would like to replicate. My understanding is that, this should be doable using a scale of similiar properties and principals. The trick however is discovering and understanding this enough to replicate the effect. Your knowledge of music and tuning exceeds mine. Thankfully. Below are some snippets realtive to understanding more about this scale and also some links that contain relevant specific info on all this. I would very much love to hear your thoughts on all this and any additional comments and insights.</p><p>I would speculate, that we would know we are on the right track with a tuning (scale) were the same phenomenal characteristics (described below) present.</p><p>Best Regards</p><p>D</p><p>Chapter 14: The Physics of PrimaSounds?<br/>By R.C.L.</p><p>&quot; It appears as if PrimaSounds produce standing waves - a wall of sound effect - that is not tied to the acoustics of the room itself. Instead, it appears to have more to do with the people in the room and their energy fields.&quot;</p><p>The evidence which initially led to this circular or vortex sound wave theory was the discovery that an unusual number of &quot;standing waves&quot; are always created in any room when PrimaSounds is played. This unusual acoustic phenomenon was noticed right away by the Keyserlings when the music was first performed in 1971. It sounds as if all of the PrimaSound tones are standing waves. This phenomenon in turn suggested circular waves.<br/>For normal longitudinal sound waves, this kind of multiple standing wave phenomenon would not be possible, or at least very rare and uncommon. A standing wave is one which remains in place, with clear position and form. A few, and only a few, standing waves are always created with longitudinal waves in any enclosed room. Which particular frequencies of longitudinal sound will become standing waves is based on the size of the room, and the interaction of the sound waves. Specifically it is based on the distance between the walls, and the phase effects, or interactions, between the waves. For example, if the room is fifteen feet long, then the sound wave which has a frequency that makes it fifteen feet long will be reinforced by the room itself. The sound wave ends at the wall and bounces back to the other wall, touching the wall just when it is reversing direction. Waves the size of one-half the room size, one-fourth, one-eighth, etc., will do the same. The waves as they<br/>pass back going the opposite direction to the originating source cancel it out, or reinforce it according the resonance. This is known as a phase effect, and it can create a standing wave.<br/>You can walk around a room and hear where the standing waves are resounding. They have a definite location, and since they are reinforced by the structure of the room itself, they play or resound longer. These are natural, acoustically produced standing waves. They cannot exist outdoors, barring only natural caverns or mountain wall echo effects, where the waves can reverse direction.</p><p>This is difficult to understand in the abstract, but starts to make sense when you visualize what is happening. Again, we are indebted to Professor Russel. See his animated gif below and also his web page on Superposition of Waves for a further, and better explanation.</p><p>Many investigators have reported that when PrimaSounds are played, many more standing waves can be heard in a room than when other sound frequencies are played. (Moreover some report hearing standing waves outside, but this is more problematical due to the interference of many other factors, such as wind, other sounds, etc. and is more difficult to detect.) It appears as if PrimaSounds produce standing waves - a wall of sound effect - that is not tied to the acoustics of the room itself. Instead, it appears to have more to do with the people in the room and their energy fields. The standing waves are not acoustically produced by reflection from the walls and phasing. They are produced by interaction with the life form energy fields in the room - the chakras. Thus with enough people in a room, all of the PrimaSound tones become standing waves, moving in various rotational patterns.<br/>The rotational wave phenomenon allows us to understand this. If the sound waves become circular by interaction with the energy fields of the observers, they would naturally create more standing waves. In fact, the inherent nature of circular waves would be static, just like standing waves caused by interaction with the walls. Again the example of the ducks on water show this. The ducks are not pushed along following the movement of the wave on the water. They basically remain in one position traveling in a circular motion. First they go up and forward, then down and back. The ducks are like a PrimaSounds wave when in contact with chakra energy. They become circular standing waves.</p><p><a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch14.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch14.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch13.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch13.html</a></p><p>index: <a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/index.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/index.html</a></p><p>intro: <a href="http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch0.html">http://www.primasounds.com/PrimaSounds/ch0.html</a><br/>Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>On Fri, 19 Aug 2006 <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Posted by: &quot;dar kone&quot; zarkorgon@... zarkorgon<br/>&gt; Date: Thu Aug 17, 2006 9:09 pm (PDT)</p><p>&gt; This gave me a listing of the ratios (fractions) for the complete musical scale.<br/>&gt; HOWEVER,<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to do the same thing for a completely different type of scale, an unsual one;<br/>&gt; (what are the commands to use?

In conventional 16th-century<br/>European counterpoint, for example, 7:4 tends to present as rather<br/>dissonant, like any minor seventh. However, in a 14th-century or<br/>20th-century style it could be quite suave, and in some current styles it<br/>can even serve as a stable concord.</p><p>Unfortunately, I&apos;m not sure just what kind of scale you are striving for,<br/>although one possibility is this just tuning, which in Scala format might<br/>be listed:</p><p>7/6<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>7/4<br/>2/1</p><p>This just scale has five notes per octave, and in fact is a kind of<br/>slendro pentatonic used by Lou Harrison and others. It could also be<br/>expressed as a ratio 12:14:16:18:21:24.</p><p>&gt; The ratio of these numbers is the division of seven, an interval<br/>&gt; between the overtones not used in other harmonic structures. 7/7, 7/6,<br/>&gt; 7/5, 7/4, 7/3, 7/2, 7/1. Out of this structure of fundamental tones,<br/>&gt; emerges five intervals. By doubling the five-tone scale we attain the<br/>&gt; oldest existing scale tenfold scale, called the Slendro scale, much<br/>&gt; older then the Pythagorean sevenfold octave.</p><p>Maybe I should explain that a slendro scale generally has five notes per<br/>octave, which are often not too far from an equal fivefold division of the<br/>octave where each step would be 240 cents, but somewhat unequal. Since<br/>each traditional gamelan ensemble has its own unique intonation, we can<br/>only list some typical patterns, included for example in the Scala scale<br/>archive.</p><p>&gt; The one seventh interval is different from the major second of 1/9 and<br/>&gt; 1/10. When used, however, this 1/7th interval will divide the octave<br/>&gt; into five parts.</p><p>Actually, if I understand this, you are referring to an 8:7 major second,<br/>about 231 cents, a bit smaller than precisely 1/5 octave (240 cents).</p><p>You also refer to a tuning using roots of five.
