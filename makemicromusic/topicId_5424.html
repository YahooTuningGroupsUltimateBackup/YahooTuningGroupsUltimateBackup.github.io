You&apos;ve prefaced your entry to the group by explaining you have no musical training, so I&apos;m hesitant to try to give much in the way of direction, as I am imagining a lot would be over your head.</p><p>However, when one programs tones like these in what ends up being a fairly random (or completely random) manner, it doesn&apos;t take very long for the listener to think &quot;there is nothing coming up I&apos;m interested in listening to&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ve never taken a poll, but I also think that people that would like to just sit and listen to a tuning, and its various combinations, are in a distinct minority compared to people who would like to listen to a tuning in a musical context. Me, for instance.</p><p>One thing I might suggest would be to use the freeware program Scala to experiment with 53 (or other tunings) - you can play the scales and intervals, and try out chords as well. The other thing that might really be fun for you would be to work with Robert Walker&apos;s Fractal Tune Smithy, where you can set a tuning and then use varying parameters to generate &apos;fractal&apos; music. The bonus is that the program is the development of a person who is not only and scientist and programmer, but also a musician, and while it is algorhythmic in nature it *does* generate material that is much more musical than pure random settings.</p><p>Both Scala and FTS work hand in hand together, and may open up many other tuning &apos;doors&apos; to you. Links (I believe they are still current) can be found at:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/resources.html">http://www.microtonal.org/resources.html</a></p><p>&gt;One thing that I would really love is to find out about other work that is &gt;headed in a similar direction.</p><p>Did you check out a posting about a piece in 19tet that came up about a week or so ago, &quot;the Juggler&quot;?:</p><p><a href="http://www.aaronandlorna.com/audio/juggler.mp3">http://www.aaronandlorna.com/audio/juggler.mp3</a></p><p>While you are at it, check out a couple of other xentonal works on the same site from this page:<br/><a href="http://www.aaronandlorna.com/aaron_works.html">http://www.aaronandlorna.com/aaron_works.html</a></p><p>Gene Smith has a whole bunch of stuff at his site:<br/><a href="http://www.xenharmony.org/">http://www.xenharmony.org/</a></p><p>...but he doesn&apos;t show how large the files are, and some are quite large. Also, maybe Joe Pehrson can chime in with a link to his files.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve heard Easley Blackwood&apos;s music in 13 through 24 note equal temperament.</p><p>Sorry, not a fan. In fact, I&apos;m not really an ET kind of person, but others around here are.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m trying to do something similar, except of course this is algorithmic &gt;music where his is composed.</p><p>Bear in mind that even algorithmic compositions vary from total randomness to controlled freedom; you&apos;ll probably find that for many listeners - and probably yourself, after time - you tire of complete randomness. There is a lot of literature, and a fair amount of widgets, available for algo comp stuff. I&apos;m not the most up-to-date on it, but slowly there is a synergy towards (at least on a computer platform) getting all this to work together.</p><p>&gt;And the 53 note scale hits the basic conventional ratios 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, &gt;5/3, etc very nicely, so the starting point is far less strange.</p><p>Oh, Jim, you&apos;re not going to tell me you&apos;re afraid of &quot;strange&quot; things, are you?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5434 href="#5434">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2003 3:01:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

You&apos;re right that almost all<br/>in-depth commentary would be over my head! I&apos;ve looked at a few music<br/>theory books, and understand essentially zero!</p><p>Randomness versus structure is a curious business. I was rather<br/>worried that the piece ends up with too MUCH structure! The way I<br/>generate the tones is to set up a lattice - in this case I think it&apos;s<br/>a four dimensional torus. The sequence of sounds played is then<br/>generated by a sort of helical walk that covers the torus. At each<br/>point on the toroidal mesh is a sound. There&apos;s a cost function that<br/>wants the sound at a point to be harmonically close to the sounds at<br/>the neighboring points, of which there are eight on the four<br/>dimensional torus. I simulate a Bolzmann distribution on this system,<br/>starting at a high temperature and gradually reducing the temperature.<br/>This sort of system is pretty much guaranteed to have a second order<br/>phase transition at some temperature. Right at that temperature the<br/>fluctuations will have a fractal character. I didn&apos;t implement any<br/>fancy  mechanisms to detect the right temperature. But if the<br/>temperature goes any lower, the crystal freezes, i.e. the sound<br/>becomes just a steady unvarying single sound. So I just listen in at<br/>various temperatures, and just at the border between under-correlation<br/>and over-correlation, that&apos;s where I stop. But that&apos;s my ear judging<br/>the boundary - not a terribly reliable judge!</p><p>I&apos;m imposing structure in several ways: I define the shape of the<br/>torus and the path of the walk that generates the sound sequence; I<br/>define the harmonic cost function; and I pick the sequence of<br/>temperatures through which the system evolves. It&apos;s funny. When I<br/>listen to the piece, all this structure is very apparent to me. I<br/>rather worry that so much structure will be too boring. Yet here you<br/>are, telling me - if I am getting the message straight - that for all<br/>you can tell, the sound sequence sounds pretty much purely random!<br/>That&apos;s a big surprise for me! For me, such a suprise is the mark of a<br/>successful experiment. It means I can learn something! So thanks for<br/>the education!</p><p>Here&apos;s one feature of this piece: if you repeat it, the last note<br/>leads right back to the first. The piece is a loop. There is really no<br/>variation at all that I imposed, i.e. the space is totally<br/>homogeneous. I can imagine that the piece really needs a story line to<br/>create a focus of interest. Most music sort of builds up some tension<br/>and then resolves it, i.e. has a beginning and an end. My piece, being<br/>homogeneous and circular, has no beginning or end.</p><p>One way I could create a story line in the context of my current<br/>approach would be to vary the cost function from point to point in the<br/>mesh. From a software perspective it&apos;s easy to do in whatever<br/>arbitrary way. The challenge is to do it in a way that makes sense<br/>musically! No doubt all those books that I don&apos;t understand would give<br/>me some clues! On the other hand, they probably leave out the Bolzmann<br/>distributions!  Well, I hope all of my explanation here in<br/>physics/computer terms was not so un-musical to be overly bothersome!</p><p>Thanks again,<br/>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=5436 href="#5436">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

You&apos;re right that almost all &gt;in-depth commentary would be over my head! I&apos;ve looked at a few music &gt;theory books, and understand essentially zero!</p><p>OK. And to make you feel fairly dang comfortable, if we were to switch places and you put math books in front of me, the effect would be quite similar (though I made it as far as first year calculus, so I guess that&apos;s more than your music education.</p><p>&gt;Randomness versus structure is a curious business. I was rather worried &gt;that the piece ends up with too MUCH structure! The way I generate the &gt;tones is to set up a lattice ...</p><p>And at this point I&apos;m going to skip most of your description. I should try to go back and listen, which maybe I&apos;ll do as background to other tasks this evening, but even without that, what does it say (again) to you that I thought it was at least somewhat random?</p><p>For many musicians, one of the failings of contemporary classical music of the avant-garde variety (which really flourished from the late 40&apos;s and has only lost some of it&apos;s grip as a progressive voice in the last couple of decades) is primarily that: all of the structures that were being place on music, in an effort to &apos;liberate&apos; it&apos;s emphasis on tonality and common rhythmic structures, fail to yield any aurally detectable results; they can only be discerned upon analyzing the score.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the forum to debate it, but it is entirely up to you whether you want the structure you have imposed on your creation to be heard.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s funny. When I listen to the piece, all this structure is very &gt;apparent to me.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it is funny, I think it is pretty remarkable. Have you, by any chance, taken a random sampling of friends (your enemies wouldn&apos;t listen to this willingly, would they? :) who *aren&apos;t* in your field of expertise and had them listen, and found that the majority could *hear* the structure? I have my doubts.</p><p>&gt;I rather worry that so much structure will be too boring. Yet here you &gt;are, telling me - if I am getting the message straight - that for all you &gt;can tell, the sound sequence sounds pretty much purely random!</p><p>I don&apos;t know, Jim, what can we infer? I&apos;ve been actively playing, composing, and listening to music for 40 of my 50 years - I simply think this means that musical structures and mathematical/physical structures are not completely analogous.</p><p>&gt;It means I can learn something! So thanks for the education!</p><p>I love it when my completely missing something helps others... :)</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s one feature of this piece: if you repeat it, the last note leads &gt;right back to the first. The piece is a loop.</p><p>OK, I gotta stop you: if you assume that after eleven minutes no one is going to immediately start the piece over again, and taking into account a complete lack of timbral variation, no purposeful dynamic (loudness) variation, and what &apos;appears&apos; to be a fairly random rhythmic structure - did you think I could notice that it ended on the same one of 53 discrete pitches that it started on? Not this puppy!</p><p>&gt;My piece, being homogeneous and circular, has no beginning or end.</p><p>I should note that I very much like circular and related structures, and have used that very format myself, from very small musical works to one long song cycle that in seven movements covers the events of a week-long cycle, and completely dove-tails back to the beginning. You might also want to take a listen to (and study of) important musical pieces that are similar - there are movements in some of Bartok&apos;s string quartets which fit this bill quite nicely.</p><p>Damn, I&apos;m/we&apos;re wandering from microtonal music, and I try to keep focussed there. Rats.</p><p>&gt;One way I could create a story line in the context of my current approach &gt;would be to vary the cost function from point to point in the mesh.</p><p>Jim, it is only my perspective, but I think the piece is way too non-obvious for this approach. Most ears will simply not discern a structure unless it is evinced in much more that the pitch structure.</p><p>&gt;Well, I hope all of my explanation here in physics/computer terms was not &gt;so un-musical to be overly bothersome!</p><p>How would you know if you didn&apos;t attempt that? But I *do* have a suggestion for you: this list, along with another, sort of splintered off from the original tuning list that began back in the 90&apos;s. I started this one to focus directly on the act of making microtonal *music*; there is another group that focuses specifically on the mathematical nature of tuning. Not only would your perspective be of interest there, but the cross-section of your audience would be enormously more suited to understanding the structural points you are working with. I think you should take a look at:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/</a></p><p>Paul, Gene, Dave and the others over there will definitely know more about this stuff than I. If you want to change course a bit and have your tuning framed in a somewhat more conventional &apos;musical&apos; template (though I hate like hell to align myself with convention!), feel free to either post here or write me off-list.</p><p>BTW, if you go over there, ask about Dave Keenan&apos;s very cool 3 or 4 dimensional tuning construct, as built within an Excel spreadsheet and done with 3D glasses, allowing you to fly around a tuning (if I remember even somewhat correctly).</p><p>Wow, I&apos;m tired now.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5437 href="#5437">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2003 9:48:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kukulaj&quot; &lt;kukulaj@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks for the comment and pointers, Jon.

Use e.g. the 8/9 below the root of the<br/>triad, or else the 7/8 or 9/10. The 8/9 sounds most<br/>decisive:<br/>1/1 4/3 3/2 15/8 9/4<br/>to<br/>1/1 5.4 3/2</p><p>while the 7/8 is a more restful harmonic series chord<br/>and is suitable if you want it more leisurely<br/>and less decisive (well this is just personal<br/>view on it expect opinions will differ).</p><p>Melody lines can follow notes of the<br/>triads, though often they contain<br/>scale passages with many &quot;passing tones&quot; - notes<br/>usually on off beats that don&apos;t belong to the<br/>triad of the harmony.</p><p>E.g. if you just play an ascending scale<br/>c d e f g<br/>with c e and g on the beat then that by itself<br/>will already give a feeling of the tonic based triad<br/>even if you have no accompaniment.</p><p>This is only one of many systems of harmonizaation<br/>now, or from the past, and you can invent your<br/>own ones too, e.g. as a result of exploring a tuning.</p><p>But really doesn&apos;t have to be harmony, and you don&apos;t<br/>have to use that partiular harmony system,<br/>any kind of epsiodes can help structure it.</p><p>A change of timbre, or of speed can help.<br/>Or a variation in the volume of the tune so that<br/>you have a louder phrase, then maybe repeat it<br/>exctly again, maybe quieter, maybe transposed<br/>down a bit or something, or whatever.<br/>Long slow increases and decreases of volume or<br/>speed over a matter of several seconds or minutes<br/>can be very effective too.</p><p>Rhythm also helps to give it a structure, which means<br/>to have a repeating pattern that can get broken up<br/>in various ways but is always the same length - the<br/>bar. Usually divided into a number of smaller sections<br/>- the beats, e.g. three or four beats or maybe six or eight.</p><p>Those usually then get divided into halfs or quarters or sometimes<br/>thirds. More rarely you get structures with five beats or seven,<br/>sometimes more.</p><p>Not to be afraid of repetition there. A repeating<br/>rhythm, with a varying pitch can be really<br/>effective.</p><p>...............</p><p>Maybe some of that info could be useful to help add structure<br/>to the piece that a musician will find easy to recognize.</p><p>Even perhaps episodic, some of it as it is, with an occasional incursion<br/>of a recognisable cadence, could be kind of intriguing.<br/>With the cadences there to ground it and group it into<br/>sections, then it may be that the melodic structure that you can hear yourself<br/>will become more noticeable. Maybe you can find some way<br/>to use the cadences to bring out what you hear yourself<br/>for others to be able to hear it more plainly.</p><p>I think that as well as using a richer timbre or maybe<br/>several of them, you could also do with more triads and diads and<br/>less of just the single melody line too to really<br/>show off the harmonic resources of 53-et.</p><p>You should drop in at cnfractalmusic and say hello there.</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cnfractal_music/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cnfractal_music/</a></p><p>Robert</p><p>I have just added chords and cadences to Fractal Tune Smithy.<br/>incidentally.

My little experiment has<br/>two characteristics: it&apos;s algorithmically, pseudo-randomly generated;<br/>and it uses pitches from the 2**(k/53) series. Really the algorithmic<br/>character overwhelms the microtonal character. Thanks, Robert Walker,<br/>for the pointer to the fractal music group. Probably what I am doing<br/>will make more sense there.</p><p>I am amazed, Paul Erlich, that you remember my name from the tuning<br/>list! That was probably 1997 or so! For better or worse, I have so<br/>many little projects clamoring to be bigger projects, none of them get<br/>enough time to really blossom. It&apos;s only about every five years or so<br/>that I get a chance to make any progress with music!</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s worthwhile for me to try to clarify here a bit of what I<br/>was doing, before I run off to other groups.</p><p>The torus and helix business actually has nothing at all to do with<br/>the tuning! What I am trying to do with the torus and helix is to<br/>create the kind of temporal structure that Robert Walker was suggesting.</p><p>An analogy might help. Think of an image on a TV/CRT screen, and the<br/>way that image gets scanned by the electron beam. Each horizontal line<br/>scanned is just a little different than the last line. This is very<br/>similar to what I am doing. There&apos;s a little sequence of notes, and<br/>then the next sequence is a slight variation on that, and then the<br/>next is a slight variation on that. Actually, if I just made the<br/>sequence that way, the torus would be two dimensional. In fact, it was<br/>four dimensional! So a short series of variations on a little phrase<br/>then itself gets repeated with a slight variation! And then that whole<br/>series gets repeated with variation! At each level, the whole piece<br/>gets multiplied in length by some small integer factor. That&apos;s why the<br/>whole thing ends up being 11 minutes long!</p><p>Looking at a specific step in the temporal sequence, it will have 8<br/>neighboring steps: the note played immediately before it in the<br/>temporal sequence, the note played immediately after it, the note<br/>played 4 time steps before, the note played 4 time steps later, the<br/>note played 16 steps before, the note played 16 steps later, etc.<br/>Actually I think this piece didn&apos;t use a size 4 for every dimension of<br/>the torus, but maybe this is enough to get the idea across. The<br/>combination of notes played at one time step is pushed by the<br/>algorithm to be harmonically close to the notes played at each of<br/>these neighboring steps.</p><p>The tonal structure is embedded in the cost function. I forget the<br/>precise details, because I kept changing them as I experimented! But<br/>roughly: at each time step, any subset of the notes can be played, out<br/>of a range of maybe three octaves. The cost function  makes it very<br/>expensive to play too many notes at the same time. The cost is<br/>something like the sum of the &quot;harmonic distances&quot; between every pair<br/>of notes being played simultaneously. So e.g. if five notes were to be<br/>played simultaneously, the cost would add up the harmonic distances of<br/>the ten different pairs of notes involved. The harmonic distance is<br/>something I just hard-coded in a table, where octaves are really<br/>close, perfect fifths (31 microsteps) are slightly less close, major<br/>thirds (17 microsteps) a bit further apart, etc.</p><p>The cost function is also applied, of course, to notes played at<br/>neighboring points. This way the little phrase played on the next turn<br/>of the helix could be very similar but perhaps with one note of the<br/>phrase moved by a perfect fifth.</p><p>I completely agree with Rick McGowan, that what I am doing is making<br/>wallpaper music. I think of it like creating the aural equivalent of<br/>watching puffy clouds roll by on a summer day, looking for faces and<br/>animals etc. Not likely something that would pull people into a<br/>concert hall! But maybe a sort of spare parts box of curious doodles.<br/>The hope is that novel possibilities buried in the structure of<br/>2**(k/53) music might appear amidst all the boring shapes,<br/>possibilities that we would have a hard time discovering without the<br/>doodling because of our powerful perceptual/conceptual habituation to<br/>the 12 note system.</p><p>My thinking on this was powerfully reinforced by reading Blackwood&apos;s<br/>_Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_ book. As I understand it,<br/>conventional Bach to Mahler music is based on puns inherent in the<br/>twelve note system. There are lots of these puns, but I suppose the<br/>most fundamental is that four perfect fifths makes a major third. Of<br/>course there&apos;s also three major thirds makes a unison, or twelve<br/>perfect fifths makes a unison, etc. 2**(k/53) has a totally different<br/>set of puns. The old puns are not available. For example, in<br/>2**(k/53), four perfect fifths comes around to 18 steps, whereas a<br/>major third is 17 steps. So the basic step is pretty darn close to<br/>81/80 - what gets swept under the rug in 12 note music is the basic<br/>building block of 53 note music!</p><p>Anyway, all this thinking doesn&apos;t justify the music if it doesn&apos;t work<br/>when people listen! I really appreciate folks taking the time to<br/>listen and the effort to help with comments! When I get some time to<br/>dive back in, this will help give me good direction to improve the<br/>algorithms to make something that better engages the ear!</p><p>Thanks again!<br/>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=5451 href="#5451">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2003 9:51:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I completely agree with Rick McGowan, that what I am doing is making<br/>&gt; wallpaper music.
