What&apos;s the tuning?</p><p>I think it perfectly expresses the idea of a free<br/>bird within a wood stove.</p><p>Incidentally one of the places I lived had a kind of heater<br/>come radiator in the corner with a vent to the outside,<br/>and regularly every year in the winter a little bird would<br/>take up residence in it - I used to hear it pecking away<br/>inside. It was a blue tit - a bird we get here in the UK,<br/>that eats nuts hanging upside down from the bird feeders and<br/>you often see them in gardens, though it is a woodland bird<br/>really I suppose as you often hear them in woods.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if it was the same one that always inhabited my<br/>radiator every winter, - or if perhaps they passed<br/>the tradition on from one generation to anohter (being<br/>rather<br/>short lived birds I believe).</p><p>What was the bird you found called? Since i don&apos;t know the<br/>US ones of course.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
