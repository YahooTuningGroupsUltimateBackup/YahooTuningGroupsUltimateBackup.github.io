Almost forgot<br/>&gt;  how energizing it is to play with one, with a rock beat<br/>&gt;  on at the same time. Maybe the Yamaha has the same rock<br/>&gt;  beat as my old Casio. I couldn&apos;t find the exact same thing<br/>&gt;  the last time I checked this out. Don&apos;t know if it is &gt;  possible to transfer the beat into the Yamaha either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Stephen<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
