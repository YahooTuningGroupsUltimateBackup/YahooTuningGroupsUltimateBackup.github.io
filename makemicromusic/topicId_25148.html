Of these I selected 11 to comment further on.  If your<br/>piece isn&apos;t one of them, it means I couldn&apos;t think of anything nice<br/>to say about it.</p><p>Here are those 11 by alpha artist&apos;s name.  I also list whether the<br/>piece won or placed in the contest, as well as +1/2, +1 or +2 scores<br/>of my own, if applicable (you got +0 otherwise).</p><p>I think it&apos;s safe to say the quantity and quality were both higher<br/>than last year, and overall there is a staggering degree of<br/>musicianship on display here.  Bravo!</p><p>Chuckk Hubbard<br/>The World Is Ours<br/>Nice piece.  I like the portamenti, odd percussion, and silly tuba<br/>lines. +1/2</p><p>Craig Evans<br/>Hymn of the Flying Spaghetti Monster<br/>Not sure I get the point of the miniatures, but the last one really<br/>kicks butt.  It&apos;s something like Pianodactyl, but upstages that<br/>entry. +1</p><p>David Hamill<br/>Cool My Head<br/>This one has vocals.  This one has vocals.  +2 on general principle.<br/>Also there&apos;s some xentonal deja vu going on, involving James Taylor.<br/>Dude.</p><p>Donald Craig<br/>Study in 31 [finalist]<br/>Not bad, but a letdown for me compared to his excellent entry last year.</p><p>Gene Smith<br/>Pianodactyl<br/>Unmistakably GWS, but perhaps not his best work, though performance<br/>values seem improved.  Love the title.  Relentless theme and variations<br/>appreciated as usual, but perhaps go on a bit too long, especially<br/>considering the shear quantity of sound here.</p><p>Igliashon Jones<br/>Persephone Descends [winner]<br/>A-section confirms: Igs is the fifth Eurythmic.  The change at 4:09 is<br/>to die for. +1</p><p>James Wyness<br/>A Dissolving View [finalist]<br/>Much prettier than your average this-sort-of-thing.  The word &quot;beautiful&quot;<br/>even comes to mind.</p><p>Jon Lyle Smith<br/>Dithyramb<br/>Sounds good.  The themes have a high cliche factor but miraculously<br/>this doesn&apos;t create any problems for the piece.</p><p>Joseph Post<br/>US Gold [finalist]<br/>Fascinating piece, but something&apos;s holding it back. +1/2</p><p>Monroe Golden<br/>Incongruity [winner]<br/>Nice polytonal aspects.  The construction is somewhat artificial, a bit<br/>too literally Philip Glass.  It is strong sonically... I can see why<br/>the judges liked it.  Backward fade-out is total cheese.  At the end of<br/>the day, +1/2</p><p>Shaahin Mohajeri<br/>The Battle of Ahuramazda and Ahriman [finalist]<br/>Recording has issues - dynamic range, lack of high frequencies, etc.<br/>Wonderful writing, though I can hear it working practically the same<br/>in 12-ET.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=25149 href="#25149">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2011 1:57:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Feb 1, 2011 at 4:52 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If your piece isn&apos;t one of them, it means I couldn&apos;t think of anything nice<br/>&gt; to say about it.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=25151 href="#25151">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2011 4:31:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl&gt; If your piece isn&apos;t one of them, it means I couldn&apos;t think of anything nice to say about it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, so my top 2, Chris&apos;s and Domina&apos;s...didn&apos;t even make it on your list.&nbsp; Not to mention my own...but I&apos;ll leave that one out of it unless you (hopefully) contact me personally about it.&nbsp; I really start to wonder if people on the scene dislike or find unimaginative virtually any sort of non-soundscapish songs...as, aside from &quot;Cool My Head&quot; and &quot;Pianodactyl&quot;...virtually all the songs on your list were, again, soundscapes.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=25158 href="#25158">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2011 6:51:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael that is ok.
