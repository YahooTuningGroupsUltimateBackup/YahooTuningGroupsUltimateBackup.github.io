Thanks for<br/>sharing this.  I also had wonderful grandparents (on my mother&apos;s<br/>side) who watched me a lot as a kid.  I feel really lucky to<br/>have had this connection to our past in a way that some people<br/>don&apos;t seem to have had.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 12:28 PM 1/9/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;I guess we all tend to over-romanticize our heroes a bit, but anyone<br/>&gt;who knows me well enough for any amount of time will tell you that my<br/>&gt;biggest hero was my grandmother...and the influence she had on my life<br/>&gt;needs no exaggeratingÂ….my love of nature didn&apos;t come in the front<br/>&gt;door, it came in the back window, and as a kid I spent countless hours<br/>&gt;at my grandmother&apos;s farms climbing in and out of that window . My<br/>&gt;grandmother was also the only adult i ever met as a child who still<br/>&gt;had the magic of youth and innocence as her predominant<br/>&gt;characteristic, and this calm soothed me in a way nothing else ever<br/>&gt;has. She was a farm girl from an early age; a big, lean and mean<br/>&gt;Swede, and man was she was strong ! In fact, she was something of a<br/>&gt;local folkhero as she could and would routinely arm wrestle her son&apos;s<br/>&gt;behemoth football schoolmates into submission until they were at the<br/>&gt;back end of high school:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/mygrandparents1.jpg">http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c33/danstearns/mygrandparents1.jpg</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(remember, that thing she&apos;s holding on her back like a 5 lbs backpack,<br/>&gt;at nearly 50 years old, is a full-grown man )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;When she died two summers ago she left a hole in my life no one could<br/>&gt;ever fill . I miss her very bad, and the world could use a lot more of<br/>&gt;her stock .Someday i hope to write something befitting the influence<br/>&gt;she had on me and the course my life has taken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a></p></div>
