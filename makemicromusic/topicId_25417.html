But I don&apos;t find<br/>that talking about thinking vs. not-thinking is helpful, at least to me. I<br/>find that maybe the analogy that best describes my experience in this realm<br/>is to say it transcends such dualities altogether, or perhaps merges them.<br/>There&apos;s certainly instinct, but there&apos;s also certainly a conscious me--I<br/>don&apos;t simply black out, have no conscious will, then awake some time later<br/>to find that I&apos;ve finished improvising or playing a recital!</p><p>Rather than talking about thinking vs. non-thinking, I prefer to talk about<br/>flow vs. blockage.<br/>Flow is when I feel in shape, in command of my technique and imagination,<br/>and things &quot;just come&quot;...but I will say, often I *will* them into being--I<br/>will follow an idea, and &apos;command&apos; a certain direction while at the same<br/>time my &apos;unconscious&apos; will be working feverishly to explore the myriad<br/>possibilities in some way that I have no access to. But in some way, it&apos;s a<br/>&apos;sum&apos; of all of my years of practice and listening and absorbing the music<br/>I&apos;ve come across.</p><p>There&apos;s a kind of anti-Western, anti-reason, anti-intellectual, anti-thought<br/>thread that musicians (and other artists) often congratulate themselves on<br/>having (&quot;I&apos;m so-----so-----*Eastern*&quot;) For me, this is false road, and I<br/>think a sober balance of both halves and styles of brain processing is<br/>essential to nourish. Improvisation (letting go) is important and so is<br/>diligently crafting your way through a complex composition problem (hanging<br/>on) that can take weeks to solve. There is a dialog at work, and a<br/>cross-fertilization, between these polarities, in my experience...but I can<br/>and only should speak for myself.</p><p>AKJ</p><p>On Sat, Feb 5, 2011 at 1:03 PM, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; My best improvisations are where I&apos;m inside the music - and a few times it<br/>&gt; seems the music has written itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But with improvisations there is a danger of just doing what the body is<br/>&gt; used to or what your mind is used to instead of creating something<br/>&gt; different<br/>&gt; from before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A way around this is learning how to deal with &quot;mistakes&quot;.
