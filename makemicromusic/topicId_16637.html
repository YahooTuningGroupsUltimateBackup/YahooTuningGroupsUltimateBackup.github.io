I started a thread on the &quot;oddmusic&quot; yahoo group, but it was<br/>suggested to me that i post here as well.<br/>the other day i watched this video on the sublime frequencies<br/>channel here: <a href="http://www.vbs.tv/player.php">http://www.vbs.tv/player.php</a>?<br/>bctid=686943905&amp;bccl=NTMzMjU2NDEyX19NVVNJQw==</p><p>it&apos;s of the thai ghost festival. anyway, i was blown away by the<br/>electrified instrument being played. apparently it is a phin. an<br/>image is here as well: <a href="http://www.atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/">http://www.atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/</a><br/>se_asia/phin%20lute%20thailand%20kunitachi.jpg</p><p>I took the above the image and mapped the frets in illustrator. i then<br/>scaled it to the size of an instrument i was building (which wasn&apos;t<br/>far off). i then printed my fret map and layed it across the<br/>instrument, marking all the frets with a pencil. i attached zip ties<br/>as frets and moved them into position.<br/>the tuning sounds great, but there are certain frets i am sure are<br/>off. with further playing it seems that the frets are spaced so that<br/>you can play in different keys.</p><p>i did a quick and dirty recording of it, so you all can help me sort<br/>the fretting out. here&apos;s all the notes on one string, starting with<br/>the open string and<br/>working up the neck: <a href="http://www.et-ia.com/dropbox/pinallfrets.mp3">www.et-ia.com/dropbox/pinallfrets.mp3</a><br/>here&apos;s another one of me jamming (albiet poorly) on the frets that<br/>sound nicest to my ears: <a href="http://www.et-ia.com/dropbox/phinjam.mp3">www.et-ia.com/dropbox/phinjam.mp3</a><br/>and here&apos;s the original mp3 from sublime frequencies. notice how much<br/>better his jamming is then mine. :) maybe some of you pitch sensitive<br/>types can tell me what his tuning is?<br/><a href="http://www.et-ia.com/dropbox/molamjam.mp3">www.et-ia.com/dropbox/molamjam.mp3</a><br/>here&apos;s an image of my instrument: <a href="http://www.et-ia.com/dropbox/mephin.jpg">www.et-ia.com/dropbox/mephin.jpg</a><br/>it only has 2 strings, as it wasn&apos;t intended for this purpose. i&apos;m<br/>kind of just using it as a &quot;proof of concept&apos; for building a cigar box<br/>phin.<br/>i like it though, b/c now i can try out any tuning i want. it sounds<br/>pretty good too. i have to appologize for the tuning though, i just<br/>tuned it to the resonance of the tin. i hope it doesn&apos;t make it<br/>difficult to understand the intervals.<br/>you will also notice a subtle wah sound. this was a little happy<br/>accident in the design. it&apos;s me pushing on the tin and bending it in<br/>slightly. i like the sound a lot.</p><p>ok, sorry for the super long post hahaha. hope some of this is of<br/>interest to you all.</p><p>peace,<br/>-et-</p></div><h3><a id=16638 href="#16638">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Thompson &#x3C;microtonaldan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2007 2:23:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ethan Tripp&quot; &lt;ethantripp@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all, I&apos;m new to microtonal music, I just started to get into the<br/>&gt; idea of building myself some microtonal instruments to tool around<br/>&gt; with.
