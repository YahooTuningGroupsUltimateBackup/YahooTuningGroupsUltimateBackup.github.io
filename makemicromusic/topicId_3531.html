Parsing text files is one of the easiest of programming tasks - couldn&apos;t one write a small and simple tool that would read in a *real* Scala file and output to the Metasynth format?</p><p>Hopefully they&apos;ll see the light with all the work Manuel has done, but this might be an alternative...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
