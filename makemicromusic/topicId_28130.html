That&apos;s &lt; -1 5 0 0 -2 | and  &lt; -2 0 3 -3 1 |,<br/>respectively.</p><p>243/242 makes two neutral thirds equal a perfect fifth (3/2 = 11/9 *<br/>11/9 * 243/242).</p><p>243/242 also tempers the difference between taking two steps up from<br/>the 63/55 to the 4/3 (220/189, or 263 cents) and taking two steps up<br/>from the 11/9 to the 10/7 (90/77, or 270 cents), which significantly<br/>smooths out that part of the scale and related intervals.</p><p>1375/1372 is the difference between taking three steps up from the<br/>63/55 to the 10/7 (550/441, or 382 cents) and taking three steps up<br/>from the 15/14 to the 4/3 (56/45, or 379 cents). Although I wasn&apos;t<br/>intending to have too many 5-limit harmonies, this &quot;accidental 5/4&quot;<br/>still seemed to need tempering to smooth out the scale.</p><p>1375/1372 also tempers out the difference between the semitone moving<br/>up from 1/1 to 15/14 (15/14, or 119 cents) and the next semitone from<br/>15/14 to 63/55 (294/275, or 116 cents).</p><p>I don&apos;t see a temperament name for this combination of commas, so I<br/>don&apos;t know what to call it.</p><p>This is the resulting scale:</p><p>!

I clearly wasn&apos;t paying enough attention,<br/>because there&apos;s ample material out there showing that the maqam Huzzam is<br/>Turkish (and perhaps Arabic?), and I apologize for any inadvertant rudeness.<br/>My ignorance is, unfortunately, very great.</p><p>Next, to Mike:</p><p>&gt; Funny, my scale your piece NOT in 41EDO sounds sadder...almost<br/>&gt; &quot;down a key/semitone&quot;...but more relaxed and a bit less sharp/<br/>&gt; assertive in mood to my ears.</p><p>The second note in the piece -- which is a common note throughout -- is the<br/>9th note in the scale. It&apos;s 110/63 (965 cents) in my scale and 12/7 (933<br/>cents) in yours, so it&apos;s definitely &quot;down a semitone&quot;. I like it less than<br/>the original. It tough to objectively understand yourself, but I think the<br/>965-cent note is flat enough to be a little &quot;in your face&quot;, but not<br/>FLAT-flat, if you know what I mean. The 933-cent note is just more (or less,<br/>rather) than my ear wants to hear.</p><p>The other two replacements you made -- 19/18 (94 cents) replacing 15/14 (119<br/>cents) and 11/6 (1049 cents) replacing 28/15 (1080 cents) are barely played,<br/>and usually in the background, so they&apos;d make less of a difference to the<br/>piece overall.</p><p>&gt;    The parts that really threw me around a bit were at<br/>&gt; 1) 24-27 seconds<br/>&gt; 2) 40-45 seconds</p><p>Interestingly, those don&apos;t strike me as unstable or vague.</p><p>I also don&apos;t think this piece as written feels &quot;12-EDO&quot; to me, and I wonder<br/>what 12-equal people (is there a term for that? 12-harmonicists? Microtonal<br/>muggles?) would think. The first two notes of the melody drop from 1200<br/>cents to 850, which is a warning shot to everyone that this isn&apos;t a normally<br/>tuned piece. Then it bounces back up to the octave and down to the perfect<br/>fifth, to make you comfortable that I won&apos;t violate your sense of tonality<br/>too much. The flute is, generally speaking, more &quot;normal&quot; in the notes it<br/>chooses than the guitar, which carries the neutral and septimal minor<br/>chords; however, the guitar is a mellow instrument with a smooth texture,<br/>which avoids making the chords sound too harsh. Also, the chord roots are<br/>1/1, 3/2, 4/3, and 11/9, which makes for a diatonic-sounding structure with<br/>some xenharmony thrown in.</p><p>So it&apos;s far enough from 12-EDO without being obnoxious, which is<br/>more-or-less what I was going for.

Whatever makes you happy is fine, of course, but you&apos;re losing more than you&apos;re gaining.</p><p>Here&apos;s why:</p><p>----------</p><p>1. Using a subset of an EDO to represent a JI scale always introduces error. Error isn&apos;t always bad, of course; it&apos;s this error that lets us temper out a specific comma, for instance. How that error gets applied, however, is critical.</p><p>---</p><p>2. When you round intervals to their nearest EDO steps, you try to minimize the error for each interval independently. Because you&apos;re considering each interval independently, there&apos;s no mathematical relationship between the number of EDO steps for one interval vs. another. In other words, this isn&apos;t a regular temperament.</p><p>As a result, &quot;31 EDO tempers out 352/351&quot; isn&apos;t true for your scale. It can&apos;t be, because the primes 2, 3, 11, and 13 aren&apos;t getting mapped to the EDO. In fact, the notion of commas becomes *meaningless*. If you do get relationships that look like an interval has been tempered out, they&apos;re *coincidental* -- but *not* a necessary result of the process.</p><p>---</p><p>3. When you use a formal mapping to determine which EDO steps represent a JI interval, you are applying the error in a consistent way.</p><p>When given a collection of monzos that represent your intervals, you use the same val for the EDO to create homomorphisms. (In other words, the single val &lt;V| is used with each interval&apos;s monzo |M&gt; to create &lt;V|M&gt;, which tells you the number of EDO steps you should use to represent each interval.)</p><p>Because these homomorphisms are based on the primes of the intervals AND the way these primes get mapped to the EDO, this *is* a regular temperament. You *can* say &quot;31 EDO tempers out 352/351&quot; because that&apos;s a necessary result of using the mapping process to get the EDO steps for each interval.</p><p>This sounds complex, but it&apos;s really not. I have a simple spreadsheet that does the job for me.</p><p>----------</p><p>In the current case, you had only one 19-limit interval in the scale. Because of that, we could adjust the 19-limit val without affecting any other intervals. It&apos;s therefore a best-possible-case scenario for the &quot;rounding&quot; approach vs. the &quot;mapping&quot; approach, because the rounding doesn&apos;t really do any damage to the relationships between the EDO intervals, and you ended up with a scale that *could* result from a val; however, that&apos;s *coincidental*, not *necessary*. On the other hand, if you had had other 19-limit intervals, choosing the rounded number for one versus the mapped number for another would have resulted in having an irregular temperament, and all notions of &quot;such-and-such comma is tempered out&quot; would have flown out the window.</p><p>You may not like the fact that regular temperaments can give you the &quot;wrong&quot; interval, i.e., one that you wouldn&apos;t have picked if you were rounding. I didn&apos;t either, which is why I thought I was doing something wrong -- but I wasn&apos;t. As Graham succinctly explained, &quot;When you choose a regular temperament, you give an inherent error to each prime interval (mapping of a prime number). Those errors accumulate when you look at smaller intervals. After a point, you&apos;ll always [have] something with a higher error than the step size you&apos;re dealing with.&quot; Perfectly said.</p><p>Thus using mappings (i.e., vals) to create a scale has a significant theoretical advantage over rounding for the general case. It *is* Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Middle Path&quot; between JI and EDOs, whereas rounding is not. If you like things like Porcupine and Mavila, you need to pay attention to the mappings, and not just rounding.</p><p>Obviously, you don&apos;t have to follow the theory, and you can use any theory (or no theory!) to create scales that make you happy. Also, if you have a physical instrument that can&apos;t step outside of a certain EDO, you may use what you can despite the fact that it&apos;s not theoretically the right way to go. But the mapping theory is clearly superior in most cases to the rounding theory.</p><p>To sum up: If you care about tempering commas, you should use the mapping method. Also, it seems to me that the mapping method is an important part of tuning theory because it retains the relationships of the primes in the intervals, whereas rounding is not because it does not.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=28149 href="#28149">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2011 10:13:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/noon-ish_mikeMod-31EDO.mp3">http://www.freivald.org/~jake/documents/noon-ish_mikeMod-31EDO.mp3</a></p><p>Nice piece, and it doesn&apos;t sound like 12edo in case you were wondering.</p></div><h3><a id=28150 href="#28150">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2011 1:05:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Nice piece, and it doesn&apos;t sound like 12edo in case you were wondering.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hate to say it....but I actually like the 31EDO-tempered version of this song best so far. :-P&nbsp;&nbsp; And I never meant to say it sounds like 12EDO...but rather it sounds predictable/steady/smooth enough in how it travels between consonance and dissonance that I don&apos;t think 12EDO listeners would be bugged by it.&nbsp; This time around...only one part and not two, the part around 28 seconds, sounds &quot;vague&quot; to my ears...although I know we (Jake and myself) disagree on that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I almost wish I could trick myself into going beyond 31EDO...because it seems just about every scale I make or work with can be summarized in a very-near-ideal sounding form in 31EDO.&nbsp; Even when it adds a fair deal of tempering-related error, on the whole, retuning to 31EDO seems to (to me at least) stabilize most microtonal music to a fair extent.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=28167 href="#28167">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2011 7:49:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you for the tuning - I will be trying it - if I can manage good<br/>results I&apos;ll post it.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Aug 1, 2011 at 1:24 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This piece started as an exercise in scale creation.
