I kept hoping for a nice bass marimba or bass gong to enter at some point 1/3 of the way through. Don&apos;t you dare change the ending. It is perfect. I would tone down the percussion just a bit, since the toned instruments are so percussive. Just two or three low boooonnnnngggs and you&apos;re done! Let us know when.</p><p>Rick,<br/>This was a lot of fun. I enjoy these tuning exercises and ear gymnastics. The world of tuning is complex indeed. I liked the way the A tuning was almost diatonic, except for a few notes, and the way it gets more complex as you go. Great stuff!<br/>--</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>Music that&apos;s &quot;Fake but Accurate&quot;!<br/>Web page: <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net</a><br/>Blog: <a href="http://www.xanga.com/music1024">http://www.xanga.com/music1024</a><br/>Podcast: <a href="http://podcast1024.blogspot.com">http://podcast1024.blogspot.com</a><br/>RSS: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024">http://feeds.feedburner.com/Podcast1024</a><br/>Music: <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers</a></p></div>
