I<br/>loved the time when Shawn Beard, who has a very 19th century style,<br/>offered something up and was told it sounded like Galuppi.&quot;</p><p>He (Roman Turovsky) wrote to me after I posted the complete version (all<br/>3 movements) of &quot;Sonata for Guitar &amp; Harpsichord in 19-ET&quot; at ZeBox. He<br/>said the 3rd movement was a &quot;NewAgelike mess&quot;. I think that&apos;s probably a<br/>compliment.</p><p>For those of you who are yearning for something a bit more substantial<br/>(and less rigid) in 11-et than &quot;Xenophon 3&quot;, I&apos;m working up a new piece<br/>even as we speak. All versions of &quot;Xenophon&quot; were created with Orion<br/>Pro, which is a nice software for what it does -- but it&apos;s<br/>pattern-based, which imparts a certain amount of inflexibility. The new<br/>work will be created with Harmony Assistant and will hopefully have more<br/>to offer.</p><p>Best,</p><p>jls</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2007 8:39:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For those of you who are yearning for something a bit more substantial<br/>&gt; (and less rigid) in 11-et than &quot;Xenophon 3&quot;, I&apos;m working up a new<br/>piece<br/>&gt; even as we speak.</p><p>Still haven&apos;t managed to wean anyone away from 11-et to Hanson[11], I<br/>see.

As a {2,7,11}<br/>system, it has commas 352/343 and 14641/14336, each with its own<br/>temoperament. The first works via (11/2)/(7/3)^3 = 343/343, and the<br/>second via (11/8)^4/(7/2) = 14641/14336. But there&apos;s more--you can<br/>take 11-et to be a {2,7,9,11} temperament, treating 9 as a prime and<br/>mapping it to 35. Now you get all the commas of 22 where 3 appears<br/>only to an even power, which means a lot of them.</p><p>&gt; Only 13-ET really comes close to 11-ET&apos;s eccentric<br/>&gt; nature.</p><p>I think that&apos;s a bit more eccentric.</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2007 11:05:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thus spoke Herman:</p><p>&gt; But for me, one of the things that&apos;s great about 11-ET is its own<br/>unique nature, far from the usual temperaments, and not having any<br/>consistent interpretation as JI.

There&apos;s always something ineresting and &apos;twisted&apos; about<br/>any tuning that approximates JI badly. And the interesting thing is,<br/>there are fewer of these types of tunings, theoretically, because the<br/>larger you go in EDOs, you have an infinite number of EDOs that<br/>approximate JI by having some close approximation to some harmonic or<br/>other, whereas there are only a medium-sized handful of EDOs, towards<br/>the low end of the divisions, to pick from if you want an &apos;out-there&apos;<br/>tuning. 11 and 13 are remarkably good examples of this, and since they<br/>surround 12, they also speak to the specialness of 12, too.
