The American composer Charles Ives (1874-1954) used &quot;Rollo&quot; as a short-hand for musical complacency. Rollo was, according to John Kirkpatrick, &quot;a good little boy with an inquiring nature, and the more he has to have everthing explained to him in great detail, the more information could be packed into each Rollo book. For Ives he became a symbol of the literal mind unable to imagine anything beyond what he&apos;d been taught.&quot; Or, as Henry and Sidney Cowell put it, Rollo was for Ives &quot;one of those white-livered weaklings who cannot stand up and receive the full force of a dissonance like a man.&quot;</p><p>Ives used Rollo, in particular, to stand for those music critics unable or unwilling to comprehend his music. For example, he states in his Memos: &quot;Every so often, an article or a clipping or a &apos;verbal massage&apos; is sent to a man (see name on dotted line), which shows that Rollo has a job, writing his opinion about things the facts of which he doesn&apos;t know and doesn&apos;t try to know. If he can&apos;t hear and doesn&apos;t know it, he&apos;s a mental-musico-defective (from the neck up) - if he doesn&apos;t try to hear and knows he doesn&apos;t know, then he is getting money under false pretenses! In other words, these commercial pansies are either stupid or they are liars.&quot;&quot;</p><p>Yours in a pluralistic musical universe,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=23242 href="#23242">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2010 12:03:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles Ives - my classical music hero!</p><p>On Sun, Sep 19, 2010 at 12:51 PM, jonszanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>: &quot;Every so often, an article or a clipping or a &apos;verbal massage&apos; is<br/>sent to a man (see name on dotted line), which shows that Rollo has a<br/>job, writing his opinion about things the facts of which he doesn&apos;t<br/>know and doesn&apos;t try to know.
