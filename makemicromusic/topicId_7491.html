Actually just listening to it now,<br/>it is a mix that Mary Ackerley did some years ago<br/>now, of another improvisation altogether, and I seem to have<br/>just lost that improvisation. I don&apos;t know what happened<br/>to it, as I only have a whole series of mp3s and they<br/>are all different bit rate versions of this one instead<br/>of being what I thought they were.</p><p>I may have deleted the .wav file when I cleaned out my<br/>hard disk by deleting a whole lot of experimental<br/>C-sound .wav files that I&apos;d made recently to test the<br/>FTS C-sound save, some of which would be fractal<br/>tunes in this same scale.</p><p>I&apos;m not so organised about backing up my<br/>.wav files as i am about my c-code at present.</p><p>Maybe I never recorded it? Sorry, I had a lot on at<br/>the time and was rather confused when I posted that.<br/>I can do another one though, it&apos;s a great scale to<br/>improvise in, won&apos;t be the same of course.</p><p>Anyway Mary Ackerley is the one to credit for the mix.<br/>She is using GigaStudio there and the instrument<br/>is the cello from Dan Dean&apos;s solo strings, with<br/>reverb added. So it is no wonder you like it.</p><p>Midi clips are also much faster to upload too if<br/>you have a slow connection :-).</p><p>I&apos;ll try and do a few more mp3s though.<br/>Can&apos;t expect to do a mix of the quality<br/>of Mary Ackerley&apos;s work but at least you<br/>can hear them on the same instruments<br/>that I&apos;m using.</p><p>Been workin hard on the programming,<br/>and haven&apos;t had time to download and listen to the<br/>stream of new music that&apos;s been posted<br/>recently. I think it&apos;s great to see all this<br/>activity too and look forward to<br/>downloading it presently and listen<br/>to what everyone has been doing recently :-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2004 6:59:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ZipZapPooZoo&quot; &lt;chris@m...&gt;</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/7491">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/7491</a></p><p> wrote:<br/>&gt; Funny. . .
