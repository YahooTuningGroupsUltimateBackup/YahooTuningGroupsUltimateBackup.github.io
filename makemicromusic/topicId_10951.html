The ABC (that is, the<br/>Australian Broadcasting Commission) had regular broadcasts<br/>for this purpose during the fifties when I was a wee lad, and<br/>published a series of Community Song Books.  I have their<br/>book No. 40 here, which I found at a Trash&apos;n&apos; Treasure sale<br/>a couple of years back, and cherish.  Later, from about age<br/>7, I listened to my grandmother&apos;s old 78s, some being pop<br/>songs of the 20s to 40s, but mostly classics.  They had a very<br/>different sound to them, which I could never put my finger<br/>on.  At home during the sixties, I would listen to classics on<br/>the ABC and from my father&apos;s collection of LPs at 33 1/3<br/>rpm, all modern recordings.  Apart from the blatant overuse<br/>of stereo separation on those LPs, I always felt they were<br/>NQR (not quite right).</p><p>Well, the point of this long-winded story is to justify my<br/>thesis - the earliest sounds we hear are the ones that<br/>probably feel best to us.  And based on some discussions I&apos;ve<br/>observed on various lists in the past few months (sorry to be<br/>so vague) it seems very likely that orchestral string players,<br/>at least, have continued using some form of meantone well<br/>into the twentieth century.</p><p>Of course, I can shoot my own theory down in flames quite<br/>easily!  :-) Why do I love Indian music, both classical and<br/>popular, when I had never heard any until I was 17 or so?</p><p>A question for you all: what tunings sound best to you?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.362 / Virus Database: 267.13.8/183 - Release Date: 25/11/05</p></div><h3><a id=10958 href="#10958">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2005 5:10:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, 25 Nov 2005, Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [much snipt]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In Pythagorean tuning, G# is *higher* than Ab by<br/>&gt; &gt; the Pythagorean comma, which you calculated above as ~23.46<br/>cents.
