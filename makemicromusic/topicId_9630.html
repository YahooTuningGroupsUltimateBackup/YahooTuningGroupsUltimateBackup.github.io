The lower diagram show the moments of symmetry of the series. I am sure there might be a better answer , Erv has gone through the first 200 diagonals and calculated the recurrent sequence and it convergence.<br/>   The chord you mention comes up in Stravinsky&apos;s &apos;Song of the Nightingale&apos; as the generating chord. it is one of my favorites of Igor if not the most so.</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/firstpelog.GIF">http://anaphoria.com/firstpelog.GIF</a> &gt;&gt; this is the closest i can thing of off the top of my head although i<br/>&gt;&gt;know other recurrent sequences should work also &gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ah,  another mysterious Erv Wilson diagram.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, is the idea that 1.366054etc.  is a generator ratio that will make a<br/>&gt;scale with lots of 4th/tritone sonotiries?  &gt;Obviously,  the 5th is 1.5,  and the 4th is 1.3333,  so this is in &gt;between.

Just,  ET,  meantone,  whatever, I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; interested in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any ideas?</p><p>A Viennese trichord would be C-Db-Gb in the key of C, or B-C-F in B. (I like that chord; I&apos;ve used it more than a few times in fact. Also try adding an additional fourth above the top note, i.e. a diminished octave: C-Db-Gb-Cb or B-C-F-Bb.)</p><p>In JI, that would be a tricky one, since we&apos;re dealing with Schoebergian 12-tone ideas. C-Db-Gb could also be C-C#-F#. In meantone, the tuning for each would be different.</p><p>In 12-tone, the set would be {0, 1, 6}. In 31-tone, the &quot;flat&quot; version would be {0, 3, 16}, while the &quot;sharp&quot; version would be {0, 2, 15}. You&apos;d have to listen to both and see which one you&apos;re looking for. In 19-tone, the former is {0, 2, 10}; the latter {0, 1, 9}.</p><p>And it gets more complicated in JI and extended Pythagorean (and by implication, 41- and 53-tone), because converted 12-tone music often engages in &quot;comma floating&quot;, potentially requiring adaptive JI practive. I only expect the third note to be a perfect fourth higher than the second, but it doesn&apos;t have to be if you want some really disturbing harmonization ;). In 53-tone, a minor second tends to be 5 degrees, or &quot;commas&quot; in common terms for that tuning, but 4-comma semitones also occur. Augmented primes can be 3 or 4 commas. A perfect fourth is always 22 commas, or else it&apos;s not very perfect....</p><p>In 5-limit JI, you can have {1/1, 16/15, 64/45}, {1/1, 135/128, 45/32} or {1/1, 27/25, 36/25}.</p><p>Good luck!</p></div><h3><a id=9638 href="#9638">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2005 2:08:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Christopher and Danny,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>&quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Christopher Bailey escriba:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m looking to write piece<br/>&gt; &gt; that uses the 3-note<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch-collection that I<br/>&gt; &gt; dislike the most  (I like<br/>&gt; &gt; to make myself compose for<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments or materials<br/>&gt; &gt; that I hate. . .

See a picture at <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/Sub_Pages/diamond-15-inc.gif">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/Sub_Pages/diamond-15-inc.gif</a></p><p>Take 9:14:20 of the C overtone series, which can be called D 9/8, B 7/4, E 5/4. Not exactly what you were talking about, but a nice &quot;pun&quot; on those intervals. You have an interval of 14:9, close to 3:2, and 10:7, very close to the 64:45 that I think you mean by the C#. It has a nice edge to it. Add a C in the base, and suddenly it sounds like part of an overtone series. Swap the D 9/8 for the E 5/4 and you have a nice jazzy ninth chord, with the C in the bass.</p><p>You can do the same with lots of other diamond intervals. Try this one: G 3/2 up by 3:2 to D 9/8, then up by a 13:9 to A 13/8. This is even closer to the C-G-C#.</p><p>Then look at the utonality. The best I can do on the C undertone series is F 4/3 up by 3:2 to C1/1 then up by 16:11 to G 16/11. Just a slight amount off from your C-G-C#. There are about five others in that scale that are very close.</p><p>When you compose with the tonality diamond, you have the added advantage of different colors for every modulation within the scale. The color of a D 9/8, B 7/4, E 5/4 is far different from the color of G 3/2, D 9/8, A 13/8. Take advantage of the color change to shift the moodes. Then you can modulate to another step of the tonality diamond and have the same color, but a different pitch. There&apos;s a whole world between the 2:1!</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p><p>Music that&apos;s &quot;Fake but Accurate&quot;!<br/>Web page: <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net</a><br/>Podcast: <a href="http://podcast1024.blogspot.com">http://podcast1024.blogspot.com</a><br/>Another Podcast: <a href="http://BumperMusic.blogspot.com">http://BumperMusic.blogspot.com</a><br/>Music: <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.soundclick.com/PrentRodgers</a></p></div><h3><a id=9657 href="#9657">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2005 11:10:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;of course the other rather obvious option that we all seem to have<br/>&gt;glossed over is to  find a good just version of this trichord and create<br/>&gt;a scale by making a chain of them. of course you could find the worse<br/>&gt;intonation for this chord you could find too , and put it in the chain<br/>&gt;you hate the most<br/>&gt;</p><p>True enough.</p><p>Actually, though,  if I&apos;m gonna go the Just route,  might as well create a<br/>scale with varying intervals,  so that every &quot;attempt to approximate&quot; this<br/>trichord contains a different interval set. . . that&apos;s what I&apos;m after I<br/>think.

These &quot;zig-zags&quot; are convergent series based upon simple formulas<br/>(I believe that Wilson found them initially in paths down Pascal&apos;s<br/>triangle), with segments of the series immediately interpretable as<br/>consecutive generating intervals in a scale.  Scales generated in this<br/>way have some nice features: some generate difference tones that are<br/>themselves scale tones, some resemble familiar tunings (meantones,<br/>pelogs, slendros etc.), most are expressed as rational numbers, making<br/>them suitable for just intonation.  Based on your description of your<br/>project, any series converging on a value between 1.4 (or thereabouts)<br/>and 1.5  should do the trick for you.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
