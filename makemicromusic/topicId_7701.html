But, we did try to add<br/>different colours with different articulations,<br/>dynamics, and Mike&apos;s glissados in his playing.</p><p>I thought it was an interesting idea and I wanted<br/>to share these tracks with the group!<br/>So, give them a listen when you have the chance<br/>and let me know what you think!</p><p>Mike and I had fun doing this project!</p><p>Thanks!<br/>Take care!<br/>           Joel</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/hickmanpancini">http://www.myspace.com/hickmanpancini</a></p></div>
