I&apos;ve also heard that Reggae (or one of its forbears) was taken to the West Indies from Senegal by sailors.  So maybe the banjos took a similar route -- from Africa but not with the slaves.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2008 11:17:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;    In regard to how banjos made it here from Africa...I recently<br/>&gt;read that the slavers let the slaves play music occasionally on the<br/>&gt;voyages, presumably to have some entertainment and break the monotony<br/>&gt;of the trip.

You had the Spanish, then the<br/>French, then errant sailors from Ireland doing a side job,<br/>and anybody else who cared to give it a try for a buck.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>MDK &#x3C;mdk@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/21/2008 5:30:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve also heard that Reggae (or one of its<br/>&gt; forbears) was taken to the West Indies from Senegal by<br/>&gt; sailors.</p><p>Yeah its called Mento. If you listen to some Ska you can hear its like a mix of Mento and American R&apos;n&apos;B. Ska slowed down and became Rock Steady (1966), which then turned into Reggae (1967 / 68).</p><p>Not the best way to listen to it, but one of my ska / rocksteady favourites :</p><p>The Pioneers : Long shot kick the bucket</p><p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HeGCzEssgEM">http://youtube.com/watch?v=HeGCzEssgEM</a></p><p>i guess this is going quite off topic now :)</p><p>martin.</p></div>
