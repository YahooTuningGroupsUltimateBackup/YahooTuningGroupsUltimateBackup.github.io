When he plays trumpet, he plays it like a blues player would play. My music is not that deep-not as deep as his-not as deep as Hot Lips Page or Charlie Parker, because Yard knew the blues.&quot;  and...&quot; Johnny Hodges is a blues player...He could moan a while.&quot; (p310). Hodges was Duke Ellington&apos;s long time sax man...and Duke&apos;s blues album &quot;Blues in Orbit&quot; is a masterpiece...looks like there&apos;s some deep blues in Ellington&apos;s music too...and Bird wrote many great blues standards, including &quot;Billie&apos;s Bounce,&quot; &quot;Au Privave,&quot; and &quot;Blues for Alice,&quot; which is a masterful reworking of the traditional 12 bar form.<br/>   And Carl...you are absolutely incorrect in your assessment that rock has nothing to do with Delta blues...Rob Johnson&apos;s songs and guitar playing had a vast influence on rock players; the shuffle rhythm that is so ubiquitous in rock music (&quot;Smokin&apos; in the Boys Room,&quot; by Motley Crew is a great example) comes straight from Rob&apos;s playing...listen to him sometime and you&apos;ll see what I mean. And &quot;Crossroads,&quot; &quot;Love in Vain,&quot; Sweet Home Chicago,&quot; and many more of his tunes were taken by groups such as Cream and the Stones and turned into rock standards. And since Johnson was heavily influenced by Son House and other older Delta cats, guess some of their spirit is in rock, too. And again...I&apos;m betting most folks here have little knowledge of Hendrix&apos;s early roots, playing blues and R&amp;B on the chitlin&apos; circuit...when he played the Monterey Pop Fest in 1967, he started out with &quot;Killin&apos; Floor,&quot; by Wolf, and also included &quot;Rock me, Baby,&quot; by BB King in his set....I don&apos;t mind a discussion about this subject, but a more informed discussion would be better.</p><p>   And Carl again...when you say silly things like we&apos;ll be telling you that Gershwin was black, you add nothing but nonsense to the chat. You have a long history of saying crap like that, and you seem to have a real knack for starting a ruckus...in my opinion, this list would be a more peaceful place if you were not on it.</p><p>   And...of course there are many influences in American music, from all sorts of places...but, this thread started by Lumma saying the blues began and ended with Johnson, which is very far removed from reality...the blues, and the deep feeling it contains, are an essential ingredient of jazz, R&amp;B, gospel, soul, and R&amp;R, and folks like Gershwin as well...best...Hstick &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2011 11:44:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;And again...I&apos;m betting most folks here have little knowledge of  Hendrix&apos;s<br/>&gt;early roots, playing blues and R&amp;B on the chitlin&apos;  circuit...when he played the<br/>&gt;Monterey Pop Fest in 1967, he started out with &quot;Killin&apos; Floor,&quot; by Wolf, and<br/>&gt;also  included &quot;Rock me, Baby,&quot; by BB King in his set....I don&apos;t mind a<br/>&gt;discussion about this subject, but a more informed discussion would be  better.&quot;</p><p>   Yet it seems...you have to go pretty far off the beaten path (and before his<br/>fame) to find Hendrix playing straight blues.</p><p>&gt;&quot;but, this thread started by Lumma saying the blues began and ended with<br/>&gt;Johnson&quot;</p><p>    Well, of course it didn&apos;t, there were so many great blues artists after<br/>Johnson.

I&apos;d still vote no...you get artists like Stevie Ray Vaughn<br/>who were of another level...but what they did was IMVHO very much famous because<br/>it added new, very different, elements to the blues formula (in his case, almost<br/>shred-rock-like solos).

But how many<br/>famous current artists do you see following the 3-or-so chord blues formula in<br/>all of their songs making huge waves?  I&apos;m hard pressed to name even one...maybe<br/>if SRV was still alive..ok, maybe Eric Clapton (who still does straight blues<br/>every now and then)...but that&apos;s about it.

The point is not that everybody is playing the traditional<br/>blues, but rather that traditional blues is a major starting point for all<br/>these other styles, they are all unthinkable without the blues behind them<br/>and within them.</p><p>Stevie Ray Vaughn and Eric Clapton are, in my opinion, good examples of lame<br/>derivative music and playing. All the white english guitarists in the 60s<br/>were desperate to try and emulate the delta blues players (this is<br/>documented, so if anyone starts objecting i will not reply), none moreso<br/>than clapton, who is just a particularly lame version. The more you imitate,<br/>the lamer you are. Stevie Ray is just warmed over Hendrix, whose sandal he<br/>is not fit to untie.</p><p>On Fri, Jan 28, 2011 at 2:44 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;And again...I&apos;m betting most folks here have little knowledge of<br/>&gt; Hendrix&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;early roots, playing blues and R&amp;B on the chitlin&apos; circuit...when he<br/>&gt; played the<br/>&gt; &gt;Monterey Pop Fest in 1967, he started out with &quot;Killin&apos; Floor,&quot; by Wolf,<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt;also included &quot;Rock me, Baby,&quot; by BB King in his set....I don&apos;t mind a<br/>&gt; &gt;discussion about this subject, but a more informed discussion would be<br/>&gt; better.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet it seems...you have to go pretty far off the beaten path (and before<br/>&gt; his<br/>&gt; fame) to find Hendrix playing straight blues.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;but, this thread started by Lumma saying the blues began and ended with<br/>&gt; &gt;Johnson&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, of course it didn&apos;t, there were so many great blues artists after<br/>&gt; Johnson.
