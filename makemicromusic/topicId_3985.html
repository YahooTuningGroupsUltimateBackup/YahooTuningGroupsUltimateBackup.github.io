and just goes<br/>on as if the pitch arrived at is the tonic.  so the &quot;comma pump&quot;<br/>example of I-vi-ii-V-I in just intonation would result in the<br/>pitch of the overall system dropping by 81:80 every time through.<br/>i&apos;ve only seen this described as &quot;undesireable&quot; -- it is even<br/>one of the sources of &quot;pain&quot; defined by John deLaubenfels (via<br/>Joe Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary).</p><p>i have been wondering if this effect might not be exploited rather<br/>than avoided.  if a piece of music had a theme that kept dropping<br/>in pitch, lower and lower and lower -- yet the harmonic logic implied<br/>it shouldn&apos;t, might this have a striking effect, maybe a perplexing<br/>or even unnverving one?  maybe it would be hard to pull off &quot;well&quot;,<br/>but i&apos;ve been thinking it is worth trying, and wondering if anyone else<br/>has explored this.  i thought for a while that this is what &quot;adaptive JI&quot;<br/>is -- but on exploring more, i don&apos;t think that is the case.  adaptive JI<br/>seems to avoid commatic drift too.</p><p>i appreciate the idea of harmonic &quot;pain&quot;, and the effort to minimize it.<br/>but on the otehr hand, some of my personal favorite moments in music are<br/>incredibly painful.  the big clashing dissonant chord at the end of strauss&apos;s<br/>&quot;salome&quot; comes to mind.  i also understand why commatic drift would usually<br/>be something to be avoided, for many reasons, but couldn&apos;t it be used<br/>to achieve an interesting effect as well?</p><p>also, i wanted to say -- i&apos;ve been away from the tuning community for a while,<br/>and on coming back, i&apos;ve been delighted to find it thriving!  joe monzo&apos;s<br/>dictionary has grown and is full of information.  and Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s<br/>scala -- well, i couldn&apos;t believe what it&apos;s become!  as i started working<br/>on music again, i was using the old installation of scala on a unix machine<br/>i used to use, mostly just making use of the CALC command.  eventually i<br/>went to the online help pages, and after a while looked at the main scala page<br/>and saw *screenshots*.  screenshots?!  within an hour i had downloaded the<br/>new scala to my pc and was listening to NM tredecimal middle split fifth chords<br/>and other such things.  wonderful, wonderful!</p><p>paul</p><p>--<br/>. . .   p  f  l  y  . . .<br/>    <a href="http://www.neuron.net/~pfly/duckapus.html">http://www.neuron.net/~pfly/duckapus.html</a><br/>             ...the debut pfly CD...</p></div><h3><a id=3986 href="#3986">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;

actually, i think it&apos;s mentioned in the online ben johnston<br/>&gt; interview . . .</p><p>. . . well, i couldn&apos;t find it, but i also remember some piece that<br/>carl lumma played for me, off the just intonation network disc or<br/>something like that, where the comma was used as a structural<br/>feature -- in other words, progressions were deliberately constructed<br/>so that certain melodic pitches naturally ended up moving by a comma.</p><p>both deliberate comma shifts and deliberate comma drifts can be<br/>aesthetically useful effects for the microtonal ji composer. the<br/>reason that john delaubenfels and others have advocated their<br/>elimination is that they are not working in the microtonal field per<br/>se at all -- rather, their goal is to render traditional, DIATONIC<br/>music as pure, strong, and painless as possible. as you say, pain can<br/>be very useful, and certainly non-diatonic elements are what interest<br/>most of us here. but the diatonic scale as a basic musical gestalt is<br/>indeed a powerful feature for much of the world&apos;s most beloved music,<br/>and for such purposes, preserving the scale&apos;s integrity (by avoiding<br/>comma shifts), purifying its harmony (by &quot;springing&quot; toward ji<br/>chords), and maintaining a steady pitch level on the long scale (by<br/>avoiding comma drifts) certainly seem desirable goals for, say, a<br/>string quartet, or a computer midi-retuning program.</p><p>if you are indeed going to make structural use of comma-sized<br/>intervals in your music, you should remain aware of the overall<br/>scalar gestalt you&apos;re projecting. comma-sized intervals can easily<br/>turn into &quot;oopses&quot; rather than &quot;scale steps&quot; if the music is not<br/>constructed to bring such small intervals into focus. julia werntz<br/>actually has some very interesting things to say about this<br/>under &quot;relativity of interval size . . .&quot; in the very good second<br/>part of her paper &quot;adding pitches . . .&quot; in PNM . . .</p></div><h3><a id=3988 href="#3988">ðŸ”—</a>judithconrad@...</h3><span>12/18/2002 3:26:59 PM</span><button style="float: right;
