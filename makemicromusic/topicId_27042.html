Feeling cantankerous tonight, were you? It was a fun, rowdy bit, a little obnoxious with a devil-may-care attitude.

The rough jam was just a jam, I know, so I wasn&apos;t looking for high musical quality, but I enjoyed hearing you making lumber talk. Remember the &quot;a fish and a grenade&quot; comment I made? I&apos;d go back and revise it to &quot;a block of wood and some wire&quot; if it didn&apos;t mean I wouldn&apos;t be exaggerating. The stick has a little bit of a twangy sound to it, somewhere not quite like a guitar and not quite like a banjo; maybe you should consider a country song in 11 EDO. &quot;The sticks&quot; is an expression that means &quot;the countryside&quot;, so it&apos;s even appropriate. And was that a little bit of The Violent Femmes, &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot;, maybe, at the end of the improv?</p><p>Also, congratulations on &quot;Free Sue&quot;. It&apos;s good and interesting, but not better than a lot of other things of yours I hear. I hope you take that to mean that your toss-offs are of award-winning quality. :) You seem to write quite differently from how you improvise; although the moods are totally different, &quot;Free Sue&quot; has a composition style more similar to &quot;Orwellian Cameras&quot; than it does to your guitar improvs -- I&apos;m not sure if I could precisely describe how, but at least there seems to be more emphasis on big chords and textures, that sort of thing.</p><p>18 looks like an interesting scale to work with: No good fourths or fifths, but lots of other excellent-to-passable approximations of simple ratios. It might be interesting to play with just to break my dependence on fourths and fifths, though I still have to find a way to use &gt;12-note scales.</p><p>Keep up the good work!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=27073 href="#27073">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2011 6:42:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jake,</p><p>Thanks for all of  the listens and kind comments!</p><p>You might be able to do 18 - 18 is 3 whole tone scales 1/3 of s semitone<br/>apart.

In fact, most<br/>likely your VSTi will accept multiple tracks on separate midi channels. So<br/>then the synchronization is automatic.</p><p>If you are thinking in csound score blocks then that is not a model that<br/>applies. The model I am describing is very much like reading a real<br/>orchestral score with each instrument being assigned a VSTi.</p><p>I agree it isn&apos;t as nice as having a VSTi that accepts microtonal tunings.<br/>But even those can be had for not much money.<br/><a href="http://www.12equalboresme.com/Synths/Synths.html">http://www.12equalboresme.com/Synths/Synths.html</a></p><p>There is one that is a jumble of letters to me - ZynAddSubFX-VDX_VST -  that<br/>is free.
