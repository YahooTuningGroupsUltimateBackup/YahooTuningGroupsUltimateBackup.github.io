The article was about the &quot;Disney-fication&quot; of the Times Square area, and I thought it could parallel recent discussions about whether &apos;modern&apos; music should continue, as well as what the point of stepping outside of 12-tET might be:</p><p>&quot;Every great city needs to have a fringe,&quot; he spits emphatically. &quot;A cultural fringe, a moral fringe, for a specific reason: So you can define the mainstream and the cutting edge of the avant-garde. If you haven&apos;t got that, there is nowhere for someone to come to rebel against the strictures that are laid down by the mainstream. Whether it&apos;s politics or drinking or New Age theater, there&apos;s gotta be a place that people can go that they feel they are out of the mainstream. Otherwise everybody drowns in a cultural swamp.&quot;</p><p>Regards,<br/>Mom</p></div>
