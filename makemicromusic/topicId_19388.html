A rule in the arts -- for example, a rule in counterpoint or harmony -- is an observation from practice formulated for the reproduction of known quantities and thus not innovative, but rather a point of departure for innovation.  It is like a recipe in a cookbook, showing how a particular effect is achieved.  Now, it may well be the case that poor teachers give the impression that an innovation in a recipe is a violation of the social contract, like breaking a rule in an etiquette book or worse, but it is often also the case that students fail to recognize that the techniques being taught are a reasonable and time-tested way of replicating aspects of known musical repertoire. I&apos;ve ran into too many students too count who have become ex-students of music because they felt unduly constrained in their creativity by having to jump through the hoops of harmony and counterpoint exercises.  But those hoops have much to recommend themselves precisely because they are exercises, taken out of the high pressure zone in which innovation and creative are expected, and within which any evaluation, say an A,B,C,D,F grade, on a work of art is a highly subjective and often meaningless act.  Music history, for which I hesitate to use a term like evolve, does change over time through innovations, both large and small, but the recognition that a new work is innovative depends entirely on its relationship to known music. Recipes work in the same ways: ingredients and methods mutate, recombine, and change constantly, but always against the background of the familiar to which it can be compared positively or negatively.  An innovation in etiquette, however, can only be understood by someone who buys into the whole project of &quot;good behavior&quot; as a form of devolution.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2008 12:06:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Sorry to disagree Jon...</p><p>Please don&apos;t apologize for disagreeing, as this is the only way we<br/>learn.
