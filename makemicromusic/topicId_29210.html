Follow the enharmonics correctly.<br/>Though in 17tet the major third gets a somewhat dissonant character with<br/>many timbres, you&apos;ll have to accept this if you wish to use major thirds.<br/>You will find though that using augmented primes etc in melodies<br/>requires a bit of a study since we&apos;re so used to using minor seconds in<br/>western music.<br/>For an example play the simple scale C-C#-E-G-G#-C and you will find the<br/>stable chords at C-E-G and C#-E-G#, extended chords are for instance<br/>C#-E-G-C or inversions of it, C-E-G#, etc.<br/>If you harmonize it as such it will retain the feel, in fact highten the<br/>&quot;arabic&quot; feel and not destroy it as in your example below. You can<br/>change the E to an F in the scale and if you continue to harmonize it<br/>correctly according to the enharmonics it will retain the feel.<br/>If you harmonize it wrongly, for instance see it as C-Db-F-G-Ab-C and<br/>play C-F-Ab or Db-F-Ab or Db-F-C etc then the whole arabic feel is<br/>destroyed as you will have indicated a Db and Ab instead of a C# and G#.<br/>You CAN use intervals like C-Fb but then you must use the Fb as a<br/>nonchord tone (in other words, it must not indicate a stable major third<br/>but instead be something like for instance a passing tone)</p><p>Classical counterpoint is of much less concern than harmony, and in fact<br/>parallel fifths will work very well for arabic sounding music.

Most people around these lists seem to lack this.<br/>Yes to harmonize Rast with only the notes from the scale is indeed<br/>limited, and only one place for a major triad and one for minor triad.<br/>It can be done though and can resemble Georgian polyphonic music then.<br/>But one does not have to limit oneselve to only notes of the scale, feel<br/>free to put any stable chord (in other words, the ones you can play in<br/>12tet) on any of the scale steps.<br/>Also one can play for instance C-E-G chord and have a melody above that<br/>be in C Rast and hit a Gbbb (which is very roughly a quarter note below<br/>E) as long as its used as a nonchord tone as I explained before (so it<br/>has to eventually resolve to a note that harmonizes with the C-E-G<br/>chord, or the C-E-G chord has to change to harmonize with the Gbbb).<br/>To keep in mind here one has to have the individual melodies that make<br/>up the total harmonies make sense. One can&apos;t just randomly jump around,<br/>all melodic phrases have to follow a certain scale / logic of course,<br/>but one has to think this out even more so than in western classical<br/>music because the structure is more complex and one can do nonsensical<br/>things more easily (or to put it differently in 12tet one has much more<br/>possibility to even accidentally do something musically sensible).<br/>I&apos;ll post a few examples soon.<br/>Good luck!</p><p>Btw, I think that with 29 tone Pythagorean one can do almost everything<br/>in this area. (with some exceptions though)<br/>But I find that a lot of notes as well. What I do is first figure out<br/>which notes I&apos;ll actually use in harmonizing a makam, and then make the<br/>scale. For harmonizing makam Rast I&apos;m using a 14 tone scale right now.<br/>And if I want to go outside this then I simply make a new scale. Up till<br/>18 notes is somewhat playable on a normal keyboard.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel de Velde</p><p>&gt; Thanks for your feedback.
