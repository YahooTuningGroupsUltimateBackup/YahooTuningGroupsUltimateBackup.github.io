Also, I&apos;d like to<br/>find a good site for a general archive of my music (composed or<br/>improvised) in ogg and mp3 formats, and would prefer a policy of<br/>making pieces available in both formats. There have been some helpful<br/>posts on this topic of sites for making audio files generally<br/>available, and I&apos;d welcome more discussion and advice on this (I&apos;ve<br/>also had some helpful discussions offline).</p><p>One question raised by my General MIDI instrumentation is the nature<br/>of default MIDI-based string timbres, which I find add diversity to<br/>the consort of sounds (with contrasting timbres helping to<br/>differentate the melodic layers), but without closely emulating the<br/>variations characteristic of acoustical string playing.</p><p>Here 29-EDO is a kind of modern variation on medieval Pythagorean<br/>tuning, the &quot;historically correct&quot; intonation for this kind of style.<br/>The genre might be described as conductus, with the voices often<br/>moving together in more or less note-against-note style; three-voice<br/>textures in this genre are common around 1200, with a range of modern<br/>performance interpretations. During my youth, ensembles mixing voices<br/>with contrasting instrumental timbres for different lines were often<br/>favored; over the last three decades, performances by voices alone<br/>have come more into vogue.</p><p>Please let me express many thanks to those of you here and elsewhere<br/>who have helped to get me to this point.</p><p>In view of Aaron Johnson&apos;s special role in facilitating my adventures<br/>with Linux, I would like warmly to dedicate this modest version of my<br/>piece to Aaron, his wife Lorna, and his grandfather Clarence -- with<br/>many thanks.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=8491 href="#8491">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2005 10:53:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone, and I&apos;d like briefly to comment on the &quot;22-EDO<br/>keyboard&quot; discussion: it might suggest &quot;different folks, different<br/>styles, different keyboards&quot; -- whatever the connections.</p><p>I&apos;m hesitant to get very deeply into this discussion without posting<br/>some music played on the keyboard layout I&apos;m describing, for better or<br/>worse &lt;grin&gt;.

This new piece feels sweeter and more<br/>&gt; supple than Librar22, which I also enjoy.
