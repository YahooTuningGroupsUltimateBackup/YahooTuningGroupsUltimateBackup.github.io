Both are improvisations that I sort<br/>of found at the keyboard, and I&apos;d agree that the first has a more<br/>&quot;ambiguous&quot; or fluid structure; I&apos;d like to record some longer<br/>versions, also taking up Harold&apos;s suggestion of comparing different<br/>tunings (JI, as here, or otherwise).</p><p>&gt; Listening to these, it just occurs to me that the music of the group<br/>&gt; Other Music had significant similarities to medieval/ renaissance<br/>&gt; music.

I&apos;ve just been<br/>getting into this side of things over the last few months with the<br/>Zephyr 24 tuning, and hope soon to post some improvisations in this<br/>kind of style.</p><p>A final comment for now on the stylistic connection you&apos;ve drawn:<br/>maybe this improvisation, in a kind of 13th-century European style,<br/>has a certain affinity with gamelan because we have interweaving<br/>melodies often gently oscillating back and forth. Maybe doing this<br/>kind of thing in a JI gamelan kind of timbre/tuning tends to<br/>accentuate this resemblance.</p><p>Aaron:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for these, they were very enjoyable. I like the use of<br/>&gt; &quot;anachronistic&quot; dissonance in particular (like at 0&apos;11&quot; and 0&apos;20&quot;)<br/>&gt; in the second track. These cadential thirds are of what size?</p><p>Thanks for the composerly feedback, and your timings suggest to me<br/>that these are indeed the special &quot;stretched&quot; cadential major thirds<br/>and sixths, which _can_ sound very avant-garde today also.</p><p>The sizes of these cadential thirds and sixths are around 450 and 948<br/>cents, approximating to a cent or so those suggested in a monochord<br/>interpretation of Marchettus suggested by Jay Rahn, &quot;Practical Aspects<br/>of Marchetto&apos;s Tuning,&quot; _Music Theory Online_ 4.6 (1998),<br/>&lt;<a href="http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/issues/mto.98.4.6/mto.98.4.6.rahn.html">http://boethius.music.ucsb.edu/mto/issues/mto.98.4.6/mto.98.4.6.rahn.html</a>&gt;</p><p>In this JI reading, based on the division of a 9:8 tone into five<br/>_unequal_ intervals 81-79-77-76-74-72, the last and largest ratio of<br/>74:72 or 37:36 serves as a guide for the cadential diesis, ~47.43 cents.<br/>Then we have special wide major thirds and sixths at 48:37 (~450.611<br/>cents) and 64:37 (~948.656 cents).</p><p>In the JI tuning for my improvisation, interval sizes vary slightly<br/>from these: a cadential diesis at 114688:111537 (~48.23 cents), and<br/>wide major thirds and sixths at 37179:28672 (~449.915 cents) and<br/>12393:7168 (~947.860 cents).</p><p>These slight divergences of about 0.80 cents result from an indeed<br/>&quot;anachronistic&quot; or _neo_-medieval item on my agenda: spacing the two<br/>Pythagorean 12-note chains so as to obtain some pure supraminor and<br/>submajor thirds at my beloved ratios of 17:14 (~336.13 cents) and<br/>21:17 (~365.83 cents). This spacing at 459:448 or about 41.99 cents is<br/>happily very close to the 1024:999 or about 42.79 cents required for<br/>Rahn&apos;s ratios for cadential major thirds and sixths and dieses.</p><p>Dave:</p><p>&gt; Both are very nice, I particularly like the cadences (especially the<br/>&gt; unresolved one early on) in the second piece.</p><p>Thank you for this feedback. The unresolved or &quot;interrupted&quot; cadence<br/>is definitely a calculated technique, and one that the two of us both<br/>like -- but see Harold&apos;s interesting discussion below for an<br/>indication that people&apos;s mileage can vary.</p><p>&gt; Do you have some longer pieces online somewhere?</p><p>This is what I want to do: more and longer keyboard recordings of<br/>compositions and improvisations, including historical pieces as well<br/>as original ones. Right now a place I&apos;m starting to use is:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/</a>&gt;</p><p>Harold:</p><p>&gt; That Zephyr bit really has a catchy tune!

Got some<br/>&gt; digital crumhorns?</p><p>Thank you for the encouragement, and indeed I&apos;d like to record a<br/>longer version. Frankly, part of my mood for this first mp3 version<br/>was: &quot;Let me just get through this without any glaring slips of the<br/>keyboard,&quot; since normally this is an improvisation that I&apos;d play a lot<br/>longer if it were just for me or a visitor.</p><p>Of course, as your comments suggest, developing my musicianship should<br/>be a major part of this: both technique and confidence. The computer<br/>recording is a great way to add motivation while providing ready<br/>feedback.</p><p>As to the digital crumhorns, I do have a patch (actually a preset, A22<br/>on the Yahama TX802) that I use as a kind of &quot;crumhorn&quot; or &quot;regal<br/>organ&quot; sound, and I should be posting things using this soon.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;ve downloaded your Ars Subtilior and Renaissance pieces<br/>recorded with the TX802, and look forward to hearing them -- and maybe<br/>getting a hint or two about neat timbres. In another post, I&apos;ll<br/>respond to some of your historical tuning questions, but right now I<br/>want to say thank you for this music!</p><p>&gt; In both cases, as in the other music I&apos;ve heard from you, you&apos;re of<br/>&gt; course putting the 3rds and 6ths be quite far off from their later,<br/>&gt; more euphonious frequency relations.
