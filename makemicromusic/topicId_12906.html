He blogged about it at:</p><p><a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/2006/04/odds_without_en.html">http://www.therestisnoise.com/2006/04/odds_without_en.html</a></p><p>Taking a cue from the not so seriousness with which we all take<br/>ourselves, he wrote:</p><p>&quot;The results of Make Microtonal Music Day 2006 are available at Bumper<br/>Music ( <a href="http://bumpermusic.blogspot.com/">http://bumpermusic.blogspot.com/</a> ). The blog-borne festival<br/>describes itself, not too seriously, as &quot;Black History Month for<br/>Microtonality.&quot; A few highlights: Yahya Abdal-Aziz&apos;s Bunga Seroja,<br/>Jeff Harrington&apos;s Spirale d&apos;Arco, and Gene Ward Smith&apos;s Dreyfus<br/>(inspired by Chief Inspector Dreyfus&apos;s mad organ performance at the<br/>climax of The Pink Panther Strikes Again). If you&apos;re hungry for more,<br/>go to Smith&apos;s site ( <a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/gene.html">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/gene.html</a> ) and<br/>listen to Threnody for the Victims of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. O dem<br/>composers.&quot;</p><p>Alex is one of the most popular music bloggers, with a Technorati rank<br/>of: 3,883 (805 links from 320 sites). I emailed him the link, and the<br/>rest is history...</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div><h3><a id=12911 href="#12911">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2006 1:10:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Prent,</p><p>I assume that we can now take a print-out of Alex&apos;s blog into a local Starbucks and receive a free Vente beverage of our choice, right? :) Anyhow, good call on hooking up with Alex, one of the finest writers in the blog-o-sphere (and in print, for that matter).

But<br/>it did give me an opportunity to tell one more person about microtonal<br/>music.</p><p>What we need to do now is duplicate what my uncle John Rodgers did<br/>back in the 1950&apos;s. He got together with his geologist colleagues and<br/>named 1957 the &quot;International Geophysical Year&quot;. They mobilized<br/>scientists around the world to trek up mountains, visit the north and<br/>south poles, measure everything, and report back. Sputnik was the 1957<br/>Russian contribution, and we all know what that lead to. It was a<br/>tremendous success, and they did the same thing every year thereafter<br/>through 1962. Each year was an &quot;International Geophysical Year&quot;. It<br/>really jump started the field.</p><p>I say we declare next year *International Microtonal Year*. Get people<br/>from all over the world to participate. Get some university to kick in<br/>their good name. Get the National Bureau of Standards to declare that<br/>all divisions of the octave are of equal value, including non-equal<br/>and non-octave. Create five Working Groups and thirteen Technical<br/>Panels and a free drink for all composers at every coffee house on the<br/>planet. And more music!</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Prent,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I assume that we can now take a print-out of Alex&apos;s blog into a<br/>local Starbucks and receive a free Vente beverage of our choice, right? :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div>
