One intent of the internal tunings is to<br/>enable users to share patches that have a common baseline. It also is<br/>great for trouble shooting should the user change the directory structure<br/>(i.e. tuning file not found). It is fun for the user to have an instrument that<br/>is flexible instantly without having to do any work to assemble their own<br/>tuning library, especially if they are new to the concept.</p><p>The custom tuning file(s) are read when a patch loads. This involves a bit<br/>of computation. Once the patch loads the tuning system takes minimal<br/>CPU while the instrument plays. The internal preset tunings are already<br/>computed, thus instantly available with no CPU hit.</p><p>Also, the system has a feature to instantly glide holding notes to the<br/>new tuning when a tuning change occurs. Optionally the user can set<br/>this feature to &apos;wait until next note&apos;, such that holding notes linger at the<br/>pitch of the tuning they were triggered with. The internal tunings broaden<br/>the selection and ability to change intonation in the middle of<br/>performance at a moments whim.</p><p>The product is virtually ready to go to market now. With the exception of<br/>completing the internal tunings, an extra feature or two, and some<br/>documentation, the project is complete.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>David</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;It is a collection of different VSTis for the Wintel platform consisting of<br/>&gt; &gt;sample players and synthesizers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Excellent.

However, at this time the specification is not fully<br/>&gt; &gt;implemented in this instrument technology. Perhaps in the future it<br/>can<br/>&gt; &gt;be fully implemented.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully.  Especially the &apos;single note real time&apos; message in the<br/>&gt; tuning extensions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The best way to let them have that is with Scala file support.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The TUN file has an exact section where each of the 128 MIDI notes<br/>can<br/>&gt; &gt;be specified to about a trillionth of a cent. As well the file contains a<br/>&gt; &gt;fundamental frequency parameter. Scala can easily create TUN files.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;To create a TUN file from scala:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Send/File&#x9;&#x9;filename.tun<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, yeah.  TUN files aren&apos;t human-readable or human-writable,<br/>&gt; is my gripe.  The instrument should have a front-panel control<br/>&gt; for fundamental frequency.  It should also be able to handle &gt; 128<br/>&gt; notes at a time, and fake this up over MIDI by using multiple<br/>&gt; channels, or something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; As for the general public, 19-tone equal temperament is, in my<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; opinion, the most important tuning.  Early music folks will want<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 12-tone subsets of 1/4-comma meantone (close to 31-equal) and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 1/5- and 1/6-comma well temperaments (like Werckmeister 3 and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Young).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Great, given I was one of the two engineers who put 19TET and other<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning capabilities into the EMU family of synthesizers, I can easily<br/>&gt; &gt;do this. Also I&apos;ll put the other tunings you request in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That was you?  I&apos;ve heard stories that you existed.  And I used<br/>&gt; the 19-tET feature on a Proteus/2, back in &apos;97.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The tuning resolution of this technology is outstanding, it blows away<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;status quo. The tuning C++ code is highly portable. I imagine it will<br/>&gt; &gt;evolve and make it into numerous intstruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to take a cold shower.  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=14594 href="#14594">ðŸ”—</a>dar kone &#x3C;zarkorgon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2006 10:55:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Weird music scale tuning of 192 notes</p><p>  Used Scala to create a musical scale of 192 notes.
