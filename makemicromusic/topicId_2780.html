I can burn a<br/>CD for those who hate spam from <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.</p><p>Here are some notes about the music, which also appear on the MP3<br/>page. The piece is based on a movement across the utonalities of the<br/>Partch Tonality Diamond. At each step, I play the otonalities of that<br/>tonality step.</p><p>The primary tonality is what I call D++, an 8:7 above the center of a<br/>tonality diamond based on C as 1:1. The song moves around the diamond<br/>by utonality steps in a kind of circle of chords, from D++ (8:7) to F<br/>(4:3) to A flat (8:5), C (1:1), G-- (16:11), to A# (16:9) and back to<br/>D++. If you voice the chords just right, you can go around this cycle<br/>three times and end up with a kind of chromatic scale that drops an<br/>octave; 18 steps from start to finish.</p><p>The song spends most of its time in D++ major otonality. The opening<br/>section uses a horn glissando on a triad 7:9:11 to the triad 8:10:12.<br/>The glide is gradual over a whole note. At the start of the glide,<br/>there is a prominent difference tone three octaves below the 9:11:14.<br/>At the end, the difference tone is one octave below the 10:12:16. I<br/>play around with shifting difference tones all throughout the piece,<br/>some more prominently than others.</p><p>The instruments used are trombones, tuba, flute, cello, violin,<br/>guitar, finger piano, and percussion. Bass gongs that glissando down<br/>appear at different times.</p><p>The title is taken from the South American native Jivaro warriors, who<br/>smeared themselves with blood and danced with the shrunken heads of<br/>their enemies dramatizing the killing. Tsantsa is the native word for<br/>shrunken head. Imagine hearing the trombone glissandos across the<br/>forest valley, the triumphant victory dance of revenge.</p><p>Set the riffmobile to triademonium, sit back and listen to the<br/>changes. Notice your head getting smaller?</p><p>The voicings of the chords are what make the circle of tonalities<br/>interesting. For example, to move through D++, F, Ab, C, G--, D++, I<br/>voice the D++ as 4:5:6, F as 3:4:5, Ab as 5:6:8, C as 4:5:6, G- as<br/>5:6:8, and D++ now as 3:4:5. Repeat the cycle with F as 5:6:8, Ab as<br/>4:5:6, C as 3:4:5, G- as 4:5:6, and D++ as 5:6:8. The third time,<br/>voice F as 4:5:6, Ab as 3:4:5, C as 5:6:8, and G- as 3:4:5, back to<br/>D++ as 4:5:6. This creates a descending chromatic-like scale on the<br/>high notes of the chords. I call them A+, A-, Ab, G, G--, F, Gb, F, E-<br/>-, E, D--, D, D++, C, C, C, B--, A#, back to A+, the 3:2 above D++.<br/>Notice that it doesn&apos;t really always descend. Sometimes I hang out at<br/>G- or C for a clean 4:5:6. Sometimes I include the 7:9:11 or its<br/>revoicing as 9:11:14, or 11:14:18. Sometimes there is a glissando<br/>from the lower number ratios to the higher or visa versa. Lots of<br/>activity at all times.</p><p>The rhythm is based on cycles of 2:4:6 or 4:6:2 or 6:2:4,<br/>imultaneously or opposed.</p><p>The sounds are all created using Csound and the McGill University<br/>Master Samples, plus some of my own for the finger piano. I use<br/>Csound to create the piece. The beauty of Csound for me is the<br/>ability to control every instrument&apos;s envelope individually for every<br/>note, including crescendo and decrescendo, and all the other<br/>musically relevant articulations that make a composition come alive.<br/>I also make use of the ability in Csound to move pitches around,<br/>through a function table to control glissando for every note,<br/>individually. Finally, Csound makes it possible to base the tuning on<br/>non-twelve-tone-to-the-octave tunings. In my case, Csound has allowed<br/>me to explore the Partch Tonality Diamond, for the past six years.<br/>There is no other way to make music for me.

It isn&apos;t simply a matter of using samples as the sound-starting point, but the fact that you use Csound to facilitate music that, if all things were equal, you would probably make in another way: by building acoustic instruments and playing live, or by having a good amount of tuned samples at your disposal and either playing live or sequencing.</p><p>Whatever, the music *always* comes across as something that you actually *hear*, and have then utilized the tool (Csound) to realize what you have heard/imagined. I find that a very impressive feat, considering the steps to that realization.</p><p>What I think would be wonderful, and I only took one brief stab at this, would be a very good midi sequence to .sco translator; many people on this list have used boxes (TX-81Z/802 and others) to make music of wide tuning varieties, but the timbral resources are limited. If I were to be able to &apos;mock-up&apos; a piece this way, have a good sample base, and at least get *started* by translating to Csound in a similar manner, I think many of the pieces composed by some around here (Joe P. comes to mind) would really blossom with the abilities that Csound can bring to bear.</p><p>This is primarily because, like your music, you have found a fairly personal path for making Csound do your bidding, one that most don&apos;t have the same mindset to tackle. But your end result is SO compelling that I long for, and if time comes available, that I would love to find a better path to using Csound as the final step in a compositional progress.</p><p>Ramble, ramble, ramble; you know you&apos;ve got deep fans around here, Prent!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2784 href="#2784">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2002 10:24:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;prentrodgers&quot; &lt;prentrodgers@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_2780.html#2780">/makemicromusic/topicId_2780.html#2780</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve made a new piece using the Partch Tonality Diamond, posted to<br/>&gt; <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, since this is &quot;real&quot; music, I think I&apos;ll talk about it<br/>*here* rather than on the &quot;theory&quot; list.</p><p>If anybody before had any objections of some of the use of repetition<br/>in some of the earlier CSOUND efforts by Prent Rodgers, they are<br/>surely &quot;laid to rest&quot; in this new piece.  CSOUND, by it&apos;s nature, of<br/>course, lends itself to this kind of algo approach; it&apos;s hard to get<br/>it to do *anything* otherwise.  I&apos;ve been pretty disapppointed, on<br/>the overall, by CSOUND efforts, as evidenced in the Boucher book and<br/>also on the mp3 CSOUND website.  I mean, I admire the fact that<br/>people can get CSOUND to make music, since I, myself, have had<br/>trouble with it, but the actual *quality* of the music still seems to<br/>be questionable.

Too much change to the point of<br/>&gt; alienation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tried them both. Music that repeats, and music that never<br/>&gt; repeats. Music that has polyrhythmic dense layers where meters<br/>change<br/>&gt; constantly, and on the other extreme, single voice music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can enjoy either of them if done well, and amuse myself privately<br/>&gt; with allot of stuff I&apos;ll likely never share in these forums.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems possible that Paul has some kind of ideal inner image of<br/>&gt; music which only he will be able to make manifest in the real<br/>world.<br/>&gt; He mentioned his &quot;inner music&quot; once, and made me eager to hear it.<br/>&gt; Hopefully I will one day. It&apos;s much easier to assume the judgement<br/>&gt; seat, than it&apos;ll ever be to dive into the challenges and treasures<br/>&gt; that microtonality presents to us.

That&apos;s just me though - hard to work<br/>&gt; up the goose-pimples over text for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tuning is about Music, Music is about Emotions, and Emotions are<br/>&gt; about People.

I don&apos;t think *anything* Prent has done is &quot;without variation&quot;, and even if it did, there are ways of &quot;undue repetition&quot; that facilitate other things. Much of the electronica and dance music, especially Euro-tech stuff, would easily fall into this category, but while it might fail to move &apos;composers&apos; and educated/academic ears, it completely and fully meets its demands to move (and on the dance floor, to boot!) a large populace.
