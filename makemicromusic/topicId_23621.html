I know absolutely nothing about him, where he lives, what he does etc.<br/>I am only responsible for the:<br/>music<br/>tunings<br/>science<br/>and mathematics folders.<br/>Everything else eg Jazz, Linux programming, history, biology, geology and sheet music was already there at my first sighting of this library.</p><p>If anyone has any stray PDFs which you think others might appreciate then you can send them to me via email attachment:<br/>robertthomasmartin(at)<a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a><br/>And I will try to arrange to have them transferred to the gfax library.<br/>This is something to think about considering the transitory nature of some internet sites which sometimes just disappear like a puff of smoke.</p></div>
