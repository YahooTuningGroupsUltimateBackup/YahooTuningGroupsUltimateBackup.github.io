However, I would like warmly to<br/>thank the members of this group for their technical and moral support<br/>through this curious episode of Internet glitches.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=6769 href="#6769">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2004 3:41:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Robert and everyone.</p><p>Thank you for calling my attention to something that I might otherwise<br/>have overlooked in the MIDI output from Scala&apos;s EXAMPLE command for my<br/>four-voice piece, since the system I use does not provide for actually<br/>hearing these files: a drone apparently not called for either by my<br/>composition or my coding. As you rightly suggested, this is a bug, not<br/>a feature of the piece.</p><p>To request help from anyone who might be interested in order to<br/>confirm that this is indeed a Scala issue rather than a coding error<br/>on my part, I&apos;m posting my Scala .seq files both for this version with<br/>two timbres, and for another version with a single timbre, as well as<br/>a score of the piece in PostScript (conversions to PDF or other<br/>formats warmly invited).</p><p>  &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminap.seq">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminap.seq</a>&gt; (two-timbre version&gt;<br/>  &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminaf.seq">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminaf.seq</a>&gt; (one-timbre version&gt;<br/>  &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminap.ps">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminap.ps</a>&gt;  (PostScript score)</p><p>Also, here&apos;s a MIDI of the one-timbre version that, when I proofread<br/>the text representation of the output from Scala with midi2txt, seems<br/>to avoid the glitch that you&apos;ve so helpfully reported, Robert:</p><p>  &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminaf.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/carminaf.mid</a>&gt; (one-timbre version&gt;</p><p>What seems to be happening is that, indeed as you have described, a<br/>&quot;drone&quot; is resulting when a note G3 in the tenor part at 7 seconds<br/>into the piece (the second minim or half note of the fourth measure in<br/>the score, since at this tempo each minim or half note takes a<br/>second), or 3360 Scala units (each quarter note or crotchet is 240,<br/>and each minim 480) gets a note on using MIDI channel 15, without a<br/>note off on this channel. Rather, the channel gets used again for a<br/>another note, which should be in a different timbre -- but without a<br/>note off for G3.</p><p>For these examples I used Scala 1.41 for MS-DOS, and I&apos;m not sure if<br/>versions for other platforms, especially more recent ones, might avoid<br/>this glitch.</p><p>Whether we&apos;re documenting a possible anomaly with Scala 1.41 for DOS,<br/>or simply a glitch in my coding, thanks to you, Robert, and to anyone<br/>else who might assist in this process.</p><p>A musical aside: in the 1980&apos;s, I once played with a group where we<br/>decided to have me provide a drone on hurdy-gurdy for a 16th-century<br/>French chanson in four parts. My first reaction was that it would<br/>cause dissonances not precisely according to the standard rules of<br/>counterpoint, but in practice it was quite effective.</p><p>Here, however, the drone resulted from a glitch of some kind, although<br/>your remarks suggest it might make an interesting &quot;aleatory&quot; effect,<br/>something I&apos;d like to hear.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
