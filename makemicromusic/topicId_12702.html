Complaints about<br/>Kontakt&apos;s polyphony seem to come in three varieties: &quot;clipping,&quot; &quot;CPU<br/>overload,&quot; and &quot;disk access too slow.&quot; In all of them, the sound<br/>breaks up and distorts, and it&apos;s not always obvious which one is<br/>occurring. Clipping happens when the volumes of the individual sounds<br/>adds up to something louder than 0 db. It&apos;s easy to fix -- turn the<br/>volume of the instrument down, and then when they add together the bus<br/>no longer overloads. Try this first. One reason the sound breaks up is<br/>when the CPU isn&apos;t fast enough. This often happens when there are lots<br/>of effects applied, espcially the convolution reverb, which can\<br/>overload any CPU in short order. The fix is to remove (turn off) the<br/>effects and perhaps apply them later during mixing. The other reason<br/>the sound breaks up is that the access to the sample isn&apos;t fast<br/>enough. This occurs especially when using the direct from disk<br/>feature, and can be fixed by forcing Kontakt to load everything into<br/>RAM (assuming you&apos;ve got enough).</p><p>The final thing that causes the sound to break up is greed.

All the sounds<br/>are from the &quot;VSL Kontakt Orchestra&quot; though with the timbres mapped to<br/>match the tuning, which was done by LMSO (the &quot;X&quot; stands for 10-tet).<br/>I know from experience that if I tried to add too much more the sound<br/>would begin to break up. When this happens, the solution is to record<br/> some of the lines to disk (in my sequencer this is called &quot;freezing<br/>the virtual instrument&quot;) and then proceed. Using this approach you can<br/>get nearly unlimited polyphony.</p><p>As for LMSO vs. Scala: while they do overlap in some functions, they<br/>do differ. The similarities: both will generate scales, both will save<br/>to a variety of formats, both are written by dedicated people who have<br/>done a lot to make it easier to explore microtonality. Strengths of<br/>Scala: many analysis features, huge library, available on all<br/>platforms. Strengths of LMSO: easy to use with a large variety of<br/>synths and softsynths, great manual (clearly written and easy to<br/>follow). For my personal taste, I think of Scala as better for<br/>analysis and LMSO as better for performance. With specific reference<br/>to Kontakt support, both work by writing a Kontakt script file that<br/>can be added into any instrument. Scala&apos;s implementation is limited to<br/>a single scale at a time (I know -- I helped Manuel debug the Kontakt<br/>scripts). LMSO can have many tunings available instantly in a single<br/>script, and you can switch between them slickly and easily. It&apos;s<br/>biggest liability is that it is Mac-only.</p></div><h3>Bill Sethares &#x3C;sethares@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/30/2006 9:28:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The link in the previous post was incorrect.
