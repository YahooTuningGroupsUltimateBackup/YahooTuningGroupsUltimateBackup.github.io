I was able to download the<br/>manual for the Access Virus KC.  From previous experience I believed<br/>this did not have microtuning support.  The manual confirmed this.  No<br/>microtuning support is available.</p><p>While it is technically feasible to play single notes per MIDI channel<br/>and apply a pitch bend per note for microtonality, I recommend this only<br/>as a last resort.</p><p>In the category of analog modeling instruments with microtuning support,<br/>my web site lists the Korg Z1 as supporting a single full keyboard<br/>scale.  The Korg MS2000 and Triton with MOSS board also support a full<br/>keyboard scale, but note that these can only be tuned to +-100 cent<br/>offsets from a typical 12 TET, essentially limiting them to 12 note per<br/>octave scales.</p><p>There are also a number of software synthesizers with tuning support if<br/>you wish to go that route.  There are more options in that category.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p><p>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My main synthesizer has recently died, and I was looking at replacing<br/>it<br/>&gt; with an Access Virus C module.
