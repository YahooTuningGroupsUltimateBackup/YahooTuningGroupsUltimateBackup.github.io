Some day you&apos;ll have to share some of your knowledge of working with loops. I am currently hopelessly stuck in a pre-loops composing/improvising mode, and only an investment of time and money would bump me up into loop-based production. But you do it as well as the best of them.</p><p>I especially like some of the more open, jagged drum loops that occurred somewhere after the halfway point of the piece. You also seem to zero in on the &apos;floaty&apos; aspects of a tuning, where even when it seems somewhat consonance-centric, there is a very free movement up and down in the scalar structure. Or something.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m stoked, and I still say you excite the G-Force vis plugin in Winamp better than any other microtonal musician!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2002 12:41:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky -</p><p>It&apos;s nice to hear an exotic scale fully produced/sequenced/whatever.  Sounds<br/>sort of non-descript oriental arabian foreign intrigue kind of.</p><p>I don&apos;t want you to think I don&apos;t think much of this piece.  I just can&apos;t<br/>think of much to really say about it.

I<br/>imagine just the *sound* of it.... :)  Is it that fast drum stuff<br/>that comes in like a wave every now and then?</p><p>You know, I&apos;ve heard that done by several electronic musicians over<br/>on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, but I&apos;ve never heard that technique in Jacky&apos;s work<br/>before...</p><p>Jacky, is this a *new* technique for you??</p><p>What amazes me, to be perfectly frank, is the way Jacky varies the<br/>drums of the constant pulse so that it&apos;s constantly changing.  The<br/>drums have a varied articulation almost like jazz, yet the beat is<br/>completely regular.</p><p>&gt; Well, I&apos;m stoked, and I still say you excite the G-Force vis plugin<br/>in Winamp better than any other microtonal musician!<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Which plug-in is that (again?)  I remember having a discussion<br/>with Jacky, and he was saying how important he considered all the<br/>various &quot;Plug-Ins&quot; for the professional edition of Sound Forge.</p><p>Actually, I&apos;ll probably eventually go that route... and Sound Forge<br/>XP is so inexpensive (under $100) that it&apos;s good as a &quot;learning tool&quot;<br/>anyway... not a big waste of money, certainly.</p><p>It seemed, just structurally, that Jacky&apos;s piece maybe was going to<br/>continue on to a further section or development at some point??</p><p>Not a *criticism,* just a wish for more!  ...  :)</p><p>jp</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2002 9:48:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In honor of 22 tET Day, I&apos;ve just uploaded a new piece to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/22TechXture.mp3">http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/22TechXture.mp3</a></p><p>replied on the tuning list . . .</p><p>. . . fantastic!</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
