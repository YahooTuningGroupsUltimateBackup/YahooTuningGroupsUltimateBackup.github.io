This can be done</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; very easily in scala with the command &quot;equal 12&quot; followed by</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; the command &quot;quantize 22&quot;.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Personally.. .I find myself having to re-tune MIDI files when</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;switching tunings with anything more different than A) the same # of</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;notes per octave and B) very similar intervals</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; MIDI has no semantic representation of the music. It&apos;s just</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; note numbers from 1-128 (0-127 actually). Even in normal 12-ET</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; music, it doesn&apos;t know where the octaves are.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; -Carl</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>Yahoo!

For the 41-ET piece, it sounds like you picked something<br/>very close to 12-ET.  It&apos;s easier to do that in a larger tuning<br/>like 41 than it is in 19.

They, by the nature of things, are more sensitive to issues like tuning.
