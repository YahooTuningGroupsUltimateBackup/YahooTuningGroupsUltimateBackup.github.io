There are a lot of differences: differing synthesis methods, how cpu intensive they are, etc. CronoX, while it doesn&apos;t always sound like a complete killer on it&apos;s own, is modest in cost and resources, you can import samples and do a credible job of emulating sounds, and is fairly flexible. The LinPlug and Big Tick instruments supported the more robust .tun file format by virtue of lobbying/education from a couple of past/current MMM members, Jacky Ligon and Rick McGowan.

Please let me lend you every<br/>encouragement!</p><p>If there&apos;s any time when I&apos;m tempted to get into theoretical<br/>discussions on MMM, it&apos;s when someone has inquired about a tuning with<br/>which I&apos;m familiar and like, and which I consider greatly<br/>underappreciated. My purpose is to give enough information here to<br/>suggest that 29-EDO is a beautiful and resourceful tuning, inviting<br/>responses to my music here and discussions on compositional or<br/>improvisational theory on non12comp.</p><p>First of all, 29-EDO has fifths only about 1.49 cents from a pure 3:2,<br/>so it can serve as a mildly enhanced or &quot;brightened&quot; version of a<br/>classic Pythagorean tuning. Additionally, it has three attractive<br/>families of thirds and sixths, often approximating just ratios<br/>involving 11 (mentioned in this thread) and/or 13.</p><p>(1) Regular major thirds (10 steps) and minor thirds (7 steps), around<br/>    414 and 289 cents, very nicely approximate JI ratios of 33:26 and<br/>    13:11 -- one of my favorite regions for thirds, a general<br/>    neighborhood also including 14:11 and 33:28. You can hear these<br/>    thirds in both pieces. Like Pythagorean thirds, they tend to be<br/>    active, inviting resolutions to stable intervals like unisons or<br/>    the near-just fourths and fifths. The usual diatonic semitone of<br/>    two 29-EDO steps is around 83 cents, a bit more compact than in<br/>    Pythagorean, which makes for nicely defined melody and efficient<br/>    cadences.</p><p>(2) Semineutral or supraminor/submajor thirds of 8 steps (~331 cents)<br/>    and 9 steps (~372 cents) are close to just ratios of 63:52 and<br/>    26:21 -- you can hear an internal cadence using these thirds in<br/>    the piece for Mary Beth Ackerley. The cadence involves melodic<br/>    motion by a 3-step interval, about 124 cents -- not too far from<br/>    14:13, a kind of &quot;2/3-tone.&quot;</p><p>(3) Ultraminor/ultramajor thirds are _way cool_, and get used in the<br/>    piece for Mary Beth Ackerley; these intervals of 6 steps (~248<br/>    cents) and 11 steps (~455 cents) are very close to just ratios of<br/>    15:13 and 13:10, and often in my style cadence to stable intervals<br/>    with motions of a single 29-EDO or diesis, about 41 cents! The<br/>    ultramajor sixth -- or ultraminor seventh! -- at 23 steps (~952<br/>    cents) can serve as something like either a large 12:7 or a small<br/>    7:4 -- and yet delightfully different from either (and I say this<br/>    as someone with a taste pure 7-based intervals also).</p><p>Really, I&apos;d invite further discussion about the more theoretical side<br/>of composing or improvising in 29-EDO on non12comp; my concern is that<br/>I wouldn&apos;t want anyone curious about this fine temperament to get<br/>discouraged.</p><p>By the way, there are some articles about 29-EDO available on the Web:<br/>check the Tuning List archives (or try a Web search with &quot;+29-tET<br/>+diesis&quot;).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
