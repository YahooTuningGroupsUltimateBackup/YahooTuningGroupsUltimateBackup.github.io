The other two were the<br/>trombone and electronics piece and the solo electronic piece.  This<br/>one beats them all.</p><p>I&apos;ll be interested whether anyone *else* feels this way, or whether<br/>it is one of my &quot;furious delusions...&quot; (and I&apos;m perfectly sober...)</p><p>I&apos;m transcribing it now, but there&apos;s lots of other things to do, so I<br/>have to work fast.  Should have it up for listening soon!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
