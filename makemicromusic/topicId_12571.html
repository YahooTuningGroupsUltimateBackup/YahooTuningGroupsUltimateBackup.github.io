For a realistic organ sound, you&apos;ll probably want to separate the left hand, right hand, and pedal parts, and use a different registration for each part (with the hands occasionally switching out from one manual to another). But the articulation should make a big difference; some notes can be overlapped slightly to produce a legato effect, while other notes can be kept apart with brief pauses between the notes as the notes aren&apos;t always held to their full durations.</p><p>&gt; The sound space is so<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;uniform, with the same volume, number of notes, rate of change,<br/>&gt;&gt;timbre, reverb, envelope, and method of movement, that the ear turns<br/>&gt;&gt;it off as noise.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking of it as sound you bathe in; wear earphones and sink<br/>&gt; into the texture and it&apos;s like bells peeling.

You seem to be describing<br/>&gt;Ambisonic B-format.</p><p>Hmm, very interesting.  I hadn&apos;t heard of it.</p><p>&gt;But the reverb emulates the room the recording was made in,<br/>&gt;and so it should be part of the recording.</p><p>First off, electric instruments like synths and guitars don&apos;t<br/>have any natural reverb.  Studios are designed to be dead, and<br/>even if you play them in a live space you&apos;re probably playing<br/>them through a directional speaker, which won&apos;t lead to any<br/>reverb you&apos;d want to keep (the exception would be, perhaps,<br/>using something like an Electrotap hemisphere or Bose cylindrical<br/>radiator).  They come into their own with clever production<br/>techniques -- which for me include very mild, high-quality<br/>reverb and creative mixing (treating stereo like an instrument,<br/>rather than an imager).  Guitarists wax poetic about their<br/>favorite combo amps, but to me they all just sound like s***<br/>in person.</p><p>Acoustic instruments are a different story.  But to my mind,<br/>recreating the space the recording was made in is a neat idea,<br/>but is ultimately confusing/disorientating.  If the room I hear<br/>and the room I see don&apos;t match... it&apos;s not cool.  I became<br/>aware of how much hearing has to do with the sensation of space<br/>around my body when I accidentally bludgeoned my ear drum with<br/>a q-tip in 2004.  It&apos;s like the difference between going to a<br/>concert, and having a concert in your house, I suppose.  Though<br/>I must say after reading about it that I&apos;d love to experience<br/>an Ambisonic recording sometime.  Maybe I would just have to<br/>close my eyes.</p><p>But I should think the reverb of the listening room would color<br/>the reverb in the recording.  Unless the speakers were highly<br/>directional (esp. headphones) OR one had detailed info about the<br/>listening room and corrected for it digitally OR if the listening<br/>room was dead.  Directional sources are problematic because they<br/>restrict the listener&apos;s position, or in the case of headphones,<br/>miss the HRTF, and in both cases fatigue the ears.</p><p>So to me, the very best that can be done is to have each<br/>instrument coming out of a dedicated point source in the<br/>listening space.  For stereo, either the creative mixing for<br/>electric music, or spaced omnis (at the width of the speakers)<br/>for acoustic.  Stereo images done with coincident techniques<br/>always sound artificial to me.</p><p>&gt;Equipment that emulated an ideal listening environment for<br/>&gt;headphones would be nice, certainly.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s basically binaural recording with a fake head.<br/>The fake head fakes up the HRTF, but I find this kind of<br/>listening very fatiguing (something about sound being<br/>blasted directly in the ears... these do help, but not<br/>completely</p><p><a href="http://ultrasone.com/">http://ultrasone.com/</a></p><p>...) and it doesn&apos;t produce good results through speakers.</p><p>&gt;&gt; With electric music, some very mild convolution reverb is<br/>&gt;&gt; usually better than none; of course reverb should never be<br/>&gt;&gt; applied to acoustic recordings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Of course?  Do you really mean acoustic recordings, or<br/>&gt;recordings of acoustic instruments?</p><p>The latter.</p><p>&gt;  And how about dub?</p><p>That&apos;s a special case.  The effects are being used like<br/>instruments.</p><p>&gt;Reverb&apos;s generally more microtonal-friendly than chorus but you<br/>&gt;have to be careful with polyphony.</p><p>Oh, chorus should never be used for any reason IMO.<br/>I&apos;ve always hated it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
