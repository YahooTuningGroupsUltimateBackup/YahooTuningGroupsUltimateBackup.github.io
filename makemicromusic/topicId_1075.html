We wrote it a while back as a<br/>satire of our friend Dan Winters, who some of you may also know.  He<br/>is the original Phi Fanatic who has based his own fantastic &quot;theory<br/>of Everything&quot; on phi recursion.</p><p>Over the years I&apos;ve become quite fond of the lyrics and wanted to<br/>upgrade the version we originally did.  So we have been<br/>collaborating, always an interesting exercise :-)</p><p>The music of course is courtesy of the Beatles.  This is not the<br/>final mastered version, but it is it for this weekend :-)</p><p><a href="http://208.233.94.147/Dodecadan.html">http://208.233.94.147/Dodecadan.html</a></p><p>Mary</p></div>
