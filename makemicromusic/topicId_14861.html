Between<br/>each piece I am holding up a photograph of the composer that most of<br/>the audience isn&apos;t able to see, either.</p><p>Program notes, once again:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17tppp2.pdf">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17tppp2.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Sadly, out of the 60 or so that came to the event, only 25 had program<br/>notes. They were in the dark in more ways than one. Nevertheless<br/>seemingly positive response.</p><p>State of the Project: The pianos should remain tuned to 17 (more or<br/>less) for the rest of this year on into spring 2007.  There will<br/>probably not be a concert as early as January because I just realized<br/>I have a senior recital to worry about.  If there is another concert<br/>(let&apos;s call it Phase Three) it will be focused on longer, more<br/>in-depth works (less of a whirlwind variety show), and also maybe some<br/>chamber music (start dreaming and scheming!).  Ideally this music will<br/>be prepared more ahead of time, and we&apos;ll get matching pianos.</p><p>In the meantime (let&apos;s call it Phase Two-and-a-half), I will happily<br/>act as 17 tone piano consultant and will record readings of any short<br/>pieces or tentative excerpts you may offer.</p><p>I am also interested in learning from this project how to best have a<br/>project like this. Shall there be more projects like this? How could<br/>this have gone better? I only basically advertised the call for scores<br/>to the swarm of internet microheads and my own friends.</p><p>What do you think of the two-piano constraint? Interesting or<br/>distracting to the tuning and the music? Enforced hocketing is an<br/>unusual technical challenge for most pianists. I myself am most proud<br/>of the 32nd notes that we were able to alternate across two pianos in<br/>Free Lancer. That and one perfect moment in Chris Bailey&apos;s Waltz.<br/>Should I have held out for a natively xenharmonic keyboard instrument?<br/>(rhetorical question)</p><p>-Jacob</p></div>
