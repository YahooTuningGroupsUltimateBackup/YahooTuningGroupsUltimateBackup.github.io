I suppose how one does that it measure the<br/>&gt; length of the string and then figure out the length for the smallest related<br/>&gt; interval you want and proceed from there. I need to consul Doty&apos;s and<br/>&gt; Foster&apos;s book as either or both probably has something to say about this. I<br/>&gt; have a nice wine cask box, zither pins, and a piece of hardwood for the<br/>&gt; zither pins and this sounds like a worthy project for that material.</p><p>Let&apos;s say that theoretically, you have a fretboard that goes all the<br/>way across the length of the string to the end, so you can put frets<br/>even right up next to the bridge.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say that you place 7 frets equally along the length of the<br/>string, so your string looks like this:</p><p>nut --&gt;|         |         |         |         |         |         |<br/>      |         |&lt;-- bridge</p><p>So since there are 7 frets, there are 8 positions, since the nut<br/>counts as a fret in and of itself. Anyway, if you finger the highest<br/>fret, you end up with a frequency that we&apos;ll call 1/1. The second<br/>highest fret means that you&apos;re playing a string with length twice as<br/>long as at the first highest fret, so since the length gets multiplied<br/>by 2, the frequency goes down by to. So now our pitches are</p><p>1/1 1/2</p><p>The next fret down is 3 * the length and 1/3 the frequency, etc. So<br/>you end up with pitches, by the end of this, corresponding to 1/1 1/2<br/>1/3 1/4 1/5 1/6 1/7 1/8. If you just choose to put frets only up to<br/>the halfway point of the string, you end up with just the bottom ones,<br/>so 1/4 1/5 1/6 1/7 1/8 only, relative to a 1/1 that you can&apos;t actually<br/>play.</p><p>One tuning you could do is to put 16 linearly equal divisions of the<br/>length of the string, and then just take the ones on the lower half<br/>that go up to the halfway point of the string. You&apos;d end up with the<br/>following series:</p><p>1/16 1/15 1/14 1/13 1/12 1/11 1/10 1/9 1/8</p><p>Or you could do the same with 32 equal divisions, which would give you<br/>a 16-note subharmonic scale from 1/16 -&gt; 1/32, etc.</p><p>&gt; Supposedly Sibelius can interpret scores but I&apos;m a bit miffed that &nbsp;I spent<br/>&gt; a fair amount of &nbsp;money for it and they were not clear it is a 32 bit only<br/>&gt; application - and the learning curve is quite steep despite many reviews<br/>&gt; saying it is less steep than Finale. - But that is another subject entirely.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll learn it eventually.</p><p>That&apos;s awful news.

For instance, I bought a midiman USB midisport 4x4 midi interface a<br/>bit back. The thing is built like a tank with a heavy metal case - it is<br/>meant to last. Seriously, I can use it to smash car windows and it would<br/>still would work. The problem was it took M-Audio over 2 years to write 64<br/>bit drivers for it.Without the 64bit drivers I couldn&apos;t use it and had to by<br/>another hardware midi interface in the interim. Now I got drivers for it -<br/>and 3 interfaces :-( But that is on Avid / M-Audio</p><p>The only programs that I have that will not run because of the programs<br/>itself are some old 16 bit programs. If you have some of these then there<br/>are two routes you can use to get the to run for free:</p><p>dosbox   which is amazing <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">http://www.dosbox.com/</a><br/>or virtualbox which is also amazing <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">http://www.virtualbox.org/</a></p><p>In fact I am typing to you in a virtual XP machine running inside my vista<br/>64 bit install using a USB wireless interface. My vista 64 quad core music<br/>computer don&apos;t go on the internet itself.</p><p>What I mention about Sibelius (now owned by Avid) is a matter of their poor<br/>programming. Pretty much all commercial VSTi come in 64 bit as well as 32<br/>bit now and with a sample set like Hollywood strings one instrument sample<br/>can require a gigabyte of ram. (the library is over 385 gig!) So after<br/>buying more ram to go to 8 gig and support hollywood strings finding out<br/>Sibelius couldn&apos;t take advantage of it, and that this fact was not readily<br/>apparent to me on their website, was a big disappointment. But that is not<br/>the fault of 64 bit windows. In fact Windows 7 64 bit is great - we have it<br/>on 2 machines here and it runs wonderfully.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Jan 31, 2011 at 12:10 AM, jsmith9624@... &lt;<br/>jsmith9624@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I said in an earlier post, my PC has bitten the big one recently.
