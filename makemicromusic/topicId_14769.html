Although if you have/need a very high-quality neck it may be different.  So who makes the alternate auto-tuning bridge for 12-EDO?</p><p>     Also, between JI and ET I agree there isn&apos;t a huge difference in error (for most intervals, it really doesn&apos;t matter) although some notes, like thirds, do stand out a bit to my ear at least.  My point, though, was to say microtonal doesn&apos;t mean less consonant, and the most obvious example seemed to be giving a microtonal scale that was actually more consonant, even if by very little.<br/>      In my mind the great thing in microtonallity is the gain in harmonic expression and hardcore enthusiasts, like you said, will easily give up consonance to get those extra degrees of expression...and indeed FM7, Absynth (indeed, lots of NI brand synths)...can manage that far.</p><p>     I guess my fear is that microtonal is in danger of becoming a self-indulgent art in many places where it really shouldn&apos;t have to be.   And that while the tonal expression is a major plus, dissonance often rides that out in people&apos;s minds...and why not have the best of both worlds and more musicians interested in microtonality to spur inspiration from?<br/>  .<br/>     I&apos;ve broadcasted microtonal music as a guest performer on KPFT in Texas several times but the avant-garde show they had to go bust do to lack of popularity...not that I don&apos;t love composing like this anyhow (or that I don&apos;t think more accomplished micro-tonal musicians could do better), but that I wish more of a voice was given to alternative-tuned music.</p><p>     Also, there are so many amazingly innovative musicians, particularly in jazz and electronica (esp. with respect to sound engineering and harmonic structure) already hooked on stretching tonality (BT, Leo Kottke, Joe Pass, Way Out West...just to name a very few).   And, frankly, it would be a thrill to hear their take on microtonality, not to mention less compulsive ones.</p><p>          The electronic moving frets idea is cool, but would probably be pretty hard<br/>to implement.

This would be done to make the sum of their dissonances not too far over that of a jazz chord, for example.  So the increase in tonal expression should be mostly maintained...the software could even have an adjustable factor for how much dissonance it would allow and thus how much shifting it would do to acheive harmony.</p><p>      And if you can think of a way to design a string or fret (or fretless?) neck that can be twisted in such a way to shape the overtones of each note so a musician can do that shaping at his/her own discretion...wow.</p><p>     I also agree with you that fretless seems to be the obvious way to go to acheive microtonallity...the problem in my mind is the coordination involved to play something like that with, say, Harry Partch&apos;s 43-note scale.  Whoever does that must have one hell of an ear.</p><p>    I&apos;m very interested in the microtonal fretted ethnic instruments you mention though.  What are they called?

Although if you have/need a very high-quality neck it may be different.  So who makes the alternate auto-tuning bridge for 12-EDO?<br/>&gt;    &gt;      Also, between JI and ET I agree there isn&apos;t a huge difference in error (for most intervals, it really doesn&apos;t matter) although some notes, like thirds, do stand out a bit to my ear at least.  My point, though, was to say microtonal doesn&apos;t mean less consonant, and the most obvious example seemed to be giving a microtonal scale that was actually more consonant, even if by very little.<br/>&gt;       In my mind the great thing in microtonallity is the gain in harmonic expression and hardcore enthusiasts, like you said, will easily give up consonance to get those extra degrees of expression...and indeed FM7, Absynth (indeed, lots of NI brand synths)...can manage that far.  &gt;    &gt;      I guess my fear is that microtonal is in danger of becoming a self-indulgent art in many places where it really shouldn&apos;t have to be.   And that while the tonal expression is a major plus, dissonance often rides that out in people&apos;s minds...and why not have the best of both worlds and more musicians interested in microtonality to spur inspiration from?  &gt;   .  &gt;      I&apos;ve broadcasted microtonal music as a guest performer on KPFT in Texas several times but the avant-garde show they had to go bust do to lack of popularity...not that I don&apos;t love composing like this anyhow (or that I don&apos;t think more accomplished micro-tonal musicians could do better), but that I wish more of a voice was given to alternative-tuned music.<br/>&gt;    &gt;      Also, there are so many amazingly innovative musicians, particularly in jazz and electronica (esp. with respect to sound engineering and harmonic structure) already hooked on stretching tonality (BT, Leo Kottke, Joe Pass, Way Out West...just to name a very few).   And, frankly, it would be a thrill to hear their take on microtonality, not to mention less compulsive ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           The electronic moving frets idea is cool, but would probably be pretty hard<br/>&gt; to implement. Mass production guitars aren&apos;t that expensive anyways, it&apos;d<br/>&gt; probably be less effort to just get more guitars built, unless you played in<br/>&gt; a whole lot of tunings. Then again, they do make an automatically tuning<br/>&gt; bridge for alternatate 12EDO tunings, but I have the feeling that moving<br/>&gt; frets individually is a harder task.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The adaptive synth idea is cool, and pretty practical. I think this might<br/>&gt; have already been done, even. Even then, personally, the primary attraction<br/>&gt; to alternate tunings for me and a lot of others isn&apos;t necessary improved<br/>&gt; consonance, but improved harmonic vocabulary, which this wouldn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; help with. Actually, now that I think of it, I know at the very least<br/>&gt; Native Instruments Absynth can do just this out of the box.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not really sure how important pop marketability is to microtonality.<br/>&gt; Certainly, I&apos;d like to see more rock/pop type type music explictly utilize<br/>&gt; different tunings, but any performer who cares enough to do so is going to<br/>&gt; be willing to put a little extra work into it. Also, for the majority of<br/>&gt; rock/pop, the tuning error of 12EDO doesn&apos;t usually jump out at me as being<br/>&gt; that big a deal. Maybe I&apos;m just tone deaf :).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          &gt;<br/>&gt;  &#x9;&#x9;<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>&gt;  Get on board.
