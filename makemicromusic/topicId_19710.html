It&apos;s also a good program for exploring the properties of different microtonal scales, comes in PC and Mac versions, and is free. Scala .scl files are close to being almost a de facto &quot;standard&quot; for representing tunings, and some synth software like rgc:audio z3ta+ (if you ever start looking into software synths) can even read .scl files directly. Scala has a number of different commands for listening to the notes of a scale in various combinations, so you can hear what a scale sounds like to get an idea of how you might use it in a composition. So that&apos;s what I&apos;d recommend as a good place to start.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2008 4:03:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jill Arroway wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all, this is my first post in this group, so I thought I should<br/>&gt; introduce myself and say hello.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m Jill Arroway.

So if you see a key<br/>&gt; you want to be C in the Interval Matrix, just count down the<br/>&gt; rows to get its degree number.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * You can undo the last change to the scale in memory by<br/>&gt; typing &quot;undo&quot; on the commandline strip.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * If you have a scale in just intonation, you can quantize<br/>&gt; it to any equal temperament by typing &quot;quantize [et]&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2008 12:48:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem with scala i have heard from others is that one<br/>&gt; does not know where to start.
