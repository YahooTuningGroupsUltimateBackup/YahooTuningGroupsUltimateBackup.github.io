Like that I<br/>wanted to do an hour&apos;s worth of material in 46-ET. I tend to get<br/>over-ambitious.</p><p>I don&apos;t really have anything worth publishing right now. I&apos;m not a<br/>particularly good composer, so I never bothered to get the proper<br/>tools until now. Once I&apos;ve learned how to use tonescape I&apos;ll probably<br/>start writing more. I&apos;m sorry for not having anything.</p><p>--Tristan<br/><a href="http://dolor-sit-amet.deviantart.com">http://dolor-sit-amet.deviantart.com</a></p></div>
