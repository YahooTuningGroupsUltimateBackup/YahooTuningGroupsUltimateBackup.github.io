For me at least,<br/>the blues kind of starts and stops with Robert Johnson (and a handful<br/>of contemporary Delta players).  Johnson played with a slide most or<br/>all of the time and his stuff is quite microtonal, as first pointed<br/>out to me by Joe Monzo.  Oh, and Johnson was very young when he was<br/>in his prime, so no old men crying about the past were involved. -Carl</p></div>
