I&apos;m so glad you enjoyed it.</p><p>Bela Bartok had a piece entitled &quot;Deux Chalumeaux&quot; (two chalumeaux)<br/>in Mikrokosmos (his book of piano studies), if I remember<br/>correctly.  Based on that, I had thought of it as an instrument like<br/>a recorder or end-blown flute.  However, ...</p><p>---</p><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:<br/>The chalumeau (pl. chalumeaux) is a wind instrument, the immediate<br/>ancestor of the clarinet. While the word was in use in French from<br/>the twelfth century to refer to various sorts of reed pipes, the<br/>specific instrument that became known as the chalumeau seems to have<br/>been developed in the late seventeenth century. It represents the<br/>link between the recorder and the clarinet, and is essentially a<br/>cylindrical bore recorder with the mouthpiece of a clarinet. Like<br/>the recorder, the instrument was built in families, from bass to<br/>sopranino. The chalumeau has a large repertoire in 18th century<br/>orchestral and chamber music. As the instrument developed through<br/>the 18th century, the terms chalumeau and clarinet were used<br/>interchangeably, with the usage of &quot;chalumeau&quot; dying out by the 19th.</p><p>The chalumeau and clarinet were two distinct instruments during the<br/>baroque period, although the clarinet quickly proved itself to be<br/>the more versatile of the two, leading to the demise of the<br/>chalumeau. The unusual acoustic properties of both instruments,<br/>consisting of a cylindrical bore closed at one end, result in the<br/>instrument overblowing at the twelfth, meaning that the upper<br/>register sounds one and a half octaves higher than the lower, unlike<br/>other woodwind instruments, which overblow at the octave. The<br/>chalumeau, with its two opposing keys to extend the range up to<br/>sound A and B, was in fact used only in its fundamental range,<br/>therefore having a compass of only slightly more than an octave.<br/>This limited range was overcome by building instruments in different<br/>keys, often F and C, and from sopranino down to bass.</p><p>The clarinet was developed from the chalumeau primarily by<br/>displacing the back key (speaker key) up towards the mouthpiece,<br/>where it produces B flat rather than B natural, but functions in<br/>addition as a register key, allowing the upper range to be easily<br/>sounded. Due to inherent acoustical limitations of the instrument,<br/>it could be constructed with either the upper or the lower range<br/>well tuned, but not both. ... etc, etc</p><p>---</p><p>From <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/17321/data/chlumeau.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/17321/data/chlumeau.html</a> -<br/>The chalumeau was developed from the recorder by adding a reed to<br/>the recorder.<br/>The chalumeau was first recorder to exist in Germany in 1687.<br/>The chalumeau belongs to the instrumental family called the<br/>woodwinds.<br/>The chalumeau&apos;s range is one octave. (*)<br/>The chalumeau is made from wood.<br/>The chalumeau is about eighteen inches long.</p><p>---</p><p>(*) Yes, but it can be overblown at the twelfth.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; On Behalf Of Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve finally taken the plunge of finding a site to host some of my<br/>music.<br/>&gt; Take a look at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.esnips.com/web/yahyas-music">http://www.esnips.com/web/yahyas-music</a><br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=14654 href="#14654">ðŸ”—</a>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2006 3:46:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, aum wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is sunny day here again after long time.
