I just add this:</p><p>- It&apos;s not quite true that this type of bisonoric diatonic instrument is not used in European countries. In Czech Republic and Slovakia a diatonic type of small accordeon with button keyboard (melodeon) is still in use, especially in the hands of amateur, folklore musicians. It&apos;s called &quot;Heligonka&quot;, because unlike the other accordeons it has very strong bass tones (one octave lower) reminding a special type of bass tuba for marching bands (called Heligon), and because there are decorative small conic pipes for bass department reminding shape of brass instruments. As there are chromatic notes missing, the instrument can be used only for simple folk songs using diatonic major scale - that means mainly rather younger urban pseudo-folklore from 19. century, like polka and similar. Usually it&apos;s used as a solo instrument accompanying singing. You can hear it for example in some famous Prague beer pubs, and there are organized few festivals. Famous Czech producer was &quot;Hlavacek&quot; and between about 1880-1939 Bohemia was a main producer of all accordeon types in middle Europe.</p><p>- Origin of accordeon type reed instruments is in old China, until now they have an instrument called sheng (in Japan sho) - mouth reed organ with vertical bamboo pipes, which can even play six voice chords. In Japan it&apos;s used for ceremonial shinto music, and gagaku music. John Cage composed some pieces for sho, I have used it in my work &quot;Kenrokuen - garden of six principles&quot; written for orchestra of Japanese traditional instruments in 2004.</p><p>- BTW Chemnitz in Sachsen (Saxony) in East Germany was originally grounded and populated by Slavonic tribes, German name Chemnitz is derived from original Slavonic &quot;Kamenice&quot;, which means something done or build from stones (kamen = stone). There are more Kamenice in Czech Republic, so this one was called in Czech language &quot;Saska Kamenice&quot; (Saxony Kamenice). During socialistic experiment between 1949-1989 when Eastern part of Germany was called German Democratic Republic this city had a name Karl-Marx-Stadt (City of K.M.). After changes in 1989 and reuniting of Germany they returned to the old name.<br/>Traditionally this region, even on the opposite side of a border mountain Krusne Hory (Erzgebirge in German) in Czech Republic, is known as a region of manufacturing musical instruments - in the cities like Klingenthal (Germany) or Kraslice, Horice, Horovice (Czech Republic),</p><p>So I suppose your grandfather or grandgrandfather came from Europe, Saxony? Or other part of Germany? Accordeons are used a lot in German and generally middle European countries folklore music, of course also in France, Italy, Balcan countries, Russia, Ukraine, Baltic countries, Scandinavia... It&apos;s a pity that AFAIK nowadays there&apos;s no interest among young people in Czech Republic (and probably everywhere) to study this instrument at music schools - electronic keyboards destroyed this type of old culture and it slowly dies and disappears...</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 28 Aug 2010, at 9:52 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Howdy all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seemed like a good time to post this.
