If I know what you&apos;re talking about I agree.</p><p>&gt; How &apos;bout:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Henry Cow?<br/>&gt; Naked City?<br/>&gt; etc...etc...?</p><p>Just how old are you?  I thought maybe 20s or so but you&apos;ve got that<br/>Postponed Generation exposure.  Unless you had one of those much older<br/>brothers with 3000 pieces of vinyl.</p><p>Besides my abundant Kiss and Beatles upbringing, I studied a lot of Van Der<br/>Graaf Generator, Magma, Brand X, etc, basically anyone who ever played with<br/>Yes or Frank Zappa, and anyone who ever played with them, and anyone who<br/>ever played with *them* etc.   Last quarter century worth of British based<br/>jazz rock fusion.</p><p>I was actually in close touch with Allan Holdsworth for a couple years.  In<br/>between all the overwhelmed audience people trying to impress him with what<br/>strings they use, I just went up to him and started talking to him after an<br/>unpublicized show brought a few guys and their girlfriends, two football<br/>teams and a couple strays.  Maybe 20 people in the audience.  It WAS A<br/>COURTESY to clap at the end of long solos in a fusion piece.  No one else<br/>did.  He wasn&apos;t very receptive after the show and after a few mumbles I said<br/>HEY *I* was the one clapping, I know it was a bad show.  Influence,<br/>diversity, thank you etc got his number.</p><p>He knew how to talk, he knew how to listen, I felt like I was on the phone<br/>with him for hours but I&apos;d look at the bill, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, etc.<br/>Answered the phone Hello Marc one day.  Far before call waiting was<br/>invented.  I was calling often that week.</p><p>Well.  Like anyone else.  Just lost touch.</p><p>When I was 18, I was trying to get something going with people who were<br/>amazed that I could play Allan Holdsworth solos note for note by ear... I<br/>started losing them when I started playing HARMONIES over the fast parts...<br/>Very interesting that point in my life, where I was able to competently solo<br/>along with progressive rock and fusion albums.  Besides knowing the albums<br/>note for note I actually had a few different variations per piece I&apos;d work<br/>on.  This was a point where I had a very rich melodic and harmonic sense<br/>even though I was playing in 12.  I kept the alpha brainwaves stirred.</p><p>I suppose a little off topic but I suppose a little background.  Sentences.<br/>Fragmenting.  Need coffee.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>jacky_ligon &#x3C;jacky_ligon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 6:25:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Just how old are you?
