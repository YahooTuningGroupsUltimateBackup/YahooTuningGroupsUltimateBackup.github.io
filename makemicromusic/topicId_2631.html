I haven&apos;t worked with MTS at all and have no way to test/validate scale files I possibly could create.</p><p>I imagine that the real time formats will only work with the standalone FM7 since the VSTI version doesn&apos;t receive sysex.</p><p>Thanks again...<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
