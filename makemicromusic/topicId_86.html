This is an important topic, and I would say that there are<br/>fewer people who have unlimited amounts of time to do this than one<br/>might suspect.  I think there are *very* few people like that.  Most<br/>people have to balance composing in with other jobs... day jobs,<br/>teaching, whatever.  There really is only a limited time for it.</p><p>Even when I was in grad school, most of my &quot;day&quot; hours were spent<br/>studying for exams and so forth, so I have to say that almost all my<br/>composing for the last 30 years has been in the evenings.</p><p>Usually I spend a couple of hours each evening on it.  When working<br/>on larger projects, I must admit that I get a little &quot;obsessive&quot; and<br/>I have been known to do this two to three hour stint *every* evening<br/>of the week...</p><p>But then, I take breaks, too... there are concerts I have to attend,<br/>etc...</p><p>I watch *no* television.  I probably haven&apos;t turned one on for a<br/>year....  However, I *do* read the New York Times regularly... but I<br/>do that during lunch on my *day* job...</p><p>And... the Tunings Lists...  Well, I&apos;m like Kraig in that.  I do<br/>those, generally as little &quot;breaks&quot; from composing, etc.</p><p>Actually, I frankly don&apos;t believe it is too productive to compose<br/>more than two or three hours a day on the same piece.  One needs a<br/>bit of PERSPECTIVE.  I know for myself, when I come back to a piece<br/>on a second evening, it sounds sometimes ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY than it<br/>did the night before!</p><p>Things have to *sit* for a while before one really knows what&apos;s<br/>happening with them.  Some composing nights are better than others.<br/>Sometimes I have *tremendous* nights, sometimes just average, and,<br/>fortunately, only a few real &quot;losers.&quot;</p><p>Those evenings I spend *lots* of time on the Tuning Lists...  :)  :)</p><p>__________ _________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
