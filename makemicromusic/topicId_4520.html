But I don&apos;t think you said what it was<br/>- or did I miss it?</p><p>I enjoyed the site - the recordings of his playing, and his<br/>explanations. Must go back and hear more.</p><p>Some of the virtual instruments loaded okay here in Opera while others<br/>got stuck on the Loading screen, and none of them would load at all in IE<br/>5.something (which I&apos;m still using) - the window popped up but it just<br/>then waited for ages with nothing happening. I&apos;m on a 56 K connection<br/>and I wonder if it is to do with the connection speed?? Opera is supposed<br/>to be a bit faster than IE isn&apos;t it...</p><p>I may not have the most up to date version of Flash installed<br/>too perhaps.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
