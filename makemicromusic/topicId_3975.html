Well, in spite of their description of it as a 21st Century &apos;musical instrument&apos;, it really isn&apos;t - it takes a sound source input and applies effects to it.</p><p>As such, however, it really is pretty fun, and you can really do a wide range of things, from subtle to extremely wild. Would be a great piece of gear for a DJ or someone wanting to manipulate sound in some fashion. You should be able to go check one out at a Guitar Center or similarly well-equipped music store; when I saw it, they had it on a special display so you could play with it...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
