I will copy here a segment of my message there from Feb. 6 this year:</p><p>---------------------<br/>Of course a chord which follows harmonic series would be rather 13/11+, that one started to be used by Debussy, Scriabin and later overused in jazz even as ending chord. It&apos;s based on the Lydian/Mixolydian scale C - D - E - F# - G - A - Bb, which has a narrow connection with flute overblowing (and Scriabin&apos;s Prometheus chord!). Therefore we can find this scale in all cultures using flute as a main instrument, usually shepherd&apos;s music, in Europe it&apos;s for example Carpathian music from Bulgaria to Slovakia, South Poland and eastern Moravia where this type of musical culture ends (which was found and used by many composers - Bartok, Janacek especially, Haba, Killar - his Krzesany is an excellent example for this scale...). This &quot;natural harmonic&quot; scale has a name &quot;goralska&quot; or &quot;podhalanska&quot; tonality in High Tatra Mountains and it can be easily played on regional instrument - long flute called &quot;fujara&quot; and other flutes.</p><p>Long time composers were not aware of this, but when accordics has reached 13th in the middle of 19th century, and when composers started to be interested in folklore and were influenced by it, there were some composers who started not to use 13th chord in a traditional way (e.g. with omitted third and fifth, like for example Bb7maj on C bass - such chords were used by Chopin and Liszt), but with 11+, third and fifth to simulate harmonic series even in common 12 ET. It&apos;s interesting but not surprising that composers-pianists started with this, as they could find such &quot;nice sounding&quot; chords easily with pressed pedal. We can find such chords in Chopin, Liszt (maybe not intentional use, just as a color) and especially Debussy who was for sure aware of this.  Chopin used 7th and 9th chords in this way. Debussy has this in his Isle joyeuse (BTW I consider it as a great breakthrough work, there&apos;s a clear connection to harmonic series with Lydian 4th and Mixolydian 7th, it would sound great in JI) and other works. This line in music continued in Stravinskij, Janacek, Bartok, Messiaen, Killar, Reich and many others (not forget myself in more works).</p><p>But it&apos;s necessary to emphasize that it&apos;s only a simulation of harmonic series. I&apos;m not aware of any attempts from the side of those composers to use JI, nothing to say about jazz.</p><p>---------------------</p><p>:-)</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 9 Oct 2009, at 2:25 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So this is the burning question I&apos;ve had on my mind for some time now:<br/>&gt; when you listen to Debussy, you can clearly hear places in the music<br/>&gt; where 7-limit (and possibly beyond) harmonies are implied, even though<br/>&gt; he wrote for 12-tet.

We can find such chords in Chopin, Liszt<br/>&gt; (maybe not intentional use, just as a color) and especially Debussy<br/>&gt; who was for sure aware of this. Chopin used 7th and 9th chords in<br/>&gt; this way. Debussy has this in his Isle joyeuse (BTW I consider it as<br/>&gt; a great breakthrough work, there&apos;s a clear connection to harmonic<br/>&gt; series with Lydian 4th and Mixolydian 7th, it would sound great in<br/>&gt; JI) and other works. This line in music continued in Stravinskij,<br/>&gt; Janacek, Bartok, Messiaen, Killar, Reich and many others (not forget<br/>&gt; myself in more works).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it&apos;s necessary to emphasize that it&apos;s only a simulation of<br/>&gt; harmonic series.
