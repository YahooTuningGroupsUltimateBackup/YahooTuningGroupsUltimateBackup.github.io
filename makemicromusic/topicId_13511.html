But I do find it amazing that such a thing got past the usual channels of silent academic censorship (i.e. implicit assumptions).  Usually  there&apos;d be someone saying, &quot;yeah, but who will play this?  We can&apos;t just give an award to some MIDI realization?&quot;</p><p>And then yet another bland-ass string quartet (YABASQ) ends up winning.</p><p>Who were the judges?</p><p>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;  Did you just submit an mp3 file to the contest or what?</p><p>Well, it&apos;s funny. The contest was mainly judged on written scores. I<br/>had no score (had been planning something with Sagittal, never got<br/>around to it). The rules said that if the piece has an electronic<br/>component that&apos;s un-notatable, then a recording of that part could be<br/>sent. All-electronic pieces are technically allowed but rarely have<br/>won.  But I told them it was for (acoustic) microtonal player piano,<br/>which unfortunately doesn&apos;t exist yet.</p><p>But I had no score. (It was only suggested later to print out a piano<br/>roll type thing from a sequencer) So all they had to go on was a CD.</p></div>
