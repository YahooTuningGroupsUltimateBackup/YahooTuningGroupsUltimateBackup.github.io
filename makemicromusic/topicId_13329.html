Here I&apos;d like to<br/>document with a couple of mp3 snippets -- modest but not<br/>unproductive -- how Carl Lumma lent me a friendly goad in<br/>this direction.</p><p>Carl, we were having a discussion about my modified meantone<br/>or temperament extraordinaire, and related schemes, when you<br/>offered a comment that made me both reflect on musical<br/>limitations I tend to take for granted that others<br/>(including you) might not; and take to a bit of<br/>improvisation and composition to tell my side of the story.</p><p>Here&apos;s the creative goad, referring to temperaments like<br/>mine with eight fifths tempered as in Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>meantone, and the others equally wide -- first the Scala<br/>file, and then the goad:</p><p>! zarte84a.scl<br/>!<br/>Temperament extraordinaire, F-C# in Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma, other 5ths equally wide<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 25/24<br/> 191.62069<br/> 287.43104<br/> 383.24139<br/> 504.18965<br/> 574.86208<br/> 695.81035<br/> 779.05173<br/> 887.43104<br/> 995.81035<br/> 1079.05173<br/> 2/1</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a shame the approximate 9/7 doesn&apos;t occur in a mode with<br/>&gt; the good 7/4 in these tunings...  with a 7 present, I much less<br/>&gt; trouble using the 9/7.</p><p>Carl, certainly I agree that 9:7 is most effective as a<br/>usual major third when used in an environment with other<br/>congenial interval sizes, including 7:4 as well as 7:6 and<br/>12:7, etc.  The interesting question is what &quot;occur in a<br/>mode&quot; means here, and I suspect that we may each have our<br/>own meanings, semantic and musical.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I document how the near-9:7 and near-7:4 can from<br/>my perspective routinely occur in the same mode -- the spur<br/>to creativity here -- and then offer a friendly guess as to<br/>your meaning, Carl, inviting your feedback.</p><p>First, from my point of view, &quot;septimal harmony&quot; means<br/>mostly full or partial tetrads of 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24.<br/>The near-12:14:18:21 sonority Bb-Db-F-Ab or A#-C#-E#-G#,<br/>with my spelling varying with the mode or context, combines<br/>the best approximations of 7:6 (using both 275-cent minor<br/>thirds), 9:7 (using the one 434-cent major third), and 7:4<br/>(using one of three 983-cent minor sevenths).</p><p>Enough precompositional theory -- what to do musically? My<br/>creative strategy was to pick a mode which would have this<br/>fine tetrad -- and interesting subsets -- adjacent to the<br/>final or resting note of the mode. This led to a choice of<br/>C Phrygian or B Lydian, for reasons we&apos;ll hear and see<br/>shortly.</p><p>Having already composed a fauxbourdon piece in C Phrygian,<br/>I was certainly familiar with using the near-9:7 (Db-F) in<br/>an approximate 7:9:12 sonority (Db-F-Bb) expanding to a<br/>stable 2:3:4 on the final:</p><p>         Bb  C<br/>         F   G<br/>         Db  C</p><p>This is the first cadence in the following example, but<br/>devising the final cadence you&apos;ll hear was fun because it<br/>required innovating a bit on historical fauxbourdon, which<br/>tends to favor mildly unstable thirds and sixths but treat<br/>minor sevenths more demurely:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/CPhrygian97-74ex.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/CPhrygian97-74ex.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>What I realized is that it would be easy, and to my ears<br/>felicitous, to have a descending approach to a final cadence<br/>where we have a mildly unstable sonority of a third plus<br/>fifth above the lowest voice (C-Eb-G), expanding out to a<br/>tempered 12:14:18:21 (Bb-Db-F-Ab) that would then contract<br/>to a stable fifth on the final of the mode (C-G). Here C4 is<br/>middle C, and one might note free keyboard voicing expanding<br/>from three parts to four:</p><p>                       Ab4  G4<br/>C5       Bb   Ab4  G4  F4   G4<br/>G4       F4   Eb4      Db4  C4<br/>C4  Eb4  Db4  C4       Bb3  C4</p><p>Let me just add that, as we might expect in an unequal<br/>temperament, the near-septimal intervals mix congenially<br/>with others in a general Pythagorean-to-septimal range in<br/>this part of the circle. Thus Eb4-G4-C5 is 0-408-913 cents,<br/>not too far from Pythagorean, and C4-Eb4-Ab4 is 0-287-779<br/>cents, with the third between 13:11 and 33:28 and the sixth<br/>a bit narrow of 11:7. Mixing these kinds of colors is<br/>routine for me.</p><p>By the way, here&apos;s the earlier C Phrygian piece that also<br/>illustrates this type of mixture:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Now for B Lydian: I went for a three-voice discant style<br/>maybe typical of a classical conductus, or often mostly<br/>note-against-note setting. Here&apos;s the music:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/BLydian97-74ex.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/BLydian97-74ex.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>My theme was to highlight 9:7 in 14:18:21 and 7:9:12, as<br/>well as 7:4 in 4:6:7, with each featured in a cadence:</p><p>1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3 4 5 6  1 2 3 4   5  6   1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>1     2    | 1     2    | 1     2    | 1     2        | 1     2    ||<br/>B4    A#4    G#4   F#4    G#4   G#4    F#4   G#4 A#4    B4<br/>F#4   D#4    E#4   F#4    E#4   E#4    F#4   F#4 E#4    F#4<br/>B3    D#4    C#4   B3   , A#3   A#3    B     C#4        B3</p><p>Moving from the opening ~2:3:4 (~ meaning &quot;near&quot; or &quot;tempered&quot;), we<br/>come to a stable fifth D#-A#4 and then the ~14:18:21 at C#-E#-G#,<br/>resolving to the fifth B3-F#4 on the final with the ~9:7 nicely<br/>expanding to this fifth. Then we have the prominent ~4:6:7 at<br/>A#-E#-G#, with the outer seventh contracting to another fifth on the<br/>final and the upper ~7:6 third to a unison on the upper note of this<br/>resolving fifth. Then comes a kind of coda, one of my favorite<br/>cadences: from a mildly unstable ~6:8:9 (here with F#-G# at around 204<br/>cents virtually just, although one can hardly say this for the fifth<br/>or fourth!), the upper voices expand to the fourth of a sonority with<br/>an outer sixth and lower third -- here our ~7:9:12 at C#-E#-A#, then<br/>expanding to a ~2:3:4 on the final.</p><p>Of course, music is more than intonation: there are other things going<br/>on, such as the &quot;fifthing&quot; that often occurs between the outer voices<br/>moving together at this concordant interval while the middle voice<br/>proceeds in contrary motion, often alternating stable and unstable<br/>sonorities (as in the first two measures).</p><p>Also, while the ~9:7 third has its special charms, I would say that<br/>similar passages can be very effective also with the 408-cent or<br/>421-cent major thirds.</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve told my story, Carl, let me venture my first guess as to<br/>your point. Were you saying -- quite correctly, of course -- that we<br/>can&apos;t have both a ~9/7 and a ~7/4 _above the same note_, for example a<br/>drone on the final of a mode?</p><p>From one viewpoint, this is a logical limitation of a 12-note<br/>circulating temperament. Having both a 9/7 and a 7/4 above the same<br/>note means an interval of 64/49 or about 534 cents -- but in a<br/>circulating scheme of this kind, all fourths are within about seven<br/>cents of pure.</p><p>What might be more curious is that in many of my favorite just tunings<br/>as well as temperaments for 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 tetrads, I take<br/>it for granted that a note will often have one of these types<br/>available -- but not both for the same note.</p><p>Aaron Johnson encouraged me to explore a 2-3-7 JI system like a couple<br/>he has used designed by Gene Ward Smith, and there I was fascinated by<br/>intervals like 49:32 and 49:36. It&apos;s curious, however, how I take<br/>12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 as &quot;usual&quot; septimal harmony, with 4:6:7:9<br/>or the exquisite 16:21:24:28 (about which I learned from Keenan<br/>Pepper, and later from Kyle Gann that LaMonte Young was using in it<br/>the 1960&apos;s) as stimulating variations. The latter is a nice guarantee<br/>that I&apos;ll regard a 12-note circulating temperament, however<br/>attractive, as only _one_ solution, rather than _the one_ solution.</p><p>Nevertheless, Carl, my guess at your meaning (however accurate or<br/>otherwise) raises a more general question. Have I simply been taking<br/>for granted what you, as a versatile musician, can quickly recognize<br/>as a notable musical limitation?</p><p>Here I might reflect that I&apos;ve been playing and composing for not<br/>quite 40 years -- and for about the first 32 of those years, hardly<br/>even considered that there were things called &quot;neutral thirds.&quot; Now I<br/>recognize their absence as one of the serious limitations of any<br/>circulating 12-note tuning -- and also of almost any conventional<br/>historical 12-note European tuning scheme.</p><p>Each system indeed has its own patterns and resources -- but if I<br/>interpreted your remark about 9:7 and 7:4 correctly, it&apos;s curious how<br/>another person can reveal angles one hadn&apos;t fully considered, as well<br/>as in the process foster a bit of musical creativity.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=13335 href="#13335">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2006 3:38:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Carl, certainly I agree that 9:7 is most effective as a<br/>&gt; usual major third when used in an environment with other<br/>&gt; congenial interval sizes, including 7:4 as well as 7:6 and<br/>&gt; 12:7, etc.</p><p>The 9/7 becomes pure (which, since Keenan Pepper likes the word, I&apos;ll<br/>call an &quot;eigenmonzo&quot;) when the fifth is exactly 2^(5/8) 3^(-1/4)<br/>7^(1/8), at around 695.6 cents.
