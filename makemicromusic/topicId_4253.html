THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE<br/>YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY CORRESPONDENCE. I<br/>CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON<br/>TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE<br/>TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM<br/>CONFIDENCE.</p><p>I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR<br/>ASSISTANCE IN ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE<br/>REPUBLIC OF IRAQ. MY PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN<br/>COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY MY FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN<br/>ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED STATES<br/>OF AMERICA, AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED<br/>STATES CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.</p><p>IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN VICE-PRESIDENT<br/>OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES<br/>OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE<br/>SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. THIS UNSUCCESSFUL<br/>VENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A FALLING OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER, WHO<br/>SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING<br/>EMIRATE OF KUWAIT, A WHOLLY-OWNED U.S.-BRITISH SUBSIDIARY.</p><p>MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST<br/>OF SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($61,000,000,000). OUT OF THAT COST,<br/>THIRTY-SIX BILLION DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS<br/>PARTNERS IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF<br/>MONARCHIES, AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ($16,000,000,000) BY GERMAN<br/>AND JAPANESE PARTNERS. BUT MY FATHER&apos;S FORMER IRAQI BUSINESS PARTNER<br/>REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ITS PETROLEUM<br/>RESERVES.</p><p>MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING THE REMOVAL<br/>OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM<br/>ASSETS OF HIS COUNTRY, AS COMPENSATION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM<br/>FROM POWER. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO<br/>SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS UPCOMING PHASE<br/>MAY COST THE SUM OF 100 BILLION TO 200 BILLION DOLLARS<br/>($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), BOTH IN THE INITIAL ACQUISITION<br/>AND IN LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT.</p><p>WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO<br/>ACQUIRE THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ. THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND<br/>OUR COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE. OUR<br/>DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE<br/>SITTING VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD<br/>CHENEY, WHO IS AN ORIGINAL PARTNER IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD<br/>OF THE HALLIBURTON OIL COMPANY, AND CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE<br/>PROFESSIONAL DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE NAMING<br/>OF A CHEVRON OIL TANKER AFTER HER.</p><p>I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO TWENTY-FIVE<br/>PERCENT (10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS<br/>IMPORTANT VENTURE. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>OF AMERICA WILL FUNCTION AS OUR TRUSTED INTERMEDIARY. I PROPOSE THAT<br/>YOU MAKE THIS TRANSFER BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH OF<br/>APRIL.</p><p>I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE ANYONE<br/>APPREHENSIVE AND WORRIED. BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL<br/>AT THE END OF THE DAY. A BOLD STEP TAKEN SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I<br/>ASSURE YOU. PLEASE DO BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS<br/>100% LEGAL. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO CO-OPERATE IN THIS TRANSACTION,<br/>PLEASE CONTACT OUR INTERMEDIARY REPRESENTATIVES TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE<br/>MATTER.</p><p>I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT. MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES<br/>WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL. PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO THE<br/>CONTACT NUMBERS BELOW.</p><p>SINCERELY WITH WARM REGARDS,</p><p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH</p><p>Switchboard: 202.456.1414<br/>Comments: 202.456.1111<br/>Fax: 202.456.2461<br/>Email: &lt;mailto:president@...&gt;</p></div>
