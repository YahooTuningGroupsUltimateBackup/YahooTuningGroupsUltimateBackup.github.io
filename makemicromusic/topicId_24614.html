And the soft pads and blips at the beginning<br/>work really well...almost sounds like an intro to a Goa/Ambient song before it<br/>turns on its head into &quot;Space Jazz&quot;...never seen that genre combo before and it<br/>sounds sweet.<br/>    The staccato rhythm cuts on the first breakdown at 2:00 just screams<br/>attitude and has those great big-band style synth stabs...it almost feels<br/>Beatles-esque to me.  The guitar solo at the end has a killer sharp and silky<br/>smooth sound to the production...and then it goes back to the abstract<br/>reggae/&quot;space jazz&quot; feel.</p><p>   That said there are some significant drawbacks to my ears.  While the<br/>production style is awesome...the looping through the same chords and holding<br/>the exact same mood for all of the song does get a bit monotonous at times (if<br/>there&apos;s anything &quot;surprising&quot; that changes...it&apos;s in the arrangement and<br/>solos).  The scale and/or chords/counterpoint used, to my ears, also sounds<br/>rather unstable...the emotional effect is a bit like a child swinging from one<br/>side of a balance beam to another (left to right...) slowly flapping his hands<br/>to keep balance....and while it goes well with the &quot;Space Jazz&quot; feel, it sounds<br/>like a bit of a nervous wreck at times.</p><p>&gt;&quot;This track has a lot of untapped potential in terms of additional melodies and<br/>&gt;layers, better transitions, and more studio polish&quot;<br/>   Funny, because all of the above, in general, sound great to me.  Maybe the<br/>transitions are a bit sudden and not so smooth at times (IE sudden starts/stops<br/>of the rhythm, chords, and melodies rather than a smooth &quot;roll over&quot; of energy<br/>and resolve occurring between parts with the chords)...but that&apos;s about it.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24620 href="#24620">ðŸ”—</a>aum &#x3C;aum@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2011 2:50:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Good news, Daniel and  good idea, Carl!<br/>No Linux version, what a pitty.<br/>Does anybody know if every note can be freely tuned or if it is only possible to retune 12 notes in octave?<br/>Milan</p><p>On 01/14/2011 10:10 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Wonderful news!

Only 12 tones in octave, each +/-<br/>100 Cent retuning...</p><p>-------------------</p><p>Phatty Tuner User&#xFFFD;s Guide</p><p>Tunings Menu<br/>The Tunings menu remembers the scales entered into the instrument,<br/>allowing the user to recall and<br/>organize the usable scales. Scala files are also supported, as long<br/>as they are twelve-tone files; other<br/>tunings with fewer or greater number of pitches are currently not<br/>supported. These can be loaded into the<br/>program using the File &gt; Open menu option. Scala files can also be<br/>exported from the program using the<br/>Save As menu option.<br/>The top portion shows the selected scale preset number, the scale&apos;s<br/>name, and the selected root note for<br/>this scale. The scale preset number can be changed to send the<br/>current working tuning to a different<br/>preset location in the instrument. The root note is stored along with<br/>the preset, and will determine which<br/>note is considered to have a 1:1 ratio. This is useful for performing<br/>in the same tuning scale but in a<br/>different key.</p><p>Tuning Table<br/>Below the title area, there is a table whose rows represent the notes<br/>in one octave, and whose columns<br/>describe the information entered in the rightmost column of each row<br/>in different ways. Twelve-tone<br/>octave tunings are supported, allowing the user to temper pitch<br/>classes relative to a root note. The top<br/>and bottom rows are read-only, indicating the root note.<br/>In the leftmost column, you see the note name and its assigned<br/>frequency. In the default tuning mode,<br/>twelve-tone equal temperament (12TET), each pitch is exactly 100<br/>cents away from each of its<br/>neighboring notes. This is the modern western sound with which most<br/>people are familiar.<br/>The second column shows a note&apos;s deviation from 12TET in cents. For<br/>12TET, this will be zero cents in<br/>all fields. For any other tuning, these values will differ.<br/>The third column describes the ratio between the root note and every<br/>other note. This number will always<br/>be between one and two, where two represents one octave above the<br/>root note.<br/>The fourth column is where the user can specify the relationship<br/>between the individual notes in the<br/>octave, and the root note, in cents. Please note that the current<br/>setup does not support more than 100<br/>cent deviation for each note from 12TET. For example, if the root<br/>note is C and the D note (normally<br/>tuned to 200 cents from root) is tuned below 100 or above 300 cents<br/>from root, the program will highlight<br/>the input field in red to indicate that this tuning will not be<br/>applied correctly when sent via MIDI.<br/>When the desired tuning data is present in the tuning table, press<br/>the SEND button to send the scale to<br/>the Phatty hardware. It will be loaded into the tuning location<br/>specified by the &#xFFFD;scale#&#xFFFD; field. Read your<br/>Phatty manual for additional information.</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>Daniel F</p><p>On 14 Jan 2011, at 7:50 PM, aum wrote:</p><p>&gt; Good news, Daniel and  good idea, Carl!<br/>&gt; No Linux version, what a pitty.<br/>&gt; Does anybody know if every note can be freely tuned or if it is only<br/>&gt; possible to retune 12 notes in octave?<br/>&gt; Milan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 01/14/2011 10:10 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Wonderful news!
