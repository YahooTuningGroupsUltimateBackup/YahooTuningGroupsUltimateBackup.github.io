It is also good<br/>for the Carlos Alpha scale as well as many others. It is also more<br/>simple than 1200tet and can serve as an experimental benchmark when<br/>conducting sound harmonic experiments. Since many modern keyboards can<br/>accommodate almost any 12-note set of almost any temperament then this<br/>idea has a certain practicality which can be implemented in live<br/>performance.</p></div>
