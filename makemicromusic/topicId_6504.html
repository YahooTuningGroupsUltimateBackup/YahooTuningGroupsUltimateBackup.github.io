While there are some aesthetic<br/>and compositional points I might discuss, maybe it would be better to<br/>let people listen first and give their own reactions.</p><p>Suffice it for now to say that whatever merit this little piece might<br/>have owes a lot to such classics as the Missa Tournai, for example,<br/>and also to the tradition of a piece such as a motet composed for an<br/>occasion of state.</p><p>My apologies, of course, for any errata or glitches in the MIDI or the<br/>score.</p><p>A note on the tuning system: this is Peppermint 24, something with<br/>which I&apos;m familiar, although I _do_ intend to write a piece in 25-tET<br/>also as you proposed. My keyboard notation, as usual, has an asterisk<br/>sign (*) to show a note on the upper keyboard raised by ~58.68 cents.<br/>Here the piece is centered on the upper keyboard in order to obtain<br/>the desired intervals.</p><p>In vocal performance, obviously, singers would approximate rather than<br/>precisely follow this intonational model, and indeed might sing some<br/>pure or closer-to-pure fifths where Peppermint has them tempered about<br/>2.14 cents wide.</p><p>Composing this piece has been quite an experience, and thank you,<br/>Mark, for helping to make it possible and providing that creative and<br/>catalytic impetus to &quot;make micro music.&quot;</p><p>                       *           *           *</p><p>! _O Europae domus communis_, song to celebreate expansion of European<br/>! Union, composed 1-4 May 2004.</p><p>! Composition for three voices in Peppermint 24, a tuning system where the<br/>! ratio between the sizes in cents of the chromatic and diatonic semitones<br/>! is equal to Phi (~1.618), with fifths at about 704.096 cents. Two<br/>! 12-note chains in this regular temperament are placed at a distance<br/>! of around 58.680 cents, producing some pure 7:6 minor thirds.</p><p>! Basic rhythm is 6/8, with dotted quarter or crotchet as beat or tactus<br/>! Suggested tempo around 80-85 beats per minute (MIDI has 83-1/3)</p><p>! Numbers above notes count main beats (two per measure), with<br/>! subdivision into eighths/quavers shown in relevant measures;<br/>! a comma in this line indicates a pause in the phrasing. Please note<br/>! that notes are generally sustained until the next note indicated<br/>! in that part or the end of the piece.</p><p>          | 1  2  3   4  5  6   |<br/>1     2   | 1         2         | 1    2   | 1    2    |<br/>F*4   F*4  E*4    F*4 D*4   E*4   F*4  G*4   A*4  Bb*4<br/>C*4   C*4  B*3                    C*4  D*4   E*4  F*4<br/>F*3   F*3  G*3                    F*3  Bb*3  C*4  D*4<br/>O     Eu-  ro-                    pae  do-   mus  com-</p><p>1  2  3   4   5  6   |        | 1  2  3  4  5  6  | 1  2  3   4 5 6 |<br/>1         2          | 1   2, | 1        2        | 1         2     | 1 2 |<br/>A*4   G*4 G*4    F*4   A*4      A*4      G*4   F*4  E*4   D*4 E*4     F*4<br/>E*4       D*4          E*4      E*4      D*4   C*4  B*3               C*4<br/>C*4       Bb*3         A*3      C*4      Bb*3  A*3  G*3               F*3<br/>mu        -            nis      am-      pli-  fi-  ca-               ta,</p><p>        | 1  2  3   4  5  6  |                   | 1  2  3  4  5 6  |<br/>1    2  | 1         2        | 1    2  | 1    2  | 1        2       | 1 2,|<br/>F*4       G*4   F*4 E*4   D*4  F*4  F*4  G*4  A*4  A*4  G*4 G*4  F*4  A*4<br/>C*4       D*4   C*4 B*3        C*4  C*4  D*4  E*4  D*4      D*4       E*4<br/>F*3  A*4  G*3       G*3        F*3  A*3  Bb*3 C*4  Bb*3     Bb*3      A*3<br/>O    _    Gal  -    li    -    a    vox  no-  bi-  lis-     si-       ma</p><p>                           | 1  2  3   4  5  6  |<br/>1    2   | 1   2  | 1   2  | 1         2        | 1   2  | 1   2 |<br/>A*4  G*4   G4       G*4      G*4       F*4   E*4  D*4 E*4  F*4<br/>E*4  D*4   D4       D*4      D*4   E*4 D*4        C*4 B*3  C*4<br/>C*4  Bb*3  A*3      G*3      G*3                           F*3<br/>que  -     ru-      lae      pa-                           cis:</p><p>                                     (duplets)<br/>1    2   | 1   2  | 1    2   | 1     2   +   | 1    2  | 1  2  |<br/>E*4  E*4   E4       E*4        F*4   F*4 F*4   E*4  F*4  F4<br/>A*3  A*3   B*3      A*3        D4    D4  D4    D4   D4   D*4<br/>A*3  A*3   A3       A*3        A*3   A*3 A*3   A*3  A*3  Bb3<br/>Ex   du-   me-      to         il-   la- que-  an-  te   bel-</p><p>                             | 1  2  3    4  5  6 |<br/>1    2   | 1   2  | 1    2   | 1          2       | 1  2, | 1    2   |<br/>           F4       F*4        F*4   F*4  G*4       A*4     A*4  G*4<br/>C*4  C4    C*4      Bb*3       D*4   D*4  D*4       E*4     E*4  D*4<br/>           Bb3      Bb*3       Bb*3  Bb*3 Bb*3      A*3     A*3  A*3<br/>                    lis        du-   ci-  te        nos     Ut   prae-</p><p>1  2  3  4   5  6 |                                | 1  2  3  4  5  6 |<br/>1        2        | 1   2, | 1   2 | 1  2 | 1   2  | 1        2       |<br/>G4       E*4 G4     G*4      A*4     G*4    G*4      G*4      F*4  E*4<br/>D4       B*3 D4     D*4      D*4     D*4    E*4      E*4      D*4<br/>A*3      A*3        G*3      G*3            G*3      G*3<br/>va-      le  -      at       con     -      cor      -</p><p>1    2   | 1    2 ||<br/>D*4  E*4   F*4<br/>C*4  B*3   C*4<br/>     G*3   F*3<br/> -   di -  a.</p><p>&quot;O common house of Europe enlarged,<br/> O France, most noble voice of imploring peace:<br/> Out of the entangling thicket of war, lead us<br/> So that concord may prevail.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6506 href="#6506">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

If Jon&apos;s helpful comments don&apos;t address or solve your specific<br/>problem, or for others with sound cards, etc., where this known glitch<br/>might cause a problem, I&apos;ve produced another MIDI file where unisons<br/>between two voices are sounded in only one voice:</p><p>            &lt;<a href="http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/o_euro1b.mid">http://www.calweb.com/~mschulter/o_euro1b.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>With some devices, it seems, having two &quot;Note On&quot; messages for the same<br/>note can get treated as a &quot;Note On&quot; almost immediately followed by a &quot;Note<br/>Off,&quot; abruptly cutting off the note. Thus I&apos;ve removed one of the notes at<br/>such places -- fortunately, in this piece, only a few -- to avoid such<br/>problems.</p><p>Kraig, if this were a source of the difficulties you were having, I would<br/>expect it to occur in the middle of the piece, since that is where these<br/>unisons occur; if it was happening at the beginning, for example, we might<br/>look to another cause, for example as in Jon&apos;s suggestions.</p><p>Jon, thank you for your warm and encouraging comments, as always, and also<br/>for your technical insights so aptly applied to the practical goal of<br/>&quot;making micro music.&quot;</p><p>While this ties in with another thread where I might offer some further<br/>comments, for now I will mention that Guenter Nagler&apos;s midi2txt utility<br/>for converting a MIDI file to readable text of the commands which can be<br/>proofread has been very helpful for proofreading the MIDI output I get<br/>from the Scala EXAMPLE feature -- not to mention Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s<br/>Scala! As has been commented elsewhere, it&apos;s appropriate early and often<br/>to let it be known that these programs are useful and appreciated.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6516 href="#6516">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2004 11:43:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone, and please let me thank Kraig, Jon, Rick,<br/>Christopher, and others for showing that &quot;making micro music&quot; is a<br/>question of sharing our skills and generosity, that solving practical<br/>problems of a technical nature is at once a part of this process and a<br/>very significant arena for this generosity, and that this forum is a<br/>wonderful opportunity to help each other.</p><p>Of course, Kraig, I&apos;m delighted that your problem got solved -- and that<br/>reminds me, I can and should write a review of that beautiful CD that you<br/>sent me. That&apos;s one of my next projects, after offering a few comments on<br/>Bill&apos;s _Xentonality_ to go with what others have shared, and especially on<br/>my curious and very pleasant response to the _ Turquoise Dabo Girl_ piece<br/>in 11-tET.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
