You can preview it (all 9 tracks are online now) at: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/ism-studio/sets/va-subversio-forthcoming-on/">http://soundcloud.com/ism-studio/sets/va-subversio-forthcoming-on/</a></p><p>The release is digital only - Amazon has it, so do a few other places (maybe iTunes too?)</p><p>May I just say that Jacky Ligon has gone absolutely deep and Tony Dubshot&apos;s &quot;Roof Garden&quot; is exactly the xenharmonic music I want to hear.</p><p>Those of you on the Windows platform can expect to see an update for the Xenharmonic FMTS synthesizer (1.1) within the next few days. It introduces some clever new tricks, improves sound quality of the oscillators, and works much better with DAW automation.

I don&apos;t think it is conservative either. It seems there is<br/>as much conservatism in those who use large number of tones.</p><p>With all the talk of modulation and many pitched scales, we might notice<br/>how little through the years have we heard people use a large palette of<br/>tones much less anyone bother to modulate which is so often the basics<br/>of the theory</p><p>  In my youth it was those that used the most radical of material that<br/>drew me, now it is less with the material than how it is used.</p><p>  I started working with 36 tones ,went to 22, to 12 , and now looking<br/>at finishing a set of nine tone instruments.</p><p>The act of doing music in general is always in a state of being<br/>proclaimed useless or lacking meaning, and while we can feel such<br/>things, i wouldn&apos;t succumb to such forces. It is at the end of a horse<br/>race than the horses break loose.</p><p>I have enjoyed what you have done for years. i suggest you continue.</p><p>I don&apos;t think this type of music making is a good idea. making it on<br/>machines and posting to other incorporeal brains elsewhere to listen<br/>through little commuter speakers. It becomes music that has no meaning<br/>beyond &apos;like&apos; or &apos;dislike&apos;.</p><p>  Music used to involve local people getting together and making noise<br/>per se. perhaps if it is really to remain meaningful beyond just trying<br/>to impress others, we might have to go back to that conservative method<br/>of making music.</p><p>  On 8/12/11 5:48 AM, jsmith9624@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &lt;mailto:MakeMicroMusic%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &quot;sevishmusic&quot; &lt;sevish@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; May I just say that Jacky Ligon has gone absolutely deep and Tony<br/>&gt; Dubshot&apos;s &quot;Roof Garden&quot; is exactly the xenharmonic music I want to hear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This explains a good deal.
