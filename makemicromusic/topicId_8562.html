But add to that the fact that<br/>Reinhard&apos;s keen wit and long background as a microtonalist allowed<br/>him to completely re-envision Ives in a way that no one else had<br/>dared, or everyone else had missed, and we&apos;re talking a visionary<br/>undertaking. Now Johnny&apos;s gone and DIY-ed a professional studio<br/>recording through complete with specialized players, what can one<br/>say... WOW! Microtonalists should be proud... Ivesians intrigued...<br/>because what we have here folks is truly bigtime accomplishment, and<br/>I think history will prove this out too. Where were you?</p><p>IVES REVISITED:<br/>THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX<br/>...AND THE CIRCLE OF FIFTHS<br/>Dan Stearns</p><p>It&apos;s a well-known fact that Charles Ives left the Universe Symphony<br/>in the hands of posterity, and NY bassoon virtuoso Johnny Reinhard is<br/>one of a growing number of composers that have collaborated with Ives<br/>posthumously to realize a version of the legendary unfinished<br/>symphony. What&apos;s less well known, and in my opinion much more<br/>noteworthy, is that Reinharda longtime microtonalist and founder of<br/>the American Festival of Microtonal Musichas also suggested that<br/>there was an extended Pythagorean intonation latent in Ives&apos; often<br/>curious note spelling.</p><p>In 12-tone equal temperament enharmonic spellings like F# and Gb are<br/>always acoustically synonymous. In an extended Pythagorean intonation<br/>the sequence of fifths never closes as it does in 12-tone equal<br/>temperament, and enharmonic equivalencies are always acoustically<br/>distinct. Ives&apos; writing in the Memos and elsewhere offers tantalizing<br/>indications that his unorthodox note spellings were in fact adhering<br/>to the extended Pythagorean model.</p><p>The most compelling arguments supporting this interpretation are<br/>Ives&apos; own assertions that B# was as an eighthtone higher than C, and<br/>that enharmonic sharps were higher in pitch than enharmonic flats. In<br/>an extended Pythagorean tuning, B# overshoots the octave by a<br/>Pythagorean comma, and the Pythagorean comma is within a fraction of<br/>a cent of an eighthtone. Likewise, the chain of perfect fifths that<br/>defines Pythagorean tuning generates enharmonic sharps that are<br/>higher in pitch than enharmonic flats.</p><p>To go along with the various clues and anecdotal indications that<br/>Reinhard has assembled along these lines, there&apos;s also some pretty<br/>solid empirical evidence that indicates there even may have been some<br/>JI (just-intonated) sonorities via schismatic spellings that were<br/>edited out of Ives.</p><p>Here&apos;s a fascinating bit from an exchange I had with David Porter of<br/>the Ives Society:</p><p>Last year I spent several months going over the &quot;new&quot; (22 years old)<br/>critical editions of Tone Roads Nos. 1 &amp; 3 and Halloween. In TR #1<br/>and Halloween, John Kirkpatrick had respelled many of Ives&apos;s notes to<br/>make them more &quot;practical&quot; and more &quot;correct&quot; harmonically. The<br/>reason I spent so much time undoing all that foolishness was to make<br/>these Old editions in line with our new Ives Society guidelines. (We<br/>now preserve Ives&apos;s spelling, rhythms, and have a consistent format<br/>for describing details of the editing.)</p><p>Ives himself states his thinking in an Appendix to his &quot;Memos&quot;flats<br/>represent repose and rest, sharps represent activity. I&apos;ve seen<br/>several places where a first draft uses flats, but the later and<br/>final drafts use sharps. C# is nearer to D than to C, etc., Db closer<br/>to C than to D. Hence that descending &quot;triad&quot; in &quot;West London&quot; b-ab-<br/>e. The &quot;3rd&quot; ab should be flatter than a &quot;proper&quot; g#.</p><p>Ives always railed against convention and the tyrannical effects of<br/>reflexive mental habits, and most of his explanations for the note<br/>spellings are really screeds along these lines. Yet it&apos;s Reinhard&apos;s<br/>premise that Ives harbored more than ideological and metaphysical<br/>ambitions when he spelled things as he did. In fact, it&apos;s Reinhard&apos;s<br/>expressed view that Ives&apos; unorthodox note spelling should be seen as<br/>a sort of Trojan horse that hid a specific and far-reaching<br/>organization of acoustical significance. In this sense an extended<br/>Pythagorean tuningwhere an enharmonic # is always sharper than an<br/>enharmonic b, etclines up beautifully with certain anecdotal bits in<br/>the Memos and elsewhere. The only problem is that Ives never came<br/>right out and said &quot;Pythagorean&quot; himself, so the application of this<br/>premise will always invite controversy.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that Ives is expressing the same idea in different<br/>terms; that &quot;Pythagorean&quot; was not part of his language and the whole<br/>issue is one of semantics. If one assumes that&apos;s the case, the<br/>question really becomes one of what now... to what extent and by what<br/>criteria should Ives be reinvented beyond his existing pieces for<br/>quartertones as a microtonalist? To date Reinhard and the AFMM have<br/>organized performances of the Second String Quartet, The Unanswered<br/>Question and the Universe Symphony in extended Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t surprise anyone familiar with Ives that his own<br/>rationale for the note spellings offers arguments favorable to both<br/>corporeal and transcendental interpretation. But if the sheer volume<br/>of rhetoric given to each possibility is any indication, then Ives<br/>clearly hits his stride discussing the latter. Yet that&apos;s certainly<br/>true of Ives on the whole, and it should in no way obviate the fact<br/>that he did offer concreteif short of explicittuning data regarding<br/>his note spelling that can be acted upon by clever and resourceful<br/>persons such as Johnny Reinhard. If there&apos;s anything like a smoking<br/>gun regarding the exact acoustical significance of Ives&apos; note<br/>spelling, then it&apos;s my opinion that it might be found in a<br/>typewritten technical plan of the Concord Sonata that Ives mentions<br/>sending to Henry Bellamann in the Memos:</p><p>In the strings the chord Ab-Cb-Gb-Bb is a different chord from Ab-B-<br/>Gb-Bb (see typewritten copy sent to Bellamann of technical plan etc.<br/>of Sonata, with tone-vibration tables etc.)the difference in its<br/>overtonal beats (actually measured vibrationally), especially if hit<br/>rather hard, is evident.</p><p>The example that Porter points out is something of a horse of a<br/>different color however... In an extended Pythagorean tuning the only<br/>pure or beatless sonorities would be those based on the 2nd and 3rd<br/>harmonics. This is very much like a medieval tuning paradigm, only in<br/>medieval music thirds weren&apos;t considered consonances. But for all his<br/>dissonance and experimentation Ives never disavowed triads and<br/>tonality, and even the Fourth Symphony and the Concord Sonata (two of<br/>his most daunting works) feature entire movements of programmatic<br/>tonality. Yet by Reinhard&apos;s reckoning, major triads in an extended<br/>Pythagorean performance of Ives would employ thirds even wider than<br/>those of equal temperament; which is already quite sharp as regards<br/>sonorities of the 5th harmonic. Well this brings us back to the<br/>descending B-Ab-E triad. Because in the West London triad that Porter<br/>mentions the third would be a schismatic thirdone where the<br/>difference from a just third is a schisma, a tiny interval of<br/>approximately 2 cents. So in this case it could be said that Ives is<br/>exploiting a pure, JI triad by &apos;misspelling&apos; the third as a<br/>Pythagorean diminished fourth.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing in Ives that would indicate any propensity for these<br/>kinds of simple, sonorous JI textures, quite the opposite in fact.<br/>But clearly there were serendipitous, ideological and program-<br/>oriented occasions of simple JI sonorities via schismatic spellings,<br/>and it would be nice to know to exactly what degree these were a<br/>rarity in Ives or something that was systematically edited out in an<br/>attempt to tidy things up. For anyone wanting to realize these<br/>implications in Ives, these recent critical editionsthat preserve<br/>Ives&apos; original spellings, et alwill be a valuable addition to a body<br/>of work that still has some surprisingly fresh tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is with great joy that I can finally say my realization of the<br/>&gt; Charles Ives &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; is finished on CD at maximum<br/>&gt; fidelity, albeit pre-release.
