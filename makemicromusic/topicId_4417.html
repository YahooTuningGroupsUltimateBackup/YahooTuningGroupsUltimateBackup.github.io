I bought an old TX-802 for the ability to use full keyboard tunings *in the hope* that more complex voice architecture would yield fuller timbral possibilities than my two TX81Z boxes. No dice.</p><p>&gt;Of course it would be great to have both.</p><p>Yep.

I still gravitate to this box, and am now working in 12 note scales just so I can use sounds that are more pleasing to my ears...</p><p>Addendum: some people seem to make FM synthsis work just swell for them; Rick McGowan comes to mind.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
