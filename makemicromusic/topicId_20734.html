These are samples of the &quot;soundtrack&quot; I&apos;m writing (the imaginary movie and/or video game I mentioned before). The last two, &quot;Venez jouer!&quot; and &quot;La nef des fous&quot; contain microtonal notes, again 72-edo. The other three are purely 12-tone. The last track uses short passages in 8-et and 9-et, the latter case being a pelog-like pentatonic scale in the trombones, but it shows off more in its polyrhythm than microtonalism. (Turko-Western military percussion in 7/8, Japanese taiko in 4/4, djembe and bendir in 5/8, Afro-Cuban percussion in alternating 12/16 and 6/8.)</p><p>These are all part of a very large planned work and are considered very rough drafts and alpha pre-releases. A lot needs to be worked on, including wrong notes, volume of instruments and such. I also should start shopping for a better synth; I&apos;m running into way too many limitations with the Roland I&apos;ve been using. And I can never get reverb and other effects right.</p><p>I have another homepage set up where I can store much more than ten files, but I&apos;d rather do so when I get a lot more work done.</p><p>So that&apos;s what&apos;s keeping me busy lately. ~D.</p></div>
