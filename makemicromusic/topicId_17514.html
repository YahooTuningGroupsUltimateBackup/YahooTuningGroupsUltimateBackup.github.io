Is the fretting a subset of the 13edo (where one<br/>must use the other strings to get the remaining notes)?  Or is there<br/>some other reason for the uneven fretting?  I hope you can comment on<br/>this when you can.</p><p>Thanks!<br/>Jay</p><p>On Fri, 2007-08-17 at 23:14 +0000, daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:<br/>&gt; byran asked me not to post it because he didn&apos;t think it was good<br/>&gt; enough, and probably put it up for his friends and not mine anyway.<br/>&gt; But<br/>&gt; i thought it was probably too musical for all that, so i put it out<br/>&gt; there--besides, how many 13EDO videos are out there on youtube anyway?<br/>&gt; also, he was only 12 when he recorded this improv and clarinet is<br/>&gt; his &quot;real&quot; instrument,so i cut him some slack!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx0RVCjUwO8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx0RVCjUwO8</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
