If your attempts to initiate your desired discussion do not meet with the desired level of interest, all I can say is that complaining about the lack of interest in the subject will do nothing to generate interest in it.

So people who say math is always<br/>related or virtually never related, IMVHO, are equally close minded.</p><p>   Back to &quot;how this affects actually making music&quot;.  Most of the discussion on<br/>the tuning list recently has been about Harmonic Entropy.  Harmonic Entropy<br/>typically assumes most everything consonant/&quot;clear&quot; is heard on the basis of<br/>5-limit dyads (at least within the octave).</p><p>    What I&apos;m pushing for is a system that encompasses 11-limit and even 15-limit<br/>dyads as having their own &quot;albeit with less slack for frequency range and a bit<br/>less consonance&quot; musical identities.  You may ask, how did I come up with the<br/>idea that things like 11/9 and 22/15 could be used in music (despite that most<br/>mathematical consonance theories say otherwise)?  Well, my ears and experience<br/>in composing in large TET&apos;s and simply choosing what ratios sounded best to me<br/>without thinking about the math.</p><p>   What&apos;s seems to be at stake far as the point of this list IE producing<br/>micro-tonal music?</p><p>   The whole idea is higher-limit ratios (and ultimately microtonality) should<br/>be given justice as having a larger purpose in music.  Not only does the include<br/>types of ratios include the rich Middle Eastern (and some Medieval) heritage,<br/>but IMVHO by and large the difference between 12TET and micro-tonality (12TET is<br/>a not-at-all-far-from-ideal (to the average musician&apos;s ear) 5-limit system).  So<br/>getting a theory to work on things like 11-limit dyad would likely convince a<br/>lot of professors to start using them and going the next step and making<br/>theories about 3 and 4 note chords and what can be used as &quot;relaxed&quot; and &quot;tense&quot;<br/>chords, neighboring vs. chord tones...in actual composition theories.  Then I<br/>figure they can (finally!) push for the development of instruments, deeper<br/>composition theories, and more that make much more (and much easier) options for<br/>musicians concerning microtonality.</p><p>    That seems to be a goal: to prove microtonality is not a random,<br/>pie-in-the-sky idea...and that its theory has every bit as much foundation as<br/>traditional music theory and deserves a similar level of support for composers.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23620 href="#23620">ðŸ”—</a>richard duckworth &#x3C;richduckworth@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2010 5:23:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Jon :) I meant math!
