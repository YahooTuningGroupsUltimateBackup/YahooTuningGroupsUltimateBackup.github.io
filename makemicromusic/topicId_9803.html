I will say this,<br/>though to prospective violists: While the viola is viewed as an<br/>&quot;easier than violin&quot; instrument in Western classical music, do not<br/>expect to slack off!  Composers such as Copland, Bach, Telemann, etc.<br/>wrote some wicked viola parts.</p><p>For Western classical with the viola as the lead instrument, start<br/>with William Primrose and Lionel Tertris.

Our Persian<br/>teacher has his own orchestra too, but maintains in his teaching a<br/>balance between through-arranged music study and study/practice of the<br/>Radif (the Persian equivalent of jazz standards, Hindustani raga, etc.).</p></div>
