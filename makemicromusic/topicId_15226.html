(I had to adjust the pitch somewhat lower than my<br/>C=264 default.)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; It&apos;s been said here before, but 17-edo, I have to agree, has nice<br/>&gt; narrow semitones--good for melodic lines.</p><p>This is a piece that I&apos;ll be listening to again and again, because<br/>it&apos;s well written, full of surprises, and melodically very<br/>beautiful.  And, oh yes!  There&apos;s one other very special reason:<br/>since it has a 2-part texture, it struck me as a perfect example of<br/>something I wrote about in January 2004:</p><p>&lt;&lt; When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two voice parts<br/>(such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are able to &quot;hear&quot;<br/>harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are implied by<br/>tonal relationships already familiar to both the composer and the<br/>listener.  A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale subset<br/>of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not have the<br/>same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression of<br/>intervals -- unless the composer had first written other (successful)<br/>pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the listener had also<br/>become familiar with them.  In other words, the diatonic system is<br/>really a musical language, and our success in creating music in<br/>alternative tunings may depend on our ability to create (or discover)<br/>other musical languages that are capable of becoming meaningful to<br/>the general listener. &gt;&gt;</p><p>This is quoted from:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/52002">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/52002</a></p><p>I would be very curious to learn, as time goes on and we&apos;ve become<br/>more familiar with a developing 17-tone &quot;language&quot;, whether any of us<br/>will be hearing *inferred* (or &quot;phantom&quot;) harmonies in this piece,<br/>since I don&apos;t expect that any were implied.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=15249 href="#15249">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2006 7:02:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

I listened to this last night and<br/>&gt; figured that the abundance of neutral, large major, small minor<br/>&gt; intervals (together with good 4ths &amp; 5ths) made 17 the prime<br/>&gt; suspect.  I verified that this is the EDO (and not a WT) by playing<br/>&gt; along with it on Scala&apos;s chromatic clavier, which turned out to be<br/>&gt; lots of fun.   (I had to adjust the pitch somewhat lower than my<br/>&gt; C=264 default.)</p><p>so you&apos;re not using A440 OR C256, eh?</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s been said here before, but 17-edo, I have to agree, has nice<br/>&gt; &gt; narrow semitones--good for melodic lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a piece that I&apos;ll be listening to again and again, because<br/>&gt; it&apos;s well written, full of surprises, and melodically very<br/>&gt; beautiful.</p><p>Thanks you...that means a lot to me!</p><p>&gt; And, oh yes!  There&apos;s one other very special reason:<br/>&gt; since it has a 2-part texture, it struck me as a perfect example of<br/>&gt; something I wrote about in January 2004:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; When we listen to a diatonic composition with only two voice parts<br/>&gt; (such as a Bach two-part keyboard invention), we are able to &quot;hear&quot;<br/>&gt; harmonies that are there only in the sense that they are implied by<br/>&gt; tonal relationships already familiar to both the composer and the<br/>&gt; listener.  A two-voice composition in some non-diatonic scale subset<br/>&gt; of a non-12 tuning, on the other hand, would very likely not have the<br/>&gt; same effect, but would be heard basically as a progression of<br/>&gt; intervals -- unless the composer had first written other (successful)<br/>&gt; pieces in that scale using full harmonies and the listener had also<br/>&gt; become familiar with them.  In other words, the diatonic system is<br/>&gt; really a musical language, and our success in creating music in<br/>&gt; alternative tunings may depend on our ability to create (or discover)<br/>&gt; other musical languages that are capable of becoming meaningful to<br/>&gt; the general listener. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is quoted from:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/52002">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/52002</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would be very curious to learn, as time goes on and we&apos;ve become<br/>&gt; more familiar with a developing 17-tone &quot;language&quot;, whether any of us<br/>&gt; will be hearing *inferred* (or &quot;phantom&quot;) harmonies in this piece,<br/>&gt; since I don&apos;t expect that any were implied.</p><p>This is very interesting. I can sort of imagine phantom harmonies now<br/>that you mention it, but I&apos;d have to really think about what they<br/>might be, and I certainly wouldn&apos;t have thought of them had you not<br/>mentioned the concept!</p><p>I wrote the piece with the concept of free chromaticism and<br/>diatonicism on the horizontal, melodic level being mixed with a sense<br/>of vertical consonance which would be dominated by 3/2, 4/3, 16/9, and<br/>9/8. (i.e. 5ths, 4ths, minor 7ths and major 2nds). It&apos;s probably not<br/>audible in a conscious sense, but the piece is a palindrome--maybe it<br/>makes for some interesting unconscious sense of unity mixed with<br/>surprise--resolutions have a way of being odd, yet working, when<br/>reversed, becoming anti-resolutions! And for me, something abut 17<br/>lends itself to this type of trick--maybe it&apos;s because you don&apos;t have<br/>the typical usage of major thirds getting in the way?</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=15269 href="#15269">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2006 12:01:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Aaron,</p><p>Congratulations on the _Adagio_, a fine piece with which I am most<br/>honored to be associated with, although it is above all a compliment<br/>to your subtle musicianship and diverse veins of expression.</p><p>As you might guessed, I loved the counterpoint and sonorities,<br/>including the quartal/quintal side of 17-EDO and also some moments<br/>which really reminded me of some transporting performances of music<br/>around the late 14th century.</p><p>At the same time, the piece belongs to the world of your many<br/>compositions in different styles, another facet of your amazing<br/>range and ability to combine improvisational intuition with unifying<br/>formal structures.
