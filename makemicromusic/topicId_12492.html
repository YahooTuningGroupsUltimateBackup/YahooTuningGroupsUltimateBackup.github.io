The Orion software&apos;s native sampler is tunable up to a<br/>max of 12 pitches. I have installed freeware VST&apos;s that handle<br/>higher-order tunings, though they tend toward the &quot;electronic&quot; in<br/>sonority. I want to work on a few chamber-style ensembles with more<br/>traditional instrumentation, so wish me luck.</p><p>An excellent and very useful piece of freeware is Timidity. DO NOT try<br/>to figure out how to use it using the documentation, however. With<br/>Timidity and a good quality GM font, you can do a lot. Good GM fonts are<br/>Merlin Jupiter, SGM and Merlin Vienna.</p></div>
