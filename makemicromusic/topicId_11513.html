It is<br/>  possible to make progress in all this computer stuff.</p><p>  Got Audacity to work (sort of)!</p><p>  Thanks for the help of some list members off-board.</p><p>  Using the USB aspect of this to connect the keyboard<br/>  to the computer has not worked out.</p><p>  I wrote to Yamaha asking them how to play my keyboard<br/>  and get the music to come through my computer&apos;s speakers<br/>  instead of the keyboard&apos;s speakers. I figured this would be<br/>  the first place to start.<br/>  I got this. (which I<br/>  don&apos;t understand):::::::::</p><p>   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;This is possible. The problem with hearing what you are<br/>playing<br/>out of the computer speakers is that you will be hearing the<br/>sounds of a sound card. The sound card voices are not the<br/>quality voices of a DGX-205. All you have to do is select the<br/>sound card drivers under midi setup within the software.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>  Anyway:</p><p>  I was advised by some here to<br/>  connect the Phones/Output output of the keyboard to the<br/>  microphone input of the computer with a audio cable.<br/>  This worked right away.</p><p>  I have a spliter at the output of the Phones/Output jack.<br/>  One side goes into my headphones (so I can hear what I&apos;m<br/>  doing) and one side goes into Audacity (at mic in on computer).<br/>  It&apos;s not perfect but it does record.</p><p>  So how would I post C-E-G? I just want to understand the posting<br/>  process.<br/>  I will delete this after posting of course.</p><p>  Regards,</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2005 7:58:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot;<br/>&lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    I just did it!!!

Looked for a few minutes.</p><p>You are missing the point: Chris is just pointing out a couple places where you can get free webspace that you can upload your files, and then post a link to the file. The file space here on MMM usually gets used up, and most people have places that they post their own work and then just let people on the list know where to download it. It doesn&apos;t have to be anything connected with microtonality.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2005 1:19:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>   Jon</p><p>  Just noticed &quot;80% of 20MB used up&quot; in files section.

Been into 24 for many<br/>  months. Was not thinking about doing anything fancy for posterity<br/>  though. I hope there is enough room here at MMM. The plan was to<br/>  post some music and delete it in January. Someday when I actually<br/>  understand 12 (and therefore 24) I should do something permanent.<br/>  Sad, not a expert at anything at my age. Some of my playing is<br/>  really nice at times, but I don&apos;t really *know* what I did or<br/>  what I might have done (sniffle, sniffle).</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p><p>&gt;  The file space here on MMM usually gets used up...<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div>
