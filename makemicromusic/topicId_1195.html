Now 4:7:9 is actually very accurate in 11-tET,<br/>&gt;but of course the &quot;6&quot; isn&apos;t represented at all. Did you map this down<br/>&gt;to 654 cents, or up to 763 cents? I&apos;m guessing the former, but<br/>&gt;actually I&apos;m not quite sure. I have a very good ear, but evidently<br/>&gt;when you screw with the timbres, you&apos;re removing its usual points of<br/>&gt;reference!</p><p>Well, I never worked out any &quot;music theory&quot; for 11-tet, but<br/>I just looked back at the midi file of the dabo girl,<br/>and the last measure contains the following midi note numbers:</p><p>43 45 54 56 63  67  74 78</p><p>Since this is mapped to 11-tet, there are 11 midi numbers in an octave,<br/>thus 45-56-67-78 are all octaves, and 43-54, 67-78, and 63-74<br/>are octaves... however, theyre not all sounded at once - the last two<br/>chords are:</p><p>43-54-63-67-74-78 which &quot;resolves&quot; to<br/>45-56-63-67-74-78 half way through the measure.</p><p>Removing octave redundancies this is</p><p>54-63-67 resolving to<br/>56-63</p><p>So the final resolution is to a dyad, not a triad.<br/>Now its time for me to scratch my head... what are these chords?<br/>What are the roots? What kind of harmony is this?</p></div><h3><a id=1200 href="#1200">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2001 2:39:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., sethares@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt; 54-63-67 resolving to<br/>&gt; 56-63<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the final resolution is to a dyad, not a triad.</p><p>Well, I heard a tetrad . . . aren&apos;t there other notes sustaining from<br/>earlier soundings?</p><p>&gt; Now its time for me to scratch my head... what are these chords?<br/>&gt; What are the roots? What kind of harmony is this?</p><p>56-63 would be, I presume, 7 steps of 11-tET . . . or 14 steps of 22-<br/>tET . . . which is about 1 cent off a just 14:9. I said I heard a 7:9<br/>on top, but of course one of your voices may easily have had an<br/>octave transposition built into it or something . . .</p></div>
