You could use the<br/>vowel &quot;o&quot; to mean &quot;raise by a comma&quot; and the vowel<br/>&quot;a&quot; to mean &quot;lower by a comma&quot;.  You would combine<br/>these vowels with the standard endings es/is to<br/>make diphthongs, such as &quot;oe&quot; and &quot;ai&quot; rather than<br/>disyllables; these are easier to fit to single<br/>notes, particularly in speed. This would give note<br/>names like (ascending):<br/> Faes, Fes, Foes, Fa, Fais, Fis, Fois</p><p>Please note that these are not *English* diphthongs,<br/>rather, we&apos;d need to give each vowel its Italian or<br/>Latin sound, approximately.</p><p>As the example Chris gave suggests, you could<br/>change the final consonant of the syllable from &quot;s&quot;<br/>to something suggestive of another alteration.<br/>&quot;h&quot; is a poor choice, since it&apos;s hard to distinguish<br/>&quot;Fa&quot; from &quot;Fah&quot;, os let&apos;s use &quot;q&quot; for &quot;quartertone&quot;.<br/>You might even combine them, so using s for semitone<br/>and q for quartertone, you&apos;d have &quot;sq&quot; for &quot;a<br/>semitone and a quatertone&quot;, ie three-quarters of a<br/>tone.  Ignoring commas for the moment, notes near<br/>Fa (ascending) could be:<br/> Fesq, Fes, Feq, Fa, Fiq, Fis, Fisq</p><p>(Note how cleverly I avoided another unwanted<br/>meaning!  Nah, that was just good luck.)</p><p>You could further modify these names by commas,<br/>eg:<br/> Faesq, Fesq, Foesq, Faes, Fes, Foes, Faeq, Feq,<br/>Foeq, ...</p><p>As Chris says, quartertones aren&apos;t too meaningful<br/>in JI, but there are plenty of JI intervals that<br/>are near to the 24th root of 2, and for which<br/>quartertone may be a convenient name in practice.</p><p>Let us know what you come up with!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2006 9:36:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Magnus,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I googled for &quot;gisem&quot; just now and I couldn&apos;t find what problematic<br/>&gt;meaning it has.
