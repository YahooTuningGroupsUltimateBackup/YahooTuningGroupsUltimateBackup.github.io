All of these have the same 5L+4s MOS scale as 14, and it is interesting to see the subtle effect the tuning variations have.  The difference between 14 and 19 is, I think, the subtlest...19&apos;s fifths are better, but 14&apos;s thirds are better; overall, 19 is a little bit less &quot;beaty&quot; but I think the flavor of 14 is mellower and a bit less &quot;strident&quot;.  The biggest difference is between 23 and 24, and to my ears some parts sound better in one while other parts sound better in the other.  It&apos;s quite interesting.  I think I prefer 14 overall, it feels the most &quot;balanced&quot; to me.  I&apos;d be curious to know (if anyone can sit through 4 listens of this fiddly little piece) what others think of the different tunings.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=27095 href="#27095">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2011 9:40:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well,<br/>At the 11 edo class yesterday we discussed a portion one of Erv<br/>Wilson&apos;s diagrams - one that showed the progression of step size from<br/>5 edo through 20 edo - it was called the diatonic / anti-diatonic<br/>spectrum. Basically - a scale like LLLsLLs will reverse to sssLssL as<br/>the size of the fifth (and therefore all intervals) change when your<br/>edo changes. It occurred to be (eureka for me and no doubt &quot;duh&quot; that<br/>is obvious for everyone else) that changing tuning is another<br/>developmental tool. We then sung (I listened actually) Fr&egrave;re Jacques<br/>in each edo from 5 through 20 to &quot;feel&quot; and hear how the step sizes<br/>changed. The tune remain recognizable but took on bizarre<br/>characteristics depending on the edo.</p><p>Now I find this fine composition in 4 edos that I have been looping<br/>for a half hour as I work on improving my 11 edo stick - and<br/>intentional or not - an excellent example of tuning development.</p><p>That is a cool coincidence.
