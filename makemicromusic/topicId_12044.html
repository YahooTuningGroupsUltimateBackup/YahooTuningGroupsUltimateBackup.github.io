Akai S1000 and S3000, giga, SF2, ReCycle, &amp; Vienna into .exs24<br/>in Logic Pro 7.<br/>(but it&apos;s expensive and only for Mac OSX - about $1000);</p><p>Cameleon 5000 is an amazing plug-in for microtuning samples, synths,<br/>effects etc. for Mac &amp; PC and relatively low cost (look out for group<br/>buys/student discounts etc.)<br/>I paid &lt;$100 about two years ago, and they provide regular free<br/>upgrades.</p><p>It microtunes via read and play .ana.tun files. (see recent posting<br/>in various tuning related list for conversion advice from .scl files),<br/>and can read, resynthesise and play almost any audio file format.</p><p>It also offers lotsa free user constructed patches and effects, from<br/>its community pages, and has a readable and comprehensive manual</p><p>All its very flexible features are not immediately obvious, so it has<br/>quite a steep learning curve,<br/>yet if you have experience with old analog hardware synths; you&apos;ll<br/>appreciate the possibilities and be in familiar territory.</p><p>Details are here:</p><p><a href="http://www.camelaudio.com/cameleon5000.php">http://www.camelaudio.com/cameleon5000.php</a></p><p>More details and tuning codes are here:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>Have fun with it!</p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=12045 href="#12045">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 8:01:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Cameleon 5000 is an amazing plug-in for microtuning samples... It microtunes via read and play .tun files and can read, resynthesise and play almost any audio file format.</p><p>Could you clear up something, since you have Chameleon: they say load wav/aiff samples into one of four voice slots - does this mean that for using samples you are only able to load one sampled note, and it spreads it across the entire kbd? I didn&apos;t see anything about loading entire sample sets.</p><p>I agree, it is a pretty deep instrument, very good for atmospheric things as well as morphed melody useage. As for importing samples and using tuning files, this can be done by Rhino and Wusikstation, and CronoX has the added ability to load multiple samples and assign them to key ranges, etc.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
