Yes, it is limited but so is my money. And if there are<br/>other members who are limited by economic constraints then this is a<br/>way of implementing microtonality with a limited budget. With the<br/>aforementioned equipment anyone can have microtonal music playing in<br/>their household 24/7 using the melody jukebox feature of Band-in-a-Box<br/>combined with my musical algorithms implemented on a Kurzweil<br/>synthesizer. This is do-able in real life situations; and a practical<br/>application of microtonality which will be difficult to ignore or even<br/>devalue when it is realised how easy it is to set up. Perhaps some of<br/>the more wealthy members of MakeMicroMusic will appreciate the<br/>EFFICIENCY of my simple-minded methodology.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2008 11:45:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert thomas martin&quot;<br/>&lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   From Robert.

IIRC, we had both scenarios for<br/>PC and Mac, and one setup required only the computer someone already<br/>owned, and another scenario was to also use a MIDI keyboard for input<br/>(not sounds, just the MIDI keystrokes).</p><p>So since money is an issue, you might want to do a little more<br/>investigation. I can&apos;t imagine the choices are smaller now, but<br/>probably there are even more apps available. I&apos;m involved in other<br/>projects at the moment, but I wanted you to know that I sympathize<br/>with the concept of limited funds, and on this list, at least at one<br/>point, we had found solutions that cost anywhere from nothing to very<br/>little.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
