Don&apos;t &quot;out&quot; our operatives!</p><p>[Seriously, I can&apos;t think of a composer&apos;s group which needs<br/>&quot;microtonalists&quot; and alternate-tuning enthusiasts more desperately. It&apos;s<br/>way past time for alternate tunings to become mainstream thought for<br/>composers/performers.
