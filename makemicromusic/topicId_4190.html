We shouldn&apos;t even call it that, since<br/>that detracts...</p><p>Although seemingly Chris never mentions why he calls the piece<br/>_Sand_... or at least I can&apos;t recall mention of it, for *me* it<br/>reminds me of walking on the beach and encountering various colorful<br/>objects by chance.  Certain sections have a sense of continuity that<br/>seem almost like a horizon-like beach.</p><p>My wife and I both listened to this work (a bottle of wine can also<br/>add to the experience -- one is adequate) and enjoyed it<br/>tremendously.  She mentioned what she considered the &quot;random&quot; nature<br/>of it, and not in a deprecating way...</p><p>I explained to her some of Chris&apos; ideas of &quot;Flat Form&quot; which would,<br/>of necessity, include randomness but actually, after thinking about<br/>it a bit I have a couple of questions about the work:</p><p>1) Is it true that Chris goes to elaborate lengths in order<br/>to &quot;achieve&quot; randomness?  That seems a bit curious, although I am not<br/>opposed to it...</p><p>2) Certain sections *seemed* to have a compositional continuity.  Is<br/>that intentional, or did it just work out that way??  Personally, I<br/>feel that adds to the piece, but since my *own* pieces tend to<br/>operate along those lines, it&apos;s not surprising I would feel that<br/>way...  I, personally, like some of the *continuous* sections, maybe<br/>about in the *third* section...</p><p>I especially enjoyed the &quot;ragtime&quot; section in about the 4th section.<br/>Very cool.  Seemed to be abstract enough to work into the whole well.</p><p>Great job, and lots of fun.  It&apos;s also interesting to think about how<br/>this thing was assembled, although I must admit I only understand a<br/>part of that...</p><p>Nice the entire thing is up on a website, too for &quot;easy access...&quot;</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
