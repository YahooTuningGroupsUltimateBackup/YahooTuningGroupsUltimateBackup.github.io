For this<br/>reason, the effect of music is so very much more powerful and penetrating than is<br/>that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music<br/>of the essence.&quot; - Schopenhauer, _The World as Will and Representation_</p><p>&quot;...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ...<br/>improvisation is about a constant change.&quot; - Steve Beresford</p><p>improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the assumptions<br/>that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; - John Berndt</p><p> &quot;We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dream. Wandering by<br/>lone sea breakers, and sitting by desolate streams. World losers and world<br/>forsakers, for whom the pale moon gleams.

The author offers neither proof nor evidence of the &quot;most&quot; descriptor, and the article focusses on composers who are primarily electronic or part of a younger crowd.</p><p>Electronic scoring has been going strong for at least a decade - the Roland S-760 sampler alone was a big boon to them. But many, many scores are still recorded live, even if the mock-ups - which, believe me, can be amazing emulations - are done by the composer in his project studio.</p><p>I have a number of friends in the film music industry, and many of my colleagues drive up from San Diego to LA to record on sessions; just recently, &quot;Legally Blonde 2&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, and that recent Harrison Ford cop movie.</p><p>The trend will continue, until there is more and more synth/sample score material, maybe entirely replacing acoustic players. That&apos;s life. For the moment, even rockers like Danny Elfman know the value of a scoring session where you can ask for changes from players and it happens instantaneously, rather than having to re-program a sequence or patch.</p><p>But not for long, I bet.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
