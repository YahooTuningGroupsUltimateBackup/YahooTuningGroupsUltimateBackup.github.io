So, somebody is listening, and my philosophy is that you never know where a CD will wind up. As a kid in St.Louis, I used to sit there and get my mind blown by the new sounds of Jeff  Beck, Clapton, Page, the Doors etc; maybe there&apos;s some young folks out there hearing microtonal music for the first time, because of the CD&apos;s floating around, and saying that they would like to do that. You never know where the next Hendrix is coming from...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div>
