(Not saying it can&apos;t be done at all, just curious).</p><p>Jeff also sounds pretty particular about the quality of the sounds, and may be looking for a good piano reproduction - is that bundled with Logic?</p><p>Lastly, there is a sizeable and growing number of VST synths and samplers that will utilize any tuning, and that means they can be used in any host, not just Logic. I eagerly await the day that a full-featured sampler will come along with full microtuning, but in the interim we&apos;ve got more solutions than we ever have had before.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
