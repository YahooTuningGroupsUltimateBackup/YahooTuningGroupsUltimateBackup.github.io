The tuning is very exotic and listenable, too. It struck me as a kind of more tersely polyphonic Scriabin-like piece with an Arabic touch. Very nice.</p><p>I have to say my favorite might be Soressa Gardner&apos;s for it&apos;s all around creation-of-a-universe-in-itself, but I think Monroe Golden&apos;s piece is awfully original, and there&apos;s an &apos;ecstatic rush&apos; quality to it quite unlike any of the other entries...it also is extremely polished in the sonics department. Ig&apos;s piece is really trippy and fun, and has a great climax; placed just right. I think it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to the best of Igs work, for instance pick a track on &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot;, but it grows on me more and more.</p><p>All of these pieces sounded *fantastic* on the 29th. They were all aided by the dark, and the quality of the 5.1 sound system, which also has a real nice deep subwoofer. It was a real pleasure to experience *all* of them. I told everyone about the downloadability of the non-finalists, and there was real interest and curiosity there, too.</p><p>Anyway, back to the finalist group--I think I&apos;ve not heard anything quite like Soressa Gardner&apos;s piece in terms of gorgeous Zen-like tranquility, sensitivity to timbre, atmosphere, and real attention to foreground and background layers. I&apos;m going to study this piece for quite some time--there&apos;s a lot to learn there. There is not an extraneous note or sound in that piece; it&apos;s simple and elegant like a Japanese ink. Many people commented on this piece in particular as really _speaking_ to them after the concert. That piece is extremely special in all of these ways, and very evocative. Listen to all those tiny details, they are simply exquisite and delicious...</p><p>I&apos;m also fond, for the same reasons, of James Wyness&apos;s piece. It really is a beautiful &apos;dronescape&apos; type piece, a model of its kind, and to me, very much in the mold of Kraig Grady&apos;s excellent work on his &apos;Stolen Stars&apos; CD.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;d love all of your thoughts on all the rest of the pieces. To me, there&apos;s a lot to be inspired by in the whole body of submissions.</p><p>AKJ</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here it is, sort of:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://untwelve.org/2010_competition.html">http://untwelve.org/2010_competition.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having listened to the winners and runners up, always excepting Igs, it seems to me Shaahin Mohajeri is the best of the lot.

I&apos;m not sure if I was on the right track or<br/>not, because you can probably come up with different metrics for the<br/>accuracy of a triad like 8:9:10 that will yield different results.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2011 7:48:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gnee, refresh your browser.

The deal wasn&apos;t very specific as to what he&apos;d teach me, and he turned out to be somewhat reluctant to get into any kind of tonal theory or anything like it. He had a lot to say about Greek philosophy and other unrelated subjects that could be very compelling to people without deadlines. He did coach me a little on overtone singing, which was awesome. But he suggested several times I just study composition and not worry about tuning. Good point; most of the compositions, and thus most of the great compositions, that have been created in the last 400 years, well, we all know the end of that sentence. They weren&apos;t particularly microtonal. But it was frustrating for me, with a relatively cerebral approach, to accept why he couldn&apos;t explain any of the awesome things he had done in Chrysalid Requiem. It seemed like he had something against me, or wanted to keep his secrets. But maybe, in fact, he did everything intuitively and couldn&apos;t rightly explain it. I&apos;m not sure.

I have a book of<br/>songs with only four chords.  And the four chosen ones are:<br/>G, C, D, Em.  They work fine in 5-limit just intonation.</p><p>The basic law of harmony I got from Margo is to resolve by<br/>contrary stepwise motion.  A good 7-limit trick is 5:6:7<br/>moving to 4:5:6 with the middle note held constant.  You<br/>can also reveal the otonal root by resolving a 6:7:9 onto<br/>its 4:5:6, which means a downward fifth in the functional<br/>root motion.  The other direction is weaker, but helps the<br/>listener appreciate the logic of the 6:7:9.</p><p>In magic temperament, the comma pump sounds good to me.  I<br/>used it in my 60x60 contribution (&lt;60 seconds, subset of<br/>60-equal) and the chorus of &quot;Golden Age&quot;.  I&apos;ve also looked<br/>at 11-limit harmony in Magic, including the pun where the<br/>tritone of a dominant seventh chord becomes an 11:8, which<br/>entails tempering out 100:99.    It was sounding pretty<br/>good, but I didn&apos;t finish anything to demonstrate it.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div>
