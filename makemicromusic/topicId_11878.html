I also believe that hearing intervals that have never been heard before can elicit feelings that have never been felt before, which is one reason why I&apos;m interested in microtonal music.</p><p>One meaning of the word sublimation is when a substance changes from one state to another state without passing through the state in between. For example, when frozen water changes to fog or mist without becoming liquid first.

I&apos;m surprised that it sounds thin to you as well as the lack of sparkle, but it&apos;s probably a somewhat subjective thing; I&apos;m probably focused in on the more subtle aspect of the sound.  It may be like what I&apos;ve experienced listening to the music of Phill Niblock, where at first it seems very static, but then you start to notice all the subtle stuff happening in the harmonics.  If you didn&apos;t listen with headphones, I recommend trying it that way.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m accustomed to listening to the WAV file that comes out of Csound, which is is pretty high resolution (48kHz sampling rate, 3072kpbs bitrate, 32-bit samples) compared to the MP3 and OGG encodings.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Dave,<br/>&gt; &gt; I like the way the piece builds and varies in intensity.<br/>&gt; The sound was surprisingly thinner than I expected,<br/>&gt; given that you used so many simultaneous oscillators,<br/>&gt; and your &quot;scintillating harmonics&quot; comment had led &gt; me to expect a bit more &quot;sparkle&quot;.

The main idea of if is that you record/synthesize<br/>an audio file that has spatialization information embedded in it (what<br/>they call a &quot;b-format&quot; signal).  Then, if someone has an ambisonic<br/>decoder, the music will play back *using his/her specific speaker<br/>setup.*  So the same file could be played back with 2 speakers or 102<br/>:)</p><p>Of course, the obvious problem is that nobody has an ambisonic decoder<br/>sitting in their living room!  But if you&apos;re composing in csound (or<br/>probably most other synthesis languages) you can do the encoding and<br/>decoding *inside the render*, so that out comes great-sounding<br/>spatialization.  Of course, that means you would have to re-render for<br/>each speaker arrangment.</p><p>Also, ambisonic was originally designed to use equi-distant speaker<br/>setups (quad, hex, whatever), and I&apos;m having a hard time getting a<br/>straight answer as to how easily it will decode to non-equal setups<br/>(dolby surround, for instance).</p><p>Also (again), even if you&apos;re not using csound-or-something-like-it,<br/>there are probably ambisonic vst-plugins, or you can look at<br/><a href="http://www.muse.demon.co.uk/vspace/vspace.html">http://www.muse.demon.co.uk/vspace/vspace.html</a>  which I think is using<br/>an ambisonic algorithm, but I haven&apos;t used it.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>&gt; But in future, after GigaHertz PCs, I hope my<br/>&gt; compositional paradigm will evolve into: Think up new<br/>&gt; music, try to record it before you forget it, get the<br/>&gt; machine to play it _exactly_ the way you &quot;heard&quot; it,<br/>&gt; share with others.</p><p>Hm, it seems to me that the exactitude of expressive digital<br/>performance has less to do with computation speed, and more to do with<br/>either intuitive computer interfaces or INTENSIVE tweaking.  If you&apos;ve<br/>ever tried to program expressions into a csound score, you know what<br/>I&apos;m talking about!  A third option is to use artificial intelligence<br/>to give the computer the tools to interpret a score in sensible ways,<br/>although that seems more suited to the performance or period music<br/>where there already exist common-practice interpretive rules.</p><p>I really don&apos;t believe in absolute control for my music though.

Made a huge difference!</p><p>I did hear more of the changing of the higher<br/>overtones at this volume level, but I still don&apos;t<br/>think I&apos;d call them &quot;scintillating&quot;; they&apos;re bright<br/>enough, and the changes can be quite rapid, but<br/>(at least in my ear) they are not discrete<br/>sparkles or flashes; rather, they vary quite<br/>smoothly.
