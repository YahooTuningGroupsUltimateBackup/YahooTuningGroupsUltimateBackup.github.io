Easy.</p><p>5) To prevent any glitching, have instrument copies on several tracks, so there&apos;s time for the pitch-bend to happen inaudibly.</p><p>I&apos;m finding that this is accurate enough, easy to do, and allows for any and all effects that I could want. &nbsp;I stress how easy it is, once<br/>you&apos;ve made a little pitch-bend table, and taped it near your computer monitor where you can see it.</p><p>If there&apos;s any limitation on accuracy, I&apos;m really not hearing it, as I test various moves away from 1/1. &nbsp;There&apos;s a little inaccuracy because of the sampled instruments, anyway. &nbsp;A little slow chorusing is ok, here and there. Can be minimized by choosing which samples, and simplifying the instruments.</p><p>Technically, at least, I&apos;m a happy-enough camper.</p><p>Just showing my working method for anyone who&apos;s interested. &nbsp;Not interested in arguing about it or anything else. &nbsp;</p><p>It took a while to really settle on this way of working, and I&apos;ve not found anything better for the way I think.</p><p>Heck, I may have posted this exact method a while ago and forgotten about it. &nbsp;</p><p>[/thread ]</p><p>________________________________<br/> From: Caleb Morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt;<br/>To: &quot;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2012 9:18 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Re: three little pieces</p><p>&nbsp;<br/>...</p><p>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>Yahoo!
