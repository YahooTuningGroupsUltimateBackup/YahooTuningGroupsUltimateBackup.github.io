In real life<br/>they may or may not be well represented by Gaussian distributions, and<br/>I would guess their parameters would depend on lots of things:<br/>performer, of course, but also which finger of which hand, tempo,<br/>complexity of the music, style of the music... time of day... number<br/>of beers consumed... well, you get the idea.</p><p>Having done that it would in principle be relatively easy to generate<br/>new MIDI files with ersatz humanness generated by such a set of<br/>distributions and parameters (&quot;Landowska, 1948, slightly tipsy...&quot;)</p><p>And then you can do a Turing test on the results...</p><p>- Rich Holmes</p></div><h3><a id=9266 href="#9266">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
