I&apos;m not sure what it might sound like, but its choice for<br/>a Scala example and the feedback I got on one posting that it seemed<br/>to fit the music have led me to make it a &quot;standard.&quot;</p><p>Maybe if I explain how I create these examples, you&apos;ll understand why<br/>your feedback is so important and valuable:</p><p>          1. Often I may get an idea while playing or improvising<br/>             at the synthesizer keyboard, anything from a quick<br/>             two-sonority progression to a piece;</p><p>          2. Having come up with the music, I code it using a text<br/>             editor (GNU Emacs) in the Scala format for an example<br/>             file, much as one might write down a traditional score;</p><p>          3. After generating a MIDI file with Scala, I have no<br/>             hardware or software to play it, but I can convert<br/>             the MIDI file to text and proofread the notes and<br/>             pitchbend messages (conveniently converted to cents<br/>             by a macro in Emacs using the GNU Emacs Calc program).</p><p>Your feedback not only suggested that GM &quot;Reed Organ&quot; might be better<br/>for this kind of 5-limit adaptive JI -- on the TX-802, I have an<br/>&quot;archiregal&quot; using a (non-GM) voice called &quot;Oboe&quot; that reminds me of a<br/>crumhorn with a very prominent fifth partial, I would say -- but<br/>spurred me on to actually look on the Web and find a list of GM<br/>voices.</p><p>The _regal_, I should explain, is a double reed organ of the<br/>16th-century era sounding quite crumhorn-like -- &quot;buzzy,&quot; as the<br/>crumhorn is often known in some circles -- and although I&apos;m not sure<br/>whether this kind of organ was built for fifthtone music, I&apos;d call it<br/>a sonorous idea whose time has come, whether realized through<br/>traditional or digital technologies.</p><p>Of course, your &quot;Reed Organ&quot; suggestion also recalls the harmonium of<br/>Bosanquet and Helmholtz/Ellis and others, so it has rich associations.</p><p>I wonder which GM instruments Dave Keenan might recommend as a<br/>connoisseur of JI and near-JI sonorities with their &quot;locking in&quot; of<br/>partials?</p><p>Anyway, now that I have the list of GM instruments, I should be able<br/>to do some creative instrumentation, with lots of advice and feedback<br/>encouraged.</p><p>Here&apos;s the Vicentino cadence in two GM &quot;Reed Organ&quot; versions, the<br/>first slower and the second a bit faster:</p><p>&quot;Reed Organ,&quot; slower: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav005.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav005.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&quot;Reed Organ,&quot; faster: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav006.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav006.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Another very historically appropriate timbre with a bright fifth<br/>partial (at least if the GM instrument is like its model) is, of<br/>course, the archicembalo itself, or &quot;superharpsichord,&quot; basically a<br/>harpsichord with lots of notes per octave (36 or 38 for Vicentino), so<br/>here&apos;s a GM harpsichord version in the same two tempi:</p><p>&quot;Harpsichord,&quot; slower: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav007.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav007.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&quot;Harpsichord,&quot; faster: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav008.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav008.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Paul, please let me emphasize how your posts and discussions on<br/>&quot;adaptive JI&quot; have really lent me encouragement in this, and it&apos;s very<br/>fitting that your musical advice about instrumentation and timbre<br/>should help now in making these examples more effective.</p><p>Thank you, and please enjoy -- while feeling free to offer more<br/>constructive suggestions like this.</p><p>With peace and friendship,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2001 2:27:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Margo -- the new timbres work much better!</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2001 11:50:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;m pleased, with Mary&apos;s creative impetus<br/>and Paul&apos;s very helpful feedback about timbres, to share this first<br/>MIDI version of my _Invocatio in Quarto Tono_ or _Invocation in the<br/>Fourth Mode_ (i.e. Hypophrygian, the plagal form of the Phyrgian mode<br/>centered in its untransposed form on E).</p><p>This piece involves &quot;enharmonicism,&quot; or the use of fifthtones, and<br/>although Vicentino&apos;s adaptive tuning for &quot;perfect fifths&quot; at a pure<br/>ratio of 3:2, here realized using a 62-note scale based on 1/4-comma<br/>meantone (pure 5:4 major thirds) with two 31-note cycles at 1/4-comma<br/>apart.</p><p>MIDI: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Paul, thank you so much for your &quot;Reed Organ&quot; recommendation as a<br/>General MIDI timbre.

I&apos;ll hook up the laptop tomorrow, fire up the sequencer and play &quot;Invocation&quot; through A22 (though I am going to have to get SoundQuest, at Rick&apos;s suggestion: I just can&apos;t go through life with &apos;stock&apos; patches, and I&apos;ll gladly post them to share with other TX-802 folks).</p><p>I&apos;m happy this is all happening.

I ask myself<br/>how you might approach synthesized music as someone with a background<br/>in handcrafted instruments of a unique kind. One musician tells me<br/>that he can approach a keyboard in a better way because of his feel<br/>for playing the cello, and I wonder if this kind of metaphor might<br/>apply.</p><p>David, your words are about the most moving I could ask for, and<br/>indeed this piece has a special &quot;polydimensional&quot; aspect for me, but<br/>your experience lends to it a perspective and imagery taking shape in<br/>your own creative act of listening. Thank you for such a gift.</p><p>Mary, your orchestration idea is something I&apos;d love to hear; but from<br/>hearing some of your music, I can predict it will be unique and<br/>awesome. I&apos;d love to hear your &quot;Aria&quot; version of Colonna&apos;s passage<br/>also, maybe on CD or cassette.</p><p>For now, maybe I should explain that _Invocatio_ is a complete piece,<br/>something like the organ preludes or Psalm-tone settings of the era<br/>around 1600 which sets the general style of the music. However, you<br/>could do what has often been done in recordings of 15th-16th century<br/>music: combine a few such pieces into a set, maybe a few minutes in<br/>all. Of course, this means that I have to write more of these pieces!<br/>-- and there&apos;s at least one that I&apos;ve been meaning to do for a long<br/>time. How&apos;s that for a bit of a welcome push?</p><p>Paul, if I coded correctly from my ASCII score (which I&apos;ll post after<br/>prudently proofing it when a bit less tired), fifths and thirds should<br/>be just except for a few sonorities around suspensions where I went<br/>with usual meantone intervals to avoid complications like shifts in<br/>the middle of sustained notes. While I proofed the pitchbend messages<br/>and they _looked_ correct at the time, my known fallibility is a<br/>factor not to be dismissed out of hand &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>One approach might be to go over the score together, and see where the<br/>beats are occurring. A different approach is to check those pitchbend<br/>messages again, since that&apos;s about the most objective measure of<br/>whether I&apos;ve coded correctly, at least.</p><p>From your posts on the Colonna example, Monz, I wonder if your<br/>software could check the &quot;justness&quot; of sonorities in a MIDI file<br/>easily?</p><p>It&apos;s very important to me to get it right, and that means precisely<br/>the kind of feedback that you&apos;ve offered, Paul.</p><p>I&apos;d much rather learn about any glitches now than later, and one of<br/>the nicest things about this group is that we can join in some<br/>creative &quot;debugging.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively, with peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 5:03:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 26, 2001 11:50 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [MakeMicroMusic] New composition -- Invocatio (MIDI)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This piece involves &quot;enharmonicism,&quot; or the use of fifthtones, and<br/>&gt; although Vicentino&apos;s adaptive tuning for &quot;perfect fifths&quot; at a pure<br/>&gt; ratio of 3:2, here realized using a 62-note scale based on 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; meantone (pure 5:4 major thirds) with two 31-note cycles at 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MIDI: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Oh well...

I though Margo was simply asking you to verify<br/>that most of the vertical triads are in exact JI (to within one<br/>cawapu or whatever). Also, if the 27 different pitches fall within<br/>the 36 of Vicentino&apos;s second tuning of 1555, then the latter might be<br/>a better descriptor of the tuning of the piece, rather than the 62-<br/>tone description . . . but who cares, as long as it sounds good?</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 11:04:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Paul and Monz and everyone.</p><p>To keep this brief, I should confirm that _Invocatio_ uses some notes<br/>not included in either of Vicentino&apos;s two 38-note tunings as designed<br/>for an ideal version of his keyboard instruments with two 19-note<br/>manuals -- 36 notes in practice, since he could fit only 17 keys per<br/>octave on the upper manual.</p><p>Therefore I find it simplest to describe the tuning for this piece as<br/>based on my full 62-note system, with two 31-note cycles of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone (pure major thirds) at 1/4-comma apart.</p><p>Most specifically, neither of Vicentino&apos;s tunings include just<br/>sonorities on &quot;enharmonic&quot; steps a diesis or &quot;fifthtone&quot; above usual<br/>ones, for example A*3-E*&apos;4-A*4-C#*5. Here, as in my score recently<br/>posted, an asterisk (*) shows a note raised by a fifthtone or diesis<br/>of 128:125 (~41.06 cents), while an apostrophe (&apos;) shows a note raised<br/>by 1/4 comma (~5.38 cents) to achieve pure vertical concords.[1]</p><p>Applying both inflections at the same time takes us beyond Vicentino&apos;s<br/>tunings, although it can viewed simply as a logical further step<br/>combining the features of the two tunings: a complete cycle of<br/>fifthtone steps _and_ adaptive JI, or &quot;enharmonic adaptive JI,&quot; as I<br/>term it.</p><p>However, since the focus of this group is on xenharmonic composing and<br/>musicmaking, I might add that I play this piece in its usual meantone<br/>version (with the regular tempered intervals) in a very useful subset<br/>of Vicentino&apos;s first tuning: a 24-note system with two 12-note manuals<br/>a fifthtone or diesis apart, here 128:125 or ~41.06 cents.</p><p>Simply by disregarding the adaptive JI or &quot;quartercomma&quot; signs (&apos;),<br/>you can read the score as I play it in this accustomed tuning, with<br/>the lower manual in Eb-G# and the upper in Eb*-G#*.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/143">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/143</a>&gt;</p><p>This keyboard arrangement is reflected in my notation, borrowed in<br/>part from Vicentino (who uses a dot above a note, my *, to show its<br/>raising by a fifthtone). I call this a &quot;regularized keyboard,&quot; since<br/>each keyboard has the same arrangements of steps of intervals.</p><p>To produce adaptive JI versions of pieces originally composed in this<br/>24-note system, we actually need only an additional 24 notes, or a<br/>subset of 48 notes in all out of the complete set of 62 produced by<br/>two full 31-note meantone cycles.</p><p>Anyway, from the viewpoint of this group, it may be relevant to note<br/>how my experience with a 24-note keyboard can shape both my usual<br/>compositional approach and notation for this kind of enharmonic music<br/>in a &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; style inspired by Vicentino.</p><p>Doing the &quot;adaptive JI,&quot; in contrast, is mostly a process of adding<br/>the right &quot;quartercommas&quot; to make tempered concords just, with a bit<br/>of judgment exercised now and then in places where these small<br/>inflections could cause complications.</p><p>Now for the &quot;puzzle&quot; mentioned in recent messages.</p><p>As far as MakeMicroMusic is concerned, Monz, I would say that your<br/>confirmation that the notes used in my MIDI are the ones intended for<br/>adaptive JI is indeed an artful solution of a practical puzzle, and<br/>one for which I am much indebted, especially at a time when you are<br/>preparing for your trip to Italy and other parts of Europe.</p><p>However, on crazy_music, I did post the piece as a kind of &quot;puzzle,&quot;<br/>one involving the writings of Ivor Darreg:</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/732">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/732</a>&gt;</p><p>For this group, Monz, I would say that your solution to the &quot;puzzle&quot;<br/>of verifying the note set is a model not only of skill and patience,<br/>but of generosity; together, we can share knowledge, techniques, and a<br/>bit of sheer inspiration mixed with much mutual encouragement.</p><p>Also, Paul, thanks both for your initial query about the beating --<br/>something it might be good to caution people can happen even with<br/>theoretically pure intervals -- and for your supportive remarks about<br/>my use of a subset of the full 62-note adaptive JI system I have<br/>described, and will present at more length on the Alternate Tuning<br/>List.</p><p>--------------------<br/>Note for the curious<br/>--------------------</p><p>1. Vicentino&apos;s first system includes a complete 31-note meantone<br/>cycle, providing &quot;enharmonic&quot; sonorities on steps a diesis or<br/>fifthtone from the usual ones, e.g. A*3-E*4-A*4-C#*4, plus five or<br/>seven extra keys supporting a few just sonorities on common diatonic<br/>steps (D&apos;,E&apos;,G&apos;,A&apos;, B&apos; -- and also F&apos; and C&apos; in a 38-note version).<br/>His second system includes the same 19 notes of regular meantone on<br/>the lower manual (Gb-B#), with all the notes on the second manual<br/>tuned to pure fifths with these -- the same tuning a quartercomma<br/>higher (Gb&apos;-B#&apos;), or all these notes except E#&apos; and B#&apos; on his 36-note<br/>instruments. Neither tuning includes quartercomma keys on enharmonic<br/>steps such as E*&apos; in A*3-E*&apos;4-A*4-C#*5. While scholars have at times<br/>disagreed on the interpretation of assorted features of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>two tunings, this last assertion at least seems undisputed.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2001 12:40:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, I&apos;ve read with pleasure the feedback you&apos;ve gotten on your new<br/>sequence,</p><p>   <a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a></p><p>Today I finally got the chance to listen to it, and it&apos;s lovely!

That larger<br/>number explains my reaction for sure!  It&apos;s strongest, to my ear, in the<br/>transition between measures 20 and 21 (around 26 seconds in the<br/>sequence).  Here, C*5 falls to C&apos;5, and E*4 falls to E&apos;4, very<br/>noticeable and something I need to get used to.  Again, as the piece<br/>concludes, between measures 25 and 27 E*4 falls to E&apos;4, and I hear that<br/>as a bit of a &quot;strained&quot; sound (to my unaccustomed ear).</p><p>&gt;This can be startling to listeners in the 16th century or 21st<br/>&gt;century, definitely &quot;xenharmonic,&quot; and something that got Vicentino<br/>&gt;very mixed reviews.</p><p>Startling, that&apos;s the word!  I guess what&apos;s not clear to me, without<br/>further analysis, is whether the &apos;*&apos; notes are pushed higher by a<br/>falling stack of major thirds, or whether this is style in its purest<br/>form, a conscious decision where one could have gone either way.  I&apos;m<br/>guessing it&apos;s actually the latter; it that true?</p><p>&gt;Vincenzo Galilei, for example, a noted lutenist and theorist who wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt;at all afraid to take on the musical establishment of the time (much<br/>&gt;like his son, the astronomer Galileo, with the science establishment),<br/>&gt;concluded that &quot;the enharmonic diesis is contrary to the nature of<br/>&gt;singing and disproportionate with our sense of hearing.&quot;</p><p>Har!  Those were hot times in Old Italy, no?  I&apos;m reluctant to side<br/>against Vicentino, however, at least without giving my ear a chance to<br/>get used to the effect.</p><p>&gt;Vicentino, interestingly, gives performers the option of ignoring his<br/>&gt;fifthtone shifts, something which would permit his enharmonic pieces<br/>&gt;to be played on usual 12-note meantone keyboards without the extra<br/>&gt;notes a fifthtone apart.</p><p>And, at least in theory, whether or not the fifths were corrected by<br/>1/4 comma or not.</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s a link to my score, where the fifthtone steps are indicated by<br/>&gt;an asterisk (*) raising a note by 128:125 in 1/4-comma meantone, or by<br/>&gt;1/31 octave in 31-tET.</p><p>&gt;&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/143">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/143</a>&gt;</p><p>Oh good, now it&apos;s much clearer...</p><p>&gt;If you&apos;re reducing the piece to 12-tET before doing the adaptive<br/>&gt;retuning, then I suspect that in effect you&apos;re doing just what<br/>&gt;Vicentino discusses: converting an enharmonic piece with fifthtone<br/>&gt;inflections to one with more familiar diatonic and chromatic steps.</p><p>Yes, I think so.  What I _don&apos;t_ have is a 12-note meantone rendition<br/>of the piece, however.</p><p>&gt;In fact, quite apart from the adaptive tuning or adaptive JI aspects,<br/>&gt;this kind of playing around with different versions could be a great<br/>&gt;way to let people try out what Renaissance or Xeno-Renaissance music<br/>&gt;is all about. We could have versions of the same piece with or without<br/>&gt;fifthtone shifts or progressions, and with or without adaptive tuning<br/>&gt;or JI as opposed to usual meantone or 31-tET.</p><p>&gt;Please post those retunings, and thank you for a dialogue through<br/>&gt;words and music which brings together 16th-century and 21st-century<br/>&gt;approaches to adaptive tuning and JI.</p><p>Thanks, Margo.
