Our anticipation is certainly as great,<br/>if not greater, than yours, as we prepare a performance of<br/>new songs, old favorites, and a variety of other wonders<br/>including Dax&apos;s Portable Picturebox, which has been amazing the<br/>inhabitants of Chicago for the last two years.  We have more<br/>members and more new instruments than ever before.  Ladies and<br/>Gentlemen, please join us in this tremendous affair at the Anno<br/>Domini Gallery, also featuring performances by the inimitable<br/>Jason Webley of Seattle Washington, and the Foundry Field Recordings<br/>of Columbia Missouri.

Easy to do, since Yahoo puts lots of cruft down there... And the gigs on the band&apos;s home page are all old. They&apos;ve been on hiatus for a while...
