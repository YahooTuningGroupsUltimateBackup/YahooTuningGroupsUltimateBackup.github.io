If anyone is in need of a rocky tone<br/>  for some song, let me know and I&apos;ll put the tone up in the<br/>  files section for you till you download it.</p><p>  Stephen</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2005 6:35:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot;<br/>&lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>   I transfered the rock beat from my old Casio<br/>   into my computer using Audacity.

Read the online help that is accessed through the menu, and also spend some time reading the Audacity manual that I sent you the link to. This, and many other questions, are all answered there, and it really is a good thing to spend some time getting to know these programs on your own.</p><p>To use an effect, you have to select something to use it on. Select a portion or all of the sound file, by using your mouse and click/dragging (or any other method they suggest in the help files), and once your selection is done (you&apos;ll see the waveform highlighted), then you can apply any of the many effects, including tempo shifting.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2005 4:33:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Jon</p><p> &quot;&quot;To use an effect, you have to select something to use it on.
