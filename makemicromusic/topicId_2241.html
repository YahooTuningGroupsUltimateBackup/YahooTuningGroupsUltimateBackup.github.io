For a couple years I thought it<br/>was Louise Harrison, George&sup1;s sister.  They call her Lou.  I ran into her at<br/>Beatlefest once.  Literally.  Well actually she ran into me as far as<br/>accidents go.  I didn&sup1;t even realize who it was at first.  I was getting a<br/>little tired of all the Brits doing this so I stopped her as she was about<br/>to run me over in the lobby, and said &sup3;hey you know this is America, you<br/>have to walk on the RIGHT SIDE of the hall!!!&sup2;  But people do that.  You<br/>notice that in NYC a lot.  People always walk on the right side of the hall,<br/>or the right side of the sidewalk.  In some cases, the walking traffic on<br/>either side of the street is one way in either direction.  Do they do that<br/>in Boston?  Indianapolis didn&sup1;t really have sidewalks... Anytime I walked<br/>along the side of the road people would slow down and stare, finally I asked<br/>someone who STOPPED and approached me, said they probably all think your car<br/>broke down like I did.  I didn&sup1;t have a car.  I almost broke my ankle on the<br/>lack of sidewalks though.  But at least I wrote some music while I was<br/>there.  Indianapolis, not Beatlefest.  Ugh.  Speaking of which, another two<br/>weeks and I&sup1;m going to be there for the weekend.  Beatlefest, not<br/>Indianapolis.  I don&sup1;t like that, instead of just having an open tribute to<br/>George they&sup1;re actually charging $20 for the added event.  Probably lots of<br/>people walking on the wrong side of the hall again.  It&sup1;s the OCD, things<br/>like that bother me.  Well at least I know who Lou Harrison is now in case<br/>she bumps into me again.  With my luck, I&sup1;ll probably bump into Wendy<br/>Carlos.</p><p>Marc</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
