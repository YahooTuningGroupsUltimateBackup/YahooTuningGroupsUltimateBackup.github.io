In the original form,<br/>all the parts start in unison or at octaves (or more generally<br/>non octaves, whateve is the interval of equivalence).</p><p>Then the first, fastest part plays its seed above that unison / octave,<br/>as a passing note. The second part then plays its second note,<br/>with the first part joining it to start a new seed.</p><p>That unison of second and first part is a poitn of rest, but also<br/>a passing note with respect to the third part.</p><p>When the second part finishes its seed, the third part moves on to<br/>its next note, where it is joined by the first two parts, so<br/>now the three parts are all playig a unison / octave passing note<br/>with respect to the fourth part..</p><p>So it goes on. When the last part goes onto its second note,<br/>then it is still felt as an intermediate note because the seed<br/>has just started, and there is lots still to go.</p><p>Even wtih one part only playing, one hears some kind of<br/>pattern superimposed from the first notes of each seed,<br/>which gives a kind of counterpoint to the tune.</p><p>YOu can hear lots of examples in real audio format at<br/><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/index.htm">http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/index.htm</a><br/>or play them in FTS.</p><p>For instance, the marimba with string quartet has a very straightforward<br/>fractal tune with the seed just 0 1 0 in scale degrees<br/>in the five parts - it is a kind of demo of the idea to show<br/>how it works.</p><p>The Basson solo with harp celesta and glockenspiel<br/>one has a fractal tune, but with the parts playing notes from<br/>any of the layers of ornamentation rather than in strict<br/>succession, and the result is quite an intriguing<br/>feeling of counterpoint - but actually it is still based<br/>on this passing notes / octaves / unison idea. So,<br/>nearly all the fractal tunes are based on it in<br/>one way or another.</p><p>For an example in mp3 format (which is best to hear how<br/>they were when I made them, or use an SB LIve!):</p><p><a href="http://mp3.com.au/FractalTuneSmithy/Windchimesscale/">http://mp3.com.au/FractalTuneSmithy/Windchimesscale/</a></p><p>All the notes of the seed are the same length, however the notes<br/>are played just a little faster as they get higher in pitch,<br/>- this effect is not very pronounced. It also uses<br/>an echo effect - each phrase staccato as it has<br/>alternate rests and notes, and then if the slower<br/>seed has a rest, the faster seed plays repeats the<br/>previous seed again quietly, and if you have several<br/>simultaneous rests in the parts, the top part will play<br/>very quietly. So, it keeps varying in volume - but not in<br/>a dramatic way either, all quite gentle.</p><p>Now, one can go on to do the same thing with non octave scales.<br/>Another idea is to have the parts at some other interval<br/>rather than the octave</p><p>If one has a scale like</p><p>1/1 6/5 11/8 3/2 7/4 2/1.</p><p>which I&grave;ve been exploring recently, one can try placing the<br/>parts three notes apart in the scale like this:</p><p>1/1  6/5  11/8  3/2  7/4  2/1  12/5  11/4  3/1 7/2  4/1  24/5  11/2</p><p>A                B              C               D               E</p><p>so A:B is 3/2, B:C is 8/5, C:D is 35/24, D:E is 11/7 etc, so the parts<br/>are at varied intervals and chords at the points of rest where they<br/>come together, so that they aren&grave;t all the same, at octaves (and<br/>don&grave;t have to be &quot;consonances&quot; just because one is resting at them).</p><p>Then, lots of other things I explore, like arpeggios in the scale<br/>that ascend and descend in different ways. Here, one could<br/>ascend by 0 1 3 and descend by 0 2 3.</p><p>Here it is:<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/elevenlimitpentatonic">http://www.mp3.com.au/elevenlimitpentatonic</a></p><p>So basically it is a very simple idea. It&apos;s not an attempt to<br/>make music following traditional rules of harmony at all, but<br/>making something new that will work with a fractal<br/>tune.</p><p>BTW what makes it fractal is that each part plays the same tune<br/>as all the others, with varied speed.</p><p>The musical seed gets transformed as it moves up and down in the scale,<br/>but the same thing is happening in all the parts, so they still all<br/>play the same tune - the same notes, at varied speeds.</p><p>This corresponds to visual<br/>fractals that look the same at all scales - the fractal tunes<br/>sound the same at all speeds (if one had parts to play for each<br/>of the layers of ornamentation).</p><p>There are various notions of fractal, ones that are exactly the<br/>sane at every level, like FTS, or ones that have similar<br/>structures at every level, but not identical - the<br/>word fractal is a general neame for a field of study<br/>rather than a precise mathematical term as such, though<br/>terms like fractal dimension etc. have been given precise<br/>mathematical definitions.</p><p>There are lots of fractal music programs, however I wonder if<br/>FTS is unique so far in using _exactly_ similar fractals to make<br/>music?</p><p>That&apos;s for the basic form of the fractal tune idea. The later<br/>transformations and remappings and fractal rhythms and polyrhythms<br/>make fractal tunes that are no longer exactly self similar,<br/>however, they are still based on the same passing notes idea<br/>for harmony / counterpoint.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know what other techniques are used for<br/>harmony / counterpoint in fractal tunes. Do<br/>interesting harmonic structures arise naturally from, say,<br/>the structure of the mandelbrot set or whatever?<br/>Or, does the counterpoint need to be added in in some way?</p><p>When composing / improvising, I may to some extent use the passing<br/>notes idea, - I think I do while improvising.</p><p>Idea is that you let your &quot;mistakes&quot; flow into the piece,<br/>so that you treat them as passing notes, and a source<br/>for inspiration and invention.</p><p>Also, I like passing from less to more chromaticism and<br/>back again while improvising. Result is that one<br/>treats the accidentals as passing notes rather than<br/>changes of key, so that is also like some of the fractal<br/>tunes.</p><p>Others, I do do kind of key changes, e.g. if yu have<br/>an ordinary type scale, but then make it a non ascending one<br/>that goes up to the 2/1, then down to the 3/2 for the repeat<br/>you will go up one key in the circle of fifths whenever you<br/>go past the end of the repeat of the scale, and down one<br/>when you come back again. &quot;Familiar territory&quot; does this<br/>- no mp3 yet, but its on the real audio page.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 12:05:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig</p><p>&gt; This is quite fascinating. I am not sure i completely follow but it<br/>&gt; sounds like you have a cross between a canon by augmentation and the eastern<br/>&gt; idea of nuclear melody which i believe we discussed recently. Does this<br/>&gt; seem right?</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s it exactly. The canon works automatically by the fractal construction<br/>method.</p><p>&gt; a question also. When you say........</p><p>&gt; For instance, the marimba with string quartet has a very straightforward<br/>&gt; fractal tune with the seed just 0 1 0 in scale degrees<br/>&gt; in the five parts -</p><p>&gt; I am not sure if 0 means the same note repeated or a reference to the tonic<br/>&gt; as in 0 10<br/>&gt; meaning C D C.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s it.</p><p>&gt; One thing similar I have played with is having a two part counterpuntal line</p><p>&gt; played by 3 or four voices in unison but where the unison involve different<br/>&gt; voices.<br/>&gt; the simplest would be one above and one below with a third alternating<br/>&gt; unison between the two. Maybe a fourth alternating unison with the ones the<br/>&gt; third is not playing. The question then becomes what are the two melodies,<br/>&gt; the one above and below or the two alternating. a musical relativity.</p><p>Right, that&apos;s like the redistribution of the parts. Often the original melody<br/>gets completely lost as often the parts are at octaves or whatever with<br/>each other so each plays a selection of notes from the melody, and the other<br/>selection is transposed to an octave below it or whatever, then<br/>I often do it so that each part sustains its note to the next note it<br/>plays, rather than pausing to let the next instrument play the next<br/>note in the tune.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2002 10:46:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>I&apos;ve still got ideas on this that I promised you, but they rely on lattices and I wonder which group would be best.
