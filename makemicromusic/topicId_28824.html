I took time lapse video and recorded audio from my vantage point.<br/>Presented here was a moment when my 17 equal synthesizers, percussion and<br/>choir seemed to meld with Barry&#xFFFD;s unique DIY plucked instrument, sax and<br/>trombone in true Cage-ian aleatoric synchronicity.</p><p><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=2660">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=2660</a> for video, audio, and even more video of<br/>the event.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
