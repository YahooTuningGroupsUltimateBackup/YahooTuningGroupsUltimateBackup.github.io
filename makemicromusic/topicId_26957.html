After 13 years, I think it holds up very well. To folks who don&apos;t know...it&apos;s basically a compilation of music sent to me by the artists who wanted their music on the CD....we had a list discussion about who wanted to participate, and what you hear are the results. I simply took the DAT tapes I was sent, and assembled them into the CD, got the art done, and pressed it. Each artist also sent their own liner notes, which I think are superb...one can learn a lot just by reading them. And I played guitar on Starrett&apos;s two pieces, and Ernie&apos;s song too. Sj Taylor&apos;s monster composition is a masterpiece, and Starrett&apos;s &quot;Citified Notions&quot; is another personal fave...also a bitch to play.<br/>Glad ya&apos;ll are getting a chance to hear it, and boy, big thanks to Chris for putting it out there...best...Hstick<br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
