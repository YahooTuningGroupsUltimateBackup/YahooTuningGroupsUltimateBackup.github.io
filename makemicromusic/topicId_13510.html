Aided by <br/>though by no means dictated by  technology and computerized sound<br/>analysis, these two composers created music that emphasizes colour and<br/>sonority, a continuum or an evolution of sound. Here, we present a<br/>roughly<br/>chronological survey of some of their works, including pivotal works<br/>of<br/>spectral music such as Murail&apos;s Gondwana and D&eacute;sint&eacute;grations as well<br/>as<br/>Grisey&apos;s grand cycle Les espaces acoustiques. We also explore some of<br/>their earlier as well as more recent works to look at the continuing<br/>development<br/>of sound that has been, in many ways, the hallmark of their aesthetic.</p></div>
