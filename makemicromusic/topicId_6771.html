As I kinda don&apos;t &quot;get them,&quot; or &quot;how they work.&quot;</p><p>My approach to microtonalisim is best described like this..    I was once in<br/>a studio of inter related media program at a local art school..   I explained<br/>to them that the music I was presenting to them had 6 times as many notes as<br/>what they where used to.. and that, well you know.. more is better...   Someone<br/>thought this was an expression of American Excess....   and challenged me on<br/>it, saying &quot;you know matt, sometimes more isn&apos;t better&quot; to which I replied..<br/>well yes it is...   it&apos;s a question of tonal fidelity.. and when he asked why<br/>I didn&apos;t use a scale with more then 72 notes, I explained to him that that<br/>number doesn&apos;t include the auxiliary notes...   at that was pretty much the end<br/>of that part of the critique<br/>     But I mean.. that&apos;s why I do this.. cause there&apos;s more colors...   and<br/>my inner Jungian likes drones I guess.   But I only have about 2 hours worth of<br/>theory.. training..   (from a guy I took guitar lessons from who told me he<br/>was Matt Menari&apos;s college room mate..)<br/>     Well I think modern electronic music sorta changes things in terms of<br/>how one develops, right?   I mean you don&apos;t have to wait around to train some<br/>band to play what you just wrote.. and I suppose that modifies the roll of<br/>theory.. but the point is I lurk around these parts and others...    and I don&apos;t<br/>really understand much of what&apos;s going on..   And I&apos;m the only one (out side of<br/>cyber land) I know who is mad enough to do this sort of stuff...   and you<br/>know what Freud said was the difference between the neurotic and the normal<br/>person?   The neurotic&apos;s isolated..<br/>     Anyway...   I saw that there La monte Young Well tuned piano tuning<br/>thing.. but it didn&apos;t really make much sense to me...   I&apos;d like to be able to use<br/>that tuning in cubase, perhaps in the komplete instruments to, but I don&apos;t<br/>really know much about how to go about that.. and I was looking for guidance...<br/>thinking that there might be some folks around these parts who know about<br/>these things...<br/>     I was also wondering....   Are there places to go for information on<br/>microtonal artists, and what&apos;s going on with this sort of thing?   In part<br/>because I&apos;m interested and in part because I plan to release a CD soon and am<br/>wondering how to reach an audience..<br/>     Also..   seeing that I hear rumors that such an audience exists, what<br/>are the values of this audience?   I understand that as an artist making art..<br/>if you dream of being supported by an audience.. it&apos;s a good idea to have<br/>something to say in relationship to said audiences values.. (this was supposed to<br/>be a funny joke, but it didn&apos;t quiet work out)<br/>     well, ty for your tolerance and patience and stuff</p><p>     Mr Thustra   AKA matt searles</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=6776 href="#6776">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2004 1:59:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Welcome, from a fellow beginning microtonal musician.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tramtrist7@A... wrote:<br/>&gt; Anyway, I just bought me a copy of that there Komplete 2...   and I<br/>happen to<br/>&gt; note that the good people of NI seem to have put an awful lot of<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; abilities into there software instruments..   and as of not too<br/>long ago Cubase<br/>&gt; decided to have midi plugins..   one of which is a microtonal scale<br/>thing...<br/>&gt; the only trouble is that I have a few hurdles to jump in order to<br/>use these<br/>&gt; tools properly..

Just curious.</p><p>If you&apos;re on the Mac, a software product called Lil&apos; Miss Scale Oven<br/>can simplify the tuning process for you.  It can load tuning files<br/>and export them to the NI synths (which cannot, to my knowledge, load<br/>these files by themselves and thus make you enter each tuning you<br/>want to use manually).  It has a lot of other features too, of<br/>course.  If you&apos;re on Windows, I&apos;m sure a number of folks here can<br/>point you to the appropriate tuning software.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=6777 href="#6777">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Well, I&apos;m glad to have you!</p><p>First off, you&apos;ve got a lot of info in one blast, so I don&apos;t know that it will all get answered right off the bat, but I&apos;ll give some quick thoughts...</p><p>As Paolo sort of implied, it is always nice when talking about your working scenario if you mention your platform (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.). This will help us give you only pertinent data/apps/ideas, etc.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, I just bought me a copy of that there Komplete 2...   and I happen to<br/>&gt;note that the good people of NI seem to have put an awful lot of tuning<br/>&gt;abilities into there software instruments.</p><p>Good things can be done with some of the synths they offer - I hope some of the NI users will chime in. I&apos;ve been trying to get Absynth to use a really open tuning system, rather than a built-in set of scales or internal tuning editor. We&apos;ll see how we go. But I believe FM7 has the broadest support.</p><p>&gt;My approach to microtonalisim is best described like this...</p><p>I think one of the best aspects of microtonality, as it stands right now (and especially WRT computer-based work) is that there is NO &quot;right&quot; way. Just on this list, which is tiny compared to a lot of music lists, there are many, many ways that people use microtonality to make their music of preference. I happen to think that this is a Very Good Thing.</p><p>&gt;But I mean.. that&apos;s why I do this.. cause there&apos;s more colors...   and my &gt;inner Jungian likes drones I guess.   But I only have about 2 hours worth &gt;of theory.. training..   (from a guy I took guitar lessons from who told &gt;me he was Matt Menari&apos;s college room mate..)</p><p>Welll, Matt Maneri has great cred and is a wonderful musician, all stemming from his dad Joe. Do a quick Google on Joe Maneri and you should see quite a bit of info - he has had a profound effect especially in the Boston area.</p><p>&gt;Well I think modern electronic music sorta changes things in terms of<br/>&gt;how one develops, right?</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;I mean you don&apos;t have to wait around to train some band to play what you &gt;just wrote.. and I suppose that modifies the roll of theory.. but the &gt;point is I lurk around these parts and others...    and I don&apos;t really &gt;understand much of what&apos;s going on.</p><p>You aren&apos;t the only one! But you can ask, and if it doesn&apos;t get answered here (esp. if it is more along the lines of microtonal theory) there are places we can point to so that you can get up to speed on that end as well.</p><p>&gt;And I&apos;m the only one (out side of cyber land) I know who is mad enough to &gt;do this sort of stuff...</p><p>Microtonality is one of the last areas where - in music at least - you can really chart a new course. And it is pretty much the intrepid explorers who do this. Revel in your loneliness! :)</p><p>&gt;I was also wondering....   Are there places to go for information on &gt;microtonal artists, and what&apos;s going on with this sort of thing? In part &gt;because I&apos;m interested and in part because I plan to release a CD soon and &gt;am wondering how to reach an audience..</p><p>There isn&apos;t really a &apos;clearinghouse&apos; of information. Be sure to check on the links page, the listing of music that is already out on the net. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you contacted musicians that are represented there that you would get msgs back about how they go as to spreading their music. But we/they are still a very small niche. It will take time. But if you dig a bit, you might be surprised how many different people, in a large number of ways, are using alternative tunings to make very new music.</p><p>&gt;Also..   seeing that I hear rumors that such an audience exists, what are &gt;the values of this audience?</p><p>Impossible to say. I don&apos;t really know for a fact that an audience exists, certainly not along the lines of more traditional (either classical or pop or ?) music audiences.</p><p>&gt;well, ty for your tolerance and patience and stuff</p><p>This list doesn&apos;t move at light speed, so patience is kinda built-in...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (aka ListMom)</p></div>
