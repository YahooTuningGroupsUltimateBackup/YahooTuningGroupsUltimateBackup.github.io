And, I was just made aware of Donald Bousted, who composes for microtonal trumpet, and will be at the upcoming fest in England on March 2...he&apos;s going 1/8 tones, 1/4 tones, and 19 eq. And, as a composer, that interests me greatly...it will be nice to have more instruments to compose for, the more the merrier (<a href="http://microtonaltrumpet.com">microtonaltrumpet.com</a>). And, on the press front, it was a great honor and surprise to find that I was in the Feb issue of Guitar Player mag, as one of their 101 Forgotten Greats and Unsung Heroes...and it was the microtones that got me there...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com">myspace.com</a>   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
