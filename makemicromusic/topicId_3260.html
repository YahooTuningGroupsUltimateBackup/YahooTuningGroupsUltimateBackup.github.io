I waited almost ten years for that to happen! I<br/>was always hoping to see good Music software for NeXT, and it never<br/>materialized. In some spare time years ago I worked on a music notation<br/>package and an additive synthesis demo for NeXT, but nothing came of that.<br/>Oh, some cool projects were done by musicians like Perry Cook, but<br/>musician-friendly software like Finale and soft synths never materialized.<br/>I&apos;m glad that Mac has gone to &quot;the best&quot; underlying OS. But until it really<br/>saturates the market better than its current 3 or 4 percent, it will be a<br/>tenuous platform. Most people can&apos;t afford to go with a tenuous platform,<br/>especially when it&apos;s much more expensive. Even at 3 or 4 thousand for a Mac<br/>G4, that&apos;s twice what you&apos;d pay for a reasonable Pentium box.</p><p>Re the FM7 -- glad you exchanged mail with Native Instruments. I did too,<br/>just this morning about the Absynth, again. Once they get their microtonal<br/>act together, I&apos;ll probably buy one of their synths... Now, if they only<br/>had a 16-channel mixer like VAZ does... ;-)</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
