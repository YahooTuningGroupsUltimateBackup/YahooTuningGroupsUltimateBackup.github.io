IOW, the major chords played melodically become<br/>major scales, and the same with the minor chords.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 07:52 PM 10/3/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Ok, I understand the row in one direction is major chords, and one<br/>&gt;direction is minor chords, but is there a pattern to mixing cells from<br/>&gt;both directions?
