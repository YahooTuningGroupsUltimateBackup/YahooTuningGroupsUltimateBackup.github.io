That is the version I use.</p><p>Sorry for your frustration with Csound. I understand the complexity<br/>issue, long learning curve, cryptic error messages. All I can say is<br/>it was worth it for me. But I touch very little Csound with my use<br/>of the program. Just a few dozen lines of code, generated by a front<br/>end program I wrote myself in Turbo Pascal (1988 vintage software,<br/>out of support, only a few copies on every computer I own.)</p><p>Prent</p></div>
