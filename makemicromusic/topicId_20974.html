I&apos;m mostly waiting for it to be installable on OSX 10.5 (or even<br/>10.6). It&apos;s just way more work than I am able to do to get csound working<br/>with python.

I should try the Windows version again, or get Linux<br/>running in a virtual machine.</p><p>I also haven&apos;t learned csound, so I don&apos;t know how to get good timbres<br/>through it. The last time I tried the windows version, the soundfont support<br/>was poor with the instruments I tried. In particular, it was, for whatever<br/>reason, only using one sample for the entire range of each instrument. I do<br/>have explicit plans for learning supercollider, though, so I can hopefully<br/>get something I like going with the osc support.</p><p>MIDI support would be pretty useful, to be honest. I found working with the<br/>MIDI output of jisequencer entirely acceptable, for what it&apos;s worth. The 16<br/>note polyphony it provided was adequate for what I was doing, and I could<br/>even use multiple instruments if whatever synth I was using could load them<br/>fast enough. For example, I was routing jisequencer into the OSX application<br/>MidiPipe, which was set up to act as a soundfont synth. I was doing this was<br/>rather large sample sets and it still worked OK.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d use non-ji tunings much in Rationale.<br/>Maybe you could find a way to allow any interval to be in the note bank. It<br/>could be interesting, for example, to be able to define equal tempered and<br/>just ratios in a piece. You could, for example, write a piece for equal<br/>tempered guitar or piano and the harmonics of those strings. You could also<br/>do neat things like define golden means. Again, this stuff is all cool, but<br/>personally I just want the program to work well with just intonation.</p><p>Again, thanks for all your hard work.

In my opinion classical symphonic orchestra is a very<br/>problematic conglomerate of instruments, it can&apos;t work well. In fact<br/>it&apos;s dead since the times of Mahler, Richard Strauss, Holst or<br/>Stravinski Russian period, which is about 100 years ago. This<br/>orchestra is good only for performing that historical music. So<br/>called mastery of orchestration means just to keep some basic rules<br/>which force composer to do lot of compromises in music itself.<br/>I personally didn&apos;t have much desire to write for orchestra, but<br/>there were some opportunities and duties during my study at Music<br/>Academy, and later some commissions. Because orchestra is an<br/>established music institution, &quot;ready made&quot;, and when composer is<br/>obedient and keeps all rules, his work will be performed (same like<br/>writing music for piano trio, string quartet or wind quintet -<br/>there&apos;s a big chance it will be performed as there are many of such<br/>groups, but for which price? They perform mainly historical music and<br/>are unable to play well contemporary music. Composer can&apos;t do<br/>miracles, music will sound the same like many others. With some<br/>exceptions, of course, like Kronos quartet...). So I did, and tried<br/>to do my best and find my ways. During writing more orchestral pieces<br/>(all were written and performed between 1980 - 2005) - last one being<br/>&quot;Double concerto for pipe organ and drums&quot; where I performed organ<br/>part - I thought a lot about orchestra and its role in the<br/>contemporary music. I published a large study in Czech music magazine<br/>on this. Just a few points:</p><p>- To get a good sound from it, you have to write rather traditional<br/>music, because a lot of acoustic rules must be kept, especially when<br/>using tutti. But there&apos;s no reason just to copy Mahler, Strauss,<br/>Debussy, Ravel or Stravinski... They have used and exhausted all<br/>possible combinations. It&apos;s difficult if not impossible to invent<br/>anything new with classical orchestra. So it&apos;s loss of time to study<br/>this classical orchestration art. Despite this it&apos;s good to study and<br/>to be able to use it, just for purpose of some commission for<br/>functional music. But this knowledge is not too helpful when<br/>composing autonomous New music, only to know, how NOT to use orchestra.</p><p>- To get really contemporary sound from orchestra is not far from<br/>impossible. Result will be only bad sound, always very similar, only<br/>bad in a different way - it was exhausted in 50/60ies. Result will be<br/>otherwise Darmstadt overorganized multiserialism chaos of 50ies or<br/>Polish school random aleatorics chaos of 60ies. I met some totally<br/>unable wannabe contemporary composers doing this and declaring that<br/>exactly this sound they wanted (trying to hide their inability to<br/>write well for orchestra and find anything new).</p><p>- Instruments in orchestra are not well balanced. When I&apos;ll<br/>exaggerate slightly the problem, three flutes in &quot;ff&quot; are nothing<br/>against one trumpet in &quot;p&quot;. Then all that masking effect, and take<br/>into the account unbalanced ranges of acoustic instruments and its<br/>narrow connection to dynamics (usually it&apos;s not possible to play ff<br/>in low range and pp in upper range). Nothing to say about drums and<br/>percussions - for contemporary music we need a lot more then<br/>triangle, piatti, timpani, snare and kick drum. There&apos;s too much of<br/>strings, which are usually the most problematic performers concerning<br/>rhythm... Some instruments are there just for visual effect, like<br/>harp... And lot of useful instruments missing. Bass range is totally<br/>unsatisfying.<br/>I personally solved some of these problems by using whole blocks of<br/>instruments together (woodwinds, brass, strings, drums and other...),<br/>which is of course limitation.</p><p>- Different way of creating sound means different articulation,<br/>phrasing, rhythmic precision... Instruments don&apos;t glue well together.<br/>Yes, it can become advantage, but normally it&apos;s not good. Because to<br/>get good and natural sound the composer is forced to use instruments<br/>and instrumental groups in their most &quot;typical&quot; textures and roles,<br/>which were overused in the past. Any other using doesn&apos;t sound well,<br/>and makes all those traditionally educated performers very unhappy.<br/>They can&apos;t show in such contemporary music their &quot;empty&quot; virtuosity<br/>based on the scales and broken chords :-)</p><p>- Another very special problem is tuning, which I don&apos;t need to<br/>analyse too much here as everybody knows well...</p><p>- Nothing to say about many other things used in contemporary music,<br/>which traditionally educated orchestral performers (used to perform<br/>mainly historical music) can&apos;t do well, be it special ways of<br/>playing, microtones, polyrhythms, polytempos, jazz feeling (for<br/>example) etc. etc..</p><p>- Orchestra can sound well only when recorded in studio, not under<br/>normal conditions in the concert halls. Then multi mike technique canbe used (yes, I know, now it&apos;s again fashionable to do contact<br/>recording with one stereo mike, but that has no sense in my opinion -<br/>if we have such good technology, why not to use it fully?) to balance<br/>artificially instruments and groups artificially. Then also some<br/>other instruments can be added which is normally (that means purely<br/>acoustically without amplification)  impossible (whole plucked group,<br/>ethnic instruments, lot of special small drums...). We can use also<br/>audio processing, unusual and until now unused sound effects, use<br/>artificial reverb, to use sound microscoping (by amplyfing very low<br/>volume sounds)... Only this way can orchestra become again<br/>unbelievably creative tool with unlimited palette of sounds and their<br/>combinations. Even using of electronic instruments in such orchestra<br/>is possible, and everything can be well mixed together. Nothing to say about possibility of recording certain sounds, or atmospheres,<br/>process them electronically, use them as samples and mix them again<br/>with real record... Unlimited possibilities in the domain of<br/>acoustics and electronics. But could any of you imagine existence of<br/>such experimental studio orchestra as a stable institution? It would<br/>be too nice... UNESCO should establish it, one such orchestra in the<br/>world would be enough :-) in the beginning, reserved only for<br/>experiments, film music, selling records of such music... Pure Utopia.</p><p>- That means, when we think further in this direction, there&apos;s only<br/>one practical solution nowadays, thanks to technology: MIDI orchestra<br/>with sampled, physically modelled or FM or additive harmonic<br/>synthesis.... or more ... imitated acoustic sounds plus using also electronic colors of all kind. This can even sound much better then<br/>real orchestra after some effort (don&apos;t forget Dolby Surround). Of<br/>course it is possible to do all necessary controller changes (pitch<br/>bend, vibrato, tremolo, volume, expression, panorama + stereo width,<br/>sharpness of sound, resonance, attack, release, delay, echo,<br/>reverb...), using different articulation (thanks to many kind of<br/>sampled instruments). Yes, it&apos;s a question if we can still call such<br/>body an orchestra - but the most important is it works for<br/>contemporary music (at least for me). Besides musician (composer) is<br/>independent on all those issues connected with real orchestra as a<br/>music institution... We can use any microtuning impossible to get from real performers and their limited instruments... We can get<br/>unheard sound colors because we can use instruments out of their<br/>usual range (like contrabass piccolo, or three octaves higher tuba)<br/>and dynamics limitations, nothing to say about fast playing without<br/>taking a breath, impossible trills, tremolos, jumps, polyphony (with<br/>MIDI there&apos;s no problem to get 64 flutes together in full piano<br/>range), glissandos, unheard articulation and sound combinations and<br/>their mixing and shadowing... And more creative possibilities to<br/>change natural sound colors or attack and release phase of envelope,<br/>or all those specialties of physical modelling - creating new<br/>syncoustic virtual instruments like floboe, vioflute, flumbone,<br/>claritar, harpsax or so...</p><p>OK, back to my piano now...</p><p>Daniel Forr&oacute;</p></div><h3><a id=21003 href="#21003">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2009 12:34:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Synful isn&apos;t sampled, but anyway, I wasn&apos;t saying that it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; easy to master _orchestration_.

In my opinion classical symphonic orchestra is a very<br/>&gt; &gt; problematic conglomerate of instruments, it can&apos;t work well.</p><p>One of many possible problematic conglomerates of instruments, the vast majority of which are all but forgotten. Which is to say, it evolved into that particular conglomeration.<br/>The fact that it&apos;s not easy to use, that flutes aren&apos;t as loud as trumpets, is no proof that it&apos;s not a good tool. If I use my vacuum cleaner and my CD player at the same time, I don&apos;t hear what I want to hear either, but they both belong in my apartment.</p><p>&gt; &gt; - To get a good sound from it, you have to write rather traditional<br/>&gt; &gt; music, because a lot of acoustic rules must be kept, especially when<br/>&gt; &gt; using tutti. But there&apos;s no reason just to copy Mahler, Strauss,<br/>&gt; &gt; Debussy, Ravel or Stravinski... They have used and exhausted all<br/>&gt; &gt; possible combinations. It&apos;s difficult if not impossible to invent<br/>&gt; &gt; anything new with classical orchestra. So it&apos;s loss of time to study<br/>&gt; &gt; this classical orchestration art. Despite this it&apos;s good to study and<br/>&gt; &gt; to be able to use it, just for purpose of some commission for<br/>&gt; &gt; functional music. But this knowledge is not too helpful when<br/>&gt; &gt; composing autonomous New music, only to know, how NOT to use orchestra.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a kind of anxiety of &apos;newness&apos; in Western culture that<br/>&gt; perhaps ought be reconsidered. Nothing is ever truly new, first of<br/>&gt; all. Secondly, good music comes from a dialog with tradition. We<br/>&gt; needn&apos;t think that being in dialog with tradition is a bad thing.</p><p>I&apos;m not myself too interested in tradition, but I also perceive a disproportionate obsession with newness around me. If the only merit a work has is that it is new, it will soon lose the only thing it had to recommend it. I personally don&apos;t listen to music because it&apos;s new, and especially don&apos;t derive the most pleasure from knowing that it&apos;s new. The works in all forms of art that tend to affect me the most are those that were considered strange when they were contemporary, and continue to be considered so. They may have been influential, but they didn&apos;t end up being &quot;one of&quot; some group. Also consider that the person who perfects some style is not always the same person who invented it. The inventor is likely to become bored and invent something else rather than refining his one invention to greatness.</p><p>&gt; &gt; - That means, when we think further in this direction, there&apos;s only<br/>&gt; &gt; one practical solution nowadays, thanks to technology: MIDI orchestra</p><p>Why are people so hung up on MIDI? It&apos;s OLD. It was designed for the masses, and for a limited set of styles. It is no longer the only option, and the only reason to cling to it is being unwilling to learn the alternatives. It&apos;s another self-imposed limitation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; with sampled, physically modelled or FM or additive harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; synthesis.... or more ... imitated acoustic sounds plus using also<br/>&gt; &gt; electronic colors of all kind. This can even sound much better then<br/>&gt; &gt; real orchestra after some effort (don&apos;t forget Dolby Surround). Of<br/>&gt; &gt; course it is possible to do all necessary controller changes (pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; bend, vibrato, tremolo, volume, expression, panorama + stereo width,<br/>&gt; &gt; sharpness of sound, resonance, attack, release, delay, echo,<br/>&gt; &gt; reverb...), using different articulation (thanks to many kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; sampled instruments). Yes, it&apos;s a question if we can still call such<br/>&gt; &gt; body an orchestra - but the most important is it works for<br/>&gt; &gt; contemporary music (at least for me). Besides musician (composer) is<br/>&gt; &gt; independent on all those issues connected with real orchestra as a<br/>&gt; &gt; music institution... We can use any microtuning impossible to get<br/>&gt; &gt; from real performers and their limited instruments... We can get<br/>&gt; &gt; unheard sound colors because we can use instruments out of their<br/>&gt; &gt; usual range (like contrabass piccolo, or three octaves higher tuba)<br/>&gt; &gt; and dynamics limitations, nothing to say about fast playing without<br/>&gt; &gt; taking a breath, impossible trills, tremolos, jumps, polyphony (with<br/>&gt; &gt; MIDI there&apos;s no problem to get 64 flutes together in full piano<br/>&gt; &gt; range), glissandos, unheard articulation and sound combinations and<br/>&gt; &gt; their mixing and shadowing... And more creative possibilities to<br/>&gt; &gt; change natural sound colors or attack and release phase of envelope,<br/>&gt; &gt; or all those specialties of physical modelling - creating new<br/>&gt; &gt; syncoustic virtual instruments like floboe, vioflute, flumbone,<br/>&gt; &gt; claritar, harpsax or so...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may be right, but thus far many of the prototypical experiments in<br/>&gt; this direction leave me unimpressed. FM has it&apos;s uses, but creating a<br/>&gt; warm sound to bathe in isn&apos;t typically one of them. Good for making<br/>&gt; fun of the 80s, though. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Many digital synthesis techniques are sterile sounding. Physical<br/>&gt; modelling is certainly promising, but it&apos;s going to be a while before<br/>&gt; it really rivals a real flesh and blood instrument.</p><p>I think I agree with Daniel on one thing, but I can only speak for myself. Once you have a new tool in your arsenal, you don&apos;t go back to not having it. I went to a mostly jazz-oriented school where the faculty would get all excited when someone commissioned a big band piece, and proudly announce, &quot;See, it&apos;s coming back! Big band will always be around! You should learn this stuff well, because it&apos;s really in style!&quot; But they were being selective. Most music opportunities involve some fairly sophisticated use of computers, and that will only change by replacing computers with something more advanced, not by the old tools reasserting themselves.<br/>But I think Daniel&apos;s list is still restrictive; what you can do with flute sounds is not the most exciting part, nor imitating physical articulations, etc. Those things should be tried, sure, but computers don&apos;t force you to start with something from a real orchestra.</p><p>I don&apos;t see the dominance of 12-tET being pushed aside as easily as the dominance of the symphony orchestra; that&apos;s not so much a limitation of the tools as a limitation of the users&apos; understanding.</p><p>-Chuckk</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; AKJ<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

There&apos;s something called Carlos&apos; first law.<br/>Or second law - or maybe it&apos;s the third.  It states: every variable<br/>you can control, you must control.  A compressed soundfont with<br/>four samples stretched across the keyboard may sound like crap,<br/>but there isn&apos;t much to control.  It will sound uniformly like<br/>crap.  GPO will give much higher fidelity, and as the logical<br/>extreme of the sampling idea, it will sound more *superficially*<br/>realistic.</p><p>It&apos;s this superficial realism that bothers my ear.  Any quarter-<br/>second excerpt of a GPO performance will be indistinguishable from<br/>a real recording.  But listen for longer, and you will start to<br/>notice all the degrees of freedom that aren&apos;t being controlled.<br/>You can&apos;t control them -- GPO doesn&apos;t give you the knobs.</p><p>Because Synful is a synthesizer, it can create novel performances<br/>based on MIDI data.  It&apos;s the same thing with Pianoteq vs.<br/>something like Ivory (but even moreso, since orchestras have<br/>many more degrees of freedom than pianos).  Though Ivory&apos;s a<br/>sampler, it actually does have DSP modeling of string resonance,<br/>and it can interpolate 128 levels of dynamics between the 3-5<br/>different dynamic samples for each key.  But it still can&apos;t<br/>match the overtone responses and so on, that come out of the<br/>Pianoteq physical model, even though if you listen closely to<br/>individual notes (especially in the treble), Ivory will sound<br/>more &quot;realistic&quot; (the treble notes on all physically modeled<br/>pianos I&apos;ve heard buzz as they decay... I&apos;m not sure why...).</p><p>An entire Ivory performance sounds like a bad piano recording,<br/>compressed too much or something.  A Pianoteq performance<br/>breathes more (you can download several such comparisons from<br/>the pianoteq forums).  But the difference is subtle.  It&apos;s<br/>much more extreme with Synful vs. GPO, both in the superficial<br/>and underlying realism departments.</p><p>To address Daniel&apos;s other point, yes, some of the demos on the<br/>synful website are rubbish.  Many of them were done on earlier<br/>versions -- the additive engine was completely rewritten in<br/>version 2.4.  Also, I don&apos;t personally like the &quot;sections&quot;<br/>patches (then again, I don&apos;t like real orchestra sections<br/>either, being a fan of chamber music).  It is possible to put<br/>together a synful orchestra using one individual instrument for<br/>each part, which I think gives much better results.  If you<br/>listen to the Beethoven string quartet example, you&apos;ll hopefully<br/>see what I mean.</p><p>In summary, though I may even perversely prefer a homebrew<br/>soundfont to GPO, I might prefer even more a simple orchestra of<br/>triangle waves.  That&apos;s how much superficial realism I&apos;m willing<br/>to give up to get underlying realism (musical expression).<br/>I realize not everyone is willing to go that far, and I promise<br/>not to criticize them for the next 6 months, starting... now.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=21038 href="#21038">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2009 11:37:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;Is this really good, Mr. Lindemann, to sell such powerfull<br/>&gt; &gt;weapons?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh please.</p><p>God forbid such heresy should take place.

MIDI keyboard is MIDI keyboard, it has no tone generator. You exaggerate with one hand play, such violin emulation will be poor.

When a wind player plays a slur, the timbre and intensity of the current note begins to change well before the pitch changes to the new note. This anticipation of the upcoming note is a key aspect of expressive playing. Performers can do this because they know ahead of time when they are going to play a new note and they prepare for it with changes in embouchure and breath pressure.</p><p>To model this kind of expression a synthesizer needs to have the same knowledge of the future. Synful Orchestra handles this with two modes of operation. When playing live from a keyboard Synful Orchestra has no knowledge of when a new note is coming, and so it does its best to react as expressively as possible with low latency when a new note occurs. However, when playing from a sequence Synful Orchestra can optionally add a delay to the Midi input. This delay allows Synful Orchestra to look ahead in the Midi sequence, recognize when a new note is coming, and anticipate it with appropriate changes to the timbre and intensity of the current note. The result is more realistic and natural phrasing.</p><p>--------------</p><p>What they write here, means there is still some difference between real time performing and playing recorded tracks when Delay for Expression is activated. I didn&apos;t work with it unlike you, so you know better.

Still I don&apos;t understand well how all that analysis of musical situation, selection of appropriate phrases from database, converting to additive resynthesis and processed as necessary can run in real time...</p><p>[Similar problems of transitions exist in statistical analysis of music done by musicologists, for example melodic intervals, to find some typical patterns or characteristic melodic cells for certain music era, genre, composer... which can be later used in composition to emulate this era, genre, composer... When you analyse only two adjacent intervals, similarity is very far. The more members in the analyzed group of adjacent notes, similarity grows, but very soon you come to identity = copy, which was not target. ]<br/>&gt; The expressiveness depends on many<br/>&gt; factors, in some situations sampling, physical modelling or other kind<br/>&gt; of synthesis can produce the sound indistinguishable from the one &gt; of an<br/>&gt; acoustic instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t understand this sentence. In the beginning you use term &quot;expressiveness&quot;, in the end &quot;sound&quot;.  Yes, sound can be very near, almost indistinguishable (with excellent instrument and excellent performer), but still it will differ in expressiveness. Whenever I have compared here in this discussion acoustic and electronic instruments, of course I&apos;ve been talking about live performance!</p><p>On acoustic instruments sound can&apos;t  be separated from  expressiveness as both elements are directly connected. Sound is result of real time control (= expressiveness).<br/>Problem of the most electronic instruments is they did this separation (because of technological of commercial limits), and lost expressiveness. If we accept it, we can live with it, we can work with it, made advantage and merit from it and call it for example &quot;electronic sound&quot; :-) There&apos;s nothing bad on it. Aesthetics of huge amount of art and commercial electronic music is based on this. Intentional coolness, sterility, robotically precise rhythm, rhythmic quantization, lack of expressivity... Futuristic picture of the dehumanized world...</p><p>Yes, I can agree that some electronic instruments can emulate well most of acoustic instruments, if we use this main factor: MIDI sequence them and then add additionally lot of controllers. Some of them need only few and can be well emulated in real time (drums, plucked instruments, industrial sound FX...), some others need more.<br/>But despite this fact, and despite the fact I use also such emulation from practical reasons, I will keep my opinion that the main field for electronic instruments is to produce electronic sounds. In the history of electronic music instruments it was always so. In my opinion direction of emulating acoustic instruments by sampling, RAM or ROM, and sample based synthesizers, has nothing to do with real electronic synthesis of sound. It&apos;s just additional feature of this technology, which has of course its use, too.<br/>Physical modelling is quite different story, here is still hidden a big future potential. Especially in syncoustic sounds - electronically produced sounds with character and expressivity of acoustic instruments.<br/>&gt; Is, for example, the electronic calculator only a substitution and &gt; fake<br/>&gt; of a mechanical one?<br/>&gt;<br/>Can&apos;t be compared. Resulting numbers can be the same from both types of calculators (here in Japan, pioneer country of digital technology, still lot of people use 400 years old abacus called soroban, and skilled person can count with it faster then another one with calculator), resulting sound will always differ.<br/>&gt; &gt; - Electronic instruments are perfect in making electronic sounds.<br/>&gt; &gt; Using them this way is perfect. Let&apos;s do it!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; What is the &quot;electronic sound&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Milan<br/>If you are the person I suppose then it&apos;s funny you ask me same question as my three years old daughter :-) You are specialist in this field so you know the answer. OK, here you have mine definition:</p><p>All sounds which can&apos;t be produced directly by acoustic instruments. But we can get electronic sound from these instruments by electronic processing.</p><p>All sounds which are produced by electronic synthesis (analog, digital - additive, subtractive, multiplicative...). Typical electronic sound is sine wave (therefore it was selected as main sound for art electronic music in 50ies), but also the other electronically produced simple waveforms can&apos;t be made exactly with acoustic instruments. Good examples of electronic sounds are also certain inharmonic spectra (different then bell spectra), klangs, mixtures, some noises or modulated noises, or result of simple or multiple modulations (FM, AM, ring modulation, PWM, PM...).<br/>Maybe after another 10, 50 or 100 years it will be possible to get acoustic sound from these instruments. But in my opinion this is not so important. I agree with you that sound is no problem. Problem is expressivity. When we will be able to have under direct (and simple) control in real time performance all aspects and elements of sound,  then there will be no difference between acoustic and electronic instruments. This should be target. And in my opinion answer is physical modeling.</p><p>Concerning this question (which is maybe more philosophical then technological) we can also come to the conclusion, that electronic sound in fact doesn&apos;t exist because all sounds are from physical point of view changes of air pressure. Including all those which are produced by speaker - basically speaker is electronically controlled drum :-) At least this is opinion of my daughter.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3><a id=21062 href="#21062">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2009 7:38:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In rough and general sense yes, but we use here rather terms like &quot;synthesizing&quot;, &quot;setting&quot;, &quot;patching&quot;, &quot;programming&quot;...</p><p>Classical resynthesis is connected with additive harmonic synthesis as far as I know.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 19 Sep 2009, at 7:44 PM, aum wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh yes, my mistake...

Still I don&apos;t understand well how all that  &gt; analysis of musical situation, selection of appropriate phrases from  &gt; database, converting to additive resynthesis and processed as  &gt; necessary can run in real time...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Similar problems of transitions exist in statistical analysis of  &gt; music done by musicologists, for example melodic intervals, to find  &gt; some typical patterns or characteristic melodic cells for certain  &gt; music era, genre, composer... which can be later used in composition  &gt; to emulate this era, genre, composer... When you analyse only two  &gt; adjacent intervals, similarity is very far. The more members in the  &gt; analyzed group of adjacent notes, similarity grows, but very soon you  &gt; come to identity = copy, which was not target. ]<br/>&gt;   What I mean is that I disagree with your sentence &quot;Electronic instruments are not perfect in emulation of acoustic ones.&quot; They can be if expressiveness is not needed.<br/>&gt;&gt; The expressiveness depends on many<br/>&gt;&gt; factors, in some situations sampling, physical modelling or other kind<br/>&gt;&gt; of synthesis can produce the sound indistinguishable from the one  &gt;&gt; of an<br/>&gt;&gt; acoustic instrument.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; I don&apos;t understand this sentence. In the beginning you use term  &gt; &quot;expressiveness&quot;, in the end &quot;sound&quot;.  Yes, sound can be very near,  &gt; almost indistinguishable (with excellent instrument and excellent  &gt; performer), but still it will differ in expressiveness. Whenever I  &gt; have compared here in this discussion acoustic and electronic  &gt; instruments, of course I&apos;ve been talking about live performance!<br/>&gt;   If you play an electronic instrument using various controllers and other means to control sound variations (expressiveness) you can get in some situations the varying sound (expressive sound, the sound with expressiveness, ...) indistinguishable from the &quot;sound with expressiveness&quot; of acoustic instrument. And the result can be intentional, desired and perfect, not only the substitution, fake or compromise.<br/>&gt; On acoustic instruments sound can&apos;t  be separated from   &gt; expressiveness as both elements are directly connected. Sound is  &gt; result of real time control (= expressiveness).<br/>&gt; Problem of the most electronic instruments is they did this  &gt; separation (because of technological of commercial limits), and lost  &gt; expressiveness. If we accept it, we can live with it, we can work  &gt; with it, made advantage and merit from it and call it for example  &gt; &quot;electronic sound&quot; :-) There&apos;s nothing bad on it. Aesthetics of huge  &gt; amount of art and commercial electronic music is based on this.  &gt; Intentional coolness, sterility, robotically precise rhythm, rhythmic  &gt; quantization, lack of expressivity... Futuristic picture of the  &gt; dehumanized world...<br/>&gt; Yes, I can agree that some electronic instruments can emulate well  &gt; most of acoustic instruments, if we use this main factor: MIDI  &gt; sequence them and then add additionally lot of controllers. Some of  &gt; them need only few and can be well emulated in real time (drums,  &gt; plucked instruments, industrial sound FX...), some others need more.<br/>&gt; But despite this fact, and despite the fact I use also such emulation  &gt; from practical reasons, I will keep my opinion that the main field  &gt; for electronic instruments is to produce electronic sounds. In the  &gt; history of electronic music instruments it was always so. In my  &gt; opinion direction of emulating acoustic instruments by sampling, RAM  &gt; or ROM, and sample based synthesizers, has nothing to do with real  &gt; electronic synthesis of sound. It&apos;s just additional feature of this  &gt; technology, which has of course its use, too.<br/>&gt; Physical modelling is quite different story, here is still hidden a  &gt; big future potential. Especially in syncoustic sounds -  &gt; electronically produced sounds with character and expressivity of  &gt; acoustic instruments.<br/>&gt;   Almost any sentence is worth a long discussion. I think is is little off topic here. Although it might be interesting (you probably know, for example, the Rockefeller Chapel Court Test of Hammond organ. Funny story... Referring to &quot;the main field  for electronic instruments is to produce electronic sounds. In the  history of electronic music instruments it was always so.&quot;).<br/>&gt;&gt; Is, for example, the electronic calculator only a substitution and  &gt;&gt; fake<br/>&gt;&gt; of a mechanical one?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; Can&apos;t be compared. Resulting numbers can be the same from both types  &gt; of calculators (here in Japan, pioneer country of digital technology,  &gt; still lot of people use 400 years old abacus called soroban, and  &gt; skilled person can count with it faster then another one with  &gt; calculator), resulting sound will always differ.<br/>&gt;   Soroban was exactly what I was thinking about... Resulting sounds can be (practically) the same and are the same in many pieces of todays music. I think me, you or nobody else can tell the real sound sources in most of contemporary recordings.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Electronic instruments are perfect in making electronic sounds.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Using them this way is perfect. Let&apos;s do it!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt; What is the &quot;electronic sound&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Milan<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt; If you are the person I suppose then it&apos;s funny you ask me same  &gt; question as my three years old daughter :-) You are specialist in  &gt; this field so you know the answer. OK, here you have mine definition:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All sounds which can&apos;t be produced directly by acoustic instruments.  &gt; But we can get electronic sound from these instruments by electronic  &gt; processing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All sounds which are produced by electronic synthesis (analog,  &gt; digital - additive, subtractive, multiplicative...). Typical  &gt; electronic sound is sine wave (therefore it was selected as main  &gt; sound for art electronic music in 50ies), but also the other  &gt; electronically produced simple waveforms can&apos;t be made exactly with  &gt; acoustic instruments. Good examples of electronic sounds are also  &gt; certain inharmonic spectra (different then bell spectra), klangs,  &gt; mixtures, some noises or modulated noises, or result of simple or  &gt; multiple modulations (FM, AM, ring modulation, PWM, PM...).<br/>&gt; Maybe after another 10, 50 or 100 years it will be possible to get  &gt; acoustic sound from these instruments. But in my opinion this is not  &gt; so important. I agree with you that sound is no problem. Problem is  &gt; expressivity. When we will be able to have under direct (and simple)  &gt; control in real time performance all aspects and elements of sound,   &gt; then there will be no difference between acoustic and electronic  &gt; instruments. This should be target. And in my opinion answer is  &gt; physical modeling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Concerning this question (which is maybe more philosophical then  &gt; technological) we can also come to the conclusion, that electronic  &gt; sound in fact doesn&apos;t exist because all sounds are from physical  &gt; point of view changes of air pressure. Including all those which are  &gt; produced by speaker - basically speaker is electronically controlled  &gt; drum :-) At least this is opinion of my daughter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;   I think I am the person you suppose... The point was: The sentence&quot;Electronic instruments are perfect in making electronic sounds.&quot; is sort of tautology (Green paint is perfect in painting green).</p><p>Once again, any your sentence is worth a long off topic discussion.
