Putting a softsynth into the project is no different than using a hardware box. You have a track that goes to the softsynth, and you play your midi keyboard. Instead of the midi signals going out a midi cable and the sound coming out of audio cables from, say, a TX81Z, the midi signals are routed internally and the sound goes right to your audio card/interface. Think of it as when you play with Fractal Tune Smithy or Scala, where the sound comes right off the soundcard.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2004 9:05:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
