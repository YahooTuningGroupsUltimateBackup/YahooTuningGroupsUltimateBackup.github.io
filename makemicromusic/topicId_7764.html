The /pch/ specification is most commonly used in score files to specify pitches. The number to the left of the decimal point represents the octave, with 8 being the octave beginning on middle C. The two digits immediately to the right of the decimal point represent the pitch class, that is, the key number within the octave for a standard piano keyboard, beginning with C=00.</p><p>Thus 8.00 is middle C, 8.01 is C# or Db, and so on, up to 8.11 which is B. 8.12 is equivalent to 9.00, or C of the next octave. The next two decimal points represent cents, that is, hundredths of equally-tempered semitones. Thus 8.0050 is a pitch halfway between C and C#, or 50 cents (a quarter-tone) sharp of C. In the /oct/ format, the numbers to the left of the decimal point, again, represent the octave, but the numbers to the right of the decimal point represent decimal divisions of the octave. Therefore, 8.06 (F#) in /pch/ notation is equivalent to 8.50 (halfway between the C of octave 8 and the C of octave 9) in /oct/ notation.</p><p>Csound provides six functions to convert between these specifications: *cpspch* (convert from pch to /cps/ in twelve-tone equal temperament), *cpsoct* (convert from oct to /cps/), *pchoct* (convert from /oct/ to /pch/), *pchcps* (convert from /cps/ to /pch/),*octcps* (convert from /cps/ to /oct/), and *octpch* (convert from /pch/ to /oct/).</p><p>While pitches in a score may be specified directly with /cps/, few musicians think in such terms. For composers who use twelve-tone equal temperament (12TET), or who know their pitches relationship to 12TET, /pch/ notation can be useful. For example, a quarter-tone scale could be rendered: 8.000, 8.005, 8.010, 8.015, 8.020, 8.025, and so on. However, many composers in alternate tunings have no desire to express themselves in relation to the 12TET reference.</p><p>The /oct/ specification would be mainly useful in equal temperaments easily represented in decimal format, such as 10TET or 100TET. John Fitch&apos;s /Drums and Different Canons #1/ is a work in 100TET that uses /oct/ format for all pitches. The complete orchestra and score for this piece is available on the CD-ROM accompanying this book.</p><p>Pitch resolution in Csound is generally very good (especially in comparison to most MIDI instruments), though the frequency output of analysis programs such as *hetro *and *pvanal* may be coarse. Frequencies in /cps/ format are represented by floating point variables in Csound, which on most systems means that the difference between 20 Hz and the next highest representable frequency is only about 0.00021cents.</p><p>----</p></div><h3>mentalosmosis &#x3C;mentalosmosis@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2004 12:09:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I can&apos;t believe how dumb my teacher is... thank God I dumped my<br/>graduation course... anyway, it&apos;s none of your business folks...</p><p>Thanks Daniel Wolf</p><p>one last thing, how accurate are the representations in cents?</p><p>Example, if I wanta tone of 133.333 cents in relation to C4, can I<br/>just write 8.0133333 ?
