My main instruments are<br/>electric basses ( 4,5,6,7 string and fretless ) and guitar. I also<br/>play upright bass and other random instruments such as the Chapman<br/>stick. I can play drums and piano good enough if needed. I like every<br/>style and every artist you can think of from every genre. I am very<br/>much into world music and microtonal music. My ideal setup would be a<br/>keyboard/piano player, a drummr who knows how to make their drums<br/>sound more experimental and free, and a lead instrument ( saxophone,<br/>violin, etc. ) but I am open to any instrumentation ultimately, as<br/>long as there are similar ideas, hopes, and goals. E-mail me and I<br/>will get back to.</p><p>Anthony</p><p>    * this is in or around Boston<br/>    * no -- it&apos;s NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other<br/>commercial interests</p><p>&#x9;&quot;</p></div>
