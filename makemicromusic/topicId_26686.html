Two of my favorite, uh, &quot;intonational systems&quot;(?)!</p><p>To share my happiness at seeing MMM restored to its music-oriented glory, I thought I&apos;d link to the two (old) pieces I&apos;ve written in 11-EDO, one on &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot; and the other on &quot;Early Microtonal Works&quot;:</p><p>&quot;She is My Lilac-Hued Obsession&quot;<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4ozpvzs">http://tinyurl.com/4ozpvzs</a></p><p>&quot;Breakdown Hives&quot;<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4sro4k9">http://tinyurl.com/4sro4k9</a></p><p>The first one uses the 6-note MOS of &quot;Machine&quot; temperament, though it does not do much harmonically.  In the 2nd one, the first half is in 22-EDO treated as two chains of 11-EDO an approximate 11/10 apart, so two arpeggios of 11-EDO chords are harmonized in parallel neutral 2nds and &quot;quartertones&quot;.  Then the fuzz pedal goes on and it&apos;s just one chain of 11-EDO, playing in (IIRC) the 7-note MOS of LLsLsLs, which I don&apos;t know what kind of temperament it is but the generator is 11-EDO&apos;s sharp minor 3rd.</p><p>Also, another link from &quot;MoaIL&quot;, to the piece in 19-EDO&apos;s Godzilla[9]:</p><p>&quot;Change is on the Wind&quot;<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4z648ft">http://tinyurl.com/4z648ft</a></p><p>This one really takes advantage of the fact that in Godzilla[9], all the triads have two types of 3rd (as is really the case in all 9-note MOS scales).  I really, really love Godzilla in 19.  It&apos;s melodically awesome, harmonically pleasant but exotic, and structurally fascinating.  I&apos;m coming to love Negri for the same reasons; both of these are great modalities for 19 that take it far, far away from the bland meantone territory that it is mostly known for.  Once I get finished with all my &quot;max dissonance&quot; stuff, I&apos;m going to get to work on an album that is focused on 16 and 19 (they make great contrast with each other), and I plan on really going to town with Negri and Godzilla.  Are there any compositions in Negri floating around out there?  I&apos;d love to hear them if there are.</p><p>And of course I must give kudos to JLS--Jaunt is awesome and I love the way you are using these sounds.  This is an excellent example of how to appropriately use these kinds of sounds.  It&apos;s great that you&apos;re really just &quot;going with it&quot; and making it an aesthetic, and it&apos;s an aesthetic I can really relate to (as I&apos;ve gone in similar directions myself).  Once you&apos;ve written maybe 6 or 7 more tracks, you should put &apos;em together as an album!</p><p>And to Cambert Bobrawad--like that you are posting music.  Your identity could not be more clear.  More, more, more!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2011 12:42:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, another link from &quot;MoaIL&quot;, to the piece in 19-EDO&apos;s Godzilla[9]:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Change is on the Wind&quot;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4z648ft">http://tinyurl.com/4z648ft</a></p><p>If you were willing to give a link to a complete mp3 track, I could put it up as a godzilla example on the xenwiki.</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2011 12:55:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Done and done.

Start with JI.  Imagine a scale where the only note is a 1/1--no octaves, even.  This is a 0-dimensional scale.  We can&apos;t get any other notes because 1 to any power is always 1.  Now add a 2nd interval, any interval will do but let&apos;s say 2/1 for convention&apos;s sake.  We now have a 1-dimensional scale, because we can go up or down from 1/1 by powers of 2/1.  Adding another interval---3/1, for instance--gets us to a 2-dimensional tuning-space where we can move along either or both of two axes (powers of 2 and/or powers of 3).  Adding another interval--5/1, say--gets us to a 3-dimensional space.  Every time we add an interval that is not expressible as some combination of the intervals we already have, we are adding a dimension to tuning space.</p><p>In JI, all the dimensions of tuning space are open and &quot;flat&quot; and infinite--you can move as far as you want along any combination of them and you&apos;ll never return to the origin.  When we temper, we are essentially &quot;folding&quot; or &quot;curling&quot; tuning space in such a way that it becomes possible to return to the origin of 1/1 by moving a finite number of steps along some dimensions/axes.  This happens because we equate an interval (usually a comma) with 1/1 so that that comma ceases to exist--it becomes &quot;one&quot; with the unison.  I think of this in terms of &quot;fudging&quot; the rules of math so that two distinct numbers become equated--it&apos;s like we&apos;re defining a universe in which 2+2=5.  What this also does is equate movement along one dimension with movement along other dimensions.  IOW, with the example of meantone temperament, we can now get to places on the 5 axis by moving only along the 2 and 3 axes.</p><p>This where mappings come in: depending on the comma we temper out, we will create different rules for movement in our folded space.  A mapping is nothing more than a set of directions that tells you how far you far you have to go along the available axes of your tempered tuning space to get to the places that existed in the untempered tuning space.</p><p>In a rank-2 temperament, we have only two axes: the period and the generator.  When we give a mapping for the temperament, as determined by the comma, one way to give it is by giving a val for each axis such that the two vals together are coordinates that correspond (usually) to the successive primes.  A rank-2 temperament can be derived from any level of JI dimensionality, but we will have to temper out more commas in order to reduce higher dimensions down to two.  For instance, we can give 5-limit meantone with the two vals &lt;1 1 0] and &lt;0 1 4], where the first val is the period, the second is the generator.  Taking the first number from each val, we have the coordinate (1, 0) or &quot;one period up, zero generators up&quot;, and that is how we get to 2/1.  The second number from each val gives (1, 1), or &quot;one period up, one generator up&quot; and that gets us to 3/1.  The third numbers give (0, 4) or &quot;zero periods up, four generators up&quot; and that gets us to 5/1.</p><p>We can reduce rank-2 temperaments to rank-1 temperaments, which are equal tunings (though not necessarily EDOs), by further tempering out another comma.  Any time we temper out a comma, we reduce the dimensionality of tuning-space.  Doing this means we can specify the mapping with a single val, and our generator is always going to be one step of the equal scale.  So the 5-limit val for 12-TET would be &lt;12 19 28]; a rank-1 val is also known as a &quot;Breed&quot;.  Of course, we can give mappings for tunings that are not the most accurate mappings; for 7-EDO, we could map 5/1 to its perfect 4th rather than its neutral 3rd, and give a val of &lt;7 11 17].  A &quot;patent val&quot; is the val that corresponds to the most accurate mapping of JI to steps of an ET.</p><p>Does that help?</p><p>Also, the whole random naming thing--this used to bother the crap out of me, but I&apos;ve since come to accept that with the plethora of things that need naming, there&apos;s no good clear logical way to go about it.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2011 4:43:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>I&apos;m cc&apos;ing this to tuning, because I think we should continue anything from<br/>this thread over there......but I appreciate your taking the time to lay<br/>this out here.</p><p>Much of this I already knew, but I think this is a nice executive summary<br/>for newbies and seasoned experts nonetheless.

I am, however, writing a book to precisely that purpose, and am almost finished with the introduction.  It is (so far) approximately 25 pages, and I explain first how we determine whether two notes will sound &quot;in tune&quot; or not (i.e. the basic principles of JI, including a discussion of partials and how they can be harmonic or inharmonic depending on the instrument), then I explain how to expand that concept to determine whether more than two notes will sound in tune, and in both places I give tables to show all the basic ratios that have the audible property of sounding beatless.  Then I explain how the ear and the mind are not interested in precise numerology and that irrational frequency relationships (and more complex rational relationships) can achieve a close enough effect via &quot;approximation&quot;.</p><p>Then I move into temperament by showing that the JI major scale doesn&apos;t work for regular music because it provides only 5 in-tune fifths, and I introduce the syntonic comma.  I then introduce the Pythagorean major scale and demonstrate how it solves the problem of &quot;not enough fifths&quot; but develops the problem of &quot;out of tune thirds and sixths&quot;.  Then I introduce meantone temperament and show how it solves both problems, and discuss the varieties of meantone (1/4 and 1/3 comma, specifically) and develop the distinction between a &quot;tuning&quot;, a &quot;temperament&quot;, and a &quot;scale&quot;.  I go on to discuss how the concept of meantone temperament can be generalized and that there are other temperaments we can produce to meet either the same harmonic goals (4:5:6 triads) or else different harmonic goals (any of the other JI triads that sound beatless).  To illustrate this, I introduce Magic temperament (which aims for the same 5-limit harmonies as meantone) and Superpyth (which I treat as having a 6:7:9 triadic basis).  I then introduce the concept of mapping, and concepts like period, generator, complexity and error in evaluating temperaments.</p><p>Then I move on to Distributionally-Even scales and talk about the properties that make them useful, and how they can be constructed by &quot;stacking&quot; a generator over and over and wrapping within the period until there are two step-sizes.  I explain that some generators eventually produce an equal scale, while other generators can go on dividing the period indefinitely, and what determines this is whether the generator is an integer fraction of the period or not (in terms of cents values).  I demonstrate this by constructing a couple different scales, one of which is the octatonic scale from 12-TET.</p><p>Then I clarify that temperaments produce DE scales but that the difference between them is that a temperament maps JI ratios to some number of generators and periods, whereas a DE scale does not specify a mapping but only a pattern of large and small steps.  Then I talk about how both are tuning-inspecific (they don&apos;t specify a tuning, but only a range of tunings).</p><p>THEN I move on to equal divisions of the octave, discussing their advantages (simplicity, compatibility with multiple temperaments, etc.) and illustrate how 12-TET can be interpreted as a variety of different temperaments by showing the different mappings it supports.</p><p>I may at this point also include a discussion of how beating is not necessarily a bad thing, and that accurate temperaments are not always what is desirable in music, and that simplicity may be a more important concern.</p><p>Then I move on to individual EDOs, showing what Just dyads and triads they approximate decently for their size, and then showing the simplest temperaments that support those triads (i.e. the ones that produce the most triads for the smallest DE scale).  I start at 5-EDO and work my way up to 41-EDO.  Anything I didn&apos;t clarify enough in the introduction, I clarify when it comes up as an issue in the various EDOs.</p><p>I don&apos;t introduce anymore terminology than is absolutely necessary, I try to be informal and humorous whenever possible, and I offer frequent encouragement and acknowledgement that this material is unusual and seems to have little to do with &quot;normal&quot; music theory.</p><p>Once I&apos;ve finished the 1st draft of the introduction, I plan on posting the file at Tuning and asking for feedback/proof-reading/additional input/etc.  I want both the &quot;experts&quot; and the &quot;laymen&quot;, as well as those with teaching backgrounds, to read it and rip it apart so that I can make it the best and most accessible text on the subject that&apos;s ever been written.  I know it&apos;s going to need more visual aids--I&apos;ll be asking for them as well, since I don&apos;t have any good sources of, say, pictures of sine waves interacting or the waveforms of various musical instruments.</p><p>At that point, Daniel, I will more than welcome your criticism.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 9:29:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Why 5&amp;19 gives Semaphore/Godzilla/Hemifourths/Semifourths<br/>&gt; instead of Meantone is a more subtle question.
