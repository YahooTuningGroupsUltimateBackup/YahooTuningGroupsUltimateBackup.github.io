I like the way he<br/>&gt; uses MIDI,  all of the &quot;cheesiness&quot; is there, but the music is very<br/>&gt; &quot;Wacky&quot; and so it all works nicely, I think.  The music would lose an<br/>&gt; essential humourous aspect of its character if it were played on very<br/>&gt; &quot;Smooth&quot;-sounding computer-sounds:  the &quot;clunky&quot;ness of MIDI is composed<br/>&gt; *into* the pieces, at least to my ear.</p><p>Much of your mideast/ mediteranean pop music is just as good of &quot;using timbre<br/>we would never use&quot;<br/>possibly it is the way we but things together, making a sound first then<br/>putting it in a piece.<br/> When ever i come off a binge of western classical music (and more modern<br/>counterparts) and jump into some traditional African music (not necessarily<br/>the drum stuff) I am  struck by timbres that lie so outside our culture  yet<br/>work in a harmonious way with each other. Maybe not harmonious but blrending<br/>in some alchemical fashion that still escapes us.<br/>African music is especially interesting in the combining of &quot;noise  elements&quot;<br/>as apart of their instruments (rattlling metal objects on thumb pianos for<br/>instance) that they would never do without.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; cb<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM 8-9PM PST</p></div>
