Thank you, Prent, for helping make so much music from so<br/>many people more easily available.</p><p>Also, before offering a first knowing submission for MMMYear, I&apos;d like<br/>to congratulate Christopher Bailey on _Balladei_, a title that might<br/>suggest to me some 14th-century French ballade, especially given the<br/>links to a neo-Gothic style. It&apos;s something fascinating, and I&apos;m<br/>trying to start by &quot;mapping&quot; the dynamics in different portions, so<br/>that I can adjust the volume as needed to hear the quiet parts while<br/>keeping the louder ones within an agreeable range for my imperfect<br/>ears. What I have heard already intrigues me, and I&apos;m looking forward<br/>to getting to know it better as well as to your theoretical discussion.</p><p>Now for the submission:</p><p>           &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>For the moment, a query: does this kind of improvisatory style fit in<br/>with the purpose of MMMYear as discussed in some of the previous<br/>posts? Of course, general musical feedback would be welcome also. Why<br/>don&apos;t I give people a chance to listen and let any dialogue move from<br/>there.</p><p>Again, thanks to Carl, Prent, and all for MMMDay and MMMYear.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
