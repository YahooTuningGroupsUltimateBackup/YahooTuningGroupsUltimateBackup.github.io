Just wasn&apos;t Wendy&apos;s criticism in this case.<br/>And needless to say, some would prefer the term &quot;rational intonation&quot;<br/>for JI that beats.</p><p>&gt; Just like ET is unlimited and in the hand of artist<br/>&gt; a pentatonic can yield new world of musical thought<br/>&gt; i can&apos;t say that what wendy might say might be of interest to me<br/>&gt; i liked winter of sonic seasonings, for a while. But to each his own.<br/>&gt;no one does anything that speaks to everyone.<br/>&gt;He just doesn&apos;t break any new ground for me outside of technological<br/>&gt;which is just not a point i care about.<br/>&gt; Money can always do that, can&apos;t it?.</p><p>The original Switched-On Bach was made on a pretty tight budget,<br/>or so I understand.  Since then she&apos;s had ample money for a home<br/>studio, I guess, but is hardly rich.</p><p>I like Beauty In The Beast, and I absolutely love Digital Moonscapes.<br/>Haven&apos;t listened to Sonic Seasonings much yet, but I have it.</p><p>I also think a bunch of her more experimental tracks from her early<br/>stuff were quite good... her middle movement of Brandenburg 3 (is it?)<br/>and Timesteps (was it?) from the Clockwork Orange soundtrack.</p><p>&gt; I much prefer Robert Rich, I have known him since the 80&apos;s when we<br/>&gt;shared some bills together.<br/>&gt; he was doing some great stuff with a prophet V in a live context that i<br/>&gt;found quite compelling.</p><p>I have several of his albums, and I think they&apos;re fine.  Less<br/>my style than Carlos, but fine listening for sure.  These new DVD<br/>looks pretty cool.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Joe &#x3C;tamahome02000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2007 10:53:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I believe Robert Rich live with the prophet V was captured on &apos;Inner Landscapes&apos;.  Not JI, but still one of my favorites.

Good folk too,<br/>I&apos;ve met him a few times, he asked me to open for him at the Knitting Factory a few years ago.<br/>He was touring with the modular. The thoughtful folks at the Knit booked a band after us<br/>and I was still using a cane at the time so I couldn&apos;t move the modular. But I could guard it<br/>while the bassist from the next band gave me crap for not moving it. My friend Marc and Robert ended up<br/>hauling it upstairs and outstide to his van.</p><p>Aways, I&apos;m looking for forward to checking out his next release.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2007 11:40:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to be a thread killer.</p><p>Arf, she said.</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
