Even though the control is impressive, I find it at least as impressive that you &apos;score it out&apos; first, rather than transliterating a midi improv/mock-up. But, then again, that is what we should expect from a Composer! :)</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve posted this before, but:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/micromidi/">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/micromidi/</a><br/>&gt;them&apos;s the tools.</p><p>One day I&apos;ll try using the tool. Would it be possible for you to collate the tutorial pages into just one .html page, either for downloading or &quot;saving as&quot;? I&apos;d like to take a close enough look to see if I could use another language to translate a textfile version of midi into your score format.</p><p>&gt;Well, this is old, but here&apos;s what I wrote in memoriam Lou Harrison:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/lou.mp3">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/sounds/lou.mp3</a></p><p>Yes, I like that one, and the suggestion was definitely tongue-in-cheek.</p><p>&gt;I also have a big project on the horizon with JJI . .but that&apos;s . .on the<br/>&gt;horizon . . .</p><p>Bigger than &quot;Sand&quot;?
