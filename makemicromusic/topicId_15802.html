Maybe about 25 years ago I heard a recording of<br/>Ukrainian music just a bit like this. There could also be a suggestion<br/>of some lively interpretations of medieval European dance music: the<br/>repeated and catchy phrases and the rhythmic motion can have that<br/>effect, very pleasantly unifying the piece.</p><p>The instrumentation is beautiful and captivating -- not that I&apos;m the<br/>first to say this! If I didn&apos;t know that this was a &quot;polymicrotonal&quot;<br/>piece, I might not have guessed: what I might hear is more a contrast<br/>of two themes or turns of phrase, very nicely done.</p><p>By the way, in some of this thread I saw interesting remarks, or links to<br/>remarks, about some of the source material being Near Eastern, and<br/>specifically an example of Maqam Rast -- which is subject to many<br/>different interpretations, apparently. It&apos;s fascinating how what struck me<br/>about your setting was the &quot;universal&quot; character -- and I should more<br/>closely consider the tuning system that you describe, another topic for<br/>further conversation.</p><p>Maybe we could discuss the piece more: I consider offering<br/>conversation about things that people have composed and shared here<br/>one of the most important purposes of MMM.</p><p>My apologies for not getting around to this sooner; in another message<br/>I&apos;ll explain some of the distractions.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
