I would call it &quot;Twentieth century<br/>&gt; neoclassical&quot;. So I would pigeonhole the pieces by Monroe Golden (the winner<br/>&gt; but not my favorite, BTW) as well as Shaahin Mohajeri, Martin Loridan, David<br/>&gt; Snow, Donald Craig, Cameron Bobro, Kathy McTavish, Chris Vaisvil and Chuckk<br/>&gt; Hubbard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pigeon hole &quot;Ambient/soundscape&quot; I would attach to the pieces by Jacques<br/>&gt; Dudon, Joseph Post, James Wyness, John Seales, Ann Cantelow, Giovanni<br/>&gt; Damiani, Joshua Musikantow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pieces in the contest that caught my attention are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacques Dudon - quite creative use of electronical sound manipulations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; James Wyness (as mentioned) - at first sight, a &quot;spectral&quot; piece based on<br/>&gt; overtones - but with quite surprising turns make it suspenseful, and<br/>&gt; pleasing timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ann Cantelow - quite original concept with series of glissandi that group<br/>&gt; to sudden harmonies. (That&apos;s what it sounds to me - maybe this has been done<br/>&gt; by others, too...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kathy McTavish - composition a little &quot;traditional&quot;, but beautiful string<br/>&gt; timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, as mentioned, Igs&apos; piece - for the vibraphone timbre and the<br/>&gt; impressive guitar climax. Less for the tuning, which I did not really like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for xenharmony - I gotta confess most of it did not &quot;catch&quot; me. The<br/>&gt; pieces of Giovanni Damiani and David Snow exhibit some xenharmonies not<br/>&gt; uninteresting to my ear, but the pieces in general I liked less...<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Hans Straub<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=25755 href="#25755">ðŸ”—</a>straub@...</h3><span>2/14/2011 7:31:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Your combination of dance-like energy, new age like softness,<br/>&gt; jazz-style solos, and ambient-like textures is, to my knowledge, not<br/>&gt; even an unusual combination.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Well if you know an electronica group that does do this...I&apos;m<br/>&gt; eager to hear.&Acirc;&nbsp;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I am not an expert in electronica - but, e.g., how about these:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=754876">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=754876</a><br/><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=179832">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=179832</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;I think it is nowadays next to impossible to do something that cannot be pigeonholed somewhere.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; So the idea of fresh/good new music is virtually dead?&Acirc;&nbsp; I<br/>&gt; have trouble believing it...and it seems like a double standard to<br/>&gt; say (paraphrased) &quot;try to make fresh new music&quot; and &quot;such a task is<br/>&gt; basically impossible&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmm, hehe...
