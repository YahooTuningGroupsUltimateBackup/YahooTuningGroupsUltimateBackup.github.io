The level of fidelity that was possible in the &apos;50s or &apos;60s or perhaps even the &apos;70s is nowhere near what is possible today.  To people who grow up listening to the slick hyper-realism of 21st century Top 40 music, those classic records sound like old photographs look: dated, washed-out, faded, and lacking detail.

In other words, he is saying that a good performance of a good song should outshine--at least to some extent--any loss of fidelity due to the technological shortcomings of the available recording media.  He is saying, it seems, that a cheap hand-held tape-recording of Paul McCartney singing &quot;Yesterday&quot; in his bedroom is still going to sound good, because Paul McCartney is a great musician and &quot;Yesterday&quot; is a great song.  And he&apos;s totally right.</p><p>But he is also totally missing the point.  Look what happens when you take the score to a song like &quot;Yesterday&quot;, strip it of its dynamics, and feed it into a synthesizer, reducing it to its bare harmonic and melodic components.  It sucks!  Even if you use the most expensive and highest-fidelity synths and samples available.  If the people of the world were introduced to the songs of the Beatles rendered like that--no dynamics, no humanity, just chords and melodies rendered with mechanical precision and synthetic timbres--the Beatles would not even warrant a footnote of a footnote in the history of pop music.</p><p>The criticisms frequently leveled at microtonal music have little or nothing to do with fidelity, so it&apos;s a straw man to argue that a low-fidelity recording of a great song by a great musician will still sound great.  The real problem is that microtonal compositions are frequently denied a rendering/arrangement that is appropriate to them, and typically sound synthetic and lifeless and devoid even of the technological gimmicks that makes most techno accessible.  It&apos;s nothing to do with fidelity or some nebulous &quot;lack of production quality&quot;, and (at least sometimes) it may not even be a fault in the composition (though that&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t plenty of bad compositions, either).  It&apos;s the difference between having a story read by a talented voice-actor vs. a computer speech synthesizer.  Even the most riveting work of literature will become boring if read by the latter.</p><p>So for goodness&apos;s sake, can you all drop the histrionics?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Stephens &lt;musicoptimist@...&gt;

They were on the forefront of multi-tracking and paved the way for all sorts of<br/>&gt; studio experimentation to create innovative timbres.&nbsp; While it is true they<br/>&gt; sometimes &quot;broke a few production rules&quot; along the way, they did so<br/>&gt; intentionally, knowing full well that they were &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Doors had a very uniquely recognizable &quot;vibe&quot;&nbsp;no small portion of which had<br/>&gt; to do with timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Ramones were intentionally under-produced.&nbsp; Their production and<br/>&gt; arrangements worked together to resulted in&nbsp;raw timbres custom designed to<br/>&gt; match&nbsp;the rag-tag&nbsp;high energy garage band&nbsp;punkishness they were trying to<br/>&gt; communicate.&nbsp;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In popular music recordings, timbre and production are&nbsp;very, very important -<br/>&gt; almost always crucial.&nbsp; Modern popular music listeners have been &quot;trained&quot; to<br/>&gt; immediately focus upon timbre, production and rhythm.&nbsp; That doesn&apos;t mean that<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t appreciate anything else.&nbsp; But they rarely separate a composition<br/>&gt; from its production and performance (unless they have already enjoyed another<br/>&gt; recording of the composition by another artist already).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That said, I would expect a much more sophisticated view on this list.&nbsp; I would<br/>&gt; expect musicians and composers to have a greater capacity to&nbsp;&quot;listen beyond&quot;<br/>&gt; timbre and production to form independent opinions about melodies and harmonies<br/>&gt;

And he&apos;s totally right.</p><p>But he is also totally missing the point.  Look what happens when you take the score to a song like &quot;Yesterday&quot;, strip it of its dynamics, and feed it into a synthesizer, reducing it to its bare harmonic and melodic components.  It sucks!  Even if you use the most expensive and highest-fidelity synths and samples available.  If the people of the world were introduced to the songs of the Beatles rendered like that--no dynamics, no humanity, just chords and melodies rendered with mechanical precision and synthetic timbres--the Beatles would not even warrant a footnote of a footnote in the history of pop music.</p><p>The criticisms frequently leveled at microtonal music have little or nothing to do with fidelity, so it&apos;s a straw man to argue that a low-fidelity recording of a great song by a great musician will still sound great.  The real problem is that microtonal compositions are frequently denied a rendering/arrangement that is appropriate to them, and typically sound synthetic and lifeless and devoid even of the technological gimmicks that makes most techno accessible.  It&apos;s nothing to do with fidelity or some nebulous &quot;lack of production quality&quot;, and (at least sometimes) it may not even be a fault in the composition (though that&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t plenty of bad compositions, either).  It&apos;s the difference between having a story read by a talented voice-actor vs. a computer speech synthesizer.  Even the most riveting work of literature will become boring if read by the latter.</p><p>So for goodness&apos;s sake, can you all drop the histrionics?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Stephens &lt;musicoptimist@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &lt;What happens to pieces where there are 3-4 instruments IE &quot;rock/pop style</p><p>&gt; orchestration&quot; ?&nbsp; It seems obvious to me both timbre and melody/harmony do</p><p>&gt; matter in those cases...&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I whole-heartedly agree with this.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &lt;and, if anything, if you have to lose one (far as making a song known as a</p><p>&gt; &quot;classic&quot;), it would be timbre (IE the Beatles/Ramones/ Doors...all had terrible</p><p>&gt; timbre/production).&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I actually think quite differently on this point.&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; The Beatles (for their era) had some of the most innovative production around.</p><p>&gt; They were on the forefront of multi-tracking and paved the way for all sorts of</p><p>&gt; studio experimentation to create innovative timbres.&nbsp; While it is true they</p><p>&gt; sometimes &quot;broke a few production rules&quot; along the way, they did so</p><p>&gt; intentionally, knowing full well that they were &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; The Doors had a very uniquely recognizable &quot;vibe&quot;&nbsp;no small portion of which had</p><p>&gt; to do with timbre.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; The Ramones were intentionally under-produced.&nbsp; Their production and</p><p>&gt; arrangements worked together to resulted in&nbsp;raw timbres custom designed to</p><p>&gt; match&nbsp;the rag-tag&nbsp;high energy garage band&nbsp;punkishness they were trying to</p><p>&gt; communicate.&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; In popular music recordings, timbre and production are&nbsp;very, very important -</p><p>&gt; almost always crucial.&nbsp; Modern popular music listeners have been &quot;trained&quot; to</p><p>&gt; immediately focus upon timbre, production and rhythm.&nbsp; That doesn&apos;t mean that</p><p>&gt; they don&apos;t appreciate anything else.&nbsp; But they rarely separate a composition</p><p>&gt; from its production and performance (unless they have already enjoyed another</p><p>&gt; recording of the composition by another artist already).</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; That said, I would expect a much more sophisticated view on this list.&nbsp; I would</p><p>&gt; expect musicians and composers to have a greater capacity to&nbsp;&quot;listen beyond&quot;</p><p>&gt; timbre and production to form independent opinions about melodies and harmonies</p><p>&gt; - even to conceive how those melodies and harmonies might sound with different</p><p>&gt; arrangements and production values.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;Mark Stephens</p><p>&gt; ProgPositivity - The Best Prog and Fusion - Positively!</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.progpositivity.com">http://www.progpositivity.com</a></p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=25803 href="#25803">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2011 6:21:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris&gt;&quot;Yes, yes, I 100% agree with you.

Obviously, interpretive and recoded quality come into play. Some interpreters bring more &apos;life&apos; (whatever that elusive thing is) to a piece. Jascha Heifetz said: &quot;there&apos;s no bad music, only bad interpretations&quot;. There&apos;s certainly a strong bit of truth there, in spite of the immediate sense that he&apos;s exagerrating. And I&apos;ve had moments where I&apos;ve felt it was *completely* true, as I&apos;ve come to like certain pieces more that I might not have even liked because of their interpreter&apos;s insights.</p><p>That said, I&apos;d be curious to hear the Beatles &quot;all 64 velocity&quot; renderings that Carl is referring to. I have extreme doubts that I&apos;d find them at all appealing, but, I&apos;m also open minded. And since we are discussing the Beatles in this thread, I will say that it&apos;s completely nuts to say their production values sucked. George Martin was amazing, and no records ever sounded that good, before then, and many since failed to achieve as good a sound, to my ears.</p><p>I don&apos;t relate to the arguments that people put forward about timbre and final sound (&apos;production&apos;) not mattering. It&apos;s like being a chef and not caring about the sensuous flavor and visual impact of your food. Music and food, in my book, should be on the same level---food should taste (and even look) good, and music should *sound* good. We should want seconds of the food, and we should want to hear that piece again. If the music doesn&apos;t *sound* good, the ideas behind it&apos;s construction may be interesting, but.....</p><p>Since timbre is part of the sound, I fail to understand, in the electronics age where we have timbral flexibility UNHEARD OF by previous generations of composers, why anyone would ignore it willingly!</p><p>Pierre Boulez said: &quot;I don&apos;t care what it sounds like, I want to know how it was made.&quot; My philosophy is 180&Acirc;&deg; apart from that! Mark Twain said it best: &quot;Wagner&apos;s music is better than it sounds.&quot;</p><p>I know the counter-argument: Bach, who wrote the &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; in &apos;abstract-not-specify-instrument-mode&apos;. Sure, but would he suffer a flat, dull performance of the work, in whatever medium? I&apos;m not talking about abstract undefined instrumentation, but about what happens when such an abstract score is realized. I think Bach would want it to sound amazingly good, with decent, nay, beautiful instruments played by beautifully sensitive performers.</p><p>I think in typically thrown together MIDI realizations for instance, bad timbre is the first thing I notice that makes me wince. I can definately say it&apos;s also the first thing that makes my wife, a non-musician, wince. And the lack of accents or diversity in the velocities (this only works in organ music, and there timbre changes with registration, and if you&apos;re lucky, the pipes sound gorgeous anyway.) There are certain complex cases: player piano music by Nancarrow, for example, where the certain robotic tinny sound of the player piano is *part* of the aesthetic. I suppose this is still entirely subjective, too: some folks probably dig an awful lot of GM MIDI timbres that I would rule out &apos;a priori&apos; from any current or future palette.</p><p>OTOH, I&apos;ve been know to like chiptune-type music with bland waveforms, so go figure. Maybe it&apos;s the sense in which I&apos;m aware that such composers are self-aware about the irony, and it &apos;feels&apos; right. Or maybe in that particular case, when I really like it, it comes down to caring about the next steps, or the starting composition just being really strong. Maybe, if one *really* doesn&apos;t care about timbres, but about pitch and pitch structures, just use plain old sine or triangle waves? They sound really great...</p><p>BTW, anyone heard of &quot;Bit Shifter&quot;? His chip-tune music is a good example of being all-around very musical in that particular genre, since I brought it up. I&apos;d love some more coat-pulls to other people doing similar work, right now I&apos;m way to bus to research.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AKJ</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is so incredibly false.

I agree somewhat, and I&apos;m saying that a lot<br/>of their music is great on that level, but so much more of it depends on<br/>technological imagination and &apos;tech orchestration&apos; that it simply is<br/>orthogonal to, say, a printed score of a Beethoven work.
