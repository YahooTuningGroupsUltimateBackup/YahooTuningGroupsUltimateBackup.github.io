What are the chances you might<br/>| have some mp3s we can hear?</p><p>Sadly, all I have are old MIDI files, and none of them are microtonal. But I do<br/>have that one piano composition in 13/8. I didn&apos;t actually *play* it though; I<br/>programmed it with NoteWorthy Composer.</p><p>Which I use because it&apos;s not too hard to plug in pitch bends for microtones. I<br/>tried to do that with Anvil, but it wanted me to pay such-and-such for a version<br/>with MIDI function inputs, including pitch bend and modulation wheel.</p><p>I&apos;ll upload &quot;13&quot; soon. (It was supposed to be the third movement of a piano<br/>sonata, but I only had that and the first movement -- in 7/8 and occasionally<br/>11/8 -- and I lost it and will have to rewrite.)</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ll write it out in 24-tone this time. I&apos;ve been studying Arabic<br/>_maqamat_ (modal scales) since I&apos;d prefer to rely a little on tradition and<br/>improvise from there.</p><p>~Danny~</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
