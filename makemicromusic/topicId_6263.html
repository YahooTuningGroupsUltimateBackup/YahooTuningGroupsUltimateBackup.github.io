It would have been easy to throw in _New Music Composition_ by David Cope (who I value as a friend and teacher) or even Schoenberg&apos;s _Fundamentals of Musical Composition_; but the truth is, I have not found either helpful for learning/thinking about my composing, although either may serve well as references on particular issues (for example, Schoenberg is an excellent reference on traditional Viennese styles).

Will there not be within some reasonable time a further<br/>enlargement of it?  To many, the introduction of the quarter-tone<br/>system is the answer to this question.</p><p>Scales may arise, as we have seen, in either of two ways: through the<br/>filling out of the octave with intervals measured by the proportions<br/>of the overtone series, and through the arithmetical division of the<br/>octave.  This book recommends the first of these, and the only way in<br/>which this system of scale-construction could be expanded would be by<br/>the use of the seventh overtone, for there is no compelling reason<br/>why we should choose arbitrarily among the proportions offered us by<br/>the overtone series, or skip over one of the overtones and choose the<br/>next one as a basis for further reckoning.  But I have shown that to<br/>reckon with overtones above the sixth leads to chaos.  The system<br/>cannot be enlarged in this direction.  The twelve-tone chromatic<br/>scale is, as far as we can humanly tell, the most complete solution<br/>of the problem -- at least for harmonic purposes.</p><p>The quarter-tone system proceeds from the second method of scale-<br/>construction.  It takes the equally tempered twelve-tone system as<br/>its point of departure.  That is a mistake.  We have seen that equal<br/>temperament does not offer a single scale-interval in pure form.  But<br/>what can be borne in a twelve-tone system becomes intolerable in a<br/>system in which there are twice as many tones that contradict<br/>nature.  Anyone who has heard quarter-tone music frequently,<br/>especially on keyboard instruments, knows that this is true, if his<br/>sense of hearing is healthy, and he has not allowed it to be clouded<br/>by preconceived opinions.  Stringed instruments can make this music<br/>barely tolerable, since even when working with these intervals they<br/>can so place the comma that the ear hears pure intervals instead of<br/>an uninterrupted series of mistuned ones.  But this must contradict<br/>the intention of the quarter-tone composer, for the correction of one<br/>of his intervals by the size of a comma is, proportionately, a<br/>considerable &quot;clouding&quot; of the interval. &gt;&gt;  [The Craft of Musical<br/>Composition, Book I, pp. 50-51]</p><p>From this last paragraph I would gather than Hindemith must have been<br/>(at least initially) uncomfortably cautious in playing Haba&apos;s<br/>quartertone music, but clearly his musical abilities were up to the<br/>challenge.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>George D.
