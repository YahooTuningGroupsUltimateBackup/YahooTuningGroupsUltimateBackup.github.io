This is<br/>really the essence of the microtonal movement -- composers are<br/>going to assert more control over intonation.  This idea simply<br/>didn&apos;t exist before the 20th century.*  Bach is the only other<br/>composer I know of to prescribe intonation, actually, and his<br/>prescription was quite brief and loose.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>* There actually was an obscure group thinking about intonation<br/>in the so-called &quot;musica reservata&quot; period.  They did write a few<br/>fragments in 5-limit JI, with comma inflections.  Vicentino&apos;s<br/>Madonna, il Poco Dolce is the only complete piece I know of.</p></div><h3><a id=21709 href="#21709">ðŸ”—</a>hpiinstruments &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2010 2:11:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Seidel &lt;dave@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In my opinion, retuning a composer&apos;s work just strikes me as<br/>&gt; disrespectful and condescending.</p><p>I think this depends on the attitude of the person who is<br/>recasting the music.

Everybody claims to listen to everything, but<br/>when you get into it, it&apos;s everything indie or everything techno<br/>etc.  In the classical world there&apos;s the early music faction,<br/>and the atonalists.  I think these divisions are caused by learning<br/>requirements for each instrument, and each form -- there&apos;s a hump<br/>you have to get over before you can extract information and<br/>appreciate what you&apos;re hearing.  I don&apos;t actually think microtonalism<br/>faces unusual hurdles here, though certainly some experienced<br/>musicians have negative reactions.  I thought 7-limit piano sounded<br/>badly out of tune when I first heard it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=21952 href="#21952">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2010 8:38:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I recently had a re-listen to Gene&apos;s Choraled piece.

Everybody claims to listen to everything, but<br/>when you get into it, it&apos;s everything indie or everything techno etc.&quot;</p><p>    Funny thing is, I still see Magnus&apos;s point.  And it&apos;s not just for micro-tonal.  I used to mostly listen to very complex non-repetitive shred rock and metal including Satriani and Metallica, the latter of which has strong classical roots, listened to some alt rock, and I hated techno.<br/>   However after that I lived in Europe for 4 years and my ear started to hear and enjoy all the subtle timbres and effects tricks and gained ability to analyze and appreciate the complexity in some of the breaks and back-beats rather than just focusing on the repetitive &quot;boom-hiss-boom-hiss&quot; parts.  Before you know it I was into drum and bass because it elaborated on the creativity in rhythm and break-beats from techno and got into trip-hop for similar reasons, which led me to appreciate certain hip-hop songs and see the parallels to drum and bass beats (which are often double-time hip-hop beats).  Meanwhile the appreciation of timbre got me into ambient.music and chill-out and appreciation for the energy of techno got me into Goa trance.   At the same time the soul vocals and tone-bending of house, a slower kind of techno, led me toward even genres such as country music (Darius Rucker) and gave me a new appreciation for 1/4 tone blues even after shred<br/> had rendered it &quot;too slow&quot; for me before.  Now I actually listen to mostly shred rock and virtually any type of electronica including the older 80&apos;s electronica and Herbie Hancock, but can honestly say there is no genre I know of I haven&apos;t heard at least a few great songs in except the noise, gabber, and rap-metal genres.</p><p>    In general I&apos;d say of genres, including micro-tonality if  you want to call it one...is that people need time to learn to &quot;separate the wheat from the chaff&quot; when listening to new types of music.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t actually think microtonalism faces unusual hurdles here, though certainly some experienced<br/>musicians have negative reactions.&quot;<br/>   I compare my first reaction to micro-tonalism to my early experiences of hearing techno...all I heard at first was a bunch of notes seeming in stuck the middle of transitions/portamentos between the tones I knew with more beating that seemed a bit out of control yet not contributing to the energy of the music.   Later on I started the interpret that beating as being arranged, lending greatly to the energy of the music, and even making transitions between lighter and darker sounding chord smoother.</p><p>    To make micro-tonal music successful across the board I think we should be careful not to move too quickly in how we introduce it.  An easy example is showing how JI intervals can purify existing music before introducing scale with interval classes that simply don&apos;t exist in the standard 7-tone diatonic subsets of JI and things like Wilson&apos;s MOS scales and 22TET and beyond into more experimental scales.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
