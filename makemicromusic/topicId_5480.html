This synth is a sound designer&apos;s dream and the presets are<br/>incredible - 6 banks of 128 sounds easily tweaked on the very friendly GUI.</p><p>As I&apos;m in a hurry to come up with some theatre music, I&apos;ll simply be<br/>layering microtuned presets and tweaking filters. Microtuning is a cinch BTW<br/>- drop a menu and choose a scala file.</p><p>First impressions of Kontakt are good. Samplers always take a bit of getting<br/>used to but you can see straight off where they&apos;re coming from with the<br/>layout. Of special interest is a fine tuning knob (in cent increments) but I<br/>could only see myself using it to fine tune, say, a gong sample or another<br/>long sustain sound which occupies a whole instrument slot.</p><p>The Firewire 410 is an excellent module. I haven&apos;t read any reviews but it<br/>works every time, bangs out sound of the highest quality and is easy to use.<br/>It&apos;s a 4-in, 10-out module, records at up to 96kHz and plays back at up to<br/>192 kHz sampling rates. It&apos;s about half rack and easy to tuck into a satchel<br/>or laptop case.</p><p>In case anybody&apos;s interested I&apos;m running all this from a fully specced<br/>laptop with a 3.06 chip and two partitioned hard-drives, all very easy to<br/>carry to and from gigs, venues and producers/directors. Well sorted as they<br/>say.</p><p>The only problem - Windows, which after MacOS is total pants. It&apos;s a<br/>nightmare to go online with because of viruses and the Microsoft site is<br/>more like a battlegroup bulletin board than a software site. I&apos;d say to any<br/>microtonal musicians thinking of switching platforms to think carefully. Yes<br/>you get more power in the chips with laptops, a wider variety of<br/>applications, but you&apos;re entering a circle of pain...</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>a.m.</p></div><h3><a id=5481 href="#5481">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2003 2:20:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison Monteith wrote:</p><p>&gt;The Firewire 410 is an excellent module.
