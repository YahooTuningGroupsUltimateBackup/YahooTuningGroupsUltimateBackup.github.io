You don&apos;t need to join, you can just surf there and post if you like. I&apos;d MMM to be a place that topics of tenuous connection can be approached and discussed, but for all of us to be mindful of our central focus: Making Microtonal Music.</p><p>High signal-to-noise ratio is the best tuning (to mangle a phrase...).</p><p>Cheers to all,<br/>ListMom</p></div>
