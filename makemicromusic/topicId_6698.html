New Albion Records (2002),<br/>San Francisco, no catalog number listed. 26 tracks, 75 minutes.</p><p>Burman-Hall performs on single &amp; double harpsichords, tack piano, and<br/>fortepiano. The liner notes are extensive (and in small print).</p><p>This is a pleasant CD that includes a variety of mood pieces and a set of<br/>&quot;sonatas&quot; for cembalo in historic tunings. (That&apos;s &quot;sonata&quot; in the early<br/>Scarlatti sort of sense as short one-movement pieces.) Many of the pieces<br/>are rather &quot;nostalgic&quot;, I guess you&apos;d say, for an earlier, gentler age.<br/>This is a nice introduction to microtonality to spring on your friends<br/>who&apos;ve never heard of &quot;tuning&quot;.</p><p>Tunings on the CD include Werkmeister III, Kirnberger II, and several of<br/>Lou Harrison&apos;s own &quot;well temperaments&quot;, and one 7-limit JI tuning.</p><p>Except for the very first piece on the album, which for some reason turned<br/>me off, I enjoyed the whole thing. Definitely worth a spin for anyone who<br/>likes the harpsichord, early music, or well-temperaments.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
