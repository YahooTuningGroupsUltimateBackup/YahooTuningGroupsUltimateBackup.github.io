Well known is the attempt by Alois H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ba. He was aware that in order<br/>&gt; to preproduce native songs of his countrymen in Czechoslovakia he needed a<br/>&gt; finer grain, so to speak, and therefore he halved the equal semitones. He<br/>&gt; tried to use quarter-tones. However, it is clear that by simply adding 12<br/>&gt; more notes between the existing 12 notes one cannot improve the harmonic<br/>&gt; relationships and the musical quality of the original 12 notes. What one<br/>&gt; needs for improvement is not quarter-tones but fifths of tones - the system<br/>&gt; Huygens used.<br/>&gt;         Again, Bela Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k, the Hungarian composer who died in 1945 in the United<br/>&gt; States, recognizing the value of the Hungarian peasant music both as a living<br/>&gt; tradition and as a source of inspiration for modern music, stated that he<br/>&gt; over and over again met the interval of the harmonic seventh and that he<br/>&gt; therefore laid at the bottom, as a basic foundation for music, a chord of<br/>&gt; four notes, adding the perfect seventh to the common chord. Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s<br/>&gt; testimony carries great weight, for he was one of the very greatest modern<br/>&gt; composers. Therefore, for the evolution of music, it is very urgent that we<br/>&gt; find an equal temperament suitable for the reproduction of Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s<br/>&gt; fundamental chord, which may be specified by the harmonic numbers 4:5:6:7.<br/>&gt; The &quot;tricesimoprimal&quot; equal temperament discovered by Huygens 3 centuries ago<br/>&gt; fulfills the requirement...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now I&apos;m really interested in perusing Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k&apos;s  output for two violins, (the<br/>&gt; 44 duos), which nicely blurs the distinction between the classical style of<br/>&gt; playing, and the earthier &apos;fiddle&apos; style.....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I have no problem with the meantone 2nd. OTOH, sometimes I *do* have a<br/>problem with not being able to use the triad built on D major in a C<br/>major-based tuning because of the D-A fifth sucking!! I stress the<br/>*sometimes* (as you know, I&apos;m fond of Centaur, for instance, for many uses) I<br/>know the JI argument: write differently !!! I can and do: sometimes. But when<br/>I want the D major chord to sound just dandy, I chose not to use JI. It&apos;s<br/>practical for me: I don&apos;t have time and money to get into alternate keyboards<br/>or hand-made instruments, etc.</p><p>I wish I did!</p><p>But still, I don&apos;t believe that Bach *works* in JI. And I don&apos;t believe I want<br/>to cut Bach from my diet, or any Bach-like music, or Renaissance 1/4 comma<br/>meantone (or much of Western music history) on a technicality related to an<br/>a-priori attachment to JI !!</p><p>&gt;     I do object to Darreg&apos;s notion the JI has a mood. It doesn&apos;t have any<br/>&gt; such thing as it encompasses an infinite array of intervals in just as many<br/>&gt; configurations.

The only way to escape them is to abandon them.</p><p>Well, I could turn the tables on this argument: If you have an infinite array<br/>of intervals, presumably to keep them from beating, where is your contrast?<br/>The contrast you speak of applies to JI&apos;s limitations within a finite set of<br/>pitches, no? Or to an unequal temperament. Modulation from one beatless chord<br/>to another is as contrast-less as from one slightly beating chord to another,<br/>as in ET&apos;s, no?</p><p>If one is not interested in limiting oneself, one shouldn&apos;t stick to *only*<br/>JI, but either mix tunings as Jon suggests, or use the infinite spectrum of<br/>intervals, and include the irrationals as well, of which there is an even<br/>greater infinity, as Cantor proved (athough you could argue that the ear<br/>hears only a finite practical subset of any infinite set of usable intervals)</p><p>Stravinsky said he liked to compose with a sense of knowing the limits of what<br/>he was working with. In fact he said he couldn&apos;t compose without limits. In a<br/>sense, I agree with his sentiment. As you do too, in practice. You pick the<br/>limits of Eikosany. I pick, say 19-tet or 31-tet. I&apos;m througly convinced<br/>great music can be written in any tuning whatsoever ;)</p><p>It seems awfully severe to &apos;abandon&apos; or dimiss any music making based on ET&apos;s<br/>to me....that&apos;s fine though, if that&apos;s your personal mission, to write great<br/>stuff as you have, based on that philosophy. I just know it&apos;s not my path to<br/>reject, but to remain open and explore. I will say however, that in the<br/>interest of getting down to writing, it helps to pick a path to explore and<br/>stick to it--one of the maddening things about tuning is how many great<br/>possibilities there are--perhaps this is what Stravinsky was talking about<br/>when he talked about picking limits !!</p><p>Anyway, I find that JI does have a certain &apos;mood&apos; to me: to my ears, it&apos;s hard<br/>not to sound New Age writing in JI, something I&apos;m keen to avoid. Most, not<br/>all music written in JI comes across as having a static-contemplative-relaxed<br/>vibe, and that&apos;s fine if you want it, but it&apos;s not the only thing I want my<br/>music to express. I certainly love JI tunings that are rich in beating, in<br/>which case, for me, it seems absurd to insist that the beating be derived<br/>from rational tuning designed to eliminate beating for other intervals !!</p><p>I don&apos;t know...I rarely judge music based on its technical features, which are<br/>a means to an end. Tuning to me is a technical feature, not an end in itself.<br/>If the music moves me, I don&apos;t care what tuning it&apos;s in, although I prefer the<br/>otherness of *any* alternate tuning for the variety it would offer from<br/>12-tet.....but even 12-tet is fine for me many times. Why be reactionary?<br/>Should I stop listening to Stravinsky&apos;s music in 12-tet? I *like* being an<br/>omnivore !</p><p>What about electronic music with no apparantly clear tuning at all? (&apos;Silver<br/>Apples of the Moon&apos; of Morton Subotnick) Is it not good because it doesn&apos;t<br/>have a array of clear pitches to start with, and is it even worse for the<br/>pitches not being JI?</p><p>&gt;     Et &apos;s also have allot in common with electronic music.

Any irrational can be approximated as<br/>closely as one likes with the rational numbers and vice versa.</p><p>Someone said something about ETs being closed systems, while<br/>JI is an open system.  Not true.  Any single ET is closed, but<br/>so is any single JI scale.  The possible variety of either<br/>*class* of tunings is infinite.</p><p>So what is meant by this age-old debate?  My guess is that<br/>through some accident of history, a particular style associated<br/>itself with JI, while another style associated itself with ET.<br/>And the two styles, for some other reason, are really just into<br/>arguing with one another -- the content of the argument is<br/>secondary -- and &apos;ETs&quot; vs. JI&apos; is just a welcome focal point.</p><p>Or perhaps what is meant is: &apos;low-numbered ETs&apos; vs. &apos;high-limit<br/>JI&apos;.  Or maybe it&apos;s: &apos;12-tET vs. 5-limit JI&apos;.  Or maybe it&apos;s:<br/>&apos;tunings that approximate JI&apos; vs. &apos;tunings that don&apos;t try to<br/>approximate JI&apos;.  Or perhaps it&apos;s: &apos;people who think 2-cent<br/>errors are acceptable&apos; vs. &apos;people who think 0.0002-cent errors<br/>are acceptable&apos;.</p><p>But if it is any of those things, why not just use those terms<br/>instead of &apos;ETs vs. JI&apos;?

Leave it to you to come up with that! Well, it is a clever analog, probably no closer to painting/ET comparisons than anything, but worthy of consideration. Sure, there are times when absolute grid-like rhythmic constructs work for me; for instance, contemporary dance music (trance, electronica) seems perfectly suited, esp. since most of it is computer-derived, not to mention that the regularity of the beat makes it easier on Western youth to find the rhythm.</p><p>But even when one constructs, ahead of time, a 16th-note rhythm, there are always - when it sounds good to me - subtle inflections of time. A good example would be to listen to a samba pattern played by a college percussion ensemble (that has never learned Brazilian music) and then the same stuff played by Brazillians. You&apos;d need lots of beams and dots to adequately notate the feel they give to the pattern. Lots of musical cultures could be looked at this way.</p><p>For insight into how much someone might care in the *opposite* direction, albeit in a creative vein, check out at your leisure the nano-correction of tempo and other aspects done by BT in some of his music:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/33u25">http://tinyurl.com/33u25</a></p><p>I know you were being sly in your response, but it does cause me pause: there *is* symmetry in nature, and there are instances of &quot;equality&quot; that I like. But words sometimes fail when discussing the deepest aspect of the art(s) we love. I initially loved the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, certainly not shy of straight lines and even spacing (at times); it kind of fell by the wayside when I discovered the work of Charles Rennie Macintosh, who combined similar elements with more rounded and organic structures.

You&apos;re talking about using a JI system<br/>not as a way to create scales, but a way to create whatever sound you need<br/>in any instance.  This is a new idea for me.</p><p>In my very preliminary experiments in JI, I&apos;ve played some common scales and<br/>made a bunch of my own, but I&apos;ve been limited to twelve notes on my software<br/>synthesizer.  I have often found that I want an interval above some note of<br/>the scale, and it&apos;s not there, while it&apos;s there for a different note.</p><p>I think one of the greatest differences between a JI scale and an equal<br/>tempered scale is this:</p><p>In an equal tempered scale, there are exactly as many different intervals as<br/>there are notes to the octave.  Each note of the scale has the ability to<br/>travel the distance of any one of those intervals.</p><p>In a JI scale, there are many more intervals than notes in the scale.  Each<br/>note has a collection of different intervals it can move in either<br/>direction.  It is different among notes.</p><p>You&apos;re talking about a new kind of JI (new for me), one that isn&apos;t bound to<br/>a scale.  In this kind of system, there are infinite possible intervals, and<br/>each note is capable of traveling the distance of any interval you can think<br/>of.  Infinity!</p><p>Wow!</p><p>Well, I know I&apos;m not ready for infinity, for a variety or reasons.  I think<br/>all composers need to set limits for themselves so they don&apos;t go crazy and<br/>can make sense of things.  To me, an equal temperament seems like a<br/>reasonable limit to set.  x number of intervals, x number of notes, each<br/>interval available to each note.  An interconnected but not infinite JI<br/>scale makes sense as a different kind of limit.  Lots of intervals,<br/>dispersed all over the place.  A limited number of notes and a limited<br/>collection of abilities given to each note.  These two kinds of scale<br/>satisfy different needs.  They create different limits.  They&apos;re wonderfully<br/>different.</p><p>Thanks again for your perspective, Kraig.

You&apos;re talking about using a JI system<br/>&gt; not as a way to create scales, but a way to create whatever sound you need<br/>&gt; in any instance.  This is a new idea for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my very preliminary experiments in JI, I&apos;ve played some common scales and<br/>&gt; made a bunch of my own, but I&apos;ve been limited to twelve notes on my software<br/>&gt; synthesizer.  I have often found that I want an interval above some note of<br/>&gt; the scale, and it&apos;s not there, while it&apos;s there for a different note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think one of the greatest differences between a JI scale and an equal<br/>&gt; tempered scale is this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In an equal tempered scale, there are exactly as many different intervals as<br/>&gt; there are notes to the octave.  Each note of the scale has the ability to<br/>&gt; travel the distance of any one of those intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a JI scale, there are many more intervals than notes in the scale.  Each<br/>&gt; note has a collection of different intervals it can move in either<br/>&gt; direction.  It is different among notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re talking about a new kind of JI (new for me), one that isn&apos;t bound to<br/>&gt; a scale.  In this kind of system, there are infinite possible intervals, and<br/>&gt; each note is capable of traveling the distance of any interval you can think<br/>&gt; of.  Infinity!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I know I&apos;m not ready for infinity, for a variety or reasons.  I think<br/>&gt; all composers need to set limits for themselves so they don&apos;t go crazy and<br/>&gt; can make sense of things.  To me, an equal temperament seems like a<br/>&gt; reasonable limit to set.  x number of intervals, x number of notes, each<br/>&gt; interval available to each note.  An interconnected but not infinite JI<br/>&gt; scale makes sense as a different kind of limit.  Lots of intervals,<br/>&gt; dispersed all over the place.  A limited number of notes and a limited<br/>&gt; collection of abilities given to each note.  These two kinds of scale<br/>&gt; satisfy different needs.  They create different limits.  They&apos;re wonderfully<br/>&gt; different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks again for your perspective, Kraig.  It got me thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Andrew<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Andrew and yes do enjoy your CD!<br/>&gt; &gt;      When i work in JI i am always aware of how i am plowing in a<br/>&gt; &gt; particular<br/>&gt; &gt; field where from each point it is possible to expand further. With Et i am<br/>&gt; &gt; in a<br/>&gt; &gt; closed cycle and there is no way to add anything to it. It is unable to<br/>&gt; &gt; grow. (<br/>&gt; &gt; of course one can always start dividing each temperment into smaller equal<br/>&gt; &gt; divisions).<br/>&gt; &gt;     Partch referred to his 43 tone scale. In actuality he had way more<br/>&gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; on any of these degrees he could and would put whole harmonic and<br/>&gt; &gt; subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; hexads. The instruments themselves found their own natural way out of the<br/>&gt; &gt; system.<br/>&gt; &gt;     Even if one does not have a particular note for example, it is quite<br/>&gt; &gt; easy<br/>&gt; &gt; to ask any player to play a fifths a fourth or a Just third relations to<br/>&gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; without too much trouble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; __________________________________<br/>&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>&gt; Friends.
