The pitch shifter is used by DJs to slow or fasten up a song, so they can mix it with a previous song. Basically a matter of regulating tempo. Of course the pitch shifter changes the note pitch as well. It&apos;s not a new idea, but i haven&apos;t heard it in microtonal music yet. And it can be pretty convenient. With the proper sounds and the right turntable (Vestax QFO) the turntable can be used as an instrument.<br/>   I&apos;m working on new and better tracks. If the first one is finished, I&apos;ll post a YOutube clip for demonstration.</p><p>   Technical:<br/>A Vestax turntable and Mixer. The Mixer is used for slow or fast volume manipulation.<br/>Traktor Scratch (Native Instruments) software and Interface (Audio 8 DJ) to connect the computer to the turntables.<br/>Then whatever sounds i want to use. Mellotron, Strings, Vocals, Synths, etc. Put them into a wav. or MP3 format and send them to Traktor Scratch.</p><p>If you have a record player at home with a pitch shifter, play around with it. The first obvious thing is: microtonal notes!</p><p>Greetings,<br/>Raed</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is so disorientating - in a good way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not being into DJ stuff - how do you play melodies on a turntable?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Wed, Dec 15, 2010 at 5:24 PM, Raed &lt;raedkhashoukgi@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I uploaded a new rough sketch of a microtonal song.
