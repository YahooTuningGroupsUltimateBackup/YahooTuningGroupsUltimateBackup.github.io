Once i heard a piece on the radio that was so bad that i listened till the end just so i would know to avoid the composer at all cost. Dare i say it was a long wait or it seemed so..<br/>As for Henry flint who showed his films here, one was nothing more than the star gate scene from 2001 which he stated he was taking out of context( now isn&apos;t that imaginative!). To anyone who ever saw 2001, this section was already &apos;out of context&apos;, a &apos;short&apos; added to the end. I assume he didn&apos;t understand the film in the first place and he got burned messing with a work by a real as opposed to an academic artist. Combining a few cheesy blues licks to fake Indian music that if he wasn&apos;t a white person no one would care. I can&apos;t tell you how many amplified violins i saw in the 60&apos;s.<br/>There possibly isn&apos;t any more art, just celebrities.

Sometimes i wonder how much of his chance pieces were chance, or as much as he said. It seems many do not get the same results with the same processes. Perhaps he took a lead from Duchamp who played with many by attributing his work all being based on his attraction to his sister. Probably mocking the Freudians of his time. Others have pointed out other things going on.<br/>Cage was not one to shy from hard work which is what separates him much from his imitators.</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JULIAN SILVERMAN wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Actually if there is one thing you&apos;ve got to admire Cage for, it is his<br/>&gt; &gt;willingness to be both of these: i.e. to inspire in us doubt and<br/>&gt; &gt;dissatisfaction about aesthetic purposes which we had not sufficiently<br/>&gt; &gt;questioned.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I always liked any of his music for prepared piano.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- &gt; * David Beardsley<br/>&gt; * microtonal guitar<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=17552 href="#17552">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2007 1:47:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Julian,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;JULIAN SILVERMAN&quot;<br/>&lt;julian.silverman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I was making a rash judgement with little<br/>&gt; knowledge of the work of either</p><p>Well, you see, that is the part that came through loud and clear, and<br/>expressed in such an erudite and compelling manners: scare quotes<br/>around the word composer.</p><p>When you&apos;ve listened, not to a couple works, but a broad survey of a<br/>good portion of their musics, then we&apos;ll have a real nice discussion.<br/>Until you do, there is hardly need to &quot;defend&quot; any of these three.

Tell us what you think is good about these<br/>composers. Some members of this list have. I have given my opinion, or a<br/>little part of it, and explained why I feel what I feel to some extent.<br/>Can&apos;t you do us that favour too? Or are you treating us on this list<br/>like Cage treated his public?</p><p>Yes. I too like(d) some of his early prepared piano music, and also e.g.<br/>his string quartet. What an  inspired idea to make the whole piece up<br/>from prepared and poignant snippets put into a pattern, like a French<br/>Baroque &quot;.en rondeau&quot;, only more so! The same with &apos;Sonatas and<br/>Interludes&apos;. At that time he discovered something true about the way<br/>music works. But only one thing. Once he&apos;d got that idea - that It was<br/>the pattern that made the music, he could do no other than follow this<br/>insight through to the end - a pattern - OK, but why only of notes? Why<br/>not of actions? (cf some of Cornelius Cardew&apos;s things) Why have a<br/>pattern at all? And these were no academic questions for Cage. He was<br/>impelled to actually do them and be somebody, and his grasp of music was<br/>insufficient to develop anything deeper. [Of course the actual<br/>deliberately meaningless jumble of arbitrary sounds could sound quite<br/>exciting for a half a minute or so - so long as enough of them were<br/>going on together: like in &apos;hpschd&apos; etc.]</p><p>Stage-by-stage he gradually and at first unconsciously developed from<br/>young charming naivity to middle-aged pretentiousness and by the end, to<br/>downright  deliberate charlatanism. How do I know this? If you want I<br/>will give plenty of examples but you probably know enough of them not to<br/>mind being duped. Of course I don&apos;t really know how much he knew what a<br/>fake he had become. I&apos;m just guessing. But why don&apos;t you tell us what<br/>you think?</p><p>Have you tried listening to Cage&apos;s &apos;4&apos;33&quot;&apos; or Young&apos;s &apos;1053 (or however<br/>many) for Henry Flint&apos;? Did you enjoy the experience? As for Harrison,<br/>pieces I hsve heard show that he could actually compose - put notes<br/>together that made sense - I haven&apos;t heard a lot of his music. Please<br/>tell me about  it. What would you recommend? So far I haven&apos;t yet heard<br/>anything beyond the routine, but please defend him if you do like his<br/>work.

Of the three, Cage is the odd bird in this<br/>discussion, if only for the fact that both Young and Harrison were so<br/>very much devoted to non-12-tet musics.</p><p>But that, already, is more than needed to be said.</p><p>&gt; Or are you treating us on this list<br/>&gt; like Cage treated his public?</p><p>I guess I can forgive you that remark, but just so you know: as of<br/>yesterday, this list is six years and one month old. And I happen to<br/>be the guy that started it, along with two of my colleagues. I know<br/>the populace of the list pretty darn well, having watched it grow over<br/>the last half+ decade.</p><p>So it isn&apos;t so much that I feel a need to defend these three<br/>composers, whom I know pretty well, but to make a call on someone who<br/>is disparaging their output without, in at least one or more case,<br/>being familiar with the breadth of their catalog.</p><p>&gt; Stage-by-stage he gradually and at first unconsciously developed from<br/>&gt; young charming naivity to middle-aged pretentiousness and by the end, to<br/>&gt; downright deliberate charlatanism.</p><p>Aha. &quot;Deliberate charlatanism&quot;. Pretty strong words. I happen to be<br/>closely associated with a rather prominent microtonal composer who<br/>himself had a very, very disdainful view of Mr. Cage, so it isn&apos;t an<br/>unheard-of viewpoint. But I suspect a very surface understanding of<br/>Cage is at work here, as well as a somewhat circumspect definition of<br/>&quot;music&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Have you tried listening to Cage&apos;s &apos;4&apos;33&quot;&apos;...</p><p>I&apos;ve &quot;performed&quot; it on a couple of concerts, in conjunction with other<br/>Cage pieces (and on one concert, the Cage/Harrison &quot;Double Music&quot;). So<br/>you could say I&apos;m familiar with it. And I also believe in conceptual<br/>art, while there a lot of people think that unless is isn&apos;t a painting<br/>in a frame on a wall it probably isn&apos;t art. Especially if it doesn&apos;t<br/>look good over their sofa.</p><p>&gt; As for Harrison,<br/>&gt; pieces I have heard show that he could actually compose - put notes<br/>&gt; together that made sense - I haven&apos;t heard a lot of his music.</p><p>Pretty bold to diss it in the OP then. But nvm.</p><p>&gt; What would you recommend?</p><p>Oh, geez, there are a good number of lovely pieces. I&apos;m pressed for<br/>time at the moment, but I promise to make a very short list of my<br/>favorites and even see if there are some online resources to listen,<br/>and get back to you on the list. I really, really liked Lou&apos;s music,<br/>and had a number of occasions to visit with him and talk about music<br/>and life. There are a few people on the list, if somewhat<br/>peripherally, that knew him even better (Bill Alves comes to mind),<br/>and he *certainly* was a great friend of those interested in<br/>microtonality. And a good composer, too, not just a sweet guy. :)</p><p>&gt; So far I haven&apos;t yet heard anything beyond the routine,<br/>&gt; but please defend him if you do like his<br/>&gt; work. Why hold back?</p><p>Once again, I don&apos;t think artist like this need a &quot;defense&quot;. Either<br/>their work speaks to you, or it doesn&apos;t, but nothing I&apos;m going to say<br/>is going to make a piece &quot;better&quot;. Besides, I have no idea what your<br/>idea of &quot;routine&quot; is, or how being not-routine would work for you. My<br/>guess is that you&apos;d like it to be different, but not *too* different,<br/>and that ties back into your use of the term music.</p><p>Tell you what: the best way would be for anyone else who finds worth<br/>and inspiration in the works of these three to simply post suggestions<br/>of pieces they find most compelling, and then you can go exploring on<br/>your own.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=17557 href="#17557">ðŸ”—</a>plopper6 &#x3C;billwestfall@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2007 10:13:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; ....<br/>&gt; Tell you what: the best way would be for anyone else who finds worth<br/>&gt; and inspiration in the works of these three to simply post suggestions<br/>&gt; of pieces they find most compelling, and then you can go exploring on<br/>&gt; your own.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;d recommend The Barton Workshop Plays John Cage.
