The source code is on the liner notes page<br/>on my web site at <a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net</a> or directly at<br/><a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/listen/DRYHOL6.CSD">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/listen/DRYHOL6.CSD</a> and<br/><a href="http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/listen/dryhol6.txt">http://prodgers13.home.comcast.net/listen/dryhol6.txt</a> for the<br/>preprocessor source code with note names.</p><p>The piano piece was called Resolution in Blue.</p><p>I create the pieces using the macro language, which generates Csound<br/>input. Notes have names, like &amp;B7/4., &amp;G3/2., and &amp;B11/6. and these<br/>are translated in to numbers, which Csound indexes to tables of<br/>fractional values, which then become frequencies. Each note gets its<br/>own duration, glissando, volume, start time, envelope, stereo value,<br/>note and octave. Each sample based instrument plays notes. Csound<br/>automatically generates a new instrument if they overlap. The<br/>preprocessor allows any number of indirections. By this I mean you can<br/>create a macro of a note, and another macro of that macro combined<br/>with another, and another, to any number of offsets. For example, the<br/>indication:</p><p>&amp;al-g16/11maj1d.</p><p>refers to a macro defined as</p><p>.al-g16/11maj1d &amp;flu.&amp;bas-g16/11maj1a*. &amp;obo.&amp;bas-g16/11maj1a*.<br/>&amp;cla.&amp;bas-g16/11maj1a*. &amp;frn.o-1&amp;bas-g16/11maj1a*.<br/>&amp;bas.&amp;bas-g16/11maj1a*.</p><p>In turn, &amp;bas-g16/11maj1a*. was previously defined as any of the<br/>following choices:</p><p>.bas-g16/11maj1a1 d84v-3&amp;g16/11. d6&amp;b20/11. d6<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a2 &amp;basran.d18h8e8&amp;basran.&amp;g16/11maj-3u-a*.d12<br/>d18o-1&amp;g16/11maj-3u-b*.d12<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a3 &amp;basran.d12h8e8&amp;basran.&amp;g16/11maj-3u-a*.d24<br/>d12o-1&amp;g16/11maj-3u-b*.d24<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a4 d24r0 &amp;basran.d12h8e8&amp;basran.&amp;g16/11maj-3u-a*.<br/>o-1&amp;g16/11maj-3u-b*.<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a5 d24r0 &amp;basran.d6h8e8&amp;basran.&amp;g16/11maj-3u-a*.d24<br/>d6o-1&amp;g16/11maj-3u-b*.d24<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a6 d90h72&amp;basran.u2v-3&amp;f14/11.&amp;glv8:7. d6g0h0<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a7 d0h0r0u1v-3&amp;g16/11maj-3gu-b*.d90&amp;basran.h72<br/>o-2u0d0r0&amp;g16/11maj-3u-a*.d6g0h0&amp;basran.<br/>.bas-g16/11maj1a8 d0h0r0u255v-3&amp;g16/11maj-3gd-b*.d90&amp;basran.h72<br/>o-2u0d0r0&amp;g16/11maj-3u-a*.d6g0h0&amp;basran.</p><p>Durations are d values, how long until the next note. Values of h are<br/>how long to hold a note. If h is less than d, then you have a<br/>staccatto. If more, you have legato. Envelopes are a set of e values,<br/>pointing to function tables that might include crescendo or<br/>decrescendo, sharp or smooth envelopes. Octaves are o values. Upsample<br/>values are u numbers, which artifically choose a sample higher or<br/>lower than normal to increase or decrease munchkinization. Glissandi<br/>are g values, which again point to Csound function tables which might<br/>be no slide (g0) or any of a number of carefully calculated slide<br/>amounts and shapes. Randomization within a macro is dictated by r<br/>values, r0 = don&apos;t play, r16 always, r in between is up the the<br/>preprocessor to decide. The predominant indeterminacy is choosing<br/>which macro to invoke. If a macro is called with an asterisk in the<br/>last position, any macro that satisfies the name up to the asterisk is<br/>fair game.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;idealordid&quot; &lt;jeff@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Loved<br/>&gt; all the glissandi, seemed like a logical extension of that piano<br/>piece<br/>&gt;  Rhapsody?
