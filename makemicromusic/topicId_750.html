I think we may be lucky that<br/>Bach, Beethoven, Thelonius Monk et al didn&apos;t spend<br/>most of their composing time trying to figure out<br/>CSound or building new kinds of clavichords ;) At the<br/>same time, let&apos;s be glad that certain people through<br/>history in various cultures experimented with the<br/>building of better or newer instruments, including<br/>today&apos;s best patch designers! What great resources we<br/>have now thanks to them!</p><p>2)For new instrumental sounds: As a composer of<br/>instrumental &amp; synthetic instrumental music, and<br/>through my studies of orchestration &amp; acoustics in<br/>both acoustic &amp; electronic realms, I&apos;ve found it<br/>useful to overlap or sequentially graft attack<br/>transients (the first 1/10 sec. or so of a sound) from<br/>one kind of sound with the sustain/release wave of<br/>another sound. For example, you might combine piano<br/>attack with flute sustain, or gun shot attack and<br/>trumpet sustain. This can be applied both within a<br/>patch, and to ensembles of patches. Also, experiment<br/>with moving the relation between the attack &amp; sustain<br/>portions a few milliseconds before or after each<br/>other. You can find these techniques amongst the great<br/>19th Century classical orchestrators like Ravel, and<br/>amongst excellent recent classical orchestrators like<br/>Jacob Druckman or Bernard Rands.</p><p>3)A realistic sampled chorus: I found I could<br/>effectively simulate the sound of a chorus section<br/>(basses or tenors, etc.) by singing the passage of<br/>music first with my normal vowel formations and<br/>sampling it, and then by sampling the same passage a<br/>few more times, each time with slightly different<br/>vowels.</p><p>4)In rapid instrumental passages, experiment with the<br/>degree of staccato on your notes or their patch<br/>release envelopes, or the degree of overlap into the<br/>next tone. I&apos;ve found that, especially when building<br/>complex polyphonic textures, that giving each line its<br/>own release character enhances our ability to<br/>distinguish it from other instrumental lines. I<br/>believe it&apos;s a proven fact by now that the great<br/>classical pianists&apos; &quot;singing tone&quot; is mostly the<br/>slight (a few milliseconds) overlap of one melodic<br/>tone to the next. If you don&apos;t believe me, simulate<br/>this on your sequencer with a piano patch &amp; report<br/>your honest opinion ;)<br/>---------------<br/>My so-far lone mp3 on the web (linked from<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin">www.geocities.com/harold_fortuin</a>) doesn&apos;t showcase my<br/>timbral knowledge.
