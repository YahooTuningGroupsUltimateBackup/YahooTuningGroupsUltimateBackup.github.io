She&apos;s a classical pianist, a virtuoso, but her real strength is improvising, and boy, can she do it. Of course, improv is a lost art among classically trained musicians, but as we know, all of the maestros, from Bach to Beethoven, could improvise endlessly. Gabriela must have been someone really heavy in a past life, cause her improvisations are superb. In the interview, Robert Siegal gave her a theme to improv on, and I was astonished at the depth of her playing...I was not expecting it to be so profoundly deep and moving, as well as technically complex.<br/>   Her CD, &quot;Bach and Beyond,&quot; is a set of improvs on Bach themes, and it really is beautiful; her improvs have the structure of carefully written pieces, but there&apos;s also a lot of emotional depth as well. She started at the age of 7 months, when her grandma put a toy piano in her crib; she says in the liner notes: &quot;Sometimes it feels as though I&apos;m some kind of antenna connecting into a universe of consciousness. The music just flows like water. It&apos;s slightly crazy in a way-I really don&apos;t know where it comes from, but it seems truly endless.&quot;<br/>   I recommend this CD to anybody, this woman is truly a phenomenon...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=15072 href="#15072">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2006 8:06:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dude, we gotta get your clock fixed.
