Out of<br/>&gt; curiosity, what hardware/software are you using?</p><p>The sounds are generated mostly by a Yamaha VL70m module,<br/>which is monophonic -- so each line is recorded separately.<br/>On the other hand, I created the piece by playing (and then editing)<br/>using my adaptive tuning software (written in Max).</p><p>&gt; BTW, I played your Klingon tune last night for my 14yo daughter,<br/>&gt; and she dug it.</p><p>Thanks... start her off with a bit of the old 60-tet!</p><p>Carl commented:</p><p>&gt; Yo Bill, this is incredible.  The rhythm track is<br/>&gt; still unmistakably you, but the rest seems like a<br/>&gt; new direction.  What can you tell us about how this<br/>&gt; was composed and tuned?</p><p>OK... so I started out writing a piece called &quot;Adventiles<br/>in a Distortium,&quot; which forms the basis of this.<br/>It&apos;s adaptively tuned like many of the things I&apos;ve been<br/>doing in the past few years...<br/>As I was listening to &quot;adventiles&quot; one day, I remembered<br/>something that Brian McLaren had said to me years ago...<br/>something like... &quot;all your songs move too fast...&quot;<br/>I had been playing around with time stretching algorithms<br/>(I implemented a &quot;phase vocoder&quot; in Matlab, and then started<br/>modifying it) and so I decided to try playing &quot;adventiles&quot;<br/>at different speeds... the current version &quot;Slow Adventiles&quot;<br/>is exctly 1/2 the speed of the original...<br/>Then because it was too long, I deleted a few sections.</p><p>Aaron wrote:</p><p>&gt; I really enjoyed the trippyness of this--you&apos;re right,<br/>&gt; we do get to really hear the wiggling around, and<br/>&gt; it&apos;s quite creepy! I liked it!</p><p>&quot;Creepy&quot; sounds good to me!</p><p>&gt; BTW, I&apos;m becoming more interested in using adaptive<br/>&gt; tuning algorithms. Does yours have a MIDI basis, or<br/>&gt; is it software synthesis (CSound, etc.) If it can<br/>&gt; take a given MIDI file and mess with it, is it available<br/>&gt; for Linux?</p><p>It&apos;s MIDI based, so I play on a keyboard (actually a MIDI<br/>guitar, but that&apos;s irrelevant here) and the MIDI commands<br/>go to the computer, which changes the notes adding<br/>pitch bends (and re-channelizing), and then out to the synth module.<br/>It&apos;s written in Max, which started on the Mac and has been<br/>recently ported to the PC. At the moment, there seem to be<br/>some incompatibilities keeping the adaptive porgram from functioning<br/>on the PC (I appear to have used some nonstandard commands<br/>that have yet to be translated -- I&apos;m working on it...)<br/>Unfortunately, I have not heard whether the Max people are<br/>making a linux version -- part of me wants to say it can&apos;t be<br/>too hard because OS X is more-or-less unix, but then<br/>it took them several years to port to the PC....</p><p>Kraig wrote:</p><p>&gt; It is so creepy and horrifying it makes me laugh</p><p>More creepy! Glad it makes you laugh though!</p><p>Finally, Igliashon wrote:</p><p>&gt; ... I love it.  The time-stretched drums are great, they<br/>&gt; totally add to the unnatural feel...the whole song feels stretched<br/>&gt; and &quot;extrapolated&quot; to me.  It reminds me of being stuck in<br/>&gt; traffic...all that sliding around is like trying to get in the fast<br/>&gt; lane but then having it slow down as soon as you get into it.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; very clever in that it reminds me of feeling frustrated without<br/>&gt; actually frustrating me.</p><p>So you hit it right on the nose -- not only the drums,<br/>but everything is stretched... by a factor of 2!<br/>My secret is out...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2005 6:40:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>so it is kinda like the opposite of Rileys &apos;Rainbow in a curved air&apos; ( compressed by 2 )</p><p>Bill Sethares wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you hit it right on the nose -- not only the drums,<br/>&gt; but everything is stretched... by a factor of 2!<br/>&gt; My secret is out...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Bill Sethares<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

Creepy, but powerless.</p><p>Very interesting idea.

I&apos;m not sure the sparse nature harms it, but more my ears caught that there were no sounds that hadn&apos;t been softened by being stretched (even if only an occasional vivid attack come, it would poke through the texture). In any event, I&apos;m not always sure how you are composing your works; if it were really a 2:1 stretch, it would seem somewhat easy to stretch the non-perc stuff, save that as audio, and put it back in over a percussion track that was running 1/2 speed, and mix the two.</p><p>But it&apos;s probably not that easy! Sounds like a new project down the line instead...</p><p>&gt;Fascinating story of the compositional process, and an interesting insight &gt;into Jon (&apos;me&apos;) and Jon (&apos;I&apos;).</p><p>Well, it was _one_ way to get me out of my rut. Pretty weird to get a whole dance (this wasn&apos;t always how we worked), and I could actually get out score paper and lay out the entire work with measures, meter changes, and tempo changes. And then I&apos;d sit there with an entirely blank score, wondering how the hell I was going to fill in all that empty space! :)</p><p>I&apos;m kind of excited, as another choreographer I&apos;ve worked with is doing grant procedures right now to fund a *very* interesting project, one that will complement a lot of the musical, theatrical, and literary interests I&apos;ve had for the last couple of decades. Finally, a prospect of a piece that contains complete inspiration for what I&apos;d like to do.</p><p>Oh, yes: daunting as well.</p><p>Hope I didn&apos;t overdo the creepy thing...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2005 10:02:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Uh, but the timbres are normal?
