On a basic tuning level it does illustrate that one cannot get beyond a certain dissonant level working with a particular scale of Mt. Meru. In which case it allows one to write lines that free up the melodic lines from counterpuntal restrictive rules in a sense.<br/>i agree that the result is a &quot;vertical&quot; mass, but was not conceived of such, in the individual piece. The first part is limited to a 7 tone scale that probably might be best to be thought of as a pentatonic with two tones that have alternative tones that beat with each other. I like playing with the idea of having two adjacent instruments that have scales in unison except at particular points. somewhere in-between our use of scales and the indonesians where the whole scale might having a beating pair.  the piece for two vibraphones taken as the opening music from my shadow plays is based on 9 tone cycles within the metaslendro.  Drawing upon a pelog idea in the slendro context. Being a live recording, it is some what unfortunate that one cannot hear that it is two vibraphones hocketing, each player given from 4-7 possible dyads to play at will in each section.the piece for low meru bars uses all the tones with 3 players each having 4 tones which they choose at will playing the particular patterns. I have been honored that Christopher Hobbs has been using this as an example in his instrument building classes</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;Kraig wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Historically ( not that history needs or should be the finally word)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;harmonies have been the result of scales and melodic movement, not the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;other way around.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;true true.
