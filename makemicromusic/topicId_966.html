The group was formed to facilitate the creation of new<br/>(classical and related) music, so we use the &quot;Files&quot; area to share<br/>these. We carefully avoid using, or even approaching, the 20mb limit<br/>imposed by Yahoo! Groups; this limit is entirely reasonable.</p><p>Virtually every attempt yields a server out before the entire file is<br/>downloaded, and this is entirely unrelated to mode of connection,<br/>system being used to connect, etc. -- i.e. it seems to be a *very*<br/>common problem.</p><p>Can Yahoo! Groups please inform me, the moderator, either what might<br/>be causing this, or if you have some unwritten or unstated actual<br/>size limit on file downloading?</p><p>We/I appreciate your prompt response on this matter.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jon Szanto<br/>Moderator: Creating Microtonal Music<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic</a></p></div>
