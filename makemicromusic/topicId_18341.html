There are options to play (lo-fi or hi-fi) without downloading, but getting it to work properly seems to be more effort than just signing in (not that I put much effort into trying to figure out how to get the &quot;play&quot; options to work, but ...).</p><p>The semicomma is one of the intervals tempered out in orwell temperament, and so the 5-limit temperament that tempers it out has been named &quot;orson&quot;. I&apos;ve found that extended tertian harmony (with lots of 7th and 9th chords, etc) is useful if you&apos;re trying to make a comma pump for this interval. To be honest, with a sequence of single notes like this, it&apos;s hard to tell the difference between a comma pump and aimless wandering. It needs a sense of having a tonic to return to, and that&apos;s easier to establish with a harmonic progression. You&apos;d need a better sense of pitch even than most musicians with absolute pitch to distinguish all the pitches of 53-EDO without any kind of context.</p></div><h3><a id=18348 href="#18348">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2008 6:41:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; One of the annoying things about Soundclick is that<br/>&gt; you need to sign in in order to download.<br/>&gt; There are options to play (lo-fi or hi-fi) without downloading,</p><p>Ah, I&apos;ve never hit the &quot;download&quot; button!
