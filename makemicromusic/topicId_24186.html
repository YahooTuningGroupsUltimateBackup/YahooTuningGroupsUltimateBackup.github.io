The importance of this is that now I will be able to drive other software and hardware synthesizers microtonally inside of Sonar - thus being able to capture and edit the midi recordings - and also be able to drive microtonally synthesizers that are not natively microtonal within Sonar. The example piece of music has 12 equal Fender Mustang on the left channel, Strange Diatonic GR-20 guitar voice on the right channel, and a &quot;Strange Diatonic&quot; tuned Albino pad in the &quot;stereo-wide&quot; center channel.</p></div>
