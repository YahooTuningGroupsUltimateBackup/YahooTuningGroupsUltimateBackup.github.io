When &gt; Rachel was first<br/>&gt; exposed to the gamelan, I thought she would hate it, because it &gt; does not fit<br/>&gt; into the western tuning system. (I had a friend with perfect &gt; pitch who once<br/>&gt; told me that he couldn&apos;t stand listening to Indonesian music &gt; because of that<br/>&gt; - he said it drove him crazy.) Well, Rachel loves it. Maybe it &gt; is because<br/>&gt; she was exposed to other tuning systems at such a young age &gt; that she hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt; gotten locked into &quot;our&quot; way of hearing yet. Rachel can &gt; duplicate any exact<br/>&gt; pitch, and will explain it in terms like &quot;almost&quot; or &quot;in &gt; between&quot; a named<br/>&gt; pitch. I&apos;m sure that once she learns about quarter-tones and &gt; cents, she will<br/>&gt; be able to explain pitches more precisely using those terms. &gt; Incidentally,<br/>&gt; she also enjoys duplicating the off-key singing of a certain &gt; Judy Collins<br/>&gt; tape of children&apos;s songs... now that one drives ME nuts!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jeanie Flowers<br/>&gt;</p></div>
