I like the groove and the harmonies very much. It&apos;s a really decent rendering, too, though I would love to hear it live.</p><p>On some of the fast passages the sax sounds a little less like a sax, but that made me think: I bet this would be kinda cool played in an accordion-and-piano version (or maybe even multiple accordions). Someone like Guy Klucevsek could really rock this out.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>idealordid wrote:<br/>&gt; Not to take away any of David Seidel&apos;s thunder!  &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve finished a new piece which I wrote for Brian Kauth for soprano<br/>&gt; saxophone and piano called Dans le D&iuml;&iquest;&half;lire de l&apos;Inutile.

My sax player asked for altissimo register notes.  I<br/>had to take one note down out of that whole piece!  He asked for<br/>quartertones too.  I&apos;m going to write a quartet full of quartertones<br/>in a couple of pieces for them.</p><p>My Yamaha EX5R, the microtuning sucks - just quartertones, but the<br/>expressiveness of the instrumental emulations is great.  I originally<br/>tried it with the PM sax, but the sampled sax was better.</p><p>I guess you guys saw that Johnston won the Donaschauingen prize this<br/>year.  Maybe microtuning will finally have its day!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot;<br/>&lt;prentrodgers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jeff,<br/>&gt; Great stuff as always!
