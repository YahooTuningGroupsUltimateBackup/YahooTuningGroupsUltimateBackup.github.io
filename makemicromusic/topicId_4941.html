If you, like me, have been having<br/>trouble dealing with 12-et music because it sounds too far out of<br/>tune, this might be just what you need.

True Believers may be more concerned at not being able to find the Xenharmonic Bulletins online. This is because the filenames are in lower case, but the links in upper case.  As the website is running from a Linux box, case does matter!  So if the webmaster is about (it might be Monzo, or at least Monzo will know who) get this fixed!</p><p>Anyway, number 2</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/darreg/xhb2.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/darreg/xhb2.htm</a></p><p>includes the liberal paragraph &quot;It should also be realized that the contracted semitones used by violinists et al. in playing their brilliant sharpened leading-tones may often be as small as the 18th or 19th of an octave. Xenharmonics may or may nor includes such interpreters&apos; nuances, just as you like; but Xenharmonics is intended to include just intonation and such temperaments as the 5-,7-, and 11-tone, along with the higher-numbered really-microtonal systems as far as one wishes to go.&quot;</p><p>As to Gene&apos;s site, the link to Linear Temperaments is broken, and I still see the numerical address in the address bar for some reason.  And the Oggs don&apos;t have their MIME types set correctly, but that&apos;s probably what you get for cheap hosting.  Oh, and The Wedge Product is called &quot;Intervals and Vals&quot; in the title bar.</p><p>I&apos;m listening to the Mahler now.  Quite good, but the synthesis does let it down so I don&apos;t see the point in being obsessive about sound quality.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Stan Hoffman &#x3C;stanhoffman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2003 6:02:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Okay--I downloaded an ogg player and started it up.

One can make an educated guess with a full movement of a symphony, but size listings would be a good thing.

Is this an alternative format<br/>&gt;of some type?</p><p>This is somewhat cut-and-pasted from something I wrote Joe P. offlist a couple of days ago:</p><p>&quot;Well, the ogg format (which comes from people who either use the term or call themselves &quot;vorbis&quot;) is an open-source (i.e. non-commercial) format for compressing files that really is pretty impressive. When I tried it out (compared to an mp3 file of the same music), I thought &quot;well, they&apos;re both encoded at 128k and the ogg file is only a modest amount smaller&quot;.</p><p>But it also *sounded better*.</p><p>The downside? Not nearly as many people know about it. How can it benefit you? Well, I can think of one way:</p><p>- if you know someone is using a current version of Winamp to play mp3 files, it will most likely play an ogg file as well, and you can email them the file, not only sending a smaller but *higher audio quality* (usually) file. The ogg format seems to do far less damage to higher harmonic artifacts than mp3 in it&apos;s compression. If you look around the vorbis site (listed below) you&apos;ll find a couple of files for comparison. And the encoder tool is really one of the easiest in the world: you start it up and it forms a little square/diamond window on the screen; drag a .wav file over it and voila - you have just done the encoding.</p><p>If you want to check it out, take a look at this:</p><p><a href="http://www.vorbis.com/download_win.psp">http://www.vorbis.com/download_win.psp</a></p><p>Bear in mind, as a tool or site, it is somewhat &quot;geek-oriented&quot;. That said, there is no reason for others to remain in the dark, so if you have time someday you should at least give it a try and see what *you* think about it.&quot;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2003 10:35:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Okay--I downloaded an ogg player and started it up.

And I&apos;m going to canvas<br/>both<br/>&gt; players and piano technicians.</p><p>please do so! by the way, have you ever heard of the disklavier?</p><p>&gt; Because I believe art goes beyond measurement.</p><p>maybe it&apos;s a quantum thing -- if you measure it, you destroy it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;the piano action affects how the player&apos;s motions translate into<br/>hammer<br/>&gt; &gt;velocity. hammer velocity is still the only parameter the player<br/>can vary<br/>&gt; &gt;(without using the pedals).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder how exquisite your touch is, and I mean that as a question,<br/>not an<br/>&gt; accusation.</p><p>my touch sucks right now because by piano at home has super-heavy<br/>action. not much in the way of chops either; i know harmony and play<br/>with soul.</p><p>but this really *is* a physics question. you understand that the<br/>piano&apos;s hammer is literally &quot;thrown&quot; out of its housing, and after<br/>it&apos;s released, there&apos;s nothing the player can do to affect its motion<br/>until *after* it&apos;s hit the string and bounced back? assuming, that is,<br/>that it was thrown fast enough to hit the string at all?</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2003 1:14:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

My brain tells me that there can&apos;t be anything besides velocity and timing, but my ears and years tell me that those two parameters can&apos;t account for all that I&apos;ve heard. I was talking about this last night with the woman who is the pianist for the symphony, and she ends up in about the same place that I&apos;m at: being an intelligent person, she realizes what seems to be the only answer but is somehow certain that there is more to it. And then she said it was &quot;PFM&quot;. I asked what that was, and she said that when her partner goes flying, he said he understands all the physics of flight, and knows his plane inside and out, but still is astonished that flight does indeed work, and attributes at least part of it to Pure Fucking Magic.</p><p>Well, I guess sometimes musicians are magicians, huh?</p><p>BTW, I didn&apos;t mean to impugn your pianistic abilities, and wish it hadn&apos;t come off that way. I only meant it that I hadn&apos;t realized, through either discussion or the one recording of you on keys, that you had significant time spent behind the ivories.
