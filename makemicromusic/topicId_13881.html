Mikhail Mashaqa (1800 - 1889) proposed 24-edo<br/>&gt; for Middle Eastern music, but there were -- and are -- many different<br/>&gt; 24-tone tunings used by both theorists and practising musicians.</p><p>Please let me, albeit as someone learning a bit about Arabic and other<br/>Near Eastern musics at a rather late age, clarify that 24-note models<br/>are often used to classify scales in terms a few general interval types,<br/>but that performers generally prefer nuanced and unequal steps.</p><p>For example, 24-EDO models permit distinguishing the &quot;types&quot; of a semitone<br/>(100 cents), neutral second (150 cents), tone (200 cents), and augmented<br/>second (300 cents). Conservatories in places such as Egypt often teach<br/>this method without qualification, but traditional performers may make<br/>one neutral second around 140 cents and another around 154 cents, for<br/>example, depending in part on the maqaam or mode, and in part on the<br/>expressive context at a given moment.</p><p>&gt; Theorists tended toward various Pythagorean tunings based on a<br/>&gt; succession of pure fourths or fifths, or the addition/subtraction of<br/>&gt; commas from scale tones. Musicians might use any variation of<br/>&gt; theoretical positions, as personal taste or tradition dictated.</p><p>This is indeed one tendency that can be found in medieval and later<br/>theory, and also in practice, since some instruments are tuned in<br/>pure fourths or fifths. Thus Scott Marcus suggests that the Pythagorean<br/>32:27 (around 294 cents) is a reasonable guide for a minor third.</p><p>The focus on commas can occur either in a system such as that often<br/>favored in Turkey, where modifications are indeed shown in terms of<br/>Pythagorean commas, with conceptually 9 to a whole-tone; also, in the<br/>Arab world, some theorists like the concept of 9 commas to a whole-tone<br/>as a rough guide to inflections and distinctions that the 24-EDO model<br/>cannot express.</p><p>Additionally, there is an orientation to various just ratios built on<br/>higher primes: e.g. 7:6, 12:11, 13:12, 14:13, 22:21, 27:26. Zalzal&apos;s<br/>tuning of 1/1 9/8 27/22 4/3 3/2 18/11 16/9 2/1 as reported by al-Farabi<br/>is a famous medieval example, and the Greek theorists Archytas and Ptolemy<br/>with their emphasis on superparticular steps and intervals have had an<br/>influence.</p><p>&gt; I believe there is much discussion in the Middle East these days as to<br/>&gt; the use of high-number, equal divisions for accurately representing<br/>&gt; traditional scales and modes. Even 24-edo is used by some I believe, but<br/>&gt; may not be very widespread. Again, ask someone who knows firsthand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (He has listened to non-12 EDO music and is NOT impressed.)</p><p>Again, Pythagorean tuning is one guide for certain intervals, but a lot<br/>of it is up to the taste of the performers. Thus in Maqaam Bayyati, the<br/>neutral second step above the final or resting note might typically be<br/>around 135-145 cents in modern Egyptian practice -- smaller than the 150<br/>cents of the 24-EDO model, but varying a bit. In the Persian Shur Dastgah,<br/>an average size of about 135 cents has been reported for the step above<br/>the final. If one maps this to JI measures, one might say that the Persian<br/>step is typically somewhere between 14:13 and 13:12, and the Arabic<br/>somewhere between 13:12 and 12:11 -- but the performers are not<br/>necessarily aiming either for a just ratio or any equal division of the<br/>octave.</p><p>The comma system of Turkish notation does seem compatible with either<br/>a 53-note Pythagorean circulating tuning or 53-EDO -- although some<br/>Turkish musicians also favor various more complex JI ratios as guidemarks.<br/>Thus one such musician suggested to me that the smallest semitone used<br/>in singing is around 33:32 (about 53 cents) -- defining it in terms of<br/>this superparticular ratio (the difference between 12:11 and 9:8) rather<br/>than as a given number of Pythagorean or quasi-Pythagorean commas (it<br/>would be a bit more than 2 commas in these terms, maybe about 2-1/3).</p><p>From what I&apos;ve read, I know that some Arab musicians are indeed concerned<br/>that 12-EDO or 24-EDO keyboards are imposing &quot;out-of-tune&quot; intonation on<br/>ensembles which should be free to do things more flexibly, or at least in<br/>accord with the character of each maqaam or mode. This doesn&apos;t mean<br/>opposition to fixed-pitched instruments such as the traditional _qanon_<br/>which gives a &quot;rule&quot; for the rest of the ensemble, or a microtunable<br/>keyboard which is adjusted to fit the music rather than vice versa.</p><p>The point is that intervals such as neutral seconds, thirds, sixths, and<br/>sevenths are a basic and routine part of the modal and intervallic<br/>structure of this music, something that simply can&apos;t be realized in<br/>12-EDO. Again, while 24-EDO (or 17-EDO for that matter) can provide<br/>a crude model, I&apos;d say that practical performers rely on a variety<br/>of standards including Pythagorean tuning of many regular intervals;<br/>higher just ratios; and general good taste, with flexible intonation<br/>appreciated as a high art.</p><p>By the way, Shaahin Mohajeri has recently posted some outstanding<br/>audio files of pieces in Persian modes of the dastgah system which<br/>illustrate both the routine neutral intervals, and fascinating tunings<br/>for them based on often complex just ratios. This could be seen as a<br/>further development of medieval Arabic and Persian theory.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2006 3:44:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>      Margo</p><p>  Thank you for your extensive reply on the matter.
