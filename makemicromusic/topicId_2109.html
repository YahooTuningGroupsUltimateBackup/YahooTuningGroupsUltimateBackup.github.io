At first<br/>&gt; the super dry, and not terribly gripping--dare I even say cheesy--<br/>&gt; timbres (excluding the organ) were somewhat annoying me, but, as is<br/>&gt; the case with all your pieces that I&apos;ve heard, there&apos;s a very<br/>&gt; recognizable voice at work, and that&apos;s nothing to sneeze at!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Your music often strikes me as equal parts playful and<br/>respectable,<br/>&gt; &gt; but deliberate, that&apos;s always the first thing that comes to my<br/>mind<br/>&gt; &gt; when I&apos;m trying to describe it... deliberate. It&apos;s music about<br/>&gt; working very finite materials into a piece, and it doesn&apos;t often<br/>seem<br/>&gt; to reach for too much more than that. But, if it were only<br/>&gt; workmanship I probably wouldn&apos;t be too terribly interested,<br/>&gt; fortunately there&apos;s an x-factor.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I won&apos;t try to put too fine a point on it, but it&apos;s there, and<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; you... all those little droll and sometimes almost carnivalesque<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic bits, the measured pacing... the composerly development<br/>&gt; and sudden dashes of vivacity and vigor that remind you that all<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; stunted deliberateness wasn&apos;t the extent of what&apos;s to be said...<br/>&gt; it&apos;s all stuff that could potentially describe a lot of people&apos;s<br/>&gt; music, but I recognize you and yours straightaway... so, once I<br/>&gt; reached the end I was no longer annoyed by the dry and cheesy<br/>&gt; patches, in fact, they were now just what they should be and had<br/>&gt; acquired a certain charm... in fact, they&apos;d earned it!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nice job, as always.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; take care,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Thanks, Dan!  I appreciate your candid &quot;take&quot; on what I&apos;m doing<br/>&gt; and, in fact, especially appreciate the &quot;critical&quot; analysis... which<br/>&gt; is valuable for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, composers should be able to take about *anything* they&apos;re<br/>given<br/>&gt; and make something of it, if they know what they&apos;re doing and have<br/>&gt; ability.  Surely, I&apos;m restricted by the TX81Z patches, but since<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; such a *tunable* synth it still has quite a bit of utility and<br/>&gt; my &quot;appetite&quot; for acquiring debt through gear purchasing is limited<br/>&gt; (unlike, I realize, many MIDI musicians... :) ).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over on MakeMicroMusic where, incidentally, this discussion probably<br/>&gt; should be taking place, since the &quot;big&quot; Tuning List has become more<br/>&gt; of a forum for &quot;tuning theory&quot; of late, I&apos;ve been working to<br/>&gt; add &quot;reverb&quot; to my pieces.  I was rather &quot;shy&quot; of it, since it<br/>seemed<br/>&gt; to add an element that capriciously distorted the tuning, which I<br/>&gt; wanted to emphasize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I&apos;ve been learning that perhaps just a *little* reverb,<br/>&gt; applied in the right way, may do a lot for my pieces without doing<br/>&gt; too much *damage* to the audible tuning.  I&apos;m also learning to add<br/>&gt; more *dynamic* elements, something that I &quot;messed up&quot; just by<br/>&gt; confusion as to how to properly &quot;draw&quot; dynamic curves in the<br/>&gt; sequencer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _Blect_, and all my Blackjack pieces are, I suppose, more<br/>&gt; *deliberate* than some of my earlier xenharmonic pieces, since I was<br/>&gt; working with lattices in front of me and knew what all the<br/>sonorities<br/>&gt; were and what I was trying to do with them.  In fact, it is true<br/>that<br/>&gt; many of the concepts and sounds in the piece resulted from various<br/>&gt; theoretical ideas and discussions we&apos;ve had on this Tuning List so,<br/>&gt; in a sense, it became a practical &quot;working out&quot; in sound of some of<br/>&gt; the concepts that appeared only in *text* on this forum...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, in a sense, it probably is as &quot;calculated&quot; as a &quot;serial&quot; piece<br/>&gt; might be...although I hope doesn&apos;t sound like it!  :)  Again, I<br/>think<br/>&gt; any decent composer should, and does, transcend whatever &quot;working<br/>&gt; methods&quot; provide the basic materials for the composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any case, thanks for your &quot;angle&quot; on all this...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
