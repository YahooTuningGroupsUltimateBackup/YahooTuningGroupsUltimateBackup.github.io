I like reading messages, and try sometimes to listen examples. There&apos;s just little time to contribute - tomorrow I have solo piano recital in Nagoya (Renaissance, Baroque, 20th century classics, first performance of my newest work &quot;Spiral 1&quot; for piano and koto). Recently I started to work also on demorecords of my 550 songs, so less time for making new microtonal pieces. But I have some ideas for future works.</p><p>Concerning that funny message, I have answered it and forgot it. The most important thing - after another regular CT checking my health problem from the last year seems to be away (rare stomach tumor called GIST which was removed by surgery). So maybe I had good luck and got few more years :-) You can imagine it was rather difficult year for me...</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On Mar 9, 2011, at 7:18 AM, Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, wondering if Daniel Forro is still around...haven&apos;t seen him &gt; post since the ridiculous criticism of him a while back...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=26696 href="#26696">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2011 4:36:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Glad to hear it, Daniel.  Though we&apos;ve disagreed from time to time,<br/>I very much value your input.
