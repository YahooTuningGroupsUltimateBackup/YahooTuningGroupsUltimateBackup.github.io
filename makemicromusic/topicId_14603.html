If for any reason the streaming is inconvenient, and<br/>you&apos;d really like to hear any of the other stuff (or jam with it?),<br/>I&apos;ll be happy to email the mp3&apos;s (and any other supplementary<br/>information) out.  Someday I&apos;ll consolidate all this stuff on my own<br/>site, but for now...</p><p>Most of my all-microtonal stuff is here, now:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/phoebe">http://www.soundclick.com/phoebe</a></p><p>for those who haven&apos;t already heard it all, and might like to.</p><p>For the record, the words in &quot;LIAR...&quot; were lifted from Mingus and<br/>Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka as markers for what I intended to write<br/>myself, but I haven&apos;t gotten around to it, yet.  And now I&apos;m<br/>seriously considering asking for permissions, if anyone has any<br/>advice about that.
