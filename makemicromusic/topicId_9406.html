Better success may be found by using one of the automated sniper programs; I happen to use Auction Sniper:</p><p><a href="http://www.auctionsniper.com/">http://www.auctionsniper.com/</a></p><p>It has been quite successful, both at winning auctions, as well as keeping in check one&apos;s enthusiasm to deplete a bank account when you are feverishly typing in bids in the waning seconds...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
