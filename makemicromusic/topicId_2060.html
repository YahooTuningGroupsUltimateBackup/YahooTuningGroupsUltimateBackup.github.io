I know one of the letters was L.<br/>Realistically, there isn&apos;t much chance of reproducing the same thing again.</p><p>I&apos;ve discovered FTS isn&apos;t saving that info to file any more (it is a long time since I did lots<br/>tune smithying and there was amajor change in that section)</p><p>I tried in some other formulae and got some nice results but when you&apos;ve<br/>got another version in your mind they never sound quite so good as they<br/>aren&apos;t the same so I&apos;ll have to do it fresh some time.</p><p>This upload fixes that, but I&apos;ll have to do some thorough checking that<br/>FTS saves ts files okay.</p><p>The thing is that I did a major change to the way FTS saves and opens files a<br/>few months ago - very major involving moving thousands of lines of code about<br/>- but one that will eliminate lots of possiblities for bugs in the future and<br/>also makes it very easy to add new check boxes and fields etc.</p><p>After doing that, I checked that it opened them okay by going<br/>through all the files in the tune smithy drop lists to check they sounded<br/>the same as before - that is a pretty thorough check as they use just about<br/>everything FTS can do, but that didn&apos;t pick up the possibility that it mightn&apos;t<br/>be saving some of the info in the way it used to.</p><p>What I&apos;ll have to do is to go through the list again and get FTS to automatically<br/>resave a file when it opens it, then re-open it again, and check that they still<br/>sound the same as before. If that works it should be saving everything okay,<br/>and it should highlight any other bugs of that type that there might be.</p><p>Apologies to those who are using FTS for algo-comp.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
