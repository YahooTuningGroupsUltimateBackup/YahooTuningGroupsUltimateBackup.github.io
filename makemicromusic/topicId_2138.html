        <a href="/makemicromusic">back to list</a><h1>CDR label</h1><h3><a id=2138 href="#2138">ðŸ”—</a>Catharsis &#x3C;catharsis@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2002 11:38:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If we pass around another sampler of partial works, works in progress, and<br/>noodling (albeit the most smile-producing, well-intentioned noodling), we<br/>will continue a tradition in the microtonal area of dabblers.</p><p>&gt;The important thing there was the warm sense of community... make no<br/>mistake, there was good music going on there, but by and large it was<br/>the community and the cause over musicianship and quality control.</p><p>Might I suggest creating a _CDR_ label based around &quot;<a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a>.&quot; It is very feasible today to create a home made CD duplicator for about $1k given an old computer 300mhz and above. Check out software by Feurio (<a href="http://www.feurio.de">www.feurio.de</a>) and Padus Disc Juggler. Feurio is recommended and comes with a full version demo. With a particular CD drive you can have up to 16 burners synchronized at once (I believe they state 10 drives with Plextor).</p><p>A _CDR_ label is not unprofessional if care is given to the packaging and literature. You can also buy silver/silver CDRs and have them printed on in bulk that will fool 99% of folks out there.</p><p>Another interesting perspective that I know is contrary to many people on this list is that to a certain extent _free copies_ must be made available. My general idea for my future &quot;marketing&quot; is to hand out as many free copies via online distribution, CDR or a commercial pressing (you can get 1000 quality CDs with 4:1 color, barcode, jewel case and shrink wrapped for about $1200).</p><p>The music becomes the marketing in light of costly advertisement and money is created by live performance (DJing, solo performance and eventually ensemble). Each performance can feature a unique _CDR_ release of music created just for the audience or situation thereby creating a buzz and direct promotional value for the host of the event (500 CD giveaway, etc.).</p><p>I know something like this is not feasible for everyone on this list, but we must be serious and realize that there is _very_ little demand for this area of music. At this point with this group I would certainly think that CDR labels are appropriate until demand increases. To increase demand people must hear the music presented in a professional manner equal to the rest of the music industry. I know this can be accomplished here.</p><p>CDRs possibly to be sold through <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a> should be around $7 which would cover mailing, packaging, duplication time, etc. Free giveaways should be available will all releases targeted at those who are knowledgeable and those who are not (not just friends, etc.). I would be happy to master recordings for at least a while (a year, maybe more if this actually flys off the ground)  as it will give me practice with varying material from different sources where the challenge is to get the CD to sound smooth throughout in presentation.</p><p>By going to CDR route there can be several lines (labels) for release: acoustic microtonal, all electronic microtonal, electro-acoustic microtonal, historic microtonal. Also it should be possible to span generation gaps by reaching out to genres typically associated with current youth related music. Err, it would be a good thing to try and make some movement towards all generations otherwise this area will remain closed and narrow even further.</p><p>I don&apos;t know.. I am just throwing out ideas, but with involvement I can back up (the mastering aspect, web design). I am certainly going to be attaining a 10-16 CD burner rig in the next year for my own personal use. The great thing is that with CDRs a release can be of any initial volume where funds are available, etc.</p><p>Again just some ideas...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
