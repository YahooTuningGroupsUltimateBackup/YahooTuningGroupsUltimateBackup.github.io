Must be the age that keeps<br/>increasing. &quot;Appreciable&quot; is stricter than &quot;recognizable&quot;. Here&apos;s<br/>the definition:<br/>A stricter interpretation is to let the fifths of the 12-tone Pythagorean<br/>scale not produce a fifth in the adjacent interval class which is further<br/>away<br/>from 700.0 cents than they are themselves. This gives a lower bound of<br/>6200/9<br/>= 688.89 cents and an upper bound of 5000/7 = 714.29 cents. So for the<br/>lower<br/>bound, the fifth of 8 steps is 711.11 and for the upper bound the fifth of<br/>6<br/>steps is 685.71 cents. The idea comes from Dave Keenan who chose slightly<br/>different values. If the number of recognisable fifths c.q. fourths is<br/>different according to this stricter definition, the amount with average<br/>is<br/>shown in addition, where they are called &quot;appreciable&quot; fifths c.q.<br/>fourths.</p><p>&gt;It worked well as long as the tuning I used was a &quot;good fit&quot; for 12<br/>&gt;EDO, but when I tried out something a little more &quot;out there&quot;, Scala<br/>&gt;consistently crashed</p><p>Ah, please send me the scale files that make making a midi file and<br/>show data crash, then I can remove the bugs.
