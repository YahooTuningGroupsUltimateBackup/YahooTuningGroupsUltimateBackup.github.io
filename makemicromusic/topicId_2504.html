Between anyone who played with anyone who played with Yes,<br/>Frank Zappa, or Rush even, there were a lot of odd rhythms and otherwise<br/>strange polyrhythms out there.</p><p>A lot of times, also, it&apos;s not so much a &quot;meter&quot; as several-bar segments are<br/>grouped the same way for some bizarre recurring sum.  Somewhere between a<br/>measure and a section.</p><p>Frank:</p><p>Tons of polyrhythms in any case.</p><p>I recall him saying something to the effect that his &quot;Friendly Little<br/>Finger&quot; (from Zoot Allures) was a significant use of 11/8, in which I think<br/>he actually impressed himself.</p><p>Of course &quot;Five-Five-FIVE&quot; from the Shut Up N Play Yer Guitar collection was<br/>in 5/8, I think also multiples of 5 measures in places.</p><p>There&apos;s this intro from the Joe&apos;s Garage albums boinging through my head and<br/>I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out what it is.  But it&apos;s in 17/8 (5/8 5/8<br/>7/16 7/16)  Can&apos;t get rid of it now AAAA AAAA AAAA</p><p>King Crimson:</p><p>One word.  D-I-S-C-I-P-L-I-N-E.  Discipline was an album about one thing.<br/>Playing rhythms against each other.  It was all based on that technique Rush<br/>used so much, playing an odd rhythm by way of playing a melody twice with<br/>the last note left off.  On Discipline, this happened where Adrian Belew<br/>played the repetition and Robert Fripp played the shortened version.<br/>I heard tell the bass and drums took off into 17 and 21 and such at times<br/>but I never finished studying the album, or at least that part of it.<br/>&quot;Frame by Frame,&quot; in the verse, was 2 bars of 7/8 made into 13 against 14,<br/>&quot;Indiscipline&quot; plows out a blaring 5/4 trail for Fripp to squeal along with,<br/>&quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; we never got to.  At the very least 4/4 vs 7/8 but I<br/>think there&apos;s more.<br/>&quot;Discipline&quot;, the piece, does all sorts of things.  The beginning two<br/>guitars are based on 2 bars of 5/4, an unbastardization of the Indiscipline<br/>repeat, which then are 5+5 over 5+4.<br/>Ken and I stayed up all night on his birthday in 1984 and learned all the<br/>double parts on the album.  You should hear what we recorded at about 8am.</p><p>Also &quot;Starless&quot; was in 13/4, later in 13/8.  Lots of odd stuff in the early<br/>days as well.</p><p>Rush:</p><p>Well outside of that first album, once that Neil guy showed up there were a<br/>lot of haircuts on the rhythm.<br/>&quot;Anthem&quot;, Peart&apos;s debut track, fires up the second album with a presto 7/8.<br/>In the mid-early stuff, there&apos;s 7 all over the place.<br/>The break to &quot;Circumstances&quot; is in a very tugging 11/8.<br/>The &quot;Alex (Lifeson) in Wonderland&quot; part of &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot; is in 7/4.<br/>&quot;Free Will&quot; shifted from 3/4 to 4/4 a bit, every few bars.<br/>&quot;Jacob&apos;s Ladder&quot;, the mounting end was in 13/8.<br/>&quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; I think was one of the first radio hits with a 7/4 guitar solo.<br/>Also the coda faded out with a 14-14-14-13 sequence.  See, even though it<br/>was a discrete unit, I wouldn&apos;t call it 55/8 because it was clearly visible<br/>as either 4 or 8 measures.<br/>&quot;Subdivisions&quot; of course starts off in 7/8.<br/>Lots of etc.</p><p>Yes:</p><p>The vocal percussion at the end of &quot;Roundabout&quot; has 4x 7/4 against 7x 4/4.</p><p>The middle of &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot;, well.  I&apos;ve been able to play and<br/>sing it for a long time but I never once counted it out.  The piano<br/>introduction is 10/4 by way of (3/4 + 4x 3/8 + 1/4).  The next section<br/>repeats after 40 beats; the minor 11th sort of hanging vocals that come in<br/>last for 22, then the first 9 beats of the piano intro are repeated twice.<br/>The Bb change is in 23/4 (8+8+7, or 7+9+7, depending on how you think of the<br/>jump to C).  Then the diminished climb in the piano left hand is in 7/4.<br/>Which makes the point.  It&apos;s both pleasant enough and complex enough that I<br/>never really cared to push subtotal on the amount of beats per part.</p><p>For anyone who goes running for &quot;Five Per Cent for Nothing&quot; thinking I&apos;ve<br/>forgotten it, actually, even though there&apos;s turbulent 16th note counterpoint<br/>going on, making you imagine it&apos;s in 5/32 or something, it&apos;s actually in<br/>4/4.</p><p>Also, 5% going into &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;, that also works out in a<br/>certain number of bars in 4/4, but against the previous piece makes them<br/>both seem irrationally timed.  Then during the verse, if you hear the piano<br/>in the right channel (took me years), every five piano hits, there&apos;s a very<br/>quick &quot;YOW&quot; percussion stab, doubled mid-left by the snare drum.</p><p>&quot;The Fish&quot; has several layers building over 4 bars of 7/4.</p><p>&quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; is introduced with a menacing 7/4 limbo, during which a<br/>guitar struggling to play a few notes in 4/4 emerges.  And actually after 20<br/>years of listening to it, I don&apos;t even *know* what those &quot;dut... Dut dut..<br/>Da do dee da do da do&quot; vocal stabs at the end are in.</p><p>Topgraphic Oceans, ehh, nothing jostling, but a lot of what I mentioned, odd<br/>three or four measure segments of mixed 3/4 and 4/4 and such.</p><p>&quot;Awaken&quot; has quite a long section in 11/4.</p><p>Then err, Trevor Rabin joined Yes and had all sort of fun with their<br/>Synclavier and the only way anyone could tell the record wasn&apos;t skipping was<br/>the CDs sounded the same.</p><p>Bill Bruford&apos;s stuff is plastered with odd rhythms.  The beginning of his<br/>solo stuff, the almost Sesame Streetish &quot;Hell&apos;s Bells&quot; which opens the &quot;One<br/>of a Kind&quot; album is mostly in 19/16, with a guitar solo in 7/4.</p><p>Any additions or corrections, please reply.</p><p>Marc</p></div>
