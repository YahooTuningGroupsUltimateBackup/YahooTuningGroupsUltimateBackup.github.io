The white keys are slightly more spaced apart then they usually are.  So if anything, you&apos;ll get less friction.  The only problem I have with my keyboard is that all the white keys are Ds, and they have slightly thicker shafts than the other keys.  Kalle isn&apos;t doing that, and neither does the balanced keyboard site.  He says there&apos;s a bit of screeching, so we&apos;ll have to see if it gets worse with time.</p><p>Kalle, would it be okay if I copy these pictures to my website?</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E; &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2003 1:46:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kalle, would it be okay if I copy these pictures to my website?</p><p>Please do!</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2003 3:41:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kalle Aho  wrote:</p><p>&gt; Please do!</p><p>Excellent!

My suspicion is that the weighted action is going to be tricky to alter, and if you end up with neighboring keys &apos;feeling&apos; different, it is going be more difficult to get used to than an all-spring action.</p><p>Just a guess, anyway, and it sounds like Ara has plenty of time behind spongy old synth/organ keys...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2003 1:33:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Joseph, look again.
