This is how I do it.<br/>It&apos;s extremely tedious and time-consuming, but it works for me, and<br/>I haven&apos;t had the time to invest in learning Csound (which would be<br/>a rather large investment).</p><p>I use Cakewalk myself, and its &quot;CAL&quot; (Cakewalk Application Language)<br/>gives the user a way to automate some of the tedious work that sometimes<br/>needs to be done to enhance a basic list of note-on/note-off MIDI commands.</p><p>I&apos;ve written a small CAL program which I call &quot;micro&quot;, which allows<br/>the user to step-time enter the ratios and durations of the notes<br/>in a JI composition.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/micro/micro.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/micro/micro.htm</a></p><p>The durations are entered the way musicians normally think of them,<br/>in terms of 8th-notes, quarter-notes, tuplets, etc., without having<br/>to concern oneself with the &quot;Measure.Beat.Tick&quot; protocal demanded<br/>by MIDI.</p><p>&quot;Micro&quot; is not very streamlined, and has to be run individually for<br/>each note entered, and of course there&apos;s no real-time support.  I&apos;m<br/>limited a lot by the 64k memory barrier my old version of Cakewalk<br/>imposes on its CAL programs.

There have been a lot of different<br/>abbreviations for the designation of this tuning.  I used to use<br/>&quot;12-eq&quot;, but lately have been favoring &quot;12-EDO&quot; (12 equal divisions<br/>of the octave).  Some people prefer to use a more generic variant of<br/>the latter: &quot;12-ED2&quot; (12 equal divisions of the 2:1 ratio).  The<br/>unstated word &quot;logarithmically&quot; is implicit in these &quot;equal divisions&quot;.<br/>But the most commonly and widely used abbreviation on these tuning<br/>lists is &quot;12-tET&quot; (12-tone equal-temperament).</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 3:32:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>earth7@... wrote:Alison, please tell me why I would want to<br/>&quot;cook up tunings&quot;???

Well, the programme LMSO allows you to specify a tuning,<br/>be it an equal temperament, or a sequence of ratios or cents. You can<br/>repeat the tuning at the octave or indeed at any interval you want. You<br/>then send it to your synth and play or compose. Those are the basic<br/>features, there are many more. The cooking bit is simply the way the<br/>programme is presented figuratively; you cook up your tuning in an oven<br/>by adding ingredients, ie your ratios or cents.</p><p>I use it for ear training, for trying out tetrachordal stuff that<br/>interests me and currently to model compositions for instruments that<br/>I&apos;m building. It&apos;s an excellent piece of software.</p><p>I&apos;m not one to advise people on serious tuning issues as I&apos;m only a<br/>couple of years or so into the study myself and my mathematics is a bit<br/>weak. I&apos;m a composer, performer and teacher by trade and I started off<br/>with Doty&apos;s primer. Then the excellent people on this and the main list<br/>became my teachers and led me on. The beautiful thing is that you don&apos;t<br/>know where you&apos;ll end up next with microtonality. It&apos;s a fascinating<br/>journey.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 4:39:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;earth7@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Monday, October 01, 2001 1:59 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: On Software for JI</p><p>&gt; Monz - I like your idea about cakewalk and have been tossing the idea<br/>&gt; around about purchasing the program.

I&apos;ll start with Scala and FTS (are they both<br/>&gt; needed?) but I would appreciate it if you can put me in touch with a<br/>&gt; Csound expert who is patient with beginners. I feel as I really get<br/>&gt; into this I&apos;ll want to learn Csound and programm my own ideas. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; searched the internet last night and came up with a bunch of links<br/>&gt; but they are basically geared towards the seasoned programmer. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; even having trouble finding which version to download at the FTP<br/>&gt; site. There are many different versions. Csound is going to take me<br/>&gt; along time to learn therefore I figure I&apos;ll get up and running with<br/>&gt; Scala and FTS and start learning Csound on the side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like you said, I should start with something that will get me up and<br/>&gt; going fast so I can get this stuff into my head!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mentioned that I should eventually get Cakewalk Sonar.

OR I can write<br/>&gt; using<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;a keyboard (controller I believe its called?) or NOT use a keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;(C-Sound) and utilize a programming <a href="http://language.Is">language.Is</a> this true? This<br/>&gt; gets<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;more confusing as I go along but I&apos;m learning alot.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, it is weird until you know more about the territory. Look,<br/>&gt; Csound is<br/>&gt; &gt; the least like traditional music writing/composition of all of your<br/>&gt; &gt; previously stated possible paths. What you essentially do (correct<br/>&gt; me if<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m wrong, friends) is prepare two different text files, one that<br/>&gt; defines<br/>&gt; &gt; the sound resources (the &quot;orchestra&quot;, or .orc file) and the<br/>&gt; instructions<br/>&gt; &gt; for making the sounds (the &quot;score&quot;, or .sco file).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, neither will look like any description of music you have<br/>&gt; ever seen<br/>&gt; &gt; before! The only thing that could possibly help you, in terms of a<br/>&gt; &gt; real-time feel for it, would be to use a midi-to-Csound program to<br/>&gt; take a<br/>&gt; &gt; sequencer file that you would record and convert it to a text file<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; Csound to process into a wave file to listen to.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yep, it is that convoluted. For many people, it is the perfect way<br/>&gt; to work,<br/>&gt; &gt; but not for all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would sincerely have you consider, for now, a modest<br/>&gt; keyboard/synth setup<br/>&gt; &gt; and working with Scala, FTS, and/or Calkwalk, and start getting<br/>&gt; this stuff<br/>&gt; &gt; in your ears instead of just your eyes and your head! The Cakewalk<br/>&gt; route<br/>&gt; &gt; (now Sonar) may be a very valid way to go, but maybe moreso after<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; done some listening to what this sounds like. With Scala or FTS,<br/>&gt; you can<br/>&gt; &gt; sit down with a keyboard and hear these harmonies and start to find<br/>&gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt; you like (and don&apos;t like!) in the world of JI music. Or other<br/>&gt; tunings,<br/>&gt; &gt; which you may very well be inspired to explore (Scala contains a<br/>&gt; very large<br/>&gt; &gt; collection of tunings, and Scala and FTS work well together, after<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; figure out some stuff -- and both the authors/programmers of the<br/>&gt; programs<br/>&gt; &gt; are here to answer your questions!)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hey, if it were slam-dunk easy it might not have the mystery about<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt; Someday read about the history of Harry Partch, who read something<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; ancient Greek tunings, and ended up spending his life building<br/>&gt; instruments<br/>&gt; &gt; and composing music just to get these intonations back into the<br/>&gt; world.<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;ve got it *easy* these days, we do...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; &gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
