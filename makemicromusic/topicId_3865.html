We have a good starting point of reference. Let me mention that the character set that sets your name comes out in non-readable characters - it is for this reason I haven&apos;t been able to address you by name.</p><p>Your explanation of the school that you will attend was very clear; I suppose many would refer to it as a &apos;technical&apos; school, since you don&apos;t get classes in any of the &apos;arts&apos; (or non-science). One of the problems of making at least *some* kinds of microtonal music with the piano is that you are limited by how far you can tune the strings - the instrument is built for the 12tet tuning, and the strings can only be tightened/loosened so far before you have problems. Of course, there are many historical tunings that you could try, and reproduce period music (or compose new &apos;old&apos; music), but you might also give thought to some of the tools available with just your computer for exploring microtonal music.</p><p>With that much said, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll read the note from Judith Conrad, which contained a lot of useful information for you. That one message can give you much to work with right from the start!</p><p>&gt;thank you for reading. cuz english is my senond one, you may say that i am &gt;very impolite and arrogant. but i think that the probability which you say &gt;like that, is very low. (i trust you).</p><p>Thanks for the trust - I assure you, I thought *nothing* impolite or arrogant at all! I am always amazed, as someone who only speaks one language, that others can communicate in more than one, and I hope *you* weren&apos;t insulted by my guess that English was not your native tongue. All we need to do is be patient and I&apos;m sure we can understand each other...</p><p>&gt;i want to introduce korean music to you. please listen to the two song in &gt;file section of mmm homepage performed with gayagum, the korean instrument &gt;, by hwang byung gi. you would know the second song, it is canon  by &gt;pahelvel(gayagum version)(i will upload as soon as i can)</p><p>I will look for those later. Please note that if the files are very big, sometimes Yahoo causes problems in downloading; hopefully this will not be the case here...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
