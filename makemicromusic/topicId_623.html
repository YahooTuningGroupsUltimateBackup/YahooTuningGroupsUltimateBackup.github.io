Actually on a MAc I wouldn&apos;t recommend anything else since<br/>most of the other audio cards are made for PC with Mac drivers as an<br/>afterthought. Motu is an exception there, and I know there are people<br/>very happy with their 2408&apos;s but MOtu has not been a good experience<br/>for me, while Digi has.  I will at some point probably use the<br/>competitve upgrade to try the new DSP 3 which is supposed to be nice,<br/>since I&apos;ve never adjusted to using Logic as my sequencer.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m leaning towards the simple stereo out&apos;s approach.</p><p>Should be fine for two speakers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t you mix in the computer with whatever &quot;mixer&quot; the program<br/>has, then it<br/>&gt; sails out to a set of speakers?</p><p>Yes ProTools has a virtual mixer.
