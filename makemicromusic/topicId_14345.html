Shaahin, this piece is warmly<br/>dedicated to you (on the 5th anniversary of MMM, as it happens):</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForShaahin_Shur001.ogg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForShaahin_Shur001.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForShaahin_Shur001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForShaahin_Shur001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>For the &quot;Shur17&quot; scale in which this music is realized, see a Sagittal<br/>notation example in PDF format, showing some alternative symbols for<br/>some of the notes more or less equivalent to the Persian koron<br/>(semiflat) and sori (semisharp), which often inflect by about a third<br/>of a tone. This example, produced with Hudson Lacerda&apos;s microabc and<br/>other abc programs, uses the beautiful Sagittal-2 PostScript font that<br/>he has joined with Dave Keenan in developing, still a testing version<br/>but a very impressive one, with George Secor, needless to say, also<br/>playing a very prominent role in the history of Sagittal typography:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Shur17.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Shur17.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, a link to a Scala file for the tuning (also appended at the end<br/>of this article):</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/shur17.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/shur17.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>The idea of the Shur17 subset of the Peppermint temperament is to<br/>support both traditional Persian music based mostly on a single<br/>melodic line, and congenial styles of polyphony which embrace the<br/>subtleties of the traditional intonational approach.</p><p>For example, here is a basic set of notes for Shur, with some notes<br/>having flexible or alternative forms:</p><p>                            Alt               Alt<br/>  C    C/||\   E\!!/  F     G)!!~   G   G(|)  G/||\  B\!!/   C<br/>  0     129     288  496    (624)  704  774   (833)   992  1200</p><p>Here a &quot;textbook&quot; Shur would be 0-129-288-496-704-774-992-1200, but in<br/>fact the sixth can often be fluid (minor or neutral), while the<br/>regular fifth G is often varied to G)!! (also F/||\) in descending<br/>passages, written as Gp in Persian notation (a koron or about a<br/>thirdtone lower than usual G). Later in the piece, this &quot;alternative&quot;<br/>step becomes the basis of two melodic patterns where it seems to<br/>notate it as a simple F/||\ (conventional F#):</p><p>&quot;Newroz&quot;</p><p>  F/||\  G/||\  B\!!/    C   C/||\  E\!!/  E     F/||\<br/>    0     208    367    575   704    863  992    1200</p><p>This pattern has the color of the large neutral third and sixth, and<br/>also of the small tritone or diminished fifth. I&apos;m not sure if the<br/>Persian tradition has a gusheh or melodic pattern quite like this;<br/>informally I call it &quot;Newroz&quot; after the Iranian and Kurdish New Year<br/>celebrated at the beginning of spring. It can invite a polyphonic<br/>cadence with the seventh degree raised from a minor to a neutral<br/>seventh:</p><p>     F      F/||\<br/>     C      C/||\<br/>     G/||\  F/||\</p><p>This resolution uses a small neutral second around 129 cents, very<br/>close to 14:13, a step characteristic of Persian music.</p><p>Also, in the section focused on F/||\, the music touches on a<br/>beautiful Persian dastgah known as Nava:</p><p>Nava</p><p>  F/||\    G/||\  A     B    C/||\   E\!!/  E    F/||\<br/>    0       208  288   496    704     863  992   1200</p><p>Sometimes one sees the opinion that Nava is nowadays not the most<br/>popular dastgah because it is heard as similar to the favorite Shur.<br/>However, the wide neutral sixth around 863 cents gives it to my ears a<br/>pleasantly distinctive quality, subtly contrasting with the more usual<br/>small neutral sixth of Shur (here C-G/||\ at about 833 cents, close to<br/>a reported average of 835 cents for modern Persian performers).</p><p>While it can hardly be overemphasized that Persian music is primarily<br/>melodic in its orientation, the interval sizes can also make for<br/>beautiful polyphony, as in this cadence where small and large neutral<br/>thirds (around 337/367 cents) serve nicely as imperfect concords<br/>resolving to the stable concords of the unison and fifth, with a<br/>descending small neutral second step (129 cents) in the middle voice:</p><p>      F      G<br/>      C/||\  C<br/>      B\!!/  C</p><p>Again, I would like most warmly to thank Shaahin for all of his<br/>inspiration, including his beautiful pieces, and also George Secor,<br/>Dave Keenan, and Hudson Lacerda for their vital roles in the ongoing<br/>Sagittal notation saga.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p><p>P.S.
