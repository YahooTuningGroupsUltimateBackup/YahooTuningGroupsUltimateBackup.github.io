Enjoy!</p><p>Bill !!!!!</p><p>This was *thouroughly* enjoyable, and you took my slant, and IMO, really took<br/>it further (esp. regarding orchestration and thematic cogency). Mine was<br/>about &apos;experimental&apos;, minimalistic process, and more of a &apos;throwaway&apos; piece;<br/>yours seems to have a much more &apos;traditional&apos; form, with that &apos;bass break&apos;,<br/>arrangement, etc. I could tell that you gave everything much thought, and it<br/>shows.</p><p>The orchestration, with that simple bass line, and that great portamento lead<br/>patch, was stellar !!!</p><p>I was smiling all the was through this, thinking &apos;Go Bill !!!!!!&apos; That&apos;a<br/>something that the best music does to me, makes me laugh or smile (or<br/>cry--but that&apos;s not this genre)</p><p>One suggestion I thought --- and this may as well apply to my 5-tet funk as<br/>well---the stereo imaging is strong enough, maybe a little less reverb? I<br/>think esp. for the drums. For funk, I like a tight, dry sound. And not to say<br/>that I didn&apos;t love it, but I&apos;d love to hear a slightly faster tempo, maybe...</p><p>Bravo !!!</p><p>Warmly,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

When Stretch recorded/produced our demo CD, we went<br/>through a lot of iterations of telling the engineer how to tweak<br/>things. For the funk track, we weren&apos;t happy until he took *all* the<br/>reverb off the snare drum.</p><p>Anyway, all this 5-equal funk is making *me* wet! ;) Love it, guys!!</p><p>I&apos;m about to post something about makingmicromusic, if my schedule<br/>allows . . .</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2004 10:22:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Inspired by Aaron&apos;s recent 5-tet offering,  I&apos;ve just placed<br/>&gt;a new 5-tet composition &quot;PentaFunk&quot; up at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/PentaFunk.mp3">http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/PentaFunk.mp3</a></p><p>Nice!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
