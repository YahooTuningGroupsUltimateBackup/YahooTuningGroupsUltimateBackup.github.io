She demonstrated the organ fro me, and I tried out some of the sketches I&apos;d written.  This was in the spring. I wrote most of the piece in the summer while out of town, using softsynths tuned to meantone, mostly Aaron Hunt&apos;s Microsynth with a pipe organ sound font. I made a lot of sketches, lists of available (near-) JI, 7-limit chords and intervals, etc. on paper, and chord progressions, melodic motifs etc. mostly directly to a notation program playing back on the softsynth in menatone. I&apos;m not a fan of Finale but that&apos;s what I use, and one of its features was actually very handy here: the black keys of the pipe organ are C#, Eb, F#, G#, Bb. and in Finale you can specify that these are also the notated pitches for input midi notes. Maybe you can do that in Sibelius, too,<br/>In the fall we had a couple of sessions with the organist to try out the music I&apos;d written so far and edit it a little bit, changing some awkward figures etc. We also decided on the registration.<br/>Hope this was the kind of of information you had in mind.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Juhani</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And while we are on the subject - microtonal ambient seems to, in general,<br/>&gt; do quite well with the normally 12 equal crowd as well and I recommend<br/>&gt; posting that genre there as well.

Ambient is kind of an experimental genre, anyway, whereas for microtonality to be accepted in rock I assume you have to work inside an experimental sub-genre. There&apos;s &apos;math rock&apos; that deals with complex rhythms. Do math rockers like their ratios in pitches, too?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Oct 25, 2012 at 3:18 PM, Juhani &lt;jnylenius@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s my new piece for small renaissance organ in 1/4 comma meantone (12<br/>&gt; &gt; notes).
