It&apos;s one of those soft<br/>&gt; synths that understands .tun scala files.  I&apos;m not sure if it creates<br/>&gt; sounds from scratch, or uses samples though.  So you could import a<br/>&gt; midi without any pitch bends, and then set the tuning for them.  Gene,<br/>&gt; do you actually write those scala .seq files from scratch?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I&apos;m not a synth guy because they don&apos;t seem to be making synths<br/>&gt; with me in mind.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I want something which can work from an ascii score of some kind,<br/>&gt; like Csound, or from a midi file, and which supports microtonality. If<br/>&gt; I could get a collection of Csound intruments I liked I&apos;d be in<br/>&gt; business, perhaps.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d think Csound would be a good environment for you, but might be<br/>&gt; more &quot;getting your hands dirty&quot; than you&apos;d care to deal with (or have<br/>&gt; time). Do you like Prent&apos;s use of samples in Csound? Since I know you<br/>&gt; would like to emulate acoustic instruments, it seems like his work is<br/>&gt; some of the most successful of that strategy in Csound I&apos;ve heard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;The host program has the note numbers and instruments without the<br/>&gt; tunings?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ah, the light bulb goes on! Yes, that is it exactly. For instance,<br/>&gt; let us say I want to write a single line in 15tet. I start up the<br/>&gt; sequencer (Sonar), insert an instrumental track (lets say an<br/>&gt; instrument called Rhino). When I do this there is now a track ready<br/>&gt; for me to record some midi music. I open Rhino and load a Scala .tun<br/>&gt; file for 15tet. Now, whenever I play my 61-note keyboard, Rhino is<br/>&gt; playing notes in 15tet. I can now enter music by<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; - playing in real time<br/>&gt; &gt; - step entering notes (this is non-realtime entry from the keyboard)<br/>&gt; &gt; - use a piano roll<br/>&gt; &gt; - I could even, if I had a midi file laying around, simply &apos;import&apos;<br/>&gt; the midi file<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hit the &quot;Play&quot; button and it plays the music in 15tet. It really is<br/>&gt; pretty simple. One of the beauties of this is that since it is the<br/>&gt; instrument that encompasses the tuning, and not the midi file, I could<br/>&gt; have any number of instruments tuned to differing tunings. Not<br/>&gt; everyone would do this, but for instance: someone working in a<br/>&gt; large-number ET for accuracy might actually be composing parts with<br/>&gt; small subsets. You could create tuning files for some of those<br/>&gt; subscales and load those individually.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not saying everyone should work this way, and it may very well<br/>&gt; not be the best route for you. But it really works well for me right<br/>&gt; now, and is getting better all the time. One of the things about the<br/>&gt; current MMM Day stuff is that I&apos;ve got a program that translates<br/>&gt; samples from/to many formats. What this means is that I can take, for<br/>&gt; instance, soundfonts and translate them to a format for an instrument<br/>&gt; called Wusikstation; this instrument tunes with .tun files, and so I<br/>&gt; now have access to some decent instruments (I used a Steinway<br/>&gt; soundfont in this piece) that can be microtuned. It is a lot less<br/>&gt; expensive than going the Kontakt 2 route - I still have more work to<br/>&gt; do to get the samples/patches sounding the way I want, but it may mean<br/>&gt; that I don&apos;t have to deal with Kontakt for the moment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;And what drives the host--in other words, what is the score, if any?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The midi data that is either input by me, or imported into the<br/>&gt; sequencer from an existing midi file. One of the nice things is that<br/>&gt; you can immediately view the data as a list of events, piano roll, or<br/>&gt; actual staff notation (12tet only).</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2006 10:12:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;      25.
