Your Thai 3rd won&apos;t match D or D-flat, but you can probably<br/>use either of those for &quot;inflections&quot; in the Western instruments and be OK.<br/>Pentatonic stuff works pretty well.</p><p>Let&apos;s see how this works in practice. Here is short musical example. A<br/>kind of xylphone-like sound in 7-equal coupled with a reed-like thing in<br/>12-equal. First the xylo plays its 7-tone scale, then the reed plays a<br/>7-tone diatonic scale, then they play a bit of so-called music together:</p><p><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/temp/Test-7-12.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/temp/Test-7-12.mp3</a></p><p>This is in &quot;C&quot;, but by the same principle, if your Thai instruments are<br/>tuned to a B-flat, and you play in B-flat, this is the kind of sound you&apos;ll<br/>get if you play in a sort of pentatonic way.
