It had been so<br/>long that I had no idea it even existed, and it now exists only as<br/>this nearly complete demo on cassette. I&apos;m interested in sending it to<br/>someone who would like to complete it.</p><p>The tune is about seven minutes long, give or take a minute or two,<br/>and is quite dense with all the structural parts completed. It needs a<br/>few solos and some appropriate finishing touches, but not too much as<br/>it is very thick as is.</p><p>Much of the song was loosely based on--and contains several actual<br/>mutated sections of--Kazumi Watanabe&apos;s Mobo Club recordings. There<br/>were no samples, loops or computer interfaces used, and all (Mobo)<br/>excerpts are very structured turntable collages mixed with other<br/>things: even more turntable work, cassettes, live instruments<br/>(electric and acoustic), and other things as well.</p><p>It&apos;s a complex piece with many turn on a dime section changes, etc.<br/>It&apos;s also very microtonal; mostly via intentional and pronounced pitch<br/>manipulations at the turntables.</p><p>Based on empirical experience, there are a few people I know I&apos;d trust<br/>to tackle a project like this here--folks like Jacky Ligon and<br/>Christopher Bailey come right to mind, but I&apos;d listen to anybody who&apos;s<br/>genuinely interested and thinks they can pull it off. One thing to<br/>remember is that I&apos;d be sending someone the only version that exists<br/>of something, and I&apos;d like to get the cassette back at some point for<br/>posterity sake. Thanks.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;cb202@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2002 8:55:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>Sounds like a cool thing.</p><p>I&apos;m working on my big 19-tet computer piece right now . . hopefully<br/>it will be done in, say, July.  Sadly, I have to finish that before I work<br/>on anything else.</p><p>Then I&apos;ll be gung-ho for this and/or any other kinds of collaboration.</p><p>cb</p></div>
