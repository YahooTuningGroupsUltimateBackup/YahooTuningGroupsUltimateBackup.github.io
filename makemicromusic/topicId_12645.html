I got this disk today along with an<br/>Iva Bittova--WHO EVERY SELFRESPECTING CREATIVE MUSICIAN SHOULD KNOW--<br/>collaboration with Bang on a Can too, right now i have mixed feelings<br/>on it, but that&apos;s also after having the Akrons lift my head off--well<br/>the Iva\BOC collab is pretty okay....but it&apos;s also really laidback<br/>(especially for a divna slecinka like her!) in a way i find<br/>disturbing about all the BOC recordings i&apos;ve heard .For such<br/>a &quot;supergroup&quot; with such a noble repertoire, I just don&apos;t think<br/>they&apos;re all that good....</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hellojacob.Thanks for sharing this!I just spent a few hunks of<br/>today<br/>&gt; in your soundclick pile and i really like what you&apos;re doing...the<br/>&gt; massed bassoons in particular, but all of it reaLLY.

Also, the<br/>15-minute length is not hostable at soundclick.  Go forth and do<br/>remixes, retunings... I already found a good substitute tuning,<br/>14-out-of-31-with-an-11/31-generator.  Indistinguishable in spots...</p><p>At the slower tempo more subtleties do go noticed, but by now I&apos;ve<br/>listened to the sped up version so many times that it sounds righter<br/>to me. I&apos;m considering transcribing/learning it and trying to play it<br/>live somewhere in between the two tempos.  You know, in that imaginary<br/>recital in my head where I also play Kyle Gann&apos;s Triskaidekaphonia and<br/>sing Chris Bryan&apos;s Psalm 42.</p><p>Gene, what timbres do you think it would sound bad in?
