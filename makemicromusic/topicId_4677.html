I like the idea of<br/>Seven equal, and it could be the good starting point. I&apos;ve also found out,<br/>that I need to study this thing a bit more. All this numerical data is going<br/>over my head easily and I need to do my homework better :). I&apos;m familiar<br/>with tempered and just scale (did I wrote them right?), but I really don&apos;t<br/>understand the number behind it. I haven&apos;t had any experience in microtonal<br/>music, but I&apos;m driven by the idea behind it (like it so much).<br/>The programs people have mentioned seems good to me. I haven&apos;t tried them<br/>yet, because I haven&apos;t been home with my own computer. I&apos;m doing a<br/>MMM-package for myself right now, with all the programs and texts and<br/>everything.<br/>As someone asked about what kind of music I&apos;m interested of making. Well,<br/>might not be your flavor, but breakbeats, DnB, synthetic sounds, different<br/>timesignatures all mixed up as a good IDM should be. I guess I&apos;m just<br/>influenced a lot by artists like Aphex Twin, Autechre etc.</p><p>Toni</p><p>-----Alkuper&auml;inen viesti-----<br/>L&auml;hett&auml;j&auml;: Robert Walker<br/><a href="http://Vast.ott">Vast.ott</a>: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>L&auml;het.: 23.5.2003 1:00<br/>Aihe: [MMM] How to make microtonal music?</p><p>HI Toni,</p><p>Seven equal is a rather fun tuning to try out - and few notes and<br/>few intervals and chords to - an interesting microcosm.</p><p>It turns everythign on its head in a most delightful fashion. The fifths<br/>are dissonances to be resolved. The thirds are so wide that they are<br/>moderately consonant approximating to an 11/9. Then I find in this<br/>tuning<br/>the thirds make diads which have a consonance and richness to them<br/>which let&apos;s them function more like triads in normal triadic music.<br/>Instead of progressing round a circle of fifths as in II V I etc<br/>you progress round a circle of thirds II - VI - III - I for instance<br/>(diads rather than triads there). Then you can extend the diads<br/>to make more dissonant chords until you get to 0 2 4 8 10 12 14 (scale<br/>degrees)<br/>which is your entire scale laid out as a single chord. That chord is<br/>sort<br/>of like a diminished seventh since it lets you modulate anywhere.</p><p>You can then make modes of seven equal, maybe 0 2 3 5 6 7 for<br/>a little pentatonic scale.</p><p>You can bring your tunes to a cadential close quite nicely just using<br/>the diad cadences such as III - I or VI - III - I etc.</p><p>(I&apos;m sure this is only one take on seven equal...)</p><p>My program Fractal Tune Smithy has an MFX plug in so can be used with<br/>Cubase SX or Sonar.</p><p>It&apos;s not entirely free like SCALA because I am doing this as a business<br/>- but you<br/>can use it as long as you like for free with some restrictions -<br/>you are restricted to ten minutes playing time per session<br/>(with a drop list of some free midi in presets to try that never time<br/>out).<br/>Also when you try it for free you either see a dialog or a splash screen<br/>when it starts up (can choose which you prefer).</p><p>I&apos;ve just done a version update to version 2.3 (accumulation of<br/>updates, bug fixes etc).</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.co.uk">http://www.tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My name is Toni Ahvenainen and I&apos;m new in this list. I joined because<br/>I<br/>&gt; want to create microtonal music. But I don&apos;t know how to make it.<br/>&gt; Usually I make electronic music with computer programs such as<br/>&gt; Cubase Sx and virtual soft synths. I would like to do some microtonal<br/>&gt; stuff with those programs, but I&apos;m not sure how. I&apos;ve understood from<br/>&gt; somewhere else, that I need some programs to feed midi to cubase sx<br/>&gt; (since cubase only has 12 notes in octave). So I&apos;m sure someone here<br/>&gt; knows good apps that would help me and other helpfully stuff also.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m also very interested if someone could advice what kind of scale I<br/>&gt; should use. I know there are different kinds of scales, like 24, 19,<br/>43 or<br/>&gt; something other notes in one octave. I would like to know if someone<br/>&gt; has opinions of which scale could be suitable for idm-geeck<br/>(intelligent<br/>&gt; dance music, don&apos;t ask...) like me. I must admit that I&apos;m not very<br/>good<br/>&gt; even with normal scales, so I guess 24 would be easier than 43??<br/>&gt; If people have any other advices for novice I would love to hear.</p><p>HI Toni,</p><p>[MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]</p><p>Your use of Yahoo!
