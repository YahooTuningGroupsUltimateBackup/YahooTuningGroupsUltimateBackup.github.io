I just wrote the results down while attempting to describe the interval produced in relationship with equal temperment, which has translated to playing synths and use of the pitch to get the note tempered where I want it to be.</p><p> If I may use an analogy with amplitude, the &quot;db&quot; ia known as &quot;the least significant difference&quot;. While that MAY be true when listening to two different distinct tones sounding at different times, I&apos;ve found while mixing that a 1dB resolution on a console is not sufficient, that sometimes even a 1/2 or 1/4 of a dB when mixing two sounds together IS necessary to get that &quot;perfect&apos; balance between the sounds. Does this mean that the validity of getting 1/8dB increments may be necessary resolution for amplitudes?

What does it have to do with the price of noodles in China? Probably not much. I&apos;ve been almost totally immersed in the world of recording studio acoustics for the past few months, probably looking for colloraries to my current plights. I am making considerable progress in my efforts,  however, but then that is well outside the scope of this message area.</p><p>Discussion here seems to make the &quot;least significant difference&quot; to be about two cents, the thought of ear training to the point where this might be debatable has been discussed and it is now something I am considering doing just to see where my ear can percieve these noticable differences as opposed to the &quot;accepted&quot;, since I&apos;ve found out that at least in mixing two sounds together that 1 dB is NOT the &quot;least significant differenc as I had been led to believe, with 3 dB being about the usual difference in musical volume steps.</p><p>When it comes to playing &quot;in the cracks&quot;, on synthesizer, I go to the nearest semitone and  bend up to the desired pitch, kind of the way trombonists temper the pitch to where it should be from one of the 7 positions on the slide. Having watched them carefully, I have noted minute changes from those &quot;stock&quot; slide positions based on what the note is in relationship to the root of the chord as they temper the tuning and string players, as they run scales up and down, then to go sharp on the ascending scale, and a little flat on the way down.</p><p>Does this make a little more sense to you?</p><p>Bonnie *:&gt;</p><p>Porres &lt;decuritiba@...&gt; wrote:<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Bonnie Goodwin<br/>&lt;goodwinbonnie@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Eric,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice work with the database, which could be a useful thing to have.</p><p>Cool, that&apos;s what I&apos;d like to hear, actually I&apos;d like to hear some<br/>options as to what it may be useful, Ha ha...</p><p>&gt; which has translated to playing synths and use of the pitch to get<br/>the note tempered where I want it to be. &gt;</p><p>Don&apos;t know if I got that, but one use for that databse that I thought<br/>of could be a tuning assigment, or I could link it to a software,<br/>something like that</p><p>&gt;  If I may use an analogy with amplitude, the &quot;db&quot; ia known as &quot;the<br/>least significant difference&quot;.
