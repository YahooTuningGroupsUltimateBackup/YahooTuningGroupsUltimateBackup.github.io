A bad mix<br/>will mess up a piece, no doubt, but bad mixing would mess up a 12tet<br/>piece just as profoundly!</p><p>&gt; Even with _Sound Forge_ the reverb, even when light,<br/>&gt; sounds &quot;hokey...&quot; like something extraneous to the piece.</p><p>Two items: the reverb in SF is not state-of-the-art, by any means,<br/>and applying the right kind and amount of reverb is a very learned<br/>and delicate event in itself. Mixing a piece of music is not an<br/>afterthought or secondary task, it is part and parcel of a good<br/>recording. Which is why many people, who don&apos;t have the<br/>time/talent/energy to be players/composers *and* be engineers at the<br/>same time take their material to a recording/mixing engineer. There<br/>are people who have spent as much time becoming recording engineers<br/>as you have spent becoming a composer.</p><p>&gt; I even tried to use &quot;equalization&quot; instead but, still, couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; find much to improve upon the original.</p><p>EQ has nothing to do with reverb.</p><p>&gt; Maybe it&apos;s the means that _Sound Forge_ or _Cool Edit_ uses<br/>&gt; to &quot;reverb&quot; sounds, but it all seems like something I would just as<br/>&gt; soon leave out, when I go for &quot;precision listening...&quot;</p><p>That would also mean that any live performance of your music should<br/>be done in halls lined with acoustic foam panels, or better yet,<br/>anechoic chambers! But you&apos;d never think of that, because it would<br/>sound awful!! Music needs *air* to breath (or usually it does), and a<br/>good application of reverb to a recording is simply standing in for<br/>music as heard in a suitable &apos;space&apos;. I fail to see how any music -<br/>microtonal or otherwise - would be better without it in some amount.</p><p>Just to start the discussion...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
