The working title is &quot;Blood Sacrifice at Stonehenge&quot;. I would describe<br/>it as a sort of ritualistic-sounding piece, not as violent as the title might<br/>suggest. I think it has a wonderful sort of &quot;mystic-awe&quot; sound to it, let me<br/>know if you agree. It was an edit from the 2nd half of a larger, 15 min.<br/>improv, and it works well as the &apos;spiritual arrival point&apos; of the larger<br/>work, as well as the stand alone I present to you. Let me know if you are<br/>interesting in hearing the entire improv, and I will upload it.....</p><p>Here&apos;s the link:<br/><a href="http://www.aaronandlorna.com/audio/blood_sacrifice_at_stonehenge.mp3">http://www.aaronandlorna.com/audio/blood_sacrifice_at_stonehenge.mp3</a></p><p>Of interest to tuning people is that the Korg MS-2000R synth I used (a great<br/>virtual analog, BTW) is tuned to 7-tet, (or 7-edo for you Joe Monzo<br/>terminology folks), and it allows the affect of shimmery light-vs-dark to<br/>come into play, full-force.</p><p>We recorded live to hard-disk via mics and 1/4 inch cables through a mixer,<br/>and a lexicon reverb unit was used to give a nice ambience.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson.</p><p>OCEAN, n.
