It<br/>contains pieces recorded in a vast, reverberant water tower like<br/>their debut &quot;Coalescence&quot; and follow up &quot;Sky,&quot; and also more recent<br/>group and solo recordings from the Gathering Room.</p><p>Spectral Voices use overtone singing (aka throat singing - each<br/>person singing two or more notes at once) to improvise music of<br/>subtle complexity and eerie beauty.  Through spare lyrical melodies<br/>and blossoming, shimmering chords, they create serene, heartfelt, and<br/>intense music.  Spectral Voices play the space they sing in as an<br/>instrument, melding and enhancing their sound through the acoustics<br/>and resonance.  Thus, they sculpt sound within their bodies to<br/>interact with the surrounding spaces and each other.</p><p>Jim Cole began practicing overtone singing in 1991, inspired by the<br/>distinctive vocal sounds of Tibetan monks and the Harmonic Choir.  He<br/>formed the vocal group Spectral Voices, and later found an empty<br/>water tower where they recorded their improvisations for three<br/>years.
