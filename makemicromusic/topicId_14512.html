Leaning on pianos, maybe one of the Kurzweil keyboards. But the hardware people are seeming to support microtuning less these days, and it seems nuts to buy into dated hardware (with usually dated sounds). There are a lot of options available in soft instruments, and it would seem like investing in a good computer (laptop or other) and finding an instrument you like would be a better solution, even for live playing. But we&apos;re in a real grey-area period right now, tantalizingly close to stable, workable, musical instruments that can use any tuning we can throw at them.</p><p>Anyway, I hope some other people can weigh in on this, there are as many solutions (it seems) as we have people making microtonal music!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=14519 href="#14519">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2006 3:37:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey John,</p><p>Good to see you are still around, and thanks for the updated info...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Yamaha CS6X has microtuning presets only.

It uses 6-operator FM synthesis with sine waves only, which is fine for &quot;electric piano&quot; sounds but not very realistic for acoustic pianos. There are plenty of timbres available for it (it comes with 64 built in and another 64 in a plug-in cartridge), but there are advantages and disadvantages to FM. (Technically I&apos;ve heard it isn&apos;t actually FM but a closely related technique, phase modulation.) What FM does best is synthetic brass-like sounds, plucked strings (like a harpsichord), and inharmonic sounds; woodwinds and string ensemble-like sounds can be fairly decent, but the lack of filters makes it tricky to program certain kinds of timbres. It&apos;s also fairly easy with FM to recreate the sounds of typical synth waveforms like square and sawtooth waves.</p><p>Retuning using the control panel is a bit cumbersome (since every note of the MIDI range is retunable), but these days I don&apos;t bother since Scala can create MIDI files that can retune the DX7II with system exclusive messages. The nice thing is that the tuning resolution is 1024 steps per octave -- theoretically a 1.17 cent resolution, if the steps are all equal (I don&apos;t have good enough pitch discrimination to tell if there&apos;s any unevenness in the steps, but the fifths are pretty near to just as far as I can tell). 1024-ET is especially accurate for factors of 3 (and at least it&apos;s more accurate than 768-ET).</p></div><h3><a id=14523 href="#14523">ðŸ”—</a>kevin ryan &#x3C;bentivi_cdo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2006 9:24:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>So it seems the best thing to do is get a great midi<br/>controller and use soft synths?
