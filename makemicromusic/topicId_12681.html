March 25t, 2006 Report</h1><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>3/28/2006 2:57:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi All,</p><p>It would have been truly wonderful to have all of you at Saturday&apos;s NYC concert.  The big hit of the night was far and away the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven in Kirnberger III tuning played by Joshua Pierce.  It was like a coloratura pianist.  Frankly, most in the audience would hear nothing other than radiant beauty.  But I could hear much more, and we can hear even more once audio engineer Norman Greenspan sends me a CD.   (I have never hated a noisy piano bench more!)</p><p>The Tui St. George Tucker recorder solo also went over well, with an exchange to a 415=A recorder for a multiphonic section.  The lowered half-step gives much more tone to the multiphonics.  I was able to hand one recorder to someone in exchange for the other, twice, and seemlessly.</p><p>The W.F. Bach Sonata for 2 harpsichords turned out to be the favorite for composer John Eaton, sitting in the audience.  But I need the CD for this one because the harpsichords were not in balance, with one being difficult to hear in the audience.  (Shades of clavichords!)  The recording will be like listening to the performance for the first time, relatively.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure the Brahms Clarinet Sonata no. 1 worked at an advantage in Kirnberger III.  While the Beethoven was radiant, the Brahms seemed not to get any advantage.  Again, the CD is needed for comparisons.  Live concerts do show some limitations.</p><p>The Kirnberger Sonata no. 3 was a real piece.  Wow!  It was not pedagogical as some might assume, but romantic.  Harpsichord builder Bobby Beuker said to me afterwards, &quot;Now I think I understand Romantic music.&quot;</p><p>Alas, the Telemann was painful for me as I had an infection and had trouble feeling the reed.  Yet, nobody seemed to notice anything more than I was having some kind of difficulty.  The music seemed to ride out the discomfort, thank heavens!  What a great piece the Sonata for bassoon and continuo is.  The tuning gave me a clear point of view in terms of the phrasing.  I had been playing this piece for over 30 years (although never before for a concert performance) without a clue as to what to do to it.  As stated earlier, there is no Telemann style or school today as there is with Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel.  Yet audience members heard a musical &quot;point of view&quot; that was memorable.  Previously, in 12-tet, it was pedestrian.  I am trying to get responses on the piece with the idea that there is a great surprise for them if they can play the piece in sixth comma tuning.  This match of composer to tuning is about the clearest that I know in our musical history.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>p.s.  Come by May 6th if you are in Manhattan.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2006 9:20:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 28 Mar 2006, Johnny Reinhard wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would have been truly wonderful to have all of you at Saturday&apos;s NYC<br/>concert.

The Telemann was in sixth-comma, I think you said?  Even<br/>despite your &quot;difficulty&quot;, it seems the audience had a new and<br/>memorable vision of what Telemann&apos;s music could be.  Is there<br/>any chance we&apos;ll be able to hear this on a recording any time soon?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.385 / Virus Database: 268.3.3/295 - Release Date: 28/3/06</p></div>
