(there is no circle of fifths, there<br/>is a Pythagorean chain of fifths)<br/>And even where this drifting can sometimes give a theoretical problem in<br/>some extreme 12tet music with enharmonically equivalent notes, this problem<br/>does not exist in my JI.</p><p>Also, my JI does not generate a custom scale for each composition if you<br/>think that&apos;s how it works.<br/>There a potential pitch field (an infinite chain of fifths, with another<br/>chain of infinite fifths a 5/4 relative to it) and the music indicates in a<br/>functional way which pitches it hits.<br/>For instance in Drei Equale no1, even though it is a piece entirely in the<br/>key of D minor, there are more than 12 pitches per octave used (prob about<br/>17-20 I didn&apos;t count)</p><p>-Marcel</p><p>-----Oorspronkelijk bericht----- From: m.develde@...<br/>Sent: Sunday, February 27, 2011 12:49 PM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] JI question</p><p>Hi Mark,</p><p>Well actually you&apos;re in luck :)<br/>Right now is the first time in history that you can learn about true Just<br/>Intonation.<br/>And your inexperience with JI is no disadvantage, as nobody else besides me<br/>knows how to do correct JI either ;)</p><p>I don&apos;t have a white paper or website yet, but there will be a website soon<br/>at <a href="http://www.justintonation.com">www.justintonation.com</a><br/>I&apos;ve posted some information about my JI research findings in the &quot;Marcel&quot;<br/>thread here on MMM.<br/>Further you can find information in my folder here on MMM:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/files/Marcel/</a></p><p>I&apos;d advise you to carefully listen to both the &quot;classic 5-limit JI&quot; version<br/>of Drei Equale no1 and my MJI version, and make up your mind if either one<br/>sounds in tune to you.<br/>If you chose to learn JI from me, I&apos;ll give you a few basic guidelines and<br/>you can then study the tuning of Drei Equale no1 (and several other pieces<br/>I&apos;ll upload soon).<br/>After that you can learn further by analysing and retuning a few<br/>compositions of your own choice, and after that I&apos;d teach you how to make<br/>microtonal jazz / blues and strongly microtonal polyphonic arabic music etc.<br/>It is a serious study but should take no more than a few months before<br/>you&apos;re ready to be one of the first to make completely new music in JI.</p><p>If all this sounds a bit too much like a jump in the dark right now, np.<br/>If you wait a few months there will be much more information and just about<br/>everybody will be wanting to learn it :)</p><p>Btw, about the links Juhani gave you.<br/>I&apos;d strongly advice you to not study &quot;classic JI&quot; as it&apos;s all wrong, can&apos;t<br/>even tune the simplest of common practice music and does not give any<br/>musical insight whatsoever.<br/>It&apos;ll make a very unproductive person out of you, you&apos;d spend most of your<br/>time fighting a losing battle with tuning problems and the results will<br/>sound very out of tune.<br/>Temperaments other than 12tet are another tragic story.

What I can say is that there seem to be three main JI &quot;camps&quot;.</p><p>One camp, which is by far the most popular, includes people like Kraig Grady, Erv Wilson, and Jon Catler.  These folks use fixed tunings typically involving prime limits up to 13, and their approach is a definite break from the common practice.  They are exploring new sonic territory and have no interest in solving the &quot;historical problems&quot; of JI.</p><p>Another camp, which is largely not represented here, uses adaptive JI, which is a method of emulating digitally the effect that normally occurs in ensembles of freely-intonated instruments (like choirs and string ensembles).  In adaptive JI, pitches are retuned on the fly so that all chords are Just and yet the roots retain a fixed (usually 12-note) tuning.  There are many different varieties and algorithms for this method that I know little about.</p><p>The 3rd camp, which seems to consist entirely of Marcel (much to his chagrin), is interested in trying to solve the historical problems of rendering common practice music in JI.  Marcel&apos;s idea of &quot;Just&quot; is a clear break from its historical and commonly-accepted sense, in that he considers 3-limit triads like 64:81:96 are &quot;Just&quot; in certain contexts.  I call his approach &quot;functional JI&quot; because for him, it is not always musically-appropriate to use 5-limit triads, and he is trying to find a way to give musical rules for when Pythagorean triads are appropriate and when Just triads are.  The trouble with his approach, of course, is that it will only be possible done digitally, as the tuning will change with every piece of music, and also involves triads that free-intonation instruments cannot accurately produce--Pythagorean triads are notoriously difficult to sing and there is tremendous evidence that free-intonation ensembles tend toward adaptive 5-limit (or, rarely, 7-limit) JI.  Nevertheless, I do think his approach produces good renderings that match the rise and fall of tension within the piece of music.  I just don&apos;t know what sort of practical application it can have to making music outside the digital realm.  As I am a guitar player, it is utterly useless to me.</p><p>The bottom line is that applying JI to common-practice music is going to be problematic one way or another, and wherever one problem is solved another appears.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Stephens &lt;musicoptimist@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;...goes deeper than the notation or current&nbsp;music theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;This JI off course<br/>&gt; works for all music, old and new, gives deeper insight&nbsp;into the functioning of<br/>&gt; the tonal side of music, and suggests ways to do&nbsp;new&nbsp;things.&lt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still very new here so I apologize for asking&nbsp;such a basic question... but<br/>&gt; can you explain or do you have a white paper or website that explains the math<br/>&gt; and/or mechanics behind this?&nbsp; I&apos;ve basically just recently enjoyed discovering<br/>&gt; some of the&nbsp;basic&nbsp;math of harmonics and&nbsp;have played around with it some.&nbsp; You<br/>&gt; talking about&nbsp;creating a customized JI tunings for each piece of music, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously I&apos;m a bit of a &quot;blank slate&quot; so I&apos;m very open minded to both sides.&nbsp;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m actually leaning more toward *not* thinking &quot;Just Intonation&quot; will always<br/>&gt; work for&nbsp;pieces of music which&nbsp;make key&nbsp;changes but I&apos;m not&nbsp;closed minded about<br/>&gt; that.&nbsp; I just don&apos;t understand how JI would not drift or go out of tune when the<br/>&gt; key changes.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;Mark Stephens<br/>&gt; ProgPositivity - The Best Prog and Fusion - Positively!<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.progpositivity.com">http://www.progpositivity.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>m.develde@...</h3><span>2/27/2011 11:27:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You know, one of the main things is this:<br/>People who do JI &quot;research&quot; make up all these things yet do not test them<br/>properly in practice!</p><p>The possibilities with rational intonation are virtually infinite.<br/>People make up theories based on ratios, do some limited and mostly<br/>theoretical testing and then call it &quot;just intonation&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ll forgive the older theorists such as Zarlino etc etc, since they had<br/>limited practical possibilities for thorough testing.<br/>But in these modern times with computers..

(the one that can see the individual notes and their pitches of polyphonic music)<br/>And I&apos;ve seen that the Pythagorean major and minor chords are actually played and sung a lot in music performed by for instance choir or trombone quartet.<br/>A choir or trombone quartet seems to not have any problem at all playing/singing Pythagorean chords in their right places (or by mistake as I&apos;ve also seen), but the problem for choir or trombone quartet arises when they&apos;re asked to play/sing ENTIRELY in Pythagorean tuning, which would be out of tune in a very particular way and therefore hard.</p><p>2nd thing I wanted to respond to is about the guitar and tuning it.<br/>My JI method is I think probably the easiest form of JI to tune your guitar to.<br/>I&apos;m not a guitar player myself so I&apos;m not sure what would be the most convenient way to do it.<br/>But all one really needs for common practice music is strings fretted to Pythagorean.<br/>And then half the strings should be tuned a 5/4 ratio relative to the other strings.<br/>The pitch space you need would be something like:<br/>... 16/9 - 4/3 - 1/1 - 3/2 - 9/8 - 27/16 ... etc chain<br/>+ ... 10/9 - 5/3 - 5/4 - 15/8 - 45/32 - 135/128 ... etc chain.<br/>That&apos;s it. No extra chains 5/4 - 25/16 etc like classic 5-limit JI, just 2 chains of fifths.<br/>One can modulate all one wants except at the edges of the chain of fifths (depends on your frets and number of strings how long you can make the chain of fifths), you&apos;d just have to learn this form of JI but that isn&apos;t so hard (it may look difficult at first but it&apos;s really simple, was only hard to discover) and will give so much in return for music composition (in fact, I can recommend strongly to learn it just for composition insight, even if one plays the composition in 12tet or a temperament)</p><p>-Marcel</p><p>From: cityoftheasleep<br/>Sent: Sunday, February 27, 2011 8:11 PM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: JI question</p><p>Hi Mark,</p><p>I have been observing the various arguments about JI for quite awhile as a dispassionate observer, as I prefer to work with temperaments myself. What I can say is that there seem to be three main JI &quot;camps&quot;.</p><p>One camp, which is by far the most popular, includes people like Kraig Grady, Erv Wilson, and Jon Catler. These folks use fixed tunings typically involving prime limits up to 13, and their approach is a definite break from the common practice. They are exploring new sonic territory and have no interest in solving the &quot;historical problems&quot; of JI.</p><p>Another camp, which is largely not represented here, uses adaptive JI, which is a method of emulating digitally the effect that normally occurs in ensembles of freely-intonated instruments (like choirs and string ensembles). In adaptive JI, pitches are retuned on the fly so that all chords are Just and yet the roots retain a fixed (usually 12-note) tuning. There are many different varieties and algorithms for this method that I know little about.</p><p>The 3rd camp, which seems to consist entirely of Marcel (much to his chagrin), is interested in trying to solve the historical problems of rendering common practice music in JI. Marcel&apos;s idea of &quot;Just&quot; is a clear break from its historical and commonly-accepted sense, in that he considers 3-limit triads like 64:81:96 are &quot;Just&quot; in certain contexts. I call his approach &quot;functional JI&quot; because for him, it is not always musically-appropriate to use 5-limit triads, and he is trying to find a way to give musical rules for when Pythagorean triads are appropriate and when Just triads are. The trouble with his approach, of course, is that it will only be possible done digitally, as the tuning will change with every piece of music, and also involves triads that free-intonation instruments cannot accurately produce--Pythagorean triads are notoriously difficult to sing and there is tremendous evidence that free-intonation ensembles tend toward adaptive 5-limit (or, rarely, 7-limit) JI. Nevertheless, I do think his approach produces good renderings that match the rise and fall of tension within the piece of music. I just don&apos;t know what sort of practical application it can have to making music outside the digital realm. As I am a guitar player, it is utterly useless to me.</p><p>The bottom line is that applying JI to common-practice music is going to be problematic one way or another, and wherever one problem is solved another appears.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In mailto:MakeMicroMusic%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Stephens &lt;musicoptimist@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;...goes deeper than the notation or current music theory.

It&apos;s well-known that we can get through some of the problems of JI by doing precisely this, but time and again it has been rejected as a &quot;solution&quot; because of its impracticality on fixed-pitch acoustic instruments.</p><p>Absolute nonsense what you&apos;re writing above.<br/>First of all, no JI has not been solved before.<br/>Untill now, nobody in the world could tune common practice music to JI. Period.<br/>And the rejection of those historical systems was because they gave unsatisfactory results (as they were wrong). Not because some instruments can&apos;t play them.</p><p>Temperament was, is, and will *always* be a more practical solution, and it works just fine because the brain is more than capable of &quot;getting the gist&quot; of slightly-mistuned intervals.  The brain has no more difficulty understanding and interpreting tempered music than it does Just music, so the trade-off of temperament is really not much of a loss.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;</p><p>You don&apos;t get it.<br/>To solve JI is to understand music.<br/>Right now music is not well understood.<br/>The laws of music are in JI.<br/>I&apos;ve solved JI, this will become the biggest revolution in music ever.<br/>It&apos;ll have a bigger influence than the invention of electronic instruments etc.<br/>It will allow many people to compose much much better than ever before.<br/>It&apos;ll allow computers to compose, and real time interaction with computer composition algorythms.<br/>It&apos;ll bring completely new microtonal music (that sounds in tune for the first time)<br/>It&apos;ll rewrite all the music theory books around the world.<br/>It&apos;ll make studying harmony etc a scientific study probably under systematic musicology.<br/>It&apos;ll be the music in the pop charts all over the world.<br/>Etc etc etc.</p><p>But people around here don&apos;t get the importance of JI.<br/>And on top of that there&apos;s way too much negativity here and bad characters.<br/>I&apos;m going to stop posting and replying here (this is my last such post), with the exception of posting finished songs here, retunes and my own creations.</p><p>-Marcel</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2011 2:31:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marcel&quot; &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But people around here don&apos;t get the importance of JI.<br/>&gt; And on top of that there&apos;s way too much negativity here and bad characters.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to stop posting and replying here (this is my last such post), with the exception of &gt; posting finished songs here, retunes and my own creations.</p><p>All I can say is...let the revolution begin!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2011 2:58:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please do.</p><p>On 1 Mar 2011, at 6:52 AM, Marcel wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to stop posting and replying here (this is my last such<br/>&gt; post), with the exception of posting finished songs here, retunes<br/>&gt; and my own creations.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2011 3:20:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Can it be true?

His claim to have &quot;solved&quot; JI is nonsense.  The only reason there is anything to solve is because JI is defined as &quot;beatless harmony&quot;, which means (for common practice) tuning all major and minor triads as 5-limit consonances.  This is *the* definition of JI.  Marcel&apos;s method of &quot;solving&quot; JI is nothing more than strategic use of Pythagorean triads to avoid comma pumps, and of COURSE that works but it was never considered an option because historic music theorists did not consider Pythagorean triads to be Just.  So rather than solving the various historical problems of JI, Marcel has simply denied that they are problems by re-defining JI.  It is easy to remove contradictions if you change the definitions of words to fit your desires.  With this approach, I could solve problems that have stumped the most erudite mathematicians in history.</p><p>2. His claim that JI is somehow the absolute and fundamental logic of common-practice music is based on no research whatsoever.  It&apos;s a bald and blind assertion that simply *cannot be proved or disproved*.  It amounts to what is basically a religious assertion.  If he had done some sort of neurological research, if he had developed any sort of theorem or formula that can produce an articulated set of musical rules, if he had any evidence or proof beyond his own personal preferences, he might be taken more seriously.

Have fun being all irritated etc.. I&apos;m not going to be bothered by it anymore, I&apos;m too happy with how my work is going :)</p><p>Now for my reply to your hateful post..</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Um...technical flaws in Marcel&apos;s theory...gee, where to begin?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. His claim to have &quot;solved&quot; JI is nonsense.  The only reason there is anything to solve is because JI is defined as &quot;beatless harmony&quot;, which means (for common practice) tuning all major and minor triads as 5-limit consonances.  This is *the* definition of JI.  Marcel&apos;s method of &quot;solving&quot; JI is nothing more than strategic use of Pythagorean triads to avoid comma pumps, and of COURSE that works but it was never considered an option because historic music theorists did not consider Pythagorean triads to be Just.  So rather than solving the various historical problems of JI, Marcel has simply denied that they are problems by re-defining JI.  It is easy to remove contradictions if you change the definitions of words to fit your desires.  With this approach, I could solve problems that have stumped the most erudite mathematicians in history.<br/>&gt;</p><p>First of all..<br/>Just Intonation has as its main meaning to &quot;tune just&quot;, to &quot;tune in tune&quot;.<br/>We know that the unison is in tune as 1/1, the octave as 2/1.<br/>But for common practice music, nobody knew what constitutes &quot;in tune&quot;.<br/>The systems people have thought up with the goal of finding out what is &quot;in tune&quot; have been wrongly labeled &quot;just intonation&quot; in the past.<br/>Just Intonation does not mean that one can only use 1/1 5/4 3/2 for all major triads, this is merely a historical system that was wrongly labeled &quot;just intonation&quot; because the inventor of this system thought it was the correct way to tune &quot;in tune&quot;.<br/>Until the battle is over what (if any) system should be called &quot;Just Intonation&quot;, the ear is currently the best guide.<br/>And if you choose not to study my system and see in its mathematics and logic that my system is very deserving of the name Just Intonation, then USE YOUR EARS to come to the same conclusion.<br/>But please stop putting out all this nonsense about what you define as &quot;just intonation&quot; as it&apos;s wrong.</p><p>Secondly..<br/>My system is not mere use of Pythagorean triads when they suit me or something like that.<br/>My system does have Pythagorean chords, but it has many more 5-limit chords (for common practice, after that it has many 7-limit chords).<br/>And more importantly, it has a big &quot;rule set&quot; on where which chords occur, and which chords can come after. It is like functional harmony and counterpoint rolled into one, and then some.</p><p>&gt; 2. His claim that JI is somehow the absolute and fundamental logic of common-practice music is based on no research whatsoever.  It&apos;s a bald and blind assertion that simply *cannot be proved or disproved*.  It amounts to what is basically a religious assertion.  If he had done some sort of neurological research, if he had developed any sort of theorem or formula that can produce an articulated set of musical rules, if he had any evidence or proof beyond his own personal preferences, he might be taken more seriously.  But he has done nothing but blithely assert that he is correct and given only his retuning of Drei Equale as evidence.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes it can be proved or disproved.<br/>And I&apos;ve worked almost as hard on disproving it as I&apos;ve worked on proving it. I&apos;m not a religious person. But I do have a strong trust in my logic, and my logic told me that the tonal side of music most likely has its foundation in tuning. Could not disprove it, and have now proved it to myself and will soon to the world.</p><p>I have considered all kinds of research to come to the answer including neurological research (and have read many things in that direction), but I&apos;ve also seen that most types of research are not (yet) able to provide the answers.<br/>So I&apos;ve chosen a specific path of research. On of mathematical possibilties, my ear and my logic.<br/>The only research that I could see could solve this problem currently.<br/>Btw, as you see I now have 4 pieces as evidence. And this list will grow fast.</p><p>&gt; 3. He has never produced any counter-arguments to the idea that temperament is a more fundamental explanation of the logic of common-practice music than is JI.  Ever.  This is important, because all of common practice music was written within some temperament or other and takes advantage of properties that these temperaments have, but which JI does not have.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes I have. Here&apos;s my argument.<br/>An octave is pure as 2/1, a fifth is pure as 3/2.<br/>To temper is to make unpure, basic 1+1 logic.<br/>Don&apos;t have to make it more complicated than that.<br/>Only if pure would truly be impossible and our brain expects the impossible out of purity, then purity would be lost and temperament would be the next best thing.<br/>But I could not prove purity is impossible, and now I&apos;ve proven the opposite, purity is possible and it&apos;s the foundation of music.</p><p>&gt; 4. His latest hypothesis of two infinite chains of 3/2&apos;s separated by 5/4 (which is the same as saying they are separated by 81/80)--although really he needs a dimension of 2/1&apos;s in there, too, since two infinite chains of 3/2&apos;s will never produce a 2/1--is nothing new at all, and has been proposed and dismissed plenty of times throughout music history because it *does not work with fixed-pitch instruments* on account of gross impracticality, as I recently mentioned.  I suspect telling him this is what really set him off on that explosive ego-tantrum where he really did reveal some classic signs of mental illness.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You keep repeating that the problem is only a practical one for fixed pitch instruments??<br/>Trust me, that was never the problem.<br/>The problem was that nobody in the world ever knew how to tune music &quot;just&quot;. And the ones that thought they did know were all wrong and their theories produced results that sound very out of tune to everyones ears (and on top of that didn&apos;t provide the right theoretical insight / foundation for how harmony etc appears to function).</p><p>&gt; Which brings me to my final point: I don&apos;t think Marcel is simply an internet crank.  I think he may actually suffer from a mental illness.  I am not saying this to be mean, I am actually concerned for the man.  He revealed a lot in that last post that makes me think he is genuinely delusional beyond the level of the average crank.  This, of course, is not an objection to his ideas (that would be an ad hominem fallacy), but really--I worry about his delusions and his obsessiveness and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good idea to provoke or to encourage the man.

This method has brought me great success and wealth in the past several times.<br/>Though Just Intonation is by far the hardest thing I&apos;ve set my focus on, it&apos;s also the most rewarding one in the long run. And I&apos;m not after wealth this time, but I am after success and it has just begun :)</p><p>-Marcel</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2011 4:56:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>ROFWL!</p><p>Oz.</p><p>--</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; On Mon, Feb 28, 2011 at 3:52 PM, Marcel&lt;<a href="mailto:m.develde@gmail.com">m.develde@gmail.com</a>&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve solved JI, this will become the biggest revolution in music ever.<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;ll have a bigger influence than the invention of electronic instruments<br/>&gt;&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;&gt; It will allow many people to compose much much better than ever before.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And wait, let me guess, there will be entire cities which will be built that<br/>&gt; will house schools and institutes that will study, in detail, your<br/>&gt; biography, and how you came across such a miraculous system?

You have solved JI and have a<br/>&gt; wonderful system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to know your plans for overcoming the 12 equal hegemony -<br/>&gt; a hegemony that is even corrupting the microtonal music of other<br/>&gt; cultures around the world.<br/>&gt; Because, until you have done that, there will be NO revolution no<br/>&gt; matter how good your system is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris</p><p>Here is my plan, step by step:</p><p>1) Render my Lassus and 3 Drei Equale retunings to mp3 with sawtooth wave and post them here (likely to not have any impact)</p><p>2) Compose several examples of 7-limit strongly microtonal sounding polyphonic music, and render them with nice sounds from my synth.<br/>This will make this list go crazy, as you&apos;ll never have heard such amazing microtonal music ;)<br/>It&apos;ll be what you&apos;ve all been after for all these years.</p><p>3) Make the <a href="http://justintonation.com">justintonation.com</a> community website.<br/>While making it do more retunings, Melodyne DNA analysis of trombone quartet, more original compositions in the 7-limit, writing my theory and explain it on the website with many audio examples etc.<br/>I&apos;ll bounce off ideas here on how to best explain the theory, and you&apos;ll all be more than happy to help and learn after hearing my 7-limit compositions.</p><p>4) Once the website is live and has enough audio examples, I will promote the website to microtonalists, music theorists, music information programmers, and the general music making communities.<br/>They will all be able to learn on how to use JI for their own compositions. Many music makers will be interested in the 7-limit new music it brings, and music theorists will go into the 5-limit version for common practice classical theory and 7-limit for some jazz and blues. They&apos;ll all be able to communicate on all aspects of the theory, and develop it further on the website together.<br/>In a while it&apos;ll produce a stream of just intonation music (much of it strongly microtonal) to the general public, books will be written on JI (and eventually music school theory books rewritten / modified), and programs released which use algorithms based on JI to help with composition etc.</p><p>Meanwhile I&apos;ll also try to make professional electronic music myself with strong polyphonic microtonality, and promote JI as much as I can this way myself. Though I&apos;m unsure how successful I will be in making electronic music as I don&apos;t know yet how good I&apos;ll be at it :)</p><p>Above is how the 12 equal hegemony will be overcome.<br/>The thing is that for common practice music 12tet works fine enough in actually performing this music. The main advantage here is in the better theoretical insight of JI for composing.<br/>But my theory will make possible for the first time in history completely new polyphonic music /colors. This will excite a lot more people, and they&apos;ll have no choice but to leave 12tet, both to perform it and to compose in it.</p><p>If you belief (as most or all of you will do right now) that I did not find true JI (or belief such a thing doesn&apos;t even exist), then I will of course fail in my above goals. Simply because my 7-limit strong microtonal polyphonic music and other audio examples etc will not convince enough. So no problem.<br/>If however I&apos;m right with my theory, and produce strong enough examples of it as evidence. Then above will work.<br/>I say that within a few weeks, people on this list will to their own great amazement will start to see that it will work :)<br/>It&apos;ll be fun, I will get to say such a huge &quot;I told you so!&quot; hahaha</p><p>-Marcel</p></div><h3>Marcel &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2011 2:36:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Michael,</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ll say this much I COMPLETELY REFUSE TO LISTEN TO ANY MORE &quot;DREI EQUILI&quot; EXAMPLES!&nbsp; Marcel&apos;s admittedly bizarre honest passion for retuning Beethoven-era Common Practice music should at least be tested on other songs from that era...if not completely new pieces of music.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&apos;s not that he&apos;s trolling (he isn&apos;t)...but rather that he&apos;s doing the same thing again and again with vaguely any new effort put in.<br/>&gt;</p><p>First of all.<br/>Drei Equale is 3 individual pieces.<br/>I&apos;ve been using Drei Equale no1 as my main test piece.</p><p>No2 (posted less than 10 different versions over the past 2 years) is a different piece altogether.<br/>No 3 (posted I think only once before) is yet another piece.</p><p>So I&apos;ve so far provided proof on 3 different pieces.

Pizzaro posts like, once a month.  Tops.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen more than three or four consecutive posts by him.  He&apos;s occasionally posted some quarter-tone scales too.  And he never posts with the egomania of Marcel--Pizzaro has NEVER said that his scale &quot;solves all the problems of how to tune common-practice music&quot;.  He&apos;s just tossing out little ideas every once in a while, which while often irrelevant are harmless and easily ignored.

And so will taunting him or pointing out his failures.  I should have known better than to address the problems in his theory, thinking him gone...of course he would come crawling back in to take up the flame once more.

May have to be till I get the website done. Or perhaps 7-limit musical examples will sound convincing enough.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; BUT if you can give me a usable (not just theoretical) system with<br/>&gt; completely new polyphonic music /colors I will be forever grateful for<br/>&gt; that is why I am on this list.</p><p>I will do so!<br/>But one will still have to learn some of the theoretical things behind it to really make proper use of it.<br/>Even for 12tet many people need some level of music theory.<br/>And for 12tet there are already so many examples of music to serve as a reference.<br/>For higher limit music (say a 24 tone unequal temperament even that functions as a 7-limit temperament), not only does one need more theoretical knowledge because many more chords will sound bad. But also there aren&apos;t really musical examples to serve as a reference (except for monophonic arabic music)</p><p>Still, if you wish to experiment, here is a tempered scale for 7-limit music:<br/>Simply take 12tet, and put another 12tet scale 7/4 relative to the first to make a 24 tone unequal temperament.<br/>But I&apos;ll warn you, there are many pitfalls in this scale without the proper theory.

Nothing wrong with scepticism.</p><p>Btw, the untwelve comments I made mainly because I saw that nobody sees the importance of JI for microtonal music.<br/>And that experimenting away semi randomly with microtonal scales does note bring good music.
