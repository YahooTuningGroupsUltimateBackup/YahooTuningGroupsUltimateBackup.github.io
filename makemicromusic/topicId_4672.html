Black keys will<br/>play accidentals where available.</p><p>To check to see if your synth is pitch bending the notes correctly use<br/>Bs | Test Pitch Bend Range - if you hear two notes identically tuned<br/>then the pitch bend range is set as desired.</p><p>- if you can pitch bend notes in your synth, then it should be fine.</p><p>Trouble shooting:</p><p>FTS sets the pitch bend range to +- two semitones in all the channels when it opens<br/>Midi Out. HOwever, perhaps your synth doesn&apos;t respond to this, if so,<br/>set it at the synth yourself - needs to be +- 2 semitones.<br/>Also of course, make sure you have it set to play in twelve equal.</p><p>(Incidentally, you can also change the pitch bend range to use in FTS<br/>from In | Options | Kbd Options | Pitch Bend Range in semitones - useful at times<br/>- you don&apos;t have to keep with the usual +- 2 semitones, but can have octave<br/>swoops, or the other way, double the sensitivity with a range of +- 1 semitone)</p><p>Limitations - maximum of 16 simultaneous pitch bends (15 for GM synths)<br/>- but that is fine as Arabic 17 tone scale will never need all 17 notes<br/>in play at once :-).</p><p>May limit possibilities significantly if you want to play several instruments<br/>at once and vary the effects from one to the other, as that may mean that<br/>they can&apos;t share the same channels, which reduces the number of channels<br/>available for each for pitch bending. This would be the main reason I think<br/>for preferring tuning tables for an octave scale or mode with less than<br/>16 (15) notes in it.</p><p>This uses the pitch bend method - inserts an &quot;instant&quot; pitch bend before<br/>the notes to be retuned - or perhaps immediately on opening Midi out<br/>(as FTS does if possible).</p><p>The modes are from the Scala modes lists, which ignore any distinctions between<br/>ascending and descending modes. However, it is easy to make ones that ascend<br/>one way and descend another way - explained in the help or ask me<br/>how to do it. If any expert on Arabic modes is interested to compile<br/>a list then I&apos;m delighted to include it with FTS.</p><p>I think your are out of luck right now if you want a notation software program that is<br/>all set up to play in any just intonation scale - well I haven&apos;t heard of one.<br/>Some have multiples of 12-et type accidentals, such as quarter or sixth tones I believe.<br/>But maybe that is on its way - there is some hope because of the increasing<br/>interest in this field these days :-).</p><p>Meanwhile, fTS can help by letting you use your notation software retuned in<br/>FTS to make scordatura type scores - some examples are included with FTS to show<br/>the idea.</p><p>These are keyboard player scores - they show the player which keys<br/>on the keyboard to play rather than the notes one should expect to hear. So,<br/>if you have the keyboard tuned appropriately for the score,<br/>you can just play it as you would any keyboard score, and the notes<br/>will sound with the pitches intended by the composer.<br/>The composer can write an instruction on the score to<br/>tell the player how the keyboard should be tuned.</p><p>With this method, _any_ tuning is possible. &quot;octaves&quot; on the score need not correspond<br/>to octaves in the pitches played, as you can tune any of the notes anywhere you like,<br/>needn&apos;t even be ascending pitches. So it is extremely flexible in terms of what scales are possible.</p><p>This method should also be suitable for players of suitably tuned harps, dulcimers, marimba etc,<br/>as they can use their already learnt hand / eye coordination to play the notes<br/>but maybe not so very suitable for voice, woodwind, strings etc depending on the tuning.</p><p>I think any versatile microtonal notation software will surly _have_ to include a<br/>feature to make scordatura scores like this - and to make it inter-convertible<br/>with other systems so that with a click of a button it gets changed to<br/>one of the microtonal sccidental type scores with all the accidentals in place<br/>- so the composer can run off one version for a keyboardist and another version<br/>for a vocalist or string / wind player etc.</p><p>No technical reason why not, just a matter of time. I&apos;m going to start on<br/>such a project presently, but never expect to finish it to satisfaction - just to make<br/>a very basic rudimentaty such program to try to help get the concept under way.</p><p>FTS is now at version 2.3</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.co.uk">http://www.tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>There is friendly support here if you have any questions at all about practical aspects<br/>of how to use FTS. Just ask - try to be concrete and detailed about what you want<br/>to do and that will make it easier to give an answer best suited to your situation.<br/>If I don&apos;t seem to have understood, ask again!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
