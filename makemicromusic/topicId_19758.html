Also, there&apos;s a 30 day test drive which lets you try all the features for free exactly as it would be unlocked.</p><p>For anyone who might be interested to buy it, the retuning midi player requires only the midi save license level, which is currently only $7, rather than the full $50 of the complete program. I forgot to mention that on the newly redesigned web site, so I have updated it accordingly.<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/retuning_midi_player.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/retuning_midi_player.htm</a></p><p>If you have any questions about it be sure to ask, I&apos;m delighted to help anyone who wants to write microtonal software, whether free, shareware or commercial. I&apos;ve also been helped a lot by other programmers and suggestions from users of my programs, and other members of these forums too for that matter.</p><p>Good luck with the project!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert Walker<br/>(author of FTS).<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a></p><p>&gt; It&apos;s certainly interesting, but I was really looking for free stuff. I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t justify spending money on something I could just as easily write<br/>&gt; myself. It might take a little longer, but it will be better in the<br/>&gt; long run.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The good news is there were plenty of example retuned midi files on<br/>&gt; that website, and I tested them and they do play in WMP. So now all I<br/>&gt; have to do is pull those MIDI files apart and see how the retuing was<br/>&gt; done. Hopefully, I&apos;ll end up with a tool that everyone can use for free.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Jill Arroway &#x3C;saffron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2008 12:52:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Jill,</p><p>Well hi!
