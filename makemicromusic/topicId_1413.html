If the topic is related to music, I say it&apos;s fair game. Death penalty<br/>wrangling and political monologues have appeared now and again, and I think<br/>they have taken care of themselves.</p><p>You see, I feel that Tuning issues are only about 1% of a works import. So<br/>many other decisions must follow, and these often require new thinking and<br/>strategies. Most people drawn to tuning, bring with them viewpoints and<br/>ideas just as unique as any tuning schtick. I want to know about Bob Moses<br/>diatribes, about Anaphorian ritual, and highly personal and/or obscure<br/>organizing principals that I have seen grace these pages. It&apos;s all about<br/>making microtonal music, and that entails procedures above and beyond<br/>tuning.</p><p>Happy Holidays,</p><p>George Zelenz</p></div>
