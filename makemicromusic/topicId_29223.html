I thought you might be interested in a new keyboard instrument I&apos;ve developed, which I launched last week on Kickstarter. The project is called TouchKeys, and it adds XY touch sensing to the surface of every key, so the pitch and timbre of the notes can be controlled just by moving the fingers around on the key surfaces. Here&apos;s the link:</p><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/instrumentslab/touchkeys-multi-touch-musical-keyboard">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/instrumentslab/touchkeys-multi-touch-musical-keyboard</a></p><p>And here&apos;s a video showing how vibrato and pitch bends can be done independently on each note:</p><p><a href="http://youtu.be/6fhmIqKHGs8">http://youtu.be/6fhmIqKHGs8</a></p><p>Given the interest in controllers and keyboard layouts here, I thought you all might like this, and microtonal music is one of the applications I had in mind. To start with, bending the pitch of each note separately lets you achieve some pretty interesting pitch combinations; another option is that you can sound a different note depending on where you strike the key, so for instance quarter tones or a 43-tone Partch scale can be mapped onto just 12 keys.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign aims to gather support for a manufacturing run of the TouchKeys sensors (which go on any keyboard). It&apos;s a personal/university project, not a commercial one, and there&apos;s no profit involved here: my goal is to make interesting new music!</p><p>Please drop me a line if you have any comments, questions or ideas.

The idea behind TouchKeys is amazing and the versatality of its usage as demonstrated in your tutorial videos are terrific. I can think of quite a few ways to employ your invention for the proper keyboard execution Turkish/Arabic/Persian/Azeri Maqam music. As you may already know, our maqams/mugams/dastgahs employ a variety of subtle microtones or pitch inflexions that are very characteristic in the intonation of such scale structures as Ushshaq, Huseyni, Huzzam, Suzinaq, Karjighar, Saba, Bestenigar, etc... TouchKeys can verily help realize the correct intonation for maqams requiring delicate pitch nuances without much hassle.</p><p>As a side note, I had spearheaded the Microtonalist Entrepreneurs International Meeting (MELM) 2011 in Istanbul and Ankara that was organized jointly by Isik and Baskent Universities. Your invention should be a cornerstone in a sequel, if any, to this conference. Alas, due to extreme political unrest in Turkey at the moment (Gezi Park crackdowns, Ergenekon and Sledgehammer trials, etc...), we can&apos;t do much here in that direction. Maybe the event can be re-staged in the foreseeable future abroad. I&apos;ve never been to England and would very much entertain a visit there in the context of such a venue.</p><p>Congratulations on your project and good luck with Kickstarter!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Assoc.
