NI has actually sold a lot of product, and a lot of people in the pop music world aren&apos;t as demanding about certain things as we are. Besides, downloading and trying a demo can frequently answer a lot of questions.</p><p>That said, NI gets slammed a lot for bad customer support, and aside from the above caveats, I agree that there could be more straight-forward info on some of their products. What I find more frustrating is a company that has a completely schizophrenic approach to an issue like tuning: they have instruments that go all the way from importing .tun files to instruments that are locked in 12tet, with variations in between. Wildly inconsistent.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
