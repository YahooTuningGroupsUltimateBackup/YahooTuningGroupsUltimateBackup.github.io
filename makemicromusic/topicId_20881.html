It is shareware where the free version has some limitations, but AFAIK the limitations concern merely the audio part (the audio mixdown especially), the midi functionality is quite good in the free version.</p><p>Another free one I once tried out an that not looks bad is Frieve Music Studio:</p><p><a href="http://www.frieve.com">http://www.frieve.com</a><br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3>aum &#x3C;aum@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2009 4:06:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have used Rosegarden sometimes, for simple tasks only and it was fine.<br/>Milan<br/>&gt; So i&apos;m wondering, there being quite a few people making MIDI files on<br/>&gt; here, what programs do you use nowadays?
