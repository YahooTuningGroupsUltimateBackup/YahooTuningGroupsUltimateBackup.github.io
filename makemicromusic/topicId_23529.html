I do not understand the logic of the sequence written on the side of my scale (4 4 2 4 1 3 4 2). Can you explain its meaning?<br/>I thought of two different criteria: a) intervals, or b) notation.</p><p>a) If the sequence numbers refers at the interval (i.e. the quarter-tone between one note and the next), then, in my opinion, this is the correct sequence: 1 4 4 2 4 4 4 1.</p><p>My scale, in fact, from the tonic (0), goes like this:<br/>1 (first high) octave high;<br/>2 minor second, 3 neutral second, 4 major second, 5 second maximum (super major);<br/>6 minor third, 7 neutral third, 8 major third, 9 maximum third (low fourth);<br/>10 (right) fourth, 11 high fourth;<br/>12 diminished fifth, 13 low fifth, 14 (right) fifth, 15 high fifth;<br/>16 (exceeding fifth) minor sixth, 17 neutral sixth, 18 major sixth, 19 maximum sixth;<br/>20 minor seventh, 21 neutral seventh, 22 major seventh, 23 maximum seventh (low octave);<br/>24 (right) octave.<br/>So, to sum up: 1 4 4 2 4 4 4 1.</p><p>b) If it refers to notation, then my scale would be represented by this sequence of numbers:<br/>3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.<br/>Every note, in fact, is named after three sounds. Here it is:<br/>C, C^, Dv, D, D^, Ev, E, E^, Fv, F, F^, Gv, G, G^, Hv, H, H^, Av, A, A^, Bv, B, B^, Cv, (C)</p><p>Thanks. Sincerely.<br/>Giancarlo Dalmonte</p></div>
