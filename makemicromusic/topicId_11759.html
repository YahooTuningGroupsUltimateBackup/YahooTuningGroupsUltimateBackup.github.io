There&apos;s not a lot of detail, but Isacoff says Newton<br/>investigated<br/>&gt; tunings, and seemed to be opposed to temperaments as being against<br/>Natural<br/>&gt; laws. Isacoff says Newton wrote &quot;perhaps the whole frame of nature<br/>may be<br/>&gt; nothing but various contextures of some certain ethereal spirits,&quot;<br/>and<br/>&gt; Isacoff goes on to say that Newton &quot;created a standard unit of<br/>measure for<br/>&gt; determining the sizes of musical intervals, and calculated the<br/>precise<br/>&gt; values of pitches found in various scales. And he proposed tuning<br/>schemes of<br/>&gt; his own.&quot;<br/>&gt;    He also says that Newton &quot;adopted the pseudonym Jeova Sanctus<br/>&gt; Unus-linking his own name with the declaration that Jehovah is the<br/>one holy<br/>&gt; God.&quot; (And, Newton was also interested in alchemy). So here&apos;s one<br/>of the<br/>&gt; great scientists of all time, who also was a super serious<br/>Christian, and<br/>&gt; also very interested in what many might call a mystical pursuit. He<br/>&gt; obviously saw no contradiction between these various ways of<br/>viewing life,<br/>&gt; which I think is super cool. Does anybody have any info on his<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; pursuits, what sorts of scales he may have proposed, and if any<br/>music ever<br/>&gt; came from them?
