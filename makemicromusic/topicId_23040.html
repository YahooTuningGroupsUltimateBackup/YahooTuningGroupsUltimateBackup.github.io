It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s been in the back of my mind for a long time to revise it, and I have finally done so. Here is a substantially rewritten version, one that has better sound quality and more sonic possibilities. Hopefully it is also easier to use.</p><p>New features:<br/>* completely new GUI using QuteCsound<br/>* Better sound quality<br/>* Risset and Reverb effects now have realtime controls<br/>* New Binaural Beating effect with realtime controls<br/>* New waveform: David First&apos;s Asymptotic Sawtooth Wave</p><p>Requires Csound 5.12 and QuteCsound 0.6.0 (included with Csound).</p><p>For the full write-up and download links, go to <a href="http://mysterybear.net/article/51/drone-instrumentsruti-box-new-version">http://mysterybear.net/article/51/drone-instrumentsruti-box-new-version</a></p><p>I hope you find it useful and fun.
