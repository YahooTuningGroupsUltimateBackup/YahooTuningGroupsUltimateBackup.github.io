They&apos;re around $100  You<br/>plug your VCR into it, and it into your computer via USB 2.0.  Then<br/>you wind up with an mpeg2 file, which you can burn to a DVD, and<br/>if you do everything right it&apos;ll play in any DVD player.</p><p>But much cheaper (well, depending on the amount of material you<br/>have to transfer) and easier would be to send your tapes to a<br/>media conversion place.  In Berkeley there&apos;s a place that&apos;ll do<br/>it for $18 a tape.  It&apos;s what I&apos;m going to with all my VHS.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
