Then you would tune the<br/>tuning tables with a SYSEX dump. Scala might do this for you. Google<br/>&apos;scala&apos; and &apos;tuning&apos; simultaneously for more info.</p><p>if not, does it have 16 channel MIDI? then you would use pitch bend<br/>with or without channel swapping to do your music. this could be<br/>real-time with MIDI relaying or altering a MIDI file. Again, Scala can<br/>do both.</p><p>There are other pieces of software out there, like &apos;Lil Miss Scale<br/>Oven&apos;, etc. and &apos;Fractal Tune Smithy&apos;, but I can&apos;t vouch for them, I<br/>am on a Linux platform.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=14248 href="#14248">ðŸ”—</a>John Gilbert &#x3C;johngilbert3x@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2006 8:17:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Aaron,</p><p>  Thanks for writing back.  I think it does have the tuning tables. So that is good that you can tune it with a sysex dump.   Do you know anything about the harmonic series and tuning to perfect intervals like a real major 3rd?  My question is if it is possible to do this with MIDI or not? With Sysex and/or with pitch bend?</p><p>  PEACE</p><p> &#x9;&#x9;<br/>---------------------------------<br/>Yahoo!

Tuning dumps<br/>are a better standard if the hardware or software for the sound generator<br/>support them.</p><p>The best thing I can tell you is that you should calculate (you probably want<br/>to do this with a computer script, or software for tuning, like SCALA) the<br/>tuning table values of the harmonics you want. Usually, one works with cents<br/>in measuring pitch, but here it&apos;s easiest to find the semitone offset values<br/>in decimal, then convert to the hexidecimal offset value by multiplication.</p><p>After the SYSEX dump header, the bulk of the message is the table itself, with<br/>all the MIDI note numbers and tuning offsets. Each note in the table has 3<br/>hexidecimal bytes: xx yy zz  -- the &apos;xx&apos; is the MIDI note number, and the<br/>remaining two bytes distribute the 12-equal semitone offset in 14-bit<br/>precision, giving 16,384 possible values. Half of these are for flat values,<br/>half for sharp. There are 14 instead of 16 bits because non-control MIDI<br/>bytes must have a leading &apos;0&apos;, so that takes 2 bits out of the running.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s say I want a pure 5/4 &apos;E&apos; above middle &apos;C&apos;. Since &apos;E&apos; is<br/>MIDI note number 64, and the pure 5/4 &apos;E&apos; is<br/>(log(5/4)/log(2))*12 = 3.863137.... semitones, which is to say<br/>-0.136862861... (flat, since negative) of a semitone away from 12-equal, we<br/>take this and multiply by 2^14, or 16,384, for 14-bit resolution, and then<br/>add 8192, since 8192 is the center number (i.e. neither sharp of or flat of<br/>12-equal). We then have, expressed as decimal, the value<br/>5949.63887961.... which we must round to 5950. Now I must express this as a<br/>two byte number, packed so that I have leading zeros, remember, so I can&apos;t<br/>simply translate that, I need to do some &apos;bit twiddling&apos;. So I divide this<br/>number 5950 by the first significant 7-bits, or 128, to get the &apos;yy&apos; byte,<br/>and then I multiply the remainder of that by 128 to get the the &apos;zz&apos; byte. I<br/>will end up with:</p><p>   note &apos;64&apos;, &apos;bend&apos; 5950 is<br/>         xx  yy  zz<br/>(in hex) 40  2E  3E</p><p>These hex values are not sent in this human-readable form, they must be<br/>converted to ASCII characters, where each byte is translated into an ASCII<br/>character.</p><p>You can see why you&apos;d want to automate the process. The short answer is that<br/>you should either write a script in Python or some language of your choise to<br/>do this, or better yet, use SCALA to convert the scale you design to help you<br/>export the SYSEX dump as a binary file. Read the docs of SCALA for more info.</p><p><a href="http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning.shtml">http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning.shtml</a> will have some pertinent info<br/>regarding the format of the SYSEX tuning dump.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div>
