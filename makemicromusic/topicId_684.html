Now it looks like I will get it, and it&apos;s<br/>already $50 higher in price.  Soon, in &quot;full release&quot; it will jump<br/>$150 more or so...</p><p>Rick, have you made any progress with it??</p><p>It seems like it could be a good surrogate to Csound.  Csound is<br/>going to take *forever* to learn.  I&apos;m not saying that I *couldn&apos;t*<br/>learn it properly, although I will leave that question open for the<br/>skeptics... but, certainly, I could be doing a *lot* of practical<br/>composing in the time I would learn to do anything substantial with<br/>that sucker...</p><p>*Also*... I have not been particularly impressed with the final<br/>efforts of the *Csound cadre* as evidenced on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> or anyplace<br/>else.  It always seems so &quot;algo&quot;...  cut from a full cloth, with the<br/>tailor only minimally present...</p><p>If that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to get with a &quot;modular&quot; approach, why not go<br/>with one that&apos;s a bit more &quot;user friendly&quot; for the time savings...</p><p>How&apos;s it going, Rick??</p><p>__________ _________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
