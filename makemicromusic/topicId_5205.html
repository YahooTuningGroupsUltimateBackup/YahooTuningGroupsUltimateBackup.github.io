It improves the look and feel,<br/>and is generally less buggy. Copy and paste from text fields works<br/>now and there are many other improvements and several bug fixes.<br/>Also many keyboard shortcuts were added (Alt-key combinations) so<br/>you don&apos;t need to use the mouse all the time to navigate.<br/>One of the new features is transforming a MIDI file to a Scala .seq<br/>file, see the Tools menu.<br/>Only the Windows version is released at the moment:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe</a><br/>5 Mb.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to remove the old version, but you shouldn&apos;t<br/>install this new version in the same directory. C:\Scala22 will be<br/>a good place. If you installed the trial version 2.1, then remove<br/>the complete directory before installing (unless you have saved files<br/>in it of course). Enjoy,</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
