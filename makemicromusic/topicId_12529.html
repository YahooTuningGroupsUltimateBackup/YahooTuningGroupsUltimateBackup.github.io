Gene, unless there are just a few that I am unaware of, you have a bit of a misunderstanding of softsynths and rendering. Most, if not *all* softsynths aren&apos;t combined with a midi sequencer/player internally - instead, they are designed to load into some sort of host.</p><p>A host can be of two types:</p><p>1. A host that is simply there for playback: you load up whatever instruments you want, and can play them in realtime from a keyboard or other device. Examples of this type (of no real use to you, unless you&apos;d like to do some playing) would be Chainer, Forte, or a new one from NI called (I believe) Kore. (these are all PC platform, which is where I thought you were coming from)</p><p>2. A sequencer/player/DAW that can load a variety (or one) of software instruments, either load or create a midi sequence, and then play back the result, either in realtime or render/export to a wave file. These apps are out there in legion; I&apos;ve mentioned Cakewalk/Sonar (in fact it is the one I offered for you to try out).</p><p>Anyway, some day you might try this route, but it would also entail a change in your working methods. If I could *ever* figure out what you put into Scala to come up with the .seq files, and could instead specify a tuning that Scala could save as a .scl or .tun, along with a midi file with no pitch bends in it, it would be fun to try one of your pieces on the Sonar/various softsynth platforms.</p><p>Anyhow, you aren&apos;t the only person who has wondered about the rendering properties of softsynths, and if there *is* a microtonal softie that can do rendering as well, I&apos;d be curious to know myself.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
