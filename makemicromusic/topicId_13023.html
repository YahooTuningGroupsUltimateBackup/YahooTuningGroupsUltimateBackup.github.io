If you know the URL to your file, might I ask you to post it,<br/>just to see if that might somehow solve the problem? If not, we should<br/>make some other arrangement, because I would love to hear it.</p><p>In the meantime, however, I might offer one comment about what looks like<br/>a very interesting scale. Maybe this might best be described as an<br/>arithmetic or subharmonic series 24:23:22:21:20:19:18:17:16:15:14:13:12.<br/>It is the kind of division in which medieval Near Eastern theorists take<br/>considerable interest (e.g. 14:13:12), and which Kathleen Schlesinger has<br/>suggested as an important element in various world musics.</p><p>What interests me most, however, is how you use this scale. Please feel<br/>free to contact me via e-mail also so that we can arrange some way for me<br/>to hear it.</p><p>By the way, the Yahoo problem: when I use the URL</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://group.yahoo.com/group/makemicromusic/files/">http://group.yahoo.com/group/makemicromusic/files/</a>&gt;</p><p>and sign in as a member, I go through a long chain of redirection -- too<br/>long for the lynx browser, which reports that 10 redirects have been<br/>exceeded.</p><p>If I try to start from the Home for MMM, then there&apos;s a menu which<br/>mentions &quot;Files&quot; as one of the &quot;Members Only&quot; services -- but without any<br/>text-based link that I can select with lynx (although the screen<br/>acknowledges my log-in and user name, so that I should be able access<br/>member-only features).</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what would happen if I had a URL with the filename or<br/>whatever included -- and if the file is 3 MB or so or less, I might<br/>consider just asking if you might please e-mail it to me.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s frustrating not being able to hear a contribution like this,<br/>and I do want to lend my prompt encouragement while seeking to hear it<br/>soon.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=13040 href="#13040">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2006 3:28:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; By the way, the Yahoo problem: when I use the URL<br/>&gt; &gt;       &lt;<a href="http://group.yahoo.com/group/makemicromusic/files/">http://group.yahoo.com/group/makemicromusic/files/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and sign in as a member, I go through a long chain of redirection -- too<br/>&gt; long for the lynx browser, which reports that 10 redirects have been<br/>&gt; exceeded.</p><p>That may be because you aren&apos;t taking the cookies.
