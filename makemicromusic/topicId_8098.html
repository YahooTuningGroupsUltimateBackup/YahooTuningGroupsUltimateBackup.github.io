The<br/>score indicates, believe it or not &quot;Police Whistle!&quot;  Maybe in 1999<br/>the Romanians weren&apos;t quite ready for that, since they used a rather<br/>discrete and pleasantly harmonic sound from that harmonica instead.<br/>I note, though, that in the recent performance of 2004 they use<br/>a &quot;real&quot; police whistle as was intended.  Maybe they&apos;ve &quot;loosened up&quot;<br/>a bit... :)  (Rest of the performance decidedly not as good, though<br/>as the 1999)</p><p>Thanks again!!!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
