Microtones are very much a part of Indian Classical music but are achieved<br/>through bending the strings (as with blues guitar) as far as I know. I have often considered<br/>moving the frets so that certain quarter tones could be played instead of semitones, and<br/>tuning the sympathetic strings accordingly, but I fear you&apos;d be encounter a few problems:<br/>in particular the tuning pegs for the sympathetic strings would get in the way and<br/>some frets would become too close together to use.</p><p>I don&apos;t actually know anything about the tubular guitar but I will investigate that tomorrow<br/>hopefully</p><p>thanks and goodnight<br/>Chris</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Welcome Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see you play sitar.
