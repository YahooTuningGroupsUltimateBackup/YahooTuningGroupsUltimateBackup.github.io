How could one not notice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, but how are they doing it?</p><p>Oh, c&apos;mon - people have posted details until they are blue in the face! Rick McGowan has written a virtual tutorial on using Finale/Garritan/FTS. I&apos;ve *always* posted how I worked with VSTs and hosts. I very publicly guided Joe Pehrson on adopting some of this paradigm, which he has done a couple of pieces with already.</p><p>It has been covered at length.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not going to try to become a keyboard artist</p><p>Sure, I can understand that. My chops are rudimentary at best. But if you have generated a midi file in some way, that means that you have the potential to take that as raw material and tweak it. If you produced a score for keyboard input, you might find an eager music student - who needed math tutoring - to help input it. You could - as others have - utilize graphical tools, like piano roll entry, or things like step entry or other methods. I wouldn&apos;t get the worst gig in the worst dive on keyboard, but what I&apos;ve managed to get happening - skill-wise - has paid off both in entry of music into a sequencer as well as the great enjoyment of just sitting back, plugging in a tuning into a VST and playing for the pleasure of it.</p><p>A few years ago, when I was writing/recording music for a production library company, I came up with a demo for one of the albums. The featured instrument in my demo was a classical guitar on the main melody. But when I went in to produce the track the president of the company said &quot;I&apos;ve already got enough guitar features, lets do it with piano&quot;. Hell, I didn&apos;t have a pianist scheduled that day, and couldn&apos;t get one. We put down all the other tracks, and damn if I didn&apos;t have to go out of the booth into the studio and lay down the piano track myself.</p><p>Sad to say, it&apos;s one of the tracks that still gets play, either on the History channel or Discovery, I can&apos;t remember which. I just see it turn up on the BMI usage/royalty statement.

They *aren&apos;t* interested in microtonality, for the most part. But when approached appropriately, they are willing to be interested. As long as they are going to go that far, are you willing to alter/adapt/re-learn some of your work flow, with the possibility you&apos;ll find some new and inspirational areas?</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3>Joe &#x3C;tamahome02000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2006 8:19:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I actually recently emailed Ableton Live:</p><p>  Joe,</p><p>  at this point Ableton Live instruments do not provide microtonal<br/>  scales, however Live does support detuning the instruments in<br/>  microtonal increments, and of course Live also loads synths such as<br/>  Absynth, Reaktor etc., which *do* provide microtonal scales.</p><p>  All the best,<br/>  --<br/>  Andreas Wetterberg<br/>  ableton ag</p><p>Another option is just to get a really good soundfont and maybe turn<br/>on some reverb, and then record from &apos;what you hear&apos; or &apos;wave out mix&apos;<br/>using Audacity (free recording app).
