This &quot;no-budget&quot; composition was made with 2 TX81Zs (and some<br/>&gt;freeware plugins), which can be found on the used gear market for<br/>&gt;about $50.00 each. I twiddled in frenzy of bliss making it!</p><p>Excellent addendum, Jacky. I only wish everyone who was passionately involved in researching tunings would spend a little time, and very little resources, to do pieces like this. No need for more Beethoven 9th or any other grandiose projects, just take a look at the numbers and see what kind of music you can make, right then.</p><p>You are an exemplar par excellance, and Mom thanks you...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.</p><p>&gt;... and throw off the yoke of the 12 tET dominator once and for all.</p><p>Sort of like &quot;Egg Beaters&quot; for intonation?</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2001 8:32:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Change Ringing?
