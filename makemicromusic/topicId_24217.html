Even up to having 2 or so notes<br/>sustained...things can even sound well-defined and stable in this scale, it<br/>seems.</p><p>   However, I remain highly unconvinced of the scale&apos;s (or any scale with that<br/>level of beating)&apos;s aptitude at full chords (read: over 2 notes held at once)<br/>and/or polyphonic music.<br/>  Chris&apos;s piece has a ghastly feel: nearly everything sounds inbetween IE<br/>neither in a state of resolve or tension and holds the same narrow mood for<br/>almost the whole song.  Even Igs&apos;s crystal clear (for this scale) song sounds to<br/>me like it shifts between three tonal/color roots, and no more (not bad: my<br/>example sounded more like 2 roots).  Plus in his song, it&apos;s (still) almost as if<br/>my mind is &quot;pulling the scale&apos;s ghastly beating echoes toward the nearest<br/>chords&quot;...rather than actually hearing chords.  I&apos;m not convinced the lack of<br/>consonance is actually helping give more mood in the slightest...more like<br/>looking at a Picasso painting while seriously drunk and partly guessing where<br/>the lines are.<br/>----------------<br/>   Now, the real test to me...in to test this song on musicians who have never<br/>heard microtonal music (without telling them it is microtonal) and see how it<br/>does against something middle-of-the-road (definitely not like 12TET, but not<br/>inharmonic either) like Sethares&apos; Seventeen Dragon Dreams<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mck2PcsZ44">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mck2PcsZ44</a>.<br/>  Actually, make that Igs vs. Sethares (lol)...both are very cleverly composed<br/>so IMVHO it leaves the judgment down to what people think of the scales.</p><p>   I am also going to post a short example in what I think is my MOST tonally<br/>colorful scale...Dimension^2 (a 12-tone version of my Dimension scale)...which<br/>is based on precision around my favorite dyads from all possible roots to all<br/>other notes...</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24245 href="#24245">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2011 9:29:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    However, I remain highly unconvinced of the scale&apos;s (or any scale with that<br/>&gt; level of beating)&apos;s aptitude at full chords (read: over 2 notes held at once)<br/>&gt; and/or polyphonic music.</p><p>My piece was actually decently polyphonic, at least as polyphonic as the average piece of pop music on the radio.

If it includes something like Stravinsky or anything<br/>relatively Neo-Classical like that or complex jazz (many of which border on as<br/>or more atonal than inharmonic microtonal music despite being in 12TET)...I&apos;m<br/>not at all surprised.</p><p>   However, if he listens to only pop/dance/country/rock...yes, that&apos;s a<br/>shocker!</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;I am also going to post a short example in what I think is my MOST tonally<br/>&gt; colorful scale...Dimension^2 (a 12-tone version of my Dimension scale)...which</p><p>&gt; is based on precision around my favorite dyads from all possible roots to all<br/>&gt; other notes...&quot;</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>Igs&gt;&quot;Have you posted this scale (Dimension^2, the 12 tone version of my maximum<br/>consonance scale) yet?&quot;</p><p>    Not yet, but I will.
