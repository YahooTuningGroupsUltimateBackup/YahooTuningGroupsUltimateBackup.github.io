The proposition<br/>that all tuning systems are equally usable is *theory*. My objection<br/>to it is not theoretical but practical--to my ears, it just ain&apos;t so.<br/>I would rate 15 as borderline, and 12 and 19 across the border; the<br/>border being my own personal one. 14 just does not do it for me. By<br/>the time we get to 31, things are sounding downright nice, though<br/>clearly this is still not JI.</p><p>Apparently getting within 6 cents or so sounds pretty good to me,<br/>which is a theoretical analysis of the fact of my own auditory<br/>preferences. Getting within 3 cents, as 72 does, begins to sound a lot<br/>like JI. Systems such as ennealimmal, which get to within a fraction<br/>of a cent to JI, to my ears are effectively JI. To my ears, therefore,<br/>there is no reason at all not to temper out 2401/2400, and tempering<br/>out 225/224 works pretty darn well. Again, this is not really theory,<br/>it is an analysis based on what my own listening preferences seem to<br/>show. Some people refuse to consider tempering out 2401/2400; that may<br/>make sense with their ears, or it may simply be a statement of<br/>principle, but it&apos;s not theory with me that doing so, for me, works.</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I mention this because if anyone out there making<br/>microtonal music wishes to pursue a non-Western-tonal/non-common-<br/>practice path while employing the consonances you refer to, 22 would<br/>be an excellent system for them to try. I think Blackwood did quite a<br/>good job of this sort of thing in his 15-tone and 16-tone etudes but<br/>missed the boat big time in his 22-tone one.</p><p>&gt; Another example: playing with a fourth root of 36/7 pentatonic<br/>scale I<br/>&gt; devised, I now feel that I can enjoy 9/7 thirds *without* the rest<br/>of the<br/>&gt; lower primes, in certain contexts/timbres, where before I couldn&apos;t.</p><p>I know this isn&apos;t really on point, but may I ask you a question?</p><p>Just out of curiosity.</p><p>Can you hear the difference between the fourth root of 36/7<br/>pentatonic scale you devised, and the chain-of-fifths pentatonic in<br/>22-equal? I sure can&apos;t (fractions of a cent!) . . .</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s sort of like learning to like the taste of certain exotic<br/>&gt;foods, or beer.</p><p>Exactly. This is a very apt analogy, perhaps the best way there is of<br/>explaining this experience.</p><p>&gt; I think there&apos;s no reason to be a fundamentalist, (and to me there<br/>&gt;is nothing<br/>&gt; more fundamentalist than &apos;only JI please&apos; or &apos;JI approximations<br/>&gt;only<br/>&gt; please&apos;--I agree with Darreg) esp. since we see what that does in<br/>&gt;religion,<br/>&gt; to which we can attribute 95% of the worlds ills. Why do that to<br/>&gt;tuning?</p><p>I sympathize with this greatly. My feelings about JI fundamentalism<br/>are well-documented elsewhere, so I won&apos;t repeat them here. I&apos;ve<br/>fought tooth and nail against the ill effects of JI fundamentalism,<br/>while at the same time defending JI and its practitioners from those<br/>would paint it as both a musical dead-end and as theoretical folly.<br/>Between the latter group and the JI fundamentalists, there is an<br/>insuperable gulf which has parts of the alternative tuning community<br/>in a virtual civil war, further impeding a unified &quot;assault&quot; on the<br/>mainstream stuck-in-12-equal Western world. Does striking out on an<br/>unconventional musical path necessarily deafen one to the aesthetics,<br/>logic, and worth of those would would take a different unconventional<br/>musical path? (sigh)</p><p>Anyway, there are many senses in which a tuning can approximate JI,<br/>and if you combine these senses together end-to-end, it becomes<br/>virtually impossible to find a tuning that *can&apos;t* be thought of in<br/>this way. This line of argument caused Dave Keenan a lot of<br/>consternation, but causes my tuning vistas to be very wide at the<br/>moment, despite the fact that I am, for the moment, pursuing the &apos;JI<br/>approximations&apos; path -- only partly because there&apos;s strong recent<br/>neurobiological evidence that this is how we hear, and partly because<br/>musical history has struck out partway along this path and I feel an<br/>obligation to continue. The recent Mavila tuning that I posted here<br/>is a case in point -- it &apos;approximates&apos; 5-limit JI as best it can<br/>while having 135:128 vanish. The result is that it sounds *very*<br/>exotic -- much like Pelog, in fact -- while being much simpler to<br/>navigate than JI. And it &quot;works&quot; -- the harmonies sound like<br/>*harmonies* -- with several of the timbres already in our keyboards,<br/>even including some bowed string sounds. If one allows nudging the<br/>timbre to better match the tuning, one could get away with even<br/>larger deviations. And also employing adaptive retuning (notes change<br/>pitch very slightly according to context) would allow tuning schemes<br/>with still further deviations from JI to act as &apos;approximations of<br/>JI&apos; in a sense.</p><p>&gt; Thankfully, life is large, and the borders for what is art for me<br/>are faraway<br/>&gt; from where I stand, and there is a lot of new territory to<br/>cover !!! I like<br/>&gt; it llike that.</p><p>This is, indeed, the important point. Almost any alternative tuning<br/>is a great breath of fresh air to work with -- one doesn&apos;t have to<br/>worry about avoiding cliches. This is surely the way forward in our<br/>culture -- even this many years after Stravinsky said so:</p><p>Robert Craft: &apos;Is any musical element still susceptible to radical<br/>exploitation and development?&apos;<br/>Igor Stravinsky: &apos;Yes: pitch. I even risk a prediction that pitch<br/>will comprise the main difference between the &quot;music of the future&quot;<br/>and our music, and I consider that the most important aspect of<br/>electronic music is the fact that it can manufacture pitch. Our mid-<br/>twentieth-century situation, in regard to pitch, might perhaps be<br/>compared to that of the mid-sixteenth century, when, after Willaert<br/>and others had proved the necessity of equal temperament, the great<br/>pitch experiments began--Zarlino&apos;s quarter-tone instrument,<br/>Vincentino&apos;s thirty-nine-tones-to-the-octave archicembalo, and<br/>others. These instruments failed, of course, and the well-tempered<br/>clavier was established (though at least three hundred years before<br/>Bach), but our ears are more ready for such experiments now--mine<br/>are, at any rate. I had been watching the Kuramatengu play in Osaka<br/>one afternoon recently and had become accustomed to the Noh flute.<br/>Later, in a restaurant, I suddenly heard an ordinary flute, playing<br/>ordinary (well-tempered) music. I was shocked, music apart--I think I<br/>could keep the music apart anyway--by the expressive poverty of the<br/>tuning.&apos;</p></div><h3>Andrew Heathwaite &#x3C;gtrpkt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2004 1:39:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Gene Ward Smith &lt;gwsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
