Idea for it was to<br/>use ratios with all the numbers involved<br/>odd, and to use a clarinet as the voice<br/>because it has only odd partials</p><p>The scale is</p><p>21/19 11/9 9/7 7/5 3/2 5/3 11/6 2/1</p><p>Played on the koto and clarinet voices of<br/>my SB Live!, with its metallic room 1<br/>reverb at 50%.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/strange_times.mp3">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/strange_times.mp3</a></p><p>(1.5 MB)</p><p>I suppose it is probably meant to evoke<br/>how terrifying it must be to be an ordinary<br/>citizen in Baghdad today.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2003 11:09:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>JUst to say my track is now up at <a href="http://mp3.com.au">mp3.com.au</a> for those<br/>who find streaming easier.</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/artist.asp?id=5737">http://www.mp3.com.au/artist.asp?id=5737</a></p><p>Also, to say, it is out of sympathy for residents in<br/>Baghdad, and I hope no-one takes it as criticism<br/>of the invading forces particularly - I don&apos;t understand<br/>the politics there enough to understand what is goin<br/>on at all - pacifist myself. Does rather seem like<br/>tilting at windmills somehow though from a point of view<br/>of someone who is really rather politically unaware<br/>I must say :-).</p><p>But htink what an awful time they must be going through,<br/>bombs falling on your home city, even if you maybe weren&apos;t<br/>so happy under the old regime, at least you know a bit about<br/>how things worked, and kind of got by - while they know<br/>very little probably about the Americans and British and<br/>must be wary of their intentions - and it must be just<br/>so very scary.</p><p>Don&apos;t believe the US propoganda pictures of smiling<br/>Iraquis waving US flags - I can&apos;t imagine they<br/>feel tht way - very few - not just overjoyed and happy abotu it<br/>not yet anyway! Well, don&apos;t suppose many here do,<br/>but thought this experssion of sympathy in music<br/>might be of value somehow,</p><p>best,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
