I was recently in your shoes, Jacob.  I am a music student who<br/>decided to use the internet to learn about microtonality, because my school<br/>sure as hell wasn&apos;t going to touch it.  I agree that there ought to be an<br/>up-to-date list for people like us who want to discover what microtonality<br/>is all about by listening to some good pieces.</p><p>I made one!  I spent the afternoon going through my Netscape Bookmarks and<br/>putting them into html so I could upload a list of links.</p><p>It&apos;s not complete, I&apos;m sure, but I&apos;d like it to be.  If anyone on this list<br/>knows of any microtonal/xenharmonic music at all that is available to listen<br/>to on the internet, please email me off-list and tell me.  I&apos;d be delighted<br/>to make the list more complete.</p><p>Also, I wrote very little descriptions of what&apos;s on each page, and if any of<br/>you are on the list and don&apos;t like what I wrote about you, give me a<br/>suggestion for something you&apos;d prefer, and I&apos;ll happily change it.  It&apos;s<br/>nice to be identified to your liking.</p><p>Please don&apos;t be shy about sending me links!  Ever since I discovered what<br/>I&apos;d been missing, I&apos;ve felt very strongly about sharing what I&apos;ve learned.<br/>It&apos;s important to me to make a good list.  This is a mission I&apos;ve very<br/>happily taken on, and I will not let it go without updates!</p><p>Jacob, thanks for the suggestion.  I think a new listening list was<br/>definitely called for.</p><p>-Andrew</p><p>--- piccolosandcheese &lt;jbarton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I suppose I oughta introduce myself first.
