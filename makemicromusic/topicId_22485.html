I enjoyed it. A recent article in New Scientist magazine stated that atleast one traditional culture doesn&apos;t use octaves, but didn&apos;t say which one. Does anyone know which culture and whether they use tritaves like Bohlen Pierce or some other interval, or alternatively don&apos;t have a system where a higher note is regarded as being essentially the same as a lower note?</p></div>
