John Starrett&apos;s tracks are mind-blowing, positively some of the most accessible microtonal music ever written.  The guitar solo in &quot;Limp Off to School&quot; is just...damn.  Neil Haverstick&apos;s playing, I presume?  Also thoroughly dig the Ernie Crews/Haverstick piece...good gravy, Neil is just dominating the f*** out of that classical guitar!
