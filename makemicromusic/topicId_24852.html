Then throughout the month, you<br/>click the Flattr button on content you like (much like<br/>Facebook&apos;s Like button).  At the end of the month, your money<br/>is split evenly between all the content you flattred.<br/>Simple and brilliant.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how widely deployed the Flattr buttons are, but<br/>I&apos;ll start paying attention to them now.  Chris- thought you<br/>might be interested in this for your users on your hosting<br/>sites.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2011 9:07:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>P2P lending, you say?</p><p>Now, if there were only a way to incentivize the giving of money, and<br/>one that doesn&apos;t depend on altruism, you&apos;d really have a killer<br/>business model. I&apos;ve been tossing this idea around for a long time.<br/>Some guy wrote about it on a random blog on the internet, and I<br/>thought it was a brilliant idea. :)</p><p>Thanks for pointing this out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
