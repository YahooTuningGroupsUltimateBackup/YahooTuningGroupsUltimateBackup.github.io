Non real time ones only change pitches of new notes.</p><p>I&apos;ve done some work on implementing tonic shifts in FTS<br/>as in Carl Lumma&apos;s spec, and did it by remapping notes to<br/>other channels as needed for the pitch bends - that was all &quot;non real time&quot;<br/>in this terminology, leaving existing notes at their<br/>present pitches. The problem was that one might have two<br/>notes that have the same pitch bend as each other before<br/>a tonic shift, and then need different pitch bends afterwards,<br/>and then one would only be able to do that by switching<br/>one of them off and on again. After thinking through<br/>the implications of programming that, I decided to<br/>put it off to a later date :-).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=2713 href="#2713">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2002 2:37:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,</p><p>I&apos;ve added the single note retuning to FTS. Also while at it, I&apos;ve added the other<br/>four formats as well.</p><p>So, I can provide files in them all, and for suitable ones, the same file<br/>in all five formats + the same file as midi with channel remapping and pitch bends<br/>which one could listen to to compare.</p><p>Todays upload of FTS can also send the sysexes in real time for the<br/>single note retuning.</p><p>There&apos;s no help for it yet, so here is an overview:</p><p>.............................................................................</p><p>To use FTS to test real time retuning, choose</p><p>Out | Options | Tuning Programs | Use tuning programs,</p><p>and select the appropriate type to use, then it will play the fractal tunes<br/>using the sysexes to retune the notes, ditto for midi relaying. You can<br/>also choose which tuning program and bank to use for each part.</p><p>In case where the fractal tune needs more than 128 notes to<br/>be retuned and one uses one of the two bulk data formats,<br/>any extra notes in the fractal tune will simply not<br/>be played (because sending a new bulk dump to retune<br/>an extra note would take too much time).</p><p>As a quick way to generate files in all six formats:</p><p>If you check the option to save in all six formats and use<br/>File | Save As | Files of type | Midi files, it will save the<br/>fractal tune in all six formats at once, adding to the file name<br/>_S, _SB, _SBNR, _B, _BB<br/>for the saves using single note retuning, single note retuning with bank,<br/>ditto, non real time, bulk tuning dump, and bulk tuning dump<br/>with bank.</p><p>Fractal tunes shouldl sound the same with single note retuning with bank, whether<br/>real time or non real time.</p><p>However, single note retuning with bank real time and non real time<br/>options should have different effects with relaying from miid keyboard<br/>using<br/>Views | Midi Keyboard Advanced | Presets for Scales for tracks<br/>| M.W. Scale + Tonic shifts.<br/>+ Retune sounding notes. The real time one should let one<br/>retune notes already sounding so that one will hear them shift<br/>in pitch as one changes the tonic, while with the the non real time option<br/>FTS will try to retune them in the same way, but it should<br/>have no effect.<br/>.............................................................................</p><p>No way of testing it though at present.. I&apos;d be interested<br/>to beta test FM7 with FTS so that FTS is ready with this option<br/>for the release of new version of FM7. Maybe they&apos;d also like to use FTS<br/>with FM7 to try out the single note retuning in real time.</p><p>The hex dumps and sysexes look right as far as I can tell<br/>without actually trying them out with a synth / softsynth.</p><p>BTW I enjoyed your CSound harmonic drone, thanks!</p><p>Robert</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
