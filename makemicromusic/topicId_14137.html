A clip or two of Karnatic music is the main thing<br/>for right now. -Stephen</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>However, that page you linked to says in a subtle way what I&apos;ve<br/>been saying:</p><p>&quot;The basic reason for such demands for more than twelve &apos;srutis&apos;<br/>per octave is that Indian music, (not just Karnatic music) seems<br/>to &apos;flow&apos; through the frequencies, whereas a Western song seems<br/>&apos;jumpy&apos;.&quot;</p><p>It sounds to me like what they&apos;re doing is very much a real<br/>microtonal scale, they&apos;re progressing through the notes set on<br/>perfect ratios, and because the perfect ratios aren&apos;t<br/>self-consistant, this requires several different versions of<br/>each note as the song progresses through different notes.  Look<br/>at the names of the notes in Table III on that page.  There&apos;s<br/>&quot;Sa&quot; which is the root note, which only has one version, and Pa<br/>which is the perfect 3:2, then there are four different versions<br/>of six other notes.  I imagine there are only seven note names<br/>because the notes are used only seven at a time; each version of<br/>each note is used for some time, then later in the song a<br/>different version of that note is used.  If you convert all of<br/>the frequency values in Table III on that page into cents<br/>values, and plot them on some graph paper (which I&apos;ve done, but<br/>my dumb ass already deleted the converted values forgetting just<br/>how much work it took to convert them) then you see that while<br/>the<br/>root note and the 3:2 ratio note are spot on, the remaining<br/>notes are all pretty much in pairs to the right and left of each<br/>of the 12 tone equal temprement notes, the biggest exception<br/>being the very last one which is pretty much spot on in between<br/>notes.</p><p>&gt; I tried to find some free clips but could not.</p><p>I&apos;m interested to hear what it sounds like if you ever do find a<br/>recording.  I suspect that it will only sound a little unusual<br/>if it sounds unusual at all, which may well be why it is<br/>difficult to find a recording.  It may sound so not-unsual that<br/>no one sees the point in doing anything but describing in text<br/>why it is different.</p><p>&gt; Well, I would say there is science involved regarding the<br/>harmonics. But we<br/>&gt; can see once again that so so much is culture. 22 notes, I<br/>didn&apos;t know that<br/>&gt; until now.</p><p>If you could see the plot that I made on paper, it really isn&apos;t<br/>all that unusual.  It&apos;s basically a 24 tone scale, but whereas<br/>all of the other notes are represented by two tones, one<br/>slightly above and one slightly below the 12TET tone, the C and<br/>G notes are represented by only one tone.  The only really<br/>unusual thing is that the pair for B, the one that would be just<br/>slightly higher than B is actually nearly between B and C.<br/>There&apos;s certainly a culture aspect to it, but I still believe<br/>they&apos;re playing seven notes to an octave and simply modifying<br/>the frequency of each note as the song goes on, which is what<br/>the true microtonal scales are all about.  In our culture we<br/>just don&apos;t mess with that sort of nonsense, and in their<br/>culture, they don&apos;t understand how we do without it.  I still<br/>suspect that the largest difference between their music and ours<br/>will be along the lines of the difference between classical<br/>music and rap music, which is to say that there will be<br/>differences so<br/>large that any difference in the musical scale will seem<br/>insignifigant.</p><p>(Comments of Richard Cooper and Stephen Szpak)</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2006 5:18:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stephenszpak&quot;<br/>&lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; SOUTH INDIAN CLASSICAL (KARNATIC) MUSIC<br/>&gt;<br/> I just found this site for free (I assume it is...

I haven&apos;t heard such a comparison, but I&apos;ve heard recordings of Burmese music and Balinese gamelan music played on a 12-ET piano. Call me a purist, but I prefer the original tunings. Half of the character of the music in these cases comes from the tuning (approx. 7-ET for Burmese, 5-note pelog scales for Balinese gamelan). The difference between Indian scales and 12-ET is more subtle and might be more difficult for inexperienced ears to appreciate. (more like the difference between Mozart being played in a historically correct tuning vs. a modern 12-ET piano).</p></div><h3>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2006 12:40:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think a huge problem with studying the tuning of other cultures is<br/>that almost the entire world has been saturated with 12et, so that one<br/>can never be sure what a really &quot;traditional&quot; intonation would sound<br/>like.
