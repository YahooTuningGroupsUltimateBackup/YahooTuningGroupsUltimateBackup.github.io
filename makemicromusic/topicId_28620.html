This turns out to be a good way of working for me, and surprisingly, it&apos;s accurate enough for my purposes.</p><p>In a more advanced version of this piece, the pitch-bend changes will be disguised, but here you can hear them.</p><p>The improv is heavy on 3-7-9-11-13 motives, and I&apos;m trying to avoid too obvious extended dominant seventh chords.</p></div>
