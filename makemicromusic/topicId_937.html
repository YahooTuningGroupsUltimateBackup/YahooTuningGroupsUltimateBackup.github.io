Those may be pretty close<br/>to the exact pitch, depending on hardware / software it is realised<br/>on. Even then, pitch mightn&apos;t be as intended for one<br/>reason or another (glitches intervene, or hardware limitations<br/>in resolution, or whatever).</p><p>What though about someone performing a microtonal piece on an<br/>acoustic instrument.</p><p>Some really gifted performers will be able to play<br/>the exact pitches pretty much as written (to within a few<br/>cents, or maybe even a single cent). Or one can add in some<br/>electronic instruments / microtonal keyboard as support for<br/>the other players.</p><p>However, more generally, how about htis idea. I think of a<br/>microtonal piece in a particular tuning as inspired by<br/>the temperament or scale. Somehow when composing in it,<br/>the shape of the piece gets affected by the pitches in the<br/>scale.</p><p>I&apos;ve just posted about this particular idea to crazy_music<br/>for those who are following the debates there.</p><p>Once finished, you have the piece, and a midi realisation<br/>of it perhaps (or could be mp3) which a performer can listen<br/>to to hear how it works. Then they can perform it.</p><p>But, just as a metronomic realisation of rhythm just gives<br/>first idea of how rhythm goes in a piece, so a midi clip<br/>microtonally tuned could be used the same way for pitch.</p><p>Of course on microtonally retuned keyboard one just plays the pitches<br/>as shown.</p><p>However for other instruments, perhaps one can use the<br/>original pitches as a general guide, as one does with<br/>the beats for a rhythm, and then maybe one can then<br/>intonate in a way that fits with the overall feel /<br/>intention / idea of the piece. Basically at that point,<br/>if it works, then it is okay I think.</p><p>Even on microtonal keyboard, one can pitch bend<br/>the notes, and abitility to do that more may be<br/>a nice thing to add (how about having multiple<br/>midi controllers, with each one micro-adjusting the<br/>pitch of one of the notes of the scale?)</p><p>Perhaps we can learn from the Indian Alaps too,<br/>and the other traditions that use microtonal<br/>bending of notes.</p><p>May be an interesting point for debate anyway,...</p><p>Robert</p></div>
