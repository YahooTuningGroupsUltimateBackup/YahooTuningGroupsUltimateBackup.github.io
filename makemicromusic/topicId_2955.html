I&apos;ll send you the details off-list in just a moment. And this is to remind everyone of the small, &apos;other&apos; area that I&apos;ve registered and set aside for our use, <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a></p><p>There is just 20 meg to play with, but I just rotate the pieces in a FIFO queue, so new pieces displace the oldest. All I ask is you contact me, have in mind a brief description of the piece, and I&apos;ll get it up there.</p><p>Also, if you want a more commercial alternative, and one that you can keep your stuff up longer, a few of the members have been using zebox for posting files:<br/><a href="http://www.zebox.com/">http://www.zebox.com/</a></p><p>Look for an email off-list, Justin.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (ListMom)</p></div>
