The freedom (to vote) that men<br/>have<br/>had to fight for; women have had naturally even under the most<br/>repressive<br/> regims. It&apos;s just they haven&apos;t realized they have this power and have<br/>allowed others to dominate them and run their lives and take this<br/>power away from them. Yes, even today and full knowing about their<br/>power: if<br/>women decide to serve the rich and be their slaves (by choosing to<br/>have enough offspring to continue the society under a situation where<br/>the<br/>rich dominate them); then that is the way it shall be. The women have<br/>thus<br/>spoken and that is the way it shall be. And here in America, women<br/>have it pretty well compared to 3rd world countries and Islamic<br/>countries.<br/>So it is no wonder that women would chose to continue this society<br/>when<br/>we compare it to the stark differences which exist in other societies.<br/>But in 3rd world countries where birth rates are high, the method of<br/>power is out of place and unlikely to have much of an effect. Islamic<br/>countries, however, may be another matter. Here, women can gain great<br/>strides in treatment and rights by using the method.<br/>One of the side effects of the method is that the society under<br/>discontinuing their next generation, experiences a higher standard of<br/>living (because resources are not used in the raising of offspring and<br/>are free for other things). So if the women of the Islamic world<br/>decide to excersize their power, then we may feel even more Islamic<br/>pwer<br/>wielded at us even in addition to what we have experienced so far.<br/>But I wish to jump ahead in time beyond the present Islamic conflicts,<br/>and express the predicted limitations as well as accomplishments of<br/>&apos;the method&apos;.The rich through globalization seek to subjugate all of<br/>us.<br/>They seek to sort us into haves and have-nots where there are enough<br/>have-nots to<br/>service the haves. But this will not work because with the use of the<br/>method, this system can be eliminated in the developed countries.<br/>(Women can by excersizing their power, force the rich to make life<br/>good for<br/>all within the developed countries. -Otherwise they would bring an<br/>enslavement society envisioned by the rich for the developed<br/>countries, to an end.) This is an accomplisment of &apos;the method&apos;.<br/>Otherwise the rich through globalization were poised to divide our<br/>population in developed countries into haves and have-nots just like<br/>in 3rd world countries.<br/>&apos;the method&apos; acts as an insurance against them even trying this (in<br/> addition to the democratic political processes already in place).<br/>But as for 3rd world foreign countries (wherever there is high birth<br/>rates), the rich will enslave and plunder these people , and there is<br/>nothing &apos;the method&apos; will do to help these people. People of developed<br/>countries will be content to live off the labor of 3rd world<br/>countries, and developed country women will not act to upset this<br/>system as they will have it pretty good and won&apos;t want to change that.<br/>This is a limitation of &apos;the method&apos;. So who will bother to champion<br/>the rights of the enslaved in the 3rd world?<br/>Well apparently the islamic fundamentalists have taken issue with the<br/>rich in response to what the rich are doing in the Islamic world. Yet<br/>I don&apos;t think the rich are doing much enslaving in the Islamic world<br/>like they do in the 3rd world. The Islamic position is a strong one<br/>economically in that some of them control the key resource of oil.<br/> What the rich have done is to facilitate the creation of a condition<br/>of<br/>haves and have-nots in the Islamic world. -but not by enslaving any in<br/>the<br/>Islamic world. This is done by giving wealth to those in the Islamic<br/>world who control oil. Those who have no say over this oil, are then<br/>left behind as the &apos;have nots&apos;. Their condition has not been harmed by<br/>the<br/>rich; it is just that they have been left out of the wealth the rich<br/>have bestowed on their fellow arabs. Being more control freaks than<br/>even the rich, the arab fundamentalists have noticed the disruption<br/>in their culture that the introduction of thes oil wealth to some has<br/>caused, and have acted to put a stop to it -by attacking the rich (the<br/>US).<br/>But what I take issue with and place the most emphasis on is: what is<br/>destructive and destructive to life. When the rich enslave 3rd world<br/>people; that is destructive to their lives. When wealthy jews and the<br/>rest of europe enslaved the germans after WW1, that was destructive to<br/>their lives. When hitler killed those jews and took their money to run<br/>his war machine; that was even more destructive to life. The glaring<br/>flaw of Hitler and the 9-11 terrorist attacks, is that they contained<br/>so<br/>much destructiveness of life themselves, that they themselves became<br/>the<br/>problem instead of being a solution to act against the destructiveness<br/>of the rich which we will always have.<br/>Being enslaved and oppressed leaves those under such in the 3rd world<br/>in a poor state to retaliate for the destruction the rich do to them.<br/>Yet<br/>these are the only people who should (it would seem) have a right to<br/>retaliate (as a matter of self defense).<br/>We need in the US, in addition to &apos;the method&apos; (which is incomplete<br/>and doesn&apos;t help the plight of the 3rd world), a new &apos;fundamentalism&apos;,<br/>home grown in the US which champions the plight of the 3rd world, as<br/>an<br/>independent party apart from the 3rd world which is too downtrodden<br/>and oppressed to defend itself. -To act against the rich in ways which<br/>may<br/>be illegal, but in ways that are not so destructive -which minimize<br/>destruction to human life. When Jesus spoiled the money tables of the<br/>money changers in the temple, I&apos;m sure there could have been charges<br/>brought for destruction of property etc; but even so, none of the<br/>money changers were killed or maimed. There lives and bodies were<br/>spared.<br/>And now the kingdom of God exists not in any temple, but all over.<br/>What<br/>I&apos;m saying is that we as fundamentalists can do a lot better job<br/>acting as<br/>an independent party championing the rights of the oppressed than<br/>these<br/>terrorists have done.<br/>Since I have rejected terrorism as an acceptable way to get things<br/>done (becausethrough relying so heavily on destructiveness, it becomes<br/>the<br/>problem instead of a solution; and because those under oppression are<br/>often too weak to retaliate due to their oppression); I thus cannot<br/>leave this subject without commenting on the suicide bombings in<br/>Isriael.<br/>The reason I rejected terrorism was because it was too destructive.<br/>But<br/>under special ciercumstances where one is unable to escape<br/>destruction:<br/>where destruction is forced on one: where destruction is unavoidable:<br/>then<br/>my objection due to destructiveness is invalid and no longer applies.<br/>If<br/>some forse makes your life so unbearable that it isn&apos;t worth living,<br/>then a suicide bombing is a reasonable answer to that situation<br/>because<br/>something that makes your life so unbearable that it isn&apos;t worth<br/>living, is itself quite destructive of your life. With a large<br/>destruction and destructiveness already present and rampant in your<br/>area; and act by you<br/>to suicide bomb, will just shift the destruction around, which is<br/>irrelevent to the overall amount of destruction which is my only<br/>concern.<br/>-Once an overwhelming destructiveness is present and exists; I reject<br/> thearguement that it can be contained -that some can be made to bear<br/>the<br/>burden and suffering so that others may live well. I only seek to<br/>eliminate the destructiion from existance in the first place. So that<br/>ifone group is oppressing another group, that second group I feel has<br/>a<br/>self defense right to retaliate or that it cannot be prevented for<br/>that<br/>group to retaliate and spread the destruction around. Usually those<br/>who are enslaved or oppressed are pretty powerless to retaliate and so<br/>they suffer in silence. But with the suicide bombing concept, even the<br/>oppressed and weak can put an end to suffering and tryu to change<br/>things for the better. And the oppressor will get an unwelcome<br/>and unexpected taste of their own medicine.<br/>Let us be specific and analyze the situations we see around us. In the<br/>case of the Palestinians the case can be made that Isrial has at least<br/>in part and recently been responsible for making life unbearable for<br/> Palestinians living in refugee camps -ging in and bombinb and<br/>buldozing their houses etc. So they get some of their own medicine.<br/>But in the case of the suicide bombers who flew the planes into the US<br/>buildings, I make a distinction. Even though they are both arab<br/>suicide actions, I beg to list them as quite different animals.<br/>Basically the US was not doing anything to make thes arab&apos;s lives<br/>miserable. They acted out of an extreme intolerance of other<br/> religions/cultures; and not out of being trapped by any destruction.<br/>They initiated this destruction for the most part. An obsessively<br/> controlling islamic fundamentalism was making these people&apos;s<br/>lives miserable if they didn&apos;t do the suicide, just like the<br/>controlling japaneese system trotted out their soldiers to be<br/>kamakazies. So in my book, the arabs that blew up our buildings<br/>were just like the japaneese kamakazies -they failed to give their<br/>destruction via their suicide to what was making their lives<br/>miserable enough to go suicide -their own system. They may have<br/>believed there was a clash between their culture<br/>and ours and that they needed to act in defense of their culture; but<br/>in terms of destructiveness: they initiated destructiveness when they<br/>were not under destruction themselves or aimed their destruction<br/>against<br/>thosewho had not caused their destruction. So here, my objection to<br/>this<br/>terrorism, remains, because they acted not out of being trapped of<br/>destruction or of having destruction forced on them; but out of being<br/>free of us harming them. They are thus the instigators and initiators<br/>of<br/>destruciveness where no destructiveness existed before. Thus they are<br/>part of the problem concerning the problem of destructiveness and not<br/>the solution.<br/>Now that I&apos;ve opened the can of worms of the Palestinian question, my<br/>comment wojuld not be complete without an overall picture. Here we<br/>have the tiny nation of Isrial in the middle of the islamic world.<br/>And oh what a stink there is. The arab nations have all risen up<br/>to not even accept the existence of it. Not only the Paalestinians,<br/>but all of islam is just intolerant of any other culture/religion<br/>but their own. The taliban excemplified this by their imprissoning<br/>workers for preaching Christianity, and by their destruction of<br/>buhdist monuments. Even the Palestinian leadership seems not to be<br/>interested in peace with Isrial, but with wiping Isreal from<br/>existance.<br/>This has been my overall veiw of<br/>the middle east situation, and basically arab intolerance of any<br/>religion/culture but their own. This being said, however, the present<br/>Isrieli response is not much better. Even though the Arab attitude<br/>seemspretty negative at first, at least they are up fron about their<br/>negativity: -As oppression from a materialistic system can be just as<br/>bad<br/>as fundamentalist islamic regims like under the taliban. Oh, not for<br/>us<br/>in the US but in 3rd world countries and China and N Korea who&apos;s labor<br/>supplies the rich (much in the US). Along this line, I must point out<br/>that it seems that Isrial is oppressing the Palestinians economically.<br/>Isrial at this point seems willing to take any drastic action to<br/>stopthe<br/>suicide bombing terrorism. Yet they have been unwilling to do thething<br/>that would stop it -that is put a wall between themselves and the<br/>Palestinians and militarily patroll that wall to keep anyone from<br/>crossing. No, there are still checkpoints and Palestinians are still<br/>allowed to go in and out. Isrial doesn&apos;t care much about the economic<br/>lives of the average Palestinian as they put concrete barakades in<br/>Palestinian lands to make travel difficult within the Palestinian<br/>teritory for the average Palestinian, which does nothing against<br/>terrorism. Why do they still allow Palestinians into Isrial? The only<br/>reason I come up with is that they benefit economically from them and<br/>treat them basically as well treated but slave labor. They are<br/>oppressing<br/>them economically. This is not to say that the Palestinian&apos;s lot isn&apos;t<br/>improved and that they don&apos;t depend upon this relationship. Its just<br/>that<br/>Isrial benefits more, and is economically oppressing the Palestinians.<br/>Atthis point, I think it would be better for the Palestinians if there<br/>was a wall between the 2 peoples. Any benefit the Palestinians gain by<br/>working in Isrial, seems to be offset by Isrial&apos;s destructive<br/>incursions<br/>into Palestinian territory. Isrial is being the control freak now:<br/>-trying to hold onto economic oppression of the Palestinian people<br/>while<br/>trying to stamp out their retaliation for the hell that Isrial puts<br/>them<br/>through.<br/>Plus, Arabs may have reason for their intolerance of other cultures,<br/>due to the aggressive nature of some other cultures (like<br/>capitalism-Christianity) which seem to take over and replace<br/>othercultures.<br/> And the Arabs have come up with a way in which an oppressed people<br/>may<br/>share their oppression with their oppressors -the suicide bombing.<br/>Otherwise an oppressed people has little option but to sit there and<br/>take<br/>it: and although they are justified in retaliating in self defense<br/>against their oppressor, they are otherwise pretty ill equiped to do<br/>so<br/>-being put down by the oppression from their oppressor.<br/>As the islamic world has given us the new idea of (or new application<br/>of)<br/>the suicide bombing, which has validity in a limited number of<br/>situaitions ie only where an oppressor is oppressing one. (such as<br/>what<br/>seems to be occuring in the present Palestinian situation.) -As the<br/>Islamic world has given us a new idea, I return the favor with the new<br/>idea concerning how women can irradicate oppression directed against<br/>them. Since the Islamic world is one of the worst repressors against<br/>women; they are likely to be the most affected by this new idea. Well,<br/>here&apos;s to positive change and freedom from oppression.<br/>There is the saying what comes around goes around or what you sow you<br/>shall reap. But this has oftentimes been a joke. Throughout history<br/>thosegroups with an advantage in technological might have been able to<br/>stickit to those groups more primitive in technology, and the<br/>primitive<br/>groups have been forced to take it and have not been able to return<br/>the<br/>destruction done upon them back to their more technologically superior<br/>oppressors. So generally, it has not been true on earth that the<br/>destructiveness done by a technologically advanced group is returned<br/>to<br/>them. However, these advanced societies seem to make it a point to<br/>return<br/>the destruction which individuals do to society, back upon them (ie<br/>the<br/>concept of justice againsy crimminals). Perhaps because they view the<br/>individual as a technololgical primative (compared to the group as a<br/>whole).<br/>When the US wiped out the American indians, that was OK because they<br/>were<br/>primitives. When the Ausies wiped out the bushmen, that was OK because<br/>they were primatives. When the Russians under the tzar wiped out<br/>primitive fishing peoples on northern islands, that was OK because<br/>they<br/>were primitives. When Isrial cuts power and water lines; places<br/>concrete<br/>barriers,buldozes and shells Palestinian areas, that&apos;s OK, because<br/>that<br/>keeps the Palestinians more technologically primative and dependent on<br/>Isrial; so that its OK to go over and shoot a bunch every so often<br/>because they&apos;re more primitive. But unlike untold other primitive<br/>cultures, the Arabs are proving to be different. Now the rich and<br/>technologically advanced group (backed by US technology) is getting<br/>what<br/>it dishes out at the hands of a more technologically primitive<br/>culture.<br/>(The technology of explosives is fairly primitive for a governmental<br/>group, especially if one is unable to develop a delivery system other<br/>than delivery by a human suicide.) (Say, if the lives of the<br/>Palestinians<br/>were made worthwhile with suffering aleviated, I bet they wouldn&apos;t so<br/>readily commit suicide if their lives were more worth living. A little<br/>foriegn aid and development might work wonders here.)<br/>Technologically advanced societies have had a free hand dispensing<br/>destruction to lesser developed societies. Hey, that&apos;s not fair that<br/>thistechnologically more primitive society is holding its own against<br/>an<br/>advanced one. As of late, these technologically primitve societies<br/>have<br/>been fighting back. We technologically primiteve Americans outdid the<br/>more advanced British. Vietnam taught us a lesson concerning more<br/>technologically primitive societies. And now the Palestinians are<br/>showing<br/>that superior technological might and riches don&apos;t matter: what goes<br/>around DOES actually come around.<br/>The more technologically primitive Palestinians are inescapably caught<br/>in<br/>a destructive situation. That is basically a hell for them. And they<br/>are<br/>giving what they get via their suicide bombings, thus pulling their<br/>oppressors into that hell. One may argue one way or the other whether<br/>suicide bombing is right or OK or wrong or that it is an evil that<br/>needs<br/>to be stamped out. But whait I would like to point out is that this is<br/>irrelevent. What IS relevent is the concept that destruction and<br/> destructiveness is hell: that where there is destruction and<br/>destructiveness; that is hell. And that if we are able to avoid hell<br/>(or<br/>destructiveness), that that is the wise course. I guess my position on<br/>the Palestinian suicide bombing is that I understand it and that I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>think it is necessarily wrong. On the other hand, I don&apos;t think it is<br/>right either, due to the destructiveness involved. But I have no stake<br/>orinterest in seeing technologically advanced and rich societies do<br/>what<br/>they want to more technologically primitive societies and be able to<br/>getaway with it. And that just because the Palestinians have only<br/>rocks,<br/>while others have machine guns and tanks, doesn&apos;t make Palestinians<br/>inferior in my eyes nor having less rights. And just like when<br/>presidentBush tells a basically imprisoned Yasar Arafat that he could<br/>do more<br/>(insinuating that he is the cause of the violence in the middle east);<br/>I also realize that only those who are oppressed by an oppressor, have<br/>a<br/>right (of self defense) to retaliate -that by their retaliation, they<br/>are<br/>not initiating destructiveness, because destructiveness is already<br/>present by other actors, so that their retaliation (which contains<br/>destructiveness) often acts to end destruction, just like the justice<br/>system does destruction to criminals for the destruction that they<br/>originate, and thereby reduces the destruction ie destruction turned<br/>back on itself. If we gave them both big guns and let them fight it<br/>out in a<br/>controlled fashion, whereby all who didn&apos;t wish to be a part of this<br/>could leave the area and be safely separate from their foolishness,<br/>then<br/>it would all be over in short order and would not continue to fester<br/>on<br/>and on. Those who hate each other can kill each other; while those who<br/>renounce this foolishness will be able to leave this foolishness; and<br/>it will all be over.<br/>Just as Bush lays it on Arafat, I also lay it on Arafat that he and<br/>his people are the only ones with the right of retaliation for<br/>oppression<br/>done by Isreal (but realize that they are ill equiped to do so due to<br/>their more technologically primitive condition, just as Arafat is in a<br/>technologically primitive condition as a leader, being basically<br/>imprisoned); and of course that Isriel has right of retaliation for<br/>destruction originated by Palestine -but this right has already been<br/>approved and is not in question; but that it is only the Palestinians<br/>who<br/>are going to have trouble excersizing this right; just like oppressed<br/>peoples, because they are oppressed, they have trouble returning the<br/>destruction of their oppressor, due to being oppressed; or perhaps<br/>just<br/>because they are more technologically primitive;-but this conditionof<br/>technological primitivity is usually the result of outside oppression.<br/>Actually, those who are more technologically advanced need to set a<br/>better example and not be aggressors, because they have a choice here<br/>and<br/>are not forced into destruction and destructiveness, but if they<br/>choose<br/>destructiveness by choice anyway, they are the worst examples of an<br/>advanced society and are bound to destruction themselves, eventually.<br/>Just as Bush lays it on Arafat, I also lay it on Arafat that he has<br/>the<br/>right of retaliation that nobody else has, due to Isrieli oppression,<br/>and<br/>also recognize that the Palestinian people have been able to express<br/>that<br/>right through their suicide bombings, even though most technologically<br/>primitive people&apos;s have been unable to express this retaliation-self<br/>defense right that they have.<br/>But what I would like to point out is that this is irrelevent. That<br/>what<br/>is relevent is the concept that destruction is hell. -That if one is<br/>able, they should get away from and not be a part of destructive<br/>situations. The Palestinians are trapped and unable to get away from<br/>their destructive situation. Anyone who is able and technologically<br/>able,<br/>I recomend that they get away from this destructive situation. As for<br/>myself, I do not live in Palestine, and am not otherwise trapped by a<br/>destructive situation. So in this case, I choose to be away and not be<br/>a<br/>part of that destructive situation. So at this point, I will not be<br/>participating in or helping the Palestinians with their suicide<br/>bombings.<br/>My life is still worth living without being a suicide bomber or<br/>otherwise<br/>being involved in destructiveness. And I caution others against<br/>getting<br/>involved in these destructive situations under the reasoning of laying<br/>down international justice to try to irradicate suicide bombing<br/>because one feels it is wrong.<br/>With the trade center bombings; we had destruction thrust upon us and<br/>were trapped (in a destruction) and we were forced to go after Al<br/>Quada.<br/>We had no other choice. But I caution against going after other groups<br/>in<br/>the name of anti terrorism. Destruciton and destructiveness is a nasty<br/>thing; and where we can avoid it I would recomend that we do so. Of<br/>course, that is only my recomendation. Each must chose for themselves<br/>which path they will take. I just wish to point out and caution<br/>against<br/>being drawn into a destructive arena when we have a choice not to be<br/>drawn into a destructive arena and are not trapped into a destruction,<br/>under the reasoning that we are administering justice, or wiping out<br/>terrorism. I just want to point that out. People may choose to enter<br/>hell, but I just want that to be an informed decision. -To point out<br/>that<br/>destructiveness is not lightly entered into, especially if one has a<br/>chance/ is able to avoid it.<br/>Another thing I wish to point out is that high technology won&apos;t<br/>necessarily save us. -The trade center highjackers used boxcutters for<br/>goodness sake. -not a very technologically advanced weapon.<br/>Finally I wish to say that in the long run, I think the suicide<br/>bombings<br/>will backfire against Arab extremism. -with their extreme intolerance<br/>of<br/>other cultures/religions, they may themselves be the target of suicide<br/> bombings by those whose lives they have made too miserable to live.</p></div>
