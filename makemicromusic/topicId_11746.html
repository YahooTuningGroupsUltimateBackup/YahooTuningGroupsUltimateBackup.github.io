I can tell you that I have a few reasons why I do it: first, it&apos;s a real challenge to me as a musician, and I love to learn. Second, I am bored out of my wittle skull with the 12 tone system, and I realy want to see people start composing in other tunings...I want to hear unfamiliar sounds. And, I would hate to see any sort of standardized school/system develop around tuning, cause it&apos;s such a vast and unlimited field. We don&apos;t need any new standards, I&apos;d rather see people use tunings that fit the sort of music they want to play. The basic fundamentals of tuning theory, I feel, should be taught  to all students, on any instrument, from the very beginning... and then, they will have the mental chops to make their own decisions about what tuning/tunings to use. I am integrating tuning theory with many of my students, and am finding they really are interested. The main problem, as someone just said here, is that our music schools pretty much ignore the whole concept of tuning, so nobody even knows what it is...fix that, and I&apos;ve found a real interest with most of my students. One kid had a 24 tone guitar fretted, and a 15 year old girl wants to get a synth with non 12 tunings on it...she wants to play Bach in well temps, super cool.<br/>  Why tuning is ignored is beyond me...it&apos;s a fundamental part of any music, anywhere in the world, and if more musicians just knew there WERE options to 12 eq, the whole situation would change. And, I&apos;m doing what I can, through my students, recording, trying to get reviews (and write for mags, but boy that&apos;s tough going), and generally trying to spread the word that, hey, there&apos;s more to music than the 12 tone system. It&apos;s good fun, very challenging, but I also feel there are deep Universal correspondences between tuning  (sound/music) and the very structure of reality. And, that&apos;s a very ancient belief, one held by the Greeks, Indians, Arabs, Chinese, in fact every culture I&apos;ve looked at. There&apos;s some deep stuff to be discovered, and in the long run, that&apos;s what interests me the most now. When I first started (on 19 eq), it was a nice change from 12, and I could get some new things happening with blues/jazz/country, etc. But, after I started reading and studying in more depth, I realized that there is a deeper purpose to the way we tune our music, and I&apos;m still trying to see what&apos;s there.<br/>  And, I get emails constantly from folks who are just getting into tunings, and that&apos;s very encouraging. I do what I can to help, and I do see this movement getting larger by the week...a good sign.<br/>  Enough for now, best in 2006 to everyone...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>Chris Bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2006 2:27:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I absolutely agree that ignorance of tuning is largely an educational<br/>problem.

Some of the more promising ones include 12-ET with deviations in cents written above the notes, 72-ET, and Sagittal notation. The 12-ET notation with cents has its advantages, but isn&apos;t very practical for instruments that can play chords. Sagittal does 72-ET as well as existing 72-ET notations, plus it&apos;s good for many other ET&apos;s as well; its main disadvantage is the complexity of learning to use it correctly (especially for oddball temperaments or tunings without a single consistent JI interpretation, like some of the golden horogram scales). 72-ET isn&apos;t very precise, but it happens to be a good approximation of JI for its size, up to the 11 limit.</p><p>The situation is similar to character sets on a computer, with ISO 8859-1 as a superset of ASCII, and Unicode as a superset of ISO 8859-1.

The notation is not a mystical window into the true<br/>essence of the music or anything like that. It&apos;s just a mapping onto a set<br/>of 128 pitches and some temporal reference. The current system has the<br/>sole advantage that trained musicians can read it, and if their instrument<br/>is tuned to the intended system, will get the right pitches.</p><p>I would have to reject any microtonal music notation system that expands<br/>current systems by simply piling more symbols for tweaks-from-diatonic onto<br/>the current system of 5 lines.
