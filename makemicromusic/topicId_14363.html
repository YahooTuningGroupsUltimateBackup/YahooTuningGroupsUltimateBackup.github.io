Very briefly: I use python to read Scala tuning scales<br/>&gt; (Did I mention it&apos;s largely Just Intonation?). Then there&apos;s lots of<br/>&gt; sequence permutations which index pitch scales, intervals and rhythmic<br/>&gt; cells. While working: I generate lots of score files, and use a master<br/>&gt; score with numerous #include statements. That&apos;s pretty much the entire<br/>&gt; composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There will (should) be more... it is &apos;part I&apos; after all. I usually use<br/>&gt; Csound in every piece I write, but this is really the first<br/>&gt; Csound-only one. I have to admit... it takes some persistence to iron<br/>&gt; out the wrinkles, but, once you have the tools, and a working method,<br/>&gt; it gets easier.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Dave</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p></div><h3><a id=14364 href="#14364">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2006 8:59:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,</p><p>Thanks for posting links to this (courtesy of Dave S., I see).
