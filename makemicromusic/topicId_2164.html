Very, very good reading, I think.</p><p>[here&apos;s an edited blurb from their description of Ozone]:</p><p>It&apos;s a system of 64-bit DSP algorithms, complemented with enhanced visual meter displays, and integrated in an interface that makes it incredibly easy to get incredibly good masters.</p><p>- Four bands of multiband dynamics that carefully emulate the response of analog circuitry, providing natural-sounding compression, expansion, and limiting</p><p>- Real time visualization of the dynamics within each band</p><p>- Harmonic excitation based on analog tube saturation models. Multiband excitation with adjustable crossovers to add extended bass, sizzling highs, or anything in between</p><p>- Multiband parametric EQ with &quot;soft saturation&quot; modeling overlaid on an ultra fast spectrum display</p><p>- Top quality, studio reverb with control over room size, frequency cutoff, damping, and more</p><p>- Visualize the stereo image with a unique phase/channel meter display that highlights imaging, phase and potential canceling problems</p><p>- Adjust the width of the image with powerful stereo imaging controls including widening and multiband delays</p><p>- Push the level without overloading with a powerful yet transparent loudness maximizer</p><p>- Customize the processing order with a unique signal flow interface</p><p>- Track your tweaks and go back to previous settings with the click of a mouse</p><p>- Compare your mixes with a powerful spectrum analyzer that offers real time and average modes, snapshots, and more</p><p>I don&apos;t have huge and deep experience with DX or VST plugins for mixing, but I can say that this is one very nicely crafted piece of software, very musical and intuitive. I may pop for this one retail unless someone tells me I&apos;m crazy.</p><p>----------</p><p>And don&apos;t miss the opportunity to pick up their free &quot;Vinyl&quot; plugin, with goes in the opposite direction of all this stuff: you take a pristine digital file and then you can turn it into a scratchy old LP recording, with complete control over the hum, motor noise, rumble, scratches, dust, warp, and EQing from various eras!</p><p>I applied it to one of Bill Sethares &quot;pop-folk&quot; songs, and you could almost see the tie-dye cover on the album!</p><p>Music can be fun sometimes...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=2184 href="#2184">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 9:02:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

Reverb&apos;s one of those things that&apos;s very<br/>&gt; &gt;difficult to get perfect.  Did they?</p><p>Jon:<br/>&gt; Right, I understand. For 10 minutes work, it sounds fine. Consider how<br/>&gt; few hours, nay, *minutes*, of studio time in a well-stocked studio,<br/>&gt; with a good engineer, you would get for $200. You want better, you<br/>&gt; either start building up a studio, buy one of the dedicated reverb<br/>&gt; programs, or be happy with the charms of something better than what you<br/>&gt; have now.</p><p>I have Kyma now, which as some fairly good reverb sounds, although they<br/>take up a lot of the processors.  The really good ones need more<br/>processors than I have.  It&apos;d probably be for the convenience if I use<br/>this thing instead.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Is there any way of widening the field for headphones, to emulate<br/>&gt; speakers?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly enough, they mention headphones in their &quot;Mastering...&quot;<br/>&gt; document that I spoke of. And they spoke of the caveats. Frankly, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think anyone would want to do a mix that would be specifically<br/>&gt; for headphone listening (unless it is a binaural recording to start<br/>&gt; with). The image widening can certainly take it beyond... the norm.</p><p>The idea is to narrow (I think it&apos;s that way round) the image so that you<br/>can mix on headphones and it&apos;ll sound okay on speakers.  I downloaded a<br/>Kyma sound to do this, but never tried it out.</p><p>&gt; As for headphone listening and appropriate soundstage, I think it is<br/>&gt; more incumbent on the listener to work with this, as I wouldn&apos;t expect<br/>&gt; a live recording of an orchestra in a hall to be then mixed for<br/>&gt; headphones. As such, I use a gizmo called the &quot;HeadRoom Little&quot; -<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.headroom.com/">http://www.headroom.com/</a> - as a dedicated headphone amp. It is built<br/>&gt; around a processing circuitry that subtly cross-feeds signal with some<br/>&gt; damping (don&apos;t quote me) to eliminate the dead spot in the middle of<br/>&gt; your skull (this is only an audio application - the dead spot that<br/>&gt; produces my daily stupidities is still fully functional).</p><p>Thanks, I&apos;ll have a look at that.</p><p>In fact, this is a weird Shockwave toy.  Do you have another URL to hand?</p><p>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s only $200 which is remarkably good value if it works well.  And<br/>&gt; if it<br/>&gt; &gt;can do all that in real time in software it must be pretty darn good.<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt;can&apos;t spot anything that it&apos;s missing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I *was* running it in realtime, and you can turn the preview on and off<br/>&gt; to mute the effect. I&apos;m on a P4 1.2ghz with 512 ram, so lighter systems<br/>&gt; might balk, but the insane part is that these plugins utilize other<br/>&gt; DirectX libraries (graphics mostly, I would imagine) so the software<br/>&gt; itself is incredibly small.</p><p>One of the write-ups for Kyma says the basic system&apos;s equivalent to about<br/>1GHz of normal CPU.  So your machine&apos;s slightly more powerful than my<br/>Kyma, although it has to run an OS as well.  I don&apos;t think any two of<br/>realistic reverb, multi band compressor and enhancer can run together on<br/>my system.  But there is a penalty for it being a general-purpose system.</p><p>&gt; I would suggest checking out the 90 free trial of Samplitude, which is<br/>&gt; *certainly* about the nicest virtual mixing studios I&apos;ve seen. Works<br/>&gt; like a charm integated right into the mixing desk. So you can work with<br/>&gt; it in a DAW program like this or ProTools, or you can use it simply to<br/>&gt; process a single stereo wave file in an audio editor like Sound Forge<br/>&gt; or CoolEdit.</p><p>I&apos;ll have a look at that.  I&apos;m using Goldwave now for editing, because<br/>it&apos;s a faster download than CoolEdit.</p><p>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s a WinAmp plugin as well as the DX one, so you can apply it to<br/>&gt; &gt;anything you download.  In fact, that has a semi-serious use, because<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve &gt;found (with Blade, I haven&apos;t tried with Lame) that wide band<br/>&gt; noise &gt;compresses very badly to MP3.  So this is a perfect tool for<br/>&gt; correcting that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, it&apos;s an item to *add* noise! To recreate the days of actual<br/>&gt; &apos;records&apos; that have been abused, scratched, and played at more parties<br/>&gt; than you can remember!</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s what I meant.  You have to remove the noise for it to compress<br/>right, so this adds it back in.  I do write this not far from Bristol.<br/>Perhaps it&apos;s a strange desire in the rest of the world.</p><p>&gt; If we free up some space on <a href="http://microtonal.org">microtonal.org</a> I&apos;ll upload that clip of<br/>&gt; Bill&apos;s I did.</p><p>That&apos;d be good.  I downloaded the WinAmp plugin, and then remembered I<br/>don&apos;t use WinAmp on this machine :(</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3><a id=2198 href="#2198">ðŸ”—</a>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 7:42:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I installed it, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be doing anything in Sound<br/>&gt; &gt; Forge.... ??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Balls.
