The<br/>timbres are, of course, amazing.</p><p>Although I enjoy the piece as it stands, I would like to also hear<br/>an &quot;alternate&quot; version, where the opening premise becomes *more*<br/>abstract rather than *less* (I guess I mean *pop*).  That being the<br/>case, I believe the piece could be every bit as good is some of our<br/>present electronic &quot;masters&quot; such as Paul Lansky, etc., etc.</p><p>That&apos;s just *me.*  Maybe Bill doesn&apos;t want to do that, which is fine,<br/>too.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
