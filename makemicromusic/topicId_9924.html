I<br/>don&apos;t have to write for particular instrumental sounds anymore:  I<br/>just make my own!  Sounds are so much more suitable to the structures<br/>of a composition.  And, additionally, one doesn&apos;t have to deal with<br/>fickle performers who don&apos;t want to do contemporary music and<br/>microtonality in the first place!  :)  This is a great tool.</p><p>I still have one complaint about the Blackjack tuning system.  I know<br/>the inventors are going to jump all over me for this, but I say this<br/>as somebody who has had some experience (like 30 years) composing<br/>about every day and trying to do creative projects:  Blackjack is not<br/>entirely an *aural* scale but is, to a certain degree, a<br/>*theoretical* one.</p><p>In other words, because the small steps are only 33 cents apart and<br/>there are frequently two that can be part of a consonant triad (one<br/>is a *wrong* one and the other one the &quot;correct&quot; just one) it&apos;s<br/>possible to make &quot;mistakes&quot; that later have to be corrected in a<br/>theoretical appraisal.  That is not an entirely aural process.  You<br/>can say what you will.  It&apos;s not entirely aural in the way that some<br/>other scales are aural, including 12-tET.  One *knows* when<br/>the &quot;wrong&quot; note is played immediately.  They are distinct enough in<br/>terms of distance.</p><p>However, Blackjack has so many other attractive qualities, including<br/>the extreme notational ease, that I suppose this is just a quibble...<br/>but here I am quibbling... :)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p><p>P.S. Hope to be more involved in the lists again soon.  Out for<br/>various reasons too mundane to recount.</p></div><h3><a id=9925 href="#9925">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2005 4:43:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I&apos;m really feeling that the combination of Sonar with the z3ta+ microtonal &gt;softsynth gives a since of limitless possibilities!  ...
