I<br/>sampled that with my computer DA converter and rcorded it using<br/>TotalRecorder.  LAME was the MP3 encoder.</p><p>The pieces I&apos;m writing for 19ET will be for either 1 or 2 keyboards<br/>and are meant to be human-playable with a computer and soundfonts or<br/>sampler or synth and external 76 key MIDI keyboard.</p><p>With ubiquitous softsynths and samplers now, I don&apos;t see any reason<br/>that tunings need to be held as a kind of compositional paradigm<br/>barrier to live performance.  (Yeah, I know I&apos;m speaking to the choir<br/>here!).</p><p>Joe thanks for the comments, I&apos;m writing a big new electronic piece<br/>for 19ET too and will utilize the similar patches (but in a diverse<br/>orchestral setting) as Jardin (electronic piano, bells) and<br/>Lamentation (glass harmonica) and Espace (gongs).</p><p>Your encouragement to composers is always brilliant!</p><p>jeff harrington<br/><a href="http://jeffharrington.org">http://jeffharrington.org</a> - new music<br/><a href="http://netnewmusic.net">http://netnewmusic.net</a> - new music portal<br/><a href="http://beepsnort.org">http://beepsnort.org</a> - new music blog</p></div><h3><a id=7445 href="#7445">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

How is it implemented, etc.? What techniques does it<br/>&apos;know&apos;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I wrote in in Amiga C back in 1991 and ported it to Java back 2 years<br/>ago.  It takes a MIDI file and for a 3 track file it creates 3<br/>notelists in memory.  It then compares track 1 and 2 by delaying and<br/>transposing track 2 and comparing each note according to the<br/>granularity specified in the arguments to the app.  It&apos;s loosely based<br/>on Tanieev&apos;s book Convertible Counterpoint.  Once it finds a<br/>combinataion that meets the rulebase it adds it to a list.  The next<br/>step is to match those combinations in the list of 2 voice<br/>combinations with delayed and trasposed track 3.  It then writes the 2<br/>voice and 3 voice combinations it&apos;s found out as MIDI files.</p><p>I can be running it while I listen to the results in Sibelius.  Most<br/>of my pieces since 1991 have used it.  The rulebase I usually use is<br/>to accept combinations of 3rd&apos;s, 4th&apos;s, 5th&apos;s and 6th&apos;s and if it<br/>finds a second or a seventh to look ahead (given as an argument) to<br/>see if the next note is a 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th.  It&apos;s a little more<br/>sophisticated than that...</p><p>For 19ET I&apos;m using:</p><p>// DISSONANCE 1 2 4 7 9 10 12 15 17 18<br/>// CONSONANCE 0 3 5 6 8 11 13 14 16</p><p>So I can add that great flat 7th and that nice 2nd to the consonance<br/>list.  It produces a bit more dissonant counterpoint than my usual<br/>rulebase for 12ET, but I think it&apos;ll be useful.</p><p>Here&apos;s a few canons it produced when I was working on my 2 piano piece<br/> in 19ET.</p><p><a href="http://parnasse.com/mp3/piano19-counterpoint-harrington.mp3">http://parnasse.com/mp3/piano19-counterpoint-harrington.mp3</a></p><p>jeff harrington<br/><a href="http://jeffharrington.org">http://jeffharrington.org</a> - new music<br/><a href="http://netnewmusic.net">http://netnewmusic.net</a> - new music portal<br/><a href="http://beepsnort.org">http://beepsnort.org</a> - new music blog</p></div><h3><a id=7450 href="#7450">ðŸ”—</a>idealordid &#x3C;jeff@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2004 11:19:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot;<br/>&lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;idealordid&quot; &lt;jeff@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Well, regardless of how hard it would be (and I absolutely think<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re right) for performers it would be next to impossible to<br/>&gt; &gt; remember that note X maps to note Y on a standard keyboard.

So the first octave is the G an octave and 7 above. &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think that setting up &quot;traditional&quot; 19-tET notation with separate<br/>&gt; &gt; enharmonics might be a challenge for Sibelius as the other<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, regardless of how hard it would be (and I absolutely think<br/>&gt; you&apos;re right) for performers it would be next to impossible to<br/>&gt; remember that note X maps to note Y on a standard keyboard.

For that matter, since the piece does not use the whole set of 19 tones (actually, it only uses the seven natural diatonic tones plus f#), you could just map 12 out of 19 and play it straight through on an everyday 12tet keyboard.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=7459 href="#7459">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2004 3:43:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;idealordid&quot; &lt;jeff@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It was by ear.

The mediant of 10/9 and 9/8 is 19/17, and that is pretty<br/>close to 3 steps of 19-et, though 81-et, another meantone system,<br/>pretty well nails it if that is what you are really grooving on.<br/>However, that is speculative--have you tried various tunings of this<br/>interval and found where the sweet spot for you lies?</p><p>If the meantone of a meantone system is exactly 19/17, then two fifths<br/>are 38/17 and the meantone fifth is sqrt(38/17), which is 696.279<br/>cents. This is right in an optimal meantone (my &quot;poptimal&quot;) range for<br/>meantone.

Most<br/>&gt; of my pieces since 1991 have used it.  The rulebase I usually use is<br/>&gt; to accept combinations of 3rd&apos;s, 4th&apos;s, 5th&apos;s and 6th&apos;s and if it<br/>&gt; finds a second or a seventh to look ahead (given as an argument) to<br/>&gt; see if the next note is a 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th.  It&apos;s a little more<br/>&gt; sophisticated than that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For 19ET I&apos;m using:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; // DISSONANCE 1 2 4 7 9 10 12 15 17 18<br/>&gt; // CONSONANCE 0 3 5 6 8 11 13 14 16<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I can add that great flat 7th and that nice 2nd to the consonance<br/>&gt; list.

How is it implemented, etc.? What techniques does it<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;know&apos;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I wrote in in Amiga C back in 1991 and ported it to Java back 2 years<br/>&gt; &gt; ago.  It takes a MIDI file and for a 3 track file it creates 3<br/>&gt; &gt; notelists in memory.  It then compares track 1 and 2 by delaying and<br/>&gt; &gt; transposing track 2 and comparing each note according to the<br/>&gt; &gt; granularity specified in the arguments to the app.  It&apos;s loosely based<br/>&gt; &gt; on Tanieev&apos;s book Convertible Counterpoint.  Once it finds a<br/>&gt; &gt; combinataion that meets the rulebase it adds it to a list.  The next<br/>&gt; &gt; step is to match those combinations in the list of 2 voice<br/>&gt; &gt; combinations with delayed and trasposed track 3.  It then writes the 2<br/>&gt; &gt; voice and 3 voice combinations it&apos;s found out as MIDI files.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but does this algorithm bear any<br/>resemblance to the<br/>&gt; one used for the ILIAC suite by Hiller and Issacson? It sound sort<br/>of like a<br/>&gt; &apos;rule-based sieve&apos; approach.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Exactly, with the search space being all of the possible delays and<br/>transpositions of the 3 tracks.  FWIW, I&apos;ve had it up to 6 tracks - on<br/>my Amiga, but I haven&apos;t ported that to Java yet.</p><p>&gt; This stuff fascinates me!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can be running it while I listen to the results in Sibelius.  Most<br/>&gt; &gt; of my pieces since 1991 have used it.  The rulebase I usually use is<br/>&gt; &gt; to accept combinations of 3rd&apos;s, 4th&apos;s, 5th&apos;s and 6th&apos;s and if it<br/>&gt; &gt; finds a second or a seventh to look ahead (given as an argument) to<br/>&gt; &gt; see if the next note is a 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th.  It&apos;s a little more<br/>&gt; &gt; sophisticated than that...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For 19ET I&apos;m using:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; // DISSONANCE 1 2 4 7 9 10 12 15 17 18<br/>&gt; &gt; // CONSONANCE 0 3 5 6 8 11 13 14 16<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So I can add that great flat 7th and that nice 2nd to the consonance<br/>&gt; &gt; list.  It produces a bit more dissonant counterpoint than my usual<br/>&gt; &gt; rulebase for 12ET, but I think it&apos;ll be useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I read you correctly, you prefer the 16th step of 19 to the 15th<br/>step of 19<br/>&gt; (which I prefer, finding it more &apos;blue-notey&apos;). I find it rather more<br/>&gt; consonant than it&apos;s inversion, last time I checked, but even then,<br/>I&apos;ve more<br/>&gt; used its effect (in my piece &apos;The Juggler&apos;) more as a passing tone,<br/>whereas I<br/>&gt; find terraced modulation by both 4 of 19 steps, and it&apos;s inversion,<br/>5 of 19<br/>&gt; steps, to be absolutely delightful.

While they certainly decay<br/>faster than say a piano, I think they have enough sustain, and a rich enough<br/>and quite regular overtone structure to hear *any* tuning well enough that<br/>for that very reason, I use a harpsichord patch by default to explore any<br/>tuning or temperament (at least tunings/temperaments that are based on<br/>7-limit-or-below intervals---e.g. 7-eq I think sounds horrible with a bright<br/>timbre like a harpsichord).</p><p>I do think the criticism of Partch is valid in the realm of quick decay<br/>percussion (marimbas, etc.) I miss the &apos;raison d&apos;etre&apos; of JI in much of<br/>Partch&apos;s textures.

And if you were<br/>doing<br/>&gt; &gt; anything  different, you wouldn&apos;t be here.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Ok... but you do realize that you&apos;re arguing about something<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; completely subjective, right?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why argue about  objective things?  What possible benefit might arise<br/>&gt; from settling a  discussion about things that can be proven or<br/>&gt; disproven?  That&apos;s  what dictionaries and encyclopediae are fo!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.  When it comes to personal preference, I have a problem with<br/> name<br/>&gt; calling and I&apos;d like to respectfully request that future arguments<br/>be  carried on<br/>&gt; without insult.  I would also like to request that an apology  be<br/>offered to<br/>&gt; the so-called &quot;weenies and geeks&quot; that have had their  feelings<br/>hurt.  It<br/>&gt; would be much appreciated.</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t apologize for my ad hominem comments.  I find a little<br/>provocation thusly without personal insult and attack can lead to a<br/>bit more passion in our discussion.  I wouldn&apos;t even call it an<br/>argument so far.  So there...</p><p>You got some music?</p><p>jeff harrington<br/><a href="http://jeffharrington.org">http://jeffharrington.org</a> - new music<br/><a href="http://netnewmusic.net">http://netnewmusic.net</a> - new music portal<br/><a href="http://beepsnort.org">http://beepsnort.org</a> - new music blog</p></div><h3><a id=7518 href="#7518">ðŸ”—</a>rick@...</h3><span>9/16/2004 11:24:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmmm... Speaking only for myself... I haven&apos;t really seen anyone on this<br/>list who seems to be purposely and *trying* to start a fight...

It&apos;s a head-turner or &quot;ear bender...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course JP, Blackjack is a tempered scale, at least the form<br/>&gt; you use.  No?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>***Well, yes, but even *this* is subject to some dispute since if the<br/>performer is told to actually *perform* just or unbeating in the<br/>vertical direction, then it becomes a kind of &quot;adaptive just&quot; a la<br/>Vicintino... i.e. tempered in the *horizontal* dimension only...</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=7524 href="#7524">ðŸ”—</a>ZipZapPooZoo &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2004 7:32:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;m not using it because it is &apos;just&apos; or &apos;perfectly in tune&apos;.
