If you can read python, it shouldn&apos;t be to hard to understand, although it might help beforehand to understand something of microcsound syntax in order to fully understand it. <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/microcsound_tutorial.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/microcsound_tutorial.html</a> will help you there.</p><p>The format of a isoserial file is 4 Python arrays, separated by newlines, plus a fifth line containing a single number which is the number of total note events to generate. You can see an example at <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/software/souvlaki_butt_shake.isoparams">http://www.akjmusic.com/software/souvlaki_butt_shake.isoparams</a></p><p>I tried some examples with randomly generated arrays, and I was disappointed with the results. Too &quot;random&quot; :).... The &quot;souvlaki&quot; example does much better, I feel, because I have non-random patterns like scalar passages and little pitch motifs in their own arrays, and then used the Python random choose function to concatenate them together randomly, like a Stravinsky &apos;cut and paste&apos;. A very simple, naive, way of getting both order and surprise. Baby steps. Next might be sophisticated Markov chains....</p><p>So my steps were:</p><p>1) open a python terminal and create some empty arrays for each parameter: pitch, duration, attack, articulation; and also an array of arrays, each being a &apos;motif&apos; if you will.</p><p>2) call the Python &apos;random.choice&apos; function in a loop on the master array of arrays. Each loop extends the blank array (adds values w/o having an additional array boundary, so I can cut n&apos; paste later)</p><p>3) Cut and paste these into an &apos;isoparameter&apos; file.</p><p>4) run the &apos;<a href="http://isoserial.py">isoserial.py</a>&apos; script on the isoparameter file, piping the output of *that* into a microcsound text file.</p><p>5) edit the microcsound text file by defining instrument, track, and tuning parameters. Add some simple repeating drum track to frame a beat structure.</p><p>6) run microcsound to produce a wav file output.</p><p>It&apos;s algorithmic, so it won&apos;t be as rich as a human composer, but I think it&apos;s kind of a fun exercise to find algorithms that have a certain richness that can come close to human design, or be different than human design entirely, but have its own compelling sound.</p><p>Right now, this script is *very* naively monophonic--I haven&apos;t developed any such algorithm that extends into the harmonic domain, but I think with a *lot* more code, something might be developed. Right now, it&apos;s good enough for quasi-maqamish/ragaish stuff, like Ozan noticed. One could try devil-may-care counterpoint, see if you like it, and edit any clashes one doesn&apos;t like out....At that point, the amount of work involved probably exceeds by orders of magnitude the amount of work simply writing something in 3- or 4-part harmony, say, so I guess I wouldn&apos;t tend to want to do it....you might even say the work I went through to write something monophonic took longer than writing my own melody line. Probaby true, but if you ever write something that has a certain algorithmic design anyway, a script like this helps.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AKJ</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2011 9:27:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You can get microcsound at <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/packages/microcsound20101231.tgz">http://www.akjmusic.com/packages/microcsound20101231.tgz</a></p><p>Did you ever consider working with Scala seq files?</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2011 9:34:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My take on this - interesting tuning.

Scala &apos;seq&apos; format was utterly unsuiable for large projects with harmony and esp. counterpoint, b/c it&apos;s vertical, and you can&apos;t see how things line up in time. So I developed &apos;et_compose&apos; which became &apos;microcomposer&apos; which became &apos;microcsound&apos; when I pretty much dropped MIDI functionality. When I use MIDI, I tend to stick with tuning tables anymore, so if it&apos;s text based, I prefer Csound for it&apos;s generality and flexibility. It&apos;s nice to not have to work around pitch bends, but on the other hand, you are giving up on a certain immediacy by not having MIDI keyboard expression when you go a text/algorithm route. Fortunately, Csound has both options, as its MIDI functionality is all-encompassing. You have to squeeze and experiment with certain parameters to get decent RT performance, though, and some instruments, esp. physical modelling ones, will cause buffer under-runs when used RT with too much polyphony.</p><p>Prent gets great results from Csound, agreed. He pretty much limits it&apos;s use to a general purpose sample-engine; in that regard a lot of what you may like is both what he does compositionally, and how well he&apos;s put together the whole sample system.
