Now when I listen to it it seems to repeat every seven<br/>&gt; &gt; chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are correct. I was hoping more people would listen before this<br/>&gt; was revealed. Oh well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason, I believe, that both you and Joseph Pehrson heard this<br/>&gt; progression as non-repeating, is 12-tET conditioning. If you<br/>&gt; approximated these chords in 12-tET, and observed all the common<br/>&gt; tones, the progression would end up drifting a semitone every seven<br/>&gt; chords. So in a sense, your ear doesn&apos;t immediately recognize the<br/>&gt; chord progression, since it&apos;s trying to interpret it within a 12-tET<br/>&gt; grid. Although the pitch level is the same after every seven chords,<br/>&gt; your ear is a bit confused because the intervals have carried you to<br/>&gt; a place that &quot;should&quot; be different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the chords were exact 7-limit JI tetrads, the chord progression<br/>&gt; would drift by the ratio of 2401:2400 every seven chords. This is<br/>&gt; less than 1 cent, but is represented by 100 cents in 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sounds close to 31tet, sort of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now your familiarity with 31-tET may be kicking in -- 2401:2400 does<br/>&gt; vanish in 31-tET (as it does in 72-tET, the tuning this was actually<br/>&gt; in), so this chord progression would &quot;work&quot; in 31-tET. Also, 31-tET<br/>&gt; has the best approximations of 7-limit tetrads of any ET with fewer<br/>&gt; than 68 notes per octave -- but 72-tET is twice as good.</p><p>Paul, your analysis of Graham&apos;s progression is brilliant.  Thanks.<br/>I&apos;ve noticed exactly this phenomenon you describe, along with John<br/>and Joe P., and kind of shrugged it off because I really didn&apos;t<br/>understand what was happening.  Now you&apos;ve enabled me to understand<br/>*why* I heard it.</p><p>Thanks also for the acknowledgement of my contributions to this<br/>sound-file, which you&apos;ve repeated many times to various people.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
