He has made some fascinating mods to classic electronic music machines, including the Yamaha DX7 and his &quot;Devilfish&quot; mods to the Roland TB-303.

But when we&apos;re talking about the &quot;electronic&quot; age, 3.5 years is a *long* time, and that is the last update to his page. I hope he&apos;ll revisit the topic and address some of the developments that have occurred - technologically and culturally - since Oct. 2002.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
