In a now<br/>famous column, Martin Gardner showed that common melodies are<br/>statistically closer to some noise functions than others.  These<br/>noise functions were subsequently used to produce melodies.<br/>Fractals are another obvious source of nice patterns.  The results<br/>are often interesting but these equations don&apos;t capture anything<br/>deep about what we listen for in music in my opinion.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=19092 href="#19092">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 9:58:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; On Sat, Jun 21, 2008 at 5:36 AM, robert thomas martin<br/>&gt; &lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Is there a connection?

Can they be adapted to microtonality?</p><p>Good question!</p><p>No, rational number ratios are not nearly as important to<br/>electromagnetic waves as they are to acoustic waves, and I&apos;ll tell you<br/>exactly why.</p><p>Mathematicians and physicists have a concept called a &quot;linear system&quot;.<br/>In a linear system, you can put in two different inputs at the same<br/>time and the output is simply the combination of the outputs you would<br/>get from each input alone. The two inputs don&apos;t interfere with each<br/>other; they&apos;re independent. If f is a linear function, then f(a + b) =<br/>f(a) + f(b).</p><p>Most acoustic systems are essentially nonlinear. That is, if I play<br/>two sine waves at one end of a room, and you listen at the other end<br/>of the room, you will hear not only the two original pitches, but also<br/>difference tones (and harmonics) that are generated spontaneously.<br/>This happens because the acoustic response of the room is nonlinear.<br/>This nonlinearity makes most intervals beat, and the only intervals<br/>that don&apos;t beat are simple rational numbers.</p><p>On the other hand, the propagation of light through a material like<br/>air or glass is extremely close to being perfectly linear. (The<br/>technical reason for this is that air and glass are almost perfectly<br/>linear dielectric media.) If I shine a red laser and a blue laser<br/>through the same space, they come out as the same red and blue<br/>wavelengths, and they don&apos;t generate any other wavelengths like green.<br/>(The combination will appear purple, because that&apos;s just how your eyes<br/>see a mixture of red and blue.) In particular, there can be no<br/>&quot;beating&quot; or interference patterns generated by different wavelengths.<br/>Therefore rational and irrational ratios of wavelengths don&apos;t act any<br/>different in practice.</p><p>That said, there are certain materials, called nonlinear optical<br/>crystals, that have enough nonlinearity that if you shine very intense<br/>laser beams into them, you can observe nonlinear effects like<br/>difference frequencies and low-order harmonics (see<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_harmonic_generation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_harmonic_generation</a> ). But as Carl<br/>Lumma just pointed out, the human visual range is less than an<br/>&quot;octave&quot;, so if you can see the fundamental, you can&apos;t see the second<br/>harmonic, and vice versa. Similarly, if you use two input lasers, both<br/>in the visible range, then their difference frequency will be<br/>invisible. So even with these exotic nonlinear materials, there&apos;s no<br/>practical way to see nonlinear optical effects with your eyes (other<br/>than simple beating, and even that may be impossible in practice).</p><p>On Sat, Jun 21, 2008 at 3:48 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I remember a while ago I tried to create a &quot;major triad&quot; with colors -<br/>&gt; I found colors that were 3/2 and 5/4 the frequency of other colors.

In order to have<br/>any hope of seeing nonlinear effects, the light waves must propagate<br/>through the same region of space. Also, as I said, you need a<br/>nonlinear optical crystal to observe anything. Plus, if you want to<br/>actually see any beating with that 3/2 ratio, you need to tune your<br/>lasers extremely carefully. The frequency of visible light is on the<br/>order of 10^14 Hz, so if you want to see the beating your lasers have<br/>to be tuned to one part in 10^13 or so. That&apos;s about 10^-10 cents, or<br/>less than a billionth of a cent!</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19094 href="#19094">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 10:00:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes.....</p><p>math levels it all as long as it doesn&apos;t depend on the properties of<br/>photons.</p><p>On Sat, Jun 21, 2008 at 5:36 AM, robert thomas martin &lt;<br/>robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Is there a connection?
