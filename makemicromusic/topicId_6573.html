So, if the pitch<br/>bend range of your synth can&apos;t be altered then the pitch-bends will be<br/>wrong.  But the range I set my bends to was 1 semitone, so the range<br/>divides 200 cents into 128 parts, and bend 127 up does /not/ bend up by<br/>a semitone, but just short of it (63.5/64 of it to be precise, this is<br/>due to the asymmetry of the range)</p><p>Pich bends are only 14 bits in all. but All SC88 can alter is the MS<br/>bits. But I can alter the pb range, so I do. If your synth doesn&apos;t do<br/>this then your synth isn&apos;t compliant with the standard. My synth<br/>doesn&apos;t comply because it doesn&apos;t recognise the lower 7 bits, well not<br/>to my ear.</p><p>That&apos;s all folks.</p><p>Mark</p><p>On Monday, May 10, 2004, at 05:52  am, <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Philippe</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
