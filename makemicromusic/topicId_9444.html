It is based on four chords in<br/>the Partch Tonality Diamond: F 4/3 minor; A 8/5 major; C 1/1 major;<br/>and A 5/3 minor. There are many notes in common between these scales,<br/>and many more that are only slightly different. The subduction takes<br/>place where the differences lie.</p><p>This piece exploits the challenging ratios between many of the notes<br/>in the four scales. Here is a chart that summarizes these differences:</p><p>Movement of notes</p><p>   F minor;   bend;   A major<br/>1  F 4 /3;    9 :10   5 E 6 /5<br/>2  G 16/11;   77:80   6 G 7 /5<br/>3  A 8 /5;    1 :1;   1 A 8 /5<br/>4  B 16/9;    81:80   2 B 9 /5<br/>5  C 1 /1;    1 :1;   3 C 1 /1<br/>6  D 8 /7;    77:80   4 D 11/10</p><p>In this chart, the second degree of the F 4/3 minor scale, G 16/11,<br/>has to drop down by a 77:80 to reach the 6th degree of the A 8/5 major<br/>scale, which is G 7/5. That&apos;s about 1/2 of the normal 12 tone<br/>semi-tone. The movement from the 4th degree of the F 4/3 minor scale,<br/>B 16/9 to the 2nd degree of the A 8/5 major scale, B 9/5 is much<br/>smaller. It&apos;s a movement of an 81:80, nearly imperceptible. The<br/>thematic material is about how those changes come about, at the<br/>margins of the chord changes, the tectonic plates in the analogy to<br/>geological processes. There are similar charts moving from A 8/5 major<br/>to C 1/1 major, and then to A 5/3 minor.</p><p>I had a lot of fun with the glides within the scales as well. There<br/>are movements from one scale degree to another, up and down. The<br/>guitar, flutes, clarinets, and finger pianos move often from the 1,3,5<br/>degrees to the 2,4,6 degrees. Triads made of the 1,3,5 sound like<br/>typical minor or major chords. The 2,4,6, sound pretty far out. The<br/>tension is in the movement from one to the other.</p><p>I also exploit 4 note chords based on scale degrees 1,4,6,3 or 2,5,1,4<br/>or others. These sound more like typical fourth based harmonies rather<br/>than the triadic 1,3,5 and 2,4,6.</p><p>I also played around with trills, from one scale degree to the other.</p><p>The finger piano is made from samples taken from an instrument I built<br/>many years ago, consisting of spring steel tongues tuned with little<br/>bits of solder to ensure the overtones are in tune with the<br/>fundamental. The sounds are picked up with hand wound magnetic<br/>transducers.</p><p>The marimba plays either single notes or rolls on chords, but very<br/>fast rolls that sound more like bamboo gamelan instruments than a<br/>traditional marimba.</p><p>Plate tectonics - the basics</p><p>Lithospheric plates.

These sound more like typical fourth based harmonies rather<br/>&gt; than the triadic 1,3,5 and 2,4,6.<br/>&gt; &gt; I also played around with trills, from one scale degree to the other.<br/>&gt; &gt; The finger piano is made from samples taken from an instrument I built<br/>&gt; many years ago, consisting of spring steel tongues tuned with little<br/>&gt; bits of solder to ensure the overtones are in tune with the<br/>&gt; fundamental. The sounds are picked up with hand wound magnetic<br/>&gt; transducers.<br/>&gt; &gt; The marimba plays either single notes or rolls on chords, but very<br/>&gt; fast rolls that sound more like bamboo gamelan instruments than a<br/>&gt; traditional marimba.<br/>&gt; &gt; Plate tectonics - the basics<br/>&gt; &gt; Lithospheric plates. The uppermost part of the Earth is subdivided<br/>&gt; into a small number of rigid plates which comprise about 85% of the<br/>&gt; surface. In places these are separated by non-rigid (deforming) zones.<br/>&gt; Elsewhere plate boundaries of three types exist: divergent or<br/>&gt; spreading (e.g., mid-oceanic ridges), convergent (e.g., subduction<br/>&gt; zones), and strike-slip (e.g., the San Andreas fault zone in<br/>&gt; California or oceanic transform faults).<br/>&gt; &gt; Volcanism commonly is associated with the first two types of margins.<br/>&gt; An example of the first type is the currently active Axial Seamount<br/>&gt; which lies on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the coast of Washington.<br/>&gt; Convergent margin volcanism produces the &apos;ring of fire&apos; around the<br/>&gt; Pacific ocean, and is typified by the Cascade volcanic arc in the<br/>&gt; Pacific Northwest US.<br/>&gt; &gt; Convergent margins are among the world&apos;s most seismogenic zones, and<br/>&gt; are characterized by progressively deeper earthquakes as one proceeds<br/>&gt; from trench to back-arc region - at most convergent margins, these<br/>&gt; earthquake foci define a dipping plane (the Wadati-Benioff zone, or<br/>&gt; WBZ) which corresponds to a fault zone between subducting oceanic<br/>&gt; lithosphere and the overriding plate. Such zones are characterized by<br/>&gt; chains of trench-parallel volcanoes (volcanic arcs) fed by magmas<br/>&gt; rising from depths of up to ~100 km.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t pretend to know what all that stuff is about, but my uncle<br/>&gt; John wrote the book, and I like the idea of massive movements of rock<br/>&gt; turned into chord changes.<br/>&gt; &gt; Prent Rodgers<br/>&gt; Music that&apos;s Fake but Accurate<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Yahoo!

I am at the moment listening to Prent&apos;s<br/>piece and shall comment.</p><p>Actually, I listened to The Downwinders and another piece and a half<br/>on the Soundclick site, to refresh my memory of Prent&apos;s sound /<br/>style / approach and then to hear The Downwinders again in that<br/>context. I think I can see ... er, hear ... the point that Aaron and<br/>Jon are making.</p><p>I am a person who does not find mechanistic-sounding pieces to be<br/>necessarily a bad thing. Having toyed with software that permitted<br/>one to set parameters, push the Go button and see what happened OR<br/>to make a 100% human brain powered decision about everything that<br/>happens from one instant to the next, and to take an infiinite<br/>variety of intermediate approaches, I can say that some of the<br/>pieces that I created with that software which I enjoyed the most<br/>were those that leaned toward the former extreme. I would generate<br/>material, select results that I liked, and juxtapose them in various<br/>ways. Sometimes I would enjoy a fairly long sequence that was<br/>produced entirely algorithmically and would dub it &quot;a piece&quot; without<br/>alteration.</p><p>I suppose that I have had enough experience in that area to<br/>appreciate Prent&apos;s descriptions of the varying degrees of scripting<br/>versus indeterminacy in pieces. Maybe my point is that what sounds<br/>mechanistic may be deliberatey composed to sound that way, and what<br/>sounds organic may be generated by an algorithm that produces<br/>results that sound more like the results of a series of deliberate<br/>human choices. Anyway, I think one feels that &quot;I composed this music<br/>with the help of my computer and a chosen set of algorithms&quot; ... not<br/>the other way around! (I am not saying that this is in fact the<br/>case, but that the human participant surmises that it is so. Who<br/>knows what that crafty e-life is up to?)</p><p>This piece has plenty of nice JI harmonies, an interesting blend of<br/>timbres, and lots of variety while maintaining a strong overall<br/>consistency.</p><p>From a personal perspepctive, I feel it&apos;s rather unfair to listen to<br/>a piece of serious music once or twice and say, &quot;Oh, I liked that<br/>one right away,&quot; or &quot;Sorry, no can grok.&quot; I listened to Partch&apos;s<br/>Delusion of the Fury daily for about a year before I felt that it<br/>had revealed most of its mysteries to me - and in the process it<br/>morphed in my perception from interesting but very forbidding /<br/>somewhat off-putting to interesting and thoroughly inviting, like<br/>visiting with one&apos;s quite eccentric but very dear long-time<br/>friend. :) This music is not like the latest destined-to-be-a-hit<br/>song by a currently hot country / rock / techno / hiphop / whatever<br/>artist. If I had the time these days, I think I would do well to<br/>listen to a piece like The Downwinders at least once per day for a<br/>while, and see if it becomes &quot;my favorite tune&quot; for a spell before I<br/>get tired of it.</p><p>I listened to it a third time while writing, and it is growing on me.</p><p>Regards,<br/>George (the discusser / blatherer)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; AKJ/Prent,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;Let me be the first (unfortunately, no one on the list seems to,<br/>of late,<br/>&gt; &gt;if ever, *listen* to music and comment on it anymore) to<br/>congratulate you<br/>&gt; &gt;on a fine new piece!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey hey hey, cut us a little slack!
