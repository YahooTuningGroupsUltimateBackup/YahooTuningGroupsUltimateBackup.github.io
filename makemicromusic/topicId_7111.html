LCD displays.<br/>Standard on laptops, becoming the standard on desktops.</p><p>Advantages:</p><p>() Substantially smaller.</p><p>() Can be controlled digitally.  No noisy analog<br/>conversion (all laptops, or desktop systems employing<br/>a &quot;DVI&quot; connector).</p><p>() Don&apos;t scan.  Florescent backlights still strobe,<br/>but I think this is better than sitting for hours on<br/>end with an electron gun pointed at your face.  At<br/>least I find them much easier on the eyes.</p><p>Disadvantages:</p><p>() Much more expensive.  A 19&quot; CRT (tube) running<br/>1600x1200 can be had for like $150 (just a guess).  A<br/>good LCD display that does the same thing might run<br/>$1200 (again, I&apos;m a little out of touch on prices,<br/>but you get the idea).</p><p>() Colors aren&apos;t accurate.  Only really an issue if<br/>you&apos;re doing digital photography.</p><p>Now, the point.  LCDs cost per pixel.  I believe they&apos;re<br/>made on a lithography process, and higher transistor<br/>densities are harder to do.  Part of the reason for the<br/>high expense is the rejection rate.  I read that Apple&apos;s<br/>original 23&quot; cinema display, they only got 1 for every 2<br/>that came off the line.</p><p>LCDs don&apos;t cost per inch.  However, Joe Public, rather<br/>naturally, thinks bigger in inches is better.  Not so!<br/>Image quality is a function of dpi, and the amount of<br/>&quot;space&quot; you have to work with is just the absolute number<br/>of pixels.</p><p>Laptop makers, especially, take advantage of this, and<br/>sell based on inches.  On ebay, some sellers don&apos;t even<br/>list the res. (for example, the Thinkpad T23 came with<br/>either an XGA (1024x768) or SXGA+ (1400x1050) display,<br/>but they often don&apos;t say which!).</p><p>Apple is the worst at this, shamelessly selling<br/>Powerbooks with 17&quot; screens that are only, what is it,<br/>900 pixels high... but of course, they charge you the<br/>same as a Thinkpad with a much better display.  The<br/>pixels on those things are the size of fingernails,<br/>if you&apos;ve ever seen them.</p><p>Absolute resolution is especially important when laying<br/>out scores.  Also when working with audio.</p><p>Here&apos;s a handy guide to the resolution acronyms...</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xk6j">http://tinyurl.com/2xk6j</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7112 href="#7112">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2004 5:08:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;Disadvantages:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;() Much more expensive.
