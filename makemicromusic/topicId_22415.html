Perhaps I should get a guitar made up with like 31 or 34 per octave and just see.  It just seems like I would have a tough time playing chords accurately.  I have had no big problem with 19 edo on a guitar -- perhaps I should just try it sometime!</p><p>Jay</p><p>Quoting &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@...&gt;:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So Chris, why not just get a 34, cause you then have two 17&apos;s...is &gt; it cause the frets are so small?

Yeah, going 34 opens up a lot more possibilities, but (as I learned with 31) sometimes having more possibilities is not necessarily better.  Though with 34, you could get Mavila and Father temperament happening on top of Mosh and Pythagorean...use it to get MORE xenharmonic instead of going closer to 5-limit JI the way 34 is typically approached.</p><p>But then, a lot of the beauty of 17 is in its elegant simplicity.  A 17-tone guitar is as easy to play as a 12-toner, if perhaps a little more difficult than a 19-tone (the larger semitone of 19 I imagine makes major barre-chords easier on the hand, and the flatter fifth makes for less of a stretch).  Though I can&apos;t say I use barre-chords much anyway, given how anti-xenharmonic they tend to be.  Also, 17 will be a cheaper conversion at any rate, given that it will take half the work of 34.</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So Chris, why not just get a 34, cause you then have two 17&apos;s...is it cause the frets are so small?
