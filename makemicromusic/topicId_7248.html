Margo Schulter will retain her position as moderator as well, unless she decides otherwise.</p><p>I think the list is in fine hands, with people who certainly know theory, certainly know tunings, but most importantly they know *music*. And they make it, frequently, and assuredly more often than I have recently! I&apos;m keeping on just for a few days to make sure there aren&apos;t any glitches (it *is* Yahoo, for heaven&apos;s sake), and once it is clear we&apos;re OK I&apos;ll be taking a leave for a while. I am no longer on any of the other tunings lists for the last few days, so if you need to reach me write off-list.</p><p>I&apos;ll check the action from time to time, and when I&apos;ve got music (and when I&apos;m sure where it will reside) I&apos;ll let you know about it.</p><p>And, as my last official post as ListMom, I want to thank those of you on the list that have made this a mostly very satisfying experience, and I thank all of you that wrote for the kind words over the last couple weeks. I am hoping that forward motion can begin as of now, and that everyone can re-examine their motivations for being here. I hope, and I guess you could say I pray, that your lives will be filled with music; if those hopes and prayers are fulfilled, I&apos;d love for you to share it right here on Making Microtonal Music.</p><p>Down the road,<br/>All my best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7249 href="#7249">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2004 8:23:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.
