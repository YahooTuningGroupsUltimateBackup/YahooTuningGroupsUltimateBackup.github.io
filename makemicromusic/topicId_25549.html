Most people I&apos;ve met know absolutely zero about tunings, and that includes 12 tone eq temp. So...I would start by telling them there are smaller intervals that one can use on a guitar/piano...a guitar with more frets, or a keyboard with more keys. Right away most people see the concept, even kids. Then, I&apos;ll show a student the Harmonics on a guitar string, and show them how the major 3rd on the guitar fretboard is sharp to the Harmonic...it&apos;s easy to hear, and again, folks go &quot;huh, that doesn&apos;t sound so good,&quot; which in fact it doesn&apos;t. Then we&apos;re off to the races...I explain that all notes in the 12 tone system are &quot;out of tune&quot; with the Harmonics, just like the 3rd...and I tell them also that the 12 tone system was invented to play modulating, chordal music, and musicians in most every other culture in the world didn&apos;t use it, and often use smaller intervals than 12 tone. All this is very easy to get, and from there on it&apos;s a matter of just how much a person wants to know about tunings. All the math doesn&apos;t have to figure in much at all...I can tell a person that each Harmonic is a simple multiple of the fundamental, and that to get any eq temp you use logs...again, even kids can get that. I don&apos;t think most folks here are teachers...you gotta start at ground zero, and be able to communicate ideas in a simple way. And in my many years of studying tunings, I&apos;ve seen very few books that do that...which is why mine does. Gotta start at the beginning...</p><p>    And there are also many reasons why folks play music...as far as guitarists, again, you gotta start them with simple things (unless they&apos;re advanced, of course)...and many people wanna play songs they know with their friends...so outside of 12, 19 would be a perfect choice, cause chords sound pretty good on it. But the Eagles, Dylan, Neil Young, and everybody else that&apos;s popular uses 12...so why would such a guitarist wanna use micro tunings anyway? Of course, it could happen, here&apos;s hoping it does. And as far as the more advanced tunings...seems to me that jazz/classical artists who are looking for new horizons in their playing/composing would be more interested. But...where are they? I met Frisell last year, and he played a few of my axes...but haven&apos;t heard him playing any micro tunings yet. Also gave a CD to Nels Cline (who also played with Rod Poole); a cat like that would be perfect, cause he&apos;s out there anyway, and also plays with Wilco, who is very popular...so who knows? As I&apos;ve said, I send CD&apos;s out like candy, and try to keep in touch with lots of artists...just need that one popular musician to go for it, and things may change. BTW..Vai, I believe, used 16 way in the background of a CD years ago...but I read an article in Guitar World where he talked quite intelligently about 16 and 24...wish he would go for it...best..Hstick</p><p> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
