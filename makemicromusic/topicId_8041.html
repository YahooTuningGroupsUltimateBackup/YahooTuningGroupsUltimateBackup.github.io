How<br/>&gt; about details of tunings, and equipment? Did you hand-enter midi data, or<br/>&gt; play at 1/4 tempo, etc?</p><p>Let&apos;s see here.  These were composed on an iMac with Metro SE (a $70 sequencer limited<br/>to 4 audio channels), using Scala for OSX Panther to relay MIDI to an Alesis QS8 synth,<br/>using various piano patches from the QS8.  All of the notes were played in at some point,<br/>up-tempo, down-tempo, or step-entry.  They were then dragged around, copied, velocity-<br/>adjusted, etc.  Subsequently each variation was bounced to audio using Metro. The final<br/>mix (and the simultaneous mix) were done in ProTools on a G5.</p><p>The only trouble I ran into was when two of the same notes sounded simultaneously; this<br/>would cause scala to make one of them stick.  While recording I often had to send a PANIC<br/>or two!</p><p>Before I reveal the tunings, can anyone figure them out?</p><p>Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=8047 href="#8047">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2004 1:26:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Before I reveal the tunings, can anyone figure them out?</p><p>It starts on 12, and we know it ends on 19.
