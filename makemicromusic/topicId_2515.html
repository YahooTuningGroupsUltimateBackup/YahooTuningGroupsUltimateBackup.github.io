Please, can people be a little more cognizant of what they&apos;re<br/>doing here? I&apos;m speakikng of the gratuitous chatter that seems to be<br/>recently plaguing this list. The long list of one-liner chit-chat quotes in<br/>the &quot;XenoMetrics&quot; thread amounts to no information that could be deemed<br/>&quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;important&quot;, even peripherally, for the group as a whole.<br/>Oh, please!</p><p>A bit of chat or a joke is OK once in a while, but really, it&apos;s getting<br/>out of hand, straying way off topic, and it&apos;s really boring, at least to<br/>this bystander. I even get tired of hitting the delete key to clear it<br/>out...</p><p>Can people take the chit-chat off list, please?</p><p>Thanks to the List Mom for eventually stepping in.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=2518 href="#2518">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2002 12:21:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/3/02 2:50 PM, &quot;rick@...&quot; &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Howdy folks.
