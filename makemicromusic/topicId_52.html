Each<br/>keyboard has a usual 1/4-comma tuning with accidentals from Eb-G#, and<br/>can be played in the usual way. Combining notes from the manuals or<br/>moving from one to another, however, brings us into the realm of<br/>enharmonic or fifthtone music.</p><p>Back then, I wrote some impressions of my first experiences -- really<br/>awesome, at once radically new and intimately familiar, given that<br/>Renaissance and earlier Gothic styles largely define my everyday<br/>musical life in playing, listening, and improvising or composing.</p><p>Looking around for whatever I could find about Vicentino or<br/>fifthtone music of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, I learned<br/>about Colonna and the facsimile edition of his _La Sambuca Lincea_<br/>(1618) edited by Patrizio Barbieri.</p><p>Playing his &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; in fifthtones was really something,<br/>and thanks to Scala by Manuel Op de Coul, I can define MIDI files<br/>sharing the experience with others by using the EXAMPLE feature.</p><p>Anyway, this discussion about singing suggested to me the idea of<br/>sharing another example with fifthtone steps, and one providing a nice<br/>occasion for a &quot;surprise&quot; -- an opportunity actually to start doing<br/>what Paul Erlich and I have talked about on the Alternate Tuning List<br/>quite a bit over the last couple of years!</p><p>For people following the notation, C4 is middle C; an asterisk (*)<br/>show a note raised by a fifthtone, and &quot;r&quot; shows a rest:</p><p>   1    &amp;    2    | 1    &amp;    2  ||<br/>   C5        C*5    C5<br/>   Ab4       G*4    Ab4 Ab*4 A4<br/>   F4        C*4    F4<br/>   r    F4   E*4    F4</p><p>MIDI example, faster &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav004.mid</a>&gt;<br/>MIDI example, slower &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmav003.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here the alto makes a cadence Ab4-G*4-Ab4, using a small chromatic<br/>semitone instead of a usual larger diatonic semitone (e.g. A4-G#4-A4).<br/>In 31-tET, this small semitone would be precisely 2/5-tone, and the<br/>large semitone (not used here) 3/5-tone.</p><p>Then the alto has a closing ornament: Ab4-Ab*4-A4 above the lowest<br/>note F4, moving in two fifthtone steps from a usual minor third to a<br/>&quot;proximate minor&quot; third which Vicentino describes as approximately<br/>&quot;5-1/2:4-1/2&quot; (11:9), and then to a more conclusive major third (pure<br/>in 1/4-comma meantone).</p><p>Now for the &quot;surprise,&quot; which maybe some JI-loving audiophiles might<br/>just notice listening with the right timbres.</p><p>While pure 5:4 major thirds are a routine part of 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>this example also has pure vertical fifths, fourths, and minor thirds<br/>or major sixths -- using a form of tuning with &quot;perfect fifths&quot;<br/>introduced by Vicentino himself!</p><p>The basic idea is evidently to have _two_ 1/4-comma meantone tuning<br/>sets, with the second set higher by 1/4-comma (~5.38 cents), the<br/>amount by which the fifth is narrowed in this temperament. Thus the<br/>notes of the second set form pure fifths with notes of the first set.</p><p>Since Vicentino&apos;s harpsichord was designed for 38 notes on two 19-note<br/>manuals, with 36 notes the most he could fit on the instrument in<br/>practice (19 on the lower manual, 17 on the upper), he described two<br/>alternate tunings.</p><p>The first featured a complete 31-note meantone cycle dividing the<br/>octave into fifthtones, plus a few extra keys to provide &quot;perfect<br/>fifths&quot; with some of the most used diatonic steps.</p><p>The second tuning used the same 19-tone meantone set on the lower<br/>manual (Gb-B#), but instead of completing a 31-note cycle of<br/>fifthtones on the upper manual, tuned the notes of this manual all to<br/>form &quot;perfect fifths&quot; with those of the first.</p><p>Putting these ideals together with a bit of 21st-century technology,<br/>we can have the best of both worlds: a 62-note system, with the<br/>equivalent of two 31-note manuals, each with a complete fifthtone<br/>cycle, at the distance of 1/4-comma or ~5.38 cents.</p><p>That&apos;s what happens in this example, more accurately noted as follows,<br/>borrowing Vicentino&apos;s &quot;comma sign,&quot; here an ASCII apostrophe (&apos;), to<br/>show notes raised by 1/4-comma to obtain pure vertical fifths (3:2),<br/>fourths (4:3), minor thirds (6:5), and major sixths (5:3):</p><p>!   1    &amp;    2    | 1    &amp;    2  ||<br/>!
