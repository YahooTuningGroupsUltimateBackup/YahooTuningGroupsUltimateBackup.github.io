And also, is there a separate<br/>database with interval names, cents and ratio from Scala? Or one<br/>should get each scala file and compile them into a database?</p><p>cheers</p><p>Alex Porres!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; HI Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW I just looked again at the code for the javascript page - it<br/>simply<br/>&gt; goes through the quotients and finds the nearest approximating<br/>ratio above and<br/>&gt; below for that quotient as I described it.
