I would just have the conductor cue the players in one at a time at the beginning, then let the piece develop pretty much on its own as the various musicians interact with one another (transposing the them as they wished); after a time the conductor would give an indication that it was time to bring it to an end.

It was actually a GEM (General Electro Music, Italian-made) portable combo organ that I purchased for playing gigs.  It had 12 variable inductances that simultaneously tuned all the octaves of each chromatic note, and the tuning range of each note was very generous: something like +/- a minor 3rd.  I added a couple of potentiometers to control (and moderate) the amount of reverb and the amplitude of the vibrato, which better enabled me to simulate orchestral instruments.  Since I laid the voices down one track at a time, I was able to control the volume of each voice independently with the volume pedal.</p><p>You&apos;re right in thinking that it&apos;s not strictly atonal: the repeating tones at the beginning of the theme tend to suggest a key center, which I repeated in a couple of the successive voices.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to cut this short now.

It was actually a GEM (General Electro Music, Italian-made) portable combo organ that I purchased for playing gigs.  It had 12 variable inductances that simultaneously tuned all the octaves of each chromatic note, and the tuning range of each note was very generous: something like +/- a minor 3rd.  I added a couple of potentiometers to control (and moderate) the amount of reverb and the amplitude of the vibrato, which better enabled me to simulate orchestral instruments.  Since I laid the voices down one track at a time, I was able to control the volume of each voice independently with the volume pedal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re right in thinking that it&apos;s not strictly atonal: the repeating tones at the beginning of the theme tend to suggest a key center, which I repeated in a couple of the successive voices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll need to cut this short now.  The weather is turning bad, and the lights started flickering.  The power may go off shortly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for listening!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil&lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; I love the synth vibrato 2:17 and after.
