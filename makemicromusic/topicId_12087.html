We noted together that<br/>the actual quartertone recorder chart was not up and he has promised to put<br/>it up soon.</p><p>In the meantime, please look at Tui&apos;s wonderful quartertone music for<br/>recorder.  She often indicates the fingerings in the music.  Check out the<br/>Quartertone Lullabies for 3 recorders.</p><p>And good luck!</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p><a href="http://tuistgeorgetucker.com/index.html">http://tuistgeorgetucker.com/index.html</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
