Both your pieces brought a smile to this face.</p><p>Jon a drummer friend of mine who can do complex polyrythms says that<br/>it brings about a real left brain/right brain integration for him<br/>when he gets it going.  Is that your experience?</p><p>Jacky I don&apos;t quite get how you are using latin squares for pitch<br/>changes.  I only count 6 pitches in the scale you give, and if I<br/>understand the concept correctly you need 14.  Are you using two<br/>octaves ?</p><p>Also having listened to the piece before I read your words I was more<br/>focused on the rythm, and I thought that was what was being rotated.</p><p>Anyway thanks  to both of you for this Sunday Morning  MicroMarch<br/>around the Brunch Table.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=1052 href="#1052">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Is that your experience?</p><p>To try and answer honestly, if I am working on a truly complex poly it always starts out analytical, and through repetition becomes assimilated until it feels &apos;natural&apos;. If that is a &quot;yes&quot; to your question, so be it! I dream of being able to perform like Terry Bozzio: he was the leader/percussionist of an 80&apos;s band &quot;Missing Persons&quot;, and played with Zappa; he is well-known to &apos;drummers&apos; as being from another planet, but the main thing is that he is a musician far above his drumming orientation.</p><p>His main thrust for the last decade or so has been to expand the abilities of a solo percussionist, and behind an enormous setup he plays pieces and improvisations that are -- pretty much -- beyond belief. He has worked on ostinatti (sp?) in any quadrant of the body, and then can solo with any combination of other limbs. i.e. he can keep a complex pattern &apos;looping&apos; with his feet, and then solo independently (and I *mean* totally free independence) above that; or loop with right hand and solo with the other 3 limbs.</p><p>It is complex, it is natural-sounding, and it is something I haven&apos;t seen anyone else be able to do even remotely close to what he can. Beyond music, it is really a great example of what the human brain/body can aspire to!</p><p>Me? I just end up having &quot;out-of-brain&quot; experiences, very similar to &quot;out-of-gas&quot;!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1074 href="#1074">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/14/2001 8:08:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What&apos;s up with you Mary - what are you working on these days???</p><p>Hi Jacky</p><p>I&apos;ve been mucking around in involuntary 12TET for the last several<br/>weeks.  I&apos;ve had a maddening problem with GigaStudio where some, but<br/>not all tunes I use it for end up in 12TET.  While the inconsistency<br/>has sharpened my listening skills,and brought a new appreciation for<br/>12TET it has also dampened my ouput.</p><p>I think I have finally traced the problem.  An obscure window limits<br/>the amount of pitchbend that can be applied to any sample.  Normal<br/>samples of thintgs like cellos had their pitchbend squelched,<br/>resulting in 12TET, while gongs had 2 semitones available, giving me<br/>the tuning I wanted.</p><p>Phew. I can return now to making music.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
