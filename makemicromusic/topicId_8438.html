If you&apos;re interested in microtonal piano, you might like to<br/>see Norman Henry&apos;s project in Oakland.  Write me off-list or give<br/>me a call -- (510) 306-7305.</p><p>&gt;&gt; PS- If I explicitly didn&apos;t want uniformity, I&apos;d use a genetic<br/>&gt;&gt; algorithm to find a layout, based on a measure of the uniformity<br/>&gt;&gt; of the pajara tetrads (which would tend to produce a non-uniform<br/>&gt;&gt; overall layout).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You lost me on that one.  Genetic algorithm?</p><p>First, you find a way to describe a layout with &apos;genes&apos;.  In the<br/>uniform case, it&apos;d be a string like 90,+1,-3 that tells the angle<br/>between axes and then the increment for each axis.  You then define<br/>a rule for combining two of these strings into a child string (like<br/>component-wise addition) and. . .</p><p>&gt;Measure of the uniformity of pajara tetrads?  I have no idea how<br/>&gt;I&apos;d do that.</p><p>. . .You find all the tetrads in the decatonic scale on the keyboard<br/>and see how alike their fingering patterns are.  Like, to play the<br/>triads in a C-major scale on a piano, you can pretty much make a<br/>claw-hand and move your arm.  My thinking goes: if there&apos;s some<br/>advantage to not having uniformity in pitch space (&quot;generalized&quot; or<br/>whatever you want to call it), you might as well have uniformity in<br/>scale space -- the Halberstadt (the name of the traditional 7/5<br/>layout) seems to do fairly well at this for the diatonic scale.</p><p>To &quot;see how alike their fingering patterns are&quot; you might lay the<br/>chords&apos; key patterns on a grid (in root position, say).  Then<br/>average the patters per-note (imagine them overlapping) and finally<br/>use some &quot;measure of central tendency&quot; (statistics) to describe<br/>the deviations from the average.</p><p>So for the genetic algorithm, you start with a population of random<br/>strings... 45,+2,-4 etc etc. and breed them, round after round,<br/>killing of the ones for which the pajara tetrads are very different.<br/>At the end, you have pure gold.  :)</p><p>[In practice, as I&apos;ve described this, you might wind up with<br/>something where the pajara tetrads are all very similar, but<br/>impossible to finger.  So rather that making a rule that measures<br/>their similarity, you might instead decide on an ideal chord<br/>shape in advance and use a rule that measures the total deviation<br/>from that (it&apos;s an easier computation, too).]</p><p>&gt;Please remember that I have no background in math or science (or<br/>&gt;even music theory for that matter; in this field I am completely<br/>&gt;unschooled!).</p><p>Yes, well I&apos;m entirely self-taught and slightly crazy.  Let me<br/>know if I lost you.  Or maybe you don&apos;t care.  But if you do, I&apos;m<br/>happy to explain further, on- or off-list.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
