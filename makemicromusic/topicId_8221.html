I find these too more parallel than not and if we are going to modulate, we might ask ourselves why we are doing so. On the other hand we are used to it , and despite the Genius of a Haydn, i find his symphonies hard to take for there lack of modulation to enough different places.<br/>The diamond is the common tone modulations of the harmonic hexad ( or the subharmonic). The magic is that the one produces the other. The CPS is also a condensation of common tone modulations</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;pivot chords,  &quot;neutral regions&quot;, etc<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t find these concepts helpful as a composer.  when I was learning &gt;tonal theory, I realized that the easiest way to think about modulation &gt;(again, when composing an exercise, or what-not) was in 3 steps:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1)&#x9;wander around in key #1, not worrying a bit about where you&apos;re &gt;going ultimately.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2)&#x9;Insert a dominant in key #2  (You can do this almost completely at &gt;random in relation to #1, although one is taught to avoid cross-relations, &gt;but they occur all over the literature,  so they&apos;re not really a big &gt;deal).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3)&#x9;wander around in key #2, and confirm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So basically,  a passage in key #1, and then a passage in key #2.
