In the past when I&apos;ve<br/>done this it has sometimes taken maybe<br/>three downloads or four to fix it,<br/>but this is more thorough. E.g I<br/>have marked the entry points and exit<br/>points of all the routines of any size<br/>so that if it fails in one of those<br/>I will know immediately, also I&apos;ve marked<br/>every fifty or so lines of code throughout<br/>nearly all the program. But sometimes<br/>even when you know where it is and stare<br/>at those few lines of code to try to figure<br/>it out you still can&apos;t see what is happening<br/>and havae to do more work to figure it out.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
