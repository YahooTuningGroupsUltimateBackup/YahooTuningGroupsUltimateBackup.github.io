This gives a quite<br/>harsh sound because the spectrum contains a lot of inharmonic<br/>content.</p><p>To get a smoother sound one should use square wave approximations<br/>which are sums of odd sine wave partials only up to the Nyquist<br/>frequency which is 22050Hz in the case of 44100Hz sample rate. Every<br/>frequency that goes over the Nyquist frequency will be reflected back<br/>to the spectrum and almost always has an inharmonic frequency ratio<br/>to the desired fundamental.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=3376 href="#3376">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

What I&apos;d like feedback about is whether it feels like a &gt;&quot;progression,&quot; and not just a series of chords.</p><p>I didn&apos;t have it together to have the chords you printed in front of me as I listened. What I can offer is that the opening section did give the impression of one chord following another, not awkwardly but also not what one might think of (or feel) as a progression; however, starting around the 1:00 mark you began using suspensions, and using the longer notes to bridge over to a new harmonization seemed to really change the terrain. I don&apos;t know if this would always work, but...</p><p>...what I&apos;m finding when I&apos;m working with new tunings (or subsets of a tuning) is that it takes me a while to find things that somehow seem to have an &apos;organic&apos; pull to it. Others like to consult charts, tea leaves, whatever :) but I tend to rely upon both my ears as well as a sense of adventure. I find that working through a tuning (that I might have already started the process with a design or objective choice) by playing and discovering is actually one of the real joys of going away from 12.</p><p>It is so hard for anyone with an engrained tuning &apos;culture&apos; to find new magnetic pulls that work on us the same way the old ones do, and especially if we are trying to avoid (or at least dropping them when they pop up) those progressions that seem too much like new clothes on an old mannequin. And your example is pointing out how often, as I am exploring a tuning, that I utilize suspensions to try movements from chord to chord.</p><p>Hope this is of some value...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7523 href="#7523">ðŸ”—</a>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2004 12:42:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey!

I&apos;m writing for 2<br/>pianos a bit, but it just gets awkward expecting attacks to be<br/>simultaneous enough to come off as chords.  Learning a new keyboard<br/>technique is a pain!

Both are<br/>perfect at thesame time, the magic of music.<br/>You&apos;ll find the audio renderings of the melodies at <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p><p>Also rendered a 12tet version with the exact same settings.<br/>It floats all over the place very clearly. Recomended comparison to the<br/>DeVelde-JI version.<br/>Also uploaded a pitch bend tuning MIDI and a Midi Tuning Standard tuned MIDI<br/>of the DeVelde-JI version, and a MIDI version of 12tet for comparison.<br/>Also the Scala sequence file, and a HTML transcription of the whole piece in<br/>DeVelde-JI including chords from the bass and clear indication of where the<br/>5 dissonant 4th occur.<br/>I didn&apos;t write the chords from the fundamental bass though as I&apos;ve found<br/>that I disagree with the fundamental bass as it is explained by Rameau.<br/>All are available at <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p><p>Should anybody wish to try out their own ideas in tuning and or think they<br/>can improve on the piece, please do.<br/>This piece is very good at exposing errors in any tuning theorie.</p><p>Infact if you think this version is somehow not correct and think you can do<br/>better with a temperament, adaptive-ji, extended-ji or anything else..<br/>I&apos;ll challenge you to a tuning challenge :)<br/>If you can produce a version that in fair comparison to my version wins in a<br/>poll on this list and the JustIntonation list I&apos;ll pay you $20 by paypal to<br/>buy some beers and celebrate :-)<br/>Fair comparison means you&apos;ll have to use my exact midi (12tet) and retune it<br/>to your wishes and send me the file back as a Scala sequence file.<br/>I&apos;ll then render it in the exact same way as my own file, and will also<br/>render all 4 track melodies individually like my own version.<br/>The end result beeing judged on harmony, melody, how good and in tune it<br/>sounds overall and anything else the voters see fit.<br/>I&apos;ll then start a poll on the MMM and/or JustIntonation lists and if your<br/>version wins I&apos;ll send you the money :)</p><p>Please discuss this piece and my comma solution only on this list or the<br/>JustIntonation list, as I&apos;m no longer a member of the tuning list.<br/>Carl has banned me from the tuning list after a silly offlist discussion<br/>about this very piece (he sent me a very out of tune JI version of his own<br/>of the beginning of this piece, maybe I&apos;ll post it later if someone wants a<br/>laugh).<br/>Apparently Carl can&apos;t stand people who disagree with him, and this goes<br/>especially for JI, ruining JI discussions for everybody on the tuning list<br/>where all JI discussions can only end in flames thanks to Carl and some of<br/>his girlfriends like Aaron.</p><p>Marcel<br/><a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21205 href="#21205">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2009 4:57:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good progress.

But I finally worked out that part too (was tricky part) and<br/>now all comma related parts in my version are different to Petr&apos;s classic<br/>5-limit JI version.<br/>I&apos;ll send an email to Petr to ask if he&apos;s ok with me rendering and posting<br/>his version as the example of classic 5-limit JI.</p><p>As for the most obvious comma problem in measure 23:</p><p>C(8/9) G(4/3) E(20/9) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 3/2 5/3</p><p>C(8/9) F#(512/405) D#(512/243) A(80/27) 1/1 32/27 64/45 5/3</p><p>A#(4/5) G(4/3) D(2/1) A#(16/5) 1/1 5/4 5/3</p><p>A#(4/5) D(2/1) F(12/5) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 3/2 5/3</p><p>C(8/9) C(16/9) F(12/5) G(8/3) 1/1 27/20 3/2 &lt;- dissonant fourth</p><p>C(16/9) C(16/9) E(20/9) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 3/2</p><p>C(16/9) E(20/9) F#(1024/405) A(80/27) 1/1 5/4 64/45 5/3</p><p>A#(8/5) D(2/1) G(8/3) A#(16/5) 1/1 5/4 5/3</p><p>A#(4/5) G(4/3) D(2/1) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 5/3</p><p>A(3/4) A(3/2) D(2/1) F(12/5) 1/1 4/3 8/5</p><p>btw also notice the amazing 1/1 5/4 64/45 6/3 chord! :)</p><p>The full transcription is on my website, but I agree it&apos;s kinda unreadable<br/>for a quick glance.<br/>I&apos;ll make one with note names soon.</p><p>Marcel<br/><a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21214 href="#21214">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2009 6:13:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; btw also notice the amazing 1/1 5/4 64/45 6/3 chord! :)</p><p>uhh that should be 1/1 5/4 64/45 5/3 offcourse, typo in the email.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21219 href="#21219">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2009 6:45:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 9 Oct 2009, at 10:10 AM, Marcel de Velde wrote:</p><p>You have here a lot of enharmonic errors, after listening the file I would say it must be:</p><p>&gt; As for the most obvious comma problem in measure 23:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C(8/9) G(4/3) E(20/9) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 3/2 5/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C(8/9) F#(512/405) D#(512/243) A(80/27) 1/1 32/27 64/45 5/3<br/>&gt;</p><p>C - F#-Eb-A</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A#(4/5) G(4/3) D(2/1) A#(16/5) 1/1 5/4 5/3<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bb-D-G-Bb</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A#(4/5) D(2/1) F(12/5) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 3/2 5/3<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bb-D-F-G</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; C(8/9) C(16/9) F(12/5) G(8/3) 1/1 27/20 3/2 &lt;- dissonant fourth<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C(16/9) C(16/9) E(20/9) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C(16/9) E(20/9) F#(1024/405) A(80/27) 1/1 5/4 64/45 5/3<br/>&gt;</p><p>C-E-F#-A (more logical would be Eb)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A#(8/5) D(2/1) G(8/3) A#(16/5) 1/1 5/4 5/3<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bb-D-G-Bb</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A#(4/5) G(4/3) D(2/1) G(8/3) 1/1 5/4 5/3<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bb-G-D-G</p><p>If you operate with JI, you must be aware of a difference between A# and Bb :-)</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3><a id=21220 href="#21220">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2009 6:51:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Daniel,</p><p>&gt; You have here a lot of enharmonic errors, after listening the file I<br/>&gt; would say it must be:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you operate with JI, you must be aware of a difference between A#<br/>&gt; and Bb :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I must admit with shame..

So far, all I&apos;ve seen is you talking about how<br/>&gt; you have &quot;solved JI&quot; and &quot;made music perfect&quot; and how &quot;your&quot; JI is better<br/>&gt; than the rest or whatever. &gt; I&apos;ve told what I&apos;m doing scattered in several<br/>messages on several lists but realize this isn&apos;t easy to follow so I&apos;ll try<br/>to condense it in a short form in this message for now :) &gt; And if your<br/>approach to JI has been to get yourself used to chords with wolf &gt; fifths in<br/>them, why not just get used to melodic leaps of wolf intervals as &gt; well?<br/>Then again, it&apos;s hard to be critical about what you&apos;re doing when you &gt;<br/>don&apos;t really explain exactly what your approach is. First of all, my<br/>approach is that I think that music has too logical a structure not to have<br/>a mathematical underlying system to it. I think this purely by listening to<br/>it and analysing the way my mind understands music. Further thinking has led<br/>me to the belief that tuning is at the very heart of music. I then searched<br/>for proof wether music has to have compromises in tuning / if temperament is<br/>at the heart of how we percieve music, or if music tuning can be pure math<br/>and all tones have JI ratios to them. The &quot;proofs&quot; put foward by other<br/>people that music can not be JI most of the time and must be tempered I&apos;ve<br/>investigated but could not find a single watertight proof. All I found was<br/>that nobody really knew how to handle things like comma problems. Everything<br/>I&apos;ve found in tuning were people who have had an idea related to tuning and<br/>tried to make it work. Or had come to certain assumptions and stick to those<br/>etc. The more I worked with tuning the stronger my suspicion became that<br/>indeed music is most likely pure JI and that when we play something in 12tet<br/>the brain listenes through all the mistunings and hears an underlying<br/>mathematical JI structure and this is what gives the music it&apos;s meaning /<br/>mood etc. I became determined to either find out how JI / music works, or<br/>proof that music cannot be JI indeed. But in order to find out how JI works<br/>I had to go for it fully and expect it to work first, should I find a proof<br/>that it can&apos;t work along the way that would be good to and I would have<br/>posted this, but my first goal was to proof JI is the way music works and<br/>how this JI system in itself works. Ok now you understand where I&apos;m comming<br/>from. As for my theories. I&apos;ve tried every approach I could think of to<br/>figure out how JI works. Thinking up mathematical structures that I think I<br/>may hear in music, try tuning notes by ear and make sense of the JI ratios<br/>those notes approached, high prime limit JI, 5-limit JI, 7-limit JI. Comma<br/>shifts in melodies, comma drifting music, wolves, fixed scales, etc etc. My<br/>enthausiasm has led me to belief very often that I had found something<br/>special, only to find after a few days after more critical listening or<br/>thinking that I didn&apos;t after all. I&apos;ve tried so many things. I think I&apos;ve<br/>been working on it full time (don&apos;t have a job other than this) for about 3<br/>years now. It just keeps pulling me in. Never before in my life have I<br/>worked so hard for so long, but it is because I enjoy it and I kept feeling<br/>that I had a chance at getting it right. When I came on these lists I had<br/>not seriously retuned music. To do so was shocking for me how bad my retunes<br/>sounded (along with everybody elses). But for most pieces I could find a to<br/>my ears acceptable solution, though after critical thinking and listening I<br/>could never tell for sure if the tuning was right, so I could never trust it<br/>enough to investigate deeper and perhaps find some more of the rules of<br/>music and JI. But one piece stood out in it&apos;s difficulty to get it sounding<br/>right. Beethoven&apos;s Drei Equali Andante :) I think it&apos;s been 10 months now<br/>that I threw every theory I had at it, and tried by ear and every way I<br/>could think of. But it never made sense after the excitement of something<br/>new wore off. Untill now :) Now about how I did it: Remember my theory on<br/>Harmonic Interval Permutations? I once had the following idea. The harmonic<br/>series is arguably the most harmonically perfect series there is. 1/1 2/1<br/>3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1 7/1 8/1 9/1 etc My idea was to limit the harmonic series to<br/>a number of choosing, and then figure out all the permutations of the<br/>intervals. So by limiting to 3 you get: 1/1 2/1 3/1 Which contains the<br/>interval 2/1 and the interval 3/2. Of which the only possible permutation is<br/>first 3/2 then 2/1 which gives: 1/1 3/2 3/1 limiting to 4 will give the<br/>following permutations: 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 1/1 2/1 8/3 4/1 1/1 3/2 3/1 4/1 1/1<br/>4/3 8/3 4/1 1/1 4/3 2/1 4/1 If you put all the possible permutations in one<br/>scale you get: 1/1 4/3 3/2 2/1 8/3 3/1 4/1 For harmonic 5-limit you get the<br/>harmonic interval permutation product set: 1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 5/2<br/>8/3 3/1 10/3 15/4 4/1 5/1 For harmonic 6-limit you get the following<br/>set/scale: 1/1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 9/4 12/5 5/2 8/3 3/2<br/>16/5 10/3 18/5 15/4 4/1 9/2 24/5 5/1 6/1 In one octave this gives: 1/1 9/8<br/>6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 For harmonic 7-limit you get a 20 note<br/>per octave scale which I can&apos;t write from memory right now. The above<br/>harmonic interval permutation product sets I allready believed to have<br/>musical meaning but I didn&apos;t know how to see them before or how to apply<br/>them. Btw notice they&apos;re perfect utonal sets. It&apos;s utonal at the harmonic<br/>limit you&apos;ve set. Beeing utonal first at 1/1 2/1 then 1/1 3/1 then 1/1 4/1<br/>then 1/1 5/1 then 1/1 6/1 etc. You can turn the harmonic 6-limit scale<br/>upside down and it&apos;s exactly equal (but you can&apos;t do this when you put it in<br/>one octave) Many more things I can tell about these sets but I won&apos;t right<br/>now from memory and don&apos;t have everything clear myself yet. Though it&apos;s<br/>abvious one can decribe everything in simple mathematical formulas /<br/>permuations working with these sets. Now what I recently found: My old<br/>theory / the above sets work great as a tonality set! Take for the easyest<br/>example applicable to common practice western classical music the harmonic<br/>6-limit set: (here put in one octave) 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5<br/>15/8 2/1 I&apos;ve shown above that all the tones have as their source 1/1 and<br/>the harmonic series on 1/1. What could be a more beautifull defenition of<br/>the tonic? :) All my other experimentations have eventually led me to think<br/>in this direction as well. This is also almost classical music school<br/>harmony. Tonic and modulations (change of tonic) A fixed scale from the<br/>tonic. There are only 10 tones from the tonic in my harmonic 6-limit<br/>permutation product set (which I now call 6-limit DeVelde Tonality Scale).<br/>But the &quot;missing&quot; C#/Db and F#/Gb I find not to be tones from the tonic in<br/>common practice music. To play for instance 1/1 16/15 4/3 8/5 the tonic is<br/>not 1/1 but for instance 4/3 making 3/2 8/5 2/1 12/5. And C Eb Gb A doesn&apos;t<br/>have as it&apos;s tonic C but for instance G making 9/8 4/3 8/5 15/8 (and all<br/>inversion) etc etc. Not a common practice chord that can&apos;t be explained this<br/>way. Also things like connected fifths. If the tonic is 1/1: 2/5 3/5 9/10<br/>4/3 2/1 3/1 9/2 20/3 10/1 15/1 2 wolf fifths in the example above, but<br/>they&apos;re not actually fifths, there are 2 times 3 notes connected by fifths<br/>and 1 4 notes connected by fifths, and all of these are connected by thirds.<br/>Rearange to get any configuration of 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5<br/>15/8 2/1 with a tonic of 1/1 If you play for instance a wolf interval like<br/>9/8 5/3 or 4/3 9/5 (only wolfs there are) by itself it will sound out of<br/>tune (and I also suspect a large part of this is because you will have a<br/>hard time comvincing your ear/brain you&apos;re in the 1/1 tonic when playing a<br/>fifth by itself without 1/1) But in actual music where the tonic has been<br/>made clear this is atleast to my ear the only way to play it in tune. It<br/>also solves all comma problems. As for the comma problems that are not in 1<br/>tonic they will be solved with a modulation. I&apos;ve so far found that<br/>modulations happen only by consonant intervals of 3/2 4/3 5/4 5/3 though i&apos;m<br/>not sure of this yet and need to investigate more. The 6-limit DeVelde Tonal<br/>Scale has the wolfs 9/8 5/3 which can make a minor equal triad of 9/8 4/3<br/>5/3 and a wolf 4/3 9/5 which can make a major equal triad of 9/8 4/3 9/5.<br/>Both wolfs occur in the Drei Equali andante, a total of 7 wolfs. The 9/8 4/3<br/>5/3 minor occurs once, the 9/8 4/3 9/5 major occurs twice, of which one time<br/>in a very very dissonant manner (you&apos;ll be able to hear it clearly with the<br/>first trombone sound) Furthermore I think things like counterpoint rules /<br/>rules for melodic movement etc can be found in the permutations. As for<br/>going beyond 6-limit DeVelde Tonal scale. I think 7-limit DeVelde Tonal<br/>Scale is all one needs. I seems to me it can play all eastern maqam scales<br/>and do completely new music etc. 20 tones from the tonic is a LOT. (you can<br/>also modulate all you want with don&apos;t forget) Ok and all of this would be<br/>just another theory among the many there allready have been put forward the<br/>past 2500? years. But what makes this one so different? First of all I<br/>belief it explains more and has the potential to explain all. But most of<br/>all, because it sounds right! :) Again have a listen at <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a> JI<br/>has now become only the problem of placying the tonics correctly throughout<br/>the piece, that&apos;s all there&apos;s to it and all music can be played / analysed<br/>in JI like this. No more comma shifts, comma drifting music, comma problems<br/>whatsoever at all. Yes wolfs, but functional and they&apos;re supposed to be<br/>there. (never a wolf from the tonic or on the dominant / subdominant etc)<br/>I&apos;ve used 2 sounds to render the drei equali. First one is the harshest<br/>sound I could find, very unnatural, and the best sound I&apos;ve ever come across<br/>for showing a wolf. With this sound you&apos;ll hear especially one wolf very<br/>clearly in the piece. But while even with this very unnatural sound and<br/>sounding very clearly it does not sound out of tune, it simply sounds very<br/>wolfy and dissonant and very obvious. The second sound is more natural<br/>(tromb2) and the wolfs, even the most dissonant use of the wolf possible in<br/>6-limit develde-ji, isn&apos;t obvious at all but simply sounds &quot;right&quot; to me. As<br/>my theory makes too much sense in too many ways. Solves all problems. Sounds<br/>right, and has no competition from any other theory that can sound as right.<br/>(if you think you can make it sound as good or better with another theory<br/>please post in MIDI so i can put up a fair comparison with thesame sounds)<br/>The I can only come to one conclusion. It IS right :) The comming time I<br/>will be putting many other pieces in DeVelde-JI. And hope both the theory<br/>and how the results sound will convince people. And that this all will lead<br/>to new musical insights which will lead to beautifull compositions in new<br/>musical directions.

The<br/>12/5 in note 16 sounds very strange to me when there was a 14/5 before.</p><p>The other 7th harmonics in chord  23, 24, 27 also sound low to me, don&apos;t sit<br/>right in my ear.</p><p>As for the 27/16 instead of my 8/5 in chord 38, I don&apos;t get that one. It&apos;s a<br/>Bb, not a B. This is an unintentional mistake?</p><p>After that, measures till measure 47, I don&apos;t like how they sound.<br/>And the diminished chord in measure 48 sounds very out of tune to me, sorry.</p><p>I hope the feedback is helpfull somehow.</p><p>Btw I ended up changing one note in my own version.<br/>note 33, from an 8/3 to a 27/10 now.<br/>Also updated my transcription to include my harmonic model roots, and<br/>numbered the notes/chord just like you did.</p><p>Here&apos;s the transcription:<br/><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%28Tonal-JI_15-04-2010%29.png">http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%28Tonal-JI_15-04-2010%29.png</a></p><p>And here&apos;s my mp3 rendering:<br/><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%28Tonal-JI_15-04-2010%29.mp3">http://sites.google.com/site/develdenet/mp3/Drei_Equale_No1_%28Tonal-JI_15-04-2010%29.mp3</a></p><p>Btw, there&apos;s slightly more difference in the mp3 than just the one changed<br/>note at 33.<br/>I found I had accidently mistuned a few notes by a few cents in melodyne<br/>before (had apparently been a bit sloppy).

In a few notable scales though<br/>(say 31TET and 19TET), I have found myself using neutral intervals and even<br/>&quot;odd&quot; diminished ones (such as the 22/15 diminished 5th) by ear to replace<br/>diatonic intervals.</p><p>      And when I hear other people&apos;s music or show people mine...similar cases<br/>seem to unfold (in fact some people won&apos;t &apos;even&apos; accept neutral, they only say<br/>diatonic sounds &apos;ok&apos;...though I think the neutral alternative is just as stable<br/>sounding in many cases).</p><p>     Of course, &quot;unstable music&quot; can sound good...but it seems to be a much<br/>tougher balancing act to pull off far as composition.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The more notes in octave we have in microtonal scales, the more chords we can<br/>&gt;construct.

I will say this, two prerequisites in my mind for music<br/>connecting emotionally (to most people) are<br/>A) Stablility...does it have a gentle sense of progression  rather then feeling<br/>like it suddenly and violently changes moods/&quot;gears&quot;.  And that can apply to<br/>psychoacoustics (less toward more dissonant or vice-versa), chord changes,<br/>instruments fading in, parts building up with melodies and or drums becoming<br/>less/more intense during build-ups or breakdowns or intros or song ending.<br/>A2) Understandably, progression and an evolving nature is needed.  In general<br/>songs have a starting point and a destination...and it&apos;s not a true journey<br/>unless those two points are different.</p><p>IMVHO the most smart musicians can gracefully guide a listener from very calm to<br/>very tense and provide a huge amount of progression/evolution in a song so the<br/>listener can sense everything coming and &quot;coast over the waves of changes&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;get caught in the wake&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Anything can be used for progressions, it depends only what we want   to<br/>&gt;express. Why there should be any<br/>&gt;<br/>limitations? It&apos;s just further expansion of chromatic harmony in 12tone system.&quot;<br/>   I&apos;m not saying there should be limitations...but I&apos;m saying there are certain<br/>things we should expect any scale system to do and certain things we should<br/>expect it not to do.   Back to my 21/17 interval example...as a rough interval<br/>it seems to limit the number of chords possible without sounding like chaos.<br/>   And hey...even in 12TET if you cluster enough notes together you can see<br/>patterns that limit how much the mind can hear of the emotion in you<br/>composition.  Take a 3 note chord and change a note and the sound is a whole lot<br/>different.  Change a note in a 5 note chord and it&apos;s just a bit different.<br/>Change a note in a 7 note chord or even make crazy inversions of it...and often<br/>the mood stays virtually the same.  Take something like an Add2 chord and add a<br/>suspended 4th tone and you&apos;ll barely hear any change in feel but may well be<br/>startled by the increased dissonance (unless that&apos;s what you want to<br/>accomplish).</p><p>    The point is not to limit compositional options, but realize where your<br/>musical efforts may get diminishing returns and efficiently decide where it is<br/>or isn&apos;t worth it to put forth extra effort.  I think it&apos;s a huge reason why<br/>more people don&apos;t compose microtonal music...it&apos;s not that they dislike all the<br/>extra options, but have little to no idea how to pick among them or figure out<br/>how likely they will/won&apos;t work for what they want from them<br/>musically/emotionally.</p><p>   To put it in perspective...I&apos;m going to be trying to make examples (like this<br/>13TET one) and eventually a full  song re-tuned in a bunch of different tunings<br/>to give the listener an idea of what to expect from each tuning far as mood<br/>difference and chord variety.  Hopefully people will be able to flip through<br/>them and saying &quot;ok, this scale/tuning fits what I want best&quot; instead of<br/>thinking &quot;ok...millions of options...let&apos;s just try all of them until I either<br/>find one that works for me or run out of patience&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Smooth modulations of many  kind and tonal jumps are the basic feature of any<br/>&gt;good music written<br/>&gt;<br/>in tonality and extended tonality with functional harmony in last 300  years at<br/>least. Where&apos;s the problem? &quot;<br/>   At least in pop music and music school...I see the idea being taught of<br/>7-note scales and modes under 12TET as the main focus.    Pop songs are<br/>virtually all written in 7-tone scales with sudden transpositions into other<br/>7-tone scales.  Use of &quot;Chromaticism&quot; IE of more than 7 notes in the scale once,<br/>I&apos;ve found, is not a focus.  I guess you could call something like shifting from<br/>a c-major chord to a g-major chord (tonic to dominant...if I have it right) as a<br/>&quot;modulation&quot;...but you&apos;re still stuck within the same 7 notes.   Of course, if<br/>you go deep enough into classical or jazz theory you get smooth<br/>modulations...but even then a whole lot of people are likely to jump in and say<br/>&quot;this is out of tune...this is unsettling...this doesn&apos;t CONNECT EMOTIONALLY&quot;.</p><p>   And that&apos;s not to say it shouldn&apos;t be done...but, rather, that I believe we<br/>should realize that we are not there yet...that we have a ways to go before such<br/>modulations are accepted by most people...rather than consider the challenge to<br/>have been conquered &quot;hundreds of years ago&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Any functional harmony textbook will explain theory. And then just listen and<br/>&gt;analyze lot of music to<br/>&gt;<br/>learn more... It&apos;s easy and probably almost everything in this field  was<br/>discovered and used.&quot;<br/>Modulation theory may be easy for you (and it would be cool if you could post<br/>some good links to primers on it)...but so far that I&apos;ve tried it, meaning both<br/>on the grounds of following the examples AND making it sound cohesive enough<br/>that most people I show the composition I made with such theory to think it<br/>sounds good.</p><p>  In a separate reply I&apos;m going to post an old song called &quot;Melancholy in<br/>Yellow&quot; I made in 19TET which tries to use some modulation tricks to make an<br/>8-tone scale under 19TET sound stable.  And to be honest, just making that extra<br/>tone fit proved tricky enough to me...and, secondly (yet I digress), it didn&apos;t<br/>exactly work emotionally (the average rating for that song on <a href="http://traxinspace.com">traxinspace.com</a><br/>was 2.5/5). :-P<br/>   Though I&apos;d be interested to see someone make a song without a lot of beat or<br/>effects work (IE with most of it&apos;s musical value coming from melody and<br/>counterpoint) that modulates well and getting it to connect with the public (AKA<br/>beyond academia) with very positive ratings... :-)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23208 href="#23208">ðŸ”—</a>MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>9/16/2010 8:01:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the MakeMicroMusic<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Melancholy in Yellow: (trying to use modulation to get 8-note scales under 19TET)</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=23209 href="#23209">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 8:13:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3</a></p><p>This is a complete! :-D song I did in 19TET ages ago called &quot;Melancholy in<br/>Yellow&quot;.

So, in turn, you can pretty well summarize<br/>Middle-Eastern or perhaps even Pelog style scale feel, then switch back to<br/>Western scales all under one system.  22TET is also supposedly such a system,<br/>full of loads of options for both dissonant and consonant moods.<br/>    3) A flip-side of &quot;bad&quot; scale...is since they are fairly limited in mood<br/>they are ALSO fairly predictable in mood (IE there is LESS difference between<br/>maximum dissonance and consonance achievable in a &quot;bad&quot; system) and thus, in<br/>that sense, actually easier to listen to.  Thus you get &quot;diminishing marginal<br/>returns&quot; so far as how dissonant you get...and too much dissonance actually<br/>pushes you back toward a different type of consonance AKA &quot;predictable<br/>ambiguity&quot;.</p><p>     By choosing #2 (assuming you only had to use one scale system for an entire<br/>composition) over #1...IMVHO you simply give yourself more options.</p><p>BTW NOTE I RATE &quot;GOOD&quot; AS BEING ABLE TO EASILY SHOW MORE MOODS AT THE HANDS OF A<br/>COMPOSED, NOT AS SIMPLY BEING MORE CONSONANT!<br/>A) IE if I took a scale that was a straight harmonic series or even moreso just<br/>stacked octaves like 1/1 2/1 4/1...I would rate THAT as a &quot;bad&quot; scale as well.<br/>:-D<br/>B)     On the other hand, if I took a scale whether dissonance of each chord in<br/>a scale was so high the chords &quot;blur&quot; against each other and the mood<br/>difference is negligable...that&apos;s ALSO &quot;bad&quot;...that&apos;s where &quot;too much<br/>dissonance&quot; becomes an issue and the mind says &quot;there are rarely different<br/>sounding types of noise&quot;.<br/>C) Same goes if I took a scale that had lots of consonance/dissonance<br/>option...but the scale had to be HUGE (and thus hard for the composer to access<br/>the options easily)...that would ALSO be &quot;bad&quot;.</p><p>    The trick, in my opinion, is to find scales that give loads of options with<br/>a good emotional-options-per-notes-in-scale ratio.  I think that by and large<br/>explains 12TET: it has a ton of distinct sounding options for both consonance<br/>and dissonance and a very good options-per-note ratio.  31TET has more options<br/>but a worse option-per-note ratio to me, for example.  And my 9-tone Dimension<br/>scale system, for example, aims to be &quot;good&quot; by taking most of the<br/>emotional/mood options (minus transposition) of 31TET and squeezing it into 9<br/>tones (you only get 4 or so different &quot;modes&quot;, not the 31 of 31TET or the 12 of<br/>12TET).  What ever you do there is always compromise...if you get more options,<br/>you almost certainly lose some far as &quot;options per note&quot;.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24193 href="#24193">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2011 9:40:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; According to my calculations, the worst ET &lt; 100 for 5-limit<br/>&gt; harmony is 68, with this val:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt; 68 108 159 |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the worst for the 7-limit is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt; 93 148 216 262 |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Knock yourself out!  -Carl</p><p>Really?

Who among us hasn&apos;t thrown away sketches in utter disgust? Part of learning, it seems, is knowing first hand what *didn&apos;t* work. This only requires a humble honesty!</p><p>2) No simple rule-of-thumb ingredient is sufficient to produce a consistently guarantee-able masterwork. Even if it were, someone somewhere is guaranteed to dismiss it. Follow your inner compass; in that regard, Gene is right---write music that thrills you. Copy the &quot;isms&quot; of someone whose music gives your life meaning.</p><p>3) For example, there is plenty of music that is unbelievably rich where the very concept of chords and chord changes is anachronistic at best and meaningless at worst. Indian music, for example, is drone and melody, and the best (even I daresay most &apos;average&apos;) Indian music is fantastic. Much medieval and pre-medieval music is also _monophonically_ conceived. It doesn&apos;t lack for not having harmony, really. Then you have Messiaen, whose dense chordal complexity and configurations can tie your head in knots. Both beautiful, both valid (although personally I prefer simpler, gentler things than Messiaen these days). Anyway, I think not enough people simply revel in such a model -- drone and melody -- to get their heart/ear/imagination chops going. People want to write hyper complex, harmonically rich stuff right away, and it&apos;s ass backwards. But it&apos;s an understandable, and perhaps an inevitable part of the process. How many folks *can* write a fine monophonic melody? Don&apos;t we think we should start there before combining many lines? Doesn&apos;t that make sense? But how often do people who try to write go this route? Here&apos;s a challenge for you: write a drone/melody/percussion piece that totally blows people away. Composers are afraid of that, perhaps because they find complexity something easy to hide behind? Which leads to:</p><p>4) Composers tend to think complexity is hard to do, *because* it&apos;s complex. At least let&apos;s say this: doing complex *well* is vey hard. As I gain more experience, in fact I&apos;m finding that simplicity that speaks to the core is harder/hardest to compose. One&apos;s &quot;self&quot; or imagination is more exposed, and it feels more vunerable (at least this is my impression). One can also feel that one isn&apos;t pleasing enough to the certain snobs who are looking for a certain outward superficial virtuosity. &lt;&lt;e.g. in some ways, Handel was a much better _communicator_ (not better composer per se) than Bach precisely because of this--he was always after the final emotive effect, not abstract structural concerns--look at the way a Handel chorus from &quot;Messiah&quot; (&quot;For Unto Us a child is born&quot; is a good example) is both completely emotionally satisfying in the buildup, not needing to pull out all the contrapuntal juice at all times like Bach often does--he often has a single part or just two going at a time, and then the climax is utterly majestic when all four are singing&gt;&gt; Randomness can suffice for complexity, but little information, musically or grammatically speaking, is conveyed by randomness. The music that speaks to people throughout history is at its core simple enough to reach many. Or, as Mozart said &quot;A good piece has something for the people, something for the connoisseur&quot;. Stripping things down to their bare expressive essentials yet retaining communicative power is the hallmark of many of the masters I admire. The marriage of simplicity and sophisticated complexity is also delicate and equally hard, if not harder than just simplicity, and perhaps the holy grail. Making complexity *sound* simple. Anyway, Mozart was known to have been proud as hell of a certain piece he wrote that contained two chords. He was also capable of the most achingly beautiful twisted chromatic fugal writing, but that&apos;s not his regular mode (it happens more when he writes in minor keys). Anyway, there&apos;s something about simplicity arrived at by someone who has struggled with and done complexity that is for me superior than someone who starts out with for instance near zero instrumental or compositional technique and just writes ditties. The journey towards that restraint actually does something palpable to the quality, but I can&apos;t really say what it is....</p><p>5) I read somewhere a suggestion that if one parameter of music is complex, make the others, or most of the others, simple. For balance. Seems to me to be a sensible suggestion. So, complex harmony with simple rhythm or vice versa would be an example. Or timbral changes electronically might be best clothed in relatively stable traditional musical elements. For all of Stravinsky&apos;s metrical complexities in &quot;Le Sacre&quot;, most of the tone-material is derivable from simple tetrachordal structures, often in bi-tonal aggregates.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>AKJ</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ozan&gt;&quot;Despicable Me, the awful music critic.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Argh....I&apos;m not here to pick a grudge match....I&apos;m here to find out what&apos;s<br/>&gt; wrong with my compositional style and shut it up it for good!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are my supposed problems (if I have it right)<br/>&gt; A) Not enough repeating Motifs -Rick Ballan<br/>&gt; B) Too many repeating Motifs -You<br/>&gt; C) Too many repeating chords -You and Carl<br/>&gt; D) Lack of variation in rhythm of melodies -You<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When Carl said I lacked chordal variation, he was talking about the following<br/>&gt; 19TET song I wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/smallmelancholic.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...I&apos;m guessing the rest of you think that song needs serious work/has serious<br/>&gt; problems as well....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt; I simply want (from you and others)...some suggestions to FIX these issues<br/>&gt; FIRST.

It is something<br/>I&apos;m learning still and is meaningful even in the context of pop music.<br/>(think of the songs you like that have just the &quot;perfect&quot; contrasting<br/>section.) This balance is indeed very hard to improvise - unless you have<br/>something like a Mozart skill level.</p><p>In Orwellian Cameras my creation of an introduction shamefully and almost<br/>mechanically &quot;recomposed&quot; the chord progression in the ending - I cut the<br/>speed of chord changes by half, used the chord tones in an arpeggio which<br/>was played on a harp - and incorporated some melodic lines from later on in<br/>the piece against the harp.</p><p>Here is the original version<br/><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=437&p=3088&hilit=orwell#p3088">http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=437&p=3088&hilit=orwell#p3088</a></p><p>Here is the 2nd version<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=341">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=341</a></p><p>Chris</p><p>On Fri, Jan 7, 2011 at 3:44 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris&gt;&quot;1.

I&apos;m thinking a lot of people here are in<br/>the same boat.</p><p>&gt;&quot;How many folks *can* write a fine monophonic melody? Don&apos;t we think we  should<br/>&gt;start there before combining many lines? Doesn&apos;t that make sense?  But how often<br/>&gt;do people who try to write go this route? Here&apos;s a  challenge for you: write a<br/>&gt;drone/melody/percussion piece that totally  blows people away. Composers are<br/>&gt;afraid of that, perhaps because they  find complexity something easy to hide<br/>&gt;behind?&quot;</p><p>   Agreed, it&apos;s easy to hide behind complexity.  The other issue is being taken<br/>as &quot;oh, you were just too lazy to write the chord progression or forgot to title<br/>the piece a piece of minimalism, eh?&quot;...that&apos;s the typical response I&apos;ve gotten<br/>if composing anything other than a minimalism piece blatantly titled as a<br/>minimal piece.</p><p>     The third issue (for me at least) in that I love the tonal color of<br/>polyphonic music (and yes, I mean with multiple instruments as &apos;polyphonic&apos;...I<br/>learned the lesson on polyphonic vs. chord intensive, chord intensive not<br/>necessarily involving more than one instrument, before).  That half the fun for<br/>me of going micro-tonal.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Randomness can suffice for complexity, but little information, musically or<br/>&gt;grammatically speaking, is conveyed by randomness.&quot;</p><p>    Agreed...it just seems a double-standard where if I compose with motifs I&apos;m<br/>&quot;lazy for not adding variation&quot; and if I avoid motifs I&apos;m &quot;speaking in<br/>randomness&quot;.   I agree with Chris...it may be easy for someone like Daniel Forro<br/>or Mozart to do both...but it&apos;s hard for me...even when I put a huge amount of<br/>effort toward it.<br/>    What bugs me is the attitude that, no matter what I do, no one here seems to<br/>be able to stand up and say &quot;that guy (Mike) is motivated...that&apos;s not the<br/>issue&quot;.  That doesn&apos;t seem to happen here or on the tuning list...most everyone<br/>assumes if I do something wrong it&apos;s because I&apos;m too lazy/not trying, not<br/>listening, too proud to try/listen, assume I&apos;m flat out lying about composing<br/>for an hour or more a day, etc.  I&apos;d likely die before the day someone gave me<br/>credit for effort.<br/>  It happened terribly back at Trax In Space to...honest feedback was hard<br/>because everyone seemed to assume I thought I was &quot;perfect&quot; and had ego<br/>issue...when in reality all I wanted was someone to say &quot;your music communicates<br/>X mood because of Y things&quot; and see if that matched my intentions for the song<br/>rather than run a personality-test on me.</p><p>  IMVHO...many of the above could be avoided if when someone posted as a reply<br/>to the music<br/>A) The mood they (the listener) derived from the piece<br/>B) The elements of the composition that brought forth said mood, with notes on<br/>when said-things happened on a time-line when possible<br/>C) Possible artists/songs the piece or aspects of the piece sounds like (and or<br/>tunings/scales it sounds like).

I&apos;m not here to<br/>&gt; &quot;promote myself&quot;...I&apos;m here to promote my concepts...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Specifically to my style (and the 17TET piece)?<br/>&gt;    To make something along the lines of what Herbie Hancock or the Beatles makes<br/>&gt; with their music...a bit odd, tonally diverse, and certainly not &quot;4-chord bubble<br/>&gt; gum pop&quot; (a lot more melodically and harmonically playful), but still quite<br/>&gt; accessible and certainly not &quot;random sounding&quot;.<br/>&gt;     The sort of thing you can both listen to for its own intellectual sake and<br/>&gt; dance to.  Again, I&apos;m not aiming to write &quot;symphonies&quot; or even &quot;tiny parts of<br/>&gt; symphonies&quot; or trying to write &quot;piano solos&quot;...but rather get the kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;advanced indie-pop&quot; feel the above groups have...and the kind of feel I like<br/>&gt; listening to in general.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

IE I don&apos;t like Madonna&apos;s music, but I can hear<br/>enough in it that I won&apos;t consider anyone who likes it &quot;needing elementary music<br/>lessons in tone and key&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;when these people have little interest in penetrating deeper into microtonality<br/>&gt;despite our very own collective<br/>&gt;<br/>efforts as senior peers?&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;So far, I have not seen any systematic analysis or discovery of anything<br/>&gt;regarding acoustics from the newbie quarter. &quot;</p><p>   You know...relative to people like yourself and Gene...even those like Igs<br/>are newbies.  And people like Sevish even more so.  And yet...I feel Sevish and<br/>Igs&apos;s work is on par with your own...not on &quot;technical prowess&quot;...but the<br/>greater purpose of emotional effect and balance.<br/>  Also if musical influence were so simple as who was there the longest...half<br/>of today&apos;s leading musicians would never exist.  My issue with the whole senior<br/>peers thing is not any lack of expertise...but rather that there seems to be a<br/>drive among them to pull the market to where they are rather than accommodate to<br/>what&apos;s actually there IE the skill is there but the direction...isn&apos;t quite<br/>there.<br/>  I view myself as the opposite...I trust I have the direction...but not the<br/>skill....hence I&apos;m trying to get those who do have the skill to listen IE<br/>compose with my tunings (and I mean starting songs from scratch, not retuning<br/>existing songs they&apos;ve made, which often works horrifically do to non-standard<br/>non-even intervals my scales use.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The proposed arguments just reek of pseudo-science wherever we turn... in<br/>&gt;grandiloquent parlour at that.&quot;</p><p>    And your compositional alternative is?  It would be easy to call their work<br/>pseudoscience...if it didn&apos;t mysteriously sound as or more amusing then your<br/>own.</p><p>&gt;&quot;For the fourth article, the whole matter should finally boil down to what you<br/>&gt;yourself aspire for your own enjoyment. Try to create something microtonal that<br/>&gt;you really are satisfied with, without grandiose motives<br/>&gt;<br/>to influence anybody out there.&quot;</p><p>    Good concept...only it seems to give birth to compositions with little<br/>longevity.  I tried that concept for a couple of years and loved it...but then<br/>came back years later and found myself dismissing my own music due to technical<br/>reasons.</p><p>   For example...I can&apos;t even vaguely stand the bad production in my old works<br/>now that I know I need to do things like tune the drums on 5ths and 4ths or<br/>pieces with only 5 chords or melodies with an overly repeating pattern I didn&apos;t<br/>notice when composing it, but certainly did 1 month later.<br/>  It seems having a &quot;second ear&quot; is key to a song&apos;s longevity.  Otherwise it<br/>seems you end up with something only good if you have the exact mood you had on<br/>the day you wrote it.  Heck, I&apos;d love to know exactly what motifs repeat in my<br/>14TET piece because, at least for now, it sounds like a solo to me (in a good<br/>way)...though as time goes on I figure it will become clearer to me where the<br/>repetition is after I get &quot;un-used to it&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Let others like Igs and Chris have a go at the scales to demonstrate your<br/>&gt;points.&quot;</p><p>     Exactly...  Hopefully this time around when I publish my Dimension^2 tuning<br/>I will have as good luck as when I published these &quot;bad&quot; tunings.  It seems when<br/>I try to make a good scale, people ignore it...but when I try to make a &quot;bad&quot;<br/>scale, people are all over it... :-D</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24351 href="#24351">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2011 7:05:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But I think Gene meant, OECD nations account for roughly<br/>&gt; 1/6 of the world&apos;s population, not 1/10th.</p><p>If we&apos;re going by OECD, does that mean we get to keep Turkish maqam music?</p></div><h3><a id=24354 href="#24354">ðŸ”—</a>MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>1/7/2011 8:16:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the MakeMicroMusic<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /djtrancendance/DIMENSION squared2.tun<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Dimension Squared Tuning Scala File</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/DIMENSION%20squared2.tun">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/DIMENSION%20squared2.tun</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=24356 href="#24356">ðŸ”—</a>MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>1/7/2011 8:23:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the MakeMicroMusic<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /djtrancendance/dimension2inaction.mp3<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Short example of Dimension Squared Tuning</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/dimension2inaction.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/dimension2inaction.mp3</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=24357 href="#24357">ðŸ”—</a>MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</h3><span>1/7/2011 8:26:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the MakeMicroMusic<br/>group.</p><p>  File        : /djtrancendance/dimensionsquared.scl<br/>  Uploaded by : djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>  Description : Dimension Squared Tuning Scala File</p><p>You can access this file at the URL:<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/dimensionsquared.scl">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/dimensionsquared.scl</a></p><p>To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>Regards,</p><p>djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=24358 href="#24358">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2011 8:30:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs, Chris and others, I&apos;d greatly appreciate it if you try composing with this<br/>scale:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/dimensionsquared.scl">/makemicromusic/files/djtrancendance/dimensionsquared.scl</a></p><p>   Finally managed to translate my Dimension^2 tuning to a Scala file.

Our so-called<br/>social scientists and economists in Turkiye regularly display their<br/>prowess as such. For example, you can open up the US constitution, find<br/>every place the word &quot;public&quot; appears and distribute the frequency of<br/>their occurrence by pages against the word &quot;law&quot; to draw a conclusion<br/>leading to the importance of &quot;public&quot; vs &quot;law&quot;. The interpretation of<br/>statistical distributions is always subjective and speculative not only<br/>due to precision limitation but because the measurements are determined<br/>on/by/for subjects. What amounts to anything here for tuning is hard<br/>acoustical data.

If you wish me to cease mine, I suggest you lead by example--you are, after all, the more refined, more mature scholar, are you not?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And<br/>&gt;&gt; moreover, you fail to comprehend that you can statistically correlate<br/>&gt;&gt; any chunk of data, even those gained from numerology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My dear Ozan, I assure you that I have received instruction in these subjects by professors of no lesser qualifications than those you yourself possess (and some of perhaps greater qualification).  If you think your hand-waving at the most elementary objections toward statistical methodologies will get any more than a chuckle out of me, I&apos;m afraid you are mistaken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Our so-called<br/>&gt;&gt; social scientists and economists in Turkiye regularly display their<br/>&gt;&gt; prowess as such. For example, you can open up the US constitution, find<br/>&gt;&gt; every place the word &quot;public&quot; appears and distribute the frequency of<br/>&gt;&gt; their occurrence by pages against the word &quot;law&quot; to draw a conclusion<br/>&gt;&gt; leading to the importance of &quot;public&quot; vs &quot;law&quot;. The interpretation of<br/>&gt;&gt; statistical distributions is always subjective and speculative not only<br/>&gt;&gt; due to precision limitation but because the measurements are determined<br/>&gt;&gt; on/by/for subjects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Surely you must see the flaw in this analogy.  The strength of a statistical correlation depends entirely on the level to which variables are isolated and controlled.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What amounts to anything here for tuning is hard<br/>&gt;&gt; acoustical data. Flying messages in a heated mailing group on differing<br/>&gt;&gt; tastes settled on no solid ground is NOT hard data, that you could even<br/>&gt;&gt; begin to correlate anything scientifically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a well-known practice in the development of pharmaceuticals that trials progress incrementally, gradually increasing both population size and diversity.  If a drug fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in a small and very restricted sample population, further trials are not conducted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, and on the tuning list, we have a small sample population indeed, but there is no reason to suspect there is no value in using this population for preliminary tests.  In the case of at least Michael, he has an hypothesis that is quite testable, though he acknowledges it is in need of refinement.  Specifically, he hypothesizes that some intervals sound &quot;good&quot; in music and that others sound &quot;bad&quot;, and that scales composed of &quot;bad&quot;-sounding intervals will result in music that sounds &quot;bad&quot;, while scales composed of &quot;good&quot;-sounding intervals will produce music that sounds &quot;good&quot;.  Yes, this is subjective, but the rather &quot;universal&quot; nature of these claims makes them easily falsifiable.  Even with a tiny sample pool.  If just one person can write music which sounds &quot;good&quot; with his &quot;bad&quot; scale and &quot;bad&quot; with his &quot;good&quot; scale--even if the music only sounds that way to a small handful of people--that&apos;s enough evidence to reject the experimental hypothesis.  A more refined hypothesis would, of course, necessitate more rigorous design and more rigorous testing.  But such simple, broad, universally-oriented hypotheses as the ones often advanced by the &quot;newbies&quot; can easily be falsified with very lax procedures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

As a result I have some<br/>knowledge of the scientific method. John&apos;s book is a viable and dependable<br/>method of research into his (John&apos;s) perception of music. I think if Michael<br/>presented his ideas with a similar degree of thoroughness there woudl be<br/>less controversy to his statements. I am not saying John&apos;s work is valid for<br/>everyone - but it is valid for his personal perception of music and probably<br/>is more or less valid for more people than himself to varying degrees.</p><p>I remember on the tuning list people had unpleasant things to say about<br/>John&apos;s development of his interval evaluation calculator - I don&apos;t think<br/>people at the time understood that he was fitting his observations to<br/>several candidate formulae which are then used to extrapolate his<br/>observations. This is not too different than my experience of working with<br/>an excellent chemical engineer who made design decisions based on<br/>interpolations of incomplete information - for example - it is impossible to<br/>find data for the chemical you are working with if your company is the first<br/>ever to synthesize it on a pilot plant or larger scale. So (reasonable)<br/>guesses need to be made and data, which by necessity will be incomplete,<br/>need to be generated. Its simply a fact that when you get to the<br/>practicality of something you rarely have all of the information that you<br/>would like. A good chemical engineer or chemist will chose test points that<br/>define the problem well - and even then some assumptions are made - such as<br/>going from data point A to data point B will be linear - or exponential - or<br/>whatever relationship generally governs the particular data space you are<br/>trying to describe. There is in fact a method to proper experimental design<br/>to generate the maximum amount of data for the minimum number of experiments<br/>and carry an acceptable degree of risk. And the goal is *not* to explain<br/>every fact of every possible facet of the subject.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sun, Jan 9, 2011 at 7:53 PM, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Chris, I had a chance to review the said book when my senior<br/>&gt; colleague Karaosmanoglu visited me some weeks ago with that in his hand.<br/>&gt; The book features a somewhat modest outline of scale formulation through<br/>&gt; a combination of experience and subjective criteria, which seem to<br/>&gt; result in a pleasant tone-system for most Bluesy situations.

The formula I eventually worked out is:</p><p>(2 + 1/x + 1/y - y/x)/2    ...note y/x&lt;=0.9375</p><p>The 2 on the left is the strength value of the two notes if each has a strength value of 1.<br/>The 1/x + 1/y has (it seems) to do with periodicity.<br/>The y/x has to do with beating (dissonance).<br/>The /2 on the right appears to be an average.</p><p>Using this formula for harmony intervals I propose three categories of consonance of a sine wave harmony interval...</p><p>If the result is less than 0.75 then the (sine wave) interval is bad.<br/>If the result is between 0.75 and 0.9999 then the (sine wave) interval is Minor.<br/>If the result is 1.0 or higher then the (sine wave) interval is Major.</p><p>Next I used this basic formula in a computer program to work out the consonance values of intervals with complex tones and close to &apos;normal&apos; timbres. Normal meaning that the frequencies of the partials are i, 2i, 3i, 4i etc. and the amplitudes/loudness of the partials are j, j/2, j/3, j/4 etc.</p><p>If anyone is interested in my interval calculator program you can download it free from <a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">www.johnsmusic7.com</a> .

When trying for &quot;consonance&quot; or &quot;dissonance&quot; there<br/>are always diminishing marginal returns...</p><p>  Far as &quot;good&quot; scales (assuming 7 note), even by with dyadic optimization you<br/>are always going to get a couple of at least semi-sour dyads or possible chords<br/>not to mention that (as I just proved to myself in an experiment trying to<br/>create a &quot;7-limit only dyad scale&quot;...just because all the dyads work and are all<br/>fairly low-limit does not mean the scale will sound completely cohesive<br/>melodically and means a fair deal, but not necessarily a whole lot of the chords<br/>can be used in &quot;resolvable&quot; progressions!).

I&apos;d even say that of 7-limit (assuming the scale in<br/>question has relatively few 5-limit intervals at least 25% or so 7-limit or<br/>higher ones).  The funny thing is I don&apos;t hear Minerva as &quot;11-limit&quot; far as<br/>compositional feel...but rather more &quot;7-limit with a dash of 11-limit&quot;...and I<br/>find the neutral triads you noted in it before surprisingly<br/>accommodating...indeed often working well as major or minor depending on the<br/>context and pretty good as points of resolution.</p><p>    I actually think Minerva could pass to a whole lot of 12TET-only<br/>listeners...it just sounds so balanced...the level of tension I get composing<br/>with it is uniform...no weird areas where tension randomly seems to shoot up<br/>that makes me feel like I&apos;m playing &quot;Minesweeper&quot; when composing with them.</p><p>   Know of any composers (including yourself...) who have music online made<br/>using Minerva?

My other &quot;favorite 15-limit interval&quot; is<br/>22/15...ha, no wonder this makes sense; the two are inversions of each other...<br/>:-D  It&apos;s weird how, to me 15/11 sounds no more off than 18/11...although 15/11<br/>(I believe) is higher odd-limit.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24631 href="#24631">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2011 11:50:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;A few quarter-tones in a row....can make a GREAT 18/17 (and 17/9 under<br/>inversion), or a good 17/16 if you stretch them a bit.&quot;</p><p>      Numerically it can (IE if you are measuring lowness of odd-limit as the<br/>standard), but....</p><p>     Funny fact...at least according to Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s critical band<br/>dissonance research (<a href="http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/images/image3.gif">http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/images/image3.gif</a>), the<br/>maximum point of roughness is essentially at the first 12TET semitone IE 100<br/>cents...essentially the same as 18/17!<br/>     And what if you take a notoriously high-limit fraction like 255/253 that is<br/>much smaller than 18/17?  Very little roughness. according to the graph...almost<br/>a sense of unison.</p><p>      So at least if you subscribe to said-above dissonance theory...the area<br/>around 18/17 has little inherent &quot;stability&quot; value.  But when you form a dyad<br/>between it and 2/1...you get around 15/8.    And between it and 6/5 you get<br/>about 9/8...  So it seems obvious to me the semitone&apos;s real compositional value<br/>is the way it combined with many simpler dyads to form relaxed-sounding<br/>dyads...and not that it has a lot of stability or non-roughness in and of<br/>itself.</p><p>    &gt;&quot;More than a few quarter-tones and you get a good 12/11 (and 11/6 under<br/>inversion)&quot;</p><p>   Looking again at (<a href="http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/images/image3.gif">http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/images/image3.gif</a>)...12/11 is<br/>significantly better than 18/17 in and of itself though still pretty rough.<br/>Though, as with 18/17...it seems to really fulfill its purpose in forming strong<br/>dyads with other tones (as said above...when it forms a dyad with 2/1 that dyad<br/>is a rather strong 11/6).  Seems to be a pattern with smaller dyads...a lot of<br/>the time it&apos;s not so much the &quot;goodness&quot; of the dyad that counts but the<br/>&quot;goodness&quot; of how it combines with much larger simple tones.</p><p>     I would leave it at &quot;a chain of quarter tones can form something good...in<br/>combination with another tone arrived to by using a simple, fairly wide ratio&quot;.<br/>I also guess you could say I disagree that a quarter-tone sounds less good than<br/>a semi-tone based on my own ears and Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s theory.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24632 href="#24632">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2011 12:30:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Know of any composers (including yourself...) who have music online made<br/>&gt; using Minerva?</p><p>Minerva has just been a theoretical possibility for a few years now; showing up in a list of the best 11-limit planar temperaments.

There is a great deal of depth to the layers.&quot;</p><p>  Glad you enjoyed it!  As usual with me, I was indulging myself with a whole<br/>bunch of 6+ note chords trying to &quot;ooze&quot; some extra tonal color out of my<br/>composition...not to say that&apos;s the best way to do things for everyone...but<br/>it&apos;s always been the style I like to compose and likely always will be.</p><p>&gt;&quot;My prog rock classical mind doesn&apos;t know quite what to make of the iconic<br/>&gt;nature of the music.&quot;</p><p>   It&apos;s ok, because it&apos;s not supposed to. :-D  The whole point was to be playful<br/>(cross-genre, dynamic instrumental arrangement, cross-chord type and modulation,<br/>progressive but theme centric...) to the point that there&apos;s no practical<br/>explanation just a feeling of being overwhelmed yet relaxed.  I guess you could<br/>say IDM is about the closest single genre generalization you can give to it<br/>(crazy beats, detailed progressions...)...then again, I dare you to find a piece<br/>of IDM that sounds anything like it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I was too busy and had to drop out of the bad / good tuning conversation - I<br/>gotta say your tuning here sounds very pleasant - is it harmonic timbre<br/>aided?&quot;</p><p>   As I (also) replied to Mike B about the same issue...amazingly...not at<br/>all...it uses completely unaltered acoustic timbres, no harmonic timbre<br/>aiding/shifting, no &quot;cheating&quot; that way.  I know I brag about Dimension tuning<br/>(used in this song) being able to do uncanny things but hey...there you go! :-)<br/>    In fact there are three, yes, three 22/15 fifths and 3 sets of the following<br/>intervals (12/11, 15/11, 11/9, 11/6, and 18/11) to go with them...and I use all<br/>of them in that song...again without any sort of overtone matching to achieve<br/>the level of consonance in the song.  Mathematically you&apos;d think they&apos;d sound<br/>nasty but, in context, I swear...they can work in a way virtual as &quot;stable&quot; far<br/>as consonance as 7-limit...even in things like the &quot;worst&quot; chords possible in<br/>the scale such as 15:18:22.</p><p>   This all goes back to my general theory that<br/>A) Certain 11-limit dyads both have an advantage in clarity over others (IE<br/>14/11, 16/11,17/11,19/11,20/11,21/11....aren&apos;t them, but the 11-limit ratios I<br/>use are)<br/>     and<br/>B) These 11-limit dyads can have their complex feel to a large extent<br/>neutralized by simpler dyads when said 11-limit dyads are precisely estimated<br/>(IE within 8 cents)...so chords made with them act much as if they were simpler<br/>triads (or tetrads or pentads or &quot;worse&quot;).... :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;Have you heard any Edgar Varese? He had at least one piece that was an<br/>&gt;iteration of a chord (can&apos;t remember the name off hand - ionization?) - as I<br/>&gt;remember various sections an orchestra taking turns<br/>playing this huge sonority - sometimes together - sometimes not. This has that<br/>sort of effect on me though not nearly as dissonant.</p><p>    Well,  I &quot;randomly&quot; switched instruments for certain notes both<br/>A) To put different levels of stress on each note without using something<br/>obvious and more mechanical sounding (IE velocity/volume)</p><p>B) to improve production quality for some of those chords so large they sounded<br/>muffled when played with just 1-2 instruments or even 5 or so instruments each<br/>attached to a single part/melody.<br/>    Had no clue about Edgar Varese though, or that someone else would be &quot;crazy&quot;<br/>enough to try such a bizarre arrangement technique...will have to check it out.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And lastly - liquid beats - is it the literal sloshing sound in the middle of<br/>&gt;the stereo field?&quot;</p><p>    Not at all...but it&apos;s funny because, I actually did use a water sample<br/>through an aggressive resonant high-pass filter to substitute for a cymbal in<br/>this song! :-D<br/>    But in all honesty, I was trying for a very natural feel and trying hard to<br/>avoid the &quot;mechanical dance music&quot; feel, so all the drums are literally made<br/>from things like wood blocks, water sounds, thunder sounds, etc. ...I wanted it<br/>to flow like a liquid breakbeat but not have the qualities people who like<br/>classical music hate about breakbeats IE the blatantly aggressive/artificial<br/>nature of the drum sounds.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24817 href="#24817">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2011 10:55:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Say Michael I&apos;m listening to your piece again and my judgement is that you have &quot;won&quot;, because you did exactly what you set out to do, and very well.

I have been a long-time observer here and on the tuning List as well.  I am a professional composer who has been intrested in the study of Just Intonation for many years.  I have found traditional theories of Just Intonation to be wholly unsatisfactory for my compositional needs and the principles of functional harmony and have been observing the developments of Mr. Marcel DeVelde with a mixture of awe and chagrin.  I know he is not well-respected here but I have been studying his retunings of the Drei Equale closely and I have attained a great understanding from his methods.

It is a revolution and a revelation.  I have faithfully applied and perfected the principles first discovered by Mr. DeVelde, and have checked and re-checked the tuning exactly 63 times to be absolutely SURE there can be no mistakes.  I have rendered my composition with the best available software (Pianoteq and Lexicon PCM Native Reverb) and had a professional mastering job done by a studio whom I sadly cannot name at this point in time pending royalty negotiations.  I am certain the notoriously fastidious Mr. DeVelde will find its quality surpassing on his monitors which have revealed the deficiencies of all other audio posted here.

It is a revolution and a revelation.  I have faithfully<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; applied and perfected the principles first discovered by Mr.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; DeVelde, and have checked and re-checked the tuning exactly 63<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; times to be absolutely SURE there can be no mistakes.  I have<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; rendered my composition with the best available software (Pianoteq<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and Lexicon PCM Native Reverb) and had a professional mastering<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; job done by a studio whom I sadly cannot name at this point in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; time pending royalty negotiations.  I am certain the notoriously<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fastidious Mr. DeVelde will find its quality surpassing on his<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; monitors which have revealed the deficiencies of all other audio<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; posted here.  I am equally certain that upon hearing this piece,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the skeptics who have so long mocked and derided Mr. DeVelde shall<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; be rendered silent, and will hence forth show him the due respect!<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I will be posting more compositions in short order which will<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; hasten the revolution of musical theory that Mr. DeVelde<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; discovered and I have perfected.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Enjoy!<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; --Dr. Gilbert S.

Obviously (to real musicians at least) there is no difference between &quot;concept&quot; and &quot;practice&quot;, both are simply avatars of a higher thing altogether.</p><p>Anyway, the first section of this example is, in a way, a I-IV7-V7-V7/V7-V7-I. Just &quot;in a way&quot;.</p><p>Let&apos;s reword the root movement of &quot;I-ii-V-I&quot; in terms of generators and periods. That would be, in a meantone temperament,<br/>I-Generator*Generator(modulo Period)- Generator- I.</p><p>Now, in the regular temperaments which have been the primary focus of the Tuning List for years, the generator and period may be quite different from the tempered fifth and pure octave of the meantone temperaments with which we are familiar. So, what kinds of things happen if, rather than thinking of root movement in terms of diatonic steps, we think of it in terms of generator and period?</p><p>After all, the mixed tuning heritage of Western harmonic music, Pythagorean and Meantone, creates a situation in which it is difficult to distinguish between scalar identity and generator/period identity. The root movement of V, the principle structural unit of common practice music, is one and the same as &quot;generator&quot;.</p><p>I am not saying that root movement and generator/period movement are &quot;one&quot;. That&apos;s the mistake Marcel is making, and it is easy as pie to use irregular tunings and yet have clear harmonic movement, so the idea is easily disproven.</p><p>We&apos;re just doing something which is on one hand simply a &quot;what if&quot; thing, and on the other hand, a quick way to incorporate characteristic temperings-out. I-vi-ii-V-I in meantone for example demonstrates the tempering out of 81/80.</p><p>To make a long story short (gotta run), in the example posted, the first section is a kind of  &quot;I-IV7-V7-V7/V7-V7-I&quot;.</p><p>Spelled in generators and periods of a non-meantone temperament, though.</p><p>I= I<br/>IV = Period complement of Generator<br/>V = Generator<br/>V/V =Generator*Generator modulo Period<br/>V = Generator<br/>I= I</p><p>simple, really.</p><p>Hopefully this example will help demonstrate how radically different Godzilla temperament actually is from &quot;19tET&quot;, more later if anyone is interested.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that<br/>&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the MakeMicroMusic<br/>&gt; group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   File        : /Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3<br/>&gt;   Uploaded by : lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt;<br/>&gt;   Description : Example of &quot;chord progressions&quot; in &quot;godzilla temperment&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can access this file at the URL:<br/>&gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/files/Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html</a><br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=26679 href="#26679">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2011 10:22:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/files/Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3</a></p><p>A more extended piece in godzilla would be welcome if you feel so inspired.</p></div><h3><a id=26680 href="#26680">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2011 10:33:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/makemicromusic/files/Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/Lobawad/GodzillaExample.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A more extended piece in godzilla would be welcome if you feel so inspired.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Just grabbing a second here (X-files and rigging up my analogs for... cough...ambient soundscape work), I&apos;ll get to arguing with Carl later, and responding to your post on commas.</p><p>Yes I&apos;m considering whether to go with &quot;Godzilla&quot;, I like how the gruesomely wrong fake major third is way smoother in context than it has any right to be, or a burlier temperament.

But I guess I should provide some<br/>clarification about my earlier comment, being as the Red Cross has<br/>another &quot;donate for Japan!&quot; campaign out, and here I am bashing the<br/>Red Cross. I learned something about how all of this &quot;disaster relief&quot;<br/>funding works while I was down in Haiti. It&apos;s probably relevant here<br/>for anyone who wants to donate money so that they can get some insight<br/>into how this all works. I hope we can allow for a brief digression so<br/>that I can relate my experiences and allow everyone to make more<br/>informed decisions about where they donate to.</p><p>Although this is a fact of life that most Haitian citizens take for<br/>granted, the city is almost as messed up as it was the day the<br/>earthquake happened. It&apos;s completely in ruins. There&apos;s no rebuilding,<br/>people are still living in tents. As of last November, there were no<br/>cranes and bulldozers putting anything up, no construction at all.<br/>Driving around PAP at night was like driving around San Fran or Miami<br/>600 years from now. Like you&apos;re driving through a 21st century Machu<br/>Picchu or something.</p><p>I went to Port Au Prince twice, the second time staying for a month<br/>and a half and serving as the IT director of Bernard Mevs hospital.<br/>The hospital I worked at was and still is the most technologically<br/>advanced hospital in Haiti. And that&apos;s not saying much. We had a<br/>$600,000 telemedicine room that Cisco donated to us (which was never<br/>used once, and could have been replaced with a laptop and Skype), but<br/>we didn&apos;t have surgical meshes. We had a little telemedicine robot<br/>that could run around and do stuff, but we didn&apos;t have diapers for the<br/>babies. We had one broken ECG and we had to try and fix it in an<br/>emergency situation with, I shit you not, guitar strings for<br/>conductive material and duct tape. At one point, the ECG fell and<br/>broke to pieces, and we put it back together to find that one of the<br/>plastic pins had been discarded in the trash - one of the nurses put<br/>on two pairs of gloves and went into a contaminated red biohazard<br/>trash can to find it. I&apos;m not going to tell you what was written on<br/>top of the trash can. We also had no x-ray for most of my stay.</p><p>And this is the best hospital in the country. Despite its problems, it<br/>was functional. The General Hospital, on the other hand, is best<br/>described as being a place worse than hell. I will spare you the<br/>specifics of what went down there and the publically owned labor<br/>hospital. The Haitian doctors working there had no salary and were<br/>basically working for free. Then they stopped working, because they<br/>were also living in tents and couldn&apos;t afford to work for free. Then<br/>they stopped taking American volunteers because of some Haitian pride<br/>thing, which as Jon pointed out is yet another complexity going on<br/>with all of this. So it just sucks all around.</p><p>So not only is construction down there not happening, but the state of<br/>Haiti&apos;s medical care is that the most technologically advanced<br/>hospital in it has no diapers, one McGyver&apos;d and busted single-lead<br/>ECG, no x-ray, and a cholera epidemic to deal with. Meanwhile, the<br/>publically owned General Hospital has no money to pay their doctors.</p><p>But this is even with the Red Cross and the US&apos;s massively &quot;pledged&quot;<br/>donation figures helping out, right?

Well,<br/>right before I left, at the end of November, the American Red Cross<br/>finally came down and hooked us up with somewhere between $1-2 mil,<br/>which was supposed to last us for the year - provided we can prove<br/>that we&apos;ll be able to sustain ourselves after that. So we finally got<br/>enough to keep us afloat for a year, but probably not enough to buy<br/>the stuff we need. And this is under the stipulation that we can &quot;be<br/>sustainable&quot; in a year (hint: nothing in Haiti will be sustainable in<br/>a year unless you pump money into the economy down there RIGHT NOW),<br/>so we have to start charging patients more and effectively deny care<br/>to the poorest class, which defeats the whole purpose of emergency aid<br/>relief to begin with. But I shouldn&apos;t complain, because the GH, which<br/>is several orders of magnitude larger than our hospital, got a measly<br/>$4 million over one year.</p><p>Insofar as emergency disaster aid relief care is supposed to be going<br/>anywhere, it should be going to the GH. This place is several times<br/>larger than us and is legally not allowed to turn patients away (this<br/>place is hell on earth). I&apos;d rather them have just given us nothing<br/>and put all of the funds at the GH. Or merged the two hospitals<br/>together. The GH needs more than $4  million for one year to get<br/>running. 4 mil is nothing. This is THE hospital in Haiti. $4 mil is<br/>about $300k a month, and there are hundreds and hundreds of patients<br/>in this hospital (might have been into 1,000, wish I could remember<br/>the exact number). They don&apos;t even have working power there, it goes<br/>in and out.</p><p>So I don&apos;t know where in the hell the relief money is going if it isn&apos;t going to<br/>- Funding medical care in Haitian medical hospitals<br/>- Rebuilding anything at all<br/>- Getting people out of the tent cities or even giving supplies to the<br/>tent cities</p><p>Nobody down there has any idea where all of these supposed hundreds of<br/>millions of dollars are going. All we knew is that it wasn&apos;t going to<br/>us. And the news reports are finally starting to reflect the reality<br/>down in the field, which is that there is no money coming.</p><p>The point: Apparently this is not a one-off incident with the Red<br/>Cross. Down in the volunteer community it&apos;s pretty well known that<br/>there is a disparity between the Red Cross&apos;s press releases and the<br/>harsh reality that occurs in situations like these. They&apos;ve been<br/>criticized for sitting on funds like this time and time again, and I<br/>hope they don&apos;t do the same thing here in Japan. So just like now I&apos;m<br/>talking about how they still haven&apos;t given funds properly to Haiti,<br/>apparently when the Haiti earthquake hit they were criticized for<br/>still not having given funds properly to aid in the Indian Ocean<br/>tsunami before that. They will often claim that they&apos;re &quot;saving it for<br/>longer-term development,&quot; which is the stupidest possible strategy<br/>that you could take in the face of disaster relief.</p><p>So that is why I asked Daniel if he knew where I could donate to. I am<br/>only one person involved here, and I hope that I and the other<br/>volunteers that I&apos;d speak to about this are wrong, and that that money<br/>that was donated is somehow being used productively. But at this<br/>point, it is my personal preference to give funds directly to the<br/>organizations that are doing work, instead of going through glorified<br/>middlemen like the Red Cross.</p><p>If anyone has any other questions about Haiti let&apos;s please take it to<br/>metatuning so that I don&apos;t detract from Daniel&apos;s efforts to raise<br/>awareness about the situation in Japan over here.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=27026 href="#27026">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2011 8:22:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Daniel,</p><p>On Fri, Mar 18, 2011 at 12:34 AM, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;<a href="mailto:dan.for@tiscali.cz">dan.for@tiscali.cz</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mar 18, 2011, at 2:09 PM, Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, why not consider a row from a higher level, where you can<br/>&gt; &gt; work with<br/>&gt; &gt; serial ordering of motifs instead of individual notes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly this is my attitude, I combine melodic cells which each has<br/>&gt; its own character and together they make 12tone row.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I might have been clearer--I was talking about note groups of any size,<br/>including possibly larger than 12 pitches, and there is plenty of repetition<br/>allowed...for example, working with diatonic letters, I might have a list of<br/>lists:</p><p>[ [a,b,c,], [d,e,f], [a,b,c], [g,e,c], [c,e,g,a], [f,e,d], [a,b,c,d],<br/>[f,d,e,c], [a,b], [c] ]</p><p>I might shuffle the order of these motifs to get different serial<br/>permutations, but preserve their local order, i.e. [f,d,e,c] will always be<br/>[f,d,e,c] but it might appear first in the larger list....of course, one<br/>could then &quot;flatten&quot; the list after such a procedure, and do the usual I, R,<br/>and RI  operations, as well as transposition, etc.</p><p>The key idea is that &apos;shuffling&apos; to get different permutations happens at a<br/>larger list level, and the smaller lists are what is getting shuffled, so<br/>their internal order is preserved. And a list can have a single element.</p><p>Another, simpler extension of serial thinking is to shuffle a list that has<br/>plenty of repeated notes, e.g. [a,b,a,c,b,c,d,f,d,d,g,a,e,f,e] viewed as an<br/>abstract set.

They split the difference between 6/5 and 7/6. At this point I should mention that testing different intervals on innocent victims (say, whaddaya think of this?) has lead me to suspect that 13/11 and 14/11 are good descriptions of what expressive intonations of major and minor thirds in nominal 12-tET are. These are the intervals that stimulate responses like, yeah, that&apos;s really minor/major! Whereas going down or up, to about 7/6 or 9/7, invariably gets the whoa, that&apos;s blues/&quot;ethnic&quot; response.</p><p>24 offers a neutral interval, more related to a very large second I find. In more information-rich terms than those offered by the pseudo-scientific accuracy of using only cents, this proportion would be described as about 15:13. This tells us the nearest lowest coincident partials, presents the relative position in terms of lower partials (the mean of 8:7 and 7:6 in this case), and suggests &quot;bearing plans&quot; as well as compositional motions in terms of spectral voice-leading.</p><p>Put more briefly, it&apos;s a pretty sucky 7:6 but a very nice interval in its own right.</p><p>I think it&apos;s clear as to why close approximations to 7:6, such as that offered by 14, should look so good on paper and be so jarring when realized. If you check out the pattern of coincident partials in a pure 7:6, you&apos;ll find that it offers an interesting combination of coincidences within a pattern of strongly dissonant partial relationships, tending to ride quite a bit in critical band areas. So, by getting very close to 7:6, you lose the smoothing of the coincidences but keep the clanging of the dissonances. In combination with a doggy 9:7, 9:7 being an audible but not strong melding point in the first place, it&apos;s not suprising (in retrospect) that 14 offers a a clangorous sonority here.</p><p>By the way, have you inspected the &quot;consonant interval of Avicenna&quot;? At 196:169(256.6 cents) you can see that it is 14:13 stacked and pushing toward a &quot;bad 7:6&quot;. But I find it to be the earliest documented interval which qualifies in my opinion as consonant-by means of-asonance. I&apos;m curious as to what you think of it.</p></div><h3><a id=27161 href="#27161">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2011 6:58:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 24, 17, and 21 don&apos;t sound like 7/6 to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that 17 and 21 sound like very dark minor thirds, not subminor thirds.

I find that insisting on the row as an identity in itself means that what you actually wind up doing is establishing continuity through motif and intervallic palilogy, which are such powerful things that it is a shame to strap them down to insisting on the fixed identity of a row.</p><p>And the basic principle of the Schoenbergian approach is not really the row. It cannot be, for if it were, we would be forced to conclude that the guy was a bonehead, and our evidence would be what you have just presented: the Schoenbergian approach completely scuttles a realistic comprehension of the row.</p><p>What Schoenberg was after was a positive thing, the row was only a tool. The positive thing was not the destruction of tonality, which would be a negative thing of course, but the establishment of pan-tonality. All tones are equally &quot;at the center&quot;. This is an impossibility as you have mentioned before. Nevertheless it is a positive ideal, as blue-sky hippy and new-age as it may be (specifically Swedengborgian, as described by Schoenberg himself).</p><p>Obviously we can choose any interpretation of the row we&apos;d like, and really, if we lay aside idealistic concepts and concentrate on what can be more realistically implemented, of course you&apos;re right: the positive goal of row identity is far more realistic than the goal of &quot;pantonality&quot;.</p><p>This discussion orginated in Aaron&apos;s passing remark that the highly dissonant interval systems such as 11 and 13 equal divisions of the octave might have met approval by Schoenberg. This estimation is based on a simple failure to understand the difference between atonality and pantonality. Of course the failure is understandable, as pantonality is an ideal perhaps never achieved or even achievable, like &quot;totally peaceful total anacrchy, dude&quot;, or some such ideal.</p><p>Nevertheless we can propose appropriate alternative interval systems for implementing Schoenbergian ideals- I chose a highly inharmonic, but not harshly dissonant system of differentially-coherent tones, every tone being an octave of a first-order difference tone between two other tones in the system, that is, a kind of &quot;self-referential&quot; tuning. Surely this is a better representation of the Pleroma than either 12-tET or a system heavily unbalanced toward discord, and even in a brief and quickly-concocted example, I think  a hint of the potential for new work based on the Schoenbergian ideals is evident.</p><p>As you know, &quot;Schoenbergian&quot; and &quot;serial&quot; are not synonyms, and I imagine we&apos;re in agreement that things that might be suited for Schoenbergian serialism might very well be unsuited for other kinds of serialism, and vice versa.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Call me more conservative than inventor himself, but I think this<br/>&gt; attitude to serial music is wrong, and I don&apos;t like Schonberg<br/>&gt; dodecaphony and spreading notes of 12tone row among more instruments,<br/>&gt; that mix of vertical and horizontal.
