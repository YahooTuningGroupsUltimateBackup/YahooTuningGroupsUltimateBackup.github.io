Exactly what some people have been asking for.</p><p>One thing I note is they&apos;ve designed it to &quot;stretch more than four octaves with one hand&quot;.  It relates to an idea I had in the summer, when I dug out my Ztar for a few days. The thing is, a lot of keyboards try to copy the Halberstadt, using the same span but adding more notes.  I think it&apos;s better to target smaller octaves.</p><p>I know you (Carl) did a survey of microtonal keyboards a while back.  Firstly you wanted to finger a whole octave with one hand.  Secondly you didn&apos;t like hexagonal keys because they reduce the freedom you have to place your fingers.  My experience with the Ztar is that freedom isn&apos;t so important if it&apos;s really easy to finger the chords.  And for that to be the case the octaves have to be much smaller than they are on a piano.</p><p>I&apos;m going to conjecture now that for small keys the optimum layout is almost square.  The Ztar mapping I used had an octave on 5 &quot;frets&quot; across 6 &quot;strings&quot;.  This gives 30 notes, and so is the nearest you can get to having 31 notes in a square.</p><p>You can add as many duplicates to this as you like.  The point is that I&apos;m setting a maximum vertical span that relates to some guess on the expected horizontal span.</p><p>A Bosanquet layout usually copies the 7 white keys in a row, and adds other keys above or below them.  That would be most efficient for 7x7=49 keys.  As it was originally designed for 53, that&apos;s fairly logical.  But apply it to 31 and the octaves are too wide.  Apply it to 19 and they&apos;re way too wide.</p><p>So the solution is that Bosanquet used long, piano-like keys, rather than hexagonal ones.  The advantage is that you get the same freedom in finger placement as on a piano.  And the problem is that it gets harder to play weird chords that cover a large vertical distance.</p><p>So to hexagons!  The ideal 31 note layout would be based on a pentatonic, not a diatonic.  So it approaches that 6x5 square, with one extra note.</p><p>For a 19 note keyboard, you can still start with a pentatonic, and approach 4x5 with a note missing.</p><p>For a 12 note keyboard, even pentatonics are too big.  The ideal layout is 4x3.  And that looks like roughly what they&apos;re doing with this keyboard.  (Going by the picture, it&apos;s a triangular lattice, so a harmonic rather than melodic layout.)</p><p>&gt; Aaron Hunt knows more about the MIDI implementation than I do,<br/>&gt; but with some limitations I think it could be remapped.</p><p>It&apos;s all set up for the 12 note scale.  There has to be a way to differentiate what would normally be duplicate keys.

It looks too big to carry round.  How would retuning the 12 note output give any advantage over any other 12 note keyboard? Other than the general advantages they claim, of course.</p><p>A firmware change must be possible because there&apos;s a USB socket for it.  Frankly, how difficult would it be for them?   Change a lookup table probably.  It needn&apos;t ruin the harmonic layout.</p><p>They&apos;re supposed to be made to order, and the thread started with 19 note keyboards, so why not order one with key tops for 19 notes to the octave?  That&apos;d be a pretty neat microtonal device.  Ideal for 5-limit JI, 7-limit planar with 225:224 tempered out, meantone, magic, whatever. Completely generalized because the harmony&apos;s the same (but different bad chords with different tunings).</p><p>I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll say &quot;no&quot; anyway but if enough people are prepared to pay for a 19-note device I expect they&apos;d change their minds.  Who&apos;s up for it?  (Not me as I said.

But i want to stress that Wilson proposes more than one layout for even the same tuning.<br/>With an ET or EDO, one can interpret the scale as having more than one generator, each can result in a different layout. This is convenient and accents the actual material one is using. With a constant structure ( or PB) you can also look at the tuning in terms of being different variable linear series, hence generating different layouts. Like i have mentioned i have used multiple layouts over the years with even the same tuning.

Besides Holland there was Webster College in St. Louis which was promoting 31. His purpose was to strengthen existing movements as opposed to introduce newer opposing ones. Before this he had attempted to do the same thing with Partch. ( he did the diagrams for Genesis as well as helping with the construction of the quadraladis reversum. and the flute used in delusion was a gift to harry from him.</p><p>Even with the development of the Eikosany, he took pains to show its relationship with the diamond. Somewhere in Genesis HP did a chart of all the harmonic triads in the diamond. Wilson has mentioned to me that he believes this chart might have had a subconscious influence on him, and that HP can quite close to discovering the eikosany himself, if only he would have seen it in terms of products. It was probably his work with Chalmers looking for small pitch systems that had multiple meanings that lead to seeing this set in this way. SO i would say that Wilson has always seen his work as being interrelated to that of others. not to say the implications of those have confined him there.

That would be most &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;efficient for 7x7=49 keys.  As it was originally designed &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for 53, that&apos;s fairly logical.  But apply it to 31 and the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;octaves are too wide.  Apply it to 19 and they&apos;re way too wide.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;They are??<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;According to my conjecture, yes.<br/>&gt; &gt; On a typical Wilson-like keyboard, the width of the octave<br/>&gt; does not change from 31 to 53.</p><p>Yes.  But, eugh, the number of notes does.  If you keep the octaves small the complexity&apos;s going to splurge out in another direction.  So if you want to use all intervals there&apos;s a trade-off between the span and the number of notes.  With 53 notes a 7 key octave makes sense but with 19 notes it could be much smaller.</p><p>You *could* still use small octaves for big scales if all you want is simple scales with transpositions, and no duplication of notes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Made to order, with OSC (not MIDI).  $500 for 8x8, available now.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not as exciting but nice to know it&apos;s there.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s exciting if you want a lambdoma keyboard.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Oh, maybe.

This is why a different layout of a tuning can be useful. In the case of 31, your template can assure that the material you are going to use most is close by horizontally and still have close octaves. Close octaves are good also when you have tuned bars and pipes. where each note takes up more space. but here you can&apos;t go too deep cause it is hard to reach far back.</p><p>Graham Breed wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.
