I like the brads as you can feel them under your hands, and when it comes to intonation, cause thay&apos;re not frets you can still be flexible.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=6720 href="#6720">ðŸ”—</a>S V G &#x3C;vsyevolod@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2004 8:41:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have done a similar thing in reverse.  I tune my acoustic guitar in fifths, like a cello.<br/>CGDAEG (minor third on top).  The easiest way to to this is to get the correct gauge of string for<br/>each note.  This is important whether you want to tune your guitar like a cello, or your cello<br/>like a guitar.  Then string tension is maintained and tonal quality remains high.  Not to mention<br/>the instrument is not damaged from overtightening some of the strings.</p><p>     Finding specialty gauges can be daunting, though in this day and age of the Internet almost<br/>anything can be found.</p><p>     Stephen</p><p>&gt; I posted about &apos;cellos and viols but my post appears to be missing.
