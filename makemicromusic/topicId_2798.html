While better photos will have to wait (these were shot in the storage/basement area of Copley Symphony Hall), and audio of the music (as well as - hopefully - video) are pending delivery of the recordings from the concert, I wanted to at least share some of the fun of designing, building, and performing on some new microtonal instruments.</p><p>Bogus, slapped-together page for your enjoyment (I hope):</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/depot.html">http://www.microtonal.org/depot.html</a></p><p>Yours always,<br/>Jon (AKA ListMom)</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=2808 href="#2808">ðŸ”—</a>prentrodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2002 9:37:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

Please see what you can do to post the videos of &gt;this amazing collection in concert.</p><p>I&apos;ll work on that.</p><p>&gt;The tubes must have really sung out when hit by the padded mallets.</p><p>Yes, and a big resonant hall doesn&apos;t hurt! I did all this in my little enclosed patio, and only *hoped* that by pointing the business end of the tubes out toward the hall that is would throw the sound. It did.</p><p>&gt;The keys must have sounded so light and clear, like a bell tree but less &gt;harsh.</p><p>They are awful delicate, and in this situation were mostly a metallic little breeze. But I&apos;ve used a similar (larger) set in recording studios for years.</p><p>&gt;I can&apos;t wait to see the Home Depot sequence. People must have thought you &gt;guys were out of your minds.</p><p>I had no idea the great response it would get, and big kudos to Ralph Chaney, the videographer. I&apos;ve never had so many orchestra members remarking on the coolness of something we did!</p><p>&gt;We used to go to a salvage yard in San Diego to find our aluminum and &gt;steel wonders, and to a barrel store that just sold used 55 gallon oil &gt;drums. Lots of fun.</p><p>Yeah, and it&apos;s getting harder and harder to find places you can just &apos;slum&apos;. But I found a great surplus place where you can buy nuts, bolts, and all manner of fasteners *by the pound* - orders of magnitude cheaper than at hardware emporiums.</p><p>&gt;San Diego Hardware has the best collection of spring steel I have ever &gt;found, and they would sell it by the inch.</p><p>I love that place! We just used a washboard I bought there in tonight&apos;s performance of &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; to double the guiro part and give it some low end moxie. Very effective...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2828 href="#2828">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2002 1:51:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

In reality, how they *looked* was as important as how they sounded (does that aesthetic ring a proverbial bell?). But that doesn&apos;t mean that everything was brand-new, because a fair amount of the construction materials was gotten from a wonderful place: Habitat Restore, which is an operation run by Habitat for Humanity. They take discarded, excess, and donated building materials and supplies and sell it at low cost to low-income homeowners/builders, etc. All proceeds go into the Habitat home-building programs.</p><p>I like that. :)</p><p>&gt;The saw blade was a little frightening.
