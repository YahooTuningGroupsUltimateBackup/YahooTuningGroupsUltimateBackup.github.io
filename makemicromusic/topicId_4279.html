I think it&apos;s one of<br/>the most significant developments of the past few years.

(I&apos;ve had it for quite a while, and it<br/>finally reached the top of my pile of stuff to read!) Sethares has written<br/>a good book, packed with lots of interesting info. I think it&apos;s really<br/>applicable to working musicians/composers, and most of it is quite<br/>accessible.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
