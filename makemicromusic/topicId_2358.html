I appreciate the info on the latter, do you know<br/>if it was used and the response! With any slide one can put marks by<br/>attaching a rod which goes over a place where the player can see. I saw John<br/>Crawford (who worked with Partch on Delusion at least) with square organ<br/>pipes with a slide put inside. he added a part that went extended over the<br/>body so when you blew you could mark on the body where you wanted to slide<br/>to, or whatever.
