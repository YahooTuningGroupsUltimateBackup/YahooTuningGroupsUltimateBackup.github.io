Aaron,<br/>your question about the &quot;ingredients&quot; gives me an opportunity to<br/>explain how your piece, Alberto, is connected to this one:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForAnnika_I.ogg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForAnnika_I.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForAnnika_I.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/ForAnnika_I.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Here&apos;s the scale for the piece, which like many medieval European<br/>pieces uses both B-natural and Bb as regular steps:</p><p>         240<br/>          Bb<br/>   G    A     B   C     D    E   F     G<br/>   0   180   420 480   720  900 960  1200</p><p>This is in 20-EDO, with a whole-tone equal to either 240 cents or<br/>180 cents, and a regular semitone equal to 60 cents -- a very<br/>pleasant and efficient size. A small tone plus a large one makes<br/>a usual major third of 420 cents, quite close to a just 14:11.</p><p>One fun thing about this scale is that in addition to usual minor<br/>thirds like A-C or E-G at 300 cents, we have &quot;quasi-thirds&quot; like<br/>D-F at 240 cents -- the same size as a large major second! These<br/>are at once a bit &quot;surprising&quot; and musically effective, as in<br/>this common two-voice figure moving from fifth to third to unison:</p><p>   G   F   E<br/>   C   D   E</p><p>One trick for this piece was choosing a timbre that might be<br/>pleasing to Annika: I decided on a &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; timbre that at<br/>once reminds me a bit of a portative or positive organ and gives<br/>a smoother quality to the 720-cent fifths of 20-EDO.</p><p>Thank you, Aaron and Alberto, for your encouraging feedback --<br/>and I guess we&apos;ll have to see how Annika likes it.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
