A good encapsulation of why I have never allowed myself to be<br/>&gt; considered a microtonalist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a musician.</p><p>Agreed. That&apos;s why I never have jumped on to the &apos;anything but 12&apos; bandwagon.<br/>There are still some things that are best said in 12-equal....but I can&apos;t<br/>agree that one can always assume to know a composer&apos;s inner motivation or<br/>intention when they set out to write unless they say it explicitly, so I much<br/>prefer to rephrase what Dan said for myself, and say that I prefer those<br/>musicians/composers whose product is obviously the result of a fertile<br/>imagination and quality workmanship/musicianship; I really don&apos;t care about<br/>their fetishes one way or the other with regards to 12 vs. not-12. And I also<br/>prefer infinitely the label &quot;musician&quot; to &quot;microtonalist&quot;, but to each his<br/>own, and I don&apos;t really think about it all that much, what counts is the<br/>quality of the work in the end. Does it move me, make me smile, laugh out<br/>loud, cry, jump around, daydream, or does it leave me neutral, wanting to hit<br/>fast-forward, or turn me off? That&apos;s how I judge.</p><p>Having said that, *my* interest in microtonal techniques of various sorts<br/>stems from the fact that it broadens my expressive and emotional palette to<br/>let in new as-yet-unnamed emotions and harmonic colors, etc. I&apos;m often<br/>excited listen back to Divide by Pi&apos;s latest improv, and Andy and I laugh out<br/>loud, saying---&quot;that&apos;s a great chord, and no-one else probably ever played<br/>that chord&quot;. Okay, maybe a small handful of people have. In particular, I&apos;m<br/>thinking of the chords in the middle section of &quot;Schwartzenkurosawa&quot; from<br/>about 2&apos;45&quot; to about 3&apos;40&quot;. Most of those precise colors cannot be found in<br/>12-equal by a long shot, and they are very nice colors to hear. But, knowing<br/>where we are here, I&apos;m preaching to the choir. *Everyone here* is here<br/>because they are interested in that expanded palette.</p><p>Anyway, Dan, I&apos;m wondering if you have a particular example of a composer(s)<br/>who is(are) writing microtonal music for the sake of writing microtonal music<br/>that spells &quot;less interesting&quot; to you (provided it&apos;s safe to do so)?</p><p>BTW, &apos;Pengy&apos; has a really strong &quot;psychedelic otherness&quot; to it. I really<br/>enjoyed it. It was kind of lo-fi and clicky-distorted -- on purpose?</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div>
