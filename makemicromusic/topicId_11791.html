Why do some people love &quot;Boston&quot;<br/>  and hate the &quot;Bee Gees&quot;? These people must believe that at least<br/>  2 genres exist.</p><p>  Stephen</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; IMO, this entire line of thinking (creating a new genre) is<br/>rediculous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Everything* that has ever been made is derivative from that which<br/>&gt; came before.  The psychological effect of something being &quot;new&quot; is<br/>the<br/>&gt; result of a gestalt perception of the whole, which as an entity is<br/>new<br/>&gt; and unique, although composed of pre-existing, derivative elements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If there were only one tone and one rythm possible in the entire<br/>&gt; universe, humanity could spend eternity making new and exciting<br/>music<br/>&gt; from that, complete with genres and all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2006 10:35:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rozencrantz the Sane<br/>&lt;rozencrantz@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  Rozencrantz</p><p>Even the largest innovative leaps of John<br/>&gt; Butcher or the Trance movements came from a very clear progression</p><p>  Has anyone ever put anything on-line showing (in a diagram)<br/>  where the &apos;blues&apos; started and what branched off of that, and<br/>  what of that etc. etc.<br/>  Polkas,disco, rock, barber shop, and all the rest.</p><p>  Also, I don&apos;t know what a BnP is.</p><p>  Stephen</p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2006 11:25:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt;<br/>wr</p><p>Stephen,<br/>&gt; On your questions: there&apos;s always something new to do<br/>&gt; with the same old resources; it&apos;s just that most people<br/>&gt; spend their lives repeating the mistakes of others!<br/>&gt; (And I&apos;d rather make my own mistakes, thank you.)</p><p>+++++ I was taught to &quot;let the other guy make mistakes and learn&quot;.<br/> Could never find him though.
