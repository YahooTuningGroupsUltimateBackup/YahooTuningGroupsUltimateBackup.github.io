We often hang out and talk about La Monte<br/>Young, Rod Poole, John Abercrombie and Morton Feldman. This<br/>is his first recorded piece and it is both mesmerizing and slightly<br/>disturbing. It is titled, &quot;As Beautiful as a Crescent of a New Moon<br/>on a Cloudless Spring Evening&quot;. It was inspired by Morton Feldman<br/>and &quot;tuned to the system known as Just Intonation&quot;. It is 30-minutes<br/>long and it is filled with long, slowly see-sawing drones that make me<br/>feel as if I am aboard a ship slowly floating on the waves. Since this<br/>piece changes slowly, it is more environmental in sound. Just let it flow<br/>and take you along with it. I love the way the notes shimmer and float<br/>like feathers on the air. You can actually observe the texture of each<br/>sound as it slowly evolves. Although I did enjoy the other pieces here<br/>by Morton Feldman and the other lesser-known composers, I felt the<br/>Beardsley piece was the most fascinating of the bunch. - BLG</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a></p></div>
