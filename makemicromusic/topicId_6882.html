Hearing &quot;cubist&quot;<br/>or &quot;extended language&quot; notes as &quot;wrong&quot; notes, essentially is mis-<br/>hearing or mis-understanding the language.</p><p>There are no &quot;wrong notes&quot; in Prokoffiev, sorry.</p><p>It&apos;s just like microtonality.  If you *hear* the microtones,<br/>specifically, you&apos;re not really hearing the piece, as in &quot;wow, these<br/>are weird...&quot;</p><p>If it&apos;s all part of the fabric, then you&apos;re &quot;speaking the language&quot;<br/>so to speak.</p><p>Just my personal opinion (which might be expected, since I happen to<br/>be writing this...)  :)</p><p>J.
