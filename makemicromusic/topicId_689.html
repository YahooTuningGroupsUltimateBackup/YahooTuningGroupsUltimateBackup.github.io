Sorry to hear that, and I hope<br/>things work better for you!  Actually, I went ahead anyway and just<br/>ordered it, since it&apos;s already $50 more than it was last month, and<br/>and a few days the &quot;discount&quot; will disappear entirely...</p><p>But thanks for investigating the tuning part of it.</p><p>In any case, I think I will find it useful, since I was bemoaning<br/>with my recent theatre experience the fact that I couldn&apos;t make some<br/>sound effects in the &quot;old way&quot; by plugging in synth modules as we<br/>used to do in the ancient &quot;old days...&quot;</p><p>However, with this software, it looks as though one can do this same<br/>thing... but the modules are represented by graphics on the screen.</p><p>We&apos;ll see what happens.... Thanks, Rick!</p><p>____________ ___________ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
