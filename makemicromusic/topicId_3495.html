Wasn&apos;t Scala available only for Windows until recently?</p><p>Metasynth comes with a library of a few hundred scales, and you can write your own. The scale<br/>library was provided by Andrew Souter, according to the MetaSynth manual. I met both of the U&amp;I<br/>Software people (Eric Wenger and Edward Spiegel) and I don&apos;t feel that they would intentionally<br/>rip anyone off, but I don&apos;t know where Andrew came up with the tuning files.</p><p>Michael Vannice</p><p>&gt; Message: 10<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2002 11:37:44 -0400<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;X.
