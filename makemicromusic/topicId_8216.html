It implements a way of<br/>letting the user just select CSound instruments<br/>from a drop list or menu like Midi. You can even<br/>set a pan value for each instrument - and<br/>add reverb well - all just by selecting options<br/>in the GUI. So it is very user friendly, you don&apos;t<br/>need to even look at a line of CSound code to use it.</p><p>You can then render to audio or you can play individual<br/>isntruments in real time using CSoundAV. (That last<br/>possibility requires one to relay the notes to<br/>CSoundAV via a midi relaying program at least<br/>at present - well you can set CSoundAV to<br/>receive the notes from your midi keyboard<br/>but if one is retuning it via software and pitch<br/>bends, then you would need to relay from your<br/>retuning software).</p><p>It works by adding extra sections to the now standard<br/>unified CSound file - and works for all the instrumentrs<br/>I&apos;ve tried it for.</p><p>Preparing the instruments for FTS to use in the first<br/>place is a bit techy. But the extra sections only need to be<br/>added the one time, and after that the instrument can be<br/>selected in the normal way. I&apos;ll have many example instruments<br/>in the release which are already prepared in this way<br/>so the user can try it out straight away.<br/>Of course users could also share instruments<br/>that they have modified in this way to make<br/>them into ones that can be built up to make<br/>orchestras automatically.</p><p>Actually you can already play instruments in<br/>CSoundAV with a bit of preparation to make<br/>them Midi aware. I can give an example instrument<br/>to show how it is done and to try it out<br/>if you are interested. The next release for<br/>FTS will let one play any of the selected<br/>instruments in CSoundAV one at a time.</p><p>That also gets around the problem of pitch bend<br/>artefacts for the pitch bending method for those<br/>who get them - because a soft synth properly<br/>programmed needn&apos;t have them and CSoundAV certainly<br/>doesn&apos;t have any when you use it in this way.</p><p>FTS 3.0 will also have options to<br/>record to CSound and then render<br/>ones recording, again without<br/>the need to look at a line<br/>of CSound code.</p><p>There&apos;s no reason why other<br/>programs shouldn&apos;t do this too.<br/>I&apos;m happy to share the techniques<br/>and explain how it is done or<br/>give example code for anyone<br/>who is interested after the<br/>release.</p><p>More later.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8217 href="#8217">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2004 10:26:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_8216.html#8216">/makemicromusic/topicId_8216.html#8216</a></p><p>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***And it&apos;s really only &quot;geek-friendly&quot; with all apologies...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope to help remedy that wiht the next release of<br/>&gt; Fractal Tune Smithy :-).</p><p>***Hello Robert!</p><p>This looks like a welcome, and well-needed development...</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3><a id=8219 href="#8219">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2004 6:12:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>&gt; ***Hello Robert!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This looks like a welcome, and well-needed development...</p><p>Great!</p><p>Actually I have just discovered something else<br/>about using CSoundAV to play microtonal music.</p><p>Csound Instruments usually expect the frequency<br/>information to be given to them as a parameter<br/>which means they get the frequency when the note<br/>starts only (it is recieved at the &quot;instruction rate&quot;).</p><p>This has the effect that normal CSound instruments<br/>converted to work in CSAV usually<br/>don&apos;t respond to the pitch bend wheel<br/>- though you can usually re-write<br/>those instruments to respond to it by<br/>changing the frequency to a k (control)<br/>rate variable and bypassing the parameter<br/>assignment at the head of the instrument.</p><p>Anyway that is a disadvantage of course, but<br/>also an advantage. The advantage is that you<br/>can then build up almost unlimited pitch polyphony<br/>in any part by just sending the appropriate<br/>pitch bend before the next note to be played.</p><p>Well it is limited to 128 pitch bends played<br/>simultaneously in each channel - and<br/>there is a limit on how close together<br/>the notes can cluster - you can play<br/>no more than about 12 notes per octave<br/>- and to have many notes in a small<br/>pitch region, you can have up to<br/>five notes nearly identical in pitch<br/>like this:</p><p>60 bent up by 2 semitones<br/>61 bent up by 1<br/>62 no bend<br/>63 bent down by 1<br/>64 bent down by 2</p><p>But compared to normal midi that<br/>is virtually unlimited :-).<br/>I just tried it out in the<br/>debugger in FTS, and it<br/>does work.</p><p>I read somewhere that that way<br/>of responding to pitch bends is<br/>valid for a mid synth - it is just<br/>never implemented because usually<br/>you want it to respond to the pitch<br/>bend wheel which is higher prioirity<br/>than permitting pitch bend polyphony<br/>in every channel. Anyway with<br/>CSoundAV with the instruments programmed,<br/>one can explore this pitch polyphony<br/>idea for interpreting pitch bends.</p><p>I&apos;m now thinking about how to<br/>make that available to the<br/>user in FTS for auto building the<br/>orchestra.</p><p>Then, with that option then it will almost<br/>be as good as using tuning tables.</p><p>You can also set up the<br/>CSound instruments with tuning<br/>tables too - using a format<br/>very like the Scala one<br/>with a 1/1 pitch and<br/>a scale specified,<br/>which can be non octave.</p><p>That is fine if you are keeping<br/>to the same tuning all the way through<br/>but is no good if you want<br/>to change the tuning interactively<br/>during the piece, or want to<br/>use a tuning which has more than<br/>128 notes in it in total<br/>(e.g. one of the high number n-ets)<br/>or is open ended (like my fibonacci<br/>tone scapes).</p><p>Anyway thought you might be interested<br/>in that development too.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=8220 href="#8220">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2004 6:17:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Joseph,</p><p>BTW that is just for the midi relaying.<br/>When recording retuned music<br/>directly to CSound then FTS 2.0<br/>will be able to record the notes with unlimited<br/>pitch polyphony, and with the exact<br/>pitches too, not limited even to the<br/>midi pitch bend resolution, instead<br/>to the limits of CSounnd precision<br/>(and you can now generate audio<br/>with the values accurate to 64 bit precision<br/>in CSound - FTS also uses 64 bit precision<br/>when calculating the pitches to save).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
