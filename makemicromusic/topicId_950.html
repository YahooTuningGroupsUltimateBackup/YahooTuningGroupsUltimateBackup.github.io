I&apos;d like to<br/>project images, which respond to midi and audio controls, from a<br/>video player onto a large screen during live performance.</p><p>I found two software programs on the MAC side that will do this.  One<br/>is called VideoDelic, by the same people who make metasynth, and it<br/>has a lot of editing possibilites.  Right now I&apos;m playing with it on<br/>the computer and it looks pretty good.</p><p>The other program is Arkaos, which people seem to think looks better<br/>on a large screen.  I&apos;m playing with that too and I&apos;ll probably end<br/>up using both in the new studio.</p><p>I love watching images move to my music - it is very trance<br/>inducing!  My favorite program on the computer for this is G_Force,<br/>which works on both Mac and PC.  Its free, runs in WinAmp and we use<br/>it as a screensaver.  It does respond to midi messages - its only<br/>problem is the resolution isn&apos;t good enough for large screen.  But<br/>for personal entertainment can&apos;t be beat.</p><p>You can find it at <a href="http://www.55ware.com/gforce/download.html">http://www.55ware.com/gforce/download.html</a></p><p>Highly recommended.</p><p>What software are you using Jacky?  Have you bought a video camera<br/>yet?</p><p>I think your DVD&apos;s will do well - if there is any upside to the<br/>events of September 11 it may be that many more people are opening to<br/>spirit and to the idea of other dimensions and existences.</p><p>Another mass learning and evolving through trauma on Schoolship Earth.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
