I do not understand why you posted the reply to my posting because I think I wrote more or less the same. If you look at my posting, you see that I wrote there are two different viewpoints - the one of the performing musician (which is obviously yours) and the one of the music theorist. And if you remember, just a short while ago Ozan Yarman had written about his qanun tuned to his 79-tone MOS of 159EDO, which he had showed to several musicians, and IIRC he wrote the musicians&apos; reactions were very positive, amongst other things because apparently there is currently always a big problem whenever maqam musicians want to play together and have to tune their instruments so they match each other, and such a tuning standard could make their lifes much easier. So, obiously music theory can be useful, which does, also obviously, not mean the performing musicians have to know it. In this sense, I cannot but restate that both viewpoints are right and necessary. Actually, I thought my posting was quite balanced - that&apos;s why I do not understand why you felt it necessary to write that reply.</p><p>Hans Straub</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Hey Hans...I read your enclosed link, and not sure what point you&apos;re trying to make....I still stand 100% by what I said.

Of course, LaMonte Young got into minimalism, as did others...but a lot of the thinking seems to be connected to breaking away from traditional classical forms and thinking (oversimplifying here to make a point). But, when we take blues/jazz/bluegrass/rock/reggae/electronica, and other non classical forms into consideration, it&apos;s a different story...then sonata form, string quartets, and other concepts associated with European classical thought don&apos;t have near as much importance, and different sorts of ideas are introduced. Of course, it&apos;s all music...but a one chord blues tune (&quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;) or a bop progression may lead one to different ways of thinking about non 12 tunings. I think one of the best things to have happened in the last few years is the introduction of these non classical forms into the tuning field...it makes it potentially more accessible for a wider range of people...good discussion...Hstick   <a href="http://www.myspace.com/microstick">www.myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Hotmail: Trusted email with Microsoft&#xFFFD;s powerful SPAM protection.<br/><a href="http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/201469226/direct/01/">http://clk.atdmt.com/GBL/go/201469226/direct/01/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2010 2:24:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Hans,</p><p>Nice of you to mention me. We have hereabouts a more emphasized<br/>standpoint consigning the role of theory to solely explaining the<br/>music made. However, music theory&apos;s function cannot be reduced to just<br/>defining practiced intervals, scales and harmonies after a certain<br/>point in the historical development of music. At some stage, theory<br/>evolves to a level which licenses it to GUIDE music-making as much as<br/>music had previously DEFINED the scope of theory. It becomes a<br/>continuous loop from this point forth. Europe and its satellites have<br/>entered into this loop four or five centuries ago.
