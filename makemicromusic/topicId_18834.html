Your tonalsoft reference doesn&apos;t explain anything<br/>&gt; however bizarre one construes it. But please, spread your petty<br/>&gt; jealousy around. The more the merrier.</p><p>What is &quot;bizarre&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. And it certainly<br/>explained something to me. If you don&apos;t understand the tonalsoft<br/>reference, I&apos;ll explain it to you:</p><p>A linear temperament has two &quot;generators&quot;. One of them is the octave,<br/>and the other can be any interval at all, rational or irrational, with<br/>any cent value. Every interval in a linear temperament can be created<br/>by stacking the generating interval on top of itself for however many<br/>times you&apos;d like, and putting it down in the same octave as the<br/>starting note.</p><p>1/4-comma meantone, for example, is a linear temperament, as it&apos;s just<br/>the result of taking a 696-cent interval, labeling it to be a &quot;fifth,&quot;<br/>and stacking it on top of each other 12 times or however many times<br/>you would like. So is 1/3-comma meantone, and in fact, any meantone<br/>system. There are other linear temperaments as well - namely the<br/>&quot;schismatic&quot; and &quot;magic&quot; temperaments and &quot;miracle&quot; temperaments, to<br/>name a few. What you have done is to vary the size of the generating<br/>interval, which means that you have developed a system to generate any<br/>linear temperament on the fly. It&apos;s certainly interesting, but not the<br/>first time the concept has been realized - Erv Wilson was studying<br/>linear temperaments years ago, and it&apos;s he who coined the term. The<br/>Scala software can generate linear temperaments as well and retune<br/>MIDI data or files on the fly to utilize them as well, and can go<br/>beyond 12 pitches per octave as well as pitches that don&apos;t cycle every<br/>octave if necessary.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
