Versions are uploaded for classical<br/>guitar and piano as MIDI files and an mp3 using Logic&apos;s Classical<br/>Guitar sample.</p><p>I&apos;ve become very fond of 9ET while working on this. I first saw<br/>9ET in its relation to 12ET as three augmented triads, where the<br/>scale steps between them could only be used as m2 / M7s but<br/>not as M2 / m7. I found this works pretty well, and the rules can also<br/>be bent a little. Major and minor thirds both work well, and the minor has<br/>a nice septimal resonance. The fifths have to be used with caution<br/>harmonically, but melodically and in arpeggios I find the sound of the<br/>4ths and 5ths exciting, and I used lots of circle of fifths progressions.<br/>Feedback welcome as always, and of course I&apos;m interested to hear<br/>other things in 9ET, so please alert me. Enjoy!</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2007 9:48:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Don&apos;t mean to chime in just to say your music reminds me of<br/>some famous classical piece or another, but this reminds me<br/>in a bizarre way of &quot;Thou shalt break them&quot; from the Messiah.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>At 01:21 PM 6/28/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;New piece written over the past few days, uploaded here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Prelude in 9ET is my first effort in this tuning, a slow dance piece<br/>&gt;in 6/8, about 6 minutes long.
