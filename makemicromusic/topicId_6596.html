However, my<br/>main deprivation is not being able to hear _other_ people&apos;s music made<br/>available here in computer formats, a gift to our community<br/>supplementing CD&apos;s which I can and should get (e.g. Aaron Johnson).<br/>There&apos;s a spontaneity in being able to post and share these files,<br/>whether of &quot;works in progress&quot; or of finished pieces, that can inform,<br/>educate, and inspire our creative energy all around.</p><p>Also, as to what I&apos;m doing here, what I&apos;d call timbrally sensitive<br/>tunings and pieces can sometimes be a special source of frustration<br/>when it comes to this sharing process. If I had a means of promptly<br/>recording and posting my experiments, I&apos;d be doing this right now for<br/>14-tET and also another very exciting tuning that has made me look at<br/>diatonic or &quot;quasi-diatonic&quot; semitones from a new viewpoint, possibly<br/>confirming some tendencies of which certain people are aware.</p><p>If I could record digitally from synthesizer to CD, and also to an<br/>audio file format, that would solve the problem of getting my music<br/>out there. A sound card and audio software for MS-DOS 6.22, or a<br/>32-bit DOS-based environment such as DJGPP, would solve the listening<br/>problem. However, I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s out there for MS-DOS -- or for a<br/>command-line UNIX-compatible OS and environment (Linux?). Since with<br/>DJGPP I&apos;m already accustomed to lots of UNIX-like commands, I should<br/>at least mention the latter option.</p><p>At least with a piece like the one which Rick and Gene have so<br/>generously made available, I can play it on synthesizer, and indeed<br/>would like to get my keyboard interpretation out there in an audio<br/>file and eventually on CD -- the latter, especially, leaving room for<br/>a lot of practice, perfecting, and general refinement of my keyboard<br/>technique.</p><p>Of course, even with such a piece, the more renditions and<br/>instrumentations I hear, the better, both to appreciate what I&apos;ve done<br/>and to consider what I might do.</p><p>Thank you, Gene and Rick, for your help in making my piece available<br/>to lots of listeners; and Jon, for your support in considering the<br/>problem of how I might better hear what others are doing here, and<br/>also share my music online.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6610 href="#6610">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2004 6:45:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Please let me say to both of you that while I&apos;d love to have some<br/>&gt; convenient means of hearing an mp3 or ogg file, the really important<br/>&gt; thing is that other people can now hear it, thanks to your generosity,<br/>&gt; Gene, and also Rick&apos;s in doing an mp3 version (which someone played to<br/>&gt; me over the telephone).</p><p>Could you tell us what kind of computer(s) you have available, and in<br/>particular if there is something you can jack headphones into, or<br/>speakers, or both, connected to it?

In order to help you, I&apos;d need to know the<br/>following pieces of info:</p><p>1) Your current computer hardware situation. How old, processor speed, memory,<br/>etc.</p><p>2) Your current OS. I assume some flavor of Unix, as you have mentioned using<br/>Linux/using the Lynx browser, and a non-GUI environment (ancient equipment?)</p><p>3) your internet bandwidth. (phone line dial-up, DSL, cable modem? I&apos;m<br/>assuming the first (56k modem) ?)</p><p>There are interesting command line audio tools in Linux which are quite<br/>flexible and usable (ecasound, sox, aplay/arecord in alsa, I also have<br/>written some Python based command-line tools for midi and microtonal<br/>composition, whch I could pass along, etc.)</p><p>If you are using old hardware and a non-GUI environment, get Linux and get new<br/>life out of it.
