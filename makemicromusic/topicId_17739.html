But maybe music as a vocation is not a good thing either, look what you would have to write. Still one at least expects to be treated well with a certain amount of respect. That is where i draw the line.Otherwise it is easy to be taken advantage of. I think it is important to get ones music out into the world in real situations. One learns more that way that isolating one self in a room. It is a hard way to live and it takes a toll on all types of things in ones life if you keep doing it.<br/>I once told a performer that i thought composers should get paid and not performers. There was taken back. But there has to be something in the deal.</p><p>Aaron K.
