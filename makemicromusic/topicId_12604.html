I am simply a very harmonically handicapped person, and don&apos;t tend to think that way intuitively. In the pieces I&apos;ve done before where I actively wanted to have harmonic underpinning/interest, I&apos;ve always fallen far short of my goals. I&apos;m working on small exercises in this direction, and while it won&apos;t ever be a hallmark of my compositional style, I hope to make it at least a little deeper. I hope to do some study in this area during spring and summer, always attempting to relate it to the musical materials as well.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=12607 href="#12607">ðŸ”—</a>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 1:52:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; How do *you* get started on a new (microtonal) piece of music?</p><p>I start with two pieces, a &quot;frame&quot; and a &quot;seed&quot;.

(Note these pieces use conventional material and textures.)</p><p>Other pieces were result of previous experiments and speculations concerning to some musical matter I was interested in (some topic in harmony, rhythm, form, instrumental resources...). I have two short microtonal pieces for clarinet and guitar in 24-EDO. Part of the preparation time was tinkering with a special guitar tuning for quartertones, which has lead me to an 8-notes scale (8-EDO) and several quartertone chords available on the guitar. I did also a list of the harmonics (up to 7th) for that tuning, as well scratches for a (unfinished) 2-guitar 24-EDO piece.</p><p>++++</p><p>Lately I have made some speculations on 19-EDO, from a pitch-set based on the harmonics 6 to 15. It is a symmetrical set, so the pitches can be arranged in a sub-harmonic series as well. I have tried the sonorities with a MIDI keyboard (and zynaddsubfx synthesizer) and also with sound synthesis (using GNU Octave). I have made speculations on chord structures and sucession, common tones under tranposition/inversion etc. on the paper. I am interested on that symmetry -- how to convert harmonics into sub-harmonics, how to acomplish this with sound synthesis, how to explore the involved combination tones in a composition. At some moment, some accidental &grave;finds&apos; can get a musical &grave;meaning&apos; and drive me to the real compositional project (then I will probably scratch/draw a pre-composition with info about the textures, sections, and annotations). But before I need get an intimate knowledge/practice with the compositional material, to know what I can say with it. I think that 19-EDO piece will be either pure electroacoustic music or for some combination of electronics, glass marimba and recorder.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p><p>--<br/>  &apos;-------------------------------------------------------------------.<br/>Hudson Lacerda &lt;<a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/">http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/</a>&gt;<br/>*N&iuml;&iquest;&half;o deixe seu voto sumir! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&iuml;&iquest;&half;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a></p><p>                    == THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS ==<br/><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182">http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182</a><br/>  .-------------------------------------------------------------------&apos;<br/>--</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

Tunings that don&apos;t easily map to the standard 12-note keyboard are definitely harder to work with. But I think most of the successful experiences I&apos;ve had have started out by exploring patterns on the keyboard, then stumbling across something that works out well. A couple of times I&apos;ve had melodic ideas with specific interval patterns that I&apos;ve had to set aside until months or years later, when I&apos;m playing around with a new temperament that happens to work out with that melody. But most of the time, the melodic ideas come out of the exploration on the keyboard. Finding a good keyboard mapping can make a big difference. After it occurred to me to put the 10-note lemba scale on the black keys, I found it easier to work with lemba temperament.</p><p>The problem is, these ideas rarely lead to anything more than a few fragments. I guess there are a number of reasons for this, including laziness and having too many other interests to occupy my spare time, but also the difficulty of notation and the mismatch between the tuning systems and the keyboard. I think I have to be in a certain frame of mind in order to work on music, and when that happens, I can get a lot done in a few hours, but more often the interest in making music just isn&apos;t there.</p></div><h3><a id=12615 href="#12615">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 5:18:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 19 Mar 2006 Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; List-o-rama,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since the first word of the forum name is &quot;Making&quot;, I thought I&apos;d throw<br/>out a point for discussion.

But there are times when I actually sit down<br/>and apply myself ;-).</p><p>And most of the music wells up from a combination of<br/>activity and mood, as I think I&apos;ve described here before,<br/>particularly when walking and looking around me, enjoying<br/>a lovely day in the park or by the sea.  Other times it comes<br/>fully formed in my head when I&apos;m lying relaxed between<br/>sleep and waking.  Then again, I get ideas from just random<br/>&quot;noodling&quot; at an instrument (guitar, keyboard, flute, voice).</p><p>When I do get a block, it&apos;s because I can&apos;t get it down<br/>quickly enough - not because it&apos;s uninteresting or vague,<br/>but because new musical ideas well up and replace it.<br/>Then sometimes I do struggle to complete the piece &quot;the<br/>way I heard it&quot;.  This can be very frustrating.  That&apos;s when<br/>I have to apply myself.  But you can&apos;t push too hard, or it<br/>turns to rubbish.  There&apos;s a point beyond which you say,<br/>&quot;Bad luck, it was a good idea while it lasted!&quot;  then move on<br/>to the next thing.</p><p>As for the explicitly microtonal, it does depend on having<br/>an instrument suitably tuned.  The only two non-12-EDO<br/>instruments I have in working order are the Roland MIDI<br/>keyboard and my voice.  Almost every time I see a new<br/>tuning described on MMM or on the Tuning list, I try it<br/>out (if practical) on the keyboard.  My voice has this<br/>tendency to do JI (alright, it&apos;s my brain) except when I&apos;m<br/>deliberately being scatty.  Point is, I can&apos;t sing in, say,<br/>20-EDO, unless I hear it first.  I&apos;ve also tried various<br/>retunings of the guitar, some of which I&apos;ve reported on<br/>onlist, and others I haven&apos;t, particularly a deliberate and<br/>random mis-tuning; improvising around that often sharpens<br/>my tonal sense, but hasn&apos;t produced any recorded music<br/>yet.  That may come.</p><p>Well, this all FWIW, and from an amateur at that, rather<br/>than a professional like so many of you.  So what would I<br/>know?  Only what works for me.</p><p>The most important bit of advice I can give is: don&apos;t push<br/>it too hard.  If it&apos;s not happening, go for a walk, clear your<br/>head, play a game of Tetris or tennis, breathe deep, do<br/>ANYthing else for at least half a hour and stop thinking<br/>about it.  The answers often come quite clearly after a<br/>complete break.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.385 / Virus Database: 268.2.5/284 - Release Date: 17/3/06</p></div><h3><a id=12617 href="#12617">ðŸ”—</a>plopper6 &#x3C;billwestfall@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2006 3:59:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;...<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be *especially* interested in any anecdotes pertaining to a real<br/>&gt; roadblock, and how you happened to break through it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I was having trouble getting a particular sound (not microtonal) I<br/>wanted, then posed the question to a different Yahoo music group.<br/>About five minutes after considering all the replies I had the sound I<br/>was looking for!<br/>So I would say that you&apos;ve taken the right first step, maybe just ask<br/>a more pointed question here about what you want in particular.
