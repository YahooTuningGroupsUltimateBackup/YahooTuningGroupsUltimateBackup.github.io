The first is one with Jay Williams that started out as a demo<br/>I recorded with drummer Peter Zolli (who was in my high school fusion<br/>band Symmetry way back when) for a project that was going to go under<br/>a Silver Apples Of The Moon moniker.</p><p>This tune was complete save for a vocal track (Pete&apos;s sister Paula<br/>Zolli) and a guitar solo before it was abandoned and eventually<br/>presumed to be lost at sea. However, it eventually it popped up on a<br/>cassette I found and I shipped that off to Jay to finish off however<br/>he saw fit. Should be interesting.</p><p>The other is a collab with drummer all-round sonic provocateur Joseph<br/>Benzola. This one was initiated by Joe and has been slow going due in<br/>equal parts to my current lack of equipment and overall peace of mind.<br/>But it will eventually come to be.</p><p>I&apos;m psyched to hear a new BIG Christopher Bailey microtonal piece (In<br/>case I haven&apos;t made it clear in the past, Chris is absolutely one of<br/>my personal faves). 19-tet? I&apos;m giddy with anticipation!</p><p>If the time should come when you&apos;ve got some time cleared up and a<br/>doable MMM collaboration of some sort seems like an appealing idea,<br/>just let me know... I&apos;ll be ready.</p><p>(You too George, I&apos;m still waiting!)</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Christopher Bailey&quot; &lt;cb202@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Thursday, April 25, 2002 8:55 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] a MMM collaboration?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds like a cool thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m working on my big 19-tet computer piece right now . . hopefully<br/>&gt; it will be done in, say, July.
