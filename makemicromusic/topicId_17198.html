I thought of 8ET basically as two 12ET diminished seventh chords, where the only standard voiceleading is a tritone resolving via large halfsteps, and the resolution must be minor (or diminished). So, the piece is made up of diminished and minor harmonies exclusively. Diminished arpeggios are also featured, which feel natural to play in this tuning because they map as whole tone scales on the keyboard. It took me a while to get acclimated to the &apos;halfsteps&apos;. Suspensions in 8ET are super-nasty dissonances.
