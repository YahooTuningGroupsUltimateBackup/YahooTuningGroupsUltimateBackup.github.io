That said, I have enormous fondness and respect for the work<br/>of Kraig Grady, Toby Twining, Kyle Gann, Prent Rogers, etc. (interesting how<br/>Kraig seems to have moved to temperament with things like meta-meantone,<br/>etc. anyway...).</p><p>Another realization is that synthesizer sounds that are &apos;dynamic&apos; in nature<br/>often are so for the reason that the oscillators (assuming more than one)<br/>beat with slight detuning. Not always, but usually, I find this beating more<br/>pleasant that absolutely straight &apos;static&apos; tone, but I guess it&apos;s contextual<br/>after all.

I&apos;m itching to experiment in this area. I just<br/>heard a John Luther Adams piece (&quot;Dark Waves&quot; for orchestral/electronics) on<br/>the radio (CSO broadcast:<br/><a href="https://www.cso.org/ListenAndWatch/Details.aspx?id=15513">https://www.cso.org/ListenAndWatch/Details.aspx?id=15513</a>) on Sunday that I<br/>was quite fond of: it was a giant ambient texture, painting the enormous<br/>Alaskan white landscape in sound, and it really had ZERO counterpoint in any<br/>traditional sense---it was a drifting cloud of texture. I loved it, but<br/>maybe some around here who seemingly measure things by Bachian counterpoint<br/>might have missed the point.... :)</p><p>AKJ</p><p>On Tue, Mar 8, 2011 at 12:08 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lobawad wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hopefully this example will help demonstrate how radically &gt;different<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t say that the RTP was only about extreme puns, in fact I said<br/>&gt; something quite contrary- Gene&apos;s works are full of micro puns.

It is nice that 15 equal divisions of the octave<br/>&gt; approximates these elements very well, but &quot;15-et&quot; and &quot;Porcupine&quot; do<br/>&gt; NOT equate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously you know this, you created the temperament, but as I keep<br/>&gt; saying (for years now), if you want non-acolytes to dig what you&apos;re<br/>&gt; doing, you have to speak in a way that does not cloud fundamental<br/>&gt; concepts.</p><p>I did create the chord progression that led to the discovery of porcupine temperament, but in fact Mizarian Porcupine Overture as a whole is written in 15-ET. I do say 15-ET and not 15-EDO, because I was using it as what these days we&apos;d call a rank 1 temperament. The chords and chord progressions possible in 15-ET, as well as the sizes of the melodic intervals (e.g., splitting the minor third into two equal parts) are similar to those in Carlos Alpha, but only up to a point (e.g., 15-ET allows for inversions of triads, while Alpha doesn&apos;t).</p><p>15-ET as I was using it can be represented as &lt;15, 24, 35, 42, 52]; this is the so-called &quot;patent val&quot; of 15-ET, or &quot;nearest prime mapping&quot; as a slightly more friendly term.</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2011 4:28:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing about micro puns is that you don&apos;t need a big comma to get the dynamic effect--the effect of movement beyond what strict JI would allow, which imparts an extra impetus to the music. The 81/80 pun effect, IMHO, is what makes the Meantone[7] diatonic scale so much more dynamic than the Ptolemy &quot;5-limit just diatonic&quot; scale. It&apos;s far more than just an extra chord. And even a tiny interval like 2401/2400 can impart a dynamic effect, though to be sure here one can simply accept the comma drift if the pileup of large numerators and denominators is not a concern.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I feel sorry for people who think tuning is about &quot;math&quot;. The math simply describes components; it is a tool. The goals are things like &quot;dynamic effect&quot;, as you say.</p><p>The septimal tempering found in the &quot;marvel&quot; temperament modality of 41-edo is something that does for me, for reasons I doubt I could explain, what you describe here. Maybe this &quot;septimin&quot; or something, I can&apos;t keep up the names. The comma in question is 225:224 at any rate.</p></div>
