They are an acquired taste, but I rather like them.<br/>&gt; 1/2-comma is close to 26-equal, and is a bit more active and approaching<br/>&gt; pelog. 2/5-comma is close to 45-equal, and is a compromise between<br/>19-equal<br/>&gt; and 26-equal. You can try ever more active and flatter fifths by testing<br/>5th<br/>&gt; sizes from 26-equal and smaller by adding 4 to the numerator and 7 to the<br/>&gt; denominator of each n-tet in a series:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15 steps of 26-tet, 19 of 33-tet, 23 of 40-tet, 27 of 47-tet, 31 of<br/>&gt; 54-tet......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; of course, the resulting thirds (after going 4 fifths up) become more and<br/>more<br/>&gt; neutral sounding and harsh with harmonic timbres. 26 (1/2-comma) for me is<br/>a<br/>&gt; limit to how far *I* will go in these negative &apos;active meantones&apos; and<br/>still<br/>&gt; use traditional Western harmonic progressions. Going beyond gets more<br/>&gt; &apos;pelog-ish&apos;, but if that&apos;s you thing, you should enjoy it very much. It&apos;s<br/>a<br/>&gt; different kind of beauty--very spicy and restless.</p><p>Aaron,<br/>Thanks for this!  I appreciate the chance to learn from<br/>your experience.</p><p>Excuse a little maths?  I just want to get a handle on your<br/>series of tunings.</p><p>* Start maths *<br/>Filling in the first three terms of your series of fifths<br/>backwards gives, of course, 11 of 19; 7 of 12; and 3 of 5.<br/>So the series has nth term = (3+4n) of (5+7n), and for large<br/>enough n, this approaches 4 of 7.  All these fifths thus lie<br/>between 720 cents (3 of 5) - the sharpest of them all - and<br/>~686 cents (4 of 7) - the flattest of them all.  The nearest<br/>to a just fifth of 702 cents is given by 7 of 12.</p><p>Four fifths minus two octaves gives us the thirds of this<br/>series of tunings;  the third thus ranges from 480 cents<br/>down to ~343 cents - that is, from a flattish fourth down to<br/>a sharpish minor third.</p><p>At some point, I guess, that third will be SO neutral that it<br/>becomes hard to distinguish major third from minor third -<br/>Let&apos;s see - the fifth is (3+4n) steps of (5+7n), the (major)<br/>third is 4 x (3+4n) - 2 x (5+7n) = (2+2n) steps, the minor<br/>third is (3+4n) - (2+2n) = (1+2n) steps.  So the difference<br/>between major and minor third is just 1 step of (5+7n); and<br/>so they become closer together the larger we make n - the<br/>larger EDO we choose.  Of course, they won&apos;t become<br/>indistinguishable until they&apos;re within a few cents of each<br/>other - for example, we don&apos;t get a 5-cent difference until<br/>243-EDO, when the fifth is 139 steps;  and we don&apos;t get a<br/>2-cent difference until 600-EDO, when the fifth is 343<br/>steps.<br/>* End maths *</p><p>But long before that point, you say you won&apos;t &quot;still use<br/>traditional Western harmonic progressions&quot;.  That&apos;s very<br/>likely a better test of what I was looking for than my<br/>vague expression &quot;fairly just&quot;.  I guess that for &quot;traditional<br/>Western harmonic progressions&quot; to be useful, we need to<br/>have a very clear distinction between major and minor -<br/>they need to be so far apart there&apos;s no likelihood of<br/>hearers confusing them.</p><p>Just revisiting something you wrote:<br/>&gt; of course, the resulting thirds (after going 4 fifths up)<br/>&gt; become more and more neutral sounding and harsh with<br/>&gt; harmonic timbres ...</p><p>Presumably, much of this harshness would disappear if<br/>one were to synthesise inharmonic timbres with overtones<br/>from the tuning?</p><p>&gt; On Friday 12 August 2005 11:57 am, Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&apos;s my question, on which I seek your collective wisdom based<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on actual experience of alternative tunings (rather than theory):<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How far can one take this narrowing of the chromatic semitones,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; while still retaining a fairly just flavour to the intonation?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Yahya,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps Aaron Johnson is uniquely qualified to answer this question,<br/>&gt; &gt; considering the extensive work he&apos;s just done in 2/5-comma meantone,<br/>&gt; &gt; which could be one possible answer to your query.<br/>...etc</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
