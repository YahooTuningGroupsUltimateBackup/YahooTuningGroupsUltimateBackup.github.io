While they seem straightforward, a bit of<br/>thought shows that there are problems in<br/>making a &quot;fair&quot; comparison.</p><p>As I mentioned in an earlier post, just listening to the<br/>raw sound samples, the main difference appears to be a slight<br/>&quot;phasing&quot; kind of effect (as you well know, the mapping to 19-tet<br/>is quite benign compared to many). There was no audible pitch shift,<br/>and the timbre didnt change much, except for the phasing.</p><p>Now, when I mixed down the piece (b), I added some reverb and<br/>a small bit of phase shifting (normal things for a &quot;guitar&quot;)<br/>- of course, I chose the amounts so that it<br/>sounded good to me... so - problem #1: how much reverb and phasing<br/>should be added to the version (a)? If I leave it the same, then<br/>very likely its the &quot;wrong&quot; amount... that seems like its crippling<br/>version (a), yet if I change it, then we&apos;ve lost experimental control!</p><p>The problems are far worse for (c) and (d). Here, we must decide<br/>about the slides... I adjusted the portamento (for instance)<br/>so that you got a smooth glide between adjacent 19-tet steps<br/>in roughly the time span over which they were being played...<br/>when mapping to 12-tet, should this glide time be adjusted<br/>to the time required for 12-tet steps? If no, then the 12-tet piece<br/>is at a disadvantage since the &quot;correct compositional decision&quot;<br/>has not been taken. However, if we do change it, then we have lost<br/>experimental control!</p><p>Because the effects in this 19-tet case are subtle (the &quot;phasing&quot;)<br/>Im not sure that this is worth it... any differences are likely to be<br/>swamped by the various arbitrary trade-offs that are necessary.</p><p>On the other hand, John had mentioned that he would like to<br/>try some stuff with the MIDI file - Id be happy to share this,<br/>to see what kinds of things you can come up with...</p><p>As a final note, I have done comparisons very much like (a)-(d) on<br/>the Turquoise Dabo Girl on the CD that cames with TTSS. While<br/>track 26 plays the piece with the mapped timbres in 11-tet, track 27<br/>plays (the first 16 bars) using &quot;the same&quot; (i.e., the unmapped)<br/>harmonic timbres. While problems like the ones mentioned above<br/>also occurred here, the major effect is the &quot;out-of-timbre&quot;<br/>perception, and this dominates minor things like reverb.<br/>If you would like, I can put this on the web...</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=1190 href="#1190">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2001 9:06:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Bill</p><p>The last thing I want to do is throw distracting challenges at you in<br/>mapping your 19-tET piece to other tunings and timbres.  I appreciate<br/>the subtleties of your concerns.</p><p>(Of course, if you have a MIDI file at hand, I&apos;d be glad to play with<br/>it)</p><p>I&apos;d much rather pick your brain regarding preparing altered timbres for<br/>one or more complete GM voice sets.  It seems as if a fair amount of<br/>tinkering with the overtones is almost inaudible to the ear on<br/>individual notes, while making a huge difference to the implicit &quot;JI&quot;<br/>tuning, as you and Margo (and others) have demonstrated.</p><p>How hard would it be for a guy like me to acquire and use the tools that<br/>would be required for such a project?  Is it even feasible?  As you<br/>know, I&apos;m a long way from being the expert you are in such matters.</p><p>Any crumbs of knowledge, pearls of wisdom, would be appreciated.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
