So if you set the maxx range<br/>&gt; of the pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; bend to 1 semitone up and down, you get 2 semitones divided into 255<br/>&gt; parts,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is not a brilliant accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah ha! Your 11-note scale in terms of midi note numbers and pitch bends is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [[61,6528], [62,8576], [63,10752],[65, 9856], [64, 7808], [66,10972],<br/>&gt; [68,6016], [69,8192], [70,5120], [71,7296], [72, 9472]]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you look at the second note of each pair, they are all divisible by<br/>&gt; 128 = 2^7 except for [66, 10972]. I still don&apos;t get why you can&apos;t come<br/>&gt; a lot closer to the fifth of 19 equal, however; one of your notes is<br/>&gt; [71, 7296], and that is as close as you can come using pitch bends<br/>&gt; divisible by 128 (course pitch bends only, or 1536 equal) to a 19-et<br/>&gt; fifth over [64, 8192]; this would be great except that [64, 8192]<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t in your scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  but unless anyone has better experience with<br/>&gt; &gt; Sib v.3 and microtones and Roland Soundcanvases, to achieve better<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation results, it&apos;s all I can do. Deviations from *exact*<br/>&gt; 19equal are<br/>&gt; &gt; products of the technology not impure compositional thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I anyone can produce a rendition using the exact implied tuning, I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; &gt; interested to hear also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could change it to 19 equal easily enough, and I suspect if I do it<br/>&gt; will, after all, turn out to be semisixths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To suggest that I was using a different tuning by<br/>&gt; &gt; analysing an electronic performance is incorrect - and in any case I<br/>&gt; suspect<br/>&gt; &gt; any real acoustic performance on two real recorders will have<br/>&gt; deviations far<br/>&gt; &gt; worse than my electronic ones, so the discussion vis a vis accuracy<br/>&gt; is largely<br/>&gt; &gt; moot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m simply reporting on the tuning as it exists in your midi file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
