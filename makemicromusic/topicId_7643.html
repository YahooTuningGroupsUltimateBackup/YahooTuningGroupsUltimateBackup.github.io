Check out &quot;absolute mode&quot; on the P5 group. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; what will need to be used. Don&apos;t use the Essential Reality SDK for<br/>&gt; absolute mode, though. It says it works in the SDK docs but it<br/>&gt; really doesn&apos;t. Only relative mode works (similar to mouse input).</p><p>Rightio, thanks. Though I&apos;m not sure I understand the distinction between<br/>relative and absolute mode here yet. With the mouse, you can lift the mouse<br/>off the pad and place it back again somewhere else, so you lose<br/>the record of where it was before, so it has to be relative.</p><p>But I don&apos;t yet understand how you can you lose the absolute position of<br/>the glove as it seems there is nowhere else to move it to. Must be<br/>missing something there.</p><p>&gt; As I&apos;m thinking more on this, you probably wouldn&apos;t want to limit it<br/>&gt; to just a single flat surface. You could stack virtual surfaces and<br/>&gt; just play in the air since it&apos;s all on screen. That would be cool!</p><p>Yes, it would be great! I can think of many possibilities here<br/>such as lattices, 3D theremin, split keys etc.</p><p>&gt; As far as languages go, I use C++ due to it&apos;s massive use in the SDKs<br/>&gt; I&apos;m linked to. I like the purity of C but love the reusability /<br/>&gt; encapsulation of C++! It fits my programming style really well, too,<br/>&gt; but that might be because it&apos;s what I&apos;ve groaned used to.</p><p>Yes, I can understand that.</p><p>Yes, you can do most of the basic SDK stuff using C only,<br/>but one or two things require C++ - the main thing I use<br/>it for is making desktop shortcuts, for some reason not<br/>supported in pure C in the SDK. Some other things can<br/>be done in C but are far more complex, e.g. tool tips.<br/>I do those in pure C but that part of my programs<br/>took me a fair number of weeks to write and debug<br/>before I had it all figured out!</p><p>Who knows, maybe if tings had gone differently at some poitn in the past<br/>I too might have got used to C++ and come to prefer<br/>coding in it too.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
