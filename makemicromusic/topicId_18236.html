My experience is that a lot of tuning discussion<br/>assumes some basic familiarity with Just Intonation theory, so it&apos;s a<br/>good place to start.</p><p>The only other major micotonal text I&apos;m personally very familiar with<br/>is Harry Partch&apos;s Genesis of a Music, which is a wonderful and<br/>fascinating book, especially if you&apos;re interested in his work. With<br/>that said, only a moderate amount of the book is devoted to tuning<br/>theory per se, and I can&apos;t imagine it&apos;s the most direct way to learn<br/>about tuning. Some of his statements about psychoacoustics are now<br/>known to be inaccurate, as well.</p><p>There are plenty of other books out there, ad I&apos;m sure others will<br/>recommend their favorites. I just haven&apos;t gotten a chance to find/read<br/>them yet!</p><p>Also, in my experience, most people like to think of intonational<br/>systems as sets of relationships between tones rather than absolute<br/>pitches, ie, in hertz. Thus, pitches are usually expressed as some<br/>sort of mathematical relationship to a tonic tone, either in ratios,<br/>in cents, or in some other system (ie, using irrational numbers like<br/>pi as a basis).</p><p>On Dec 25, 2007 8:13 AM, . . &lt;offtheblvdrecords@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Happy holidays folks, I was going to get myself a holiday gift cause i have<br/>&gt; a little money left over after the holiday shopping... and i wanted to know<br/>&gt; a good book that can give someone with no theory knowledge other then<br/>&gt; octaves and power chords, a foundation to work in microtonal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Also is their anyone who has come up with a tunning theory that expresses<br/>&gt; things as pure hertz or is that just to clumsy?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  ---------------------------------<br/>&gt;  Looking for last minute shopping deals?

(pun intended)</p><p>I second the recommendation for Doty&apos;s primer. It is a<br/>very simple explanation of JI and a great introduction.</p><p>Partch&apos;s book is what introduced me to tuning, and while<br/>i can recommend it as a very interesting read, i would<br/>say that it is actually a much better idea to read his<br/>book *after* getting a good grasp of microtonality from<br/>these other sources.</p><p>Another good practical intro, which is not based on JI,<br/>is &quot;Preliminary Exercises in the Virtual Pitch Continuum&quot;<br/>by Joe Maneri and Scott van Duyne. It is a book of<br/>ear-training exercises in 72-edo.</p><p>Of course i&apos;m going to have to toot my own horn: if<br/>you want to find out about all manner of things microtonal,<br/>you can find an alphabetical listing in my Tonalsoft<br/>Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music-theory:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/encyclopedia.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/encyclopedia.aspx</a></p><p>And if you have a Windows XP machine and can get<br/>Tonescape running on it, that&apos;s a terrific way to<br/>try out anything you read about.</p><p>-monz</p><p>email: joemonz(AT)<a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Chris Bryan &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2007 10:49:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Also is their anyone who has come up with a tunning theory that expresses things as pure hertz or is that just to clumsy?</p><p>One could think of ratios (or roots, for that matter) as &quot;pure hertz&quot;<br/>values that have been reduced.  This also allows you to see<br/>transpositions as equivalent:  for instance, 300/200 and 798/532 are<br/>both 3/2.  If that doesn&apos;t make sense, think of your familiar power<br/>chords:  moving your hand down the fingerboard doesn&apos;t change the<br/>interval patterns.</p><p>I think many electronic composers think in just hertz when microtuning<br/>samples, either because they haven&apos;t delved into theory, or are just<br/>turned off by it as a hindrance to &quot;intuition.&quot;  Fair enough, but to<br/>me that seems slightly naive, like working in language without syntax,<br/>or exploring geography without making any maps.  But, to each his own<br/>:)</p><p>Chris Bryan</p></div>
