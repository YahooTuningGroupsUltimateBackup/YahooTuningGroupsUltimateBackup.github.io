Every now and then I get really comfortable with the<br/>neutral intervals and can pull out some really eerie-surreal stuff.<br/>It&apos;s so bizarre how the neutrals mix with the consonant major 2nds and<br/>perfect fourths and fifths...the normal-sounding intervals almost make<br/>the xenharmonics stand out more.</p><p>Also, my next City of the Asleep album will be fully microtonal, now<br/>that I have some microtonal softsynths I&apos;m comfortable with.  I&apos;ve<br/>already finished a new song in 22, &quot;Atheist Love Song&quot; which I&apos;ll put<br/>up once I do the vocals.</p></div>
