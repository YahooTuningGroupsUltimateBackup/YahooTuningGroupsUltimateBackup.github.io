The turntable and records had their own way<br/>of making strict quodlibet and tight, microtonal shadings sound<br/>&gt; interesting. This sound is totally particular to this process. (The<br/>&gt; quartet was actually a double duet as there were two records that<br/>were doubled to allow for the dimmer switch styled microtonal<br/>splaying. It took about three months of working on it everyday to<br/>finish a roughly ten minute piece.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Just as a little aside, &quot;serioso&quot; turntable art has been a hot item<br/>in New York of late.  Randy Woolf, who just won a Guggenheim by the<br/>way, has a new piece for string quartet and DJ... scratching the same<br/>piece that the players are playing in real time...</p><p>I hear it was quite a success, although I have not heard the piece...</p><p>__________ ________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
