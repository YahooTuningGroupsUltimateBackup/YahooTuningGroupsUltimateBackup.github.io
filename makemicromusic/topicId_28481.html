As usual for my live pieces, there is no computer or<br/>keyboard involved (and in this case, no synths either), so there is no<br/>specific tuning used. However, in this piece I &quot;play&quot; a Deluxe Memory<br/>Man in a manner that essentially exploits harmonics/overtones, so in<br/>that sense it is in a form of just intonation.</p><p>Stream:<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mysterybear/abyss">http://soundcloud.com/mysterybear/abyss</a></p><p>Download:<br/><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mysterybear/abyss/download">http://soundcloud.com/mysterybear/abyss/download</a></p><p>- Dave</p></div>
