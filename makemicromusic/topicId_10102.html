First<br/>&gt;off, the whole idea of using different note heads for other<br/>&gt;rhythms... triangle notes for &quot;third notes&quot; or one beat (with a stem)<br/>&gt;of the meter 3/3 seem a little far-fetched for musicians to adopt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think the fact that this book was written in 1919 and, to my<br/>&gt;knowledge, none of these suggestions have been seriously implemented<br/>&gt;in any way may speak to this difficulty.</p><p>One could say the same thing about microtonality.</p><p>&gt;Even more troubling is the assumption that rhythm and meter of,<br/>&gt;essentially, inharmonic timbres, should follow the pitched overtone<br/>&gt;series of multiples (i.e. 1 note per measure, 2 notes per measure, 3<br/>&gt;per measure) and should relate in a kind of gestalt theory that<br/>&gt;covers everything.</p><p>Simple ratios fall out of coupled oscillator systems that are likely<br/>candidates for the way the brain represents rhythms.  I don&apos;t think<br/>Cowell knew that, that but he could hear the way they sound.  I really<br/>enjoy the polyrhythms in Cowell&apos;s music.  The  nature of percussion<br/>timbres hardly matters here, especially in light of the fact that the<br/>ratios are not describing simultaneities.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure that there is any evidence that an inharmonic sound<br/>&gt;being struck at twice the speed of another sound heard at the same<br/>&gt;time has the kind of &quot;special relationship&quot; that one finds in the 2x<br/>&gt;multiple of vibrations in the pitch spectrum.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of percussion parts, as notated, are<br/>made entirely of simple-ratio rhythms.  Cowell was suggesting<br/>extending this.  Nancarrow apparently did stuff with irrational<br/>rhythms like sqrt(2)... might be a good exercise to dig up that<br/>stuff and listen for it.</p><p>&gt;I admit that some of these ideas of organization... say<br/>&gt;of &quot;modulating&quot; rhythms according to speed multiples that roughly<br/>&gt;correspond to a multiple of the overtone series might be an<br/>&gt;intresting way to make some textures.</p><p>Glenn Gould was a believer that tempo changes ought to happen at<br/>simple ratios -- in a 1981 (IIRC) interview he describes how he<br/>used this technique between variations in his rendition of the<br/>Goldberg variations.  I had always done this on my scores, before<br/>I knew about just intonation or Glenn Gould.</p><p>&gt;After all, Charles Ives does this in his Universe Symphony... did he<br/>&gt;get the ideas from Cowell or vice versa (probably the latter)</p><p>Or maybe they did it independently... anybody know?</p><p>&gt;However, to boil all this down to some kind of &quot;unified field theory&quot;<br/>&gt;where it all relates, rhythm, meter and pitch, to the simple ratios<br/>&gt;of the overtone series *by necessity* seems something of a stretch,<br/>&gt;no?</p><p>I don&apos;t remember Cowell putting forth such a grand system -- I<br/>remember his approach being one of making suggestions.  An unified<br/>theory like this would indeed be a stretch, in my view.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10105 href="#10105">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2005 8:00:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I don&apos;t remember Cowell putting forth such a grand system -- I<br/>&gt; remember his approach being one of making suggestions.
