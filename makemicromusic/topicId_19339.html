Something that might have a track view, a piano<br/>roll, VST support, possibly a mixer or console view, etc., all with<br/>microtonal features build in under the hood. Something in which you<br/>can route to different MIDI devices and use different VST synths and<br/>such. A microtonal Rosegarden, or Logic, or SONAR, or anything like<br/>that, if you will. The focus wouldn&apos;t be so much on making the score<br/>pretty for printing (although that might be nice), but on making it<br/>easy to produce microtonal works in terms of the actual sound of the<br/>end result wise. A production environment, if you will. There is going<br/>to be a very, very strong emphasis on making this software easy to<br/>use, so that those of us who are less computer-literate can still jump<br/>into writing microtonal music.</p><p>I do envision it having a very robust notation and staff view, a lot<br/>of which I want to &quot;borrow&quot; from the score editor we&apos;re working on<br/>(and possibly even design the score editor with that kind of<br/>portability in mind from the getgo). I want to have the notes in the<br/>staff view look like 72-tet or JI or whatever tuning or notation<br/>system it is you&apos;re using, and then translate all of that behind the<br/>scenes into MIDI/MTS/Scala, or pitch bent/channel swapped MIDI, or<br/>OSC, or whatever else. Things that are extremely difficult to<br/>implement or extraneous to this specific goal, such as audio support<br/>or a CSound GUI or anything even resembling a synth engine are not an<br/>immediate priority for this program, but would be future<br/>considerations later if we can get this off the ground first. In other<br/>words, let&apos;s just make it a MIDI sequencer with some fancy views at<br/>first.</p><p>So to the people on this forum: does this sound like something that<br/>you would be interested in having? Does it sound like having<br/>everything rounded together in a package like this would make<br/>production easier for you? Many of the microtonal works that I&apos;ve<br/>heard are extremely interesting, but simply run through some sort of<br/>GM-sounding synth, and so I thought that having a production<br/>environment like this might make it easier for people to focus on the<br/>production side of creating music. I also thought it might make it<br/>easier for people who are musicians and composers first and foremost<br/>to jump right into this kind of stuff without having to learn how to<br/>use multiple pieces of software and connect them all.</p><p>I&apos;ve spoken to a few of you off-list, so I know there is at least some<br/>demand for it. If there is enough demand, I&apos;ll kick this off as a<br/>project in its own right alongside the score editor. It&apos;s a pretty big<br/>goal and could take some time to complete, but there is a huge wealth<br/>of talent on these lists, so I am pretty optimistic.</p><p>Most importantly, this could determine the design route for a few<br/>different projects. I&apos;ve also been throwing around the idea of first<br/>creating some general purpose toolkits before jumping into either one<br/>of these programs. I like this approach even just on the merit that it<br/>will make microtonal software development in the future much easier<br/>for whoever has the next big idea. A few people on the score editor<br/>team think that it&apos;ll be too much work to go that route.</p><p>However, if there is going to be a score editor and a production<br/>environment, both projects might move along more quickly if we code<br/>together on architectures that will be common to both projects. So we<br/>might end up with some toolkits just out of necessity. For example, it<br/>makes sense to code the notation GUI in this way, or else we&apos;re going<br/>to have the people from the score editor working on their GUI, and the<br/>people from the production environment working on another GUI, which<br/>is just wasted time for everyone. It also determines whether it&apos;s<br/>necessary to come up with some kind of universal Microtonal Event<br/>List, as AKJ suggested, and to what extent the programs will be able<br/>to communicate with one another.</p><p>Carl has requested that I actually go write some wireframe diagrams<br/>and go into how I think the production environment should work and<br/>how, if at all, it overlaps with the score editor. Before I actually<br/>take the time to do that, though, I want to see if there is any sort<br/>of interest for it. So speak up! We need to hear some feedback right<br/>now. And if you&apos;d be interested in helping to code such a project, any<br/>little bit of effort would certainly help move things along real, real<br/>nice-like.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19340 href="#19340">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2008 10:44:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>For starters, it might be helpful, communication-wise, if you could<br/>have a small reduction in your &quot;walls of text&quot; posts!

It&apos;s hard to condense everything into one little<br/>bit sometimes. I&apos;ll try with this post, let&apos;s see how it goes. Here&apos;s<br/>a more condensed version:</p><p>I am used to working in a DAW environment. I like to mess around with<br/>tones, put on effects and such, and all of that. The notation part of<br/>it, for me, is crucial as an easy way to enter in notes to be screwed<br/>around with in the DAW. I -hate- most of the DAW&apos;s that are available<br/>in terms of what they can do with staff notation. I absolutely hate<br/>them.

All of that should be done under the hood.<br/>3) then be able to mix, engineer, and produce the production -ONLY IN<br/>MIDI, AT FIRST- so that I can get a professional sounding final result<br/>4) be able to go back and forth from the writing to the mixing, from<br/>the staff notation to the synth I&apos;m using, fluidly and easily, without<br/>having to switch between programs and wait for them to load, without<br/>having to have multiple large-scale programs open at the same time,<br/>and without having to buy any extra software to accomplish this basic<br/>functionality<br/>5) And, finally, be able to give this product to musicians of average<br/>computer-literacy and have them be able to use it reasonably well out<br/>of the box. As well as they can use Logic or Sibelius. I&apos;m talking<br/>about musicians that will give up on writing microtonal music if they<br/>have to get scala set up (which involves first getting the GTK set up,<br/>which scares off quite a few people), and then setting it up to retune<br/>MIDI, or generating a scala file to send to Kontakt by way of a<br/>commercial program.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19342 href="#19342">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2008 11:28:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon wrote:<br/>&gt; Next: as you know, I&apos;ve joined over at the Google group as well, and<br/>&gt; will give my support as I am able. But I plead with you:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Start simple. Make something work.</p><p>Well, let&apos;s put it this way: I find that Sibelius is great for scoring<br/>and awful for production. The people involved with the score editor<br/>would rather write Sibelius and don&apos;t really want to accommodate any<br/>sort of serious production needs, even potential ones in the future.<br/>They don&apos;t want a track view, for example. All they want is basic<br/>sequencer playback. So this is going to likely have to be a separate<br/>project.</p><p>Or, in other words: I don&apos;t want this to be a huge, complex, bloated<br/>behemoth that is Finale and ProTools put together any more than you<br/>do.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So to the people on this forum: does this sound like something that<br/>&gt;&gt; you would be interested in having?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course.</p><p>Good. Believe it or not, I just had a very lively conversation in<br/>which it was posed that I was &quot;the only one&quot; who wanted to have this<br/>and that existing tools were &quot;fine.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Only if it is done exceedingly well, which to me means that it has to<br/>&gt; match, or at least come very close, to the best of the commercial apps<br/>&gt; in any particular area you choose to look at (i.e. notation has to be<br/>&gt; as good as Finale/Sibelius/etc, anything going towards audio<br/>&gt; production has to be as good as what&apos;s out their (Logic/Sonar/etc).</p><p>Well, my idea is that the two programs would sort of complement each<br/>other. What would be bloated is stuffing Sibelius into Sonar as the<br/>staff view. I think we&apos;re going to have a score editor, which is going<br/>to be Sibelius... eventually. I would also like to have Sonar...<br/>eventually as well. So what will be necessary is some degree of<br/>interoperability between the two programs.</p><p>If you like writing things out in a score, there&apos;s a program for that,<br/>and it&apos;s called Sibelius. We&apos;re working on a microtonal version of<br/>that. But, if you like composing on the fly or in a DAW, there&apos;s a<br/>program for that too, and it&apos;s called Logic. We need a microtonal<br/>version of that too. Having an easy transition from score editor to<br/>DAW is, as far as I know, something that NOBODY has together right<br/>now, but it might evolve out of necessity here.</p><p>Either way, the audio stuff is going to be dealt with much, much<br/>later. Tackling MIDI would be better at first.</p><p>&gt; If the goal is smaller (great score editor with some sound capability)<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll have a chance to make it. Making it the last microtonal music<br/>&gt; production app anyone will ever need might be a bit much to bite off.</p><p>Or a great sequencer with some score editing. I really have less of an<br/>interest in the score editor than I do in a DAW. Perhaps I&apos;m being<br/>unclear: I don&apos;t want this to be the be-all, end-all, app. I just want<br/>a sequencer, and the score editor group doesn&apos;t. So, I&apos;m going to be<br/>working on this instead.

It sounds like the<br/>same thing as the score editor, but under the hood, it&apos;s not, but not<br/>too much harder to tackle. At first perhaps we&apos;ll only have OSC<br/>support, or only MIDI with MTS support.</p><p>Sound simple enough? And, if we partition the score editor design<br/>correctly (which is good practice regardless), the notation view and<br/>the playback engine will already be done from work on that.<br/>Furthermore, the score editor will get done faster, as I and other<br/>people will be able to work on the score editor knowing that we&apos;re<br/>doing things that are also helping to get the sequencer done, which is<br/>my main concern.</p><p>Things to be added later, in some kind of loose chronological order:<br/>- VST wrappers in the program, so we can have synths right in it<br/>without a separate rack<br/>- Developing algorithms to play our stuff back using MIDI without MTS<br/>support (pitch bends and channel swapping)<br/>- Anything involving automation<br/>- Other views such as a pattern view or whatever<br/>- Anything involving audio</p><p>Does that make sense?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m going to have to get off this bus.</p><p>Well hopefully now that you know what I&apos;m talking about, you can hop<br/>on the roof.

Something that might have a track view, a piano<br/>&gt; roll, VST support, possibly a mixer or console view, etc., all with<br/>&gt; microtonal features build in under the hood. Something in which you<br/>&gt; can route to different MIDI devices and use different VST synths and<br/>&gt; such. A microtonal Rosegarden, or Logic, or SONAR, or anything like<br/>&gt; that, if you will. The focus wouldn&apos;t be so much on making the score<br/>&gt; pretty for printing (although that might be nice), but on making it<br/>&gt; easy to produce microtonal works in terms of the actual sound of the<br/>&gt; end result wise. A production environment, if you will. There is going<br/>&gt; to be a very, very strong emphasis on making this software easy to<br/>&gt; use, so that those of us who are less computer-literate can still jump<br/>&gt; into writing microtonal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do envision it having a very robust notation and staff view, a lot<br/>&gt; of which I want to &quot;borrow&quot; from the score editor we&apos;re working on<br/>&gt; (and possibly even design the score editor with that kind of<br/>&gt; portability in mind from the getgo). I want to have the notes in the<br/>&gt; staff view look like 72-tet or JI or whatever tuning or notation<br/>&gt; system it is you&apos;re using, and then translate all of that behind the<br/>&gt; scenes into MIDI/MTS/Scala, or pitch bent/channel swapped MIDI, or<br/>&gt; OSC, or whatever else. Things that are extremely difficult to<br/>&gt; implement or extraneous to this specific goal, such as audio support<br/>&gt; or a CSound GUI or anything even resembling a synth engine are not an<br/>&gt; immediate priority for this program, but would be future<br/>&gt; considerations later if we can get this off the ground first. In other<br/>&gt; words, let&apos;s just make it a MIDI sequencer with some fancy views at<br/>&gt; first.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So to the people on this forum: does this sound like something that<br/>&gt; you would be interested in having? Does it sound like having<br/>&gt; everything rounded together in a package like this would make<br/>&gt; production easier for you? Many of the microtonal works that I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard are extremely interesting, but simply run through some sort of<br/>&gt; GM-sounding synth, and so I thought that having a production<br/>&gt; environment like this might make it easier for people to focus on the<br/>&gt; production side of creating music. I also thought it might make it<br/>&gt; easier for people who are musicians and composers first and foremost<br/>&gt; to jump right into this kind of stuff without having to learn how to<br/>&gt; use multiple pieces of software and connect them all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve spoken to a few of you off-list, so I know there is at least some<br/>&gt; demand for it. If there is enough demand, I&apos;ll kick this off as a<br/>&gt; project in its own right alongside the score editor. It&apos;s a pretty big<br/>&gt; goal and could take some time to complete, but there is a huge wealth<br/>&gt; of talent on these lists, so I am pretty optimistic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most importantly, this could determine the design route for a few<br/>&gt; different projects. I&apos;ve also been throwing around the idea of first<br/>&gt; creating some general purpose toolkits before jumping into either one<br/>&gt; of these programs. I like this approach even just on the merit that it<br/>&gt; will make microtonal software development in the future much easier<br/>&gt; for whoever has the next big idea. A few people on the score editor<br/>&gt; team think that it&apos;ll be too much work to go that route.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, if there is going to be a score editor and a production<br/>&gt; environment, both projects might move along more quickly if we code<br/>&gt; together on architectures that will be common to both projects. So we<br/>&gt; might end up with some toolkits just out of necessity. For example, it<br/>&gt; makes sense to code the notation GUI in this way, or else we&apos;re going<br/>&gt; to have the people from the score editor working on their GUI, and the<br/>&gt; people from the production environment working on another GUI, which<br/>&gt; is just wasted time for everyone. It also determines whether it&apos;s<br/>&gt; necessary to come up with some kind of universal Microtonal Event<br/>&gt; List, as AKJ suggested, and to what extent the programs will be able<br/>&gt; to communicate with one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl has requested that I actually go write some wireframe diagrams<br/>&gt; and go into how I think the production environment should work and<br/>&gt; how, if at all, it overlaps with the score editor. Before I actually<br/>&gt; take the time to do that, though, I want to see if there is any sort<br/>&gt; of interest for it. So speak up! We need to hear some feedback right<br/>&gt; now. And if you&apos;d be interested in helping to code such a project, any<br/>&gt; little bit of effort would certainly help move things along real, real<br/>&gt; nice-like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=19359 href="#19359">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2008 12:45:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robin: You know, I am a bit curious, what do you use now to accomplish<br/>all of this?

The internal events list will be able to be translated into MIDI<br/>&gt; or OSC or anything. This means that microtonal stuff will be easy to<br/>&gt; implement because we&apos;re going to create the data model ourselves, the<br/>&gt; same as the score editor group is doing. I want the internal events<br/>&gt; list to be able to be parsed with any one of a number of different<br/>&gt; &quot;views&quot;, and for version 1.0, I&apos;d be happy with nothing but a track<br/>&gt; view and a notation view and perhaps a piano roll. It sounds like the<br/>&gt; same thing as the score editor, but under the hood, it&apos;s not, but not<br/>&gt; too much harder to tackle. At first perhaps we&apos;ll only have OSC<br/>&gt; support, or only MIDI with MTS support.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My thoughts on this. I use Csound, with a front end I wrote a long<br/>time ago, that has an internal data structure that meets my current<br/>needs. I have channels, and channels have notes. If you are going to<br/>create a data structure, here&apos;s one that works for me.</p><p>These are all vital to humanize a sound. Fake but accurate is my<br/>model. Imagine a musician playing the instrument who had the ability<br/>to hit any pitch, move it anywhere, and control the amplitude after it<br/>began. Too much synthesizer music sounds like someone playing a keyboard.</p><p>Here&apos;s my data structure. It&apos;s in Pascal, of course.

I have a<br/>table of 53 TET, another of Partch 43. Let the composer choose. Mine<br/>all have octave repetitions. Some won&apos;t like that. }<br/>   Velocity: Byte;   { How Loud? 0..127}<br/>   Rand: Byte; { Random chance that note will play 0 - 16. This is one<br/>of my favorites. Why insist that a note always sounds? Make it<br/>optional sometimes. }<br/>   Stereo: Byte; { Stereo Pan from 0 left to 15 right. Where is the<br/>note in the sound field? }<br/>   Perturb: Byte; { Make the note start a few milliseconds early or<br/>late, your choice. If it&apos;s 0 is no change, 10 is plus or minus 10<br/>milliseconds of the expected start time }<br/>   Glisand: Byte; { 0 is flat, 1-100 are 1024 element tables with sets<br/>of values.
