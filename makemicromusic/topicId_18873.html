Dave posted<br/>&gt; something about it, Cameron hastily responded that it explained his<br/>&gt; Ginkgo scale, and then somebody else chimed in that a revolution was<br/>&gt; afoot!</p><p>This is not to your usual standards, LOL. A simple read through<br/>(which isn&apos;t going to happen in the tangled Yahoo underbrush of<br/>course) will reveal that I posted the coincidences of the tuning with<br/>Erv Wilson&apos;s Scale Tree. I disagree with several of Dave&apos;s points,<br/>and the metastable and noble intervals he has presented could never<br/>produce the tuning I posted, which also something easily verified.<br/>The intervals are there on the Scale Tree, they are not there in the<br/>noble intervals. Quite simple.</p><p>Nobody claimed that a revolution was afoot, unless I missed something<br/>(not impossible). I didn&apos;t see anything but extremely old, even<br/>ancient, ideas being discussed. Finding euphonious intervals of<br/>different characters between the simple Just consonances is an<br/>activity thousands of years old.</p><p>&gt;But in reality, it&apos;s all too easy to hear things.</p><p>You said it. :-D</p><p>&gt;As Dave<br/>&gt; pointed out, metastable intervals don&apos;t &quot;explain&quot; Cameron&apos;s scale.</p><p>Yes, I consider the &quot;metastable&quot; intervals just a small subset of<br/>possible &quot;shadow&quot; intervals, as I have said more than once. They are<br/>easily to describe mathematically which makes them more attractive,<br/>maybe, but they&apos;re just &quot;a&quot; thing, not &quot;the&quot; thing. I strongly<br/>disagree that phi-weighted mediants need to be noble, for one thing.</p><p>&gt; Not only do people trust their experiences too much, they seem to<br/>&gt; ego-identify with them.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe in &quot;ego&quot; and &quot;id&quot; and all that, but if those concepts<br/>are part of your religious beliefs, I&apos;ll respect them as such. At any<br/>rate- so what? Let the ideas battle it out, who cares about who<br/>identifies with what.</p><p>&gt;That&apos;s not my problem, but I should try to<br/>&gt; be more sensitive to it.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t have a clue about whether or not you &quot;ego-identify&quot; with<br/>anything you say, even if I believed in such things. What you should,<br/>in my opinion, do is not woefully underestimate other people&apos;s<br/>intelligence. Some of those here who do give a hoot about any of this<br/>are going to spot, or should I say already have spotted, the conflict<br/>between the idea of which the metastable intervals are only an<br/>example and some ideas or practices basic to the regular temperament<br/>paradigm.</p><p>Put simply, the audible presence of &quot;metastable&quot; (or whatever)<br/>intervals means for one thing that the fields of attraction of Just<br/>intervals are probably not smooth. We talked about this quite some<br/>time ago. Realize that at that time you didn&apos;t &quot;shoot down&quot; the idea<br/>that the regions around the simple Just intervals are &quot;lumpy&quot; to the<br/>ear, you simply disagreed with it.</p><p>If the &quot;fields of attraction&quot; are smooth, the audible presence of<br/>&quot;metastable&quot; intervals would most likely require such fields, in<br/>practice, to be small- and asymmetrical.</p><p>And so either way adios to assuming that an interval makes a &quot;better<br/>approximation&quot; in an audible rather than merely a numerical sense<br/>simply because it is closer to the &quot;goal&quot; in sheer size than another<br/>interval is.</p><p>At any rate, carry on, hahaha!

That&apos;s why I gave up on my music theory thread - I have my<br/>&gt;&gt; ideas<br/>&gt;&gt;about it (that thread became a mixture of like 4 or 5 originally separate<br/>&gt;&gt;concepts), and I felt like they were all being shot down because they<br/>&gt;&gt; didn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;fit in with the current models. But being as my thread was about critically<br/>&gt;&gt;evaluating the current models, it didn&apos;t make sense for that reaction to<br/>&gt;&gt;occur. Actually, the main problem I ran into was that a lot of my ideas<br/>&gt;&gt; were<br/>&gt;&gt;really just meditations on my experiences, and when those were shot down,<br/>&gt;&gt; it<br/>&gt;&gt;was almost like the experience was being shot down and being told to fit<br/>&gt;&gt;into some other box which isn&apos;t what I experienced at all. I then read a<br/>&gt;&gt;whole bunch of papers because I thought I misunderstood the current model,<br/>&gt;&gt;which I partially did. But the whole thing actually threw me way off track<br/>&gt;&gt;with those ideas, so I just started doing my own work on them and figured<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d come back later when I had them more sorted out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well first, sorry you had that experience. A lot of it was my fault.<br/>&gt; You were putting out a lot of text and I felt obliged to reply when<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t really have the time. I shouldn&apos;t have. That said you<br/>&gt; should probably try to keep your reply ratio below 10:1 when someone<br/>&gt; engages you on a mailing list you&apos;re new to.</p><p>rofl. sage advice.</p><p>&gt; I would also like to suggest that you shouldn&apos;t take offense if your<br/>&gt; experiences are shot down. People seem to trust their experiences<br/>&gt; far too much. Human experiences are highly untrustworthy (that being<br/>&gt; said we don&apos;t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and<br/>&gt; mainstream &quot;science&quot; often does that too, with absurd notions like<br/>&gt; &apos;babies don&apos;t feel pain&apos; and such going on for years).</p><p>I know where you&apos;re coming from here, and I&apos;ve flip-flopped for a long<br/>time between the two approaches. Here&apos;s my rationale for trusting my<br/>experiences:</p><p>Whenever I come across a theory that seems to not only explain my<br/>experience, but points at the cause in a way that makes intuitive<br/>sense and that I can also experience, I usually go &quot;holy shit! aha!&quot; A<br/>lot of psychological theories had moments like that for me. But when<br/>we come to theories that explain PERCEPTION, we have to be wary of<br/>those that start off like this:</p><p>1) what you&apos;re experiencing isn&apos;t really what&apos;s happening<br/>2) what is really happening is this other thing.</p><p>Because imo, over time, the theories that are axed first are those<br/>ones. The theories that tend to stick around are more like this:</p><p>1) what you&apos;re experiencing IS what&apos;s really happening<br/>2) here&apos;s another facet of what&apos;s really happening that you might not<br/>have noticed. here&apos;s the way that you piece together your perception.<br/>And it&apos;s usually something you can look at and go &quot;oh wow, how the<br/>hell did they ever notice that?&quot; I imagine that&apos;s the reaction a lot<br/>of people gave when Rameau first introduced them to the phantom<br/>fundamental from back in the day.</p><p>As you yourself said, it&apos;s all too easy to come up with theories that<br/>don&apos;t hold. So when the incoming information I&apos;m receiving is that my<br/>experience is different from what a theory would predict, I have two<br/>options:</p><p>1) dig deep and search for why the theory isn&apos;t working here and come<br/>up with ways to amend it<br/>or<br/>2) doubt my experience and say that the theory is actually right but I<br/>can&apos;t perceive how.</p><p>I have made it a point to opt for the former. In a lot of fields,<br/>however, the latter approach seems to be far too common.</p><p>One place where people run into this is when they&apos;re confronted with a<br/>perceptual experience that contradicts some neuroscientific (or even<br/>pseudo-neuroscientific) theory of the brain&apos;s behavior. In fact, most<br/>people treat the brain within the paradigm that it &quot;controls them&quot; and<br/>that its effects are unperceivable. I view these as artifacts from<br/>that neuroscience is still a nascent field.</p><p>Within a broad context, these issues are where scientific fields run<br/>into problems that are usually viewed by most people as trivially<br/>philosophical. For example, the concept of dualism vs. monism is what<br/>is really at stake here - is the world made up of two separate<br/>entities, the mental/perceptual and the physical? The mind and the<br/>brain? The software and the hardware? Or, is it really one huge<br/>entity, the perceptual and the physical? So in this way these issues,<br/>which are usually relegated to zen meditation and such, suddenly<br/>become pertinent to scientific study, and hence science will<br/>eventually work its way through some very philosophical issues over<br/>time.</p><p>That being said, I still need to get a better grasp at the<br/>fundamentals of harmonic entropy and these fields of attraction. I<br/>didn&apos;t really get a clear grasp on it from our discussion on the<br/>thread, and it might very well answer my questions to the point where<br/>I&apos;m happy/</p><p>&gt; Take for example the recent thing with metastable intervals. Dave posted<br/>&gt; something about it, Cameron hastily responded that it explained his<br/>&gt; Ginkgo scale, and then somebody else chimed in that a revolution was<br/>&gt; afoot! But in reality, it&apos;s all too easy to hear things. As Dave<br/>&gt; pointed out, metastable intervals don&apos;t &quot;explain&quot; Cameron&apos;s scale.</p><p>Maybe what his scale needs isn&apos;t an &quot;explanation&quot; of _why_ we hear<br/>what we hear as much as it needs an elucidating of _what_ we&apos;re<br/>actually hearing. Something that is actually just a verbal expression<br/>of what we feel about it and perhaps even makes sense to him as to why<br/>he came up with the image of &quot;Ginkgo&quot; for it.</p><p>&gt; Not only do people trust their experiences too much, they seem to<br/>&gt; ego-identify with them. That&apos;s not my problem, but I should try to<br/>&gt; be more sensitive to it.</p><p>Well, given the kind of posts I&apos;ve seen around here about &quot;the piagui<br/>perfect scale&quot; and various &quot;ingenious algorithms,&quot; I could see how I&apos;d<br/>get put in that box. But honestly I&apos;m not looking for fame as much as<br/>I&apos;m looking for understanding, and not just an understanding of the<br/>current theories but an understanding of my own experiences, similar<br/>to how Cameron is trying to explain his experience of character<br/>families.</p><p>I sometimes have synesthetic responses to music myself, and there are<br/>ideas that are incompatible with my responses (and so if I believe<br/>them, the responses go away), and then there are ideas that elucidate<br/>my responses and often give an insight into why they are what they<br/>are. I think that everyone is synesthetic to some extent (hence that<br/>music creates feelings), and I think the &quot;feeling&quot; gets sucked out of<br/>music in this way.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19078 href="#19078">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 1:49:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>Thanks for sending this.

In the first case the numbers will bounce around this interval, in the second case they will not. I prefer the former cause you get more variation with say each pentatonic.

What do you mean by<br/>&gt; take 486. cents out 12 times... I don&apos;t get the column on the<br/>&gt; right if I make a standard linear chain out of 486-cent 4ths.<br/>&gt; I get something more like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0: 1/1 0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>&gt; 1: 34.111 cents 34.111<br/>&gt; 2: 226.356 cents 226.356<br/>&gt; 3: 260.466 cents 260.466<br/>&gt; 4: 294.577 cents 294.577<br/>&gt; 5: 486.822 cents 486.822<br/>&gt; 6: 520.933 cents 520.933<br/>&gt; 7: 713.178 cents 713.178<br/>&gt; 8: 747.289 cents 747.289<br/>&gt; 9: 781.399 cents 781.399<br/>&gt; 10: 973.644 cents 973.644<br/>&gt; 11: 1007.755 cents 1007.755<br/>&gt; 12: 1200.000 cents 1200.000<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you give a little more details? thanks. -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
