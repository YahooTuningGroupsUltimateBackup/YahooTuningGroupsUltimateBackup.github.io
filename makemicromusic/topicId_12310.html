I don&apos;t mean the scale but a<br/>&gt;&gt;   piece of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Differentiate what? The nearest pitches from each other? The EDO as a<br/>&gt; whole from other EDOs?</p><p>You can&apos;t simply ask this question.</p><p>The answer depends on context.  What instrument/timbre?  What&apos;s the tempo? Do we have time to hear beating between notes in a harmony?  Is the music one line,  or is it with chords?  Are lines doubled,  or solo?  Is it played by humans or computer?  How wide is the instrument&apos;s vibrato?</p><p>Etc. etc. etc. etc.</p><p>Do you think you could tell the difference of even 24-EDO, or even, 12-EDO, in a (not so great) opera singer?</p><p>On the other hand,  with the RTCMIX (<a href="http://www.rtcmix.org">www.rtcmix.org</a>)  STRUM instrument,  I can hear intervals, melodically,  of a difference of just a few cents.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 8:43:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Etc. etc. etc. etc.</p><p>Techno-speak! :)</p><p>&gt;On the other hand,  with the RTCMIX (<a href="http://www.rtcmix.org">www.rtcmix.org</a>)  STRUM instrument,  I can hear intervals, melodically,  of a difference of just a few cents.</p><p>A story I&apos;ve told often before, so I&apos;ll just paraphrase: in my first Partch production, we had to sing a descending line that included intervals a couple cents apart, and *not* EDO (obviously). At first, it seemed impossible; in time, those very small intervals seemed - in context, and with practice - as wide as a country mile.</p><p>Sure, there are limits. But some of the most important limits are the ones we refuse to place on ourselves.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 9:38:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; A story I&apos;ve told often before,</p><p>It&apos;s the first time I heard it :)</p><p>Also, it&apos;s not just the smallness of the spacing that counts.  It took<br/>me a while to learn to sing (kind-of) accurate quarter-tones... on the<br/>other hand, when I wrote a vocal melody that went  5/4 - 35/32 - 9/8 -<br/>1/1, I picked it up right away without even hearing it, even though<br/>35/32 - 9/8 is 35/36, or about 49 cents.  But because I hear the<br/>second and third notes in the sequence relating to the first and<br/>fourth, it&apos;s easy.  I would suspect that I could sing a lot closer<br/>intervals that way then in a large edo without rational<br/>approximations.</p><p>-chris</p></div>
