No cover to blow -- the only predetermined pitches in the entire piece is 3/2, which glides simultaneously up to 2/1 and down to 1/1.  All the other pitches are generated sum and different tones that are continuously generated based on the gliding pitches in relation to 1/1, 2/1, and each other.  So, essentially every pitch between 1/1 and 2/1 is heard at some point or other!</p><p>It&apos;s fun to set endpoints of the curves only and let the other pitches emerge once you set it in motion.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; Can&apos;t say i reacted to it on the level of consonance /dissonance as it &gt; seemed to just be molting in a world of it&apos;s own.<br/>&gt;  Marcus hobbs with Erv and stephan tayor did a piece where they expanded &gt; a generator as a gliss and the music would proceed in different mos &gt; sclaes made from it, twisting and turning at various points.<br/>&gt;  I noticed you slid past a few 12 ET intervals, but maybe i shouldn&apos;t &gt; have blown your cover.</p></div><h3><a id=9959 href="#9959">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2005 8:31:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jacob, glad you liked it.

Because I&apos;m working in Csound, which is really a programming language (and because I&apos;m a programmer by profession), it&apos;s natural for me to think in terms of process.
