It&apos;s available at -<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf</a></p><p>This is mostly about where to place the frets so that one<br/>can bend notes as usual, but also considers factors which<br/>makes more chords playable.</p><p>There are so many alternate open-string tunings for guitars.<br/>I guess that one of the more important considerations<br/>must be how dense or open you want your chord sonorities<br/>to be.  If you tune in alternating fifths and fourths, you have<br/>relatively open and wide chords, with only two intervals to the<br/>octave; while you can tune if you like, using different thirds and<br/>fourths, so that you get three or four intervals to the octave,<br/>in relatively close and narrow chords.</p><p>The closer structures also require less hand movement to reach<br/>a given interval, useful for quick melodic fingering.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; pleased to say they were non-destructive esperiments, and can easily<br/>&gt; be repeated without any real expense.</p><p>&gt; When I got the guitar, I saw I could easily slip a pen underneath<br/>&gt; the strings to act as a movable bridge, and tension it by jamming a<br/>&gt; thin bit of plastic (actually, the handle of a pink feather duster!)<br/>&gt; under one end.  The pen was a cheap gel one, with an almost straight<br/>&gt; plastic barrel, from K-Mart.  A ball-point would do just as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Success!
