I used<br/>scala&apos;s midi relay which went equally smooth, and did in fact seem<br/>to produce polyphony.</p><p>on fts: the computer having troubles lacks a modem or means to<br/>connect to the internet. I had to reinstall the os because it kept<br/>freaking out. So I haven&apos;t really had to email an error report :(<br/>the good news is i should be registering the software soon.</p><p>todd</p></div>
