This makes it<br/>possible to work with virtually any scale imaginable. While admittedly the<br/>app is missing certain important features at this point, I hope it will<br/>nonetheless be useful as a kind of playground to those working with<br/>microtonal music.</p><p>You can download Nihavent for Windows and Mac OS X at:</p><p><a href="http://www.nihavent.net/index_en.html">http://www.nihavent.net/index_en.html</a></p><p>All questions and comments are welcome.</p><p>Utku Uzmen</p></div><h3><a id=22514 href="#22514">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2010 2:07:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Utku,</p><p>I&apos;ve been playing with this in the minutes since you posted.<br/>I&apos;m having some trouble getting it to behave as expected, and<br/>already I have some suggestions.

Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but I&apos;m pretty sure<br/>A) Many Asian nations use pentatonic scales which are subsets of 12TET (only bending &quot;out of key&quot; every now and then for only short intervals) and K-pop, J-pop, etc. ...are most often simply in 12TET.</p><p>B) Indian classical music does use micro-tonal melodies, but 12TET chords such as A-minor for the backing and/or a drone which never changes in pitch and acts to &quot;mask&quot; the dissonance between any chords formed by droning notes from melodies.  Meanwhile Indian pop music IE Bhangra gravitates toward completely unmodified 12TET.</p><p>C) Arab music, again, appears to use 24TET IE micro-tonal melodies, but over 12TET backing chords.  In a similar sense I never thought Turkish &quot;Maqam&quot; music ever had many chords either...hence I have always thought Ozan&apos;s scales were unique by virtue of making Maqam-like scales which allow lots of chords that didn&apos;t sound un-confident AKA &quot;un-controllably dissonant&quot;.</p><p>  For example the page <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat.html</a> says<br/>&quot;Arabic  music is mostly melodic, which means it rarely includes harmony  and chords. There are a few exceptions, read more in this excellent  article about Harmony  and Arabic Music. The main reason why harmony is rarely used  is that chords don&apos;t sound very pleasant when they include quarter  tones or microtonal variations. &quot;</p><p>    The only genre where I see micro-tonal harmony come up a whole lot is in neo-classical which, sadly, does not seem to catch on much in audience beyond academics.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22522 href="#22522">ðŸ”—</a>Utku Uzmen &#x3C;utku@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 4:25:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for all the kind words.

But in the Tuning window, you should be able to export the selected tuning to a standalone tuning file (.ntu), and import tunings from standalone tuning files and scores. If you import from a score, it will bring in all the tunings defined in that score. So it should be possible to have a &quot;tuning library&quot; folder that you refer to whenever creating a score. If you want to keep a bunch of tunings together, you could also store them in an empty score file for easy importing.
