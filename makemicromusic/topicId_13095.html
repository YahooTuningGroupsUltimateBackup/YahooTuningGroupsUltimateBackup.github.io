New material presented at the end of a piece, perfect.  This<br/>one was in a pretty rigid form, though, and I hoped the form would<br/>give the uninitiated something concrete to grasp.<br/>This JI is by no means beautiful just as tuning, and if you heard it<br/>without the FOF filters and LFOs, you would hear plenty of chords<br/>that beat.

New material presented at the end of a piece, perfect.</p><p>I think it&apos;s agreeed by the vast majority of theorists that all good<br/>music works that way.</p><p>I took an interesting class during my undergrad on music and<br/>psychology, it dealt a lot with listener expectation.  For instance if<br/>some event &quot;A&quot; happens, the expectation of the listener is that the<br/>next event will also be &quot;A.&quot;  If the next event actually happens to be<br/>something different, &quot;B,&quot; and B is incrementally related to &quot;A&quot;<br/>(louder, higher, slower, etc), then the listener expectation for the<br/>third event will be &quot;C,&quot; where C is a continuation of the movement<br/>between A and B.  Those rules apply to everything from note-to-note<br/>events to large-scale structure.</p><p>Therefore, in order for music to not surprise the listener, the only<br/>possibly form is A-A-A-A... and not even Phillip Glass can keep that<br/>up forever ;)  Only slightly more surprising is<br/>A-B-C-D-E...[infinity], which can&apos;t last for long!  And anyone in<br/>their right mind would find either form boring, because surprise is a<br/>neccessary ingredient for interest.</p><p>From this perspective, good music is a tricky balance of satisfied<br/>expectations, delayed expectations, and denied expectations.

That is, ABBA is not<br/>interchangable with BAAB.  The characters of the themes and sub-themes,<br/>etc, and the interactions and contrasts between them, always plays a<br/>part in listener response.  Of course practicing musicians know this<br/>intuitively, but theorists can forget it sometimes.<br/>I was kind of infuriated when the most respected theory teacher at my<br/>school listened to a Zappa piece I wanted to talk about and immediately<br/>reduced all of the theme changes to letter names.  To my mind there was<br/>only one theme in the entire beginning, and everything else was there<br/>to thwart it and make the listener expect it to be thwarted, but he<br/>named all of the interruptions as themes, even though they were absent<br/>from the rest of the piece, and treated them as all equal.</p><p>-Chuckk</p></div>
