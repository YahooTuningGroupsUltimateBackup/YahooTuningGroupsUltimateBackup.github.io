That being the case, taking the raw midi files - if they have them on the site - would accomplish the task with no effort save for downloading.</p><p>Though why anyone would do this is pretty much beyond me - does feeding any old piece into another tuning show anything interesting about the tuning?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
