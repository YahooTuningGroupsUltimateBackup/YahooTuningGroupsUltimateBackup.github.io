For someone<br/>else it might be various equal or unequal temperaments.</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m saying is, you can educate yourself on the vast array<br/>of possibilities (it is overwhelming, but you&apos;ll get through it, I<br/>promise!)  The Eikosany was an amazing mystery until Kraig spelled it<br/>out for me.  Then, once you&apos;ve found theories and techniques that work<br/>for you, you can think about finding a school or teacher that can help<br/>you write convincing music.  That&apos;s what&apos;s worked for me, anyway.</p><p>&gt; I hope this group is friendly, and can help me find my<br/>&gt; way. I&apos;ve been experimenting with a fretless baritione<br/>&gt; guitar. Does anyone know where I can find out what the<br/>&gt; notes on it are?</p><p>Remember that &quot;the notes&quot; are whatever you make them.  The question<br/>isn&apos;t where the notes are, but where you want to put them :)  I would<br/>start with a computer, playing the pitches that you can then match<br/>(and mark) on the guitar.  Other people would suggest finding pitches<br/>you like intuitively.  Either way, like anything else in music, it&apos;s<br/>about finding what you like and pursuing it.</p><p>I hope that helps!</p><p>-Chris</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2005 4:55:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>tenney. he seems to concentrate on the diamond, i think</p><p>ambassadorbob wrote:</p><p>&gt;--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;there is a class on tuning at Cal arts<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Who&apos;s teaching it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yahoo!

I remember spending a lot of time<br/>learning the sounds and positions of harmonics I could make on the<br/>strings and it helped cheating a little at first with pencil marks.<br/>Also I listened carefully to beats between different pitches,<br/>experimenting how I could change or anticipate them, this was a lot<br/>easier with frets but now there&apos;s a transformer where I practise that<br/>I can use kind of like a drone.</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2005 8:28:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; the first guitar I had was an electric</p><p>fretless, makes it a little clearer</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 11:59:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Molly Jacobs</p><p>&gt; I hope this group is friendly, and can help me find my<br/>&gt; way.
