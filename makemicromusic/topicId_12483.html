In my case, I suspect<br/>there would be more people who would pay not to have to listen to my<br/>music than would eventually learn to like it. This does not mean I<br/>write bad stuff, just that tastes differ. Someone listening to it at<br/>least knows what they are getting into, in that it is all complexly<br/>structured xenharmonic weirdness, and if that isn&apos;t enough, there are<br/>short descriptions to go with each piece. I think a few words about<br/>each of your pieces would be a great addition to your ArtistGigs page.</p><p>&gt;   Of the above three, only &quot;&apos;Ud &amp; Nay&quot; is short enough not to bore you.</p><p>Mahler&apos;s Third Symphony isn&apos;t long enough to bore me. What will bore<br/>me is not finding enough that my ear thinks is interesting. I did like<br/>&apos;Ud and Nay the best of these three; I think more happened in less<br/>space of time, and it had less of a pop sound to it. That is another<br/>tastes differ issue of course.</p></div>
