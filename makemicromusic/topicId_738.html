For the theatre thing,<br/>it seemed the *more* reverb and effects, the &quot;better...&quot;  Of course,<br/>I was trying to evoke a kind of &quot;spiritual&quot; world of _The Tempest_<br/>which lent itself to a &quot;misty&quot; fuzziness...</p><p>However, in the blackjack piece, I&apos;m finding that reverb is<br/>distorting the precision of the tuning and of the rhythmic<br/>placement.  In several of my previous electronic efforts I used *no*<br/>post-processing at all, for this same reason.</p><p>I may use *no* or very limited &quot;post-stuff&quot; on the blackjack piece...<br/>so it will be very &quot;flat&quot; but I like the &quot;primary colors&quot; of that<br/>approach... particularly when matched with a live instrument.</p><p>Anybody have any commentary on this... any similar experiences or<br/>suggestions??</p><p>I would appreciate it.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to upload the blackjack piece to <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> very soon.  There<br/>is a slight problem with them, now, though.  It takes forever unless<br/>one is a &quot;Premium Artist&quot; which costs $20 per month.  It costs $20<br/>for *EACH* separate artist page one has... I have *THREE* now... so I<br/>would be paying $60 per month if I wanted the &quot;quickie&quot; service...</p><p>So, I&apos;m willing to wait, unless it takes *months* for approval...</p><p>_________ _________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=739 href="#739">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>8/28/2001 6:54:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;9mg720+t5ur@...&gt;<br/>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I may use *no* or very limited &quot;post-stuff&quot; on the blackjack piece...<br/>&gt; so it will be very &quot;flat&quot; but I like the &quot;primary colors&quot; of that<br/>&gt; approach... particularly when matched with a live instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anybody have any commentary on this... any similar experiences or<br/>&gt; suggestions??</p><p>I always prefer a bit of reverb added to a TX81Z.
