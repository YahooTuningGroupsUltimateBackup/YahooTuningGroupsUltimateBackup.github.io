Hell, look at all the incredible variety of 12 eq music there is; throw in some more notes, and the possibilities get huge. And, a couple of things that are important to me about using different systems: for one, you gotta take what the tuning gives you, and go with that. For example, George mentioned that 34 doesn&apos;t get the 7th harmonic sound very well, and he&apos;s right. So, I just won&apos;t worry about that interval in 34, and I&apos;ll deal with whatever else it may have to offer, which is a lot.<br/>   And, of course temperaments were developed to play chordal music more in tune...but, if a musician isn&apos;t interested in playing jazz, blues, rock, folk, country, etc, or classical, than I can see why temperaments wouldn&apos;t interest them very much. But, I play many styles, so I like being conversant with different concepts, and how to apply them. I&apos;m composing more on fretless now, using tunings from the Harmonic Series, but still very interested in different temperaments. I have also noticed over the years, that there really aren&apos;t many tuning folks who actually play music for a living, or have played a lot of more American &quot;pop&quot; styles, so there really haven&apos;t been many tunes composed in that style yet (Catler excepted). And I think the more that begins to happen, the more general acceptance there will be of non 12 tunings. Most people just want to be entertained, or dance...it was the lack of danceable music that made audiences wary of be bop, and a lot of micro music has often been perceived as maybe a bit &quot;weird&quot; by a lot of folks. And some of it was/is.<br/>   Anyway, there it is...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>George D.

Since<br/>12-et also has a reasonably good 17, it makes for familiar territory<br/>in some ways, but the 34-et version of 10:12:17 is of course much<br/>closer to JI. And, of course, if you use dominant seventh chords in<br/>12-et you can certainly use them in 34-et also, where they are in<br/>better tune, and overtones be damned.</p><p>&gt;And I think the more that begins to happen, the more general<br/>acceptance there will be of non 12 tunings. Most people just want to<br/>be entertained, or dance...</p><p>But there are also people like me, who basically don&apos;t care about all<br/>that, and want something *interesting*, dammit. Microtonality is great<br/>for that, so that&apos;s another potential audience.</p></div>
