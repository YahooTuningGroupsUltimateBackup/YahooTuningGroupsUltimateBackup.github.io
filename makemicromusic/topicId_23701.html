Feb 7 through May 2.</p><p>&quot;MicrotonalDesign is a seminar for unsticking  the ear and everything attached<br/>to it. To design in Microtonalsystems is to offer an alternative to what<br/>everyone already knows, to  sing &ldquo;out of tune&rdquo; with conventional wisdom.  It is<br/>a unique  contribution to the question of designing a society.  We don&apos;t have to<br/>accept our culture&apos;s One True Tuning. You don&apos;t have to be an expert.  You do<br/>have to be willing to experiment!  Domains to design in include:  new and<br/>modified instruments, scales, scores, language, tools, concert  formats.<br/>MicrotonalDesign is taught by members  of Oddmusic U-C. All levels of experience<br/>are welcome.&quot;</p><p>We anticipate meeting about 7 hours a week, divided into three sessions.   One<br/>session would be for developing a vocabulary for talking about  Microtonal<br/>Design (borrowing, I suspect, from School for Designing a  Society and<br/>microtonal theory, generating more no doubt); another  session would be for<br/>working on microtonal projects (there should be a  good little crew for<br/>collaborations); and another session would be a  plenary meeting with two other<br/>focus groups: &quot;Feminist Composition and  Design&quot; and &quot;Connecting Cybernetics to<br/>Social Change&quot;.  Except for the  plenary meeting, the other two focus groups<br/>would meet separately and  occasionally cross-pollinate on projects.</p><p>We&apos;re offering project groups &amp; individuals access to the Oddmusic studio space<br/>and instrument library as needed and smaller group tutoring &amp; lessons as<br/>desired.  There are also opportunities to get involved with a local radio show,<br/>volunteer with the Oddmusic instrument library (microtonal outreach?), organize<br/>concerts &amp; events, unionize audiences, etc, etc!  Y&apos;know, dreamy things....</p><p>Also, there might be shorter periods within the 12 weeks for people who can<br/>only stay a short while.  That will depend on interest as well as a  dozen other<br/>interesting constraints.</p><p>Applications are coming in and it&apos;s not too late to start a  dialogue.  Give me<br/>a call a.s.a.p. if you&apos;d like more info!  There are  lots of possibilities if<br/>you can&apos;t do the full three months or pay the  full tuition.  If this sounds<br/>exciting to you, I want to make it  possible, so let&apos;s talk!</p><p>(217)365-0313.</p><p>Much love,<br/>Andrew</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
