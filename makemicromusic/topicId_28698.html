I&apos;m making a sort of &quot;histogram&quot; of all possible intervals, and favoring transitions to scales with similar histograms. The change in harmonic language is a lot less jarring that way. I&apos;d thought of other constraints, but was initially working in 12-EDO and feared over-restricting things to just vanilla circle of fifths type stuff. Fortunately the scales of 53-EDO are are pretty richly connected (for the set I&apos;m using now there are something like 10-40 possible transitions for each scale), so I have a reasonable amount of freedom to play with different constraints. I&apos;ll have to do a lot more tinkering.</p></div>
