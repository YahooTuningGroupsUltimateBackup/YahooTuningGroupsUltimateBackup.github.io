JI.<br/>If after hearing this piece you think it isn&apos;t correct or in tune, then show<br/>me a version that&apos;s better!<br/>Either a different way of Just Intonation with for instance higher primes,<br/>or classic 5-limit JI with comma shifts (or a drifting version), or<br/>&quot;adaptive ji&quot; (oh how I hate adaprive ji, the big melody killer), or some<br/>temperament.<br/>Again, if you think this isn&apos;t right, then make a better one (or simply<br/>state you prefer 12tet, in which case you must be deaf).<br/>As you can see I&apos;ve included the Scala sequence file and open office doument<br/>with the tuning.<br/>Simply modify the ods file data and then copy paste the data into the Scala<br/>sequence file, then press &quot;transform sequence to midi file&quot; in Scala and<br/>it&apos;s done, couldn&apos;t be easyer.<br/>Please do provide the tuning so I can render it into thesame midi files with<br/>thesame sounds etc for a fair comparison.</p><p>Also, for my sake please discuss this piece on either this list or on the<br/>Just Intonation Yahoo group:<br/><a href="/JustIntonation/">/JustIntonation/</a><br/>As I am no longer a member of the Tuning Yahoo group.<br/>After Carl decided to moderate me after a message he didn&apos;t like, I decided<br/>to leave.<br/>Carl then sent me a message offlist to show his tuning of the beginning of<br/>Drei Equali (with the main melody horribly out of tune) after which we had a<br/>discussion after which Carl banned me from the tuning list.<br/>How the hell he got it in his mind to ban me while I&apos;m not even a member and<br/>after an offlist discussion which he started is beyond me, but anyhow I&apos;m<br/>not a member there and frankly the way Carl dominates every discussion there<br/>about JI with his strong anti-JI sentiment makes me glad I&apos;m out of there.</p><p>Now for some very simple comma problem solutions:<br/>4/3 5/3 2/1<br/>4/3 5/3 9/4<br/>3/2 15/8 9/4<br/>3/2 2/1 5/2<br/>4/3 5/3 2/1 8/3</p><p>or:<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2<br/>1/1 5/4 5/3 (or 1/1 4/3 5/3)<br/>9/8 4/3 5/3 (sounds way better if you give it a bass of 2/3)<br/>9/8 4/3 15/8 (or 9/8 3/2 15/8 etc)<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 2/1</p><p>This is the 1/1 5/4 27/16 chord which is most often mistaken for 1/1 6/5 3/2<br/>minor chord after which you&apos;d get a comma problem.<br/>The 1/1 5/4 27/16 is not a minor chord but a 1/1 5/4 3/2 major chord with<br/>9/8 ontop of the 3/2 and the 3/2 not played.<br/>I predict there is also a 1/1 6/5 3/2 16/9 chord (1/1 5/4 40/27 5/3, 1/1<br/>32/27 4/3 8/5) but I have no example of it yet and it doesn&apos;t occur in the<br/>drei equali piece.<br/>These 2 chords solve just about all real comma problems.<br/>Then it&apos;s simply working out what the chord progressions are, the movement<br/>of the true fundamental bass (which moves in consonant intervals) and the<br/>melodies etc and every piece can be put in JI.<br/>I&apos;m still working on good rules for these but this is not finished yet and<br/>have not included my clumsy attempts at this kind of analysis in the<br/>transcription.</p><p>As last words I&apos;d like to thank Petr Parizek for his email communications<br/>with me about this piece.<br/>It was very helpfull to have feedback, and Petr showed me a solution for<br/>measure 35-36 which I had previously abandoned myself, thank you!</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel de Velde</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21096 href="#21096">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2009 4:59:05 PM</span><button style="float: right;

Are you listening to<br/>the corrected version?<br/>In the corrected version I corrected a Bb note in melody 2 in measure 39,<br/>which did indeed make the Bb in measure 40 sound &quot;lower&quot;. In the corrected<br/>version both Bb in measure 39 and 40 are now thesame (Bb of) 10/3.<br/>( I made A4 15/4 for readability of the numbers, so if you&apos;re used to C as<br/>1/1 then simply substract a whole tone of all the ratios in the<br/>transcription)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nonetheless, this does sound good, and I&apos;d love to hear what your<br/>&gt; methodology behind all of this is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks :)<br/>My methodology has been to not quit trying to put this piece in JI and throw<br/>everything I could think of at it haha.<br/>So I have been trying to combine theory with the ear.<br/>Tried many different things, lost a lot of time trying out minor thirds like<br/>19/16 etc which ended up not working at all.<br/>Only recently when I got real close to this version I did theories get more<br/>hold but still used the ear too.<br/>In the end the theories that made this possible are the following:<br/>1: Prime 5-limit<br/>2: Melodies that are very clear to the ear don&apos;t have comma shifts.<br/>3: You can get comma shifts in harmonies but only if the note that shift is<br/>first part of one melody and then shifts because the note is then replaced<br/>by a note from another melody.<br/>4: 1/1 5/4 27/16 is a chord that is allowed under special circumstances and<br/>can be seen as for instance a major chord + whole tone. (also probably 1/1<br/>6/5 16/9 as I explained in my first message but it does not occur in this<br/>piece)<br/>5: The fundamental bass of a chord allways moves in consonant intervals. Now<br/>this one I&apos;m still not sure how to use because I&apos;m clumsy at a JI defenition<br/>of the fundamental bass. But everywhere in the piece the fundamental bass<br/>moves by either 3/2 5/4 or 6/5 or their inversions. In places where it seems<br/>the fundamental bass moves by 9/8 I have check to play the progressions as 2<br/>3/2 movements and this shows the hidden fundamental bass progression and<br/>allways works. However clumsy right now and still have a lot to work out<br/>this technique saved me from a lot of wrong progressions allready.<br/>6: When 2 tones move at thesame time in thesame way they keep thesame ratio<br/>to eachother (I explained this one in my previous post). I haven&apos;t studied<br/>counterpoint but I know it has rules that go something like this? Anyhow I<br/>see this as a sort of JI counterpoint rule :) Only found it recently, still<br/>have to work out what exactly defines an equal step and if there are any<br/>exceptions.<br/>7: I see scales as beeing built out of consonant progressions of the<br/>fundamental bass and major chords (perhaps minor chords too). Like 1/1 9/8<br/>5/4 4/3 3/2 5/4 15/8 2/1 is a major chord on 4/3 1/1 3/2 which is 2 times<br/>progressions of 3/2 of the fundamental bass, the simplest scale.</p><p>Marcel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=21099 href="#21099">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2009 3:13:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the corrected version I corrected a Bb note in melody 2 in measure 39,<br/>&gt; which did indeed make the Bb in measure 40 sound &quot;lower&quot;.

It is the structure of music.<br/>All music rules (other than rhythm (though related) and expression of<br/>playing etc) flow from this. The relation /ratio of pitches.<br/>I think normal music theory is severely lacking. It&apos;s a pseudoscience. To<br/>solve JI would make part of it a real science.<br/>A much better and deeper music theory can than be developed that is error<br/>free.<br/>Then composition programs etc can be made that&apos;ll do things that current<br/>programs could only dream of.

Their tuning is not close to JI in practical nor conceptual sense (if you don&apos;t mean that every interval can be approximated by some ratio and therefore every interval is JI). Their tuning is not based on our harmony-consonance-dissonance concept. It is not based on mathematical concept, it is very individual, personal and sometimes even secret art.<br/>Similarly Indian music which probably have underlying JI background due to drone but the consonance of fixed tones is not its the basic principle. Tone variation and bending is most important. The tuning is again something very personal. The mathematical theory of Indian tuning in our sense was created probably in 19. century under the European influence.<br/>Similarly the music of east Asia.

From my simplistic point of view it looks like<br/>&gt; the comma is being buried in the mistuned 4th.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t see it as a comma beeing burried but yes this is the most apparent<br/>difference between classical JI and my soltuion.<br/>But you will actually find thesame thing in everything which has a 9/8 whole<br/>tone on a 3/2 fifth.<br/>It&apos;s all simply the consequence of the 27/16 interval (wether the 1/1 of the<br/>27/16 is played or not)<br/>1/1 6/5 27/16 is actually thesame thing. Just not an interval there that<br/>lies close to 4/3.<br/>1/1 6/5 27/16 or 1/1 6/5 3/2 27/16 etc is widely accepted I assume. I hope<br/>thesame will happen for 1/1 5/4 3/2 27/16 and JI will have it&apos;s golden age.<br/>I think in some very special circumstances there are even chords with an<br/>81/64. Have not found any yet, but looks possible. (not as an alternative<br/>major chord or anything, please don&apos;t misunderstand me)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I think is your solution is understanding how the **great *a<br/>&gt; cappella *contrapuntal<br/>&gt; choral pieces of the Renaissance was performed, in practice, at the time.<br/>&gt; The reason I say this is because I would think at that time in history,<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; vocal music, JI was as much in practice as it ever would be.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes with a great choir I think so.<br/>Although I&apos;m not aware of how precise a choir actually sings.<br/>And it depends on the composition too probably how singable the melodies are<br/>for the choir.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I must say that when you said Lassus composed his piece wrong I was mightly<br/>&gt; turned off. I think the statement is absurd. However, it is totally proper<br/>&gt; to ask how did the performers interpret his score. My meager understanding<br/>&gt; of psycho acoustics and education suggest that the performers would<br/>&gt; naturally gravitate to pure intervals. And as a result put to practice at<br/>&gt; least a first approximation of JI.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah yes I&apos;m ashamed of this statement I did back then.<br/>I did retract it.<br/>However, the transcription of the Lassus piece was actually wrong.<br/>Someone put a major chord where Lassus wrote a minor chord (though this was<br/>a true 1/1 6/5 3/2 minor chord, not much difference tuning wise or for my<br/>solution)</p><p>However, I do still think the whole piece is a bit messy :)<br/>It doesn&apos;t have as nice a structure as the Beethoven piece for instance.<br/>And I also think it&apos;s possible to write bad sounding music, though this is<br/>just as apparent listening to it in 12tet as it is in JI.</p><p>Btw I&apos;ll soon tune the entire Lassus piece to JI.<br/>It&apos;s a comma hell, I expect many many dissonant fourths.<br/>I&apos;ve tried it twice before and horribly failed. So much that even I wouldn&apos;t<br/>dare post it (that&apos;s saying a lot as I usually have atleast a day where I<br/>belief something I just did is in tune, before reality sets in and my ear<br/>finally tells me all is not as right as I thought before haha)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps Charles can put a recording of Palestrina or Lassus into the<br/>&gt; evaluation copy of Melodyne DNA and find if indeed mis-tuned 4ths are<br/>&gt; present or not as a place to start to answer the question I pose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes this would be very very interesting to see.I expect they will indeed<br/>show up.<br/>Though in the beginning of the Lassus piece the dissonant fourths are placed<br/>in such a way that I suspect the averige choir will not sing them correctly<br/>but do some sort of adaptive JI (reacting to their error with a correction<br/>afterwards)<br/>But in many places and pieces I think the dissonant fourth will be correctly<br/>sung.

In fact, I think this has been discussed<br/>before quite a bit on these lists. You&apos;ll no doubt remember the C Eb+<br/>G Bb+ D F+ A C+ example I posted in every other thread a year or so<br/>ago. The two outer C&apos;s are in an 81/20 ratio.</p><p>Comma augmented intervals like that and the fourth above you mentioned<br/>are excitingly citric and dissonant when used in certain places.<br/>Sometimes it takes my ear a second to adjust, whereas at first I&apos;m<br/>like &quot;OH GOD THAT FOURTH IS OUT OF TUNE.&quot; But I don&apos;t think anyone was<br/>debating the usefulness of those intervals. Otherwise chords like C E<br/>G A D would be impossible to tune. However, played by themselves, they<br/>are noticeably more dissonant and don&apos;t blend as well, which is an<br/>observation worth noting.</p><p>&gt; Now the difficulty lies in correctly identifying when there&apos;s an actual 4/3<br/>&gt; fourth or when it&apos;s not really a normal fourth but a structure like the 4/3<br/>&gt; 5/3 9/4 in my example above.When correctly identifying this chord, not a<br/>&gt; normal minor triad, all of a sudden all the comma problems dissapear.<br/>&gt; And all of a sudden you can put any common practice classical music in JI,<br/>&gt; and everything works out.<br/>&gt; Just the fact that everything works out, and that four quints of which one<br/>&gt; is an inversion of the dissonant fourth gives 5/4 instead of 81/64 is a big<br/>&gt; suggestion in the direction that music has JI as it&apos;s basis.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s amazing to see how very complex music works out perfectly in JI, this<br/>&gt; can&apos;t be a coincidence.</p><p>I think the method you&apos;ve put forward here holds a lot of promise. I<br/>think that chords like 27:32:40 would work very rarely, but perhaps<br/>they do have their place. That being said, let&apos;s see this extended to<br/>the 11-limit, shall we? Perhaps the blues would be a good place to<br/>start looking.</p><p>Let&apos;s get 11-limit and higher versions of Debussy compositions and<br/>I&apos;ll be happy.</p><p>&gt; The advantage of JI is that it&apos;s the only system where everything is in<br/>&gt; tune.<br/>&gt; And it&apos;s the only system that can work as the basis of a perfect music<br/>&gt; theory.</p><p>Now, I wouldn&apos;t go that far. All that you&apos;re saying is that you&apos;re<br/>unwilling to explore the tonal and sonic possibilities of deliberately<br/>mistuning intervals. One such interval that I enjoy hearing mistuned<br/>quite a bit is the octave.

Stuff like Jacques Dudon&apos;s experimental scales rarely surface anymore.<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>   So here&apos;s a good (I hope) tempered scales question: do you know of any scales in composition that have come up in the past on this or the tuning list which you believe solve both problems fairly well.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, October 7, 2009 2:22:49 AM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Re: JI vs. temperament: have we gone too far?</p><p>Most of the Tuning list is dedicated to temperaments which are meant to do precisely as you describe- years (decades?) of work.
