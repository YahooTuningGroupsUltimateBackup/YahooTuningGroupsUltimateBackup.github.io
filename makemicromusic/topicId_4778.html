It seems as you mentioned in a latter post you mentioned tuning particular intervals and highly recomend this method. there are quite a few good tunings that use 12 tones one you can find here  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a><br/>which enables you to hear two harmonic series in part and a subharmonic one (it mirror image). most ETs have an appeal in that they approach many of these intervals so it seems best to hear them first and find what appeals to you. there is a David Canwright who also came up with a 12 tone tuning quite close to this which uses even higher harmonics ( up to 13) in place of some of the more interesting scales. we can get him to dig this out or if someone remembers we could put this up as a option.<br/>I realize i should have included the cents measurements and can send those if interested. but you mentioned blues thirds which we refer to as neutral thirds which can be substituted to in to either of the above systems. it seems best to get a hold of a small amount of notes and experiment with variations to find out just what it is you like. let your own ear lead you out of 12</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 3<br/>&gt;    Date: Fri, 30 May 2003 08:55:10 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;    From: Bonnie Goodwin &lt;goodwinbonnie@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Tuning systems and relative / perfect pitch<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Rick,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know about anyone else, but the way I hear pitch normally is to attempt to piace to the nearest 1/2 steop in 12 TET . Even if it is &quot;out of tune&quot; it is still a certain pitch or steop within that framework. After the traditional regimen of music theory and ear training that one gets in most batchlor programs, and years of taking off tunes for this gig and that gig, that&apos;s just the way my ears work. When listening to non 12TET, I almost experieince a vertigo like sensation trying to conceptualize what my ears hear into traditional pidgeon holes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does this explain how it works with me, currently? This is why I am forcing my ears to get more familar with non 12 TET systems. Fortunately, my ears are not exact perfect pitch,  which could drive someone nuts if something isn&apos;t pefectly in tune, my ears are able to adjust some to accommodate something that is recorded sharp or flat even though it is not exactly referenced to A=440, but still the ears are in analysis mode trying to analyse,catagorize the chord progressions melody and bass lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t intend to imply that relative pitch and 12TET are necessarily closely related, necessarily, but in my case, when music is played, my mind does these analysis things. It is to the point that I can only listen to music when concentrating on it specifically, otherwise I put talk radio on which can become blah, blah, blah when I need to concentrate on something else, but when listening to other than 12 TET, my ears are attempting to analyse it to the nearest semitone mentally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bonnie *:&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=4783 href="#4783">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;cb202@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2003 3:00:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re pigeon-holing to 12-tet, as opposed to simply<br/>vague interval &quot;ideals&quot; that 12-tet ITSELF &quot;pigeonholes&quot; to in your mind.</p><p>For example, if you hear an interval of 697 cents, you&apos;ll probably think<br/>&quot;5th.&quot;   But is your mind idealizing a 12-tet 5th of  700 cents, or maybe<br/>a 702-cent Just fifth, that you hear all the time inside the timbres of<br/>human voices?</p><p>Then if you hear an interval of 590 cents, are you hearing pigeonholing to<br/>600-cent 12-tet tritone, or perhaps to a 45/32 Just tritone, or maybe even<br/>to a 7/5 Just tritone?</p><p>It&apos;s probably true that there ARE intervals that you are used to, and that<br/>you try to squeeze unfamiliar intervals into.

Also<br/>that one can learn to distinguish better with time.</p><p>Also, two types of failure to distinguish. Can be that one can&apos;t<br/>hear a distinction at all and can be that one can hear that they<br/>don&apos;t quite seem the same but don&apos;t know which way is &quot;up&quot; as it were.<br/>Those who can&apos;t distinguish notes a semitone apart may hear them as<br/>distinct but not know the direction in this fashion - a matter of<br/>getting the topography of the pitch landscape sorted out and<br/>finding a map or compass more likely, for it.</p><p>In his orignal paper on Shepard tones, Shepherd found that<br/>some of his subjects (scientists at Bell laboratories)<br/>couldn&apos;t distinguish notes a semitone apart at all - they<br/>just sounded the same. But others could distinguish them<br/>but didn&apos;t know the direction and some of these could learn the direction<br/>when they came back after the experiment to find out more.</p><p>(Circularity in Judgements of Relative Pitch<br/>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America<br/>Volume 36, number 12<br/>pp. 2346-2353<br/>1964)</p><p>One can also learn to distinguish notes that one was unable to distinguish<br/>at all before - for one thing - notes that are louder seem higher in<br/>pitch if they are in the treble clef, and lower in pitch if they are<br/>at the bottom of the bass clef - just by a few cents. That is for<br/>a pure tone - or a waveform audio recorder just played with an increased<br/>amplitude. Players of acoustic instruments automatically raise the pitch<br/>slightly as the note fades away (for high pitched instruments - the other<br/>way for low pitched instruments such as cello or double bass) to compensate<br/>for this effect. You notice it often with sound card voices because no<br/>compensation occurs and you can maybe hear that the fade away of the sound<br/>seems a bit lower in pitch for high notes than the note itself.</p><p>If one learns to notice that, then working the other way one can learn to<br/>distinguish between volume and pitch changes in these notes,<br/>and be able to tell apart two notes of the same volume and varied<br/>in pitch and so go to finer distinctions than one could before.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=4787 href="#4787">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

With either playing items with the mouse, or better yet, using the Relay function to play the tunings with a midi keyboard, you can play any scale/tuning you can concoct. It would be easy for you to work on scales, attempting to sing pitches before you play them, etc. Ear training in new intonations is right at your fingertips, for free.</p><p>&gt;But I guess that it&apos;s impossible, (maybe unless you have the williams&apos; &gt;syndrom), to form a mental database of every microtone interval!</p><p>Nothing is impossible. It may be that you will come to know certain tunings, or certain intervals, better than other; nonetheless, I see no reason why the ear-brain connection can&apos;t be expected to become familiar with many types of intervals and tunings.</p><p>&gt;Another thing, I was talking to my accoustic teacher... What you guys have &gt;to say about that?</p><p>I&apos;d say that your teacher is not adequately informed, that he/she would get *serious* argument from a number of people on the various tuning lists, and that a teacher should not limit their students.</p><p>Intervals of very small distances are probably easier to hear in some context; heard harmonically might be easier than melodically, but it is all relative. The is, I am sure, some lower limit beyond which our distinction ends. But 2 cents seems awfully high, especially in light of the fact that one esteemed colleague has based a career somewhat around his ability to produce 1-cent differences at will.</p><p>Why not find out what *you* can do, instead of letting your instructors limit you?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&gt;Cheers<br/>&gt;Alex<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;__________________________________<br/>&gt;Do you Yahoo!?<br/>&gt;Yahoo!
