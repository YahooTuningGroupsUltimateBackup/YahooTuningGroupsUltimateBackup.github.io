Had to wait until I could get to a more<br/>&gt; robust internet connection to enjoy it in its full 41k encoding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are some interesting parts in there where the trombone and<br/>&gt; celeste-like timbre are playing in unisons.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Jacky!  Yes, I like that section, too... there&apos;s a three<br/>octave Blackjack gap there...!</p><p>&gt; Wanted to aks you if it is notated and your intention for the<br/>&gt; trombone to play these parts as exact pitches, or as glisses???<br/>Just curious.</p><p>Yes, the piece is notated in 72-tET.  It&apos;s all to be played in exact<br/>Blackjack pitches, if possible.  The &quot;slide glisses&quot; however are<br/>glisses rather than &quot;staircases...&quot;  I couldn&apos;t get the particular<br/>brass patch I was doing to do a continuous gliss... but that<br/>limitation is mentioned in the score.  (The &quot;music minus one&quot;<br/>trombone part is only for *practice* of course...)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Just thought I&apos;d mention that if you are interested in getting one<br/>&gt; of my TX81Z brass patches I&apos;ve made, which to me completely blows<br/>&gt; away the factory one on the unit, let me know. You&apos;ll need to be<br/>able to send SYSX to yer synth to use it though, and will need to use<br/>some aftertouch on it to control the brightness of the timbre. Does<br/>your board generate AT?? Not all do.)</p><p>Sure... I can experiment around with that.  I also have a patch<br/>editor that I believe can read sysex...  Not sure about<br/>the &quot;aftertouch&quot; though... I don&apos;t think so...</p><p>&gt; Keep up the good work brother!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks so much, Jacky!  I appreciate the feedback!</p><p>&gt; P.S. BTW - Hope everybody here in the US had a great Turkey Day and<br/>&gt; ate way too much food, and got to hang out with the family like I<br/>&gt; did. Was great fun! We really do have lots of things to be thankful<br/>&gt; for. One of which is the gathering of all you great folks in this<br/>&gt; here forum! Glad to be here with you all!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; : )<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Jacky.

If the latter, it may be possible to input AT values after recording (seems like more than one seq will let you &apos;draw&apos; the curves of various modifier values), and you could shape the sounds that way.</p><p>This topic, esp with Jacky&apos;s mention of TX81Z patches, got me thinking.
