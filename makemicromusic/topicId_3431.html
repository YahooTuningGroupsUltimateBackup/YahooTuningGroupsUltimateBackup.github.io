I love finishing a tuning with an<br/>audience collecting, saying &apos;Well, I&apos;m done&apos; and then playibg a<br/>grand D flat major chord, sounding, well, really out-of-tune -- and<br/>then of course grandly resolving it to D....</p><p>But I suppose I should replace the phrase &apos;sound terrible&apos; with<br/>some circumlocution like &apos;Sound quite out-of-tune to conventional<br/>ears&apos;.</p><p>&gt; I think you would have enjoyed the discussion on acceptable<br/>&gt; fifths we had in this group a while back.</p><p>I&apos;ll check the archives sometime, thanks for the pointer.</p><p>Judy</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 12:04:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., judithconrad@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Jeff,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; closed only by a wolf fifth so big NOBODY would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; recognise it as a fifth<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For those just joining us, we&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; the wolf fifth at 758.286 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s an odd thing, I had sent my meantone instructions to a very<br/>&gt; nice retired college professor who specializes in such things a<br/>&gt; while ago, and he basically liked them but had a few criticisms.<br/>&gt; One of them was that I had said something about how the modern<br/>&gt; ET out-of-tune major thirds would have been offensive to the<br/>&gt; Renaissance ear, and he said &quot;We don&apos;t know that, just say they&apos;re<br/>&gt; out of tune, don&apos;t do pop psych on dead people!&quot; or words to that<br/>&gt; effect.
