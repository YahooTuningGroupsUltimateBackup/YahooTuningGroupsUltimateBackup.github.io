A nice mix opf people from various sorts of<br/>&gt; backgrounds, including both a member of this list with a doctorate<br/>&gt; in composition and an 80-year-old lady who worked in textile mills<br/>&gt; her whole working life, who is now making bobbin lace for a hobby<br/>&gt; and was ecstatic at sight of the portrait of Holy Roman Emperor<br/>&gt; Ferdinand III, with his lace collar. &quot;You know how much that stuff<br/>&gt; costs per inch?&quot; she asked. It was a rhetorical question, I still<br/>&gt; don&apos;t. But it was a good mix of people, who seemed quite attentive<br/>&gt; and interested. There was even a photographer from teh Fall River<br/>&gt; Herald News, who is middle aged and black and goes by the name<br/>&gt; &apos;Omar Bradley&apos;, who showed up on his day off (having photographed<br/>&gt; on orders of his boss a number of my concerts before and found<br/>&gt; them interesting) and smapped roll after roll of film, with a clicking<br/>&gt; noise which in the sonic world of the clavichord sounds rather like a<br/>&gt; gunshot and did not always happen on the downbeat -- but he<br/>&gt; meant it as a compliment. Nothing was in the paper today, but if it<br/>&gt; appears later I shall send the URL.</p><p>That sounds a fine occasion great!</p><p>Well you nearly always seem to get something in the way of extra sounds in a live<br/>concert :-).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tuning? Well, bad news here. Yesterday, in the course of the 4<br/>&gt; hours before the concert the temperature rose 30 degrees and the<br/>&gt; humidity rose 40 percentage points or more. So things were not<br/>&gt; perfectly stable (and alas a number of keys on the instrument got<br/>&gt; quite sluggish). Life is like that, and you just have to live wtih it. I<br/>&gt; tuned a half hour before the concert started, and then I did the best<br/>&gt; I could. If I had spent the last 10 minutes before I started to play<br/>&gt; touching up the tuning and easing a few keys, while making the<br/>&gt; audience sit perfectly still, perhaps the absolute sound would have<br/>&gt; been better; but at what cost in creation of discuomfort?</p><p>Yes indeed.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It went well. Rollicking good party afterwards too, with Bach violin<br/>&gt; sonatas and some atonal works too!</p><p>Great, glad it went well.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
