And oddly, not low enough to motivate me to buy &gt;the songs.</p><p>Hmmm, I used to be able to stream any 128 file on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>. But this points out the value of having the files in a couple of different formats, and while it may not be open source, people do _not_ have problems with RealAudio streaming, and I would venture to guess the same for Windows Media (yeah, I know, yuck, but the point is to get the music heard, right?).</p><p>&gt;Consider yourself a beta tester.

It doesn&apos;t behoove anyone if the service doesn&apos;t serve their &apos;product&apos;, but I certainly understand the need to get a roster of music. It&apos;s a shame this idea couldn&apos;t just be rolled on top of the technology of zebox or that click-thingy that people have recently moved to (Joe P., others) - those seem to work fine.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.
