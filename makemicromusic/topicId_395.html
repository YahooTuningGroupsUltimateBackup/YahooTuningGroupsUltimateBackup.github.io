She&apos;s one of the great Khyal singers of our time; well, in the<br/>slightly older generation.  I have several of her albums, including probably<br/>the one you refer to: the Maestro&apos;s choice gold recording?</p><p>[Aside: of the Kishori Amonkar albums I&apos;ve heard, I recommend them all but<br/>one.  The one I _don&apos;t_ recommend is the double album of her singing Raga<br/>Lalit with Chaurasia on flute (Navras #NRCD0047/48).  If I were her, I never<br/>would have allowed that album to be released.  She obviously was suffering<br/>from bronchial problems, and she coughs a lot throughout the performance.  If<br/>you can ignore her suffering, the singing in between bouts of coughing is<br/>divine, and it may be the only recording you&apos;ll ever find of Raga Lalit...<br/>too bad.]</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Jim Cole &#x3C;jimcole@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2001 1:04:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;David Beardsley&quot; &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; She has an amazing voice.</p><p>I&apos;ll Third that - her singing is pure joy!!!  Thanks Jacky and David<br/>for these posts - a reminder to me of wonderful music.  I have<br/>a &quot;bootleg&quot; tape of her that a friend made many years ago and I&apos;ve<br/>nearly worn it out with all the play but have no idea which<br/>album/pieces are there.  I&apos;m going right home after work to dig this<br/>out and soar off with her transcendent voice this very eve! :)</p><p>~jim</p><p>&gt; * David Beardsley<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>&gt; * <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a><br/>&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt;   From: jacky_ligon@y...<br/>&gt;   To: MakeMicroMusic@y...<br/>&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 8:47 AM<br/>&gt;   Subject: [MMM] Kishori Amonkar - Raga Ahir Bhairav<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Anyone here ever listen to Kishori Amonkar?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Listening to her perform Raga Ahir Bhairav this morning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Ah - perfect bliss in sound beyond compare!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Jacky</p></div>
