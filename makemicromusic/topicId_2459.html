Now with this musical scenario, was the difficulty from<br/>&gt; the irregular pulses, or was it the cycle in itself?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the latter, do you find that the more remote a rhythmic cycle is<br/>&gt; from a 2 based cycle, it becomes more difficult to play?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like - would you say that 13 is more difficult than 17?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just curious,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky</p><p>Feral one,</p><p>For me, any meter is easy, as long as whatever the part is makes sense<br/>melodically. By that I mean, If there is a loop or repeating figure, I just<br/>keep that in my mind, or sing along with the part (inaudible) as I play. No<br/>matter what the meter/s, I&apos;m on track because I&apos;m listening to the structure<br/>melodically, not just counting combo&apos;s of 2 and 3, which is a kind of<br/>crutch, and leads many composers to (imho) stilted odd time music. Zappa is<br/>a good for instance. Whether its 19/16 or 7/8, Zappa always had his odd time<br/>broken down into those 2 and 3 combos. It all starts to sound the same to me<br/>after awhile. Dave Holland does this alot, although I forgive him because he<br/>is such a beautiful person, and not a shabby composer.</p><p>Get out yer manuscript paper, and dig this.</p><p>1   an   2   an   3      4  e  an  ah    5     6     7<br/>                       Q.
