Well,<br/>this &quot;Teaching Little JI Robot Fingers to Play&quot;.</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html">http://www.akjmusic.com/works.html</a></p><p>I guess I just came up with this for several reasons. One, I just had<br/>my little student give a recital on the 10th, so pedagogical sounding<br/>music has been on my mind and in my brain.</p><p>Secondly, I spied some pedagogical music on my friend Steve&apos;s piano<br/>last night, and realized that an awful lot of great music that we take<br/>for granted has come from the search to write something both musically<br/>meaningful, as well as technically easy or accesible for kids. Think<br/>of Bart&ograve;k&apos;s &apos;Mikrokosmos&apos;, Schumann&apos;s &apos;Album for the Young&apos;, works by<br/>Prokofieff and Shostokovich, Mozart&apos;s elegant little minuets and of<br/>course, the Bach of the &apos;Anna Magdelena Notebook&apos;. Fellow lister Chris<br/>Bailey also wrote a nice inspiring set for kids, too. I figured the<br/>universe was trying to tell me something, and I ought to try my hand<br/>at this game.</p><p>This is my first humble venture, sent out to my daughter Annika with<br/>love; maybe it will become a set of pieces, but for now, a single<br/>movement.</p><p>Alas, no human could play this on anything but a specially tailored<br/>microtonal keyboard with lots &apos;o keys, hence the virtual aspect, and<br/>the &apos;robot&apos; title.</p><p>I used my own &apos;micro_composer&apos; software, then Timidity++ drove<br/>&quot;Campbell&apos;s Tuned Harpsichord&quot; soundfont, no doubt a very nice<br/>soundfont indeed. Then I opened Ardour (Linux only) and applied a bit<br/>of Freeverb3 to get a feel of a robot student recital hall.</p><p>Enjoy!<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=16112 href="#16112">ðŸ”—</a>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2007 11:41:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron, I geta 403 Forbidden when I try to click on the ogg.

I love this<br/>capability of electronic music and electonic recording techniques: to<br/>be able to make counterpoint really also behave spatially, for clarity<br/>and definition.

Would you<br/>want to hear Gregorian Chant in a tiny, dry room? Would it have the<br/>same effect on you?

There&apos;s nothing that says price guarntees<br/>quality, and that principle extends to software.</p><p>I would like to challenge your assumption, which I think is pure<br/>prejudice on your part---take any reverb program you want on your<br/>platform, I&apos;ll take mine, and let&apos;s &apos;produce&apos; the same dry track, you<br/>with your tools, me with mine, and compare. We can send them to a<br/>neutral third party, who can relabel them and present them randomly or<br/>whatever, and let the rest of the group decide what they hear and<br/>like/dislike. I can guarantee that the results would be simply the<br/>skill of the engineer, not the supposed quality of the tools.</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3><a id=16150 href="#16150">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2007 9:21:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot;<br/>&lt;prentrodgers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt; Another wonderful piece.

I downloaded a *different* &apos;freeverb3&apos;<br/>package today (the one that&apos;s *not* in the LADSPA <a href="http://cmt.so">cmt.so</a> library,<br/>whichisthe one I had been using) that included convolution reverb<br/>plugins for the &apos;audacious&apos; application (it&apos;s like winamp). I then<br/>downloaded a rather nice impulse file called &apos;Church Schellingwolde&apos;.<br/>I like it very much---good for chamber music type scenarios. I&apos;d love<br/>to hear your (I mean anyone&apos;s) opinion of it if you test it yourself....</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~fokkie/Files/Church%20Schellingwoude.zip">http://www.xs4all.nl/~fokkie/Files/Church%20Schellingwoude.zip</a></p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot;<br/>&lt;prentrodgers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I liked the dry version more, but that&apos;s just me. For fun, I ran it<br/>&gt; through my personal favorite open source sound tool, Csound. They have<br/>&gt; an opcode called CONVOLVE, which, as you would expect, convolves the<br/>&gt; source file with an impulse response file. The impulse response file I<br/>&gt; use is from Teatro Alcorcon in Madrid, recorded by Angelo Farina. I had<br/>&gt; to set it to 50% more than my normal level to be audible.

I really liked the slow revelation of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; theme and the gentle introduction of &quot;challenging&quot; intonation. Great<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff. I liked the reverb, but I&apos;d also like to hear a dry version.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks, Prent.
