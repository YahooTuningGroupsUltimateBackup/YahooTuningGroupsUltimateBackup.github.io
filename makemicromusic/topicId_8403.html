The state of the art has progressed quite a<br/>way in the last few years. Circa 1991, I was fortunate enough to try out<br/>Perry Cook&apos;s &quot;Shiela&quot; on the NeXT box:<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~prc/SingingSynth.html">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~prc/SingingSynth.html</a><br/>Sounded cool, but it had no musical interface at all.</p><p>While Cantor and some other products are very pricy, Myriad has Harmony<br/>Assistant with &quot;Virtual Singer&quot; -- a fairly decent sounding product for<br/>$90. It&apos;s hard to beat:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.myriad-online.com/en/products/index.htm">http://www.myriad-online.com/en/products/index.htm</a></p><p>BTW, I downloaded and tried Harmony Assistant with Virtual Singer, and<br/>read a few things about the tuning capability. Looks pretty interesting. It<br/>has a limitation of + or - 2 semitones in the tuning of each note, but it<br/>does understand enharmonics, so it looks like you could tune, for example,<br/>17-tET and use A# and B-flat as different pitches. Has its own internal<br/>tuning system. They have a meantone example.</p><p>Another cool thing about Harmony Assistant... I have Finale 2005, which<br/>can export a &quot;Music XML&quot; rendition of scores. I saved an XML of a song with<br/>ensemble accompaniment from Finale, then loaded the XML into Harmony<br/>Assistant, and the transition was &quot;almost perfect&quot;. Then I listened to<br/>*words and music* in H.A. The next experiment would be trying to use an<br/>alternative tuning, like meantone or harmonic scale. (If anyone&apos;s done it,<br/>please let me know what you think!)</p><p>On the Myriad forum for Virtual Singer, I did start some Q/A on<br/>microtuning (loading Scala or TUN files) and VST possibilities. People<br/>might be interested in chiming in, if they think the product has<br/>possibilities. Here:</p><p><a href="http://www.myriad-online.com/cgi-bin/bbs/YaBB.pl?board=Scores;action=display;num=1104875104">http://www.myriad-online.com/cgi-bin/bbs/YaBB.pl?board=Scores;action=display;num=1104875104</a></p><p>They&apos;re open to community &quot;voting&quot; on features to add, and they seem to<br/>listen. There is some interest in turning Virtual Singer into a VSTi (which<br/>would be awesome), and also importing Scala files.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
