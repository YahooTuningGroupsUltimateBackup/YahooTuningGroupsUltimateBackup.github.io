Here is the original..<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/phat.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/phat.mp3</a></p><p>I need to fatten up the bass a little bit with filterhands. FH has the bass in mono while the original has it fairly wide...</p><p>I am doing much more for a final take including having the filter cutoff sequenced...microtonal scales anyone?... mmm... certainly possible...</p><p>Oh yeah... I do have pictures and also created a video from footage at my final electronic dance music event (early May)... The video came out well for my first attempt at doing one.. It is up here: <a href="http://www.egregious.net/taz2002/">http://www.egregious.net/taz2002/</a></p><p>Windows users will probably need to download the latest DivX codec (<a href="http://www.divx.com">www.divx.com</a>). I am uploading a couple QT files for the Mac people.. I will post links to the TAZ page in about 3 hours...</p><p>Oh yeah... I am borrowing an extra pair of speakers and I am playing around with quad... Insane... I like it... Gonna make something EAish with them this weekend...</p><p>Oh yeah(X2)... I seriously recommend Cubase SX to everyone on this email list... It is only $600 (maybe lower if you shop around).. It combines the current Nuendo engine with all of the features in Cubase... Really.. Do check it out if PC-DAWing is your thing... Steinberg must be doing something big for Nuendo 2.0!!</p><p>--Best...<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I even had a Panasonic Quadrophonic turntable, and still have about a dozen quad lps. Lest anyone laugh, those four channels of amp sure came in handy for years with a Teac 3340 4 channel reel-2-reel deck...</p><p>Mike, your enthusiasm is infectious...</p><p>&gt;Oh yeah(X2)...
