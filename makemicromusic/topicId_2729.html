It is here <a href="http://math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/listenra.html">http://math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/listenra.html</a><br/>but it is in Real Audio, so it is difficult to hear the harmonics very<br/>well. Unfortunately, the bass harmonics do not fare much better under<br/>mp3 encoding. I am posting the mp3 version to my Listen to Microtonal<br/>mp3 section today.</p><p>The piece is played on a 6 string fretless with the strings tuned in<br/>just 4/3s to each other. The harmonic scales are composed of the HS on<br/>each string up to the 7th harmonic, offset by 4/3 from string to<br/>string. I have no idea if this tuning has a name. Jaco was the first I<br/>heard using harmonic scales this way, but I don&apos;t know how he tuned<br/>his strings.</p><p>John Starrett</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2002 7:16:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2732">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/2732</a></p><p>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi John<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They just wrote back and are going to use my Dance of the<br/>&gt; Mermaids.
