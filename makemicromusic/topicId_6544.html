I&apos;ve checked against my own ear and I&apos;ve<br/>definitely used a 19-tone scale that is only marginally off EDO<br/>(limitations with Roland SC88 do not permit me from using the other<br/>pitch bend number ). I don&apos;t know where people get 4096 pitch bends per<br/>semitone:  sibelius is quite clear on this, the range is 0 to 127, with<br/>64 being the centre: no pitch bend. I do set the total range to *1<br/>semitone*, which by a simple test proved that when the range is set to 1<br/>controller 100,0, 101,0 6,1 in decimal, then 127 represents a bend up<br/>of one semitone and 0 represents a bend down of 1 semitone. I set my<br/>&apos;zero&apos; on A, as that is the tuned pitch on the real recorders that<br/>could play these pieces. If anyone is interested I can post an &apos;ear<br/>test&apos; Sibelius file which I put together when composing these works.<br/>There are slight deviations caused by the facts that:</p><p>1 if a bend of 0 bends pitch down 1 semitone, then the semitone is<br/>divided into 64 parts.<br/>2. if a bend of 127 bends a pitch up by one semitone, then the range 65<br/>to 127 must divide a semitone into 63.5 parts: my spreadsheet<br/>computations insist on this.  - I even typed out a big table of all 128<br/>bends and computed the cent values given 0 cents as a bend of 64 as<br/>above.<br/>3. The granularity of these bends is of the order of 1.5 cents, so the<br/>maximum deviation is half this:</p><p>bend:<br/>k  &lt;---------------1.5625&cent;------------------&gt; k+1<br/>|----------------------------------------------|<br/>                       ^ max deviation = 0.78&cent; - movement either way<br/>will make the representation more accurate, not less.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=6559 href="#6559">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2004 12:49:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve looked at how sibelius does pitch bends again, and I cannot find<br/>&gt; an error in what I&apos;ve done.

In any case, I rendered the midi files using Audio<br/>Compositor set to a bend sensitivity of 8192 pitch bends to a<br/>semitone, converted to ogg, and uploaded it. The ogg files and<br/>discussion of your scale on the web page should now be correct; it<br/>might be a good idea for you to take a listen and see what you think.</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/coll.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/coll.htm</a></p><p>I have to say this has all been highly educational.</p></div><h3><a id=6567 href="#6567">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2004 8:37:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve looked at how sibelius does pitch bends again, and I cannot<br/>find<br/>&gt; an error in what I&apos;ve done.

The &quot;coarse&quot; number is the *second*<br/>number after the comma.  So in other words, ~B127,127 is the largest<br/>bend you can have.  Since there are, essentially then, 128 bends for<br/>both coarse and fine (including 0) you get 128 x 128 or 16384.</p><p>Now since the bend range is over *two whole tones* or 4 semi-tones,<br/>you have to divide by 4...</p><p>16384/4 = 4096.</p><p>best,</p><p>J.
