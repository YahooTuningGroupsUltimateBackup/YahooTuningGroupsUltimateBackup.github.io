Arpeggiator will also skip<br/>the number of tones to follow the scales correctly.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=4574 href="#4574">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2003 2:43:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ambranadi wrote...</p><p>&gt; Bought Big Tick&apos;s Rhino recently, and it&apos;s an unbelievably powerful<br/>&gt; piece of kit - totally blows away any hardware FM synth out there...</p><p>Yeah, I agree.

Truth is, these<br/>VSTi microtonal synths put so much hardware to shame - especially the<br/>totally lame General Midi.  It&apos;s difficult to believe that with these<br/>new tools available, there are still microtuning beginners out there<br/>trying to struggle with GM and its unfortunate and limited palette of<br/>lumpy and looped waveforms.  Microtonality, and the desired effects of<br/>microtuned music, suffer dramatically from any presentation through<br/>the lackluster GM sound-set, but of course any musician trying to do<br/>serious professional work, or present tuning examples of any sonic<br/>worth would have to at least be aware of how dated this has become of<br/>late.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>A</p><p>This sounds interesting.</p><p>I haven&apos;t been following developments recently in new products but as I&apos;m<br/>about to upgrade my system I&apos;d like some advice.</p><p>In addition to a Doepfer A-100 analogue system with limited microtuning<br/>capabilities owing to the MAQ 16/3 hardware sequencer being tied to 12<br/>equal, I have a midi system, with an ASR 10 and TX 802, running Cubase and<br/>Jeff Scott&apos;s tuningsoftware on a Mac.
