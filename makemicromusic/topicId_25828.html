Early in this<br/>period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio<br/>Salieri, primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this<br/>relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly 1809. With<br/>Haydn&apos;s departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by<br/>the Elector to return home. He chose instead to remain in Vienna,<br/>continuing his counterpoint instruction with Johann Albrechtsberger<br/>and other teachers. By 1793, Beethoven established a reputation as<br/>an improviser in the salons of the nobility, often playing the<br/>preludes and fugues of J. S.

Deep within. Haydn and Clementi, I feel, lean more to voice-leading-within-chords than the other-way- around of strong counterpoint, which is the feeling of chords more arising from the counterpoint. And really the first piece of evidence for this is the &quot;cell&quot; kind of motif in Beethoven which I think we could humorously, but with a kind of accuracy, call a &quot;riff&quot; in the heavy metal manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I read somewhere about Haydn discussing how he pulls things out of<br/>&gt; &gt;a little motive and develops it;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beethoven is well known for this.

That&apos;s ultimately imitative counterpoint, fundamentally different from the homophonic impulse to run a melody over a chord progression, and then decorating it with little bits of counterpoint.
