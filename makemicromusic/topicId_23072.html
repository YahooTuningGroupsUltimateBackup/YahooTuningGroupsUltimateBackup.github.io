I&apos;m a huge fan<br/>of<br/>various JIs (as you know) but I&apos;m of a mind to try something new to me.</p><p>The only other minimal-number ET (I really don&apos;t have the technical<br/>knowledge<br/>to describe them properly) I&apos;ve worked with is 11et as in the &quot;Xenophon&quot;<br/>pieces;<br/>so I&apos;ll be starting from scratch with 7, 8, 9 &amp; 10et, trying out melodic<br/>themes<br/>&amp; chord progressions. I&apos;ll use Orion Pro at first, as electronic timbres<br/>seem to<br/>soften up a harsher chord combination somewhat...</p><p>Keep you notified,<br/>jls</p></div>
