I&apos;ve been so pleased with the songs that have come out of these &quot;worst&quot; scales that it&apos;s becoming a for-real album, so I&apos;m not going to demo any more single tracks here on MMM.</p><p>Currently, I have four tracks finished, 3 of which most of you have heard: 3 in scales by Michael, 1 in a scale by John.  I have one in progress in 14-EDO (which is sounding AWESOME right now, this tuning is really not putting up much of a fight at all), and then I have to write one in 11-EDO (since Carl alluded to it somewhere--I don&apos;t know how to write SATB properly, but I&apos;ll aim for four-part harmony if I can pull it off) and one in my own &quot;worst&quot; scale of the 24-EDO improper octatonic/diminished scale.  That makes a total of 7 songs.</p><p>I want to do more, to make a full-length album, so that means more scales.  Gene, John, and Michael--I promise I will get to some 11-limit Hobbits, Blue Temperament, and Dimension EC after this, and that I will try to make them sound as good as I can (rather than bad), but I&apos;m really in the groove with these bad scales right now and I want to keep going.  Rather than &quot;fighting&quot; me, I feel like these scales all lead me off in a very alien direction, pursuing compelling musical realities which feel natural despite being as &quot;at odds as possible&quot; with human ideas about harmony.  It&apos;s also not something that is typically done by people in the microtonal world--plenty of people are exploring the &quot;good&quot; scales, so I feel like SOMEBODY should explore the &quot;bad&quot; ones.</p><p>If I have to, I&apos;ll come up with bad scales on my own; I&apos;ve got a few ideas of how to do it, including high-error regular temperaments, high-prime subgroup tonality diamonds/CPS&apos;s/temperaments (maybe 2.17.23?), a high-prime-harmonics-only rational intonation scale (plus the 2nd harmonic because I&apos;m still stuck with Logic, so maybe 37:41:43:47:53:59:61:67:71:74?) and just searching through my database of MOS scales in various EDOs for particularly nasty-looking ones (though it seems to be difficult to get anything consistently worse than 11-EDO).  I&apos;m tempted to do 10-EDO just because Bill Sethares mentioned it as being particularly difficult to use without adaptive timbres, even though I know from experience it sounds pretty good, what with its excellent approximation to the 13th harmonic, above-average approximation to the 7th harmonic, and passable approximations to the 3rd and 15th harmonics.  I&apos;m tempted to throw in 13-EDO as well, just because it has such a bad rap and there is such a dearth of decent-sounding music written for it, but I don&apos;t expect it to challenge me.  Do any of these seem like a worthwhile challenge to take on?</p><p>Really, though, what I want are scales that make experienced tuning theorists shudder, or scales that result from turning optimization procedures on their heads.  Scales that make you think &quot;now this...this is truly terrible, and only a maniac would consider using it.&quot;  At this point, it&apos;s not even about trying to prove anything, I know I&apos;m not going to change any minds and that&apos;s just fine.  It is like I said above: these bad scales inspire me, because they lead me in directions I would never think to go.  You may think I&apos;m nuts, that my behavior is morally degenerate, and that my madness should not be encouraged, but please: if you can think of a scale that you find utterly repugnant and useless, I&apos;d love to know what it is.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24654 href="#24654">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2011 12:44:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;I have one in progress in 14-EDO (which is sounding AWESOME right now, this<br/>tuning is really not putting up much of a fight at all&quot;</p><p>    Awesome.....can&apos;t wait to hear it.

So for any three consecutive notes, the distance between the first note and the third has to be 100 cents or greater.   I can tell you though--if I could tune that scale, I&apos;d use it to make some meditative drone music, using the strong beating as a trance inducer.  This is one area that cluster scales like this one really excel, much more so than any scale optimized for consonant harmony.  It&apos;s the whole &quot;binaural beating/&quot;digital drugs&quot; thing.  When I get around to purchasing LMSO, I&apos;ll try to tune up some cluster scales and explore the possibilities there.</p><p>In the meantime, let me say that I *almost* picked the 28-EDO &quot;extra-proper&quot; diminished scale over the 24-EDO improper one.  I may still; I haven&apos;t tuned up either of them, but they both *look* horrendous.  28-EDO is definitely capable of some nasty sounds.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24656 href="#24656">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2011 10:10:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, folks.

Thus, most of the intervals that will turn up in it are virtually identical to octave-transpositions of those in 20-ED2, a tuning I know and love.  I even have a refretted guitar in it!  I will be happy to compose in it if you really think it will be difficult, especially because it will allow me to use a guitar, but I don&apos;t anticipate much of a challenge.  I leave it to you to decide if this is the tuning you want me try.</p><p>Hey, since it&apos;s your album, it&apos;s your call, so go ahead and use every 3rd tone of 20-EDO.  It will certainly present more possibilities.</p><p>For one thing, since 20-EDO has 3 separate stretched heptatonic scales, you would have the ability to make a sort of &quot;modulation&quot; to another key by changing to another 20-EDO subset.  You could also treat any tone outside your current heptatonic subset as a kind of chromatic alteration or as a pivot tone leading into a different key.  However, a modulation of this sort could be a bit tricky, something like changing from one whole-tone scale to the other in 12-ET.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=24663 href="#24663">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2011 2:54:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; As possibly the first person ever to produce a composition in 11-EDO (on a retuned<br/>&gt; &gt; electronic organ back in 1970, and yet another on a Scalatron in 1975 -- I still have<br/>&gt; &gt; recordings of both<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, and I would LOVE to hear these if you have them in a digital format.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs</p><p>The originals are on open reel tape.

Your choice of 257-EDO as &quot;bad&quot; has nothing to do with either its harmonic or melodic qualities and everything to do with its size and impracticality, which is tangential to the original point that I was once attempting to make--that scales designed to minimize (rather than maximize) consonance will not be musically useless, because it is next to impossible to escape consonance all together (and that a little bit of consonance is all you need to make music).  My actual making of music in these scales is also a bit tangential, since it&apos;s enough to analyze the various possible intervals in the various &quot;anti-optimal&quot; scales I&apos;ve been given to see that approximately-consonant intervals do arise in various places.</p><p>The real point, of course, is that the relevance of consonance depends entirely on the goals of the musician making the music (and the listener hearing it).  As I particularly seem to enjoy working with scales designed to be dissonant, I have solicited the community here to provide me with more scales.  Perhaps I erred in adopting the somewhat-ambiguous terms &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; as short-hand for &quot;permitting a minimum of consonant harmony&quot;.

Obviously if you have more intervals available, you&apos;ll have more versatility.  But any D.E. scale of 7 notes is going to be as versatile as any other D.E. scale of 7 notes, although they might be very different in character.  The diatonic scale is consonant as hell in meantone, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s more versatile than the 7-note MOS of Mohajira, or Amity, or Mavila.</p><p>&gt; Guess what...I&apos;m not convinced distributionally-uneven means<br/>&gt; &quot;bad&quot;.</p><p>And who suggested that it does?  I suggested that it means &quot;limited&quot;.

George Secor has a particular gift with these sorts of scales.  Also, not all D.E. scales are MOS or EDO-compatible.  But they all have the property of maximizing uniformity, and in a uniform scale, the composer is free to play any interval from any note.</p><p>&gt; And, for<br/>&gt; the record, I believe over half the chords in 12TET are<br/>&gt; dissonant...hence the need for chord theory and the<br/>&gt; fact so much highly dissonant music can be make of the &quot;strong&quot;<br/>&gt; dyads in 12TET.</p><p>Really? How are you counting?  If we&apos;re looking at triads within one octave given a constant root note, I sincerely doubt this.</p><p>&gt;   What I don&apos;t believe in is that scales where a very<br/>&gt; disproportionate majority of chords are dissonant give a &quot;wider<br/>&gt; mood range&quot;.</p><p>And I still think this is because you are failing to acknowledge the different moods that dissonant intervals are capable of producing.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s the thing...I don&apos;t view 12TET as &quot;highly consonant&quot;, but<br/>&gt; rather relatively &quot;equally split consonant/dissonant&quot;.</p><p>Man, I do not get your thinking.  Dyadically, there are two--maybe 3--intervals in 12-tET that are dissonant: the min2, the b5/#4, and maaaaaybe the maj7.  You cannot find a 12-note scale with fewer dissonances.  Maybe you can find one where the dissonances are less dissonant--some well-temperaments pull this off quite artfully--but the number of dissonances will not change.  If you make the scale less even so that there are fewer dissonances on one root, guess what--there will be more on another root!  You can move them around as much as you want, but you can&apos;t decrease their number.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24692 href="#24692">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 8:15:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;Yeah, some chords are gonna get left out, no matter what the scale.&quot;<br/>   The question then seems to become...how do (or can?) we get and idea how far<br/>a scale can go?

You cannot find a 12-note scale with fewer  dissonances.  &quot;<br/>   My point is that EVEN with nearly all perfect dyads, you still will most<br/>likely get 50%+ dissonant combinations in any decently sized (think 10+ tone)<br/>tuning.  And thus the challenge becomes to get (not &quot;avoid passing&quot;) that 50%<br/>for even consonance/dissonance distribution.<br/>  What I&apos;m saying is that<br/>A) A majority of scales are disproportionately (well over 50%) dissonant so far<br/>as tonal combinations<br/>B1) Thus, to achieve the goal of 50/50 dissonance/consonance...one must usually<br/>increase consonance, not dissonance...<br/>B2) &quot;over consonance&quot; is just as generally harmful for easy composition...try to<br/>get moods out of a pentatonic scale with a large majority of consonance over<br/>dissonance...ouch!  But running into the issue of &quot;over consonance&quot; is VERY<br/>unlikely...</p><p>   To be fair...I do believe I have a &quot;pet bias&quot; for scales with more or less<br/>equal balance between consonant and dissonant chord options.

But there are many more triads that don&apos;t.  I&apos;ll make a list of triads in 12-tET and post it.  And anyway, how is it any different in your Dimension tuning?  Or any 12-note tuning?</p><p>&gt;    My point is that EVEN with nearly all perfect dyads, you still will most<br/>&gt; likely get 50%+ dissonant combinations in any decently sized (think 10+ tone)<br/>&gt; tuning.

But running into the issue of &quot;over consonance&quot; is VERY<br/>&gt; unlikely...</p><p>Compare the mood of the 31-EDO diatonic to the 27-EDO diatonic.  In the 31-EDO diatonic, there is essentially ONE dissonance, the 16/15 semitone; the #4 is a 7/5 (so it is now consonant), the b5 is a 10/7 (so it is now consonant), and the maj7 is nearly a perfect 15/8 (and so consonant).  In the 27-EDO, the maj3 is about 444 cents, so dissonant; the maj7 is about 1166 cents, so very dissonant; the 4th and 5th are both about 10 cents off, vs. only about 5 cents in 31, so more dissonant, and the semitones at 44 cents are drastically more dissonant than the 16/15&apos;s in 31.  Tell me: does the increased dissonance in 27 limit the mood-range it is capable of?</p><p>&gt;    To be fair...I do believe I have a &quot;pet bias&quot; for scales with more or less<br/>&gt; equal balance between consonant and dissonant chord options.

If you stay on the white keys of the piano (or the black keys), you&apos;re fine; if you play guitar, learning a couple chord shapes is all you need--and with the mostly-4ths open-string tuning, it&apos;s more difficult to play semitonal clusters than it is to play something consonant; as a guitarist, I feel like I have to bend over BACKWARDS to get any real dissonance in 12-tET!  Most polyphonic 12-tET instruments are designed to make playing consonant chords as easy as possible.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24695 href="#24695">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 10:27:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igs&gt;&quot;Yeah, some chords are gonna get left out, no matter what the scale.&quot;<br/>&gt;    The question then seems to become...how do (or can?) we get and idea how far<br/>&gt; a scale can go?

You cannot find a 12-note scale with fewer  dissonances.  &quot;<br/>&gt;    My point is that EVEN with nearly all perfect dyads, you still will most<br/>&gt; likely get 50%+ dissonant combinations in any decently sized (think 10+ tone)<br/>&gt; tuning.  And thus the challenge becomes to get (not &quot;avoid passing&quot;) that 50%<br/>&gt; for even consonance/dissonance distribution.<br/>&gt;   What I&apos;m saying is that<br/>&gt; A) A majority of scales are disproportionately (well over 50%) dissonant so far<br/>&gt; as tonal combinations<br/>&gt; B1) Thus, to achieve the goal of 50/50 dissonance/consonance...one must usually<br/>&gt; increase consonance, not dissonance...<br/>&gt; B2) &quot;over consonance&quot; is just as generally harmful for easy composition...try to<br/>&gt; get moods out of a pentatonic scale with a large majority of consonance over<br/>&gt; dissonance...ouch!  But running into the issue of &quot;over consonance&quot; is VERY<br/>&gt; unlikely...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    To be fair...I do believe I have a &quot;pet bias&quot; for scales with more or less<br/>&gt; equal balance between consonant and dissonant chord options.  And I think 12TET<br/>&gt; is &quot;pretty good&quot; for that sort of thing and much of the success of 12TET comes<br/>&gt; from the balance between consonance and dissonance, not any so-called &quot;abundance<br/>&gt; of consonance&quot;.   Again I swear, if 12TET had so few ways to &quot;go<br/>&gt; sour&quot;...musicians very likely wouldn&apos;t be so stressed about chord theory (and<br/>&gt; they are stressed...because there are so many overtly &apos;sour&apos; options, even in<br/>&gt; 12TET)... :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=24700 href="#24700">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 12:27:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;11-EDO is worse.  There is no place to hide in 11-EDO.  Even in your 2nd<br/>&gt;&quot;worst&quot; scale, some approximate fifths and major 3rds popped up in a  few<br/>&gt;places; in 11-EDO that cannot happen.&quot;</p><p>    Funny because in 11TET, the 7th, minor 3rd, and diminished 5th actually<br/>aren&apos;t too bad.  So you can get some fairly solid minor 7th tetrads from any<br/>root note.  Not to mention that the 5/3, even though about 13 cents off...is<br/>&quot;cancelled-out&quot; by the other strong dyads making a decent minor 6th  tetrad.</p><p>      As we both know, no scale is going to be able to have absolutely no good<br/>combinations and maybe you still think, even with the said-above strong chords,<br/>that 11TET is worse than my bad scale...I still have my doubts.  The only hard<br/>part about 11TET...is you can&apos;t get the usual 4:5:6 major chord anywhere<br/>whatsoever...but it look like, if you accept the minor as a resting point, it<br/>should still be relatively &quot;ok&quot; far as bad scales go. :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;I could do 13-EDO instead, if you think that would be a better  indicator,<br/>&gt;though I think 13-EDO is quite a bit more consonant than 11.&quot;</p><p>     Either one would be fine...both have about the same number of notes as 12<br/>but, IMVHO, much less possibilities so far as tonal color.  12TET seems to be<br/>able to go from very dark to very light and many shades of light and dark in<br/>between....11 and 13 seem to have almost completely dark and relatively few, if<br/>rather unique, shades of dark.</p><p>&gt;&quot;That (composing a song with a noise wave) is more a timbre issue than a tuning<br/>&gt;issue, or maybe a compositional  one...serialist/atonal techniques are pretty<br/>&gt;much just as effective in  creating chaos regardless of how consonant the tuning<br/>&gt;is.&quot;</p><p>     Put it this way...I agree that just about any tuning can be made to sound<br/>like chaos...but it becomes problematic when it&apos;s very hard to bring up any<br/>emotion in a tuning beside choas...IE at the very least a tuning should be able<br/>to manage &quot;distinct shades of chaos&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Oh, there&apos;s a bit more than 8 cents variety in some of the tunings I&apos;m<br/>&gt;thinking of.  I forget where I found it, but I tried one  well-temperament once<br/>&gt;that was designed to give major 3rds of 5/4, 9/7,  and 14/11 in various keys,<br/>&gt;and minor 4rds of 6/5, 7/6, and 13/11, while  still keeping the chain of fifths<br/>&gt;close enough to pure.  It was pretty  sweet.&quot;</p><p>  I stand corrected...the &quot;gap&quot; between 13/11 and 6/5 (though not so much<br/>between 7/6 and 6/5) I admit would likely have a significant impact as being<br/>&quot;non DE&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But there are many more triads that don&apos;t.  I&apos;ll make a list of triads  in<br/>&gt;12-tET and post it.  And anyway, how is it any different in your  Dimension<br/>&gt;tuning?  Or any 12-note tuning?&quot;</p><p>  Well you hit the spot right...tonal clusters show off a lot of the bad triads<br/>in 12TET (a bit more than half of them, in fact).  That and even the diminished<br/>triad in 12TET hits a fair (though not startling) degree of dissonance.</p><p>So within a 5th interval the following chords from the same root, IMVHO, sound<br/>dissonant in 12TET:<br/>C C# D#,<br/>C C# E,<br/>C D# E.<br/>C D# F# (diminished...relatively non-clustered)<br/>C  E   F#, (&quot;reverse diminished&quot;...not sure of the formal name...relatively<br/>non-clustered)<br/>C  F   F#<br/>C  F# G</p><p>...now how many consonant one can you find using notes between C and G?<br/>Also, to note, Dimension is significantly different than 12TET in a few aspects,<br/>including that<br/>A) It includes a purer version of the diatonic scale IE almost exactly the same<br/>as that in 31TET<br/>B) It &quot;pads&quot; a good few of the 18/17-ish semi-tones responsible for so many of<br/>the bad triads with 12/11 or 11/10 semi-tones.<br/>....so it tries to make the most consonant versions of said above chords and<br/>pushes some of them toward sounding &quot;occasionally usable as resolve<br/>points...though still tense enough to also be used as tension points&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think you should attempt to verify this before making such sweeping  claims.<br/>&gt;As far as I know, you haven&apos;t been including triadic analyses  when working out<br/>&gt;your scales.&quot;<br/>   I have not...but considering the most sour dyads are abundant in the most<br/>sour triads (IE even the 12TET tritone at C F#, which is not clustered like C<br/>C#)  and far more rarely take place in other chords...I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a leap<br/>at all to say correcting them should help other chords.  BTW, I have tested<br/>triads (specifically some of the most odd/bad versions of ones in my Dimension<br/>scale) about a month ago...it&apos;s the &quot;Dimension Scale Triads&quot; file in my folder.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Compare the mood of the 31-EDO diatonic to the 27-EDO diatonic.  In the  31-EDO<br/>&gt;diatonic, there is essentially ONE dissonance, the 16/15  semitone; the #4 is a<br/>&gt;7/5 (so it is now consonant), the b5 is a 10/7 (so  it is now consonant), and<br/>&gt;the maj7 is nearly a perfect 15/8 (and so  consonant).  In the 27-EDO, the maj3<br/>&gt;is about 444 cents, so dissonant;  the maj7 is about 1166 cents, so very<br/>&gt;dissonant; the 4th and 5th are  both about 10 cents off, vs. only about 5 cents<br/>&gt;in 31, so more  dissonant, and the semitones at 44 cents are drastically more<br/>&gt;dissonant  than the 16/15&apos;s in 31.  Tell me: does the increased dissonance in 27<br/>&gt;limit the mood-range it is capable of?&quot;</p><p>   I would say yes....though do to the sheer number of notes in both scales (and<br/>none of the notes being anywhere near close enough to the others to be heard as<br/>unisons) that 27TET will have a decent mood range...just not nearly so good as<br/>31TET.  31TET does one thing incredibly admirable to me vs. 12TET...it kills the<br/>12TET tritone and replaces it with a much more balanced 10/7...at least with a<br/>diatonic scale in 31TET, you can make a fairly safe bet that the only way to get<br/>dissonance is to cluster.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Who are these musicians that are so stressed out by 12-tET?  If you stay  on<br/>&gt;the white keys of the piano (or the black keys), you&apos;re fine;&quot;</p><p>    You still get the tri-tone, you still get two 16/15&apos;s, actually, I&apos;m pretty<br/>sure you still get at least one transposed version of all the bad triads I<br/>mentioned above!<br/>    Now with a pentatonic scale IE C D E G A...you&apos;d be &quot;fine&quot;...no tritone no<br/>clusters no nothing...but (as said before) that falls under my radar as &quot;too<br/>much consonance&quot; and, as such, it&apos;s hard to get dissonant moods and good<br/>tension/release contrast that way (not to mention having only 5 notes for<br/>melodic variety hurts a ton).</p><p>&gt;&quot;as a guitarist, I feel like I have to bend over BACKWARDS to get any real<br/>&gt;dissonance in 12-tET!&quot;</p><p>   I&apos;ll just have to leave that as a matter of personal opinion...  What I&apos;ve<br/>found often happens is it&apos;s quite easy to simply end up playing a chord that&apos;s<br/>out-of-key by mistake on a guitar, and not terribly hard to hit semi-tones by<br/>mistake (and, on the flip side, how many good chords do you really have if you<br/>can&apos;t be taught where the &quot;good vs. bad&quot; uses of semi-tones are?) :-D</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24701 href="#24701">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 1:21:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jan 19, 2011 at 2:55 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you can come up with a 12-tone scale that gets a lower dissonance percentage than 54.5% without exceeding the 5-limit, or lower than 34.5% without exceeding the 7-limit, I&apos;ll be amazed.

And FWIW, the 600-cent tritone is used to approximate 7/5 and 10/7 in a lot of 7-limit temperaments, any that vanish the 50/49 comma, as in 22-EDO&apos;s 4:5:6:7 tetrads, and 18- and 26-EDO&apos;s very passable 5:6:7 triads, even in 16-EDO&apos;s very persuasive 4:5:7 triads.   As a dyad, sure, 600 cents is a pretty weak approximation to the septimal tritones, but in chords it fares much better.  If you don&apos;t believe me, I suggest you ask around on the Tuning List.</p><p>&gt;   Like I said before...I highly regard 31TET in that it effectively kills the<br/>&gt; lousy 12TET tri-tone and provides good approximations of the good 7-limit<br/>&gt; alternatives instead.  I never said &quot;tritones are bad&quot;...just the 12TET one. :-D</p><p>And yet, in Meantone[12], the percentage of dissonant triads goes up from 12-Equal.  Don&apos;t believe it?  Calculate it yourself!</p><p>&gt; Igs&gt;&quot;55 total combinations<br/>&gt; 5 contain two dissonant dyads (tritone and/or minor 2nd)<br/>&gt; 25 contain one dissonant dyad (tritone or minor 2nd)<br/>&gt; 14 contain the minor 2nd only<br/>&gt; 25 contain no dissonant dyads&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looks relatively like my predicted 50/50 to me (plus or minus about 5%<br/>&gt; error).   Triadic entropy, agreed with Mike B, would be another good test to<br/>&gt; run....  BTW, to make things more interesting...remember the 6th in 12TET also<br/>&gt; is pretty far off...and the 3rds and 7th are &quot;just passable&quot; in 12TET...it would<br/>&gt; be interesting the see what the best 12-tone subset in 31TET could do in<br/>&gt; comparison....</p><p>&quot;Just passable&quot;?  Again such harsh critiques from the man who readily accepts such intervals as 11/9, 22/15, and 50/33 as consonances supposedly on par with 3/2 and 5/4.  And either way, it&apos;s only 50/50 if you deny that 12-tET&apos;s approximations to 7-limit triads are consonances...which is hypocritical to do if you allow its approximations to 5-limit consonances to stand as consonances, since the error is not much greater.  They may not be near Just, but they&apos;re close enough to function consonantly in music (in ways that triads in, say, 8- or 11-EDO typically don&apos;t).  As I see it, it&apos;s closer to 30/70 dissonance/consonance (or maybe 40/60 if you&apos;re being strict).  Also, you should know that I calculated the average dyadic harmonic entropy for every EDO from 5 to 37, and the only EDOs lower than 12 were 5 and 7.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;If you can come up with a 12-tone scale that gets a lower dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt;percentage than 54.5% without exceeding the 5-limit, or lower than 34.5%<br/>&gt; &gt;without exceeding the 7-limit, I&apos;ll be amazed.  Remember, though: if  it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;unequal, you&apos;ll have to look at all the different roots, not just  one, since<br/>&gt; &gt;there will be different triads under each root (since we are  not allowing<br/>&gt; &gt;octave equivalence).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I think the latest/2nd version of Dimension EC I posted does the trick far as<br/>&gt; approaching around (rough guess) 40-50% dissonance...although it does use the<br/>&gt; 11th and 15th limit (mainly taking advantage of 11/9, 11/6, and 22/15 as<br/>&gt; &quot;neutral&quot; seconds, fifths, and sevenths of sorts)!</p><p>I&apos;d do a triadic analysis before making any claims if I were you.  Even supposing you are right in your guess, the fact that your Dimension EC scale is judging consonance against the 11-limit and 12-tET is being judged against the 5-limit (to get the 54.5% figure I posted), well...the fact that you only improve on 12-tET by 5% to 15% despite adding two additional primes doesn&apos;t say much.  And I&apos;m still not convinced it&apos;s fair to call 11/9, 11/6, and 22/15 &quot;consonances&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Far as something in by and<br/>&gt; large only the 7th limit that gets close...the 12-tone Minerva scale Gene posted<br/>&gt; is just about the best thing I&apos;ve seen so far for the...  And yes, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; considering all root tones in both cases: neither scales are equally spaced...</p><p>I still don&apos;t believe you&apos;ve done a triadic analysis for all the root tones in the scale.

I never said a near-pure 11/9, 22/15 were more<br/>consonant than a fairly impure 3/2, 5/4, etc.<br/>   What I rather mean is that say you have a chord with a 5/4 and a<br/>tri-tone...if the 5/4 is fairly off pure...it leaves less &quot;slack&quot; for the<br/>tri-tone to be off to make the chord with both end up sounding stable.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Also, you should know that I calculated the average dyadic harmonic entropy for<br/>&gt;every EDO from 5 to 37, and the only EDOs lower than 12 were 5 and 7.&quot;</p><p>     Seriously?  If so...that really makes me start to doubt dyadic harmonic<br/>entropy as a theory...   But I have a good clue why what you just said could<br/>occur...  Personally I already have gripes about how it champions the 5th as<br/>some ridiculous number of times more consonant than a major fourth...and the<br/>fourth much more consonant than the major third and then the minor third, that<br/>and so on.   My guess is 12TET got nailed for having a bad IE 13+ cent off major<br/>and minor third...and the fact those &quot;good&quot; dyads were so far off killed their<br/>chances to help &quot;balance out&quot; the bad ones on the average.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Even supposing you are right in your guess, the fact that your Dimension EC<br/>&gt;scale is judging consonance against the 11-limit and 12-tET is being judged<br/>&gt;against the 5-limit (to get the 54.5% figure I posted), well...the fact that you<br/>&gt;only improve on 12-tET by 5% to 15% despite adding two additional primes doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;say much. And I&apos;m still not convinced it&apos;s fair to call 11/9, 11/6, and 22/15<br/>&gt;&quot;consonances&quot;.&quot;<br/>   Have you tried 11/6 vs. even diatonic JI&apos;s 15/8?   I&apos;m sure 11/6 is right up<br/>there in consonance...  Far as 11/6 and 11/9...I would put them in the boat of<br/>&quot;more 7-limit consonance-like than 11-limit like&quot;...while I&apos;d say the bad ones<br/>sound &quot;more 13-limit-like and almost flat out noisy&quot;.</p><p>    Now if you want dissonance, try the 11-limits 16/11, 20/11, and 14/11 vs.<br/>the ones above.  You seem to be saying &quot;all 11-limit dyads must be more-or-less<br/>judged as equal so far as consonance&quot;...and I swear nothing could be further<br/>from the truth!  Furthermore take the higher limit 22/15 vs. the lower limit<br/>16/11...or 15/8 vs. 20/11.  I swear that&apos;s about as obvious as you can get far<br/>as examples that prove higher odd-limit dyads are not necessarily less consonant<br/>than lower limit ones...<br/>  To me, once you go over 7-limit or so...limits are not a reliable predictor of<br/>consonance anymore...</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;the 12-tone Minerva scale Gene posted is just about the best thing I&apos;ve seen<br/>so far for that...  And yes, &gt;that&apos;s considering all root tones in both cases:<br/>neither scales are equally spaced...<br/>Igs&gt;&quot;I still don&apos;t believe you&apos;ve done a triadic analysis for all the root tones<br/>in the scale. Unless you can talk specific numbers, you&apos;re just blowing hot<br/>air.&quot;</p><p>    I did dyadic analysis and, I swear, an (even) better alternative to triadic<br/>analysis AKA composing and actually using triads from the scale. Not like you<br/>believe me but...to be sure...I&apos;ll make some triads in a sound example with<br/>Gene&apos;s posted 12-tone Minerva scale as proof.  :-)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24721 href="#24721">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 7:18:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;Just passable&quot;?

I never said a near-pure 11/9, 22/15 were more<br/>&gt; consonant than a fairly impure 3/2, 5/4, etc.</p><p>Well, you sure seem to be implying that you think that, since you optimize your scales to nail those 11-limit intervals equally as well as lower-limit ones, giving them the same priority in tuning.  And you&apos;ve often expressed a preference for a &quot;good&quot; 11-limit interval over a &quot;bad&quot; (i.e. 15 cents off) 5-limit one.  Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but isn&apos;t your method in crafting scales based on attempting to get more &quot;good&quot; intervals by changing the definition of &quot;good&quot; to include intervals like 11/9, 22/15, 50/33, etc., basically to make an exaggerated high-limit well-temperament whereby different keys have different subsets of target dyads, but ONLY target dyads are included (i.e. there&apos;s no harmonic &quot;waste&quot; like the 40/27 wolf-fifth in 5-limit JI)?  So by your standards it would be better to have a scale with a few good 5/4s, a few good 11/9&apos;s, a few good 3/2&apos;s, a few good 22/15&apos;s, as opposed to a scale with all &quot;mediocre&quot; 5/4&apos;s and &quot;mediocre&quot; 3/2&apos;s?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Also, you should know that I calculated the average dyadic harmonic entropy for<br/>&gt; &gt;every EDO from 5 to 37, and the only EDOs lower than 12 were 5 and 7.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Seriously?  If so...that really makes me start to doubt dyadic harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy as a theory...   But I have a good clue why what you just said could<br/>&gt; occur...  Personally I already have gripes about how it champions the 5th as<br/>&gt; some ridiculous number of times more consonant than a major fourth...and the<br/>&gt; fourth much more consonant than the major third and then the minor third, that<br/>&gt; and so on.   My guess is 12TET got nailed for having a bad IE 13+ cent off major<br/>&gt; and minor third...and the fact those &quot;good&quot; dyads were so far off killed their<br/>&gt; chances to help &quot;balance out&quot; the bad ones on the average.</p><p>You misunderstand: low entropy = high concordance, so 12-tET has the 3rd highest average concordance; only 5-EDO and 7-EDO are more concordant on average.  As you go higher in the EDO&apos;s, you do get tunings where some interval classes go down in entropy--like in 19, the maj and min 3rd and 6th are all lower in entropy than in 12-tET--but always at the expense of adding intervals which are higher in entropy (like how 19-EDO has two minor 2nds, two major 7ths, two tritones, and not-so-hot subminor and supermajor 3rds and 6ths which are all near maxima of entropy, for a total of 10 high-entropy intervals vs. 12-tET&apos;s 3).  5-EDO has the lowest overall entropy, because two out of five intervals are near the two lowest-entropy intervals in the first octave (4/3 and 3/2).</p><p>&gt;    Have you tried 11/6 vs. even diatonic JI&apos;s 15/8?   I&apos;m sure 11/6 is right up<br/>&gt; there in consonance...</p><p>As a dyad, sure.  But a neutral 7th chord is waaaay down there, unless you omit the 3rd and make a 6:9:11 triad (which is pretty smooth).  If you try to put a neutral 7th on top of a major or minor 3rd, the result is pretty gnarly.</p><p>&gt; Far as 11/6 and 11/9...I would put them in the boat of<br/>&gt; &quot;more 7-limit consonance-like than 11-limit like&quot;...while I&apos;d say the bad ones<br/>&gt; sound &quot;more 13-limit-like and almost flat out noisy&quot;.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ll admit that 11/9 isn&apos;t much nastier than 9/7, but still...even a pure 11/9 I would rate as less consonant than any of the thirds in 12-tET.</p><p>&gt;     Now if you want dissonance, try the 11-limits 16/11, 20/11, and 14/11 vs.<br/>&gt; the ones above.  You seem to be saying &quot;all 11-limit dyads must be more-or-less<br/>&gt; judged as equal so far as consonance&quot;...and I swear nothing could be further<br/>&gt; from the truth!</p><p>No, I&apos;m not saying that...but I do think they are all drastically LESS consonant than anything in the 5-limit, and they are generally rather difficult to integrate with 5-limit intervals.</p><p>&gt;   To me, once you go over 7-limit or so...limits are not a reliable predictor of<br/>&gt; consonance anymore...</p><p>On this, we agree.  And Carl has warned me that Tenney Height stops being a reliable predictor of consonance once the product exceeds about 70.  And the reason for this is that above the 7-limit, the periodicity of the dyads in question because too complex to be identified...it&apos;s like polyrhythms, playing 2 against 3 is elementary, 4 against 5 a little harder but do-able, 7 against 3 a little advanced, but 11 or 13 against 4 is almost impossible for all but the most skilled.  An interval like 22/15 lacks all the perceptual qualities associated with something like 5/4 or 7/6 or whatever, it&apos;s not beatless and it doesn&apos;t do the &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; thing and it can&apos;t readily be differentiated from the nearby and only slightly more complex 25/17.  With intervals like these, H.E. seems to take over and proximity to lower-limit ratios seems to be a bigger factor.  Though intervals like 11/6, 11/7, 11/8, 11/9 might be on the threshold of Just.</p><p>&gt;     I did dyadic analysis and, I swear, an (even) better alternative to triadic<br/>&gt; analysis AKA composing and actually using triads from the scale. Not like you<br/>&gt; believe me but...to be sure...I&apos;ll make some triads in a sound example with<br/>&gt; Gene&apos;s posted 12-tone Minerva scale as proof.  :-)</p><p>No, sorry, that is NOT a &quot;better alternative&quot;.  You have no idea how many dissonant and consonant triads there are in a scale just by playing in it.  I&apos;ve been playing and composing in 12-tET for years and I could not have guessed that the triad analysis I did would have come out the way it did.  Unless you are willing to count and quantify the triads, any claims you make about a scale having more consonant chords than another scale are hogwash.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24732 href="#24732">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2011 9:45:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Spare us! 400 cents is 14 cents sharper than 5/4.

Can you distinguish it from 25/17?<br/>Can you tune it by ear? Can you &quot;sing it&quot; over a drone and NOT hit 25/17<br/>instead?&quot;</p><p>     25/17 is well within 7 cents of 22/15...actually I&apos;m pretty sure within<br/>about 3-4 cents of it (even near Gene&apos;s ideal limits).  So of course you can<br/>confuse the two.  Guess what...there have been listening tests that have said<br/>people actually like hearing/singing the pure fifth about 4 cents or so sharp.<br/>You&apos;re penny-picking here....</p><p>&gt;&quot;And either way, you say it functions like a fifth, you refer to it as a type of<br/>&gt;fifth all the time.&quot;</p><p>  Well...that doesn&apos;t mean I said it&apos;s a type of pure fifth (it certainly<br/>isn&apos;t)!   The closest thing I can think of, like I said before, is the neutral<br/>third which, yes, to an extent can flip between feeling major and minor...but,<br/>to an extent, has its own sound.  IMVHO, one would be foolish to think of a<br/>neutral third as &quot;just a horribly detuned major or minor 3rd&quot;.</p><p>   Load up a 22/15 in Scala and it says &quot;diminished 5th&quot;.  And that&apos;s much like<br/>what it sounds like...comparing the tonal flavor of a major triad to a 5:6:7<br/>chord...the latter sounds &quot;diminished&quot; in mood, but still relatively stable and<br/>certainly not a &quot;sour version of the major arrived at by mistake&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Regardless--if the 12-tone chords I mentioned AREN&apos;T approximating the 7-limit,<br/>&gt;then what are they?&quot;</p><p>   What are they?  Lousy chords (so far as establishing a tonal color/mood in<br/>many cases, at least)! :-D   No but seriously...there are a lot of conflicting<br/>relations between notes in 12TET.  Many of them summarize the x/16 or 16/x<br/>o-tonal/u-tonal harmonic or sub-harmonic series (think 16/9, 27/16, etc.) than<br/>anything 5-limit-ish or even 7-limit ish...<br/>   The 12TET tri-tone gets caught dead center between the 10/7 and 7/5, which<br/>both &quot;cast their shadows&quot; over it and pull it both ways strongly and the mind<br/>can&apos;t decide which one as the other interval always has such a strong grip it<br/>won&apos;t let it &quot;move&quot;...  17/12 (the lowest limit fraction anywhere very near it)<br/>doesn&apos;t have a fighting chance standing between two 7-limit fractions.<br/>   So the 12TET tri-tone ends up landing it in the middle of nowhere, far as<br/>having it&apos;s own identity.  This differs from, say 11/9...which is far enough<br/>from the major and minor 3rd, IMVHO, to escape exclusive pull to either of them<br/>(more than 20 cents away from each) and carry its own identity.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The point I&apos;m trying to make is that if you improve the consonance of one<br/>&gt;subset beyond 12-equal, the consonance of other subsets will drop, resulting in<br/>&gt;a net decrease in consonant chords within the overall scale&quot;</p><p>  I get what you are saying, but I don&apos;t believe it.  What I think kills the<br/>whole 12TET (and meantone) scale-making ethic is the idea of killing otherwise<br/>good combination left right and center to try and maintain perfect 5ths and the<br/>chords based around them.  Start allowing the occasional diminished 5th, neutral<br/>second, stretched 5th, and such...and I don&apos;t see any reason the subsets will<br/>have to drop.  The Minerva scale Gene posted, IMVHO, is a great example of this.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Well, you sure seem to be implying that you think that, since you optimize your<br/>&gt;scales to nail those 11-limit intervals equally as well as lower-limit ones,<br/>&gt;giving them the same priority in tuning.&quot;<br/>   Depends what you mean by &quot;priority&quot;...<br/>A)   There are some odd 20% 11-limit or more dyads in my Dimension tuning.  The<br/>rest (AKA the large majority) include some 7-limit but mostly 5 or less limit.<br/>The idea, again, is to balance the higher limit intervals in chords with lower<br/>limit ones.  So in a way they get &quot;lower&quot; priority IE there are far less of them<br/>than any other type of interval...on purpose.<br/>B)   I&apos;m actually more concerned about the accuracy/pureness of 11+ limit<br/>intervals in my scale than the lower limit ones.  11-limit+ intervals change<br/>mood GREATLY with even slight error.  Try 11/6 vs. 20/11...despite being about<br/>13 cents away from each other to mood difference is huge.  Same goes for 22/15<br/>vs. 16/11..similar cent error between the tones...huge difference in mood!<br/>      Now for 5/4...6/5...you can add 13 cents error and barely feel<br/>it...there&apos;s no interval strong enough to fight anything fairly near them and<br/>whatever you put near them easily serves the same musical purpose.  You don&apos;t<br/>have that &quot;slack&quot; in 11+ limit....</p><p>&gt;&quot;So by your standards it would be better to have a scale with a few good 5/4s, a<br/>&gt;few good 11/9&apos;s, a few good 3/2&apos;s, a few good 22/15&apos;s, as opposed to a scale<br/>&gt;with all &quot;mediocre&quot; 5/4&apos;s and &quot;mediocre&quot; 3/2&apos;s?&quot;</p><p>   Not even close!   I&apos;m saying it&apos;s better to have a scale with lots of good<br/>5-limit intervals, some good 7-limit ones, and a small (say 20% or less of<br/>dyads) to &quot;allow&quot; a few better higher limit intervals...<br/>.....then it is to try to brute-force everything into 5-limit and end up making<br/>many of the dyads highly mediocre...to the point you get crap like the 12TET<br/>tritone that can&apos;t even &quot;find an identity&quot; and the 6th that&apos;s a whole lot more<br/>like a 16/9 than a 9/5.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You misunderstand: low entropy = high concordance, so 12-tET has the 3rd<br/>&gt;highest average concordance; only 5-EDO and 7-EDO are more concordant on<br/>&gt;average.&quot;</p><p>    My bad...now I get it.  Now the fact 7TET and 5TET are rated so well is<br/>bugging me instead (lol).</p><p>&gt;&quot;5-EDO has the lowest overall entropy, because two out of five intervals are<br/>&gt;near the two lowest-entropy intervals in the first octave (4/3 and 3/2).&quot;</p><p>   Right, harmonic entropy champions lowest entropy intervals as having far more<br/>influence than anything else...and completely ignores things like the effect of<br/>higher-limit intervals or peaks of dissonance near certain 11-limit intervals<br/>like 20/11, but not others.  So I think it almost completely ignores a<br/>significant piece of the puzzle (yes, I consider the &quot;20%&quot; mentioned before as a<br/>significant piece).</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you try to put a neutral 7th on top of a major or minor 3rd, the result is<br/>&gt;pretty gnarly.&quot;<br/>  But you see...here you go insisting only on the most common &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>chords as benchmarks.  Why not try a 4th with your 11/6...or a neutral<br/>second?    That&apos;s the sort of thinking I use in the Dimension<br/>tuning....sometimes the thing that feels the most resolved in context....is NOT<br/>a common practice type chord...but something completely different.   And<br/>sometimes...two good 11-limit dyads can make a right (note the third dyad formed<br/>between a 11/9 neutral second and the 11/6 neutral 7th is (gasp!) a perfect<br/>fifth that balances them out! :-D</p><p>Me&gt;   To me, once you go over 7-limit or so...limits are not a reliable<br/>predictor of consonance anymore...<br/>Igs&gt;On this, we agree. And Carl has warned me that Tenney Height stops being a<br/>reliable predictor of consonance once the product exceeds about 70.</p><p>    Exactly!   All these things we&apos;ve been doing so far as harmonic entropy and<br/>such as well (based on Tenney Height) tend to fall apart over 7-limit as well.<br/>I think the real question becomes...how can we, with composition and theory,<br/>&quot;trick&quot; many parts of the 11-limit into working with lower-limits and not<br/>sounding out of place.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Though intervals like 11/6, 11/7, 11/8, 11/9 might be on the threshold of<br/>&gt;Just.&quot;<br/>  Because they are ratios using the lowest numbers for the limit they are in?!<br/>Again, if you guess that, I&apos;d use 15/8 and 22/15 as 15-limit counter examples.<br/>Another counter-example...14/11 I&apos;d actually say is worse than something like<br/>15/11 as 14/11 is so near 9/7 the two rather fight over identity.</p><p>&gt;&quot;No, I&apos;m not saying that...but I do think they are all drastically LESS<br/>&gt;consonant than anything in the 5-limit, and they are generally rather difficult<br/>&gt;to integrate with 5-limit intervals.&quot;</p><p>   See the above chord examples I made with the 11/6 neutral 7th.  Or my<br/>&quot;Dimension chord examples&quot; in my folder...all of which use 22/15&apos;s.</p><p>&gt;&quot;No, sorry, that is NOT a &quot;better alternative&quot;. You have no idea how many<br/>&gt;dissonant and consonant triads there are in a scale just by playing in it.&quot;</p><p>   We agree to disagree?   But to be fair...I made another post topic where I<br/>managed to get about 47% dissonant triads in 12TET...and quantify it...including<br/>doing an nCr calculation to get the total number of triads possible starting<br/>from C. Look for the post titled &quot;Dissonant triads in 12TET&quot;.  Next, if you<br/>want, I can do the same sort of thing with &quot;Consonant triads in Minerva&quot;.... :-)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24737 href="#24737">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2011 8:32:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Wed, Jan 19, 2011 at 5:01 PM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Subtle tonal color changes would be things like changing the type of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instrument playing a melody in a song or changing from a neutral to a major<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord in the same key....while less subtle changes would include things like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; changing chords to different types of chords with different root tones (IE C<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; major to D minor).

Am<br/>&gt; &gt; I correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally agree with this. Perhaps tonal variety is more what&apos;s<br/>&gt; being talked about. Paul Erlich elucidated a bit on this concept in<br/>&gt; his paper &quot;The Forms of Tonality,&quot; where he differentiated between<br/>&gt; tonal scales that are static vs dynamic. A 8:16 harmonic scale, for<br/>&gt; example, would be very &quot;static,&quot; and something like Ionian would be<br/>&gt; very dynamic. Mixolydian, on the other hand, is static.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul had a precise, rigorous definition of this which had something to<br/>&gt; do with leading tones; I don&apos;t remember exactly what it is. I have a<br/>&gt; more intuitive definition that I&apos;d quantify with how many different<br/>&gt; VF&apos;s are present in a scale, but I haven&apos;t worked it all out yet.</p><p>Paul&apos;s static vs. dynamic concept differentiates between different<br/>modes (rotations) of the same scale so your definition can&apos;t be about<br/>the same thing. In dynamic tonality the characteristic dissonance<br/>resolves to a consonance of the tonic chord in contrary motion and<br/>in rarer steps. In static tonality the characteristic dissonance is<br/>included in a chord of the next limit. The characteristic dissonance<br/>is a dissonant interval that spans the same number of steps as some<br/>consonance of the scale, like the diminished fifth for example.<br/>In mixolydian it forms an approximate 7-limit major tetrad with the<br/>tonic triad. BTW, I often wonder about the aeolian dynamic tonality,<br/>how common is this in music? I mean, what we call &quot;aeolian cadence&quot; is<br/>*not* something like D B F A -&gt; A C E A.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If I am, then it seems to me that it boils down to the<br/>&gt; &gt; number of identities the notes of scale can take. I mean the notes<br/>&gt; &gt; of the diatonic scale have different roles in different chords while<br/>&gt; &gt; the notes in a harmonic series segment strongly suggest a single<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental, thus no sense of shifting, harmonic movement or chord<br/>&gt; &gt; changes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, that&apos;s the intuitive definition I&apos;ve arrived at as well.
