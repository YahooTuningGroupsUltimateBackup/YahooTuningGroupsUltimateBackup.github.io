But what&apos;s the right year -<br/>1992 or (heh) 2007?</p><p>Nice bluesy guitar riff in Chuck Jones Jeff.</p><p>Only thing that appeals to me in Ipiales is the solid<br/>drumming; the tonal component is rather vague and<br/>feels directionless.</p><p>Remorseless is. :-)  I&apos;ve _known_ Nice Ladies like that<br/>... But 2:22 is way too short - I&apos;d like to hear a longer<br/>version of that, say about 4 minutes, with a big<br/>crescendo near the end.</p><p>So Many Words has a pretty guitar fill, and a strong,<br/>broad melody; there could be a pop song in there! 8-0</p><p>I like the rhythmic interplay between textures in<br/>The Myrmidons&apos; Road to Ibarra.  A bit like hearing<br/>a gamelan transported to the high Andes!</p><p>But the other three didn&apos;t cut it for me.</p><p>One question - why no singing?  Unusual in any &quot;rock&quot;<br/>group.</p><p>Oh OK, one MORE question - what parts of the music<br/>did _you_make?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=12047 href="#12047">ðŸ”—</a>Pete McRae &#x3C;petesfriedclams@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 10:13:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Yahya,</p><p>  Interesting comments, thanks VERY much!</p><p>  YouÂ’re teasing, right?</p><p>  I played everything. Guitar, bass, keys, cello, and drums/handdrums (in one case I overdubbed the kit, and in the other, I had the kit track first. Note: my drumming has improved considerably in some ways since then, but so has my discretion about recording it, I hope ;-). Oh, and Tarka (Bolivian subharmonic flute)!  [Fair warning: I have a clarinet now, and have learned to play it!]</p><p>  There are loops and sequences, but a terrible (;-) lot of it including the triggered-with-a-footswitch one-hit-at-a-time fuzz-toned and echo-ed snare sample on So Many Words, is actually played. c. 1992 is correct. I hope IÂ’m still alive in 2007 (smile).</p><p>  My singing and songwriting is very much a work in progress. ThereÂ’s a link on one of those soundclick pages that will supply all the evidence youÂ’ll ever need to explain why it languishes, perhaps. But I still dream, as Richard Thompson once sangÂ…</p><p>  Cheers,</p><p>  Pete</p><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>On Wed, 25 Jan 2006 &quot;ambassadorbob&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/themyrmidons">http://www.soundclick.com/themyrmidons</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/theniceladies">http://www.soundclick.com/theniceladies</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
