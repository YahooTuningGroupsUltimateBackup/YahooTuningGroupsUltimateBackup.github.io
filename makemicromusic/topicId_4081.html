By accepting MIDI Standard Retuning<br/>&gt; messages via sysex in *real time* - the FM7 can have it&apos;s tuning<br/>&gt; changed arbitrarily at any time</p><p>Sounds cool, but I don&apos;t work that way. I don&apos;t want to have to specify<br/>the re-tuning of each note, except for temporary pitch-bends. I set the<br/>synths to a static tuning and deal with scores in Finale. I don&apos;t like<br/>working at the MIDI level. Just personal preference.</p><p>&gt; By the way, it is not &quot;the Scala TUN format&quot; -- the TUN file format was<br/>&gt; invented by VAZ software&apos;s Martin Fay (<a href="http://www.software-technology.com">www.software-technology.com</a>) and both<br/>&gt; Manuel and I have added support to our programs for it.</p><p>Oh... Thanks for the info.</p><p>You went on to mention:</p><p>&gt; &gt; It really didn&apos;t support any sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning file that works with Scala...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, and this is not actually true - Scala DOES output MIDi files containing<br/>&gt; Standard MIDI Tuning messages, as does LMSO.</p><p>Again, that wouldn&apos;t be useful from my point of view. I don&apos;t like working<br/>that way.</p><p>By the way, this must be a new update of FM7? I thought last time I<br/>checked into it there was nothing like that available... None of their<br/>on-line literature/features list seems to talk about any of this.</p><p>Again, thanks for the up-to-date info.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=4095 href="#4095">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2003 9:14:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>X J Scott was saying...</p><p>&gt; Finale is capable of sending MIDI data, correct?</p><p>Mmm, well... I messed around a lot with Finale and read the manual and<br/>could not at all figure out how to insert arbitrary MIDI goop into a score.<br/>Yes, it can send MIDI data and gives you fine control over many things,<br/>but I scratched my head for a long time over sysex in Finale &amp; gave up.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, see the advantage is that you open your score in Finale which can<br/>&gt; have MIDI data in it right and it has your tuning data.</p><p>Yup, I see the advantage...</p><p>In any case, except for the FM7, I don&apos;t have any synths right now that<br/>use the MIDI tuning standard.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=4097 href="#4097">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2003 3:47:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>X J Scott said...</p><p>&gt; OK, I see the problem - so Finale works with MIDI but it can&apos;t open up .MID<br/>&gt; files.</p><p>Well, it actually Finale can open them, but an arbitrary &quot;.mid&quot; file<br/>translates into an equally arbitrary common music notation score. MIDI<br/>files usually don&apos;t have enough information score-wise, nor are they<br/>strictly enough timed to make good scores from. MIDI files are performances<br/>while Finale scores are scores. Having said that, there are definitely<br/>MIDI files that contain enough information to open as reasonable vanilla<br/>score files, as long as they are really clock-work performances with<br/>vanilla time signatures.</p><p>&gt; So you *do* have the fm7?</p><p>Well, no. As I said, I didn&apos;t think it had what I needed. At this point,<br/>I&apos;m holding out for Big Tick&apos;s new entry into the game.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
