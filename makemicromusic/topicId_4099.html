Just curious...</p><p>&gt;he worked tirelessly for no reward with the NI guys to first convince them &gt;to add the features because he told them there was this huge demand...</p><p>Well, *there* was his first error. I checked today: 124 members. Probably not all using synths, maybe more than a few not using computers as well. More in a moment...</p><p>&gt;I even helped by contributing example scale files for testing! This was a &gt;very exciting project. The first fully microtonal softsynth was being &gt;built by the world leaders in intuitive full featured soft synths.</p><p>Then the process, and your help, must have been a fine reward.</p><p>&gt;Why am I not surprised that one year later not a single person on this &gt;list even knew offhand what the rist price was.</p><p>You don&apos;t know that - only one person asked, and maybe others are away from their computer or don&apos;t have it in their head or any number of other reasons. Maybe the others thought it was a bit steep for their needs, so they just forgot about it. Maybe they work in other ways (acoustic instruments, hardware synths, Csound, etc.). Me? I just invested short of that $$ amount in a vintage TX-802 last year, and haven&apos;t had enough free time to sort that out. And I bought it *in spite of the fact* that I am not a big fan of FM synthesis. And I say that knowing that I bought one of the first TX81Z modules when they were new (after having a DX7), and still have that plus another 81Z plus a DX11 (which is usually just used as my kbd controller).</p><p>And you want me to buy a new FM plugin synth? You wanna send me the free cash? :)</p><p>Another thing: we *all* work in different ways, and I&apos;ve spent the last week, at night, downloading some of the various VST instruments I&apos;ve heard about recently (sparked by Jacky&apos;s piece) and finding a suitable VST host program. I&apos;ve been around this stuff a long time and it hasn&apos;t been easy to just get it going, but I did. And what I find - still - is that it is difficult to play them in realtime without significant latency periods. I DO NOT LIKE IT when I play the keys and the sound comes x milleseconds later, or hiccups.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying the NI stuff works this way, though I have played with Kontakt and found similar problems.</p><p>Non-real-time sequencing and composing? Sure, I could do that, but sometimes I like to play the things and hear stuff that makes me curious or smile or whatever.</p><p>Just give &apos;us&apos; a little break if 124 people didn&apos;t run out and get the download and pop for the cost. I&apos;m sure people will. And those that don&apos;t shouldn&apos;t get slammed for it. If it turned out great, you can be a happy contributor. If it flys off the (virtual) shelves, excellent. But the world changes slowly, and people here are changing it in different ways, some big, some small. And some people, maybe, just want to make music and NOT lead a microtonal crusade. That&apos;s fine with me, too.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=4112 href="#4112">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2003 2:11:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>X J wrote...</p><p>&gt; The Fanatics on the Tuning list don&apos;t compose any so why<br/>&gt; the hell wolud they need instruments.

I got on the NI mail list for info &amp; updates, I<br/>corresponded with them to tell them what I was looking for. I don&apos;t recall<br/>seeing any big whoop-de-do about improvements in the FM7 that would have<br/>made me change my mind, so it never re-entered my radar field.</p><p>But Big Tick&apos;s Rainbow 2.5 and Peter Frazer&apos;s Midicode sort of did what I<br/>want and they have decent tuning support, and I interacted with the authors<br/>and paid some money and bought them. And I have TX802s as well. Oh, yeah,<br/>and I bought the VAZ2010 and the VAZ Modular as well, and those have decent<br/>tuning also. And I&apos;ll get Big Tick&apos;s Rhino when that&apos;s available. I think<br/>I&apos;m spending quite enough money on soft synths, thank you. (VAZ Modular is<br/>a nice VST 2.0 host, by the way!)</p><p>And I use these tools, at least a bit. I&apos;m not complaining. Who&apos;s<br/>complaining? I got tools that do what I want.

I was playing with the Rhino 0.9 demo and this<br/>is some messing-around-on-the-keyboard improv with a harmonic tuning and a<br/>patch that I called &quot;Fuzzy China&quot;...

I&apos;m making music all the time, and it will have to fit in with the full plate.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;re a fine composer and you of all people should be writing music.</p><p>Life is not easy right now, with many personal issues that come before my sitting down and composing music. I&apos;ll get back to it when everyone I help take care of is it good shape. If that is OK with you...</p><p>&gt;That FM7 is an absolute steal for what it does.</p><p>Sure. Especially if you like FM sounds. And working in a computer/plugin environment. My point was that maybe, just *maybe* not everyone cares to work that way.</p><p>&gt;Jeez, there&apos;s even a free demo!</p><p>I&apos;ve been trying demos for a week. I&apos;ll try that one as well.</p><p>&gt;I had to work in shitholes to save up for my first synthesizer which cost &gt;$1995 (a DX7). This this is 3/20 that cost and does so much more and even &gt;increases in<br/>&gt;capability and quality when people upgrade their computer or soundcard.<br/>&gt;Hardware synths don&apos;t do that.</p><p>Thanks. I figured that all out already.</p><p>&gt;Everyone in this group had an opportunity to provide feedback if they &gt;aren&apos;t satisfied with the microtuning facilities they have only themselves &gt;to blame.</p><p>Right. Who said they were dissatisfied? You just roasted the entire list for not going out and buying it!</p><p>&gt;But the fact is that this thing has more extensive microtonal support than &gt;anything else out there so there is genuinely no excuse whatsover.</p><p>That&apos;s silly. What if you don&apos;t like the way it sounds? Doesn&apos;t that mean more than if it is the &quot;most microtonal&quot;? And since it&apos;s software, it will only get better. So maybe I&apos;ll wait. And maybe they&apos;ll fold. My dilemma, which I don&apos;t need to take grief over!</p><p>&gt;The Fanatics on the Tuning list don&apos;t compose any so why the hell wolud &gt;they need instruments. You&apos;re all a bunch of phoneys and I pity you &gt;because you have so much potential you are squandering while the world &gt;moves on.</p><p>I&apos;d say at this point you owe quite a few people an apology.</p><p>&gt;No one can save you from that but yourselves.</p><p>Then why berate &apos;us&apos;?</p><p>&gt;I think most of you are just a bunch of spoiled little brats and you need &gt;to grow up.</p><p>If you&apos;ll take note of the main page of MMM, as well as the blurb that goes out to all new members, we strive to be civil. I won&apos;t say any more, assured that you can make your points without calling everyone names.
