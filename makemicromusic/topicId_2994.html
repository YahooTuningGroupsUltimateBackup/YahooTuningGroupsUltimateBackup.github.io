How does this one do with mono-legato mode?<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve been also curious about how the DS-1 has evolved. Know anything<br/>&gt;about it? Or is &apos;Session&apos; the new DS-1?</p><p>&quot;Session&quot; is the new Bitheadz software that incorporates DS-1 (the sampler)<br/>and the AS-1 (a synth). I remember that the old DS-1 had a flaw in that<br/>you couldnt do legato-mode at the same time as microtonal scales<br/>(or you could, but it failed to recognize the subsequent notes at<br/>the correct pitches). I think they fixed this, but Id better check<br/>for sure.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The downside is that this seriously stresses a G3/500 mac and<br/>&gt;&gt; only works for a few voices at once. The workaround is to record<br/>&gt;&gt; a few voices, make some new ones, record them, etc...</p><p>&gt;Seriously though - this is the way I usually have to work with these<br/>&gt;things, and my CPU is well over twice this. There&apos;s just no way (yet)<br/>&gt;to use these softsynths in the manner that one would sequence<br/>&gt;hardware synths to have a whole arrangement going at once.</p><p>I sort of agree, but sort of disagree... even using hardware<br/>synths/samplers, I was constantly premixing to disk anyway<br/> - sometimes its the MIDI bandwidth (and/or using pitch bend midi<br/>to get around the 16 channel/note restriction), sometimes<br/>its that the particular synth module doesnt have the polyphony<br/>(i.e., VL70m!) - theres always limitations...</p><p>--Bill</p></div>
