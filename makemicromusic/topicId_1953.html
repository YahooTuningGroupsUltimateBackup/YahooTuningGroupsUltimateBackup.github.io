Originally all the parts were playing in this non<br/>octave scale, but the various voices were at octave intervals.</p><p>Both are there now and you can compare them.<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy/Musicforasummer'sevening/">http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy/Musicforasummer'sevening/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy/Musicforasummer'sevening-nonoctave/">http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy/Musicforasummer'sevening-nonoctave/</a></p><p>I&apos;ve also done my old waterwheel from the list,<br/>using voices at a 5/3 with each other, when they were<br/>originally at octaves.</p><p>They play the just diatonic scale,<br/>but keep to six notes (leaves out the B of C major<br/>in the flute part)</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3</p><p>I uploaded it accidentally to<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/robertwalker/theoldwaterwheel">http://www.mp3.com.au/robertwalker/theoldwaterwheel</a><br/>and will be moving it to<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy/theoldwaterwheel">http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy/theoldwaterwheel</a></p><p>Some others too, at<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy">http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy</a></p><p>Plus added more of my old pieces to<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/robertwalker">http://www.mp3.com.au/robertwalker</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
