I like it because it<br/>&gt; seems to work better than mp3, and has the advantage of being patent<br/>&gt; free and open source, which deflects potential problems.</p><p>I did some research on .mp3 vs .ogg. I might consider migrating to .ogg,<br/>because it&apos;s consistent with my open source philosophy (I use Linux). It&apos;s<br/>file sizes are generally smaller than mp3&apos;s, and I can hear no difference in<br/>audio quality between an ogg file and an mp3 at a given bitrate. I did hear a<br/>difference between them with a 128kbps, constant-bit rate mp3, and a<br/>128kbps-average, variable-bit-rate ogg. The ogg was crisper, with clearer<br/>high-end, but I think I could get similar quality out of an mp3 with the<br/>write command-line switches on the LAME encoder.</p><p>However, this was hardly &apos;scientific&apos;. The default variable-bit algorithm<br/>(VBR) for &apos;oggenc&apos; allows one to specify an average bit-rate, where the VBR<br/>option on &apos;lame&apos; (the linux mp3 encoder) is an abstract &apos;quality&apos; parameter.<br/>So, the problem with making an ABX comparison in my case is that it&apos;s hard to<br/>tell what command line switches for &apos;oggenc&apos; and &apos;lame&apos; are close in quality,<br/>all else being equal. So, I was comparing a fixed-bitrate mp3 (the &apos;lame&apos;<br/>default) with a variable-bitrate ogg (which averages, but sometimes exceeds,<br/>the same fixed rate of the mp3), giving the ogg an advantage. Perhaps the<br/>true test would be to make the highest quality .mp3 and .ogg files possible,<br/>and do the ABX comparison from those. I doubt any discernible difference<br/>could be heard at all, though, because at the highest bitrates, both would be<br/>indistinguishable from CD audio....</p><p>So for me the only differences are file size, where ogg has a slight<br/>advantage; open source, where ogg has the better philosophy for me, and<br/>ubiquitousness, where mp3 has a distinct lead. I think that can be fixed by a<br/>healthy public campaign for ogg files, but there a lot of inertia in the<br/>industry because of things like iPod, etc. But I&apos;d just as soon make people<br/>download software for a free format, as they make me download things for<br/>their proprietary (Windoze-based) formats! I think Real Audio sucks, and<br/>sounds like AM radio most of the time. Maybe its just what default setting<br/>people tend to use. BTW, how does one *encode* to .ra or .ram from .wav?</p><p>...perhaps I&apos;ll start making ogg files, and do my part to push the industry to<br/>doing the right thing, and helping ogg mature.....</p><p>Sorry if this is considered by some to be off-topic for this list ;) I at<br/>least consider it as on-topic as say, softsynths. We all tend to share our<br/>music in compressed audio formats, after all, so its worth figuring things<br/>out and comparing notes...</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6579 href="#6579">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2004 9:15:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron K Johnson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I might consider migrating to .ogg,<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s consistent with my open source philosophy</p><p>I would never consider migrating to .ogg because:<br/>&#x9;1.

(Just ask the US national<br/>archives, census bureau, etc.) One thing that helps is to make sure your<br/>data format is in a format as widely supported as possible, because the<br/>most widely supported formats are most likely to endure in some form, and<br/>be documented for posterity.</p><p>&gt; BTW, how does one *encode* to .ra or .ram from .wav?</p><p>Probably buy something from the RealAudio folks, or maybe there&apos;s a &quot;free&quot;<br/>writer program...
