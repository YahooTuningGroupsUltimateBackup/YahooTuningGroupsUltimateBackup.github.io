Unfortunately the entry was not accepted for performance but undeterred I present to you a performance of the score rendered by Garritan Personal Orchestra. There is a bit of a story behind this piece which is explained on the blog. While this piece was targeted for a real performance on 12 euqal instruments I can now give you a computer rendering using Kraig Grady&apos;s Centaur A 7-Cap Just Intonation tuning. A small note here  a requirement of entry into the composition was that the composition could not exceed 1 minute in length. This piece is about 53 seconds long.</p></div><h3>Caleb Morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2011 1:48:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like this one, too.
