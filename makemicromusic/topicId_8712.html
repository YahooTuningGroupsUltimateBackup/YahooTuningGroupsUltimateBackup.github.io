Thanks for drawing attention to it, Igs -- it seems that only<br/>the 7-note and 15-note varieties have gotten people&apos;s attention<br/>before, while the 8-note version is really the most illustrative of<br/>the Porcupine &quot;Forms of Tonality&quot; as in my paper of that name.</p><p>Take the triadic chord progression</p><p>F# minor (F#-A-C#)<br/>A major     (A-C#-E)<br/>(E sus4)   ((A-B-E))<br/>E minor     (G-B-E)<br/>G major     (G-B-D)<br/>(D sus4)    (G-A-D)<br/>D minor     (F-A-D)<br/>F major     (F-A-C)<br/>F minor     (F-Ab-C)</p><p>and render it in your favorite tuning system, holding common tones<br/>constant from one chord to the next. Only one note changes from one<br/>chord to the next if you include the optional sus chords in<br/>parentheses. What happens? Well, in 12-equal, clearly you end one<br/>semitone lower than you began. In JI, you end 250:243, or 49.2 cents<br/>lower. But in 15-equal, 22-equal, 29-equal, TOP Porcupine, and other<br/>porcupine tunings, you end right back where you began. The &quot;F# minor&quot;<br/>and &quot;F minor&quot; end up being exactly the same chord! Thus a nice smooth<br/>8-chord cycle is possible in these tunings that isn&apos;t possible in JI,<br/>12-equal, meantone, or most other tunings.</p><p>What pitches do you need for this chord progression? In porcupine<br/>tunings, you need only 8 pitches, and these form a scale with 7<br/>identical &quot;large&quot; steps and 1 &quot;small&quot; steps. In 22-equal, the pitches<br/>from the chord progression above fall as follows:</p><p>Initial A = Final Ab<br/>+Small Step (1 degree of 22)<br/>= Final A<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= B<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= C = C#<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= D<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= E<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= F = F#<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= G<br/>+Large Step (3 degrees of 22)<br/>= Initial A = Final Ab</p><p>This is the 8-note Porcupine scale Igliashon was referring to. It<br/>works great for melody, and it works great for chord progressions.<br/>But it&apos;s not so great for a homophonic style that plays all the notes<br/>of the scale against chords. There aren&apos;t really any tonally stable<br/>modes (to my ears so far). So perhaps it would be best for a kind of<br/>modal counterpoint, where the melodic utility of the scale would be<br/>brought out clearly, but the notes heard sounding together would<br/>largely be restricted to belong to one of the consonant chords in the<br/>progression above.</p><p>More on this when there&apos;s actual music to present -- and I hope<br/>others will attempt to create some examples too!</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=8742 href="#8742">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2005 1:51:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yeah, we noticed the &quot;length-higher harmonics&quot; phenomenon and were<br/>careful to compensate for it...hence using lower-pitched 3/4&quot; for the<br/>bass range.  We&apos;ve found actually that drilling holes *lowers* the<br/>pitch slightly (confused the heck out of me, but repeat experiments<br/>verify original findings), at least on our higher bars.  We&apos;ve also<br/>tested the wire for buzzy-ness and found it not to be a problem as<br/>long as it&apos;s not too tight.  We&apos;ve experimented extensively and found<br/>that using elastic or coated wire causes dampening of many of the<br/>harmonics, as well as a decrease in volume; suspending via wire<br/>allows the bars to ring more freely.  We also cut the bars slightly<br/>unevenly so that one side is slightly longer than the other, which<br/>enhances the inharmonic beating of individual notes (which we<br/>desire).  The final product will look sort of like a rope-ladder<br/>lying flat, but suspended a few inches off the base.  There will be<br/>two offset rows of bars on the higher-octave set, with the bottom row<br/>being Porcupine-8 and the top row being various accidentals that<br/>combine with certain notes of the Porcupine to form a symmetrical<br/>decatonic scale.  Pics will be forthcoming once we&apos;re finished...it&apos;s<br/>a big mofo, to be sure.</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; usually when you get past a certain length, the higher harmonics<br/>come<br/>&gt; out higher than the fundamental. i recommend doing all you fine<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; first , although on higher tubes the drilling of the node holes can<br/>&gt; raise it slightly. try holding the tube at the point you would<br/>drill and<br/>&gt; hitting it , just to make sure that spot is correct. the smaller<br/>the<br/>&gt; hole the better. wire might make noise, i have used elastic from<br/>sewing<br/>&gt; stores pushing it through the hole just large enough to let it pass<br/>till<br/>&gt; it stick out of the end and tying a knot and pulling back, leaving<br/>what<br/>&gt; you need to tie it down . most of the time placing it on foam and<br/>&gt; putting the elastic through this into a hole in the mounting board<br/>and<br/>&gt; tying another knot<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igliashon Jones wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;out of curiosity what is the longest length you have, you might<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;well<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;give me the shortest too<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ll have to get back to you tomorrow, Stevie has all our<br/>&gt; &gt;measurements.

To make sounds from<br/>software<br/>&gt; is one thing; to use it to record live stuff (either through line<br/>inputs or<br/>&gt; mics), which I think was one of your initial specs, is another.<br/>Doing all<br/>&gt; of that means another scenario. When you have a pretty good idea,<br/>then you<br/>&gt; can look at the options.

When you do this in realtime, either through playing or having a softsynth play a part in a sequencer, it is using the CPU to create the sound patches in realtime (unlike an external synth, where a midi stream with relatively little data, tells it what to do - in this instance, the computer&apos;s CPU is hardly straining). If you have very complex sounds programmed, or you have many tracks with softsynths, you start bulking up the workload on the CPU. Eventually, you either run into problems (glitches, drop-outs), the system stops or crashes, or you avoid the problem with various tricks (bouncing a track to an audio file, &apos;freezing&apos; tracks [an automated version of the former], etc.).</p><p>Hope this clarifies a couple of areas...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=8982 href="#8982">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2005 8:52:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

The word &quot;synth&quot; conjures immediately for me a piece of<br/>software -- I never think about hardware synths anymore.  Moog is<br/>apparently the only company with growth in this area.  10 out of<br/>10 of the most frequently mentioned NAMM announcements (in tech)<br/>this year were software products.  Even the *new* Korg OASYS<br/>(keyboard) is a Linux machine!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=9001 href="#9001">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.
