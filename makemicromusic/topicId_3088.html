I realize<br/>that opinions will differ. I wrote this after seeing some<br/>recommendations implemented for very specific circumstances.  In some<br/>cases these requests can be counterproductive as manufacturers get<br/>different requests from different users, some of them contradictory with<br/>one another.  The list was intended to make things easier for the<br/>manufacturers while accommodating the widest range of needs. It was also<br/>based upon my knowledge of how these instruments are usually designed,<br/>so that everything in the list should be feasible.</p><p>&gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; The advanced architecture<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;* 128 or more full keyboard or 12 note octave microtuning<br/>&gt; tables<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The word &apos;or&apos; here really troubles me as a manufacturer<br/>&gt; will see that and say &apos;well then, we&apos;ll just do the 12<br/>&gt; note octave one since it uses less memory&apos;. 12 note<br/>&gt; octave instruments are completely useless to me and<br/>&gt; many other microtonalists and I really don&apos;t think we<br/>&gt; should be encouraging ANYTHING other than full keyboard<br/>&gt; arbitrary microtuning. Nothing else is acceptable in<br/>&gt; the sense that I wouldn&apos;t buy it or be able to use it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry, this is a typo that obviously escaped me as even the moderate<br/>architecture recommends both full keyboard and 12 note scales.</p><p>&gt; &gt;* tables are stored globally and assigned per part, track or<br/>&gt; MIDI channel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see why this is recommended. I would prefer by<br/>&gt; PATCH. That way my bagpipe has a bagpipe tuning and my<br/>&gt; gender is tuned to sulendro.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This one is easy.  The Ensoniq EPS, EPS16+ and ASR-10 have patches<br/>stored per patch.  Guess what? Because these tables take up so much room<br/>in RAM, they end up getting limited in quantity.  Use more than eight<br/>microtunings and you have to create an entirely new instrument<br/>_including_all_samples_, which is a huge drawback. Yes, it&apos;d be nice to<br/>have as many tunings per patch as desired, but this would require<br/>manufacturers to create their patches with a &quot;linked list&quot; type<br/>structure, and most of them simply aren&apos;t architected that way. Asking<br/>them to completely re-architect for microtuning support won&apos;t happen.</p><p>Global tunings assigned per patch also greatly simplifies housekeeping<br/>of patches. If you have an instrument with 1000 patches, do you really<br/>want to copy or create from scratch every tuning that you use?</p><p>&gt; &gt;* tables can be selected using short SysEx messages or the<br/>&gt; MIDI Tuning Standard<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I believe this is part of the 2nd ed of the MIDI<br/>&gt; Tuning Standard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;* keyboard tables tunable per note over the entire MIDI range<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly should be full keyboard retunable -- or at<br/>&gt; least over the range that the instrument uses. Absolute<br/>&gt; requirements on specific frequencies at the outlying<br/>&gt; range I caution against as such a demand will work<br/>&gt; against us here, requiring some instruments to<br/>&gt; implement new custom chips.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This would be a good clarification of the request, though in reality<br/>most instruments can transpose as far as you want, it just won&apos;t sound<br/>good.</p><p>&gt; &gt; * octave tables tunable +-100 cents per note including the<br/>&gt; tonic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it is a bad idea even to suggest including such<br/>&gt; an extremely limited feature. Be careful what you ask<br/>&gt; for you might get it - and only it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I should include some reasoning behind the 12 note per octave tunings.<br/>This helps support adaptive tuning software such as Justonic&apos;s Pitch<br/>Palette. You cannot do adaptive tunings using full keyboard tunings over<br/>MIDI, because you cannot transfer that amount of MIDI data without<br/>interrupting the note timings.</p><p>&gt; &gt;* octave tables include assignable tonic note<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; * 0.0061 cent or best pitch resolution<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This recommendation seems OK (that&apos;s the MIDI Tuning<br/>&gt; Standard resolution right?) but seems to work against<br/>&gt; the implication of 1 cent resolution contained in the<br/>&gt; +/-100 cent request. I&apos;ll note that the actual pitch<br/>&gt; *precision* will be determined by the resolution of the<br/>&gt; hardware&apos;s phase increment register, which is<br/>&gt; proportional to frequency.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure why +-100 cent tuning implies 1 cent resolution.</p><p>I&apos;m well aware of the phase increment limitations.  The request for<br/>.0061 cent resolution gives manufacturers a hint that these need finer<br/>resolution.  Perhaps I should just spell that out? However, that&apos;s<br/>usually not the limiting factor.  The majority of synthesizers on the<br/>market are multi-sample based.  These multisamples are tuned to<br/>accuracies on the order of 1-3 cents typically.  Once a multisample is<br/>tuned this badly, you cannot correct it with a finer resolution tuning<br/>table unless you want to fine tune every single instrument for every<br/>single tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;* Fine pitch detuning for oscillators or samples can be<br/>&gt; specified in cents or Hertz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK -- but how would this work?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You have Oscillator A &amp; Oscillator B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oscillator A is set to &quot;freq=1.0 det=0.0&quot; which<br/>&gt; -really- means A=440Hz. Now if we set Oscillator B to<br/>&gt; &quot;freq=1.0 det=+6Hz&quot; -- what does that mean?? Does that<br/>&gt; mean that *whatever* pitch the fundamental of<br/>&gt; oscillator A is generating, the fundamental of B should<br/>&gt; be 6 Hz above it? That means that B&apos;s pitch will *vary*<br/>&gt; in cents depending on the pitch height of oscillator A.<br/>&gt; This is a rather esoteric and difficult to implement<br/>&gt; feature, as well as being somewhat ambiguous in its<br/>&gt; realization.</p><p>Kurzweil K2x00 implements Hertz detuning as an option. It tracks over<br/>the keyboard, so a constant rate of beating occurs over the entire<br/>range.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;* full keyboard tables can be dumped and loaded using the MIDI<br/>&gt; Tuning Dump Standard and to local storage<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;* 12 note octave tables can be dumped and loaded using SysEx<br/>&gt; and also to local storage<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please, no more talk of &apos;12&apos; and &apos;octave&apos; in the<br/>&gt; context of &quot;Advanced Tuning Features&quot;. One would not<br/>&gt; even be able to tune a piano patch properly with such a<br/>&gt; castrated &apos;feature&apos;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>See my comments above about adaptive tunings. They simply cannot be<br/>accomplished in real time over MIDI using full keyboard tables, so yes,<br/>they are advanced features.</p><p>&gt; &gt;* tuning is updated either instantly or for new notes only<br/>&gt; when changing tables, selected globally<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes this is a nice feature. I think the reason that it<br/>&gt; is specified as optional in the MIDI Tuning Standard is<br/>&gt; that some of the hardware can not support it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Might be nice in a &apos;wish list&apos; to make this choice a<br/>&gt; parameter that is included in the table change method<br/>&gt; so a composer can select either oen from his/her<br/>&gt; sequence, depending on the compositional needs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I want to say that if this is really a wish list<br/>&gt; it&apos;s time to update it. Everything here is in the<br/>&gt; context of fixed gamut tunings. This is old news and<br/>&gt; not what is needed for the next generation of<br/>&gt; instruments.</p><p>Again, see the above about using 12 note tuning tables for adaptive<br/>tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are bare requirements:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. All instruments should provide support for midi mode<br/>&gt; &apos;omni on mono on&apos; also known as &apos;guitar mode&apos;, where a<br/>&gt; single patch voice recieves note on and pitch bend<br/>&gt; messages on separate channels &apos;per string&apos; instead of<br/>&gt; on one channel. And when recieving a pitch bend before<br/>&gt; a note on, the new note should not glide or squeak as<br/>&gt; it does in some instruments. This feature will allow<br/>&gt; programs like Robert&apos;s fts to take total control over<br/>&gt; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. All 14 bits of pitch bend recieved over MIDI should<br/>&gt; be decoded and applied to tuning, even if the physical<br/>&gt; controller is only 7 or 8 bits.</p><p>While I might like to see these features, I do not agree that asking for<br/>them in the context of microtuning requests is productive.  If<br/>manufacturers are going to implement features just for microtonalists,<br/>why not just request tuning support instead of limited monophonic<br/>support using pitch bends?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are wish list requirements:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All instruments should provide support for midi<br/>&gt; processing plugin modules using a standard API, and<br/>&gt; provide a developers kit for the development of such<br/>&gt; modules (ie compiler for the synth&apos;s controller chip)<br/>&gt; and a mechanism through sysex by mhich they can be<br/>&gt; updated. I strongly recommend VSTi as the API. These<br/>&gt; modules can be stored in an internal plugin patch area<br/>&gt; so that the extended functionality can exist in the<br/>&gt; instrument on stage, freed from a computer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is what we really need. With this, people can<br/>&gt; write tuning processing modules that implement whatever<br/>&gt; realstime retuning system desired, and upload them to<br/>&gt; their instruments, and perform in public without having<br/>&gt; to use a unreliable crash prone PC.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This will never happen with hardware synths.  Manufacturers will never<br/>give access to the synth controller chip, as this would give away too<br/>much of their intellectual property to their competitors. They will not<br/>release developer kits because this implies support of a tool that they<br/>have no resources to support. Finally, they will not re-architect their<br/>entire synth/MIDI engine just to accommodate requests from<br/>microtonalists. Making realistic requests based upon the lowest possible<br/>impact to synthesizer engineering development gives us the best options<br/>for success.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...<br/>one@...</p></div><h3><a id=3129 href="#3129">ðŸ”—</a>John Loffink &#x3C;jloffink@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2002 3:32:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hm, that&apos;s weird. When I think of per-patch support,<br/>&gt; what I mean is that there is a bank somewhere with your<br/>&gt; 12 or 16 or 128 tunings. Then, in each patch, there is<br/>&gt; a single byte that selects the tuning. So tuning # 41<br/>&gt; can be your usual bagpipe tuning &amp; you have all your<br/>&gt; bagpipes set to tuning #41. If you want to change the<br/>&gt; tuning of all the bagpipe patchs, just change the<br/>&gt; tuning stored in tuning slot #41.</p><p>We&apos;re talking about the same thing.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Global tunings assigned per patch also greatly simplifies<br/>&gt; &gt; housekeeping of patches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;Assigned per patch&apos; ... OK, so are you then suggesting<br/>&gt; on your page exactly what I just said? If so I agree<br/>&gt; with you but the way it is described didn&apos;t suggest to<br/>&gt; me that that&apos;s what it was...</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; I do understand that, but why limit it to 12 note<br/>&gt; octave tunings? Why not allow the user instead to send<br/>&gt; a message defining N notes, starting at any note number<br/>&gt; desired. The system then extrapolates the scale by<br/>&gt; transposing. Would take about the same bandwidth as the<br/>&gt; 12 octave thing but would be substantially more<br/>&gt; versatile. This should be the way the standard short<br/>&gt; tuning messages work instead of being constrained to an<br/>&gt; octave and 12 tones.</p><p>Theoretically this could be the best way to do it, but realistically the<br/>more realtime processing you add the more unlikely it is that your<br/>request will be met.  Extrapolating scales on the fly seems simple in<br/>conception but you have to understand the limited hardware that these<br/>synthesizers run on.  When they start managing execution of 64 to 128<br/>voices they simply don&apos;t have extra processing time for more complicated<br/>functions. That&apos;s why I recommend what amounts to simply move<br/>instructions by use of a 12 note scale definition.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure why +-100 cent tuning implies 1 cent resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As opposed to +/-100.0 or 100.000.<br/>&gt; I think that a manufacturer reading that could infer 1<br/>&gt; cent resolution unless made super clear.</p><p>Okay, good point.  I did once have someone write to me that they<br/>couldn&apos;t do the just intonation scales at my site because their<br/>synthesizer couldn&apos;t be tuned to four decimal places as denoted in my<br/>tuning tables.</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, that&apos;s usually not the limiting<br/>&gt; &gt; factor.  The majority of synthesizers on the market are<br/>&gt; &gt; multi-sample based.  These multisamples are tuned to<br/>&gt; &gt; accuracies on the order of 1-3 cents typically.  Once a<br/>&gt; &gt; multisample is tuned this badly, you cannot correct it with a<br/>&gt; &gt; finer resolution tuning table unless you want to fine tune<br/>&gt; &gt; every single instrument for every single tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK but that&apos;s a different issue.<br/>&gt; Not sure if its true that the majority of synthesizers<br/>&gt; on the market fit this 3 cent thing, but I can believe<br/>&gt; that its true of some or many.</p><p>It&apos;s true of every wavetable synthesizer and sampler on the market.<br/>There is more hope for DSP Analog Modeled instruments, but most of these<br/>don&apos;t even support tuning tables.</p><p>&gt; &gt; See my comments above about adaptive tunings. They simply<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot be accomplished in real time over MIDI using full<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard tables, so yes, they are advanced features.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They can be accomplished with single note retunings,<br/>&gt; which would be a more versatile thing to request.</p><p>I concur, single note retunings might be better, but it depends how you<br/>want the notes to change over time. In practice it seems easier to<br/>change the whole scale at once, otherwise you must individually insert<br/>note retuning requests in your MIDI file.  I will have to think about<br/>this some as it should be a part of my recommended architectures.</p><p>&gt; And I still think that the short tuning message should<br/>&gt; not be constrained to 12 or octave since there is no<br/>&gt; need to do so.</p><p>This one accommodates the manufacturer.  Many of them use just 12 note<br/>tables, then transpose for octaves. It is often built into the<br/>synthesizer ASICs and may not be oversome by software.  When bringing<br/>out new synthesizers the same designs are leveraged over again.<br/>Kurzweil, Emu, Roland, et al have basically been using the same designs<br/>for over 10 years. This wills not change just based upon our requests.</p><p>&gt; Yes I understand that issue but what do you think about<br/>&gt; my own perspective and suggestions?</p><p>Your suggestions are very good and valuable.  From an ideal<br/>implementation perspective they may be better than my recommendations.<br/>I&apos;ve tried to factor in the man-hours it will take manufacturers to<br/>develop these ideas so that it&apos;s something that they can reasonably<br/>accomplish.</p><p>&gt; Because making sure the pitch bends work properly<br/>&gt; allows for the adaptive tuning and does not represent<br/>&gt; any additional hardware cost. I&apos;m not suggesting that<br/>&gt; it be done to the exclusion of proper short and long<br/>&gt; fixed tuning table support, but this level of control<br/>&gt; is really the only way possible on a standard MIDI<br/>&gt; interface to get adaptive tuning without substantial<br/>&gt; delay -- even the simple 12 note tuning table has delay<br/>&gt; that a great many performers would find totally<br/>&gt; unacceptable. This is avoided using pitch bends which<br/>&gt; add a 1 ms delay to the notes but do so consistently,<br/>&gt; not destroying the groove like erratically interspersed<br/>&gt; tables do.</p><p>Then single note retuning commands would support the adaptive tunings<br/>without the polyphony limitations.</p><p>You might approach the pitch bend request from a non-tuning perspective.<br/>Everybody could benefit from this, as stair stepping is a side effect of<br/>7-8 bit pitch bend resolution and a wide pitch bend range.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps but many manufacturers buy their chips rather<br/>&gt; than roll their own. And in the future we may find all<br/>&gt; synths running standard risc chips anyway.</p><p>Yamaha, Korg, Roland, Emu-Ensoniq and Kurzweil all make their own chips.<br/>Sound card companies may buy their chips rather than roll their own, but<br/>to the best of my knowledge all of these chips have incorporated equal<br/>tempered tuning into the ASICs.  Microtuning won&apos;t be possible with<br/>them.</p><p>&gt; Besides, all the proprietary stuff is patented. Yamaha<br/>&gt; had no fears lending their OS listing for the DX7 to<br/>&gt; Grey Matter Response to add the tuning board add on.</p><p>No, all the proprietary stuff is not patented. It&apos;s too expensive to<br/>patent everything. The Yamaha case you cite happened twenty years ago.</p><p>&gt; Their are significant advantages to opening up the<br/>&gt; architecture. Consider video games. Let others design<br/>&gt; the content, the hardware company just sells the host.</p><p>See Chameleon.</p><p>&gt; Anyway my suggestion only starts at the level of a<br/>&gt; plugin supporting midi filtering through the vst<br/>&gt; interface. Allowing vsti instruments would be a nice<br/>&gt; next step and I think this sort of thing will happen in<br/>&gt; the future but for the tuning stuff only need access to<br/>&gt; the midi stream.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They will not release developer kits because this implies<br/>&gt; &gt; support of a tool that they have no resources to support.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not necessarily -- can let it out there as is without<br/>&gt; support. Some sound card manufacturers have done such a<br/>&gt; thing and created thriving add on development<br/>&gt; communities.</p><p>The sound card market is much different from hardware synthesizers. In<br/>any case, note that no current sound card supports microtuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Finally, they will not re-architect their entire synth/MIDI<br/>&gt; &gt; engine just to accommodate requests from microtonalists.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We might as well give up now! Tuning support is jsut<br/>&gt; too hard!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why be so pessimisitic? Is this a wish list or not?</p><p>So for me the glass is half empty and for you it is half full.  :-)</p><p>An ideal wish list, free of all constraints, would be an excellent idea.<br/>That&apos;s not my list.  Mine takes into account both perspectives, the<br/>microtonalist and the manufacturer.  It takes into account my knowledge<br/>of how these instruments are built, as well as the business behind them.<br/>Perhaps I could add one more advanced list considering the growing<br/>popularity of software synthesizers and their open ended nature.</p><p>If you really want microtuning support, what we need are more well-known<br/>microtonalists such as Wendy Carlos or Robert Rich selling thousands of<br/>CDs.  Synth manufacturers have responded to the<br/>dance/house/trance/techo/rap crowd with instruments that serve these<br/>needs.  They won&apos;t spend hundreds of people-hours developing microtonal<br/>support if they believe there will be no significant adder to sales for<br/>this effort. There&apos;s more than just making the request, we have to make<br/>it worthwhile for them to add these features.</p><p>&gt; Well, the lowest possible impact is certainly no tuning<br/>&gt; support...</p><p>Exactly, and by making high impact requests of hardware manufacturers<br/>that is exactly what we will get.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>jloffink@...</p></div><h3><a id=3163 href="#3163">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 2:40:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;John Loffink&quot; &lt;jloffink@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure why +-100 cent tuning implies 1 cent resolution.</p><p>it doesn&apos;t, but at least one intelligent person did get confused . . .</p><p>perhaps if you wrote +-100.000 cent instead, it would avoid any<br/>further confusion on this point . . .</p></div>
