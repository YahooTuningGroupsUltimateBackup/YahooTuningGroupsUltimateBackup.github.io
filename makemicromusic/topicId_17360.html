It starts on E because with this<br/>base tone, I can (or... well... let&apos;s say, I am practicing to) play a<br/>near-5edo scale on the harmonica, which I am planning to use.</p><p>Sound: simple csound instrument - a sample of my feet walking up a<br/>staircase, sent through a bandpass filter, with 2 parameters: cutoff<br/>frequency (determining the audible pitch) and band width.<br/>The melody is generated from orbits of two-dimensional affine<br/>transformations in Z5xZ5 - like I had done in my<br/>piece &quot;Asimchomsaia&quot;; this time, however, the transformations are not<br/>in the pitch/time space, but in the pitch/bandwidth space (hence some<br/>kind of what Linas Plankis called &quot;two-dimensional tuning&quot;...).<br/>I am, BTW, planning to add some more orbits to make the piece longer.</p><p>Here is a very rough pre-version of how the whole thing could sound<br/>(harmonica still missing):</p><p><a href="http://homepage.hispeed.ch/hsstraub/musik/5stomp_preversion_2.mp3">http://homepage.hispeed.ch/hsstraub/musik/5stomp_preversion_2.mp3</a></p><p>- but maybe you got better ideas!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2007 12:59:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/5/07, daniel_anthony_stearns &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; should anyone want to send me any mps via my mail or you-send-it or<br/>&gt; whatnot and whatever, with the idea that i&apos;d add to it and assemble<br/>&gt; them into something (hopefully) almost cool---i&apos;m up for it. I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; assure the results won&apos;t repulse ,but i am quite comfortable working as<br/>&gt; a doctor Mixenstein stitching together bits of this and that.<br/>&gt; Anyway.......what i&apos;d hope for would be as simple --i.e, one instrument<br/>&gt; recording at a time, and i&apos;m open for any instruments....even 100<br/>&gt; guitars. So, let me know it this seems remotely interesting to<br/>&gt; anyone..could take many directions or none at all, but it will<br/>&gt; mostlikely be not quite normal (i also like the idea of them being<br/>&gt; standards for the disassembling and reanimating......ok, let me know!<br/>&gt; daniel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a></p><p>Well, since my fretless bass is in disrepair, and I don&apos;t have a real keyboard, there&apos;s not much I can do... but you *could* send me an mp3 of a track and I could put vocals to it, as long as it&apos;s rock, soul, blues, country, that sort of thing. I&apos;ve got basic sound recording and processing equipment on the computer, and little else.</p><p>(I&apos;m working on getting back in the Austin music scene after a long hiatus. I need to get that bass fixed REAL soon.)</p><p>~D.</p></div>
