Over the course of a few years she worked quite a bit<br/>deriving musical materials (microtonal) from DNA and RNA sequences.<br/>While she hasn&apos;t been on-list for a long time, her site still seems to<br/>be accessible and there are a good number of pieces to listen to<br/>and/or download. I know she has at least one CD that was available at<br/>one time.</p><p><a href="http://www.elucida.com/">http://www.elucida.com/</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=19142 href="#19142">ðŸ”—</a>robert thomas martin &#x3C;robertthomasmartin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2008 11:17:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    There was talk recently of the relationship between light/sound<br/>frequencies.

There are free downloads of music software involving<br/>DNA plus other things at Algorithmic Arts which can be used to make<br/>microtonal music. This freeware appears to be quite sophisticated in<br/>some ways.</p></div>
