I&apos;ll work on converting Quadra, but here is the &quot;Alltheworst&quot; scale in<br/>&gt; Scl format.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! E:\bad.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; badscale<br/>&gt;   7<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;   1067/1000<br/>&gt;   117/100<br/>&gt;   59/40<br/>&gt;   823/500<br/>&gt;   347/200<br/>&gt;   909/500<br/>&gt;   2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll re-post both the Scala files to the file section soon as work.  For the<br/>&gt; record, although when I first made &quot;Pentra&quot; I thought it was a<br/>&gt; stronger/more-stable scale, upon looking back several independent times I&apos;m<br/>&gt; pretty sure &quot;Quadra&quot; is the stronger scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So I think comparing Quadra and The Bad Scale is a good analysis of &quot;stable<br/>&gt; vs. unstable high-limit scales&quot;...because both contain tons of similarly<br/>&gt; high-limit and un-12TET-like ratios...but<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A) Quadra focuses on using  my more favorite sets of the higher IE 9 and<br/>&gt; 11-limit ratios and imperfect-fifths...<br/>&gt; A2) &quot;badscale&quot; focuses on my least favorite of the higher-limit dyads.  Even on<br/>&gt; the rare occasions it hits a 7-limit dyad IE the 2 or 7/6&apos;s in the entire scale<br/>&gt; from any root, it makes the fifths around it bad enough to kill any sense of<br/>&gt; consonance (hopefully).<br/>&gt; B1) Quadra focuses or arranging the higher-limit ratios in an order so they<br/>&gt; align with the few lower-limit ratios in the scale to produce passable chords..<br/>&gt; B2).&quot;Badscale&quot; focussed on making sure any possible triads contain one to no<br/>&gt; decently low-limit dyads in possible triads to ensure chaos. :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     My &quot;other&quot; question is....how does my &quot;badscale&quot; compare in listening tests<br/>&gt; to, say, a scale based on the &quot;golden mediant&quot; method of achieving maximum<br/>&gt; dissonance?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
