I know someone<br/>looking for one , (others might be interested too).<br/>BTW i really like Boulez as a conductor, I have been impressed every time i<br/>have seem him conduct also.<br/>His own music i have found rather uneventful but i can only imagine what he<br/>would say about mine.<br/>I guess,  he like Breton (who i really think is a great poet regardless what<br/>even his translators say) finds that there own vision can&apos;t include others,<br/>both aesthetic monotheist. Breton went to the point where every single<br/>person besides himself was no longer a surrealist! He kicked them all out!</p><p>clumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2001 8:10:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Carl!<br/>&gt;     Could you send me a link or info on the tuner you use.</p><p><a href="http://www.petersontuners.com/">http://www.petersontuners.com/</a></p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2001 8:21:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And the place to get &apos;em, or anything related to acoustic<br/>pianos for that matter, is:</p><p><a href="http://www.pianomart.com/">http://www.pianomart.com/</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
