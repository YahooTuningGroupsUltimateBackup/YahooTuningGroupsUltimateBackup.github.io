That includes all VST and RTAS (digi) format, and its<br/>what you will be using.</p><p>On a Mac you have to assign the extra memory to each program.<br/>Highlight your Cubasis VST, then hit command-I.  You will see how<br/>much memory is currently assigned to the program.  With 576 I&apos;d give<br/>it about 200, leaving you plenty of meomory to run other stuff.  If<br/>yo can&apos;t run all the plugins you want you would try increasing that<br/>number, remembering that any concurrent programs you are running will<br/>have less avaiolable memory.</p><p>ProTools 5.1 now lets me run RTAS native format with the TDM, which<br/>means the more memory I give it the more plugins I can run<br/>simultaneously without having to commit by bouncing.  And at 69<br/>dollars for 512mb that is a whole lot cheaper than another<br/>proprietary mix TDM card.  And as computers get faster and memory<br/>gets cheaper it makes native format much more attractive than TDM.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
