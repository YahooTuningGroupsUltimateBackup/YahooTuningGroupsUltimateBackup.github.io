This contrast with the<br/>fifthtone technique of Nicola Vicentino in the mid-16th century, who<br/>generally prefers to avoid such intervals in _vertical_ sonorities<br/>(although they occur melodically in his music), might reflect the<br/>freer and indeed often audacious cultivation of various forms of<br/>dissonance around 1600.</p><p>While Carpenter suggests a possible association of this piece with the<br/>Portuguese composer and theorist Vicente Lusitano, noted for his<br/>victory over Vicentino in a judged disputation (1551) as to the nature<br/>of the genera, the general style suggests to me the period around<br/>1600 -- for example, the expressively chained dissonances. Someone<br/>specializing in Iberian and other keyboard music of the 16th and early<br/>17th centuries might offer a more informed opinion.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s a pleasure to offer a rendition of this likely fifthtone<br/>composition made with Aaron&apos;s versatile et_compose.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
