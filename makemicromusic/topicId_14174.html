The the chromatic figure in the middle<br/>voice of C/|\-D-D/|\ divides a usual 208-cent whole-tone into steps of<br/>about 149.512 cents and 58.680 cents. The vertical interval A/|\-D is<br/>equal to a fourth less this 59-cent step, or a near-9:7; and A-G/|\ to a<br/>minor seventh less this step, or a just 12:7 (around 933 cents).</p><p>That should give a general idea of what&apos;s going on -- more below.</p><p>Hudson, the &grave;Shurist&apos; scale has its &apos;1/1&apos; (the basis for the cents values<br/>in the pdf file) at C/|\, Scala note number 1 of the usual peprmint.scl<br/>file and also peppermint.txt. We need to do &apos;KEY 1&apos; in Scala to see the<br/>intervals available this note (rather than C), which do include those<br/>specified for the &apos;shurist&apos; set.</p><p>Chris and Hudson, your two questions are closely related, because both,<br/>I&apos;d guess, relate at least in part to the situation when we make a note on<br/>the upper Peppermint 12-note keyboard with a Sagittal /|\ modification our<br/>&apos;1/1&apos; or point of reference. The reason for doing this is precisely that<br/>certain intervals are available (in the desired direction) from a note on<br/>the upper rather than lower keyboard. In &quot;Black Laundry,&quot; these include<br/>the best 9:7 and 12:7 flavors of intervals (with the 12:7 just) and an<br/>ascending 59-cent step (e.g. D-D/|\) for septimal-type cadences.</p><p>In the &apos;shurist&apos; set, these include the near 8:7 (around 229 cents in<br/>Peppermint) and the just 12:7, important ratios in Shaahin&apos;s just tuning,<br/>intervals not listed in peppermint.txt because they are not available<br/>above C (or another note on the lower keyboard).</p><p>Now for the longer discussion:</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>1. Chris&apos;s question on &quot;Black Laundry&quot; naturals<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>Chris asks what the natural sign means in the final cadence of &quot;Black<br/>Laundry,&quot; which is as follows, with middle C here shown as C5 (since<br/>it&apos;s MIDI note 60, five octaves above the lowest C of the MIDI<br/>standard, in a conventional mapping):</p><p>      1    2   3   4   5   6    | 1     2   3   4   5   6 ||<br/>      E/|\6        G6      E/|\6  G/|\6<br/>      C/|\6        D6             D/|\6<br/>      A/|\5                       G/|\5</p><p>I&apos;m going to resist the temptation to write a long essay about the<br/>interpretation of the Sagittal notation signs in JI and Peppermint,<br/>since that&apos;s included as part of the documentation for my archive to<br/>be released in the next day or so, I hope.</p><p>Instead, I&apos;ll simply explain that the &apos;/|\&apos; sign in Peppermint shows<br/>an interval of 58.680 cents, equal to the distance between the two<br/>12-note keyboards. From a keyboardist&apos;s viewpoint, it might be read<br/>simply to say, &quot;Play this note on the upper manual.&quot;</p><p>From another point of view, in Peppermint the &apos;/|\&apos; sign can represent<br/>either of two JI ratios: the &quot;11-diesis&quot; of 33:32 (53.273 cents), its<br/>meaning in Sagittal JI notation; and also the &quot;septimal thirdtone&quot;<br/>much favored by Archytas at 28:27 (62.961 cents).</p><p>Since all three notes of the first sonority A/|\-C/|\-E/|\ are<br/>inflected by a /|\ symbol, the vertical intervals are equivalent to<br/>those of plain A-C-E. In Peppermint, this means a regular minor third<br/>of about 287.713 cents (a bit smaller than 13:11) and regular major<br/>third of about 416.384 cents (a bit smaller than 14:11), with the<br/>outer fifth at 704.096 cents (2.141 cents wide of 3:2).</p><p>Now the middle voice moves chromatically C/|\-D, a step of 149.512<br/>cents (very close to 12:11), going from a regular minor third above<br/>the lowest voice to a large septimal-flavor major third at 437.225<br/>cents, close to 9:7. At the same time, the highest voice moves from<br/>the fifth A/|\-E/|\ to the pure septimal major sixth A/|\-G at 12:7<br/>(933.139 cents), proceeding via a step of 229.033 cents, close to a<br/>large 8:7 tone. Thus we have a vertical sonority of 0-437-933 cents<br/>very close to a just 7:9:12, poised for the usual expansion to fifth<br/>and octave (with the upper voices moving in fourths).</p><p>Then the highest voice adds an embellishment to the expected<br/>resolution expanding stepwise from major sixth to octave by first<br/>momentarily returning to the fifth (G-E/|\), producing a brief<br/>penultimate sonority of A/|\-D-E/|\ (about 0-437-704 cents, with a<br/>pure 7:6 between the upper voices, close to a just 14:18:21). From<br/>here we move to the expected G/|\-D/|\-G/|\.</p><p>Note that in this resolution, the middle voice has an incisive 59-cent<br/>semitone or thirdtone motion (D-D/|\), which could be said here to<br/>represent the septimal thirdtone of 28:27. In other contexts &apos;/|\&apos; can<br/>also have its Sagittal JI meaning of a 33:32 diesis, since in<br/>Peppermint D-G/|\, for example, is the best representation of 11:8<br/>(i.e. 4:3 plus 33:32), here around 554.584 cents).</p><p>Melodically, the middle voice divides the usual tone C/|\-D/|\ at<br/>208.219 cents into an extra large &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; of 149.51 cents<br/>plus a compact 58.680-cent thirdtone, C/|\-D-D/|\, and this is the<br/>kind of thing that happens in the early 14th-century Italian music of<br/>Marchettus of Padua and some others (with the precise intonational<br/>interpretation often debated, and inevitably variable in practice<br/>because the main focus of this practice is free vocal intonation).</p><p>Anyway, there are two quick points to be made. The first is that<br/>treating a note on the _upper_ keyboard as the vertical center or<br/>&quot;final&quot; of the piece (here G/|\) makes possible septimal cadences<br/>where one or more voices move upward by the 58.680-cent thirdtone<br/>step. This makes the notation more visually complex if we follow the<br/>convention (as here) of C on the lower keyboard as the reference, for<br/>example with the regular sonority A/|\-C/|\-E/|\.</p><p>Also, note the usual Peppermint spellings of a near-9:7 major third as<br/>a fourth less the &apos;/|\&apos; thirdtone (here A/|\-D), and of a pure 7:6<br/>minor third as a major second or regular tone plus a &apos;/|\&apos; (D-E/|\).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Hudson&apos;s question on the Peppermint &quot;shurist&quot; tuning set<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hudson observes that some of the intervals in my Peppermint &quot;shurist&quot;<br/>11-note set inspired by Shaahin Mohaajeri&apos;s just tuning dividing a<br/>string length of 120 don&apos;t match the intervals listed in a microabc<br/>tuning reference file with C as the 1/1 -- in contrast to C/|\ here.</p><p>C/|\  C/|||\    E\!!/     E(!)
