And, other interesting music I&apos;ve heard lately: a new CD by Chinese guitarist Xuefei Yang is one of the most beautiful &quot;classical&quot; guitar discs I&apos;ve heard in years (on GSP). Most of the pieces were written for her, and tend to be based around the pentatonic scale, with oriental sounding themes. The pieces are great, she&apos;s got monster chops, but the overall feeling is most important...she has a lot of depth and wisdom in her playing, and it really comes across. And, one of the pieces (by Stephen Funk Pearson) is for prepared guitar, and is very non 12 sounding, a lot of unusual pitches (she uses some sort of split bridge). Of course, Chinese tuning and 12 eq are both 5ths based, so the overall Chinese sound of the music works pretty well in 12...if you like classic guitar style, this woman is really happening.<br/>  Also saw the David Liebman big band the other night, state of the art jazz/contemporary music...a mind blower. Oh yeah, &quot;Oud, The Ancient Lute,&quot; by Mohsin Mohamed (on HMC) is a superb solo ud CD, check it out...best...HHH</p></div>
