I&apos;ve really<br/>learned a great deal from creating in this fashion, and it&apos;s not<br/>something I want to give up.  I will probably continue to create on a<br/>regular basic like this because it&apos;s a good way to stay on form.</p><p>Daily Ambience is available for free on the web at: http://<br/><a href="http://www.cinemavolta.com/daily">www.cinemavolta.com/daily</a></p><p>It is also available as a podcast.
