No doubt one can use 53edo to explore rational<br/>intervals involving factors of 7 or 11, but I am not trying to<br/>explore that here.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to make music that could be better played in just<br/>tuning. Nothing wrong with that, but I want to see what 53edo in<br/>particular can do.</p><p>The difference between just and tempered tuning, as I see it, is in<br/>what happens as one gradually moves, step by step, using the building<br/>block intervals. In just tuning, the exponents on the prime factors<br/>can just keep getting bigger and bigger, and the pitch space will<br/>eventually get filled in by all the subtly different ratios.</p><p>In a tempered tuning, some of the subtlety is tempered out... so<br/>paths that in just tuning would end at subtly different pitches, in<br/>the tempered scale end up at the same place. The fun is to exploit<br/>this.</p><p>My thinking about this is based on Easley Blackwood&apos;s _The Structure<br/>of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_. That&apos;s all way above my head. But<br/>that&apos;s where I got the idea that lots of music isn&apos;t even trying to<br/>be just tuned, but is in fact exploiting the temperament, i.e. the<br/>ambiguity, how one tempered pitch stands for several just pitches.</p><p>In this piece, I am using the fact that, in 53edo, 8 perfect fifths<br/>plus one major third brings one right back to where one started. I<br/>impose a series of key shift to follow that path, to return to the<br/>starting point in a non-trivial loop.</p><p>Another way to think about this... in just tuning, it&apos;s like the<br/>harmonic universe is flat, with as many dimensions as the prime<br/>numbers one is utilizing. This harmonic universe is also infinite.<br/>But in the tempered world, the universe closes back on itself - it&apos;s<br/>like a toroid of some kind. So, for example, in Pythagorean harmony<br/>based on just the primes 2 and 3, temperament closes the series of<br/>fifths into a circle. With the prime factor 5 tossed in the looping<br/>possibilities get more complicated. So I just picked one such loop<br/>that 53edo provides.</p><p>I realize that folks here have thought through these things far more<br/>deeply and extensively than I can fathom... but still, by writing<br/>from my elementary perspective, maybe I can trigger some suitably<br/>elementary feedback!</p><p>Jim</p></div><h3><a id=18231 href="#18231">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2007 6:13:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jim K wrote:</p><p>&gt; My thinking about this is based on Easley Blackwood&apos;s _The Structure &gt; of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_.

I wrote a harmonic progression with a closed loop like that in 15-ET once -- and after discussing it on the tuning list it turned out that it also worked in 22-ET. These days, we&apos;d call it a comma pump in porcupine temperament. 53 is an interesting ET since it belongs to a number of useful temperaments -- in other words, it tempers out a number of small intervals. There&apos;s the well-known schisma (32805/32768) and the somewhat less familiar kleisma (15625/15552), along with combinations of those, but also the Bohlen-Pierce major diesis (3125/3087) and other 7-limit intervals (e.g. 225/224, 4375/4374) in case you ever have an interest in adding the prime factor 7.</p></div><h3><a id=18232 href="#18232">ðŸ”—</a>Jim K &#x3C;kukulaj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2007 6:41:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s the well-known schisma (32805/32768)</p><p>yes, this is exactly the comma I am pumping!
