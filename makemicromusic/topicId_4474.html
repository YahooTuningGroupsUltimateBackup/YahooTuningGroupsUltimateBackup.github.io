Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stan</p><p>I use a Sanderson Accu-Tuner, SAT II available from Inventronics in<br/>Lowell MA. But it&apos;s expensive and has a lot of features special to<br/>the needs of piano tuners (which I am). The Petersons seem to do OK<br/>for people I know, some of them picky engineers.</p><p>Judy</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2003 2:15:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 25/3/03 1:37 pm, Stan Hoffman at stanhoffman@... wrote:</p><p>What are folks using for tuning instruments?

There are several professional piano tuners over there,<br/>and this has been a topic of discussion over there in the past...<br/>Just before you make a final decision...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
