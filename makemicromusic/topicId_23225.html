He only plays in 12 edo and doesn&apos;t use barre chords. I&apos;ve been playing 12 edo bass lines, but I wondered if I could sneak in a few extra notes. The obvious suggestions are 24 edo, or 12 edo with an extra note added a certain amount below each 12 edo note, for example adding notes about 33 cents below 12 edo notes would allow 7/6 just intervals. Could anyone suggest tunings that I could use (of the form 12 edo plus extra notes) that might be particularly effective or fun?</p><p>Part 2: He has also said that he would like to play guitar with some of my songs. I usually play guitar and sing and I don&apos;t use 12 edo if I can avoid it (I like 12 edo, but everyone else where I play usually uses it and I like variety). Should I try to persuade him to play a non 12 edo guitar (I would have to build it myself, but that&apos;s not a problem)? Bearing in mind that he doesn&apos;t use barre chords, which tunings should I suggest he plays in? I think he&apos;d probably find pythagorean intonation easiest (It was the first non 12 edo tuning I used because I found it easier to play than most others and I didn&apos;t have to recompose my songs), but are there other tunings that might be suitable for a musician used to 12 edo?<br/>On stage I usually perform in Pythagorean intonation, quarter comma meantone, 7 edo or 14 edo, but I think I should extend my range. I use these tunings partly because I find them easy and partly because they have been well received by audiences (I usually play to people used to 12 edo).</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2010 12:36:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mark&quot; &lt;mark.barnes3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Part 1: A friend of mine wants me to play bass with his guitar and vocals live on stage.

I think that&apos;s a great approach, especially because the additional notes are pretty far from usual 12-tET notes and are the least likely to clash harmonically.</p><p>To figure out where to put frets, just think of your open strings (EADG), and then work out which notes each additional fret will actually give you.  If you put a quarter-tone fret between the 5th and 6th frets, you get an 11th harmonic for all your open strings, and if you put a -33-cent fret below the 10th fret, you get 7th harmonics for all your open strings.  Then you have to add two more quarter-tone frets and two more -33-cent frets, and you&apos;ll take care of the remaining 8 notes as well.  So a total of 6 additional frets gives you 24 additional notes!</p><p>&gt; Part 2: He has also said that he would like to play guitar with some of my songs.

You can tune all the open strings 480 cents apart from each other and span 2 octaves perfectly.  Scales are made dead-simple by this approach, and the 3rds are quite nice (especially the 320-cent minor third).  The fifth&apos;s a little iffy, but no more so than 14-EDO and most people aren&apos;t bothered by it.  The only place 15-EDO really gets weird is in the 2nds and 7ths, also--there&apos;s two types of &quot;major&quot; 2nd at 160 and 240 cents, and two types of minor 7th at 960 and 1040 cents, but that shouldn&apos;t be a problem.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
