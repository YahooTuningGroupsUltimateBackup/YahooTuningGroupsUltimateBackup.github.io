I second the comments about this one having more space, and<br/>&gt; &gt; using more time to develop.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s just differently purposed; intended to be slow and spacious.</p><p>What is important to me is that this highlights something Carl mentioned (though I don&apos;t share his entire view) about the difficulty of commenting on artistic works as opposed to commentary on factual matters. In this instance, I didn&apos;t mean to use the comment as a &quot;better than&quot; one, but it points out the importance of both care in our comments as well as accepting input in an open way.</p><p>I figure this: when people post music/links to MMM, they are part of a group who share the common interest in music made in new ways, and they are not only looking to gather perspective, but anticipate supportive (even if critical) feedback.</p><p>And on just one related moment, I had a cringe of recognition when Aaron mentioned that he hoped he wasn&apos;t dogged by his piece &quot;The Juggler&quot;. During a period where I was doing quite a bit of music for dance companies, I had one piece where everything clicked. People used that as a touchstone, and it presented some difficulties to me when I wanted to move in other directions (even if they weren&apos;t successful, it seemed important for growth as a writer).</p><p>Aaron, I&apos;m open to *all* your work, as my order at CD Baby will attest...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
