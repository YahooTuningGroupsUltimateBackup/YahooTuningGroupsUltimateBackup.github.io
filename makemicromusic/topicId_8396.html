I have some questions and comments.</p><p>----</p><p>Hey, that cantor program seems pretty cool for making German-style<br/>techno (which I can dig)! But I think that it might sound a little<br/>better if I just used the Macintosh voice program from my old Quadra<br/>610 and performed pitch-shift on it. It would also be 350 euro<br/>cheaper.<br/>(But that phoneme editor looks sweeeet...)</p><p>----</p><p>A question about CSOUND:<br/>Can anyone gimme the basics? ie, Do I need to already have a C<br/>compiler etc. before being able to use it? Would it work for Macs? Is<br/>it all free? I&apos;m just getting into programming again, and I love it.<br/>Well, that was more like four questions.</p><p>----</p><p>What makes .ogg unique? I&apos;m having some trouble downloading .ogg files<br/>for some reason. I get an error message that the file is corrupted.<br/>Advise?</p><p>----</p><p>George:</p><p>Your knowledge of your field is extensive, and your experience is<br/>undisputable (_not_ that I was trying to dispute). Your arguments<br/>prove very convincing, especially through your references.</p><p>Just from reading your posts it is clear that the general keyboard has<br/>huge potential and would be a fast learn.</p><p>Because of this and much, much more, I am certain that I will try the<br/>hex-style keyboard at some point. Perhaps I will like it so much I<br/>will convert full-time to it. But that is yet to be fully determined.<br/>I&apos;m still young (and foolish) and I&apos;ve got so much to learn. Even<br/>though -- no, ESPECIALLY since I am just starting to touch this field<br/>of music, I am trying to maintain my adventursome spirit --- I am a<br/>guy who likes to design, build, try, fail, and experience the whole<br/>creation process step by step for some projects. Only when I do that<br/>for the first time do I feel I have the tools to advance (whether or<br/>not it&apos;s true), and an inspirational base on which to build.</p><p>A lot of this probably doesn&apos;t make much sense ... I&apos;m not as eloquent<br/>as many on this forum. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I<br/>don&apos;t at all judge the accuracy of your statements, nor your personal<br/>experience -- those are obviously strong. And I would love to give the<br/>general keyboard a spin, many spins. In time. But my heart is pulling<br/>me along a different path (gag me with a metaphor), and so is<br/>Igliason&apos;s (he is a VERY different person from most).</p><p>Point is, we&apos;re going to try out KB#2 first. I&apos;m a slow-moving person,<br/>and I&apos;m not concerned if I waste a few months (or even a couple of<br/>years) on a project I&apos;m passionate about. As long as it will give me<br/>microtones and I build it, I will like it.</p><p>-Please, post as many links as you find suitable to recordings of your<br/>compositions &amp; performances, images of your instruments, and anything<br/>else that can demonstrate the points you make, so that I and everyone<br/>else on the forum can appreciate them. Thanks.</p><p>----</p><p>Gordon:<br/>You said,<br/>&quot;The neutral is not the purist thing, it is the emptiest thing.&quot;<br/>Does that include the neutral second and third intervals?<br/>Ha ha ha. *smack*</p><p>(Also, you mentioned that there was just too much good stuff on TV as<br/>a<br/>reason for Americans not getting out and seeking good culture. Which<br/>channels? Can you recommend any good shows? I still get cable for now!<br/>Ha ha again.)</p><p>----</p><p>Christopher Bailey:<br/>Well, I didn&apos;t shit a brick at that Mahler album, but that&apos;s only<br/>because I haven&apos;t eaten one lately. I think that I may have, though...<br/>Anyone who didn&apos;t yet, I highly suggest checking it out&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000</a><br/>007RYQ/qid=1104883543/sr=8-1/r\<br/>ef=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl15/103-9210165-4355813?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846</p><p>----</p><p>Statistics update: Accordion Wars<br/>Number of posts replied to my original message &quot;MIDI links, creating a<br/>microtonal keyboard, new soundclick profile&quot;:<br/>28 and counting<br/>Posts related to original topic<br/>2 of 28<br/>Alright!
