You can check, e.g.,</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76190">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76190</a> <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76549">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76549</a></p><p>and the follow-up messages.</p><p>But you can also play microtonal scales on a standard MIDI keyboard - this is actually how I am doing it currently. All you need is a synthesizer, expander or software synthesizer that supports retuning. Nowadays many synthesizers support this; you can get information about his on <a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com</a> .</p><p>Welcome on this list and good luck!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3>alobare &#x3C;alobare@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2011 6:21:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Hans,<br/>thanks for your hints regarding my question about microtonal synthesizer, I will look in detail the messages....<br/>----<br/>reinHOLD</p></div>
