Then again, I wouldn&apos;t say 9TET or even 7TET (mentioned on Tony Dubshot&apos;s page) are really the most realistic tunings to start writing anything both fully polyphonic and easy to listen to in): the temptation to get around the &quot;unpopular&quot; levels of dissonance by making smaller or less chords is too great.  To me if someone&apos;s playing around only with small TET scales, they aren&apos;t getting a fair palette of colors to paint with.<br/>    I would really like to see what someone like Tony could do if you handed him, say, Erv Wilson&apos;s 6-tone MOS scales, Ozan&apos;s &quot;polyphonic Maqam&quot; scales, BP (telling him to also use only instruments like flutes with lots of odd harmonics to match it, of course), or (dare I go promo here) my Ptolemic-ratio-based scales (all built for polyphony and all very different from 12TET).</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22294 href="#22294">ðŸ”—</a>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2010 2:49:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael&gt; &quot;I guess one question I have is...does music have to be so minimalist to be considered &quot;popular micro-tonal&quot;...or are there any artists from the label who focus a lot on chords larger than triads and the occasional 4-tone chord?&quot;</p><p>Of course it doesn&apos;t have to be so minimalist. In these early days it&apos;s just me and Tony on the label, and you should know better from all our conversations that first and foremost I&apos;m making music for my own enjoyment (to please my own ear), not to hit targets such as &quot;use more than 4 tones in a chord.&quot; Tony would probably agree with this regarding his own music.

On the side, I fear micro-tonalists are often interpreted by the public as too busy basking in their avant-garde glory to take virtually any notice of what the public wants...and though I&apos;d hate for micro-tonal music to become &quot;like MTV&quot; (the other extreme), I&apos;d love to smash that stereotype.</p><p>  I&apos;ve asked people what they think micro-tonal means and they say<br/>something like &quot;oh, you mean that classical Arabic/Indian stuff&quot; and<br/>sometimes also &quot;...that&apos;s largely monophonic with a few typical<br/>chromatic scale chords backing it up&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It&apos;s (thankfully) not what I insist on at all...

It&apos;s fair to say I have a second, more political side that just wants to find and make songs that prove micro-tonality can do things the general public has long sworn it can&apos;t.<br/>   Actually...same goes with beats.  In my contribution (both for my own enjoyment and proof-of-concept) I consistently move both kick drums and snares on off beats so the beat is in constant rotation.  There&apos;s no boom-click-boom (techno-like) or boom-snare-(pause)-snare (rock-like) or click-click-click(de)click (jazz like)...nothing metronome-esque.  Here I&apos;m trying to prove the concept that a steady beat with at least one drum repeating on metronome-type timings is the only way to provide a steady and confident sense of energy.  (Sevish) it&apos;s funny because (hey maybe you just like that sound?)...but I can&apos;t help to think there&apos;s at least a bit of politics in some of the avant-garde meters you use for your drum-lines...and successfully tricked me into, say, thinking your Amen loop was not custom-made by doing so cleverly. ;-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you wanted to make a chord progression for me, maybe in one of your<br/>great new tunings, maybe a melody too (or not), I&apos;d love to remix it!&quot;<br/>  Sounds great and will do gladly.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22298 href="#22298">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2010 12:15:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I can&apos;t resist throwing my 2&cent;-worth of kindling on this little fire.</p><p>&gt;    To me more maximalistic micro-tonal music forces people to use the advanced chords &gt;of micro-tonal scales while more minimalistic allows musicians to make songs &gt;sound/feel more like 12TET with micro-tones only acting as decorations (yet, to many &gt;people I&apos;m sure, that approach makes things sound more normal and accessible).</p><p>While I do agree that there is an unfortunate glut of near-monophonic microtonal music that sounds nearly indistinct from 12-tET, and that triadic harmony is generally more accessible than hexadic, I must strongly disagree that microtonal music based on hexadic harmony is more distinct-sounding from 12-tET than microtonal music based on triadic harmony.</p><p>The more non-unison voices you have in a chord, the less distinct of an identity that chord will have when compared to other chords composed of the same number of voices. It&apos;s the law of diminishing returns, really.  So of course if the average listener has trouble distinguishing hexads in 12-tET, they&apos;ll obviously have trouble distinguishing a hexad in 12-tET from a hexad in 31-tET.  Odds are their ear will &quot;split the difference&quot; or &quot;round to the nearest familiar interval&quot; and they will react indistinguishably on an emotional level.</p><p>Now, suppose you have a hexad composed mostly of unfamiliar intervals--the average listener&apos;s ear seems to &quot;give up&quot; trying to parse the sonic information and the result is that the chord is interpreted as &quot;a cloud of sound&quot;.  Sure, clouds come in different shapes, and you can distinguish a big puffy cloud from a long streaky cloud, but these are fuzzier distinctions than distinguishing, say, a circle from a square.  Hence, a 31-tET cloud will be tricky to distinguish from a 19-tET cloud, or from a 5-limit JI cloud; or a cloud in 16-EDO will be hard to distinguish from a cloud in 14-EDO.  It&apos;s the same trouble one encounters when making atonal music--atonal Bohlen-Pierce might as well be atonal 12-tET to all but the most evolved and educated ears.</p><p>In my experience, the best way to get music that is noticeably distinct from 12-tET and is NOT merely &quot;microtonal decoration&quot; is to use a combination of unfamiliar tonal structures and/or non-Pythagorean harmony.  The Blackwood Decatonic scale in 15-EDO can sound QUITE far from 12-tET even with basic 5-limit triadic harmony, owing to the lack of a true whole-tone with which to construct melodies.  The ssLsssL &quot;anti-major&quot; scale of 16-EDO sounds about as far from 12-tET as you can get, even having very similar nominally-5-limit triads.  I frankly can&apos;t imagine anyone hearing music in those scales as 12-tET with &quot;microtonal decoration&quot;.  Even blurred by the dubby effects, I think Tony Dubshot&apos;s scales stand out as being quite distinct from 12-tET, precisely because they are NOT buried beneath a cloud of complex harmonies, and thus the unusual macrotonal melodies and harmonies are made more apparent.</p><p>I do agree with you that some styles of music reach their maximum potential with hexadic microtonal harmony--but it is a gross overstatement to dismiss microtonal music that relies on &quot;minimalist&quot; triadic harmony as &quot;not living up to the potential&quot; of microtonal music.  I do share your frustration with the state of microtonal music in general--I feel like no one&apos;s really opened it up and started to truly tap the potential.  But I see the short-comings not as a lack of harmonic complexity but rather as a lack of emotional relevance: if it doesn&apos;t MOVE me, I could give a flying you-know-what about how complex or intricate it is.  Not to say that I can&apos;t be moved by complexity or that minimalism is more emotionally-relevant: both can be equally effective or equally lifeless.  It just has to come from the heart and aim for the heart--too much &quot;mind&quot; is the typical problem.<br/>&gt; Carl&gt;&quot;It&apos;s already half way there with the synth work.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Fans are used to listening to _sounds_.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Indeed very odd timbres are already commonplace in electronica...when you program, say, a subtractive analog synthesizer it in no way aligns your sounds to harmonic overtones and many very talented electronica groups IE Way Out West even admit in interviews to things like using off-key chord samples and tuning them in such a way to minimize average dissonance...so, in a way, they are already practicing micro-tonality.

It&apos;s the law of diminishing returns, really.&quot;<br/>    I know it sure is a case of &quot;diminishing returns&quot; within typical 7-note scale use in 12TET.  With 12TET (so I&apos;ve heard and experienced via composing) tonal variety increases up to about a 5-note &quot;jazz&quot; chord, then goes down as you realize how few 6-note chords are available the don&apos;t clash to the point of having little tonal identity.</p><p>  Meanwhile with micro-tonal I&apos;ve found, with a little multiple octave separation to loosen things, huge harmonies are possible without worrying about things like &quot;adding this note will make other notes out of tune and thus limit the number of consonant and distinct-sounding chords I can make with x number of tones&quot;.<br/>-----------------<br/>  A counter-proof of the &quot;diminishing returns&quot; (especially for over 5-note chords) concept is a tricky thing, but if/once you hear my song/entry in Sevish&apos;s compilation CD I think it will make more sense.<br/>-----------------</p><p>   A second note...I said in my reply to Sevish that there was no real need to go beyond 4-note chords to &quot;prove&quot; how well micro-tonal music can work in true.  I merely said I like to use 6+ note chords because it leads to a vast harmonic feel I&apos;ve found virtually impossible to imitate with 12TET and indirectly seems to throw a huge cog in the face of those who think micro-tonal has to be mono-phonic.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Now, suppose you have a hexad composed mostly of unfamiliar<br/>intervals--the average listener&apos;s ear seems to &quot;give up&quot; trying to<br/>parse the sonic information and the result is that the chord is<br/>interpreted as &quot;a cloud of sound&quot;.<br/>    This does happen if either the intervals (critical band dissonance) or overtones (periodic/&quot;JI&quot; dissonance) are too close and &quot;fight for space&quot;.  The scale I used in my compilation song, for example, for the most part avoids both of these issues...largely in part by avoiding the near-mean-tone type methods used in Western tunings, which often ends up favoring larger intervals over smaller ones and includes the tiny &quot;half-step&quot;, which violates critical band dissonance to death and causes a lot of this &quot;clouding&quot; in things like 13th chords.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So of course if the average listener has trouble distinguishing hexads<br/>in 12-tET, they&apos;ll obviously have trouble distinguishing a hexad in<br/>12-tET from a hexad in 31-tET.&quot;<br/>   IMVHO, if someone is building a scale that has only the same type of interval structures available in 12TET, there&apos;s not that much &quot;new&quot; about the scale at all.  You seem to be agreeing with me there is too much micro-tonal music that sounds indistinct from 12TET and then saying &quot;what applies to 12TET, especially with regards to &apos;tonal clouding&apos; must apply to all other scales&quot;...it sounds like a basic self-contradiction, at least on the surface.<br/>   Easy example, what if the &quot;hexad&quot; I&apos;m making in a micro-tonal scale has all intervals drastically different from those in 12TET (IE many of them being 20+ cents wide or narrow of 12TET)?  Maybe I&apos;m making a 12:13:15:18:21:26 chord...and the closest thing to 13/12 in 12TET is around 9/8 or 15/14.  I&apos;m pretty sure people could hear the difference loud and clear.  Academically I also find it an interesting challenge to make huge chords that work as I know any of a huge chord&apos;s subsets can be broken into several more layers of chords that are guaranteed to also work.</p><p>&gt;&quot;but it is a gross overstatement to dismiss microtonal music that relies<br/>on &quot;minimalist&quot; triadic harmony as &quot;not living up to the potential&quot; of<br/>microtonal music.&quot;<br/>    That sounds like a gross mis-statement of what I said (or at least meant to say).  I said the potential I was discussing was that of polyphony and the purpose of &quot;proving&quot; just how much that&apos;s now &quot;tonally illegal&quot; could be made legal (and consonant in that sense!) using micro-tonal polyphony in the face of the sadly popular idea that micro-tonality &quot;is really just for monophonic music&quot;.<br/>    There is a good deal of great micro-tonal music floating around...just not much that says &quot;this shows very consonant chords impossible with 12TET&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In my experience, the best way to get music that is noticeably distinct<br/>from 12-tET and is NOT merely &quot;microtonal decoration&quot; is to use a<br/>combination of unfamiliar tonal structures and/or non-Pythagorean<br/>harmony.&quot;<br/>   Exactly.  My favorite is &quot;Ptolemic&quot;...but I&apos;ve heard harmony from things like Wilson&apos;s 6-tone MOS scales and octa-tonic scales under 22TET which have a similar effect.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The Blackwood Decatonic scale in 15-EDO can sound QUITE far from 12-tET<br/>even with basic 5-limit triadic harmony, owing to the lack of a true<br/>whole-tone with which to construct melodies.&quot;<br/>   I&apos;ll say this much, the type of music you seem to be focused on seems to be a great example of how to prove the value of distinct-sounding micro-tonal melody.  Yet I&apos;m talking about micro-tonal harmony/polyphony.

The scale I used in my compilation song, for example, for the most part avoids both of these issues...largely in part by avoiding the near-mean-tone type methods used in Western tunings, which often ends up favoring larger intervals over smaller ones and includes the tiny &quot;half-step&quot;, which violates critical band dissonance to death and causes a lot of this &quot;clouding&quot; in things like 13th chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;So of course if the average listener has trouble distinguishing hexads<br/>&gt; in 12-tET, they&apos;ll obviously have trouble distinguishing a hexad in<br/>&gt; 12-tET from a hexad in 31-tET.&quot;<br/>&gt;    IMVHO, if someone is building a scale that has only the same type of interval structures available in 12TET, there&apos;s not that much &quot;new&quot; about the scale at all.

I got kind of a &quot;well it&apos;s nice but it&apos;s failing to meet the potential of microtonal music&quot; message from it, as well as a &quot;because it lacks complex harmony, it sounds too close to 12-tET&quot; message.  Perhaps you didn&apos;t mean that.</p><p>At any rate, I&apos;m very much interested to hear your piece!  If you have found a microtonal scale which can make hexads sound as identifiable and distinct as triads, that will blow my mind...especially if you can take a progression of those hexads and play a powerful melody over it!   But I was certainly not talking only about harmonies which are close to 12-tET having a sound-cloud problem.  I had to rewrite that response because Yahoo logged me out while writing my first one and it vanished when I had to re-log in to post it.  In my original, I mentioned an example of me playing some harmonic-series pentads (specifically 4:7:9:11:13) in both JI and 17-EDO for various audiences, expecting a stunned reaction at the unfamiliar harmony and instead getting an &quot;it sounds like you&apos;re just mashing piano keys&quot; reaction.  I can&apos;t imagine a pentad further from 12-tET than 4:7:9:11:13.  It has been my experience that the more complex and the more unfamiliar the harmony being employed in a microtonal scale, the less the average listener can distinguish it from 12-tET--ESPECIALLY if the intervals being used are QUITE different from 12-tET.  So I will be VERY interested to see what you can do with these scales you&apos;re working with!  Maybe you&apos;ll get me interested in some of them.</p><p>But indeed, this is an issue that can ONLY be settled with music, so I&apos;m gonna shut up with the words now.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;While I do agree that there is an unfortunate glut of near-monophonic<br/>&gt; microtonal music that sounds nearly indistinct from 12-tET&quot;<br/>&gt; Indeed...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I must<br/>&gt; strongly disagree that microtonal music based on hexadic harmony is<br/>&gt; more distinct-sounding from 12-tET than microtonal music based on<br/>&gt; triadic harmony.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The more non-unison voices you have in a chord, the less distinct of an<br/>&gt; identity that chord will have when compared to other chords composed of<br/>&gt; the same number of voices.

It&apos;s the law of diminishing returns, really.&quot;<br/>&gt;     I know it sure is a case of &quot;diminishing returns&quot; within typical 7-note scale use in 12TET.  With 12TET (so I&apos;ve heard and experienced via composing) tonal variety increases up to about a 5-note &quot;jazz&quot; chord, then goes down as you realize how few 6-note chords are available the don&apos;t clash to the point of having little tonal identity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Meanwhile with micro-tonal I&apos;ve found, with a little multiple octave separation to loosen things, huge harmonies are possible without worrying about things like &quot;adding this note will make other notes out of tune and thus limit the number of consonant and distinct-sounding chords I can make with x number of tones&quot;.<br/>&gt; ------------ -----<br/>&gt;   A counter-proof of the &quot;diminishing returns&quot; (especially for over 5-note chords) concept is a tricky thing, but if/once you hear my song/entry in Sevish&apos;s compilation CD I think it will make more sense.<br/>&gt; ------------ -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    A second note...I said in my reply to Sevish that there was no real need to go beyond 4-note chords to &quot;prove&quot; how well micro-tonal music can work in true.  I merely said I like to use 6+ note chords because it leads to a vast harmonic feel I&apos;ve found virtually impossible to imitate with 12TET and indirectly seems to throw a huge cog in the face of those who think micro-tonal has to be mono-phonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Now, suppose you have a hexad composed mostly of unfamiliar<br/>&gt; intervals--the average listener&apos;s ear seems to &quot;give up&quot; trying to<br/>&gt; parse the sonic information and the result is that the chord is<br/>&gt; interpreted as &quot;a cloud of sound&quot;.<br/>&gt;     This does happen if either the intervals (critical band dissonance) or overtones (periodic/&quot;JI&quot; dissonance) are too close and &quot;fight for space&quot;.  The scale I used in my compilation song, for example, for the most part avoids both of these issues...largely in part by avoiding the near-mean-tone type methods used in Western tunings, which often ends up favoring larger intervals over smaller ones and includes the tiny &quot;half-step&quot;, which violates critical band dissonance to death and causes a lot of this &quot;clouding&quot; in things like 13th chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;So of course if the average listener has trouble distinguishing hexads<br/>&gt; in 12-tET, they&apos;ll obviously have trouble distinguishing a hexad in<br/>&gt; 12-tET from a hexad in 31-tET.&quot;<br/>&gt;    IMVHO, if someone is building a scale that has only the same type of interval structures available in 12TET, there&apos;s not that much &quot;new&quot; about the scale at all.  You seem to be agreeing with me there is too much micro-tonal music that sounds indistinct from 12TET and then saying &quot;what applies to 12TET, especially with regards to &apos;tonal clouding&apos; must apply to all other scales&quot;...it sounds like a basic self-contradiction, at least on the surface.<br/>&gt;    Easy example, what if the &quot;hexad&quot; I&apos;m making in a micro-tonal scale has all intervals drastically different from those in 12TET (IE many of them being 20+ cents wide or narrow of 12TET)?  Maybe I&apos;m making a 12:13:15:18: 21:26 chord...and the closest thing to 13/12 in 12TET is around 9/8 or 15/14.  I&apos;m pretty sure people could hear the difference loud and clear.  Academically I also find it an interesting challenge to make huge chords that work as I know any of a huge chord&apos;s subsets can be broken into several more layers of chords that are guaranteed to also work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;but it is a gross overstatement to dismiss microtonal music that relies<br/>&gt; on &quot;minimalist&quot; triadic harmony as &quot;not living up to the potential&quot; of<br/>&gt; microtonal music.&quot;<br/>&gt;     That sounds like a gross mis-statement of what I said (or at least meant to say).  I said the potential I was discussing was that of polyphony and the purpose of &quot;proving&quot; just how much that&apos;s now &quot;tonally illegal&quot; could be made legal (and consonant in that sense!) using micro-tonal polyphony in the face of the sadly popular idea that micro-tonality &quot;is really just for monophonic music&quot;.<br/>&gt;     There is a good deal of great micro-tonal music floating around...just not much that says &quot;this shows very consonant chords impossible with 12TET&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;In my experience, the best way to get music that is noticeably distinct<br/>&gt; from 12-tET and is NOT merely &quot;microtonal decoration&quot; is to use a<br/>&gt; combination of unfamiliar tonal structures and/or non-Pythagorean<br/>&gt; harmony.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Exactly.  My favorite is &quot;Ptolemic&quot;.. .but I&apos;ve heard harmony from things like Wilson&apos;s 6-tone MOS scales and octa-tonic scales under 22TET which have a similar effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The Blackwood Decatonic scale in 15-EDO can sound QUITE far from 12-tET<br/>&gt; even with basic 5-limit triadic harmony, owing to the lack of a true<br/>&gt; whole-tone with which to construct melodies.&quot;<br/>&gt;    I&apos;ll say this much, the type of music you seem to be focused on seems to be a great example of how to prove the value of distinct-sounding micro-tonal melody.  Yet I&apos;m talking about micro-tonal harmony/polyphony.  And I agree: melody can often sound more distinct when harmony is not there to &quot;curve&quot; its sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;But I see the short-comings not as a lack of harmonic complexity but<br/>&gt; rather as a lack of emotional relevance: if it doesn&apos;t MOVE me, I could<br/>&gt; give a flying you-know-what about how complex or intricate it is.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Yet the same could be true of any musical theory IE I could just as easily say &quot;this music has melodies in a scale that really stands out because of it&apos;s lack of a whole-tone in an academic sense, but that doesn&apos;t mean it has any decent emotional content&quot;.  It&apos;s a danger with any genre of music, any scale, any theory, any tempo, any instrumental arrangement, any production technique... it surely isn&apos;t specific to how musicians decide to use or not use larger chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The reason I feel inclined to push the idea of micro-tonal polyphony is to let musicians know &quot;hey guess what...this is an option...while you can happily stay with simple/elegant chords you can also drop in something huge and add a burst of energy without sounding like you dropped a bomb on your listener&apos;s ear drums&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     It just gives more options I figure...of course it&apos;s up to the musician to use those options in a way that hits home emotionally   And the more theoretical options a musician knows they have handy...the more likely it is one of them will nail the emotion they want.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22307 href="#22307">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2010 11:12:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I got kind of a &quot;well it&apos;s nice but it&apos;s failing to meet the potential of microtonal music&quot; message from it&quot;<br/>    Well that is admittedly partly what I meant...on one hand it&apos;s very accomplished as well-produced easy to listen to dub.

Yes, arpeggiation makes a world of difference in intelligibility of extremely-polyphonic chords, though the line there starts to blur between melody and harmony at that point.  Spacing out over multiple octaves also makes a big difference.  If that&apos;s how you approach it, then I am definitely not surprised you&apos;ve had success.  I thought you were advocating using hexads as accompaniment the way triads are used in common-practice, just holding all their notes together under a melody or really banging away at them en bloc.</p><p>At any rate, I think you might want to consider Tony&apos;s music as something other than microtonal...because it&apos;s NOT microtonal, it&apos;s MACROtonal.  Different philosophy entirely, though still distinct from 12.  The point of macrotonality is usually to make harmony simpler, melody more &quot;fool-proof&quot;, and the overall mood often more tropical/exotic.  They obviously shouldn&apos;t be consider an &quot;evolution&quot; of tonal music.</p><p>So, on listening to the tracks you linked to, I think you&apos;ve got a much better touch for this complex-harmony stuff than maybe anyone I&apos;ve heard yet.  The 19-tET piece is actually one of the most compelling uses of that temperament I&apos;ve heard, and I&apos;ve heard a LOT of 19.  Most 19 is either bland 5-limit stuff or microchromatic fidgeting, but this was...emotionally affecting while still being totally new-sounding.  The first part was a bit dissonant, but the later sections really hit something good, especially the part that starts around 2:02.

The more notes you have, the harder it is not to have them set off mines on each other. :-D   Also my experience tells me, most types of TET scales (minus unbearably high TET&apos;s) just don&apos;t have the accuracy to hit scales like the one I use in that song.<br/>&gt;   For your amusement though, here&apos;s an old (admittedly quite dissonant and a bit naive) early attempt of mine to make 8-note scales with 5-6 note chords in 19TET.<br/>&gt;         <a href="http://www.traxinspace.com/song/37440">http://www.traxinspace.com/song/37440</a><br/>&gt;    And a slightly later one along the same lines using 12TET for some parts and micro-tonal scales for others (actually managed to convince some people nothing was &quot;out of tune&quot; in this one somehow)<br/>&gt;        <a href="http://www.traxinspace.com/song/40893">http://www.traxinspace.com/song/40893</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;But indeed, this is an issue that can ONLY be settled with music, so I&apos;m gonna shut up with the words now.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Well, we will see what happens.  :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=22313 href="#22313">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2010 3:38:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot; I got to admit most percussion in pop music is boring to me as<br/>well.&quot;</p><p>    To Jon, Chris, and anyone else with an interest in &quot;quirky but steady&quot; percussion:</p><p>Well here&apos;s a little trick from how I program drums that&apos;s not genre specific at all (although I also love drum&amp;bass style glitch and liquid-cymbal tricks).<br/>  Take a drum and play it, then play it 1/8 note later.  Here your only interval is 1/8, so say you avoid repeating it by playing the drum after another 1/16th note delay.
