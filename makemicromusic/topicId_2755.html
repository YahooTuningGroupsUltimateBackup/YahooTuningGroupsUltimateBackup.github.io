I&apos;ve had the pleasure of &apos;co-producing&apos; a program with the San Diego Symphony with guest artist Steve Schick. Called &quot;Heartbeats of the World&quot;, it is an orchestral and otherwise survey of pulse, rhythm, and all the groove that moves; of sound from percussion that makes one more in tune with the underlying movement that abounds.</p><p>Details are: San Diego Symphony with Steve Schick, Copley Symphony Hall, 7th and B, San Diego, 8:00 pm. One night only...</p><p>Opening with a percussion quartet improvisation that plays off a heartbeat, the concert continues with a wide array of musics: Chavez&apos;s evocative &quot;Sinfonia India&quot;, &quot;Temezcal&quot; for a pair of maracas and taped accompaniement, a world premiere by Ward-Steinman, and more orchestral fare.</p><p>Then the fun starts: after a video featuring Steve, myself, and Jung-Ho Pak (SDS Artistic Director) shot at Home Depot on a search for sounds, Steve and I will perform on instruments I have built from found materials. Seriously microtonal, I&apos;ll be uploading audio and photos later on so you can see that Mom doesn&apos;t offer only lip service to microtones.</p><p>The culmination of the evening is Tan Dun&apos;s extraordinary &quot;Concerto for Water Percussion and Orchestra&quot;, featuring one soloist and two semi-soloists playing an array of percussion instruments in and out of water! We&apos;ve built special basins for performing: clear basins filled with water, lit from inside so that all movements are glowing and illuminated, and mic&apos;ed. Many sections, including Steve&apos;s evocative cadenza, involve simple *playing* the water, rhythmically and elsewise. It is a deeply satisfying experience.</p><p>I&apos;ve spent weeks on this project, compiling, rehearsing, collaborating, and I have to say that up to this point is has been one of the most involving and moving collaborations of my musical life. If any of you can attend, you will feel my joy and humility in the act of causing music to spring to live and love.</p><p>I wish you all the best, and will be more in attendance once the weekend is over.</p><p>Onward and up,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=2761 href="#2761">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2002 12:56:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

He is also the artistic and/or music director of the New Haven Symphony in CT, so be on the look-out for him to have similar innovative programming there (this particular series is called the &quot;Light Bulb&quot; concerts.</p><p>And if *any* of you are ever in striking distance of a performance by Steve Schick (who was a regular and founding member of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, DON&apos;T MISS IT! He is, hands-down, one of the most compelling performers you will ever hear/witness. Seriously!</p><p>I&apos;m going to forward you some more info, off-list...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
