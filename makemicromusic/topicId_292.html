Cardew  and The Scratch Orchestra is probably one of the more<br/>successful attempts at communal music making. The fountainhead of so<br/>much British New music<br/>that is ignored by academia yet fills 70% of your experimental sections<br/>in records stores.</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.

Especially the part about Public Enemy. Kudos for<br/>knowing<br/>a rap act. But c&apos;mon... Public Enemy? That&apos;s sort of... old.</p><p>Granted, they sampled just about everything in sight, and were some of<br/>the<br/>greatest ever (in my opinion), but today, there are a lot of people<br/>going a lot<br/>further with the idea. Try Kid Koala, or Christian Marclay. Very nice<br/>stuff. How<br/>about DJ Smallcock? Also interesting.</p><p>In my mind, sampling (or musical quoting, if you wish) is going to last,<br/>because<br/>people are going to see that it is something that expands musical<br/>possibilites.<br/>Anything that does this generally lasts.</p><p>DaveX</p></div>
