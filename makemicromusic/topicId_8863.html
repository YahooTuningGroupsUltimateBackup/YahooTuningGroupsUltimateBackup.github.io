As a good pianist, I found a more<br/>&gt; direct route to expressive MIDI performances by recording my playing in<br/>&gt; a sequencer and then editing to my satisfaction.</p><p>Yes, and this is a limitation of the Scala files I produce by entering<br/>pitches and note values in Scala, for example: the idea of recording an<br/>actual keyboard performance in MIDI and then editing is something I&apos;d like<br/>to try. With a bit of experimentation, I might also be able to modify some<br/>rhythmic indications in a program like Scala to detach or overlap notes,<br/>and get idiomatic pauses between phrases, for example.</p><p>&gt; Of course, for polyphonic music with vocal ranges that frequently cross<br/>&gt; (as in much pre-Baroque music), it is simplest to enter each line<br/>&gt; separately in the sequencer, and combine &apos;em there.  Then with some<br/>&gt; additional editing, the results are quite good pretty quickly.</p><p>While for only two voices, e.g. a conductus, I sometimes like playing the<br/>two parts on different manuals, which accommodates the crossing nicely<br/>(a neat effect with contrasting timbres), I&apos;d agree that recording layer<br/>by layer gives some neat options -- as well as allowing for my<br/>less-than-ideal keyboard technique &lt;grin&gt;. When trying to play three<br/>parts, say, at once, I tend to disregard the crossing and do a sort of<br/>keyboard reduction, at least to a degree (with a pedal keyboard and<br/>someone skilled enough to use it well, this problem might be alleviated).</p><p>Anyway, you should know that your Willaert _Inviolata_ is a big hit here,<br/>and that I&apos;ve been listening to it lots, for while example while writing<br/>this.</p><p>&gt; One interesting finding, coming from years of piano lessons, was how<br/>&gt; important the release time of notes is to a performance. I had learned<br/>&gt; from the late Detroit Symphony pianist Mischa Kottler that to create a<br/>&gt; &quot;singing tone&quot; on piano, one had to overlap the release of one note with<br/>&gt; the attack of the next. This also makes nice Classical-era 2-note slurs.<br/>&gt; And of course the degree of staccato, if any, also can greatly affect<br/>&gt; the quality of the musical line. These insights have helped bring a lot<br/>&gt; of the life to my MIDI realizations and compositions.</p><p>Yes, and on harpsichord also, the fine points of articulation are very<br/>important -- something I should indeed consider more. Maybe developing my<br/>keyboard technique might suggest ideas for MIDI coding also when I do<br/>approach things algorithmically. (Aaron Johnson has developed some general<br/>routines to get some variation in rhythm, and your remarks raise the<br/>question of refinements, maybe specified or added in manual coding.)</p><p>&gt; Also, for the Willaert at least I gave each voice a separate pan<br/>&gt; position (usually MIDI controller 10) in the virtual stereo space, which<br/>&gt; also aids realism.</p><p>That&apos;s a touch also in line with one side of Willaert&apos;s style: the &quot;split<br/>choir&quot; style later to be so characteristic of Andrea and Giovanni<br/>Gabrielli. While _Inviolata_ seems to me more flowing and contrapuntal<br/>than the more &quot;antiphonal&quot; style, the larger number of voices does invite<br/>the kind of use of &quot;virtual space&quot; that you&apos;ve done so nicely.</p><p>As a fan of quadraphonic surround sound (neat for rounds, for example), I<br/>can appreciate your technique here, which is very nice on earphones.</p><p>&gt; Yours for improved MIDIaphony,<br/>&gt; Harold</p><p>A neat term, MIDIaphony -- and one which your music I&apos;m enjoying neatly<br/>exemplifies.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
