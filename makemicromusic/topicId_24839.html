We like to think of it as dangling a carrot of cash so people can be motivated not just to write microtonal music, but microtonal music that would be attractive to the broadest cross-section of listeners. This is one of the reasons we picked a broad cross-section of judges.

Fundamentally, a piece is judged by how much it excites and/or moves the collective ear of the judges. By nature this is subjective, and collectively so. One hopes that by having a responsible panel of judges of varied tastes and positions in the musical field, a reasonable consensus is reached as to a work&apos;s merit. This is why we chose musicians from different disciplines, who are all exceptional in their fields. We also understand that contestants need to feel confident in the judging, and believe that our choice in judges also addresses this concern.</p><p>For example, we had 4 microtonalists and 3 non-microtonalists on this year&apos;s panel, all of whom are leaders in their field. They range from: Rob Voisey, founder of 60x60, who has heard every compositional trick in the book; to Kraig Grady, well-known and respected composer/performer and instrument maker; to David Schrader, a world-renowned organist and multi-keyboardist; and to Elaine Walker (ZIA), a microtonal space-pop legend. We know they took their responsibilities very seriously, and for this, and for their countless hours of time donated in listening to the submissions, we are very grateful.</p><p>About hosting non-winners: since UnTwelve doesn&apos;t own rights to pieces submitted, we&apos;d have to ask the composers to grant their permission.

I think the tuning is an excellent one with much potential, and I applaud you for passionately searching for scales to create your music in. I enjoyed listening to all the music, and was thrilled to see the creation of so much microtonal music at one time. But for sure, some pieces created more positive impressions than others, which is true for any piece of music and any given listener.</p><p>Let me re-iterate that &quot;exposing the general public to the highest quality work&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that anything that didn&apos;t make the finals was deemed &quot;unworthy&quot; per se. Certainly, it must be honestly said that certain pieces did spark negative reactions. The judges, coming from different places, often had widely varying opinions. This was, we think, a good thing. Again, the judging process is subjective. No one is claiming &quot;objectivity&quot;. No aesthetic work is of any objective value whatsoever, except perhaps in the sense that certain works have a historical consensus cultural value. Quite possibly, there are masterpieces in the lot of non-finalists that would be unrecognized for now. There is, admittedly, something imperfect about competitions. However, it&apos;s also nice to spur creativity and dialog by worldly motivation, since in general it seems so many more words than notes about microtonality are created. So we think it&apos;s a worthwhile trade-off.</p><p>UnTwelve certainly wishes to maintain a good relationship with the community that gave impetus to its creation. This is why I monitor with interest what is being said in these forums. Feedback is welcome. Even more welcome is active involvement. If anyone wants to draft a list of things you&apos;d like to see to make a better process that can be reasonably implemented, we&apos;re all ears. If anyone wants to lend a hand coding, streamlining a process, organizing, helping with administration of the website, etc., step right up.</p><p>Hosting costs money, especially if there is a storage and bandwidth quota. I&apos;ve been paying for the UnTwelve site since 2005, before it was UnTwelve (midwestmicrofest), and although we are now able to legally raise tax free dollars, we still lack a dedicated fund-raising agent, and a public relations agent. Right now, I&apos;m coding submission engine scripts, maintaining the website, fielding questions, raising money, organizing concerts, bookeeping, making mailing list announcements, doing public relations (like now!), etc. I will also be conducting interviews and promoting the finalists in the upcoming weeks. I simply do not have the time to add any more to my plate without badly hurting my family and work life. And--it&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been able to sit down and write anything worthy of sharing with the world, and I miss that.</p><p>That said, with help, we are willing to implement useful ideas for documentary and educational purposes. We certainly have no problem documenting that so-and-so wrote a piece for this year&apos;s competition, and it&apos;s available &quot;at so-and-so&quot;...however creating HTML markup for that takes time. Perhaps there is a way to have a free site like <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> host some data that any contestants would agree to once I need to clear the current crop off the site. Or perhaps, the artists themselves can host their own music, and send us a link (once they agree to have their piece linked from our site). We&apos;ve even batted around the idea of a &quot;listener&apos;s choice award&quot; which would not be a cash prize, but a way for the general public to give their votes and feedback--similar to the &quot;audience choice award&quot; at a film festival. But not all of the contestants may agree to such a process, esp. after the fact. But if anyone can suggest a web architecture that would make such a polling script possible, do suggest. Preferably, such a structure would stay within the <a href="http://untwelve.org">untwelve.org</a> domain....</p><p>So, to reiterate, we&apos;re open to what you&apos;re all saying. We can say that it&apos;s probably not realistic to ask the judges who already gave hours of free time to give a paragraph of feedback to 40+ contestants. This becomes much less realistic as the contest grows every year as we want it to. I already get in trouble in my life for the time this project takes away from other pressing concerns and duties. Quick thought--maybe there might be a way for contestants in the future to get a password to access judges (brief) notes after a competition, should they want it, built into the submission engine (which, I hand coded myself in Python, BTW!). However, this has its own dangers, so the contestant would have to agree that UnTwelve would not be held liable to any ego-bruising which resulted from their curiosity! :)</p><p>All of this takes time, sweat and money. I&apos;d love more help.</p><p>Thanks again for all the feedback, folks.</p><p>Best,<br/>AKJ</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron&gt;&quot;For example, we had 4 microtonalists and 3 non-microtonalists on this<br/>&gt; year&apos;s panel, all of whom are leaders in their field.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Now that is cool...I got the impression listening to last year&apos;s winner that<br/>&gt; the judges were based more toward strict microtonal in taste...proves me wrong<br/>&gt; in a very good way. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Briefly, the purpose of the competition is to promote excellence in microtonal<br/>&gt; &gt;composition, and expose the general public to the highest quality work that<br/>&gt; &gt;comes out of this particular field;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Kind of expected...it seems clear this is made as a cut off point, to, like I<br/>&gt; had said before...try to help microtonality get/keep a good name by &quot;filtering<br/>&gt; out&quot; everything but the best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    A side question would be...how many of the artists actually got ratings from<br/>&gt; the judges of, say, less than 7 of 10?

It would probably make the most sense to let each of N judges pick their top choice, and each time they do that contestent gets another $/N amount of the prize.

However, it&apos;s your contest and you can do what you like, but I am very disappointed it isn&apos;t the contest I thought it was, which would be a contest to encourage people to write microtonal music and then present the results, not a lecture on what is &quot;highest quality.&quot;</p><p>&gt; We are not interested in promoting, per se, the judge&apos;s personal visions, although arguably that is what inevitably happens in any competition.

If they had had a<br/>&gt; composition contest 275 years ago and Bach had entered it, he would &gt; have lost. Scarlatti likewise.</p><p>None of the entries even comes close, in my estimation, to Bach and Scarlatti. And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s true or fair to say Bach or Scarlatti wouldn&apos;t have won. You&apos;re only insulting the judges, really. Your choice!</p><p>&gt; (2) This is the &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; attitude I was trying to claim you probably didn&apos;t hold. No one gets to decide what I think is high quality but me, and it is presumptuous to tell me I don&apos;t need to bother to listen to George Secor because some committee has decided his music is of lesser quality, and they know best. I realize the world is awash with prizes, some very prestigious and worth a lot of money, which make these kinds of claims. In the sciences and mathematics such claims even make sense. But no Grawemeyer Prize or the like is going to award only the &quot;best&quot;, whatever claims are made to the contrary, and hence such claims are better left unmade.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not simply present the truth, which is you got a panel of &gt;judges, added up the score, and this was the result?</p><p>I don&apos;t see how we misrepresented anything. It was a contest, and people generally know how that works. Everyone submitted, knowing the rules, knowing the judges, knowing they likely could have lost. They may have even read our mission statement in the past. I&apos;m pretty sure that the winners feel honored to have been picked, for what it&apos;s worth.</p><p>We are in a constant state of refinement of the process. Everything that is said will be considered. We&apos;ve listened in the past, and will continue to do so. Remember that last year there was a small admission fee. People made a huff about it. This year, no fee. We evolve.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We like to think of it as dangling a carrot of cash so people can be motivated not just to write microtonal music, but microtonal music that would be attractive to the broadest cross-section of listeners.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You and Michael Sheiman. Why do you want the broadest spectrum of listeners? Taste is so variable.</p><p>In spite of the variability of taste, survey afer survey of classical music lovers through the ages ends up with names like Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Stravinsky, Haydn, Schubert, Brahms, etc. on the list. The broadest spectrum of listeners tends to, by the law of large numbers, give us the nearly-universally acknowledged masters.<br/>It says something. I love lots of &quot;hidden corner&quot; classical music by so-called &quot;minor composers&quot;, in some cases more than some pieces by these masters, but I don&apos;t think these masters shouldn&apos;t be there on such a list. There&apos;s a reason they are there, I think.</p><p>&gt; It would probably make the most sense to let each of N judges pick their top choice, and each time they do that contestent gets another $/N amount of the prize. Averaging scores is averaging apples and oranges. However, it&apos;s your contest and you can do what you like, but I am very disappointed it isn&apos;t the contest I thought it was, which would be a contest to encourage people to write microtonal music and then present the results, not a lecture on what is &quot;highest quality.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>You know, I thought we had addressed this, and I thought it was now moot, since I mentioned we&apos;d be asking the non-finalist composers to consider letting us link to their pieces. You can&apos;t blame us for not wanting to host pieces indefinitely without extra funding....or you can, but it&apos;s simply a pragmatic decision, so it&apos;s really a waste of argument space unless there is some kind of monetary or labor donation you want to make to have it happen.</p><p>No lecture was given. Just an explanation of the motivation. A contest does encourage people to compete; to rise to the top in skill and quality, whatever those are *subjectively* deemed.</p><p>We want broad spectrum of listeners because that&apos;s our mission. We believe in the propagation of the beauty of microtonal techniques.  Since many people around here complain about 12-equal&apos;s ubiquity, one would think the same people would be happy to see an organization doing something about it in a small way.</p><p>The competition structure you propose, Gene, ($/N) is indeed interesting, novel, and fair. Perhaps we&apos;ll consider it. We blindly, I suppose, use classic models, and this seems like implementing your proposal would give the competition a unique edge. Do you know of other competitions that work this way?</p><p>&gt; &gt; We are not interested in promoting, per se, the judge&apos;s personal visions, although arguably that is what inevitably happens in any competition. Fundamentally, a piece is judged by how much it excites and/or moves the collective ear of the judges.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is NO COLLECTIVE EAR!</p><p>It&apos;s a poetic way of saying something about the process.</p><p>&gt; By nature this is subjective, and collectively so. One hopes that by having a responsible panel of judges of varied tastes and positions in the musical field, a reasonable consensus is reached as to a work&apos;s merit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Adding up a bunch of numbers is not a consensus, it&apos;s a vote.</p><p>How ever you want to reword things, the results still stand. Some music was voted, or deemed by a process, to be more attractive than other music, because of a particular score, for this particular event. It says nothing of the ultimate objective worth of the compositions heard (if such a thing is even meaningful as a concept), or the people who composed them, as we have already stated.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This is why we chose musicians from different disciplines, who are all exceptional in their fields. We also understand that contestants need to feel confident in the judging, and believe that our choice in judges also addresses this concern.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That the judges are so disparate, and the music likewise, is fine for awarding prizes but no one can have any confidence that they&apos;ve kept the best and tossed the rest from each person&apos;s personal perspective. That&apos;s preposterous under such circumstances.<br/>&gt;</p><p>One can only do what one can do: pick a variety of judges from different backgrounds to vote blindly. I disagree that whatever winners comes out of the process says nothing about the pieces which won. At the very least, it says: &quot;These pieces survived a process involving these people&quot;....</p><p>Think of it another way: can a piece of music be a masterpiece if no one ever wants to hear it? If no one likes it, for all time? What if only one person, the composer, ever likes it? It may be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, but that would be a very private masterpiece. It&apos;s hard to always recognize a masterpiece. It can take some years. But a contest is a flash in the pan. Again, we are happy we spurred creativity, period. That&apos;s the completion of a mission.</p><p>We fully admit that the opposite can be true: a very popular work of mediocrity....but it must be admitted that the entire subject of aesthetics is subjective and subjective again. Who says something is mediocre or great? UnTwelve says: these people won. You are free to disagree! We are most happy, like it was said, about spurring a flood of creative energy, and this was the most important thing about it. Again, we are listening to the critique that such a &quot;flood&quot; should be on full display. We need help, though.</p><p>&gt; &gt; About hosting non-winners: since UnTwelve doesn&apos;t own rights to pieces submitted, we&apos;d have to ask the composers to grant their permission.

This  becomes much less<br/>realistic as the contest grows every year as we want  it to.&quot;</p><p>  Agreed...it would take a long time for this compo and probably much &quot;worse&quot;<br/>for next year&apos;s compo.   Perhaps more along the lines of what I was saying is to<br/>have a list of songs that includes everything the judges, on the whole,<br/>recommended...even if that means just a simple star rating and recommendation<br/>graphic (if the song, say, gets over 7 stars or so) and nothing else.</p><p>  Far as listener choice...I was thinking maybe a second star rating and a<br/>second recommendation graphic IE &quot;listener&apos;s choice recommended&quot; for those over<br/>a certain rating.</p><p>Aaron&gt;&quot;Quick thought--maybe there might be a way for contestants in the future<br/>to get a password to access judges (brief) notes after a competition,  should<br/>they want it, built into the submission engine (which, I hand  coded myself in<br/>Python, BTW!). However, this has its own dangers, so the  contestant would have<br/>to agree that UnTwelve would not be held liable  to any ego-bruising which<br/>resulted from their curiosity! :)&quot;</p><p>   Exactly, I think it could really help, especially if judges were not listed<br/>by name to preserve any chance of an artist getting angry and trying to chase a<br/>judge down.  I don&apos;t know about the rest of the artists...but I pretty much come<br/>in making every new song realizing someone will hate it...I mean, making it too<br/>soft ticks of those who like aggressive music, putting in tons of variation of<br/>ticks of those who like hummable motifs.</p><p>   In the end of the day, the only thing I let &quot;bother&quot; me is if someone says my<br/>song sounds like the opposite of what I was going for IE say I made a song<br/>focused on complex rhythm and got a bunch of notes back saying &quot;the rhythm<br/>really needs more complexity&quot;.   In which case I&apos;ll usually just ask other<br/>people and try to get more perspective on how my song failed to meet my intended<br/>goal.  True story...people say the strongest part of my songs now are often the<br/>beats...and a lot of that is due to effort trying to prove one guy who thought<br/>my beats were not complex enough wrong...he pretty much saved my life there. :-D</p><p>    Sometimes I&apos;ll even laugh if someone says &quot;well this song is way too<br/>aggressive and repetitive with a 4-on-the-floor beat, annoying like a hard dance<br/>song with a single melody that gets forced in my head&quot; if I was actually going<br/>for that kind of feel...just thinking in my mind &quot;well...may not be your style<br/>but...that was actually my point for this song&quot;. :-D</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24870 href="#24870">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2011 8:20:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron&gt;&quot;In addition, your music will be promoted from our website in the form  of<br/>artist interviews of the top 3 finalists, and a downloadable audio  tracks<br/>consisting of the finalist&apos;s pieces.

Why do you want the broadest spectrum of<br/>listeners? Taste is so variable.</p><p>    Agreed, Aaron and I have been trying to do the same thing (lol), although<br/>trying to get there in slightly different ways.  My take (in defense of<br/>Aaron)...is that getting the broadest spectrum of listeners (and composers!)<br/>into microtonality means more attention, better availability of music and<br/>instruments...for everyone on the scene.  I have no doubt however frustrated I<br/>am that some of my favorite artists in the competition aren&apos;t getting<br/>&quot;recommended&quot; my Untwelve...that the attention to and resources toward the art<br/>are going to be vastly improved due to Aaron and the judge&apos;s efforts regardless!<br/>:-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;Think of it another way: can a piece of music be a masterpiece if no one  ever<br/>&gt;wants to hear it? If no one likes it, for all time? What if only  one person,<br/>&gt;the composer, ever likes it? It may be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, but  that would be a<br/>&gt;very private masterpiece.&quot;</p><p>    Right...that&apos;s the other extreme IE how are we helping reign in interest to<br/>the art of microtonality if, say, only one judge loves a song but nearly<br/>everyone else hates it?  Probably very very little...&quot;even&quot; if said favoring<br/>listeners and composer are both PHDs highly respected for their theories: even<br/>the &quot;strongest&quot; or technically correct judge or composer can&apos;t force the public<br/>opinion to turn around toward it with respect.  Hence my gravitating toward the<br/>&quot;weird&quot; concept of &quot;broadest spectrum of listeners&quot; along with Aaron....</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=24873 href="#24873">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2011 8:34:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>You&apos;ve had a stand invitation for hosting your songs on my server.

If they had had a<br/>&gt; &gt; composition contest 275 years ago and Bach had entered it, he would &gt; have lost. Scarlatti likewise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; None of the entries even comes close, in my estimation, to Bach and Scarlatti. And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s true or fair to say Bach or Scarlatti wouldn&apos;t have won. You&apos;re only insulting the judges, really. Your choice!</p><p>I am NOT insulting the judges. You, however, are indulging in the fantasy that adding a bunch of numbers from different points of view about different kinds of music results in a number which is a measurement, and to add insult (see, I can use the word too) to injury, claim that not regarding it as a measurement and objecting on principle and as a mathematician to the idea, which you appear to hold, that it is is &quot;insulting the judges&quot;.</p><p>Bach was highly esteemed in his day as a performer with a legendary ability at extemporization, but as a composer he was considered old-fashioned, and to music critics that tends to be deadly. The 1952 Grove&apos;s Dictionary of Music dismissed Rachmaninoff as a hack whose work will be forgotten, because it was written in a style which was out of fashion. Would it be insulting to the judges to claim that if he had entered a music competition in 1940 judged by those sort of music critics he would have lost?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see how we misrepresented anything.</p><p>You are still claiming, implicitly, to be doing a measurement.</p><p>&gt; In spite of the variability of taste, survey afer survey of classical music lovers through the ages ends up with names like Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Stravinsky, Haydn, Schubert, Brahms, etc. on the list.</p><p>Well, no. Those lists keep changing.</p><p>&gt; The broadest spectrum of listeners tends to, by the law of large numbers, give us the nearly-universally acknowledged masters.</p><p>No, the broadest spectrum of listeners gives us Justin Bieber; someone who doesn&apos;t much bother anyone and some people go for. You need time for the kind of judgment you want anyway. When Mendelssohn performed Bach&apos;s Saint Matthew&apos;s Passion in 1829, Bach had been dead for 79 years; he was little-known, and the piece in question unknown. When Vivaldi was revived, he was unknown, and etc. The whole Renaissance was terra incognita at one time, not to mention the Middle Ages. We owe much to the work of musicologists.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I am very disappointed it isn&apos;t the contest I thought it was, which would be a contest to encourage people to write microtonal music and then present the results, not a lecture on what is &quot;highest quality.&quot;</p><p>&gt; You know, I thought we had addressed this, and I thought it was now moot, since I mentioned we&apos;d be asking the non-finalist composers to consider letting us link to their pieces.</p><p>You are making the natural but false assumption that Yahoo posts appear in the order in which they were written. This one is from before all that appeared.</p><p>&gt; The competition structure you propose, Gene, ($/N) is indeed interesting, novel, and fair. Perhaps we&apos;ll consider it. We blindly, I suppose, use classic models, and this seems like implementing your proposal would give the competition a unique edge.

Hopefully, we will get to hear the prize winners in a short while. At the same time, let me also congratulate those unnamed entrepreneurs who made available their pieces that I could listen to in the brief window of neglect for the much discussed competition policy.</p><p>Do not forget that 10 finalists get a free copy of Mus2, the awesome stand-alone microtonal score editor that packs quite a punch! (<a href="http://www.mus2.com.tr">www.mus2.com.tr</a>)</p><p>I&apos;ve been reading about the reactions to the competition, as is generally always the case when people are competing whilst brandishing principles and/or standards all their own. More importantly, my eyes caught this critical bit of information by you which I very much agree with:</p><p>&quot;There are also plenty of folks who do real-world microtonality professionally or semi-professionally that were pushed away or turned off by the relentless negativity and one-upsmanship that often surfaces here.&quot;</p><p>Drawing upon myself all the liability that is my share in the past &quot;flame-wars&quot; (for I too can growl with impatience when my competence in my field of profession is blatantly &amp; nitpickingly questioned), let me share an observation of mine that might lead to a possible solution for gathering up the &quot;lost souls&quot;...</p><p>1. It appears that apples and oranges don&apos;t mix. Certain people coming together spark the wrong kind of vibe even though they be musicians, composers, tunaniks of equal calibre.</p><p>2. As my father says time and again: &quot;Every person is worthy by the token of their honest accumulations&quot;. I believe even those &quot;stick-out guys&quot; whose tone I very much execrate are worthy in the field of tuning, theory and composition. They deserve to contribute in equal measure with the rest.</p><p>So, here is a thought on a new kind of organization. Let us suppose enclosed discussion rooms (workgroups) under a single list are created. Let us further suppose that these rooms are marked by grade of their discussion intensity and vibe. Let us further suppose that we can assure people having the potential to set off a &quot;thermonuclear reaction&quot; (based on their past activity) can be sealed away from interacting with their antagonists, except in designated discussion rooms strictly moderated by impartial parties. Finally, let all the &quot;lurkers&quot; subscribe to any of the rooms (workgroups) of their choosing. This way, flame-wars could be perhaps avoided and maximum productivity reached.

There are also plenty of folks who do real-world microtonality profeessionally or semi-professionally that were pushed away or turned off by the relentless negativity and one-upsmanship that often surfaces here. Too bad it has to always happen. There were some amazing folks around here when I first joined. Most of them have expressed privately to me their impatience and frustration with the general bickering, name-calling, an impatience I certainly share.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The epicenter of the community that just wants to create stuff does what it will in such situations--it moves elsewhere, away from the poison; or it just stays in the real world where things like concerts of music, and playing and sharing with common decency, politeness and mutual respect really count. I was in San Diego over the holidays where I met with Joe Monzo, who took me to meet Jonathan Glasier at Sonic Arts, as well as Bill Wesley, who creates his own amazing mbiras and electronic instruments. A true genius, and he has nothing but contempt for the state of online discussions of music and microtonality in general.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still lurk out of habit; I used to be addicted when I first started, and my interest waxes and wanes. I&apos;m interested in some of the pieces that get posted, really. I wish that there were a way for me to get an alert to those and ignore everything else, especially the content-less back and forth eye-poking. Really, it gets old.
