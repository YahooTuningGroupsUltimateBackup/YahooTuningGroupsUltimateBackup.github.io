April 19 &ndash; Sat. April 23, 2011<br/>at the Independent Media Center in Urbana, Illinois</p><p>Through  a series of historical accidents, Western society&rsquo;s music has come to<br/>be dominated by a single tuning system, often called &ldquo;twelve tone equal<br/>temperament.&rdquo;  In this climate of intonational monoculture, those who  oppose<br/>the status quo with fresh and oddly-tuned musics need DESIGN.</p><p>Microtonality  is a proposal to sing out of tune with conventional wisdom and<br/>offer a  badly-needed alternative to what everyone already knows.  The<br/>Microtonal  Design UnConference is a call to curious experimenters everywhere to<br/>collaborate on projects of Microtonal Design in good company, and show  them.</p><p>The  &lsquo;un&rsquo; in &lsquo;unconference&rsquo; refers to a non-hierarchical organization. It<br/>begins with a collaborative wiki; anyone - including you! - can edit the  wiki<br/>page with plans and desires for the UnConference.  For our  purposes, Microtonal<br/>Design includes (at least) composing new music,  building instruments,<br/>performing in microtonal systems, recordings,  research, brainstorming for the<br/>future -- all determined by the desires  of participants. We&rsquo;ve designed an<br/>intensive filled to the brim, and  there&rsquo;s plenty of room for your desires and<br/>questions in there.</p><p>EVENTS</p><p>&#x9;* Now:<br/>&#x9;* Edit  the Wiki Page and add your plans and desires for the Microtonal Design<br/>UnConference -<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Microtonal+Design+Unconference+2011">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Microtonal+Design+Unconference+2011</a><br/>&#x9;* Tuesday April 19<br/>&#x9;* 8  to 9 pm: Microtonal Meet and Greet with Jam - Come to get involved with<br/>Microtonal Design projects in the week ahead - bring your microtonal  desires<br/>and an open mind - microtonal jam on odd instruments to follow -  FREE<br/>&#x9;* Wednesday April 20<br/>&#x9;* TBD:  Project Cloud - MD participants (having met at the Meet and Greet) will<br/>work together on projects connected with their desires, self-organized<br/>&#x9;* 8  to 9:30 pm: Oddmusic Radio Shower - Microtonal Design UnConference<br/>Edition - special guest X.
