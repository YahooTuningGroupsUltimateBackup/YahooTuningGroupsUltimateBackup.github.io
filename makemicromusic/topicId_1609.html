I want to hear the intervals of<br/>&gt; the Harmonic Series.</p><p>First, you can play from midi keyboard via FTS. To do that, tick In | Open Now,<br/>or if regularly using FTS when playing from midi keyboard, tick In | Open at<br/>start of session. Then play as many notes simultaneously as you like up to limits<br/>of polyphony of soundcard / synth.</p><p>You can play from p.c. keyboard using, e.g. the Seed window, move mouse over<br/>the picture of the keyboard, and play using the keys in the top row of the p.c.<br/>keyboard, 1, 2, 3, ... There are some limitations on which three notes chords<br/>you can play in this way, because design of p.c. keyboard is not set up particularly<br/>for playing chords (seems to be mechanical, at any rate, nothing to do with FTS,<br/>or even Windows, and varies from one keyboard to another).</p><p>Also, can show the arpeggio window, click whichever notes you want to include<br/>in the chord, and then use Ctrl + click on the play button to bring up the<br/>Arpeggio / Scale playback config window (which you can also get from the main window)<br/>and choose chord as the play method. This can also be used to play a chord sequence<br/>by showing arpeggio windows for each chord and then using the option to play them<br/>all one after another in the order visited (before clicking the play button, click<br/>on the captions of the arpeggio windows for all the chords you want to hear in the<br/>order in which you want to hear them).</p><p>On subject of harmonic series notes played together, I wonder if you&apos;ve found<br/>Help | Help | Other pages | Harmonic series notes sound well together<br/>yet. This plays the notes as overlapping notes with sustain.</p><p>So that&apos;s a brief intro to some of the ways of playing notes simultaneously in FTS as it is set<br/>up at present. Another one that may be worth mentioning is to make a custom voice consisiting<br/>of several harmonics, and you can set the strength of each harmonic as you like.<br/>See Voices | Custom voices for some examples, such as Marimba playing harpsichord partials<br/>- if that isn&apos;t showing yet, click &quot;Make all presets plus free any not in use&quot;.</p><p>Say if interested in following any of these up further, or something else.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1611 href="#1611">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Retunes to scale entered as cents, ratios or whatever. Uses<br/>pitch bends and re-mapping of midi channels to do this rather than tuning tables -<br/>so it will work with any GM compatible synth or soundcard. Includes many of the SCALA<br/>scales and modes, and one can use it to make a searchable drop lists of all the SCALA<br/>scales and all the SCALA modes.</p><p>For members page, maybe something like<br/>Mathematician by training, inventor, programmer of Fractal Tune Smithy,<br/>and amateur composer,<br/>and could have home page as <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/tunes.htm</a><br/>with mp3s at <a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/RobertWalker">http://www.mp3.com.au/RobertWalker</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1627 href="#1627">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2002 2:48:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Graham,</p><p>Okay, added you to the list, thanks.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1629 href="#1629">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
