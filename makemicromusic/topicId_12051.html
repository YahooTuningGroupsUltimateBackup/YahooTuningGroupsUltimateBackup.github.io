It<br/>&gt;&gt; microtunes via read and play .tun files and can read, resynthesise<br/>&gt;&gt; and play almost any audio file format.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you clear up something, since you have Chameleon: they say<br/>&gt; load wav/aiff samples into one of four voice slots - does this mean<br/>&gt; that for using samples you are only able to load one sampled note,<br/>&gt; and it spreads it across the entire kbd? I didn&apos;t see anything<br/>&gt; about loading entire sample sets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree, it is a pretty deep instrument, very good for atmospheric<br/>&gt; things as well as morphed melody useage. As for importing samples<br/>&gt; and using tuning files, this can be done by Rhino and Wusikstation,<br/>&gt; and CronoX has the added ability to load multiple samples and<br/>&gt; assign them to key ranges, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2006 5:11:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles,</p><p>Thanks for the information on Chameleon. When I had demo&apos;d the instrument, it was brand new, and this sampling feature is in it&apos;s latest version. It certainly sounds intriguing, even if (or especially) one used it *apart* from straight sampling, and utilized it for a new facet of instrument creation.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to take a look at a current demo to check it out, and will report back. Again, thanks.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
