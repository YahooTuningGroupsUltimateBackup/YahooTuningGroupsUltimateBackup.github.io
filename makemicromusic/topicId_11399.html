It is what motivated much of the painting of the 19th century.<br/>possibly the best music done electronically is when people are figuring out their settings.</p><p>One of the problem of electronics is that certain sounds become associated with certain times, being representative of the technology at the time. For this reason it is quite subject t owhat one could only call fashion. Also it often represents the economics of the creator and  for the most part the field is dominated by whoever has the most funds sounding the best.</p><p>Usually i recognize when i do listen to electronic music that it is representational for some sound beyond what the artist is able to achieve.<br/>it is a young field and i tend not to get too bogged down about when or where it sounds like.</p><p>This is by the way i tend to approach Gene&apos;s music. That it is representational of of the idea more than a finished performance.</p><p>Those i know who do work in music production are usually find such ways of thinking incomprehensible in that here one has the actually material in front of one and the artist should use it. scores and structures really being conceptual ideas divorced from real music making.<br/>  Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;Great album.  2/3 through it.
