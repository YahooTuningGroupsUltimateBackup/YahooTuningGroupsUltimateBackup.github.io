Sonar and z3ta+</h1><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2005 6:15:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think maybe I&apos;m starting to &quot;get a grip&quot; on composing using Sonar<br/>and the z3ta+ softsynth.  There was a fair learning curve to all of<br/>this:  I would say a couple of months of test pieces and experiments<br/>and manual study.</p><p>And then, just when I was about to begin, Jon Szanto would throw yet<br/>*another* book my way... :)  Many thanks, Jon, though.  The one on<br/>*sound creation* was particularly valuable.  I even made my<br/>own &quot;ersatz bell&quot; which is part of this piece.</p><p>In any case, I have a couple of observations at this point.  For one<br/>thing, Sonar is a dream for the &quot;control freak&quot; composer.  It&apos;s<br/>really far superior to the other sequencer I was using before.<br/>Almost *anything* can be done in Sonar, if you take some time to<br/>figure it out!  It has a fair learning curve (no worse than Sibelius,<br/>I don&apos;t think... ) to understand all the features, but it&apos;s well<br/>worth it.</p><p>Making good sounds in the z3ta+ is a challenge, and there are people<br/>out there who are, apparently, just &quot;sound designers&quot; and do lots of<br/>complex things with various oscillators, envelopes and filters to<br/>create interesting sounds.  Quite frankly, though, sometimes, as in<br/>the case of the &quot;preset&quot; sounds for the z3ta+, the designers just<br/>make complex &quot;showcase&quot; or &quot;showoff&quot; sounds for the synth.  Sometimes<br/>simpler things, in my opinion, are even more &quot;musical...&quot;</p><p>One question that took a while to resolve was how to work with the<br/>softsynths vis a vis the processing power of the computer.  I was<br/>getting some &quot;pops&quot; and weird behavior which, as a &quot;newbie&quot; made me<br/>wonder if I was going to be successfully using softsynths.  It turns<br/>out, though, that all I needed to do was to *freeze* more of the<br/>synths I was using in Sonar.  Actually, with the processor I have,<br/>*several* of the softsynth &quot;instances&quot; (each track) have to be frozen<br/>in order to things to operate smoothly.  I really think I can only<br/>have two or so operating at any one time.</p><p>So, there is a *lot* of &quot;freezing and unfreezing&quot; of these synths<br/>going on in the composing process.  (&quot;Freezing&quot; the synth turns the<br/>track into audio which is less of a strain on the processor...)  I<br/>was &quot;spooked&quot; a bit a first, since Sonar froze up a few times in the<br/>freezing and unfreezing process.  I thought this was going to be a<br/>big problem.  It turns out, though, at least so far, that this really<br/>isn&apos;t such a problem and the program freezes were really<br/>just &quot;flukes&quot; that happen some of the time.  Compared to the number<br/>of times I&apos;ve been freezing and unfreezing, it isn&apos;t really a serious<br/>problem, at least so far.</p><p>I&apos;ll report back some more after more &quot;practice&quot; with this new gear.<br/>It&apos;s a little like learning to play a new &quot;instrument!&quot;  Maybe I&apos;ll<br/>even eventually have a piece to show (lets hope!  :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
