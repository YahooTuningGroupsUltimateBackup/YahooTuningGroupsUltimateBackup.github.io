He was a superb theorist and performer (alto sax), and was able to take his influences, such as Bird and Trane, and come up with an original approach, which had it&apos;s roots in their playing, but didn&apos;t sound like either one of them. Right after I started studying with him, he said I should analyze the music of Bach, and that suggestion was the single most important thing I&apos;ve ever done, as far as understanding Western music theory. And, although he didn&apos;t get into non 12 tunings, he once mentioned the idea of taking the overtones of a chord, and soloing around them...if he had gone just a teensy step further with that idea, he would have entered the world of microtones.<br/>  He said many profound things to me over the years, but one of the most important was this: in music, you&apos;ve always got just as far to go as when you first started (that would apply to any art). And boy, is that true, it keeps one humble to realize that. He had no predjudices towards any style of music, and would talk about music from any style or country or era with equal intelligence. I once saw him play a solo (on Autumn Leaves) at a jam in Denver, and it was a jaw dropper, I&apos;ll never forget it. he is, by far, the greatest musician I&apos;ve encountered in Denver over the years, and if the breaks had happened for him, he would have been a formidable presence on the world scene, I&apos;ll miss him greatly, artists like him are rare, indeed...HHH<br/>PS...there should be an obit in the Sunday Denver Post, haven&apos;t seen it yet...denverpost.com</p></div><h3><a id=11982 href="#11982">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2006 12:33:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for this, Neil.
