Let me try to address<br/>some of the questions:</p><p>While I really like Robert Fripp (and a huge fan of Adrian Belew who I think<br/>handled most of the lead work on Discipline) that sound is characteristic of<br/>my ebow.<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBow</a></p><p>I think I agree about the merits of having more contrast. I got caught up in<br/>trying to match the video I made of my CT Scan - Sonar lets my load a video<br/>and play it at the same time I record / play music. Since I was determined<br/>to give ImprovFriday an expressly made video for their video event I was<br/>working a bit fast. There is a difference in attention / quality when<br/>composing say for an event or for my own enjoyment or a casual commitment.</p><p>The question of minimalism.</p><p>As a composer you may agree with this answer - balance is what is important.<br/>If what you want to say can be accomplished by solo flute<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=116">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=116</a><br/>(I refer to the 12 edo version)</p><p>Then a solo flute is enough.</p><p>If it takes an orchestra <a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=341">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=341</a>   then that is<br/>enough.</p><p>At one time game music *had* to be minimal because of the lack of computer<br/>resources and sound chip limitations. Some people ended up liking the sound<br/>instead of thinking it was cheesy. I still like to dial up a file from Doom<br/>or Doom II myself (despite the plagiarism the composer engaged in). And I<br/>have some opl2 FM chip music I wrote I still really like.<br/><a href="http://www.traxinspace.com/song/41308">http://www.traxinspace.com/song/41308</a></p><p>There is something to be said writing within constraints - people do it all<br/>of the time - sticking to 12 edo - solo classical guitar, solo piano,<br/>serialism. So... do we mean minimalism or &quot;game music sound&quot;?</p><p>If by minimalism you mean economy of musical material - I&apos;m all for it.<br/>Though.... honestly, I hate Bolero. And I&apos;ll probably not listen to CT-Scan<br/>too much either. Too much repetition can kill the message unless it is one<br/>of those brain virus pop songs or jingles. Then you are simply brain washed<br/>into liking what you hate....</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Apr 5, 2011 at 4:46 PM, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I like this most from your recent (always prolific!) output.
