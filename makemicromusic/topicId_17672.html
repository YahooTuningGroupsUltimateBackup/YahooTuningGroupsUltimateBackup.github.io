I chose .scl over .tun because<br/>I felt the ability to calculate tunings note by note on the fly<br/>would give greater flexibility than .tun, which is based on<br/>a prepopulated array for 128 midi notes.  Although in years<br/>past the .tun approach may have had a deciding performance<br/>advantage, the CPU usage for on-the-fly tuning is negligible<br/>for the current crop of PCs.  The result of the .scl based<br/>tuning is similar to the cents portion of the .tun specification,<br/>scaled for compatibility with the SynthEdit &apos;voltage&apos; model.</p><p>To me, the .tun approach is problematic for real-time key<br/>modulation.  My thought is it would take a separate .tun<br/>array for each modulation one wished to support.  In the<br/>current .scl based scheme, key changes are handled by<br/>just moving the centerpoint and playing out the current<br/>tuning as needed by the oncoming note stream.  The neat<br/>thing is that key change centerpoints can be set just as<br/>easily from any tuning in memory as from the tuning that<br/>is being played.</p><p>The Microtuner uses configurable, dedicated midi channels<br/>(e.g. channels 15 and 16) to control real-time key and scale<br/>change for an ensemble of microtuned VSTs (or instances<br/>of the same VST with different timbral settings) on any of<br/>the other midi channels.  Note-based control changes are<br/>based on note position relative to a control channel&apos;s<br/>centerpoint.  So to modulate to the third step of the selected<br/>modulation tuning, the third midi note above the control<br/>channel centerpoint would be played or scored.  The control<br/>channel centerpoints can be set off to one end of the midi<br/>note range to support split keyboards, footpedals, etc.</p><p>I initially developed this scheme to retune Kontakt 2, but found<br/>that the price of Kontakt 2 is a factor to some folks who might<br/>otherwise be interested in it.  The SynthEdit community has<br/>quite a few developers turning out some really remarkable,<br/>low-priced VST components, and I&apos;m hoping the new<br/>Microtuner will find a role in that ecosystem.</p><p>Robert</p><p>Quoting Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt;:</p><p>&gt; Robert Strauss,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hi - I&apos;ve recently coded a tuning module for SynthEdit,<br/>&gt;&gt; and I&apos;d be grateful if a couple of folks on the MMM list<br/>&gt;&gt; would be willing to test it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yay!
