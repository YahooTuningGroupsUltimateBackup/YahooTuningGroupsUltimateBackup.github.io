For an independent artist I<br/>&gt;&gt; want to support, the music might be worth that, but we&apos;ve got to<br/>&gt;&gt; factor in the time it takes me to get the music off the CD, and the<br/>&gt;&gt; negative environmental impact of shipping the CD and then throwing<br/>&gt;&gt; it away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t understand the idea that we are going to support microtonal<br/>&gt;composers by buying albums, because the market is so tiny. It seems<br/>&gt;absurd to me not to put it on the web.</p><p>I&apos;m happy to send a check for a unique url which I promise not to<br/>share.

I chose 3 brief<br/>samples from the album to give some idea of its flavor and diversity. They<br/>can be found at:</p><p> <a href="http://www.dividebypi.com/album">http://www.dividebypi.com/album</a></p><p>There&apos;s something for everyone--raw violence (the first track grates my wife,<br/>who finds it harsh), humor (Plastic Bathtub Toys), primitive mysticism<br/>(almost the whole record), etc. In general, it&apos;s a &apos;darkness to light&apos; type<br/>experience, this record is. We are proud of it at the same time we are dying<br/>to move on to newer, better things. I hope you all find pleasure in it as we<br/>did in playing and producing it.</p><p>As soon as I figure out how to set up my PayPal account to link to my website,<br/>I can start taking orders for anyone who wants a real CD. I will make a brief<br/>email announcement in this group when that happens. The price will be $15<br/>plus shipping and handling. What that will be depends on whether you live in<br/>Sri Lanka or Peoria, Illinois.</p><p>Thanks for your comments and support. I&apos;ve considered all that has been said<br/>about the CD as a dying medium, and as long as it remains the number one way<br/>people digest musical recordings, I will make CD&apos;s. And, I&apos;d rather be paid<br/>for hard work than not, so I don&apos;t have plans to release any material for<br/>free. I do wish to actually eventually make a living doing what I love most,<br/>and that means biting the bullet and accepting the evils of Capitalism. I<br/>wish it weren&apos;t neccessary, too. As for Ogg&apos;s, mp3s, IPod-junkies, etc, I&apos;m<br/>happy to eventually get around to preparing other mediums for the &quot;CD<br/>naysayers&quot;, but they seem to be a distinct minority in 2004.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p><p>OCEAN, n.
