These pieces begin from<br/>the raga format, but evolve according to the in-the-moment<br/>emotional pulse and interplay.  Since the Oct.26th concert<br/>coincides with the huge anti-war rally in Washington D.C.,<br/>we would like to dedicate it and the Oct.23rd one as well<br/>to the principle of working to create peace through non-violent<br/>cooperation.  We would agree with one wise soul who<br/>has said that war is a failure of the imagination.</p><p>Both Lawrence and Lisa have been improvising and<br/>composing for over 30 years. Lawrence has recorded<br/>almost 2000 pieces of distinctive piano explorations, the<br/>hallmark of his repertoire.  He is also the director of the<br/>Planet Tree Music Festival in London which has presented<br/>new and exciting musical programs since 1996.</p><p>Lisa Sangita who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area<br/>specializes in playing her electric sarod (a one-of-a-kind<br/>adaptation of the traditional classical Indian sarod)<br/>in unusual contexts, but has found the greatest satisfaction<br/>in the combination of sarod with chordal instruments.<br/>She studied with maestro Ali Akbar Khan for more than<br/>15 years.  The timbres of sarod and piano are quite similar,<br/>but they differ widely in the way they express themselves<br/>(piano being a very harmonic instrument and sarod being<br/>more strictly melodic).   Together they create a whole<br/>new musical language.</p><p>&quot;. contemplative... capable of transporting listeners into hypnotic reveries.<br/>rife with ingenious improvisations and ever-mounting creative energy.<br/>a sonic mix that promises enthralling melodies and rapturous rhythms.&quot;<br/>          Derk Richardson     The East Bay Express<br/>                   =====<br/><a href="http://www.planettree.org/">http://www.planettree.org/</a><br/><a href="http://www.lisamoskow.com">http://www.lisamoskow.com</a><br/><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~mihman/lisa/">http://home.attbi.com/~mihman/lisa/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
