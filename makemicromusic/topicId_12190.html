But, the problem is, they are not known on any sort of national level, and are doing their writing in relative obscurity, which is a total drag to me, cause I&apos;d love people to hear their music, and I think they deserve fame and fortune because of their skills. When Wayne Shorter made that statement, I would imagine he meant it in the sense that, of the people in music who are well known, that have CD&apos;s out and get press, tour, etc, THESE are the ones not composing their asses off...and I would agree, cause much of what I hear in the media these days is pretty lame, compositionally speaking. But, of course there&apos;s still great musicians &quot;out there,&quot; and I do my best to find them...it&apos;s getting harder and harder, but shit, I am one opinion out of zillions, and I&apos;m always open to being proven wrong.<br/>  And, I compose cause I AM that, in a sense, it comes very naturally to me, I love it, and Ithere&apos;s nothing I like better than to create a new piece. Then, of course, when you put CD&apos;s out, and are looking for some sort of national/international career, it gets tricky, cause then it&apos;s important if folks like what you compose, cause they can book you or not book you, people can buy/not buy your CD&apos;s, and paying the rsnt with your art becomes an issue, and then it&apos;s more complex than just composing cause you love to do it. In the long run, if I like my music I&apos;m happy as a wittle piglet, and that&apos;s that...best...HHH</p></div><h3>Pete McRae &#x3C;petesfriedclams@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2006 11:06:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Howdy Neil,</p><p>  I understand all too well the exigencies of paying the rent with your art (or hocking a fine guitar...hee!)</p><p>  The thing I wonder about is how it seems like there used to be a place where you (ie &quot;one&quot;) could stick your (ie &quot;one&apos;s, etc.) guns, and still have some hope that your time would come to actually make a living doing what you believed in. I&apos;m sure there are people who have been (personally, not necessarily &quot;financially&quot;) resourceful, dedicated, and lucky enough--in terms of popularity--to do it. But they&apos;re not the ones who are keeping places like soundclick [and myspace?] running, as far as I know. Not to mention record companies...</p><p>  I wonder if people in the &quot;mainstream&quot; of media have any &apos;guns&apos; left to stick to, if you know what I mean.</p><p>  I see a lot of kids who seem to have been &apos;trained&apos; to want celebrity, who have almost no clue as to what skill or artistry might be at work, even there in &apos;tinseltown&apos;. The knowledge of skill and artistry isn&apos;t much of commodity anymore, I&apos;m afraid. But I really don&apos;t know.</p><p>  And a lot of what seems to be &quot;nostalgia&quot;, whether it&apos;s for things like The Beatles, or Jimi Hendrix, or for things like Ninja Turtles and Pee-Wee Herman, is fueled by the sort of super-cheese-factor Madison Avenue TV thing, so that it&apos;s unclear to me whether, for example, Hendrix endures because of his peculiar genius on the guitar, or for his media image on t-shirts and in ad montages. I don&apos;t see a lot of kids wearing Live-Evil t-shirts, but plenty of Jimi, eh?  Miles apparently never really stirred up the white kids (or had any enduring hits?), and Madison Avenue isn&apos;t interested in his estate. (???) Or, is it that Hendrix is so much easier to de-politicize, today? Always was? Until he started threatening to make a record with Miles? Oops...</p><p>  I guess what I miss is the time when it seemed like there could be a stigma attached to doing some hack commercial shit. That doesn&apos;t seem to enter the picture much, anymore, to my observation. Who isn&apos;t thrilled to get a jingle, or a slot (or a score!) in a stupid movie, these days? I can remember when you wouldn&apos;t tell your friends if you did something like that...Hee!  Or, you&apos;d tell &apos;em to look away, and just remember that you paid for your kids&apos; college with it.  (smile)</p><p>  I get pretty darned cheerful (!) myself, making my little noises out here, but sometimes I get mighty angry that it seems so much harder to FIND the good stuff. And then there ARE things you&apos;d never, ever hope to find, that are right up on the internet, now, but how much longer is THAT going to last?  Not long, if Cops-R-Us has its way, I&apos;m afraid.</p><p>  It&apos;s in the movie (Sun Ra--A Joyful Noise, IIRC), &quot;I wasn&apos;t making no music, officer. The Bible says you got to make a joyful noise for the lord...&quot; Oh, man, that was FUNNY!</p><p>  I really can&apos;t seem to help it that I find making microtuned music a powerful political statement. But it started because I just loved how it sounded. It was like recess or the end bell at school! Yippie! (pun intended)</p><p>  And, I actually have very little doubt that someone&apos;s going to come along and make a huge splash with a radically tuned piece. I just hope I live to hear it!</p><p>  Happy Sunday, (and Happy February [...])</p><p>  Pete</p><p>Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  [with much (!) omitted, here]<br/>     But, the problem is, they are not known on any sort<br/>of national level,</p><p>  ...it&apos;s getting harder and harder,</p><p>Yahoo!

Myself...I generally get an idea for a certain idea/emotional state that I want to express, then I find it on one of my axes. I don&apos;t think too much about ratios, consonances, dissonances, which notes to avoid, stuff like that...all that can change within the context of the music I am trying to create. Sure, I&apos;m aware of the possibilities of my various instruments (of course, I&apos;m always discovering things there, too), but the MUSIC is most important. I want a piece to express...something, and that something can be a zillion different things. In the long run, I want to create music with depth, music that means something to me, and hopefully to others as well...how I achieve that can be accomplished in an infinity of ways...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2010 10:32:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil&gt;&quot;Myself...I generally get an idea for a certain idea/emotional state that I<br/>want to express&quot;</p><p>    As do I IE I agree the tuning/scale should be chosen to fit the mood and not<br/>the other way around.  The problem comes when there&apos;s a mood in my head and the<br/>chord which closest matches that mood is not available in a tuning.  I&apos;ve found<br/>often happens in tunings without many strong chords: that&apos;s where things like<br/>consonance and dissonance come into play for me.  IE I can make a well-balanced<br/>mood song in 13TET and it&apos;s specifically good (IE a good deal better than 12)<br/>for certain moods...but I&apos;ve found the range of moods available in such tuning<br/>is lower due to not many chords under it working for me.</p><p>I don&apos;t see it as a game of &quot;which notes to avoid&quot; either...but rather how many<br/>different moods can be produced by the notes there.  Having a &quot;good&quot; tuning, to<br/>me, simply increases the chances of finding a chord or notes that suit the mood<br/>I intend to capture well: and this can even mean things like hitting 11 and<br/>13-limit chords on purpose...and is certainly not limited to 7-or-less limit<br/>chords..</p><p>   Another, almost opposite way to look at it, I figure, is to take the chords<br/>you like in a scale within a tuning and see what mood they have.   This is quite<br/>similar to the process of figuring out what &quot;key&quot; a song should be in for your<br/>desired mood even in 12TET.<br/>   Once you have the scale that suits your mood all figured out...especially in<br/>scales WITHOUT a variety of moods available, the mood becomes easily achievable<br/>as the tuning itself &quot;point you at it&quot;.</p><p>   Personally though...I like to stick to scales with many available moods<br/>(often those with many chords available to function as points of resolve and yet<br/>also many differently &quot;colored&quot; dissonant chords)...as I enjoy switching moods<br/>and &quot;tonal color&quot; several times within a single song.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2010 10:36:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Neil&gt;&quot;Myself...I generally get an idea for a certain idea/emotional state that I<br/>&gt; want to express&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     As do I IE I agree the tuning/scale should be chosen to fit the mood and not<br/>&gt; the other way around.</p><p>Why?

There&apos;s nothing wrong with deciding first<br/>what you want a tuning to do and then constructing one, but I can&apos;t help<br/>feeling that, especially when you look at the historical attempts at<br/>breaking out of 12 notes, a lot of possibilities were missed due to this<br/>demand that tunings have certain kinds of fifths or thirds or whatever.

You could easily compare a single major triad from optimal Porcupine  to a single major triad from a not-so-optimal Meantone and be hard-pressed to tell the difference.  Yet the two temperaments could not be more different in terms of how they function musically.  Even if you completely ignore the differences in &quot;auxiliary&quot; intervals between the two (i.e. that Porcupine has no real semitone and is full of 11-limit implications) and just string together simple chord progressions consisting solely of 5-limit triads, the difference in sound is practically night and day.  They are different languages entirely, built on completely different structures.  Resolution works so different in Porcupine than it does in Meantone it&apos;s just unbelievable.  Pajara, Mavila and even Father have more in common with Meantone, resolution-wise, than does Porcupine.</p><p>On the other hand, if you look at the difference between, say, the 31-EDO diatonic, the 27-EDO diatonic, and the 26-EDO diatonic, the difference in &quot;emotional content&quot; is practically negligible.  The sonic quality is quite different, yes indeedy, but using 9/7&apos;s and 7/6&apos;s or 17/14&apos;s and 21/17&apos;s, instead of 5/4&apos;s and 6/5&apos;s, does strikingly little to alter the emotional content of a piece of diatonic music.  If you don&apos;t believe me, try it out.  Or just go over to Herman Miller&apos;s &quot;Warped Canon&quot; page (a google search of &quot;Warped Canon&quot; reveals it as the first hit).  Compare the three EDOs I just mentioned, since together they cover pretty much the range of what I consider &quot;recognizable major 3rds&quot;.  Actually, I don&apos;t know for sure if Herman tuned the 27-EDO using the 444.44-cent major 3rds or the 400-cents ones...maybe the 22-EDO version is better to compare (though that kind of says something if I can&apos;t tell whether the 3rds are closer to 7-limit or 5-limit by ear).</p><p>I think you&apos;ll find based on what you hear that the ratios and level of relative consonance has very little impact on the emotional quality of the piece.  Unless, of course, you are the sort of person who is irritated by beating, in which case you&apos;ll probably find anything that uses something too far from 5/4 as a major 3rd will anger you.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;This is a use of the word &quot;accurate&quot; new to me: the major third in 15et is<br/>&gt; (still) 13 cents sharp, just like 12et, but the fifth is 18 cents sharp.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Maybe in ratios...but, overall, the feel of the chord, to me, remains much<br/>&gt; alike.

To<br/>&gt; be honest some weird stuff happens in 12TET as well that seems well explained by<br/>&gt; HE, such as the horribly off (mathematically) approximation of 5/3&apos;s working so<br/>&gt; well to fill the same functional/emotional role without half so much trouble as<br/>&gt; you&apos;d expect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Two intervals HE seems to affect far more than most...are 3/2 and 5/4.<br/>&gt; However the nearest &quot;centers of tonal gravitation&quot; I hear as being 9/7 (as you<br/>&gt; mentioned) and 11/9.  I realize these intervals are NOT included in HE theory<br/>&gt; (IE 6/5 and 4/3 are the nearest &quot;centers of tonal gravitation&quot;...but even with<br/>&gt; the closer 11/9 and 9/7 intervals the major third errors in 15TET seems<br/>&gt; obviously closer to 5/4 than to those intervals.<br/>&gt;      In other words...as I&apos;ve said many times, I think HE has the right idea but<br/>&gt; is missing a few rather important ratios, such as the 9/7 you mentioned.  And<br/>&gt; when I choose a scale to compose with, I often think &quot;how do this scale&apos;s dyadic<br/>&gt; errors compare to HE-style dyadic slack IE not so much what the intervals  are,<br/>&gt; but what intervals (and their corresponding emotions) they are attracted to&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    And, for about the millionth time...I simply don&apos;t agree with your opinion<br/>&gt; that 50/33 is a horrendous fifth.  It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t hear you, it&apos;s that I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Rather I think said type of fifth it&apos;s on the edge of what constitutes a<br/>&gt; good &quot;pure&quot; fifth (with about 73/49 being the other, lower &quot;edge&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .  This all plays into my prospective realization...that &quot;cent errors&quot; matter a<br/>&gt; lot more for some intervals than others and even, at times, are not symmetrical<br/>&gt; (IE the error above a dyad can be more sensitive than below).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And, no...I can&apos;t explain why mathematically but, when in doubt between<br/>&gt; elegant looking mathematical equations and my ears (especially when I start<br/>&gt; actually using the tunings in compositions)...I always follow my ears...just<br/>&gt; like when I compose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;You are far better off using Porcupine[15] in 22et.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Just for grins...what is said tuning listed as in Scala?

So the roots of the tonic and dominant chords are an approximate 11/10 apart, if you get my meaning.  So I just go ahead and follow the general rules of tonal chord progressions, and it works surprisingly well even the chords are a little jumbled.

I mean, it does not seem bad if<br/>you want something like good 5-limit and 7-limit (IE use 53TET or even &quot;just&quot;<br/>31TET, for example)...but soon as you throw in 11-limit or 15-limit...and want<br/>all possible dyadic relationships to be within 7 cents of perfect you&apos;re indeed<br/>talking very very high TETs.</p><p>   I recall some of you guys were trying to take my 9-tone &quot;Dimension&quot; scale<br/>(which has virtually all common practice dyads plus 22/15, 18/11, 11/9, 15/11,<br/>11/6, and a handful of others) and map it to a TET and you came up with<br/>something like 221TET!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Now here&apos;s the rub on how I think this all effects composition....&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>  It just makes me think &quot;hey, it&apos;s just 9-tones at once you need...is it really<br/>that important to aim for transposition that it&apos;s necessary to play on a virtual<br/>keyboard with 221 notes to do it?...why make an easy thing so hard for anyone<br/>who dares to try and play with it (the scale)?  It seems to beg to scare<br/>composers away from anything with much more than 31 notes unless they are<br/>serious die hards about it...</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2010 10:38:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s a quizzling of a chord under 22TET...</p><p>1/1 7/6 14/9</p><p>    The fifth it uses looks mathematically ridiculous...but somehow, at least to<br/>me, it sounds mysteriously resolved and relaxed as an entire chord...almost like<br/>a brighter add2-ish type chord.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2010 11:03:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a quizzling of a chord under 22TET...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 7/6 14/9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The fifth it uses looks mathematically ridiculous...but somehow, at least to<br/>&gt; me, it sounds mysteriously resolved and relaxed as an entire chord...almost like<br/>&gt; a brighter add2-ish type chord.</p><p>The fifth it uses is a regular old fifth, up to octave equivalence.
