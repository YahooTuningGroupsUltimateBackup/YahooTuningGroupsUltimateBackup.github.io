The cent notation is simply a point of orientation on the instruments, and the ratios are included in those points where the ensemble intonation really can be rehearsed through reduced beating etc..  As long as we&apos;re talking about a performance by live musicians without training in a new notation system who are playing existing instruments, I think the accuracy of the cent notation is more than sufficient for a performance score and the presence of the recording insures that this is by no means a betrayal of any JI ideal.

I don&apos;t know any musicians who might, but your piece makes a compelling case for just intonation music as a unique contribution to the musical material of our time. This example really sings and it has the kind of power that you can only get from just. Could you play it on a keyboard live?

But as you say, once installed it was already set up to play .ogg files out of the box.</p><p>First time around I didn&apos;t notice that the ostinatu phrase was literally playing exactly the same phrase over and over all the way<br/>through the first section, so that was nicely done, once there are several parts then it seems varied because of its changing roles<br/>in the harmony.</p><p>I thought the middle section started well, a bit of magic there in fact when it enters in, but then - about when you have the<br/>repeating single notes, it seems to falter. Probably just varying the dynamics for those notes, - and a bit of shaping with maybe<br/>some gentle tempo and dynamic changes. Or indeed, I might have a go at some quite large dynamic changes too and see what happens,<br/>e.g. a diminuendo right down to pp at the end of the slow section and a bit of an accelerandi at the same time, it might work. Then<br/>when the listener thinks that may just be the end, bring in the last section with those denser chords ff to surprise them. You could<br/>also have a gentle dynamic change before the slow section to prepare for it, go a bit quieter as if expecting something to happen,<br/>or something. Or vary the dynamics of some of the instruments. and not the others, e.g. fade away the ostinatu phrase first or<br/>whatever.</p><p>It might do no harm to add in an extra (possibly shortened e.g. only one repeat of the ostinatu phrase solo) exact recapitulation of<br/>the introductory material at the end after the morphed dense chords version, then finally at the end, bring the phrase in again on<br/>its own for two or three repeats, maybe just swell all the way from silence and fade away completely. Or you could make something of<br/>one of the variations on it picked up by the other instruments, just add in one instrument with the most interesting variation just<br/>to embelish it for a moment, but then make nothing of it, leave the ostinatu to continue on its own and fade away and leave the<br/>listener wondering about where it might go next.</p><p>I&apos;m just presenting these as ideas to think over, hoping they may be helpful to stimulate other ideas, not meaning to say you need<br/>to do these exact changes of course! But it can be fun having written a piece to play about with the dynamics and tempi and see what<br/>it does to it, can often make quite a big difference :-). Well surely you know that, anyway just by way of starting a discussion<br/>rather than just say that I enjoyed it.</p><p>BTW what is maximally incompetent counterpoint?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7564 href="#7564">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2004 1:42:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;idealordid&quot; &lt;jeff@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Music first.
