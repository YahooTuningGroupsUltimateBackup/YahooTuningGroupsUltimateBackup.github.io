Tera is a slam dunk: feed it a .scl file and it will play in that intonation; better than that, by default it is set up with instruments on all 16 midi channels, so you can either layer them (by making two go to the same channel) or tune them all to differing intonations. One of the &apos;cute&apos; serendipities of this particular patch is that while the lower end of the instrument mimics some kind of clavichord, the higher you go it tends to get almost flute-like, rounding off the attack transients and high freqs. During the latter half of the etude it almost serves to semi-orchestrate the three voices, or at least having the top sing out a bit.</p><p>Beyond that, just a couple of obvious tempo fluctuations, and then the audio is sent out with just a little bit of small bright room verb courtesy the Lexicon Pantheon verb (which is a lovely verb included with the Producer Edition of Sonar 4).</p><p>It&apos;s short:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/djw_17_tera_2.ogg">http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/djw_17_tera_2.ogg</a> (~820kb)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7811 href="#7811">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2004 9:07:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>for some reason this gets downloaded in OSX as a text file</p><p>Jonathan M.
