So that you know, I am leaning towards a Kurzweil 2600XS. Why a kbd? Well, my kbd controller has been about ready to poop out, I&apos;ve always liked the Kurzweil weighted-action kbd, and (as Mary said) this new generation comes with the KDFX board built-in, thereby allowing for a lot of processing power both internally and for use outboard-wise.</p><p>Beautiful sounds, a good interface, a new input-device (the 88 &apos;ivories&apos;) and, if need be, a one-stop beast to bring to a gig. And Kurzweil is doing a promotional with reduced prices.</p><p>I gotta go collect aluminum cans now...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=943 href="#943">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>10/6/2001 7:48:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John</p><p>You could probably get a 2500 with weighted keys for about 2000<br/>grand.  I know because my voice teacher is selling his and he has<br/>checked EBay.   To have KDFX and perhaps the contemporary card added<br/>would be about a grand.   I&apos;m not convinced the k2600 is that much<br/>better for most people.</p><p>ANd if that is where you are looking also be sure to check out the<br/>Korg Triton.  Alex has one, with sampling, and I&apos;ve come around to<br/>thinking it sounds better than the Kurzweill (oh gasp but true).  I<br/>actually retired my K2000 keyboard this summer and got a Korg Karma.<br/>I love it, and thats why my voice teacher is selling his k2500.  The<br/>sounds are awesome.  I think we have even fooled Jacky a few times<br/>with the drum sounds into thinking it was hand drumming. It doesn&apos;t<br/>handle samples though, so it wouldn&apos;t be appropriate for your needs</p><p>Butits worth looking at to see if your &quot;needs&quot; change.</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=948 href="#948">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

Until the day I actually get something new, I&apos;ll keep my eye out for quality used gear. The one caveat that I usually have is used keys, as I&apos;ve talked with a few people that found actions had gone pretty bad on an item that they picked up. Electronics, once burned in, tend to be stable, but mechanics (like our bodies) eventually fail. (Note that the 2500RS is a rack unit, so I&apos;d still need some new keys...).</p><p>But your points are well-taken, and the money won&apos;t leave my hands without a fight! And thanks for the tip on the Triton; my needs are pretty set, as sampling really is the goal here, but down the road? Oh, by then there will be some new, shiny toy....</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
