This is what I believe happens with a lot<br/>of world music today.  Supposedly western (but really<br/>Japanese) keyboards can adapt to ethnic scales.

Perhaps some tenets of language processing mapped onto an<br/>adaptable feature space, or set of feature spaces, would be best here.</p><p>But for example, you often resolve notes upward and downward in the<br/>Hardy piece by something resembling a half step, aka you&apos;re using a<br/>leading tone. Whether or not leading tones work because of some<br/>psychoacoustic thing, or because we have cognitively learned that this<br/>is a trigger to start analyzing this note differently from the last,<br/>or whether the two are really the same, is besides the point - it<br/>works, and you end up hearing a stable pattern in the scale that you<br/>probably recognize the diatonic scale as also sharing.</p><p>You also arpeggiate chords that sound like diatonic structures I know,<br/>and those are recognizable. Sometimes the structures diverge in a<br/>noticeable way, and that sounds interesting: it sounds to me, in the<br/>beginning of this, you&apos;re playing a distorted version of meantone E,<br/>G, F#, A#, but then you go D-F#-G-A, F#, A. Except the A# in the first<br/>line and the A in the second line sound like they might actually the<br/>same note, except they&apos;re just barely not, which is an interesting<br/>pun. So now I&apos;m hearing this as some kind of weird, fragmented,<br/>detuned meantone structure in which E-G-F#-A# forms a consistent<br/>chunk, and D-F#-G-A-F#-A forms a consistent chunk, but they don&apos;t<br/>relate to each other in a meantone-consistent way in that the<br/>difference between A# and A is way smaller than my meantone machine<br/>predicted.</p><p>Either way, I think - why run away from this? If you accept this, then<br/>you&apos;re hearing how it&apos;s similar to meantone (hearing the note names<br/>laid out as I mentioned before), and how it&apos;s different (noticing that<br/>A and A# ended up at almost the same spot), which is just another way<br/>of saying you&apos;re hearing how meantone and your miracle-based scale in<br/>general relate to one another. After enough listens, one will grasp<br/>the at first counterintuitive weirdness of that small semitone between<br/>A and A#, and now you&apos;re starting to form a new paradigm that relates<br/>the two other paradigms. I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s really optional, either,<br/>since I don&apos;t think that hearing the meantone similarities will ever<br/>really go away, so you can either fight with yourself about it or do<br/>this. Maybe I&apos;m wrong, just my current thoughts.</p><p>Well, at least that&apos;s my current theory. I don&apos;t really claim to know<br/>how it works, but I do know that there&apos;s nothing wrong with accepting<br/>when classical conditioning does occur.</p><p>&gt; I used to use a meantone octatonic for 7-limit harmony.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s on my &quot;Blues Scales&quot; page of 7-limit scales.</p><p>I like the 8-note 29-tet version. A different take on the blues. To<br/>me, the full blues scale gamut is a particular SPM mode but in<br/>12-equal - 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. All notes except the b1 and the b6.<br/>Pretty much sums up the blues to me. My main problem with it is that<br/>in 22-equal, the fifth of the V chord is a step off, but in 12-equal<br/>this works out to 3/2.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think that a good ear training exercise is to try and<br/>&gt; &gt; hear fragments of as many regular temperaments in other<br/>&gt; &gt; regular temperaments as possible, so that you can really<br/>&gt; &gt; morph fluidly between tuning systems. Not only should we<br/>&gt; &gt; accept that blackwood resembles in some way a symmetrical<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;diatonic&quot; scale, we should also be looking for<br/>&gt; &gt; resemblances between magic and miracle and mohajira and<br/>&gt; &gt; semaphore, as well, or whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The common ground of Magic and Miracle is 9-limit harmony.<br/>&gt; I recorded a Fleetwood Mac cover once using both tunings<br/>&gt; simultaneously to prove that it can be done.</p><p>Whoa, do you have this uploaded somewhere? What song did you do?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I wish I could get some decent synth working in 22-et...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s holding you back?</p><p>I&apos;m having problems getting the release trails to work in EastWest. I<br/>release a note, and then - kapwing! The pitch bend suddenly shuts off,<br/>and the note jumps back over to its nearest 12-tet neighbor as it<br/>decays. This sounds like bullets ricocheting off the walls. It also<br/>ends up affecting the most xenharmonic intervals the most.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=25400 href="#25400">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2011 10:30:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Supposedly western (but really<br/>&gt; Japanese) keyboards can adapt to ethnic scales.

I said you don&apos;t have to do that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In &quot;When I Set Out for Lyonnesse&quot; I chose the tune<br/>&gt; &gt; freely from miracle temperament. (At least, the<br/>&gt; &gt; Blackjack+3 tuning on my keyboard.) At one point I<br/>&gt; &gt; thought it was sounding so stable that I must have<br/>&gt; &gt; brought a diatonic scale in by the back door. Because I<br/>&gt; &gt; was using decimal notation, the pitches weren&apos;t being<br/>&gt; &gt; measured relative to a diatonic, and I had to work out<br/>&gt; &gt; how close it was. The result -- nowhere near. I&apos;d been<br/>&gt; &gt; picking out neutral intervals. You can find the score<br/>&gt; &gt; and MP3 on my website if you want to check what I was<br/>&gt; &gt; doing. (Record it properly if you like!)</p><p>There is a sense of a diatonic scale, in that only 7 of the<br/>10 degrees of the decimal scale are used.  Each degree can<br/>be raised or lowered by a quomma (between a comma and a<br/>quartertone).  I was wrong about it keeping to<br/>Blackjack+3.  I must have used my Ztar, although I<br/>remember working the melody out on a remapped Halberstadt.</p><p>&gt; Longer response posted on tuning; perhaps this entire<br/>&gt; situation is best modeled as a feature space, which is a<br/>&gt; hot topic in DSP these days. Perhaps some tenets of<br/>&gt; language processing mapped onto an adaptable feature<br/>&gt; space, or set of feature spaces, would be best here.</p><p>It&apos;s based on the decimal scale.  To understand it properly<br/>you need to follow that.</p><p>&gt; But for example, you often resolve notes upward and<br/>&gt; downward in the Hardy piece by something resembling a<br/>&gt; half step, aka you&apos;re using a leading tone. Whether or<br/>&gt; not leading tones work because of some psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; thing, or because we have cognitively learned that this<br/>&gt; is a trigger to start analyzing this note differently<br/>&gt; from the last, or whether the two are really the same, is<br/>&gt; besides the point - it works, and you end up hearing a<br/>&gt; stable pattern in the scale that you probably recognize<br/>&gt; the diatonic scale as also sharing.</p><p>The decimal scale&apos;s built out of semitones: secors,<br/>approximating 16:15 or 15:14.  So you don&apos;t need diatonic<br/>logic to explain them.  Reduced secors, equivalent to 21:20<br/>I think, are allowed in decimal counterpoint.  Quommas<br/>shouldn&apos;t be used as direct intervals, but they can be<br/>indirect, and you spotted one below.  Double quommas,<br/>equivalent to 25:24, wouldn&apos;t come about in strict decimal<br/>counterpoint, but you spotted one here.</p><p>&gt; You also arpeggiate chords that sound like diatonic<br/>&gt; structures I know, and those are recognizable. Sometimes<br/>&gt; the structures diverge in a noticeable way, and that<br/>&gt; sounds interesting: it sounds to me, in the beginning of<br/>&gt; this, you&apos;re playing a distorted version of meantone E,<br/>&gt; G, F#, A#, but then you go D-F#-G-A, F#, A. Except the A#<br/>&gt; in the first line and the A in the second line sound like<br/>&gt; they might actually the same note, except they&apos;re just<br/>&gt; barely not, which is an interesting pun. So now I&apos;m<br/>&gt; hearing this as some kind of weird, fragmented, detuned<br/>&gt; meantone structure in which E-G-F#-A# forms a consistent<br/>&gt; chunk, and D-F#-G-A-F#-A forms a consistent chunk, but<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t relate to each other in a meantone-consistent<br/>&gt; way in that the difference between A# and A is way<br/>&gt; smaller than my meantone machine predicted.</p><p>Bleagh!  There&apos;s a mistake in the PDF scores that I&apos;ll have<br/>to fix.  Fortunately, I have the original pencil and paper<br/>one here to check.</p><p>Those things at the start can count as arpeggios because<br/>they&apos;re over a constant note in the bass.  The first is<br/>above a C, so it&apos;s 4:5:6:7 with the F# as an additional<br/>7:5.  (Certainly not an 11:8 -- I wasn&apos;t very 11-limit with<br/>my miracle harmony.)  The two rough As are a quomma apart.<br/>Other notes are a quomma off in the other direction between<br/>these two bars, and that probably was deliberate.  The root<br/>moves up by a neutral third.  Ah yes, compare bars 1 and 4<br/>-- all notes have been shifted by a quomma but not all in<br/>the same direction.</p><p>You&apos;re hearing it as meantone but it&apos;s really 7-limit<br/>harmony.  The quomma shifts are also written as different<br/>versions of the same note in decimal notation.  You can<br/>interpret any interval relative to meantone if you want.</p><p>&gt; Either way, I think - why run away from this? If you<br/>&gt; accept this, then you&apos;re hearing how it&apos;s similar to<br/>&gt; meantone (hearing the note names laid out as I mentioned<br/>&gt; before), and how it&apos;s different (noticing that A and A#<br/>&gt; ended up at almost the same spot), which is just another<br/>&gt; way of saying you&apos;re hearing how meantone and your<br/>&gt; miracle-based scale in general relate to one another.<br/>&gt; After enough listens, one will grasp the at first<br/>&gt; counterintuitive weirdness of that small semitone between<br/>&gt; A and A#, and now you&apos;re starting to form a new paradigm<br/>&gt; that relates the two other paradigms.

I wrote it using<br/>&gt;&gt; decimal counterpoint and 7-limit harmony. I&apos;d spent<br/>&gt;&gt; enough time with Miracle to get the decimal scale<br/>&gt;&gt; internalized. If you spend enough time listening to a body<br/>&gt;&gt; of miracle music you&apos;ll stop hearing the meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What body of miracle music shall I listen to? I&apos;ve listened to your<br/>&gt; decimal counterpoint stuff before, but wasn&apos;t sure exactly what it was<br/>&gt; I was hearing. I still can&apos;t really get into miracle, it always sounds<br/>&gt; sort of sinister and ominous to me.</p><p>You&apos;ll have to write it!  I did my bit.</p><p>The decimal counterpoint exercises are adapted from Fux.  I translated<br/>each cantus firmus into the decimal scale, and allowed quomma shifts<br/>to get the harmony right.  Then I wrote the counterpoint to follow<br/>Fux&apos;s rules with 7-limit consonances allowed and some melodic rules to<br/>distinguish steps from leaps.  The result is that you should be able<br/>to hear independent melodies moving in harmony and dissonances<br/>resolving when they arise.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=25418 href="#25418">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2011 10:10:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I still can&apos;t really get into miracle, it always sounds<br/>&gt; sort of sinister and ominous to me.</p><p>Is this</p><p><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/RachmaninoffPlaysBlackjack">http://www.archive.org/details/RachmaninoffPlaysBlackjack</a></p><p>really all that sinister?

American&apos;s don&apos;t want to switch to electric cars because the<br/>best ones only have 100 miles range, and more like 60 with some of the<br/>stop-and-go traffic during rush hour.  Electricity (for travel) is not a mature<br/>technology because the batteries powering it are not capable enough for many<br/>realistic travel situations...microtonality in most ways is: we have<br/>equivalently capable (or better) scales/chords...and even instruments to play<br/>them with.</p><p>   Three main barriers exists in my mind<br/>A) Competitively priced instruments with microtonal capability<br/>B) The issue of getting other people in your &quot;band&quot; to use microtonal<br/>instruments<br/>C) Getting listeners to accept the typical &quot;informality&quot;/non-compliance of the<br/>tunings to Pythagorean-like &quot;common practice&quot; intervals<br/>D) Good theory documentation (not everyone is going to want to learn prime<br/>factorized vectors and yadayada to understand this new type of music)</p><p>    Now for ELECTRONIC music, particularly of NON-(NEO)CLASSICAL genre, I don&apos;t<br/>even consider A, B,. and C to be an issue.   I&apos;ve found electronic musicians far<br/>less interested in formality than classical ones and a lot more tolerant of<br/>&quot;noise&quot;.<br/>   Also, well priced microtonal capable softsynths are all over the place, all<br/>members of any electronica group can easily use them, and using non-standard<br/>intervals (just like typical electronica use of weird timbres) are not<br/>issues.    It seems electronica lacks ONLY D and most other genres lack A,B,C,<br/>and D.  But, like Neil said, A and B would likely come automatically if there<br/>were just one pop star who did microtonal music and companies like Yamaha<br/>started mass-producing microtonal acoustic instruments and C would come when<br/>people who liked the artist started saying &quot;hey these weird intervals are<br/>actually pretty hip&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Trouble is, there&apos;s vastly more alternative tunings to 12-TET (even  assuming a<br/>&gt;single set of harmonic goals) than there are alternative  fuels.  So everyone<br/>&gt;trying to build an infrastructure is in competition  with everyone else doing<br/>&gt;the same, instead of cooperating. &quot;</p><p>   Agreed.  Personally, I just wish we were able to pick a top 5 or so scales<br/>and start popularizing those.  And, just as importantly, state the scales in<br/>cents or fractions rather than some funky mapping or MOS notation 99% of<br/>musicians won&apos;t understand (as we often do on this list).  Personally 19TET,<br/>31TET, and Blackwood seem like easy enough targets...perhaps the best test would<br/>be for someone like you to compose a bunch of songs in each of them and see<br/>which songs people like best.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So instead of amassing an army to overthrow the military dictator,  we&apos;ve got a<br/>&gt;bunch of would-be dictators fighting with each other over  the right to lead the<br/>&gt;revolution. &quot;<br/>    Well, can we at least agree that the easiest path is a scale system that<br/>extends the diatonic scale (IE lets musicians do what they&apos;ve always done plus<br/>add something new if/when they want)?</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=25457 href="#25457">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2011 11:24:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Agreed.

The one benefit I think I have as an author is that compared to the &quot;masters&quot; in this field, I&apos;m an idiot, so I know how idiots think.  My math education stopped at calculus 1, and I&apos;m usually as turned off by terse mathematical jargon as anyone.  I think the concepts associated with regular temperaments are quite simple, really, and can be boiled down to a few sentences.  The only thing difficult is translating the numbers to musical terms, but I feel like I&apos;ve finally gotten that down enough that I can explain it to my fellow idiots, so even if they don&apos;t get the math they can get the idea.  Of course, I think I&apos;m going to impose strict limits on complexity, meaning no temperaments that require more than a 10-note MOS to achieve target triads on at least 40% of their roots.
