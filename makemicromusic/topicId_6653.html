Perhaps the silence on this list was due to the<br/>fact that it sound more like  &quot;computer music&quot; than what we typically hear<br/>here as &quot;microtonal music.&quot;    But of course, it is microtonal.  Or at<br/>least. . . it ain&apos;t 12-TET.</p><p>&gt;you to like it, but I think it&apos;s worth listening to. Failing that my next<br/>&gt;opus will be a neo-baroque doodle on a cheesy synth (but with an<br/>&gt;interesting tuning) : - )</p><p>I have a feeling it won&apos;t be as cool as this,  but I could be wrong.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;   <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/slowtones/pages/glass%20page.html">http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/slowtones/pages/glass%20page.html</a></p></div>
