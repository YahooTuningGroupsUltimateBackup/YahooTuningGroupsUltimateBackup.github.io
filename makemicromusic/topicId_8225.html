I&apos;ve noticed<br/>about 22 that there seem to be two approaches to tonality: the 7-<br/>note MOS septimal diatonic scales (using Whole Tone=4 steps and<br/>Semitone=1 step) and your own decatonic scales, which seem to lend<br/>themselves more to the 5-limit side of things.  Do you make use of<br/>both in your playing, or do you stick mainly to the decatonics?  How<br/>do you prefer to tune the instrument?

A bit reminds me of Jon Catler, but I&apos;m<br/>reminded much more of my own free-improv group MAD DUXX&apos;s<br/>performances at venues such as the Charles Playhouse in Boston. I<br/>used the 22-equal guitar for that group, and there was once a short<br/>clip of us on the web (&quot;Tuning Punks&quot;), but I think that&apos;s gone<br/>now . . . :( Anyway, you successfully tranced me out in ways that I<br/>hadn&apos;t experienced since playing with MAD DUXX years ago, thank you!</p><p>&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve got Carruthers guitars making me a 22-tet neck right now<br/>&gt; (hopefully be ready by next week, if I&apos;m lucky),</p><p>Excellent! and congratulations!!</p><p>&gt; and I was wondering<br/>&gt; if you might share some thoughts on the instrument.  I&apos;ve noticed<br/>&gt; about 22 that there seem to be two approaches to tonality: the 7-<br/>&gt; note MOS septimal diatonic scales (using Whole Tone=4 steps and<br/>&gt; Semitone=1 step) and your own decatonic scales, which seem to lend<br/>&gt; themselves more to the 5-limit side of things.</p><p>Well, firstly, I&apos;m suprised you find the decatonic scales to lend<br/>themselves more to the 5-limit side of things, since as you probably<br/>know they were designed specifically to support 7-limit harmony. This<br/>piece (prepared hastily and performed at the second Microthon)<br/>explores the symmetrical decatonic scale, in a few different<br/>transpositions, harmonized with 7-limit tetrads:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/decatonic-swing.mp3">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/decatonic-swing.mp3</a></p><p>The septimal diatonic scales, meanwhile, are great for {2,3,7}, or 7-<br/>limit omitting prime 5, harmony. And if you extend this chain of 22-<br/>equal &quot;fifths&quot; beyond 7 notes to, say, 12 notes per octave, you start<br/>to realize the full 7-limit potentialities (including prime 5) of<br/>this &quot;superpythagorean&quot; system. Also, besides the two approaches you<br/>mentioned, my paper _Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two Tone<br/>Temperament_ mentions a third possibility, a 7-note MOS with step<br/>sizes 4 and 3, occuring 1 and 6 times, respectively, per octave --<br/>supporting 5-limit or even {2,3,5,11} harmony. These non-decatonic<br/>approches are explored in this piece (also prepared hastily and<br/>performed at the second Microthon):</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/glassic.mp3">http://lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/glassic.mp3</a></p><p>Another approach evokes traditional functional tonal harmony while<br/>making use of 22-equal microchromaticism. Here&apos;s a 1996 attempt at<br/>performing a piece so constructed, on a standard 61-key keyboard:</p><p><a href="http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~chris/micromp3s/tibia_by_paul_erlich.mp3">http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~chris/micromp3s/tibia_by_paul_erlich.mp3</a></p><p>But more along the lines of the other approaches described above (and<br/>inclusive of them) are some systems described in my most recent<br/>paper, several of which are applicable to 22-equal. While the paper<br/>awaits publication in Xenharmonikon 18, I&apos;ve been mailing copies to<br/>all interested parties, so give me your address if you want one!</p><p>I want to apologize to this list, which has directed such questions<br/>to other fora such as the tuning list and tuning-math list. But it is<br/>only with great trepidation that I attempt a post to yahoogroups at<br/>all -- one of the lists I&apos;m on got spammed by someone using my e-mail<br/>address to send viruses to everyone -- so I beg this list&apos;s<br/>indulgence in allowing this post.</p><p>&gt; Do you make use of<br/>&gt; both in your playing, or do you stick mainly to the decatonics?</p><p>In addition to the other approaches mentioned above, I also make use<br/>of a &quot;free&quot; approach, a &quot;harmonic series&quot; approach, &quot;blues&quot;<br/>approaches of at least two varieties . . . 22-equal has a lot to<br/>offer!</p><p>&gt; How<br/>&gt; do you prefer to tune the instrument?  It seems as though for the<br/>&gt; septimal diatonic approach, a tuning analogous to the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>&gt; EADGBE would be ideal,</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; whereas to get the most out of the decatonics<br/>&gt; something more unconventional might be in order.</p><p>Not at all -- a septimal diatonic &apos;EADGBE&apos;, or &apos;septimal pentatonic&apos;,<br/>comprises half the notes of either kind of decatonic scale, so this<br/>same tuning of the open strings is great for decatonicism. It allows<br/>any of the decatonic scales to be played in one position, four notes<br/>per string -- perfect for the human hand!</p><p>&gt; Also, do you have any pictures</p><p>A picture with two views each of my 31-equal and 22-equal guitars is<br/>currently the last picture here:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/lst">/makemicromusic/lst</a></p><p>As you can see, my 22-equal is actually a 7-string, so a septimal<br/>diatonic &apos;BEADGBE&apos; is actually how I tune its open strings.</p><p>Best of luck, and please keep me updated on your 22-tone guitar! I&apos;ll<br/>listen to your 31-equal piece soon . . . Comments, questions,<br/>criticisms, etc. on my music and/or writings are most welcome and<br/>appreciated!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=8227 href="#8227">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2004 1:18:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>P. S. Pay no attention to the dots on those fingerboards. They are<br/>not where I would have put them for the &apos;pseudo-standard&apos; tunings (of<br/>the open strings) that I use. And most importantly, I must thank John<br/>Starrett for these excellent, flawless fretboards (of woods unique in<br/>my collection) and the incredible hard work that must have gone into<br/>them. Once over some initial setup surprises, they have remained<br/>remarkably buzz-free.</p><p>P. P. S. The edges of the callouses developed from playing an<br/>acoustic with .013s all day are great for fingering those high 31-<br/>equal notes!</p></div><h3><a id=8228 href="#8228">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2004 2:25:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Paul!</p><p>Thanks for the encouraging words!  I find it kind of amusing how<br/>playing that guitar sort of pushes my style towards the &quot;Catler&quot; end<br/>of the spectrum...but then again, it&apos;s his design, so go figure.</p><p>I don&apos;t want this to become TOO theoretical of a post, but I should<br/>clarify what I meant by a few things.  I&apos;ve been playing around with<br/>them a bit in Scala, and the reason I referred to them as 5-limit is<br/>that most of them form consonant 5-limit triads at up to 6 degrees<br/>of the scale.  For example, the Standard Pentachordal Major forms a<br/>5-limit major triad if you combine degrees 1, 4, and 7.  Using that<br/>as a template for a triad (three notes seperated by two degrees<br/>each), consonant 5-limit triads are formed at degrees 1, 4, 5, 7, 8,<br/>and 10.  Out of all the scales I&apos;ve messed with in 22, your<br/>decatonics seem to yield the highest number of consonant 5-limit<br/>triads (as opposed to the 7-limit triads with no 5-limit intervals<br/>that are formed by the septimal diatonic scales).  In other words,<br/>to play 5-limit music in 22, the decatonics would work best.</p><p>I&apos;m actually familiar with all of the compositions that you<br/>mentioned, courtesy of Andrew Heathwaite&apos;s listening list.  All of<br/>them I found very impressive and evocative.  I think &quot;Tibia&quot; was my<br/>favorite since it&apos;s so bizarrely twisted.  I have a friend who&apos;s a<br/>piano and composition major at SF State, and he freaked out when I<br/>showed that one to him.  &quot;It sounds like the notes are bending<br/>themselves!&quot; he exclaimed on first listen.  Now I must put up with<br/>him constantly humming the melody ;-).  If I can ever get him to<br/>retune his piano, I might have to pester you for the score.</p><p>I&apos;d really like a copy of your new paper, though I&apos;m a little wary<br/>of posting my postal address on the internet.  Is there a more<br/>secure way I could get it to you?</p><p>By the way, I think an Ibanez 7 string was the last guitar I was<br/>expecting you to play, given the styles of those 3 compositions.  I<br/>think I was expecting more of an archtop or something.  It&apos;s funny<br/>though, because the guitar I&apos;m having &quot;22-ified&quot; is a blue Fender<br/>Strat with Duncan humbuckers and a mirrored pickguard...viva &apos;80s<br/>guitar aesthetics!</p><p>I&apos;ll keep ya posted as things develop...though there probably won&apos;t<br/>be much action for another couple of weeks.</p><p>Many thanks for all the enlightenment,</p><p>-Igliashon Jones</p></div><h3><a id=8229 href="#8229">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2004 3:09:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t want this to become TOO theoretical of a post, but I should<br/>&gt; clarify what I meant by a few things.

The thing is, if you&apos;re<br/>really only interested in these 5-limit aspects, you&apos;d probably be<br/>better off using a tuning such as 46-equal or 34-equal instead of 22-<br/>equal for these decatonic scales.

The distributionally even scale<br/>sizes are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27, and the two step sizes<br/>in the 22-tone &quot;superpyth&quot; scale are close to being equal.

But rather than doing that, how much better it would be if<br/>you wrote a collection of short pieces illustrating some of the<br/>inherent possibilities of those tunings -- perhaps along the lines of<br/>Easley Blackwood&apos;s microtonal etudes.
