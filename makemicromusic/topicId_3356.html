The drum/bass thing, even if it is a loop or even if it is a sequence, has a lumpy kind of groove to it, unlike most anything else I&apos;ve heard. It kind of kills me how you&apos;re working with all that distortion, and you&apos;re doing it with the high-end Kyma system!!! That&apos;s not a hack on you, because you&apos;ve taken a pretty different approach than all the samples on the Kyma site.</p><p>One thing I wonder about, because I&apos;ve noticed this before in your work: there seems to be very little in the way of upper-frequency material in your recordings, say, like high guitar sounds, or high and bright percussive sounds/textures. I don&apos;t know if this is a purposeful or aesthetic slant of yours, and you may really be going for a mid-rangy, grunge-like sound. But that loping rhythmic feel might be enhanced by some crispy little touchs.</p><p>On the other hand, maybe it would ruin the effect. You&apos;re the composer/performer, *you* make the call! :)</p><p>Thanks for posting that one, and don&apos;t hesitate to share any details about just how you went about creating the recording/piece...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>graham@...</h3><span>6/11/2002 4:10:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;ae4a5i+3lmk@...&gt;<br/>jonszanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; Very cool, G.

It has the same monolithic feel as ffb, which is good up<br/>to a point but I need to work out how to free it up without weakening it.</p><p>The drum part is a loop from the sequencer, with MIDI-recorded processing.<br/> It&apos;s recorded to a file so the other parts can play along with it.  It<br/>sounds great on its own, which made it daunting to find other parts to add<br/>to it.  The rhythm is a dumbed down version of the Pygmy technique<br/>described on that French page.  It&apos;s a 4 beat rhythm with lengths<br/>2-3-3-3.  It sounds great, has forward momentum, and should be fine to<br/>dance to.  It&apos;s also bloody difficult to play in time with, so everything<br/>is drawn in.</p><p>Distortion&apos;s great with Kyma because I can control all the parameters from<br/>MIDI, and get exactly what I want.  It&apos;s also easy on the processors.  I<br/>designed the effect myself and I prefer it to the more complex<br/>amp-emulation examples.  I linked to my guitar effects from the Kyma forum<br/>some time back, and there have been a few downloads but nobody&apos;s said<br/>anything.</p><p>&gt; One thing I wonder about, because I&apos;ve noticed this before in your<br/>&gt; work: there seems to be very little in the way of upper-frequency<br/>&gt; material in your recordings, say, like high guitar sounds, or high and<br/>&gt; bright percussive sounds/textures.

But that loping rhythmic feel might be<br/>&gt; enhanced by some crispy little touchs.</p><p>I think, on repeated listens, it&apos;s a bit bass heavy and I&apos;ll re-EQ it<br/>sometime.  The noise-percussion sounds and the distortion are putting high<br/>frequencies in there.  I prefer not to get in their way.  The &quot;crisp&quot;<br/>sound is exactly what I like about them.  You lose some of that with the<br/>MP3.  I did actually turn down the extreme treble in the post processing,<br/>but the spectrum readout on WinAmp shows there&apos;s plenty left.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, maybe it would ruin the effect. You&apos;re the<br/>&gt; composer/performer, *you* make the call! :)</p><p>I like the texture of this example, especially if it&apos;s turned loud enough.<br/> It also works well on my cheaper speakers which lose some of the bass.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for posting that one, and don&apos;t hesitate to share any details<br/>&gt; about just how you went about creating the recording/piece...</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned things above.  It&apos;s all generated on Kyma.  The drum kit is<br/>built from noise generators and samples taken from my djembe.  Not that<br/>you hear much of them, but I&apos;ll be using them again.  The synth sounds are<br/>the new &quot;IOC&quot; synthesis, where you specify points for a waveform and the<br/>interpolation.  They then go through the usual analog-emulation filters.<br/>I worked out the tunes on paper, with an eye to decimal counterpoint, and<br/>keyed them in using my ZTar with a full decimal keyboard layout.  Then<br/>moved them around in the sequencer to fit the rhythm.  A lot of the time I<br/>was thinking in 4/4 and hoping it came out right.  I do need a proper<br/>multitrack recording package.  Apparently Pro Tools is the way to go.</p><p>I even added a bit of Eugenio Reverb to the whole mix so you can hear how<br/>good that is 8-)</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
