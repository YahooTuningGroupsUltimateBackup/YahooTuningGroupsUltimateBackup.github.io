I check in to browse through this list far more often than I post on it, and any person I respect who leaves gives me that much less reason to check in. I&apos;m always amazed by the stuff Kraig directs me to; whether it&apos;s exactly relevant to what I&apos;m doing I can&apos;t always say, since my own methods are awfully idiosyncratic. I echo Lawrence&apos;s desire for tolerance of differences of all kinds.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Lawrence Ball &lt;Lawrenceball@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; does it really matter that folk have spats.<br/>&gt; Is it really that difficult to disengage or delete.<br/>&gt; I simply don&apos;t read them as I sense a murky corner happening.<br/>&gt; So much envigorating discussion and sharing of perspective is possible.<br/>&gt; Being right could even become unfashionable.
