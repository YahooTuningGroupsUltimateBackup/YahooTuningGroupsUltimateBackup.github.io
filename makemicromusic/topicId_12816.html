This way I&apos;m not locked into pitch bending or relaying for microtonal support.

These tuning files (one uses .scl, the other two use .tun) were loaded into the instruments. I composed using them that way in realtime.

Do you like Prent&apos;s use of samples in Csound? Since I know you would like to emulate acoustic instruments, it seems like his work is some of the most successful of that strategy in Csound I&apos;ve heard.</p><p>&gt;The host program has the note numbers and instruments without the tunings?</p><p>Ah, the light bulb goes on! Yes, that is it exactly. For instance, let us say I want to write a single line in 15tet. I start up the sequencer (Sonar), insert an instrumental track (lets say an instrument called Rhino). When I do this there is now a track ready for me to record some midi music. I open Rhino and load a Scala .tun file for 15tet. Now, whenever I play my 61-note keyboard, Rhino is playing notes in 15tet. I can now enter music by</p><p>- playing in real time<br/>- step entering notes (this is non-realtime entry from the keyboard)<br/>- use a piano roll<br/>- I could even, if I had a midi file laying around, simply &apos;import&apos; the midi file</p><p>Hit the &quot;Play&quot; button and it plays the music in 15tet. It really is pretty simple. One of the beauties of this is that since it is the instrument that encompasses the tuning, and not the midi file, I could have any number of instruments tuned to differing tunings. Not everyone would do this, but for instance: someone working in a large-number ET for accuracy might actually be composing parts with small subsets. You could create tuning files for some of those subscales and load those individually.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying everyone should work this way, and it may very well not be the best route for you. But it really works well for me right now, and is getting better all the time. One of the things about the current MMM Day stuff is that I&apos;ve got a program that translates samples from/to many formats. What this means is that I can take, for instance, soundfonts and translate them to a format for an instrument called Wusikstation; this instrument tunes with .tun files, and so I now have access to some decent instruments (I used a Steinway soundfont in this piece) that can be microtuned. It is a lot less expensive than going the Kontakt 2 route - I still have more work to do to get the samples/patches sounding the way I want, but it may mean that I don&apos;t have to deal with Kontakt for the moment.</p><p>&gt;And what drives the host--in other words, what is the score, if any?</p><p>The midi data that is either input by me, or imported into the sequencer from an existing midi file. One of the nice things is that you can immediately view the data as a list of events, piano roll, or actual staff notation (12tet only).</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=12836 href="#12836">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2006 7:34:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d think Csound would be a good environment for you, but might be<br/>more &quot;getting your hands dirty&quot; than you&apos;d care to deal with (or have<br/>time).

It&apos;s one of those soft<br/>synths that understands .tun scala files.  I&apos;m not sure if it creates<br/>sounds from scratch, or uses samples though.  So you could import a<br/>midi without any pitch bends, and then set the tuning for them.  Gene,<br/>do you actually write those scala .seq files from scratch?</p><p>Joe</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@...m, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not a synth guy because they don&apos;t seem to be making synths<br/>with me in mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I want something which can work from an ascii score of some kind,<br/>like Csound, or from a midi file, and which supports microtonality. If<br/>I could get a collection of Csound intruments I liked I&apos;d be in<br/>business, perhaps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d think Csound would be a good environment for you, but might be<br/>more &quot;getting your hands dirty&quot; than you&apos;d care to deal with (or have<br/>time).

Yes, that is it exactly. For instance,<br/>let us say I want to write a single line in 15tet. I start up the<br/>sequencer (Sonar), insert an instrumental track (lets say an<br/>instrument called Rhino). When I do this there is now a track ready<br/>for me to record some midi music. I open Rhino and load a Scala .tun<br/>file for 15tet. Now, whenever I play my 61-note keyboard, Rhino is<br/>playing notes in 15tet. I can now enter music by<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - playing in real time<br/>&gt; - step entering notes (this is non-realtime entry from the keyboard)<br/>&gt; - use a piano roll<br/>&gt; - I could even, if I had a midi file laying around, simply &apos;import&apos;<br/>the midi file<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hit the &quot;Play&quot; button and it plays the music in 15tet. It really is<br/>pretty simple. One of the beauties of this is that since it is the<br/>instrument that encompasses the tuning, and not the midi file, I could<br/>have any number of instruments tuned to differing tunings. Not<br/>everyone would do this, but for instance: someone working in a<br/>large-number ET for accuracy might actually be composing parts with<br/>small subsets. You could create tuning files for some of those<br/>subscales and load those individually.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying everyone should work this way, and it may very well<br/>not be the best route for you. But it really works well for me right<br/>now, and is getting better all the time. One of the things about the<br/>current MMM Day stuff is that I&apos;ve got a program that translates<br/>samples from/to many formats. What this means is that I can take, for<br/>instance, soundfonts and translate them to a format for an instrument<br/>called Wusikstation; this instrument tunes with .tun files, and so I<br/>now have access to some decent instruments (I used a Steinway<br/>soundfont in this piece) that can be microtuned. It is a lot less<br/>expensive than going the Kontakt 2 route - I still have more work to<br/>do to get the samples/patches sounding the way I want, but it may mean<br/>that I don&apos;t have to deal with Kontakt for the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;And what drives the host--in other words, what is the score, if any?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The midi data that is either input by me, or imported into the<br/>sequencer from an existing midi file. One of the nice things is that<br/>you can immediately view the data as a list of events, piano roll, or<br/>actual staff notation (12tet only).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=12841 href="#12841">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2006 9:55:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joe&quot; &lt;tamahome02000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Gene,<br/>&gt; do you actually write those scala .seq files from scratch?</p><p>I screw around with various things which I put into Maple, which then<br/>screws around with them a whole lot more, which then writes out the<br/>first version of the Scala seq file to which I attach the correct<br/>header stuff.

One approach is this: start with a tuning<br/>system, and a scale to go with it, and do some one-fingered noodling<br/>to get thematic material. Now deconstruct the notes into 4 or 5 equal,<br/>plus a chord (NB: this is not a unique process so far as the chords<br/>go), which at this point will just be complete tetrads or pentads. Now<br/>take the 4 or 5 equal stuff, and start composing in it, using the<br/>thematic material as reduced to 4 or 5 et. Get something which sounds<br/>decent this way; the point is, in 4 or 5 everything harmonizes with<br/>everything else, since the whole thing is really a chord, so you can<br/>get your parts to move around freely. Now you&apos;ve got some of a 4 and 5<br/>equal piece, and when you add in chords for the parts which had chord<br/>info attached, your theme is reconstituted. You can use the chord info<br/>for the bass part, favoring root position.</p><p>The people composing music in 4 and 5 equal around here are really<br/>missing a bet, in that it makes a great starting point, by the way.<br/>That&apos;s what I did when I took Andrew Heathwaite&apos;s 5-et piece and<br/>transmuted it; that could be done just as easily with Rosencrantz the<br/>Sane&apos;s 4-et piece, or Hans Straub&apos;s 5-et piece. The final result<br/>sounds noticably like the 4 or 5 et starting point, but the addition<br/>of harmony makes an enormous difference; you can compare the two<br/>versions of Pinta Penta to get one example.</p><p>Anyway, you now have a bunch of stuff with gaps in the chords, and you<br/>fill in the gaps--I like to use chords with common notes; at this<br/>point you also can start filling in chords which go beyond<br/>otonal/utonal. Now use Maple to reconsitute music from 4 or 5 et<br/>skeletons plus chords. Now listen to what you&apos;ve got either as a midi<br/>file or when rendered; and see where to go from there. You can grab<br/>things and transform them in various ways, etc etc.</p><p>Or, you could simply write a piece from the get-go in 4 or 5 et, and<br/>harmonize that. All these people demonstrating the musical<br/>possibilities of 4 or 5 et are also demonstrating something else.</p></div><h3><a id=12850 href="#12850">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2006 12:51:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The people composing music in 4 and 5 equal around here are really<br/>&gt; missing a bet, in that it makes a great starting point, by the way.</p><p>I&apos;ve been trying to convince Robert Walker that an algorithmic<br/>microtonal composition program which goes way beyond what he has now,<br/>or anyone else has, is in reach from where he is now.
