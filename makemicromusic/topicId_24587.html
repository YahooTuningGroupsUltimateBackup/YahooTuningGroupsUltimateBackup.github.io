There are really only two step-sizes in the scale, one at around 137 cents and one at around 104 cents (8 of the large step, 1 of the small, or 8L+1s in MOS terms).</p><p>&gt;    Speaking of that...the 1.515 fifth (that really wasn&apos;t supposed to be able to<br/>&gt; be there, LOL) is, indeed, a pretty good fifth...not at all wolf like the<br/>&gt; 1.485-ish and 1.4545-ish generator fifths I used.</p><p>Huh?

The more in-tune you get the 7/6&apos;s, the more out the fifths get.  It&apos;s essentially a Moment-of-Symmetry scale, and it will retain its melodic character as long as the generator is between (and not including) 133.333 and 150 cents.  At around 140 cents, the fifths are basically Just, but the 7/6&apos;s are way over-shot into 13/11 territory.  Just a little sharper than your generator, at around 138.46 cents, you basically have 26-EDO, and while the 3/2&apos;s and 7/4&apos;s are more in-tune, the major 3rd of 5/4 is further off.  Also, interestingly enough, this scale can approximate both 5/4 and 7/4 quite well, but you can&apos;t get them together in a chord.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=24594 href="#24594">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2011 9:49:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Those are two different chords...I&apos;m really confused, actually, because there<br/>&gt;sort of isn&apos;t a chord at 1:12,&quot;</p><p>Argh...media player classic screws up the timing (it also says the song is 10<br/>minutes long!!!)...so i tried finding it in Audacity instead...<br/>....The &quot;sour&quot; chord is at about 1:04...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Huh?
