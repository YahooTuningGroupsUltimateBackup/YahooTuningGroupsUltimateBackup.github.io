Anyway, I find that Shaahin&apos;s scale division<br/>prompted me to borrow lots of the ideas and approximate<br/>interval sizes for a Peppermint variation -- thank you for<br/>the creative energy of your music and theory alike.</p><p>The curious thing is that I can put together and analyze<br/>Scala files, and also very usefully practice at the<br/>keyboard. A lot of my practice concerns different versions<br/>of Persian patterns such as Shur, Nava, and Afshari -- as<br/>well as variations on Arabic tetrachords such as Rast --<br/>available in the 11-note set I&apos;ve chosen within Peppermint<br/>24 as a variation on Shaahin&apos;s &quot;shurist.mp3&quot; tuning.</p><p>However, I somehow feel that to do a recording that I&apos;m<br/>going to post on the Internet, I should be in a more fresh<br/>and rested condition. From one viewpoint, this is an extra<br/>opportunity to practice in a relaxed way, to internalize<br/>some melodic patterns and also patterns of counterpoint with<br/>which I am experimenting. I tell myself that the more the<br/>patterns become spontaneous -- maybe one of the meanings of<br/>&quot;learning the theory and then letting it go&quot; when actually<br/>performing -- the more fluidly I should be able to do<br/>something posted here.</p><p>Further, what I&apos;m saying doesn&apos;t apply only to my new<br/>&quot;shurist&quot;-inspired set. It also applies to a &quot;Yahya12&quot;<br/>tuning inspired by one of Yahya&apos;s JI scales, and a tuning<br/>which occurred to me as a variation of Jon Lyle Smith&apos;s<br/>&quot;pelendro-1&quot; used in an impressive and adventurous piece<br/>posted here called _Quincunx_.</p><p>One thing that&apos;s happening in the process of all this<br/>adapting and practice, very notably, as I&apos;ve commented,<br/>driven by scales and pieces posted here, is that I&apos;m<br/>considering how the dastgah concept of Persian music<br/>might influence my organizational approach.</p><p>While _dastgah_ often gets translated more or less like<br/>&quot;mode,&quot; from another perspective it might be considered a<br/>family of related modes and melodies. This leads me to<br/>consider the different steps and &quot;scales within a scale&quot;<br/>such as the ones inspired by the tunings of Yahya, Jon, and<br/>Shaahin, and seek some kind of tentative scheme or &quot;program&quot;<br/>for an improvisation, almost a kind of &quot;suite.&quot;</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s maybe a bit humbling as well as pleasant to<br/>say, &quot;I may really not be in the best condition now to make<br/>a recording and post it on MMM, but I can practice and thus<br/>move toward a better performance which maybe will come this<br/>week.&quot;</p><p>A main lesson might be patience: getting something more or<br/>less &quot;right&quot; takes time, even when one is full of energy.</p><p>My warmest thanks to Yahya and Shaahin -- and now also Jon<br/>-- for their patience in this process.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
