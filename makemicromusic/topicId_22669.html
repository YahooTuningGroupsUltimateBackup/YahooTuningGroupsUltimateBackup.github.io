I particularly liked the Micro890407 piece that sounds to me like a santoor or hammered dulcimer. I think this would be very good as music for a film. A lot of tension and very expressive. It really feels like something is happening and the way the instrument is played often makes me think of flapping wings, possibly of a bird or fairy in distress.<br/>Is there a way we can download the tunes on your page?</p></div><h3>shaahin &#x3C;acousticsoftombak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2010 7:52:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi dear mark<br/>Many thanks to u.<br/>Yes,i try to imagine something and then let music goes everywhere.<br/>My website is here : <a href="http://www.96edo.com">www.96edo.com</a><br/>And what are u doing with music?<br/>Best wishes for u<br/>shaahin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mark&quot; &lt;mark.barnes3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for sharing those tunes.
