To imagine anything different would be to  invite the<br/>(im)possible tasks of designing new instruments, new  orchestras, new human<br/>capacities, new concert formats. Microtonal design  is a seminar for unsticking<br/>the ear and everything attached to it.&quot;</p><p>We&apos;re assembling a crew of dreamer-doers to design together, with meetings<br/>running February 7 to May 2 in Urbana.</p><p>News!  We have scholarships available.  We want to work with  people who are<br/>very excited about microtonal collaborations and social  change.  It needs you<br/>to happen, so get in touch today!</p><p>Andrew = gtrpkt@...<br/>Jacob = udderbot@...</p><p>We want to hear from you!</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
