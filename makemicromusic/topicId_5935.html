BTW, I&apos;m *jealous* of your compositional prowess<br/>&gt; (but am content to convey that jealousy as admiration).</p><p>Thanks for your positive comments, Paul !!!</p><p>This piece, BTW, was less compositional than &apos;pseudo-improvisational&apos;. You<br/>see, I designed some software in Python-TKinter, a step-sequencer of sorts,<br/>that I guided through and changed as I went. All I had to do was wait until I<br/>got bored, and stir things up a bit parametrically, so to speak. I&apos;m still<br/>flattered by your response for two exciting reasons: first, the software<br/>worked it&apos;s magic enough to transcend a too-rigid algorithmic feeling that<br/>often comes from algorithmic procedures. Secondly, you sensed a &apos;form&apos;, which<br/>I did sort of plan. The program will evolve if left alone by itself, and the<br/>major sectional shifts come from the &apos;stirring it up&apos; that the human user<br/>does to keep things interesting. One detail at the end I planned was to have<br/>the texture thin out to a single note, the specific details of which were<br/>irrelevant for me ave that the last note be one of the highet in the fade-out<br/>sequence.</p><p>So, it&apos;s exciting to me as a proof-of-concept: with the right sonic software,<br/>and the right program being manipulated real-time, there is musical and even<br/>formal power in using a quasi-algorithmic &apos;compositional&apos; approach. I think<br/>the musicality in large part came from how excellent and realistically<br/>RTSynth responds as if it were a real-life acoustic instrument made of wires<br/>and wood, which I think most feeling human beings respond to implicitely.</p><p>When I think about all this, my caveat is this: algorithmic approaches are a<br/>wonderful way of producing large amounts of material, but without &apos;editing&apos;,<br/>they will tend to sound meaningless before long. The other important thing is<br/>to pick the right algorithm from the start--one that tends to sound musical.<br/>I believe that inside subtlely varied repetition lies the key. Most crappy<br/>sounding algorithmic stuff sounds bad because there is no &apos;cognitive<br/>packaging&apos;--no way of reducing the excess of random information which tends<br/>to dull the mind into thinking it is hearing white noise and nothing else.<br/>Musical structure becomes evident through repetition (and by that I don&apos;t<br/>just mean literal repetition, but I obviously include that as well)</p><p>And of course, interesting lifelike timbres are better than crappy General<br/>MIDI ones. I can&apos;t listen to something, even something well written, if it<br/>doesn&apos;t have at least a halfway decent timbre. If the music is interesting,<br/>it might be sufficient to have only a half-good timbre. Most wavetable-type<br/>synths have shitty violins and oboes, for example. I wouldn&apos;t be caught dead<br/>using that type of sound. Quick decay sounds tend to fare better on such<br/>modules, and even though my old Korg X5-DR sucks ass for most sounds, the<br/>percussion is pretty good, even by todays standards. A sampler or wavetable<br/>synth ought to be judged on its bowed-string sound, and most fail the test<br/>miserably. Even bowed physical-models tend to suck, IMHO. RTSynth has a great<br/>struck string synthetic sound not because you are actually fooled into<br/>thinking its literally an acoustic instrument, but that it behaves in the<br/>musical way that a real instruument does in all their nuance.</p><p>One more comment--in a way, I was not constrained by 5 pitches only per<br/>octave, but aided !!!! The listener to an algorithmic piece in 5-tet I think<br/>is less aware of any algorithm than they would be in a larger ET. That&apos;s my<br/>hypothesis. We could even call it &apos;Johnson&apos;s law&apos;: evidence of mechanical<br/>procedure is directly proportional to scale size.</p><p>&gt; Would it be out of line for me to guess that this piece, and your<br/>&gt; interest in tunings based on primes 2, 3, and 7 such as LaMonte<br/>&gt; Young&apos;s, are related to one another? That&apos;s how I&apos;m hearing it,<br/>&gt; anyway. More on this below.</p><p>From what I see below this makes sense.....I&apos;m turned on by the way two<br/>intervals of ny sort of comma apart will beat--I love it! And the beating of<br/>5tet holds the same type of beauty for me.

The<br/>&gt; theoretical founding is not very solid - but maybe you can tell<br/>&gt; something from your own experience?</p><p>Sure. I&apos;ve definately fooled around with assymetrical time signatures in any<br/>of the ET&apos;s I&apos;ve improvised or composed in.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve noticed: straight lines of chromaticism, without twists and<br/>turns or a change in rhythmic value, will force a certain metrical scheme.<br/>But a composer can always force a line to fit their desired scheme by &apos;bending<br/>a line to their will&apos; by repeating a note, extending a rhythmic value,<br/>briefly changing direction, omitting notes, etc. So, in short, the effect of<br/>an ET on meter is a feature only if you choose to make it one, I guess ;)<br/>Granted, the way in which one has to side-step becomes a &apos;rhtyhmic feature&apos;, I<br/>suppose, of that tuning or temperament....</p><p>My interest in assymetrical meters is really not tied to tuning at all, but to<br/>assymetry. But in the end, sometimes a good ol&apos; 4/4 is the greatest thing for<br/>what you need to express--I try not to limit prematurely what I might want to<br/>use. In other words &apos;Kill your Buddhas&apos; and be free !!</p><p>To be honest, although your question is a provocative and interesting one,<br/>mostly, I use a particular tuning because of its harmonic resources (19tet,<br/>22tet, 31tet, and pals), and/or its non-harmonic resources (5tet,7tet and<br/>pals) without regard for its metrical implications at all, which, as I stated<br/>above, can be side-stepped!! Reading Ivor Darreg&apos;s essays have really opened<br/>my mind to exploring it all. However, life is short, and I&apos;d rather stick to<br/>a few and exhaust them and know them well than be a &apos;jack of all tunings,<br/>master of none&apos;. Prent Rodger&apos;s work with Tonality Diamonds surpasses<br/>Partch&apos;s own, if you ask me (for timbral reasons), and titillates me to try<br/>my hand at using them, esp. algorithmically (there seem to be no &apos;wrong<br/>notes&apos; ;) ). Ditto Kraig Grady&apos;s work (the small amount I have heard is<br/>*exquisite*---BTW, if you are reading this Kraig--how can I buy all of your<br/>CD&apos;s ? ) with CPSes....</p><p>And, if I hadn&apos;t found the universe too large to begin with, I ask Gene a<br/>harmless question, and he comes back with a pile of suggested scales that I<br/>now have to explore after everything else...... !!!!!!!</p><p>Ars Longa, Vide Breve, right?</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p><p>P.S. The passing thought just occured to me: perhaps the more &apos;inharmonic<br/>scales&apos; and &apos;otonal and utonal and CPSes&apos; are easier to improv and and simple<br/>algorithmicpov in than are the harmonic, extended meantone-types (19,31,etc),<br/>which by their nature, demand a precise compositional treatment of harmonic<br/>resources, or a sophisticated algorithm that would take them into account?<br/>Either way, it seems that one can pay less concern to pitch in the inharmonic<br/>ones, etc., and contruct music more abstractly and more focussed on rhythm,<br/>etc. There is a certain attraction for me in this, but I love both paradigms.<br/>I am not making a value judgement here.</p><p>______________<br/>OCEAN, n.

Very cool, and very funky, indeed.<br/>&gt; Jealousy, BTW, can be used as an incentive to improve oneself :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, like Paul, this reminds me a theoretical question that I have<br/>&gt; been thinking about a while ago.<br/>&gt; I saw on your website that you like to use asymmetrical time<br/>&gt; signatures, too - so I would like to ask whether you ever tried to<br/>&gt; make music in 5-TET tuning and uncommon time signatures - especially<br/>&gt; multiples of 5? And if yes, did you notice something special - that<br/>&gt; certain time signatures are &quot;easier&quot; to compose than others,<br/>depending<br/>&gt; on tuning?<br/>&gt; I have posted this question a while back in tuning-math (in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/4616">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/4616</a>). The<br/>&gt; theoretical founding is not very solid - but maybe you can tell<br/>&gt; something from your own experience?<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Hans Straub</p><p>***I think there is very little correlation between pitch and meter,<br/>unless one chooses to implement, specifically, a system that caters<br/>to this (say total serialization of all the parameters...)  This is<br/>one reason that composers have varied so in their strengths in either<br/>direction.  Take Schoenberg, for instance... he developed a very<br/>sophisticated notion of pitch and pitch manipulation and, yet, his<br/>rhythmic structures are, basically, the old traditional &quot;classical&quot;<br/>forms...  On the other end, composers such as Steve Reich and Philip<br/>Glass have fairly primitive pitch palettes and complex rhythmic<br/>structures.</p><p>A composer such as Brian Ferneyhough tries to have complexity in<br/>*both* the pitch and rhythmic realm, and some players seem to feel<br/>this is &quot;overkill...&quot;</p><p>So, the question remains whether increasing complexity in *both*<br/>pitch and metric realms is really a desirable attribute or not..</p><p>Also look at Partch... complex pitch, pretty simple rhythms.</p><p>Maybe at least *one* of these &quot;perception vectors&quot; has to be relaxed<br/>a bit in order for us to appreciate the other...
