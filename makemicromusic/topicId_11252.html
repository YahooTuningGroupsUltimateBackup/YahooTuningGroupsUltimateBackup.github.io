So we often hear multiple simultaneous &quot;12-EDO&quot; scales based on different frequency bases, resulting in music that, while based on 12-EDO, contains lots of intervals that you wouldn&apos;t expect to hear in that context.  And  no-one seems to mind.  To my mind, it doesn&apos;t matter much if the effect is intentional or accidental, it still expands the listeners&apos; scope of what is acceptable.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;    Most people in the West love one or more styles &gt;&gt;    of 12 EDO music, yet hate,or are at least indifferent &gt;&gt;    to other styles of 12 EDO music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is like saying,  &quot;most people in the west enjoy television with a &gt; frame rate of 30 per second&quot;  (or is it 24?  sorry can&apos;t remember. . .).  &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think the 12-EDO matters at all.
