If you had problems with the previous version then please try this one!</p><p>The new version has the same microtonal tuning features as the previous version plus a feature to defer dynamic re-tuning to the start of new notes.  There is now greater support for midi controllers including pitch bend over a variable range, modulation wheel, reverb, echo, channel volume, balance and sustain.  Other new features include a voice mixer and an accordion interface for one click chords including strummed and arpeggiated chords.  Those of you who work in non 12 note scale structures can define your own accordions!</p><p>The new version also addresses a problem which occurred with the data files in continental European locales due to a different decimal separator ( , / . ), and other minor bugs.

Sorry that I missed the discussion earlier this year about an ideal microtonal software synth, I was having trouble with my Yahoo account at that time.  Please tell me what you would like to see and I will try to incorporate it in future versions.  Some of the features in this version are in direct response to input from members of this list.  The program also contains a small number of undocumented &quot;special options&quot; that meet the request of particular users but where provision of the option adversely effects what I see as the normal operation of the program so the feature can only be turned on if you know how.  Please let me know if you have any special requests, and please buy lots of copies!</p><p>Regards to you all,<br/>Peter Frazer<br/><a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div>
