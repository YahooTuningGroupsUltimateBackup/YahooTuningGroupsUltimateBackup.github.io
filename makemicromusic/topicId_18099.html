They&apos;re<br/>currently trying to come back from the grave again, and if<br/>they can get their PC3 out the door I&apos;ll probably buy it.<br/>A big stink was made over the Nord Stage, but it&apos;s main focus<br/>is electroacoustic piano sounds.  The industry favorite<br/>seemed to be the Kawai:<br/><a href="http://www.kawaius.com/main_links/digital/mp_8.html">http://www.kawaius.com/main_links/digital/mp_8.html</a><br/>though I always thought the action (of the predecessor of the<br/>above, anyway) was too heavy.</p><p>I think it&apos;s incredibly important for microtonal musicians to<br/>elevate their production quality.

Any piano that old is<br/>actually a modern instrument (that is, rebuilt).  Oh, the wood<br/>this or that.  No, you just tend to get a good rebuild because<br/>the vintage instruments are considered valuable and therefore<br/>justify more expensive rebuilds.</p><p>Anyway, the best pianos ever made are probably Stuart &amp; Sons&apos;,<br/>with modern Faziolis and Masons close behind.

If the<br/>soundboard is original, there might be some justification for<br/>the wood theory.  Except why is old wood better?  Why isn&apos;t<br/>it worse?

It&apos;s that &apos;all the best timbre has already been taken&apos;.<br/>Except Fazoili claims otherwise -- they&apos;ve got a spruce forest<br/>in Italy that is supposed to be the best in history.  And<br/>they&apos;ve got SEM photos of the cell walls, etc. etc. to prove it.</p><p>But really pianos can&apos;t hold a candle to violins, where the<br/>theory of &apos;Stradivarius&apos; wood&apos; is explained with everything<br/>from &apos;the trees were infected by a special fungus&apos; to some<br/>magical elixir formula he had for lacquer.</p><p>Special fungus would be one explanation for all of this (nyuck<br/>nyuck).  It also makes a great sales pitch.  But there are many<br/>simpler reasons Fazioli pianos are fantastic.  I&apos;ve played quite<br/>a few rebuilt vintage Steinways (in NYC, which is the only place<br/>in the US to do it).  And they typically sound a lot like the<br/>rebuilt Steinways from the 1970s *from the same rebuilder*.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  No, you just tend to get a good rebuild because<br/>&gt;&gt; the vintage instruments are considered valuable and therefore<br/>&gt;&gt; justify more expensive rebuilds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There&apos;s a reason they are considered valuable, besides being ancy<br/>&gt;furniture. People desire *that* sound.</p><p>Nah.  Most people driving up the price of these instruments<br/>couldn&apos;t tell the sound from a tack piano.  Furniture sales have<br/>kept piano manufacturers in business for over a generation.</p><p>&gt;This is the same phenom that makes people drool over Strad fiddles.</p><p>On this I can completely agree.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Anyway, the best pianos ever made are probably Stuart &amp; Sons&apos;,<br/>&gt;&gt; with modern Faziolis and Masons close behind.

No piano on the floor came close to that<br/>&gt;sound, so I knew I had to have it.</p><p>Sorry, but all the new Steinways in Chicago (or anywhere in the<br/>midwest, and most places on the West coast) are guaranteed to<br/>sound and play like crap due to a lack of voicing and regulation.</p><p>The main change in pianos in the last 50 years is that this used<br/>to be done by dealers.  It isn&apos;t any more.  And even if a dealer<br/>wanted to do it, the art of it has basically died -- who you gonna<br/>hire?  Even at Steinway Hall, there was a clear decline from 1997<br/>to 1999 to 2001.  I am told that during this period, whatever was<br/>left of their old guard either retired or was hired away by<br/>Faust Harrison.</p><p>Pianos are NOT meant to be played out of the factory (with the<br/>exceptions of Stuart and Faz.).  Your only option is to send your<br/>new piano for a $10K Stanwood job (and many serious artists are<br/>now doing so).  A good rebuilder, however, will still take the<br/>time to voice and regulate.</p><p>Of course around the turn of the last century, the pianos probably<br/>were freaking incredible, due to the level of craftsmanship<br/>applied.

In fact, the attack sounded very<br/>&gt;wooden to me.  The result was that legato playing wasn&apos;t very<br/>&gt;legato.  Sadly, the percussiveness of the attack wasn&apos;t clear enough<br/>&gt;to render staccato chords very well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please note, I&apos;ve heard several pianists, all experienced, one of<br/>&gt;international standing, play this instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is why I have found it limited.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For the last, consider how some instruments are designed for a<br/>&gt;certain pitch, how some instruments when tuned well have a rich extra<br/>&gt;ring to them.  Consider how some inexperienced tuners can make a fine<br/>&gt;piano sound dull.  Could it be that pianos may behave in a similar<br/>&gt;fashion?  Could it be possible that a piano needs to be in tune with<br/>&gt;itself?  If various temperaments were use, perhaps the assumed<br/>&gt;temperament had an effect on the instrument and builders might have<br/>&gt;aimed at just such a special ring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is a theory which I would like to investigate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;All best wishes,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Gordon Rumson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;On 3-Dec-07, at 11:40 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You found it quite limited even though you&apos;ve never played it?<br/>&gt;&gt; The sound is also influenced by the hall -- have you heard any<br/>&gt;&gt; other pianos in that hall?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, what might also be significant is how these historic instruments<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; were tuned.

The restorer would<br/>have to be an unbiased tech who was responsible for getting the piano<br/>into it&apos;s best shape for each test.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ve only said &apos;old sounding<br/>&gt; &gt;boards&apos;...and the key is that often have to be in working order, and<br/>&gt; &gt;are often restored through expert repair of cracks by gluing, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;Mozart said in one of his letter that he prefered a certain maker that<br/>&gt; &gt;intentionally cracked his sounding boards and then glued them. It is a<br/>&gt; &gt;well known phenomenon that this can strengthen and stiffen a board,<br/>&gt; &gt;making it more reflective and resonant. Broken bones are strengthened<br/>&gt; &gt;once healed, too. Not that I would recommend going out and breaking<br/>&gt; &gt;any bones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s reasonable that breaking and gluing a soundboard could<br/>&gt; improve it.  Seems more likely to me than &apos;old wood&apos; (which is<br/>&gt; also not unreasonable, it&apos;s just that I know it can be at best<br/>&gt; the significant factor out of many involved when comparing pianos).</p><p>Well, it seems like you are hinting here that old wood might play some<br/>role, which is good to see.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The fact that others attest to the same phenomenon leads me to believe<br/>&gt; &gt;there is some truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a myth, plain and simple, unless you&apos;ve got better evidence<br/>&gt; than you&apos;ve presented to change my mind.  Perhaps I should dig<br/>&gt; up pianotech threads agreeing with me.  You can start with Del<br/>&gt; I guess<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.pianobuilders.com/soundboards.html">http://www.pianobuilders.com/soundboards.html</a></p><p>...and now you&apos;re not.</p><p>Really, I read this, and it&apos;s filled with great info, but I hardly<br/>find the salesman or spokesman for a new soundboard company to be the<br/>most objective interpreter of this phenomenon.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Many others, and an important point--they are<br/>&gt; &gt;the players and technicians who use and work with the pianos. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;know how else I would explain why so many old instruments that have<br/>&gt; &gt;been restored sound so damn good compared to new instruments.. As a<br/>&gt; &gt;test case when I bought my piano, I played the 2nd mvt of the<br/>&gt; &gt;Beethoven Pathetique--lyrical long lines, singing tone, long sustain<br/>&gt; &gt;make this piece sound best. Again, just like middle C sounded best on<br/>&gt; &gt;the 1886, so did this beautiful melody and balanced accompaniment. The<br/>&gt; &gt;other pianos were dull, flat, lifeless in comparison. My wife, not a<br/>&gt; &gt;professional musician, *immediately* said &quot;OHHH!&quot; It was extremely<br/>&gt; &gt;obvious. Your explanation is a pseudo-explanation---&apos;it&apos;s a new<br/>&gt; &gt;piano&apos;. One, that&apos;s not true, since the sounding board is 1886, the<br/>&gt; &gt;metal frame is 1886, the frame is 1886 with new finish--only the<br/>&gt; &gt;string and action are new. Two, why do so many new pianos, all else<br/>&gt; &gt;being equal, SUCK in comparison?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I already explained that in another message.  Maybe you&apos;re<br/>&gt; replying to this one first?</p><p>Well, I think we are agreeing on many things more than<br/>disagreeing...it seems, however, I put more weight into the<br/>possibility that old wood might play a big role in the sound.</p><p>I read about the fascinating theory that Stradivari violins sound good<br/>because the wood was harvested during a mini-ice age in Italy, and the<br/>wood grew stiffer and denser...just a theory, but it goes in line with<br/>the jist of what I&apos;m saying---a long complex history of an amazing<br/>material--wood--would likely impart very complex characteristics to<br/>the sound of a piano that we would interpret as &apos;rich&apos;....everything<br/>else being equal. We *know* this is true with old wine being aged in<br/>barrels--I hypothesize an analogous thing may be happening with old<br/>pianos.</p><p>-AKJ</p></div><h3><a id=18124 href="#18124">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2007 12:17:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Rick (and you) wanted proof that chemistry of wood changed<br/>&gt; with age.</p><p>Yes, thanks. Then the follow-on question would be &quot;how much age?&quot; The one<br/>article seemed to be about long-term (geological age) effects. But<br/>obviously the Gardiner et al 1993 article mentiones short-term aging. One<br/>would need, of course, to read the article, etc.</p><p>&gt; Let me clarify: my claim is that in my experience, the old<br/>&gt; pianos I&apos;ve played sounded like they had more beauty, warmth,<br/>&gt; character.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying necessarily that I disblelieve the claim, but I also find<br/>it difficult to believe that 100+ years of piano evolution since the 1880s<br/>have produced consistently inferior instruments, or that *really* &quot;old<br/>wood&quot; on its own makes a perceptible difference, or that any<br/>run-of-the-mill old piano is any better than a run-of-the-mill new piano.</p><p>&gt; So consider what I&apos;m saying as a hypothesis in need of more testing.</p><p>Sure, of course. To get any data or to establish facts about differences<br/>in pianos due to age, one would need an extensive blind taste test and some<br/>controlled pianos. Might be worth someone pursuing... but it would be a<br/>rather extensive experiment... Side-by-side instruments, identical<br/>listening conditions, same performer, same piece, etc, etc.</p><p>And... Two of the best, most character-ful instruments I&apos;ve ever played<br/>were both old. One was a Pleyel from mid-1800s.

So they shouldn&apos;t put it on.  There&apos;s no reason to<br/>&gt;&gt; have 88 on a home instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Trouble is, one cuts out an awful lot of repertoire that way, more so<br/>&gt;cutting out bass than treble...I have 85 keys on my grand, and I<br/>&gt;couldn&apos;t think of a single passage that wasn&apos;t playable, until I read<br/>&gt;through &apos;Reflets dans L&apos;eau&apos; from Debussy Images I...it goes up to the<br/>&gt;top Ab.</p><p>I think 80 is a good number.  Most keyboards are 76.  Actually<br/>if you look at sales, most keyboards today are 25.</p><p>&gt;&gt; That said, you can do a lot better<br/>&gt;&gt; with 76 or 80 than any upright out there today with the right<br/>&gt;&gt; approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Do you mean rearranging the music?</p><p>I meant you can make that low C sound better than the low C on<br/>any upright today and leave off the A, Bb, and B.</p><p>&gt;Also,<br/>&gt;it&apos;s hard to swallow Beethoven not having some of those extreme<br/>&gt;register contrast---very high and low textures at once---Brahms too.</p><p>I think Beethoven&apos;s largest piano was a 6-octave broadwood... (?)</p><p>&gt;The opposite situation should be considered, too...there are passages<br/>&gt;in Scarlatti that don&apos;t go beyond f&apos;&apos; and clearly would, given the<br/>&gt;exposition material--on a modern instrument, why not play what<br/>&gt;Scarlatti *would have done* had he had the range?</p><p>Range is good, but not when it works harm with size and cost.</p><p>&gt;As for grands in the home, I think with the right room, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;wonderful, even if boomy.</p><p>Can be.  Carpet is pretty much a necessity.  My grandmother had<br/>a big room with real wool wall-to-wall carpet and cherry panelling.<br/>Her baby grand sounded fantastic in there.

There, what I wondered is whether it is to do with the sound vibrations themselves traveling through the wood.  The idea would be that as the sound travels through the wood it deforms it slightly then the wood springs back again. Over a period of time with that happening many times then you would expect the wood to be affected in some way, mechanically, wood fibres just slightly shifting about to let the sound at many frequencies travel through the wood more easily, at any rate loads of movement at the molecular level surely - so making the wood more resonant and richer in sound e.g. richer in the higher harmonics.</p><p>It could be tested, do old pianos sound better if they have been played a lot than they do if they have been just kept in someones shed or seldom played for a century? I have a feeling they might. And it might also depend on how they are played as well if it is mechanical changes due to the sound vibrations passing through the wood, maybe a good player might end up with a better piano as a result of the wide range of note voumes they play for instance, e.g. if they play lots of pianissimo and fortissimo type notes then that may have a different effect from an amateur who tends to play with much less of a dynamic range plonk plonk plonk style.</p><p>Even the rhythms played could affect it as well if it is mechanical and to do with the way the fibres respond to movement of the wood..</p><p>Just another idea to enter into the mix.</p><p>Robert</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=18141 href="#18141">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2007 9:36:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/packages/yamaha_p200.sfArk">http://www.akjmusic.com/packages/yamaha_p200.sfArk</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Never mind with the zip format.
