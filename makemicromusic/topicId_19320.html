However,<br/>as of today, the Wikipedia entries for Bach, Frederick the Great,<br/>and The Musical Offering all claim it occurred (though without<br/>citations).  Maybe Daniel W. or another scholar here knows more.<br/>I do recall that most sources said he only improvised a 3-voice<br/>fugue on the theme at the time, with the six-voice fugue being<br/>composed later.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
