If I could get a good<br/>idea by Jan. 15 or so who&apos;s interested I could make further plans from<br/>there.</p><p>If there is a lot of music just for pianos that you want to write and<br/>have tried out, I want to have a phase two-and-a-half recording<br/>session (not concert).  Already an unplayed piece by Tom Price waiting<br/>on this effort.</p><p>So, figure yourself out by Jan. 15.</p><p>Speaking of udderbot, <a href="http://www.udderbot.com">www.udderbot.com</a> is at week 2 of existence. It<br/>is quite the infant. I hope to soon add sound files and a composer&apos;s<br/>guide to writing for the instrument so I can begin asking y&apos;all for<br/>microtonal udderbot pieces!</p><p>In the meantime, suck on this miniature march for 17-tone pianos 8<br/>hands played last Monday:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/17tpp/onward1.mp3">www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/17tpp/onward1.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>and score:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/17tpp/onward.pdf">www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jbarton/17tpp/onward.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s recorded at a low level that will no doubt sound terrible on your<br/>computer speakers. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s that great and you shouldn&apos;t<br/>either!
