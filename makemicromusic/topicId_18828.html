The tuning<br/>capabilities of Kurzweils (and similar) from at least the K1200 onwards<br/>are mainly responsible for my microtonal research findings concerning<br/>12-note subsets of any equal temperament. I originally worked out the<br/>fundamental design of my algorithm in 1993 using an Atari 1040ST, a<br/>Kurzweil K1200 and Notator software. Things haven&apos;t changed very much<br/>regarding my methods. Substitute a Windows XP, a Kurzweil K2500R, a<br/>midi interface and any old software that comes along and voila! you get<br/>a home entertainment microtonal system.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2008 10:54:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert thomas martin&quot;<br/>&lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No doubt there are many free and inexpensive ways to implement<br/>&gt; microtonality on a home computer but I&apos;m not sure if there are many<br/>&gt; cheap ways of implementing my musical algorithms.</p><p>If all you are doing is retuning collections of 12 pitches and<br/>assigning them to the traditional 12 steps of Western diatonic music,<br/>there are many ways to do it, and you don&apos;t have to end up buying<br/>another piece of hardware. You say &quot;musical algorithms&quot;, but all I&apos;ve<br/>seen are lists of pitches (frequencies), to be substituted for the<br/>corresponding 12tet pitches. If I&apos;m completely off the mark, please<br/>forgive me, and I&apos;ll take a tutorial on your forum.</p><p>I realize what you have posted as a solution is what has worked for<br/>*you*. I&apos;m hoping you&apos;ll see that - even as a means to your particular<br/>algorithmic end - there are *alternative* ways as well, including some<br/>maybe less costly. Not better, just different.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
