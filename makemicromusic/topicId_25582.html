The PVA marched &quot;dark-to-dark&quot; (19:00Â–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers might shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 286 miles (460 km) from An-tung, Manchuria to the combat zone in some 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging 18 miles (29 km) daily for 18 days.</p><p>Not having been in harms way I have difficulty imagining what it must be like for any soldier, especially for a country whose officer&apos;s might shoot you and viewed you as cannon fodder destined for human wave attacks against the United Nations positions.</p><p>Not knowing much about real Chinese music I associate this piece, Crossing the Yalu River (1950)<br/>Download<br/>with that march of the common Chinese soldier.<br/>The tuning used is Centaur A 7-CAP tuning by Kraig Grady.</p><p>The piece is scored for orchestral percussion, Chinese Gongs, Choazhou Guzheng, Bawu, Datangu Lion Drum, Choir, and double bass in Sonar X1 and realized via the Garritan Personal Orchestra and World sample sets.</p></div>
