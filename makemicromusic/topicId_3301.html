FM7)</h1><h3><a id=3301 href="#3301">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 8:13:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think sample-playback synths are good for<br/>&gt;&gt; microtonality, which (I<br/>&gt;&gt; believe) by it&apos;s nature requires pure synthesis - FM,<br/>&gt;&gt; additive, physical<br/>&gt;&gt; modeling, analog, whatever. My perception is that it&apos;s purer from<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental to overtones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While &apos;pure&apos; synthesis solves some of the problems you mention,<br/>&gt; I think you<br/>&gt; need to open up to the wide possibilities of music that can be done<br/>&gt; microtonally. And I say that specifically because we&apos;ve had<br/>&gt; examples from<br/>&gt; people on this list that extensively use samples, both for emulation of<br/>&gt; real instruments (Prent Rodgers) and for morphing into new territories<br/>&gt; (Bill Sethares / Jacky Ligon) and everything in between.</p><p>No, no, I agree ! Big open mind here. Perhaps too open, neurons<br/>sometime seem to fire into empty space ;)</p><p>I said, &quot;more realistically, like actual acoustic instruments,<br/>which is a good thing if you happen to write for acoustic<br/>instruments&quot;.</p><p>Meaning that in an ideal world, using a (good) physical model,<br/>or other pure synthesis emulation, of an acoustic/real<br/>instrument would be preferable to using samples of said<br/>instruments.</p><p>But, sample-playback &quot;synthesis&quot; cannot go away soon enough, as<br/>far as I&apos;m concerned.</p><p>That would leave sampling as the tool of choice for Musique<br/>Concr&egrave;te related &amp; other inspirations involving the manipulation<br/>of real-world sounds. This includes Wavetable synthesis, as used<br/>in Waldorf&apos;s Microwave machines, or the more recent, Granular<br/>synthesis, etc.</p><p>Anyone curious about Wavetable synthesis look here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.harmony-central.com/Synth/Articles/Wavetable_101/">http://www.harmony-central.com/Synth/Articles/Wavetable_101/</a>&gt;,<br/>and if you&apos;re not yet curious, listen to Waldorf&apos;s demos on the<br/>product pages at &lt;<a href="http://www.waldorf-gmbh.de">http://www.waldorf-gmbh.de</a>&gt;. Relevant to<br/>microtonality however, I don&apos;t know if any of the Microwaves<br/>(other than possibly the &quot;Wave&quot; beastie)  allow for the<br/>remapping of samples.</p><p>&gt; They are all tools, and some may require more work, but in the<br/>&gt; right hands<br/>&gt; music will occur.<br/>Very True, and my intention is to neither demean nor look down<br/>on people who get the job done with the tools they have access<br/>to. I use a Korg NS5R for my humble sonic scribbling. But, I<br/>plan to replace it with a used TX-802, *if* NI doesn&apos;t get<br/>128-note full MIDI tuning tables into FM7 in the mean time.</p><p>I recently came across one of the most idiotic articles I have<br/>ever seen by Tom White (President &amp; CEO of the MIDI<br/>Manufacturers Association, MMA). Dating from 1996, the editorial<br/>is entitled, &quot;FM Synthesis is dead&quot;. Perhaps we have myopic<br/>twits like him to thank for the MIDI Tuning Standard being such<br/>a well kept secret. &lt;<a href="http://www.midi.org/newsviews/fm.htm">http://www.midi.org/newsviews/fm.htm</a>&gt; Ooh,<br/>look where it&apos;s hosted !</p><p>Too many stupid articles seem to imply that FM is mostly &quot;good<br/>for making noises&quot;.</p><p>One can no more exhaust the potential of FM synthesis than you<br/>can exhaust the musical potential of the violin. Even<br/>experimenting with 2-operator software implementation can<br/>demonstrate this.</p><p>Anyone with a Mac should try this delightful little stand-alone<br/>application (built in Max/MSP) I came upon while looking up info<br/>on Max/MSP. I don&apos;t have the page URL at hand, but the file is<br/>at &lt;<a href="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~phillipm/E-A_MusicPrimer.sit">http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~phillipm/E-A_MusicPrimer.sit</a>&gt;,<br/>about 532kb. It demonstrates FM, Additive, etc. For anyone who<br/>hasn&apos;t experienced first hand what these synthesis methods are<br/>potentially capable off, I strongly recommend you try this out.</p><p>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=3326 href="#3326">ðŸ”—</a>prentrodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2002 8:57:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joel wrote: &quot;<br/>&gt;But, sample-playback &quot;synthesis&quot; cannot go away soon enough,<br/>&gt; as far as I&apos;m concerned.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the complaint.

I don&apos;t discount for one second the achievements made in the sample-playback arena. It&apos;s not so much a complaint as much as it is an observation. Sample-playback &quot;synthesis&quot; for the purpose of emulating acoustic &amp; electric instruments is a fudge.</p><p>Would anyone looking for organ &amp; analog synth sounds choose samples over currently available modeling instruments ? There are people here or perhaps on the *other* list that use the VL-70m &amp; the Oasys PCI, perhaps they can offer their opinion on the physical modeling sounds available to them.</p><p>I have briefly encountered IRCAM&apos;s Modalys (as yet) non-real-time physical modeling synthesis software for the Mac OS. It makes incredible sounds and is a great deal more advanced &amp; complex in comparison to the method discovered/invented by Stanford &amp; used by Yamaha &amp; Korg. If &amp; when Modalys becomes a real-time system, it will have enormous impact. See &lt;<a href="http://www.ircam.fr/">http://www.ircam.fr/</a>&gt;</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t you like to be able to compose manipulating a virtual piano in which you could whimsically manipulate the material the strings are made of, their dimensions, their tension, the wood the piano is built of, the tuning of each virtual string&apos;s fundamental &amp; harmonics, the material the hammers are made of, where the microphones are placed, etc. ?</p><p>Can you imagine how handy this could be for someone designing an acoustic or electric microtonal instrument ?</p><p>Modalys can do this right now, but not in real-time, unfortunately. It&apos;s amazing. I remember when I first tried it out, I was trying to make a drum sound, any drum sound &amp; it wouldn&apos;t work. I e-mailed IRCAM, &amp; someone responded telling me that my microphone &amp; beater placement were physically *impossible* &amp; would not make a sound, so I changed a wee bit of code &amp; the most incredibly realistic badly designed &amp; tuned bass drum sound came rumbling thourgh my crappy speakers.</p><p>Physical modeling holds great promise, which is being held back, perhaps by processor speeds &amp; misguided commercial interests. Even some publications which should know better routinely judge synths on polyphony &amp; multitimbrality &amp; I&apos;m sure this puts pressure on manufacturers to keep churning out generic character-less instruments with ever more pointlessly impressive specs.</p><p>I&apos;m sure many people expected great things after Yamaha&apos;s VL-1 appeared on the scene, but after all these years all that remains is the VL-70m (@ US$500 I think). Korg built the Z-1, then the Oasys PCI card, &amp; now all that remains is their MOSS board for their overpriced Triton instruments. I think Yamaha has a software physical modeling synth available for the Windows OS. Try &lt;<a href="http://www.yamaha.co.uk/">http://www.yamaha.co.uk/</a>&gt; for Yamaha info &amp; &lt;<a href="http://www.korg.co.uk">http://www.korg.co.uk</a>&gt; for Korg info.</p><p>&gt; I admit that I have not spent any time working with physical modeling<br/>&gt; synthesizers. Do you have example music I could listen to? Csound<br/>&gt; supports this, and many Csound fans have asked me to move to Csound<br/>&gt; orchestras that don&apos;t require integration and purchase of the sample<br/>&gt; libraries I use. I have no idea where to start, or the confidence<br/>&gt; that it would be worth the effort when I have a good sample library<br/>&gt; now.</p><p>Can&apos;t think of anything off-hand, sorry. There must be demos at Yamaha &amp; Korg&apos;s websites though. Composers have used Modalys. In my limited experience Csound doesn&apos;t lend itself to intuitive musical use. It is brilliant to teach/learn DSP techniques though. Perhaps you should try &amp; get your paws on a Yamaha VL-70m &amp; see what happens.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Prent Rodgers<br/>&gt; Freezing in Seattle</p><p>Sorry about the length of this. Well there isn&apos;t much traffic on the list right now...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>- Joel</p></div>
