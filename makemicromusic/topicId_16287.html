Don&apos;t think of it as<br/>music, instead think of it as something I put together as I was<br/>learning how to use the program, how to work around its bugs, and also<br/>learning to use a scale I had never used before. The music will come<br/>later.</p><p><a href="http://rozencrantz.googlepages.com/Sketchin300.tonescape">http://rozencrantz.googlepages.com/Sketchin300.tonescape</a></p><p>The form is a perpetual canon that transposes down one semitone every<br/>repetition, so that if you repeat it 300 times it will play through<br/>all 300 keys. The basis is 300-edo, the generators are alternating<br/>700c and 704c fifths. I picked this tuning because it makes thirds<br/>more dissonant and ninths more consonant compared to meantone, because<br/>it makes sense to my ears, and because it works well in 300-edo.</p><p><a href="http://rozencrantz.googlepages.com/Zig-zag24.tuning">http://rozencrantz.googlepages.com/Zig-zag24.tuning</a></p><p>I like this tuning a lot, it&apos;s familiar enough that I can build<br/>melodies in it, and the near-just fifths and ninths make up the<br/>harmonies that sound best to me.</p><p>--Tristan<br/><a href="http://dolor-sit-amet.deviantart.com">http://dolor-sit-amet.deviantart.com</a></p></div>
