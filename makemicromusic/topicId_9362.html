where any rectangular subset of the fretboard -- from<br/>&gt; one button to the whole fretboard, and every rectangle<br/>&gt; in between -- can bet set as a zone, on its own MIDI channel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i just haven&apos;t had the time to really play around with<br/>&gt; it as much as i want to ... i&apos;m in the midst of converting<br/>&gt; all 700+ webpages in the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia to our<br/>&gt; new webpage format, and along with the rest of the company<br/>&gt; am working hard to make sure that release 1.0 of Musica<br/>&gt; comes out this summer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have my Ztar plugged into a Yamaha TX81z, which i did<br/>&gt; indeed buy on Ebay.  the TX81z has 768-edo resolution<br/>&gt; (1.5625 cents), and allows each MIDI-note to be mapped<br/>&gt; to any degree of 768-edo within a range of several octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anyway, thanks for the helpful suggestions.  i&apos;m really<br/>&gt; just too busy to mess around with it right now ... but<br/>&gt; it will be fun making the Ztar and the TX interface with<br/>&gt; Musica when the time comes for that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS -- belated congrats on your new family member!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p></div><h3><a id=9384 href="#9384">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2005 3:02:18 PM</span><button style="float: right;

the TX81Z from Scala or some other software.</p><p>not yet.  i found a freeware TX81Z editor, and it does<br/>allow the user to edit and dump tuning tables ... but<br/>unfortunately, its default operation dumps a table as<br/>soon as it&apos;s opened on the computer screen.  it&apos;s easy<br/>enough to change the default so that it doesn&apos;t do that,<br/>but by the time i found out about it it was too late ...<br/>it had already wiped out the 72-edo mapping which i had<br/>slowly and painfully entered via the TX&apos;s front panel.<br/>that pissed me off so much that i haven&apos;t looked at that<br/>editor software since then, nor have i played my Ztar<br/>since then.</p><p>i don&apos;t have a problem just putting the Ztar stuff on<br/>the back burner for right now ... we at Tonalsoft are<br/>determined to stick to our current release schedule<br/>(the date has already been pushed back 3 times), so<br/>work on that must progress. all of you microtonal/xenharmonic<br/>brother and sisters will be happy about that decision.<br/>:-)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=9387 href="#9387">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2005 7:44:49 PM</span><button style="float: right;

can be tuned<br/>&gt; independently, so you can set up any fret correspondence you<br/>&gt; like ... except the one i want, which would require each<br/>&gt; adjacent pair of &quot;open strings&quot; to be tuned 2 octaves apart.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you can do this.</p><p>&gt; i can&apos;t do this simply because the Ztar&apos;s front-panel controls<br/>&gt; will not allow me to tune the &quot;open strings&quot; to a range beyond<br/>&gt; C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 ... so the greatest uniform fret-correspondence<br/>&gt; distance i can get is 12 frets. when i use this &quot;open string&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning and map a 72-edo tuning table to the MIDI-notes, i<br/>&gt; get one complete octave of 72-edo, plus another 60 notes of<br/>&gt; the same 72-edo pitches on the 5 higher &quot;strings&quot;, plus another<br/>&gt; 12 frets on the &quot;lowest string&quot; which i can use for anything<br/>&gt; i&apos;d like.  but for my purposes, i&apos;m wasting almost half of<br/>&gt; the Ztar fretboard.</p><p>I have a Z6 with the old software, but this looks familiar.  It&apos;s also in a different continent, as I told you last night.  But from what I remember, there&apos;s a transposition feature as well as the open string tunings.  If you combine the two, you can get the full MIDI range. Perhaps you need zones for this.</p><p>&gt; i had also hoped to be able to map one octave of a &gt; 144-tone 5-limit JI lattice to the Ztar, but again, the &gt; fret-correspondence &quot;feature&quot; prohibits that.</p><p>The 128 note MIDI limit prohibits that.  You have to use multiple channels, which is easy for the ZTar.  More of a challenge on the TZ81Z ... you can get some scales to work by transposing ... but it&apos;s easier to stick with the 128.  Sequencers are a pig with either method.  With a single channel, the notes jump all over place ... or maybe the Microsoft MIDI Mapper can fix this, if it&apos;s still around.  With multiple channels, it&apos;s a pain to change them or draw in notes.</p><p>Rather than shelving your ZTar in favor of the software, I suggest you get something running on multiple channels for testing.</p><p>Oh yes, Kyma works fine for playing multiple channels, with the proviso that the polyphony has to be a multiple of the number of channels, which affects performance.  I&apos;m guessing CSound would be even better, but I&apos;m not sure how the MIDI mapping works.  Your software could translate to any real-time tuning method, of course, and so raise the MIDI tuning bar to 2048 notes.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=9389 href="#9389">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2005 10:29:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Graham,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; monz wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i had also hoped to be able to map one octave of a<br/>&gt; &gt; 144-tone 5-limit JI lattice to the Ztar, but again, the<br/>&gt; &gt; fret-correspondence &quot;feature&quot; prohibits that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 128 note MIDI limit prohibits that.</p><p>duh ... right, of course.  i meant a 128-note lattice.<br/>which leaves 16 Ztar buttons for other things.</p><p>&gt; Rather than shelving your ZTar in favor of the software,<br/>&gt; I suggest you get something running on multiple channels<br/>&gt; for testing.</p><p>it&apos;s not really that i&apos;m &quot;shelving the Ztar in favor of<br/>the software&quot; ... just that we are holding to our plans<br/>for commercial release of the software by this summer,<br/>and i don&apos;t have time to fool around with the Ztar.</p><p>i had programmed 72-edo into the TX81Z so that i could<br/>at least play with the Ztar a bit, but when that editor<br/>software zapped it, i just put the whole setup away for<br/>awhile.</p><p>but we will be testing as much hardware as we can get<br/>our hands on, with our software, and the Ztar will<br/>certainly be a test instrument.  we just have to get<br/>the computer-only release 1.0 out the door.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=9470 href="#9470">ðŸ”—</a>eucharistikos &#x3C;est@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2005 7:27:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;harold_fortuin&quot; &lt;harold@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t own this device, but given my experience setting up key-MIDI<br/>&gt; note correspondences with devices like my Clavette and Starr&apos;s<br/>&gt; Microzone, I would think there&apos;s some way to work around your<br/>&gt; problem.</p><p>I&apos;m curious what your Microzone experience has been like.
