One of my<br/>&gt;close colleagues here in SD is married to Peter Otto, who (at UCSD) is doing<br/>&gt;ground-breaking work with spacialization and related mixing work with Max. She<br/>&gt;remarked at a concert the other night that Peter was home &quot;working on some new<br/>&gt;flocking algorithm&quot;, and I&apos;ve heard some of his real-time spacialization work<br/>&gt;it is *awesome*.</p><p>Jon,</p><p>All I know is whats on the cycling74 website - where they<br/>say that a PC version is &quot;under development&quot;. Max is a great tool,<br/>and there are very cool visualization tools as well as audio.<br/>Hopefully, when the PC version does materialize, most of the<br/>extent (Mac-Max) programs will work...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
