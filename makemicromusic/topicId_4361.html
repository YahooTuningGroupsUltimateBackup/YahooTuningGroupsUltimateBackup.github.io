What do  I<br/>need   to  begin  hearing and notating scales with  microtones?</p><p>I  currently have  a Yamaha PSR-340, Allegro   2001,     Scala,<br/>and Fractal   Tune   Smithy.   My  sound  cards  (Roland and Crystal<br/>Wave) fail  the pitch  bend test.   I  run under windows  98 on an<br/>Intel  Celeron   533M Hz.</p><p>I  work  by listening to  ideas on  the   keyboard, notating  them<br/>and then  listening to them being played from the notation.  I change<br/>the notation and playback a lot.  I  need something like the<br/>&quot;play back  range&quot; feature found in Allegro.</p><p>Since only 7 of the 22 tones in Karnatic music are used in a<br/>particular raga, it grieves me that Allegro doesn&apos;t support user<br/>defined microtonal keys and why my Yamaha can&apos;t (as far as I<br/>know) be told what frequency each key should play.  But I digress.</p><p>I would appreciate  being pointed in the right direction.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Jim N.</p></div>
