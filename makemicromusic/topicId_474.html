It works with<br/>&gt;VST and DX pluggies, and has a bunch-o-cool stuff you can do with<br/>&gt;the &quot;Master Section&quot;.</p><p>Good tip. I hadn&apos;t done the recent upgrade to SF, so I&apos;ll take a look at WaveLab. Mary&apos;s new computer, BTW, is a PC, so she may have more tips for us on the Wintel platform in the future...</p><p>J</p></div>
