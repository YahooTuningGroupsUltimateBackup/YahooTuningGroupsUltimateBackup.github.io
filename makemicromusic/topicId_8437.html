The first one is an attempt to make the design<br/>uniform, so that the keyboard ascends by 3 steps horizontally and 1<br/>step vertically. Using traditional keyshapes and a one-dimensional<br/>(more or less) layout, this causes the octaves to be staggered and<br/>the design to repeat at 3 octaves instead of at one. However, using<br/>my suggested color scheme, I think confusion can easily be avoided,<br/>though if anyone can think of a better scheme please let me know (not<br/>that I&apos;m even preferring this layout right now; it&apos;s just an idea).<br/>Note that this is NOT based exactly on a porcupine scale.</p><p>The second one is a slightly older one, an improvement on my first<br/>Porcupine keyboard. Now it is based on a C porcupine-8 scale, and<br/>there is a fourth row of duplicate white keys above. It&apos;s more for<br/>reference to compare the 3-octave uniform design to than anything<br/>else--to help weigh out the pros and cons of both.</p><p>The third and last one is basically exactly the same as my first<br/>porcupine design (in that it&apos;s based on a G+ porcupine-8 scale), but<br/>now the keys are colored according to accidentals. White for<br/>naturals, blue for flats, black for semi-sharps, and red for sharps.<br/>I&apos;m not sure I really like it, I&apos;d imagine most people would be more<br/>confused by it than they would by a general keyboard, though it might<br/>be of use to someone who is familiar with the temperament. I highly<br/>doubt we will actually use such a color scheme though.</p><p>I should also make note of the musical alphabet I use for 22.<br/>Chromatically, my alphabet is C Db C+/D- C# D Eb D+/E- D# E F Gb F+/G-<br/>F# G Ab G+/A- G# A Bb A+/B- A# B C. Though if Porcupine-8 is used<br/>as the basis for tonality, I&apos;d use C C# Db D D# Eb E F F# Gb G G# Hb<br/>H H# Ab A A# Bb B B# Cb C, so that all the natural notes form a C<br/>Porcupine-8 &quot;major&quot; scale.</p><p>Also, I am working on some other ideas not ready to be posted yet,<br/>both of which were suggested to me by Paul Erlich.  One is based on<br/>his proposed 10-white-12-black design, which is split into two sets<br/>of 5-w-6-b. The other is an attempt to refine my original design #1,<br/>which is based on diatonic ideas.  This will likely be of a similar<br/>lattice-meets-traditional design as the porcupine-8 based ones.  I&apos;ll<br/>post these when done.  Right now, I&apos;m just going to hash out as many<br/>ideas as I can, and then maybe you all can help decide which one<br/>would be the most efficient.</p><p>If anyone has their own ideas, please feel free to upload them.<br/>Diagrams help lots!!</p><p>Thanks thanks thanks<br/>-igliashon</p></div>
