I would start with the music itself, and the intonations music has historically demanded.  I made a pedagogical proposal several years ago that musicians should learn, in parallel with historical/theoretical and practical studies, to play in the most important tuning regimes of the repertoire relevant to the individual musician.  Thus, a western classical musician should know how to perform in some subset of the following: pythagorean, meantone, some &quot;general&quot; well-temperament, and 12-tet.  Simultaneously, they should learn, from singing if possible,  JI intervals through 7 or 11, and to tune to cent deviations from 12tet pitches.</p><p>&gt; JI intervals certainly have their own sort of pleasure;  but --- to<br/>&gt; bring up a possible point amongst Mclaren&apos;s endless invectives, what<br/>&gt; evidence is there that JI intervals are &quot;preferred&quot; by people<br/>&gt; outside of Western-Europe/USA circles, and those so influenced?</p><p>I think I speak for all of us who use JI intervals as a point of reference, that that point of reference is always qualified by the assumption of harmonic timbres etc..

Rather, it&apos;s a pragmatic compromise allowing the Thai to transpose their unequal 5-tone scale to seven degrees of a fixed tuning.</p><p>I haven&apos;t ever heard of any kalimbas in 5-limit JI --  are you certain  of  a reference for this?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure. . . most cultures have something like a 5th,  something like a<br/>&gt; 4th, various kinds of 3rds,  etc.  But &quot;something like&quot; is a long<br/>&gt; way from &quot;3/2&quot; or &quot;6/5&quot;.</p><p>Here&apos;s a short answer: Consider the fact that the apparatus we use for putting music into our brains is largely the same as that we use for putting (audible) speech into our brains.   The perception  of speech depends in part upon analysing signals with exact harmonic spectra, and apparently the  lower end of  the spectra where relationships can be chacterized by ratios of small whole numbers. This is not the place for a debate on the origins of music, but it is probably safe to say that vocal utterances are one of the most important origins, and their harmonic character is not subject to debate.</p><p>Yes, there are music cultures where the intervals appear to deviate strongly from a JI model, but a second or third look, as in the Thai example above, may show the rational heart of an irrational surface.   The Thai  may well  have taken  a vocal pythagorean or  just pentatonic scale and , through years if not centuries of trial-and-error, made it fit into the 7-tet environment.   And when an irrational tuning like 7-tet is impressed onto an ensemble of idiophones and gongs, then the tolerance for a deviation from a JI tuning is greatly increased.  (I have a studio full of gamelan instruments to back me up on this -- <a href="http://www.world-edition.com/world/malvear/pages/books/generatio/wolf.htm">http://www.world-edition.com/world/malvear/pages/books/generatio/wolf.htm</a> -- each individual gong in my bonang or each key on a metallophone has a noticeably different spectrum.)  &quot;Something like&quot; is indeed very much a part of our musical lives, which we live as if we still navigated via flat earth coordinates.  (I happen to like this situation...)</p><p>&gt; Again . .

I don&apos;t think the<br/>elimination of beating is one of the main points of attraction about<br/>JI. Even a minor sixth in JI exhibits beating, as Julia Werntz loves<br/>to point out. But we&apos;ve clearly extended this topic way too far for<br/>the purpose and disposition of this list. Please, Chris, Daniel,<br/>*me*, let&apos;s take it to one of the other lists. I&apos;ll be replying to<br/>one of Gene&apos;s posts here on the tuning list.</p><p>Now back to your regularly-scheduled music-making . . .</p></div><h3><a id=6400 href="#6400">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 10:27:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Again . .

Read the above again.<br/>&gt;<br/>I undestood this, I was just underscoring the point that no serious scholar or musician has ever made such a claim.  I have, unfortunately, heard this type of critique of the JI project far too often, that the JI advocates are claiming to have found JI where it&apos;s not to be found.  That said, the JI project is  a speculative one, and I believe African musicians would happily accept a JI-tuned lamellophone. They might not hear anything special in it,  but they would accept it as _one_ solution. (Similarly:  I had the honor this week of a visit by Ki Manteb Soedharsono, one of the greatest living dalangs (shadow puppet masters) from central  Java.  He needed some  instruments to supplement those in the Indonesian Embassy here for a performance  in honor of the Indonesian Wayang being elevated by UNESCO to the status of &quot;masterpiece of world cultural heritage&quot;.  My gamelan is not in JI, but a kind of temperament from JI, but the octaves are exactly 2:1.   Ki Manteb was full of enthusiasm for the tuning, saying that it was both sweet and powerful.)</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=6403 href="#6403">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2004 10:59:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>ZipZapPooZoo wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But surely there is music out there in harmonic timbres that isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; Just Tuned?<br/>&gt;<br/>of course, but...</p><p>&gt; Like those African pan-pipe ensembles,  where the &quot;harmony&quot;<br/>&gt; seems to be (to my untrained ears) magnificent clusters, thick<br/>&gt; wads of sound. &gt;<br/>analysis the spectrum of a pan pipe: it&apos;s basically a sine wave plus a lot of noise. Sine waves can be collected into any partial structure you like, making them ideal for Sethares-style mixtures.  When I was in Guatamala in &apos;84, I visited an electronic music studio that had only two pieces of electronic equipment: a microphone and a tape recorder.  They used acoustical sources to simulate electronic sounds, and pan pipes figured highly in the mix. DJW</p></div>
