In terms of scale steps, your<br/>scale goes [2,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,1]. The ratio large step/small step is<br/>of course 2. For 46, this would be [5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2], with a<br/>ratio of 2.5; for 65, [7,7,3,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,3] with a ratio of 2.333.</p></div><h3><a id=6581 href="#6581">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2004 10:10:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t subscribe to Tuning anymore - too much to do to read yet<br/>&gt;more<br/>&gt; mails.</p><p>Understood -- though things are very slow there, I can&apos;t fault you<br/>for this. I&apos;d love to continue a theory conversation with you<br/>*somewhere*, though, if even in private e-mail -- all I know is that<br/>this isn&apos;t the place for it. But I will mix a little theory in below,<br/>so I apologize to all.</p><p>&gt; I will say that the 46EDO representation I reject because its<br/>&gt; chromatic intervals in the 11 note scale are larger than the<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; ones, within that scale.

This is based on<br/>listening to Blackwood and playing myself, but I know George and<br/>Margo agree. Harmony is precarious at best but the melodic and<br/>modulatory properties sound close to ideal to me -- or at least they<br/>evoke some powerful feelings in my heart. Historically and<br/>geographically, the diatonic scale in Pythagorean tuning has been<br/>very important, despite the fact that its chromatic semitone is<br/>slightly larger than its diatonic semitone.</p><p>With the semisixths[11] scale, I have a lot less experience, but<br/>semisixths came up as an interesting temperament for 5-limit harmony<br/>and one of the three or four *most* interesting for 7-limit. It looks<br/>to me as if, either way, the harmonically optimal tuning is such that<br/>19-, 27-, and 46-tone &apos;generalized diatonic&apos; scales from this<br/>temperament have large step : small step approximately in the golden<br/>ratio. The 11-tone scale, though, has harmonically optimal steps of<br/>131 and 50 cents; one mode is<br/>131+50+131+131+131+50+131+131+131+50+131. On Wednesday, I&apos;m going to<br/>try to mess with this *melodically* and see if it doesn&apos;t evoke any<br/>feelings for me.</p><p>Hopefully I&apos;ll also have some 15-equal lunacy to share with the list<br/>at that point.</p></div><h3><a id=6588 href="#6588">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2004 11:18:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; With the semisixths[11] scale, I have a lot less experience, but<br/>&gt; semisixths came up as an interesting temperament for 5-limit harmony<br/>&gt; and one of the three or four *most* interesting for 7-limit.
