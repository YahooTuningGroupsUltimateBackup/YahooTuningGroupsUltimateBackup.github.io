Hopefully<br/>you will get a useful error message from Windows via FTS<br/>if it doesn&apos;t open. Another thing that happens is that<br/>sometimes there are no devices listed at all on the In menu<br/>- but that normally means there are no midi in devices on the computer<br/>(not just that one of the soundcards has no midi in device on it).</p><p>If you&apos;ve got it working with Midi Relay then there should be<br/>some midi in devices for FTS to find hopefully.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=3173 href="#3173">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2002 8:33:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt; ara is still struggling with that. it turned out the help screens<br/>&gt; used a font that was illegible on his computer, and he was not able<br/>&gt; to view them in a different format or save them as text files. i told<br/>&gt; him to ask robert walker for text files of those help screens.</p><p>That&apos;s ironic.</p><p>I used Verdana instead of Times New Roman because it is a particularly<br/>clear font - Serif fonts are best for typed material but non serif<br/>fonts are best for on-line pages as they are easier to read on a<br/>screen.</p><p>I expect it is a matter of specifying a secondary font<br/>in the font tag for those who don&apos;t happen to have it<br/>- I think you can just say non-serif.
