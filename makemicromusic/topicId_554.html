First rehearsal sucked, second reh was bearable, dress I realized I could do it, finally.</p><p>But I digress...</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;The opening handful of measures that kickoff &quot;The Dreamer That Remains&quot; is &gt;probably still my single favorite Partch moment</p><p>...and I realize I&apos;ve not been clear, because the progression I was speaking is used in the *film*, and the beginning of the actual piece &quot;Dreamer&quot; comes later.</p><p>But, yes, I liked that. Let me know if you haven&apos;t *seen* Dreamer, and we&apos;ll fix it, but that &apos;G&apos; tuning fork is an isolated shot in the film, and very emblematic of Harry, his 1/1, and all. I drove HP to and from some of the mixing sessions for the soundtrack/recording, and he was enchanted by a professional 8-track studio (circa 1971).</p><p>&gt;Still have this one on vinyl from way back too... it&apos;s a great dry and &gt;solidly woody recording btw, one of my favorites in that regard as well.</p><p>I can actually pass that along to the engineer, who I am still in touch with...</p><p>&gt;Okay, enough mushy stuff, I promise...</p><p>This place ain&apos;t about Mom, though she is always proud of her kids (like someone who is now successfully uploading mp3 files... &lt;g&gt;)</p><p>With gratitude,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=563 href="#563">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

They all were about corporealism,<br/>and Philip Blackburn (in his Microfest 2001 lecture) showed how<br/>really personal were so many of Partch&apos;s references to his musical<br/>influences, but none (to me) reach deep down and touch his<br/>own life the way _Dreamer_ does.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
