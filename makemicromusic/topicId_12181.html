The question is, could this be done so that<br/>&gt;performers would be willing to perform it?</p><p>Performers shouldn&apos;t have to know anything about the ET.  They have<br/>a computer version to listen to, they have accidentals that tell them<br/>the rough locations of the pitches.  Ideally they would have monitors<br/>or headphones, at least for rehearsal, in which they could create<br/>their own mix of the live sound and the various parts of the computer<br/>version.</p><p>Whether you can find any willing performers is a question.  You&apos;ll<br/>need a human-readable score first, then shop it in the manner Daniel<br/>suggested, then shop it in the manner I suggested.  For string<br/>quartet, there&apos;s some transcribing to do for these on top of any<br/>microtonal concerns.</p><p>There are several different versions of sagittal.  I&apos;ve never seen<br/>a sagittal score that I considered appropriately-notated, but I<br/>haven&apos;t looked at many and I&apos;m willing to be surprised.</p><p>For music like this, my generalized-diatonic approach isn&apos;t<br/>applicable either.  Probably the best bet is a schismatic (58 &amp; 27)<br/>chain-of-fifths notation with 7 nominals and custom accidentals.<br/>But you know more about this facet of notation than I do.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15003 href="#15003">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2006 4:43:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve got a few Gene pieces on my iPod.</p><p>It sounds like you&apos;ve got some kind of process going, and you let it go for 10 minutes or whatever.  That&apos;s cool,  but I wonder if it&apos;s possible to (just as something new to try):</p><p>1)   Keep the pitch, or rather pitch-class structure part of the process intact. (The octaves where notes occur may be somewhat flexible?)</p><p>2)   Every 16 or 32 measures, change texture.  Waltz, March, sad aria, one florid line, 6 lines of counterpoint, 2 voices plus chords, fast scherzo, etc. etc.</p><p>3)   Also, have some parameters gradually change over the course of a work:  an &quot;arch-form&quot; of loudness, or registral width (overall compass of all voices), or density, tempo.</p><p>I generally find it works well to have some parameters change gradually in a controlled fashion,  just a couple of them,  and everything else is just free fantasy,  changing iregularly, on a whim, fairly frequently.</p><p>Maybe you&apos;ve already done this.  I dunno.  It&apos;s what I would like to try if I had your pitch-structural &quot;chops&quot;.  Maybe you don&apos;t care what I would do, why should you.  but there you have it.</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
