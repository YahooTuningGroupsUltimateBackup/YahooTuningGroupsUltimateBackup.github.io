Rationale lets you set up any number of ratio banks, which you can then switch between instantly, and which can have any number of ratios of any limit.  Vertical and horizontal zoom are independent, in case someone wants lots of ratios or ratios that are very close together.  The default set is 13-limit.<br/>Basically designed for me!<br/>-Chuckk</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Seidel &lt;dave@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looks really interesting, Chuckk, thanks.
