Probably, because the sampled sounds<br/>&gt; are really great.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;The quality of one&apos;s samples has nothing to do with whether or not<br/>one uses CSOUND.  Sucky samples in CSOUNDS will sound like. . . sucky<br/>samples.</p><p>&#x9;Of course, one can perhaps do more sophisticated processing and<br/>modifications of samples in CSOUND.  But most of the music I hear here on<br/>the lists,  seems to modify the samples timbrally only be selecting,<br/>transposing and  looping,  and if that&apos;s all you do in CSOUND, well it&apos;s<br/>just gonna sound like a sampler.  If you use good samples, it will sound<br/>good, if not. . .</p><p>&#x9;Prent Rogers uses CSOUND.  although I find the music to be lots of<br/>fun and interesting from a tuning point of view, and although the way the<br/>samples are deployed--(i.e.--the notes and rhythms), which according to<br/>his program notes are often generated algorithmically, (and are probably<br/>quite sophisticated),  I still find most of the timbres somewhat<br/>unsatisfyingly MIDI-esque.</p></div>
