First, there&apos;s a lot of different styles of blues. Sure, JI can work for some styles...I was just listening to Catler&apos;s new CD a few minutes ago, and I like it better each time I hear it. But, would JI work for Charlie Parker&apos;s &quot;Blues For Alice?&quot; Wes Montgomery&apos;s &quot;West Coast Blues?&quot; Or, how about Count Basie/Johnny Otis style big band blues? I&apos;ve played a lot of Freddy Greene style rhythm guitar over the years, I don&apos;t think it would translate to JI tuning so well. Or, how about Piedmont, John Hurt, or Merle Travis style blues? And, you can find the 1-4-5 progression in most styles of American roots music from Buck Owens to Carl Perkins to Bill Monroe...maybe JI could be made to work in those styles, but it might be a real stretch, and not very practical. And, in the long or short run, this is all about actually playing music, what works and what doesn&apos;t.</p><p>  Sure, there&apos;s always exceptions to about anything one could say about art...and great artists are very adept at blowing our minds, so I&apos;m always open for those who change our preconceptions. But, I was trying to make a general point about equal temps as opposed to pure tunings, and I think it&apos;s valid...temps were developed by Europeans to modulate from key to key in a complex manner, I think that&apos;s pretty well known and accepted. And, maqam/raga types of music do not modulate like Western music (I believe they do modulate in a simpler fashion at times), so of course one scale can be used for a particular piece in these styles without tempering...again, no debate there.</p><p>  And, as a matter of fact, I do compose in pure tunings...there&apos;s 2 fretless pieces on my new CD that use scales I made up from the Harmonic Series...I have plans for others in the future as well. I&apos;ve also done numerous gigs with Catler over the years, including 2 in 2006...we correspond fairly regularly, and I think he&apos;s a great unsung innovator. I&apos;ve listened to a lot of his music over the years.<br/>Also know Dante Rosati, stayed with him last year in NYC...a maestro for sure, and a very interesting composer...best from Colorado...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=17300 href="#17300">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2007 3:12:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Never thought I&apos;d be the one to defend JI, but Mr. Haverstick, I still<br/>think you are mistaken about a few things.</p><p>Rather than going at length to prove exceptions to your<br/>generalization, I&apos;m gonna say this: if you want to generalize as such,<br/>I&apos;d like to see some evidence of people who have *tried and failed* to<br/>apply JI in the areas you&apos;ve said that JI is not good for.</p><p>It&apos;s meaningless to say that JI doesn&apos;t work for certain things, or<br/>isn&apos;t suited for certain things, when one cannot provide examples of<br/>music that shows JI&apos;s ill-suitedness.  If people *can* make good JI<br/>music in the styles you mentioned (and they can indeed, as Catler<br/>Rosati McRae Riley Partch etc. have proven), then the burden is on you<br/>to show people who have encountered in their own music the limitations<br/>of JI.  I personally cannot think of a single composer who has tried<br/>to do a certain style of music in JI and has just not been able to do<br/>it, so that leads me to conclude that any style of music that can be<br/>done in Equal Temperament can just as well (and perhaps just as<br/>easily) be done in JI.</p><p>I mean, what exactly is the point of your generalization, any way?<br/>I&apos;m certain you don&apos;t wish to disparage or discourage any composers of<br/>JI music, so I&apos;m some what at a loss to see what you&apos;d accomplish by<br/>asserting and proving that JI &quot;just ain&apos;t so hot&quot; for certain styles<br/>of music.</p><p>Sorry if I seem a bit agitated here, I&apos;m just not too keen on<br/>disparaging generalizations, as I often see them leveled against<br/>tunings that I don&apos;t feel are deserving of them.</p></div><h3><a id=17309 href="#17309">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2007 7:54:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot;<br/>&lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; But, would JI work for Charlie Parker&apos;s &quot;Blues For Alice?&quot; Wes<br/>Montgomery&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;West Coast Blues?&quot; Or, how about Count Basie/Johnny Otis style big<br/>band</p><p>Oooh, that sounds like a challenge!

However, I think<br/>you may have misunderstood what I&apos;m looking for.  Mr. Haverstick made<br/>a rather bold statement: &quot;so, generally, if one wants to play<br/>classical, jazz, American folk, blues, country, reggae,flamenco, rock,<br/>R&amp;B, etc, you&apos;re going to be dealing with a temperament.&quot;  This may be<br/>true as a matter of empirical observation of contingent facts of<br/>western culture (i.e. 99.999% of people playing these styles play in<br/>equal temperament, with 99.998% playing in 12-tone equal temperament)<br/>but it just doesn&apos;t imply universal necessity!  If there exists<br/>classical, jazz, blues, country, rock etc. music in JI, this<br/>invalidates the claim that &quot;generally, you&apos;re going to be dealing with<br/>a temperament&quot;  if you want to play these styles.</p><p>Now, this bold claim seems to have been abandoned, and what really<br/>seems to be being claimed here, by Neil and yourself (at least judging<br/>by your examples), is that while one CAN do any style one pleases in<br/>JI, it *just won&apos;t sound good* if it&apos;s one of the styles (or<br/>sub-styles) mentioned by Neil.  This is a much different claim.  I<br/>can&apos;t really contest it, taste being subjective and all, but it seems<br/>there&apos;s just as much evidence that these styles played in alternate<br/>EDOs are just as bad.  So what one can logically conclude from this<br/>evidence is not that equal temperaments *in general* are better for<br/>these styles, but rather that *12-tone equal temperament* is better<br/>for these styles (since that&apos;s the tuning in which these styles<br/>originated, approximately speaking).</p><p>Bach and Brahms would sound just as bad (if not worse) in, say,<br/>17-EDO; flamenco in 16-EDO would perhaps be atrocious; reggae in<br/>15-EDO would possibly be ridiculous; jazz in 10-EDO would likely be<br/>unrecognizable (though I hope to see even these generalizations<br/>disproven in my lifetime)...but one obviously can&apos;t generalize from<br/>the failures of one temperament, or even MANY temperaments, to the<br/>failure of ALL temperaments, for clearly all of these styles DO work<br/>just fine 12-EDO, and probably 19-EDO or 31-EDO (or even 26, 29, or<br/>22-EDO for that matter).  So it still stands to reason that one cannot<br/>generalize from the failure of one set (or even MANY sets) of JI<br/>pitches to the failure of ALL sets of JI pitches to accomplish certain<br/>stylistic goals; one simply may not have tried the right set of<br/>pitches, and since there are more possible pitch-sets in JI<br/>(uncountably infinite, as opposed to the countable infinity of EDOs),<br/>one will likely have to sift through more sets before one finds the<br/>good ones for playing western music.</p><p>So, in summary, Neil&apos;s claims about the stylistic limitations of JI<br/>are statistically correct but logically invalid, and if that isn&apos;t<br/>clear by now, I can&apos;t make it so by typing more characters.</p><p>At any rate, this is just getting too ironic for me to continue,<br/>seeing as how I don&apos;t even like playing in JI myself and would be just<br/>as happy never to hear it spoken of here again (as it typically bores<br/>me to tears, though to a lesser degree than the high-cardinality EDO<br/>stuff--but as I said, that&apos;s just me, and I wouldn&apos;t expect anyone<br/>else to agree).</p><p>***So can we all just agree that this is not the place to make<br/>disparaging generalizations about the musical possibilities of certain<br/>tunings, and get on with the making of micro music?***</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Igliashon,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please permit me to enter here on Neil&apos;s behalf.

But I&apos;d put it the other way<br/>around: blues is the friction of realities against an artificial<br/>structure. Yes I&apos;m calling tones coming out of the audible harmonic<br/>series more natural or at least closer to the mother than tempered<br/>tones, and post-modernism, which is the beatification of channel-<br/>surfing, can kiss my ass. The tuning of the blues, as characteristic<br/>and defining blue notes within an imposed alien structure, tells a<br/>story in itself. Playing the blues in either JI or ET tells other<br/>stories.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=17345 href="#17345">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>6/4/2007 6:58:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just wanted to make clear that in no way was I intending to connect my<br/>view of playing against a just scale for a blues with Jon Catler&apos;s recent album,<br/>which I have not yet fully heard.
