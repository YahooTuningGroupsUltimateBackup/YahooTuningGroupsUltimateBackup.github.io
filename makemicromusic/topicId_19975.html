You<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; could go via F major or Bb major or other possibilities, but they<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; easily sound bland and boring. I found that an effective way is<br/>&gt; to add<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a B at 8/7 above A- to the D- minor chord so that it becomes<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an utonal tetrad with the most unstable note being the B, which<br/>&gt; leads<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; very naturally to a C in a C major chord.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Generally in this piece I chose to accept and embrace commas as a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; valuable resource instead of being a problem. I think in general<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; song has to either embrace commas or shy away from them -- with<br/>&gt; very<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; static pitches, shifting a pitch a comma all of a sudden can be<br/>&gt; very<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; distracting and unsettling.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The timbre could be better, but I hacked together the<br/>&gt; composition tool<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; myself and it is very limited in many ways.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Going to a different topic, I live in New York now so I would be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interested to know more<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about the microtonal community in the area and perhaps also<br/>&gt; meeting some<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Magnus Jonsson<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
