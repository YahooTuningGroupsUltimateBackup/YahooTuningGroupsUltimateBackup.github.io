Once you get a part right as MIDI, you can save it to audio.  Then you don&apos;t need the instrument slot any more, and it frees up the processor.  It may help to get the tempi right with simplified instrumentation, but 32 instruments doesn&apos;t mean 32 parts.  It means a lot of work, but that&apos;s unavoidable.</p><p>I&apos;d much rather get one instrument working well than worry about running them simultaneously.  Even with split zones on my ZTar, I&apos;ve never needed more than 6 simultaneous channels.</p><p>According to the website, you can get Cubase SE Hybrid for $150, and upgrade later if you find it isn&apos;t good enough.  48 audio tracks, 16 VST instruments and 5-8 effects.  That should at least do as a demo, and while you&apos;re learning about VST instruments.</p><p>Cubase SL, they claim, &quot;offers most of the professional features found in Cubase SX 2.0 with the exclusion of surround mixing and advanced score editing, ...&quot;  So if you&apos;re planning to keep Sibelius as a score editor and not use surround sound, you&apos;re hardly going to need more than that.</p><p>Steinberg have been making audio sequencers for a long time now.  That means the top of the range products are very advanced.  If you really needed something that good, you&apos;d probably know it.
