The resonators can move on their connectors, and you can find differing overtones depending on where you move them under the blade.</p><p>&gt;The clay pots were a great idea there. Wonder what they might sound like?</p><p>Soft, mellow bells, with a quick decay.</p><p>&gt;I think you did a great job &quot;building&quot; these setups. There&apos;re very &gt;interesting to look at.</p><p>We wanted them to be visually interesting on a large stage in a hall that seats nearly 2000, in addition to whatever video close-ups might occur. I have intentions of some modifications to make them completely safe (i.e. no sharp edges on the blades!) and then I&apos;m going to start using them in educational outreach programs, to show kids they can make music anytime, anywhere! I&apos;m hoping to approach Home Depot to fund a program, either financially or with materials, so we can go to schools and build instruments right there, even if it is simply having sticks and plastic paint buckets to start with...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2002 7:49:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Your so subversive, turning future Home Depots into music rooms by working on<br/>there future customers!</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.
