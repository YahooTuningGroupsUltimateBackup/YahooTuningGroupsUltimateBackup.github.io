If this solves some &quot;reverse engineering&quot; problems for Jon or<br/>others, I&apos;d be delighted.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2004 9:04:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; First, is anyone involved with recording or playing mp3 or ogg files<br/>&gt; in a command-line environment like Linux?</p><p>I don&apos;t use command-line for these but I do sometimes play midi files<br/>using the &quot;timidity&quot; command under Linux.</p></div>
