The cynical humor is just what I need at the moment,<br/>especially since I&apos;m procrastinating housework as I write this.<br/>I hope everyone here takes a moment to listen.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know the fret tuning of the baglama, or even<br/>if it&apos;s standardized.  If it is, it should be a simple matter to<br/>measure, even from a high-res photo perhaps.  The wikipedia entry<br/>claims they&apos;re fretted to a 15/oct JI scale, but only shows ratios<br/>for the first 7 frets (are the others meant to be the inversions?)<br/>and the citation returns a 404 error.</p><p>Gamelan tuning is controversial, largely because it is highly<br/>unstandardized, with tunings differing from village to village or<br/>instrument to instrument.  But the approximate scale step patterns<br/>of the two principle scale families, slendro and pelog, are known,<br/>and probably any tuning of these steps is valid in some sense.<br/>Bill Alves and Bill Sethares have both done field work and have<br/>published books</p><p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JnM4IgAACAAJ">http://books.google.com/books?id=JnM4IgAACAAJ</a></p><p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KChoKKhjOb0C">http://books.google.com/books?id=KChoKKhjOb0C</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
