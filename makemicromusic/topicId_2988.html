I don&apos;t think *anything* Prent has done is &quot;without<br/>variation&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt;and even if it did, there are ways of &quot;undue repetition&quot; that<br/>facilitate<br/>&gt; &gt;other things. Much of the electronica and dance music, especially<br/>Euro-tech<br/>&gt; &gt;stuff, would easily fall into this category, but while it might<br/>fail to<br/>&gt; &gt;move &apos;composers&apos; and educated/academic ears, it completely and<br/>fully meets<br/>&gt; &gt;its demands to move (and on the dance floor, to boot!) a large<br/>populace.<br/>&gt; &gt;You can&apos;t simply write it off.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly!  EDM must be taken seriously. It is a large area of music<br/>that is<br/>&gt; reaching younger generations; unlike microtonal or electro-acoustic<br/>music,<br/>&gt; etc. Though EDM has a commercial mainstream side; there is a great<br/>deal of<br/>&gt; music here that falls outside corporate mediation. I could offer an<br/>&gt; extended delineation of the importance of EDM, but it would be<br/>fairly off<br/>&gt; topic. It plays a large roll in my &quot;musical timeline&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In brief: 95% of _mixing_ DJs do not challenge boundaries in a<br/>technical or<br/>&gt; cultural manner. The majority of what is seen on the surface in<br/>regard to<br/>&gt; electronic pop culture and the mainstream has no relation to<br/>innovation<br/>&gt; occurring within the EDM &quot;underground&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; DJing can be an _active_ pursuit and provide deep opportunities for<br/>&gt; interactive performance... It is too bad that those areas are not at<br/>all<br/>&gt; popular. Unfortunately, booking around the world relies more on who<br/>you<br/>&gt; know rather than the skill level of the individual.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Several producers go beyond DJing and present live performances<br/>within EDM<br/>&gt; as well; there is so much more to explore.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;You lucky dog - with your SY! Boy - I&apos;ll bet it&apos;s great to have<br/>those<br/>&gt; filters with FM! That&apos;s the only thing the X lacks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is great to have an external filterbank (Sherman Filterbank,<br/>Mutronics<br/>&gt; Mutator, perhaps the Akai MFC42; there are a bunch to be found from<br/>&gt; boutique audio companies in all price ranges.). Most synths have<br/>pretty<br/>&gt; mediocre filtering capabilities; especially the digital analog<br/>modelled ones!.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In regard to computers as live instruments:<br/>&gt; &gt;Not to mention they can&apos;t stand up to a good pounding when the<br/>music really<br/>&gt; gets rockin&apos;! Tools: they&apos;re only tools, not a panacea, eh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is just an interface issue. An inventive composer/artist will<br/>&gt; find/create an interface that provides the right corporeal balance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;How many times has it happened to me and countless others I know?<br/>You<br/>&gt; go into the studio to try to get something done, not noticing the<br/>&gt; Cosmic Joker of technology sitting over in the corner, you &apos;think&apos;<br/>&gt; you are going to make music - but haa, haa, haa, the joke&apos;s on you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think a good way to approach the studio is to separate the process<br/>&gt; between logical and creative efforts. Working with technology takes<br/>a<br/>&gt; certain amount of preparation and analytical &quot;juggling&quot;. I love<br/>technology<br/>&gt; in regard to music making as there is a significant amount of<br/>analytical<br/>&gt; problem solving, but great leeway with solutions (subjectivity of<br/>music).<br/>&gt; Erm.. of course audio engineering technicalities may be less<br/>forgiving.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The studio is a musical instrument; it must be built, tuned, and<br/>constantly<br/>&gt; maintained  before it can be navigated creatively. By only going<br/>halfway it<br/>&gt; is easy to get caught in &quot;no mans land&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Cool - do you know if they are any closer to a PC version of Max?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is an email I received a month ago regarding the PC release:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt; We&apos;re pleased to announce that the long-awaited Windows version of<br/>Max/MSP is<br/>&gt; closer to shipping. We are currently estimating a release date of<br/>October<br/>&gt; 2002. We will provide more details on the product and our progress<br/>at the<br/>&gt; beginning of June. Here are some details on the project that might<br/>be of<br/>&gt; interest to you.<br/>&gt; - based on the latest Max4/MSP2 versions<br/>&gt; - includes all of the same objects as the Mac version, with the<br/>following<br/>&gt; exceptions: omsnames, omspatches, omscontrollers, cd~ (to be<br/>released later)<br/>&gt; - reads and writes the same binary and text format patcher and data<br/>files<br/>&gt; as the Mac version; collective files, which contain<br/>processor-specific<br/>&gt; compiled code, will be platform-specific<br/>&gt; - audio support initially for ASIO, MME, and Direct Sound; ReWire,<br/>VST, and<br/>&gt; DirectConnect to follow shortly after the initial release<br/>&gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; --Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Egregious<br/>&gt; &quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
