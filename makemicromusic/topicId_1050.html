It has nine closer fifths (Ab-B)<br/>&gt; at around 707.22 cents, and the other eight fifths at around 704.38<br/>&gt; cents, for some pure 11:7 or 14:11 ratios. There are also some<br/>&gt; near-pure 11:6 &quot;neutral sevenths,&quot; and more generally an abundance of<br/>&gt; neutral intervals, as well as lots of major and minor thirds fairly<br/>&gt; near 9:7 and 7:6, very nice as it happens for a &quot;neo-medieval&quot; style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a tuning connected to a lot of history in our microtonal<br/>&gt; community. George Secor, together with Erv Wilson and Dick Harasek,<br/>&gt; developed the keyboard for the Generalized Keyboard Scalatron, an<br/>&gt; instrument which advanced the state of the art, and which, today, is<br/>&gt; still making beautiful music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a tuning with immense potential for many kinds of music, with my<br/>&gt; &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; approach suggesting just one angle on this. I hope that<br/>&gt; it will become much better known in the coming months and years.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Can you point me in the direction of where I might find more details on<br/>this tuning, such as the cent values? Anything with 17 catches my eye<br/>now as I have a new 17 tone instrument to tune up. Many thanks for an<br/>informative posting.</p><p>Best wishes</p></div>
