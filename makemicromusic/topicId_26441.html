I&apos;m rather amused that some thought I was just a pseudonym created by you!  Honestly, do people on this list have any sense at all?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marcel&quot; &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But there&apos;s much more to it than simply using 2 chains of fifths seperated by a 5/4, and &gt; using Pythagorean for tension and 1/1 5/4 3/2 for tension.</p><p>Indeed, I had guessed as much, and I fear I oversimplified my understanding in my hasty reply.</p><p>&gt; First of all, the 2 Pythagorean chains collapse into the following scale:<br/>&gt; 1/1 135/128 9/8 1215/1024 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 405/256 27/16 16/9 15/8 2/1</p><p>Ah, I see.  But tell me, in a piece of music that is restricted to a simple major scale as its basis, what need is there for 135/128, 1215/1024, 45/32, 405/256, or 16/9?</p><p>&gt; For instance, take a 1/1 5/4 3/2 chord.<br/>&gt; You will see it can be in 3 places in the scale.<br/>&gt; As 1/1 5/4 3/2, as 3/2 15/8 9/4, and as 9/8 45/32 27/16</p><p>If C is 1/1, that would be C, G, and D, yes?  I do not understand the need for a D major in the key of C major.</p><p>&gt; When you play a 1/1 5/4 3/2 chord, you may re-interpret it to be any of the other<br/>&gt; chords, and thus follow the 1/1 5/4 3/2 by a large number of other chords.</p><p>I did this quite a few times in my piece, as I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve noticed.  Where did I make an error?</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, points of relaxation mean having harmonic ratios above the bass.<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 does this for major, 1/1 1215/1024 3/2 does this for minor.</p><p>Yes yes, this is the most elementary tenet of your theory and I am sure I have grasped it.  Unless, perhaps, I misunderstand what you mean by &quot;point of relaxation&quot;?  How are such points created or determined?</p><p>&gt; The most natural major scale in it for instance is 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1</p><p>Of course, there can be no doubt!  This is precisely the major scale I used, modulating occasionally from C to G.  In the cases where C is rendered as a Pythagorean triad, it is functioning as the subdominant of G, as prescribed by this scale.  Surely that was not an error on my part?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll upload the tunings of all 3 Drei Equale later tonight in a pdf, and also mp3 audio<br/>&gt; renderings.</p><p>Much as I would appreciate this, I think I would appreciate more a critique of my own composition.  Can you point out the bars that sound erroneous to you?</p><p>&gt; After you get your head around it, and then try to compose in it you will find yourself<br/>&gt; successful with many (or all as long as you don&apos;t push it) things you do.
