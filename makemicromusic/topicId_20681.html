A lot of people have done this, and it has _always_ worked out badly.</p><p>Let me explain why.</p><p>[1] People who are interested in learning about microtonality are generally not shrinking violets. Any folks who sign up for a class on microtones are usually among the more adventurous musicians in a group. Easing these folks into microtonality by starting with trite junk like quartertones will at first frustrate, and soon annoy and eventually enrage them. These folks want to hear the real deal, music that sounds radical and striking. They don&apos;t want to hear a bunch of 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI and listen to someone try to tell &apos;em that&apos;s microtonal -- they know damn well it isn&apos;t. That&apos;s pissing on peoples&apos; legs and telling &apos;em it&apos;s raining. They get fed up with that kind of condescending treatment _fast_.</p><p>[2] If you&apos;re dealing with a casual listener who just asks &quot;So what&apos;s all that xenharmonic stuff about?&quot; you want to show casual listeners _right off_ just how awesome and powerful microtonality can be, and that means you hit &apos;em with the wild exotic stuff. Many people mistakenly imagine that the average listener is conservative or fearful of novelty. In my experience, not so. The average listener is much more open-minded and much more eager to immerse hi/rself in radical new sounds than most folks think. What the average listener does NOT want is jargon and numerology. You start spouting a bunch of fancy Greek words (diatoniaion and epimore and epimere and comma) and drawing lotsa geometric diagrams and numbers on a blackboard, and the average listener&apos;s eyes glaze over. They get sick of that crap _fast_.</p><p>So for an average listener, just hit &apos;em with radical novel microtonal music. Don&apos;t bother to go into details. You don&apos;t even have to tell &apos;em it&apos;s non-octave. If they want to know, you can go into details, but the music&apos;s what matters. Shoot, don&apos;t even tell &apos;em it&apos;s microtonal. Just play it for &apos;em. They&apos;ll love it.</p><p>[3] The biggest problems with starting with familiar tunings is that these are by far the least interesting-sounding of all microtonal tunings. In fact, most of &apos;em are boring as crap. So there you are, droning on through this familiar bland stuff, 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI, 19 equal in the diatonic mode that sounds just about exactly like 12 equal, and everybody is nodding off. People are starting to leave the freakin&apos; room. They&apos;re rolling their eyes. They&apos;re whispering to one another, &quot;THIS is MICROTONAL? Ye gods, this is BORING!&quot; BAD way to introduce microtonality. Bad, B*A*D*, _BAAAAD_ idea. Half your group is likely to sidle out of the room before you work your way, slowly and gradually, by baby steps, up to the point where the xenharmonic tunings sounds distinctly Unlike conventional music, and start to sound spicy and vivid and startlingly new.</p><p>[4] Starting with familiar-sounding novels unconsciously creates an &quot;anchor point.&quot; And it&apos;s a piss-poor anchor point. See Khaneman and Tversky&apos;s Nobel-prize-winning work on the irrationalities of human judgment -- &quot;anchoring,&quot; which they first categorized and quantified, is one of the most notable examples.</p><p>Anchoring occurs when you skew peoples&apos; beliefs by the way you present information. For example: let&apos;s assume you don&apos;t know the population of Turkey (you probably don&apos;t) and I ask you &quot;What&apos;s the population of Turkey? 80 million? 120 million? 140 million?&quot; You&apos;ll give me an answer and it&apos;s probably going to be around the middle of the choices I gave you. But if I ask a different group of people &quot;What&apos;s the population of Turkey? 10 million? 20 million? 30 million?&quot; I&apos;ll get a different set of answers, grouped around the middle of the second set of choices.</p><p>The way the information is presented created an &quot;anchor point&quot; which distorts people&apos;s expectations. In the first example, people&apos;s answers will tend to cluster around 120 million, while in the second example peoples&apos; answers will tend to cluster around 20 million.</p><p>The population of Turkey is 71 million, by the way. Notice how we can distort people&apos;s judgment about the size of the Turkish population just by using this anchoring technique. Political polls do this all the time, as do product evaluation polls set up by companies that want to sell a product. It&apos;s all a form of psychological manipulation. Creeps do this today with the post-9/11 hysteria: &quot;Which do you prefer? Freedom? Or security?&quot; Anyone who&apos;s not brain-damaged will obviously answer security. Freedom doesn&apos;t do you much good if you&apos;re dead. But suppose you change the question -- &quot;Which do you prefer? Having every aspect of your life controlled by the security state? Or being free?&quot; Guess which answer people give _then_...?</p><p>Such is the power of anchoring.</p><p>The problem with starting with a familiar set of 12-like tunings and gradually moving toward unfamiliar tunings that don&apos;t sound like 12 is that you&apos;ve created an anchor point -- and your anchor is 12. This is a bad mistake. By the time you&apos;re halfway through giving your introduction to microtonality, your audience will get the idea -- THE WRONG IDEA: any tuning is good insofar as it is like 12. If doesn&apos;t sound like 12, it&apos;s not so good.</p><p>This results in the kind of dismal crap you see on sinkholes of deluded folly like the Alternative Lying List, where all tunings get judged in a foolish continuum that runs from &quot;very similar to 12 = good&quot; and &quot;very different from 12 = bad.&quot; This naturally leads to crazy and insanely stupid conclusions, like &quot;all non-octave tunings = bad.&quot;</p><p>The musical reality turns out to be just the opposite. The real value of microtonal tunings involves getting away from what&apos;s familiar. History shows that the most popular microtonal tunings are those which audibly differ most drastically from 12 equal. 15 equal is extremely popular, used by Wendy Carlos, Augusto Novaro, Ivor Darreg, Bill Wesley, Easley Balckwood, myself, and many many others. 15 equal is popular because it sounds radically and wildly different from 12 equal. You don&apos;t get anything like a conventional diatonic scale. You get major and minor triads, but they sound noticeably different from the major and minor triads in 12. You don&apos;t have a conventional leading tone. Everything is different. This makes music in 15 equal sound fresh and lively and vivacious. 15 equal breaks open a smelling salts capsule under the audience&apos;s nose and really wakes &apos;em up. By contrast, 19 equal can sound almost identical to 12, and this tends to bore the audience. &quot;If we wanted to hear 12,&quot; their attitude tends to be, &quot;we would&apos;ve stayed with 12. Why bother with this?&quot;</p><p>Once again, 9 equal sounds radically different from conventional western music. You hit an audience with 9 equal, and they&apos;ll get excited. But if you have the bad judgment to start the audience out with the Greek chromatic and diatonic genera, the audience is likely to snooze off. That stuff sounds almost identical to conventional western music. The audience fidgets. They shift in their seats. They start to get antsy. &quot;When are we going to hear the real stuff/&quot; they start to ask. They get impatient.</p><p>Back in the 60s and 70s it used to be chic to play a familiar song like &quot;Greensleves&quot; in 31 equal and call that &quot;microtonality.&quot; Bad bad bad idea. Ivor Darreg had a better idea -- he used to play visitors 13 equal melodies on a bunch of bronze slats he had set up as tubulongs. The exotic inharmonic percussive timbre combined with the novel sound of 13 always perked people up. They got interested. It piqued their curiosity. They wanted to know more.</p><p>Playing &quot;Greensleeves&quot; in 31 equal never worked. 31 equal used to be touted back in the 60s as some kind of &quot;universal tuning&quot; which, academics claimed, would be ideal because you could play conventional western music in it and it would sound almost identical to what we&apos;re familiar with, as well as playing new music.</p><p>Well, that didn&apos;t fly. No one interested in new music gives a damn about hearing the same old thing played in the same old way. They want something NEW. The &quot;old wine in new bottles&quot; is an absolute plague in cesspools of musical ignorance like the Alternative Lying List, and you constantly find people wasting their goddamn time playing Fur Elise in 5-limit diatonic JI. That&apos;s crap. It&apos;s death. It sounds lethally boring. No one cares. Jettison that junk. Deep six it. Press the eject button on that garbage. The way to get people excited about microtonality is show &apos;em vividly and audibly, first-hand, just how different and exciting microtonal tunings can be... And that means playing radical new tunings. 9 equal, the Greek enharmonic, pelog slendro, not this &quot;start with what&apos;s familiar&quot; crap. Starting with what&apos;s familiar is the kiss of death.</p><p>--------------------/</p><p>There may be an analogy between the ear, the mind, and the arm muscles. They don&apos;t get stronger with disuse. Any art or habit of life, if it is limited chronically to a few processes that are easiest to acquire (and, for that reason, are said to be some natural laws), must at some time, quite probably, become so weakened that it is neither a part of art nor a part of life. Nature has bigger things than even-vibration-ratios for man to learn how to use. Consonance is a relative thing (just a nice name for a nice habit). It is a natural enough part of music, but not the whole, or only one. The simplest ratios, often called perfect consonances, have been used so long and so constantly that not only music, but musicians and audiences, have become more or less soft. If they hear anything but doh-me-soh or a near cousin, they have to be carried out on a stretcher --Charles Ives</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a></p><p>for anyone who might be interested, i found this thing buried in a box the other <a href="http://day.it">day.it</a> dates all the way back from when I was interested in Guitar player mag,as they used to run a &quot;lick of the month&quot; type thing, and I wrote this for that (though it was never accepted). anyway, it was funny for me to see it again, and I can tell I was listening to a lot of Brouwer at the time</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/penbhm">http://tinyurl.com/penbhm</a></p><p>anyway, made this pretty rough and raw take i made with my new Olympus LS-10, a very cool field recorder i&apos;m still trying to learn how to best use--and FWiW, it&apos;s a lot easier to play on nylon string with the wider string spacing as regards all the open notes and i recorded it on my son&apos;s old fret-buzzy 7/8 size steel string. So while it&apos;s probably a little more ragged than i&apos;d prefer,it&apos;s still &quot;there&quot; and it should give you an idea of what it&apos;s supposed to sound like....though the last measure of quintuplets are quite a bit too much up on the beat and too fast/hyper (probably should&apos;ve been sextuplets up on the tempo, but i kind of like it that better anyway</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7">http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7</a></p><p>i guess there are a lot of different ways you could notate these kinds of things, but i think here it&apos;s the phrasing that is mostly being altered inside of what are pretty straightforward measures of 4/4, so all the 5:4s aren&apos;t really better set in something like 5/4. There are also a lot of different opinions regarding these types of complex rhythms, but I think for solo instrumental writing their exact precision is not so important as their overall intent, but with any kind of ensemble rhythmic unison it&apos;s obviously important to playit &quot;straight&quot; .</p><p>\FWiW,there were a few errors/discrepancies:</p><p>the &quot;and &quot;of the 3rd and 4th beat of the first measure the<br/>notation is written as G B G# and the tab is written as D G G# and<br/>either of these work fine, what i actually ended up playing was D G G<br/>as 0 0 8 on the D, G, and B string .I guess i just liked /licked this<br/>better because it gave the ending cadence of open strings against half-step dissonances a little more oomph ImO. also the 3rd not of the 3rd quintuplet of the forth measure should be Gb (which is what i played and how it&apos;s written in the tab) and not the Ab of the notation (thatwas just a mistake) .</p><p>Anyway, on these types of difficult rhythms there are a lot of<br/>different ways to think of them....i mean i made the ending<br/>quintuplets easy by phrasing them in groups of six which are more<br/>normalish for most players.But hey, even someone as ferociously<br/>rhythmically difficult as Braxton has said something to the effect of<br/>&quot;count the ones strong and cram the rest in&quot;!</p><p>Daniel \\\\\\</p><p>hi paul, i&apos;d be happy to post some other short and (relatively) simple<br/>lick type stuff, and would encourage others to play them or share<br/>theirs and let others take a stab at them.....anyway, Brouwer is:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer</a></p><p>I always loved Villa Lobos&apos; guitar writing, and Brouwer kind of took<br/>it a step down the road IMO......there are a several nice guitar<br/>collections on Naxos FWiW<br/>anyway, thanks for kind words about the myspace, i&apos;m happy with all<br/>those pieces but i really think Orpheus is as far out as i can take<br/>that kind of phantasmagoric simultaneity in a notated piece.okay,be<br/>well, be creative<br/>daniel</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu">http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu</a></p><p>I thought Keel&apos;s Moth man Prophecies was actually a very good read<br/>(depending on your tolerance for these sorts of things)<br/>but in the very opening paragraphs he also cleverly sets up the gambit<br/>that the lines between hoax, misinterpretation, and truth are more<br/>breakable carapaces of the hard-governed world than most people would<br/>like to consider......<br/>anyway, anybody like to give the lick a go?<br/>it&apos;s short and guitaristic and easy enough given you can navigate the<br/>phrasing<br/>anyway, i&apos;d love to see some of these lists do more of this sort of<br/>thing (play-alongs, takes on tunes etc.).<br/>this particular one was done for the guitar oblique site as people<br/>wanted there wanted to here it/try it out</p><p><a href="http://www.gtroblq.com/">http://www.gtroblq.com/</a></p><p>music is good,<br/>imagination is better</p></div><h3><a id=20682 href="#20682">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;danterosati@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2009 8:22:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>theres only one problem: anyone who says:<br/>&gt;trite junk like quartertones</p><p>and</p><p>&gt;They don&apos;t want to hear a bunch of 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI and listen<br/>to someone try to tell &apos;em that&apos;s microtonal</p><p>doesn&apos;t know their ass from their elbow about either music or<br/>microtonality.</p><p>Fri, May 15, 2009 at 10:59 PM, dasdasdva &lt;dasdasdva@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On In his 2008 article, &quot;Why teaching microtonality from familiar -&gt; exotic<br/>&gt; is a bad idea&quot;, Brian McLaren makes the case, one I agree with FWiW, that if<br/>&gt; if swimming is your goal , you should forgo timidity as a matter of course<br/>&gt; and jump in the deep waters&#xFFFD;by analogy, something akin to what McKenna would<br/>&gt; refer to as a meaningful, committed, or heroic dose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why Teaching Microtonality from Familiar -&gt; Exotic is a Bad Idea<br/>&gt; Brian McLaren<br/>&gt; March 3, 2008<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The entire idea of trying to introduce microtonality to people by starting<br/>&gt; with what&apos;s familiar and gradually moving by baby steps to more exotic<br/>&gt; tunings is a disastrously bad idea.

Nature has bigger things than even-vibration-ratios for man to learn<br/>&gt; how to use. Consonance is a relative thing (just a nice name for a nice<br/>&gt; habit). It is a natural enough part of music, but not the whole, or only<br/>&gt; one. The simplest ratios, often called perfect consonances, have been used<br/>&gt; so long and so constantly that not only music, but musicians and audiences,<br/>&gt; have become more or less soft.

A lot of people have done this, and it has _always_ worked out badly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me explain why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [1] People who are interested in learning about microtonality are generally not shrinking violets. Any folks who sign up for a class on microtones are usually among the more adventurous musicians in a group. Easing these folks into microtonality by starting with trite junk like quartertones will at first frustrate, and soon annoy and eventually enrage them. These folks want to hear the real deal, music that sounds radical and striking. They don&apos;t want to hear a bunch of 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI and listen to someone try to tell &apos;em that&apos;s microtonal -- they know damn well it isn&apos;t. That&apos;s pissing on peoples&apos; legs and telling &apos;em it&apos;s raining. They get fed up with that kind of condescending treatment _fast_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [2] If you&apos;re dealing with a casual listener who just asks &quot;So what&apos;s all that xenharmonic stuff about?&quot; you want to show casual listeners _right off_ just how awesome and powerful microtonality can be, and that means you hit &apos;em with the wild exotic stuff. Many people mistakenly imagine that the average listener is conservative or fearful of novelty. In my experience, not so. The average listener is much more open-minded and much more eager to immerse hi/rself in radical new sounds than most folks think. What the average listener does NOT want is jargon and numerology. You start spouting a bunch of fancy Greek words (diatoniaion and epimore and epimere and comma) and drawing lotsa geometric diagrams and numbers on a blackboard, and the average listener&apos;s eyes glaze over. They get sick of that crap _fast_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for an average listener, just hit &apos;em with radical novel microtonal music. Don&apos;t bother to go into details. You don&apos;t even have to tell &apos;em it&apos;s non-octave. If they want to know, you can go into details, but the music&apos;s what matters. Shoot, don&apos;t even tell &apos;em it&apos;s microtonal. Just play it for &apos;em. They&apos;ll love it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [3] The biggest problems with starting with familiar tunings is that these are by far the least interesting-sounding of all microtonal tunings. In fact, most of &apos;em are boring as crap. So there you are, droning on through this familiar bland stuff, 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI, 19 equal in the diatonic mode that sounds just about exactly like 12 equal, and everybody is nodding off. People are starting to leave the freakin&apos; room. They&apos;re rolling their eyes. They&apos;re whispering to one another, &quot;THIS is MICROTONAL? Ye gods, this is BORING!&quot; BAD way to introduce microtonality. Bad, B*A*D*, _BAAAAD_ idea. Half your group is likely to sidle out of the room before you work your way, slowly and gradually, by baby steps, up to the point where the xenharmonic tunings sounds distinctly Unlike conventional music, and start to sound spicy and vivid and startlingly new.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [4] Starting with familiar-sounding novels unconsciously creates an &quot;anchor point.&quot; And it&apos;s a piss-poor anchor point. See Khaneman and Tversky&apos;s Nobel-prize-winning work on the irrationalities of human judgment -- &quot;anchoring,&quot; which they first categorized and quantified, is one of the most notable examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anchoring occurs when you skew peoples&apos; beliefs by the way you present information. For example: let&apos;s assume you don&apos;t know the population of Turkey (you probably don&apos;t) and I ask you &quot;What&apos;s the population of Turkey? 80 million? 120 million? 140 million?&quot; You&apos;ll give me an answer and it&apos;s probably going to be around the middle of the choices I gave you. But if I ask a different group of people &quot;What&apos;s the population of Turkey? 10 million? 20 million? 30 million?&quot; I&apos;ll get a different set of answers, grouped around the middle of the second set of choices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The way the information is presented created an &quot;anchor point&quot; which distorts people&apos;s expectations. In the first example, people&apos;s answers will tend to cluster around 120 million, while in the second example peoples&apos; answers will tend to cluster around 20 million.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The population of Turkey is 71 million, by the way. Notice how we can distort people&apos;s judgment about the size of the Turkish population just by using this anchoring technique. Political polls do this all the time, as do product evaluation polls set up by companies that want to sell a product. It&apos;s all a form of psychological manipulation. Creeps do this today with the post-9/11 hysteria: &quot;Which do you prefer? Freedom? Or security?&quot; Anyone who&apos;s not brain-damaged will obviously answer security. Freedom doesn&apos;t do you much good if you&apos;re dead. But suppose you change the question -- &quot;Which do you prefer? Having every aspect of your life controlled by the security state? Or being free?&quot; Guess which answer people give _then_...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such is the power of anchoring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem with starting with a familiar set of 12-like tunings and gradually moving toward unfamiliar tunings that don&apos;t sound like 12 is that you&apos;ve created an anchor point -- and your anchor is 12. This is a bad mistake. By the time you&apos;re halfway through giving your introduction to microtonality, your audience will get the idea -- THE WRONG IDEA: any tuning is good insofar as it is like 12. If doesn&apos;t sound like 12, it&apos;s not so good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This results in the kind of dismal crap you see on sinkholes of deluded folly like the Alternative Lying List, where all tunings get judged in a foolish continuum that runs from &quot;very similar to 12 = good&quot; and &quot;very different from 12 = bad.&quot; This naturally leads to crazy and insanely stupid conclusions, like &quot;all non-octave tunings = bad.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The musical reality turns out to be just the opposite. The real value of microtonal tunings involves getting away from what&apos;s familiar. History shows that the most popular microtonal tunings are those which audibly differ most drastically from 12 equal. 15 equal is extremely popular, used by Wendy Carlos, Augusto Novaro, Ivor Darreg, Bill Wesley, Easley Balckwood, myself, and many many others. 15 equal is popular because it sounds radically and wildly different from 12 equal. You don&apos;t get anything like a conventional diatonic scale. You get major and minor triads, but they sound noticeably different from the major and minor triads in 12. You don&apos;t have a conventional leading tone. Everything is different. This makes music in 15 equal sound fresh and lively and vivacious. 15 equal breaks open a smelling salts capsule under the audience&apos;s nose and really wakes &apos;em up. By contrast, 19 equal can sound almost identical to 12, and this tends to bore the audience. &quot;If we wanted to hear 12,&quot; their attitude tends to be, &quot;we would&apos;ve stayed with 12. Why bother with this?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again, 9 equal sounds radically different from conventional western music. You hit an audience with 9 equal, and they&apos;ll get excited. But if you have the bad judgment to start the audience out with the Greek chromatic and diatonic genera, the audience is likely to snooze off. That stuff sounds almost identical to conventional western music. The audience fidgets. They shift in their seats. They start to get antsy. &quot;When are we going to hear the real stuff/&quot; they start to ask. They get impatient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in the 60s and 70s it used to be chic to play a familiar song like &quot;Greensleves&quot; in 31 equal and call that &quot;microtonality.&quot; Bad bad bad idea. Ivor Darreg had a better idea -- he used to play visitors 13 equal melodies on a bunch of bronze slats he had set up as tubulongs. The exotic inharmonic percussive timbre combined with the novel sound of 13 always perked people up. They got interested. It piqued their curiosity. They wanted to know more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing &quot;Greensleeves&quot; in 31 equal never worked. 31 equal used to be touted back in the 60s as some kind of &quot;universal tuning&quot; which, academics claimed, would be ideal because you could play conventional western music in it and it would sound almost identical to what we&apos;re familiar with, as well as playing new music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that didn&apos;t fly. No one interested in new music gives a damn about hearing the same old thing played in the same old way. They want something NEW. The &quot;old wine in new bottles&quot; is an absolute plague in cesspools of musical ignorance like the Alternative Lying List, and you constantly find people wasting their goddamn time playing Fur Elise in 5-limit diatonic JI. That&apos;s crap. It&apos;s death. It sounds lethally boring. No one cares. Jettison that junk. Deep six it. Press the eject button on that garbage. The way to get people excited about microtonality is show &apos;em vividly and audibly, first-hand, just how different and exciting microtonal tunings can be... And that means playing radical new tunings. 9 equal, the Greek enharmonic, pelog slendro, not this &quot;start with what&apos;s familiar&quot; crap. Starting with what&apos;s familiar is the kiss of death.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There may be an analogy between the ear, the mind, and the arm muscles.

They get fed up with that &gt; kind of condescending treatment _fast_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [2] If you&apos;re dealing with a casual listener who just asks &quot;So what&apos;s &gt; all that xenharmonic stuff about?&quot; you want to show casual listeners &gt; _right off_ just how awesome and powerful microtonality can be, and &gt; that means you hit &apos;em with the wild exotic stuff. Many people &gt; mistakenly imagine that the average listener is conservative or &gt; fearful of novelty. In my experience, not so. The average listener is &gt; much more open-minded and much more eager to immerse hi/rself in &gt; radical new sounds than most folks think. What the average listener &gt; does NOT want is jargon and numerology. You start spouting a bunch of &gt; fancy Greek words (diatoniaion and epimore and epimere and comma) and &gt; drawing lotsa geometric diagrams and numbers on a blackboard, and the &gt; average listener&apos;s eyes glaze over. They get sick of that crap _fast_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for an average listener, just hit &apos;em with radical novel microtonal &gt; music. Don&apos;t bother to go into details. You don&apos;t even have to tell &gt; &apos;em it&apos;s non-octave. If they want to know, you can go into details, &gt; but the music&apos;s what matters. Shoot, don&apos;t even tell &apos;em it&apos;s &gt; microtonal. Just play it for &apos;em. They&apos;ll love it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [3] The biggest problems with starting with familiar tunings is that &gt; these are by far the least interesting-sounding of all microtonal &gt; tunings. In fact, most of &apos;em are boring as crap. So there you are, &gt; droning on through this familiar bland stuff, 5-limit diatonic 12-note &gt; JI, 19 equal in the diatonic mode that sounds just about exactly like &gt; 12 equal, and everybody is nodding off. People are starting to leave &gt; the freakin&apos; room. They&apos;re rolling their eyes. They&apos;re whispering to &gt; one another, &quot;THIS is MICROTONAL? Ye gods, this is BORING!&quot; BAD way to &gt; introduce microtonality. Bad, B*A*D*, _BAAAAD_ idea. Half your group &gt; is likely to sidle out of the room before you work your way, slowly &gt; and gradually, by baby steps, up to the point where the xenharmonic &gt; tunings sounds distinctly Unlike conventional music, and start to &gt; sound spicy and vivid and startlingly new.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [4] Starting with familiar-sounding novels unconsciously creates an &gt; &quot;anchor point.&quot; And it&apos;s a piss-poor anchor point. See Khaneman and &gt; Tversky&apos;s Nobel-prize-winning work on the irrationalities of human &gt; judgment -- &quot;anchoring,&quot; which they first categorized and quantified, &gt; is one of the most notable examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anchoring occurs when you skew peoples&apos; beliefs by the way you present &gt; information. For example: let&apos;s assume you don&apos;t know the population &gt; of Turkey (you probably don&apos;t) and I ask you &quot;What&apos;s the population of &gt; Turkey? 80 million? 120 million? 140 million?&quot; You&apos;ll give me an &gt; answer and it&apos;s probably going to be around the middle of the choices &gt; I gave you. But if I ask a different group of people &quot;What&apos;s the &gt; population of Turkey? 10 million? 20 million? 30 million?&quot; I&apos;ll get a &gt; different set of answers, grouped around the middle of the second set &gt; of choices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The way the information is presented created an &quot;anchor point&quot; which &gt; distorts people&apos;s expectations. In the first example, people&apos;s answers &gt; will tend to cluster around 120 million, while in the second example &gt; peoples&apos; answers will tend to cluster around 20 million.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The population of Turkey is 71 million, by the way. Notice how we can &gt; distort people&apos;s judgment about the size of the Turkish population &gt; just by using this anchoring technique. Political polls do this all &gt; the time, as do product evaluation polls set up by companies that want &gt; to sell a product. It&apos;s all a form of psychological manipulation. &gt; Creeps do this today with the post-9/11 hysteria: &quot;Which do you &gt; prefer? Freedom? Or security?&quot; Anyone who&apos;s not brain-damaged will &gt; obviously answer security. Freedom doesn&apos;t do you much good if you&apos;re &gt; dead. But suppose you change the question -- &quot;Which do you prefer? &gt; Having every aspect of your life controlled by the security state? Or &gt; being free?&quot; Guess which answer people give _then_...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such is the power of anchoring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem with starting with a familiar set of 12-like tunings and &gt; gradually moving toward unfamiliar tunings that don&apos;t sound like 12 is &gt; that you&apos;ve created an anchor point -- and your anchor is 12. This is &gt; a bad mistake. By the time you&apos;re halfway through giving your &gt; introduction to microtonality, your audience will get the idea -- THE &gt; WRONG IDEA: any tuning is good insofar as it is like 12. If doesn&apos;t &gt; sound like 12, it&apos;s not so good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This results in the kind of dismal crap you see on sinkholes of &gt; deluded folly like the Alternative Lying List, where all tunings get &gt; judged in a foolish continuum that runs from &quot;very similar to 12 = &gt; good&quot; and &quot;very different from 12 = bad.&quot; This naturally leads to &gt; crazy and insanely stupid conclusions, like &quot;all non-octave tunings = &gt; bad.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The musical reality turns out to be just the opposite. The real value &gt; of microtonal tunings involves getting away from what&apos;s familiar. &gt; History shows that the most popular microtonal tunings are those which &gt; audibly differ most drastically from 12 equal. 15 equal is extremely &gt; popular, used by Wendy Carlos, Augusto Novaro, Ivor Darreg, Bill &gt; Wesley, Easley Balckwood, myself, and many many others. 15 equal is &gt; popular because it sounds radically and wildly different from 12 &gt; equal. You don&apos;t get anything like a conventional diatonic scale. You &gt; get major and minor triads, but they sound noticeably different from &gt; the major and minor triads in 12. You don&apos;t have a conventional &gt; leading tone. Everything is different. This makes music in 15 equal &gt; sound fresh and lively and vivacious. 15 equal breaks open a smelling &gt; salts capsule under the audience&apos;s nose and really wakes &apos;em up. By &gt; contrast, 19 equal can sound almost identical to 12, and this tends to &gt; bore the audience. &quot;If we wanted to hear 12,&quot; their attitude tends to &gt; be, &quot;we would&apos;ve stayed with 12. Why bother with this?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again, 9 equal sounds radically different from conventional &gt; western music. You hit an audience with 9 equal, and they&apos;ll get &gt; excited. But if you have the bad judgment to start the audience out &gt; with the Greek chromatic and diatonic genera, the audience is likely &gt; to snooze off. That stuff sounds almost identical to conventional &gt; western music. The audience fidgets. They shift in their seats. They &gt; start to get antsy. &quot;When are we going to hear the real stuff/&quot; they &gt; start to ask. They get impatient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in the 60s and 70s it used to be chic to play a familiar song &gt; like &quot;Greensleves&quot; in 31 equal and call that &quot;microtonality.&quot; Bad bad &gt; bad idea. Ivor Darreg had a better idea -- he used to play visitors 13 &gt; equal melodies on a bunch of bronze slats he had set up as tubulongs. &gt; The exotic inharmonic percussive timbre combined with the novel sound &gt; of 13 always perked people up. They got interested. It piqued their &gt; curiosity. They wanted to know more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing &quot;Greensleeves&quot; in 31 equal never worked. 31 equal used to be &gt; touted back in the 60s as some kind of &quot;universal tuning&quot; which, &gt; academics claimed, would be ideal because you could play conventional &gt; western music in it and it would sound almost identical to what we&apos;re &gt; familiar with, as well as playing new music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that didn&apos;t fly. No one interested in new music gives a damn &gt; about hearing the same old thing played in the same old way. They want &gt; something NEW. The &quot;old wine in new bottles&quot; is an absolute plague in &gt; cesspools of musical ignorance like the Alternative Lying List, and &gt; you constantly find people wasting their goddamn time playing Fur &gt; Elise in 5-limit diatonic JI. That&apos;s crap. It&apos;s death. It sounds &gt; lethally boring. No one cares. Jettison that junk. Deep six it. Press &gt; the eject button on that garbage. The way to get people excited about &gt; microtonality is show &apos;em vividly and audibly, first-hand, just how &gt; different and exciting microtonal tunings can be... And that means &gt; playing radical new tunings. 9 equal, the Greek enharmonic, pelog &gt; slendro, not this &quot;start with what&apos;s familiar&quot; crap. Starting with &gt; what&apos;s familiar is the kiss of death.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There may be an analogy between the ear, the mind, and the arm &gt; muscles. They don&apos;t get stronger with disuse. Any art or habit of &gt; life, if it is limited chronically to a few processes that are easiest &gt; to acquire (and, for that reason, are said to be some natural laws), &gt; must at some time, quite probably, become so weakened that it is &gt; neither a part of art nor a part of life. Nature has bigger things &gt; than even-vibration-ratios for man to learn how to use. Consonance is &gt; a relative thing (just a nice name for a nice habit). It is a natural &gt; enough part of music, but not the whole, or only one. The simplest &gt; ratios, often called perfect consonances, have been used so long and &gt; so constantly that not only music, but musicians and audiences, have &gt; become more or less soft. If they hear anything but doh-me-soh or a &gt; near cousin, they have to be carried out on a stretcher --Charles Ives<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for anyone who might be interested, i found this thing buried in a box &gt; the other <a href="http://day.it">day.it</a> dates all the way back from when I was interested in &gt; Guitar player mag,as they used to run a &quot;lick of the month&quot; type &gt; thing, and I wrote this for that (though it was never accepted). &gt; anyway, it was funny for me to see it again, and I can tell I was &gt; listening to a lot of Brouwer at the time<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/penbhm">http://tinyurl.com/penbhm</a> &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/penbhm">http://tinyurl.com/penbhm</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anyway, made this pretty rough and raw take i made with my new Olympus &gt; LS-10, a very cool field recorder i&apos;m still trying to learn how to &gt; best use--and FWiW, it&apos;s a lot easier to play on nylon string with the &gt; wider string spacing as regards all the open notes and i recorded it &gt; on my son&apos;s old fret-buzzy 7/8 size steel string. So while it&apos;s &gt; probably a little more ragged than i&apos;d prefer,it&apos;s still &quot;there&quot; and &gt; it should give you an idea of what it&apos;s supposed to sound &gt; like....though the last measure of quintuplets are quite a bit too &gt; much up on the beat and too fast/hyper (probably should&apos;ve been &gt; sextuplets up on the tempo, but i kind of like it that better anyway<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7">http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7</a> &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7">http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i guess there are a lot of different ways you could notate these kinds &gt; of things, but i think here it&apos;s the phrasing that is mostly being &gt; altered inside of what are pretty straightforward measures of 4/4, so &gt; all the 5:4s aren&apos;t really better set in something like 5/4. There are &gt; also a lot of different opinions regarding these types of complex &gt; rhythms, but I think for solo instrumental writing their exact &gt; precision is not so important as their overall intent, but with any &gt; kind of ensemble rhythmic unison it&apos;s obviously important to playit &gt; &quot;straight&quot; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; \FWiW,there were a few errors/discrepancies:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the &quot;and &quot;of the 3rd and 4th beat of the first measure the<br/>&gt; notation is written as G B G# and the tab is written as D G G# and<br/>&gt; either of these work fine, what i actually ended up playing was D G G<br/>&gt; as 0 0 8 on the D, G, and B string .I guess i just liked /licked this<br/>&gt; better because it gave the ending cadence of open strings against &gt; half-step dissonances a little more oomph ImO. also the 3rd not of the &gt; 3rd quintuplet of the forth measure should be Gb (which is what i &gt; played and how it&apos;s written in the tab) and not the Ab of the notation &gt; (thatwas just a mistake) .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, on these types of difficult rhythms there are a lot of<br/>&gt; different ways to think of them....i mean i made the ending<br/>&gt; quintuplets easy by phrasing them in groups of six which are more<br/>&gt; normalish for most players.But hey, even someone as ferociously<br/>&gt; rhythmically difficult as Braxton has said something to the effect of<br/>&gt; &quot;count the ones strong and cram the rest in&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel \\\\\\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi paul, i&apos;d be happy to post some other short and (relatively) simple<br/>&gt; lick type stuff, and would encourage others to play them or share<br/>&gt; theirs and let others take a stab at them.....anyway, Brouwer is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I always loved Villa Lobos&apos; guitar writing, and Brouwer kind of took<br/>&gt; it a step down the road IMO......there are a several nice guitar<br/>&gt; collections on Naxos FWiW<br/>&gt; anyway, thanks for kind words about the myspace, i&apos;m happy with all<br/>&gt; those pieces but i really think Orpheus is as far out as i can take<br/>&gt; that kind of phantasmagoric simultaneity in a notated piece.okay,be<br/>&gt; well, be creative<br/>&gt; daniel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu">http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu</a> &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu">http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought Keel&apos;s Moth man Prophecies was actually a very good read<br/>&gt; (depending on your tolerance for these sorts of things)<br/>&gt; but in the very opening paragraphs he also cleverly sets up the gambit<br/>&gt; that the lines between hoax, misinterpretation, and truth are more<br/>&gt; breakable carapaces of the hard-governed world than most people would<br/>&gt; like to consider......<br/>&gt; anyway, anybody like to give the lick a go?<br/>&gt; it&apos;s short and guitaristic and easy enough given you can navigate the<br/>&gt; phrasing<br/>&gt; anyway, i&apos;d love to see some of these lists do more of this sort of<br/>&gt; thing (play-alongs, takes on tunes etc.).<br/>&gt; this particular one was done for the guitar oblique site as people<br/>&gt; wanted there wanted to here it/try it out<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.gtroblq.com/">http://www.gtroblq.com/</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.gtroblq.com/">http://www.gtroblq.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; music is good,<br/>&gt; imagination is better<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=20688 href="#20688">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2009 2:09:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Andrew Hunt wrote:<br/>&gt; Just FYI, that article of Brian&apos;s was written before 2008, &gt; possibly long before.

There are good reasons why 12-et is such a popular tuning; many microtonal systems have similar reasons for being good tunings. Besides, the most familiar 12-ET music is tonal music that follows patterns from meantone temperament, with occasional progressions that divide the octave into 3 or 4 equal parts. 19-ET can be used as just another way of tuning meantone, and even our musical notation is based on a chain of fifths as in meantone or schismatic temperaments.

A lot of people have done this, and it has _always_ worked out badly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me explain why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [1] People who are interested in learning about microtonality are generally not shrinking violets. Any folks who sign up for a class on microtones are usually among the more adventurous musicians in a group. Easing these folks into microtonality by starting with trite junk like quartertones will at first frustrate, and soon annoy and eventually enrage them. These folks want to hear the real deal, music that sounds radical and striking. They don&apos;t want to hear a bunch of 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI and listen to someone try to tell &apos;em that&apos;s microtonal -- they know damn well it isn&apos;t. That&apos;s pissing on peoples&apos; legs and telling &apos;em it&apos;s raining. They get fed up with that kind of condescending treatment _fast_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [2] If you&apos;re dealing with a casual listener who just asks &quot;So what&apos;s all that xenharmonic stuff about?&quot; you want to show casual listeners _right off_ just how awesome and powerful microtonality can be, and that means you hit &apos;em with the wild exotic stuff. Many people mistakenly imagine that the average listener is conservative or fearful of novelty. In my experience, not so. The average listener is much more open-minded and much more eager to immerse hi/rself in radical new sounds than most folks think. What the average listener does NOT want is jargon and numerology. You start spouting a bunch of fancy Greek words (diatoniaion and epimore and epimere and comma) and drawing lotsa geometric diagrams and numbers on a blackboard, and the average listener&apos;s eyes glaze over. They get sick of that crap _fast_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for an average listener, just hit &apos;em with radical novel microtonal music. Don&apos;t bother to go into details. You don&apos;t even have to tell &apos;em it&apos;s non-octave. If they want to know, you can go into details, but the music&apos;s what matters. Shoot, don&apos;t even tell &apos;em it&apos;s microtonal. Just play it for &apos;em. They&apos;ll love it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [3] The biggest problems with starting with familiar tunings is that these are by far the least interesting-sounding of all microtonal tunings. In fact, most of &apos;em are boring as crap. So there you are, droning on through this familiar bland stuff, 5-limit diatonic 12-note JI, 19 equal in the diatonic mode that sounds just about exactly like 12 equal, and everybody is nodding off. People are starting to leave the freakin&apos; room. They&apos;re rolling their eyes. They&apos;re whispering to one another, &quot;THIS is MICROTONAL? Ye gods, this is BORING!&quot; BAD way to introduce microtonality. Bad, B*A*D*, _BAAAAD_ idea. Half your group is likely to sidle out of the room before you work your way, slowly and gradually, by baby steps, up to the point where the xenharmonic tunings sounds distinctly Unlike conventional music, and start to sound spicy and vivid and startlingly new.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [4] Starting with familiar-sounding novels unconsciously creates an &quot;anchor point.&quot; And it&apos;s a piss-poor anchor point. See Khaneman and Tversky&apos;s Nobel-prize-winning work on the irrationalities of human judgment -- &quot;anchoring,&quot; which they first categorized and quantified, is one of the most notable examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anchoring occurs when you skew peoples&apos; beliefs by the way you present information. For example: let&apos;s assume you don&apos;t know the population of Turkey (you probably don&apos;t) and I ask you &quot;What&apos;s the population of Turkey? 80 million? 120 million? 140 million?&quot; You&apos;ll give me an answer and it&apos;s probably going to be around the middle of the choices I gave you. But if I ask a different group of people &quot;What&apos;s the population of Turkey? 10 million? 20 million? 30 million?&quot; I&apos;ll get a different set of answers, grouped around the middle of the second set of choices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The way the information is presented created an &quot;anchor point&quot; which distorts people&apos;s expectations. In the first example, people&apos;s answers will tend to cluster around 120 million, while in the second example peoples&apos; answers will tend to cluster around 20 million.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The population of Turkey is 71 million, by the way. Notice how we can distort people&apos;s judgment about the size of the Turkish population just by using this anchoring technique. Political polls do this all the time, as do product evaluation polls set up by companies that want to sell a product. It&apos;s all a form of psychological manipulation. Creeps do this today with the post-9/11 hysteria: &quot;Which do you prefer? Freedom? Or security?&quot; Anyone who&apos;s not brain-damaged will obviously answer security. Freedom doesn&apos;t do you much good if you&apos;re dead. But suppose you change the question -- &quot;Which do you prefer? Having every aspect of your life controlled by the security state? Or being free?&quot; Guess which answer people give _then_...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such is the power of anchoring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem with starting with a familiar set of 12-like tunings and gradually moving toward unfamiliar tunings that don&apos;t sound like 12 is that you&apos;ve created an anchor point -- and your anchor is 12. This is a bad mistake. By the time you&apos;re halfway through giving your introduction to microtonality, your audience will get the idea -- THE WRONG IDEA: any tuning is good insofar as it is like 12. If doesn&apos;t sound like 12, it&apos;s not so good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This results in the kind of dismal crap you see on sinkholes of deluded folly like the Alternative Lying List, where all tunings get judged in a foolish continuum that runs from &quot;very similar to 12 = good&quot; and &quot;very different from 12 = bad.&quot; This naturally leads to crazy and insanely stupid conclusions, like &quot;all non-octave tunings = bad.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The musical reality turns out to be just the opposite. The real value of microtonal tunings involves getting away from what&apos;s familiar. History shows that the most popular microtonal tunings are those which audibly differ most drastically from 12 equal. 15 equal is extremely popular, used by Wendy Carlos, Augusto Novaro, Ivor Darreg, Bill Wesley, Easley Balckwood, myself, and many many others. 15 equal is popular because it sounds radically and wildly different from 12 equal. You don&apos;t get anything like a conventional diatonic scale. You get major and minor triads, but they sound noticeably different from the major and minor triads in 12. You don&apos;t have a conventional leading tone. Everything is different. This makes music in 15 equal sound fresh and lively and vivacious. 15 equal breaks open a smelling salts capsule under the audience&apos;s nose and really wakes &apos;em up. By contrast, 19 equal can sound almost identical to 12, and this tends to bore the audience. &quot;If we wanted to hear 12,&quot; their attitude tends to be, &quot;we would&apos;ve stayed with 12. Why bother with this?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again, 9 equal sounds radically different from conventional western music. You hit an audience with 9 equal, and they&apos;ll get excited. But if you have the bad judgment to start the audience out with the Greek chromatic and diatonic genera, the audience is likely to snooze off. That stuff sounds almost identical to conventional western music. The audience fidgets. They shift in their seats. They start to get antsy. &quot;When are we going to hear the real stuff/&quot; they start to ask. They get impatient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back in the 60s and 70s it used to be chic to play a familiar song like &quot;Greensleves&quot; in 31 equal and call that &quot;microtonality.&quot; Bad bad bad idea. Ivor Darreg had a better idea -- he used to play visitors 13 equal melodies on a bunch of bronze slats he had set up as tubulongs. The exotic inharmonic percussive timbre combined with the novel sound of 13 always perked people up. They got interested. It piqued their curiosity. They wanted to know more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing &quot;Greensleeves&quot; in 31 equal never worked. 31 equal used to be touted back in the 60s as some kind of &quot;universal tuning&quot; which, academics claimed, would be ideal because you could play conventional western music in it and it would sound almost identical to what we&apos;re familiar with, as well as playing new music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that didn&apos;t fly. No one interested in new music gives a damn about hearing the same old thing played in the same old way. They want something NEW. The &quot;old wine in new bottles&quot; is an absolute plague in cesspools of musical ignorance like the Alternative Lying List, and you constantly find people wasting their goddamn time playing Fur Elise in 5-limit diatonic JI. That&apos;s crap. It&apos;s death. It sounds lethally boring. No one cares. Jettison that junk. Deep six it. Press the eject button on that garbage. The way to get people excited about microtonality is show &apos;em vividly and audibly, first-hand, just how different and exciting microtonal tunings can be... And that means playing radical new tunings. 9 equal, the Greek enharmonic, pelog slendro, not this &quot;start with what&apos;s familiar&quot; crap. Starting with what&apos;s familiar is the kiss of death.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There may be an analogy between the ear, the mind, and the arm muscles. They don&apos;t get stronger with disuse. Any art or habit of life, if it is limited chronically to a few processes that are easiest to acquire (and, for that reason, are said to be some natural laws), must at some time, quite probably, become so weakened that it is neither a part of art nor a part of life. Nature has bigger things than even-vibration-ratios for man to learn how to use. Consonance is a relative thing (just a nice name for a nice habit). It is a natural enough part of music, but not the whole, or only one. The simplest ratios, often called perfect consonances, have been used so long and so constantly that not only music, but musicians and audiences, have become more or less soft. If they hear anything but doh-me-soh or a near cousin, they have to be carried out on a stretcher --Charles Ives<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for anyone who might be interested, i found this thing buried in a box the other <a href="http://day.it">day.it</a> dates all the way back from when I was interested in Guitar player mag,as they used to run a &quot;lick of the month&quot; type thing, and I wrote this for that (though it was never accepted). anyway, it was funny for me to see it again, and I can tell I was listening to a lot of Brouwer at the time<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/penbhm">http://tinyurl.com/penbhm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anyway, made this pretty rough and raw take i made with my new Olympus LS-10, a very cool field recorder i&apos;m still trying to learn how to best use--and FWiW, it&apos;s a lot easier to play on nylon string with the wider string spacing as regards all the open notes and i recorded it on my son&apos;s old fret-buzzy 7/8 size steel string. So while it&apos;s probably a little more ragged than i&apos;d prefer,it&apos;s still &quot;there&quot; and it should give you an idea of what it&apos;s supposed to sound like....though the last measure of quintuplets are quite a bit too much up on the beat and too fast/hyper (probably should&apos;ve been sextuplets up on the tempo, but i kind of like it that better anyway<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7">http://tinyurl.com/ok6sr7</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i guess there are a lot of different ways you could notate these kinds of things, but i think here it&apos;s the phrasing that is mostly being altered inside of what are pretty straightforward measures of 4/4, so all the 5:4s aren&apos;t really better set in something like 5/4. There are also a lot of different opinions regarding these types of complex rhythms, but I think for solo instrumental writing their exact precision is not so important as their overall intent, but with any kind of ensemble rhythmic unison it&apos;s obviously important to playit &quot;straight&quot; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; \FWiW,there were a few errors/discrepancies:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the &quot;and &quot;of the 3rd and 4th beat of the first measure the<br/>&gt; notation is written as G B G# and the tab is written as D G G# and<br/>&gt; either of these work fine, what i actually ended up playing was D G G<br/>&gt; as 0 0 8 on the D, G, and B string .I guess i just liked /licked this<br/>&gt; better because it gave the ending cadence of open strings against half-step dissonances a little more oomph ImO. also the 3rd not of the 3rd quintuplet of the forth measure should be Gb (which is what i played and how it&apos;s written in the tab) and not the Ab of the notation (thatwas just a mistake) .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, on these types of difficult rhythms there are a lot of<br/>&gt; different ways to think of them....i mean i made the ending<br/>&gt; quintuplets easy by phrasing them in groups of six which are more<br/>&gt; normalish for most players.But hey, even someone as ferociously<br/>&gt; rhythmically difficult as Braxton has said something to the effect of<br/>&gt; &quot;count the ones strong and cram the rest in&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel \\\\\\<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi paul, i&apos;d be happy to post some other short and (relatively) simple<br/>&gt; lick type stuff, and would encourage others to play them or share<br/>&gt; theirs and let others take a stab at them.....anyway, Brouwer is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Brouwer</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I always loved Villa Lobos&apos; guitar writing, and Brouwer kind of took<br/>&gt; it a step down the road IMO......there are a several nice guitar<br/>&gt; collections on Naxos FWiW<br/>&gt; anyway, thanks for kind words about the myspace, i&apos;m happy with all<br/>&gt; those pieces but i really think Orpheus is as far out as i can take<br/>&gt; that kind of phantasmagoric simultaneity in a notated piece.okay,be<br/>&gt; well, be creative<br/>&gt; daniel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu">http://tinyurl.com/3m7egu</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought Keel&apos;s Moth man Prophecies was actually a very good read<br/>&gt; (depending on your tolerance for these sorts of things)<br/>&gt; but in the very opening paragraphs he also cleverly sets up the gambit<br/>&gt; that the lines between hoax, misinterpretation, and truth are more<br/>&gt; breakable carapaces of the hard-governed world than most people would<br/>&gt; like to consider......<br/>&gt; anyway, anybody like to give the lick a go?<br/>&gt; it&apos;s short and guitaristic and easy enough given you can navigate the<br/>&gt; phrasing<br/>&gt; anyway, i&apos;d love to see some of these lists do more of this sort of<br/>&gt; thing (play-alongs, takes on tunes etc.).<br/>&gt; this particular one was done for the guitar oblique site as people<br/>&gt; wanted there wanted to here it/try it out<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.gtroblq.com/">http://www.gtroblq.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; music is good,<br/>&gt; imagination is better<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=20739 href="#20739">ðŸ”—</a>Chuckk Hubbard &#x3C;BadMuthaHubbard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2009 1:46:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There is such software, but there is also all the other software that can make crazy wild sounds that have never existed, morphing sounds into each other and such, that are very popular.
