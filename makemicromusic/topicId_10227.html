There is some degree of configurability in most I&apos;ve seen - it<br/>may not be what consider &quot;good quality&quot; tho.  You can use those effects<br/>to transform your replay from any sound source, including line in and CD.<br/>Then record the result, and write it to CD.</p><p>That&apos;s a zero-cost option, and uses chip hardware rather than software,<br/>which is a sight easier.  Still, if you want more configurability, you&apos;ll<br/>probably need software.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.15/82 - Release Date: 25/8/05</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2005 12:01:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote to Jon Wild:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jon,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;Jon - if you do get the chance to write about free options for this, I<br/>&gt; &gt;will probably need to do this again at some point after 30 days have<br/>&gt; &gt;passed, so feel free to let me/the list know. (Adobe Audition is $300)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aha, I *knew* I could do it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I originally thought of Audacity, which has gotten good marks for not only<br/>&gt; being free, but supporting 3 major computing platforms (Win, Mac, Linux).<br/>&gt; However, even though they &apos;support&apos; VST plugs, it is somewhat funky. So I<br/>&gt; kept looking, and...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Found a nice, completely free multi-track audio recorder/sequencer/mixer<br/>&gt; that completely supports VST plugins (so we have access to some very nice<br/>&gt; effects plugs in the freeware community). Point your brower to the Krystal<br/>&gt; Audio Engine:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.kreatives.org/kristal/index.php?section=details">http://www.kreatives.org/kristal/index.php?section=details</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was a completely painless install, and on startup you have multiple<br/>&gt; tracks of audio, a mixer, and a transport control bar.<br/>...</p><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>Sorry to say,  I couldn&apos;t get it to download AT ALL.
