I have CUbase 5 VST for PC and find<br/>it fairly intuitive and easy to use, although I don&apos;t use it for much<br/>more than VST plugins and midi sequencing.</p><p>Do i want a better card with more<br/>&gt; in&apos;s and out&apos;s?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mia has two 1/4 inch balanced in/ outs. Do i want/ need more?</p><p>What are you planning to use the card for?   I just recently bought<br/>an Aardvark Direct Pro 96, which is multiport, and am very happy with<br/>the sound quality although its already too limiting with only one<br/>midi I/O.<br/>&gt;<br/>Try www. <a href="http://audiomidi.com">audiomidi.com</a>, and ask for Miriam.  She knows a lot and I<br/>like their prices.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
