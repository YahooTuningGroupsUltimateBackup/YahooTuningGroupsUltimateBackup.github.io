Some other interesting articles in this magazine, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Plundering is, seemingly, the way of the future...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Internet, Napster, etc., etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right now, the economic model means that these things have to be shut<br/>&gt; down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HOWEVER, if we lived in a futuristic society where, somehow, all our<br/>&gt; needs were provided for, and information could be a *common* or<br/>&gt; *shared* resource, then we would *all* own what *each* one of us<br/>&gt; creates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The individual ego would be melded into the common organism.</p><p>This is interesting, Joe... it&apos;s exactly the kind of thing I<br/>was thinking as I&apos;ve been reading the posts in this thread.</p><p>I think sampling/quoting is here to stay, and simply because<br/>of the sheer number of composers and music-files available for<br/>free on the internet (both of which are constantly growing),<br/>I think it&apos;s only more likely that this type of compositional<br/>method will keep increasing in popularity.</p><p>One of the things I envision about this list is that we subscribers<br/>will *cooperate*, via the list, on new musical projects.  As with<br/>the fragment and its tuning I recently uploaded (01-7-30.mp3),<br/>I often put together tiny musical ideas for which I have no<br/>further inspiration.  Perhaps by sharing these little bits here<br/>others may get ideas for their continuation and eventually they<br/>will become real compositions.</p><p>BTW, &quot;Plunderphonics&quot; is the name of a seminal sampling-ripoff-reworking<br/>album consisting pretty much (or maybe even completely) of music by<br/>others.
