What a crackup this piece is.<br/>&gt; Is this the first we&apos;ve heard of your work?</p><p>Hi Jeff-<br/>Are you using &quot;royal We&quot;? :)  Actually I did post a couple of sound<br/>files sometime last fall.  I could post em again soon if you missed<br/>them -- let me know.  One was a silly little guitar thing in 11ET.<br/>The other was a clip from a group improvisational piece performed in<br/>Dec 2000.  I have a few more clips from that performance but before I<br/>go posting those on the internet I should make sure the other<br/>performers are ok with that.</p><p>The reactions to &quot;Four Quarters&quot; are amusing.  I hadn&apos;t really<br/>thought about it, but I suppose it is kinda warped.  I started just<br/>playing little patterns wherever there was a 36/35 quarter-tone on my<br/>JI fretboard and (sort of) worked out a sketch around it.  Listening<br/>back to it I realize that hammering on those small intervals (rather<br/>than picking each note) just gives it a wavering, bending sound rather<br/>than clear distinct notes.  But I guess that&apos;s ok.</p><p>&gt; Keep it coming; would love to hear some recent works<br/>&gt; too if at all possible.</p><p>The 11ET thing was the most recent thing to wind up on tape.  I just<br/>recently got the guitars out again after having to store them away<br/>for a few weeks... long story.  I&apos;ve been noodling a little bit but<br/>not &quot;working&quot; on anything.  I could just let the tape run while<br/>improvising out of the blue, but that&apos;s not necessarily what I like<br/>to share in public.  Generally the more recent it is, the more clumsy<br/>it will be...</p><p>I&apos;m also tempted to put up a couple of pre-microtonal items--<br/>possibly in the metatuning folder?-- just for fun.  Actually there&apos;s<br/>enough sliding around between notes to possibly justify a microtonal<br/>label.<br/>kp</p></div>
