All I have<br/>&gt;is this announcement:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The University of Minnesota School of Music is proud to present<br/>&gt;&gt; the 2005 Spark Festival of Electronic Music and Art, February 17-20.<br/>&gt;&gt; The festival will be held at the West Bank Arts Quarter on the<br/>&gt;&gt; University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus. Now in its third year,<br/>&gt;&gt; the Spark Festival showcases the newest groundbreaking works of<br/>&gt;&gt; digital music and art. Last year&apos;s festival included innovative<br/>&gt;&gt; works by over sixty international composers and artists.<br/>&gt;&gt; Leading scholars and technology specialists also presented papers<br/>&gt;&gt; relating to new technology and creativity.</p><p>Crap, I had to turn in that piece earlier today.  Maybe I can<br/>add this during editing. . .</p><p>Anywho, this could be a regular thing -- I do one every month.<br/>But I&apos;m always two months out.  So next month will be for March.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
