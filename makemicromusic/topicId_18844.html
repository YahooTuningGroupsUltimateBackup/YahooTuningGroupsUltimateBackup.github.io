I am simply making microtonality easier than it has ever<br/>been. If this generates unfair criticisms, animosity, hostility and<br/>petty jealousies then so be it. My ideas are now on the internet and<br/>I doubt that anyone can stop them now. They will end up having a life<br/>of their own. And a very noble life at that.</p></div><h3><a id=18853 href="#18853">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2008 5:59:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i have never known Erv to write such things</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>robert thomas martin wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think anything of the sort.
