I have not worked the rules out for such things.<br/>In these rules which chord can follow which chord there are also rules that<br/>make each voice move &quot;diatonically&quot; (for a lack of a better word). And in my<br/>algorithm there&apos;s no crossing of the voices.<br/>This is all the algorithm does right now.<br/>Though I doesn&apos;t really do this correctly yet because there&apos;s allways a held<br/>note at the moment. I&apos;m making a version today which doesn&apos;t need to hold a<br/>note anymore.<br/>My new version will also allow for instance the following chord sequence:<br/>v1      v2     v3      v4      v5<br/>1/1    2/1    3/1    4/1     5/1<br/>4/3    2/1    8/3    10/3   20/3<br/>3/2    9/4    3/1    15/4   15/2<br/>1/1    2/1    3/1    4/1     5/1</p><p>The mp3 I posted doesn&apos;t do this yet.</p><p>&gt; - Could be cool to work your algorithm from a traditional cantus firmus<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes I thought thesame too :)<br/>It will work.

Sounds nice too.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve downloaded a &quot;free try before you buy&quot; version of Native Instruments<br/>Komplete.<br/>The choir is in the library that comes with it for Kontakt 4. I simply ran 5<br/>instances of it so it does all the voices correctly with pitchbend tuning.<br/>I don&apos;t have any money now to buy anything, but saving up for Synful.

It works by simply shifting<br/>notes of a chord up or down by an octave.<br/>One can do this aswell (octave equivalent shifting) with the notes that come<br/>from the permutations (as long as one remembers and works with the original<br/>permutation structure and doesn&apos;t reinterpret octave shifted notes as a<br/>permutation chord which would often result in not allowed permutations after<br/>that) although this will offcourse have some effect on voices, I haven&apos;t<br/>worked out additional rules for this.<br/>Btw I&apos;m not minding gcd or anything like that at all, it doesn&apos;t have any<br/>use really in working with my theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;And in my algorithm there&apos;s no crossing of the voices.&quot;<br/>&gt; So in other words each note in the second chord can&apos;t be higher than the<br/>&gt; note over that note in the first chord OR lower than the note under that<br/>&gt; note in the first chord (thus making the chord have to either &quot;slide&quot; either<br/>&gt; up or down or consendense/ expand to an extent, but never do both at the same<br/>&gt; time to a huge extent)?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The voices can become higher or lower than it&apos;s neighbour voice previously<br/>was, in a next chord, but then the neighbouring voice will drop aswell.<br/>What I mean is that for instance the highest voice will allways stay the<br/>highest voice and can&apos;t yet walk all the way down to become the lowest<br/>voice.</p><p>One thing to easily work out a permutation possiblity is like this:<br/>Take the 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 chord.<br/>it has the intervals 2/1,then 3/2 then 4/3 then 5/4<br/>A permutation is to simply shuffle the order of these intervals, so first<br/>3/2, then 5/4, then 2/1, then 4/3 for instance.<br/>Now this new permutated chord can be relevant to the 1/1 (1/1 stays thesame)<br/>or 2/1 (2/1 stays thesame) etc.<br/>When relevant to 2/1 you get the following chord sequence:<br/>1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1<br/>4/3 2/1 5/2 5/1 20/3</p><p>Now the way my algorithm did the mp3 was simply by doing thesame permutation<br/>thing again and certering it on any of the 5 tones (so keeping atleast one<br/>voice in common)<br/>Please do not that voice one can center on voice one, voice 2 can center on<br/>voice 2, but voice 1 can&apos;t center on voice 2!</p><p>So for instance:<br/>1/1 (2/1) 3/1 4/1 5/1<br/>4/3 (2/1) (5/2) 5/1 20/3<br/>1/1 5/4  (5/2) 15/4 5/1</p><p>(to avoid confusion, note that even though 5/1 is on each of the chords, it<br/>is first voice 5 that is 5/1, then voice 4, then voice 5 again. so there is<br/>no voice that plays 5/1 constantly)</p><p>The way my mp3 worked wasn&apos;t complete.<br/>There are additional permutation possibilities which I&apos;ll explain now.<br/>What I should have written (and will write later today) was this:</p><p>Instead of going directly from 4/3 2/1 5/2 5/1 20/3 to 1/1 5/4 5/2 15/4 5/1<br/>by a permutation centered on voice 3: 5/2<br/>One should really go from 4/3 2/1 5/2 5/1 20/3 to a 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1<br/>chord first (but not play it!) which is centered on any of the voices of the<br/>previous chord. And THEN do a permutation of this 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 chord<br/>(which IS played (and can offcourse beceme 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 again as<br/>itself as one of the possiblities) .<br/>This then is a correct purmutation, it includes all of the results of the<br/>previous method, and adds several other possibilities where there is not a<br/>note connected.<br/>So for instance<br/>1/1 (2/1) 3/1 4/1 5/1<br/>4/3 (2/1) (5/2) 5/1 20/3<br/>-&gt; [15/16 15/8 5/2 15/4 75/16]  (this is a 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 chord<br/>centered randomly on 5/2, it is NOT played it is simply for working out the<br/>permutation)<br/>1/1 5/4 (5/2) (15/4) 5/1  (one of the possible permutations of [15/16 15/8<br/>5/2 15/4 75/16] centered on for instance voice 3 or 4)<br/>or alternatively (15/16) (15/8) 45/16 (15/4) (75/16)  (see this one has no<br/>note in common with 4/3 2/1 5/2 5/1 20/3)</p><p>Marcel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>prentrodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2009 6:41:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel,<br/>This is a great start.
