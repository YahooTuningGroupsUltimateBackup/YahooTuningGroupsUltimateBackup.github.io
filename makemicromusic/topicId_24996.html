Remembering musicians like Bird or Monk as<br/>blues players is absurd, and calling all American music blues just<br/>makes the term meaningless.  Ragtime predates the blues, for starters.<br/>Rock came out of R&amp;B, which was a radio-commercialized, danceable<br/>take on the blues, yes.

And I don&apos;t think black musicians had SO big influence on American music. There&apos;s also European church music, folk music and art music , Latin music, later also Asian music coming with all those immigrants to the Wild West.</p><p>You are right about blues, but that&apos;s base only for melody and basic atmosphere. When we talk about jazz we have to count also liturgic stream starting somewhere at Protestant church Anthems and going to spirituals, Gospel and Soul (in synthesis with chants and shouts). Then European military marching and brassband music leading to Dixieland (originally performed by black musicians), European popular marches+dancing music of 19th century (like polka, quadrille, galop, Vienna waltz, French cancan etc.) where ragtime originated (also invention of black musicians), and later also influences of European art music (impressionism, expressionism, serial music, timbre music, aleatorics...), Latin music (Spanish, Brazilian, Cuban, Caribic...), American Country and much much later other world music.</p><p>Harmonic form of 12-bar blues was also base for boogie-woogie and rock&apos;n&apos;roll, so this tradition was kept really long. Blues is very flexible and open, that&apos;s why it&apos;s still living.</p><p>What about Mark Knopfler&apos;s Dire Straits, Animals, John Mayall, Johny Winter, Fleetwood Mac, Yardbirds, Eric Clapton&apos;s Cream, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Rory Gallagher, Ry Cooder, Carlos Santana and many others? And art music was influenced by blues as well.</p><p>And Neil, don&apos;t be afraid, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a lot of people loving blues, listening to it and performing it, even in this group of experimental music. Count me, too, on piano, synthesizers and Hammond organ :-). For us musicians living long years behind the Iron Curtain blues was a connection to the Western culture, to American culture, tolerated by communistic government - they couldn&apos;t prohibit it despite all their effort as we had an excellent argument why to play it: it was a music of poor black American workers suppressed by evil white capitalistic Uncle Toms from Wall Street :-) Performing it we showed our solidarity with them and with liberation and emancipation movement. At least to the official structures and censors. The real reason was we just  loved blues.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 28 Jan 2011, at 9:42 AM, Dante Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; Neil is absolutely right.

The fact is today most blues is watered-down &quot;blues rock&quot;, slick macho suburban bar-band drivel that has nothing to do with what the blues used to be/can be...patterned more after George Thorogood than any of the old greats like Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Howlin&apos; Wolf, etc.  At least out here in the San Francisco Bay Area, the blues is about the cleanest/yuppiest style of music you can find--any time you go to a big outdoor festival, there&apos;s ALWAYS some kinda slick yuppie blues band playing the same ol&apos; shit, all polished up neat and slick.  Every single one of them plays &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;.  No matter what the blues used to be, or can be at its best, what it *is* these days--on the stages, in the bars, wherever--is crap.  For every one decent blues musician out there who really feels and breathes the stuff, there&apos;s 400 wankers just out to cash in on the local food and art festival circuits.  So the yuppies can have something to &quot;boogie&quot; to between wine-tastings.  Hate to say it, but that&apos;s the same vibe I get from Catler&apos;s band.

Its like Hendrix again: everybody has played like him ever since,<br/>so its hard to realize how unique he was at the time. Every style of<br/>american music has the blues in it, so its possible to take it for granted.</p><p>having said that, there are some kinds of music that are, in their authentic<br/>versions, so tied to a particular ethnic group, or a particular time and<br/>place, that anyone or anything that does not belong to this group, time or<br/>place is just gonna be a pale imitation. Eric Clapton plays the blues? yeah,<br/>right. how many crackers really play the blues? theres Johnny Winter for<br/>sure, Duane Allman. then theres.....</p><p>how many authentic american flamenco guitarists are there? 0</p><p>some music becomes more inclusive: there are alot more authentic white jazz<br/>musicians, even though 95% of the real stuff was at least initiated by<br/>brothers.</p><p>Beethoven is so remote now that all bets are off and the halls of Juilliard<br/>teem with Koreans and Chinese who play that stuff just as good as any german<br/>now.</p><p>but blues as an authentic expression only happened in the delta chicago and<br/>a few other places early in the 20th c and then settled down into a style<br/>that could be produced and reproduced by anyone who at least came from a<br/>similar culture. bb king  and all the other kings for example. but a white<br/>boy from the suburbs? sure he can copy the licks, like Stevie Ray and<br/>multitudes of others, but that aint it.</p><p>but as a musical influence, blues is everywhere. i always tell students when<br/>i teach them the 12 bar blues and the minor pentatonic that they can go<br/>anywhere in the world, Tokyo whatever, and jam with other musicians just<br/>knowing this one thing. It really is the lingua franca now, if there is one<br/>at all.</p><p>On Thu, Apr 7, 2011 at 8:19 PM, cityoftheasleep &lt;<a href="mailto:igliashon@sbcglobal.net">igliashon@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What the blues *is* and what the blues *can be* at its best are two<br/>&gt; different things.

Every single one of them<br/>&gt; plays &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;. No matter what the blues used to be, or can be at its<br/>&gt; best, what it *is* these days--on the stages, in the bars, wherever--is<br/>&gt; crap. For every one decent blues musician out there who really feels and<br/>&gt; breathes the stuff, there&apos;s 400 wankers just out to cash in on the local<br/>&gt; food and art festival circuits.
