I guess someone making instruments in some tradition<br/>has great advantage in the lessons it represents that came from past<br/>mistakes -- and sometimes when these are forgotten it might imply to<br/>today&apos;s innovator that other things were never done before because<br/>they weren&apos;t possible or weren&apos;t thought up or were bad ideas, or that<br/>the whole tradition was due to a genius, or idiot. My approach is I<br/>try looking for the mistakes instead of finished conclusions.
