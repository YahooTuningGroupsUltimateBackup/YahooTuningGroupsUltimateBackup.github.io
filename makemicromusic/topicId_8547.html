I like the slowly evolving theme on L.O.V.E. There is a distracting part when someone says out loud: &quot;I&apos;m sorry that piano needs to be muted&quot;, and a few coughs now and then. It sounds like a real concert! Keep it up, by all means, send more, ask for more people to listen and comment. That&apos;s what we are hear for. Many of us have only a few hours a week that we can listen to music, so that may explain the high download:comment ratio.</p><p>There is a real nice part at 5:30 that shows your flair for the microtonal. We need more.</p><p>Prent</p><p>&gt;Hey, after I posted a couple days ago, I can tell my the page stats<br/>&gt;that people have been listening, but I haven&apos;t gotten any feedback<br/>&gt;yet! (hint, hint)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyway, I put another one up, this one is my biggest project to date,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;with strings, keyboards, voices, and computer.  It&apos;s called<br/>&gt;&quot;Beresheit.&quot;  The scale is made up of the first 24 unique overtones.<br/>&gt;(I picked 24 to get semi-octave equivalence on the keyboard)  I know<br/>&gt;there are lots of other exciting discussions going on, but I&apos;d<br/>&gt;appreciate some feedback!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Chris<br/>--</p></div>
