Which should make making musically interesting music easyer, not harder.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not hearing any of the above benefits back in the untwelve competition.<br/>I really think just about any music list or forum with the same amount of people holding a composition / music production competition for normal 12tet music would produce many more better sounding more musically enjoyable music.</p><p>So in my opinion, tuning research as far as it stands now on these lists, is not giving any overall advantage for making actual music, rather it&rsquo;s a big disadvantage.<br/>The disadvantage probably comes from many things, such as difficulty / extra work in tuning  instruments, all the extra work in working out the tuning / ratios etc for all the notes which also severely complicates composition in most cases, the out of tune sound that most often results, etc.</p><p>So if tuning research isn&rsquo;t generally at the point on these lists that it helps in music making, does it at least hold this promise for the future and are people here actively and productively researching tuning to achieve that goal?<br/>Well, somewhat actively yes, but productively? I&rsquo;d have to say no.<br/>What I see is a whole lot of people sticking their head in the sand for what really needs to be done.<br/>Some of the great errors in tuning practice are so incredibly apparent, but nobody seems to be doing any serious work in these directions.<br/>The biggest example being common practice music tuning.<br/>How can everybody on these lists just sit here work on all kinds of things, yet the most basic problem of how to tune common practice music best isn&rsquo;t solved!<br/>How can one expect to do difficult / complex things in tuning and get musical results when one doesn&rsquo;t even understand the basics.<br/>It just seems so obvious to me. Solve how to tune common practice music in Just Intonation, and you will lay the foundation for how music works and can experiment with more alternative tunings from there.<br/>But somehow tuning common practice music to JI is very unpopular here. Why? Too difficult? Is the majority here a quitter?<br/>I don&rsquo;t think you can get around this one,  I think it&rsquo;s essential common practice music in JI it is to be truly solved before microtonal music will become practical for people to make better music (not worse music as is the case now).<br/>I just wish more people would take it on.</p><p>I&rsquo;m writing this very unpopular email in the hope it&rsquo;s of help to some of you and to tuning research in general.<br/>(not to troll Carl, I&rsquo;m not writing this for attention or wish to get caught up in long discussion or flames)<br/>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many in disagreement with what I write, some with long toes will feel insulted (which is not my intention).<br/>I hope if you feel the need to reply negatively, that you will write truly insulting emails etc. to me personally and not bother the whole list.</p><p>-Marcel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=25705 href="#25705">ðŸ”—</a>jsmith9624@...</h3><span>2/11/2011 9:50:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well.</p><p>I must say, Marcel, you&apos;re certainly entitled to your opinion.

And I like both you and what you&apos;re doing in music.<br/>I merely found (after listening to most of the entries) that the overal musical and production quality was very low.</p><p>But as for your personal composition.<br/>First of all, my ears don&apos;t agree to pianoteq being the best piano sound.<br/>It may be the most playable / responsive computer piano around. But it&apos;s timbre isn&apos;t as good as a real / well sampled piano. Bare like you pay it pianoteq sounds weak and unrich in several ways to me.<br/>I&apos;m not really up to date on the latest sampled pianos. Last time I did a quick check I think I found galaxy pianos or something like that ok for general grand pianos sound.<br/>Though I know usable grand piano sample libraries have been around for about a decade now that if produced right sound better than pianoteq (for instance postpiano produced nice characterful ones, listen to the piano pieces on aphex twin drukqs where I think he uses them through an old quantec reverb. Every piano pieces has it&apos;s own sound, all very nice.<br/>As for your piece, I like some parts of your composition, but not all, it&apos;s often a bit empty amongst other things. Though I think it&apos;s good you&apos;ve managed to use such extreme microtonality and yet not create a strong out of tune / hurts my ears feel to it as is most often the case in strong microtonal songs on these lists.<br/>As for your playing, I don&apos;t like the dynamics.

And amazing in a way to get such expressive music from what I think is a sample library? Which one btw, vsl?<br/>My only real negative comment on this piece is the &quot;stuttering&quot;.. What&apos;s up with that?<br/>Sound like a computer running out of juice when playing the song or something, what&apos;s going on there? Can&apos;t be intentional it seems to me.</p><p>One other one I hadn&apos;t heard yet was Domina Catrina Lee&apos;s piece.<br/>I don&apos;t think the music is very strong, and it could do with slightly better mixing and a mastering touch-up.<br/>But overall very well produced! I like it.</p><p>These were the only 2 that to me that met competition goals, of finished recordings that would be ready for the general public (with the reserves I&apos;ve mentioned above)<br/>There were many other entries that had things in them that I liked though.

When they applied this<br/>to an old caveman dwelling, they heard this most amazing transcript of a<br/>group of people who were speaking.</p><p>=====<br/>My fellow cavemen,</p><p>After listening to most of the undrum competition entries, all I can<br/>think is what a bunch of crap.</p><p>It&apos;s all musically extremely uninteresting combined with the poor<br/>qualities of the materials used and varying degrees of out of rhythm-ness.</p><p>It made me wonder (shake my head in disbelief even) how such a large<br/>group of largely intelligent cavemen can be so extremely unproductive<br/>after such a long time.</p><p>Using non-drum instruments is supposed to do several things I think.<br/>- Provide better sound when such heavy emphasis on banging is not wanted<br/>- Give interesting new musical possibilities with a deeper or new &quot;feel&quot;<br/>or sound to them.<br/>- And most importantly, using non-drum instruments should give insight<br/>into the function of sound and rhythm that normal drumming theory can&apos;t.<br/>Which should make making musically interesting music easyer, not harder.</p><p>I&apos;m not hearing any of the above benefits back in the undrum competition.</p><p>I really think just about any forum with the same amount of people<br/>holding a music competition for normal drum music would produce many<br/>more better sounding more enjoyable music.</p><p>So in my opinion, non-drum research as far as it stands now in these<br/>meetings, is not giving any overall advantage for making actual music,<br/>rather it&apos;s a big disadvantage.</p><p>The disadvantage probably comes from many things, such as difficulty /<br/>extra work in stretching strings across drum bodies or making tubes to<br/>blow through, all the extra work in trying to make pitches sound good<br/>together which also severely complicates composition in most cases, the<br/>grating sound that often results, etc.</p><p>So if non-drum research isn&apos;t generally at the point that it helps in<br/>music making, does it at least hold this promise for the future and are<br/>people here actively and productively researching non-drum music to<br/>achieve that goal?</p><p>Well, somewhat actively yes, but productively? I&apos;d have to say no.</p><p>What I see is a whole lot of people sticking their head in the sand for<br/>what really needs to be done.</p><p>Some of the great errors in non-drum practice are so incredibly<br/>apparent, but nobody seems to be doing any serious work in these directions.</p><p>I&apos;m saying this very unpopular speech in the hope it&apos;s of help to some<br/>of you and to music research in general. (Not to troll Og, I&apos;m not<br/>saying this for attention. But if it brings on flames, that&apos;s not so<br/>bad. Fire is tough to make.
