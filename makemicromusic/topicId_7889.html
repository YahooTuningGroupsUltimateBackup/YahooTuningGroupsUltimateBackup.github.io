They actually *welcome* microtonal music, which is<br/>exceptional for string players... :) and specifically *asked* for a<br/>microtonal piece.</p><p>This is the duo that performed last year on Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM<br/>series.</p><p>I&apos;ve posted this piece up on my &quot;Tuning Lab&quot; site, rather than my<br/>composition site on SoundClick since it really is just a MIDI demo.</p><p>I note there has been a lot of discussion on MakeMicroMusic recently<br/>about making wonderful demos for performers.  However, I really don&apos;t<br/>think it makes all that much difference to them, based upon my<br/>experiences.  They really just want to go and play the piece<br/>themselves, so they&apos;re only listening to get an idea of it...</p><p>So, if you&apos;re demanding wonderful cello sounds, you won&apos;t hear them,<br/>since is still my old MIDI system with TX81Zs.  I&apos;m hoping to upgrade<br/>to a software synth and soundfonts fairly soon, but, in the meantime,<br/>this is a usable demo.  Oh... there are no *dynamics* in it, either,<br/>but who needs them, anyway... :)  The &quot;Blackjack&quot; pitches are pretty<br/>accurate, though, with the tuning-table-based synths; I think moreso<br/>than with pitch bend approaches...</p><p>Anyway, here is the piece:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/5/tuninglabmusic.htm">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/5/tuninglabmusic.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;m happy to hear any criticism, the good, bad or ugly.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=7891 href="#7891">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

Well, the timbre thing<br/>will be improved when my new computer arrives.  Now I&apos;m told it will<br/>be in a couple of weeks... :) (a friend who does this... don&apos;t<br/>ask...:)</p><p>I think it&apos;s pretty hard to argue in favor of a less realistic<br/>timbre... so I won&apos;t bother, but I think the phrasing and bowing is<br/>probably what you&apos;re missing in the first section which makes it less<br/>appealing than it should be.  Ideally, this should be followed with<br/>the score, which isn&apos;t ready yet...</p><p>(It will be in the new Saggital-Wilson notation of 72-tET)</p><p>Glad you like the &quot;wild&quot; section.  I thought maybe I was going a bit<br/>overboard with that, but everybody seems to like it, even the<br/>American microtonal composer John Eaton, who was over here visiting<br/>the other night (he *also* did find the cello patches rather<br/>cloying...)</p><p>Yes, this is mostly just an improvisation which was later notated.<br/>You know, that was a very interesting process.  Did you ever try to<br/>actually notate what is essentially an *aural* experience?  I guess<br/>it would be a little like Messiaen writing down birdsong, or<br/>transcribing African natives or such like...  It actually isn&apos;t that<br/>easy.  I found I got &quot;better&quot; at it by the end of the piece, so I<br/>went back and &quot;fixed&quot; the first few minutes.  But, yes, any<br/>discrepancies in the aural score were &quot;fixed&quot; or maybe &quot;notationally<br/>quantised&quot; in the written version...</p><p>Thanks again for the commentary!</p><p>Joseph</p><p>P.S. I apologize to everybody for writing so many messages, but I was<br/>two months behind on this list, and this is a &quot;happening&quot; place these<br/>days... I&apos;ll try to keep more &quot;up-to-date...&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=7897 href="#7897">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2004 5:42:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf1@a...&gt;</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/7892">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/7892</a></p><p> wrote:<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   The &quot;Blackjack&quot; pitches are pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; accurate, though, with the tuning-table-based synths; I think<br/>moreso<br/>&gt; &gt; than with pitch bend approaches...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t count on the Soundfonts being more accurate -- when they are<br/>based<br/>&gt; on samples of acoustic instruments, the intonation can be wildly<br/>and<br/>&gt; erratically off.   At least pitch bends applied to synthesized<br/>sounds<br/>&gt; will be consistant and off by a known amount.</p><p>***Got it.
