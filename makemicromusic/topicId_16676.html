It&apos;s great if you<br/>&gt;  like<br/>&gt; composing on paper and then transferring to a pretty publish-able<br/>&gt; score. (Unlike Finale/Sibelius, that try to be composing<br/>&gt; environments.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>I use Finale.  Yes, it costs money, but these days it&apos;s extremely flexible and sophisticated. Tuplets of any complexity are no problem whatsoever. And you can notate them in almost any way you like.  (The only issue might be barring/beaming/tupletting across the barlines, but I doubt that any other notation program handles that very well.  And finale CAN do it, but it does require some trickery).  You can also do space=time notation, and cutout scores fairly easily.  You can also do wierd time-signatures like 9/10, etc.</p><p>I believe Finale still wins over Sibelius if you want to put wierdo graphics in your score (like I use a bunch of different symbols and so on to signify computer-music textures.)</p><p>I should also say that I don&apos;t use Finale/Sibelius as a &quot;composing environment&quot; at all . . . I don&apos;t play MIDI into my computer (I don&apos;t eben own a MIDI keyboard), etc. etc.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example, with tuplets up the wazoo:<br/><a href="http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/balladei/balladei.pdf">http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/balladei/balladei.pdf</a></p><p>Check out this piano part:<br/><a href="http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/sacramento_mornings/sacremento6.pdf">http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/sacramento_mornings/sacremento6.pdf</a></p><p>Graphical pictures to represent computer-music textures:<br/><a href="http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/pipes/pno.elec.w.guitar.pdf">http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/pipes/pno.elec.w.guitar.pdf</a></p><p>Anyways, it works for me.</p><p>C B</p></div>
