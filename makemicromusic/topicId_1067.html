The<br/>&gt; compressed octave tuning used here is as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cents<br/>&gt; 0<br/>&gt; 188.423<br/>&gt; 361.020<br/>&gt; 457.515<br/>&gt; 949.843<br/>&gt; 1057.155<br/>&gt; 1198.347<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those like myself, who are interested in Just Intonation, and<br/>&gt; have been following the recent threads about Spectral Tuning, allow<br/>&gt; me to say that this is *another* kind of JI - that which is tailor<br/>&gt; made for inharmonic timbres. It is a quest in itself and an<br/>expansion<br/>&gt; of the concepts of conventional JI with harmonic timbres. Even<br/>though<br/>&gt; we may not be able to speak about the same quality of consonance<br/>that<br/>&gt; we experience with JI ratios played on harmonic timbres - because<br/>&gt; inharmonic timbres frequently have &quot;beating&quot; within the timbres<br/>&gt; themselves - when one matches the tuning to the partials of the<br/>&gt; instruments being used in the music, then the ensembles sound more<br/>&gt; consonant in their own unique way, because as one can easily see<br/>and<br/>&gt; hear, when one plays dyads (or chords with more notes resulting<br/>from<br/>&gt; combined melodies), in which the intervals align to the partials<br/>&gt; found in the timbre, it has an overall more resonant and sweet<br/>sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This whole idea is a matter of hot dispute amongst some, and in<br/>&gt; discussions I&apos;ve have with former group member Kraig Grady, and<br/>&gt; others, they have stated that they feel the fundamentals are the<br/>most<br/>&gt; important thing to tune by (please note: I have also tuned<br/>inharmonic<br/>&gt; timbres to JI a plenty as well). *But* in the sense they were<br/>&gt; speaking of, the instruments had Helmholtz resonators (which make<br/>&gt; them able to produce strong fundamental tones). Idiophones however<br/>do<br/>&gt; not (gongs, etc...), nor can we really say that inharmonic<br/>electronic<br/>&gt; timbres do either, even though they may sometimes functionally<br/>behave<br/>&gt; so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All I can affirm though, is that it is beautiful to me ears, and<br/>IMHO<br/>&gt; it is such a rich and fertile field for creative exploration. One<br/>&gt; hugely important and fun part of this for me is how one may use<br/>such<br/>&gt; ideas to create tunings fitted for the unique inharmonic timbres<br/>&gt; being used in a given composition, which can have radically<br/>different<br/>&gt; partial structures, and yield totally different scales each time.</p><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>This was a wonderful and inspiring statement, and I completely<br/>understand where you&apos;re coming from!</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it be fair to say, though, that the scales you&apos;re deriving<br/>are simply the analogues to a single harmonic series in ordinary JI?</p><p>May I suggest that, just as most music with harmonic timbres is not<br/>based on harmonic series scales but rather on JI and tempered<br/>periodicity blocks, that an analogous means of construction (based on<br/>the intervals in the spectra you&apos;re working with) could be a most<br/>fruitful approach for taking fuller advantage of the effects you&apos;ve<br/>described above, while also adding melodic features you&apos;ll probably<br/>like?</p><p>Should you be interested in persuing this further, you could respond<br/>on the main tuning list, perhaps with a spectrum or two of interest.</p><p>Highest regards,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2001 7:39:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., jacky_ligon@y... wrote:</p><p>&gt; What is your opinion about this method of deriving the tuning from<br/>an<br/>&gt; FFT of a composite sample of all the timbres used in a composition?</p><p>Hmm . . . one would probably be interested in sub-systems of this<br/>where different instruments play different notes depending on what<br/>other instuments are playing . . . sounds complicated.
