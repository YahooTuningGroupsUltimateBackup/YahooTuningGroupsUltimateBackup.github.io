The files are mp3 -- in most cases just<br/>what the author gave me (I converted Jon&apos;s file from<br/>FLAC to WAV and then to mp3) except normalized, retagged,<br/>and renamed.</p><p>I collected all the posts about the pieces, and pasted<br/>them together into liner notes (copied below; also in the<br/>zip file).</p><p>The quality of pieces here is really high.</p><p>The mixed version should be done uploading by the time I<br/>wake up!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>-Carl</p><p>MMM Day 2006 liner notes!!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1 - Dave Seidel - Sunday Afternoon</p><p>&quot;Sunday Afternoon&quot; is a piece of (gasp) tonal chamber music.  I put this<br/>one out a few days ago as a MIDI retuning/rendering challenge here and<br/>on the Tuning list.  This version is from JL Smith.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2 - Herman Miller - Lemba Galatsia</p><p>Lemba Galatsia is the latest result of my explorations into lemba<br/>temperament (named after a fictional island).  Lemba was one of many<br/>7-limit temperaments included in a long list that Gene Ward Smith<br/>detailed on the tuning-math list.  At the time I referred to it simply<br/>as &quot;Number 82&quot;.  I&apos;d been looking around for useful temperaments that<br/>may have been overlooked, and this one immediately attracted my<br/>attention.  It has a useful 10-note basic scale, and two identical<br/>periods in the octave (it repeats at the tritone).  Since 50/49 is<br/>tempered out, the tritone can represent either 7/5 or 10/7.</p><p>A while back I noticed that lemba temperament actually has a pretty good<br/>whole-tone scale.  It has three different sizes of thirds, but two of<br/>them are close to the same size (around the size of 14/11); the other<br/>third is flatter than 5/4.  So it occurred to me to try retuning<br/>Galatsia, which I wrote back in 1979, since it uses the whole tone scale<br/>in a couple of places.  I tried to keep more or less the original<br/>melody, but I&apos;ve changed the harmony in some places to show off some of<br/>the harmonic possibilities of the 7-limit harmony approximations in<br/>lemba temperament.</p><p>I used mainly the EDIROL VSC for this new version, with the NI Absynth 3<br/>for the brass and some of the accompaniment parts.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3 - Bill Sethares - MysteryX</p><p>The piece MysteryX was sequenced using a drum controller (Roland<br/>handsonic) for percussion and a wind controller (Yamaha WX) for<br/>everything else.  All the sounds are from the &quot;VSL Kontakt Orchestra&quot;,<br/>though with the timbres mapped to match the tuning, which was done by<br/>Little Miss Scale Oven.  The &quot;X&quot; stands for 10-tet.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>4 - Jacob Barton - Seventeen Pno</p><p>Two grand pianos, at right angle (sharps on the left blacks, flats on<br/>the right); one man, in wrong mood; five minutes glean&apos;d from<br/>fourty-one; a faulty mini-disc, or microphone, leading to poor quality.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5 - Jon Lyle Smith - Quincunx</p><p>The original working title of this piece was, &quot;THE MARTYRDOM OF SAINT<br/>HAROLD: Being the musical Depiction of Harold of Partch, the Blessed<br/>Patron Saint of Just Intonation; and his Martyrdom by upon a burning<br/>Pyre of his collected Works -- by an evil Cult of Tempered Theorists,<br/>led by his Nemesis, the unspeakable Professor Moriarty, a<br/>Mathematician&quot;.</p><p>After due consideration however, I opted for this title.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>6 - Graham Breed - MMMDay piece</p><p>I used Csound with existing instruments.  It uses an ssssL pentatonic<br/>scale with different tunings.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>7 - Jon Szanto - Do Something</p><p>How could I pass by a day in honor of the music of the very list I<br/>helped start???  It would be churlish and desultory, and what better<br/>reason to stay up until 4:30 in the morning?</p><p>When I&apos;ve had the rare time to sit down and play, I&apos;ve been living<br/>inside of one of Al-Farabi&apos;s scales, the Greek genus chromaticum forte.<br/>But I decided to fill out 12 notes, and utilized Kyle Gann&apos;s chart to<br/>find likely candidates for an interesting - and decidedly non-ET -<br/>grouping of pitches.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>8 - Yahya Abdal-Aziz - Bunga Seroja</p><p>I have the pleasure to announce a tiny submission, my arrangement of a<br/>traditional Malay tune, performed by Jon L. Smith.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>9/10 - Carl Lumma - Sunny Shores</p><p>Sunny Shores is a 2-part piece I wrote on manuscript in 1997.  It was<br/>originally conceived in 12-tET.  I used the following method to perform<br/>it microtonally...</p><p>Music was entered into Encore (<a href="http://www.gvox.com">www.gvox.com</a>) with a mouse and saved as<br/>MIDI.  The resulting file for part 2 was then &quot;humanized&quot; slightly with<br/>Gunter Nagler&apos;s free MIDIHUM tool, to make chord attacks less annoying.<br/>Both performances can still safely be described as lifeless.</p><p>Scala was used to retune (with pitch bends) the files in about two dozen<br/>different 12-note scales from my scale library, with the help of a batch<br/>file in Windows XP.  I also retuned part 2 in a number of ways with<br/>John deLaubenfels&apos; BGE adaptive retuning program (<a href="http://www.adaptune.com">www.adaptune.com</a>).<br/>The results were auditioned in Winamp.</p><p>John&apos;s 7-limit adaptive tuning sounded best for part 2, but the MIDI<br/>file had some pitch-bendy glitches (in Winamp, anyway), so I decided<br/>against it.  And none of the fixed scales I tried really worked, so I<br/>made one up based on what I&apos;d heard, and by looking at the score.  I<br/>used meantone as a backbone -- turned out it was possible to bring the<br/>septimal intervals up front without having the wolf occur at all.</p><p>!<br/> Empirically-derived scale for &quot;Sunny Shores part 2&quot;, Carl Lumma, 2006.<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 79.<br/> 194.<br/> 273.<br/> 388.<br/> 503.<br/> 551.<br/> 697.<br/> 791.<br/> 891.<br/> 970.<br/> 1085.<br/> 1200.<br/>!<br/>! 697-cent meantone (Bb-F wolf) with 11/8 and 30/19.</p><p>Part 1 is tuned in the 12-tone MOS of the 7-limit TOP augmented<br/>temperament.</p><p>The music was rendered to CD-quality WAV with Audio Compositor and<br/>Philippe Guillaume&apos;s version of Trachtman&apos;s &apos;Steinway C&apos; soundfont.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>11 - Rick McGowan - Five minute symphony in 15-tet</p><p>This here is a &quot;Five Minute Symphony in 15-tet&quot; consisting of 3 short<br/>movements.  It is realized with Garritan Personal Orchestra with<br/>microtuning courtesy of Fractal Tune Smithy.  Of course the tuning is<br/>15-tone equal.  It&apos;s scored for a small orchestra consisting of winds<br/>and brass in ones, piano, and strings.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></div><h3><a id=12887 href="#12887">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2006 4:44:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The mixed version should be done uploading by the time<br/>&gt;I wake up!</p><p>We&apos;re in luck, I&apos;m still up.</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/music/MMMDayMixup.mp3">http://lumma.org/music/MMMDayMixup.mp3</a></p><p>It&apos;s 44 megs.

I didn&apos;t say *couldn&apos;t*:</p><p>&quot;How possible is it to write interesting music in 3/4/5 tet? Give yourself a test: write a melodic line - no accompanying parts whatsoever - in one of those, and see if you can come up with something that is memorable or compelling listening-wise.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I could very well be missing the boat on this one. If you know of examples of 3/4/5 that can bear extended and repeated listenings, I&apos;d be curious. Whenever I&apos;ve messed around with 5, it&apos;s lack of a personality makes for rather directionless music. It is quite safe, as everything sounds &apos;ok&apos;, but unless the object is to just float for long periods of time, I&apos;m not getting it.&quot;</p><p>Beyond the fact that I didn&apos;t say one simply could not create interesting music in 5eq, one has to also note that the context of this was Gene speaking about his methodology for generating melodies and then fleshing out compositions with that raw material. Note that my basic question was of the nature &quot;I haven&apos;t been convinced, and that maybe I&apos;m missing something.&quot; So if anything, it was that *I* hadn&apos;t groked the unique musical qualities of 5.</p><p>So, Carl, you stand corrected.
