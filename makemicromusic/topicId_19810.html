And maximum &quot;punning&quot;, or double-meanings, amongst<br/>the intervals, within small tolerances and in a way that directly<br/>refers to the partials which are the &quot;key&quot; to the tuning.</p><p>You can demonstrate this to yourself: in this tuning, your &quot;shadow&quot;<br/>interval is the &quot;classic&quot;, discussed quite a bit on the Tuning list,<br/>422 cents. This is a Noble (phi mediant) interval, a point of maximum<br/>Harmonic Entropy, and very close to the mean of 14/11 and 9/7. It is<br/>ideal for floating a /11/, /9/-, and /7/ heavy JI structure within,<br/>but not directly on, 1:1 and 2:1, exactly as you have done by ear.</p><p>Bop up a 9/7 from that 422 cent shadow and what do you find? Your 857<br/>cent interval. In the meantime you&apos;ve made a fair pun with, or fuzzy<br/>detuning of, the inverse of 11/9, which is 18/11, and if you stick to<br/>that feeling as you wander about from there, using simpler Just<br/>intervals, you&apos;re going to wind up with a tuning that, wherever you<br/>play, tends to put energy (via coincidence and near-coincidence) into<br/>the region between the 7th and 11th partials: a kind of<br/>characteristic &quot;formant&quot; in the overall spectrum.</p><p>Anyway, from there, just wander up and down using simple Just<br/>intervals, and you&apos;ll immediately find 9 notes of your tuning. The<br/>other 3 are Just off the tonic, but I think they also &quot;pun&quot; with Just<br/>intervals in the series built off the &quot;shadow&quot; interval, don&apos;t have<br/>time to check.</p><p>This:</p><p>1/1<br/>70.672<br/>169.627<br/>296.175<br/>422.097<br/>527.349<br/>572.734<br/>692.177<br/>762.849<br/>857.181<br/>1024.372<br/>1095.045<br/>2/1</p><p>took less than 10 minutes to figure out, absolutely strictly<br/>following the rules of &quot;shadow tuning&quot;, and using the &quot;most classic&quot;<br/>shadow interval. Look familiar? :-)</p><p>By the way, I reverse-engineered the shadow-tuning &quot;theory&quot; from<br/>earing in tunings over the last several years, not vice versa, and<br/>I&apos;m tickled pink that you created a tuning by ear that can be<br/>described so precisely this way.</p><p>Did you continually check the tuning against the tonic and itself as<br/>you made it, try to keep a &quot;oneness&quot; to it?</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=19818 href="#19818">ðŸ”—</a>Carlo Serafini &#x3C;carlo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2008 12:23:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Cameron<br/>I am surprised, puzzled and flattered by your analysis!</p><p>Surprised because I did not have anything like you say in mind while creating this tuning.</p><p>Puzzled because all I did was going through something similar to a circle of fifths by ear<br/>without checking neither if I was close to a 3/2 interval nor checking &quot;continually the<br/>tuning against the tonic&quot;.</p><p>Flattered because you spent some time with my tuning, listened to my song and liked it!</p><p>I&apos;ll try to figure out what you said, I&apos;m impressed.<br/>Thanks again!<br/>Carlo</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cameron Bobro&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is groovy, sounds good!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But this statement about the tuning on your website:<br/>&gt; &quot;do not follow any possible theory&quot; is demonstratably not true, for<br/>&gt; the tuning is what I&apos;ve been calling a &quot;shadow tuning&quot;, and a<br/>&gt; very precise one at that.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=19819 href="#19819">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2008 3:21:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carlo Serafini&quot; &lt;carlo@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Cameron<br/>&gt; I am surprised, puzzled and flattered by your analysis!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Surprised because I did not have anything like you say in mind<br/>&gt;while creating this tuning.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t matter- I also didn&apos;t have anything in mind the many<br/>times I went hunting around for &quot;floating&quot; and &quot;other&quot; tunings that<br/>were somehow &quot;natural and organic&quot;.</p><p>In fact what I&apos;m saying would be relevant even if you got the<br/>tuning by throwing dice, because I&apos;m describing the structure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Puzzled because all I did was going through something similar to a<br/>&gt;circle of fifths by ear<br/>&gt; without checking neither if I was close to a 3/2 interval nor<br/>&gt;checking &quot;continually the<br/>&gt; tuning against the tonic&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s very impressive because there&apos;s no way I could get such<br/>a precise shadow tuning without referencing the tonic and continually<br/>checking it against itself (to hear if it &quot;floats&quot; and is &quot;somehow<br/>one&quot;.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Flattered because you spent some time with my tuning, listened to<br/>&gt;my song and liked it!</p><p>My pleasure.

And we&apos;re<br/>going to favor superparticular intervals as well as 7/9/11-flavored<br/>simple JI.</p><p>Starting at the Nh3, let&apos;s go up a step that fits our criteria, say,<br/>12/11, both superparticular and refering to the eleventh partial.</p><p>that gives us an interval of 573 cents.<br/>Moonsuite tuning: 572 cents.</p><p>up a 9/7 from Nh3, also ideal according to this theory: 857 cents.<br/>Moonsuite tuning: 857 cents.</p><p>how about, say, 7/6 up from the Nh3? 689 cents.<br/>Moonsuite tuning: 689.7 cents.</p><p>Lessee, how about 11/9 down from the Nh3? 74 cents.<br/>Moonsuite tuning: 72 cents.</p><p>At this point, if we were to transpose so that the Nh3 were to be the<br/>tonic, we have:</p><p>1/1<br/>12/11<br/>7/6<br/>9/7<br/>18/11<br/>2/1</p><p>within the tuning. The deviations from what you have are negligable,<br/>as the one &quot;big&quot; error is still only 2 cents.</p><p>Do you really think that Occam&apos;s razor is going to chalk that<br/>structure up to sheer coincidence?</p><p>How about the other intervals?</p><p>Let&apos;s see, looking at our 11-limit shadow structure which is floating<br/>off the Nh3. How about doing a nifty pun? We&apos;ll put the square root<br/>of 2, 600 cents, into this structure and at the same time use another<br/>11-limit simple superparticular interval.</p><p>11/10 up from the 9/7 gives us 600 cents,</p><p>transposed against the original tonic: 1022 cents.<br/>Moonsuite tuning: 1021.4 cents</p><p>We now have a shadow tuning of:</p><p>1/1 (at Nh3)<br/>12/11<br/>7/6<br/>9/7<br/>99/70 (600 cents and 11/10 above 9/7)<br/>18/11<br/>2/1</p><p> How about the other intervals? Well, the 763.1 cent interval in the<br/>Moonsuite tuning is within 2 cents of 14/9. That means that the<br/>original tonic has a 9/7 below it and the shadow tonic has a 9/7<br/>above it.</p><p>We have the curious 169.7 interval of Moonsuite.<br/>That&apos;s easy now that we see the shadow tuning- what&apos;s 19/11 from the<br/>Nh3, in relation to the original tonic? 168.3 cents</p><p>1/1 (at Nh3)<br/>12/11<br/>7/6<br/>9/7<br/>99/70 (600 cents, and 11/10 above 9/7)<br/>18/11<br/>19/11<br/>2/1</p><p>Coincidence? Yeah, right.</p><p>We don&apos;t even have to mention the position of the 763c/14:9 interval<br/>at 19/18 below the 857 cent interval, in the original transpostion,<br/>but you can see that the shadow tuning has an interval 19/18 above<br/>its circa 850cent interval, and the original tuning has an interval<br/>19/18 below its circa 850cent interval.</p><p>The shadow structure transposed back to the original tonic:</p><p>           1/1<br/>          74.592 cents<br/>          168.195 cents<br/>        422.000 cents<br/>          572.637 cents<br/>         688.871 cents<br/>          857.084 cents<br/>        1022.088 cents<br/>         1200.000 cents</p><p>You can fill out the rest with Just and superparticular intervals, I<br/>don&apos;t have time to figure out more red threads (the m3 is 14/13 below<br/>the Nh3 etc).</p><p>take care,</p><p>Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=19820 href="#19820">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2008 6:59:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would say something is going on here.

And we&apos;re<br/>&gt; going to favor superparticular intervals as well as 7/9/11-flavored<br/>&gt; simple JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Starting at the Nh3, let&apos;s go up a step that fits our criteria, say,<br/>&gt; 12/11, both superparticular and refering to the eleventh partial.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that gives us an interval of 573 cents.<br/>&gt; Moonsuite tuning: 572 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; up a 9/7 from Nh3, also ideal according to this theory: 857 cents.<br/>&gt; Moonsuite tuning: 857 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how about, say, 7/6 up from the Nh3? 689 cents.<br/>&gt; Moonsuite tuning: 689.7 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lessee, how about 11/9 down from the Nh3? 74 cents.<br/>&gt; Moonsuite tuning: 72 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At this point, if we were to transpose so that the Nh3 were to be the<br/>&gt; tonic, we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1<br/>&gt; 12/11<br/>&gt; 7/6<br/>&gt; 9/7<br/>&gt; 18/11<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; within the tuning. The deviations from what you have are negligable,<br/>&gt; as the one &quot;big&quot; error is still only 2 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you really think that Occam&apos;s razor is going to chalk that<br/>&gt; structure up to sheer coincidence?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about the other intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s see, looking at our 11-limit shadow structure which is floating<br/>&gt; off the Nh3. How about doing a nifty pun? We&apos;ll put the square root<br/>&gt; of 2, 600 cents, into this structure and at the same time use another<br/>&gt; 11-limit simple superparticular interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/10 up from the 9/7 gives us 600 cents,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; transposed against the original tonic: 1022 cents.<br/>&gt; Moonsuite tuning: 1021.4 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We now have a shadow tuning of:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 (at Nh3)<br/>&gt; 12/11<br/>&gt; 7/6<br/>&gt; 9/7<br/>&gt; 99/70 (600 cents and 11/10 above 9/7)<br/>&gt; 18/11<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about the other intervals? Well, the 763.1 cent interval in the<br/>&gt; Moonsuite tuning is within 2 cents of 14/9. That means that the<br/>&gt; original tonic has a 9/7 below it and the shadow tonic has a 9/7<br/>&gt; above it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have the curious 169.7 interval of Moonsuite.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s easy now that we see the shadow tuning- what&apos;s 19/11 from the<br/>&gt; Nh3, in relation to the original tonic? 168.3 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 (at Nh3)<br/>&gt; 12/11<br/>&gt; 7/6<br/>&gt; 9/7<br/>&gt; 99/70 (600 cents, and 11/10 above 9/7)<br/>&gt; 18/11<br/>&gt; 19/11<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Coincidence? Yeah, right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We don&apos;t even have to mention the position of the 763c/14:9 interval<br/>&gt; at 19/18 below the 857 cent interval, in the original transpostion,<br/>&gt; but you can see that the shadow tuning has an interval 19/18 above<br/>&gt; its circa 850cent interval, and the original tuning has an interval<br/>&gt; 19/18 below its circa 850cent interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The shadow structure transposed back to the original tonic:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1<br/>&gt; 74.592 cents<br/>&gt; 168.195 cents<br/>&gt; 422.000 cents<br/>&gt; 572.637 cents<br/>&gt; 688.871 cents<br/>&gt; 857.084 cents<br/>&gt; 1022.088 cents<br/>&gt; 1200.000 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can fill out the rest with Just and superparticular intervals, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have time to figure out more red threads (the m3 is 14/13 below<br/>&gt; the Nh3 etc).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; take care,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
