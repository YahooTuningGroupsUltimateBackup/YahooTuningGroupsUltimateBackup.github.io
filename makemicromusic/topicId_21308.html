Well, the last solo is fretless guitar with the open strings micro-tuned and played with a lap steel bullet slide. Try to imagine you had a harmonica that you could tune each hole to any note you desired on the fly, and then ran it thru a semi-unstable super-distorted ,super-compressed, formant-rich amp/device setting.....that&apos;s kind of what&apos;s going on there where the bullet slide sits in for putting a breath through the harmonic left-to-right and right-to-left........it&apos;s kind of the magic of technology and strategy over the magic of innate skills........kind of like Thanos giving Odin a good go!</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2009 6:57:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I like that!  -C.</p><p>At 04:06 PM 10/24/2009, you wrote:<br/>&gt;i&apos;ve been admiring, and talking/wanting to collaborate with Joseph<br/>&gt;Benzola for over 10 years now, and just recently we&apos;ve finally both<br/>&gt;settled in and tried to get it going before there&apos;s nothing left to do<br/>&gt;but rattle canes at each other!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;anyway, here&apos;s the first piece-----Forces in Motion----as a work in<br/>&gt;progress for anybody who might be interested:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/yzketsa">http://tinyurl.com/yzketsa</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;FWiW, Joe&apos;s been a longtime internet friend, and if there&apos;s anything<br/>&gt;here that seems remotely interesting, then please, check Joe&apos;s own<br/>&gt;solo music if you can find it anywhere, because it&apos;s great.
