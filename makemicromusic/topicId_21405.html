And hate to say it, nothing personal, but many times Carl has been involved in greatly pissing folks off...and still is.</p><p>Whatever the so called &quot;microtonal&quot; community is, it sure ISN&apos;T this list...I wouldn&apos;t recommend anyone I know to become a part of this forum, and never have; I would be greatly embarrassed to send real artists here.</p><p>   That being said, there are indeed some serious and honorable folks here, and I think they know of my respect for them. I have been studying the field of tunings for 20 years now, and find it an incredible pursuit...this is a serious path for the rest of my life. I correspond peacefully with musicians all over the world, and haven&apos;t had a flareup remotely like this, ever. Wondering why this is still going on...and if it will ever change...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>New Windows 7: Find the right PC for you.<br/><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/pc-scout/default.aspx?CBID=wl&ocid=PID24727::T:WLMTAGL:ON:WL:en-US:WWL_WIN_pcscout:112009">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/pc-scout/default.aspx?CBID=wl&ocid=PID24727::T:WLMTAGL:ON:WL:en-US:WWL_WIN_pcscout:112009</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
