I have tried to take advantage of the web&apos;s multimedia capabilities to<br/>expand well beyond the normal contents of a discography (artist, title,<br/>place and date recorded, etc.) Wherever possible, I include label graphics<br/>and sound samples. A Union Catalog feature shows which public institutions<br/>own a particular recording, and I have normalized the songs&apos; titles so that<br/>users can find all versions of any given song. Last, I have included<br/>information on the labels that published these recordings, the artists that<br/>made them, and the stores that sold them. I would welcome your comments. While preparing this site over the past decade, I have seen many times that<br/>ethnomusicologists are not always aware of the depth of knowledge in the<br/>record collecting community. Virtually all 78s have what are called &quot;matrix<br/>numbers&quot; etched into the shellac, between the last few grooves and the<br/>label. These numbers were entered into company studio logs when the songs<br/>were recorded. It&apos;s possible to tap into a worldwide network of collectors<br/>and researchers with expertise in different labels. For well-studied labels<br/>such as Gramophone, these researchers are often then able to explain where<br/>and when a given recording was mastered. Among other benefits, this lets<br/>scholars trace the arc of a musician&apos;s career, examine repertory choices,<br/>etc. Further, with more and more collectors digitizing their titles, I think<br/>there is a great opportunity for hosting vernacular 78s on the Web. Instead<br/>of satisfying ourselves with a limited diet of CD re-releases, we can now<br/>contemplate the prospects of access to the majority of the releases. (While<br/>I am no lawyer, Canadian and European releases of traditional songs on 78<br/>should all be in the public domain by now.) I will be glad to explore the possibilities in this discussion thread, as<br/>well as in person at the SEM conference, where I&apos;m currently planning to<br/>attend for a day.
