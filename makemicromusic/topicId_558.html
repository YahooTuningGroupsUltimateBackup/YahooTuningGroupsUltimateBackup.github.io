Ralph Towner &amp; J. Abercrombie is still on<br/>ECM and doing great work, but it&apos;s been a while since Manfried Echer gave us an<br/>visionary electric guitar player.

That&apos;s an interesting technique, in fact the whole idea of<br/>making things sound amiss in interesting. No matter what tonality one<br/>uses, there will be a way to get things to go odd. Haven&apos;t heard much<br/>from those ECM boys except Frisell. He&apos;s a homey, in fact we went to<br/>high school together and even had a regular Saturday free jazz session<br/>at the international house for a month. Try to see him when he comes<br/>to town. He&apos;s still doing it.</p><p>Here&apos;s a question: who is not micro who really should be? Frisell is<br/>my number one choice.</p></div><h3><a id=565 href="#565">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2001 6:45:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, post RTF Bill Connors... he did some all acoustic solo records<br/>&gt; and some ad hoc ECM group type stuff (like with vibraphonist Tom Van<br/>&gt; Der Geld for instance).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>Bills solo on Senor Mouse was a jaw dropper to me.
