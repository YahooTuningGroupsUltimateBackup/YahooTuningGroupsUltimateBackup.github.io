Adding a 3-7 cent &quot;de-tune<br/>beating&quot; off perfect JI ratios makes a chorus effect that, IMVHO, softens many<br/>sounds and makes them sound more flowing and string-section-like.  And, under 8<br/>cents error or so at least, it still keeps the same strong/solid sense of<br/>intervals as JI.</p><p>   But the fix for this issue is oh-so-easy...just de-tune all your pure-JI<br/>intervals for your songs by a few cents to &quot;add chorus&quot;.  I do this all the<br/>time...specifically for songs written in &quot;straight&quot; harmonic series, where the<br/>mechanical feel of the soaring &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; becomes unbearably high to me<br/>otherwise.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22863 href="#22863">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2010 9:51:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Marcel,<br/>&gt; Considering the extremely static electronic timbre you have used, I prefer (by far) the tempered versions, although there are better options of temperaments.

That<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;is the truly origin of the harshness.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; How could that cause harshness, as opposed to some larger error?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Buzz of difference tones are more evident.</p><p>Not sure I hear those.  The examples sounds slightly harsh<br/>to me because the timbres themselves are slightly harsh, and<br/>the 12-ET versions obscure this with roughness.  They also<br/>sound harsh on a slightly longer scale, because there is more<br/>contrast between the triads and dominant chords and the melody<br/>steps are slightly unequal.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s more accurate than a piano can be tuned, and certainly more<br/>&gt;&gt; accurate than human ensembles can play.  It&apos;s also more accurate<br/>&gt;&gt; than most samples, I&apos;d wager.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We are considering very static electronic timbres (with many strong<br/>&gt;harmonics) in this discussion.</p><p>Indeed.  And in the past with electronic timbres, exact<br/>accuracy has also annoyed some, because of phase cancelation<br/>effects.  For this reason people like Gene Smith and<br/>Paul Erlich prefer microtemperament, with error of about a<br/>cent or two.
