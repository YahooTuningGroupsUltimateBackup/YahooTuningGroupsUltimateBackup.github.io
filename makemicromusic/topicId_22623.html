I&apos;ve been working with 19 for over 20 years, and 34 for almost as long, just scratching the surface...still haven&apos;t used the 31, 36 or 22 JI much yet, so there&apos;s a lot of music to be found. And...since I like chordally based music, the JI axe, although a lovely system, may not give me as much variety since it&apos;s not really gonna be great for complex chordal stuff. Of course, if I had more $$$ to burn, which I don&apos;t, I&apos;d get all kinds of systems, just to mess with them. But, it also takes a while to get something going in a new tuning (for me, anyway)...you really gotta dig in, and see what can be done with it. It does take time and study, and I don&apos;t wanna put out music on a CD unless it meeets my standards. Anyway, good for you, best from Colorado...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>The New Busy think 9 to 5 is a cute idea.
