Marshall Bevil,<br/>&gt; &quot;Scale in Southern Appalachian Folksong:<br/>&gt; a Reexamination,&quot; College Music<br/>&gt; Symposium 26 (1986): 77-91<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;-------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This study summarizes the author&apos;s position regarding<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch-selection in American southern uplands folktune<br/>&gt; &gt; centonization. Initial attention is given to select earlier<br/>&gt; &gt; views that bore upon the emergence of the present one, and<br/>&gt; &gt; the remainder of the paper is devoted to concepts and<br/>&gt; &gt; approaches that differ, in some ways markedly, from<br/>previous<br/>&gt; &gt; ideas and methods. The ideas set forth in this paper were<br/>&gt; &gt; originally presented in the author&apos;s dissertation (University<br/>&gt; &gt; of North Texas, 1984).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The anhemitonic pentatonic scales of British Insular and<br/>&gt; &gt; Insular-American folksong usually are presented as five<br/>&gt; &gt; separate octave divisions that contain minor-third gaps<br/>&gt; &gt; caused by the absence of notes from the traditional Western<br/>&gt; &gt; heptatonic modes. This paper states and defends the<br/>&gt; &gt; propositions 1) that the anhemitonic system is better viewed<br/>&gt; &gt; as a single gamut of five overlapping segments (see table,<br/>&gt; &gt; below); 2) that those scales are not incomplete heptatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; series; and 3) that the so-called missing tones should be<br/>&gt; &gt; viewed and treated as variable auxiliary gamut members<br/>&gt; &gt; whenever they occur. Those conclusions are based partly on<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; interpretation of early Celtic theory; but more importantly,<br/>&gt; &gt; they are rooted in the behavior of preserved melodies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... more fun stuff blah blah<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow! Who knew we hillbillies was so serfisticated!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Finally, in some instances the gamut re-crystalizes at a<br/>&gt; &gt; different level when an auxiliary tone assumes the character<br/>&gt; &gt; of a regular gamut member. Here again, it seems that this<br/>&gt; &gt; modulatory process, which in the present study is termed<br/>&gt; &gt; gamut shift, should be explained in melodic, rather than<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic, terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Er, ok, so is that clear now? (it&apos;s not to me...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is sort of helpful in explaining the confusion:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.twc.it/gamut.html">http://www.twc.it/gamut.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another such word is gamut, and we will look at a sample of<br/>&gt; &gt; gamut in the datafile - see Gamut Set One (gamut1.html).<br/>This<br/>&gt; &gt; is a rather uncommon word, with hardly any of its &quot;own&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; meaning in current English. If you look up an old-fashioned<br/>&gt; &gt; dictionary, you may be told that gamut used to refer to a<br/>&gt; &gt; musical scale that had 14 notes rather than the seven that is<br/>&gt; &gt; normal in the musical traditions of Europe - double the<br/>&gt; &gt; number in an octave. As you study the examples, consider if<br/>&gt; &gt; there is any of that meaning left in the phrase.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, I&apos;ll give Monzo the final word on &apos;gamut&apos; itself as<br/>&gt; he seems to have it nailed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/gamut.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/gamut.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still not sure about &apos;variable&apos; vs &apos;fixed&apos;...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>Hi Jeff you ask how gamut is different from scale. The term<br/>gamut has always meant the some toatal of notes available to a<br/>composer. I.e Partcch had a gamut of 43 notes he did not use<br/>them all though in every composition, he would play a scale or<br/>melodic fragment etc. The gamut traditionally used is 12 notes<br/>per octave. In some circumstances a composer may decide to<br/>further limit their gamut before they have composed anything.</p><p>For instance I may decide to use a major scale as my gamut for<br/>a composition or for a lifetime of composition. But perhaps in<br/>actual practice I never ever use the fifth note ! That not is still part<br/>of my gamut though.</p><p>I think you know what it means Jeff you seem to be trying to<br/>comfuse yourself ! : )</p><p>Justin</p></div>
