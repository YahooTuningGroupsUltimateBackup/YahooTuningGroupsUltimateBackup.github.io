I know that many on the list have expressed frustration, and we&apos;ve all chased down dead ends. But in looking at the chaos and messiness of the current &apos;state&apos;, it also allows for the variegated modes of work that I&apos;ve watched, everything from simple retunings of traditional music to hands-on midi work to Csound scuplting to... all of it. Maybe it is a *good* thing that it is this hard.</p><p>Anyhow, you&apos;re music came at a good time, because I listened to it while reading an article about a new photographic exhibition opened here in town. I can&apos;t figure out if this artist has a *direct* linkage to artwork that Tom Waits has been using for a while, or if Waits is just styling it in a similar manner. But the &apos;otherness&apos; of your 88-CET piece (using &apos;otherness&apos; as a positive term) blended in a curious way with the images of Robert ParkeHarrison.
