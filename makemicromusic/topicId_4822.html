I notice that the chord second from the bottom alway includes a<br/>notes from both upper and lower tetrachords. Often though if the 3/2 is held the<br/>4/3 is not included in any of the chords!? which means not all the tones are<br/>harmonized or you need to use both the harmonic and subharmonic solutions to get<br/>them all.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: metaslendro MP3.s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; on 6/6/03 1:47 pm, Kraig Grady at kraiggrady@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Paul!<br/>&gt;   The bowed strings are two bowed psaltries.

(I was<br/>overworking at the time) I believe he said you can trade one in for one of the<br/>lower models which i moght do some day. I also talked to him about a much lower<br/>instrument that he was up to but said obviously , it can take up to three tries to<br/>work all the kinks out of a new extended design. The longer i have them the more<br/>stable the pitch seems to be but i don&apos;t change tunings all the time on them,<br/>keeping them just where they are.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Stan Hoffman &lt;stanhoffman@...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi--<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve check out Omega&apos;s website and these look pretty good--thinking of<br/>&gt; ordering one.
