Coming from<br/>the &quot;tonmeister&quot; of the post-processing set, this means a lot!  In<br/>fact, I learned a lot from *you!!*</p><p>I do have a couple of questions, though, in case you have a moment.</p><p>I was really enjoying CoolEdit for processing, since it had<br/>a &quot;preview&quot; function.  I could actually hear what the processing was<br/>like *before* I changed the file.</p><p>I did *not* find a similar function in Sound Forge.  Is there one??<br/>I&apos;m using the &quot;cheapo&quot; version... XP.  I don&apos;t find a &quot;preview&quot;<br/>feature in it.  Am I missing something??</p><p>However, I *did* notice that there were at least *some* equilization<br/>features in Sound Forge, and Cool Edit didn&apos;t have those...</p><p>Now here are the specific questions:</p><p>On my blackjack file, unlike the theatre thing, I really don&apos;t want<br/>much reverb.  In fact, I&apos;m finding I don&apos;t want *any!*  The only one<br/>that was possible was one of the reverbs in Sound Forge (not Cool<br/>Edit) that was so slight, that I finally decided it was better to<br/>leave it alone!  Everything seems like distortion of the tuning to me<br/>and in *this* piece, as contrasted with the etherial world of _The<br/>Tempest_.  I&apos;m going for tuning precision.</p><p>It was suggested, I believe by Mary, that I consider &quot;equalization...&quot;</p><p>Frankly, I wouldn&apos;t know where to begin!</p><p>What am I supposed to &quot;equalize&quot; out?  My file goes &quot;all over the<br/>place&quot; in terms of frequency.</p><p>I have *no* idea what to do about that, if anything.</p><p>Any comments on equalization would be most welcome if you have time.</p><p>Also, it doesn&apos;t seem that Sound Forge XP is the optimum program for<br/>equalization, if I am to get &quot;into&quot; it.</p><p>Any suggestions??</p><p>Thanks so much!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/30/2001 6:28:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joe</p><p>This is glorious music, and  I am really enjoying listening to it.<br/>Were their any vocals with it.  It seems to just be begging for a<br/>nice full voiced tenor.</p><p>And the processing is light years beyond what I&apos;ve heard of your<br/>other work.  Good for you taking the time to learn new tricks.</p><p>I second Jackies plan of just digging in, testing out lots EQ<br/>combinations and burning them to CD, then listen everywhere.</p><p>Don&apos;t be afraid to play.

Well, one reason the<br/>processing is better in these pieces is that before I used *none!*</p><p>:)</p><p>Actually, for pieces that emphasize, specifically, *tuning,* I am a<br/>little hesitant to do too much processing... or I find I don&apos;t hear<br/>the *precision.*  We&apos;ll see though, and, as you say, the proof is in<br/>the *listening...*</p><p>Yes, there were several vocal pieces.  I am hoping to get a recording<br/>at a performance this weekend and put the pieces up with the vocals.</p><p>The &quot;Song of the Goddesses&quot; is sung, as is &quot;Stephano&apos;s Song.&quot;</p><p>Two others are also songs, &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot; and &quot;Where the Bee<br/>Sucks&quot; but <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> won&apos;t let me put them up!  They think they<br/>are &quot;cover songs&quot; so, apparently, some band has used them.</p><p>I tried to explain that the words were by *Shakespeare* so that might<br/>be why more than *one* person would have a piece by these titles.</p><p>It&apos;s a little hard getting through to them...  :)</p><p>I may just put the pieces up again with &quot;modified&quot; titles, if I don&apos;t<br/>hear from them.  They seem to just be looking at the titles.</p><p>Of course, the music is *entirely* original, except for the 16th<br/>century stuff which is, quite clearly, in the public domain!</p><p>OH... as a funny P.S.:</p><p>Two minutes ago I was actually watching the play from out my window!<br/>Isn&apos;t that a hoot!  I&apos;m on the 35th floor and I use binoculars! It&apos;s<br/>right across the street in a courtyard and, partially, from a<br/>building roof...  Full lighting, sound, etc., though.</p><p>It&apos;s funny to watch it from up here...</p><p>Thanks for the commentary!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
