Has a<br/>modulation/feedback/cross-mod matrix (al&aacute; Sytrus), great sounds are coming<br/>out of it for me. See the post above for my working list of TODOs, but if<br/>you want to have a little fun tonight, have at it. It&apos;s really addictive.</p><p>I meantion it here, too, b/c in Csound you have (of course) infinite tuning<br/>and tuning tables flexibility.  I have a little Python command line utility<br/>to change .scl files into a Csound f-table format for use by csound&apos;s MIDI<br/>tuning-table &apos;cpstmid&apos; opcode. Of course, I think Scala also does this type<br/>of thing already....so, all you&apos;d have to do is plug that table into the<br/>&lt;CsScore&gt; section of the .csd file and change the reference to &apos;cpsmidi&apos; in<br/>the &lt;CsInstruments&gt; section code to &apos;cpstmid&apos; plus the table number (make<br/>sure it isn&apos;t used already in the score). This page explains the opcode:<br/><a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cpstmid.html">http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/cpstmid.html</a> in the meantime, but future<br/>versions of this synth will perhaps have an array of preloaded fun scales an<br/>a GUI switch for immediately calling them.</p><p>AKJ</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
