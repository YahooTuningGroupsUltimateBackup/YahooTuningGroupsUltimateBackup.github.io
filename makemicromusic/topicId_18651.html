Not only Yamaha, but<br/>Roland and other brands.

These have, in addition to the features<br/>of conventional synths, a set of twelve buttons that shift the tuning of<br/>a single note in the octave. By default, the value is 50 cents, but the<br/>amount can be adjusted in many keyboards; typically by a value of -64 to<br/>+63 in increments of one cent. (When a switch is off, the pitch is tuned<br/>to its normal 12-TET value.) There should be several programmable bank<br/>buttons for different tunings, typically three.</p><p>But with many keyboards, you can send a tuning dump from your computer<br/>using software such as Scala, or a device. ~D.</p></div><h3><a id=18657 href="#18657">ðŸ”—</a>julian4946 &#x3C;julian.silverman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2008 8:46:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Where are you?
