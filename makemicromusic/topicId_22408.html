Which isn&apos;t bad far as distance from the root, but compare that interval to an octave above the root (the same issue I mentioned on the tuning thread) of (2/1) / (45/32).<br/>  Now you see a interval of 1.422222 between 45/32 and an octave over the root tone...IE a 27/19-ish interval from the root tone on the next octave.  And IMVHO 27/19 is not exactly the sweetest sounding interval.  Even making F# something like 1.414 (so the interval in between that tone and the octave becomes about 1.414 as well since est. 1.414 = the square root of 2) I believe should be close enough to correct the issue.</p><p>,_._,___</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>doctor@...</h3><span>5/11/2010 11:19:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh, I tried transposing (in MIDI) to Cm with the same set of scale notes<br/>and then transposed the audio file back to Am.
