BTW, I know one of the members of this august list has been playing around with a wind instrument controller and a sax VST called SaxLab. Maybe we&apos;ll hear some of those results some day as well.</p><p>Looking forward, listening forwarder...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=10001 href="#10001">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2005 3:28:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>Sorry it took me a couple of days to write back, but thanks for sharing your latest. I think, in this instance, I would be *especially* interested in hearing a performance, so that there was more sonic difference between the sax and it&apos;s interaction with the electronics. I&apos;ll look forward to that particular &apos;document&apos;.</p><p>But what I really want to say (and, I guess, thank you for) is your continued use of such a wide palette of sound events in a musical construction. So often lip service it paid to the concept of expanded horizons when it comes to the actual material we use to create a new piece. To have someone not only expanding the tuning horizon, but to also be incorporating a very democratic use of sounds, is not only forward-thinking but very satisfying on an artistic level.</p><p>Oh, and yeah, what he said: it&apos;s fun, too!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
