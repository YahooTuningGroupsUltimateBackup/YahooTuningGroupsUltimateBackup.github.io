I would like to add to that comment by saying that I&apos;ve recorded 5 CD&apos;s with 19 tone tunes on them, as well as produced the old tuning@eartha <a href="http://mills.edu">mills.edu</a>,&lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@eartha">mailto:tuning@eartha</a>%<a href="http://20mills.edu">20mills.edu</a>,&gt; which had another 4 19 toners that I played on, as well. And, in the span of those CD&apos;s, I&apos;ve composed/played with 19 in the styles of rock, blues, jazz, classical, space music, jazz fusion, reggae, ska, country, Western swing, and several tunes that are rather hard to classify. And, I have a number of more compositions waiting in the wings as well, which will appear on upcoming CD&apos;s (my 6th is almost done, and there&apos;s 3 in 19 on there too).<br/>   Gene also mentioned that I might want to check out &quot;negri,&quot; &quot;Hanson,&quot; and &quot;magic&quot; tunings as well. But, you know, I&apos;m a might busy feller overall, and I find that, especially as I am aging (rather rapidly), I just do not have time to investigate every opportunity that presents itself, unfortunately. So, I have not followed the development of those systems, and don&apos;t really know what makes them tick. But, that&apos;s ok, I believe, because I am always studying music, whether practicing, reading, composing, recording, teaching, or just simply thinking about it...it&apos;s really all I do (besides take care of my kid, cats, dog, weasel, and spiders). In fact, I find myself rather obsessed with music in many ways, of which tuning is only one part, but a very important part. So, even if I don&apos;t keep up with all the tuning list developments, I feel I&apos;m going to do ok in my study of tunings. For one, I am constantly listening to music from all over the world, and learning about how different cultures tune. And, for example, I have a rather large stack of papers that Erv Wilson sent me a few years ago, which could probably keep me busy late at night until a few lives from now.<br/>   And, a comment on the tunings that Gene mentioned...as a full time teacher, I constantly look for ways to make complex subjects seem as simple as possible, and I believe I do ok with that effort; at least my students seem to think so. And, the tunings that Gene are talking about (and there&apos;s a few others as well, I believe) seem to be a dialogue between just a few people on the forum; I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve ever seen them mentioned anywhere else, in any book or paper that I&apos;ve yet read. Seems like you have to be a member of a pretty small group of tuning enthusiasts to keep up, or even understand what is being talked about. And, believe me, nothing wrong with that, I don&apos;t begrudge anybody their way of enjoying music/tunings...it just, (to my way of seeing it), makes the whole rather difficult subject of tuning theory even more difficult, and I want to go in the opposite direction. So I will...<br/>    Nice discussions, see you all later...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2006 12:35:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>&gt;   Gene also mentioned that I might want to check out &quot;negri,&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;Hanson,&quot; and &quot;magic&quot; tunings as well.

I can&apos;t think of any reason NOT to try these<br/>scales, though.  Except that it might not be clear what they are!</p><p>&gt;Seems like you have to be a member of a pretty small group<br/>&gt;of tuning enthusiasts to keep up, or even understand what is being<br/>&gt;talked about.

On the other hand, this stuff is pretty new,<br/>and if it takes a few years to make it into a more digestible form it<br/>won&apos;t be too bad.  In the meantime, don&apos;t let the terminology scare<br/>you, it&apos;s very simple:</p><p>&quot;Hanson&quot; was named after Larry Hanson.  It&apos;s playable in both 19<br/>and 34.  Since you have a guitar from him, you might want to check<br/>these scales out.  The 7-tone version is about:<br/>0 - 249 - 317 - 566 - 634 - 883 - 951 - 1200 cents.  The step pattern<br/>is [L s L s L s L] where L is 4 steps in 19 or 7 steps in 34, and s<br/>is 1/19 or 2/34.  This scale is based on a chain of minor 3rds<br/>instead of a chain of 5ths.  It&apos;s loaded with chords.</p><p>Magic works well as a 7- or 10-tone scale in 19.  The step patterns<br/>are [s L s L s L s] and [s M s s M s s s M s], where s = 1/19, M = 4/19,<br/>and L = 5/19.</p><p>Play around with these, and I&apos;ll bet you be glad you did.  I&apos;ll leave<br/>Negri for another time (it isn&apos;t great in 19 or 34).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;microstick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2011 4:01:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs...nice to see your testimonial for 19.

My it is favorite from Fretless. Besides<br/>loving the composition - having played my fretless guitar for a while<br/>I find the technique involved for playing those chords is truly<br/>impressive.</p><p>On Mon, Feb 28, 2011 at 7:13 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just one to throw out, although it&apos;s not 19-TET related, that your<br/>&gt; piece &quot;Beautiful Springtime&quot; I think it was called, off of that album<br/>&gt; is one of my favorite compositions of all time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p></div>
