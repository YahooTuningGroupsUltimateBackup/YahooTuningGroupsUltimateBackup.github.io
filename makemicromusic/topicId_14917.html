Each instance of InTun can have its own scale. With this, I can compose directly in a notation program or sequencer, and have pretty good real time tuning.</p><p>With this set up, composing for an arrangement like Jacob Barton&apos;s 17tet divided between two pianos would be a snap. Assign one piano to midi channels 1-16, output to one virtual port, and assign the second piano to channels 17-32 with output to a second virtual port, then assign each port to one instance of InTun.
