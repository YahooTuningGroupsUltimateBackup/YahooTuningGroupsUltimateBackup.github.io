I prefer to work with my acoustic instruments that do where i don&apos;t have to spend time thinking about things  i would rather not that just make doing music more difficult. Anyone who has used a Bosanquet keyboard based layout finds how greatly the layout aids in ones thinking as opposed to the other way around where the same interval will always look the same. You brain grabs on it it and makes the free pure spontaneous adventure through the notes better than even what you find on a 12 tone keyboard.</p><p>threesixesinarow wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &gt; &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;   &gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; There are no microtonal keyboard controllers currently in mass<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; production.
