I&apos;d much<br/>rather at least try to tackle each scenario individually -- what&apos;s<br/>trying to be accomplished artistically, creatively; what&apos;s the<br/>broader context; what&apos;s it sound like, does the composer-sound<br/>organizer kick butt or suck eggs?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Swafford&apos;s Ives biography he posits that Carter could never come<br/>to terms with Ives use of quotations. It&apos;s obviously all too possible<br/>&gt; that something can kick butt and suck eggs simply depending upon<br/>where you stand. Time will prove Carter wrong though in my opinion.</p><p>Hi Dan!</p><p>Surely your points are well taken.  I guess I was mostly saying that<br/>*personally* I don&apos;t care for quotation, and it seems Kraig doesn&apos;t<br/>as well.</p><p>But, I wasn&apos;t thinking *at all* of Ives.  Certainly he&apos;s<br/>a &quot;different&quot; case and I would also strongly disagree with Carter in<br/>this matter...</p><p>George Crumb and George Rochberg are two *other* composers who have<br/>also used quotation to extremely creative effect....</p><p>________ _______ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
