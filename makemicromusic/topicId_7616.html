It&apos;s the most common<br/>thing that usres say about FTS indeed.</p><p>There&apos;s still lots more to be done but I do think you&apos;ll<br/>see quite an improvement with FTS 3.0. Those who have<br/>tried it say it is easier to use.</p><p>However, the help is still going to be sparse with the next<br/>release. The gui will be easier to use and it will be clearer<br/>how everythign works, but still I expect questions about<br/>details about how to use various features.</p><p>After the release I will be spending a few weeks<br/>or perhaps more likely months working on teh help but<br/>i want to get the interface all sorted out first<br/>as the help is bound to refer extensively to the<br/>interface, so it is less work to do the interface<br/>first and the help last.</p><p>I am learning. Also do get lots of help and advice<br/>from other programmers and from keen composers who use<br/>FTS, and their help has made a tremendous difference<br/>- probably more so in this release than in the<br/>earlier ones as I&apos;ve had much more feedback<br/>about it this time around. But even so nearly<br/>everyone who uses FTS wants me to improve the layout. It just<br/>isn&apos;t such an easy thing to do as it seems,<br/>to design a good gui, and part of the problem<br/>is that there are few models to do the exact<br/>things I&apos;m doing in FTS, some similar programs<br/>in some ways but not close enough to really<br/>use as a model. Perhaps I&apos;ve learnt most from<br/>seeing how things are done in SCALA, but it isn&apos;t<br/>possible to copy how it does things exactly of course<br/>as the objectives are different -<br/>and then learnt many things here and there<br/>from other programs.</p><p>It is easy to find flaws in a gui but it is<br/>sometimes hard to see how<br/>to make something better. I now see many flaws<br/>in the FTS gui, nevertheless it is the best I<br/>can do and certainly 3.0 is an improvement over<br/>2.4.</p><p>Then with the help reworked - I&apos;ve got better<br/>at explaining things in the help I htink,<br/>gradually learnt better ways of explaining<br/>things from responding to numerous support<br/>questions abotu how to use FTS. Much of the<br/>better parts of the help I think mainly<br/>consists of reworking of my replies to<br/>various support questions about how<br/>to do this or that in FTS.</p><p>So anyway, I&apos;ll be interested to know<br/>what you make of 3.0 when it is ready.<br/>Then after taht when I have improved<br/>the help which I&apos;m doign as a separate<br/>phase I hope that will help too.</p><p>There are some areas in FTS that I know<br/>aren&apos;t explained well yet because<br/>no-one seems to use them. The tonic<br/>shifts are an example. Hopefully<br/>that will get sorted out in time.<br/>Those things are easy to use but<br/>the explanatino of how they work<br/>seems to put off users rather than<br/>help them to be able to use the feature<br/>and I don&apos;t know what the problem<br/>is yet. Can be as simple a matter as using<br/>an unexpected word to describe something,<br/>so it conveys a different meaning from<br/>the one you intended to convey.</p><p>Other sections however seem to be<br/>explained and presented okay now as I don&apos;t get<br/>asked questions that i was asked<br/>about before and it is clear that<br/>users are using them. So I htink<br/>it is a matter of time.</p><p>Really for the last six months or<br/>so though I&apos;ve added various new things<br/>indeed, I have focussed rather more on<br/>improving the presentation than on<br/>adding new features.</p><p>So we will see if that has helped.<br/>I&apos;ll be doing more of that<br/>after the release too.<br/>Thanks for your concern.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7617 href="#7617">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
