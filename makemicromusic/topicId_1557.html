Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2002 6:33:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;d like, however belatedly, to wish<br/>everyone a Happy New Year and to share a small musical gift which<br/>Jacky Ligon has helped to make possible.</p><p>Also, thanks to Dan and Jacky and others for the great history lesson;<br/>having seen my recent cassette so generously, skillfully, and artfully<br/>translated by Jacky into .mp3 files, I feel an especially fortunate<br/>member of the circle of &quot;Home Tapers.&quot;</p><p>From a bit of offline dialogue with you, Jacky, I got the idea of a<br/>sonority with a ratio of 7:10:13, with a reasonably close<br/>approximation in a beautiful tuning, 29-tET.</p><p>Here&apos;s a General MIDI file of a progression I came up with featuring<br/>this sonority, and also the 29-tET diesis step of a fifthtone, or<br/>about 41 cents. Here an asterisk (*) shows a note raised by a diesis:</p><p>                F#4   G4<br/>                C#*4  D4<br/>                G*3   G3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/en29_001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/en29_001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>The lower pair of voices, as it happens, move in contrary motion by<br/>diesis steps, while the upper voice ascends by the usual diatonic<br/>semitone of 2/5-tone, about 83 cents -- a bit more compact than in<br/>Pythagorean tuning (about 90 cents), but not too far from it.</p><p>Maybe this could be taken as a curious variation on a progression<br/>which I suspect was very striking 800 years or so ago when the great<br/>composer Perotin wrote it, as it still is now, with the upper voices<br/>resolving obliquely above the stationary lowest voice:</p><p>              F#4  G4<br/>              C#4  D4<br/>              G3</p><p>What the traditional version and the new share in common is that<br/>ascending semitone F#4-G4 -- and also the contrast between the tension<br/>and complexity of the first sonority and the pure concord of the<br/>resolving 2:3:4, actually very gently tempered in 29-tET (with the<br/>fifth at about 703.45 cents, or ~1.49 cents wide).</p><p>While it was my discussion with Jacky that set the stage for this<br/>7:10:13-type sonority, a vital part of the process was getting to a<br/>keyboard and trying it out.</p><p>From there, it was easy to write down the progression, and then to<br/>type it in the ASCII text format for a Scala EXAMPLE file that Manuel<br/>Op de Coul&apos;s fine freeware program uses to generate the MIDI file that<br/>I&apos;ve uploaded to my ISP.</p><p>Thank you all for helping to make possible an experiment curiously<br/>mixing tradition, innovation, and the joy of &quot;actually trying it out.&quot;</p><p>Also, my special greetings to Jon and Mary, who have helped make this<br/>such a special place.</p><p>With love and peace for 2002,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
