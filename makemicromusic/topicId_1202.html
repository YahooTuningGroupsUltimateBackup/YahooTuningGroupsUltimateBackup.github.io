What kind of harmony is this?</p><p>Hello, there, Bill, and let&apos;s see if at least I can identify the steps,<br/>intervals, and rough ratio approximations.</p><p>54-63-67</p><p>with an 11-note octave would be a sonority, if I&apos;m correct, of</p><p>0-9-13</p><p>or, in 11-tET, roughly</p><p>0-982-1418 cents</p><p>The interval between the lower notes is not too far from 4:7 (about 969<br/>cents); between the two outer notes, fairly close to 15:34, I guess, an<br/>octave plus a &quot;tone&quot; about midway between 8:9 (204 cents) and 7:8 (about<br/>231 cents).</p><p>The interval between the two upper voices is a 4-step or &quot;ditone&quot; of about<br/>436 cents, an excellent approximation of a just 7:9.</p><p>In 22-tET terms, also, this would be the best approximation of 4:7:9,<br/>which has been mentioned in this thread by Paul.</p><p>What&apos;s apparently happening here is that the lower two voices with the<br/>near-4:7 are progressing by oblique motion (one voice moving, one<br/>stationary):</p><p>54-63-67 (0-9-13 = 0-982-1418)  roughly  4:7:9<br/>56-63    (0-7    = 0-764)       near-just 9:14</p><p>This new sonority, a 7-step at around 764 cents, is an excellent<br/>approximation of 9:14 (about 765 cents). In conventional terms, this might<br/>be called a &quot;septimal minor sixth,&quot; just its octave complement the 4-step<br/>might be called a &quot;septimal major third&quot; at very close to 7:9</p><p>In conventional terms, this might be called a &quot;minor seventh resolving to<br/>a minor sixth,&quot; with the lower voice ascending by the 11-tET/22-tET<br/>&quot;tone&quot; of around 15:17.</p><p>If the lower voice descended from the 9-step to the 7-step interval, then<br/>this might be analogous to a kind of &quot;7-6 suspension&quot; where a seventh<br/>resolves to a sixth, one of the most characteristic features of<br/>Renaissance and some later European styles.</p><p>With a 4:7:9, although here I may be going a bit outside of the medieval<br/>and Renaissance European theory with which I&apos;m most familiar, I&apos;d say that<br/>the lowest note is arguably the &quot;root,&quot; both because it&apos;s an even power of<br/>two, making it an octave of the &quot;1&quot; or &quot;fundamental&quot; in this kind of<br/>approach; and because under at least some theories, a 4:7 above the lowest<br/>note has some &quot;anchoring&quot; power to make that note felt as the firm<br/>&quot;basis&quot; of the sonority.</p><p>If we did 0-13-18-26 steps or 0-709-982-1418 cents in 22-tET, the<br/>approximation of 4:6:7:9, then the &quot;anchoring&quot; power of the 2:3 above the<br/>lowest note would reinforce this &quot;rootedness.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What kind of harmony is this&quot; is a good question, and when I heard _Dabo<br/>Girl_ on your CD, I didn&apos;t say to myself, &quot;That&apos;s some 11-tET takeoff on a<br/>16th-century suspension with a voice resolving upward rather than<br/>downward.&quot;</p><p>It may be unique kind of harmony, because the &quot;harmonic geometry&quot; of<br/>11-tET is different, and trying to describe it in familiar Renaissance or<br/>other terms is maybe a bit like trying to project a 3-D object on a 2-D<br/>surface -- we may get an idea of some interesting aspect, but distort<br/>others, sometimes not recognizing the distortion.</p><p>Anyway, I hope that this is the start of an answer, and that I haven&apos;t<br/>committed any obvious errors in trying to respond offhand.</p><p>With peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
