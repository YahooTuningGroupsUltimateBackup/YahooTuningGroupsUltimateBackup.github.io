It&apos;s a bit rough and ready, but sounding good.  Comments<br/>are welcome, but be gentle.</p><p>Obviously, the copyright on the song is owned by AOL/Time-Warner.<br/>So, if anybody from AOL/Time-Warner thinks they&apos;re being harmed in<br/>any way from my version being available I&apos;ll take it down.  I think<br/>I&apos;m okay by the Terms and Conditions because it isn&apos;t publicly<br/>available, the Files area being members only.  So there you go.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
