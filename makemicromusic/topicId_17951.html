The objectivity of<br/>12-tone music had given way to a perhaps even greater objectivity of<br/>process-oriented logic. But over years of experimentation, I found that<br/>nature didn&apos;t speak through me. The natural processes I came up with<br/>were more tedious than compelling.....Whatever joy I took in composing<br/>had to do with the personal and subjective: the quirky melodic<br/>decoration, the unexpected key change, the rhythmic figure that seems<br/>bizarre at first, but finally becomes familiar through repetition.&quot;</p><p>Yea, brother.</p><p>&quot;....I was hungry for art to reintegrate the human element, the personal<br/>element, the whimsical and idiosyncratic. Nature is a paradigm that an<br/>artist can hardly help worshipping, but ultimately I felt that we also<br/>need an art that is about being human, with all the attendant neuroses,<br/>embarrassments, longings, and humor. I love(d) abstract expressionism,<br/>but I wanted to know how, once we had made our way through it, we were<br/>going to come back to dealing with the uncomfortableness and absurdity<br/>of human consciousness.&quot;</p><p>Verily.</p><p>&quot;....new music was now about sound waves and not<br/>personality.....Distinctions like natural versus psychological, literal<br/>versus metaphorical, are not trivial: they are the axes in reference to<br/>which we position ourselves to stake out aesthetic territory and explore<br/>what music means and what it can accomplish, because, thankfully, we&apos;ll<br/>never know everything music can achieve. But just as it was<br/>fundamentally stupid to think, as so many did in the &apos;50s, &quot;OK, the age<br/>of tonal music is over, from now on music can only be atonal and anyone<br/>who lapses back into tonality is not with the times,&quot; it would be<br/>equally stupid to think that &quot;history now demands&quot; that music now be<br/>always literal in its depiction, or that psychological metaphor must be<br/>abandoned as old-fashioned. George Rochberg was right: the problem with<br/>12-tone music was not what it added to our vocabulary but what it tried<br/>to subtract, that it attempted to outlaw anything associated with the<br/>past. The history of creative music never goes backward, but neither<br/>does it ever decide that one side of a creative duality is now useless,<br/>and only the opposite side can be gainfully explored.&quot;</p><p>Yea, verily, halleleujah and amen!</p><p>The music that holds the greatest interest for most humans, that always<br/>has throughout all history, is that which parallels human discourse:<br/>mono- and dialogues, turns of phrase, juxtaposition, argument, poetry<br/>and vulgarity, metaphor and simile, point and counterpoint.</p><p>&quot;New&quot; explorations in the arts will always attract immediate notice --<br/>novelty has that effect on intelligent humans. But after the novelty<br/>wears off, and people find little resembling &quot;humanity&quot; in such art --<br/>nothing intimate and personal they can relate to -- they will fall away<br/>from it. Such art endures only by way of its temporary novety. (At this<br/>point, the artist becomes an ideologue who bitterly disparages the<br/>public&apos;s lack of &quot;understanding&quot;.)</p><p>JS Bach is the composer whose music makes me think most of Nature -- not<br/>by tedious processes, or blunt imitation, but by inducing a state of<br/>consciousness in me similar to that  which Nature Herself induces. Yet<br/>his music is also quite human in its joy and contemplation and devotion.<br/>This is the main reason his works, and the works of so many other<br/>composers, continue to attract admirers.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=17952 href="#17952">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Bryan &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2007 12:35:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;The history of creative music never goes backward, but neither<br/>does it ever decide that one side of a creative duality is now useless,<br/>and only the opposite side can be gainfully explored.&quot;</p><p>Yet this is exactly what you do when you imply that all process-oriented,<br/>&quot;natural&quot; music is by definition tedious, shallow, and short-lived.

Why??</p><p>Diatribe? I think I&apos;m flattered, Chris. Actually, my secondary<br/>contention was that artistic *novelty* as such is short-lived (not more<br/>than a few decades) and very often contrived. Witness the 12-tone<br/>school, its intended goals and the actual results obtained. I might<br/>mention here that &quot;tedious&quot; and &quot;shallow&quot; is found anywhere you care to<br/>look. &quot;Valid&quot; borders dangerously on subjective opinion, for both of us.</p><p>My primary contention was agreement with Kyle regarding the very human<br/>need for human music, for the involvement of humans in music. For me<br/>specifically, this opposes &quot;process&quot; music, &quot;natural&quot; music, or &quot;chance<br/>music&quot;, or anything that removes the composer from the primary<br/>decision-making act of creation.</p><p>I&apos;m not really interested in minimalism, or sound-sculpture, or waves of<br/>pure, overtone-laden tone anymore. Not because I doubt its &quot;validity&quot; as<br/>far as the artists and their efforts are concerned (each to his/her own<br/>path), but because of the more than five years I spent composing works<br/>in that style. It was interesting and rewarding, but also showed me<br/>where I really needed to be. So, give me a freaking break if I take a<br/>good-natured poke at something I myself composed -- and try not to be so<br/>thin-skinned!</p><p>  &gt; Nevermind that none of this relates to MMM.</p><p>It might, if the musical novelty in question involves banging on<br/>eco-friendly &quot;microtonal&quot; flower pots, or humming pitches from the<br/>overtone series for an hour. But that&apos;s just an opinion (I had my own<br/>set of &quot;tuned&quot; wok pan covers, really nice sounding).</p><p>&gt; Not trying to flame, but I was slightly irritated. Still, no offense<br/>taken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris Bryan</p><p>I&apos;m glad you aren&apos;t offended Chris, because it wasn&apos;t my intention. I<br/>may have some pointed opinions about what constitutes music, but I have<br/>no absolute dislike of the type of music here spoken of (how could I --<br/>please re-read the above paragraph), and some of it is intriguing -- but<br/>to me, only as novelty. Perhaps what we&apos;re really discussing here is a<br/>new fork in the artistic road: music as traditionally perceived and<br/>composed on the one hand, and something we can call &quot;sound sculpture&quot; or<br/>&quot;sonic art&quot; or what have you on the other.</p></div><h3><a id=17954 href="#17954">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Bryan &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2007 2:55:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  I&apos;m glad you aren&apos;t offended Chris, because it wasn&apos;t my intention.

But in the end, the perceived &apos;humanity&apos; or<br/>lack of it is only an illusion:  whether a melody or soundscape, *I*<br/>am still the one who creates something and then says &quot;Yes! I&apos;d like to<br/>share that with others!&quot;  THAT&apos;s the real humanity of music, whether<br/>it&apos;s Beethoven or Niblock :)</p><p>-Chris</p></div>
