Something about just sitting around listening to<br/>&gt; bells ring... I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m having sort of a new thought here.<br/>&gt; Listening to bells ring seems to be pleasant enough that when I hear bells I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t sit around and analyze the musical content.  They&apos;re just bells.<br/>&gt; So... With all great effort trying to conform to so many different musical<br/>&gt; principles, (with something like bells,) on one end of the spectrum, and<br/>&gt; then just bing bong clang bells in the air on the other side of the<br/>&gt; spectrum... Starting to wonder what can be found in between.  Recognizable<br/>&gt; music drifting in and out of strange sounds, eventually making the strange<br/>&gt; sounds recognizable.</p><p>That&apos;s nice. Yes, and I think the scale has a lot to do with making the Rhodes<br/>piano sound like bells. Dan posted the scale to the main list and when I tried<br/>it out, it sounded like bells; I think that was with just a harp voice or<br/>something. Even with the ocarina timbre, it suggests bells.</p><p>With this one I did a bit of work on the timbre to try and bring<br/>that aspect out a bit more, that&apos;s all. Why this scale should have such<br/>an effect is anyone&apos;s guess?? I think Dan had other things in mind<br/>- I&apos;d be interested to hear more about the origins of the scale.</p><p>It&apos;s 1/1 8/7 9/7 7/5 32/21 12/7 27/14 2/1</p><p>- all the notes are in seven limit ratios<br/>to the 1/1.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 11:03:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/26/02 9:30 AM, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I really need to do some 7th limit stuff and higher.

For<br/>that matter, the closest I&apos;ve come to writing in 7th limit extensively is<br/>writing mostly 5th limit things in 7th limit convergences with only subtle<br/>traces of 7-ness.
