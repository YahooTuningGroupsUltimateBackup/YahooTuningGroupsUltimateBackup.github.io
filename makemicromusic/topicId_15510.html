I have both GPO and JABB, and it seems<br/>that the Kontakt Player 2 is a totally useless appendage to JABB/GPO.</p><p>If you find that you can use the GPO orchestral instruments somehow<br/>(easily?) with scripting in the Kontakt 2 player, I&apos;m sure people would be<br/>interested to hear it. My impression, however, is that it doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2006 11:58:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I think the bundled NI Kontakt Player won&apos;t actually play the GPO samples.<br/>&gt;You need to use the also bundled special GPO sample player, which is also<br/>&gt;a version of Kontakt, for the GPO samples.</p><p>Hmmm, that is what I meant: the GPO sample set is bundled inside the Kontakt Player, which either now or in the next update has the scripting built in. If you look at the NI page on the Player, you can see the Strad packaged that way.</p><p>&gt;If you find that you can use the GPO orchestral instruments somehow (easily?) with scripting in the Kontakt 2 player, I&apos;m sure people would be interested to hear it.

My impression of JABB packaging is that JABB is packaged to work<br/>inside of Player X, which it comes with. That works as a standalone, and<br/>also inside of VST hosts, or inside &quot;Garritan Studio&quot; (a specialized free<br/>VST host that can host multiple instances of GPO and/or JABB).</p><p>And the JABB package also contains a second Player Y, called Kontakt<br/>Player, apparently version 2, which seems to be a totally separate thing as<br/>far as I can see, having nothing at all to do with the JABB &quot;player&quot; host<br/>thingy.</p><p>When you get the package, I&apos;m sure you can correct me if I&apos;m wrong.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2006 12:37:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;When you get the package, I&apos;m sure you can correct me if I&apos;m wrong.</p><p>We shall see.</p><p>Jon</p></div>
