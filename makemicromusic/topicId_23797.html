This 60-minute event is the result of a collaboration between Vox Novus&apos;s 60x60 and the Chicago-based Patrick Liddell and UnTwelve.  The miniatures presented will all be part of what we call the UnTwelve Mix--short works with a focus of the novel beauty of tuning which escapes the rigid boundaries of 12-tone equal temperament, and the use of microtones.</p><p>60x60 UnTwelve Mix Video Installation<br/>Monday, December 6 through Saturday, December 18 List Arts Center Gallery Hamilton College<br/>198 College Hill Road<br/>Clinton, NY 13323</p><p>Composers in the 60x60 2010 UnTwelve Mix will include:<br/>Elise Cumberland, Tommy Scheurich, Mike Leghorn, Carlo Serafini, Ioannis Kalantzis, Agnes Szelag, Dennis Bathory-Kitsz, Kevin Kissinger, Alexander Baker, Brent Wilcox, Zachary Young, Mark Zaki, Christopher Bailey, Scott Peterson, Ethan Schwartz, Andrian Pertout, Ozan Yarman, Mark Eden, Phil Edelstein, Anthony St.Pierre, Jose Ivan Sanchez, Anthony Hood, Kraig Grady,Penko Stoitschev, Monroe Golden, Robert Fanelli, Samuel Pellman, Cameron Bobro, Bob Siebert, Chuckk Hubbard, Rob Voisey, Joseph Pehrson, Warren Burt, Prent Rodgers, Victor Valentim, Robert Lepre, Andy Hasenpflug, Thomas Ciufo, Les Scott, Daniel Sedgwick, Momilani Ramstrum, Mark Ballora, Randall West, Joel Hickman, Chris Vaisvil, Ann Cantelow, Patrick Liddell, Christopher Keyes, Thomas Dempster, Michael Gaiuranos, Tova Kardonne, Sean Archibald, Monty Adkins, Enrico Francioni, George Secor, Aaron Krister Johnson, Gilberto Rosa, Mike McFerron, Douglas Geers, and Danny Wier</p><p>A copy of the program notes can be found here:<br/><a href="http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/2010_UnTwelve_Mix.htm">http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/2010_UnTwelve_Mix.htm</a></p><p>And here is the bio of Patrick Liddell the video artist:<br/>Patrick Liddell is a composer and video artist living in Chicago. His music/video is a postmodern blend of &apos;art&apos; and &apos;popular&apos; styles, with strong hints of electronic, ethnic, video game, experimental, and film music. His YouTube project &quot;Video Room 1000&quot; has received over one million views and has been featured on a host of viral websites.  Patrick recently completed the video for Vox Novus&apos;s &quot;360 degrees of 60x60&quot;, a six-hour video installation featuring the works of 360 different composers; each hour of the video revisits the same source material but manipulated to uniquely accompany the music playing. He regularly performs live and improvised video with many groups in the Chicago area, as well as his own video/music/art under the moniker [ontologist].<br/>Please discover more at: <a href="http://www.ontologist.us">www.ontologist.us</a></p></div>
