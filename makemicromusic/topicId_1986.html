What could be worse than some dickwad starting a list about making microtonal music and then the yozo doesn&apos;t even make any? How come people didn&apos;t stir up a fuss.</p><p>Well, be that as it may, I just posted an extremely short piece of ... I hesitate to call it &apos;music&apos; as it would demean the art. If nothing else, it shows that I now have a setup, that I know how to make Scala speak to the TX81Z, TX802, and DX11 (thanks Joseph, and thanks Manuel for Scala!). This doesn&apos;t amount to much more than noodling, but I wanted to just offer up some calculated noises in proof of my actually having gotten around to it!</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/five_drops.mp3">http://www.microtonal.org/mp3/five_drops.mp3</a></p><p>&quot;Five Drops in the Desert&quot;, an improvisation in Archytas Enharmonic, using Scala, TX81Z, DX11, JV-1080, and R8. Mixed very badly straight outta the board into Sound Forge and squished into an mp3 with the RazorLame combo. Pretend there&apos;s a hobo out there with 5 drops of water left in the canteen...</p><p>Look: if a damn drummer can make this stuff work, *anyone* can! It&apos;s been a bit too quiet around here lately (thanks to Robert W. who I see posted just before this), and I&apos;d like to think that everyone has been busy with other things. But it would be nice for Mom to hear some more music, no?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=1988 href="#1988">ðŸ”—</a>kalleaho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2002 2:10:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon!</p><p>Just FANTASTIC!

Most well recorded sounds (I&apos;m not saying music here) wouldn&apos;t need as much bathtub reverb as I threw on it, but the thin-ness of the FM boxes warrant some sort of space. I dialed through some of my old custom patches, and there are slightly more substantial sounds, but this quicky just seemed to want these patches.

Those two were used for two components: the Roland JV-1080 was the generator of the 12-string guitar, simply playing the same open fifth as in the Archytas scale (the JV is not microtunable, so I&apos;m pulling a sneaky one here) and the R8M is an older rackmount percussion module from Roland, used for the little bit of perc stuff. The JV is a real workhorse for 12tet mockups, because it has lots of sounds and expandability and very easy to use multi-timbrally (sp?)...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2008 href="#2008">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>2/12/2002 1:20:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jonathan M.
