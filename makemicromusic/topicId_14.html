Not<br/>sure of the tuning capabilities, but my guess is they could<br/>be &quot;tweaked...&quot;  Isn&apos;t this a little like what &quot;Reaktor&quot; was trying<br/>to do??</p><p>Hello Joseph,</p><p>On August 6th, Sound Quest will begin shipping Infinity v2.0, the<br/>complete sound design and multi-media control studio. For more<br/>information on this long awaited release please keep reading, or go<br/>directly to Sound Quest&apos;s web site at <a href="http://www.squest.com">www.squest.com</a> for additional<br/>information, graphics, and introductory offer.</p><p>Create Your Own Synthesizers, Samplers and Audio Effects<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>With Infinity 2.0 you can now create synthesizers, samplers, and<br/>audio effects devices which are as simple or as complex as you need<br/>them to be. Its potential is virtually limitless. Imagine creating<br/>your own synth using 4, 8, 12 or 16 oscillators instead of just the 2<br/>that a typical hardware synthesizer usually gives you.</p><p>Infinity is a powerful and intuitive real-time audio development<br/>platform. An extensive set of modules - there are over 360 of them -<br/>provide the building blocks you use to create your own audio tools.<br/>Building your instrument is as easy as clicking, pointing and linking<br/>up each of the necessary elements together. You will quickly be able<br/>to build virtually any audio effect, synth, or sampler you can<br/>imagine.</p><p>Create Your Own Completely Original Sounds<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>With Infinity you can connect any module to any other module. This<br/>gives you the freedom to create your own collection of completely<br/>original sounds from the unusual and unexpected, to the extreme - all<br/>of the things you can&apos;t do with your traditional instrument hardwired<br/>to the standard Oscillator-Filter-Amplifier audio path.</p><p>This &quot;no boundaries&quot; approach will make Infinity an indispensable<br/>part of your studio. Infinity gives you all of the standard synth and<br/>sampler sounds when you need them but now you will also have the<br/>tools to undertake any audio exploration you can imagine - from<br/>twisted FM, to mutated samples, to frequency domain processed sounds.</p><p>Plug Infinity in Anywhere<br/>-------------------------<br/>Infinity isn&apos;t just a self-contained sound creation studio. It also<br/>includes support for all major Windows audio and MIDI plug-in<br/>formats: DXi, VSTi, VST, DirectX 8.0 and MFX.</p><p>These plug-in formats allow you to play any of Infinity&apos;s<br/>synthesizers or samplers in SONAR, Cubase, Logic, or any other<br/>application which fully supports Steinberg&apos;s VSTi plug-in format.</p><p>Any audio effect processor created in Infinity to modify an audio<br/>track can be used with any audio software through the DirectX or VST<br/>plug-in formats.  A small sampling of the software supported<br/>includes: Cakewalk Pro Audio, SONAR, Sound Forge, Cool Edit Pro, and<br/>Samplitude.</p><p>The Infinity Instrument Collection<br/>----------------------------------<br/>Not only does Infinity include everything you need to create your<br/>audio tools, it also includes a collection of instruments and effects<br/>you can use in your music right now. Just choose from 23 synthesizers<br/>(including straight ahead 1, 2, and 3 oscillator synths, organs, FM<br/>synths, and string machines), 2 drum kits, or 42 different audio<br/>processing effects and you&apos;re ready to go. Each instrument has its<br/>own unique and customizable interface and the selection will<br/>continue to grow as Sound Quest adds new instruments which can be<br/>downloaded from its web site. Infinity also includes over 100 MIDI<br/>processing patches and can manipulate MIDI in any way you wish.</p><p>Infinity gives you a head start when you begin creating your own<br/>instruments and effects from scratch. With over 140 predefined<br/>macros, Infinity already includes the basic building blocks you will<br/>need to make your synthesizer. For example, if you need to add an<br/>ADSR envelope you don&apos;t have to build it, just drag and drop it from<br/>the envelope macros menu and you&apos;re done. It&apos;s easy to create<br/>massive chains of synthesis, sample and processing modules using<br/>Infinity&apos;s graphic signal flow layout window and you can create your<br/>own custom control surfaces without writing a single line of code.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget, you can also begin your sonic explorations by simply<br/>loading any one of Sound Quest&apos;s existing instruments and modifying<br/>it to meet your requirements.</p><p>Your sounds don&apos;t have to be static any more. Automate them!<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Every instrument control offers full automation when used in Infinity<br/>and every audio plug-in format. This means that you can record every<br/>knob tweak or slider pull in DXi, VSTi, VST, and DirectX. In<br/>Infinity, just add a sequencer object, press record and automation<br/>events are automatically recorded. They can even be edited from<br/>within the sequencer&apos;s editor windows.</p><p>You don&apos;t even have to go through the hassle of setting each control<br/>to a separate MIDI controller number as you do in other programs.<br/>Every control is dynamically assigned its own unique automation<br/>identifier, with no limit on the number of controls that you can<br/>automate.</p><p>With Infinity, every control can also be automated using MIDI. You<br/>can assign incoming MIDI controller events directly to controls or<br/>first apply your own custom MIDI processing before using the values<br/>to alter the instrument.</p><p>Infinity makes it easy. Just Drag and Drop itÂ….<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>Infinity features the most extensive drag and drop capabilities<br/>possible. Anywhere that a file from disk is used, be it a wave file,<br/>bitmap graphic, Midi Quest patch, or Infinity patch, instead of going<br/>through the hassle of typing in a path and file name, you can simply<br/>drag the file from Explorer and drop it into Infinity.</p><p>Superior Graphic Control<br/>--------------------------<br/>With Infinity, you have complete control over the design and layout<br/>of each instrument&apos;s control panel. You can place the controls<br/>anywhere in the window you wish and make them any size you want. Most<br/>importantly, for the graphic knobs, sliders, switches, and VU meters,<br/>you can display the control using a selection of included bitmaps or<br/>use your own custom bitmaps for the display. You can even specify<br/>that your own graphics be used as defaults for every control where a<br/>bitmap isn&apos;t specifically selected. You won&apos;t find this level of<br/>flexibility and customization anywhere else.</p><p>The Freedom to Play<br/>----------------------<br/>Infinity gives you the unparalleled freedom to play. You can load as<br/>many different instruments into the program simultaneously (limited<br/>by the processor&apos;s ability to play all instrument voices) as you<br/>wish. Just try these with other software synthesizers.</p><p>If you want to have 32 different instruments independently controlled<br/>by inputs from two different MIDI inputs, you can do it.</p><p>Easily create your own multi-instrument performances. If you want to<br/>try a different bass instrument, close or turn off the current bass<br/>you have loaded and bring in another. There are no connections to<br/>make before you hear audio; it works right away.</p><p>Want to let others hear your new creation? With the freely<br/>distributable Infinity Player you can put your masterpiece up on the<br/>web for everyone to play with.</p><p>Conclusion<br/>-----------<br/>Infinity turns your computer into a real musical instrument. It is a<br/>truly open-ended sound development system that you can use without<br/>requiring any additional custom hardware. With the power to create a<br/>virtually unlimited number of sounds, it may be one of the most<br/>powerful sound creation tools you will ever own.
