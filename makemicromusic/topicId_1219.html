It really flows nicely, and I feel very honored my name<br/>&gt; is attached to it.</p><p>Hello, there, Mary, and thanks for your inspiration both in choosing a<br/>timbre and in letting my own musical style flow in a new (to me)<br/>scale.</p><p>One feature of &quot;MBA Phi Voice&quot; is that it includes a partial optimized<br/>more or less for the &quot;Phi-like&quot; interval of 9/13 octave or about 831<br/>cents. This is a tribute both to you and to John Chowning, who<br/>created a piece in 1981 named _Stria_ based on a ninth-root-of-Phi<br/>tuning almost identical to 13-tET.</p><p>&gt; I look forward to adding my voice.  Currently my studio is in the<br/>&gt; process of being dismantled, and we are warily eying a Category 4<br/>&gt; hurricane, so it will be a while before I get to it :-))</p><p>Please let me send my prayers that you get through the storm without<br/>harm, as well as my great anticipation of hearing your vocal version<br/>when the time is right.</p><p>&gt; Peace and thank you greatly,<br/>&gt; Mary</p><p>Peace to you also, with many thanks and blessings,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2001 6:54:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Robert.</p><p>&gt; I can also well imagine Mary singing with it too.</p><p>Thank you for this and other encouragement on _Organum for Mary Beth<br/>Ackerley_, and I look forward to hearing your 13-tET improvisations or<br/>pieces as well as her vocal version of this improvisation.</p><p>One thing I regret is needing to hear these things via CD or cassette<br/>rather than directly off the Web -- but thanks to you and others who<br/>share your music so generously, and also of course to Jacky for<br/>helping to make my music available with much musical and technical<br/>artistry.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2001 3:11:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Robert, and it seems that some &quot;creatively ambiguous<br/>communication&quot; on my part may have given you an opportunity to come up<br/>with 13-tET progressions which could be at least as interesting as the<br/>not-so-definitive interpretation intended in my original notation.</p><p>There&apos;s a bit of humor in this, as well as a suggestion of how inexact<br/>notation can sometimes present opportunities for new solutions.</p><p>Here&apos;s the notation I posted, and your interpretation which fits my<br/>usual conventions:</p><p>&gt;&gt; D                              S11<br/>&gt;&gt; Bb B                           S7   S8<br/>&gt;&gt; G                              S4<br/>&gt;&gt; F                              S1<br/>&gt;&gt; D  E     or more generally     S-2  S0</p><p>&gt; mode -2 1 4 7 11 -&gt; 0 1 4 8 11</p><p>&gt; or relative to the dim7th chord&apos;s root:</p><p>&gt; 0 3 6 9 13 -&gt; 2 3 6 10 13</p><p>Here your reading indeed fits my usual convention that a given note in<br/>any voice is sustained until a new note or a rest (r) is indicated, or<br/>until the conclusion of the example.</p><p>Thus, translating these scale steps into rounded cents, we have your<br/>diminished seventh chord of 0-277-646-831-1200 cents resolving with<br/>the lowest and the next-to-highest voices moving while the others<br/>remain stationary, arriving at a sonority of 0-92-369-738-1015 cents.</p><p>Here, however, my intent was rather less adventurous, resolving the<br/>diminished seventh to a simple fifth, 0-8 steps, or 0-738 cents. My<br/>&quot;problem&quot; was that I was simply visualizing which keys were pressed<br/>for each sonority, without considering the usual convention about<br/>sustained notes.</p><p>Here, in this kind of five-voice writing, there are lots of unisons in<br/>the sonority of resolution, so that it seemed easier just to show the<br/>resolving two notes without deciding on a precise partwriting for all<br/>those unisons. Here is one such solution:</p><p>D  B                           S11  S8<br/>Bb B                           S7   S8<br/>G  E                           S4   S0<br/>F  E                           S1   S0<br/>D  E     or more generally     S-2  S0</p><p>This would be mode</p><p>-2 1 4 7 11 -&gt; 0 0 0 8 8</p><p>or relative to the diminished seventh chord&apos;s root:</p><p>&gt; 0 3 6 9 13 -&gt; 2 2 2 10 10</p><p>However, what I now realize is that even in the kind of style I was<br/>considering where 0-8-13 (0-738-1200) or 0-5-1200 (0-462-1200) is the<br/>basic stable concord, a natural and richer solution would be to let<br/>the outer parts move in octaves, arriving at a complete 0-738-1200:</p><p>D  E                           S11  S13<br/>Bb B                           S7   S8<br/>G  B                           S4   S8<br/>F  E                           S1   S0<br/>D  E     or more generally     S-2  S0</p><p>Here we have mode</p><p>-2 1 4 7 11 -&gt; 0 0 8 8 13</p><p>or relative to the diminished seventh chord&apos;s root:</p><p>&gt; 0 3 6 9 13 -&gt; 2 2 10 10 13</p><p>The same applies to the other example, where again your quite logical<br/>reading of my notation led to a resolution of 0-92-277-831-923 cents<br/>(counting from the lowest voice of this sonority at &quot;S-1,&quot; taken as<br/>sustained from the previous sonority):</p><p>&gt;&gt; D                              S9<br/>&gt;&gt; B  C#                          S5   S8<br/>&gt;&gt; G                              S2<br/>&gt;&gt; F                              S-1<br/>&gt;&gt; D  F#1   or more generally     S-4  S0</p><p>&gt; mode -4 -1 2 5 9 -&gt; 0 -1 2 8 9<br/>&gt; or relative to the dim7th chord&apos;s root:</p><p>&gt; 0 3 6 9 13 -&gt; 4 3 6 12 13</p><p>Here is my originally intended progression,</p><p>D  C#                          S9   S8<br/>B  C#                          S5   S8<br/>G  F#1                         S2   S0<br/>F  F#1                         S-1  S0<br/>D  F#1   or more generally     S-4  S0</p><p>mode -4 -1 2 5 9 -&gt; 0 0 0 8 8</p><p>or relative to the diminished seventh chord&apos;s root:</p><p>&gt; 0 3 6 9 13 -&gt; 4 4 4 12 12</p><p>&gt; Yes, they are striking resolutions.</p><p>Here you have translated what was in effect my &quot;slip of the keyboard&quot;<br/>into new music, taking what I actually wrote (with your fine sonority<br/>as a starting point), and making it your own.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve done a couple of midi clips of these for everyone to listen to,<br/>&gt; again on sitar, but they work fine on the Yamaha soft synth sitar<br/>&gt; too, so I expect pretty generally. Tried them on a fair number of timbres<br/>&gt; and most work.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve uploaded them to the files area for anyone to listen to.</p><p>Since I&apos;m not sure how reliable the links to those files are in the<br/>text version of your post that I&apos;m quoting, why don&apos;t I do a link to<br/>your message giving the URL&apos;s:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1231">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1231</a></p><p>Maybe it might be fun for people to compare these progressions with<br/>the ones I meant to notate in similar timbres.</p><p>&gt; Also I can imagine how a resolution to the 0 3 6 9 could be<br/>&gt; possible too, as it seems to be a fairly consonant chord<br/>&gt; somehow.</p><p>Yes, I found it quite pleasant.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for the encouragement. I&apos;d like to make a CD for you and anyone<br/>&gt; else and will do something about it.</p><p>I&apos;m really looking forward to this CD, and thank you in the meantime<br/>for making your music available to so many people so generously.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2001 10:46:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s a bit of humor in this, as well as a suggestion of how inexact<br/>&gt; notation can sometimes present opportunities for new solutions.</p><p>Yes, it made me laugh!</p><p>Surprisingly they do work as cadences, with a direction to them -<br/>if you run them other way it doesn&apos;t work. Decidedly adventurous<br/>sure.</p><p>I&apos;ll do the cadences properly.</p><p>I&apos;ve also started planning for the cd yet. Don&apos;t yet have a cd<br/>writer but if I do a few clips for it, will then be ready<br/>to get one at that point.</p><p>Did a first try at the Sesquisexta using a font with a rather<br/>realistic choir Ahs. Too realistic almost because one<br/>hears changes from one voice to another as it progresses<br/>as though one person is chagning into another.</p><p>Aother one was a very nice string quartet, except that<br/>it had a wide vibrato with modulation set to 0, and<br/>also had a quiet but noticeable background sound that<br/>swooped about in pitch with the song. Rather strange<br/>effect; wouldn&apos;t notice it perhaps in less quiet pieces.</p><p>I&apos;m on the look out for a nice string quartet font as<br/>the one on my soundcard isn&apos;t so good really, and quite<br/>a lot of my pieces use strings. Just now, downloading<br/>a large font of 27 Mb called Symphony hall, just based<br/>on the name, from this site with a large list of fonts.<br/><a href="http://www.thesoundsite.net/sf_c_dirlist.tml">http://www.thesoundsite.net/sf_c_dirlist.tml</a><br/>Does anyone know anything about any of them? They are<br/>all free to download!</p><p>Some of the SB LIve! fonts are very nice I like the<br/>Sitar voice a lot. Doesn&apos;t have to be super realistic<br/>to be appealing, taken on its own terms.</p><p>Been making a few of the old pieces into mp3s today,<br/>and uploading them to the Australian <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site.<br/>Rather interesting selection of music there, and they<br/>are especially on the look out for classical sounding music as<br/>they get asked why they don&apos;t have more of it.</p><p>Anyway, more later,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
