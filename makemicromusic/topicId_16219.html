(Fo*tunately, I can copy the MMM add*ess<br/>f*om an<br/>&gt; add*ess book, although I haven&apos;t figu*ed out how to impo*t text with<br/>this<br/>&gt; mail *eade*, since the needed code is Cont*ol-* -- in Emacs, I can<br/>use an<br/>&gt; octal code. When I get back, a new keyboa*d should solve this<br/>situation.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Howeve*, I didn&apos;t want to leave without cong*atulating you on you*<br/>&gt; Blackwood piece and you* fascinating discussion of how you go about<br/>&gt; composing in this tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fi*st, some feedback on the piece, josephpeh*son_mic*op*oject.mp3.<br/>&gt; The*e a*e t*uly exquisite moments that b*ing out something you a*e much<br/>&gt; mo*e familia* with: the special beauty of Blackjack. Those moments,<br/>&gt; whateve* the explanation one wants to t*y, we*e indeed *eached by you*<br/>&gt; method of playing, expe*imenting, and *efining th*ough t*ial and e**o*.<br/>&gt; This is how I often app*oach any tuning, and am cu**ently explo*ing<br/>&gt; Zest-24, a 24-note ci*culating system based on two ci*cles modified f*om<br/>&gt; Za*lino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, the pitched sono*ities we*e beautiful, and evidence that you*<br/>&gt; method yields many f*uits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because of my p*oblems with sound sensitivity, some of the non-pitched<br/>&gt; effects o* the like which seemed conside*ably loude* than a lot of the<br/>&gt; pitched sono*ities did complicate things, putting me in a mood to<br/>focus on<br/>&gt; acoustical safety and &quot;How loud will this get&quot; *athe* than setting the<br/>&gt; volume so that I could easily hea* the quiete* details of those<br/>beautiful<br/>&gt; ha*monies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me st*ess that this is _not_ a p*oblem unique to<br/>Blackjack, o*<br/>&gt; to pieces with less conventional sounds: it is a dynamic tole*ance and<br/>&gt; comfo*t p*oblem that could apply to any music with app*eciable dynamic<br/>&gt; va*iations. I&apos;ve lea*ned to be defensive, and listen to a piece<br/>fi*st with<br/>&gt; some caution until I can fo*m a mental &quot;map&quot; of the dynamic levels and<br/>&gt; adjust the volume acco*dingly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the less conventional sounds had been at about the same level as the<br/>&gt; pitched ones -- o* so it had seemed to me, since I know that loudness<br/>&gt; pe*ceptiion is subjective -- then I would have much enjoyed that<br/>pa*t too.<br/>&gt; Again, it is a matte* of my own idiosync*acies, and wouldn&apos;t necessa*ily<br/>&gt; affect othe*s that way -- much like a &quot;cont*asty&quot; piano piece (whe*e<br/>this<br/>&gt; cont*ast is, of cou*se, the ve*y sou*ce of the inst*ument&apos;s name).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I&apos;d also emphasize, as someone who often focuses on *atios of 3, 7,<br/>&gt; 11, 13, etc., is that 5-limit thi*ds and sixths _do_ have a special<br/>&gt; beauty, which you* Blackjack music ve*y much b*ings out. It isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessa*y to impose a unive*sal standa*d of 5-limit intonation to<br/>&gt; *ecognize its special qualities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F*om my point of view, to quote Keenan Peppe*, &quot;It&apos;s so 16th-centu*y,&quot;<br/>&gt; which maybe makes it a bit mode*n, but then mode*n compose*s like<br/>Josquin,<br/>&gt; Lasso, and Monteve*di (the ea*ly mad*igals) got me sta*ted in all this,<br/>&gt; and I love and use meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You* piece is, to sum up, a most wo*thy use of the unique *esou*ces of<br/>&gt; Blackjack, a compose*ly achievement to inspi*e us all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peace and love, and best while I&apos;m visiting my Mom,<br/>&gt;    _<br/>&gt;   | |<br/>&gt; Ma| \go<br/>&gt;</p></div>
