Course, nothing wrong with advanced math folks having a good time...but most musicians are more interested in music....Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=26741 href="#26741">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2011 8:11:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil&gt;&quot;In regards to what Aaron just posted about the tough math here...I was<br/>surfing the net the other day, under Microtonality, just to see what<br/>was there...on several sites I did indeed see folks saying that much<br/>tuning talk on the net that they had seen was very math oriented, and<br/>very hard to understand.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Right...and in the end of the day, in my opinion, all the math in the world still comes down to sound/music samples and if those samples don&apos;t click with people...it&apos;s ultimately a no-go in the music world.&nbsp; It would be nice if those of us who do post sound samples could generate consistent enthusiastic on-topic discussion but, alas (and in much agreement with what Chris said earlier)...that does not seem to happen much...which leads people back to talking about math.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally you can throw all the math in the world at me...and I&apos;ll still say a huge majority of it can all be summarized in basic fractions, arithmetic, and basic degrees of error in the end of the day at &quot;worst&quot;...and sound samples that people simply rate as better or worse at best.&nbsp; I figure, if we are going to stick with math...the &quot;smartest&quot; people should be the ones who get the most musical concepts covered with the least complex equations.&nbsp; And in some cases only complex equations will do, but we can at least try to promote an environment that doesn&apos;t seem to almost intentionally scare people with them upon first glance.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
