Early on my group<br/>Spectral Voices sang inside a vast empty water tower, (where<br/>we &apos;played the space&apos; - this also inspired our creativity), and two<br/>recordings came out from those adventures: &quot;Coalescence&quot; and &quot;Sky.&quot;</p><p>Since the demise of the water tower we&apos;ve been working with<br/>electronic reverb to recreate the spaciousness of it (it also makes<br/>performing this music more practical - imagine the logistics of<br/>getting an audience into a water tower!!).  We&apos;ve also been<br/>experimenting with a looping device (digital Echoplex) - which I&apos;ve<br/>used extensively when performing and recording solo to have<br/>a &quot;virtual choir&quot; supporting me on the fly.</p><p>&quot;The Way Beyond&quot; is one offspring from this approach.</p><p>One favorite exercise (that is used many times on TWB) is to sing a<br/>relatively &apos;consonant&apos; chord with the fundamentals and play with the<br/>overtones to create intense shimmery dissonances, beat tones etc.</p><p>Thought I&apos;d leave you with another&apos;s impressions of this work but<br/>first here&apos;s a link to audio clips of &quot;The Way Beyond:&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com/clips.htm">http://www.spectralvoices.com/clips.htm</a></p><p>...reposting these comments by Bill Beck that were<br/>originally posted to the Yahoo spacemusic list:</p><p>&quot;Every remarkable sound on the 70+ minute continuous piece is sourced<br/>by his voice. Quiet, calming, and meditative; deeply textured and<br/>sublime.  Achingly poignant.  I&apos;m thinking that some of us will be<br/>talking about Jim Cole&apos;s brand-new release, &quot;The Way Beyond,&quot; for a<br/>very long time.</p><p>I can recall only one other spacemusic release effecting upon me such<br/>a profound misty-eyed reaction during my first hearing.</p><p>And now that the CD has, here, been thrice journeyed through, it can<br/>be told.  I never dreamed &quot;Coalescence&quot; would ever be surpassed as<br/>this artist&apos;s masterstroke, but, in my opinion, it just has.</p><p>Plain and simple, music like this is why I&apos;m here.&quot;</p><p>**************</p><p>Thanks Bill!</p><p>And thanks to all of you here (including esp. List Mom!) for your<br/>consideration - I&apos;d love any constructive feedback about the music<br/>etc.</p><p>~Jim<br/><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a></p></div>
