Many of the ideas in it may be &quot;patentable&quot; but earnings is not the point.</p><p>   On the other hand, though, I agree there is a narrow job span for those wholeheartedly dedicated to working on innovative ideas as a full time job.  Thus I believe such people should get some sort of minimal resource grants from government (IE $35,000 US per year) to support them EVEN if they aren&apos;t world-renowned professors or the like.<br/>   It is sad, for example, that MIDI software suites are being sold for over $400 when the number of aspiring MIDI songwriters would probably double to triple if prices were lowered...the cost of material for software is essentially nothing and advertising is not expensive...there should easily be enough to support software designers/developers per year even if the software went for $120 a copy.  Also, people who are truly passionate about promoting music and musicians through software creation shouldn&apos;t need a $100,000/yr.+ salary to make it worth their while.</p><p>   The reason the music industry in so many ways has gone downhill since the 60&apos;s despite technology is the fact record labels, software designers...have focused on expensive studios, concerts, overpriced software...as the &quot;entry point/barrier&quot; for musical success and/or scene participation rather than the talent and/or passion of the musicians and their supporters.  Bands nowadays are often just known well for months or about a year at most due to, say, the decades the Beatles and Rolling Stones have been known for and music magazines IE Keyboard often talk about studio tech and expensive equipment rather than actual music theory.</p><p>   As a software developer I feel much obliged to help reverse this nasty trend and put the power of creating music toward anyone with the passion to learn to do so regardless of background and networking.  And I, for one, would rather have $35,000 a year for an open-source software product that was constantly being improved than $120,000 a year for one that isn&apos;t financially available to most of those who want it and/or is being pirated without any input from customers for improvement.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>BT &lt;julian.silverman@...&gt; wrote:                               I don&apos;t want to get to involved in a subject I know very little<br/> about.
