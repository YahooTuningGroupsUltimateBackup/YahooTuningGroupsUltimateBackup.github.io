When the exception handler<br/>pops up, use Shift + Click on the button<br/>(OK, Yes, or NO, whatever you choose)<br/>and it will make a bug report and an e-mail<br/>with it as an attachement. Then add any<br/>other details about what you were doing<br/>at the time.</p><p>This logs the lines as they are reached,<br/>about every ten to a hundred lines in<br/>the code. So it has a good chance<br/>of pinpointing it fairly accurately.</p><p>That might be enough to work out what it<br/>is, or I might need to add some more debug<br/>code, in which case if<br/>you download it again that would probably<br/>locate it exactly, and provide the<br/>needed information.</p><p>So, do please crash it again if you can, and<br/>send me a bug report!</p><p>...................</p><p>You can also make another type of log file<br/>with some useful information in it<br/>To do that, type #dbg into the<br/>Time for One note box. A check box<br/>will show up called &quot;Debug log&quot;<br/>Select it. Everything will run very<br/>slowly at that point,<br/>because it is making the log file.</p><p>Now crash it. Then when it crashes you should<br/>find a file called DEBUG_LOG<br/>in its folder, and if you send<br/>that as well it will be a great<br/>help. The two reports complement each other.</p><p>...................</p><p>Or if it crashes in several ways,<br/>send me several reports - the more<br/>the better...</p><p>...................</p><p>BTW I&apos;ve also added in an experimental<br/>MFX plug in for Cakewalk / Sonar etc.<br/>for this upload (thanks to Jacky<br/>for the idea :-)).</p><p>It&apos;s not really tested much yet,<br/>probably the next upload will be a<br/>better time for it, but it will give<br/>an idea of how it will work.</p><p>..................</p><p>Don&apos;t be too hard on the author of Midi Yoke<br/>- he is doing it for free after all,<br/>and has written a super program - most<br/>find it works perfectly.</p><p>It is very stable and fast at relaying, seems<br/>to be far faster than Hubi&apos;s, so it&apos;s well<br/>worth persisting to get it installed<br/>if you can, and it is great for daisy<br/>chaining programs together.</p><p>Another option of course is to<br/>just connect the line out of your<br/>soundcard back round to the line in<br/>(e.g. using a microphone cable)<br/>which works if you then play the<br/>sound out of your soundcard<br/>at the end or have another<br/>line out to use or whatever.</p><p>That&apos;s basically doing the same<br/>thing that Midi Yoke does, but<br/>using hardware instead of software.</p><p>Anyway back to finishign the<br/>new upload and I&apos;ll post<br/>here when it is done.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
