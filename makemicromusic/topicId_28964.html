If anyone can do<br/>&gt; it, it&apos;d be you.</p><p>I agree with you that we don&apos;t want to overwhelm them with feature<br/>requests from the start. I thought about it tonight and came to the<br/>conclusion that it might be best to throw everything I said away and<br/>think a bit longer-term. I think the best thing that we can do right<br/>now is to just get our foot in the door by making sure they don&apos;t<br/>hard-wire 12-EDO into everything; everything else is really just<br/>secondary to that.</p><p>I think it might be a pretty huge victory in and of itself if we could<br/>at least ensure, at this critical point in the development life cycle<br/>of the product, that they set their classes up so that the &quot;pitch&quot;<br/>member of their Note class is declared as a float instead of a char or<br/>whatever. If we can at least get that to happen, we can lobby them<br/>with a slow trickle of feature requests for subsequent releases, like<br/>the ability to assign an arbitrary periodic scale to a staff, or Scala<br/>file support, or custom accidentals, or MTS or custom MIDI note<br/>offsets or whatever we want.</p><p>I think that we simultaneously increase our chances of success,<br/>decrease the amount of work they&apos;ll have to do to make us happy, and<br/>increase the quality of the product from our standpoint by just making<br/>sure they don&apos;t screw it up with 12 now, since many of the things we<br/>want will be -far- easier for them to do if they build things from the<br/>ground up with the simple idea that notes are real numbers instead of<br/>integers. As far as microtuning is concerned, it actually makes their<br/>job easier to do it right from the start, and gives us a better<br/>product anyways.</p><p>It might be a good idea to lobby for just one or two utterly minimal<br/>features which force them to understand how to best make things not<br/>12-centric, something like MTS support or Scala file support in some<br/>basically constructive way. Just something simple that we can build on<br/>later. In the meantime, we still have Mus2 and the like, but given a<br/>solid foundation now, this program will eventually kick Mus2&apos;s ass.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That would also work, but we&apos;d have to have a way for the note<br/>&gt; &gt; offsets to repeat every period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you imagining the MIDI notes are equally tuned?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose for that matter, with arbitrary MIDI tuning, the stepwise<br/>&gt; offsets already produced by most notation packages should be<br/>&gt; sufficient... so the requested functionality should go beyond this.</p><p>I figured you wanted something like the ability to set the notes of<br/>the staff to MIDI notes being consecutively numbered 5-5-3-5-5-5-3 or<br/>4-3-3-3-3-3-3, rather than 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. So, we&apos;d have to input a<br/>scale as a pattern of step sizes, and then find a way for the scale to<br/>repeat each octave. Of course, with 5-5-3-5-5-5-3, you only get four<br/>total octaves to work with, and god forbid anyone should want to set a<br/>staff up for sensi[8] in 46-EDO. It isn&apos;t the worst idea though.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you think MTS is too much of a chore to ask for? I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; imagine it being that difficult, being standardized and all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MTS may be a standard but it&apos;s implemented very unevenly.

It&apos;s good you bring this<br/>up here though, I&apos;ll have to ruminate on it a bit.</p><p>What you say about MTS lacking support is true, but I wonder if this<br/>is a vicious circle and if we should perhaps be embracing it and<br/>starting to push for it. After all, nobody else has embraced MTS<br/>because the only people in the world who would ever embrace to begin<br/>with are us here. We haven&apos;t embraced it because developers haven&apos;t<br/>implemented it, and they haven&apos;t implemented it because nobody&apos;s<br/>lobbying for it, and the only ones who would ever lobby for it are us.<br/>So maybe we should start a longer-term policy of adopting MTS as a<br/>community and pushing hard for it as a longer-term solution, even<br/>outside of this specific case with Steinberg.</p><p>There&apos;s one reason I especially think it might be wise for us to adopt<br/>MTS, and that&apos;s because we might not need to wait for softsynth<br/>developers to jump on board to make use of it. MTS seems like a nice<br/>sort of grand central station for us to use to convert to all sorts of<br/>other formats: it seems like it&apos;d be a rather straightforward project<br/>to build an MTS -&gt; MIDI pitch bend or MTS -&gt; MIDI note mapping<br/>converter, and a tool like that would go a long way. If you use JUCE<br/>to write it, it&apos;d work on five platforms and can compile to VST, RTAS<br/>and AU, and I know college students who could probably do it in a<br/>month and a half if we threw $300 their way.</p><p>If we had a single open-source tool like that, then it would be<br/>extremely simple to lobby all sorts of software manufacturers for<br/>microtuning support: just tell them to add MTS support, and not to<br/>worry about anything else involving pitch bends, or channel swapping,<br/>or MIDI note remappings, or Scala, or any other &quot;hacks.&quot; They just<br/>implement MTS, and we already know we have tools and workflow to<br/>handle the rest for other legacy apps.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m not set on any of this, but these are my ruminations on all of it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=28972 href="#28972">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2013 9:58:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; MTS may be a standard but it&apos;s implemented very unevenly.

Note On&apos;s can simply become<br/>(MTS message) (Note On) and you&apos;re good to go.</p><p>&gt; &gt;After all, nobody else has embraced MTS<br/>&gt; &gt;because the only people in the world who would ever embrace to begin<br/>&gt; &gt;with are us here. We haven&apos;t embraced it because developers haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;implemented it,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pretty much all Roland synths (and many others) support it. But<br/>&gt; Roland&apos;s implementation is, as I understand it, generally not<br/>&gt; compatible with others. That&apos;s why you have to tell Scala exactly<br/>&gt; which synth you have when using MTS.</p><p>I guess I&apos;ll have to do more research.

If you pick those two things as your<br/>basis, you get |3 5&gt; being the perfect fourth, for instance; |1 0&gt; is<br/>the diesis and |0 1&gt; is the chromatic semitone.</p><p>So tuples of the form (number of diatonic scale steps, number of<br/>chromatic scale steps) uniquely represent all meantone intervals - in<br/>fact, more abstractly, (number of spaces subtended on the staff, MIDI<br/>note #) uniquely represents any meantone interval. Man, I wish the<br/>people at Steinberg would set their notation system up that way! That<br/>would make other rank-2 things so easy to set up... argh.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Would the actual best solution, assuming we could convince the<br/>&gt; &gt;industry to ever go along with it, be to make the standard &quot;note on&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;just be an MTS tuning message plus a regular note on immediately<br/>&gt; &gt;after? I always thought so, but now I&apos;m thinking that would ruin fast<br/>&gt; &gt;lines if the release trail is still sounding when the MTS message for<br/>&gt; &gt;the next note occurs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is what the non-realtime single note tuning change messages<br/>&gt; are for.</p><p>Ah, beautiful, I missed that. I guess that&apos;s one of the extensions.</p><p>BTW, do you have any idea what the heck the &quot;number of changes&quot; thing<br/>means? It looks like you can send more than one change at a time to<br/>&quot;assist in maximizing bandwidth,&quot; and that the 7th byte of the<br/>real-time tuning change (what they call &quot;ll&quot;) is to specify how many<br/>changes you want to make. The only problem is, all of your multiple<br/>per-message changes must be made to the same note at once...?</p><p>&gt; &gt;Would MIDI + MTS even be able to handle our needs at all if we<br/>&gt; &gt;actually used in its current form?

MIDI is almost everything<br/>you could possibly need for keyboard input.  Output to a<br/>synth should have a tuning option, and MTS provides that.<br/>The note number has to stay even on output because there are<br/>cases where it&apos;s important.   The same quartertone might<br/>sound different depending on what pitch you bent it from.<br/>And portamento depends on identifying the currently sounding<br/>note.  7 bits is fine if all you need is a tag to identify<br/>a currently sounding note.</p><p>Input devices that aren&apos;t keyboards can have very<br/>different requirements, which is why OSC ends up as an<br/>abstract format for tunneling music descriptions rather<br/>than a format for describing music.</p><p>The best thing to retrofit the existing MIDI messages would<br/>be to have an omni mode where the channel becomes part of<br/>the note number.

But it would be much better not to have to deal with those, and simply be able to define the tuning of the default scale (the nominals, ie. the notes without accidentals, preferably not even limited to 7 notes and repeating octaves) and cent values for the (custom) accidentals, the number of which should be unlimited. In fact, this is precisely how Mus2 works. So this would use whatever single-note tuning system Steinberg does for the internal VSTi&apos;s. This leaves the question of sending midi out to other software or hardware instruments.</p><p>In Finale, the way I get a Johnston-notated score to play back is as follows:</p><p>1. A hardware synth or a softsynth is tuned to the 5-limit C-major scale with some other tuning method than pitchbend: the internal system of the synth, .scl, .tun etc.<br/>2.I&apos;ve made a library of Johnston accidentals as &apos;Text Expressions&apos; as these are the kinds of symbols in Finale to which you can attach a playback command - a pitch bend value in this case. I also define 5 &apos;black notes&apos; as either C# or Dd, Eb or D etc. (Johnston&apos;s # and b = 25/24), so that I can enter these notes from the midi keyboard without having to use the special accidentals. But if the default scale has a C#, I would have to write a Db by inserting a D and manually adding a special 25/24 flat.<br/>3.Accidentals have to put in front of the notes manually with the mouse, although each can have its own key command, and the placement can be somewhat automated. But it does require a lot of manual graphical adjustment.<br/>4. There&apos;s a &apos;pitch bend-to-zero&apos; sign which has to be used after each chromatically altered note. It&apos;s visible on the screen but invisible in the printout.<br/>5. Obviously, pitch bend affects the whole channel. Even so, polyphony, and with trickery with some Finale tools, chords, can be written on a single stave because in Finale, each stave can have up to four polyphonic layers, each of which can assigned its own midi channel. But in practice it&apos;s pretty awkward. Regardless of note layer, one has to manually assign the playback layer for each symbol. And writing chords is clumsy.<br/>6. Pitch bend commands don&apos;t &quot;add up&quot; so it&apos;s not possible, for instance, to transpose a note by two syntonic commas by inserting two plus signs in front of it. Rather, one must have a dedicated &apos;double plus&apos; symbol (++) for that.  In a JI notation the number of symbols gets potentially very large as distant moves in the lattice call for big clusters of notation symbols and each combination must have its own text symbol with its own pitch bend value.</p><p>(2) (playback commands assigned to custom symbols) and (5) (multiple midi channels on one stave) are not possible in Sibelius, I&apos;m told.</p><p>Custom staves (user-definable number of staff lines) were mentioned in this thread. They are possible in Finale and I assume in Sibelius, too. Mus2 has them, as well.</p><p>Mus2 is brilliant. For 31EDO, for example, you define the tuning (in cents, although for JI scales, ratios can also be used) for the notes of C major in 31EDO. Then you define your set of accidentals. For 31EDO you don&apos;t need any custom symbols, so you just pick #, b, the common quarter tone sharp and 1/4-tone flat signs, double sharps and flat, and possibly also 3/4 flat and sharp signs, and then define these in cents, so your sharp will be 77,419 cents, your &quot;quarter-tone&quot; symbols will be defined to stand for the diesis 38.7097 c, and the double sharp and flat = 4 diesis. The way you insert notes (in the present version) is that you choose the duration and the accidental for the note using key commands first and then insert the note by pressing C, D, E; F, G, A or B from the computer keyboard (no midi step entry yet). Then you use the arrow keys to move the note to the right octave if it wasn&apos;t in it.</p><p>Juhani</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At present, Finale is much more capable with microtonal notation (with<br/>&gt; &gt; playback) than Sibelius but it&apos;s quite cumbersome.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve written scores in Johnston&apos;s notation in Finale with working<br/>&gt; &gt; playback.

Directly porting the Scordatura code into Mus2 perhaps? Just brainstorming here...</p><p>I also asked Utku to make it easier to define and notate irregular tunings &amp; temperaments in Mus2. Take for instance my Yarman-24b tuning demonstrated here in the tanbur animation I made:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP1elrsk5QM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP1elrsk5QM</a></p><p>where one currently requires to define all the sharps and flats individually in reference to the natural noteheads for correct intervallic alterations in the Mus2 pitch palette. I wanted Utku to allow the user to specify the value of an accidental in reference to any of all the pre-set naturals, as shown in my graphic representation attempt attached below. The Turkish &quot;tek tek belirt&quot; translates to English as &quot;specify individually (from each natural pitch)&quot; - so that one may engrave a score in an irregular tuning as easily as one would a regular or equal temperament (in like manner to your exemplification for 31-EDO).</p><p>If sufficient desire is expressed in this direction, I&apos;m sure Utku will find the time to implement the feature in Mus2, relieving us of the burden of specifying several accidentals bearing the same appearance but different values only to be used precisely vis-a-vis their respective natural noteheads (e.g. Yarman24b_EyGuliBagiEda.mus2 attached).

Well, that would be beat not having them (as in Sibelius where you can&apos;t assign playback functions to custom symbols). But it would be much better not to have to deal with those, and simply be able to define the tuning of the default scale (the nominals, ie. the notes without accidentals, preferably not even limited to 7 notes and repeating octaves) and cent values for the (custom) accidentals, the number of which should be unlimited. In fact, this is precisely how Mus2 works. So this would use whatever single-note tuning system Steinberg does for the internal VSTi&apos;s. This leaves the question of sending midi out to other software or hardware instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Finale, the way I get a Johnston-notated score to play back is as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. A hardware synth or a softsynth is tuned to the 5-limit C-major scale with some other tuning method than pitchbend: the internal system of the synth, .scl, .tun etc.<br/>&gt; 2.I&apos;ve made a library of Johnston accidentals as &apos;Text Expressions&apos; as these are the kinds of symbols in Finale to which you can attach a playback command - a pitch bend value in this case. I also define 5 &apos;black notes&apos; as either C# or Dd, Eb or D etc. (Johnston&apos;s # and b = 25/24), so that I can enter these notes from the midi keyboard without having to use the special accidentals. But if the default scale has a C#, I would have to write a Db by inserting a D and manually adding a special 25/24 flat.<br/>&gt; 3.Accidentals have to put in front of the notes manually with the mouse, although each can have its own key command, and the placement can be somewhat automated. But it does require a lot of manual graphical adjustment.<br/>&gt; 4. There&apos;s a &apos;pitch bend-to-zero&apos; sign which has to be used after each chromatically altered note. It&apos;s visible on the screen but invisible in the printout.<br/>&gt; 5. Obviously, pitch bend affects the whole channel. Even so, polyphony, and with trickery with some Finale tools, chords, can be written on a single stave because in Finale, each stave can have up to four polyphonic layers, each of which can assigned its own midi channel. But in practice it&apos;s pretty awkward. Regardless of note layer, one has to manually assign the playback layer for each symbol. And writing chords is clumsy.<br/>&gt; 6. Pitch bend commands don&apos;t &quot;add up&quot; so it&apos;s not possible, for instance, to transpose a note by two syntonic commas by inserting two plus signs in front of it. Rather, one must have a dedicated &apos;double plus&apos; symbol (++) for that.  In a JI notation the number of symbols gets potentially very large as distant moves in the lattice call for big clusters of notation symbols and each combination must have its own text symbol with its own pitch bend value.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) (playback commands assigned to custom symbols) and (5) (multiple midi channels on one stave) are not possible in Sibelius, I&apos;m told.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Custom staves (user-definable number of staff lines) were mentioned in this thread. They are possible in Finale and I assume in Sibelius, too. Mus2 has them, as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mus2 is brilliant. For 31EDO, for example, you define the tuning (in cents, although for JI scales, ratios can also be used) for the notes of C major in 31EDO. Then you define your set of accidentals. For 31EDO you don&apos;t need any custom symbols, so you just pick #, b, the common quarter tone sharp and 1/4-tone flat signs, double sharps and flat, and possibly also 3/4 flat and sharp signs, and then define these in cents, so your sharp will be 77,419 cents, your &quot;quarter-tone&quot; symbols will be defined to stand for the diesis 38.7097 c, and the double sharp and flat = 4 diesis. The way you insert notes (in the present version) is that you choose the duration and the accidental for the note using key commands first and then insert the note by pressing C, D, E; F, G, A or B from the computer keyboard (no midi step entry yet). Then you use the arrow keys to move the note to the right octave if it wasn&apos;t in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Juhani</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=29009 href="#29009">ðŸ”—</a>nuorvala &#x3C;jnylenius@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2013 3:18:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Oz,</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Utku has made his intention known to me to the effect that upcoming versions of Mus2 will soon feature soundfont integration. That is to say, one will be able to load an external soundfont to play non-factory preset sounds as desired.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tend to imagine that Aaron Andrew Hunt could mayhap assist Utku with his superior knowledge on how to do this via Scordatura (discontinued?) or MicroSynth? Directly porting the Scordatura code into Mus2 perhaps? Just brainstorming here...</p><p>Yes, I heard that soundfont support is coming which is excellent. Aaron&apos;s microsynth has it, as well as his CSE.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also asked Utku to make it easier to define and notate irregular tunings &amp; temperaments in Mus2. Take for instance my Yarman-24b tuning demonstrated here in the tanbur animation I made:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP1elrsk5QM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP1elrsk5QM</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where one currently requires to define all the sharps and flats individually in reference to the natural noteheads for correct intervallic alterations in the Mus2 pitch palette. I wanted Utku to allow the user to specify the value of an accidental in reference to any of all the pre-set naturals, as shown in my graphic representation attempt attached below. The Turkish &quot;tek tek belirt&quot; translates to English as &quot;specify individually (from each natural pitch)&quot; - so that one may engrave a score in an irregular tuning as easily as one would a regular or equal temperament (in like manner to your exemplification for 31-EDO).</p><p>Do you mean that a flat sign, for example, would produce a different alteration in pitch if it&apos;s attached to, say, E, instead of G? Interesting.<br/>Another thing that would be useful, and that I have mentioned to Utku, would be the possibility to attach several accidentals to one notehead, so that in playback, the cent values of each of them would be added together. This would be important in JI notation systems where moves on the lattice are shown by adding comma signs to the accidentals. Toby Twining&apos;s score for his masterpiece Chrysalid Requiem has accidentals such as 77777#++  etc. (his is an extreme example but the number of signs in JI notation quickly grows).</p><p>Juhani</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If sufficient desire is expressed in this direction, I&apos;m sure Utku will find the time to implement the feature in Mus2, relieving us of the burden of specifying several accidentals bearing the same appearance but different values only to be used precisely vis-a-vis their respective natural noteheads (e.g. Yarman24b_EyGuliBagiEda.mus2 attached). Admittedly, this method of using redundant accidentals becomes cumbersome to follow if a piece is very long and intricately polyphonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear colleagues,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I uploaded to my Youtube Channel an annotated video of a bowed tanbur fret-highlight animation with in-sync audio that I prepared myself. This video with sound shows the Yarman-24 tuning fret positions and notation on my own bowed tanbur diagram. The animation with synchronized audio recording in the background represents both the fifths cycle of 17-tones and the 12-tone Modified Meantone Temperament core cycle, which yield the 22 pitches out of 24 per octave. The remaining blue colored pitches are extra-cyclic. It is meant to replace Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek while depending on the same array of accustomed microtonal accidentals.

&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, that would be beat not having them (as in Sibelius where you can&apos;t assign playback functions to custom symbols). But it would be much better not to have to deal with those, and simply be able to define the tuning of the default scale (the nominals, ie. the notes without accidentals, preferably not even limited to 7 notes and repeating octaves) and cent values for the (custom) accidentals, the number of which should be unlimited. In fact, this is precisely how Mus2 works. So this would use whatever single-note tuning system Steinberg does for the internal VSTi&apos;s. This leaves the question of sending midi out to other software or hardware instruments.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In Finale, the way I get a Johnston-notated score to play back is as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. A hardware synth or a softsynth is tuned to the 5-limit C-major scale with some other tuning method than pitchbend: the internal system of the synth, .scl, .tun etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2.I&apos;ve made a library of Johnston accidentals as &apos;Text Expressions&apos; as these are the kinds of symbols in Finale to which you can attach a playback command - a pitch bend value in this case. I also define 5 &apos;black notes&apos; as either C# or Dd, Eb or D etc. (Johnston&apos;s # and b = 25/24), so that I can enter these notes from the midi keyboard without having to use the special accidentals. But if the default scale has a C#, I would have to write a Db by inserting a D and manually adding a special 25/24 flat.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3.Accidentals have to put in front of the notes manually with the mouse, although each can have its own key command, and the placement can be somewhat automated. But it does require a lot of manual graphical adjustment.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. There&apos;s a &apos;pitch bend-to-zero&apos; sign which has to be used after each chromatically altered note. It&apos;s visible on the screen but invisible in the printout.<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. Obviously, pitch bend affects the whole channel. Even so, polyphony, and with trickery with some Finale tools, chords, can be written on a single stave because in Finale, each stave can have up to four polyphonic layers, each of which can assigned its own midi channel. But in practice it&apos;s pretty awkward. Regardless of note layer, one has to manually assign the playback layer for each symbol. And writing chords is clumsy.<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. Pitch bend commands don&apos;t &quot;add up&quot; so it&apos;s not possible, for instance, to transpose a note by two syntonic commas by inserting two plus signs in front of it. Rather, one must have a dedicated &apos;double plus&apos; symbol (++) for that.  In a JI notation the number of symbols gets potentially very large as distant moves in the lattice call for big clusters of notation symbols and each combination must have its own text symbol with its own pitch bend value.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (2) (playback commands assigned to custom symbols) and (5) (multiple midi channels on one stave) are not possible in Sibelius, I&apos;m told.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Custom staves (user-definable number of staff lines) were mentioned in this thread. They are possible in Finale and I assume in Sibelius, too. Mus2 has them, as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mus2 is brilliant. For 31EDO, for example, you define the tuning (in cents, although for JI scales, ratios can also be used) for the notes of C major in 31EDO. Then you define your set of accidentals. For 31EDO you don&apos;t need any custom symbols, so you just pick #, b, the common quarter tone sharp and 1/4-tone flat signs, double sharps and flat, and possibly also 3/4 flat and sharp signs, and then define these in cents, so your sharp will be 77,419 cents, your &quot;quarter-tone&quot; symbols will be defined to stand for the diesis 38.7097 c, and the double sharp and flat = 4 diesis. The way you insert notes (in the present version) is that you choose the duration and the accidental for the note using key commands first and then insert the note by pressing C, D, E; F, G, A or B from the computer keyboard (no midi step entry yet). Then you use the arrow keys to move the note to the right octave if it wasn&apos;t in it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Juhani<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=29013 href="#29013">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2013 12:00:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Juhani,</p><p>Yes, I mean exactly just what you said:</p><p>&gt; Do you mean that a flat sign, for example, would produce a different alteration in pitch if it&apos;s attached to, say, E, instead of G?

The Turkish &quot;tek tek belirt&quot; translates to English as &quot;specify individually (from each natural pitch)&quot; - so that one may engrave a score in an irregular tuning as easily as one would a regular or equal temperament (in like manner to your exemplification for 31-EDO).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you mean that a flat sign, for example, would produce a different alteration in pitch if it&apos;s attached to, say, E, instead of G?

Rather, one must have a dedicated &apos;double plus&apos; symbol (++) for that.  In a JI notation the number of symbols gets potentially very large as distant moves in the lattice call for big clusters of notation symbols and each combination must have its own text symbol with its own pitch bend value.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (2) (playback commands assigned to custom symbols) and (5) (multiple midi channels on one stave) are not possible in Sibelius, I&apos;m told.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Custom staves (user-definable number of staff lines) were mentioned in this thread. They are possible in Finale and I assume in Sibelius, too. Mus2 has them, as well.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Mus2 is brilliant. For 31EDO, for example, you define the tuning (in cents, although for JI scales, ratios can also be used) for the notes of C major in 31EDO. Then you define your set of accidentals. For 31EDO you don&apos;t need any custom symbols, so you just pick #, b, the common quarter tone sharp and 1/4-tone flat signs, double sharps and flat, and possibly also 3/4 flat and sharp signs, and then define these in cents, so your sharp will be 77,419 cents, your &quot;quarter-tone&quot; symbols will be defined to stand for the diesis 38.7097 c, and the double sharp and flat = 4 diesis. The way you insert notes (in the present version) is that you choose the duration and the accidental for the note using key commands first and then insert the note by pressing C, D, E; F, G, A or B from the computer keyboard (no midi step entry yet). Then you use the arrow keys to move the note to the right octave if it wasn&apos;t in it.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Juhani<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Using a &quot;specify individually&quot; option in the future, one need not define so many same-appearing but different-sounding accidentals.

That is to say, one will be able to load an external soundfont to play non-factory preset sounds as desired.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I tend to imagine that Aaron Andrew Hunt could mayhap assist Utku with his superior knowledge on how to do this via Scordatura (discontinued?) or MicroSynth?

I wanted Utku to allow the user to specify the value of an accidental in reference to any of all the pre-set naturals, as shown in my graphic representation attempt attached below. The Turkish &quot;tek tek belirt&quot; translates to English as &quot;specify individually (from each natural pitch)&quot; - so that one may engrave a score in an irregular tuning as easily as one would a regular or equal temperament (in like manner to your exemplification for 31-EDO).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you mean that a flat sign, for example, would produce a different alteration in pitch if it&apos;s attached to, say, E, instead of G?

This video with sound shows the Yarman-24 tuning fret positions and notation on my own bowed tanbur diagram. The animation with synchronized audio recording in the background represents both the fifths cycle of 17-tones and the 12-tone Modified Meantone Temperament core cycle, which yield the 22 pitches out of 24 per octave. The remaining blue colored pitches are extra-cyclic. It is meant to replace Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek while depending on the same array of accustomed microtonal accidentals.

But it would be much better not to have to deal with those, and simply be able to define the tuning of the default scale (the nominals, ie. the notes without accidentals, preferably not even limited to 7 notes and repeating octaves) and cent values for the (custom) accidentals, the number of which should be unlimited. In fact, this is precisely how Mus2 works. So this would use whatever single-note tuning system Steinberg does for the internal VSTi&apos;s. This leaves the question of sending midi out to other software or hardware instruments.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In Finale, the way I get a Johnston-notated score to play back is as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1. A hardware synth or a softsynth is tuned to the 5-limit C-major scale with some other tuning method than pitchbend: the internal system of the synth, .scl, .tun etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2.I&apos;ve made a library of Johnston accidentals as &apos;Text Expressions&apos; as these are the kinds of symbols in Finale to which you can attach a playback command - a pitch bend value in this case. I also define 5 &apos;black notes&apos; as either C# or Dd, Eb or D etc. (Johnston&apos;s # and b = 25/24), so that I can enter these notes from the midi keyboard without having to use the special accidentals. But if the default scale has a C#, I would have to write a Db by inserting a D and manually adding a special 25/24 flat.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3.Accidentals have to put in front of the notes manually with the mouse, although each can have its own key command, and the placement can be somewhat automated. But it does require a lot of manual graphical adjustment.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 4. There&apos;s a &apos;pitch bend-to-zero&apos; sign which has to be used after each chromatically altered note. It&apos;s visible on the screen but invisible in the printout.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 5. Obviously, pitch bend affects the whole channel. Even so, polyphony, and with trickery with some Finale tools, chords, can be written on a single stave because in Finale, each stave can have up to four polyphonic layers, each of which can assigned its own midi channel. But in practice it&apos;s pretty awkward. Regardless of note layer, one has to manually assign the playback layer for each symbol. And writing chords is clumsy.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Pitch bend commands don&apos;t &quot;add up&quot; so it&apos;s not possible, for instance, to transpose a note by two syntonic commas by inserting two plus signs in front of it. Rather, one must have a dedicated &apos;double plus&apos; symbol (++) for that.  In a JI notation the number of symbols gets potentially very large as distant moves in the lattice call for big clusters of notation symbols and each combination must have its own text symbol with its own pitch bend value.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (2) (playback commands assigned to custom symbols) and (5) (multiple midi channels on one stave) are not possible in Sibelius, I&apos;m told.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Custom staves (user-definable number of staff lines) were mentioned in this thread. They are possible in Finale and I assume in Sibelius, too. Mus2 has them, as well.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Mus2 is brilliant. For 31EDO, for example, you define the tuning (in cents, although for JI scales, ratios can also be used) for the notes of C major in 31EDO. Then you define your set of accidentals. For 31EDO you don&apos;t need any custom symbols, so you just pick #, b, the common quarter tone sharp and 1/4-tone flat signs, double sharps and flat, and possibly also 3/4 flat and sharp signs, and then define these in cents, so your sharp will be 77,419 cents, your &quot;quarter-tone&quot; symbols will be defined to stand for the diesis 38.7097 c, and the double sharp and flat = 4 diesis. The way you insert notes (in the present version) is that you choose the duration and the accidental for the note using key commands first and then insert the note by pressing C, D, E; F, G, A or B from the computer keyboard (no midi step entry yet). Then you use the arrow keys to move the note to the right octave if it wasn&apos;t in it.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Juhani<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

If it is monstrous, that is only because some people want to notate tunings which are &quot;monstrous&quot; (have large numbers of pitches or pitches very close together). Show me another notation (apart from cent or ratio annotations) that can do this at all.</p><p>However it is not necessary to implement the full Sagittal system. Most of what anyone needs to notate can be done with the subset called &quot;Spartan&quot;. That&apos;s all Jacob Barton used with his &quot;Sagibelius&quot; scripts.</p><p>We named it so, because we felt it partook of the qualities of the ancient Spartans. As it says in various dictionaries:<br/>&quot;sternly disciplined and rigorously simple, frugal, or austere&quot;.</p><p>Of its 9 symbols, the 5 larger ones are obvious compositions of 3 of the smaller ones. So only the meanings of four shapes need to be learned.</p><p>With the Spartan symbol set you can notate 5-limit ratios with factors ranging from 5^-4 to 5^4, the 9 limit diamond, and the first 16 harmonics and subharmonics. You can notate 60 EDOs including 51 of the most popular below and including 72-EDO. And consequently you can notate all of the &quot;Middle Path&quot; temperaments that approximate these ratios and are represented in these EDOs. All without needing to use more than one sagittal symbol per notehead.</p><p>The Spartan subset has been called &quot;elegant&quot; by those who have used it.
