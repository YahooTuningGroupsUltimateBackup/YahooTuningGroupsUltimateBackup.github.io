My trouble is this: the harmonic series does indeed serve as a useful -- and I believe perhaps the most useful -- tool, if only as a point of departure, in describing and investigating intonational resources and tonal practice in general, and it does, indeed, have great explanatory power for phenomena in music history. However, for most of music history and in most music cultures, the abstract idea of a harmonic series was not available to either practicing musicians nor to theorists.  It is a relatively late discovery, and musically useful facility with its properties is an even later development.  Nevertheless, productive music theories were produced within the limitations imposed by an absence of harmonic theory, and to an extent -- presumably large -- the direction of creative work was shaped by this absence. Thus, at least three great lines of exploration were established in classical Greek and Hellenistic music theory that have persisted despite this deficit: the so-called pythagorean line, in which one attempted to describe or invent scales through the reiteration of the simplest ratio beyond the non-productive ratios of the two-limit; a more complex practice, with which the names Archytas, Eratosthenes, and Ptolemy are associated, in which one sought out the simplest, or most elegant, representations of real genera by ratios without the restrictions of the three-limit; and the tradition associated with Aristoxenus, which attempted to describe details of scales without the use of ratios, but rather as perceptual units without precise measure (a similar tradition may very well underly the srutis of Indian theory).  (This tradition would eventual develop a number of more precisely quantified theories, ascribing to these units precise, and eventually logarithmic, values).</p><p>In modern theory and practice, working without the resources of this particular tool is confining, if not foolish. A harmonic series has great explanatory power for phenomena of consonance and dissonance, and can be very useful in creating harmonic and contrapuntal textures, and in orchestration. It is even useful in cases in which the instruments used do not have simple harmonic spectra or in tuning enviroments which correspond only weakly to the intervals of a harmonic series, if only as a point of departure.  However, the retroactive use of this tool can be misleading:  choices made in real, historical, musical practice, and often choices of great musical ingenuity, were made without these resources.</p><p>It might be argued that the harmonic series, being ever present in pipes and strings, and present in the harmonic division of a string length, was known but simply not articulated in ancient harmonic theory or even that an ancient intuition of a relationship between sensory consonance and rational intervals implied the harmonic series and did not need to be articulated.  In the Washington Monthly blog today, Kevin Drum has a provocative small item (here: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_11/012487.php">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_11/012487.php</a> ) about a similar &quot;obvious&quot; phenomena in the history of physical science -- the fact that no one seems to have figured out that gravity accelerates all objects at the same speed until that business in Pisa -- and perhaps the absence of a modern harmonic theory is an even more concrete example of missing the obvious, simply because the existing theory was sophisticated enough to produce all the music that one needed or even imagined needing.  In any case, an account of the historical development of musical practice should at least take this into consideration.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div><h3><a id=18071 href="#18071">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2007 9:14:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Magnus and AaronKJ, thanks for the kind words.<br/>There are still many pages lacking, but I&apos;m<br/>relatively happy with what is there.</p><p>Daniel, I think AKJ wrote &quot;logical natural source&quot;,<br/>not be taken to mean &quot;historical natural source&quot;.<br/>The word &quot;natural&quot; might make one cringe having<br/>the knowledge that a pure harmonic series is<br/>encountered in nature about as often as is a<br/>frictionless surface; yet physicists often talk about<br/>a frictionless surface just as a theorist talks about<br/>a perfect harmonic series, that is, as an abstract<br/>ideal state or structure.</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt; In any case, an account of the historical<br/>&gt; development of musical practice should at least take<br/>&gt; this into consideration.</p><p>I agree.
