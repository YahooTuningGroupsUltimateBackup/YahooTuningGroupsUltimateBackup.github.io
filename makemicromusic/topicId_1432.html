Another person can poke in regularly, answer a thread til finished, and go back into lurking mode. Another can get very involved and then life - real, outside life - can intrude on the pleasure and stimulus of the dialogue and pOOf - they&apos;re gone.</p><p>Try not to read too much into the comings and goings of list members. Many of you know that, fortunately or not, I make my occupation as a &quot;Professional Musician&quot;, and for me right now is ugly busy. Ten shows a week since the beginning of November and free-lance work on top of that. As such, I just don&apos;t have the time and energy that I sometimes have.</p><p>Or I&apos;m down.</p><p>Or I&apos;ve got energy to burn, but on other things.</p><p>Or I&apos;m bummed out.</p><p>But it can be like that for anyone, so be gentle, and accept that sometimes the &apos;conversations&apos; will seem to end abruptly. If you have a good feeling about your correspondent, the thread will begin again, down the road...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
