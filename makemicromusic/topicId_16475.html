The set-up I settled on had the feature that every pitch is spelled in a way that corresponds to the performers&apos; learned associations. That way the score, with its &quot;correct&quot; spelling, could be played directly by the performers (or, conversely, you can read the performing parts without having to translate any pitches). It went like this:</p><p>piano 1: C C# D D# E  F F# G G# A A# B<br/>piano 2: C Db D Eb Fb F Gb G Ab A Bb Cb</p><p>So the shared pentatonic is on C-D-F-G-A; piano 1 can play in diatonic areas from C major to B major, and piano 2 can play in diatonic areas from Cb major to Bb major. Poor F major gets left out!</p><p>This scheme gives both of the enharmonically equivalent pairs, E#/Fb and B#/Cb, to the same piano. Other variants that preserve my &quot;correct spelling&quot; feature are these:</p><p>piano 1: C C# D D# E E# F# G G# A A# B<br/>piano 2: C Db D Eb E F  Gb G Ab A Bb Cb</p><p>(C-D-E-G-A shared; no C major on either piano)</p><p>piano 1: B# C# D D# E E# F# G G# A A# B<br/>piano 2: C  Db D Eb E F  Gb G Ab A Bb B</p><p>(D-E-G-A-B shared; no G major on either piano)</p><p>Since I find flat key signatures easier to read than sharp signatures, I preferred the first arrangement.</p><p>Mandelbaum&apos;s arrangement, in his 19-tone book, is the one you describe. Iirc, not only do the performers have to relearn some associations (or you have to respell their parts), but the detuning on the piano strings is more uneven, which makes it less stable. And diatonic scales are very hard to find on one of the pianos. I think Mandelbaum had Db Eb Gb Ab Bb shared, then piano 1 had CDEFGAB and piano 2 had C#D#E#F#G#A#B#. The symmetry of the 5 black notes being shared is tempting but one of the pianists will have a hard job.</p><p>Best - Jon</p><p>(p.s. if you decide to go with this scheme I have a tuning chart I prepared for the tuner that minimised overall offsets from ET--but in the end he tuned an extended 1/3-comma by ear and didn&apos;t need my cents offsets. Still you might find it useful for gauging the stress on the pianos and deciding on absolute pitch of the whole scheme. I also found it easier to sell the tuning to the music Faculty--in terms of them letting us mess with the pianos--as a historical tuning rather than as the exotic-sounding (to them) equal division of the octave into 19 parts)</p><p>On Thu, 29 Mar 2007, Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyone?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking sharing black notes and making the 2 keyboards have<br/>&gt; different white notes would be a logical choice, but then I though it<br/>&gt; might be better to make the common notes to be members of the set of<br/>&gt; fewest accidentals key signatures....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any thoughts?</p></div><h3><a id=16484 href="#16484">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2007 11:19:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>this is your classic model and the i would do first. i think they went with the same type of subset idea with the 17.<br/>one thing i have noticed though, is how you place it on your keyboard effects the way you think about it so when you run out of ideas with this one you might try a less conventional one, even in the same piece.<br/>for instance i have had experience with  vibes layouts of the same set of bars.<br/>i started with one where the major scale that just happens to be there on C and used an arrangement where it is quite easy to play.<br/>When people would come over they would find it and unfortunately just stick wit hit.<br/>Later i used two different ones the latter made such scale very very hard to play and so when people came up to it they went in a different direction by exploring, but accepted the language quickly and took off.</p><p>Jon Wild wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Aaron - I arranged a concert with 2 pianos in 19-equal years ago.

At the moment stuck in 17edo<br/>&gt; &gt; counterpoint problems, though...</p><p>Sure! Alright, here is what I am currently trying to do.</p><p>First-species counterpoint (two voices, note against note) can be<br/>described as follows: Given a melody (cantus firmus); wanted is a<br/>second voice (descant), fulfilling certain conditions. I use the<br/>following notation, which was essentially coined by Guerino Mazzola<br/>(but I am not using his mathematical formulae - no worry!): A two-<br/>voiced piece is notated as a series of pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2,),<br/>(a3, b3,)... where the an are the pitches of the first voice (cantus<br/>firmus) and the bn are the intervals that are formed by the second<br/>voice (descant). Now, many rules of classical counterpoint boil down<br/>to the following question: Given an, bn and a(n+1), what are the<br/>possible values for b(n+1)? For example, the famous prohibition of<br/>fifth parallels translates as: if bn is a fifth, then b(n+1) must not<br/>be a fifth.<br/>A complete listings of all possible b(n+1) describes a simplified<br/>counterpoint system and can be displayed as a set of the following<br/>diagrams. This is one of the diagrams for 17EDO I am currently trying<br/>to build - by trial and error merely, by composing first and taking<br/>the steps afterwards. The idea for the diagram is, again, taken from<br/>Guerino Mazzola.</p><p>                 cantus firmus +1<br/>**********************************************************<br/>                  &lt;from interval&gt;<br/>   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16<br/>                                                        0<br/>                                                        1<br/>                                                        2<br/>            *                    *                      3<br/>                                                        4<br/>                                                        5<br/>                        *                               6<br/>                        *        *                      7<br/>                                                        8      to<br/>                                                        9      in-<br/>                               * * *                   10      ter-<br/>                                                       11      val<br/>                                                       12<br/>                                                       13<br/>                                                       14<br/>                                                       15<br/>                                                       16</p><p>In the title stands the pitch difference (in steps of 17EDO) from an<br/>to a(n+1).

In any event, I hope you all knew I<br/>&gt;was, and didn&apos;t go hardcore into writing anything heavily yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The temptation to give Joel Mandelbaum an easy job of transposing his<br/>&gt;older works to the scheme Jon Wild mentioned, and have new works<br/>&gt;reflect the same easier-to-read scheme, is giving me second thoughts<br/>&gt;about the mapping for MidwestMicroFest&apos;s first concert that I had<br/>&gt;announced earlier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think I now favor the one Jon Wild *first* mentioned, which is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;piano 1: C C# D D# E  F F# G G# A A# B<br/>&gt;piano 2: C Db D Eb Fb F Gb G Ab A Bb Cb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The shared pentatonic C-D-F-G-A allows Mandelbaum&apos;s scheme to be<br/>&gt;slightly transposed, so is thus backwards-compatible to a very<br/>&gt;historic mapping, while preserving legibility and allowing a very<br/>&gt;practical mapping going forward.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If there are no major objections, I&apos;d like to go ahead with this for<br/>&gt;all pieces in the October 20th concert in 19-edo.
