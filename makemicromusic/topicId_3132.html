You seem to be able to vary how<br/>much of it you have, or is it just that you always have<br/>it on the quieter notes?</p><p>I won&apos;t try to guess what it is - don&apos;t have a clue and<br/>can&apos;t think of anything close to it amongst the instruments<br/>I know. The way the pitch can be varied is very puzzling<br/>- do you have a whole family of them all very similar in<br/>timbre, or is it a single instrument that can be varied in pitch?<br/>Maybe you don&apos;t want to give that away yet.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
