I can understand your position of improving your musical skills by improving your computer skills. But musical skill is not eqivalent to computer literacy. Most of the world&apos;s musicians don&apos;t even own a computer and the ones that do prefer things to be as easy as possible. WYSIWYG, download now/I agree/next, next/finish/click/load/save etc etc etc.<br/>    I can quite easily get by without ever using Scala or learning to program. I have a Kurzweil K2500Rack which is capable of almost any imaginable tuning. All I need are intervals in cents to work with.<br/>    As the owner of two microtonal groups:<br/>    <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MicroMadeEasy/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MicroMadeEasy/</a><br/>    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microtonal">http://groups.google.com/group/microtonal</a><br/>    I have the responsibilty of keeping both experts and beginners amused, entertained and interested in what other people are doing in the microtonal world. At the moment I have been concentrating on gathering information and links to 24tet/quarter tone music because this area is somewhat neglected in the microtonal groups. I would like to promote Scala more but not as it presently stands in relation to its downloading procedures.</p></div><h3>robertthomasmartin &#x3C;robertthomasmartin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2010 4:32:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is an installer for Windows.

I downloaded Scala for Windows then was told that I had to download/run the Gtk+ installer for Windows version 2.12.10 or higher. So I went to the Gtk+ download page and downloaded the first item on the list. This seems to have worked so thankyou for giving me the confidence to try again. Now I have another microtonal toy to play with.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2010 4:41:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert wrote:<br/>&gt;   From Robert.

I wrote down the procedure I followed and posted it to the Discussions section at<br/>  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microtonal">http://groups.google.com/group/microtonal</a><br/>  the viewing of which is open to the general public.<br/>  So perhaps it might help some other poor unfortunate computer dummy like myself.
