To my knowledge they&apos;re all seven notes musical scales.<br/>The quarter-tone scale (24tET) that I propose, however, has eight notes.<br/>Do you know of the exsistence of other 8 notes musical scales?<br/>I designed the quarter-tone scale because managing a music system that is generated by a 8 notes musical scale is less difficult than a system based on a 7 notes scale. I figured that the coefficient of difficulty (measured on the number of musical alterations) drops from 76% to 57%.<br/>2) when I decided to call H the eighth note, I knew already that the same letter is used by German musicians instead of B. Remains true, however, that in the vast majority of the Western world the predominant notation is by far A_B_C_D_E_F_G. I simply aligned myself with this reality<br/>3) I agree: the best way to spread a new music system is to hear the music already composed. But to your question if there is already this music in movement, the answer is double-face.<br/>A) No, with my scale, since I&apos;m not a composer.</p><p>B) Since it&apos;s a  24tET scale, which is more than 150 years old there are plenty of compositions: Alaleona, Haba, Wyschnegradskji, Carrillo, Partch, Darreg, Blackwood, Halevy, Bartok, Ives, Penderecki, Xenakis, Scelsi, schnebel&apos;s music and others.</p><p>Thanks for your attention.
