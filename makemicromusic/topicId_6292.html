But possibly 22 is<br/>&gt; even better, or a good next step, because it is not a meantone system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t this be harder?  Why not start with something completely foreign,<br/>start with a clean slate,  and tell the newbie &quot;just play around and find<br/>stuff that you like, and use it&quot;?</p><p>Like 7 or 11 or 13 or 14 or 23.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve found it&apos;s virtually impossible to get most musicians to give up<br/>&gt; meantone or diatonic thinking in connection with consonant major and<br/>&gt; minor triads and the like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It requires a major re-wiring of the brain and giving up of deeply<br/>&gt; entrenched musical habits.</p><p>But if one is forced to deal with something compeltely unfamiliar,  then<br/>later,  when one comes to say, 19TET,  one might not immediately feel that<br/>one HAS to  seek out the most familiar territory in the tuning (major and<br/>minor triads).   Instead one could let references to the familiar &quot;sneak<br/>into&quot; one&apos;s music just a bit, while surrounded by all sorts of other<br/>sounds one discovers.  I think that might end up being more musically<br/>interesting;  it might pull something out of someone that they didn&apos;t<br/>expect could ever come out of them.  Later they can re-integrate this<br/>unexpected stuff with their old habits.</p><p>&gt; It seems to me we should be willing to accept that tuning systems do<br/>&gt; differ and that this is a practical consideration. The proposition<br/>&gt; that all tuning systems are equally usable is *theory*. My objection<br/>&gt; to it is not theoretical but practical--to my ears, it just ain&apos;t so.<br/>&gt; I would rate 15 as borderline, and 12 and 19 across the border; the<br/>&gt; border being my own personal one. 14 just does not do it for me. By<br/>&gt; the time we get to 31, things are sounding downright nice, though<br/>&gt; clearly this is still not JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently getting within 6 cents or so sounds pretty good to me,<br/>&gt; which is a theoretical analysis of the fact of my own auditory<br/>&gt; preferences. Getting within 3 cents, as 72 does, begins to sound a lot<br/>&gt; like JI. Systems such as ennealimmal, which get to within a fraction</p><p>But you&apos;re starting with a very abstract thing,  a tuning system, and<br/>assuming that the sound quality of the resulting music will depend on the<br/>&quot;quality&quot; of the tuning system . . which,  from your posting, seems to be<br/>how well it approximates JI, and perhaps a few other properties.</p><p>Whereas another approach is to say,  Given a tuning system, and a set of<br/>instruments,  how can I make effective music?</p><p>In other words,  tuning systems aren&apos;t &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; for the most part.<br/> . . . . but piece written with them (and involving a host of other<br/>factors) can be.</p><p>Good pieces have been written even in the impoverished 6-TET (whole tone<br/>scale).  Surely nothing&apos;s lamer than that?</p><p>&gt;       Balckwood Etude in 22TET<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I quite like it!  I like the &quot;tonal fanfare&quot; in 19 too.  My least<br/>&gt; favorite is the French-sounding stuff in 16, 18, and 21 (IIRC).<br/>&gt; But this is probably due to the fact that it&apos;s French-sounding<br/>&gt; rather than anything about the tunings.</p><p>I was wowed by the Stravinsky-Firebird-ish one in 16 (I believe).  (Or<br/>maybe it was 18?)    I guess it was kind of cheezy, but a lot of fun.</p></div><h3><a id=6294 href="#6294">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2004 12:52:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey<br/>&lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Wouldn&apos;t this be harder?

As my<br/>music gear is limited, I was able to access easily most of the equal<br/>temperaments from 6-24, but not much else.  This was plenty interesting<br/>enough, of course!  I made recordings in all of those tunings, and I found<br/>something in each of them that I enjoyed.  There were no tunings that I<br/>thought could not be composed it or were &quot;bad&quot;, or any such thing as that.<br/>I eventually found my favorites, but I kept playing all of them, because<br/>each is unique and beautiful and interesting in its own way, and by learning<br/>how to work in any tuning, we are gaining skills that apply in other areas.<br/>I played in 14tET, and I played in 19tET.  My favorites at the moment are<br/>17tET and 11tET.  (I couldn&apos;t get 22 and 23, and 7 didn&apos;t work either, by<br/>the way.)</p><p>For me, 19tET was, well, not that exciting.

It has all the same<br/>&gt; harmonies<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve heard all my life, and some other stuff that isn&apos;t all that exotic<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting.  I could write some traditional tonal music.  Big whoop.<br/>&gt; If I<br/>&gt; &gt; had only 19tET to work with, I wouldn&apos;t have been as excited by<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonality as I am today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm..I like 19-tet because it is a great &apos;bridge&apos; from traditional 12-tet<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; xentonal sounds. It&apos;s &apos;alien lite&apos; :)</p><p>It is indeed.  I guess that aspect doesn&apos;t appeal to me right now because<br/>&quot;bridging&quot; traditional music with nontraditional is not currently a musical<br/>goal of mine.  I&apos;m more interested in truly different sound universes.</p><p>&gt; For instance, yes, all the traditional triads are there, but you can<br/>&gt; modulate<br/>&gt; in pretty amazing ways. And every interval is a &apos;generator&apos;, since the<br/>&gt; number<br/>&gt; of pitches is prime. There are 2 sizes of half-step. And two tritones.<br/>&gt; There<br/>&gt; is a great sounding interval that divides the perfect 4th into 2 equal<br/>&gt; steps,<br/>&gt; which has a non-Wstern quality. Not your average run-of-the mill things<br/>&gt; tied<br/>&gt; to traditional Western music, if you ask me !!! (Of course, it is a more<br/>&gt; subtle departure than, say 14tet or 17tet.....)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not to mention there are plenty of ways, ala Messiaen, that you can create<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; your own synthetic scales in 19-tet, so you *don&apos;t* have to be tied to<br/>&gt; triads.</p><p>Yes, this is a list of interesting and very non-12 characteristics.  Thank<br/>you for pointing them out.  I&apos;ll have to play around with it some more.  I<br/>think &quot;boring&quot; is too strong a word for me to have used.  I found it less<br/>interesting in comparison with many other temperaments, and it did not<br/>naturally suit my musical goals.</p><p>&gt; I have to say that I agree that 19-tet is a wonderful start for those who<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want to shed 100% of our traditional roots and start from &apos;Tabula<br/>&gt; Rasa&apos;, but who want those traditional type things, but some additional<br/>&gt; tools<br/>&gt; to add a new color and mood...I think it&apos;s absolutely fabulous !!</p><p>I suppose my interest in shedding the stuffy skin of tradition is not such a<br/>common one.</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; think the best door into microtonality is different for different<br/>&gt; people.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, a fact to celebrate, surely ;)</p><p>Indeed!
