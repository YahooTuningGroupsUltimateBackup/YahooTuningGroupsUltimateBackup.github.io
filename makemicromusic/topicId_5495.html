And the bad news is that they have broken over the years. Once you have your instrument constructed, if it really is going to be made of simple window glass, you might consider hand/soft-mallet playing and have it amplified.</p><p>One other thing: resonant qualities of bar instruments are highly influenced by the consistency of the material (i.e. straight grain rosewood will always sound and tune better than wood with cross-grains, etc). If that glass has any variation in thickness, etc, it will make it a tad more of a challenge.</p><p>&gt;One interesting comment I found in an instrument building book I currently &gt;have at home (published ca. 1980?) is that any solid free-moving bar will &gt;have nodes at ca. 1/4 length from each end.</p><p>That is somewhat dependent on materials, and is also more intricate than simply 25% of the length. Somewhere I have more data on that, and I&apos;ll try to post if/when I find it. Until then, DB is right that you should check out the oddmusic group - lot of people there have done bar instruments...</p><p>Good luck!<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5499 href="#5499">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2003 7:52:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p> Hello Harold!<br/>    Still the best way to find nodes in especially old glass as it will get<br/>thicker toward the bottom with age is by sprinkling<br/>salt or sugar and tapping lightly. I am sure it might be at the very spot Paul<br/>mentions, but one cannot always be sure.  this will also give you the idea spot<br/>to drill , it you can figure out a way to do it. i have avaiod ed glkass for<br/>the mere reason that it is just too fragile. Although a thicker glass would<br/>possibly be nice, but then there is kelon which has a very &apos;china&apos; ( as in<br/>ceramics) like sound.<br/> possibly an instrument where you bowed the sides might be less likely to break<br/>as since even with soft mallets, you will be hitting at it weakest point.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 7<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 08 Oct 2003 20:59:33 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: glass xyl/marimba<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;harold_fortuin&quot; &lt;harold@m...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One interesting comment I found in an instrument building book I<br/>&gt; &gt; currently have at home (published ca. 1980?) is that any solid free-<br/>&gt; &gt; moving bar will have nodes at ca. 1/4 length from each end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have a vague recollection that a more precise figure for this is<br/>&gt; 0.225 (i have a strange ability to remember people&apos;s phone numbers<br/>&gt; without even trying) . . .<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=5500 href="#5500">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
