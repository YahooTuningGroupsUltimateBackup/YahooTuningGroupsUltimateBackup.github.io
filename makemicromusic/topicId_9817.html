Retuning a standard piano seemed like the<br/>likelier scenario.</p><p>I asked my Persian music teacher about the tar (4 double-course, or<br/>8-string, plucked instrument) tuning and he replied that it has the 12<br/>Western notes plus quarter-tones.  My observation of the instrument is<br/>that it is unlikely that all 24 quarter-tones of the octave are on the<br/>tar.  However, we ran out of time in our lesson, with the next student<br/>coming in, so I am yet unable to confirm this.  I also asked if the<br/>frets on the tar were ever moved, as they appear to be nylon and tied<br/>onto the neck, and he said &quot;no&quot;.</p><p>BTW, a cybercast of the March 2005 concert featuring my teacher and<br/>his ensemble is here:</p><p><a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/cybercasts/neareastcybercasts.html">http://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/cybercasts/neareastcybercasts.html</a></p><p>His introductory lecture on Persian music theory, immediately followed<br/>by his improvised duet on tar with tonbak, starts at around 6:47 into<br/>the cybercast.  The full orchestra includes harp and santur instead of<br/>piano.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=9831 href="#9831">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2005 8:14:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is not the case, which many iranians state .<br/>There are a whole series of recordings  by Darish Talai, where he comments on the necessity to move the frets.<br/>I have never seen any iranian using 24 ET, nor do i have any with a sample of probably over 25 recordings from the area.<br/>One can listen to the now quite popular Masters of Persian music which have been touring th US and can easily hear what intervals they use against their drones</p><p>paolovalladolid wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also asked if the<br/>&gt;frets on the tar were ever moved, as they appear to be nylon and tied<br/>&gt;onto the neck, and he said &quot;no&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=9832 href="#9832">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2005 11:44:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To be fair to my teacher, he was, as I said, rushed because our lesson<br/>was over and the next student was coming in.
