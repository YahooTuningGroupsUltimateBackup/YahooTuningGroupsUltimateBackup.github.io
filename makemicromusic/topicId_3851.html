But will surely be coming back to it - this is just a stage<br/>when I particularly need to get things underway in the way of the software side of things.</p><p>Main thing I do in the way of music making right now actually is that I just go out into the<br/>fields and woods and play and improvise amongst the bird song, trees rustling, helpicopters<br/>and distant traffic etc. Do enjoy that a lot. Perhaps I wonder, it may help one<br/>to play in a more flowing fashion.</p><p>Mainly practicing my Van Eyck pieces, or improvising, usually pretty much<br/>pentatonic / diatonic with a few accidentals, but sometimes a bit microtonal with narrow minor<br/>thirds say, or tiny fraction of a semitone intervals.</p><p>Recorder doesn&apos;t have many partials to help one with landmarks. and I&apos;m not one of those<br/>who can analyse and hear an interval on hearing it as so many cents values, and have<br/>no instrument or computer at hand to measure it with, so no idea really what I play that way,<br/>but enjoy it anyway.</p><p>Sometimes passers by (very occasionally since I like to play in little frequented parts of the<br/>woods) say they enjoy my playing. Some time I&apos;d like to try recording some tunes played<br/>out of doors in some wood somewhere with nice acoustics, and the birds singing and so forth.</p><p>I think I&apos;d quite like it if I went out for a walk and came across someone practicing an<br/>instrument away in the middle of nowhere, so hope they do to. Surprised no-one else<br/>seems to do it (here anyway) as the out of doors acoustics can sometimes be quite stunning!</p><p>..................</p><p>Did do more tests on the Roland Sound Canvas, - it is a bit strange as it seems to only have<br/>one cent accuracy - but the voices are repeated single waves most of them, with a bit of residual<br/>vibrato to give them some life I suppose. They sound surprisingly good actually, to my ear.</p><p>Anyway one wonders why it should be restricted to one cent accuracy - surely you could<br/>just do them to as much accuracy as you like with linear stretching of the waveform.<br/>if they are like that. But one cent is fine to start to explore microtonal intervals and to enjoy<br/>them, so I recommend it, as another alternative, like the Yamaha. Doesn&apos;t vary in pitch<br/>much from one voice to another, only by about one cent again.</p><p>I did a specturm analysis taking the recorder voice (which has no vibrato), and adding some controlled<br/>pitch variation to it, and got identical frequency spectra to the voices with the vibrato<br/>which I think strongly suggest that is indeed what causes those extra spikes on those ones.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
