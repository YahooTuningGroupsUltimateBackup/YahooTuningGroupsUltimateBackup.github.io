So,<br/>since living is scrounging, the result of our efforts is to amass a pile of<br/>rubbish.&quot;  - Chuang Tzu/Zhuangzi, China, 4th Century BCE</p><p>&quot;The most beautiful order is a heap of sweepings piled up at random.&quot; -<br/>Heraclitus, Greece, 5th Century BCE</p><p>    &quot;...So what is life for? Life is for beauty and substance and sound and<br/>colour; and even those are often forbidden by law [socio-cultural conventions].<br/>. .Why not be free and live your own life? Why follow other people&apos;s rules<br/>and live to please others?...&quot; ~Lieh-Tzu/Liezi, Taoist Sage (c. 450- 375 BCE)</p><p>    &quot;Taoism in a nutshell: Shit Happens. Roll with the Punches.

Bits have been<br/>found &amp; the rest is theory &amp; re-construction...<br/>    &quot;The whole world of musics and instruments lives around us....I am<br/>interested in a &apos;transethnic,&apos; a planetary music.&quot;  - Lou Harrison (&quot;...Europe is a<br/>region he called Northwest Asia...&quot;)<br/>    The power of education &amp; culture to transcend social and political<br/>differences is still largely untapped...</p><p>Ars sine scientia nihil est.
