This means that each planet&apos;s pitch changes over time, having a higher note when it is closer to the sun and a lower note when further away, the cycle being repeated (more or less) each time the planet in question completes its orbit.<br/>As well are proposing elliptical orbits for the firs time (rather than circles and epicycles), Kepler notes many harmonic relationships found in nature and argues that planets who&apos;s orbits lie next to each other have the position that they do because they are musically right. It is just intonation that Kepler regards as musically right. I have probably misrepresented Kepler&apos;s work to some extent.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices_Mundi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices_Mundi</a></p></div><h3><a id=22697 href="#22697">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2010 4:38:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 9 Jul 2010, at 2:10 AM, Ezekiel wrote:</p><p>&gt; The planetary tuning I used is from Hans Cousto - his book The &gt; Cosmic Octave explains it.

To calculate the sun frequency, he did something different, don&apos;t remember what it was, but it was interesting and it&apos;s in the book.</p><p>Anyone have a link to Kepler&apos;s planetary frequencies?  What about Berendt?</p></div>
