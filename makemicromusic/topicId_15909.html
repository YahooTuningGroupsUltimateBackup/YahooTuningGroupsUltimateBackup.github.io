Any comments strongly welcomed.  &gt; &gt; Milan (aum)</p><p>Definitely some ideas worth exploring here. Reminds me a bit of background music from late 90&apos;s-era video games. Some timbres work out better than others in this tuning. The brass section around 1:10 - 2:15 works unexpectedly well considering how far 7-et deviates from just fifths. Possibly because of the low register -- the higher-pitched brass around 3:30 seems more dissonant. The piano timbre around 5:00 sounds like a piano that hasn&apos;t been tuned in decades.</p><p>As you might expect, non-harmonic timbres like the marimba / vibraphone sequence around 8:00 - 9:00 hold up pretty well in this tuning. But the brass band with banjo that follows is also fine. Bright timbres with lots of overtones seem to work better than dull timbres, which focus attention on the mismatched 2nd and 3rd overtones in fifths.</p></div><h3><a id=15958 href="#15958">ðŸ”—</a>aum &#x3C;aum@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2007 8:28:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for reply.</p><p>Carl:<br/>I am glad you were listening to Spendliky again.<br/>The first sketch is based on the lengthening of melodic line. I have a text, following partly the same principle. A song might be more interesting.<br/>#3 - I am not a blues man at all, as you could hear from this piece, but neutral 3rd evoked the blues mood to me. Life version with long singing story would be better. The idea was to make an endless sequence of T-S progressions. The cycle is much shorter in 7edo than in 12edo and might be perceived.<br/>Do you mean that 7-et is boring to work with it or listening to it?</p><p>Aaron:<br/>Thanks for the word &quot;adamant&quot;, I have never heard it before. I prefer to use EDO for equal division, in the sense &quot;equal division of&quot;. So 12tet is 12edo2 or 12edo1200c, BP et scale is 13edo3, etc. In the case of octave 2:1 the number after EDO can be omitted, so we are speaking about 7edo now. I do not like the term octave in general microtonal context too. Thinking about something like &quot;modulus&quot;...</p><p>Herman:<br/>That&apos;s true. Brighter and inharmonic timbres sound less dissonant in most cases. But I like some dissonances in some kinds of music (oom-pah/blues/brass bands, etc.). All the pieces are really only sketches, many parts are improvised and recorded without any corrections, some are hard-quantised, some are step-sequenced. All rendering is done using Roland SC-55 without much care about sound colours and mix. Is it the sound or the music, which reminds you video games? Roland SC series are 80/90s synths, MT-32 was sort of PC games sound standard for some time. But I know very little about video &amp; pc games.</p><p>All:<br/>For me 7edo is something between standard diatonic and chromatic scale. Could I call it &quot;tempered diatonic scale&quot;? It has 7 steps with the same meaning as diatonic scale, all steps have equal size as in et-chromatic scale. 2nd 171.4c is between Ptolemy 2nd (11/10) and Didymus 2nd (10/9) - perfect for melodic progression. Neutral 3rd, very close to 11/9, is in between minor and major 3rd and can serve as all three ones. 4th and 5th are 16c from just, more or less dissonant but recognizable and functional.  Neutral 6th and 7th.<br/>The scale has overall neutral character (ambiguity between dur and moll). Longer melodic sequences in 2nds are wholetone-like.<br/>Since the scale has prime number of steps it has simple (complete) cycles of every interval (not only of 4ths and 5ths like 12edo), which might be used as additional feature of symmetry. The harmony differs form standard 7of12 diatonic systems.

More importantly, it is about<br/>the furthest thing possible from an industry standard. Manufacturers have ignored it, for<br/>the following reasons:</p><p>1) There are too many formats suggested so nobody can decide which one to support<br/>2) They can&apos;t figure out how to implement the format once they decide to support it<br/>3) The suggested protocols depend on sysex which is just too scary<br/>4) It&apos;s all too confusing so they throw up their hands and say forget it</p><p>What I am talking about is not the confusing plethora of stop-gap, add-on, fix-it<br/>suggestions of MTS, though I heartily applaud everyone who has fought for those changes,<br/>and I am not their enemy because we are all on the same team.

Brighter and inharmonic timbres sound less dissonant in &gt; most cases. But I like some dissonances in some kinds of music &gt; (oom-pah/blues/brass bands, etc.). All the pieces are really only &gt; sketches, many parts are improvised and recorded without any &gt; corrections, some are hard-quantised, some are step-sequenced. All &gt; rendering is done using Roland SC-55 without much care about sound &gt; colours and mix. Is it the sound or the music, which reminds you video &gt; games? Roland SC series are 80/90s synths, MT-32 was sort of PC games &gt; sound standard for some time. But I know very little about video &amp; pc games.</p><p>I was wondering if it was a Roland. We used Roland Sound Canvas sound cards (among others) at Origin back in the 90&apos;s, and the Edirol VSC which I&apos;ve used recently for some of my music is a software emulation of those. I don&apos;t know what audio technology was used in consoles like the Nintendo 64, but it must have been something similar.</p><p>Besides the timbres, some of the styles of the music reminded me of the sort of ambient background music you might find in a game. I&apos;m thinking in particular of parts like the low strings around 4:00 with the electric guitar melody that comes in around 4:30, or the brass and percussion around 8:00. Relatively sparse musical textures to create a mood while leaving space for other game sounds to be heard at the same time.</p><p>Dissonance is certainly an aspect of music that I appreciate, and sometimes a more dissonant combination of tuning and timbre fits the music better than a more pleasant one.</p></div><h3><a id=15969 href="#15969">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2007 7:51:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>All H-Pi Instruments software is cross-platform, Windows and OSX.</p><p>Until the basic MIDI spec changes, pitch bend is the most universally compatible method<br/>there is to acheive microtuning.</p><p>The problem of pitch bend could be very easily solved by making the pitch bend message<br/>a note message instead of a channel message.

OSC may be<br/>&gt; &gt; underutilized, but it&apos;s still out there, people are using it, and it<br/>&gt; &gt; ultimately offers a lot more control than MIDI in so many ways.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;ll also have a MIDI OUT jack for the old-school types. :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;aahunt@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; All H-Pi Instruments software is cross-platform, Windows and OSX.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Until the basic MIDI spec changes, pitch bend is the most<br/>&gt; &gt; universally compatible method<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there is to acheive microtuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem of pitch bend could be very easily solved by making the<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch bend message<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a note message instead of a channel message. This should have been<br/>&gt; &gt; done at the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a possible MIDI spec upgrade which will change the number<br/>&gt; &gt; of channels from 16<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to 128. Then even if pitch bending doesn&apos;t get an upgrade we are all<br/>&gt; &gt; much better off.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aaron Hunt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; H-Pi Instruments<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.h-pi.com">http://www.h-pi.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot;<br/>&lt;aahunt@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m talking about changing basic MIDI messages, changing the<br/>core<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MIDI spec to cope with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; microtuning EASILY.
