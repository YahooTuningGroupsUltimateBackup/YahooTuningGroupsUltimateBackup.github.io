One of the very few exceptions to this seems to be traditional scales like 1/4 comma mean-tone, which has both strong dyads and triads.  Mohajira and other scale systems seem to fail at this as so many of their triads are much higher odd-limit (I would still consider them good triads...but many others likely wouldn&apos;t...).</p><p>&nbsp; I also find that so long as the dyads are good and you consider more like 27-odd-limit fine for chords...you can most often get lots of &quot;good&quot; chords from most any scale with lots of good dyads.<br/> &nbsp; Although occasionally (ALA with 14TET)....the dyads almost all stink and yet they work with each other to form some amazingly good triads...although admittedly not a huge number of them (personally I find composing in 14TET or 13TET using triads to be a rather challenging task...though a very interesting one).</p><p>   But if there&apos;s a way to get strong triads without having a much lower number of chords usable that is not very closely related to 1/4 comma meantone...I&apos;m all for it!!</p></div>
