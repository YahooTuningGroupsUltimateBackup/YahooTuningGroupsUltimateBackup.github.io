It&apos;s a<br/>standalone soft synth with a really flexible tuning interface. Anyway, I<br/>recently made a couple of short experimental things with Midicode 1.20 and<br/>thought I&apos;d share them...</p><p><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example1.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example1.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example2.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example2.mp3</a></p><p>Each file is under 1MB.</p><p>These two short contrapuntal &quot;preludes&quot; use a quartet of wind type sounds<br/>and a little bit of reverb to give an organ-like effect. Created completely<br/>with Midicode 1.20, and no external or post processing. Recorded by<br/>sending Finale&apos;s &quot;play&quot; output via MidiYoke to Midicode, then recorded via<br/>CoolEdit2000. The tuning in both pieces is the Carlos Harmonic scale<br/>provided with the Midicode distribution.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/26/2003 9:51:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;A while back I probably pointed people to<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.midicode.com">http://www.midicode.com</a>.</p><p>I keep promising Peter I&apos;m going to test<br/>it out, but I can&apos;t figure out how to use<br/>the bloody thing...</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example1.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example1.mp3</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example2.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/Music/midicode-example2.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each file is under 1MB.</p><p>Man, these are awesome!!!!!

I thought Midicode was pretty easy to learn, especially for an FM<br/>instrument. Maybe Peter needs a tutorial on his web site. There are only<br/>four operators, and you can chain them together in any configuration,<br/>either as FM or AM modulators. Each operator is effectively an additive<br/>synthesizer with an overall envelope and 32 sine wave partials (plus a few<br/>presets  like triangle, saw, etc). You can use the presets, or set up your<br/>own partials.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that Midicode is pretty good at timbres that are reminiscent of<br/>organ pipes and such. As an FM instrument, it&apos;s not quite expressive<br/>enough for some things that I would want to do, but it does pretty well at<br/>others, such as organ emulation. The envelope model is one big limitation;<br/>another is lack of non-harmonic C:M ratios.</p><p>I think Midicode may be the only standalone microtonal synth that&apos;s really<br/>complete in itself -- 16 polyphonic voices, builtin mixer and effects.<br/>It&apos;s not a VST instrument, but it doesn&apos;t need to be VST because it carries<br/>everything that&apos;s needed for ensemble work. With the on-screen keyboard,<br/>you can also take it with you on your laptop and use for composing or<br/>testing on-the-go.</p><p>Re, the music itself, Carl asked:</p><p>&gt; Howabout more sticky names?</p><p>Well, these are throw-aways, really. I may put them together sometime into<br/>a larger set of short pieces, and if/when I do that, they would get more<br/>sticky names...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
