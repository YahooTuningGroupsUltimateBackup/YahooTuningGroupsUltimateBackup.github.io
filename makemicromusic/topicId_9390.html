This is good.  I get the impression<br/>that it takes a very dedicated community to maintain a wiki due to the<br/>ever-existing threat of spammers.  For this reason wikis have a sort<br/>of nerd-culture that goes with them. I&apos;m not sure we&apos;re nerdy enough<br/>as a group to make it work (!), though many of us surely are.  I just<br/>hope that it won&apos;t become the sole work of few; I really would love<br/>even more diversity of opinion than we get on here, a tall order indeed.</p><p>Speaking of diversity, the microtonal community is far from<br/>philosophically united, but if we maintain a standard of civility and<br/>address problems in similar ways to wikis that have existed for many<br/>years, I&apos;m optimistic, yea, confidant that we can make something useful.</p><p>So, Aaron and monz seem the most capable and willing to host it.  I<br/>don&apos;t know enough about web servers or whatnot to really do more<br/>research about what&apos;s best.
