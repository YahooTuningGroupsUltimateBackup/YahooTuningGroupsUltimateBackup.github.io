I suggest  try playing in all 19 keys on a mocked up sheet of paper before you finalize it. I can&apos;t tell you how many mistakes i used to do with instruments when t first made them . Some times things can not be forseen.<br/>More often than not , it is more expedient to do things your self than to rely on others. a few have made their own midi switched boards. regardless of the outcome, the attempt of say taking two cheap ones and rigging up something yourself will bring you and others closer to solving the problem for every one else.<br/>I am quite pleased with my reed organs although i much prefer to have the 2nd set of reeds at a unison than an octave. I have never heard any negative response to them in the 30 years i have used them.<br/>a likesize model of the layout of the clavichord with various scales can be found here. <a href="http://anaphoria.com/xen456.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/xen456.PDF</a></p><p>J.Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;One can have a Bosanquet with this few of notes.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A 19-tone Bosanquet MIDI keyboard?

I researched this pretty thoroughly, and<br/>although there may be one or two DIY things out there, to my<br/>knowledge none exist for sale. The reason for this is probably<br/>that such an animal (split-key / subsemitone) would have a<br/>market as large as the number of musicologist performers<br/>who are interested in playing meantone music on a MIDI<br/>keyboard, which I think effectively is Nil. The small number of<br/>performers interested in meantone music are typically<br/>also interested in acoustic instruments exactly like:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.christopherstembridge.org/cromatico.htm">http://www.christopherstembridge.org/cromatico.htm</a><br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.christopherstembridge.org/cromatico.htm">http://www.christopherstembridge.org/cromatico.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Which as far as I can tell would be the best way for you<br/>to get what you want.

Sure, 19 is altogether seductive. The thing is,<br/>considering that a product has to sell, just what number of<br/>keys, and what tuning, should a design focus on? Since<br/>there are plenty of arguments for this or that number of<br/>keys and this or that tuning, because there are many many<br/>tunings that are all attractive in their own way, there is no<br/>convincing reason to choose one over the other; enter the<br/>generalized hex keyboards.</p><p>I can speak from my own experience trying to design a<br/>keyboard with fewer keys, and trying to work with fewer<br/>keys in general, which I found ultimately a dead end. It<br/>seemed to me futile to try to decide what number of keys<br/>to choose for a design, if the number of keys would not<br/>allow all tunings to be available all at once, because with<br/>a small number of keys, the default tuning, whatever it<br/>may be, is unavoidably something of a tyranny not<br/>unlike 12ET. Sure, the tuning can change to whatever,<br/>but this confuses a lot of folks who expect _this_ key to<br/>play _that_ pitch - all the time.</p><p>As much as I admire the Fokker organ, for example,<br/>I think the obvious reason that keyboard has not been<br/>reproduced is that it is designed for one tuning only.<br/>The hex grids on the other hand let you do whatever,<br/>but for a general user, these don&apos;t have enough<br/>structure related to the traditional keyboard.<br/>(I&apos;m sure to get responses about diatonic scales here).</p><p>Anyway, considering these things led me to design<br/>something that solves the problems. The default<br/>tuning of the Tonal Plexus does not represent a new<br/>tyranny because according to the average limits of<br/>human perception it is in a practical sense all tunings<br/>at once. The structure of the keyboard is a cross<br/>between Bosanquet and Halberstadt, similar to the<br/>Fokker but solving the rising octave problem.</p><p>And, if you want 17 or 19 keys, just use the 17 or 19<br/>presets, or design your own tuning in TPXE, reorganizing<br/>the layout however you like, using as many duplicate keys<br/>as you like. Plenty of keys to return however you want.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>P.S. Actually, the Tonal Plexus has 211 keys per octave<br/>(for 205ET master tuning).</p></div><h3><a id=17612 href="#17612">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2007 8:55:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;One can have a Bosanquet with this few of notes.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A 19-tone Bosanquet MIDI keyboard?

The 7 in 19-edo is much better than in 12, although no match for 31-edo&apos;s 7.  I consider it a gain over 12-edo, yessiree. The 9 in 19-edo isn&apos;t great, but I find it tolerable, and I use it as a quasi-dissonance. If the tempo is fast, it&apos;s hard to notice.

There are actually 3 sizes, and several<br/>elevations for the buttons. It will be explained clearly with pictures<br/>and everything, but for now the gist of it is this...</p><p>As you know, 205 is not a single circle-of-fifths tuning; it&apos;s fifth is that<br/>of 41ET. And a good thing, too, since note naming can then be based<br/>on a chain of 41 fifths = 41 large commas to the octave, which<br/>are fine-tuned using 5 JNDs per step: 205 = 41 x 5.</p><p>Hence, there are 5 chains of fifths which correspond to JND fine tuning<br/>of a 41 chain. The JND fine-tunings are called inflections, and up from<br/>the bottom for each key are called double-flat, flat, natural (on the center<br/>chain of 41) sharp and double-sharp. The natural inflections have large<br/>concave buttons. The single inflections have small raised buttons,<br/>and the double inflections have medium sized slightly raised buttons.<br/>This way you can feel wherever you are on whichever inflection of the<br/>41 chain. This also more easily shows how inflections can be used as<br/>common tones when modulating, such as 11/8, 13/8, and 6/5, all<br/>appearing on the flat chain (assumuing 1/1 on the natural chain).</p><p>Hope that helps.
