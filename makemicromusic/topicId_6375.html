The list traffic has jumped way up (April more than<br/>quadrupled over March), and a lot of it is starting to get pretty<br/>theoretical and not tied to pieces or examples of music. Folks, if you&apos;re<br/>going to delve into theory and make assertions about things like Phi,<br/>please all take Margo&apos;s lead and provide an audible example.</p><p>&gt; And now McLaren has stirred up a nasty vibe at metatuning as well.</p><p>And I&apos;m wondering why the heck that keeps gets mentioned here? I can<br/>understand that Gene must be really fuming over McLaren&apos;s posts over there,<br/>but really... Why bring it here? McLaren isn&apos;t posting here, and as far as<br/>I know isn&apos;t listening here, so let&apos;s not discuss here the feud that&apos;s<br/>happening over there. People who want it can go there to get it.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
