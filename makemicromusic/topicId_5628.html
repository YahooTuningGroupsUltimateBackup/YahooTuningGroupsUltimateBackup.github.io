Well,<br/>hey,<br/>&gt;if this is the future of jazz, I&apos;ll take two, thank you! Marvelous.<br/>&gt;You must have a pack of live aliens in that dark basement. Don&apos;t turn on<br/>&gt;the lights, dude! You&apos;ll be sorry!</p><p>Thanks, though it&apos;s a closet and not a basement, and they are<br/>elves and not space aliens. But let&apos;s not quibble.</p><p>&gt;Maybe I missed all the discussion of the tuning system for this piece...?</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve been refining this adaptive tuning thing for a while,<br/>so I dont think I actually talked about details of the tuning this time<br/>around. The basic idea is to take all the notes that are sounding<br/>at any given time and to retune them so as to maximize a measure<br/>of &quot;sensory consonance,&quot; or perhaps more properly to minimize the<br/>&quot;sensory dissonance.&quot; For harmonic sounds (like most of those in<br/>&quot;excitalking,&quot;<br/>this comes down something very close to JI, but a JI in which there<br/>are no fixed pitches at all (because the pitches always wiggle around<br/>depending on what else is sounding at the time).</p><p>Of course, there are a number of practical details -- and I talk about<br/>some of these in a paper in the J. New Music Research.<br/>I&apos;ve put a version online at:<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun2002.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun2002.pdf</a></p><p>&gt;Editorial commentary... If I was going to mess with the mix &amp; balance, I<br/>&gt;might lighten up a bit on the drums. Length-wise, it needs to be<br/>stretched<br/>&gt;out about 60 minutes longer.</p><p>Seems to be pretty good agreement on lightening the drums.<br/>As for a 60 minute version! Unlikely, though I take it as a<br/>compliment...</p><p>&gt;So, when does the album come out, and where can I get it? Tower Records?</p><p>Well this piece is too new, but some of my older stuff is on<br/>the first two CDs -<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/xentone.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/xentone.html</a><br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/exo.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/exo.html</a><br/>and a bunch of mp3 excerpts at:<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html</a></p><p>So, you can get them at Amazon, but we&apos;re not at the &quot;Tower Records&quot;<br/>level yet....</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
