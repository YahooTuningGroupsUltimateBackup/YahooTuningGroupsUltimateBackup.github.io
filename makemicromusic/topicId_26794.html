I was too young to know how important that was, but I&apos;ve spent the rest of my life enjoying and being fascinated by virtually every form of music that I&apos;ve been able to find. I can&apos;t seem to stop. It spans the globe, and it spans the centuries. And it seems he was right: the only stuff I haven&apos;t liked was the other stuff.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it matters, on this list, or out in the world, exactly what it is that you like. I only think it is important that you like as much as you possibly can, and don&apos;t ever turn away from some significant music simply because you might not understand it, or haven&apos;t been exposed to it. I&apos;ll die before I&apos;ve really scratched the surface, and that gives me reason to live long.</p></div><h3>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2011 5:29:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Long years Bach was for me number 1, and I still evaluate him high<br/>after all those years of listening, studying and performing his<br/>music. But adoration? I&apos;d say not, the more I know his music and also<br/>the other music before his times and from his times. It must be said<br/>he did also lot of routine work, &quot;pop music&quot; of his times. Which<br/>still has, let&apos;s admit some standard quality, but it&apos;s nothing<br/>special if even not boring... No doubt about this, life is too short<br/>even without TV and Internet - it&apos;s impossible to write only shining<br/>great works (N.B with so much children at home, teaching and church<br/>duties), for sure he also had his bad days. But try just to copy by<br/>hand all his works by hand with a feather pen and ink, all those<br/>pages he wrote (and additionally invented as well) - you will spent<br/>probably many years just with this.</p><p>He also did many works where he just tried to imitate French, English<br/>and Italian style. For this purpose he studied, copied and let&apos;s face<br/>the truth, stole motifs, themes, harmonies, whole structures... Those<br/>times something like copyright didn&apos;t exist and lot of patterns and<br/>even melodic motifs were considered to be public domain (good example<br/>are bass patterns for variations - like Foglia, or descending<br/>chromatic scale from tonic to dominant which can be found in Italian<br/>music 100 years before Bach). And for some works Bach used music of<br/>the other composers, just rearranged it (Vivaldi and similar).</p><p>For me was very surprising to hear and study music of Dowland,<br/>Purcell, Rameau and some obscure people like Matteis, this completely<br/>changed my view of Bach from adoration to more realistic attitude. My<br/>recent discovery is Bonporti. It&apos;s just unbelievably original music,<br/>some of his works were long time considered as written by Bach,<br/>because they were found among Bach&apos;s manuscripts - until<br/>musicologists found that Bach just copied them for his study. Great<br/>story.</p><p>No doubt Bach was a genius, but after 300 years we should rank him<br/>properly.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On Mar 11, 2011, at 9:16 AM, jonszanto wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, I myself can&apos;t go down the exact same road as Aaron.

This feels more like Paul Erlich now! :)</p><p>&gt; It meant giving dissonance status equal to that of consonance. Using a<br/>&gt; tuning which very strongly favors dissonant possibilities over consonant<br/>&gt; would not be in keeping with Schoenberg&apos;s conception of the emancipation of<br/>&gt; dissonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Schoenberg did not seek the tonal implications of serialism as much as Berg<br/>did. Certain piece of Schoenberg have a more tonal feel, like the 2nd<br/>chamber symphony, nonetheless.</p><p>His conception was to chase the true abstract linearity of counterpoint, and<br/>the identity of the tone-row, freely, without regard to consonance *or*<br/>dissonance. &quot;Emancipation of dissonance&quot; really means emancipation from the<br/>concept of  dissonance or consonance, period.</p><p> Schoenberg&apos;s music is not, at least on a harmonic way of view things,<br/>structured around &quot;tension/release&quot;. Surface things may provide a semblance<br/>of them (tempo, registration, orchestration, dynmamics, etc.) but not<br/>harmonic structures, b/c outside of the row, there are no harmonic<br/>structures, and the rows are not typically structured to provide a sense of<br/>harmonic motion. They are structured to DESTROY any such implication. That&apos;s<br/>the true meaning of &quot;emancipation of dissonance&quot;. See more, below.</p><p>A tuning such as that offered by thirty-four equal divisions of the octave,<br/>&gt; which offers a plethora of possibiliites both very consonant and very<br/>&gt; dissonant, might be ideal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Irrelevant, because of the arguments above, and below....</p><p>&gt; However, &quot;34 tones related only to each other&quot; would present quite a<br/>&gt; cognitive and logistic challenge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>12-tones present a similar challenge for many, if not most, as decades and<br/>decades of flustered audiences of the 2nd Viennese school proves.</p><p>&gt; Obviously we&apos;re talking about consonance and dissonance in their brute<br/>&gt; physical forms, which can be very different in context, but remember,<br/>&gt; Schoenberg considered consonances and dissonances to be utimately rooted in<br/>&gt; the harmonic series and therefore as having a &quot;raw&quot; form as well as a<br/>&gt; contextual forms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Again, Schoenberg did not use contextual dissonance in his mature works.

Schoenberg was an intellectual who certainly<br/>had intellectual blinders on, as well as poor understanding of musical<br/>cognition. To claim, for instance, that a tone row is a recognizable musical<br/>identity in a given piece is quite a stretch. Very few rows can be so easily<br/>parsed....some examples of easily parsed ones might be 4 parallel augmented<br/>triads, like Liszt used in the &apos;Dante&apos; symphony. Of course, this was<br/>pre-serialism, and probably was not even thought of in the same terms.</p><p>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s liberation of dissonance, dissonance being in terms of<br/>&gt; harmonics simply the more complex ratios, was none other than not only<br/>&gt; including more complex ratios as the Romantics had already done, but<br/>&gt; considering them equally important to the simpler ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Depending on how one takes to mean &apos;important&apos;, this is a key statement.<br/>Schoenberg may have taken them to be &apos;equally important&apos; in an &apos;a priori&apos;<br/>way. However, to take them as equally important in their effect on the human<br/>cognitive mechanism of consonance and dissonance is another thing<br/>altogether. Which, as we know, would be a cognitive mistake. Even the simple<br/>fact that most spectra make higher partial much less significant due to<br/>lower amplitude puts this to rest.</p><p>&gt; So, not only did he precede Partch, he went beyond, for Schoenberg<br/>&gt; proposed, for example, 13:8 as equally &quot;central&quot; as say 5:4... or 2:1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Exactly...this is totally wishful thinking at best. As a dyad, 13:8 doesn&apos;t<br/>register as anything but an &quot;out of tune&quot; or approximately just shy of a<br/>quarter-tone sharp minor 6th....it only becomes something which is perceived<br/>as a &quot;locked unit&quot; if it appears in conjunction with other stronger, and<br/>similarly weak, members of the series.</p><p>&gt; Is Johnny Rheinhardt currently lurking?

But it goes even further, and sometimes he<br/>indicates he does favor dissonance; here&apos;s another quote, form an essay in<br/>1931 entitled &quot;Linear Counterpoint&quot; (pg 291-292 of &quot;Style and Idea, selected<br/>writings of Arnold Schoenberg&quot;, University of California Press, 1975):</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;....parts ought to be independent of each other even in their harmonic<br/>relationship. This means:<br/>    (a) that in sounding together they need not be related to a common<br/>harmony;<br/>    (b) that no sort of &apos;registerable&apos; harmony has to result from the way<br/>they sound together;<br/>    (c) that if possible they should produce dissonances when they sound<br/>together (to show how little they are worried)<br/>    (d) that there need be no attempy to produce harmonic _progressions_<br/>(&apos;registerable&apos;) ones, such as cadences or any other identifiable<br/>fundamental-progressions, and that such progressions are no criterion of the<br/>parts&apos; function;<br/>     (e) that so far as possible one should avoid any articulation such as<br/>can arise from the coincidence of parts in articulating &apos;steps&apos;. &quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>I draw your attention to item (c) above, which clearly and unambiguously<br/>states that Schoenberg in fact favored dissonance *over* consonance for his<br/>goals, a fact you originally denied by stating that &quot;emancipation of<br/>dissonance&quot; did not mean &quot;be as dissonant as possible&quot;.

The piano concerto no.42 from &apos;42 is a full-blown mature work, and I hear nothing &quot;baffling&quot; or &quot;confusing&quot; or anything along those lines about it. Just clear, strong, and, to use the scientific term, bitchen&apos;, music (there&apos;s a pretty darn Bartok part of it, too).</p><p>This alone sastifies me as to the quality of Arnie&apos;s understanding of musical cognition.</p><p>&gt;To claim, for instance, that a tone row is a recognizable musical<br/>&gt; identity in a given piece is quite a stretch. Very few rows can be &gt;so easily<br/>&gt; parsed....some examples of easily parsed ones might be 4 parallel &gt;augmented<br/>&gt; triads, like Liszt used in the &apos;Dante&apos; symphony. Of course, this was<br/>&gt; pre-serialism, and probably was not even thought of in the same &gt;terms.</p><p>It could be that Schoenberg made the claim that &quot;a tone row is a recognizable musical identity in a given piece&quot;, but I don&apos;t recall reading any such thing from him. What I have read is far more sensible- in Composition with Twelve Tones, he speaks of the unifying effect of the row arising from intervallic repetition, pointing out that when you&apos;ve got R, I and RI you&apos;ve got more repetition than you&apos;d expect, and each tone (of the row) is neighbored on either side<br/>by consistently the same intervals.</p><p>The error here, in my opinion, is over-identifying ascending and descending intervals. But that is beside my point, which is, where does Schoenberg make this claim?</p><p>Gotta run, back later</p><p>&gt; Depending on how one takes to mean &apos;important&apos;, this is a key &gt;statement.<br/>&gt; Schoenberg may have taken them to be &apos;equally important&apos; in an &apos;a &gt;priori&apos;<br/>&gt; way. However, to take them as equally important in their effect on the human<br/>&gt; cognitive mechanism of consonance and dissonance is another thing<br/>&gt; altogether. Which, as we know, would be a cognitive mistake. Even the simple<br/>&gt; fact that most spectra make higher partial much less significant due to<br/>&gt; lower amplitude puts this to rest.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, not only did he precede Partch, he went beyond, for Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &gt; proposed, for example, 13:8 as equally &quot;central&quot; as say 5:4... or 2:1.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly...this is totally wishful thinking at best. As a dyad, 13:8 doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; register as anything but an &quot;out of tune&quot; or approximately just shy of a<br/>&gt; quarter-tone sharp minor 6th....it only becomes something which is perceived<br/>&gt; as a &quot;locked unit&quot; if it appears in conjunction with other stronger, and<br/>&gt; similarly weak, members of the series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is Johnny Rheinhardt currently lurking? I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll recognize the simple<br/>&gt; &gt; sanity of this take on Schoenberg.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s been a long time, but I have &quot;Style and Idea&quot;, and I will peruse it for<br/>&gt; some quotes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For someone who didn&apos;t want to reveal your identity based on the fallacy of<br/>&gt; &quot;argument from authority&quot;, I&apos;m surprised you are invoking Johnny Reinhardt<br/>&gt; to come to your rescue as just such an authority. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; His conception was to chase the true abstract linearity of &gt;counterpoint,<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; the identity of the tone-row, freely, without regard to consonance &gt;*or*<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonance. &quot;Emancipation of dissonance&quot; really means emancipation &gt;from<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; concept of  dissonance or consonance, period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  A more cynical take would be that he sought to elevate sheer gesture,<br/>&gt; &gt; specifically Romantic gesture, to architectural significance. In my opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt; this is actually true to an extent, and pretty much perfectly concides in<br/>&gt; &gt; time with the painting of Janet Sobel. But I don&apos;t consider this a slight,<br/>&gt; &gt; unlike Boulez who critized the Romantic in Schoenberg. Rather I consider the<br/>&gt; &gt; elevation of gesture to structural importance an artistic achievment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s no doubt about Schoenberg&apos;s achievement, love him or hate him (I<br/>&gt; respect him highly) even though he had pretty naive ideas about human<br/>&gt; musical perception. In spite of that, he was certainly a great master, and a<br/>&gt; highly respected and influential figure, both as a revolutionary thinker and<br/>&gt; as a teacher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; A tuning such as that offered by thirty-four equal divisions of the<br/>&gt; &gt; octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which offers a plethora of possibiliites both very consonant and very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dissonant, might be ideal.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Irrelevant, because of the arguments above, and below....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not irrelevant. Schoenberg gave 53-tET the stamp of approval, how can it be<br/>&gt; &gt; irrelevant to offer 34 as an alternative?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IIRC, he gave 53 a stamp of approval, only to later argue against its<br/>&gt; practicality. The same argument was made by Hindemith, I believe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, &quot;34 tones related only to each other&quot; would present quite a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cognitive and logistic challenge.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-tones present a similar challenge for many, if not most, as &gt;decades<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; decades of flustered audiences of the 2nd Viennese school proves.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a cliche, valid only for a small group of people hysterically<br/>&gt; &gt; clinging to cliched thinking. Countless millions have for decades parsed<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenbergian &quot;dissonance&quot; in movie soundtracks, effortlessly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two things going on here, we&apos;re not quite talking about the same thing:<br/>&gt; there&apos;s 1) parsing &quot;dissonance&quot; and 2) parsing the &quot;tone row&quot;. I was<br/>&gt; referring to the latter, which is claimed to be an important structural<br/>&gt; element that is *audible*. Sure, Pierre Boulez can probably parse 12-tone<br/>&gt; rows and all their permutations, but your average audience member, even<br/>&gt; studied musicians, will not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And &quot;dissonance&quot; in movie soundtracks is irrelevant to the discussion as I<br/>&gt; see it, although I concede it&apos;s an interesting contextual dichotomy that<br/>&gt; what people &quot;accept&quot; when there are scary things going on on the big screen<br/>&gt; is out-of-sync with what they &quot;accept&quot; without a programmatic narrative...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, Schoenberg did not use contextual dissonance in his mature &gt;works.<br/>&gt; &gt; He<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; may have had surface gestures which did mimic things like &gt;non-harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; appogiaturas, but they didn&apos;t form &quot;tension-release&quot; dualities &gt;against<br/>&gt; &gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; background harmony. It would be a mistake to think so. There are no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord-progressions here.....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Again, Schoenberg considered &quot;dissonances&quot; as simply entities coming from<br/>&gt; &gt; higher in the harmonic series. More complex ratios. You would maintain that<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg did not use more complex ratios, even after he said he did, and<br/>&gt; &gt; everyone can hear, at least in a sensitive orchestral performance, plain as<br/>&gt; &gt; day that he does?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point is, sure, one can consider them more &quot;complex ratios&quot;, but that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t still help the case, because these ratios go above and beyond what<br/>&gt; people would parse as meaningful in any context other than the creation of a<br/>&gt; subjective sense of tension and/or chaos, even though that tension and/or<br/>&gt; chaos may have a highly organized underlying intellectual order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The argument of course being that what comes across louder and clearer than<br/>&gt; anything is the feeling of tension and/or chaos. The 2nd Viennese school is<br/>&gt; largely successful as being able to capture a sense of anxiety, neurosis,<br/>&gt; and hysteria that seemed to grip &quot;Fin du Siecle&quot; Viennese thought in<br/>&gt; general, as exemplified in the visual arts by expressionists such as Egon<br/>&gt; Schiele.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And, of course, Schoenberg and serialism are not one and the same thing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 11-edo and 13-edo surely are dynamite pitch fields for all kinds of<br/>&gt; &gt; serial<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and set manipulations.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed, you bet! :)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Well we certainly agree there.

So we were both<br/>incomplete in our assessment....the naive view that he wanted to make things<br/>&quot;as dissonant as possible&quot; is actually, judging from his written words on<br/>the subject and also the type of textures he wrote, closest to the truth.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, according to him, the chromaticism of the Romantics was<br/>&gt; simply<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the regular inclusion of higher partials into Western music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Whether or not he did may be beside the point, considering the &gt;insights<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; cognitive perception of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Schoenberg was an intellectual who certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; had intellectual blinders on, as well as poor understanding of &gt;musical<br/>&gt; &gt; cognition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is one and only one demonstration of true understanding of musical<br/>&gt; cognition: good original composition. The piano concerto no.42 from &apos;42 is a<br/>&gt; full-blown mature work, and I hear nothing &quot;baffling&quot; or &quot;confusing&quot; or<br/>&gt; anything along those lines about it. Just clear, strong, and, to use the<br/>&gt; scientific term, bitchen&apos;, music (there&apos;s a pretty darn Bartok part of it,<br/>&gt; too).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This alone sastifies me as to the quality of Arnie&apos;s understanding of<br/>&gt; musical cognition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>This of course, is entirely subjective, and you are in a vast minority here.<br/>His output is uneven in this regard---some works are denser and harder to<br/>parse than others, for sure. Look at the difference in the two chamber<br/>symphonies! The 2nd one is a sort of &apos;return to tonality&apos;</p><p>My own take is that the mature serial pieces of Schoenberg are masterfully<br/>constructed, but until you have many repeated listens they are homogeneous<br/>in their anxious character....and not my favorite listening. I don&apos;t often<br/>say to myself &quot;gotta hear some Arnie&quot;, but that kind of thing shifts for me<br/>and different composers come into the foreground while others recede.</p><p>Elsewhere, Schoenberg writes about his lack of use of repetition, stating a<br/>preference for continuing variation. He never really justifies this, and<br/>even acknowledges the importance of repetition for cognitive grasping. It&apos;s<br/>as if he just stubbornly wants to not repeat because it &quot;hasn&apos;t been<br/>done&quot;....this is a composer extremely self-aware of how he is perceived in<br/>the fabric of musical history, wanting to put as many notches in his belt as<br/>he can that read &quot;no one before me did this&quot;</p><p>&gt;To claim, for instance, that a tone row is a recognizable musical<br/>&gt; &gt; identity in a given piece is quite a stretch. Very few rows can be &gt;so<br/>&gt; easily<br/>&gt; &gt; parsed....some examples of easily parsed ones might be 4 parallel<br/>&gt; &gt;augmented<br/>&gt; &gt; triads, like Liszt used in the &apos;Dante&apos; symphony. Of course, this was<br/>&gt; &gt; pre-serialism, and probably was not even thought of in the same &gt;terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It could be that Schoenberg made the claim that &quot;a tone row is a<br/>&gt; recognizable musical identity in a given piece&quot;, but I don&apos;t recall reading<br/>&gt; any such thing from him. What I have read is far more sensible- in<br/>&gt; Composition with Twelve Tones, he speaks of the unifying effect of the row<br/>&gt; arising from intervallic repetition, pointing out that when you&apos;ve got R, I<br/>&gt; and RI you&apos;ve got more repetition than you&apos;d expect, and each tone (of the<br/>&gt; row) is neighbored on either side<br/>&gt; by consistently the same intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The error here, in my opinion, is over-identifying ascending and descending<br/>&gt; intervals. But that is beside my point, which is, where does Schoenberg make<br/>&gt; this claim?<br/>&gt;</p><p>In Twelve-Tone composition, the same 1923 essay, the last paragraph reads:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot; In twelve-tone composition the matter under discussion is in fact the<br/>succession of tones mentioned, whose comprehensibility as a musical idea is<br/>independent of whether its components are made audible one after the other<br/>or more or less simultaneously. But perhaps (or even, certainly) the further<br/>development and the tempo of the presentation depend on whether in its first<br/>form it was sufficiently comprehensible, or, on the contrary, whether it was<br/>perhaps too comprehensible (laws of popular expression!) &quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>It does appear that he concedes that a row can be both opaque and<br/>transparent. The transparent examples are few and far between though.</p><p>Throughout his writings, Schoenberg is obsessed with the idea of unity in<br/>general, and there are passages that show some god-awful reasoning processes<br/>to justify how one theme from a work is &apos;derived&apos; from another. In<br/>particular, there is one example where he discusses almost destroying a 2nd<br/>theme from the 1st Kammer-Symphonie bc it didn&apos;t appear to be derived from<br/>the 1st main theme; however, the reasoning that the two are related is very<br/>Procrustean at best. He does so by a pseudo-Schenkerian analysis (while<br/>ironically, elsewhere showering contempt upon Schenker), including making<br/>weak-beat notes of the 2nd theme &quot;True principal tones&quot; so as to show how<br/>the first and 2nd themes are related by inversion and an obvious omission of<br/>notes. Indeed, you are left impressed with the idea, after a careful<br/>reading, that Arnie could demonstrate that he could relate his entire output<br/>to &quot;Frere Jacques&quot; by a repeated process of &quot;inversion and omission&quot;....</p><p>AKJ</p><p>&gt; Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I never said Schoenberg &gt;didn&apos;t talk<br/>&gt; about the harmonic series.

So we were both<br/>&gt; incomplete in our assessment....the naive view that he wanted to &gt;make things<br/>&gt; &quot;as dissonant as possible&quot; is actually, judging from his written &gt;words on<br/>&gt; the subject and also the type of textures he wrote, closest to the &gt;truth.</p><p>Not ignoring your quotes.

The 11-edo piece I did uses 9:7 as the simplest central ratio and seems to be  pretty, pleasant and downright catchy to &quot;civilians&quot;.</p><p>We were talking about tunings. Whether or not a tone row is comprehesible as such is an interesting topic, but it is a tangent. You are trying to use this, which I don&apos;t think Schoenberg ever even claimed, as an argument to discredit Schoenberg&apos;s theories.

I gave you<br/>all the relevant quotes.</p><p>I mean, I gave about 3 or 4 direct source quotes from the man himself.

I mentioned &quot;emancipation of the dissonance&quot;<br/>2) You said &quot;emancipation of the dissonance&quot; is not about &quot;being as<br/>dissonant as possible&quot;<br/>3) I said it didn&apos;t matter since Schoenberg didn&apos;t worry about consonance<br/>and dissonance in the traditional sense, only about row structure and<br/>identity.<br/>4) You then started claiming that I missed the point, and that it was about<br/>overtones. Which was and is completely moot.<br/>5) I then gave you a series of direct quotes which backed up my points about<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s conception of serialism, including a quote which suggested that<br/>he did favor &quot;being as dissonant as possible&quot; by favoring dissonant<br/>harmonies in simultaneous tones.<br/>6) You then again claimed I was missing the point, and that it was about<br/>overtones. Again, not listening to what I was saying, what Schoenberg<br/>himself was saying, or even what you were saying, and now having a<br/>completely orthogonal conversation.<br/>7) Exasperated, I re-quoted Schoenberg.<br/>8) Exasperated, you said it was about higher overtones.<br/>9) Here we are, and you still haven&apos;t realized that Schoenberg didn&apos;t<br/>consider harmony when he wrote serial row music. And that he favored<br/>dissonances to show &quot;that the voices didn&apos;t care&quot; (direct quote), etc. You<br/>are still pointing out 13/8, 11/8, etc. Why?</p><p>In short, I don&apos;t see what your point is. I was only trying to point out<br/>that 11-edo and 13-edo are perfect for abolishing, in the Schoenbergian<br/>sense, traditional associations. Period. And that idea still stands, and in<br/>essence, I don&apos;t see why you are huffing and puffing about anything, since<br/>you seem to agree with me about this basic point.</p><p>You can chase your tail all you want talking about other moot things, but I<br/>will simply re-post all these points, which are *Schoenberg&apos;s own words*,<br/>until you see what I&apos;ve (he has) been saying....</p><p>Also, I stand corrected---you did mention &quot;Probleme der Harmonie&quot; in the<br/>first episode way back, before this thread really got going. :)</p><p>I also said you were ignoring my direct Schoenberg quotes...you now say:</p><p>&quot;Not ignoring your quotes. Trying to explain to you the nature of what<br/>Schoenberg meant by dissonance.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m baffled why you think I&apos;d take your words over his own words, especially<br/>when they are in direct contradiction at times. I agree with you what he<br/>meant by dissonance---higher partials. But so what? How are they used? This<br/>is where you say it would be meaningless to consider a tuning that had no<br/>consonances. I&apos;m showing you it wouldn&apos;t be meaningless, because Schoenberg<br/>didn&apos;t find the distinction between consonance and dissonance important to<br/>his process, and furthermore, he favored dissonance.</p><p>Best,<br/>AKJ</p><p>On Thu, Mar 17, 2011 at 11:00 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lobawad,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Thu, Mar 17, 2011 at 10:54 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Man kann nun sagen, und kann diesen Satz ziemlich weitgehend erproben<br/>&gt; und<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; beweisen, dass alle musikalischen Geschehnisse sich auf die<br/>&gt; Obertonreihe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; zurueckfuehren lassen, so dass alles sich darstellt als Ausnuetzung<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; eifacherer un komplizierterer Verhaeltnisse dieser Reihe.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Followed by a &quot;13-limit JI&quot; structure, you can make a JI diagram from<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I already said where to find this stuff- Probleme der Harmonie, 1927.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is the first time in this thread you mentioned &quot;Probleme der<br/>&gt; Harmonie&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No it is not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/26889">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/26889</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; But more to the point--you are ignoring my quotes which are direct<br/>&gt; &gt;evidence<br/>&gt; &gt; that Schoenberg considered consciously used dissonance &quot;to show how<br/>&gt; &gt;little<br/>&gt; &gt; the lines are worried&quot;.....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, I think you could have at least translated to English for &gt;me...this<br/>&gt; &gt; passage doesn&apos;t really tell us anything. I never said Schoenberg &gt;didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; talk<br/>&gt; &gt; about the harmonic series. I said that his use of consonance and<br/>&gt; &gt;dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt; was such that the distinction between them was irrelevant, and in &gt;fact,<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; we are discovering, he actually favored dissonance. So we were both<br/>&gt; &gt; incomplete in our assessment....the naive view that he wanted to &gt;make<br/>&gt; things<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;as dissonant as possible&quot; is actually, judging from his written &gt;words<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; the subject and also the type of textures he wrote, closest to the<br/>&gt; &gt;truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not ignoring your quotes. Trying to explain to you the nature of what<br/>&gt; Schoenberg meant by dissonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And he was correct in proposing that ratios from higher in the harmonic<br/>&gt; series can be implemented as &quot;central&quot; ratios. The 11-edo piece I did uses<br/>&gt; 9:7 as the simplest central ratio and seems to be  pretty, pleasant and<br/>&gt; downright catchy to &quot;civilians&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We were talking about tunings. Whether or not a tone row is comprehesible<br/>&gt; as such is an interesting topic, but it is a tangent. You are trying to use<br/>&gt; this, which I don&apos;t think Schoenberg ever even claimed, as an argument to<br/>&gt; discredit Schoenberg&apos;s theories. Bogus approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The tuning ideas in question can be tested.
