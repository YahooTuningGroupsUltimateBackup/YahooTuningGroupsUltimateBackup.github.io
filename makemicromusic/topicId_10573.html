I&apos;ve heard everything from &quot;I like<br/>tape music concerts.  The lights go dim, there&apos;s no visual distractions,<br/>and it&apos;s just me and the music and I can really focus in on it&quot;  to<br/>the opposite point of view  &quot;Tape music concerts suck!!!  I can&apos;t stand<br/>them!!!  Get some performers,  get some dancers,  this is boring; if I<br/>wanted to do this I&apos;d just listen to a CD in my living room!!  And what<br/>could be more @#$%@#$% ridiculous than applauding a pair of<br/>speakers?!?!?!&quot;</p><p>I can see both points of view.  I would say that whether people &quot;start<br/>chatting&quot; or not depends more on the venue than whether or not you&apos;re<br/>playing tape music:  if a concert was in a brewery,  I&apos;m guessing people<br/>would chat away, whether you&apos;re just playing CDs, or you&apos;ve got a DJ doing<br/>all kinds of funky @#$% @#$%@#$%.  As a composer,  you&apos;d want to to keep<br/>that in mind:  it&apos;s a compositional constraint,  as it were.  The usual<br/>solution is to turn the volume way up so that any &quot;chatting&quot; is more like<br/>screaming,  which adds to the fun fun fun &quot;we&apos;re all going to get laid<br/>tonight&quot; vibe that everyone seems to love about loud bars.   The good<br/>news is that in this kind of venue,  people don&apos;t usually have the sorts<br/>of virulent complaints I outline above.  On the other hand,  when I&apos;ve<br/>done concerts in a &quot;concert hall&quot;,  people are usually attentive,  and<br/>even if they hate it,  they don&apos;t &quot;chat&quot;.</p><p>(And by the way:  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessarily bad that music is a<br/>background ambient thing.  Many great pieces were written for that<br/>purpose:  virtually all early operas,  Mozart divertimenti and such, and<br/>so on.  the idea of &quot;being attentive&quot;  only came into being relatively<br/>recently.  And I like the idea of having fun chatting with my friends,<br/>then once in a while noticing,  hey this music in the background is groovy<br/>stuff!)</p><p>It&apos;s true that multi-channel stuff is great;  I just got back from a<br/>festival in Montreal of 8-channel music  (where I had a 19tet piece<br/>played, incidentally).  That was a lot of fun.  In that case,  there&apos;s<br/>more of a &quot;reason&quot; to have a &quot;tape&quot; music concert, since most people don&apos;t<br/>have a 16-, 10-, 8-, or even 4-  channel speaker setup in their home.  So<br/>it&apos;s not something they could just do in their living room.  On the other<br/>hand,  8- speakers can involve moving and renting expenses,  etc. etc.</p><p>In any case,  I think what has worked pretty well, is to have variety on a<br/>program,  especially in a concert hall:  &quot;tape&quot; music interspersed with<br/>works with dancers,  or works with video,  or works with live instruments<br/>and electronics,  or what-have-you.   With some wicked installations just<br/>out in the lobby.</p><p>Personally,  I think that really long concerts of stereo tape music are<br/>bad, generally speaking,  but I think the genre has it&apos;s good points (see<br/>above), and I don&apos;t support trashing it altogether.  In a similar<br/>fashion to the way that we don&apos;t want to throw out all of the vintage<br/>analog synths just because there&apos;s digital now.</p><p>CB</p></div><h3><a id=10578 href="#10578">ðŸ”—</a>ambassadorbob &#x3C;petesfriedclams@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2005 12:54:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Playing &quot;tapes&quot; can be OK, I think.
