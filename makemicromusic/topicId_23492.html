Yes. Would definitely make a great bass. Definitely can be bowed.

You are correct in assuming that the filament crosses the internal empty space of the tube and therefore exerts a force that tries to squash the tube into an elliptical cross-section</p><p>Yes, your lacing scheme would eliminate the tendency to go elliptical while retaining fret illumination (although it may be reduced). But I can&apos;t see any easy way to actually thread it up.</p><p>Threading up the frets on a choob is currently done without using any tools inside the tube. It is done by cutting a chisel tip on the end of the monofilament, taking the roll-curl out of the first 70 mm or so by counter-bending so it effectively becomes its own needle, having the holes angled toward each other, sighting down the inside of the tube, pushing the fretline in through one hole, shining a small flashlight through the hole you&apos;re aiming for and &quot;homing in on the beam&quot;.</p><p>Threading up fretlets requires a lacing pattern to be drawn up in advance, that results in the fretine going internally between points having the maximum angle between them, and angling the holes accordingly. Any internal hop should preferably subtend 90 degrees or more (so no hole needs to be angled more than 45 degrees).</p><p>Whitney mark-I was made from PVC as were the choobs before her. But they were all 12 frets per octave (12-FPO) (although not 12-equal after the first). With 22 frets to the octave, the PVC Whitney became unplayable within only 3 months due to going elliptical near the middle. When this happened I reviewed the literature on plastic creep and learned that creep rate was typically proportional to the fourth power (or more)! of the stress.</p><p>I then compared the creep rate of the 22-FPO choob with that of a 12-FPO choob that had been fretted for about a year and found indeed a power of 4.3 relationship. So while the 22-FPO PVC tube remained playable for only 3 months, a 12-FPO PVC choob should remain playable for more than 3 years. Temperature has a significant effect too. The creep rate approximately doubles with every 10&deg;C rise in temperature.</p><p>Carl then suggested a fret lacing scheme where the frets still wrapped around 180 degres on the outside of the choob, but with every second fret rotated 90 degrees (+-45 degrees). This would have halved the stress in any one direction, and so reduced the creep rate back to 12-FPO proportions. But there are aesthetic issues with this, and Carl also convinced me to use Carbon-fibre/epoxy tube, which we hope has eliminated the problem by having creep rates several orders of magnitude lower than PVC.</p><p>But for use with the lower-cost PVC or ABS there are a number of such lacing schemes whereby the stresses are spread more evenly, without violating the 90 degree minimum internal hop rule. Basically you want a scheme where, when you look down the inside of the tube, you see either a cross (like a plus sign) or a square, or an equilateral triangle.</p><p>-- Dave</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ixlramp&quot; &lt;ixlramp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t explain my idea well, sorry.
