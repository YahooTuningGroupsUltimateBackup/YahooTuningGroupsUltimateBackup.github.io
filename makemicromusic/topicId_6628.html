Fourth Street (between Washington<br/>Square East and Greene Street).</p><p>We will be featuring tenor Paul Sperry in the jazz-hued, French-<br/>influenced, Five Songs by the early 20th-century American composer<br/>Theodore Chanler, as well as Leonard Lehrman&apos;s Five Duets for soprano<br/>Helene Williams, tenor and piano which explore the range of Lehrman&apos;s<br/>expressive language. &quot;I Went Looking For My Soul,&quot; #3 of the 5 duets,<br/>based on a poem by Charles Bernstein, will receive its world<br/>premiere.</p><p>Composer John Eaton will be in the audience for his Fantasy Romance<br/>for cello and piano as rendered by Jeffrey Shaw, cello and Paul<br/>Hoffmann, piano.  Eaton, recipient of the 1990 MacArthur &quot;genius&quot;<br/>award is a master and pioneer of the use of microtones, and here,<br/>like a living genie, he integrates them into a mysterious and<br/>arresting musical fabric.</p><p>Clarinetist Esther Lamneck will showcase a new piece by Patrick<br/>Hardish for solo clarinet, Sonorities VII, one in his continuing<br/>series of reflections on the sound possibilities and distinctive<br/>timbres of individual instruments.</p><p>Composers Concordance mentor and advisor, the distinguished American<br/>composer Otto Luening, will be remembered through his famous<br/>electronic piece Gargoyles, for violin and tape, performed by the<br/>masterful new music enthusiast, violinist Lynn Bechtold, with audio<br/>support by Luening disciple, composer Dan Cooper.  A mainstay of<br/>the &quot;classical electronic&quot; literature, Gargoyles evidences Luening&apos;s<br/>concern with taking traditional forms and instruments into the &quot;space<br/>ageÂ…&quot;</p><p>Continuing our new electronic directions in sound, percussionist-<br/>composer Tom Beyer will premiere a piece RE  which explores his<br/>mastery of the electronic idiom while showing his performing prowess<br/>as percussionist.</p><p>And, the percussion/electronic theme will continue, as vibraphonist<br/>extraordinaire, Peter Jarvis,  propels his mallets into a new work by<br/>Art Krieger, Rainsticks for vibraphone and recording.  Krieger is the<br/>man known for bringing the Jamaican &quot;pan&quot; into the contemporary music<br/>literature.</p><p>The concert will conclude with William Anderson&apos;s Sometimes for solo<br/>vibraphone, a challenging work written expressly for Jarvis with many<br/>varied meters and moods.</p><p>Tickets are $15, $10 students and seniors, TDF accepted.
