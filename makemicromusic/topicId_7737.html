InTun just can&apos;t handle it, and<br/>after examining the MIDI output, its easy to see I need more than 16<br/>channels to handle microtuning such a heavily pedalled work.  (I piped<br/>the MIDI output from MidiOX to Cakewalk to see the output).</p><p>What are my options?  I started looking at Csound, but the SoundFont<br/>support seems a bit flaky and I can&apos;t find any examples.  Should I try<br/>and make a 19ET SoundFont?

Even big 12 note clusters won&apos;t do it.</p><p>You would need to sustain a chord<br/>with more than 15 distinct 19-et scale degrees in it.<br/>Notes the same pitch but in distinct octaves will have<br/>the same pitch bend, so can be played in the same channels.</p><p>The way I do it in FTS, then notes get played on the same<br/>channel as earlier played notes if they require the same<br/>pitch bend. Then if a new pitch bend is ever needed<br/>then the channel with the oldest applied pitch bend<br/>gets all its notes switched off - or the channel<br/>with the longest ago switched off or switched on<br/>note.</p><p>If it happens with nots that use 15 or less<br/>scale degrees then it is certainly technically<br/>possible, and it just depends on the particular<br/>implementation of the channel remapping.</p><p>For instance very early versions of FTS (1.082 or earlier)<br/>used a less efficient algorithm and had more switched<br/>off notes in this situation.</p><p>If one does have huge block chords sustained<br/>and it happens, then the solution if restricted<br/>to the channel pitch bends method is to<br/>split your recording into e.g. notes<br/>above and below middle C, realise each<br/>part separately, and then combine them<br/>to make the mp3. I haven&apos;t needed to do that<br/>in my own pieces which are usually small<br/>chamber music type things with few notes, and<br/>the fractal tunes are also generally not<br/>very demanding on the numbers of channels,but I know<br/>that many FTS users work in that way.</p><p>You also need to work that way if using the<br/>pitch bends technique e.g. to work up<br/>an orchestral mp3 with the instruments<br/>all at different pan positions and with<br/>a lot of polyphony in each instrument<br/>with each one playing several pitch bends<br/>at once.</p><p>BTW do you know the Giga piano patch?</p><p><a href="http://www.tascamgiga.com/sounds/gpiano.html">http://www.tascamgiga.com/sounds/gpiano.html</a></p><p>It only needs the lite version of Giga to be played<br/>- and you sometimes get that version<br/>bundled with a soundcard.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7739 href="#7739">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

You just need to assign a different pitch bend to<br/>each midi channel corresponding to the accidentals you need for your piece. Then play your notes on the appropriate channel, e.g.<br/>all the Cs on channel 1, C#s on channel 2, Dbs on channel 3 and so on, and then overlay all those different parts to make your<br/>score, so you can even put them all onto a single staff too.</p><p>In 19-et you just need to leave out four notes in your piece, and you can play it this way and you don&apos;t need to use any channel<br/>remapping software.

Where, for instance, do the sound &gt;samples come from? How hard is it to deal with sfz format?</p><p>I need to start by pointing out a confusion that has already arisen: there are two apps in discussion here:</p><p>sfz+ (and the less robust, but free, sfz): a soundfont/wave player<br/>z3ta+ : a waveform-based synthesis engine instrument</p><p>I *don&apos;t* use the former (currently), but find it a very good soundfont frontend for playing. I *do* use the latter all the time - it is one of my two favorite and near constant working tools, the other being VirSyn Tera. I HIGHLY suggest anyone who is used to using soundfont players to try the free, or try the demo of the more robust sfz, and see for themselves. Gene, I say the following in the most benign possible way: I use these instruments for &apos;live&apos; composing/playing, meaning that I play them from a keyboard. Many of the attributes I like that shake out from that come from whatever expressivity I can get through playing; I am certain that if one simply wants soundfonts for rendering, it is less an issue. However, if one uses a common DAW to create their music (like Cubase, Sonar, Logic, etc.) these are great, as you load them up and record your part, and then use them as a playback instrument.</p><p>For the sfz instrument, I really would take a look at both the info/documentation available at the rgc:audio site, as well as the kvr forum - there have been extensive threads on the sfz file format (a bulked up description for soundfont layout) and other performance issues.</p><p>I play a lot with the z3ta+ because:</p><p>1. it will work with any .scl file I load in, also allowing me to have multiple instances of the instrument with differing tunings (if I wish)</p><p>2. it is flexible, extremely deep in both concept and execution, and there are a lot of people using it and coming up with new patches all the time. About 6 months after I got it someone came out with 2 new banks of 128 patches, and they were so good it almost seemed like a new instrument; this is just to show how much there is to explore on it.</p><p>The z3 (to be short) also is one of the first instruments I know of to include the Hermode tuning system, which can be turned on at will. *I* haven&apos;t used it yet, but it is there (again, all of this can be tested *fully* in the demo, the only limitation being that the sound drops out every so often. It is hardly even cripple-ware!). It utilizes either direct synthesis or a selection of waveforms to generate the sound, and there is now facility for user waveforms, something I haven&apos;t toyed with.</p><p>z3 matches up well with my tastes and interests - very deep evolving pads, great low-end sounds, good variety that is easy to tweak or come up from scratch, and a lot of modulation (huge, in fact) to affect the sound more if you wish. If one wants to dedicate effects to the instrument instead of later in the mix, the effects section is well appointed. And the icing on the cake is that the gui is one of the best ever, using only two screens and quite accessible, not to mention that all the controls have midi learning capability (meaning that I can assign the soft sliders and pots on my controller to any of them).</p><p>Tera is... just very different, and a great counterpart.
