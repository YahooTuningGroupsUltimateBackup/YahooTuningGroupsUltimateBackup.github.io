I actually read the score before I had a chance to listen to the music and I was surprised by just how slowly you performed it :). I hope you will keep posting music and scores on your website.</p><p>I think the violin is an ideal instrument for JI music. When I manage to tune the strings to very accurate 2:3 fifths it is almost like the violin is helping me find those JI intervals and make them sing! And the ghost fundamentals are clearly audible to the player. It is easy to tell if you are playing something inharmonic or something in tune. Unfortunately I still produce a lot of the former by mistake but it is getting better.</p><p>If I compose something for the violin I will let you know. I live in DE by the way.</p><p>It must have been inspiring to work with a JI master like Kyle Gann. He is my personal JI hero!</p><p>Best regards,<br/>Magnus Jonsson<br/><a href="http://hcoop.net/~magnus/music/">http://hcoop.net/~magnus/music/</a></p><p>On Sun, 6 May 2007, jim altieri wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;  I&apos;m new to this group and I just wanted to say a quick hi.

And it sounded right - that&apos;s the way it should be. I wonder if she was aware that she did it or if she simply adjusted naturally. Either way she was a great singer.

I will listen to it when I get home. Meanwhile let me clarify a little what I meant: If you take time to tune your fifths very carefully then all the other JI intervals will be easier to play too, as if the instrument guides you to find them. It may just be an effect of everything being consistent but also I keep thinking that even individual notes and double stops sound sweeter when the unbowed strings are well tuned.</p><p>On Fri, 11 May 2007, jim altieri wrote:</p><p>&gt; Word to that.
