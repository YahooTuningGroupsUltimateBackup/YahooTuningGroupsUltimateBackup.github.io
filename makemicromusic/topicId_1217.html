Eventually I settled on a scheme where<br/>I break the sound into two parts, the attack portion and the sustain<br/>portion (I am helped in this division because many samplers have<br/>a &quot;loop&quot; portion which is inherently the sustained part - what comes<br/>before the loop is then, by default, the attack.)<br/>Then I map both the sustain and the attack separately, and<br/>&quot;paste&quot; them back together manually... also, the loop portion<br/>inevitably needs to be re-looped (another manual operation).</p><p>&gt;If you are leaving the attack transients unaltered, how many<br/>&gt;milliseconds do you typically leave unchanged?</p><p>The attack varies by sound, and is anywhere from a few milliseconds<br/>to maybe 30 or 40 for some sounds. However, I dont leave the<br/>attacks unaltered... the reason for this is that mapping<br/>the spectra of the attacks (as well as the sustained portion)<br/>makes it easier to paste the sound back together... leaving the<br/>attacks unaltered often makes for an awkward (i.e., noticeable)<br/>transition between attack and loop.</p><p>&gt;How do you deal with mapping a more complex sound - such as a gong -<br/>&gt;where there may typically be clusters of frequencies close together?</p><p>This really depends on what the goal is... for instance,<br/>I have a bunch of cymbal hits that I mapped into harmonic sounds.<br/>The procedure was to identify the largest 20-30 peaks<br/>in the spectrum, and to then map these to the &quot;nearest&quot;<br/>harmonic template. The mapping procedure<br/>was the same as before, but the overall changes were much more<br/>dramatic since the partials moved a lot further, on average.<br/>Maybe I&apos;ll post that piece next - for the most part you&apos;d never<br/>suspect that the sounds all began life as cymbal hits.</p><p>But this is what I mean by the goal - sometimes, like when doing the<br/>mapping into 19-tet or 10-tet, the goal is to make sounds that<br/>individually remain more-or-less unchanged (as much as possible,<br/>anyway) yet fit together nicely in alternative tuning systems.<br/>When doing more severe mappings, the sound quality will/does<br/>change... most likely mapping things like gongs into a prespecified<br/>system will entail large motion of the paritals and hence<br/>significant changes in the sound...</p><p>&gt;I always have loved your use of portamento in your tunes.</p><p>Thanks... I&apos;ll bet this comes from my &quot;heritage&quot; as a guitar<br/>player... potamento is the synth version of bending strings.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
