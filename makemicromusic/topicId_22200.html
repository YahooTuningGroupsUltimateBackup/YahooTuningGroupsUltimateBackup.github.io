Found a bunch, suprisingly accurate. It&apos;s easy to tell if they&apos;re right on using drone/pedal electronic backing tracks, because they do the proper (not)beating and difference tones things. Speed is another matter....</p><p>Cross-posted at Xeno&apos;s pad</p></div><h3><a id=22207 href="#22207">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>4/2/2010 7:33:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Cameron,</p><p>You asked about playing microtones on wind instruments, and yes, there were<br/> a number of different charts produced in PITCH I:4, along with a list of<br/>previously published charts constituting a &quot;fingerography.&quot;</p><p>Retuning on bassoon is my best expertise.  26 keys and 5 tone holes  make<br/>for lots of shading with fingers, much better than changing embouchure for<br/>each note!   Scotch tape can either shorten a tone hole, or further<br/>&quot;depress&quot; a key so that it hovers closer to a tone hole, and is therefore  flatter<br/>than usual.</p><p>Flutes have the most opportunity to change pitch by embouchure, and they<br/>are more limited in terms of keys.  Oboes work well with scotch tape to<br/>preposition the instrument into an intonational plan.    Unique  fingerings seem<br/>always preferable to shifts in embourchure, if only  because normal musical<br/>speed makes mouth shifts unmanageable.</p><p>The clarinet players use mainly fingerings, and they can be very  exact.<br/>My favorite taragoto player plays wild style.  It has not been  sufficiently<br/>mapped, as compared with other woodwinds.  The contrabassoon  is all keys,<br/>severely handicapping  the use of shading.   However, the tape technique<br/>worked great when I played the contra (and bassoon)  parts in the Charles Ives<br/>&quot;Universe Symphony.&quot;</p><p>Recorders (flute a bec) are great for the use of scotch tape to set<br/>temperaments.  I&apos;m using it now to sing Vicentino.  Bagpipes also work  well with<br/>tape changes to the changer.  (beats the use of bees wax!)</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard (AFMM)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=22209 href="#22209">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2010 9:21:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Cameron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You asked about playing microtones on wind instruments, and yes, &gt;there were<br/>&gt;  a number of different charts produced in PITCH I:4, along with a &gt;list of<br/>&gt; previously published charts constituting a &quot;fingerography.&quot;</p><p>Great- where can I get this &quot;PITCH I:4&quot;?

I can do more with the embouhure on a sax than a clarinet, I think that&apos;s generally true of saxophones compared to clarinets and the tarogoto seems more sax-like.</p><p>&gt; Recorders (flute a bec) are great for the use of scotch tape to &gt;set<br/>&gt; temperaments.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m using it now to sing Vicentino.  Bagpipes also &gt;work  well with<br/>&gt; tape changes to the changer.  (beats the use of bees wax!)</p><p>Thanks for the scotch tape idea, have to try that. Ever thought of<br/>drilling extra holes in say a clarinet? I can&apos;t spare the dough<br/>even for a spare e-bay junker instrument so it&apos;s probably not going to happen here anytime soon.</p><p>But it seems like a plausible approach. Hm, maybe an inexpensive bamboo flute.</p><p>By sheer coincidence (really- it&apos;s just chance that I&apos;ve been concentrating on clarinet microtones recently) Ferus Mustafov, famous Macedonian Gypsy sax and clarinet player, is practicing 10 feet from me, he has a concert at our art institution tomorrow. He does that liquid Balkan thing, you know which kind I mean. He&apos;s superb of course but I&apos;m interested things like Greek enharmonic tetrachords played slow and sustained. So finding fingerings it is.</p><p>Hm, sustained unisons over the drone, two octaves up but concretely flat, sounds like one comma. heh, he did it again. well that&apos;s another thread.</p></div><h3><a id=22210 href="#22210">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>4/2/2010 3:21:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>PITCH I:4 can be sent to you for a download  for $20. US  I&apos;ll have info<br/>added to the AFMM web site.</p><p>As for poking holes in a clarinet, it&apos;s  probably the worst of the winds to<br/>experiment with because of the overblow at  the fifths.  And using a junker<br/>will likely deliver a junker.  Again,  try the tape idea first.  It&apos;s free.<br/> You should be able to combine it  with all sorts of fingerings to get just<br/>about anything you can imagine.</p><p>Fantastic working with people that can do  what you imagine, no?  Giving<br/>your clarinetist a repeatable location for a  finding a single microtonal<br/>pitch, always relative, is the true gateway to a  rich music, filled with new<br/>meanings and other tangibles.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
