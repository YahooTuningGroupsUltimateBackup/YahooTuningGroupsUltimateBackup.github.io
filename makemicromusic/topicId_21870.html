The extreme of control is using a<br/>program like csound where every aspect - not matter how tiny can be under<br/>your control and the other end is say... calling Times Square from 4:30 to<br/>5:30 pm on a July 11th Tuesday afternoon your composition. In between exists<br/>everything else.</p><p>For example</p><p>Beethoven didn&apos;t specify &quot;exactly&quot; how a viola section should sound - his<br/>ideal wasn&apos;t necessarily the ideal of the conductor or of the performer or<br/>of the particular instrument used. So... random (small) changes in the<br/>timbre and possible intonation were / are accepted.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Feb 22, 2010 at 4:02 PM, David Young &lt;anklesjuggle07@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t anyone making creative choices in a musical context (composing or<br/>&gt; improvising) a music theorist of sorts?
