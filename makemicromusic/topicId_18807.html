It is graphically-oriented and doesn&apos;t utilize notation (which I don&apos;t need or use for my electronic music anyway).  There is direct support for microtonal scales (Scala format) in the Piano Roll tool.  And of course Csound can do anything pitch-wise that you can possibly imagine, but it&apos;s certainly not everyone&apos;s cup of tea.</p><p>When I want to use notation, I use Noteworthy Composer[2], which is very inexpensive ($39) and can play or generate MIDI files.  Nowhere near Sibelius or Finale in terms or power or flexibility, but very good.  No direct support for microtonal scales, but you can use Scala or Fractal Tune Smithy (among others) to retune the MIDI.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>[1] <a href="http://www.csounds.com/stevenyi/blue/">http://www.csounds.com/stevenyi/blue/</a><br/>[2] <a href="http://www.noteworthysoftware.com/">http://www.noteworthysoftware.com/</a></p><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey everyone...<br/>&gt; &gt; Just curious, what do people use nowadays to compose?

It used to be called &apos;et_compose&apos;, which in a way is<br/>a more accurate description, b/c I designed it for n-edos. However,<br/>b/c one can simulate JI with large edos, I liked the general term.</p><p>One enters an ascii pitch and rhythmic notation, and some other<br/>parameters are possible, like dynamics and tempi, and you can also<br/>humanize the timing and dynamics using gaussian noise functions. The<br/>program (a Python script) parses the input file, changing it to an<br/>intermediate text representation of a MIDI file, and uses &apos;t2mf&apos; togo<br/>the next step of giving you the MIDI file output, which has the same<br/>basename as the input file with a &apos;.mid&apos; on the end instead of &apos;.mc&apos;<br/>(for &apos;micro composer&apos;, an arbitrary file-type suffix I made up)</p><p>The limitations are:</p><p>1) It&apos;s only for equal temperaments, and octave-based ones at that.<br/>Note that JI can be approximated arbitrarily closely using high<br/>n-edos, however. The octave based-restriction is not a deal-breaker<br/>for me, but may be for some (the <a href="http://nonoctave.org">nonoctave.org</a> type crowd). If I had<br/>enough interest, I&apos;d code non-octave tunings into the things, but<br/>right now, I&apos;m letting it stand as is.</p><p>2) It&apos;s polyphonic, but a &apos;voice&apos; cannot be anything other than a<br/>single melodic strand per voice, i.e. one cannot do a 3-voice chord<br/>without actually using 3 voices.</p><p>3) It&apos;s not as expressive as playing an instrument, and probably never<br/>will be. What it gains in flexibility, it loses in corporeality.<br/>However, I managed to do some good work with it, including &quot;The<br/>Juggler&quot;, &quot;Melancholic&quot;, &quot;Insect Ballet&quot;, &quot;Adagio for Margo&quot;, etc.</p><p>The pros:</p><p>1) One is not constrained by a keyboard. (a plus AND minus)</p><p>2) Any pure-octave tuning is theoretically possible. Even unequal<br/>octave based ones can be approximated using something like 1200-edo<br/>for instance.</p><p>3) For most tunings, one can use a standard notation-like syntax. You<br/>can even edit the script (it&apos;s Python) to define your own syntax is<br/>you are adventurous...one also can use a pitch-class numerical based<br/>syntax for any tuning, but especially this is helpful for things like<br/>11-edo when note names are not helpful.</p><p>I haven&apos;t uploaded the latest version to my site yet, but email if<br/>you&apos;re interested in checking it out.</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3><a id=18821 href="#18821">ðŸ”—</a>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2008 8:50:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very interesting, but I notice that there is nothing up there yet.<br/>Could you make an announcement again once you have some code committed to the CVS?</p><p>Magnus Jonsson</p><p>On Mon, 16 Jun 2008, Chuckk Hubbard wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Mike.

I have 6 channels - +3, +2, +1, 0 -1, -2, with each channel<br/>representing a &quot;degree&quot; of 72-tet. So if I want to play 4:5:6:7:9:11,<br/>I put the 4, 6, and 9 on the &quot;0&quot; channel, the 5 on the &quot;-1&quot; channel,<br/>the 7 on the &quot;-2&quot; channel, and the 11 on the &quot;+3&quot; channel (transposed<br/>of course). So it&apos;s actually pretty useful. I just long to see the day<br/>when I can just put sims-maneri or sagittal notation into some<br/>software directly and be gone with it. As you can imagine, having<br/>separate tracks to handle different voices becomes the most difficult<br/>thing in the world. And if I&apos;m wasting 6 eastwest channels on one<br/>sound (where 1 channel can vary from 50-400 MB), then I run out of ram<br/>pretty quickly, even with my 3GB stash right now.</p><p>So if there&apos;s any microtonal notation software in which I can hear the<br/>sounds that I&apos;m putting in in realtime with some decent sample library<br/>(VST instruments are preferred, in reality GM will suffice), that&apos;s<br/>what I need.

I don&apos;t know of any such software that can do that (unless I&apos;m<br/>missing something). I dream of the day when I can be in 13-limit just<br/>and move in chord modulations that go up in repeating patterns of 1/4<br/>or 1/5 of an octave without having to resort to using some ridiculous<br/>high-number equal temperament. Also would be really useful for the<br/>exploration of some of the &quot;non-rational&quot; harmonies involving &quot;noble<br/>mediants&quot; and phi-weighted ratios that are currently all the rage on<br/>the tuning group.</p><p>&gt; In my experience MIDI is useless for microtuning. Far better to set<br/>&gt; something up with OSC, which is more customizable. Alas, the options<br/>&gt; for non-programmers to use OSC are limited right now.<br/>&gt; One solid option is to use/create frontends to Csound, like Blue,<br/>&gt; which Dave mentioned. Csound can load soundfonts and micro-tune them<br/>&gt; without the one-pitchbend-value-per-channel limitation. It is a dream<br/>&gt; come true.</p><p>I&apos;m starting to realize that about MIDI. The &quot;mu-units&quot; or something I<br/>remember reading about on the tonalsoft encyclopedia seemed to be a<br/>clever way to get around those limitations within a certain margin of<br/>error. I don&apos;t know much about OSC and CSound, only rough notions of<br/>what they are. You say that CSound can load soundfonts... Is there any<br/>work being in trying to connect CSound to traditional VST or DXi based<br/>sample libraries or synths? I&apos;m talking about Kontakt, Gigasampler,<br/>Pianoteq, and the like. If so, problem solved.</p><p>&gt; If anyone has a micro-tunable sequencer that can send OSC, or that is<br/>&gt; open-source, I&apos;d be interested in helping to set it up to play<br/>&gt; soundfonts using Csound.</p><p>I&apos;ll talk to one of my professors at school about it - he composes<br/>everything in CSound, and he might have some sort of useful<br/>connection. The software that AKJ just talked about would probably be<br/>useful as well - his is only equal temperament, and yours is only JI,<br/>so there could be potential.</p><p>Plus, there are quite a few microtonal notation programs being talked<br/>about, and if any of them are open source, then it might be easy to<br/>route those into your sequencer.</p><p>Again, these are all just some ideas, take them for what they&apos;re worth.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=18836 href="#18836">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2008 2:11:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did a good chunk of my work in custom software I now call<br/>&gt; &apos;micro_composer&apos;.

People do like their miracle and magic temperaments,<br/>&gt; you know :P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, if your sequencer could switch between different tunings on<br/>&gt; the fly, in the middle of a composition, that would be EXTREMELY<br/>&gt; useful. I don&apos;t know of any such software that can do that (unless I&apos;m<br/>&gt; missing something). I dream of the day when I can be in 13-limit just<br/>&gt; and move in chord modulations that go up in repeating patterns of 1/4<br/>&gt; or 1/5 of an octave without having to resort to using some ridiculous<br/>&gt; high-number equal temperament. Also would be really useful for the<br/>&gt; exploration of some of the &quot;non-rational&quot; harmonies involving &quot;noble<br/>&gt; mediants&quot; and phi-weighted ratios that are currently all the rage on<br/>&gt; the tuning group.</p><p>Hmm... that&apos;s definitely a little farther down the road right now.<br/>But a good idea.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In my experience MIDI is useless for microtuning.

The &quot;mu-units&quot; or something I<br/>&gt; remember reading about on the tonalsoft encyclopedia seemed to be a<br/>&gt; clever way to get around those limitations within a certain margin of<br/>&gt; error. I don&apos;t know much about OSC and CSound, only rough notions of<br/>&gt; what they are. You say that CSound can load soundfonts... Is there any<br/>&gt; work being in trying to connect CSound to traditional VST or DXi based<br/>&gt; sample libraries or synths? I&apos;m talking about Kontakt, Gigasampler,<br/>&gt; Pianoteq, and the like. If so, problem solved.</p><p>There is a VST component for Csound, both for using Csound as a VST<br/>plugin, and for loading VST plugins.

The software that AKJ just talked about would probably be<br/>&gt; useful as well - his is only equal temperament, and yours is only JI,<br/>&gt; so there could be potential.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Plus, there are quite a few microtonal notation programs being talked<br/>&gt; about, and if any of them are open source, then it might be easy to<br/>&gt; route those into your sequencer.</p><p>As soon as I get a day off, I&apos;ll get a prototype posted on the<br/>Sourceforge page.

Right now I&apos;m using the &quot;Staff view&quot; view in SONAR 7 to input<br/>&gt;the notes. I have 6 channels - +3, +2, +1, 0 -1, -2, with each channel<br/>&gt;representing a &quot;degree&quot; of 72-tet. So if I want to play 4:5:6:7:9:11,<br/>&gt;I put the 4, 6, and 9 on the &quot;0&quot; channel, the 5 on the &quot;-1&quot; channel,<br/>&gt;the 7 on the &quot;-2&quot; channel, and the 11 on the &quot;+3&quot; channel (transposed<br/>&gt;of course).

In general, the ability to import scala files would prove to be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; invaluable. Temperament, whether equal or not, is musically useful in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and of itself. People do like their miracle and magic temperaments,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; you know :P<br/>&gt;&gt; If it works with just intonation, it surely can&apos;t be &gt;&gt; difficult to re-map to a temperament.  The only problem &gt;&gt; would be that you have to look at it from a harmonic &gt;&gt; perspective.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, one feature is that one may recenter the entire score (or just<br/>&gt; parts of it) by changing, globally or locally, where 1/1 is.  Thus no<br/>&gt; &quot;scale&quot; is necessary; anything within the 13-limit is possible by<br/>&gt; changing 1/1 enough times.

You say that CSound can load soundfonts... Is there any<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; work being in trying to connect CSound to traditional VST or DXi based<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; sample libraries or synths? I&apos;m talking about Kontakt, Gigasampler,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Pianoteq, and the like. If so, problem solved.<br/>&gt;&gt; Last I heard the SoundFont support wasn&apos;t complete.  You &gt;&gt; could use samples from SoundFonts but the envelopes were &gt;&gt; ignored.  Or you could use FluidSynth.  The problem there is &gt;&gt; that it&apos;s an existing synth engine like you suggest.  But &gt;&gt; the interface to it is all geared to MIDI -- and therefore &gt;&gt; 12 notes to the octave.  The only way to retune it is by &gt;&gt; sending pitch bends, like you would for MIDI.<br/>&gt; &gt; The advantage, as I understand it, is that one can have any number of<br/>&gt; FluidSynth engines, so any number of microtunings simultaneously.  I<br/>&gt; asked about it a while back on the Csound list, maybe it&apos;s time to do<br/>&gt; some more research.</p><p>Can&apos;t you do that with MIDI?  Well, I suppose once you&apos;ve written a microtonal instrument using a FluidSynth instance it won&apos;t be that complex to use.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m a devoted Linux user myself, but I see that as Rosegarden&apos;s main<br/>&gt; limitation; if anyone cares about influencing musicians or broadening<br/>&gt; the microtonal community, cross-platform software is a must.</p><p>But I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything else.

With<br/>&gt; Csound you can write your score file and render it to audio<br/>&gt; outside real time.</p><p>Well, with Csound, if I wanted to use a sample library such as<br/>EastWest or Vienna to hear what a microtonal string concerto would<br/>sound like, could I? I thought Csound was basically an extremely<br/>programmable synth.</p><p>&gt; For a sequencer you also need to be able to hear the other<br/>&gt; parts as you record them. Normal audio sequencers do this fine.</p><p>Not sure what you mean here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; To be honest, anyone that has a text-based interface like microabc<br/>&gt; &gt; already has it half done. All that remains is for a clever GUI to be<br/>&gt; &gt; written with some musical notation font and layer that on top of the<br/>&gt; &gt; text interface. Really isn&apos;t that hard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m glad you&apos;re so confident. I count a notation GUI as a<br/>&gt; hard thing to write. And an audio sequencer for that matter.</p><p>Well, the GUI would certainly be time-consuming, but it isn&apos;t<br/>unfathomable, nor is the process needed to get from point a to point b<br/>unfathomable. Same with the sequencer. As long as the program has a<br/>general plan to get from start to finish, it becomes much easier.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So here is what we need to actually accomplish this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) An existing cross-platform microtonal sequencer, preferably coded in C++<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) An existing cross-platform notation package, preferably coded in C++<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why preferably C++? The rest of us seem to prefer Python.</p><p>I was listing my own preferences actually.

So a lot of the work is already done. The main task is<br/>&gt; getting these parts to communicate and then creating a cohesive GUI<br/>&gt; for the whole package.</p><p>So what parts are you planning to re-use?  You were talking about MicroABC at the top.  Are you familiar with MicroABC?   Well, maybe I should say more about this.  MicroABC is a pre-processor that produces ABC code.  ABC is an ASCII format for notating music.  You can convert ABC into PostScript using a C program.  ABC programs always seem to be written in C although they&apos;re essentially text munging because it&apos;s ABC in and PostScript out.  Obviously C isn&apos;t the best language to do text processing so most of the work gets pushed into the PostScript.  The result is that, from both ends, I can&apos;t make head or tail of it.  So then MicroABC has to somehow produce an output that the next layer can take as input to give a microtonal score.  And, it gets better, because the microtonal support requires more than standard ABC can give you there&apos;s only one specific ABC processor that works with MicroABC.  Even better than that, you need a specific version of the processor, and MicroABC has different code for two different versions.</p><p>On the good side, MicroABC will produce microtonal scores and some MIDI output as well.  It took a lot of work to get it like that.</p><p>On the bad side I can&apos;t see how MicroABC would help you write a notation program.  You can convert from your native format into ABC and then get a PostScript file.  You can even convert that into PDF and use a standard PDF viewer to look at it.  It isn&apos;t perfect until you print it, but it&apos;s readable.  But how do you edit that output?  You have to know which note the user clicked on.  You need to update the display with changes.  The existing ABC chain doesn&apos;t help you at all with this.  The code won&apos;t help much because it&apos;s C and PostScript.  So you&apos;re going to end up writing your own notation program from stratch.  Which is exactly what I said will be difficult.</p><p>If there are open source sequencers, bring them on!  Do they do notation?  I only know of Rosegarden.  Rosegarden is very good but what I&apos;ve heard about the source code is bad. Going in and adapting that code for microtonality won&apos;t be easy because there are 12-equal assumptions all over.  And then it isn&apos;t cross-platform which means it isn&apos;t what we, as a group, want.</p><p>&gt;&gt;From looking at Csound, it seems much more complicated to build an<br/>&gt; entire realistic-sounding orchestra than it would be to just use MIDI.<br/>&gt; Or, there&apos;s the original idea of having the program save into its own<br/>&gt; file format (or some commonly used one or even XML if we wanted), and<br/>&gt; then be able to &quot;export&quot; to MIDI so you CAN run it through pianoteq if<br/>&gt; you want.</p><p>Just use MIDI for what?  One advantage of Csound is that there&apos;s already a cross platform microtonal sequencer for it: Blue.  Maybe you could add notation support to it.  As for building an orchestra, yes, it&apos;d be complicated, but you said you wanted a hobby.  At least this would give you results one instrument at a time.</p><p>That sample library again:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples">http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples</a></p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18920 href="#18920">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2008 9:04:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;Disturbingly we share the same wet dream.

If the synth<br/>&gt; does not, then you need ceiling(n/128)*instruments channels, where<br/>&gt; n is the number of notes per octive in your scale. So in this<br/>&gt; case, ceiling(144/128) = 2*6 = 12 channels.</p><p>Yeah, assuming that for 72-et we want to have an octave and a half<br/>range :P I like your idea though, a spin off of that algorithm might<br/>be effective in cutting the number of MIDI channels down.</p><p>But even furthermore, you&apos;re talking about the MIDI tuning table<br/>standard, right? Isn&apos;t support for that as rare as the realtime<br/>retuning messages? Or do I misunderstand here?</p><p>&gt;&gt;We then run through them 16 at a time and record<br/>&gt;&gt;them with our favorite synths, then layer them together<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not necessary with softsynths, if you can run enough instances<br/>&gt; of them at once. An 8-core machine with 7 instances of any<br/>&gt; softsynth should definitely take care of you. Alternatively,<br/>&gt; you just buy a 7 instances of your favorite rack synth.</p><p>ha. i sometimes have dreams where I go on bittorrent and manage to<br/>pirate a full nord electro rack. I don&apos;t know why or how it gets out<br/>of the computer and into my hand, but it does and it makes sense at<br/>the time.</p><p>&gt;&gt;To be honest, anyone that has a text-based interface like microabc<br/>&gt;&gt;already has it half done. All that remains is for a clever GUI to be<br/>&gt;&gt;written with some musical notation font and layer that on top of the<br/>&gt;&gt;text interface.

Anyone with coding experience on here who is willing to help out<br/>&gt;&gt;with this project, feel free - especially with the CSound aspects of<br/>&gt;&gt;it, which I&apos;m a little rough on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well if C++ is all you know, I guess we&apos;ll have to take what we<br/>&gt; can get!

So in this<br/>&gt;&gt; case, ceiling(144/128) = 2*6 = 12 channels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yeah, assuming that for 72-et we want to have an octave and a half<br/>&gt;range :P I like your idea though, a spin off of that algorithm might<br/>&gt;be effective in cutting the number of MIDI channels down.</p><p>Yeah, forgot to multiply by the number of octaves required.<br/>It can get a bit unwieldy in extreme cases like this but for<br/>most situations, e.g. a quartet playing in 41-ET, it shouldn&apos;t<br/>be too bad.</p><p>&gt;But even furthermore, you&apos;re talking about the MIDI tuning table<br/>&gt;standard, right? Isn&apos;t support for that as rare as the realtime<br/>&gt;retuning messages? Or do I misunderstand here?</p><p>I generally prefer controlling synth tuning via Scala files,<br/>but we can certainly offer MTS for those synths that support it.<br/>OSC probably lets you specify the frequency of each note.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;So here is what we need to actually accomplish this:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;1) An existing cross-platform microtonal sequencer, preferably<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;coded in C++<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;2) An existing cross-platform notation package, preferably<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;coded in C++<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;Preferrably coded in my language of choice&apos;. I gotta give you<br/>&gt;&gt; points for style! But I think we should use C# or some other<br/>&gt;&gt; modern language. Jeez, I thought you were young or something. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hahaha. Everybody hates C++ now, huh? I definitely wanted to stay away<br/>&gt;from Python so that it could be relatively fast and expandable in case<br/>&gt;we ever wanted to add audio support or something in the future without<br/>&gt;considerable slowdown. Honestly I sort of blew C# off right away as I<br/>&gt;avoid Microsoft&apos;s oh-so-wonderful &quot;programming innovations&quot; like the<br/>&gt;plague nowadays, but if you think it&apos;s worthwhile, I&apos;ll give it<br/>&gt;another looksee. What would you recommend for this project?</p><p>It&apos;d be nice to have managed code, is all.  Could be Java or C#<br/>or whatever.  If you know C++, C# should be the easiest of these<br/>to move to.</p><p>&gt;It isn&apos;t all I know, but I definitely like to avoid extremely<br/>&gt;high-level programming languages, especially interpreted languages, as<br/>&gt;IMO they just cause too many problems when the scope of the project<br/>&gt;passes a certain point. Sure it&apos;s easy to jump right in, but with a<br/>&gt;little more work you can write your own methods for common things here<br/>&gt;and have them be infinitely more expandable, avoid bugs in the<br/>&gt;interpreter, etc.</p><p>Python can be compiled into a .net project like any other .net<br/>language.  I&apos;m not saying you should necessarily use .net, but<br/>it&apos;s definitely worth a look.  Otherwise it&apos;s C++ and gtk or<br/>something like that.  I dunno if XUL is up to the task.

You can still use Csound as a MIDI synth if it has<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; something you need.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hm, do you think so? Right now I&apos;m confused as to how I&apos;d ever do a<br/>&gt;&gt; microtonal piece for full orchestra with only 16 channels of pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; bends and MIDI to work with. Let&apos;s say I wrote it in 31tet or<br/>&gt;&gt; something - to play the 31-tet equivalent of 4:5:6:7 on two different<br/>&gt;&gt; instruments would require 8 channels right there if the synth you&apos;re<br/>&gt;&gt; working with doesn&apos;t support the MIDI tuning standard (which many<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If it doesn&apos;t work with tuning tables, yes. But that means<br/>&gt; you&apos;re restricting yourself to those synthesizers with<br/>&gt; tuning tables -- which will include Csound. If you use<br/>&gt; pitch bend tuning you can either use multiple MIDI buses (I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t think that was a problem these days) or multitrack,<br/>&gt; as we talk about below. And you&apos;ll need one note per<br/>&gt; channel for legato to work properly in MIDI.</p><p>Well, on Windows, for the Microsoft/Roland GM synth I wasn&apos;t aware you<br/>could have more than one MIDI bus running on it at at time. If you<br/>can, then I have no reservations about going straight to MIDI.<br/>Otherwise, to use MIDI, I&apos;d have to package some MIDI synth with the<br/>program, similar to how Scala does with Megamid, I suppose. That would<br/>most likely be way, way easier than using Csound.</p><p>I think before I even start thinking about this I need to get a better<br/>idea of how you guys have been approaching this via MIDI, as I&apos;ve run<br/>into a few interesting ideas in this thread on the last 24 hours that<br/>I didn&apos;t think were even possible.</p><p>&gt; The problem with pitch bend tuning is that your keyboard<br/>&gt; won&apos;t emit the pitch bends. With tuning tables you can<br/>&gt; enter notes from the keyboard. One thing the software can<br/>&gt; do is add the pitch bends.</p><p>Not sure what you mean here... You&apos;re referring to recording MIDI in<br/>live from a keyboard? It seems like if I could get a MIDI echo<br/>function set up, the problem would be solved.</p><p>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s what I&apos;m getting at. You go open up Logic or Protools or Sonar<br/>&gt;&gt; or whatever you want, and throw in the MIDI file, you run as many<br/>&gt;&gt; channels into your softsynth that you can and run as many softsynths<br/>&gt;&gt; as your computer can allow, you get the audio version of what you<br/>&gt;&gt; have, then you repeat. Even if you end up with 128 channels of MIDI<br/>&gt;&gt; data, and you can only run one 8-channel softsynth at a time - which<br/>&gt;&gt; means your computer is most likely really, really old - you&apos;d STILL be<br/>&gt;&gt; able to get the job done just by bouncing it 8 times. Most people I<br/>&gt;&gt; think will be able to run at least 2 instances of Kontakt at once, so<br/>&gt;&gt; I think it&apos;d work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you work on one instrument at a time you&apos;ll naturally<br/>&gt; have one audio track per instrument.</p><p>What do you mean? Are you talking about the best way for someone to<br/>bounce from a VST synth to an audio track? Or how you&apos;d like the GUI<br/>to look in which multiple channels can be represented in the same<br/>track?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Starting with an existing audio<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; sequencer means all this work&apos;s done for you.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s the plan. But see the above notes on MIDI.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Also, when you talk about audio sequencers right here, are you talking<br/>&gt;&gt; about GUI-based programs i.e. Logic and such?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. A MIDI sequencer that can record audio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham</p><p>Well, if an open source sequencer like that exists, that would be a<br/>great starting point.

MIDI has some limitations in my mind that seem<br/>insurmountable, but maybe you have some insight on how to get past<br/>them. Namely, it seems like if I&apos;m going to want to play a four-note<br/>chord in 31tet, for example, I&apos;m going to use four MIDI channels,<br/>unless the synth supports MTS, which I can&apos;t find any that do except<br/>NI&apos;s FM8. So I think relying on the MTS support to be there would be<br/>futile, as even if we left it up to the user to choose the synth<br/>tools, what tools are there that support it? Even Scala has the option<br/>of doing it with channel swapping and pitch-bending, which is fine. So<br/>we&apos;d need to make sure that we can run multiple instances of whatever<br/>softsynth the user chooses, or else the program simply won&apos;t work.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What would you recommend other than Csound?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d probably write a custom toy synth for the purpose.</p><p>Yeah. I think that in the grand scheme of things for this project<br/>having a custom synth shouldn&apos;t be that important anyway. We&apos;re really<br/>looking for people to be able to write microtonal music and hear what<br/>it would sound like in real time. People are going to want to use<br/>their own synths anyway, but if they can&apos;t get Kontakt running enough<br/>times to handle all of the MIDI channels they might need, then it&apos;s<br/>useless. So the option should be available to do that if the user has<br/>the CPU power/RAM for it, but if not, then the option should also<br/>exist to use at least some other GM synth we can have 8 instances of<br/>running if need be.</p><p>So I envision a &quot;high-level&quot; and a &quot;low-level&quot; of operation. Perhaps<br/>in realtime, if their computer isn&apos;t powerful enough, they&apos;ll still be<br/>able to work with some standard cheesy GM sounds, and then when<br/>they&apos;re done they can bounce to audio by rerecording a few times like<br/>we were discussing above.</p><p>&gt; I generally prefer controlling synth tuning via Scala files,<br/>&gt; but we can certainly offer MTS for those synths that support it.<br/>&gt; OSC probably lets you specify the frequency of each note.</p><p>What do you mean via scala files?

Could be Java or C#<br/>&gt; or whatever. If you know C++, C# should be the easiest of these<br/>&gt; to move to.</p><p>Well, managed code certainly makes portability easier, but if we&apos;re<br/>talking about eventually turning this into something that could run<br/>several VST softsynths at once and have a whole audio suite and such<br/>while still maintaining a rigid 960 ppq, won&apos;t that be much harder<br/>using something with a VM?

A lot of the<br/>&gt;&gt; individual portions are already done. We have a few open-source<br/>&gt;&gt; sequencers that people have written and notation software suites<br/>&gt;&gt; already. So a lot of the work is already done. The main task is<br/>&gt;&gt; getting these parts to communicate and then creating a cohesive GUI<br/>&gt;&gt; for the whole package.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what parts are you planning to re-use? You were talking<br/>&gt; about MicroABC at the top. Are you familiar with MicroABC?<br/>&gt; Well, maybe I should say more about this. MicroABC is a<br/>&gt; pre-processor that produces ABC code. ABC is an ASCII<br/>&gt; format for notating music. You can convert ABC into<br/>&gt; PostScript using a C program. ABC programs always seem to<br/>&gt; be written in C although they&apos;re essentially text munging<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s ABC in and PostScript out. Obviously C isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; the best language to do text processing so most of the work<br/>&gt; gets pushed into the PostScript. The result is that, from<br/>&gt; both ends, I can&apos;t make head or tail of it. So then<br/>&gt; MicroABC has to somehow produce an output that the next<br/>&gt; layer can take as input to give a microtonal score. And, it<br/>&gt; gets better, because the microtonal support requires more<br/>&gt; than standard ABC can give you there&apos;s only one specific ABC<br/>&gt; processor that works with MicroABC. Even better than that,<br/>&gt; you need a specific version of the processor, and MicroABC<br/>&gt; has different code for two different versions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the good side, MicroABC will produce microtonal scores<br/>&gt; and some MIDI output as well. It took a lot of work to get<br/>&gt; it like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the bad side I can&apos;t see how MicroABC would help you<br/>&gt; write a notation program. You can convert from your native<br/>&gt; format into ABC and then get a PostScript file. You can<br/>&gt; even convert that into PDF and use a standard PDF viewer to<br/>&gt; look at it. It isn&apos;t perfect until you print it, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; readable. But how do you edit that output? You have to<br/>&gt; know which note the user clicked on. You need to update the<br/>&gt; display with changes. The existing ABC chain doesn&apos;t help<br/>&gt; you at all with this. The code won&apos;t help much because it&apos;s<br/>&gt; C and PostScript. So you&apos;re going to end up writing your<br/>&gt; own notation program from stratch. Which is exactly what I<br/>&gt; said will be difficult.</p><p>I wish I had seen this earlier. I just did a whole bunch of research<br/>into MicroABC to hit this dead end. So I&apos;m going to have to look<br/>elsewhere.</p><p>&gt; If there are open source sequencers, bring them on! Do they<br/>&gt; do notation? I only know of Rosegarden. Rosegarden is very<br/>&gt; good but what I&apos;ve heard about the source code is bad.<br/>&gt; Going in and adapting that code for microtonality won&apos;t be<br/>&gt; easy because there are 12-equal assumptions all over. And<br/>&gt; then it isn&apos;t cross-platform which means it isn&apos;t what we,<br/>&gt; as a group, want.</p><p>So I&apos;ve been doing some research into possibly porting Rosegarden, and<br/>from what I&apos;ve found, people keep saying that the challenge doesn&apos;t<br/>lie in porting the GUI or really anything except the audio engine,<br/>which is currently tied into Linux&apos;s ALSA/JACK stuff.

I&apos;d suggest we not implement it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I generally prefer controlling synth tuning via Scala files,<br/>&gt;&gt; but we can certainly offer MTS for those synths that support it.<br/>&gt;&gt; OSC probably lets you specify the frequency of each note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What do you mean via scala files? How would that let us get more than<br/>&gt;12 notes per octave when dealing with MIDI?

It<br/>can be a pain when doing channel splitting, but other than that<br/>it&apos;s a great way to work.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&apos;d be nice to have managed code, is all. Could be Java or C#<br/>&gt;&gt; or whatever. If you know C++, C# should be the easiest of these<br/>&gt;&gt; to move to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, managed code certainly makes portability easier, but if we&apos;re<br/>&gt;talking about eventually turning this into something that could run<br/>&gt;several VST softsynths at once and have a whole audio suite and such<br/>&gt;while still maintaining a rigid 960 ppq, won&apos;t that be much harder<br/>&gt;using something with a VM?</p><p>It&apos;s not very often you can beat a modern garbage collector by<br/>hand coding.  More likely you&apos;ll f-up and have memory leaks.</p><p>&gt;Even if for right now it isn&apos;t that<br/>&gt;complicated, it seems like using a VM is going to impose a ceiling on<br/>&gt;the whole thing.  I haven&apos;t messed with .NET too much, so maybe<br/>&gt;its VM is capable of handling that sort of thing.</p><p>.net isn&apos;t a VM, it&apos;s native binaries at the end of the day.<br/>And I don&apos;t see why you&apos;re equating our performance with<br/>softsynth load.  Whatever VST or MIDI synths we&apos;ll use will<br/>be binaries.  The OS takes care of the multitasking, not us.<br/>And unless we inspect the system and make a guess, we won&apos;t<br/>be able to know how many instances of which synth the user<br/>will be able to run.  But your idea of picking a lightweight<br/>one and bundling it is good.  Except instead of a bundle you<br/>could just put it in the system requirements and that saves<br/>you any licensing trouble.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Python can be compiled into a .net project like any other .net<br/>&gt;&gt; language. I&apos;m not saying you should necessarily use .net, but<br/>&gt;&gt; it&apos;s definitely worth a look. Otherwise it&apos;s C++ and gtk or<br/>&gt;&gt; something like that. I dunno if XUL is up to the task. I guess<br/>&gt;&gt; it&apos;s made strides lately.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If the performance hit by using .NET wouldn&apos;t be too severe,<br/>&gt;I&apos;d do it in that.

I&apos;d rather have a piano roll that alpha blends to staff<br/>&gt;&gt; notation (an idea I&apos;ve been toying with for some years).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What do you mean exactly here? A piano roll with a staff above it,<br/>&gt;and edit operations at any place propagated to the other in realtime?</p><p>The key ingredients in my scheme are:</p><p>* Not WSYWIG, in the sense that the onscreen display is<br/>optimized for onscreen editing.  There&apos;s a separate step<br/>for page layout if you want to print.  This is a core<br/>part of the philosophy.</p><p>* So the editing display shows a linear timeline, not a<br/>&quot;page&quot;.  The key is that &apos;now&apos; is always at the same<br/>spot.  We don&apos;t move a caret across the screen and then<br/>update, we *smoothly scroll* content under a fixed caret.<br/>Very important for *fast* mouse editing, and works well<br/>with a &apos;object properties inspector&apos; paradigm.</p><p>* The timeline can show a regular staff with notes, or<br/>a piano roll, with a slider for alpha blending between<br/>them.  Music notation is equivalent to a piano roll,<br/>except: 1. duration is expressed with flags and notehead<br/>coloring instead of bar length 2. vertical position<br/>increments aren&apos;t all the same.<br/>If the slider is moved all the way to the piano roll<br/>position (so the traditional notes are invisible) the<br/>only difference between what you&apos;ll see and a traditional<br/>piano roll will be #2 (the unequal vertical increment).</p><p>* The point of the piano roll view is: 1. to assist people<br/>who aren&apos;t good with regular music notation and 2. to<br/>assist people who aren&apos;t good with the advanced<br/>polyrhythmic notations (like Henry Cowell&apos;s) I intend to<br/>implement, which would be everybody.</p><p>* As already mentioned, when creating a new score we are<br/>prompted to specify the vertical increments (ie &lt; L L s &gt;<br/>etc.), accidental font file, MIDI offsets into the<br/>accidentals, and notehead shape and flag meanings.<br/>We&apos;ll ship with a few presets, including one that gives<br/>common practice notation, and users can save their own.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=19020 href="#19020">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 9:46:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 03:47 AM 6/19/2008, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; I am thinking about Jazz++ (<a href="http://jazzplusplus.sourceforge.net">http://jazzplusplus.sourceforge.net</a>).

I think it is the primary explanation for all those<br/>flame/holy wars between Mac vs Microsoft vs Linux advocates or vi vs<br/>emacs text editor fanatics (or if you are old enough Ford vs Chevy<br/>fans.)</p><p> I first noticed this phenomenon many years ago (1982) when I had seen<br/>the Lisa and the Xerox Star but the Macintosh wasn&apos;t out yet and we<br/>were trying to design a graphical GUI type interface for a scientific<br/>instrument. We had a viewing window on the display. The contents were<br/>controlled by a joystick. Left and right scrolled the image and front<br/>to back zoomed. The big question was &quot;when the joystick is pushed<br/>right which direction should the pixels move?&quot; I polled almost<br/>everyone in the company (I added a switch that allowed people to try<br/>either one.) To my surprise it was a 50/50 split. When I asked why for<br/>most it was an instinctive feel that they didn&apos;t understand but they<br/>were passionately convinced was right anyway. I&apos;ve seen this kind of<br/>thing a lot, an apparently arbitrary split in the opinions of<br/>intelligent people. I&apos;m sure most people on this list have had similar<br/>experiences. Two groups of intelligent competent people will have<br/>totally and sometimes violently opposing views on something relatively<br/>trivial seeming to an outsider or newcomer.</p><p>I eventually tracked this particular one down. It was a difference in<br/>a paradigm most people didn&apos;t even know they were using. Half the<br/>people thought the joystick was connected to the image and they wanted<br/>the image to move with the joystick. The other half thought the<br/>joystick was connected to the window and moving the joysick should<br/>move the window over the image. This group expected the image to move<br/>counter to the direction of joystick movement.</p><p>The people most passionate about their feelings about the joystick<br/>motion (i.e. the most biased) were the ones that least understood the<br/>paradigms (derived from something in their personal experience) that<br/>were forcing their perceptions of correct and incorrect joystick<br/>behavior. In reality there was no right answer. Both paradigms were<br/>useful once the user understood them. In fact once I recast the<br/>question to include the underlying paradigms most people got bored and<br/>no longer had strong opinions. In other words when I asked if the<br/>joystick should be connected to the window and move it over the image,<br/>or connected to the image and move it under the window the answer was<br/>generally some form of &quot;whatever.&quot;</p><p>We don&apos;t need to start any silly flame wars here on the superiority of<br/>one computer or development system over another (other than to note<br/>that the single most likely explanation is that Bill Gates is in fact<br/>the devil incarnate) but we do need to be sensitive to how our history<br/>of audible experience colors our current perception if we expect to be<br/>able to trust our own experience and use it to teach us something<br/>basic about the general questions of human perception of music.</p><p>And we do need to be sure that any cross platform software we develop<br/>should work especially well on the clearly superior Macintosh OS-X<br/>platform used by all right thinking people. ;-)</p><p>Pax vobiscum</p><p>   Barbershop Steve</p></div><h3><a id=19026 href="#19026">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 12:49:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 12:16 PM 6/19/2008, you wrote:<br/>&gt;On Thu, Jun 19, 2008 at 12:55 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m not a Microsoft developer or even shareholder any more, but<br/>&gt;&gt; their technology is superior in my opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Speaking of subjective experience I find that most people mean &quot;It<br/>&gt;does what I expect&quot; when they say something is superior even though<br/>&gt;their expectations are heavily colored by experience.</p><p>In this their technology allows one to:<br/>1.

So if we package Timidity with it, then nobody would have any<br/>kind of a problem ever.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Even Scala has the option<br/>&gt;&gt;of doing it with channel swapping and pitch-bending, which is fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s great for quick-and-dirty, but it&apos;s a hack and not suitable<br/>&gt; for serious production. I&apos;d suggest we not implement it.</p><p>One of my main objectives with this is that people shouldn&apos;t be<br/>limited to the software you see up there. It&apos;s quite an impressive<br/>range, but certainly not complete by any means. And users are likely<br/>going to have their own synths that they&apos;re going to want to use, of<br/>which a few very significant ones are left out of that list above. Not<br/>to mention the people that use an external MIDI rack or keyboard for<br/>their sounds, of which support is even more rare. So having a little<br/>switch in the preferences that lets you use the pitch bending and<br/>channel swapping to work with those resources greatly expands the<br/>usefulness of the program.</p><p>I don&apos;t suggest we implement that as fundamental on the application<br/>layer - rather that it is one possible way to output the note data<br/>from the events list. It could also be output via MTS, or by working<br/>something out with a Scala file, or by using OSC.</p><p>And the very least, it might be useful within the context of an<br/>&quot;export to MIDI,&quot; so that people can at least go to their favorite<br/>synths when they&apos;re done. But if we&apos;re going to implement that it<br/>would likely not be too much of a stretch to just have it work in real<br/>time as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What do you mean via scala files? How would that let us get more than<br/>&gt;&gt;12 notes per octave when dealing with MIDI? We&apos;d still need pitch<br/>&gt;&gt;bends, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a synth supports them, you don&apos;t need any pitch bends, no.<br/>&gt; You just send plain MIDI and the synth knows how to tune it. It<br/>&gt; can be a pain when doing channel splitting, but other than that<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a great way to work.</p><p>So you&apos;re not limited to 12-note subsets of various scales? Does it<br/>retune the note spectrum from 0-127 as MTS does?</p><p>Also, what do you mean by channel splitting?</p><p>&gt; .net isn&apos;t a VM, it&apos;s native binaries at the end of the day.<br/>&gt; And I don&apos;t see why you&apos;re equating our performance with<br/>&gt; softsynth load. Whatever VST or MIDI synths we&apos;ll use will<br/>&gt; be binaries. The OS takes care of the multitasking, not us.<br/>&gt; And unless we inspect the system and make a guess, we won&apos;t<br/>&gt; be able to know how many instances of which synth the user<br/>&gt; will be able to run. But your idea of picking a lightweight<br/>&gt; one and bundling it is good. Except instead of a bundle you<br/>&gt; could just put it in the system requirements and that saves<br/>&gt; you any licensing trouble.</p><p>Yeah. Or at least a link on the sourceforge page.</p><p>Part of my objective with this project is that I want it to tie into<br/>the stuff we were discussing about the workshop. I want it to be<br/>something I can point at the average musician on a mac or a PC or even<br/>linux and say &quot;check this program out&quot; and they can roll with it, so<br/>that more people can easily compose microtonal music. And I want them<br/>to be able to roll with it without even having to know anything about<br/>VST or MTS or Scala at all if they don&apos;t already know, so that they<br/>can just use their system&apos;s native GM synth or one that we would<br/>bundle. Of course, for power users that know more about it, there<br/>should be a way to configure all of the behind-the-scenes stuff as<br/>well.</p><p>I guess rather than equate the performance with softsynth load, it<br/>would be better to equate the performance with audio load. If we&apos;re<br/>going to do it in C#, and if the performance hit means that we will<br/>NEVER be able to add in an audio section to the sequencer if we want<br/>to, then I think we&apos;d best work from a lower level paradigm. On the<br/>other hand, it seems you&apos;re saying that working in .NET won&apos;t be too<br/>much slower, and if that&apos;s the case, then I&apos;d rather work in C# than<br/>C++ anyway, as it&apos;s just easier.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Python can be compiled into a .net project like any other .net<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; language. I&apos;m not saying you should necessarily use .net, but<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; it&apos;s definitely worth a look. Otherwise it&apos;s C++ and gtk or<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; something like that. I dunno if XUL is up to the task. I guess<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; it&apos;s made strides lately.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;If the performance hit by using .NET wouldn&apos;t be too severe,<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d do it in that. The jury seems to be still out on that<br/>&gt;&gt;one though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It does? All windows development has been .net for years.<br/>&gt; Even if you write C++ I believe it&apos;s compiled to .net CLR<br/>&gt; first.</p><p>Hm. I&apos;ll have to do more research. Now visions of C# run through my head.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19034 href="#19034">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 2:44:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What do you mean exactly here? A piano roll with a staff above it,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, over top it.</p><p>Ah yeah, I meant &quot;above it&quot; in like a 3-dimensional sense. Seems like<br/>the vertical disparity could get pretty extreme between the two<br/>though, especially if you&apos;re using something like 31-tet where sharps<br/>and flats and half sharps and half flats can all be on the same staff<br/>notation line. If you don&apos;t mind that though, it seems like it&apos;d be a<br/>neat idea.</p><p>Another way to counter that would be to have unequal vertical piano<br/>roll spacing, so that in 12tet, for example, the &quot;D&quot; space on the<br/>staff is really two spaces half the size on the piano roll for D and<br/>D#, and then E would be twice as large as it has no sharp. Then we<br/>could alpha blend them perfectly. Maybe we&apos;d have to increase the zoom<br/>on the staff.</p><p>For higher-order temperaments such as 31 or 72 equal, this method<br/>might not work, although it might be very possible to find a setting<br/>in which the piano roll is zoomed in enough to see and the staff is<br/>zoomed in just enough that it&apos;s still somewhat readable.

Would we never stretch the<br/>&gt;&gt;staff notation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;That might look weird.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.musanim.com">http://www.musanim.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just imagine the score on top. It&apos;s a no-brainer.</p><p>Well, I get what you&apos;re saying, but it seems like it would be more<br/>useful for a piano roll than for a staff if that&apos;s the case. Being<br/>able to stretch the width of a measure is pretty vital for scoring. A<br/>good portion of the time that I spend while scoring anything is making<br/>sure it&apos;s readable and preparing it as such by moving measure lengths<br/>around and the like. If your goal for the staff is to simply be an<br/>alpha overlay on top of the piano roll and so that the piano roll is<br/>the main intent of focus with the staff as kind of an added bit of<br/>information, then that would work. But if you want the staff in this<br/>view to be readable in its own right then I would suggest at least<br/>having the option of stretching the measures in the staff if the user<br/>wants. Then again, it&apos;s your idea, so whatever you&apos;d like.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19036 href="#19036">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 3:46:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot;<br/>&lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Hell, I&apos;ll package one with it if it&apos;s that much easier to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;work with than MIDI.

You can access .NET classes directly from Python.  I&apos;m not sure how Python classes get wrapped up for .NET.

Being<br/>&gt; able to stretch the width of a measure is pretty vital for scoring. A<br/>&gt; good portion of the time that I spend while scoring anything is making<br/>&gt; sure it&apos;s readable and preparing it as such by moving measure lengths<br/>&gt; around and the like. If your goal for the staff is to simply be an<br/>&gt; alpha overlay on top of the piano roll and so that the piano roll is<br/>&gt; the main intent of focus with the staff as kind of an added bit of<br/>&gt; information, then that would work. But if you want the staff in this<br/>&gt; view to be readable in its own right then I would suggest at least<br/>&gt; having the option of stretching the measures in the staff if the user<br/>&gt; wants. Then again, it&apos;s your idea, so whatever you&apos;d like.</p><p>There&apos;s a difference between a sequencer that has a notation view and a notation editor that has MIDI support.  Carl mentioned it but I won&apos;t go and look for the reference.</p><p>A sequencer with MIDI support needn&apos;t give good printable output (sometimes there&apos;s no printing at all) but it means there&apos;s something for musicians who like that sort or thing.   There&apos;s a big gap in the market here because you need explicit microtonal support and no sequencers have it.  Then again if you get used to the piano roll view there isn&apos;t much that doesn&apos;t generalize to different scales.  It&apos;s only a staff notation problem.</p><p>Notation editors are more about getting the notes in easily and producing good printed output.  They&apos;re likely not that useful for good sounding output because you can&apos;t adjust the rhythms or set controllers.  I believe there are notation editors that can handle microtonal accidentals and even custom staffs.  So the only advantage you&apos;re getting by writing the whole thing from scratch with microtonality in mind is that the MIDI supports a bit better.</p><p>I can see the point of separating these two kinds of programs.  The tweaks you make to look good and sound good are entirely different.  So you should decide which it is you&apos;re aiming for.</p><p>Personally, I think text-based systems like ABC will do what I need for printed notation.  Entering the ASCII needn&apos;t be harder than the keystrokes you would have used in a GUI. And thing like LilyPond are optimized for very good output.   Rosegarden gives LilyPond output you know, which is an interesting way of bridging the gap.</p><p>So what *I&apos;d* be interested in is a sequencer with a better way of using microtonal scales.  As Csound&apos;s good enough for me I&apos;ll have a look at Blue one day and follow Chuck&apos;s project.  I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re heading anywhere interesting.</p><p>Anyway, to the question, the unscientific selection of music books I have next to the computer shows equal-width measures on any given line regardless of whether it&apos;s numerical notation, staff notation or guitar tablature.  I&apos;ve got a sheet of bawu music in numerical notation that has unequal measures but it&apos;s a cheaply printed thing they gave me with the instrument.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19055 href="#19055">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 7:45:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike and everyone else,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot;<br/>&lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just curious, what do people use nowadays to compose?<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been doing things using Sonar 7 in 72-tet by using<br/>&gt; 6 MIDI channels detuned by the right amount.

Personally I learn them by playing keyboards and working on theory.  Not much through notation.  When I use notation it&apos;s to record ideas so that I can work out what I was thinking or to work out theories.  The point is that there should be a clear mapping between the keyboard, the theory, and the notation.  The more you work with the notation the more intuitive it becomes but it&apos;s still useful if it&apos;s a code that you have to think about.</p><p>The answer, anyway, is practice.</p><p>&gt; I submit that the only way is to have an interactive<br/>&gt; notation editor that&apos;ll play notes when you click on &apos;em,<br/>&gt; chords when you select them, sections of the score when<br/>&gt; you hit play, etc.</p><p>No, the only way to learn how to compose music is to compose music.  If you start with a score and you use a computer then you have to be able to get it into the computer easily and hear the results.  Hence MicroABC does the job fine. What you&apos;re talking about is fine and dandy but a sequencer with staff notation support is good enough for it.  That also helps the people who build their ideas by playing keyboards and drawing in piano roll views and want to see how the staff notation ties in with it.</p><p>The importance of typesetting music you&apos;ve already composed is that you can share your thinking with others.  We&apos;re good at sharing tunings and the ideas behind them on these lists but we aren&apos;t developing shared musical idioms.  In language terms, we&apos;re all developing idiolects.  A score to back up a recording helps a lot to follow the notation.  Maybe sharing scores will help us to move on from being a community of musical idiots ;-)</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19087 href="#19087">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 9:29:04 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s nothing close to what I want.  :(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Alright - no staff notation editor, that&apos;s true.<br/>&gt;How about providing Blue with that?</p><p>If somebody does I&apos;ll definitely be interested.

(Admittedly, I have only been<br/>half-following the thread, so some things I say may already be<br/>mentioned; if so, apologies.)</p><p>That said, I think Csound, for my needs, is probably the most<br/>expressive tool I&apos;ve come across.  I use python within blue using an<br/>orchestral composition library I wrote that helps to abstract out the<br/>different musical ideas (I write a score and have a Performer object<br/>&quot;perform&quot; the score, applying the performer&apos;s location, with the<br/>&quot;accuracy&quot; of the performer affecting things like pitch and<br/>amplitude).  I&apos;ve found write text processing functions in python<br/>fairly easy, and because Csound&apos;s note values are doubles or floats<br/>and not integers bound to 0-127 like MIDI, it&apos;s quite flexible.  I&apos;ve<br/>also used the Random NoteProcessor built into blue to just add a tiny<br/>random value to note start times or durations or amplitudes to<br/>&quot;humanize&quot; a score.  It&apos;s easy to apply per-score-object, to a track,<br/>or to the entire score.  It&apos;s also very easy for me to explore limited<br/>aleatory and glissandi sound masses, both of which are very<br/>interesting to me.  I know one person has used blue to work with<br/>granular clouds spatialized using Ambisonics, and others have used a<br/>number of other tools liks Common Music within blue for their work.<br/>This is just to get an idea of some of the ways blue/csound have been<br/>used.</p><p>In regards to microtonal work, I&apos;ve used the microtonal PianoRoll in<br/>blue to experiment with ideas with different scales.  Also to note,<br/>the Tracker object in blue also supports Scala scales, so one can<br/>compose using a tracker interface if one is familiar with those, but<br/>also can work with Scala scales. I have some python code that reads in<br/>Scala scales and works with my orchestral composition library and have<br/>used that in the past too.  These days I haven&apos;t been exploring scales<br/>as much as I have been hand-tuning notes to get the right sound,<br/>usually justly-tuning the notes from a base note when appropriate.</p><p>I am sure blue is not an ideal software for everyone, but it allows me<br/>to explore the musical sounds and ideas I&apos;m interested in very well<br/>and it seems to work well for others I know too.  However, I&apos;d just<br/>say that if you&apos;re going to start a new piece of software, something<br/>that is of great concern to me is the long-term for software.  It<br/>pains me to see so much software written and abandoned and users of<br/>that software now having no way to really access their work now.<br/>People invest time in a tool to create musical work that hopefully has<br/>a great deal of meaning to them, and I think it is sad to see when<br/>either they can not access the tool any longer to continue their work<br/>or even just to see what they had done.</p><p>This happens for a number of reasons, but the most common being the<br/>developer of the software retires from working on it, or the operating<br/>system or the language is used to develop the software no longer is<br/>around.  Lots of musical work done with software for OS9 can not be<br/>accessed anymore.  Lots of small musical software tools written in<br/>Visual Basic are difficult to find source for.  In these situations,<br/>if the operating system decides to end support for backwards<br/>compatibility, as it seems is often the case with Mac, there is a risk<br/>of losing one&apos;s work.</p><p>This has been a big thought on my mind in terms of the long-term<br/>development of music and hope that other developers consider these<br/>things when building a piece of software and making it available to<br/>other people to use.</p><p>Also, I&apos;d implore that if you don&apos;t find blue for you and do start to<br/>look at building your own software, that you might want to a least<br/>take a look at blue&apos;s design to look at how some of the issues<br/>regarding support for microtonal work have been addressed, and to feel<br/>free to take a look at code and take anything that may be of use (it<br/>is open source after all).

However I find<br/>that I have wasted substantial amounts of time and energy trying to<br/>support various systems I invented mostly with software I have<br/>written. The result has been that I haven&apos;t got much done musically<br/>and worse what little I have done could not be easily shared. When I<br/>invented my own worlds I not only removed myself from the broader<br/>music community, I also made it difficult for people to join mine.

I had another user<br/>recently I worked with over email to help get started and he had given<br/>some useful suggestions on areas of the manual which were a bit<br/>deficient.  I haven&apos;t yet had a chance to get started to revise the<br/>manual, but am starting to plan going through page by page and doing a<br/>reworking of it.</p><p>Until then, I&apos;d suggest getting a bit familiar with Csound by<br/>downloading and installing it and reading Dr. Boulanger&apos;s TOOTS at:</p><p><a href="http://www.csounds.com/toots/">http://www.csounds.com/toots/</a></p><p>These are a pretty good introduction to Csound.  There&apos;s also the<br/>manual at:</p><p><a href="http://www.csounds.com/manual">http://www.csounds.com/manual</a></p><p>There&apos;s been some discusson on the Csound list about deficiencies of<br/>both for new users and it&apos;s all been very valid critique, but for now,<br/>those are the usual ways in.</p><p>After that I&apos;d recommend downloading blue from:</p><p><a href="http://www.csounds.com/stevenyi/blue">http://www.csounds.com/stevenyi/blue</a></p><p>For microtonal music, I&apos;d highly recommend opening Dave Seidel&apos;s<br/>pieces in the examples/pieces/daveSeidel folder.

I&apos;ve also generally extended<br/>invitations that I&apos;m available to do phone calls if you&apos;d like to<br/>schedule a chat about all this.

I&apos;m a reader of this list but<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t often post, but I thought I&apos;d reply to just mention some<br/>&gt; &gt; thoughts about this thread. (Admittedly, I have only been<br/>&gt; &gt; half-following the thread, so some things I say may already be<br/>&gt; &gt; mentioned; if so, apologies.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That said, I think Csound, for my needs, is probably the most<br/>&gt; &gt; expressive tool I&apos;ve come across. I use python within blue using an<br/>&gt; &gt; orchestral composition library I wrote that helps to abstract out the<br/>&gt; &gt; different musical ideas (I write a score and have a Performer object<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;perform&quot; the score, applying the performer&apos;s location, with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;accuracy&quot; of the performer affecting things like pitch and<br/>&gt; &gt; amplitude). I&apos;ve found write text processing functions in python<br/>&gt; &gt; fairly easy, and because Csound&apos;s note values are doubles or floats<br/>&gt; &gt; and not integers bound to 0-127 like MIDI, it&apos;s quite flexible. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; also used the Random NoteProcessor built into blue to just add a tiny<br/>&gt; &gt; random value to note start times or durations or amplitudes to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;humanize&quot; a score. It&apos;s easy to apply per-score-object, to a track,<br/>&gt; &gt; or to the entire score. It&apos;s also very easy for me to explore limited<br/>&gt; &gt; aleatory and glissandi sound masses, both of which are very<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting to me. I know one person has used blue to work with<br/>&gt; &gt; granular clouds spatialized using Ambisonics, and others have used a<br/>&gt; &gt; number of other tools liks Common Music within blue for their work.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is just to get an idea of some of the ways blue/csound have been<br/>&gt; &gt; used.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In regards to microtonal work, I&apos;ve used the microtonal PianoRoll in<br/>&gt; &gt; blue to experiment with ideas with different scales. Also to note,<br/>&gt; &gt; the Tracker object in blue also supports Scala scales, so one can<br/>&gt; &gt; compose using a tracker interface if one is familiar with those, but<br/>&gt; &gt; also can work with Scala scales. I have some python code that reads in<br/>&gt; &gt; Scala scales and works with my orchestral composition library and have<br/>&gt; &gt; used that in the past too. These days I haven&apos;t been exploring scales<br/>&gt; &gt; as much as I have been hand-tuning notes to get the right sound,<br/>&gt; &gt; usually justly-tuning the notes from a base note when appropriate.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am sure blue is not an ideal software for everyone, but it allows me<br/>&gt; &gt; to explore the musical sounds and ideas I&apos;m interested in very well<br/>&gt; &gt; and it seems to work well for others I know too. However, I&apos;d just<br/>&gt; &gt; say that if you&apos;re going to start a new piece of software, something<br/>&gt; &gt; that is of great concern to me is the long-term for software. It<br/>&gt; &gt; pains me to see so much software written and abandoned and users of<br/>&gt; &gt; that software now having no way to really access their work now.<br/>&gt; &gt; People invest time in a tool to create musical work that hopefully has<br/>&gt; &gt; a great deal of meaning to them, and I think it is sad to see when<br/>&gt; &gt; either they can not access the tool any longer to continue their work<br/>&gt; &gt; or even just to see what they had done.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This happens for a number of reasons, but the most common being the<br/>&gt; &gt; developer of the software retires from working on it, or the operating<br/>&gt; &gt; system or the language is used to develop the software no longer is<br/>&gt; &gt; around. Lots of musical work done with software for OS9 can not be<br/>&gt; &gt; accessed anymore. Lots of small musical software tools written in<br/>&gt; &gt; Visual Basic are difficult to find source for. In these situations,<br/>&gt; &gt; if the operating system decides to end support for backwards<br/>&gt; &gt; compatibility, as it seems is often the case with Mac, there is a risk<br/>&gt; &gt; of losing one&apos;s work.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This has been a big thought on my mind in terms of the long-term<br/>&gt; &gt; development of music and hope that other developers consider these<br/>&gt; &gt; things when building a piece of software and making it available to<br/>&gt; &gt; other people to use.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I&apos;d implore that if you don&apos;t find blue for you and do start to<br/>&gt; &gt; look at building your own software, that you might want to a least<br/>&gt; &gt; take a look at blue&apos;s design to look at how some of the issues<br/>&gt; &gt; regarding support for microtonal work have been addressed, and to feel<br/>&gt; &gt; free to take a look at code and take anything that may be of use (it<br/>&gt; &gt; is open source after all). Also, let me know if you do and hopefully<br/>&gt; &gt; some healthy exchange of ideas can occur. =)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt; &gt; steven<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;straub@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Prent Rodgers&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;prentrodgers@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I use Csound and a front end I wrote 15 years ago in Turbo Pascal.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pascal is a little dated, but I still have customers running 40<br/>year<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; old FORTRAN and 25 year old COBOL applications, so I feel like<br/>I&apos;m in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; good company.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Csound has a very stiff learning curve, as others have<br/>discovered.

In effect, you&apos;re doing the same thing manually<br/>&gt; with the keyboard that I&apos;m suggestion the notation<br/>&gt; editor do.</p><p>Or pencil and paper.  Either from your head or with a keyboard.

A notation editor where<br/>&gt;&gt; notes are objects that can be played with a click is<br/>&gt;&gt; probably going to provide faster feedback than sitting at<br/>&gt;&gt; the keyboard with a clipboard and a pencil and going back<br/>&gt;&gt; and forth.  Speaking from personal experience, I certainly<br/>&gt;&gt; found this to be the case when I started learning to compose<br/>&gt;&gt; in standard notation (having already practiced sightreading<br/>&gt;&gt; in choirs, and with the trumpet and piano, for most of<br/>&gt;&gt; my life).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Speaking from my experience, I found writing music on paper<br/>&gt;and transcribing it into Csound to be very boring.

And of course it functions in the midst of complex societies, not just as a means of communication, but as a marker of social identity&mdash;a sign of membership in a social class, ethnic group, or nation.&quot;</p><p>    -- Geoff Nunberg and Tom Wasow<br/>       <a href="http://www.lsadc.org/info/ling-fields-overview.cfm">http://www.lsadc.org/info/ling-fields-overview.cfm</a></p><p>Some of that does apply to music, even written music, but not to music notation.</p><p>&gt; Music notation is quite difficult to learn, something largely<br/>&gt; forgotten by people who learned it so many years ago that it has<br/>&gt; become second nature.

Probably those people wouldn&apos;t be looking for a score editor.  Some people do find reading their mother tongue difficult to learn.  Maybe they&apos;re thick, lazy, badly taught, or dyslexic.  People interested in composition software using staff notation for microtonal music are likely smart, self-motivated, and already comfortable with staff notation.  I&apos;d expect them to pick up a new set of pitches relatively quickly (certainly within a few years) without needing a fancy all-singing, all-dancing score editor with a GUI and some kind of audio support. Some grunt work may be required -- like ear training or counterpoint exercises.</p><p>&gt; The agreed fact that it isn&apos;t as difficult to learn as English doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; prove anything about difficulty.

Therefore the original comparison of English and music notation in terms of being difficult to learn is flawed.</p><p>The point isn&apos;t about learning music notation, anyway.  Only learning a new way of writing pitch in a notation system you already know.  That&apos;s actually very simple.  How simple depends on the pitch system you&apos;re notating.  Of course, Carl makes it look harder by mixing up the notation with the pitch system itself.</p><p>&gt; By any objective definition standard music notation is a horrible<br/>&gt; language poorly suited to discuss music theory. (It is barely adequate<br/>&gt; for performance.) It might even be as horrible as English itself<br/>&gt; although that&apos;s probably a stretch.</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;standard music notation&quot;?  The original proposal was specifically about a score editor for staff notation.  If you think this about staff notation, do you agree that it isn&apos;t the best choice of notation for composition software?  The proposal (which seems to have gone off-list) was to write a score editor from scratch to be a microtonal composition tool.  One reason I caution against this is that staff notation&apos;s a very difficult system to typeset.  Somehow the complexity of staff notation has become an argument in favour of it.</p><p>If you have a better proposal then we can look at it. Currently the standard way of making microtonal music with a computer is to use a sequencer with a piano roll view, or some other system that doesn&apos;t assume a particular scale. Blue already has a microtonal piano roll.  Chuck&apos;s JI software has more chance of achieving usability than a brand new microtonal score editor.</p><p>Incidentally, there&apos;s a score editor called NoteEdit that&apos;s part of the KDE project.  I don&apos;t know how good it is but maybe it&apos;s a place to start.  It&apos;ll likely become cross platform along with the rest of KDE.</p><p>&gt; Fortunately the brain is a wonderful thing and used to working around<br/>&gt; such barriers.</p><p>There are reasons for using custom notations, including variants of staff notation.  There are enough people out there whose brains have worked around the barriers and I, at least, can&apos;t think of a better system.  I maintain that limited applications like MicroABC are good enough for now.   Better microtonal support from score editors will come when there&apos;s better microtonal music to be supported.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19204 href="#19204">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2008 8:18:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote:<br/>&gt;Written English has a lot more than grammar and syntax.

MicroABC as an application produces staff notation in PostScript form.  So yes, if you were under the impression that staff notation didn&apos;t come out, you were wrong.  It isn&apos;t quite standard because obviously it&apos;s microtonal.

What do I know?</p><p>Once software supports Saggital, especially if it&apos;s free software that you can go in and hack, it should be easy to adapt it to use different symbols.  All you need is a different font and a mapping for it.  Hudson&apos;s got decimal and tripod notation working for me so I expect he&apos;ll do the same for whatever accidentals you want if you have the font.</p><p>LilyPond only works with quartertones but some of us are looking at sagittal support.  It may mean a custom build but I&apos;ve looked at the code and it&apos;s not at all bad.  So I can promise you that by the end of the summer.  Again, once Sagittal works it&apos;s that bit easier for other fonts.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19215 href="#19215">ðŸ”—</a>Robin Perry &#x3C;jinto83@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2008 11:45:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I haven&apos;t used Finale.

Notating via paper and<br/>quill was probably easy for Bach as he had thoroughly explored that<br/>style and could to some extent &quot;hear it&quot; in his head. I can notate<br/>normal scores that way, but when we&apos;re getting into 6 part 11-limit<br/>voice leading on I generally need to hear what my chord voicings<br/>actually sound like to write anything meaningful.

I thought that HEWM and Sims-Maneri (I<br/>forget which is which) notation were both great ideas as well. I<br/>prefer them to Sagittal notation because I find the symbol set easy to<br/>adjust to. Using +/- for an 81/80 adjustment is much easier for me to<br/>get used to than using different kinds of slashes and hooks. I do find<br/>the concept of using &quot;7&quot; to go down a septimal comma and an upside<br/>down 7 &quot;L&quot; shape to go up a septimal comma to be a little weird, but I<br/>find it easier to read than I do the Sagittal equivalent.</p><p>I would like to see a version of Sagittal that has a focus on making<br/>the symbol set more intuitive and easier to read... Although there are<br/>those that think it already is intuitive and easier to read, so<br/>perhaps apples and oranges are at play here.</p><p>I will say this though: the reason that +/- works so well for the<br/>comma adjustment for me, and that 7/L does not, has to do with the<br/>former using some kind of intuitive, synesthetic paradigm, and the<br/>latter using a scientific, physical paradigm.</p><p>Think about it: The simplest accidental there is, the flat and sharp<br/>signs, are both synesthetic terms: we are either &quot;sharpening&quot; or<br/>&quot;flattening&quot; a note. Even though this isn&apos;t the original intended<br/>usage for those terms, it stuck in the popular consciousness because<br/>it makes intuitive, synesthetic sense, which is a phenomenon worth<br/>noticing.</p><p>The original terms for sharp and flat were &quot;soft B&quot; for Bb and &quot;hard<br/>B&quot; for B natural, and the symbols for flat and natural evolved out of<br/>drawing a &quot;softened&quot; and a &quot;hard&quot; B in that way. Even using the &quot;soft&quot;<br/>and &quot;hard&quot; paradigm to describe this phenomenon is an intuitive,<br/>synesthetic term for it.</p><p>In fact, if you want to get into it further, we&apos;re using both of these<br/>terms to describe a &quot;raising&quot; and a &quot;lowering&quot; of pitch, do we not?<br/>The terms raising and lowering of pitch are also synesthetic! The<br/>point is that these terms are much better to describe that than<br/>describing a decrease or an increase of wavelength (which would be<br/>backwards from what we&apos;re used to) or a &quot;speeding up&quot; or &quot;slowing<br/>down&quot; of frequency. And this is the problem with the Sims-Maneri 7<br/>flag - it has entirely to do with math and theory, and does not<br/>describe the EXPERIENCE of what 7-limit intervals sound like, as the<br/>&quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; monikers do for their function, or the &quot;raising and<br/>lowering&quot; monikers for pitch, or even the &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; for very<br/>small comma adjustments.</p><p>I think that to come up with a really useful naming system and a<br/>really useful notation system, we need to do some kind of soul<br/>searching and meditating to describe if there is some common thread to<br/>the experience of a 4:7 or 6:7 or 7:9 interval and then use that term<br/>to describe those intervals. Then we&apos;ll apply that to whatever<br/>temperament we&apos;re working in. For example, in 72-tet, we can say that<br/>7/4 is C-Bb that&apos;s a third of a half step flat, but that doesn&apos;t<br/>really mean anything musically, does it?</p><p>I was describing in the other thread that I heard intervals as having<br/>various degrees of depth - 3/2 was the &quot;shallowest,&quot; 5/4 was &quot;deeper,&quot;<br/>and 7/4 was even deeper, etc. Describing an inflection of a 7-limit<br/>interval as &quot;deepening the sound&quot; makes more MUSICAL sense than<br/>describing it as moving by a septimal comma, although some layer of<br/>accuracy is lost, as how &quot;deep&quot; are we deepening here? But I think<br/>that as we explore the territory more and more, we&apos;ll find some<br/>musical connotation with some of these higher-and-higher limit<br/>intervals, and we can then give them those labels as &quot;nicknames,&quot; if<br/>you will. I do find that certain 7-limit chords have a very &quot;mystical&quot;<br/>quality to them... but I&apos;m not everyone. We don&apos;t want synesthetic<br/>names that encourage TOO much as well - 7-limit intervals can be used<br/>for a lot of non-mystical things. Just some simple notion like<br/>&quot;deeper&quot; or &quot;sharper&quot; or something would do.</p><p>Or, to sum my position up nicely: I think that everyone can hear that<br/>the experience of moving an interval from 16/9 to 7/4 does have a<br/>quality to it that is different from just moving it down by 33 cents.<br/>This is equivalent to saying that the periodicity mechanism in the<br/>brain for determining intervallic relationships exists. What would be<br/>interesting is if we found a term for that quality and made THAT the<br/>7-limit moniker.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=19250 href="#19250">ðŸ”—</a>Steve Morris &#x3C;barbershopsteve@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2008 1:42:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Jul 7, 2008 at 3:57 PM, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Oh, same here!

I<br/>&gt; looked at a number of examples this afternoon, including a simply 4<br/>&gt; voice Bach fugue in Hudson&apos;s example pdf. I&apos;d shudder to think what it<br/>&gt; would be like to compose a chamber ensemble of 10 or 20 parts in a<br/>&gt; scenario such as this. ABC seems to have had it&apos;s roots in folk<br/>&gt; traditions, and a lot of monophonic, melodic music. I remain<br/>&gt; unconvinced that it can scale up to more complex scores.</p><p>Numerical notation works with a separate line for an independent line, the same way ABC does.  A great many people use it, but maybe not people you know.</p><p>Wikipedia has a good introduction for anybody not familiar with it:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation</a></p><p>It&apos;s mainly used for traditional music, as with ABC, but different traditions.  That means it doesn&apos;t generally scale up but I don&apos;t know that it can&apos;t.  It is used for erhu ensembles and the like.  One line is smaller than a line of staff notation.  Orchestral music tends to be one musical line per staff anyway.</p><p>The problem is with chords.  One hand of a piano part can be up to 5 notes at a time (more with clusters).  Making that 5 independent lines is going to bloat the score.  Notation tends to follow the instrument so I&apos;ve never seen piano music in numerical notation.  With MicroABC you only have to fight the system to get the notes in and then you can see the score output.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in numerical notation because decimal notation translates very easily -- simply use R for rests instead of 0 and you have 10 nominals.  Also tripod notation, with 9 nominals, doesn&apos;t even need that modification.  Unfortunately they don&apos;t suit ABC so well because digits have a separate meaning.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=19318 href="#19318">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2008 7:29:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Graham wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; There are a few of us who&apos;ve worked with alternative &gt;&gt; notations.

We need to be able to just<br/>enter one character for one accidental.</p><p>I realise the brackets are needed to support the full generality of<br/>saggittal, but it has always been a strong principle in the design of<br/>Sagittal that the ability to notate more complex tunings must never be<br/>allowed to increase the difficulty of notating the simpler tunings.</p><p>&gt; or maybe, as I fear, Sagittal itself is the<br/>&gt; cause of the slowdown...I simply can&apos;t think in Sagittal very fluidly.<br/>&gt; Heck, I even have to write out notation symbols for standard 17-equal<br/>&gt; sometimes to remind myself how it works.</p><p>I&apos;d really like to understand more about the problem you are having<br/>here, so we can improve sagittal or its explanatory materials.</p><p>The mixed-sagittal notation for 17-equal is exactly the same as the<br/>HEWM notation for 17-equal. To notate 17-equal the only symbols<br/>required apart from conventional sharps and flats are quartertone<br/>symbols, which in the case of HEWM and Sagittal are ordinary up and<br/>down arrows.</p><p>I know people get scared off by the complexity of the full sagittal<br/>system. But you have to realise that if you only need the capability<br/>provided by Tartini-Couper, or the slightly greater capability<br/>provided by HEWM or Sims-Maneri, then the corresponding Mixed-Sagittal<br/>is _exactly_ as complicated as they are. i.e. not complicated at all.</p><p>The difference is, if and when you decide you need greater capability,<br/>sagittal extends in a logical and beautiful way. You don&apos;t have to<br/>throw away what you&apos;ve already learnt.</p><p>I also note that, like HEWM and Sims-Maneri, Sagittal is designed to<br/>be hand-writable. Its symbols have no more strokes on average than<br/>either of those notations, and the direction of its pitch alteration<br/>is far less ambiguous than say the HEWM 7-comma symbols or the<br/>Sims-Maneri quartertone symbols.</p><p>I&apos;d also like to remind folks that the Sagittal font _includes_<br/>Tartini-Couper quartertone symbols and Erv Wilson&apos;s plus and minus<br/>5-comma symbols which you are welcome to mix with sagittals. They, and<br/>the sagittals, are all designed in a consistent style, which is also<br/>consistent with conventional sharps and flats.</p><p>For those who prefer + and - to the half-arrows, for 5-comma<br/>alterations, we agree with Dan Wolf (the W in HEWM) that the sloping<br/>bars of the Erv Wilson version look much better on the staff than the<br/>ordinary textual + and - whose horizontal bars tend to get lost<br/>against the staff lines or ledger lines.</p><p>The Sagittal-Wilson set (which may be considered a variety of HEWM) is<br/>described on page 20 of the Xenharmonikon paper on the Sagittal<br/>website.

I&apos;d be pleased if you could explain<br/>more about the difficulty you find with the Mixed-Sagittal 72-EDO<br/>notation.

They<br/>can be stacked above each other in close chords with less interference<br/>than even the conventional sharps and flats.</p><p>For JI, not only do HEWM and Sims-Maneri fail to go beyond the 12th<br/>harmonic/subharmonic (although there were some proposals prior to<br/>Sagittal), they can&apos;t notate ratios as simple as 7/5, 11/10, 11/7,<br/>25/16, 35/32, 49/32 (and their inversions), without using 3 or more<br/>accidentals on the same note, pointing in conflicting directions in<br/>the first three cases.</p><p>Now some people don&apos;t mind having multiple accidentals pointing in<br/>opposite directions on the same note, and you can do that in Sagittal<br/>too if you want to. But HEWM and Sims-Maneri give you no choice.</p><p>Sagittal has a single simple symbol for the difference between the<br/>7-comma and the 5-comma (which can be called the 5:7-kleisma) and it<br/>is small in proportion to its size. Now maybe you never need to use<br/>that, but it&apos;s there in case you do.</p><p>Actually Sims-Maneri was never intended to notate anything other than<br/>72-EDO and its subsets, I&apos;m just assuming an adaptation of its symbols<br/>to commas for harmonics 5, 7 and 11 in the obvious manner, same as<br/>HEWM and Sagittal.</p><p>&gt; I will say this though: the reason that +/- works so well for the<br/>&gt; comma adjustment for me, and that 7/L does not, has to do with the<br/>&gt; former using some kind of intuitive, synesthetic paradigm, and the<br/>&gt; latter using a scientific, physical paradigm.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; Think about it: The simplest accidental there is, the flat and sharp<br/>&gt; signs, are both synesthetic terms:</p><p>Signs and terms are of course two different things.</p><p>&gt; we are either &quot;sharpening&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;flattening&quot; a note. Even though this isn&apos;t the original intended<br/>&gt; usage for those terms, it stuck in the popular consciousness because<br/>&gt; it makes intuitive, synesthetic sense, which is a phenomenon worth<br/>&gt; noticing.</p><p>But this would appear to have little to do with the symbols used,<br/>since the &quot;flat&quot; symbol has a &quot;sharp&quot; point on its bottom, while the<br/>&quot;sharp&quot; symbol is made up of nothing but &quot;flat&quot; strokes.</p><p>&gt; The original terms for sharp and flat were &quot;soft B&quot; for Bb and &quot;hard<br/>&gt; B&quot; for B natural, and the symbols for flat and natural evolved out of<br/>&gt; drawing a &quot;softened&quot; and a &quot;hard&quot; B in that way. Even using the &quot;soft&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;hard&quot; paradigm to describe this phenomenon is an intuitive,<br/>&gt; synesthetic term for it.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt; In fact, if you want to get into it further, we&apos;re using both of these<br/>&gt; terms to describe a &quot;raising&quot; and a &quot;lowering&quot; of pitch, do we not?<br/>&gt; The terms raising and lowering of pitch are also synesthetic! The<br/>&gt; point is that these terms are much better to describe that than<br/>&gt; describing a decrease or an increase of wavelength (which would be<br/>&gt; backwards from what we&apos;re used to) or a &quot;speeding up&quot; or &quot;slowing<br/>&gt; down&quot; of frequency. And this is the problem with the Sims-Maneri 7<br/>&gt; flag - it has entirely to do with math and theory, and does not<br/>&gt; describe the EXPERIENCE of what 7-limit intervals sound like, as the<br/>&gt; &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; monikers do for their function, or the &quot;raising and<br/>&gt; lowering&quot; monikers for pitch, or even the &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; for very<br/>&gt; small comma adjustments.</p><p>Totally agree.</p><p>&gt; I think that to come up with a really useful naming system and a<br/>&gt; really useful notation system, we need to do some kind of soul<br/>&gt; searching and meditating to describe if there is some common thread to<br/>&gt; the experience of a 4:7 or 6:7 or 7:9 interval and then use that term<br/>&gt; to describe those intervals. Then we&apos;ll apply that to whatever<br/>&gt; temperament we&apos;re working in. For example, in 72-tet, we can say that<br/>&gt; 7/4 is C-Bb that&apos;s a third of a half step flat, but that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really mean anything musically, does it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was describing in the other thread that I heard intervals as having<br/>&gt; various degrees of depth - 3/2 was the &quot;shallowest,&quot; 5/4 was &quot;deeper,&quot;<br/>&gt; and 7/4 was even deeper, etc. Describing an inflection of a 7-limit<br/>&gt; interval as &quot;deepening the sound&quot; makes more MUSICAL sense than<br/>&gt; describing it as moving by a septimal comma, although some layer of<br/>&gt; accuracy is lost, as how &quot;deep&quot; are we deepening here? But I think<br/>&gt; that as we explore the territory more and more, we&apos;ll find some<br/>&gt; musical connotation with some of these higher-and-higher limit<br/>&gt; intervals, and we can then give them those labels as &quot;nicknames,&quot; if<br/>&gt; you will. I do find that certain 7-limit chords have a very &quot;mystical&quot;<br/>&gt; quality to them... but I&apos;m not everyone. We don&apos;t want synesthetic<br/>&gt; names that encourage TOO much as well - 7-limit intervals can be used<br/>&gt; for a lot of non-mystical things. Just some simple notion like<br/>&gt; &quot;deeper&quot; or &quot;sharper&quot; or something would do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, to sum my position up nicely: I think that everyone can hear that<br/>&gt; the experience of moving an interval from 16/9 to 7/4 does have a<br/>&gt; quality to it that is different from just moving it down by 33 cents.<br/>&gt; This is equivalent to saying that the periodicity mechanism in the<br/>&gt; brain for determining intervallic relationships exists. What would be<br/>&gt; interesting is if we found a term for that quality and made THAT the<br/>&gt; 7-limit moniker.</p><p>The sharp/flat example shows that it&apos;s not essential for the<br/>synaesthetic term to match the appearance of the symbol, although of<br/>course it&apos;s nice if it does.</p><p>So, for example, you can still refer to raising and lowering by a<br/>5-comma as &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; even if you are using the sagittal<br/>half-arrows as your symbols. After all, the difference between the<br/>Wilson minus and the sagittal half-arrow-down is only the addition of<br/>an arrow shaft to make its direction clearer, and in the &quot;plus&quot; case<br/>it is the displacement of the vertical stroke of the plus sign to<br/>become the arrow shaft.</p><p>I like your suggestion of &quot;deep&quot; for a note lowered by a 7-comma.<br/>Raising by a 7-comma could be called &quot;tall&quot;. The sagittal 7-comma-down<br/>symbol could be viewed as a deep container beneath one&apos;s feet, while<br/>the 7-comma-up symbol could be viewed as a tall roof (or 7-colour<br/>rainbow) over one&apos;s head. It&apos;s nice that the Sagittal 7-comma symbols<br/>are deeper and taller than the 5-comma symbols.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=19439 href="#19439">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2008 9:53:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot;<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t bet so either--I think the font is beautiful, and the work<br/>&gt; done on it has been heroic and extraordinary, but I find it too large<br/>&gt; and unwieldy (yes, even the reduced set is too large) for the systems<br/>&gt; I tend to work with---I use standard sharps, flats, half-sharps and<br/>&gt; half-flats so far when I&apos;m notating, and haven&apos;t yet run into a problem.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you only need half-sharps and half-flats, then if you used the<br/>sagittal version you would only need _one_ Sagittal symbol -- the<br/>plain old symmetrical straight-barbed arrow that was used for this<br/>purpose long before Sagittal, in HEWM notation.

Are you there, Hudson Lacerda?<br/>&gt; What we need is much simpler bracket-free syntax for entering only the<br/>&gt; common sagittals into MicroABC, i.e. the set that has the same<br/>&gt; semantics and the same number of symbols as HEWM and Sims-Maneri --<br/>&gt; 5-comma, 7-comma and quartertone symbols. We need to be able to just<br/>&gt; enter one character for one accidental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realise the brackets are needed to support the full generality of<br/>&gt; saggittal, but it has always been a strong principle in the design of<br/>&gt; Sagittal that the ability to notate more complex tunings must never be<br/>&gt; allowed to increase the difficulty of notating the simpler tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; or maybe, as I fear, Sagittal itself is the<br/>&gt; &gt; cause of the slowdown...I simply can&apos;t think in Sagittal very fluidly.<br/>&gt; &gt; Heck, I even have to write out notation symbols for standard 17-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; sometimes to remind myself how it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d really like to understand more about the problem you are having<br/>&gt; here, so we can improve sagittal or its explanatory materials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The mixed-sagittal notation for 17-equal is exactly the same as the<br/>&gt; HEWM notation for 17-equal. To notate 17-equal the only symbols<br/>&gt; required apart from conventional sharps and flats are quartertone<br/>&gt; symbols, which in the case of HEWM and Sagittal are ordinary up and<br/>&gt; down arrows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know people get scared off by the complexity of the full sagittal<br/>&gt; system. But you have to realise that if you only need the capability<br/>&gt; provided by Tartini-Couper, or the slightly greater capability<br/>&gt; provided by HEWM or Sims-Maneri, then the corresponding Mixed-Sagittal<br/>&gt; is _exactly_ as complicated as they are. i.e. not complicated at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference is, if and when you decide you need greater capability,<br/>&gt; sagittal extends in a logical and beautiful way. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; throw away what you&apos;ve already learnt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also note that, like HEWM and Sims-Maneri, Sagittal is designed to<br/>&gt; be hand-writable. Its symbols have no more strokes on average than<br/>&gt; either of those notations, and the direction of its pitch alteration<br/>&gt; is far less ambiguous than say the HEWM 7-comma symbols or the<br/>&gt; Sims-Maneri quartertone symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d also like to remind folks that the Sagittal font _includes_<br/>&gt; Tartini-Couper quartertone symbols and Erv Wilson&apos;s plus and minus<br/>&gt; 5-comma symbols which you are welcome to mix with sagittals. They, and<br/>&gt; the sagittals, are all designed in a consistent style, which is also<br/>&gt; consistent with conventional sharps and flats.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those who prefer + and - to the half-arrows, for 5-comma<br/>&gt; alterations, we agree with Dan Wolf (the W in HEWM) that the sloping<br/>&gt; bars of the Erv Wilson version look much better on the staff than the<br/>&gt; ordinary textual + and - whose horizontal bars tend to get lost<br/>&gt; against the staff lines or ledger lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Sagittal-Wilson set (which may be considered a variety of HEWM) is<br/>&gt; described on page 20 of the Xenharmonikon paper on the Sagittal<br/>&gt; website. It also provides a solution for those used to the Sims-Maneri<br/>&gt; notation which uses a sixthtone symbol that looks very like the<br/>&gt; ordinary sagittal 5-comma (twelfthtone) symbol.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MicroABC should also allow the Tartini-Couper and Wilson symbols to be<br/>&gt; entered in a simplified, no-brackets, syntax.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Quartertones:<br/>&gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; Sagittal ^  v<br/>&gt; TC       &lt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Threequartertones:<br/>&gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; Sagittal ^# vb     (two Sagittal font characters)<br/>&gt; TC       &gt;# &lt;b     (one Sagittal font character)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sixthtones/7-commas:<br/>&gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; Sagittal f  t      (no conflict if only uppercase F used for nominal)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Twelfthtones/5-commas:<br/>&gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; Sagittal /  \<br/>&gt; Wilson   +  -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=19525 href="#19525">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2008 7:01:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just curious, how did &quot;e&quot; become the ASCII symbol for natural?

To notate 17-equal the only symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; required apart from conventional sharps and flats are quartertone<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols, which in the case of HEWM and Sagittal are ordinary up and<br/>&gt; &gt; down arrows.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I know people get scared off by the complexity of the full sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; system. But you have to realise that if you only need the capability<br/>&gt; &gt; provided by Tartini-Couper, or the slightly greater capability<br/>&gt; &gt; provided by HEWM or Sims-Maneri, then the corresponding Mixed-Sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; is _exactly_ as complicated as they are. i.e. not complicated at all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The difference is, if and when you decide you need greater capability,<br/>&gt; &gt; sagittal extends in a logical and beautiful way. You don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; &gt; throw away what you&apos;ve already learnt.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also note that, like HEWM and Sims-Maneri, Sagittal is designed to<br/>&gt; &gt; be hand-writable. Its symbols have no more strokes on average than<br/>&gt; &gt; either of those notations, and the direction of its pitch alteration<br/>&gt; &gt; is far less ambiguous than say the HEWM 7-comma symbols or the<br/>&gt; &gt; Sims-Maneri quartertone symbols.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d also like to remind folks that the Sagittal font _includes_<br/>&gt; &gt; Tartini-Couper quartertone symbols and Erv Wilson&apos;s plus and minus<br/>&gt; &gt; 5-comma symbols which you are welcome to mix with sagittals. They, and<br/>&gt; &gt; the sagittals, are all designed in a consistent style, which is also<br/>&gt; &gt; consistent with conventional sharps and flats.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For those who prefer + and - to the half-arrows, for 5-comma<br/>&gt; &gt; alterations, we agree with Dan Wolf (the W in HEWM) that the sloping<br/>&gt; &gt; bars of the Erv Wilson version look much better on the staff than the<br/>&gt; &gt; ordinary textual + and - whose horizontal bars tend to get lost<br/>&gt; &gt; against the staff lines or ledger lines.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Sagittal-Wilson set (which may be considered a variety of HEWM) is<br/>&gt; &gt; described on page 20 of the Xenharmonikon paper on the Sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; website. It also provides a solution for those used to the Sims-Maneri<br/>&gt; &gt; notation which uses a sixthtone symbol that looks very like the<br/>&gt; &gt; ordinary sagittal 5-comma (twelfthtone) symbol.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; MicroABC should also allow the Tartini-Couper and Wilson symbols to be<br/>&gt; &gt; entered in a simplified, no-brackets, syntax.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suggest:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Quartertones:<br/>&gt; &gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal ^  v<br/>&gt; &gt; TC       &lt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Threequartertones:<br/>&gt; &gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal ^# vb     (two Sagittal font characters)<br/>&gt; &gt; TC       &gt;# &lt;b     (one Sagittal font character)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sixthtones/7-commas:<br/>&gt; &gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal f  t      (no conflict if only uppercase F used for nominal)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Twelfthtones/5-commas:<br/>&gt; &gt;         up  down<br/>&gt; &gt; Sagittal /  \<br/>&gt; &gt; Wilson   +  -<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=19532 href="#19532">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
