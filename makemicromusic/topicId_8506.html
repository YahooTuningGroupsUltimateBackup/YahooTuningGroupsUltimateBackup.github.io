Aerophonious Intent uses strings, but has a<br/>larger pallette of sounds including a bunch of<br/>aerophone-like sounds (mostly generated by synths --<br/>primarily the TX81Z and Bitheadz Unity).<br/>Part of the effect is also caused by an extensive<br/>use of hocketing where each synth patch plays<br/>one out of every eight notes of the melody (i.e.,<br/>the notes rotate through the synth patches).<br/>This tends to destroy the coherence of the melody<br/>line, but makes for an interesting timbral/rhythmic<br/>effect.</p><p> -- Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=8590 href="#8590">ðŸ”—</a>Rick Taylor &#x3C;ricktaylor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2005 3:29:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Major learning curve though...
