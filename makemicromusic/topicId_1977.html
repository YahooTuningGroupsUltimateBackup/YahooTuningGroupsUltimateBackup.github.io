Conceptually one can enjoy the fact of starting and ending in a<br/>historical root where the middle part looks forward. Some kinda of musical<br/>time machine. It is amazing how the beginning and end take away any real<br/>threat of &quot;monotony&quot; that one can get with parallel harmony, also adding a<br/>consonant/disonant element as well.<br/>    With the idea of expanding harmony based on perfect intervals (4th or<br/>5ths) in the direction of 7ths instead of thirds,  i have used pentatonics<br/>with the following basic chords in various appegiated forms<br/>D A C<br/>F C D<br/>G D F<br/>A F G<br/>C G A<br/>D A C<br/>    Besides your normal parallels,  one can alternate the chord chosen in<br/>such a way that the melody note is doubled by a sequence where when<br/>ascending one can progress from root to &quot;seventh&quot; to fifth- vice versa<br/>descending. Hopefully i will be able to take a look at<br/>the inversion of the tetrad you are using they all sound good to me) and<br/>work out such a pattern just for fun.<br/>    I think stravinsky would have enjoyed your example as he liked to<br/>superimpose different historical periods or chain them together in musical<br/>viable ways.<br/>    It was quite informative and I truly got some things out of it i can&apos;t<br/>express. Thanks</p><p>&quot;M.

The highest voices<br/>&gt; moves entirely in regular Pythagorean steps: 9:8 whole-tones and<br/>&gt; 256:243 semitones. However, in moving from the opening 2:3:4 to the<br/>&gt; following 14:18:21:24 which starts the chain of parallel sonorities,<br/>&gt; the lowest and next to highest voices ascend by a 21:16 (D3-E}3,<br/>&gt; A3-B}3), a 9:8 plus a 7:6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From there, all the voices move by identical steps in the parallel<br/>&gt; motion, something that makes it different from the parallel thirds and<br/>&gt; sixths of styles like 15th-century fauxbourdon, and maybe a bit like<br/>&gt; an organ mixture stop. Then we come to the final cadence, where the<br/>&gt; upper voice and the next to lowest ascend by usual 9:8 steps, while<br/>&gt; the other voices descend by 28:27 steps. It&apos;s a counterpoint of<br/>&gt; epimores.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, thanks for this topic, which gave me a good excuse to produce<br/>&gt; a bit of actual music for sharing here, albeit via MIDI rather than<br/>&gt; with the kind of acoustical instruments you have crafted over the<br/>&gt; years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, thanks to Robert Walker for a beautiful CD I want to review here<br/>&gt; soon, including a wonderful chant melody in Sesquisexta.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively, with peace and love,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
