It has a &quot;scripting language&quot;<br/>which makes it possible (in principle) to implement<br/>any desired tuning.</p><p>There are three microntonal scripts included:</p><p>(1) a dynamic tuning (this appears closely related to<br/>Werner Mohrlok&apos;s work, though it&apos;s hard to tell<br/>from the documentation).</p><p>(2) a 12-note retuning script (repeats the same<br/>12-note tuning over all octaves)</p><p>(3) quarter-tone tuning</p><p>I had hoped to make a script that would read in<br/>scala-generated files and then retune accordingly,<br/>but am stymied because the language does not<br/>have the ability to read in any kind of<br/>external files. So I have decided to write<br/>a script that will do any equal temperament<br/>(since this can be done algorithmically).</p><p>Here&apos;s the question: how should the relationship<br/>between MIDI notes played and sounded pitches<br/>be specified? It seems that there are two parameters<br/>needed, but they can be specifed in different ways.<br/>For example, they could be</p><p>(a) lowest pitch to be sounded<br/>(b) MIDI note that will correspond to the lowest pitch</p><p>I have (so far) implemented this by having the user<br/>choose a MIDI note number corresponding to<br/>the starting pitch and another corresponding<br/>to the lowest keyboard note. I am wondering<br/>if there is a better way.</p><p>Also, if anyone is using Kontakt, I would be happy<br/>to share the script.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
