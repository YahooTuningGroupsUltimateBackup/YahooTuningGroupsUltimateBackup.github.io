This could be applications, music, movies, etc. It has been endlessly debated in the press and public, and no consensus has been found.</p><p>The situation will only resolve through more discussion, but I believe the topic is too far OT for our forum, not to mention that I, personally, do not condone this activity. And since I am ultimately responsible for the health of the community, I&apos;d like to respectfully ask that any further discussion on this be done over at metatuning:</p><p><a href="/metatuning/">/metatuning/</a></p><p>...which exists for exactly these kind of situations.</p><p>So there you go - no judgements pronounced, no guilty parties, no acrimony, just a return to your regularly scheduled programs...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who, as Mom, appreciates all your efforts in making the above happen)</p></div>
