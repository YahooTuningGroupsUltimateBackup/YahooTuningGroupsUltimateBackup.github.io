I look forward to hearing the others who placed in the top<br/>ten.</p><p>Next, some of you have linked your entries for us to listen to...but my<br/>PC recently fried itself &amp; is now with the Great Motherboard in the sky.<br/>I&apos;m having to sneak time in on my wife&apos;s PC, and since she lives in the<br/>Land of WoW (when she isn&apos;t working) I&apos;ll be very access-restricted for<br/>the time being. In sum, I&apos;ll have to download the files piecemeal and<br/>listen to them later on my laptop, so patience please.</p><p>Third, I was delighted to find that my original version of Orion Pro<br/>(discontinued) still had an update for me to download. Previously,<br/>Orion&apos;s microtuning was restricted to 12-pitches (or less), which<br/>hampered wider explorations of ETs like 13 &amp; higher. This is no longer<br/>true, so I&apos;m working on a number of tunes in 14, 16, 17 &amp; so on. I&apos;ll<br/>post links as they are completed.</p><p>Best,<br/>jls</p><p>PS to AJK: I sent you a short e-mail from this list, but I&apos;m thinking it<br/>probably ended up moldering in your spam folder..?</p></div>
