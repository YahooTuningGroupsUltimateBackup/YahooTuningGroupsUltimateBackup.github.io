But you&apos;d think having only seen the VH1 Behind the Music on<br/>&quot;Hair&quot; about two days before, I would have recognized him sitting two feet<br/>away, but he actually leaned over and got into the conversation I was having<br/>with Angie about bassoons after having talked to Johnny about them earlier<br/>that day.  Well there&apos;s some symmetry, in May I&apos;m playing at a show where a<br/>Wendy Carlos piece is going to be played.  She might not show up.

I have NOOOOO idea what Joe P saw in it, I was<br/>&gt; &gt; just making a joke about the wisdom of including a drum solo!<br/>What<br/>&gt; &gt; next: a *bass* solo??? :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***Well, I thought Paul said that he was &quot;overlayering&quot; something<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; 5 or so against something in 6 in the &quot;drum solo.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How can it be a &quot;solo&quot; if he&apos;s layering something over it??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just a joke...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hmm . . . well in jazz very often the other instruments will play<br/>an<br/>&gt; ostinato during the drum solo . . . while a horn solo often has all<br/>&gt; the bass, piano, drums, and even guitar actually *improvising* at<br/>the<br/>&gt; *same time* . . . perhaps there&apos;s a different, *classical*<br/>definition<br/>&gt; of &apos;solo&apos; you&apos;re thinking of . . . (yeah, i think there is) . . .</p><p>***Yes, that&apos;s right, Paul.  It was only a little joke, coming from<br/>*my* direction, but I understand things are done differently in<br/>jazz...</p><p>best,</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=2389 href="#2389">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2002 10:32:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
