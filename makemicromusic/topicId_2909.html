The MIDI file was then<br/>processed through an adaptive tuning algorithm that adjusted<br/>the pitches of the notes so as to minimize the dissonance<br/>at each instant. The resulting MIDI file (still nontonal,<br/>but reasonably consonant) was then orchestrated with bass,<br/>synth and drums. The piece is named after a fictional<br/>captain who fell at the siege of Eriastur.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
