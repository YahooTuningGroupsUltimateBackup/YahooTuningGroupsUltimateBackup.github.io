A community of musicians has come together because of a common interest in alternative tunings, but this is often a least common denominator, if you will.   There is serious distance within the community with regard to background/style/genre/aesthetics etc.  and I think that getting into those issues would only distract from the concrete matters at hand.</p><p>On the old tuning list, I found myself in extended off-list arguments about whether or not Alvin Lucier or La Monte Young (both teachers of mine) really composed &quot;music&quot;, and a particularly ugly discussion about the role (essential) of African Americans in the development of Barbershop Quartet singing. Having learned my lesson, on this list, I have purposely limited my posted examples to pieces that have some immediate surface relationship to some non-controversial traditional music.</p><p>Writing about music is always going to be problematic (this is &quot;Seeger&apos;s dilemma: why do we write about music instead of music-ing about music?&quot;).  Pop and Jazz critics usually do it by imbedding the work to which they are listening into a network of other works with which they perceive relationships (I find that this kind of criticism is often little more than showing off your record collection -- ultimately just an &quot;I&apos;ll show you mine...&quot; contest, but one with a real commercial edge).  Generally there is little if any discussion of technical matters.  One might mention &quot;three chords&quot; or &quot;twelve bars&quot;, but no one really goes further into the voice leading (well, almost no one:  <a href="http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.04.10.4/mto.04.10.4.w_everett_frames.html">http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.04.10.4/mto.04.10.4.w_everett_frames.html</a> ). I would really love to read an extended article on drumset playing, a particular mystery to me, but that&apos;s probably too much to hope for.  &quot;Classical&quot; criticism does have an academic sub-genre which does get into technical matters, but writers who are gifted in delivering these to a general public are few and far between (Tovey, Thomson, Johnson). And when some one goes deep into analysis, run for cover!  The probability of being assaulted for the sin of taking music seriously is extremely high.</p><p>But thankfully there are plenty of concrete topics to discuss within our common territory -- the toys (machines, programs) we use to make music, and the techniques that make those toys, at least potentially, musical (whatever that may mean!).</p><p>By the way -- anyone else got a 13tet ringtone in fifth species CP on their mobile phone? (Sorry, just had to show off!)</p><p>DJW</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; In defense of the way post go.

It&apos;s all<br/>about independence between body parts, ambidexterity, accuracy at<br/>high speed, and at the highest skill levels complete 4-way polymetric<br/>independence.  A friend of mine, who happens also to be one of the<br/>most amazing drummers I have ever laid eyes on, can play 4 meters<br/>simultaneously (2/4 3/4 5/8 and 7/4), as well as 32nd notes with<br/>mechanical accuracy almost up to 200 bpm.

The last thing I would say - while looking at a list of hundreds of great drummers in many styles - is that it is rather uncomplicated.</p><p>&gt;What I&apos;d like to learn about specifically are the conventions of &gt;rubato-versus-tempo, beat-within-meter hierarchies, &quot;filling&quot; (how much &gt;can you do without obscuring the prevailing pattern), and formal markers &gt;(turn arounds, cadences etc.).</p><p>These are pretty varied topics, and probably would need to be filled in from a few sources (i.e. the first two are much more advance concepts, while many set books will talk about fills and song formats). In this respect, I will give you a couple of specific books after I make sure the ones that I would really suggest.</p><p>&gt;I am also interested in the question of whether the rudiments have &gt;persisted or not.  (In Jr. High band, I (a trombonist) learned a basic set &gt;of rudiments while waiting for the band teacher to finish teaching them to &gt;the drummers).</p><p>Only for a very surface approach. I&apos;ll put it this way: any time I see a book that talks about how to use &quot;rudiments&quot; on the drum set I just laugh, because this is some kind of low-level technician that can&apos;t really play (or teach). Drumming rudiments came from military tattoos, and were easy to use for rote teaching. They functioned as technique builders, but as set developed it&apos;s own vernacular, they have become less important, while the marching tradition (of rudiments) has become extremely specific and combative, with precision field drumming being the musical equivalent of a meld of synchronized swimming and monster truck rallies. Nonetheless, the rudiments encapsulate a lot of what a person needs to do with two sticks in their hands.</p><p>&gt;My old colleague Royal Hartigan has also written on drumming, but his &gt;books strike me as more synthesis (new ideas for drum set taken from world &gt;musics) than analysis.
