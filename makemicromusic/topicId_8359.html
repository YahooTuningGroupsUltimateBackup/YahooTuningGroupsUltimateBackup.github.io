The midi implementation either doesn&apos;t do pitch bends or does them inconsistantly.  In my opinion, the obiquity of Quicktime is the single greatest obstacle to placing microtonal midi files on the web.</p><p>With Finale, you can do quartertones via (a) pitchbends or (b) by setting up a non-traditional key signature and doing a full keyboard tuning external to Finale.  I assume that you prefer the former (if you want the latter, let me know &amp; I&apos;ll describe how it&apos;s done).</p><p>Finale does pitchbends either via note-attached expressions or directly through the midi tool. Note expressions can be graphic or not. The handy reference card that came with Finale will show the font set coding; the Maestro font that came with Finale has two useable sets of quartertone accidentals built-in. Take your pick. Click on a note with the expression menu open. Expression &gt; create &gt;  select your symbol, then playback  &gt; type: Pitchwheel ;  set value: set a number between -8192 and 8191. A value of &quot;0&quot; will be the 12tet value without pitchbend. Most synths nowadays will take a value of 4096 to be a 12tet semitone upward, so that a quartertone sharp will be 2048 and a quartertone flat will be -2048, but you may well have to experiment with this.</p><p>The midi tool has a graphic interface and is more useful when you want to do continuous events, like portamenti, or wish to assign a single pitchbend value to an entire region. Even better is to get the &quot;TG Tools&quot; set of add-ons, which makes portamenti a snap.  Advanced tools &gt; midi &gt; continuous data &gt; pitchwheel .</p><p>When using pitchbends, remember two things: (1) each channel accepts only one pitchbend at a time (which is a good reason to consider the non-traditional key signatures option, and (2) a pitchbend sticks to the channel until the channel is sent a new pitchbend value.</p><p>Good luck,</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=8378 href="#8378">ðŸ”—</a>Gordon Rumson &#x3C;rumsong@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2005 12:15:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Greetings,</p><p>THANK YOU!!
