Both the chords<br/>you mention above were variants of the more &quot;dissonant&quot; Blackjack<br/>chords that I was discussing with Paul Erlich and Dave Keenan.  I<br/>don&apos;t have my notes right here, but I believe they go pretty much up<br/>to ratios of 11...</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
