While I openly confess to having burned out on post-WWII serialist/expressionist pieces back in my college days, this one captures that flavor quite well. The piece highlights one of your strengths, which is the setting and interplay between main melodic line and the accompaniment. I especially like the few bars where the violin hands over the motion to the piano (solo), and I actually think there is room - even in this short movement - for a little more of that. The fact that the tuning is fairly subtle is a moot point, since it is probably a weakness of my listening rather than the construction.</p><p>While it is brief, I can certainly see this as the first movement of a traditional 3 movement sonata, with maybe an Elegy and Con Fuoco movements to follow.</p><p>Or not. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=15035 href="#15035">ðŸ”—</a>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2006 12:38:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well I enjoy the piece- but I&apos;m a fan of post-WWII serial music,<br/>especially since it&apos;s probably the usage of 12-tET with the most<br/>inegrity (and simulataneously doomed by the laws of nature, which may<br/>be a big part of its appeal). But &quot;atonal&quot; is something I&apos;ve almost<br/>never heard, and must be a great rarity with &quot;harmonic&quot; timbres,<br/>because once the notes start sounding, the field of partials is going<br/>to establish some kind of order within itself. For example, in this<br/>piece I hear the tonal center evenely rocking back and forth between<br/>F and E throughout the piece. Using rational tunings makes phantom<br/>tonalities even stronger.

(I like atonal music a lot, BTW.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess you have to go to Merzbow to be truly atonal.</p><p>Easier to do with noise :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Going back to the piece, because it had a beat and a melody it<br/>&lt;sounded<br/>&gt; &quot;semi-normal&quot; to me. I&apos;m finally understanding that I don&apos;t know<br/>jack<br/>&gt; about harmony, so &quot;semi-normal&quot; is as accurate as I&apos;m going to get.<br/>&gt; There were no places where the next note felt totally unjustified.</p><p>Melody has its own logic not necessarily dependent on whether<br/>tonality is perceived, seems to me.</p><p>&gt; Really, I was reminded of my experience the first time I<br/>heard &quot;Rite<br/>&gt; of Spring&quot;: I enjoyed it, but I didn&apos;t see anything particularly<br/>&gt; &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;out&quot; about it.</p><p>After growing up with Rimsky-Korsakov, the first time I heard RoS,<br/>it just sounded, to my great disappointment after the hype, like<br/>Korsakov the Next Generation (later I learned that Stravinsky was<br/>his student).</p><p>Weirdness and outness are highly overrated, things just are what<br/>they are, and different for different people. Merzbow sounds like<br/>Muzak to me, and &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; incredibly tragic- it takes<br/>all kinds to make a world.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=19993 href="#19993">ðŸ”—</a>vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2008 9:05:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>chromatic 19 notes per octave and very very ambient production.</p><p><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/mp3/daily20081121d.mp3">http://clones.soonlabel.com/mp3/daily20081121d.mp3</a></p><p>its just a daily composition experiment so don&apos;t expect too much</p><p>using sonar and z3ta+ thanks to Carl</p><p>Chris</p></div><h3><a id=19998 href="#19998">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2008 2:57:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>That was awesomesauce, especially with headphones.
