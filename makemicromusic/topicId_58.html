I will be adding a microtonal software<br/>page.  Now, I can handle the obvious things like Scala and Justonic Pitch<br/>Palette, but where I need some input is on more generic software tools that<br/>may have microtonal capability.  An example would be SoundQuest&apos;s MIDIQuest.<br/>This is a universal patch editor/librarian that has many editors for<br/>microtonal scales in MIDI synthesizers.  I&apos;d expect the other universal<br/>patch editors have similar features, but don&apos;t have any first hand<br/>experience with them.  Another example would be any sequencing program that<br/>allows programming of pitch bends per note on a global basis, so microtonal<br/>compositions can be created on non-microtonal synthesizers.  Algorithmic<br/>composition tools with similar capabilities could be a third example.<br/>Bascally anything that is designed or can be manipulated to help in the<br/>creation of microtonal music would be of interest.</p><p>John Loffink<br/>microtonal@...</p></div><h3><a id=60 href="#60">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2001 12:09:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Microtonal&quot; &lt;microtonal@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Bascally anything that is designed or can be manipulated to help in<br/>&gt; the creation of microtonal music would be of interest.</p><p>This was my idea as well for the &quot;bookmarks&quot; section of this site.<br/>One way to go about it is to let you put together the page, and then<br/>just put a link to *that* from this forum.

I have<br/>used an example he wrote several years ago for 72TET, and modified it<br/>for any other TET I desire.  That is about as far as I have gotten<br/>and there are easier ways for me to do it so I don&apos;t bother with it<br/>much.  I am planning on getting a Titanium powerbook for live<br/>performance and will probably use supercollider a lot more with it as<br/>a sound generator. Hopefully it will be in a less developmental stage<br/>then. I&apos;m not sure what the resolution is but I think you can<br/>probably write values at least .1hz.</p><p>&gt; For the Pluggos, exactly what can be specified to .001 hertz?  Are<br/>these<br/>&gt; self contained VST generators/oscillators.</p><p>They work directly with audio using MSP as VST plugins in any VST Mac<br/>host program.  There are probably more than 80 plugins at this point<br/>and they are fairly weird.  I use layered comb filters to approximate<br/>modes of whatever scale I might be working with - getting the values<br/>of course from scala. I&apos;m sure there are other ways to work with it<br/>microtonally using a little imagination.</p><p>If you actually want to make a melody with a scale (Can you immagine<br/>that!)  I think midi is the best way to go - using Symbolic composer<br/>or Algorithmic Arts.</p><p>Mary</p></div>
