You might consider posing the question on the Csound mailing list itself: <a href="http://www.csounds.com/list/index.html">http://www.csounds.com/list/index.html</a></p><p>- Dave</p><p>Aaron K.

There might be others out there, but one of the current algorithms/tools for this is MPEX2, which somebody licenses to various companies; I know that Sonar contains it. You can get much better pitch shifts than with previous technologies, but I doubt you&apos;d be satisfied at that range. I think you are really talking about resynthesis at that point.</p><p>I bet some guy in a university somewhere has built a library for Csound for this kind of thing - maybe Chris Bailey knows?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
