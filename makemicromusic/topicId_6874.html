I&apos;ve written a &apos;wrong note waltz&apos; or something similar. Too<br/>bad I have only a couple MIDI files of old compositions and they&apos;re in<br/>12-ET. I did retune one to 11-ET last night, and it sounded interesting (not<br/>bad, just weird).</p><p>Try retuning the file to something non-12-equal. That&apos;s the only way I can<br/>write microtonal music right now, write it in 12-equal and retune it with<br/>Scala.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2004 6:54:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt;</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/6874">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/6874</a></p><p>wrote:<br/>&gt; I wrote a waltz based on the idea of wrong notes.

I have no idea what you&apos;re hearing, but it sure is a<br/>curiousity...  :)  Whatever it is certainly does *NOT*  &quot;go without<br/>saying... (I&apos;ve studied the concerto in some detail...)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
