One thing I really hated were the<br/>wolf intervals that are present in all but the most simplest justly<br/>intoned scales like some tunings based on harmonic series segments<br/>and subsets. I actually like to listen to some of the ambient drone<br/>music based on such tunings by artists such as Robert Rich and David<br/>Beardsley. But that was not the kind of music I wanted to make.</p><p>I wanted the harmonic and melodic aspects of scales to be more<br/>clearly intertwined just as they are in the diatonic scales. Thus I<br/>gradually got interested in Paul&apos;s paper about decatonic scales. I<br/>read and reread it many times. It gave me a good no-nonsense grasp<br/>of the mechanics of not just the decatonic scales but also of the<br/>traditional diatonic and pentatonic scales as well. Then I finally<br/>decided to get my hands dirty and actually try 22-equal out (my<br/>musical setup of that time was such that it required a lot of work<br/>to tune a scale up).</p><p>I must say I was at first very disappointed with it. I seemed not to<br/>get anything interesting out of it. But the crucial realization was<br/>that this was the very same feeling I must have had as a child when<br/>I first got my hands on a 12-equal keyboard and just couldn&apos;t<br/>translate the musical ideas in my head into actual sounds. So I<br/>persisted and stayed with the tuning.</p><p>Now after two of three years I&apos;m finally beginning to get the knack<br/>of it and I love it! Lately I&apos;ve been playing around with this 12-<br/>tone subset of 22:</p><p>2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1</p><p>Start on C so that the smallest steps are E-F and B-C. I recommend<br/>this tuning to anyone interested in 22 because with it you can get a<br/>good grasp of what you can do with just one or two pentachordal<br/>decatonic scales. I haven&apos;t really thought much about modulation yet<br/>but I have a modded 22-tone keyboard waiting for that.</p><p>At the same time I&apos;ve been making music in good old 12-equal (also<br/>in the 7-limit TOP variety) and just developing my compositional<br/>process. My style of music seems to have been gravitating towards<br/>some kind of rhythmic electronic music with repetitive layers of<br/>sound. I know that most music that is nowadays classified as<br/>electronica fits this description quite nicely. :) But my style is<br/>influenced by various postpunk electronic bands of the late 70&apos;s and<br/>early 80&apos;s rather than the later house and techno music. One day<br/>I&apos;ll post a microtonal piece of such music here!</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2005 1:09:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The discussion Jon initiated inspired me to share my experiences<br/>in<br/>&gt; microtonal music making.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I first got into microtonality I was interested in just<br/>&gt; intonation.

Though I have no quarrel with those who follow it, lest<br/>I be misunderstood. No one should be made to feel they have any<br/>responsibility to work against the grain upon which they flow most<br/>naturally at any given time. I just happen to think that sometimes<br/>such hard, difficult work has its unique rewards.</p><p>&gt; Now after two of three years I&apos;m finally beginning to get the<br/>knack<br/>&gt; of it and I love it!

This was the keyboard setup used<br/>in my piece _Decatonic Swing_:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/decatonic-swing.mp3">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/decatonic-swing.mp3</a></p><p>The guitar in that piece sticks to the same set of pitches, except<br/>for a few notes where I was accidentally off by 1 fret.</p><p>Do you have any musical examples in this subset that you&apos;d like to<br/>share yet?</p><p>Some people find this subset and the decatonic music in it to be too<br/>conventional-sounding, since structurally it can be accomodated by<br/>12-equal (though with slightly more discordant harmonies). Those<br/>people might be more interested in other subsets of 22-equal, such<br/>as Porcupine, whose ability to completely violate 12-equal behavior<br/>I&apos;ve posted about to this list recently . . .</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/8726">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/8726</a></p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2005 2:13:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do you have any musical examples in this subset that you&apos;d like to<br/>&gt; share yet?</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>&gt; Some people find this subset and the decatonic music in it to be<br/>too<br/>&gt; conventional-sounding, since structurally it can be accomodated by<br/>&gt; 12-equal</p><p>I&apos;ve noticed this.
