You didn&apos;t mention what you are using to make the sounds. Is this a<br/>real piano in 19tet? Or a synthesizer? Sampler? Live performance? Etc.</p><p>Also, a small technical comment, not a critique of the music per se... The<br/>difference in amplitude between the softest parts of this piece and the<br/>loudest seems rather too much. This is a common complaint with me. If I<br/>turn up the beginning so that I can actually *hear* and appreciate what&apos;s<br/>happening (the opening tinkly sounds), then the loudest parts blow the<br/>house down... So I have to adjust volumes a lot. In general, I like a<br/>dynamic range from pp (which is barely audible) to ff (real loud), rather<br/>than ppppp (totally inaudible) to fffff (blow the house down)... :-)</p><p>&lt;rant&gt;<br/>For the film-makers in the audience... My wife and I both have this<br/>problem. Film-makers turn the audio way down for important face-to-face<br/>conversations and plot points, then crank it way way up for car crashes,<br/>action violence, &quot;excitement music&quot; and other sounds. What&apos;s with that<br/>anyway? Sheesh, with modern film and recording technology, they ought to be<br/>able to even it out more so that you can *hear* the conversations at<br/>normal volume whilst not having your eardrums blown out by the car crashing<br/>noises. We watch films at home with the volume remote in one hand,<br/>constantly going up so we can follow the talking and down so we aren&apos;t<br/>blown away by the action. Why should the audience have to adjust the volume<br/>all the time?<br/>&lt;/rant&gt;</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=17685 href="#17685">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 11:05:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I find this piece quite evocative, and agree with Kraig&apos;s comments.</p><p>One suggestion: it sounds to me as if it may not need to be so<br/>dense and note furious at times; the computer does a fantastic<br/>job but it may prove to be more difficult in actual performance<br/>than it needs to be. Not trying to change your ideas of course.<br/>For myself, if the idea requires something that&apos;s difficult to<br/>play, then so be it; it will just have to be practised a lot. But if the<br/>idea can be expressed in a way that&apos;s easier to play, I will go<br/>for that myself. It&apos;s just a practical rule of thumb I use, because I<br/>tend to like complex strutures, but I also don&apos;t like to make anyone<br/>work harder than they need to. Tell that to Brian Ferneyhough,<br/>right? : ) So, all this may be totally irrelevant for you and be<br/>politely ignored.</p><p>Anyway, nice work!</p><p>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Christopher Bailey&quot; &lt;chris@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a preview of my piece for MidWest MicroFest:<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://works.music.columbia.edu/%7Echris/19mix1.mp3">http://works.music.columbia.edu/%7Echris/19mix1.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/19mix1.mp3">http://works.music.columbia.edu/~chris/19mix1.mp3</a>&lt;http://<br/><a href="http://works.music.columbia.edu/%7Echris/19mix1.mp3">works.music.columbia.edu/%7Echris/19mix1.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The title is something like:<br/>&gt; Walking Down the Hillside at Cortona, and Seeing its Towers Rise Before me<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Christopher Bailey<br/>&gt; chris@...<br/>&gt; zipzappoozoo@...<br/>&gt; <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=17690 href="#17690">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 1:40:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Hi Christoper, I&apos;d like to ask about the means of production for<br/>&gt; this  piece.

If I turn up the beginning so that I<br/>&gt; can actually *hear* and appreciate what&apos;s<br/>&gt; happening (the opening tinkly sounds),</p><p>Yeah, what you want is called &quot;Compression&quot;.  I didn&apos;t do that, because this<br/>isn&apos;t the final version of the peice, and I figure you can do the volume<br/>changes manually yourself.</p><p>However, I should note that &quot;classical&quot; music is frequently recorded with<br/>little or no compression (because of the &quot;purist&quot; nature of the recording<br/>people in that field, I guess?? to be honest I don&apos;t know why they are so<br/>scared of it . .).  For example, check out the DG recording of Boulez<br/>conducting Ravel&apos;s Daphnis and Chloe, and La Valse (especially the latter).<br/>Both recordings are fantastic, but both have a huuuuuuge  dynamic range that<br/>makes the openings reeeeealllly soft and the climaxes reeeeaaaalllly loud.</p><p>On the other hand, if you look at the waveshape of almost any pop music,  it<br/>looks like total noise blast from beginning to end.   Almost funny.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=17691 href="#17691">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 1:43:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; One suggestion: it sounds to me as if it may not need to be so<br/>&gt; dense and note furious at times; the computer does a fantastic<br/>&gt; job but it may prove to be more difficult in actual performance</p><p>Well, I am imagining that an actual performance will be somewhat slower than<br/>this . . .there is a built-in rubato aspect to the work, that I like.
