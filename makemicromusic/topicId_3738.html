I&apos;ve had a lot of fun as well as very productive and unique sound creations with their tools. One thing I have not explored in depth are the custom scales, so I asked Edward Spiegel, of U&amp;I Software, if he could expand. He did and asked that this information be shared/posted here:</p><p>Begin forwarded message:</p><p>&gt; From: Edward Spiegel &lt;edward@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Date: Fri Sep 06, 2002  01:25:43 PM US/Eastern<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Metasynth discussion in microtonality forum<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Eddy,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are my comments which you can feel free to post to the list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MS is not intended as a soft-synth. It is a composition tool whose &gt; capabilities exceeds the realtime capabilities of the fastest desktop &gt; CPUs which is why it is not currently a realtime system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its microtonal capabilities are pretty astounding and it is the tool of &gt; choice for a number of composers whose work focuses on microtonality. &gt; Because scales can have up to 1024 steps, it is not in practice &gt; restricted to repeating scales. Scales can be defined in terms of &gt; either cents or ratios (expressed as either fractions or decimal &gt; numbers); scales can be either linear or non-linear. A freeware &gt; ScaleComposer was created by Kenneth Newby to simplify the creation of &gt; new scales. The CD comes with a library of over 3,000 scales and the &gt; simple text-format of scale files, makes it easy to generate complex &gt; scales or scales with large numbers of steps. MetaSynth also includes a &gt; number of built-in utilities for creating scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In addition, metaSynth can generate a scale from a sound sample by &gt; performing an FFT analysis and treating the harmonics as scale steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The creators recognize that MetaSynth is a beast of a different color, &gt; and it may not be for everyone. Composers interested in exploring &gt; microtonality should definitely check out the downloadable demo.<br/>&gt;</p></div>
