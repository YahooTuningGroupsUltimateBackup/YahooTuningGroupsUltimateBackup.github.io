I actually liked this more than Earlight, but that&apos;s just me.

Right now it sounds like the band is spread out around one of those big vacant ballrooms in the off-season on the Jersey coast.</p><p>The other thing: I know you are inventive enough to frame this more as a piece - how about things come to a semi-close at one point, and then a contrasting episode comes in, either a different tempo/rhythmic feel, or a more stark tuning/instrumentation? Then up to you whether you rondo it out, in ABA form, or go somewhere else. Even with the changes in the drum kit voices, the &apos;death march&apos; of the basic groove undercuts (IMO) the changes going above it.</p><p>And what a deliciously greasy clarinet thing you&apos;ve got happening! This is all so good - man would a double CD from you and Prent Rogers be a cool thing, with his proto-Mariachi/Norteno bands, and you are nearing virtual klezmer-from-Mars.</p><p>As always, I&apos;m impressed.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5621 href="#5621">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>12/16/2003 7:31:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

It almost comes off as a series of jazz<br/>*solos...*  It might be nice to have it more *polyphonic* in parts...<br/>layering so that there is more contrast and structure.  (I know this<br/>might &quot;muck up&quot; the sophisticated tuning paradigm, but that can&apos;t be<br/>always forefront...)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
