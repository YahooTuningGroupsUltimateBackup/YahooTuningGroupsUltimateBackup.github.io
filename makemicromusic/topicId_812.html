John Starrett, if you are reading this, I would like to humbly<br/>&gt; request to submit this music for your new Peace Page on <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a></p><p>This is really fascinating, Jacky, because, personally, I hear in it<br/>a &quot;call to action...&quot;</p><p>In that sense, for *me* anyway, I don&apos;t hear a &quot;meditative&quot; work as<br/>much as, practically, a &quot;military&quot; one...</p><p>I surely hope you are not offended by this; possibly it&apos;s just my<br/>*own* mood but, without getting too literal, I hear military &quot;morse<br/>code&quot; type stuff and actually the flight of jet airplanes!</p><p>Maybe this is not *at all* the kind of interpretation you are looking<br/>for... Could this be, possibly, somewhat subconscious on your part??</p><p>Anyway, again, please take my comments in a spirit of friendship and<br/>appreciation.  Perhaps I&apos;m just casting my *own* personal feelings<br/>and apprehensions on everything else... but that&apos;s what I&apos;m hearing<br/>here...</p><p>________ ________ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>ploo@...</h3><span>9/24/2001 2:21:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow Jacky, nice piece.</p><p>When I heard it, I totally saw Viking ships attacking a helpless<br/>village. Flaming arrows raced toward carnage.</p><p>Then the part where the drone changed, I totally could envision the<br/>Viking leader call for an air strike. Norse fighter jets carpet bombed<br/>the entire village. Many people were crushed by huge rolls of shag, and<br/>medium knap New Zealand wool. The carpet was cleverly coated with<br/>Scotch-Gard, so they could roll them up, and use them again.</p><p>Then at the end of your piece, it was unmistakable what you had<br/>intended. I absolutely totally could hear the beating.....</p><p>Uh........</p><p>Wait a minute. That&apos;s insane.</p><p>Nice peace Jacky. Nice peace.</p><p>GZ</p></div>
