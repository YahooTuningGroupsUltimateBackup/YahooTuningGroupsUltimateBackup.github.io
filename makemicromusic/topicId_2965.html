It is over 5 mb, so it is one of the larger of the files posted of late.</p><p>&gt;Isn&apos;t there any way to *stream* this stuff??</p><p>In a non-commercial way, no. You want to kick in the $$$ for a dedicated server with mp3 streaming capabilities.</p><p>&gt;Maybe he would do better over on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> despite the commercialism, since &gt;at least the streaming is instantaneous...</p><p>Again, don&apos;t forget your cable connection; few people are that lucky. Besides the hideous commercial aspects, there are often delays with <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, and streaming doesn&apos;t work for everyone, *especially* those masses on dialup modems. We&apos;re trying to find solutions that work for most people.</p><p>I&apos;ve already mentioned <a href="http://zebox.com">zebox.com</a>, which both Gene and Dan Stearns have used recently.
