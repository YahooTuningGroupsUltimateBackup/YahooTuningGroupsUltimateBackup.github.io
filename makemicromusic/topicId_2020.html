So if it isn&apos;t FTS generating the stuff, are you actually improvising<br/>&gt; separate parts in a midi sequencer?</p><p>&gt; It *really* doesn&apos;t matter, because they have a charm all their own, just<br/>&gt; curious to hear about the different ways you approach<br/>&gt; playing/improvising/pushing-buttons.</p><p>Glad you like it :-).</p><p>I&apos;ve got an option in FTS to split the keyboard into regions and<br/>assign separate parts, 1/1 of scale, even separate scales and modes<br/>if you like, to each region.</p><p>So, I had the left half of the keyboard up to middle c set up to<br/>play in the harp voice, and the right half to the ocarina,<br/>each with its own 1/1.</p><p>So the keyboard is set out something like this:</p><p>.........1/1.............60............1/1.........<br/>         harp                        ocarina</p><p>You can customise it all in FTS - set the 1/1 for each part, and<br/>the place where you want to split the keyboard and number of regions<br/>and the parts you want to play each region, then set the pitch you<br/>want for the 1/1,</p><p>So, the parts overlapped in range, and then just improvised on it -<br/>just played it all on the keyboard, in a single take. Used the<br/>default SB live voices and default Sb live reverb.</p><p>AS you say, it isn&apos;t FTS doing any of it, except the retuning.<br/>I&apos;ve been practicing polyrhythms a bit which tends to make the<br/>parts sound independent of each other when I improvise.</p><p>BTW since there&apos;s been some discussion of reverb,<br/>I have done some playing about with the reverb with other pieces.<br/>in SB Live there&apos;s an environment controls thing you can show and you can choose<br/>what kind of environment you want - forest, mountain, room,<br/>hallway, bathroom,... which is rather fun. I did my string quartet<br/>using the forest reverb, which gives kind of foresty echoes.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

I think one of the unsung uses of our latest bounty of technologies is the ability to *play*. And I don&apos;t mean Play, in a stiff and concertized manner, which is the environment I work in all the time (a professional symphony orchestra).

I *still* want to hear pieces that are worked out, slaved over, prepared with loving grace. But I also want to hear people&apos;s unguarded moments, those times when serendipity and electrons (or guitar strings) collide to form those little pieces that, after having played them, we say to ourselves &quot;Holy hell, I couldn&apos;t have *written* that if I had meant to!&quot;</p><p>Now that the gear and a place to work are set up, I&apos;ll have to investigate more of these fun corners of FTS...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.

Yes indeed, and I hope FTS will help with this, the more it goes on the<br/>more intuitive I hope the interface will become so that one doesn&apos;t need to<br/>think about how to do it, but just Have Fun :-).</p><p>The midi keyboard presets are an easy way to get started:<br/>In | Options | Presets</p><p>also<br/>Views | Midi Keyboard Retuning | Presets<br/>in the latest beta.</p><p>They have some examples with the keyboard split into two or more regions<br/>each with its own voice, and sometimes other things.</p><p>Includes Margo&apos;s sesqusexta with the two halves of the keyboard playing pythagorean<br/>scales at an interval of 7/6 with each other. Also a couple of variable comma<br/>meantone scales - that&apos;s Graham Breed&apos;s idea. You vary the size<br/>of the comma using the modulation wheel. Various othre things.</p><p>Then if one wants to change layout of the regions on the keyboard,<br/>or the positions of the 1/1s for each one, and so forth, it&apos;s:<br/>In | Options | Kbd regions.</p><p>One of the drop lists in In | Options | Configure midi keyboard needs<br/>to be duplicated into keyboard regions window as it is the one that lets<br/>one choose how to synchronise the 1/1s for the various parts - e.g.<br/>all treating the same note as the 1/1 key so that you get a single ascending<br/>scale all the way across the keyboard, or overlapping so that each<br/>region has its own 1/1 key.</p><p>I&apos;ve just done that ready for the next upload of the beta prob. later tonight,<br/>or tomorrow.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
