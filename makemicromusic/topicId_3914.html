In addition, there&apos;s &quot;Immanent Sphere&quot; and<br/>&quot;When Everything was Simultaneous&quot;, both of which are<br/>in adaptive tunings, one kind of tame and one kind of wild.</p><p>The CD contains several more pieces... which are also described at the<br/>website. If youre wondering what &quot;exomusicology&quot; means, you can easily find out.<br/>Also, you might be interested in the &quot;impossible instruments&quot;<br/>drawn by Pam H... very cool.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p><p>ps - I owe those of you who entered my &quot;name that tune contest&quot;<br/>a copy of the CD.

I &gt;will definitely post more on this one, and I&apos;ll be asking Bill to answer - &gt;publicly - questions about a couple of the pieces. But mostly:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;BILL! Would you mind posting to the list the best way for people to order a &gt;copy of the CD? I would recommend it very highly to all...<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks Jon, I&apos;m of course very happy to talk about the music, the tunings,<br/>the techniques, etc. Ask away.</p><p>As for how to get it, that one is easy - you can get it from <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a><br/>(search for &quot;exomusicology&quot;) or from <a href="http://Half.com">Half.com</a> (search for &quot;exomusicology&quot;<br/>and make sure that you&apos;re searching &quot;all categories&quot; - for some reason<br/>it doesnt seem to think exomusicology is &quot;music&quot;).<br/>Or of course, direct from me will also work....</p><p>--Bill</p></div>
