I enjoyed it tremendously.&quot;</p><p>Jacob:</p><p>&quot;I especially like the bass ostinato that evolves (is that the saz or<br/>the &apos;oud?). Did you compose with a mode in mind?&quot;</p><p>Thanks guys, both for listening and for the comments. The &quot;mode&quot; used is<br/>a hexatonic scale: 0 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9. (And it&apos;s the &apos;oud, Jacob.)<br/>This is the third incarnation of this piece, which I return to on<br/>occasion, and rework into a slightly different form. It&apos;s rather like a<br/>continuous work-in-progress, so there may never be a &quot;final&quot; version.</p><p>Harmonically, I find I&apos;m not too comfortable in 11-et; but I really love<br/>the monodic/melodic possibilities. I will most likely check into 22-et<br/>and see what I can do with that....</p><p>Best,</p><p>jls</p></div><h3><a id=16153 href="#16153">ðŸ”—</a>J.Smith &#x3C;jsmith9624@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2007 9:40:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon (the Greater):</p><p>&quot;I like all the parts, melodically and instrumental sounds, except for<br/>the drum sounds. Just doesn&apos;t go with the rest of the ensemble. I also<br/>totally yearn for some dynamic contrast in the piece, because it is<br/>seeming static and mechanical, when the music feels like it should ebb<br/>and flow more.&quot;</p><p>[The following post may contain feeble attempts at humor.]</p><p>Hey, it&apos;s my favorite critic! Where have you been hiding?</p><p>I&apos;m none too pleased with the percussion too. I may tinker with some<br/>Eastern percussion soundfonts later -- but remember, this is a<br/>work-in-progress (that&apos;s my story &amp; I&apos;m sticking to it) and I need to<br/>give you something to look forward to!</p><p>Besides, this work apparently sounds a lot better when compared to my<br/>other latest work, &quot;Sonata for Guitar &amp; Harpsichord in 19-ET&quot;, posted at<br/>ZeBox:</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music">http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music</a> &lt;<a href="http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music">http://zebox.com/jlsmith/music</a>&gt;</p><p>This is another one of my comfortably classical, un-threateningly tonal<br/>works of the sort that usually goes over well with the good folks at the<br/>Society. Sadly, I made the mistake of mentioning the &quot;19-ET &quot; thing and<br/>thus the silence has been deafening -- well, except for the occasional<br/>chirp of a depressed cricket.</p><p>Best,</p><p>jon (the lesser)</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=16154 href="#16154">ðŸ”—</a>J.Smith &#x3C;jsmith9624@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2007 9:57:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron:</p><p>&quot;Anyway, I always have enjoyed your work...I&apos;m curious, though---aren&apos;t<br/>you in that Delian society group?
