I recorded one track at a time. First violin, then voice, then recorder, and finally erhu. I&apos;m not very good at any instrument but I thought it may be fun anyway. Since all voices were improvised and it was hard to synchronize, this piece doesn&apos;t really have any meter. After the recording I did some equalization and removal of embarassing sounds. Enjoy, whoever may :)</p><p><a href="http://hcoop.net/~magnus/music/unofficial/Magnus_Jonsson_-_Friday_Quartet.mp3">http://hcoop.net/~magnus/music/unofficial/Magnus_Jonsson_-_Friday_Quartet.mp3</a></p><p>/ Magnus Jonsson</p></div>
